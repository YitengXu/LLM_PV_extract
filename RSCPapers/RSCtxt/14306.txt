    , Accepted 11th January 2022First published on 13th January 2022AbstractThe discharge of CO2 into the atmosphere has become a crucial issue for mankind and a great threat to the environment due to the escalating consequences of global warming. Accordingly, the potential utilization of CO2 for the synthesis of sustainable value-added products is significant. Chemical fixation of CO2 is one of the most promising methods to produce useful chemicals such as cyclic carbonates. Thus, the focus of the current review is to present the recent progress towards the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates using various silica-modified materials as promising state-of-the art heterogeneous catalytic systems. This review aims to provide vital insights and understanding based on four different classes of silica-modified catalysts, which include dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS), MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41), SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous-15), and different ionic liquid-functionalized, metal-containing and miscellaneous silica-based catalysts. Each class of silica-modified catalysts is reviewed and discussed with specific focus on their synthesis, physicochemical properties and catalytically active sites. Further, the beneficial aspects of silica-based materials containing different functionalities and the related reports published in the past decade are discussed for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxide to form cyclic carbonates. High surface area silica-modified catalysts and their attached functionalities exhibit highly ordered nanopores and highly crystalline nature due to their diverse properties, which enable co-operative catalysis, thereby resulting in superior conversion, selectivity and better yield compared to other homogeneous catalysts. The influence of the reaction parameters, synergistic interactions between the silica catalyst and CO2 and profound mechanistic details with respect to the cycloaddition reaction are given specific attention throughout the different sections and described together with descriptive tabulations and figures. Finally, future opportunities with respect to the development of advanced silica-modified catalysts for CO2 conversion to value-added products are highlighted.Arvind H. JadhavDr Arvind H.

1. Introduction
The industrial revolution has had global impact on the sustainable development of the planet, productivity of commercial commodities and human living standards.1–3 Simultaneously, the combustion of fossil fuels consisting of carbon sources such as base oil, coal, and natural gas together with uncontrolled anthropogenic activities such as transportation, production of energy and industrial processes has globally increased the atmospheric concentration of CO2 as a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas.4–7 This rapid enhancement of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere over the last few decades has led to the well-known greenhouse effect, consequently leading to an enhancement in the atmospheric temperature, rising sea levels, and environmental changes due to global warming, and thus is a major threat to human life.8–12 Therefore, the containment of atmospheric CO2 concentrations is inarguably amongst the most substantial societal challenges, which requires immediate scientific attention in addition to technological and environmental policy changes.13–15 In contemporary approaches towards the management of the existing anthropogenic CO2 concentration, traditional carbon capture and storage technology is a widely accepted technique as a balance parameter.13,16,17 Nevertheless, concerns over the cost and storage space of this technology has increased the interest towards the potential capture of CO2 and its subsequent utilization for the formation of added-value products and the development of products of scientific interest.18–22
CO2 is a renewable raw material, which is ubiquitous, cheap, abundant, non-toxic and non-flammable, and thus can be used as a promising C1 source for the synthesis of value-added products.23–27 CO2 is the most stable form of oxidized carbon compounds, which has two polar carbonyl bonds, but due to its linear shape can be categorized as a non-polar molecule.28–30 Additionally, it is thermodynamically stable (carbon in its highest oxidation state) and kinetically inert (requires the input of a large amount of energy) in several known chemical transformations.30–32 Over the years, CO2 has also been utilized in various sectors including separation processes,33 dry-cleaning,34 refrigerators,35 fire extinguishers,36 food,37 agrochemical industry38 and as a solvent for several reactions under supercritical conditions.39–41 Furthermore, CO2 has been proven to be a sustainable C1 feedstock in the chemical synthesis of several chemicals including methanol,42–44 urea,45 lactones,46 various heterocycles,47,48 biodegradable polymers,49 and carboxylated structures, to name a few.38,50,51 Moreover, in an effort to successfully overcome its kinetic inertness, the chemical conversion of CO2 into commercial products has been carried out through several catalytic routes such as homogeneous,52 heterogeneous,53 electrochemical,54 solar-thermal55 and photochemical catalysis.56
Currently, the most efficient method for CO2 utilization is the catalytic production of cyclic carbonates57–59 and polycarbonates60,61 through the conversion of CO2 and epoxides. This process provides 100% atom economy and efficient resource utilization. Cyclic carbonates are organic synthetic intermediates of five-membered heterocyclic compounds with excellent properties such as high boiling point, low toxicity, low vapour pressure, flash point, low odour level, evaporation rate, biodegradability and solubility in a large range of solvents, making them efficient.62,63 Owing to these characteristic features of cyclic carbonates, they have found widespread application as raw materials for the synthesis of polycarbonates, secondary electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, aprotic solvents, as precursors for polymeric materials, industrial lubricants and intermediates for the pharmaceutical and chemical industries for the synthesis of fine chemicals such as dialkyl carbonates, glycols, carbamates and pyrimidines.30,64,65 Cyclic carbonates were traditionally prepared by employing the highly toxic phosgene.66,67 However, a greener and alternative pathway for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates is through the insertion of CO2 in the C–O bond of an epoxide substrate.68–70 Due to the thermodynamic stability of cyclic carbonates, they cannot undergo ring-opening polymerization reactions, but can undergo polymerization with partial loss of CO2 to yield macromolecules with both ether and carbonate linkages.71 Thus far, a wide variety of highly selective and reactive catalysts have been developed for the cycloaddition of CO2 to yield cyclic carbonates.72–76
Several catalytic systems that work under homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions have been developed for the conversion of CO2 and epoxide into cyclic carbonates.58,68,77–80 Homogeneous catalytic systems provide excellent catalytic activity and selectivity, which include alkali metal salts,81 quaternary ammonium,82 phosphonium salts,83 ionic liquids,84 and Schiff bases.85 However, heterogeneous catalysts are more predominant than homogeneous catalysts86,87 because they can be separated easily, provide greater advantages regarding stability, separation, and handling, and can be recovered and reused for a number of cycles, making this type of catalytic system more expedient.88–95 Heterogeneous catalysts such as immobilized complexes or ionic liquids,96–98 zeolites,99 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),100,101 silica-based catalysts,102 organic polymer supports,103 metal oxides104 and carbon-based catalysts105 have been widely studied and reviewed in other review articles. However, although heterogeneous catalysts provide easy separation and recyclability, most of these catalysts demonstrate inefficient activity under harsh reaction conditions of high temperatures (>100 °C) and high CO2 pressures (>30 bar).106 Therefore, current research trends are focused on the development of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts with an abundant number of catalytically active sites, which can show enhanced performances under mild reaction conditions.101,107,108
In the present review article, we concentrate on the recent advances towards the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates using modified silica-based heterogeneous catalysts. High surface area silica has a wide range of applications in almost every field due to its diverse nature of different sizes, good thermal/hydrothermal properties, micro- and meso-structured dimensions, morphology, large internal surface area, high mechanical stability, enhancement in activity and excellent accessibility. The categories of silica herein are broadly classified as modified silica-based catalysts such as dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS), MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41), SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous-15), and different ionic liquid-functionalized and metal-containing silica-based catalysts (Fig. 1). Each of these sections reviews and discusses silica catalysts, with special emphasis on their synthesis and sustainability. Also, the morphological and structural characteristics of most of these catalysts using various analytical and spectroscopic techniques and theoretical DFT studies are briefly discussed. Together with the development of these catalysts, this review further focuses on presenting insight into their reaction conditions, catalytic activity and recyclability in detail together with descriptive tabulations and figures. Additionally, based on the principles of green chemistry, the scope of these silica-based materials for CO2 conversion at room temperature and atmospheric pressure especially under solvent-free conditions is a focus. Generally, the literature suggests that Lewis acidic silica-based complexes activate epoxides and a nucleophilic source enables CO2 activation, followed by its insertion and intramolecular cyclization to give cyclic carbonates. However, a few studies provide different mechanistic pathways, details of which are also elaborated. Finally, the prospects with respect to the future development of silica-based catalysts for CO2 conversion are highlighted.

2. Current status of CO2 fixation into cyclic carbonates through various dendritic fibrous nano-silica-based catalysts
Dendritic fibrous nano-silica (DFNS), also known as KCC-1, possesses the unique characteristics of three-dimensional centre-radial nanochannels and hierarchical nanopores.109–111 These structures exhibit highly accessible internal spaces, open pore channels and large pore volumes in the KCC-1 nanosphere.109,112 KCC-1 nanospheres provide excellent physical properties including a fibrous surface morphology, high surface area, improved accessibility to the internal surface, tunable pore size and pore volume, controllable particle size, good thermal stability and high mechanical stability.112–114 KCC-1 has shown excellent catalytic activities at atmospheric pressure and room temperature for the chemical fixation of CO2.115 This section broadly classifies and focuses on KCC-1-supported metal nanoparticles, KCC-1-supported-IL and KCC-1-immobilized catalysts for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxides. In addition, a small section specifying the synthesis of oxazolidinones via the cycloaddition of propargylic amines and CO2 through KCC-1-supported metal nanoparticles, KCC-1-supported ILs and KCC-1-immobilized catalysts is also summarized as a promising approach for future prospects.
In 2015, Sadeghzadeh et al. synthesized a fibrous nano-silica-supported heteropolyacid-based ionic liquid (KCC-1/IL/HPW) catalyst for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates under mild conditions. The KCC-1/IL/HPW NP catalyst showed an excellent isolated yield of 98% towards propylene carbonates under solvent-free conditions with 10 bar CO2 pressure at 90 °C for 1.5 h [Table 1, entry 1]. Through detailed studies, the morphology and structural features of the [KCC-1/IL/HPW] nanoparticles were analysed using SEM and TEM images, as shown in Fig. 2(i), which were used to compare the reused catalyst with the fresh catalyst. The high catalyst performance was attributed to the high surface area and high accessibility of the active sites in the KCC-1/IL/HPW catalytic system. More interestingly, the KCC-1/IL/HPW catalyst was prepared using a cost-effective procedure and could be reused for ten consecutive cycles without any significant loss in performance.116

Interestingly, numerous groups have studied and synthesized oxazolidinones via the conversion of CO2 with suitable reagents using fibrous nano-silica (KCC-1)-based materials as the catalyst. In 2016, Sadeghzadeh et al. synthesized Fe3O4/KCC-1/tetrazolylidene/Au as a catalyst for the synthesis of 2-oxazolidinone via the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2. The morphology and structure of the catalyst were evaluated and examined using different characterization techniques. On comparison with other catalysts, it was reported that 0.08 mg of Fe3O4/KCC-1/tetrazolylidene/Au catalyst delivered 95% yield of 2-oxazolidinone derivatives using H2O as the solvent under 5 bar CO2 at RT for 18 h [Table 1, entry 2]. This catalyst could be reused for ten consecutive runs without any loss in catalytic activity. Further, the excellent catalytic performance exhibited by Fe3O4/KCC-1/tetrazolylidene/Au MNPs was attributed to the promoting effect of the confined KCC-1, resulting in high catalytic activity.117
In another work, the same group reported the use of KCC-1 nanoparticle-supported salen/Ru(II) nanoparticles for the synthesis of 2-oxazolidinones via the cycloaddition of propargylic amines and CO2 under solvent-free conditions. The morphology and structure of the KCC-1 and KCC-1/salen/Ru(II) NPs were characterized through SEM imaging, which showed the dandelion-like structure of the catalyst. By using 1 mg of the KCC-1/salen/Ru(II) NPs as a catalyst with 10 mmol propargylic amine under 10 bar CO2 and reflux or 100 °C for 1 h under solvent-free conditions, the excellent yield of 97% towards 2-oxazolidinones was achieved [Table 1, entry 3]. They also analysed other aromatic and aliphatic propargylic amines, which showed excellent yields towards the corresponding 2-oxazolidinones under the optimized reaction conditions. The high activity and selectivity of this nanocatalyst was due to its chemical and physical properties such as size, shape, composition and morphology. In addition, the catalyst used in the reaction produced high yields within short reaction times and showed excellent reusability in the corresponding reaction without any reduction in its catalytic activity. FE-SEM analysis of the reused KCC-1/salen/Ru(II) NPs still showed their dendritic morphology although their structure collapsed to some extent after being reused ten times.118
In another work by the same group, they reported the use of a fibrous nanosilica-supported nano-Ni@Pd-based ionic liquid (KCC-1/IL/Ni@Pd) catalyst for the same reaction. It showed 94% yield towards 2-oxazolidinone with 0.2 mg KCC-1/IL/Ni@Pd NPs and 1 mmol propargylic amine under 15 bar of CO2 pressure with visible light irradiation using a 32 W CFL after 4 h [Table 1, entry 4]. The structure and morphology of the synthesized KCC-1 NPs, KCC-1/IL and KCC-1/IL/Ni@Pd nanocatalyst were examined through various analytical techniques. This catalyst could be recycled and reused in the reaction without significant loss in its catalytic activity for ten consecutive runs. Further, the KCC-1/IL NPs provided good immobilization of Ni@Pd on their surface, which protected the Ni@Pd NPs from aggregation and stabilized them during the chemical reaction.119 The same group synthesized a Cu(II)–β-cyclodextrin complex supported by KCC-1 nanoparticles, namely KCC-1/β-CD/Cu(II) NPs, as a catalyst for the synthesis 3-aryl-2-oxazolidinones from CO2, ethylene oxide, and amines. They reported an excellent yield of 96% towards 3-aryl-2-oxazolidinone with 1 mg of KCC-1/β-CD/Cu(II) NPs, aniline and ethylene oxide as the reactants at 20 bar CO2 and 100 °C for 1 h under solvent-free conditions [Table 1, entry 5] and that the catalyst was recyclable for ten runs. Also, the excellent activity and selectivity of this nanocatalyst was due to its physical and chemical attributes such as size, shape, morphology, and composition.120 Sadeghzadeh et al. synthesized a dendritic fibrous nano-silica (DFNS)-based nanocatalyst (DFNS/Dy2Ce2O7) through the immobilization of nanoparticles of Dy2Ce2O7 on the DFNS. The DFNS/Dy2Ce2O7 nanocatalyst was used for the synthesis of 3-aryl-2-oxazolidinones via the cycloaddition of CO2 with olefins and anilines under solvent-free conditions. An excellent yield of 98% towards 3-aryl-2-oxazolidinone was obtained with 10 mg of DFNS/Dy2Ce2O7 NP catalyst under 30 bar of CO2 at 100 °C for 20 h [Table 1, entry 6]. The DFNS/Dy2Ce2O7 catalyst exhibited good reusability with a slight 3% drop in activity after ten consecutive runs and 0.6% metal leaching during the recyclability studies.121
In another work, Qiu et al. prepared FeNi3/DFNS core–shell NPs, which were efficiently functionalized with a melamine–Pd(II) Schiff base complex to form FeNi3/DFNS/salen/Pd(II) MNPs. The FeNi3/DFNS/salen/Pd(II) MNPs were used as a catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the oxidation carboxylation of styrene with CO2 in a one-step reaction. It was found that the use of 8 mg of FeNi3/DFNS/salen/Pd(II) MNPs under solvent-free conditions with 20 bar CO2 pressure at 80 °C gave 98% yield towards styrene carbonate [Table 1, entry 7]. They examined and characterized the FeNi3/DFNS/salen/Pd(II) MNP catalyst using TEM and FE-SEM techniques, which showed a wrinkled radial structure and also solid spheres of the catalyst, which emphasized that after modification, the FeNi3/DFNS morphology did not change, as seen in Fig. 2(ii). They reported that this catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity and selectivity, exhibiting 94% yield toward cyclic carbonates for ten runs. DFNS provided intrinsic mesoporous characteristics, which were responsible for the thermal stability and high activity of the FeNi3/DFNS catalyst.122
Further, Zhiani et al. synthesized an IL-incorporated porous dendritic fibrous nanosilica (IL/DFNS) catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via CO2 fixation with epoxides under mild conditions, as mechanistically shown in Scheme 1. It was also discovered that these bifunctional phase-transfer catalysts showed excellent yield towards cyclic carbonates. They studied the effect of an increase in the amount IL/DFNS NPs catalyst, CO2 pressure and temperature toward the yield of the cyclic carbonates. It was noted that 98% yield of propylene carbonates was obtained under solvent-free conditions with 15 bar CO2 pressure after 2 h at 120 °C [Table 1, entry 8]. The produced nanoparticles of DFNS and IL/DFNS possessed a wrinkled radial structure of silica fibres and layers of nonporous silica, which were examined and evaluated using TEM and FE-SEM analysis. These bifunctional catalysts exhibited high efficiency for CO2 fixation under ambient pressure, gave excellent yields of cyclic carbonates, were easily prepared, and enabled the formation of structure-tuneable chiral cyclic carbonates via the kinetic resolution of rac-epoxides using CO2. Further, DFNS endowed the catalytic system with thermal stability, intrinsic mesoporous properties and high activity. This catalyst was shown to be reusable for up to ten successive times under the optimized reaction conditions.123

In another report, Motavalizadehkakhky et al. developed dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS)-supported platinum(II) complexes (DFNS/Pt(II) NPs) for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates through the oxidative carboxylation of alkenes. They performed the reaction under various reaction conditions such as different solvents with various terminal olefins and different catalysts. It was reported that this catalyst showed excellent product yields of 97% under solvent-free conditions with 30 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 5 h [Table 1, entry 9]. It was detected that olefins and ortho-chloro or meta groups were excellent substrates for the synthesis of corresponding cyclic carbonates under 20 bar CO2 pressure, aniline, (10 mg) catalyst and TBHP (20 mmol) at 100 °C. They observed and evaluated the morphology and structure of the catalyst using FESEM, as shown in Fig. 2(iii). Additionally, they discussed and studied the effect of CO2 pressure, temperature and increasing amount of DFNS/Pt(II) NPs on the yield of cyclic carbonates. These catalysts exhibited excellent activity and selectivity for ten reaction runs.124
Zheng et al. studied the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the oxidative carboxylation of styrene with CO2 using an aluminium metal-based fibrous framework of phosphosilicate, abbreviated as Al/FPS nanocatalyst, under mild conditions. The Al/FPS catalysts provided 98% yield towards styrene carbonates under 30 bar CO2 pressure at 70 °C for 8 h [Table 1, entry 10]. It was reported that the active catalyst exhibited the very slight leaching of 0.7%, achieving 92% yield of cyclic carbonate under 30 bar CO2 pressure at 70 °C for 8 h after ten runs [Table 1, entry 11]. The catalyst showed high reactivity, high selectivity, easy separation and excellent performance for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates at different temperatures, times and solvents. They performed and examined the morphology and structure of the novel fibrous Al/FPS NPs and that after they were reused ten times via various spectroscopic techniques. FPS possessed intrinsic mesoporous characteristics, which gave thermal stability and was also responsible for the high activity. Also, the catalytic active sites were assembled in the fibrous framework of phosphosilicate (FPS). The selectivity and activity of the nanocatalysts was controlled by their tailoring physical and chemical properties such as composition, size, morphology and shape.125
Recently, Bhanage and co-workers developed a heterogeneous catalyst of nitridated fibrous silica/tetrabutylammonium iodide (N-DFNS/TBAI) for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates under low pressure and temperature. The N-DFNS/TBAI catalyst with highly porous and stable nanomaterial synthesized via ammonolysis reaction provided excellent catalytic activity towards cyclic carbonates under atmospheric pressure with excellent recyclability. N-DFNS acted as a heterogeneous catalyst in combination with TBAI as the co-catalyst, providing 90% conversion, 99% selectivity and 89.1% yield towards styrene carbonates under atmospheric pressure at 90 °C after 12 h [Table 1, entry 12]. They performed comparison studies on the cycloaddition reaction with different co-catalysts such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), 4-dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP), tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB), and tetrabutylammonium iodide. Additionally, the excellent activity of the N-DFNS/TBAI catalyst was due to the presence of a high surface area with acid–base catalytic sites from N-DFNS, which played a crucial role in the activation of both epoxide and CO2. This catalyst was proven to exhibit recyclability for up to five consecutive runs with minimum loss in catalytic activity.126 Thus, based on the above discussion, it can be said that KCC-1-based nanocatalysts can provide excellent yield towards cyclic carbonates for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide under mild reaction conditions in the absence of a co-catalyst under harsh reaction conditions. The surface area of DFNS is significantly better than that of the conventional silica, which allows more active sites and better diffusion of the reactants than MCM-41 and SBA-15. Hence, in the future, more functionalized KCC-1-based catalysts through the increased accessibility of their generated active sites will provide better yields under mild reaction conditions.
3. Current status of CO2 fixation in cyclic carbonates through various MCM-41-based catalysts
MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41 and or Mobil Crystalline Materials) are classified as mesoporous nanomaterials consisting of a hexagonal amorphous mesoporous framework structure with large specific surface areas (800–1400 m2 g−1), large pore volumes (0.7–1.2 cm3 g−1), uniform pore size, and tunable pore dimensions (2–50 nm), which are of great interest for adsorption, catalysis, and high thermal, hydrothermal and hydrolytic stability.127–130 These properties make MCM-41 a suitable nanoparticle additive. Due to the large pores in MCM-41 mesoporous silica, they expedite mass transfer and its high surface area provides a high concentration of active site per mass of material.131,132 Additionally, this mesoporous silica enables catalytic reactions with bulky substrates.128,133 Thus, MCM-41 mesoporous silica can be an interesting material as a catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to form cyclic carbonates. In this section, we discuss MCM-41 mesoporous silica functionalized with amines and ionic liquids and MCM-41-supported metallic complexes as catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the chemical fixation of CO2 in epoxides.
In 2002, He at el. developed monomeric aluminium phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) supported on MCM-41 silica, namely ClAlPc-MCM-41, for the first time as a catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides. This catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activity with a TOF of 415 towards cyclic carbonates together with TBAB as a co-catalyst at 110 °C for 2 h reaction time. They performed a detailed study on the possible formation mechanism to show the synergistic effect of the ClAlPc-MCM-41 catalyst and TBAB, as presented in Scheme 2. The high catalytic activity was due to the nucleophilicity of the highly reactive anions of the quaternary salt and the electrophilic interaction of ClAlPc with epoxides, which resulted in the ring-opening of the epoxides. Also, the ClAlPc-MCM-41 catalyst could provide excellent recyclability for ten runs without significant loss in the product yield and also increased stability with the optimization of the reaction conditions.134

In another work, Lu et al. synthesized a salen–cobalt complex, abbreviated as salenCo(II)-MCM-41 catalyst, through the immobilization of cobalt complex in conjunction with a quaternary ammonium salt. The salenCo(II)-MCM-41 catalyst was used for the chemical fixation of CO2 to ethylene carbonate under supercritical conditions. Supercritical conditions are most convenient for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides because sc-CO2 reportedly has high solvating power towards various epoxides. The salenCo(II)-MCM-41 catalyst showed 18.4% conversion of ethylene oxide under supercritical conditions of 40 bar pressure with TBAB as the co-catalyst at 110 °C, 125 bar ethylene oxide with a flow rate of 10 mL h−1 and 20 mL h−1 for liquid CO2 [Table 2, entry 1]. The conversion of ethylene oxide was less than one-quarter of that at 125 bar, which was obtained at the same temperature and flow rates of reactants. By increasing the residence time of the reactants in the reactor, the enhanced desorption and transfer of the product by internal and external diffusion in the mesopores of MCM-41 resulted in a higher reaction rate for the cycloaddition reaction under supercritical conditions. They performed the characteristic studies, where powder X-ray diffraction patterns proved that there was no change in the structure of the supported mesoporous silica of the salenCo(II)-MCM-41 sample during the reaction under 125 bar pressure for 24 h. The salenCo(II)-MCM-41 catalyst showed high catalytic activity towards the cycloaddition reaction due to the presence of TBAB as a co-catalyst, which stabilized the epoxide during the ring opening reaction.135

Srinivas et al. reported the novel catalytic application of titanosilicate molecular sieves (TS-1 and TiMCM-41) for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. TS-1 and TiMCM-41 showed 51.43% and 100% yield towards cyclic carbonates with 0.0072 mmol and 0.0036 mmol N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as a co-catalyst under 6.9 bar CO2 at 120 °C for 4 h [Table 2, entries 2 and 3], respectively. They studied the effect of the reaction parameters such as temperature and pressure on the synthesis of cyclic carbonates through the cycloaddition of CO2 with epichlorohydrin. The synergism of the catalyst–cocatalyst and influence of the cocatalyst in the synthesis were observed. These catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and could be reused for more than six runs. The catalytic activity was enhanced due to the presence of N-based co-catalysts such as DMAP and titanosilicate molecular sieves, which exhibited excellent catalytic activity in selective oxidation reactions at mild conditions using H2O2 as the oxidant.136 This same group developed a highly efficient heterogeneous as-synthesized MCM-41 catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate precursors of polycarbonates through the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides under mild conditions without the use of any solvent or co-catalyst. They performed a comparative study on the selectivity of the cyclic carbonates to the corresponding epoxide in the presence of various solvents such as DMF and CH3CN, which increased the selectivity of the carbonates, and also CH2Cl2 and CH3OH, which reduced the selectivity of the cyclic carbonates. These catalysts in the presence of DMF as the solvent provided an excellent yield of 100% towards chloropropene carbonate under 6.9 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 3 h [Table 2, entry 4]. The structural features of the solid as-synthesized MCM-41 catalyst played an important role in the catalytic activity, which could be recycled for eight times through centrifugation and air drying. Also, the catalytic activity of MCM-41 was reduced after the fifth recycle due to the partial loss in crystallinity/long-range ordering of the catalyst.137
Furthermore, Park et al. developed immobilized ionic liquids (IILs) on hybrid MCM-41 for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxide. They generated chloropropyl-containing MCM-41 (CP-MS41) through a simple condensation reaction under basic conditions via the immobilization of trialkylamines (R4Cl-MS41). The respective SEM images of the CP-MS41 catalyst are depicted in Scheme 3(ii). The CP-MS41 catalyst immobilized with triethylamine (TEA) gave 69.5% conversion, 88.5% selectivity and 61.5% yield towards allyl glycidyl carbonate (AGC) under 7.579 bar CO2 pressure at 110 °C for 10 h under solvent-free conditions [Table 2, entry 5]. The chemical fixation of CO2 in cyclic carbonates was performed in two steps overall, with the first step involving a reversible reaction with the intermediate complex between oxirane and IIL (QX) and second step involving the formation of cyclic carbonates and QX formed by the irreversible reaction between the intermediate complex and CO2, as presented in Scheme 3(i). Further, trialkyl amine-immobilized ionic liquids (R4Cl-MS41) played a pivotal role in increasing the catalytic efficiency because the trialkylamine groups could be ionically connected to the surface of the supported materials through an appropriate linker, which provided more active sites towards the centre of the pores system. Thus resulted in high chemical and thermal stability, leading to high catalytic activity.138

In another report, Udayakumar and co-workers synthesized allyl glycidyl carbonate using imidazole substituent-immobilized MS41, namely RIm+X−-MS41/IIL, via the conversion of CO2 with allyl glycidyl ether cyclic carbonates. The RIm+X−-MS41 materials exhibited a larger number of active sites, more uniform pores, higher surface area, long-range order and better-distributed functionality compared to the materials produced through the post-grafting technique. They performed the reaction using imidazole substituent-immobilized MS41 [n-EImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-n-ethylimidazolium bromide-MS41); iso-PImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-iso-propylimidazolium bromide-MS41); n-PImBrMS41 (1-propyl-3-n-propylimidazolium bromide-MS41); and n-BImBr-MS41 (1-propyl-3-n-butylimidazolium bromide-MS41)] as the catalyst for the catalytic fixation of CO2. Consequently, 100% conversion of allyl glycidyl ether was observed after 6 h at 110 °C and 17.6 bar of CO2 with 89.4%, 91.6%, 97%, and 97.5% yield in the case of the n-EImBr-MS41, isoPImBr-MS41, n-PImBr-MS41 and n-BImBr-MS41 catalysts [Table 2, entries 6–9], respectively. n-EImBr-MS41 showed 98.4% conversion of allyl glycidyl ether with 89.3% selectivity and 87.8% yield towards allyl glycidyl carbonate under the same reaction conditions without any leaching phenomenon in the consecutive cycles, which was either unaffected or insignificantly affected [Table 2, entry 10]. Additionally, the catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity due the anchoring of the ionic liquid units, which drove the active sites towards the centre of the pores, thereby providing high chemical and thermal stability and leading to high catalytic activity.139
In 2010, Kim et al. investigated ID-CP-MS41 mesoporous catalysts, which were synthesized via the immobilization of imidazole on the mesoporous CP-MS41. ID-CP-MS41 was used as the catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the conversion of CO2 with epoxide. They performed a comparative study on the rate constant and temperature with different solvents such as DMA, NMP, and DMSO in the reaction between CO2 and oxirane (phenyl glycidyl ether and glycidyl methacrylate). The magnitude of the rate constants was defined as the function of the stabilization of the zwitterionic intermediates by the solvent.140
In another work, Lu et al. proposed N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-functionalized MCM-41 (MCM-41-IPr-CO2), which was developed for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides or aziridine under mild conditions. The authors reported that this catalyst showed excellent regioselectivity for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides or aziridines. Where 0.5 mol% of MCM-41-IPr-CO2 gave 100% yield towards cyclic propylene carbonates under 20 bar CO2 pressure for 48 h at 120 °C [Table 2, entry 11]. IPr resulted in lower catalytic activity than NHC due to the negative effect of its electron-withdrawing aryl substituents on the NHC nitrogen atoms. Additionally, the MCM-41-IPr-CO2 catalyst was recovered through a simple filtration method and reused multiple times (three cycles) without significant loss in its catalytic activity.141 In another instance, Niu and co-workers synthesized a binary catalyst system of a silica-supported Schiff-base cobalt complex, abbreviated as salenCoIII(OAC)-MCM-41 catalyst. The salenCoIII(OAC)-MCM-41 catalyst was used to synthesize linear poly(propylene carbonate) and propylene carbonate via the copolymerization of CO2 and propylene oxide with DMAP as the co-catalyst. It was observed that the catalytic activity of the reaction increased when the molar ratio of DMAP/Co was less than one and increased the selectivity of poly(propylene carbonate) and propylene carbonate. The catalyst system showed high selectivity for propylene carbonate over poly(propylene carbonate) under high CO2 pressure.142
Han et al. developed ionic liquid-functionalized alumino-silicate MCM-41 hybrid mesoporous materials [Al-MCM-41-IL], as shown in Fig. 3(i). Using Al-MCM-41-IL as the catalyst, a coupling reaction between propylene oxide and CO2 was performed for the synthesis of propylene carbonates, resulting in appreciable yields. The Al-MCM-41-IL catalyst was analysed using HR-TEM, as shown in Fig. 3(ii), which showed an ordered arrangement of hexagonal pores and the XRD analysis confirmed the ordered mesostructured, corresponding to the diffraction peaks of the (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) crystal planes. It was reported that the Al-MCM-41-IL catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic activity with 96.8% conversion of propylene oxide and 94.8% yield towards propylene carbonates with 0.4 g catalyst at 130 °C under CO2 pressure of 30 bar for 6 h [Table 2, entry 12]. The high catalytic activity was due to the ionic liquid-functionalized alumino-silicate MCM-41 mesoporous materials in which the ionic liquid provided more active sites.143

Adam et al. reported the solvent-free synthesis of styrene carbonate via the cycloaddition of CO2 with styrene oxide using a mesoporous MCM-41-Imi/Br catalyst under the optimized reaction conditions of 140 °C, 40 bar of CO2, and 6 h. This was the first reported epoxidation of CO2 to cyclic carbonates utilizing rice husk ash (RHA) as a silica source. They observed an excellent conversion of 100% and 98.8% selectivity towards styrene carbonates under solvent-free conditions at 140 °C, 40 bar CO2 pressure, 300 mg of MCM-41-Imi/Br catalyst, and 3.5 mL (30 mmol) of styrene oxide [Table 2, entry 13]. Herein, the MCM-41 material played an important role in the enhancement of the catalytic performance.144 The same group developed and examined the same catalyst, MCM-41-Imi/Br, which showed significant activity for several epoxides, namely, styrene oxide, epichlorohydrin, glycidol, allyl glycidyl ether and phenyl glycidyl ether. These reactions were carried out through synergistic catalysis and did not produce adverse by-products, with zero-waste and were 100% atom efficient systems. MCM-41-Imi/Br showed excellent yield towards several epoxides, where especially 1,2-epoxyhexane provided 100% yield and selectivity towards 1,4-butyl-1,3-dioxolane-2-one under mild conditions of 20 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 3 h [Table 2, entry 14]. Additionally, the system exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity due to the synergistic effect exhibited within the quaternary imidazolium ion and the bromide anion, which easily promoted the reaction.145 In 2019, the same group synthesized ionic-liquid functionalized MCM-41, abbreviated as MCM-41-Imi-All/Br, as shown in Fig. 4(i). MCM-41-Imi/All-Br was synthesized successfully via the utilization of rice husk (RH) as the source of the silica material. The MCM-41-Imi-All/Br catalyst was employed for the solvent-free cycloaddition of CO2 with several epoxides. As shown in the TEM images in Fig. 4(ii), MCM-41-Imi-All/Br showed an ordered mesoporous structure of the conventional hexagonal/honey-comb structure. The XRD analysis displayed the presence of several peaks correlating to the (100), (110) and (200) crystal planes of MCM-41. These catalysts showed excellent conversion depending on the functional groups in the epoxides and very high selectivity (>95%) towards the corresponding cyclic carbonates. In the model reaction, the MCM-41-Imi-All/Br catalyst showed 95.4% selectivity, 72.1% conversion and 68.7% yield towards propylene carbonate at 150 °C and 15 bar CO2 pressure for 8 h [Table 2, entry 15].146

In 2013, Bhanage et al., in an interesting approach, synthesized 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones using amine-functionalized MCM-41 as the catalyst under mild and solvent-free conditions. They performed the reaction under solvent-free conditions and studied the effect of catalyst loading, time, temperature and pressure. It was found that the amine-functionalized MCM-41 catalyst showed good yield and excellent regioselectivity towards the corresponding aziridines under solvent-free conditions. The amine-functionalized MCM-41 catalyst resulted in the formation of the desired product with 1-neopentyl-2-phenylaziridine and 1-cyclohexylmethyl-2-phenylaziridine, giving 98% isolated yield and 1-(2- methoxyethyl)-2-phenylaziridine provided the desired product with 95% isolated yield with excellent regioselectivity under 50 bar CO2 pressure at 40 °C for 8 h [Table 2, entries 16–18]. Further, the amine-functionalized MCM-41 exhibited very high basic catalytic activity, which could be easily separated through simple filtration method, and good recyclability, corresponding five consecutive runs.147 In another report, Zhou et al. combined KI with MCM-41 to synthesize [KI/MCM-41] catalysts for the cycloaddition of cyclic carbonates from epoxides. It was found that 92.5% yield toward propylene carbonate was obtained with 0.25 g catalyst and 65% dispersion of KI under 30 bar CO2 at 130 °C for 5 h [Table 2, entry 19]. The morphology and structure of the MCM-41 and KI/MCM-41 (KI, 35 wt%) catalysts was evaluated using the typical TEM. This catalyst with a 35% loading of KI showed stability without much loss in catalytic activity in the synthesis of various carbonates.148 Further, in 2016, Fan et al. investigated the Fe3O4@MCM-41/ZnBr2 catalyst for the synthesis of styrene carbonate from styrene oxide and CO2 under solvent-free conditions. The Fe3O4@MCM-41/ZnBr2 catalyst with TBAI showed 81.5% yield of styrene carbonate under 80 bar of CO2 pressure at 90 °C for 3 h [Table 2, entry 20]. Also, catalytic the activity of Fe3O4@MCM-41/ZnBr2 was greatly influenced by the Zn loading, the amount of ZnBr2 and TBAI, and the reaction condition parameters such as CO2 pressure, reaction temperature and time. It was noted that the catalytic activity was enhanced by the combination of ZnBr2 or TBAI. The catalyst showed reusability for up to five cycle without any significant loss in conversion, selectivity and yield.149
Bhanage and co-workers synthesized and characterized highly porous heterogeneous bi-functional catalysts based on MCM-41 with both acidic and basic sites such as ZrO2 as an acid and amino propane triethoxy silane (APTES) as a mild base, namely APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41, to synthesize cyclic carbonates via the conversion of CO2 with epoxide through a synergistic effect. The proposed plausible mechanism using the APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst is displayed in Scheme 4(i). They observed a good yield with various aliphatic cyclic epoxides such as cyclopentene and cyclohexene oxide under the optimized reaction conditions and >99% selectivity towards cyclic carbonates. Also, 97% yield towards cyclic carbonates was obtained in the presence of 16 wt% APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst with TBAI as a co-catalyst under 20 bar CO2 at 80 °C for 3 h [Table 2, entry 21]. They analysed the SEM images of the amine-modified mesoporous ZrO2-MCM-41 catalyst, as shown in Scheme 4(ii), which showed that the material was spherically shaped, and investigated the effect of structural and stability changes in the recycled catalyst. APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41 showed increased catalytic activity by the increasing amount of amine functional group (APTES) from 12.8 to 16 wt% and excellent recyclability for up to five consecutives recycle runs.150

Based on the promising work by Adam et al., in 2019 Ramalingam et al. performed the catalytic addition of CO2 with phenyl glycidyl ether to synthesize phenyl glycidyl carbonates via the immobilization of different halides in as-prepared MCM-41 materials such as ImX-MCM-41; X – Cl, Br and I. They compared and studied the ImX-MCM-41; X – Cl, Br and I catalysts using FT-IR spectroscopy, PSD, SEM, NMR, and BET analysis. It was reported that the high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-Imi/Br catalyst under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 4 h resulted in 100% selectivity, yield and conversion towards 4-butyl-1-3-dioxolan-2-one (4-BD) and ethoxy hexane (EH) [Table 2, entry 22]. The catalytic activity was influenced by the halide, which was determined by the balance between its nucleophilicity and leaving group ability. The catalyst exhibited good stability and reusability for four cycles.151 In the same year, Appaturi et al. developed and characterized ImCl-MCM-41, ImBr-MCM-41 and ImI-MCM-41 catalysts for the conversion of CO2 with phenyl glycidyl ether to synthesize phenyl glycidyl carbonate under mild and solvent-free conditions. This catalyst showed high selectivity and conversion with the best-performing ImBr-MCM-41 catalyst under mild reaction conditions. It was reported that the ImBr-MCM-41 catalyst showed excellent selectivity of 100%, 96.7% conversion and yield towards phenyl glycidyl carbonates under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 3 h reaction time [Table 2, entry 23]. Further, the higher catalytic activity was dependent on the halide anion, which was determined by the balance between its nucleophilicity and leaving group ability. The catalyst was filtered and recycled for more than three times without any considerable decrease in its catalytic activity and product selectivity.152 Recently, in 2020, Li et al. prepared bi-functional transition metal-doped mesoporous materials (Fe-HMS and Fe-MCM-41) using a facile hydrothermal method to catalyse the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates without any co-catalyst. The Fe-HMS catalysts were reported to exhibit 97.4% conversion of epichlorohydrin, 92.9% selectivity and 90.4% yield towards chloropropene carbonate under the optimal conditions (16 bar CO2, at 120 °C for 6 h) [Table 2, entry 24]. Fe-HMS showed higher catalytic activity towards five recycle runs compared to the Fe-MCM-41-based catalyst. Due to the novel synergetic effects of the coexisting acid–base active sites of the bi-functional materials, Fe-HMS exhibited excellent catalytic activity.153 In another interesting report, Fujita et al. synthesized 2-oxazolidinone via the carboxylative cyclization of a propargylic amine with CO2 in the presence of MCM-41 as the catalyst. It was reported that the maximum yield of 93% towards 2-oxazolidinone was obtained with 40 mg of MCM-41 and 1 mL of toluene under 50 bar of CO2 by carrying out the reaction at 140 °C for 20 h [Table 2, entry 25]. This catalyst could be reused for over ten times without any deactivation and was recovered by simple filtration.154
MCM-41-based catalysts can provide an excellent mechanistic pathway in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. These catalysts provide good yield towards cyclic carbonates under harsh reaction conditions. The optimal conditions for higher cyclic carbonate yield were found to be 100–120 °C and 10–30 bar. Noticeably, this reaction achieved high cyclic carbonate yields with a lower catalyst loading than most reported heterogeneous catalysts. The catalytic ability of most MCM-41-based catalysts decreased after the fifth cycle, which is possibly due to loss in their crystallinity according to the X-ray diffraction patterns of the recycled MCM-41. In the future, there is the possibility for the development of MCM-41-based catalysts for application under mild reaction conditions with retained catalytic ability after the fifth cycle.
4. Current status of CO2 fixation in cyclic carbonates through various SBA-15-based catalysts

Fig. 5 shows a representative comparison of three different types of porous silica, namely, DFNS, MCM-41 and SBA-15. SBA-15 is an interesting mesoporous silica material with a large surface area (600–1000 m2 g−1), pore diameter (2–30 nm), and pore volume (0.75–1.15 cm3 g−1) and well-defined highly ordered nanopores and uniform pore size. Furthermore, it can be functionalized with diverse metal oxides (active phase of the catalyst), resulting in high thermal and hydrothermal stability.155–161 In addition, it exhibits great potential as a support for the active phase of heterogeneous catalysts and results in easy diffusion due to the minimum obstruction by the adjustment of its pore diameter.162 In the preceding section, different DFNS- and MCM-41-modified catalysts for CO2 fixation reactions were summarized. Additionally, the cycloaddition reaction of epoxides and CO2 to form cyclic carbonates both in the research domain and large-scale industrial production using both homogeneous and heterogeneous SBA-15-based catalysts has been widely studied.163 DFNS, owing to its fibrous morphology and accessibility from all sides, exhibits a high surface area without blockage of its porous channels for catalytic applications. Nevertheless, it is very interesting to note that even though SBA-15 and MCM-41 have the same two-dimensional hexagonal amorphous mesoporous framework structure, SBA-15 provides some notable physiochemical properties such as thicker wall, larger pore size, dual pore structure, and higher thermal and hydrothermal stability compared to MCM-41.164 Additionally, due to the dual porous nature of SBA-15 such as mesoporous and secondary mesoporous channels together with the presence of intrawall ultra-super-micropores, it provides higher stability compared with the purely mesoporous structure of MCM-41.165 This section presents the various SBA-15-based catalysts for the chemical fixation of CO2. In general, SBA-15-based catalysts show better catalytic activities towards the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. This section broadly classifies and focuses on SBA-15 functionalized with different functional groups and modified and metallic-grafted SBA-15-based catalysts for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxides to form cyclic carbonates.
 Fig. 5  General structural comparison of DFNS, MCM-41 and SBA-15 silica. 
In 2005, Ratnasamy and co-workers synthesized adenine-modified Ti-SBA-15 catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides such as epichlorohydrin, propylene oxide, and styrene oxide and also carbamates, which were synthesized via the reaction of alkyl or aryl amines, n-butyl bromide and CO2. The TEM analytical technique confirmed that organic functionalization of SBA-15 did not significantly disturb its long-range ordering and mesostructured arrangement. Interestingly, the Ti-SBA-15-pr-Ade catalytic system showed high activity and selectivity towards cyclic carbonates in the absence of solvents and co-catalysts/promoters. It was found that the Ti-SBA-15-pr-Ade catalyst provided 94% conversion of styrene oxide as the model substrate and 94.6% yield towards styrene carbonate without solvent under 6.9 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 8 h [Table 3, entry 1]. Herein, the Lewis acidic site belonging to Ti4+ ions increased the surface concentration of the epoxide molecules, which consequently enhanced the catalytic activity of the system. Further, this work included the detailed study of the catalytic activity of the Ti-SBA-15-pr-Ade (Si/Ti = 40) catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates with CH3CN as the solvent but did not obtain appreciable results. After the tenth recycle experiment, catalyst deactivation was observed, where the loss in catalytic activity was due to the blockage of the active site pores by the residual carbonaceous matter.166

This same group developed Ti- and Al-SBA-15 functionalized with adenine catalysts for the synthesis of chloropropene and styrene carbonates via CO2 activation and utilization. Initially, bare SBA-15 exhibited weak activity and low selectivity towards cyclic carbonates. In contrast, the Ti-SBA-15-pr-Ade- and Al-SBA-15-pr-Ade-based catalysts exhibited 94% and 98.4% conversion, 94.6% and 97.9% selectivity and 88.9% and 96.3% yield towards cyclic carbonates under 6.9 bar of CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 8 h [Table 3, entries 2 and 3], respectively. Furthermore, TPD and DRIFT spectroscopy were used to determine the acid–base properties of the material, where NH3 and pyridine were used as probe molecules for the acid sites and CO2 for the basic sites, respectively. The DRIFT studies showed the η1(C)-type coordination on the organo-functionalized SBA-15 material through the activated CO2. Herein, the (Ti, Al) metallic sites acted as Lewis acidic centres and (adenine, guanine) as the Lewis basic centres, owing to which both catalysts exhibited appreciable catalytic activity. The experimental result showed that the catalyst did not show deactivation even after the tenth run.167
In 2010, Dai et al. synthesized 3-(2-hydroxy-ethyl)-1-propylimidazolium bromide immobilized on SBA-15, abbreviated as SBA-15-HEPIMBr, for the first time as a recyclable and high-efficient catalyst, as shown in the (Fig. 7(a)). They developed cyclic carbonates from the coupling of CO2 with epoxides in the presence SBA-15-HEPIMBr as the catalyst under mild reaction conditions in a solvent-free environment and in the absence of a co-catalyst. SBA-15-HEPIMBr showed an excellent conversion and yield of 100% and 99.5%, respectively, towards cyclic carbonates under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 2 h [Table 3, entry 4]. The SBA-15-HEPIMBr catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity due to its high specific surface area and high porosity. This catalyst was thermally stable and showed good recyclability, which remained almost unchanged after the fourth run and resulted in a good yield of propylene oxide for first seven consecutive runs.168
In another article, Ballivet-Tkatchenko et al. used an organotin(IV) species on SBA-15 for the direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonates (DMC) from methanol and CO2. This work provided an efficient one-step anchoring of commercially available [nBu2Sn(OCH3)2] on SBA-15, which afforded a stable catalyst system for the synthesis of DMC from CO2 and methanol. Post-synthesis silylation of the external hydroxyl groups of SBA-15 with trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) prior to tin anchoring drastically enhanced the catalytic activity, where there was no extensive template removal step during the post treatment with TMCS. Characterization of the materials using small-angle X-ray diffraction (SXRD) displayed the characteristic diffraction peaks, although their intensities decreased with the number of post-synthesis steps, which showed that the highly ordered mesoporous structure was retained after the incorporation of tin. The DMC yields for the SBA-15- and SBA-15-CH3-derived materials, expressed as the DMC/Sn ratio, of 3.2 and 8.1 were obtained at 150 °C after a reaction time of 15 h. The enhancement in catalytic performance was observed due to the straightforward grafting method from the commercially available active precursors. Also, the catalyst was recycled at least four times without loss in activity.169
Following the work by Ballivet-Tkatchenko, in 2012, Park et al. developed a series of SBA-15-based sulphonate materials, namely SBA-15-pr-SO3H (catalyst structure inset of Scheme 5). They were used to synthesize cyclic carbonates from CO2-epoxide cycloaddition in the presence of KI as a co-catalyst. The cycloaddition of propylene oxide and CO2 in the presence of the SBA-15-pr-SO3H catalyst was studied as the model reaction. The reactions were performed at 110 °C for 4 h, which showed 99% conversion, 99% selectivity and 98% yield towards propylene carbonate under 10 bar CO2 pressure [Table 3, entry 5]. The SBA-15-pr-SO3H catalyst also showed a very high TOF of 1947 h−1, which exceeded that obtained using ionic liquid and metal-impregnated silica catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxide. The synergistic effect between the SO3− group of the SBA-15-pr-SO3H catalyst and co-catalyst KI was responsible for the good catalytic activity. Finally, the reusability studies of the SBA-15-pr-SO3H catalyst showed that it maintained its catalytic activity without any significant loss in yield for up to five consecutive cycles.170

In the following year, Hesemann et al. synthesized imidazolium-functionalized SBA-15-type silica through the post-grafting reaction of a bis-silylated diaryl imidazolium precursor and a bis-alkyl imidazolium precursor supported by SBA-15-type nanostructured silica using grafting and passivation techniques. The organocatalytic properties of these materials were investigated using two different test reactions, namely, Henry reactions and the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epichlorohydrin. The catalysts were characterised using various techniques, where the TEM experimental technique showed highly regular architectures on a mesoscopic scale for the organo silica grafted on mesoporous SBA-15 silica material and the dark spots indicated the formation of deposits on the surface of the silica support, as shown in Fig. 6. The four different imidazolium-functionalized SBA-15 materials exhibited good catalytic activity for up to four runs and showed appreciable yields towards chloropropene carbonate under 6.9 bar CO2, at 130 °C for 4 h [Table 3, entries 6–9].171
 Fig. 6  TEM images of organo silica grafted on mesoporous SBA-15 silica material.171 
In another report, Dufaud et al. investigated the first example of a silica-modified N-substituted azaphosphatrane, abbreviated as [7]@SBA-15, for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. This catalyst was prepared via a multi-step strategy and covalent immobilization on SBA-15-type silica through triazole linkages. The authors focused on the immobilization of azaphosphatranes (AZAP) in the inner space of mesoporous SBA-15 silica, which provided beneficial changes in reactivity owing to its high specific surface area. It was reported that with 0.05 mmol of catalyst, 5 mmol of phenyl-substituted and chloro-methylene-substituted epoxides with 1 mL of toluene under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 80 °C and 100 °C for 24 h provided 21% and 49% yield towards the corresponding cyclic carbonates [Table 3, entries 10 and 11], respectively. The decrease in the catalytic activity of the SBA-15-supported AZAP-based catalyst was due to the steric nature of the bulkier AZAP group within the pore of the SBA-15 material.172
In 2015, Sun et al. synthesized and studied several metal (Zn, Fe, Ni, Co)-modified SBA-15 samples. The metal-modified SBA-15-based materials in the presence of KI as a binary catalyst were used for the coupling of CO2 with epoxide to form cyclic carbonates under mild reaction conditions. They reported the well-preserved Zn/Si molar ratio of 0.15, namely Zn/SBA-15(0.15) catalyst with a Zn/Si molar ratio of up to 0.18, through a one-pot synthesis method to develop propylene carbonate via the cycloaddition of CO2 to propylene oxide in the presence of DMF (Scheme 6(a)). It was observed that due to the presence of Lewis acid Zn centres on the SBA-15 surface, they activated propylene oxide, whereas DMF activated CO2 for the reaction. The Zn/SBA-15(0.15) catalyst delivered 96% yield and 99% selectivity towards propylene carbonate at 80 °C and 20 bar CO2 pressure after 9 h [Table 3, entry 12]. As supported by DFT studies, the Zn/SBA-15 catalyst system coupled the O atom of CO2 very efficiently and formed the stable intermediate complex of a hexatomic ring structure, namely IntB-3 (formed by CO2, K, O, and Zn atoms), as shown in Scheme 6(b). However, the SBA-15/KI catalytic system could only adsorb CO2 physically. Scheme 6(c) shows the energy barriers in the two reactions (reaction with SBA-15/KI and Zn-SBA-15/KI catalysts) as 27.0 (TSA-1) and 23.2 (TSB-1) kcal mol−1, which indicated that Zn was beneficial in the ring-opening process. The presence of KI as a binary catalyst and increase in Zn loading from Zn/Si = 0.05 to 0.15 significantly enhanced the catalytic activity for the coupling reaction of CO2 and epoxide. Furthermore, KI acted as a stabilising agent, which stabilized the opened ring of epoxide during the cycloaddition reaction of CO2. This heterogeneous Zn-SBA-15 catalyst showed excellent propylene carbonate selectivity for five catalytic cycles. Thereafter, a decrease in the yield was observed due to the loss of the component of KI because it was soluble in the organic propylene oxide (and propylene carbonates) phase to some extent.173

In another article, Sun et al. reported a novel bifunctional Zn/SBA-15-supported ammonium salt (NH3I-Zn/SBA-15) as a heterogeneous catalyst. NH3I-Zn/SBA-15 was used for the conversion of CO2 with epoxide to synthesize propylene carbonate. They observed the morphological structure and physicochemical properties of the NH3I-Zn/SBA-15 sample through the analytical techniques, which successfully identified the enhanced roughness of the long-range channel and structure of the catalytic sample using TEM, XRD, and N2 adsorption/desorption. Additionally, BET studies showed the reduction in the pore size and pore volume by the introduction of alkyl-NH2 and HI species. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was employed to determine the content of zinc ions per hour in per mole of produced propylene carbonates. The NH3I-Zn/SBA-15 catalyst provided effective catalytic activity with excellent selectivity of 99% and yield of 93% towards propylene carbonate with a high TOF of 306 h−1 under 30 bar of CO2 at 130 °C for 12 h in the absence of a co-catalyst and solvent [Table 3, entry 13]. They proposed a plausible catalytic mechanism through the cooperative activation of epoxide and ring-opening by the one-component and bifunctional catalyst, as shown in Scheme 7. The excellent catalytic activity was due to the synergetic effects resulting from the doped Zn and strong nucleophilic I− anion, which accelerated the activation and ring-opening of propylene oxide, consequently promoting the reaction smoothly. Also, the catalyst could be reused after five consecutive run with slight loss in activity.174

In another study by Bhaumik and co-workers, they reported the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and epoxides using acid-functionalized mesoporous silica (SBA-15 material), which was abbreviated as AFS-1 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The AFS-1 catalyst was synthesized through a post-synthetic route and showed 96% yield towards styrene carbonate with 5 mmol styrene oxide as the model reactant together with 5 mol% of TBAB under 1 bar of CO2 pressure at RT after 24 h [Table 3, entry 14]. The high catalytic activity was attributed to the ordered porous structure with good pore wall stability, high thermal stability, and high BET surface area, where the catalyst was cost effective and showed high recycling efficiency for up to five reaction cycles without significant loss in its catalytic activity.175 Furthermore, in 2018, Ogura et al. synthesised novel basic/nucleophilic catalyst methylated nitrogen-substituted mesoporous silica, namely MeNSBA-15 catalyst, via the methylation of nitrogen-substituted SBA-15. This was the first report on the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from cyclic ethers and CO2 with MeNSBA-15 as the catalyst and catalytic reaction was performed without the need for pre-treatment. The authors examined the methylated N-atoms, acting as unique catalytic sites and wide range applicability of MeNSBA-15 as a novel basic/nucleophilic catalyst. It was found that the methylation process enhanced the reactivity of the catalyst and TOF value after the methylation process. The MeNSBA-15 catalyst showed >99% selectivity towards propylene carbonate under 30 bar of CO2 at 100 °C for 3 h [Table 3, entry 15]. They observed and determined the most plausible Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type mechanism for MeNSBA-15 for the conversion of CO2 to epoxide, which suggested that the rate-determining step was the bimolecular reaction between the ring-opened alkoxide and carbamate on the neighbouring methylated nitrogen pair sites, as shown in the inset of the Scheme 8. The enhancement in the catalytic activity due to the methylation was explained by the enhanced basicity and nucleophilicity, where MeNSBA-15 worked as an enhanced basic or nucleophilic catalyst. Recycling tests were conducted for the MeNSBA-15 catalyst and the product yield for its second and third uses was 63% and 43%, respectively.176

In another report, Sayari et al. developed an N,N,N-tributyl-N-propylammonium iodide-functionalized mesoporous silica (SBA-15 and silica gel) catalyst under solvent-free conditions for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2. This group prepared and examined two tributylpropylammonium iodide-immobilized mesoporous silicas (PHS-1 and PHS-2), as shown in Fig. 7(c). They were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of CO2 with two model epoxides, namely, 1,2-epoxybutane and styrene oxide, to produce cyclic carbonates. The PHS-2 catalyst was the remarkably more active, selective and stable versatile catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonates. The enhancement in the activation of styrene oxide was due to the presence of more non-functionalized silanol groups on PHS-2 compared to PHS-1. Also, the unreacted silanol groups on the support (SBA-15) activated the epoxides by the enhancement through hydrogen bonding. PHS-2 also exhibited 92.2% yield and 94.7% selectivity towards chloropropene carbonate under 10 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 2 h [Table 3, entry 16]. These materials were found to be robust and easily reusable for five runs as hybrid catalysts for this cycloaddition reaction under mild conditions (2 mol% catalyst loading, 10 bar CO2, 100 °C, ≤6 h reaction time) to obtain excellent yields and high selectivity (both >95%) for the desired cyclic carbonates.177
In another report, Dufaud et al. studied the role of ultra-large pore SBA-15 ULP silica on the catalytic activity of quaternary ammonium halides, namely NBu4Cl, NBu4Br and NBu4I, with tetrabutylammonium halide salts as a co-catalyst for the coupling of epoxides and CO2. It was observed that the NBu4Br and NBu4I catalysts improved the yield of the reaction due to the presence of bromide and iodide ions, respectively, which provided positive activation of the epoxide and increased the turnover number (TON) from 187 to 331. The higher catalytic activity shown by the NBu4I salt could be increased by a factor of ten due to the addition of a relevant amount of mesoporous silica. This catalytic system showed 76% yield and 100 of selectivity towards cyclic carbonate products for a wide variety of substrates under mild conditions using tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) as the co-catalyst at 80 °C, under 10 bar of CO2 pressure and 6 h reaction time [Table 3, entry 17].179
Recently, the most effective heterogeneous catalyst-immobilized ionic liquid and SBA-15, namely [IMCA]2Br2@SBA-15 (structure shown in inset of Scheme 9(i)), was proposed by Cheng et al. for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates. The reaction was performed in a 25 mL high-pressure microreactor. The [IMCA]2Br2@SBA-15 catalyst of multi-site immobilized ionic liquids showed the best catalytic activity with a high yield of 97.4% and almost 100% selectivity towards propylene carbonate under 25 bar of CO2 pressure at 130 °C for 4 h [Table 3, entry 18]. They clearly observed the strip sharp and regular appearance of SBA-15 and hexagonal structure of [IMCA]2Br2@SBA-15, as shown in the TEM image in Scheme 9(ii). The DFT study showed the synergistic effects between the multiple active sites due to hydrogen bond interaction, which improved the catalytic activity and enhanced the yield of cyclic carbonates. Remarkably, this catalyst could be easily recovered through simple filtration and exhibited good catalytic activity without any significant loss after being reused for five reaction cycles.180

In another report, Mohanty et al. synthesized a hierarchical nano-porous composite of polytriazine-SBA-16 (PT@SBA-16) as a multifunctional (hydroxyl and amine) heterogeneous catalyst for the conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates. Consequently, 100% conversion of epichlorohydrin and 100% selectivity and yield towards chloropropene carbonate were observed because epichlorohydrin contained a good leaving group, namely, Cl−, under 4 bar CO2 pressure and solvent- and co-catalyst-free conditions at 100 °C for 16 h [Table 3, entry 19]. These catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity on the substrate epoxides with both electron-withdrawing and donating groups. Additionally, the enhanced catalytic activity was due to the presence of SBA-16 in the catalyst, which showed characteristic properties such as thicker framework walls, small size of primary particles, three-dimensional cage (Im3m type) structure for favourable mass transfer, high thermal stability and large pore volume. The experimental results suggested that the catalyst showed effective reusability with 80% retention of its catalytic activity after five consecutive runs.181
Interestingly, Sun et al. developed a novel non-metal B-doped Lewis acid–base catalyst with hydrogen bond donor (HBD) groups, abbreviated as (B-SBA-15-NH2) catalyst, for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with various epoxides. The B-SBA-15-NH2 catalyst was synthesized through the hydrothermal process and post-modification. They examined and evaluated the porous structure of the B-SBA-15-NH2 catalyst through spectroscopic techniques, as shown in the TEM and SEM images in Fig. 8. These spectroscopic studies gave detailed information about the porous structure of the periodic honeycomb-like channels which could be explicitly seen in B-SBA-15-NH2 through TEM, and surface morphology of the catalyst and distribution of the elements such as Si, O, B and N in the B-SBA-15-NH2 structure, as shown in the Fig. 8(i). It was reported that the B-SBA-15-NH2 catalyst showed successful conversion of CO2 and propylene oxide into propylene carbonate as the model reaction with 95% yield at 120 °C, under 2 bar CO2 for 6 h without the use of additional solvents in the presence of KI as a co-catalyst [Table 3, entry 20]. Moreover, the efficient catalytic activity of the B-SBA-15-NH2 catalyst was due to the synergetic effect of the B and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the SBA-15 channel as HBD groups together with the functionalized –NH2 groups. Also, the catalyst showed 91% yield after five runs with slight loss in B concentration in the supernatant.182

Further, Anwander et al. developed cerium pyrazolates grafted on mesoporous silica SBA-15 for the catalytic cycloaddition of epoxides and CO2. They characterized and analysed the hybrid materials, namely, [Ce(Me2pz)4]2@SBA-15500, Ce(Me2pz)4(thf)@SBA-15500, Ce4(Me2pz)12@SBA-15500 and [Ce(Me2pz)3(thf)]2@SBA-15500 (Me2pz = 3,5-dimethylpyrazolato), which were obtained by grafting both ceric and cerous rare-earth-metal pyrazolates on the large-pore mesoporous silica SBA-15500, through DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy), solid-state 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, ICP/OES, and N2 physisorption, as shown in the Fig. 8(ii). Consequently, >99% yield towards cyclic carbonates was obtained with 0.5% of [Ce(Me2pz)4]2@SBA-15500 (H1) as the catalyst in the presence of TBAB as a co-catalyst under 10 bar CO2 pressure at 90 °C for 24 h [Table 3, entry 21]. However, the catalytic activities of the hybrid material were lower compared with that of homogeneous catalytic systems. This was due to the pore confinement issues, while the reaction required four different reaction partners. Additionally, the experimental results suggested that the reduction in conversion after the second run was caused by the loss of the hybrid material through the filtering or washing process. These heterogenized catalysts were easily recyclable for four runs and also reused without substantial loss in their catalytic activity.183
In another instance, Eshghi et al. performed a series of reactions on various five-membered cyclic carbonates of epoxide including epoxy styrene, epoxy propyl methacrylate, 2,3-epoxypropyl phenyl ether, 1,2-epoxy butane, epoxy cyclohexane and 2,3-epoxy propyl isopropyl ether with CO2 in the presence of gold NPs in SBA-15/N mesopore catalyst, abbreviated as SBA-15/N-Au NPs, under solvent-free conditions, as shown in Fig. 7(d). The SBA-15/N-AuNP catalyst showed high activity, reusability and good recyclability towards the formation of cyclic carbonates. These studies showed the effect of the organic linkers in SBA-15-modified amine-containing organic linkers in gold nanoparticles on the size, metal loading capacity, catalytic activity, dispersity and reusability. They studied the functionalization of the SBA-15 surface with organic linkers through various techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), which provided information on the grafting of the organic linker on the surface of SBA-15. XRD provided the peaks corresponding to the organic linker-incorporated gold nanoparticles. This catalyst exhibited excellent yield of 96% epoxy styrene, 91% epoxy propyl methacrylate, 95% 2,3-epoxypropyl phenyl ether and 2,3-epoxy propyl isopropyl ether, and 94% epichlorohydrin and epoxy cyclohexane towards cyclic carbonates with TBAB as a co-catalyst under 5 bar CO2 pressure at 80 °C for 7 h [Table 3, entries 22–27]. This catalyst retained its catalytic activity in six subsequent runs with a slight decrease in the product of yield. However, its non-functionalized counterpart was only active for three consecutive runs. Also, the reduction in the yield after several recycles of the catalyst was due to the poisoning of the catalyst with the reactants or products and also leaching of the gold nanoparticles.178
Most of the above-summarized SBA-15-based catalytic systems provided a successful mechanistic pathway for the quantitative production of cyclic carbonates under metal-free and solvent-free conditions. Further, on comparing SBA-15- and MCM-41-based catalysts, both show good selectivity, conversion and yield towards the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide due to their high surface area, thermal stability and uniform interconnected pores, which provide enhanced interactions between the catalysts and reactants. Also, the catalytic activity of grafted MCM-41- and SBA-15-based materials is strongly influenced by factors such as pore diameter, concentration of active species and morphology. Nevertheless, the use of SBA-15-based material supports instead of MCM-41-based materials provide more stable catalysts due to the pore diameter of ca. 6 nm and larger wall thickness of SBA-15 compared to MCM-41-based materials. The presence of small tubular pores in MCM-41 with two openings often restricts the accessibility to the surface inside the pores, which reduces the mass transfer between the reactants. Also, the accessibility to the internal surface is reduced when the small pore mouth gets blocked with loaded reactants. Furthermore, the thinner silica walls of a few MCM-41-based materials collapsed when heated at high temperature during reactions. Therefore, stability is one of the crucial challenges faced using this type of material. In this regard, the accessibility and stability are enhanced to some extent for SBA-15-based materials.
Furthermore, the reusability of the catalysts is dependent on the nature of the support and substrate. MCM-41-based materials as catalysts for the conversion of CO2 and epoxides exhibit maximum recyclability for up to six runs. In contrast, studies showed that SBA-15-based materials show better recyclability with a maximum of up to 10 runs compared to MCM-41 (Table 2vs.Table 3). In addition, with respect to the tabulated comparative studies of both catalysts for the cycloaddition reaction of epoxides and CO2, it can be concluded that MCM-41-based catalysts require relatively harsh reaction conditions in a few reports (high pressure of up to 50 bar and temperature of 140–150 °C) to successfully perform the reaction. Hence, based on the above-mentioned factors SBA-15 can be considered the better silica material. In the future, more catalytic active sites can be grafted in SBA-15-based catalysts through the incorporation of highly active functional groups, which can provide cyclic carbonates in high yield under mild reaction conditions. Hence, there is definite scope for the development of modified SBA-15-based catalysts under greener reaction conditions in the field of CO2 chemistry and other organic transformations.
5. Current status of CO2 fixation in cyclic carbonates through various functionalized and miscellaneous silica-based catalysts
This section presents several ionic liquid-functionalized metal and miscellaneous silica-based materials for the fixation of CO2 into value-added products. The functionalized silica-based materials are broadly categorized into four classes based on their functionalization with ionic liquids (ILs) including imidazolium, phosphonium, ammonium salts, metal-containing and miscellaneous silica-based catalysts and their use as heterogeneous catalysts for the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates.184,185 Each of these sections are reviewed and discussed, showing the functionalization of silica with different types of green and sustainable materials. In general, most functionalized silica-based catalysts show excellent conversion, selectivity and catalytic activities in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.
5.1. Imidazolium-based IL-functionalized silica catalysts
The application of silica-based materials functionalized by imidazolium-based ionic liquids has extensively provided suitable cooperative catalytic outcomes, resulting in their use as catalysts for the efficient formation of cyclic carbonates. In 2006, He et al. proposed a silica-supported ionic liquid [C4-mim]+[BF4]−/SiO2 catalyst for the solvent-free development of cyclic carbonates via the catalytic conversion of CO2 with epoxide under supercritical conditions. They successfully determined the effect of the reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure and time. This synthetic process represents a simple, ecologically safe, cost-effective route, where cyclic carbonate can be synthesized via a continuous-flow process, which could be a combined reaction and separated by only one integrated step. It was reported that the [C4-mim]+[BF4]−/SiO2 catalyst gave an excellent yield of 96% and >99% selectivity of cyclic carbonates under 80 bar CO2 pressure at 160 °C for 4 h [Table 4, entry 1]. The silica-supported ionic liquid provided high catalytic activity for the solvent-free synthesis of cyclic carbonates due to the successful immobilisation of the active species [C4-mim]+[BF4]− by the silica support. This heterogeneous catalyst could be easily recovered by filtration and showed good selectivity of 99% towards propylene carbonate without any loss in catalytic activity after four consecutive runs. The presence of an ionic liquid in the heterogeneous catalyst resulted in good ionic conductivity and catalytic activity and selectivity towards the cycloaddition reaction.186

In another work, Park et al. developed an immobilized imidazolium salt ionic liquid on silica catalyst, abbreviated as SiO2-Im-IL-imidazolium salt, as shown in Fig. 9(i). The SiO2-Im-IL-imidazolium salt was synthesized using the sol–gel method and used as a catalyst for the synthesis of allyl glycidyl ether and CO2 under solvent-free conditions. The SiO2-Im-IL-2 imidazolium salt catalyst provided 53.4% conversion, 90.5% selectivity and 48.32% yield towards allyl glycidyl carbonates under 8.6 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C after 6 h [Table 4, entry 2]. This catalyst could be easily recovered and exhibited good catalytic activity towards cyclic carbonates with slight loss in its activity when reused for over two times. Herein, the catalytic activity of the ionic liquids was dependent on their chain length, where Im-IL-1 had the shortest alkyl chain and showed the highest allyl glycidyl ether conversion. Also, the steric hindrance of the bulky alkyl chain length for the formation of active the intermediate complex between the Im-IL catalyst and allyl glycidyl ether during the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides played a role in the catalytic activity.187

Further, the same group demonstrated silica-grafted imidazolium-based ionic liquids (SiO2-imidazolium salt, IL-Zn-IMIS-Zn) as heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of allyl glycidyl carbonate via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with allyl glycidyl ether (AGE). The IMIS6-Zn catalyst showed 60.4% conversion, 93.4% selectivity and 56.4% yield towards allyl glycidyl carbonates under 7.579 bar of CO2 pressure at 110 °C for 3 h [Table 4, entry 3]. This catalyst exhibited constant stability for up to five consecutive runs without any loss in activity from the initial run. Additionally, the catalytic activity was improved by the zinc halide-combined complex catalyst bearing a Cl− anion. The textural properties of the silica support had a great influence on the amount of immobilized IL, the catalytic activity and the diffusion effects of the reactant within the support matrix.188 In another interesting report, Sun et al. developed the ionic liquid 1-(triethoxysilyl)propyl-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide ([Smim]OH), which was grafted on silica gel, [Smim]OH/SiO2, as shown in Fig. 9(ii). The [Smim]OH/SiO2 catalyst was used in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxide under solvent-free and mild reaction conditions. The [Smim][OH]/SiO2 catalyst good catalytic activity with 24% conversion, 100% selectivity and 24% yield towards propylene carbonate under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 4 h [Table 4, entry 4]. It was demonstrated that [Smim]OH was grafted on the silica gel by two or three covalent bonds, which exhibited good thermal stability and mesoporous structure. Therefore, the successful grafting of the silica gel support on the active component [Smim]OH resulted in high catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 under mild conditions without any additional solvent. Also, the ionic liquid concentration in the grafted ionic liquid influenced the catalytic performance.189
In 2011, Park et al. developed a series of carboxylic-acid-functionalized imidazolium-based ILs bearing different halide anions, namely, CILXes, which were grafted on the surface of silica gel. CILXes were treated as heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates through the catalytic addition of CO2 with epoxides, as shown in Scheme 10. They observed and evaluated the function of different anions (Cl−, Br−, and I−) in the catalyst through the FT-IR, NMR technique. It was reported that the reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, and time) had an effect on the selectivity and yield of the cyclic carbonates corresponding to the different catalysts. The CILBr-Si catalyst with 40 mmol epoxide under 16.2 bar CO2 pressure at 110 °C for 3 h exhibited 99% yield towards propylene carbonates [Table 4, entry 5]. The excellent catalytic activity was due to the presence of two carboxylic-functionalized imidazolium ionic liquids immobilized on SiO2. The –COOH group in the IL cation could expedite the reaction by providing acidic active sites for epoxide activation and exhibited a synergistic effect with the halide anions. This catalyst showed the highest activity, selectivity and significant catalytic recyclability after five runs.190

In another work, Zhang and co-workers synthesized 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromides confined in mSiO2 and ionic liquids, which were abbreviated as ILs (EmimBr@mSiO2) for the catalytic conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates with the minimum effective dose of ILs. They observed the high BET surface area of 239.2 m2 g−1 with the least amount of ILs. Among the different EmimBr@mSiO2 materials, 0.2EmimBr@mSiO2 showed the highest chemical shift based on bulk EmimBr, which means the strongest interaction within its confined space. The 0.2EmimBr@mSiO2 catalyst provided 97.3% conversion of ethylene oxide, 96.5% selectivity and 93.8% yield under 20 bar CO2 pressure and TOF of 126.5 h−1 at 120 °C for 3 h [Table 4, entry 6]. The higher catalytic activity was exhibited due to the better dispersity of the ionic liquid in 0.2EmimBr@mSiO2, which made the active sites more accessible to the reactants. Additionally, the XPS analysis and DFT calculations determined that the less confined EmimBr exhibited good dispersity (Si/Br = 25) and was more affected by the silanol groups in the confined space (Si–OH/Br = 8). This stabilized the EmimBr components and also compressed the cation and anion to bond more strongly. The proposed reaction mechanism suggested that the higher activity of EmimBr@mSiO2 than the bulk phases was due to the cooperative effect provided by the mSiO2 skeleton, following which during the catalytic reaction, the exposed Si–OH groups could activate the ring-opening of epoxides by forming hydrogen bonds. Also, the catalyst exhibited recyclability after use for five runs under the optimized reaction conditions.191
Very interestingly, Aprile et al. developed imidazolium-based silica microreactors (SImCat) as catalysts for the reaction of CO2 with various epoxides for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. These organic-inorganic hybrid microreactors provided 94.4% yield towards chloropropene carbonate with a high TON of 491 under 80 bar CO2 at 150 °C [Table 4, entry 7]. The morphology and structure of the catalyst were observed and analysed through various techniques such as 1H-NMR, TEM, SEM, and XRD. DFT studies proved that the hydroxyl group activated the epoxide through the hydrogen bond interaction in the initial step of the reaction mechanism. They characterised and analysed the presence of mesoporosity in the silica shell through the high-resolution TEM image, which revealed no substantial structural change in the silica framework with regards to both shape and porosity after consecutive catalytic cycles, as shown in the Fig. 10(i). In these five consecutive runs, after first run the catalytic activity of the material was reduced, and again the catalytic activity increased from the fourth run, which showed that the catalyst can be recycled. Also, the excellent activity resulted in high turnover numbers (TON) through several catalytic tests.192

In another report, Arai et al. synthesized imidazole-urea derivative zwitterionic nanocatalysts (denoted as Im-Si-X-φ, X: halogen, φ: silicon precursor molar ratio) for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. They studied the plausible reaction mechanisms for the Im-Si-I-φ catalyst through the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide under mild reaction conditions, as shown in Scheme 11. The model reaction of CO2 and epichlorohydrin with electron-withdrawing substituent provided 98% yield and 99% selectivity towards chloropropene carbonates with 7.5 wt% catalyst under 25 bar CO2 pressure at 110 °C for 4 h [Table 4, entry 8]. This catalyst exhibited high structural stability and could be separated through simple filtration and reused for four times without significant loss in its activity. Additionally, its catalytic activity was greatly influenced by the nucleophilicity of the iodine anion together with the synergetic effects between the high content of imidazole-urea derivative sites and nucleophilic iodine anion species.193

In another interesting report, Aprile et al. demonstrated the use of imidazolium-modified polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS-Imi) grafted on amorphous silica (SiO2), namely SiO2-mim-Cl, SiO2-mim-I, SiO2-mim-Br, SBA-mim-Cl and SiO2-decim-Cl, for the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates. Among the prepared catalysts, SiO2-mim-Br at 0.022 mol% exhibited the best performance in terms of TON, productivity, selectivity and 85% conversion into the desired product in 3 h. SiO2-mim-Br showed 85% conversion and >99% selectivity towards chloro propylene carbonates at 150 °C under 40 bar CO2 pressure for 3 h [Table 4, entry 9]. SiO2-mim-I proved to be the most active catalyst among the as-synthesized catalysts, which showed a weight loss of ∼2.7% through the recycling experiments and TGA profile. However, although SiO2-mim-I was the most active catalyst, SiO2-mim-Br was the most suitable for the reaction due to its higher stability after recycling compared to SiO2-mim-I. SiO2-mim-Br was recyclable for four successive consecutive runs. POSS-Imi grafted on amorphous silica (SiO2) and mesostructured SBA-15 also provided very high turnover numbers (TON) and productivity values of up to 7875 and 740 towards the conversion of CO2 into cyclic carbonates, respectively. Moreover, the high catalytic activity of the unsupported imidazolium-modified POSS was maintained through the proximity effect due to the increased local concentration of imidazolium moieties surrounding the POSS nanocage skeleton.194
Dupont et al. demonstrated SiO2-supported 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium halide (SBMIm.X: X = Cl, Br and I) materials. The SBMIm.X catalyst produced cyclic carbonates via the catalytic addition of CO2 with epoxide under mild reaction conditions. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)-imidazolium bromide, namely the SEPIm.Br catalyst, provided excellent selectivity and yields of up to 99% towards cyclic carbonates under 5 bar CO2 pressure at 80 °C after 0.5 h [Table 4, entry 10]. They observed and analysed the catalytic activity of the system through both batch and continuous flow systems. They found that the SEPIm.Br catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity due to the higher nucleophilicity of the anion surface. This catalyst showed good recyclability towards cyclic carbonates over five consecutive runs without any significant loss in its catalytic activity.195
Further, Aprile et al. synthesized a tri-functional heterogeneous catalyst by decorating imidazolium salts with alcohol functionalities, which were anchored on a porous support embedding Sn as a single site, acting as an acid centre. Three imidazolium-based solids bearing primary or secondary alcohols, namely, Sn-A-imi(I)-Cl, Sn-A-imi(II)-Cl and Sn-B-imi(II)-Cl, were obtained as catalysts for CO2 fixation with epoxides to form the corresponding cyclic carbonates. These catalytic materials were characterised using 119Sn, 29Si and 13C solid-state NMR and via N2-physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, ICP-OES and chemical combustion analysis. 29Si NMR showed the presence of a combination of overlapping peaks centred at ca. −110, −105 and −95 ppm, corresponding to Si(OSi)4 (Q4),119 and Sn NMR spectroscopy under static conditions showed the presence of one band centred at −680 ppm, thus confirming the insertion of Sn as a single site. Sn-A-imi(II)-Cl, Sn-A-imi(II)-Br and Sn-A-imi(II)-I provided 22%, 36% and 69% conversion, respectively, and >99% selectivity towards styrene carbonates under 25 bar CO2 pressure at 125 °C for 3 h [Table 4, entries 11–13]. Among them, the Sn-A-imi(II)-Cl catalyst showed good recyclability for five subsequent reactions. The isomorphic substitution of Si with Sn in the SiO2 structure actively provided Lewis acidic sites, which were required to activate epoxide. Furthermore, the Sn-A-imi(II)-Cl catalyst exhibited an excellent catalytic performance due to the presence of two co-catalysts (Lewis acid site and alcohol functionality), which might may induced a synergic activation.196
Recently, in 2020, Breitzke et al. synthesized imidazolium-based catalysts grafted on a mesoporous silica support through 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and Br–(CH2)n–Br (n = 2 or 4) [SILEt+Br− and SILBu+Br−] for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. They also observed and examined the ring-opening reaction for different SILBu+Br− conformers in the energy profile diagram of the pre-reactant, transition state (TS), and pre-product. The SILEt+Br− catalyst provided the successful conversion of 99% and >98% selectivity towards styrene carbonate with a TON of 509 at 110 °C for 5 h under 20 bar CO2 pressure [Table 4, entry 14]. DFT studies demonstrated the optimized structure of SILEt+Br− and SILBu+Br−, as shown in Fig. 10(ii)(a and b), respectively, which imparted the best position for anchoring the ionic liquid. They performed DFT calculation to determine the mechanism of the reaction, which also confirmed the influence of the hydrogen bonding and chain length of the linker on the transition state in the rate-determining step, as shown in Fig. 10(ii)(c). Based on the DFT studies, SiO2 with the corresponding SILEt+Br− modified ionic liquid chain was the most stable structure, which was used as the basis for constructing different conformational geometries with different hydrogen bond interactions and styrene oxide.197
In the same year, Siewniak et al. developed a series of immobilized imidazolium-based ionic liquids, [mtespim]Cl/@SiO2, for the synthesis of styrene carbonate from CO2 and styrene oxide. Further, they successfully explained the effect of reaction parameters such as temperature, CO2 pressure and reaction time on the synthesis of styrene carbonate from CO2 and styrene oxide under 0.13 mol SO, 0.5 mol% of [mtespim]Cl/@SiO2, and 0.1 mol% of ZnBr2 at 700 rpm. The [mtespim]Cl/@SiO2 catalyst showed 82% conversion of styrene oxide and 75% yield towards styrene carbonates under 10 bar CO2 at 110 °C for 4 h [Table 4, entry 15]. This catalyst maintained its activity and selectivity for two cycles, but the loss in catalytic activity in the fourth cycle was observed due to the partial release of the catalyst and the deposition of side-products on the catalyst.198 In another work, Pescarmona et al. prepared a multi-layered covalently supported ionic liquid phase (mlc-SILP) using different bis-vinyl imidazolium salts on thiol-functionalized silica for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the conversion of CO2 with epoxide. This reaction progressed via the supported imidazolium-based ionic liquids with Br− and I− as halides, which acted as a nucleophile. Among the synthesized mlc-SILP materials, SiO2-octane-I showed the best catalytic activity in the conversion of CO2 with epoxide. It was observed that the mlc-SILP of SiO2-octane-I as the catalyst showed excellent selectivity of >99%; however, only 37% conversion towards cyclic carbonates under 80 bar CO2 pressure at 150 °C for 3 h [Table 4, entry 16]. The reusability of a selected mlc-SILP catalyst, SiO2-octane-I, was examined through five consecutive runs of the reaction of styrene oxide with CO2.199 Additionally, the higher catalytic activity was attributed to the presence of the I− anion in the catalytic system, which exhibited coordination ability, balance between nucleophilicity and good leaving ability. The most promising catalysts achieved an excellent turnover number and productivity compared to the state-of-the-art supported ionic liquid catalysts for the conversion of CO2 and epoxides into cyclic carbonates.
In 2019, Park et al. prepared ionic liquid-functionalized mesoporous silica (IFMS) as heterogeneous catalysts via the coupling of 1-(triethoxysilylpropyl)-3-n-alkylimidazolium halides with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) through template-free condensation under strong acidic conditions. They performed comparative studies on different IFMS categories such as n-BImBr-SiO2, n-BImI-SiO2, n-PImBr-SiO2 to determine their physicochemical properties and the effect of the reaction parameters such as temperature, time and co-catalyst. These materials were used as heterogeneous catalysts for the conversion of CO2 and epoxides under solvent-free conditions. Allyl glycidyl ether was used as the model substrate, where 99.1% conversion, 92.5% selectivity and 91.6% yield towards allyl glycidyl carbonates were observed at 110 °C, 35.5 bar of CO2 pressure for 6 h in the presence of n-BImBr-SiO2 with ZnBr2 as a co-catalyst [Table 4, entry 17]. Also, this immobilized ionic liquid (Im-IL) on amorphous silica exhibited good catalytic activity without utilizing any solvents in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and allyl glycidyl ether. The n-BImBr-SiO2 catalyst acted as the best catalyst and could be separated by filtration and recycled for at least up to three consecutive runs with slight loss in its catalytic activity and selectivity.200
5.2. Ammonium-based ILs functionalized silica catalysts
In 2006, He and co-workers demonstrated silica-supported tetra-n-butylammonium bromine (n-Bu4NBr/SiO2) for the synthesis of propylene carbonate from propylene oxide and CO2 under supercritical conditions. This catalyst provided >99% selectivity and 98% yield towards glycidyl phenyl carbonates under 80 bar of CO2 pressure at 150 °C for 8 h [Table 4, entry 18]. They performed a comparative study on the effects of the types of cations and anions of quaternary ammonium salts and reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure and time. The silica-supported quaternary ammonium salts as heterogeneous catalysts could be easily recovered through the simple filtration method and reused for over four times with slight loss in their catalytic activity. The support silica gel played a considerable role in the synthesis of cyclic carbonate, which prevented the possibility of side reactions. Further, the catalytic activity was strongly dependent on the halide anion present in the quaternary ammonium salts. Among them, n-Bu4NBr exhibited the best catalytic activity due to its nucleophilicity and better leaving ability of the halide anion.201
In another work, Leitner et al. synthesised cyclic carbonates via the coupling reaction of CO2 with oleochemical epoxides in the presence of the classical ammonium halide catalyst TBA-Br together with ((n-C7H15)4-N)5[CrSiW11O39], abbreviated as THA-Cr-Si-POM. This catalyst exhibited excellent yield and selectivity towards the majority of epoxide groups with high conversion of 95%, 98% selectivity and 93.1% yield towards cyclic carbonates under 117 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 6 h [Table 4, entry 19]. They performed and studied the complexity arising from the different catalytic functions and their interaction with different substrates. This study showed the synergistic pathway for the combined catalyst system, which indicated that the two catalysts play a different mechanistic role in the reaction. Additionally, the catalytic performance was governed by the nucleophilicity and leaving group ability of the halide anion present in the TBA-Br standard catalyst and the stabilising effect of the counterion.202
Ionic liquid-functionalized silica-based catalysts have been promoted as better catalytic alternatives for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. This is due to their higher catalytic activity compared to other types of catalysts. Most of the studies showed that silica functionalization is highly efficient for the cycloaddition reaction. These catalytic systems showed recyclability for up to five consecutive runs. However, most of the silica-based catalysts showed conversion and selectivity under harsh reaction conditions. In future studies, there is the possibility to generate a greener solvent for functionalized silica catalysts with more optimized reaction conditions in the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. A greener path to effectively prepare low-cost silica-based catalysts is also promising for the development of other sustainable materials.
5.3. Miscellaneous IL-functionalized silica-based catalysts
In 2005, Han et al. developed an ionic liquid (IL) choline chloride/urea-supported (SiO2–CH/urea) catalyst for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxide under different conditions. They found that this catalyst provided 99% yield towards propylene carbonate without any co-solvents under the molar ratio of CO2:epoxide = 1.5–1.87 at 110 °C for 5 h [Table 4, entry 20]. This catalyst could be easily separated from the product after the reaction due to the insolubility of IL in the products. This catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity after five consecutive runs without any loss in its activity. The major reason for the high catalytic activity of this catalyst was due the synergistic effect of the cation and the anion of the IL.203 Further in 2011, Park et al. performed a comparative study between the catalytic performance of homogeneous and silica-supported ionic liquids (SSILs) in the cycloaddition of epoxides and CO2 under microwave irradiation by varying the reaction parameters. They confirmed that the catalyst showed good activity within a short period of time of 15–30 min under a low CO2 pressure of 9.7 bar. An appreciable 87.9% yield of propylene carbonate was obtained after 0.25 h of reaction with a power of 100 W [Table 4, entry 21]. The presence of a supporting ionic liquid on silica as a catalyst increased the selectivity towards the cyclic carbonate without losing its heat-producing ability. The nucleophilicity of the halide anion and the bulkier nature of the cation were responsible for the catalytic activity. Furthermore, due to the presence of silica and better activation by microwave irradiation during the reaction, the TOF values were higher for SSIL. This silica-supported ionic liquid catalyst showed recyclability for up to three times without any significant loss in its initial activity.204 The same group developed silica-supported ionic liquids as catalysts for the microwave-assisted cycloaddition of CO2 with phenyl glycidyl ether under solvent-free conditions. They compared the effect of various immobilized ionic liquid catalysts, which were prepared with different silica supports such as commercial and amorphous silica, SBA-15 and MCM-41. The reaction was performed with MCM-BImBr as the catalyst under 9.7 bar of CO2 pressure, 100 W at 140 °C for 6 h, which showed a higher phenyl glycidyl ether conversion of 61.7%, 64.5% selectivity and 39.7% yield of phenyl glycidyl carbonates than the corresponding microwave heating (9.5%) [Table 4, entry 22]. SBA-EImBr showed 90.5% conversion of phenyl glycidyl ether, 100% selectivity and 90.5% yield towards phenyl glycidyl carbonates under 9.7 bar of CO2 pressure, 100 W at 140–150 °C for 0.25 h [Table 4, entry 23]. It was observed that the microwave-induced reactions with large pore diameters (greater than 4 nm) of the IL catalysts immobilized on silica gave good catalytic activity, very high phenyl glycidyl ether conversion and high selectivity of PGC within 15 min of reaction time. Also, the good catalytic activity was due to the relatively large pore diameters (greater than 4 nm) within the IL catalysts immobilized on silica support.205 Further, Ghiaci et al. developed an immobilized ionic liquid (IL-3@SiO2) for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides. The TEM analysis of IL-3@SiO2 showed a clear image of oligomeric ionic liquid molecules coated with SiO2 and the FE-SEM image and EDX mapping of the IL-3@SiO2 catalyst were also analysed and studied, as shown in Fig. 11(a), (c) and (d), respectively. This catalyst exhibited 100% conversion and yield towards propylene carbonate with a TON of 1704 under 20 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C after 5 h [Table 4, entry 24]. The catalyst exhibited excellent reusability over at least five consecutive runs without any loss in its catalytic activity.206

In the same year, Ligabue et al. reported hybrid nanostructure titanate nanotubes (TNTs) functionalized with a silanized ionic liquid (TNT-[IL][Cl]) as a catalyst for the conversion CO2 to cyclic carbonates. Different epoxides, namely, epichlorohydrin, styrene oxide, glycidyl isopropyl ether and propylene oxide, were tested for their catalytic performance. Among the tested epoxides, styrene oxide showed high reactivity due to its lower stability, as expressed by its HOMO–LUMO energy gap and NBO and confirmed using DFT studies. The TNT-[IL][Cl] catalyst was analysed and evaluated using various spectroscopic techniques, where TEM showed a clear image of agglomerates of elongated rods with nanometric dimensions of TNT and TNT-[IL][X] nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 11(b). The excellent catalytic activity shown by TNT-[IL][Cl] and TNT-[IL][BF4] with ZnBr2 as a co-catalyst for 2 h of reaction provided a TON of 35.6 and TOF of 17.2 h−1 for TNT-[IL][Cl]. Meanwhile TNT-[IL][BF4] showed a TON of 18.4 and TOF of 9.2 h−1. Additionally, the catalytic activity increased due to the presence of the co-catalyst ZnBr2, which acted as a strong Lewis acid and assisted in the activation of the epoxide. Moreover, nucleophilic attack of the halide anion assisted in the opening of the epoxide ring, and simultaneously affected the catalytic activity.207
In 2006, Sakakura et al. developed immobilized phosphonium halides on silica such as SiO2–C3H6–P(n-Bu)3X, where X = Cl, Br, and I catalysts, for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate via the conversion of CO2 with epoxide. It was found that the SiO2–C3H6–P(n-Bu)3I catalyst gave 100% yield towards propylene carbonates under 100 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 1 h [Table 4, entry 25]. They proposed the plausible acceleration mechanism through the acidic surface silanol groups that interacted and were activated with propylene oxide, which was attacked by a nucleophile to open the ring as shown in Scheme 12. Also, they confirmed that the excellent catalytic activity was due to the phosphonium halides covalently bonded to SiO2.208

5.4. Metal-containing silica-based catalysts
In 2005, Sakakura et al. developed tetraalkylammonium salts of transition-metal-substituted polyoxometalates such as [(n-C7H15)4N]6[α-SiW11O39Co] and [(n-C7H15)4N]6[α-SiW11O39Mn] as catalysts for the synthesis of propylene carbonates from CO2 and propylene oxide. They compared the catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts with the type of transition metal and the counter cation (Co2+ ≈ Mn2+ > Ni2+ > Fe3+ ≫ Cu2+; (n-C7H15)4N+ > (n-C4H9)4N+ > K+). The Co- or Mn-substituted catalysts such as [(n-C7H15)4N]6[α-SiW11O39Mn] and [(n-C7H15)4N]6[α-SiW11O39Co] exhibited 96% and 97% yield and 97% selectivity towards propylene carbonates without any additional organic solvents and additives under 35 bar CO2 pressure at 150 °C within a short reaction time of 2 h [Table 5, entries 1 and 2], respectively. Propylene carbonate was synthesized through the co-ordination of CO2 with the substituted transition metal, which attacked propylene oxide by activation of Q+ (tetra-n-heptylammonium or even the replacement of the transition metal of another silicotungstate), as shown in Scheme 13. Also, the enhancement in catalytic activity was due to the mono-substitution of tungsten(VI) with cobalt(II) or manganese(II) metal centres.209

 Scheme 13  Synthetic reaction mechanism of co-ordination of CO2 with substituted transition metal, which attacks propylene oxide by activation of Q+.209 
In another report, Carreon et al. performed a comparative study on the catalytic activity of the metal–organic framework Cu3(BTC)2 (BTC = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate), abbreviated as Cu3(BTC)2, vs. zeolites beta, TS-1, and HY, mesoporous silica SBA-15 and ZIF-8 for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epichlorohydrin to synthesize chloropropene carbonate. In the presence of SBA-15 as the catalyst, 10% yield towards chloropropene carbonate was observed without the use of a solvent and co-catalyst under 7 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 4 h. Also, the Cu3(BTC)2, ZIF-8, SBA-15 and zeolite beta catalysts showed ∼34%, ∼32%, 10%, and ∼82% yield towards chloropropene carbonate under the same reaction condition, whereas TS-1 and HY did not produce chloropropene carbonate [Table 5, entries 3–6], respectively.210
In 2015, Kholdeeva et al. synthesized mesoporous titanium-silicate Ti-MMM-E and Ti-MMM-2 heterogeneous catalysts via evaporation-induced self-assembly and hydrothermal synthesis. These catalysts were used for the one-step oxidative carboxylation of styrene with CO2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of the co-catalyst TBAB under mild solvent-free conditions (50–70 °C, 8 bar CO2 pressure). Between them, Ti-MMM-E showed better selectivity towards cyclic carbonates, giving 69–70% yield at 92–98.5% styrene oxide substrate conversion under 8 bar CO2 at 50 °C after 48 h [Table 5, entry 7]. The catalyst could be easily recovered through filtration and reused several times without any significant deterioration in its catalytic performance. Additionally, a high styrene carbonate yield of 1.1 kg L−1 was obtained after seven reuse cycles.211 Further, Li et al. developed a mesoporous titanium silica material containing polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), namely Ti-mSiO2, through a facile hydrothermal method for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the chemical fixation reaction of CO2 without a co-catalyst. They studied the kinetics and obtained a TOF of 76.2 h−1 on the Ti-mSiO2 (C) catalyst. This catalyst showed 96.5% conversion of epichlorohydrin, 95.0% selectivity and 91.6% yield towards chloropropene carbonates under the optimal conditions of 120 °C, 16 bar CO2 pressure for 6 h [Table 5, entry 8]. The CO2-TPD technique was used to investigate and characterise the presence of basic sites and calculate the amount of accessible basic sites in the samples. Ti-mSiO2 (C) exhibited excellent catalytic activity due to the synergetic effects of PDDA and the Ti framework. The Ti-mSiO2 material after calcination showed no effect in the conversion of epichlorohydrin. This suggested that the –OH groups on the surface of Ti-mSiO2 have no active effect on the CO2 cycloaddition reaction. This catalyst exhibited easy recoverability and excellent reusability for four runs without loss in its catalytic activity, exhibiting above 90% conversion towards epichlorohydrin and around 95% selectivity towards cyclic carbonates.212

5.4.1. Metal halide-supported silica-based catalysts. 
In 2006, Xia et al. synthesized 1-propyl-3-n-butylimidazolium bromide groups bonded to surface silicon atoms [immobilized ionic liquid]–ZnCl2 as a catalyst to produce propylene carbonate via the coupling CO2 and propylene oxide. Additionally, this catalytic system provided >98% selectivity and 90% yield towards 1,2-butylene carbonate without any additional co-solvent and high TOF under 15 bar CO2 pressure at 110 °C after 1 h [Table 5, entry 9]. Upon increasing the amount of SiO2 for surface bonding with 1-propyl-3-n-butylimidazolium bromide to more than 1.0 g, the reactivity increased slightly. The catalyst could be reused at least for up to two runs followed by slight loss in its catalytic activity due to the loss of zinc from the catalytic system.213 Similarly, González et al. synthesized ruthenium supported on SiO2, abbreviated as RuCl3/SiO2, for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. In this report, the reaction was carried out by the metal transition halides such as RuCl3 or RuCl3–SiO2 catalysts through insertion of the catalyst in the oxirane ring-opening coupled with CO2. This catalyst provided 73% conversion by the insertion of CO2 into cyclic bis-carbonate under normal pressure or supercritical conditions at 70–80 °C for around 3 h [Table 5, entry 10]. The coordination of ruthenium with SiO2 enabled the easy release of a chloride ligand by enhancing the concentration of the nucleophilic anion chloride in the reaction media. Also, the dispersion of RuCl3 on the SiO2 surface increased the number of catalytically active surface sites, which increased the catalytic activity.214
Recently, Hu et al. developed two novel multifunctional periodic mesoporous organosilica-supported benzo triazolium ionic liquids, namely PMO-ILTiCl5 and PMO-ILSnCl5. Both catalysts were used for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides, where PMO-ILTiCl5 provided a better yield of 99% and selectivity of >99% towards cyclic carbonates under 12 bar of CO2 at 90 °C for 2 h [Table 5, entry 12]. They studied the reaction based on the reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure and time. The presence of a large number of available catalytic sites from the hydroxyl active sites of PMO and the functional groups of IL helped to accelerate the interaction of CO2 with epoxide via the intramolecular synergistic effect. They studied and observed the reaction mechanism based on the possible mechanism of the synergistic activation process, as shown in Scheme 14. PMO-ILTiCl5 was easily recycled and reused for at least five consecutive runs without loss in its catalytic activity. This was due to the presence of an intramolecular synergistic effect between the active hydroxyl sites and highly nucleophilic TiCl5. Also, this gave sufficient stable sites in the catalytic conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates.215

5.4.2. Metal complex-functionalised silica-based catalysts. 
Xia et al. synthesized immobilized manganese–salen complexes covalently bound to the surface of silica as a support for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. The covalently immobilized catalyst (Mn(salen)Br) was employed as catalyst 2, which was coordinated to an aminopropyl group to the silica support, and catalyst 3 was covalently bonded to the silica support by anchoring functional groups attached to the ligand, as shown in Fig. 12(i). Catalyst 2 and catalyst 3 showed 6.2% and 95% yield towards styrene carbonate under a TOF of 196 h−1 using 27 g CO2 at 140 °C for 3 h [Table 5, entries 13 and 14], respectively. In the absence of a halide source such as (Et)4NBr, the catalytic activity dropped drastically after one run. Catalyst 3 exhibited higher leaching resistance compared to catalyst 2, and thereby the catalytic activity of catalyst 2 was lost after immobilization via anchoring coordinating amino-ligands. Catalyst 3 exhibited a better performance and reusability with TOFs between 196 and 255 h−1, which were in the range of the homogeneous catalyst Mn(salen)Br.216

In 2011, North et al. demonstrated and analysed the chemical cost analysis for the synthesis of bimetallic aluminium complexes, namely [(salen)-Al]2O or [(acen)Al]2O. The bimetallic aluminium complexes consisted of a 1–5 complex, which included bis[(1R,2R)-N,N′-bis(3,5-di-tert butyl-salicylidene) cyclohexane-1,2-diamino aluminium(III)]oxide as complex 1, bis[N,N′-bis(3-tert-butyl-5-(N-benzyl-N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)salicylidene ethane-1,2-diamino aluminium(III))]oxide tetrabromide as complex 2 [one-component catalyst system], silica-supported immobilized catalyst as 3 and 4, and bis[N,N′-bis(4-oxy-pent-3-ene-2-ylidene) ethane-1,2-diamino aluminium(III)] oxide acne as complex 5, as shown in Fig. 12(ii). The bimetallic aluminium complexes were used for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the conversion of CO2 with terminal epoxides under mild reaction conditions. The silica-supported bimetallic aluminium 3 and 4 complexes provided 89% and 84% yield towards propylene carbonate using benzyl bromide under 1.01325 bar CO2 pressure at 26 °C for 24 h [Table 5, entries 15 and 16], respectively. The cost of the chemicals needed for the production of catalysts 3 and 4 could be reduced by 77% and 78%, respectively.217 In another instance, González et al. developed silica-supported bimetallic aluminium(salen) complexes bearing pendant quaternary ammonium groups, as shown in Fig. 12(iii). The silica-supported bimetallic aluminium(salen) complexes were used for the conversion of CO2 with epoxides into cyclic carbonates using batch and gas-phase flow reactors. It was found that the catalyst lifetime was affected by the silica support and high back pressures were provided through the optimal silica size, which was found to be round 75 μm. The catalysts supported on Fluorochem and Merck silicas with small particle sizes (15–60 mm) provided 60% and 64% conversion of propylene oxide, respectively, under 1 bar CO2 pressure at 100 °C for 24 h [Table 5, entry 17].218


5.4.3. Metal oxide-grafted silica-based catalysts. 
In the same year, Baiker et al. produced zinc-based catalysts (ZnO–SiO2 materials) for the synthesis of propylene carbonate via the conversion of CO2 with propylene oxide using TBABr as a co-catalyst. In the presence of TBABr as a co-catalyst, the ZnO–SiO2 material gave >99% yield and 100% selectivity towards propylene carbonates under 45 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C after 6 h [Table 5, entry 18]. The ZnO–SiO2 material as a catalyst was synthesized and studied via a one-step flame spray pyrolysis method, which was shown to be a good-performance catalyst without any work-up procedure and good synthetic method for the synthesis of high-surface area materials. The catalyst was characterized and analysed using X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), TEM spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), as shown in Fig. 13. Additionally, the higher catalytic activity was due to the deposition of zinc on the silica support during the flame synthesis processes.219

In another work, Chen et al. demonstrated core-double-shell microsphere [Fe3O4@SiO2@Zn(Por)OP], which was prepared by coating a core–shell composite of Fe3O4 magnetic core and SiO2 shell (Fe3O4@SiO2) on a zinc porphyrin-based organic polymer [Zn (Por)OP]. The Fe3O4@SiO2@Zn(Por)OP catalyst was used for the synthesis of propylene carbonate via the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide. The Fe3O4@SiO2@Zn(Por)OP catalyst provided 97% yield of propylene carbonate with KI as a co-catalyst under 30 bar of CO2 pressure at 120 °C after 2 h [Table 5, entry 19]. The catalyst could be easily recycled from the reaction mixture through magnetic separation and showed no significant loss in catalytic activity after sixteen consecutive cycles. Nitrogen elemental analysis showed that the nitrogen content of the catalyst used in the second run was found to be 2.3%, and subsequently the reduction in the catalytic activity observed was due to the loss of zinc. Additionally, the co-catalyst such as KI and TPPB enhanced the catalytic activity of the catalyst due to its strong nucleophilicity and good leaving group ability. Also, the combinations of SiO2@Zn (Por)OP, Zn(Por)OP hollow microspheres and Fe3O4@SiO2@Zn(Por)OP with KI as a co-catalyst showed similar catalytic activity in terms of propylene carbonate yield (95–97%).220
Recently, Rai and co-workers developed a melamine-functionalized silica-coated iron oxide material, abbreviated as FSNM, for selective CO2 capture and its catalytic conversion into various value-added products. The FSNM catalyst was synthesized through the covalent grafting of the melamine group in the pores of mesoporous silica-coated Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@SiO2) particles by utilizing isocyanate as a cross-linker. The FSNM catalyst exhibited the conversion of various epoxide in the presence TBAB co-catalyst under ambient and solvent-free conditions. The FSNM catalyst with TBAB as the co-catalyst showed ≥99% conversion of butylene oxide under 1 bar CO2 pressure at 30 °C for 24 h [Table 5, entry 20]. Due to its high conversion, low catalyst loading, and facile reaction conditions, FSNM was proven to be a superior catalyst towards various epoxide substrates compared to the previously reported amine-based catalysts. The FSNM catalyst was easily retrieved from the reaction mixture due the presence of a magnetic core. FSNM showed recyclability for up to five cycles under the same optimised reaction conditions.221


5.4.4. Assorted silica-based catalysts. 
In another report, a highly active heterogeneous silica-supported polyvinyl pyridine (PVP/SiO2) base catalyst was reported by Bhanage and co-workers for the chemical fixation of CO2 with epoxide. Polyvinyl pyridine (PVP) was synthesized through the heterogenization of novel homogeneous base catalysts, which was supported on high-surface area silica, exhibiting a strong influence on the yields of propylene carbonates from CO2 and propylene oxide. The use of silica as a support for the PVP catalyst led to an enhancement in the number of basic sites exposed to the reactant. This prepared catalyst was characterised and analysed using IR spectroscopy, XRD, 1H NMR, and BET and the effects of various reaction parameters such as temperature, CO2 pressure, time and surface area of silica were studied. The catalyst provided 91% yield of propylene carbonate under 55 bar CO2 pressure at 150 °C for 6 h [Table 5, entry 21] and good catalytic activity and selectivity for five consecutive recycles, which was dependent on the active basic sites available for the reactant. Additionally, it was observed that the catalytic activity was enhanced with an increase in the PVP loading from 2.5 wt% to 10 wt%.222
Further, Sakthivel et al. developed amine-functionalized chabazite (CHA)-type silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-34) materials for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides in liquid-phase media. They characterized and analysed the functionality, morphology and structure of different concentrations of organoamine functionalized samples, namely, S-34-0.24N, S-34-0.32N, S-34-0.40N, and S-34-0.64N, through different analytic techniques. It was observed that the S-5-0.64N catalyst possessing surface-exposed amine functional groups showed 98% conversion, 96% selectivity and 94% yield towards chloropropene carbonate under 6 bar CO2 pressure at 85 °C for 5 h [Table 5, entry 22]. They executed the plausible mechanisms for the cycloaddition of CO2 on epoxide using the organoamine-functionalized SAPO-34 framework (S-34-xN) through three steps including the absorption of epoxide on its surface and protonation of the ring, leading to ring opening, as shown in Scheme 15. They also observed the good conversion of 84% and 94% selectivity towards cyclic carbonates in the fourth recyclability of the S-34-0.64N catalyst by using epichlorohydrin as the substrate. Additionally, the uniformly distributed mono-amine-functionalized (S-34-0.64N) material showed better catalytic activities due to its small particle size compared to S-37-0.64N and S-5-0.64N.223
 Scheme 15  Reaction mechanism for the cycloaddition of CO2 on epoxide using organoamine-functionalized SAPO-34 framework (S-34-xN).223 
In 2019, Kim et al. reported the synthesis of metal- and halide-free silica-supported alkanolamines such as polymer-type multifunctional alkanolamine supported on silica, abbreviated as PDO/silica. The PDO/silica catalyst was used for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides. Multifunctional alkanolamine catalysts can facilitate the ring-opening of epoxide by bringing amine-bound CO2 in close proximity through strong binding of the hydroxyl group with epoxide. PDO/silica showed 72% yield and 99.5% selectivity towards propylene carbonate under 10 bar CO2 pressure at 120 °C for 3 h [Table 5, entry 23]. The catalyst could be reused for five cycles without prominent loss in its catalytic activity. Additionally, the higher magnification SEM images showed the surfaces of the fractured silica-supported catalyst with a large amount of particles, which could possibly enhance the surface tension beyond the critical limit, thereby causing particle fragmentation. Also, this enhanced the catalytic activity by facilitating the access of the reactants to the surface-active sites.224

6. Outlook on different silica-based materials
The current discoveries and substantial progress made towards the development of more robust modified silica-based heterogeneous catalysts for the fixation of CO2 were covered in this review article. The following important information concerning modified silica-based catalysts can be comprehended with the help of this review, which is based on the recent literature over the last decade. The most highlighting factor of the articles covered in this review article is the studies on recyclability, which can potentially curtail the amount of catalytic waste and reduce the processing cost. We also signified the role of morphology, surface area, and porosity in defining the catalytic activity of modified silica-based catalysts under four different classifications. The major challenges that still need to be overcome with a lot of heterogeneous catalysts, in general, include obtaining good conversion and reasonable selectivity and yields under milder reaction conditions. Thus, this section focuses on prospective approaches for the future modification of already reported and development of new silica-based materials with the idea of enhancing their efficiency and activity for different applications, as shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Future applications of different modified silica-based materials. 
Besides the general considerations, among the four different categories of modified silica-based catalysts, a few silica systems show superior performances. Especially, with their capability to form strong chemical interactions with active sites and high dispersion of active metallic, metal oxides, organometallic and other organic species, DFNS- and KCC-1 based catalysts play a remarkable role in CO2 fixation reactions. Further, the accessibility of their active sites from all sides and radially oriented pores compared to the tubular pores of MCM-41 silica and SBA-15 silica is the major point for their distinctiveness. Therefore, without blocking the porous channels, they can enhance the loading of active sites such as metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, organic component and/or other guest molecules such as polymers, enzymes, proteins, and peptides.
Specifically, for selective catalysis, DFNS has been loaded with various noble metal nanoparticles for different nanocatalytic transformations such as hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions,225,226 reduction reactions,227 and CO oxidation.228 Interestingly, DFNS can also be modified into solid acid catalysts and base catalysts for various industrial processes such as hydrocracking reactions,229,230 CH4 formation,231 fructose dehydration,232 and cyclization reactions,233 and as Fenton-catalysts for the degradation of waste-water pollutants.234 However, for the extensive industrial and large-scale applications of these materials, new catalyst design attempts should be made to prepare stable, less-time consuming, greener materials by using cost-effective and abundant non-noble or transition metal configurations or substitute metals with greener alternatives to form sustainable and environmentally benign systems.
DFNS can further be used as a hard template for the development of carbon materials with fibrous morphologies by using different plant-based or seaweed-based carbon sources to achieve high surface area for various environmental applications.235 They can also be used as excellent adsorbents; however, suffer from textural disadvantages due to their high amine loadings, and hence require improvements to make more stable adsorbents for different gas capture and environmental applications. Further, they can also be modified to develop next-generation single-atom molecular catalysts. Owing to its wide pore size distribution and 3D accessibility of its inner surface, DFNS is also a promising material for the encapsulation of enzymes to develop biocatalytic systems.115 It can also be used to synthesize novel photocatalytic systems due to its enhanced charge separation, mass-transport, and light harvesting properties and can be actively employed for applications such as water splitting,109 dye-sensitized solar cells,236 and dye-degradation.115 Besides energy-harvesting, DFNS-coated spherical carbon has also been utilized for different energy storage applications. Furthermore, besides selective catalysis and environmental and energy applications, pure and magnetic immobilized materials have also been used for different biomedical applications such as controlled in vitro drug release,237 DNA loading, gene-delivery,238 ayurvedic treatment, and therapeutics.239 Further, with an enhancement in stimuli response, drug carriers with poor water solubility can be delivered to cancerous target cells by varying their pore sizes. In future, more focus should be given towards controlling the synthesis parameters to tune the physicochemical properties and understanding the formation mechanism of these materials for a better understanding of the role of solvents, surfactants and co-surfactants. This will enable the commercialization from lab-scale to pilot scale, leading to technology-transfer and relevance of DFNS. Furthermore, its scope of applicability can be widened to different disciplines such as particle imaging, plasmonics, photonics, coatings, sensing, electronics and smart devices.
In another classification covered in this review, to further broaden their applications in various fields, the ordered porous structures of mesoporous silicas, namely, MCM-41 and SBA-15 silica, must be modified because their silanol groups are considered to be inert in nature. According to the literature, different metal- and metal oxide-modified MCM-41 materials have also been actively used for Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions such as degradation of different dyes and phenolic compounds. They have been used as adsorbents for the removal of organic, inorganic and gaseous pollutants from different sources.240 Compared to bulk metal oxide, the MCM-41 framework has a large surface area, which allows metal/metal oxide species to be well distributed, and hence these materials promote photocatalytic water splitting and hydrogen storage reactions.241 With the inclusion of transition metals, promising results were obtained, although the reported hydrogen storage capacity of MCM-41 falls far short of the Department of Energy target of 5.5 wt%.242 Thus, more studies are needed to significantly improve its hydrogen storage capability. MCM-41 frameworks functionalized or embedded with organic groups can serve as better alternatives for energy applications such as fuel cells and light-emitting diodes by aligning with the principles of green chemistry. They can also be used for the co-assembly of MCM-41 or other mesoporous silica frameworks and polyelectrolytes with polymeric templates to generate a new class of silica-hybrid materials for different applications. Real-time sensors can be developed using mesoporous MCM-41 or other mesoporous silica-based materials, with the goal of creating smart devices with sensing capacities. For medical applications, magnetic nanoparticles implanted in silica shells have been proven to be effective in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic drug targeting. These materials are also used as heterogeneous catalysts for novel chemical and industrial synthesis, in addition to their environmental, health and energy benefits. Most of the reported functionalised MCM-41 materials for catalytic reactions contain organic functionalised groups. Therefore, the inclusion of other transition metal elements such as Al, B and Zr by replacing noble metal species in the silica framework structure and covalent attachment to the silica matrix or formation of ionic pairs can be a promising aspect.243–245 In another approach, MCM-41 can be functionalized and modified through co-condensation, where organic groups can be homogeneously distributed on the inner surface of the MCM-41 pores.
In another classification, notably, mesoporous SBA-15-based materials are widely used in numerous applications. They are actively employed for heterogeneous catalysis by using metal-doped SBA-15 for industrial processes such as methanolysis of styrene oxide and as biocatalytic systems for efficient enzyme encapsulation. They are also used in the energy sector as hard templates to control the aspect ratio of quantum confined nanowires and nanoparticles.246 Furthermore, the rapid development of silica-based electrochemical enzyme biosensors suggests their potential use in a variety of disciplines. Because of their outstanding catalytic activity, reaction stability, and recyclability, the industrial applications of SBA-15-based materials for pollution clean-up and gas-adsorption on a large scale is predicted in the near future.247 Nevertheless, the activity of these materials under natural sunlight has to be researched further, which will help establish the necessary knowledge for real-world wastewater treatment applications by replacing UV light and lowering costs.247 SBA-15 materials are also used to improve the bioavailability of poor hydrophilic drug molecules and phospholipid extraction from living cell matrices.248 Furthermore, the covalently attached functionalities sometimes completely desorb from the SBA-15 silica framework. Therefore, they can be developed for various biomedical applications in molecular sensing and stem cell tracking and clinical drug-delivery by overcoming the drawback of biodegradation.248
Further, SBA-15 can definitely be used as a template for the synthesis of functionalized catalysts with novel structural or electronic properties by incorporating or forming composites with active components such as metal oxides and/or carbon materials and POM heterogenization on previously functionalized SBA-15, through the introduction of amino groups, trialkylammonium moieties or selected ionic liquids, which can enhance the catalytic activity due to the size and confinement effects.249 Functionalization with metallic nanoparticles on the silica framework structure for the potential development of magnetic SBA-15 frameworks may also permit better separation and reusability of solid catalysts through the simple external magnetic field concept.250
Furthermore, in the still-emerging discipline of proteomics, functionalized silica-based colloidal crystal columns can serve as separators and detectors for nano-level analytical systems.251 Functionalized silica materials may also be developed by bridging the organic components between the porous channels and converted to electrospun nanofibers to make smart and ultra-sensing cloth, which can further find applications in warfare situations. They can also find application in regenerative medicine and bone tissue formation.248 Further development using silica-based materials and controlling their mechanical and chemical properties can result in their use in the regeneration of soft tissue, in vivo biosensing, and stem cell imaging.248
In the future, the development of more metal- and metal oxide-grafted silica-based materials with more accessible sites through the traditional impregnation and in situ incorporation techniques may enhance their reactivity. In addition, most of the reported reusable modified silica-based catalysts consist of metals in their structural backbone to enhance the activity during catalytic reactions. Therefore, the development of metal-free materials can enhance the connection between green chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis by avoiding the use of expensive and hazardous metals. Furthermore, very few recent reports suggest the development of magnetic metal-functionalized silica by simplifying the reaction technique and avoiding the use of excessive solvents. This approach has definitely established a strong link of silica-based materials with green chemistry for large-scale applications in other sectors. The formation of core–shell silica materials with a magnetic core for futuristic applications for both CO2-based reactions and other applications can prove to be an extremely beneficial factor considering firstly, the greater accessibility of the active sites in the substrate, and secondly, easy separation using an external magnet.
Besides magnetic silica-based catalysts, another interesting idea is the modification of organosilica-based materials because they inherently possess excellent porosity, thermal stability, functionalities and metallic sites, and sometimes do not require harsh and time-consuming functionalization steps.251 In another future aspect, hybrid silica-based catalysts or different silica composites can also be developed considering their large-scale application in different areas of research, ranging from the environment to energy sector. For example, porous silicas can aid in the anchoring of functional groups with different polymeric backbones through different chemical modification techniques and form stable materials. Additionally, different organosilanes can be used for chemical modifications to subsequently tailor and enhance the active sites in functionalized hybrid silica-based materials. Considering that no specific rules have been set to demonstrate the interactions occurring between the functionalities and silica framework, it is also of pivotal importance to focus on the easy availability of advanced characterization techniques such as XANES and XAFES for researchers to reveal greater insight and understanding about modified silica-based catalytic systems. These are only a few glimpses into what the future holds for research in silica chemistry. In a future outlook, the development of magnetically recoverable, metal-free, organosilica and dual natured silica-based catalysts, rationalization of their physicochemical properties, enhancing their biocompatibility and studying their action mechanism for the exposure of maximum number of catalytically active sites should be the focus. These factors will definitely gain momentum in the future for various other applications ranging from catalysis for CO2-based reactions to different sectors such as energy, environment and healthcare considering their adherence to the principles of green chemistry.
Based on the above discussion, it can be definitely concluded that mesoporous silica-based materials have undoubtedly added a new dimension to catalyst design. Especially, mesoporous silica, namely MCM-41 and SBA-15, with hexagonal arrays of regular channel-like structures have earned great reputation in the field of CO2 fixation reactions and other applications due to their outstanding attributes. However, MCM-41 and SBA-15 have large particle sizes (microns), and hence difficult to disperse in solvents. Additionally, the access to the surface inside their pores is limited due to their narrow tubular holes with only two openings, which presents considerable mass transport challenges. Furthermore, as the small pores become clogged with guest molecules, their inside surface becomes even less accessible. Because of their thin silica walls, which collapse when heated at high temperatures, these materials have another major challenge for applications in various fields, i.e., stability. Especially for CO2-based reactions, high-surface area silica materials with increased internal surface accessibility, configurable pore sizes and pore volumes, programmable particle sizes, and, most significantly, improved stability are required. Therefore, with regard to CO2 fixation reactions, the transformation of conventional mesoporous silica into fibrous mesoporous silica such as DFNS, is a critical approach towards the development of futuristic materials by making use of modern technology and greener synthesis methods. This is because DFNS shows enhanced physicochemical properties such as structure morphology, durability, basic property strength, and easy functionalization and existence of radial pores, owing to which reactants can easily access the catalytic sites present on its surface. Additionally, due to the fibrous morphology of DFNS after functionalization, it can also act as an efficient chelator, minimizing the leaching of active sites. Its applicability in the field of CO2 chemistry and other future applications has been already mentioned at the beginning of this section. However, more research into DFNS with respect to its synthesis under continuous-flow conditions and modification through confinement of active species can make the process more viable and gain more commercial importance.
7. Summary and concluding remarks
This increase in the number of publications in the last two decades on the topic of CO2 conversion into valuable chemicals, specifically cyclic carbonates, stresses its commercial and environmental importance. This topic provides an innovative platform for researchers to design catalysts that are greener and can effectively convert the main component of the greenhouse effect (CO2) into value-added products. The accessibility of high porosity, fibrous, high surface area and catalytically active sites of different silica materials has given a promising breakthrough in the field of CO2 utilization. Therefore, there is particular interest to design silica-based materials given that they contribute towards a combination of attractive properties such as highly tailorable structural, textural, morphological and compositional properties.
In the present endeavour, we tried to give evidence and review the available literature on the use of different silica modified catalysts, namely, DFNS, MCM-41, SBA-15 and functionalized silicas, for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide to form cyclic carbonates. Their catalytic performances were summarized, compared and also shown in the respective tabulated forms. The structure and morphology of most of the silica-modified materials were provided to relate to the discussion and improve the scope of readership. Additionally, a few other silica-based products were also reviewed for the sustainable synthesis of value-added products by CO2 conversion. Notably, the most prominent result was obtained using dendritic fibrous nanosilica due to its highly radial pores, fibrous morphology, high surface area and acid–base bifunctional centres. The high accessible surface area, highly porous, and fibrous morphology and the existence of acid–base bifunctional centres on the surface of dendritic nanofibrous silica play a pivotal role in the activation of reactants (CO2 and epoxides).
To design silica catalysts with more active and selective sites and cost effective synthesis processes, the recyclability of silica as a catalyst at the industrial level is the major challenge in the large-scale synthesis of cyclic carbonates. Consequently, the detailed outlook on future perspectives highlighted the design of cost-effective, highly active, metal-free, magnetically recyclable silica-based catalytic processes for the chemical fixation of CO2 and other applications in the environment, energy and healthcare sectors. We anticipate that the present endeavour will inspire new ideas amongst researchers to develop novel and catalytic systems using silica as a backbone under mild reaction conditions for the utilization of the greenhouse CO2 gas. In the future, these catalysts can definitely show promising scope for promoting greener and sustainable CO2 utilization and other applications.
