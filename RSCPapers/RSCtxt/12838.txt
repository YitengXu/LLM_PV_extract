    , Accepted 7th May 2019First published on 7th May 2019AbstractFor the application of α-CsPbI3 in optoelectronic devices, low-temperature processability and high environmental stability are critically important. Herein, we have grown a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer-wrapped highly stable cubic phase (α) of CsPbI3 at low temperature (60 °C) using a single step spin coating method. The optimal quantity of PVP critically facilitates precursor diffusion to form the desired phase at low temperature and concurrently renders stability to the phase. A photo-detector using a heterostructure of CsPbI3 and SnO2 on a flexible substrate is demonstrated, operating over the broad wavelength range 400–700 nm in a self-powered mode. The on/off photocurrent ratio of this self-powered flexible device is >103. The average responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of the device are around 100 mA W−1, 25%, and 1012 Jones, respectively. The noise current of our device is 15 pA Hz−1/2 under dark conditions (at 50 mV bias) at 117 Hz frequency. The rise/fall times of the photo-detector are found to be 5.7/6.2 μs, respectively; thus showing an ultrafast response. This self-powered flexible photo-detector shows very good stability even after 500 bending cycles.
Introduction
Semiconductor photodetectors have broad ranging applications in optical communication, telecommunication, security checking, consumer electronics, imaging techniques, industry, defense, and academic research.1–5 The desirable properties of an efficient photodetector include low dark and noise current, high responsivity, detectivity, and light on/off ratio, low noise equivalent power, and ultrafast photo-response.6 With rapid growth of the fields of wearable electronics and the internet of things (IOT), interest in flexible photodetectors is also growing rapidly.
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been intensely researched as highly promising photoactive materials for next generation optoelectronic devices due to their exceptional properties such as high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1) over a broad range of wavelengths, high diffusion length (>1 μm), band gap tunability by a mixed halide approach, and simple solution processability at low temperature.7–11 Unfortunately, these materials suffer from instability issues due to their property sensitivity to moisture, temperature and UV illumination.12,13 Moreover, there are still unresolved challenges like phase segregation in mixed halide hybrid perovskites under illumination.14 Some of these issues (thermal stability, moisture stability etc.) can be addressed differently in certain inorganic halide perovskites. As such, interest has grown in exploring their use in different optoelectronic applications including tandem solar cells with silicon.15 Amongst all the inorganic halide perovskites the cubic phase α-CsPbI3 is perhaps the most interesting candidate in this respect due to its significantly high thermal stability (>300 °C), and the right band gap of 1.73 eV, essential for tandem solar cells with silicon. The processing temperature to form the cubic α-CsPbI3 phase is >300 °C.15–18 However, it is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature and gets converted to the yellow non-perovskite δ-phase (2.3 eV).15,19 Unfortunately, the α-phase is also highly sensitive to moisture, getting converted to the δ form. Thus, it is a challenge to process the α-phase at low temperature and disallow its phase transformation at room temperature.
There have been several attempts to stabilize the α-phase of CsPbI3 using polymer functionalization, metal ion doping, organic molecule additives/surface treatment, hydroiodide (HI) addition, and mixed halide (Br/I) alloying.19–30 The mixed halide approach could stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3 but this increased the band gap to 1.92 eV due to the bromine content.18,31–34 Another approach to stabilize the cubic phase of CsPbI3 is by employing its quantum dot/nanoparticle form stabilized by using long chain organic ligands.35–38 However, this approach introduces a lot of grain boundaries due to small grains during the fabrication of devices, which reduce the charge transfer rate and increase the carrier recombination. Thus, to maintain the α-form for long periods under ambient conditions in real world applications is a real challenge.
The other black phases of CsPbI3 are the tetragonal (β) and orthorhombic (γ) phases, having distorted octahedra in a 3D configuration. These phases are metastable and are called perovskitoids. They occur during the transition of CsPbI3 from the non-perovskite δ-CsPbI3 phase to α-CsPbI3. The β and γ phases of CsPbI3 have been demonstrated in photovoltaic devices with a power conversion efficiency of 5% and 11% respectively.39,40 Recently, a α-CsPbI3 based solar cell has been shown to render a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17% wherein the cubic phase was stabilized using post-treatment of phenyltrimethylammonium bromide; but the stability of the devices was noted to be low in an ambient atmosphere.41
In the work reported here, we have successfully stabilized the cubic phase of CsPbI3 at a low temperature of only 60 °C by employing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) wrapping, using a single step spin coating process. The key was to use an optimum quantity of the PVP wrapper polymer as discussed later in the text. Facilitated by the low temperature process, we also fabricated a flexible photodetector using an ITO/SnO2/CsPbI3/Au configuration on a flexible PET substrate. This device operated in a self-powered mode, giving an impressive response in the broad visible region (400–700 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The on/off photocurrent ratio of this self-powered flexible device was around 103, while its specific detectivity was 1012 Jones. The noise current of our device was 15 pA Hz−1/2 under dark conditions (at 50 mV bias) at 117 Hz frequency. The rise/fall times of the CsPbI3 based photodetector were found to be 5.7 and 6.2 μs, respectively; thus exhibiting a fast response. Moreover, this self-powered flexible photodetector showed very good stability even after 500 bending cycles.
Experimental section
Chemicals
CsI (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), PbI2 (99.9%, Alfa-Aesar), polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich), polyethylene oxide, N,N-dimethylformamide (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethyl sulfoxide (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich), and SnO2 (15%, Alfa-Aesar) chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
A CsPbI3 solution was prepared by dissolving 259 mg of CsI (Sigma-Aldrich) and 460 mg of PbI2 (Alfa-Aesar) in a mixture of N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1 ml DMSO + 0.4 ml of DMF) with stirring in an argon-filled glove box. 50 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was weighed and dissolved in 1.35 ml of the above (CsPbI3) solution with constant stirring. A polyethylene oxide (PEO) based solution was prepared by dissolving PEO in the CsPbI3 solution.
Device fabrication
ITO-PET substrates were etched using zinc metal powder and diluted hydrochloric acid. The etched substrates were cleaned using sequential sonication in a soap solution, distilled water, and 2-propanol for 15 minutes each. The substrates were further cleaned using plasma cleaning in an oxygen atmosphere. A SnO2 solution was prepared by diluting commercially available SnO2 solution (15% colloidal dispersion from Alfa-Aesar) with distilled water in a 1:3 ratio. SnO2 was spin coated on the plasma treated substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds followed by annealing at 120 °C for 30 minutes. The samples were allowed to cool and were transferred to a glove box for perovskite deposition. The perovskite solution was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and heated at 60 °C for 5 minutes. Finally, gold was thermally evaporated on the top of the perovskite using a shadow mask.
Photodetector device measurement
We used a 300 W Xe lamp as a light source passing through a monochromatic unit to select specific wavelengths of incident light. The light on/off experiment was carried out by using a mechanical chopper. The I–V and I–T measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2612 meter. The power of the incident light was measured using a Newport power-meter. The power of the incident light was reduced by using neutral density filters.
Transient measurement
The transient measurement was done with various frequencies (100 Hz to kHz) and a LED light source with a wavelength of 500 nm (the rise/fall time for the LED is 14 ns) and the pulse width was varied from 30–100 μs. The device was operated in self-bias mode and the signal was recorded with the help of an oscilloscope. The frequency of the light was varied using a function generator.
Noise current measurement
The noise current measurement was carried out using a preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570). For the noise study, the current measurement device was kept under a −0.50 V reverse bias condition in the dark with a 0.1–1000 Hz frequency range.
Results and discussion
According to the previous reports, amongst all the α, β, and γ black phases of the CsPbI3 system, the γ phase occurs at low temperature around 60 °C, while β and α occur at 237 °C and 310 °C, respectively.42 The γ-CsPbI3 phase is a perovskite polymorph having high defect tolerance with a band gap of around 1.7 eV and crystallizes at low temperature. It can potentially be used for flexible optoelectronic applications, however its stability is a major issue, due to its high surface energy. Its sustainability has only been achieved by increasing the surface area by decreasing the size of the grains up to 100 nm.39
For making the thin films of CsPbI3 in our case, we initially used a solution of CsPbI3 (0.75 M) in a mixture of DMF–DMSO (without any polymer involvement). This solution was spin-coated on a cleaned glass substrate in an inert atmosphere and the films were heated at 60 °C. The films started turning from yellow to black within a minute. We noticed that the black films could not maintain their phase and converted to the yellow non-perovskite form even in an inert atmosphere within an hour. To check the structural form of the black phase, we performed XRD of the fresh sample instantly, with a polycarbonate dome XRD sample holder. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD of the CsPbI3 measured immediately after film preparation. The inset of Fig. 1(a) shows the polycarbonate dome of the XRD sample holder, containing the black coloured film. The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1(a) red curve) perfectly matches with the previously reported data for γ-CsPbI3 (i.e. the simulated X-ray diffraction pattern of γ-CsPbI3 using the CIF file of a previous report with the help of Vesta software).39,42,43 γ-CsPbI3 is formed at 60 °C due to the inter-diffusion of Cs ions into the PbI2 matrix.40 γ-CsPbI3 is the distorted orthorhombic form of the perovskite, as shown in the Fig. 1(a) inset, where the [PbI6]4− octahedra are tilted at an angle of 155.6°, lowering the symmetry. In the XRD of γ-CsPbI3, the peaks around 14°, 21°, 28°, and 42° are all seen to have split due to the distorted structure shown in the Fig. 1(a) inset. The lattice parameters for γ-CsPbI3 are as follows: a = 8.646 Å, b = 8.818 Å, and c = 12.520 Å, along with an angle of 155.6° for the Pb–I–Pb bond, and the space group is Pbnm.39,42,43

We performed an XRD measurement for the same sample after an hour, under similar conditions (in a polycarbonate dome). The color of the film turned from black to yellow as shown in the photograph inset of Fig. 1(b). The γ-CsPbI3 thus got converted to its most stable thermodynamic phase δ-CsPbI3 (space group pnma). According to a previous report, without any treatment/additive, γ-CsPbI3 is thermodynamically less stable than δ-CsPbI3, due to which the phase transformation occurs.39 The XRD of δ-CsPbI3, the crystal structure and the photograph of the film (inside the XRD sample holder) are shown in Fig. 1(b). The XRD pattern of the δ-CsPbI3 very well matched with the simulated XRD as well as that in a previous report.42,43 The XRD pattern was simulated from the previous reported CIF file.42
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has been demonstrated as a surface functionalization agent for CsPbI3 nanoparticles (NPs).24,44 During the nucleation and growth process of CsPbI3 NPs, the PVP molecule approaches the positive charge of CsPbI3 precursors with a long backbone chain having the electronegative acylamino group. With increasing time the PVP molecule wraps the CsPbI3 surface and stops the growth to form the nanoparticles.24 In their interesting work, Yin and co-workers24 used 10 wt% PVP in CsPbI3 solution and spin coated on the film. The film was then heated at 300 °C for 5 minutes. After cooling they dipped it in an IPA solution for 30 minutes to remove the redundant PVP. We realized in our experiments that use of a high concentration of PVP required higher temperature for radical diffusion and phase formation and post-heating removal of PVP led to lower than optimum conductivity. As discussed by Yin and co-workers,24 since PVP essentially wraps the grains via the electronegative acylamino groups, and protects and stabilizes the desired cubic phase, it is best to add a much lower quantity of PVP to achieve phase formation at lower temperature and good conductivity by skipping the step of removal of redundant PVP. This trick worked when we added about 3.5 wt% PVP into the CsPbI3 solution and spin coated the film with immediate heating at 60 °C. Interestingly, the films appeared black-brown in color within a minute. Most importantly, the films were found to be stable in ambient atmosphere for a long time without any phase change, perfectly suitable for growth on flexible polymeric substrates.
We performed an XRD measurement for the fabricated film and the result is shown in Fig. 1(c). It shows the XRD pattern for the PVP-CsPbI3 case (blue curve), simulated XRD of α-CsPbI3 (from the previous reported CIF file),42 a photograph showing the black film, and the crystal structure of the α-CsPbI3. Importantly, in this case, the XRD pattern reflects the α-CsPbI3 phase and not the γ-CsPbI3. There is no splitting of any peak of the XRD pattern of the PVP-CsPbI3 case, which reflects that there is no distortion due to the tilting of [PbI6]4− octahedra. This confirmed that the phase of PVP functionalized CsPbI3 is cubic. Interestingly, we achieved the α-CsPbI3 at a very low temperature of 60 °C with much better stability even under ambient conditions. For the nucleation process the Cs insertion and the corner sharing arrangement of the [PbI6]4− octahedra are important, which occur at 60 °C, while PVP stabilizes the cubic phase through the functionalization.
The XRD peaks of the PVP-CsPbI3 film case are broad, reflecting a smaller grain size. We calculated the crystallite size using the Scherrer formula, which is close to 15 nm. To study the effect of the processing temperature on the evolution of the PVP-CsPbI3 film, we heated the films with various temperatures over the range from 80 to 150 °C. The XRD patterns for the same films are included in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†). The XRD line width decreases with an increase in the processing temperature from 80–150 °C. This result reflects the increase in the crystallite size with increasing processing temperature.
We also examined another polymer functionality, namely polyethylene oxide (PEO), for the growth of α-CsPbI3 at low temperature. For this, we added PEO to the CsPbI3 precursor solution instead of PVP. The solution was spin coated on a glass substrate and heated at 60 °C in an inert atmosphere. Fig. S1(b) (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of the PEO-CsPbI3 case, which also shows the cubic phase CsPbI3. We however used only PVP-CsPbI3 for the optoelectronic study due to its high stability in ambient atmosphere as compared to PEO-CsPbI3. Comparatively, PEO is more hydrophilic in nature, and grabs water molecules and reduces the α phase stability.45
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were recorded for the evaluation of the morphology of the PVP-CsPbI3 films and these are shown in Fig. 2(a). The grain size of the perovskite is found to be around 100–120 nm. These grains are however seen to be formed by aggregation of the small nanoparticles, as reflected in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†).

To evaluate the size and the morphology of these aggregated nanoparticles, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging by scratching out CsPbI3 powder from the film. Fig. S2(b) (ESI†) shows the TEM images of the α-CsPbI3, where we found particles with sizes in the range 12–20 nm. The lattice fringes revealed an interplanar distance of 2.82 Å, which corresponds to the (210) plane.
To evaluate the optical response of the PVP-CsPbI3 films, we carried out an absorbance and photoluminescence study. The absorption band edge of PVP-CsPbI3 is seen around 700 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of 1.77 eV.
A time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement (Fig. 2(d)) was carried out to investigate the lifetime in the case of PVP-CsPbI3. The PL decay for the PVP-CsPbI3 film exhibits a time constant of τ = 33.5 ns. The PL decay curve was fitted with a tri-exponential function, and the parameters and the relative contribution data are included in the ESI† (Table S1). As per a previous report, as the particle size increases the lifetime increases.37
Since the PVP-CsPbI3 system has broad-band absorption in the visible region, a low film processing temperature, and a better carrier life-time, we decided to fabricate a photodetector based on this material on a flexible substrate. In this photodetector, we used ITO coated PET as a flexible substrate on which a hetero-junction of SnO2 and PVP-CsPbI3 was prepared by a solution process; and gold was deposited as the top electrode using thermal evaporation. SnO2 is an n-type semiconductor with high electron mobility and, according to theoretical study, CsPbI3 is a p-type semiconductor; hence the heterojunction was envisioned to serve as a photodetector.46,47Fig. 3(a) shows the schematic diagram of our device we performed dark and light I–V (sweep voltage from −0.5 to +0.5) measurements; the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3(b). Since the heterojunction of SnO2 and CsPbI3 is a p–n junction, it shows the expected diode characteristics. The I–V curve in Fig. 3(b) is like a p–n junction solar cell. The black curve is the I–V for the dark, and blue is the one under illumination. The device clearly showed a significant change under illumination with a 450 nm wavelength. Importantly, although PVP is an insulating polymer,45 its optimum use as one or a few monolayers wrapped around the semiconducting CsPbI3 nanograins renders desirable conductivity via a tunneling process, stabilizes the cubic phase, and also gives an impressive photocurrent. The breakdown voltage for our device was around −0.42 V (in the dark) under reverse bias. The breakdown voltage was −0.37 V for the photodetector under the illumination condition. The reduction in the breakdown voltage under illumination with light can be attributed to the reduction in the depletion width (enhancement in the carrier concentration in the depletion region upon incident light) of the p–n junction. As CsPbI3 has broad-band absorption with a band edge around 700 nm, it is potentially useful for broad-band photodetector applications. Interestingly the device shows a very good response even at 0 V, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The device thus works in a self-bias mode due to the appropriate band alignment, which is shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 4(a) shows current density (J) vs. time (t) of the photodetector under light on and off cycles at 0 bias, for different wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nm. Our device showed an exceptionally impressive photoresponse with an on/off ratio greater than 1.8 × 103 for different wavelengths in the range from 400 to 650 nm, at an intensity of light <70 μW cm−2. The light on/off ratio even for the near band edge wavelength of 700 nm is around 3 × 102.

The responsivity and detectivity are very important parameters which define the efficiency of the device in an actual application. Fig. 4(b) shows the responsivity and detectivity of the detector for different wavelengths. The responsivity was calculated using the following formula,48R = (Ilight − Idark)/(power density × area)The dark current of our device is 1.5 × 10−9 A, the power density for various wavelengths is included in the ESI† (Table S2), and the illumination area was 0.06 cm2. The responsivity and detectivity of the device were measured/calculated under the 0 bias (self-powered) condition.
Another important parameter for the photodetector is the specific detectivity, which can be calculated according to the following formula49D* = (R√A)/√((2q·Idark))where D* is the specific detectivity, R is the responsivity, A is the device active area, q is the electrical charge, and Idark is the dark current. Very interestingly, our device showed a specific detectivity around 1 × 1012 Jones (cm Hz1/2 W−1), which for the wavelength range of 400–650 nm is comparable with silicon-based photodetectors.50,51 The high specific detectivity of the PVP-CsPbI3 film based flexible photo-detector indicates that it can detect a very low intensity of light. Notably, in contrast to the case of the material and work presented here, it is very difficult to fabricate a Si-based photo-detector on a flexible substrate due to its high processing temperature and brittleness. The specific detectivity in our case was however somewhat less for the wavelength 700 nm, around 2.5 × 1011 Jones. The responsivity and specific detectivity mostly follow the absorption spectra of the active material. To evaluate the photoresponse of the device at minimum illumination power, we reduced the intensity of light further using neutral density filters from the range of microwatts to nanowatts.
The J–T profile as a function of the light intensity at a wavelength of 650 nm is shown in Fig. 4(c). The device showed around a one order of magnitude on/off ratio even under a light intensity of 43.5 nW. This establishes that our device gives almost a one order of magnitude photoresponse even with a few nW level of illumination. Fig. 4(d) shows the photocurrent and calculated responsivity as a function of the intensity of the light illumination. The photocurrent is seen to increase almost linearly with the increase in the intensity of the light, while the responsivity of the device is seen to slightly decrease. It follows the trend in perovskite-based photodetector devices as per earlier reports.51–56 The responsivity is seen to decrease from 160 to 106 mA W−1 as the intensity increases from 43.5 nW to 3.46 μW at a wavelength of 650 nm. This may be attributed to the degree of saturation of the photocurrent of the device at higher levels of illumination. The average responsivity of our device for the spectral rage of 400–700 nm is around 100 mA W−1.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) decides the probability of generating a charge carrier in the photodetector upon incident light. The external quantum efficiency can be calculated from the responsivity for a specific wavelength and the energy of the incident wavelength using the following relation,48EQE = Rhν/ehere R is the responsivity, h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of the light, and e is the electronic charge. We calculated the quantum efficiency for our devices and the result is included in Fig. S3 (ESI†) as a function of wavelength. The value of the quantum efficiency of our flexible device is quite decent, around 25% for the wavelength range of 400–650 nm in the self-biased mode.
The normalized equivalent power (NEP) is an important figure of merit of a photodetector, which decides the minimum incident optical power that the photodetector can differentiate from noise. Before evaluating the noise current measurement of the device we needed to measure the background instrumental noise. The instrumental noise current (i) is shown in Fig. 5(a) (blue curve) while the device noise current is denoted by the red color. The instrumental noise is 11 pA Hz−1 to 3.5 pA Hz−1 for the frequency range from 1 to 100 Hz. The device noise current for the same range of frequency is 200 pA Hz−1 to 16 pA. The instrumental noise current is much lower than the device noise, demonstrating that the measured noise is mostly from the device. From the measured noise current and the responsivity of the photodetector, we have calculated the noise equivalent power (NEP) using the following equation,48NEP = in/Rwhere in is the noise current and R is the responsivity. The noise equivalent power (NEP) for our device for the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm is included in Fig. 5(b) for a noise current of 15 pA Hz−1/2 at a frequency of 117 Hz. The NEP of our device is clearly very low in the range of 10−10 W.

The response speed of the photodetector is an essential factor for the detection of high-frequency optical signals. It depends on how fast the charges are transported and extracted towards the respective electrode after irradiation with the optical pulse. The transient measurement for our device was performed under 500 nm pulsed light (a pulse width of 40 μs) from a light emitting diode (LED) in the self-powered mode. The time calibration was performed by using a Si photodiode having a 1 ns rise time. Fig. 5(c) shows the normalized current as a function of time (I–t profile with time in microseconds). The rise time of the photo-detector was calculated by the time interval for the response to rise from 10% to 90% of its highest value, while the fall time was calculated by the time interval for the response to drop from 90% to 10% of its peak value. The rise time and decay time values for our self-powered flexible device are found to be 5.7 μs and 6.2 μs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c).
We compared the data for our flexible self-powered photo-detector device with previously reported photo-detectors based on inorganic halide perovskites, hybrid perovskites and other materials; the comparison is shown in Table 1.57–70 It can be concluded that our photo-detector has a fast response and high detectivity better than or at least comparable to most cases, in addition to its virtues of a self-powered mode and flexibility.

Theoretically, the 3 dB cut-off frequency is calculated using the following relation,48f3dB ≈ 0.443/τtrwhere τtr is the transit time of the device, which is 5.7 μs for our case. Based on the transit time the 3 dB cut off frequency can be calculated as 0.0759 MHz. The frequency response of the device was measured with a square wave voltage driven green LED (λ = 500 nm) and the generated photocurrent was measured using an oscilloscope. From the amplitude of the photocurrent recorded for different frequencies, we obtained the frequency response, which is shown in Fig. 5(d).
The experimental 3 dB cut off frequency for our devices is 0.077 MHz, which matches well with the calculated value (0.0759 MHz). For the real-world application of the flexible photo-detector, it should have good stability after bending cycles. The device performance with several bending cycles was therefore measured as a function of the photocurrent on/off cycles with respect to time, and the corresponding data are included in Fig. 6(b). The process of bending of the device is shown in Fig. 6(a) (I–IX). Interestingly the performance is stable after even 500 bending cycles as observed from the J–t profile of Fig. 6(b).
 Fig. 6  (a) Process followed for bending of the photo-detector over one complete cycle (I–IX), (b) J–t profile under light on and off under 0 bias for various bending cycles, and (c) stability of the device measured as a function of time (ambient with humidity above 80%). 
We studied the stability of our device under an extreme case (without any encapsulation under ambient conditions with humidity >85%) by keeping it under constant illumination with a solar simulator (intensity 100 mW cm−2) and measured the photocurrent at 0 bias for half an hour. The corresponding normalized photocurrent vs. time profile is shown in Fig. 6(c). There is a 40% reduction in photocurrent. The reduction in the photocurrent may be due to the halide vacancies moving to the respective electrodes and getting accumulated at the interfaces. This accumulation of charges creates a barrier for the photogenerated charges, thereby reducing the photocurrent.71–74 Clearly, with encapsulation the device can sustained for longer periods.
We also checked the structural stability of the PVP-CsPbI3 film itself by performing XRD of the fresh sample and after keeping the film for 15 days under ambient atmosphere. There is no change in the XRD pattern as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), which implies that there is no phase transformation from α-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated low-temperature film growth and impressive stability of the α-CsPbI3 phase by a single step solution process, using an optimized amount of wrapping PVP polymer as the surface functionalizing agent. This low-temperature process and high stability of the broad-band absorbing material enabled us to fabricate a photodetector based on a heterostructure involving this system with n-type SnO2 on a flexible ITO coated PET substrate. This self-powered flexible photodetector indeed exhibits a broadband detecting capability with high detectivity (1012), on/off ratio (103), and responsivity (∼100 mA W−1) over the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. The fast response time of a few microseconds of the device with good stability under 500 bending cycles reflects its potential for practical use as a low-cost photodetector for wearable devices.
