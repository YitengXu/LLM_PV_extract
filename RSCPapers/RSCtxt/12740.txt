    , Accepted 26th September 2012First published on 2nd October 2012AbstractSpinel LiMn2O4-based composites with cation (Li+)/anion (F−) co-doping and Li2MnO3 thin surface coating are synthesized by one-step solid-state reaction. The composites modified with body-doping and surface-coating exhibits excellent cycling performance and high rate capability. The LF04 sample tested at 1 C rate exhibits only 1.2% capacity loss after 1000 cycles at room temperature; and when cycling at 55 °C, the composite still shows 94.3% capacity retention after 100 cycles. As the charge–discharge rate increases to 7 C, the as-prepared LiMn2O4-based composites deliver more than 95.5% capacity retention after 300 cycles at room temperature and exhibit an average value of coulombic efficiency more than 99.6%. The improved cycling performance of the composites is ascribed to double doping in the spinel structure and the coating on the surface of the spinel particles. The ionic doping could eliminate the problems with cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion and suppress Li+-ion order at 0.5 Li; and the inborn Li2MnO3 coating containing only Mn4+ ions, could prevent the disproportionation of Mn3+ on the surface.
Introduction
The overuse of fossil fuels for energy releasing a large amount of gas emissions such as COx, NOx, SOx, results in severe environmental pollution and global warming. One way to solve the problem is to explore renewable clean energy such as solar, wind and tidal energies; another way is to use electric cars to replace internal-combustion engine cars to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency.1 Both ways require advanced energy storage and conversion system. Lithium ion batteries exhibit large energy density and high efficiency, which could meet the demands in theory.2,3 However, current lithium ion batteries using LiCoO2 as the cathode material cannot be used for large-scale power batteries or stationary energy storage due to its cost and safety.4,5
Spinel Li1−x[Mn2]O4 exhibiting a rapid Li extraction/insertion at 4 V (versus Li/Li+) is considered as a promising potential cathode material for lithium-ion batteries used for EV, HEV and PHEV due to its low cost, low toxicity, easy preparation and high safety properties.6–10 However, spinel Li1−x[Mn2]O4 has been plagued by three problems that contribute to a capacity fade on cycling: (1) at x = 0, the Mn3+ ion concentration is high enough for a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion in Li-rich regions; (2) an ordering of Li at x = 0.5 creates regions of x where two cubic phases coexist; and (3) surface Mn3+ ions undergo the disproportionation reaction 2Mn3+ = Mn2+ + Mn4+ followed by dissolution of Mn2+ into the liquid electrolyte.
To address the problem of a capacity fade of the spinel LiMn2O4, substituting a small portion of Mn ions with other cations11–14 and substituting O ions with other anions15–17 has been tried. Amatucci et al.18 and Jiang et al.19 report the co-doping of F− and Al3+, Li+ could improve the cycling performance of spinel LiMn2O4 by suppressing the instability of the spinel structure, which is caused by Jahn–Teller distortion and the ordering of Li+ ions. Coating the spinel particles with an electrochemically inactive material permeable to Li+ ions is also an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of the LiMn2O4.20–22 Lee et al.23 immerses the spinel Li1.1Al0.05Mn1.85O4 power into the aqueous solution containing Bi(NO3)3, nitric acid and NH4F to form BiOF coating on spinel particles by adding NH4OH solution. The coating enhances the cycling performance of the composites greatly by providing a protecting layer against side reactions on the surface.
Li2MnO3 that is considered as an inactive material when the voltage is less than 4.5 V (versus Li/Li+) has 2 Li+ ions in the formula,24 suggesting that Li2MnO3 could deliver better ionic permeability than other inactive materials without Li+ in the structure. Recently, through X-ray diffraction and electron spin resonance analysis, Julien's group declares that Li2MnO3 could be formed in Li+ heavily doped spinel LiMn2O4.25 However, the status of Li2MnO3 in the composites and its effect on cycling performance of LiMn2O4 has not been investigated clearly.
Based on the above analysis and considering the effect of co-doping of cations and anions, we use LiF as a doping raw material to synthesize Li+ and F− co-doped spinel LiMn2O4 composites with various doping content, expecting a second phase Li2MnO3 could be formed as a coating on the surface of spinel Li[LiyMn2−y]O4−zFz composites. We expect that, the modification of Li+, F− doping and Li2MnO3 coating could be realized during the process of synthesis of spinel LiMn2O4 active materials. This method is different from the traditional method in which the surface coating is usually prepared through two steps: first synthesizing the LiMn2O4 active material and second coating the spinel particles. The traditional way is an effective method to modify the surface to improve the active materials' electrochemical performance, but usually the coating is not uniform or compact. The coating of Li2MnO3 reported in our experiment is born with the synthesis of spinel active material. This inborn coating is thin, uniform and could provide an effective protecting layer to the spinel particles.
Experimental
The spinel LiMn2O4-based composites were synthesized by solid-state reaction. A stoichiometric proportion of Li2CO3, Mn3O4 and LiF corresponding to 1 mol LiMn2O4 + m mol LiF were mixed. The values of m were 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and the corresponding samples were marked as LF0, LF02, LF04, LF06, respectively. The mixture was wet ball-milled for 48 h. After drying, the mixture of starting materials was precalcined at 450 °C for 6 h. The obtained powder was reground for 2 h and finally calcined at 750 °C for 12 h followed by a furnace-cooled to room temperature.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were recorded with a PANalytical, X'Pert PRO X diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) by step scanning.
The morphology of the powders was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7000F, JEOL). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) was employed to characterize the surface of the prepared powders. The powder was ultrasonically suspended in isopropyl alcohol, and the suspension was deposited on a copper grid previously covered with a thin layer of carbon. The chemical composition was examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-EDX, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN, FEI).
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was recorded at room temperature with the KBr wafer technique in a Bruker Vetex70 FTIR instrument. The Mn and F relative content in the samples was determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF, S4 PIONEER, Bruker).
The Mn dissolution in electrolyte was measured. Each sample was immersed in electrolyte for 7 days at 55 °C. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) was employed to measure the amount of the dissolution.
For fabrication of electrodes, the prepared powders were mixed with carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (70:20:10) in N-methylpyrrolidinone. The slurry thus obtained was coated onto Al foil and then dried at 120 °C overnight in vacuum. The prepared electrodes were used as cathode and Li sheet as the anode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC):diethyl carbonate (DEC):ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) in a 1:1:1 volume ratio. The electrochemical test cells were assembled in a Mikrouna Super glove box under a dry argon atmosphere. Charge–discharge characteristics were performed galvanostatically with a cut-off voltage limit of 4.3–3.5 V (versus Li/Li+) in air with an Arbin Battery Test System.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the four samples. LF0 and LF02 samples show only the cubic spinel structure with the space group of Fd3m. However, LF04 and LF06 samples show the characteristic patterns of Li2MnO3 phase (JCPDS: 01-084-1634). The formation of Li2MnO3 phase is mainly due to the heavily doping of Li+ into the spinel LiMn2O4.25 As shown in the figure, the main diffraction peaks of the spinel structure shifts to a higher angle as more LiF is added, indicating a decrease of lattice size of the spinel.
 Fig. 1  Experimental powder X-ray diffraction patterns of spinel LiMn2O4-based composites. All the samples exhibit the cubic spinel phase with a second phase detected in LF04 and LF06 samples. 
The cubic lattice parameters of the spinel phase calculated from the diffraction data are shown in Table 1. As shown in the table, the cell size decreases with increasing m, which is mainly due to the LiF doping into the spinel structure to form a Li[LiyMn2−y]O4−zFz composite. The Li+ ions dope into the octahedral sites in the spinel structure, leading to the decrease in content of Mn3+ ion and the increase in content of the Mn4+ ion to keep the charge balance. The radius of the Mn4+ ion is smaller than that of the Mn3+ ion, so the decrease of Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio in the spinel reduces the lattice size.26 This effect is bigger than the opposite effect of the substitution of F− for O2− which would increase the lattice size by increasing the Mn3+ content. However, the lattice parameters change little in the two-phase region (i.e. from LF04 to LF06), indicating little additional ions doping into the structure when m increase from 0.4 to 0.6. Table 1 also shows the evolution of the F:Mn ratio in the composites as determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis; a considerable concentration of fluorine is lost during synthesis.

The micrographs of scanning electron microscopy exhibit the typical difference between the sample with and without LiF addition. The particles of the LF0 sample with a diameter of about 200 nm exhibit good crystallinity, while the particles of the LF04 sample shows much more pronounced grown facets with defined grain boundary, just as shown in Fig. 2. This is due to the characteristic of metal–halogenide fluxes, which suggests F ions are doped into the spinel structure to substitute O.27,28
 Fig. 2  SEM micrographs for the samples: (a) LF0 at low magnification, (b) LF0 at high magnification, (c) LF04 at low magnification, (d) LF04 at high magnification. 
The transmission electron microscopy images of the LF0 and LF04 samples are shown in Fig. 3. The LF0 sample exhibits no surface coating on the particles, just as seen in Fig. 3(a). However, there is a thin coating of Li2MnO3 on the particle surface of the LF04 sample (Fig. 3(b)). In order to investigate the surface of the modified samples with different LiF content, high-resolution TEM measurement is employed. As shown in Fig. 4, the LF0 sample exhibits obvious visible fringes, showing a well-ordered single phase and no impurity phase exists on the surface (Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) exhibits that the Li2MnO3 exists on the surface of LF02 sample in the form of patches. The impurity phase of Li2MnO3 existing as patches is not detected by XRD analysis mainly due to its low content in the composites. As seen in Fig. 4(c) and (d) responding to sample LF04 and LF06 respectively, as the LiF content increases, i.e., the increase of m, the content of the second phase Li2MnO3 increases obviously compared to that in the sample LF02; and the thickness of the Li2MnO3 increases progressively from LF04 to LF06. As seen in Fig. 4(d), the Li2MnO3 surface coating exhibits good crystallinity, and the measured separation between the fringe patterns of the coating is 0.202 nm, which corresponds to the interplanar distance of the (131) plane of the Li2MnO3 (corresponding to a diffraction peak of 2θ ≈ 44.8° in XRD patterns).
 Fig. 3  TEM images of the samples (a) LF0, (b) LF04. The images exhibit that there is no surface coating on the LF0 particles, while a thin coating of Li2MnO3 is seen on the particle surface of the LF04 sample.

In order to further confirm the structure of the surface coating, elemental point analysis using EDX in STEM is carried out. Fig. 5(a) shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM image of the LF06 sample. The EDX spectrum measured at the position of the surface coating which is marked as a circle in Fig. 5(a) is shown in Fig. 5(b). As seen in the spectrum, unexpected elements: Cu and C are detected, and this is caused by a carbon-covered copper grid which is used for supporting the sample in TEM measurement. The EDX analysis reveals that the coating layer contains only Mn and O elements. Calculated from the EDX spectrum, the atomic ratio of Mn:O in the coating layer is 24.26:75.74, confirming the surface coating layer is composed of Li2MnO3.
 Fig. 5  (a) HAADF-STEM image of the LF06 sample; (b) EDX spectrum measured at the marked position in (a). 
Fourier transform infrared spectra of the as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 6. Two distinct absorption peaks observed in all the samples are assigned to the asymmetric stretching modes of the MnO6 octahedron.29 The Mn–O stretching bands of the spinel LiMn2O4-based composites are shifted towards higher wave-numbers as m increases. Their progressive shift to a higher wavenumber signals stronger Mn–O binding in the spinel structure. The blue shift is mainly due to the diffusion of Li+ ions into the octahedral sites to substitute Mn3+ in the spinel. The Li+ ion doping into the spinel could decreases the Mn3+/Mn4+ ratio and increases the average oxide state of Mn, resulting in a decrease of the average bond length of Mn–O. However, as shown in the figure, the blue shift from LF04 to LF06 is significantly smaller than that between LF0, LF02 and LF04, suggesting little additional ions doping into the structure when m increase from 0.4 to 0.6. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained by XRD analysis. Considering the volatilization of fluorine during the synthetic process, the additional LiF causes a great increase of the content of Li2MnO3 in the LF04 and LF06 samples, just as the analysis in the TEM measurement.
 Fig. 6  FT-IR spectroscopy for all the samples. The distinct absorption peaks in the spectroscopy are assigned to the asymmetric stretching modes of the MnO6 octahedron in the spinel LiMn2O4-based composites. The Mn–O stretching bands of composites are shifted towards a higher wave-number as m (LiF content) increases, suggesting stronger Mn–O binding as the Mn4+/Mn ratio increases with more Li doping for Mn in the spinel octahedral sites. 
The initial discharge curves of all the samples cycled at C/2 at room temperature are shown in Fig. 7. The LF0 sample shows distinct voltage step at 0.5 Li characteristic of Li+-ion ordering. The step is less pronounced in the LF02 sample, indicating the Li and F double doping could suppress the long-range ordering of the Li+ ions in the spinel LiMn2O4. Moreover, for the samples LF04 and LF06, as shown in the figure, the voltage step is essentially fully suppressed. These results indicate that the doping of Li and F into the spinel structure could efficiently suppress the ordering of Li+ ions and enhance the stability of the spinel structure.
 Fig. 7  The initial discharge curves of all the samples cycled at C/2 at room temperature. 
The variation of discharge capacity as a function of cycle number for samples is performed at a current rate of C/2 at room temperature to evaluate the capacity retention of the prepared samples. The LF0 sample delivers initial discharge capacity of 138.5 mA h g−1, and rapidly decreases to 97.3 mA h g−1 after 170 cycles with only 70.3% capacity retention. Fig. 8 shows the cycling performance of the Li and F modified spinel composites. As seen in the figure, the LF02 and LF04 samples deliver lower initial discharge capacities about 114.6 and 95.7 mA h g−1 respectively, but show significantly improved cycling performance. After 300 cycles, the LF02 and LF04 samples exhibit capacity retention of 98.3% and 99.7% respectively. Especially, the capacity of the LF06 sample even improves with cycling, suggesting that too thick a coat of Li2MnO3 is not optimal.

In order to explore the stability of the modified spinel samples on prolonged cycling, the LF02 and LF04 samples are tested at 1 C at room temperature for 1000 cycles. The results shown in Fig. 9 exhibit that the LF02 and LF04 samples could deliver a discharge capacity of 106 and 94.9 mA h g−1 respectively after 1000 cycles, and the corresponding capacity retention is 92% and 98.8%, respectively.

Fig. 10 shows the cycling performance of the LF02 and LF04 samples cycled at 55 °C at rate of C/2. The capacity retention of the LF02 and LF04 samples is 92.3% and 94.3% respectively after 100 cycles. The results indicate that the modification of Li and F body-doping and the inborn Li2MnO3 surface-coating could effectively improve the cycling performance of the spinel LiMn2O4, even at elevated temperatures.
 Fig. 10  The cycling performance of the LF02 and LF04 samples cycled at C/2 at 55 °C. Both the samples exhibit excellent capacity-retention at 55 °C elevated temperature. 
The greatly improved cycling performance of the composites could be explained as follows: the Li+, F− co-doping enhances the stability of the cubic structure by suppressing the Jahn–Teller distortion and the long-range ordering of Li+ ions. Additionally, considering the degree of electronegativity for F− is larger than that of O2−, the substitution of O2− by F− could improve the stability of the spinel by enhancing the bond strength between anion and transition metal cation.30 The Li2MnO3 coating on the surface is compact and thin, which could effectively hinder the direct contact between active particles and electrolyte to reduce the Mn2+ dissolution into liquid electrolyte. Mn dissolution experiment has been carried out to verify the effect of Li2MnO3 coating. LF0 and LF04 samples have been immersed in electrolyte solution respectively and Mn dissolution in the electrolyte is detected by TCP-AES. The LF0 sample shows 2.17% dissolution while LF04 sample delivers only 0.19% dissolution. The greatly suppressed Mn dissolution in LF04 sample suggests that the Li2MnO3 coating could effectively hinder the Mn2+ dissolution into the electrolyte, which is benefit to the cycle stability of the spinel.
The rate capability is an important electrochemical performance for lithium ion batteries. Fig. 11 shows the electrochemical performance of the LF02 and LF04 electrodes cycled at rate of 7 C at room temperature. Both samples exhibit good cycling stability at high charge–discharge current. After 300 cycles, the LF02 electrode delivers capacity of 104.3 mA h g−1 with 95.5% capacity retention, just as shown in Fig. 11(a), and the LF04 electrode exhibits 85.7 mA h g−1 with 95.8% capacity retention. Additionally, both electrodes exhibit an average value of coulombic efficiency more than 99.6%.

Conclusion
Spinel LiMn2O4-based cathode active materials used for lithium ion batteries have been prepared through one-step synthetic process. The X-ray diffraction and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis reveal that the Li and F ions have diffused into the spinel structure to form Li[LiyMn2−y]O4−zFz. A layer of Li2MnO3 coated on the surface of the spinel particle is detected by transmission electron microscopy. The Li2MnO3 coating born with the synthesis of spinel active material is thin and uniform. The modified spinel composites exhibit excellent cycling performance and high rate capability, indicating the inborn modification of doping and coating could enhance the electrochemical performance of spinel LiMn2O4efficiently. The great improvement in electrochemical performance is mainly due to the elimination of Jahn–Teller distortion, the suppression of Li+-ion order at 0.5 Li and the decrease of disproportionation of surface Mn3+ ions in spinel LiMn2O4-based composites.

The Mn–O stretching bands of composites are shifted towards a higher wave-number as m (LiF content) increases, suggesting stronger Mn–O binding as the Mn4+/Mn ratio increases with more Li doping for Mn in the spinel octahedral sites.	 

 	Fig. 7  The initial discharge curves of all the samples cycled at C/2 at room temperature.
