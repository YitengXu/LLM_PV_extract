    , Accepted 21st January 2015First published on 21st January 2015AbstractA heterogeneously porous “green carbon” structure was derived from abundant London plane leaves and shows excellent performance for both CO2 capture and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). The carbonised and KOH-activated carbon possesses a high level of micropores, a specific surface area exceeding 2000 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of over 1 cm3 g−1, leading to an excellent CO2 uptake of 19.4 wt% under ambient conditions and fast four-electron transfer in an alkaline medium for ORR. Furthermore, XPS and X-ray analyses reveal well-dispersed metal elements (such as Mg and Ca) in the porous carbon, which are naturally doped and inherited from the leaf structure, and can help to enhance CO2 adsorption. On the other hand, these metal elements do not positively affect catalytic ORR performance. Hence, a purpose-specific cleaning approach after KOH activation, i.e. by water or acid, has been devised to obtain optimal functionalities for CO2 capture or ORR.
Introduction
The mitigation of global climate change to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration includes two major approaches: carbon capture and storage (CCS) for fossil-fuel powered plants and the deployment of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. In both cases, the development of a highly efficient energy storage technology is important to increase grid efficiency and/or integrate renewable resources into the electrical grid. Porous carbon has long been regarded as an ideal CO2 sorbent and an electrode material for energy conversion and storage devices, due to its relatively low cost, facile mass production and good stability under moist, basic and acidic environments. More specifically, porous carbon features low energy consumption for material regeneration with regard to CO2 capture, since gas molecules can be readily removed after adsorption due to the physisorptive nature of carbon.1,2 It also shows high electrical conductivity as an electrocatalyst or electrode for fast electron transfer, and a large surface area to ensure sufficient active site exposure.3–5 In order to achieve optimised performance for both the applications, carbon materials need to be further activated to generate microporous structures with high specific surface areas. This is usually achieved by high temperature treatment with KOH. In addition, the performance of carbon materials can be further modified by various dopants, including both non-metallic (such as nitrogen or boron) and metallic (such as iron or cobalt) elements.6–9 Typically, the nitrogen functional groups at carbon edges can enhance CO2 capture due to their Lewis basicity; moreover, the charge and spin re-distribution derived from nitrogen incorporation into the carbon matrix can also facilitate oxygen adsorption and dissociation during the oxygen reduction reaction.6 For metal doping, several studies have illustrated exceptional electrochemical performance from strongly coupled organic/inorganic hybrids.10–12 However, the role of atomic metal doping for carbon capture has not been clearly investigated, particularly by experiment, although some computational simulations point to the importance of metallic doping.13,14
Biomass is a renewable and competitive carbon precursor, compared with many others (such as polymers15,16), because of its abundant reserves, low cost and simple mass production. In contrast, the synthesis of polymeric precursors usually involves complex procedures and the strict control of synthesis conditions. With regards to CO2 capture, starch, cellulose and sawdust-derived carbon sorbents are prepared through KOH activation and are reported to have CO2 uptakes of 15.2, 15.5 and 21.2 wt% under 1 bar CO2 and 25 °C, respectively.17 Wang et al. have reported studies on celtuce derived porous carbon, with a KOH/carbon weight ratio of 4:1 and an activation temperature of 800 °C.18 Their sample exhibits a CO2 uptake of 19.2 wt% under the same test conditions. As for catalytic oxygen reduction, Gao et al. demonstrated that nitrogen-doped carbon materials synthesised via hydrothermal treatment of Gastrodia elata followed by ionothermal pyrolysis exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a dominant four-electron pathway in an alkaline medium.19 Similarly, Zhu et al. selected an abundant microorganism, Bacillus subtilis, as a carbon precursor.20 Ionothermal treatment was adopted for carbonisation followed by acid activation, and the sample after base washing exhibited both excellent ORR electrocatalytic activity and superior performance as a supercapacitor. These earlier reports show the superb potential of biomass derived carbon. Moreover, biomass-derived carbon also offers a favourable route for the study of the beneficial effects of nitrogen doping, and especially atomic metal doping, as metal centres in the biomass derivation of carbons are often desirable isolated atomic sites. Such issues have not been clarified and discussed previously.
Herein, we present a facile synthesis of highly microporous carbon materials with a large surface area (>2000 m2 g−1) and a pore volume of over 1 cm3 g−1via the direct carbonisation of London plane leaves followed by KOH activation. Naturally occurring nitrogen and metal elements are preserved as dopants to enhance molecular sorption, e.g. for CO2 capture. London plane accounts for 50% of all planted trees in the urban area of London,21 and thus generates a substantial amount of leaf waste. This natural biomass material can be a potential “zero-cost” carbon precursor, which offers a “green material” to produce porous carbon materials and dispose this major urban waste. Additionally, we demonstrate that the obtained nitrogen and/or metal-doped porous carbon could be selectively used as efficient CO2 sorbents and ORR electrocatalysts. In particular, the role of metal doping in both the applications is effectively studied. The results show that a small amount of Mg and Ca elemental dopants could effectively improve CO2 sorption; nonetheless, these metals are identified as ‘dead mass’ for catalytic ORR activity. After the removal of metals, the pure nitrogen-doped carbon materials show greatly improved electrochemical performance. In summary, our study shows that London plane leaf waste derived porous carbon is a promising low-cost, highly efficient and multi-functional “green” candidate for both CO2 capture and energy storage applications.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
Fallen leaves of the London plane (Platanus × hispanica) were collected from Gordon Square Garden near University College London's Bloomsbury Campus in July 2013. The leaves were washed to remove dust and dirt. The cleaned leaves were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The dried leaves became crispy and were ground into small pieces using a mortar and pestle. The ground leaves were carbonised at 600 °C for an hour in a horizontal tube furnace (VTF 15/75/450, Lenton, UK) with constant nitrogen gas flow. The corresponding ramping rate was 3 °C min−1. After carbonisation, the resulting carbon was mixed with potassium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, UK) in KOH/carbon weight ratios of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 in 10 ml distilled water. The mixture was ultrasonically agitated for 30 min to achieve a uniform suspension in the KOH solution. The solution was then dried to a solid mixture of KOH and carbon in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The solid mixture was thermally activated at 600, 700 and 800 °C in the furnace under a constant nitrogen flow for an hour. The corresponding ramping rate was maintained at 3 °C min−1. The resulting carbon samples were washed repeatedly with distilled water until their pH values were neutral. In addition, another 700 °C treated sample was washed with 1 M HCl acid to remove the metal elements within. Finally, the samples were dried in the vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The samples are marked as LCx–y, where LC stands for leaf-derived carbon, x:1 is the weight ratio of KOH/carbon and y is the thermal treatment temperature. The HCl acid washed sample was marked as LC2-700H.
Characterisations
Sample morphologies were captured using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM 6301F, JEOL, Japan). In addition, a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100, Japan) was used to obtain the high resolution images of the carbon structures. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, K-ALPHA, Thermo Scientific, USA) was employed to analyse the chemical composition of the samples. The identities of the elements and chemical compounds were retrieved from the NIST XPS online database by searching their corresponding binding energies in the database system.22 An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Stadi P, STOE, Germany) was used to detect the existence of any crystals of metal or metal compounds in the samples. The porosities of the samples were analysed using an automated gas sorption analyser (Autosorb-iQ C, Quantachrome, USA). The specific surface areas, specific micropore surface areas, micropore volumes and pore size distributions were derived from the corresponding nitrogen sorption isotherms at −196 °C (liquid nitrogen), and calculated using the Non-Local Density Functional Theory (slit/cylindrical pores) equilibrium model (NLDFT). The total pore volume was derived from the amount of gas adsorbed at the partial pressure P/P0 = 0.99. The same gas sorption analyser was also used to measure the CO2 adsorption capacities from 0.01 to 1 bar at 0 and 25 °C. In addition, the ultramicropore volume (pore size < 0.7 nm) was derived from the 0 °C CO2 isotherm and calculated using the “CO2 on carbon at 273 K NLDFT” model. The heat of adsorption was calculated using the Clausus–Clapeyron equation based on the CO2 adsorption isotherms at 0, 25 and 50 °C.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic and rotating voltammetry was performed in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. For the electrode preparation, 4 mg catalyst was added to a mixture of 100 μl nafion (5 wt% in alcohol and water, Sigma-Aldrich) and 900 μl distilled water, followed by ultrasonication for one hour to achieve uniform dispersion of the sample in the solvent. 5 μl catalyst suspensions were then drop casted on a glassy carbon (GC) working electrode (3 mm diameter, Metrohm) and dried at 60 °C. The ORR activity was tested in a three-electrode configuration. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reference electrode and a platinum sheet (Metrohm) was used as the counter electrode. The electrolyte was purged with oxygen for an hour before measurement, and oxygen was continuously bubbled though the electrolyte during the tests, in order to ensure the saturation of the electrolyte with oxygen. The scan rates for cyclic and rotating voltammetry were 100 and 10 mV s−1, respectively. All the results were recorded using a Metrohm Autolab 302N.
Results and discussion
Morphologies of leaf and leaf-derived carbon
The freshly collected London plane leaves were bright green due to the existence of chlorophyll. However, the leaves became yellow and crispy after being dried in a vacuum oven. The dehydration converts chlorophyll into pheophytin.23 With the decreasing chlorophyll content, the orange, yellow, brown and grey colours of carotenoid and pheophytin pigments emerge. After carbonisation, the leaves turn into black carbon.24

Fig. 1 shows the morphological change from a leaf to a porous carbon structure. The macroporous sponge layer beneath the cuticle layer of the dried leaf is clearly exposed in the SEM image, Fig. 1b. Several stomata on the cuticle suggest that this is the lower epidermis side of the leaf, and thus the macroporous sponge layer can be observed beneath the epidermis. This macroporous structure of the sponge layer is retained even after carbonisation at 600 °C. This well-preserved interconnected macroporous structure facilitates the impregnation of the carbonised sample by the KOH solution for rapid and uniform activation. The activated sample shows disintegrated porous carbon fragments of micrometre sizes. The corresponding high resolution TEM image (Fig. 1d) reveals randomly oriented graphitic nano-platelets (indicated by the red squares). The image shows that the nanoporous carbon structure consists of defective graphitic nano-platelets embedded in an otherwise amorphous carbon matrix. As a result, the discontinuity in the carbon nanostructure leads to the formation of a large number of voids. These voids are the origin of the micropores, which contribute to the large specific surface area and pore volume in the resulting samples.

Fig. 2a shows that all the N2 isotherms exhibit typical features of the Type-I sorption isotherm, which suggests that the sorbents mainly consist of micropores. This is reflected in Fig. 2b, where all the sorbents show three major peaks in the micropore size region (<2 nm) at 1, 1.2 and 2 nm. Table 1 shows the structural characteristics of carbon sorbents prepared with different weight ratios of KOH/carbon and different activation temperatures. It can be concluded that the specific surface area and pore volume increase with the KOH/carbon weight ratio and activation temperature. The sample LC3-700, prepared with KOH/carbon = 3:1 at 700 °C presents the highest specific surface area of 2230 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 1.03 cm3 g−1. However, LC2-800 shows the highest ultramicropore volume values (VCO2, <0.7 nm). At lower KOH/carbon weight ratios and activation temperatures, the ultra-micropores are less well developed. The accumulation of KOH in a localised area on the sample surface may result in reduced micropores due to excessive reactions between KOH and carbon. It has been thoroughly discussed in previous reports that the KOH activation reaction is significantly influenced by the KOH/carbon weight ratio and activation temperature.25–27 The chemical activation reaction removes carbon atoms from the carbon structure to create porosity. Below 700 °C, the activation reaction mainly produces potassium oxides and potassium carbonates with CO2, H2, CO and H2O as the main gaseous products. The removal of carbon atoms is mainly carried out by the gasification reaction between carbon and H2O, where H2O is generated from the dehydration reaction of KOH. Above 700 °C, potassium carbonate further decomposes into potassium oxide and carbon dioxide; and carbon reduces carbon dioxide, potassium carbonate and potassium oxide into carbon monoxide and elemental potassium.25–27 These additional carbon removal reactions raise the level of activation, either by creating more micropores or enlarging the sizes of existing pores. It is also important to note that the N2 sorption isotherm of LC2-700H is at a similar position to that of LC2-700. In addition, LC2-700H shows a higher ultramicropore volume, which can be attributed to the acid-washing process.

Chemical analysis of leaf-derived carbon
The surface chemical compositions of all samples were characterised by XPS, and the results are summarised in Table 2. The analyser detects only carbon, oxygen and minor amounts of nitrogen in the leaves, without other anticipated elements such as metallic elements. The reason is that the pieces of leaf are protected by both upper and lower cuticles, which comprise layers of waxes and dead cells with only cell walls, but without other living cell components such as the cytoplasm and nucleus.28 The major components in cell walls are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, which mainly contain carbon and oxygen elements. The thickness of a cuticle layer can vary from 0.1 to 10 μm,29 far beyond the detection limit of XPS analysis (1 to 10 nm).30 Therefore, XPS cannot acquire the chemical information below both the upper and lower cuticle layers. Even if some parts of the mesophyll layer are exposed (Fig. 1), the thickness of the cell wall can vary from 0.1 to 10 μm as well,31 which is still too thick for XPS analysis. In addition, within the original leaf, the levels of carbon and oxygen are much higher than those of other elements. Therefore, their high peak intensities suppress the peaks of other elements in this case. After a certain amount of carbon and oxygen is lost due to carbonisation and activation, more elements, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphate and chlorine, are revealed. A higher level of nitrogen is also detected in the other samples after activation, thanks to the etching of the cell walls, which exposes more intracellular nitrogen-containing compounds. The existence of these elements is anticipated because they are all essential elements in various nutrients for plants. Nitrogenous, phosphatic and potassic fertilisers are the three most used nutrients in agriculture. They are the key ingredients in various plant cell components such as amino acids and chlorophylls, catalysts for synthesis reactions and activators for enzymes.24 Metal-containing nutrients may function as fertilizers in the form of their corresponding chlorides due to their high solubility in water. This can explain the existence of chlorine in Table 2.

Potassium and sodium are important chemical components in plant cells. During carbonisation, organic cell membranes decompose at the high temperature, thus releasing the potassium and sodium contents of the cytoplasm. As a result, these two elements can be detected after carbonisation. Fig. 3a and S1† show the high resolution XPS K-2p and Na-1s spectra of the carbonised sample LC0-600, respectively. The K-2p spectrum shows two peaks at 296.3 and 293.4 eV, which correspond to the binding energies of the K-2p1/2 and K-2p3/2 electrons, respectively. The sodium spectrum shows a weak peak at 1071.9 eV, which corresponds to the binding energy of the Na-1s electrons.
 Fig. 3  High resolution XPS spectra of the major chemical elements in leaf-derived carbon. 
Nitrogen is another element that emerges after carbonisation. It is usually assimilated by plants in the form of nitrates, nitrites and ammonium salts, and transformed into proteins, chlorophylls, nucleic acids and other active components in plant cells.24 These nitrogen-containing substances cannot survive high temperature treatments. However, an earlier study has shown that intracellular amino acids and proteins can react with pectin during pyrolysis, and thus this reaction fixes nitrogen in the resulting carbon.32 Overall, only 0.9 at% nitrogen was found at the surface of the carbonised sample LC0-600, since those nitrogen-containing substances are not intrinsic in the lignocellulosic compounds in cell walls, and most of the nitrogen may have been lost due to the high temperature treatment.
The amount of nitrogen detected by XPS in the activated carbon samples is also influenced by the cell structure. Though it has been reported in previous studies that nitrogen content in carbon is significantly reduced after chemical activation,15 the 700 °C activated sample LC2-700 shows 1.3 at% nitrogen, which is even slightly higher than that of LC0-600 (0.9 at%). The same observation can be applied to LC2-600 and LC1-700. This phenomenon can be explained by the etching of the cell walls and the exposure of more nitrogen-containing compounds. There is severe loss of nitrogen in LC2-800 and LC3-700 due to more aggressive KOH activation.
Although the level of nitrogen is increased in LC2-700, the composition of the different forms of nitrogen is still consistent with earlier studies. Fig. 3b–d show the high resolution N-1s spectra of LC0-600, LC2-700 and LC2-700H, respectively. The deconvolution of the LC0-600 spectrum shows two major peaks at 398.7 and 400.7 eV, which correspond to the pyridinic and pyridonic types of nitrogen, respectively. The calculation of the area ratio of the two deconvoluted peaks suggests that about 64 at% pyridonic and 36 at% pyridinic nitrogen are present. The level of pyridinic nitrogen is greatly reduced to 9 at% after chemical activation at 700 °C, and the binding energies of the two peaks shift to 398.2 and 400.1 eV. The 400.7 to 400.1 eV peak shift may correspond to the transformation of pyridonic to pyrrolic types of nitrogen,33 whereas the 398.7 to 398.2 eV peak shift may be due to the interaction between metal and pyridinic nitrogen, where electrons are transferred from metal to pyridinic nitrogen.34
More inorganic elements, including magnesium, calcium and phosphorus, appear in the XPS spectra after activation, because the activation reaction between KOH and carbon helps to etch through the cell walls and expose the remaining contents of the cells. In contrast, K, Na and Cl completely disappeared, because the samples were thoroughly washed with distilled water. Fig. 3e and f show the high resolution Mg-1s and Ca-2p spectra of LC2-700, respectively. The magnesium spectrum shows a single peak at 1304.1 eV, indicating that the magnesium element exists in the form of +2 ions. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the calcium spectrum, which indicates that calcium exists in the form of +2 ions. It has been discussed in earlier studies that some residual potassium contents are detected after KOH chemical activation, even after the samples are washed.25 Zhao et al. further proposed that the residual potassium may exist in the form of extra-framework cations.13 In contrast, our XPS analysis does not detect residual potassium, which indicates that neither intrinsic (from leaf cells) nor extrinsic (from KOH) potassium is chemically grafted to the chemical structure of the resulting carbon samples. However, instead of potassium, magnesium and calcium are the residual metals in the resulting carbon structure. Furthermore, Table 2 shows that all the metal elements were washed away by 1 M HCl acid (LC2-700H). As shown in Fig. 4, the XRD analyses of all the activated carbon samples have no diffraction peaks that are related to the crystal structures of magnesium and calcium or their corresponding metal oxides, which implies that those metal elements may not exist in those forms but are bonded with the resulting carbon structure in the form of cations.

CO2 uptake of leaf-derived carbon
CO2 adsorption tests were carried out from 0.01 to 1 bar CO2 at 0 and 25 °C, respectively. The corresponding CO2 adsorption isotherms and uptakes are plotted and summarised in Fig. 5 and Table 3, respectively. LC2-700 shows the highest CO2 uptake of 19.4 wt% at 25 °C under 1 bar CO2, while LC2-800 exhibits the highest CO2 uptake of 33.6 wt% at 0 °C. Besides the materials mentioned in the introduction, the CO2 adsorption capacity can also be compared with those of recently reported carbon sorbents under 1 bar and 25 °C, e.g., 12.5 wt% for dialdehyde and diamine derived microporous carbon,35 8.6 wt% for imine-linked polymer-derived carbon,36 13.6 wt% for polyimine-based carbon,37 and 15.0 wt% for fungi-based carbon.38 Clearly, the London plane leaf-derived carbon shows a superior capacity for CO2 capture under identical conditions.

At 0 °C, all the isotherms intersect with each other at different pressures below 0.7 bar. As the temperature increases to 25 °C, the upper bound of the intersection points rises to about 0.8 bar, as shown in Fig. 5b. These changes in the intersection points indicate enhanced binding with CO2 molecules at relatively lower pressures and higher temperatures. In addition, there is a 1.2 wt% difference between the CO2 uptakes of LC2-700 and LC2-700H under 0.15 bar. This is a more significant difference in CO2 uptake than that under 1 bar. It was mentioned in the porosity analysis that LC3-700 shows the highest specific surface area and LC2-800 possesses the highest ultramicropore volume, and these two porosity parameters are considered to have a significant influence on CO2 uptake. However, both of those samples had relatively low CO2 uptake at 25 °C. This implies that porosity is not the only factor that influences CO2 uptake.
It has been widely discussed in previous reports that the presence of nitrogen in a sample enhances CO2 binding with carbon sorbents due to its basic nature.15,16,39–41 Both pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen atoms exist in nitrogen-containing carbon sorbents, but the former is more influential because it has a lone pair of electrons, and thus exhibits higher basicity than the latter.42 The small quantities of nitrogen are found in all the activated samples, but the level of pyridinic nitrogen is further reduced with increasing KOH/carbon weight ratio and activation temperature; correspondingly, its effect on CO2 uptake is also reduced. In addition to the nitrogen element, magnesium and calcium also exist in the samples. LC2-700 is the sample washed with distilled water, whereas LC2-700H was washed with 1 M HCl acid to remove the metal dopants. Fig. 5a shows that the acid-washed sample LC2-700H exhibits a slightly higher CO2 uptake than its water-washed counterpart at 0 °C under 1 bar, due to a slightly larger ultramicropore volume, as indicated in Table 1. However, LC2-700 shows a higher CO2 uptake at 25 °C, as shown in Fig. 5b. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5a, the LC2-700 and LC2-700H isotherms intersect with each other at about 0.5 bar, which indicates that LC2-700 shows an even higher CO2 uptake than LC2-700H at the low pressure regime (<0.5 bar). At 25 °C, the isotherm of LC2-700H is entirely below that of LC2-700. It was previously mentioned that no crystalline metal or metal oxides were found by XRD analysis, and the corresponding XPS suggests that both Mg and Ca exist in the form of cations. In consideration of the previously referenced study on extra-framework cations,13 magnesium and calcium may also be grafted to the carbon structures in a well dispersed form, as inherited from the leaf structure, and thus may considerably enhance both CO2 binding through electrostatic interaction and the density of the active sites, leading to greatly increased CO2 uptake.
Heat of adsorption and influence of dopants

Fig. 5b shows that there is an extra 0.9 wt% CO2 uptake (under 1 bar CO2 and 25 °C) in LC2-700 compared with LC2-700H. Under 0.15 bar and 25 °C, the difference is 1.2 wt%. It should be noted that LC2-700 possesses a lower specific surface area, pore volume and ultramicropore volume than LC2-700H.

Fig. 5c shows the heat of adsorption plot of leaf-derived carbon. Differing from the CO2 adsorption isotherm plots, LC2-600 shows the highest heat of adsorption of all the samples, while LC3-700 is at the bottom of the diagram. The heat of adsorption of a sample can be influenced by both its dopants and porosity. Considering that LC2-600 shows the least developed porous structure, its high heat of adsorption can be solely attributed to dopants. However, LC2-600 possesses a considerable amount of both nitrogen and metal dopants. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish their respective effects on the CO2 uptake. It can be noted from Fig. 5c that LC1-700 shows the second highest heat of adsorption, and shows a less developed porous structure than LC2-700. It also contains a lower level of nitrogen, but a higher level of calcium than LC2-700. Therefore, the higher heat of adsorption should be attributed to the existence of calcium dopants.
In addition, in Fig. 6, CO2 uptake and specific CO2 uptake (CO2 uptake/porosity) are plotted against porosity parameters using both our experimental data and those referenced in the “Introduction” section of our manuscript, including starch, cellulose, sawdust, celtuce and yeast. It should be noted that specific BET surface areas were used in this analysis, in order to be consistent with the characterisation data from the previous reports. The specific BET surface area of the leaf-derived carbon is summarised in Table S1.† It is noted from Fig. 6a and c that a higher specific surface area and pore volume do not necessarily play a dominant role in CO2 adsorption. The samples with higher specific surface areas and pore volumes do not necessarily have higher CO2 uptakes. The same observation can be applied to Fig. 6b and d. However, it is interesting to note that our samples with higher metal contents (LC1-700 and LC2-600) changed from the bottom-left in Fig. 6a and c to the top-left in Fig. 6b and d. This change in positions suggests those two samples have higher CO2 uptake per surface area and pore volume. Furthermore, Fig. 6e shows that those samples with ultramicropore volumes also exhibit higher CO2 uptake such as the saw-dust derived carbon (on the top right of the figure). However, it can also be noted that some samples with similar ultramicropore volumes (on the left of the figure) show different levels of CO2 uptake. In contrast to Fig. 6e, all of our leaf-derived carbon samples occupy the top-left of Fig. 6f, which indicates they have much higher CO2 uptake per ultramicropore volume than the other samples. The common characteristics of these samples are the possession of nitrogen and metal dopants. This observation indicates that nitrogen and metal dopants play a more important role than porosity for low pressure CO2 capture (i.e. ≤1 bar).

Artificial neural network
An artificial neural network was built with Matlab R2013a to analyse the relationship between the influencing factors and CO2 uptake at 25 °C and under 1 bar CO2. In this study, nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium contents as well as ultramicropore volume were selected as input parameters, and the CO2 uptake at 25 °C and 1 bar CO2 as the target parameter. In total, 31 experimental data pairs from this study and previous reports were selected as the input data for building the network.15,17,41,43,44 Within these experimental data pairs, 21 data pairs were used for training, whereas 5 were used for validation and 5 for testing. The training process was carried out using the “nftool” (neural network fitting toolbox) of Matlab by using the training function “trainlm” (Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation). After several trials, the network with 20 neurons and 1 hidden layer gave the best outcome with Rtrain = 0.9404, Rvalidation = 0.9972 and Rtest = 0.9154. Therefore, this network was chosen for the subsequent simulation.
After the network was trained, it was used to simulate the influences of input parameters on CO2 uptakes. The simulation was carried out with the “nntool” (open network/data manager) of Matlab. Before the simulation, the following data processing was applied to the input parameters:
(1) For each simulation, one of the four input parameters was set to be the variable, where its simulated data range was within the value range of its corresponding input parameter. The other three were set to be constant, where the value of a constant was the average of the maximum and minimum of the input parameters. The corresponding values are summarised in Table 4.

(2) For the chemical composition of each sample from the previous reports, its unit was converted into “at%” if necessary, whereas its value was recalculated into the composition of C, O, N, Ca and Mg, in order to be consistent with our own study. If an element was not detected in a sample in the previous reports, it was input as “0”.
(3) For both chemical composition and ultramicropore volume, if either value (or both) was not reported for a sample in the previous report, it was input as “NaN” (Not a Number).
The simulated output data were then plotted in Fig. 7. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 7 that the CO2 uptake increases rapidly with increasing calcium content, magnesium content and ultramicropore volume. However, the CO2 uptake does not vary regularly with increasing nitrogen content. These predicted that the influences of input parameters on CO2 uptake are consistent with the analysis in the previous chapter, which emphasises that metal dopants and ultramicropores are the two key determinants for the CO2 capture performance of porous carbon materials. The irregular change of CO2 uptake with nitrogen content can be explained by the existence of various nitrogen functional groups. It was mentioned in the previous chapter that nitrogen dopants can exist in different forms such as pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen. The former has a higher affinity towards acidic CO2 molecules due to its higher basicity. The composition of different forms of nitrogen is not frequently reported in the literature. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish their individual influences on CO2 capture. Furthermore, it can also be observed from Fig. 7 that the Mg content curve is slightly steeper than that of the Ca content. This suggests that Mg dopant may be predicted to have a greater influence than Ca dopant on CO2 uptake. This shows that this network can help to distinguish the contributions of different metal dopants on CO2 uptake.

Oxygen reduction catalytic activity of leaf-derived carbon
The electrochemical performance of the leaf-derived carbon materials was investigated by rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry. The measurements were conducted in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, with Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as the reference electrode. The current density shown here was determined by the measured current divided by the geometric surface area of the glassy carbon (GC) working electrode. Fig. 8 shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the leaf-derived carbon at 1600 rpm. It is clear that the electrochemical activities of all the lead-derived carbon samples are much more significant than the GC background, confirming the occurrence of catalytic oxygen reduction. It is also noted that the catalytic activity of LC2-700 outperforms that of the other water-washed leaf-derived carbon samples, and the electrochemical performance of acid-washed LC2-700H (washed by HCl) is even better than that of LC2-700, both in terms of the onset/half-wave reduction potential and the measured current density at a given potential. The LC2-600 sample shows the most negative onset/half-wave reduction potential, which is probably because the lower activation temperature (600 °C) leads to incomplete carbonisation (much lower carbon and higher oxygen ratios as determined by XPS, Table 2) and thus a lack of electrical conductivity. The cyclic voltammetry measurement of the carbon (Fig. S4†) also supports this argument. The LSV plots of LC3-700 and LC2-800 are similar, whereas LC1-700 shows a slightly more positive onset potential, but with a much broader reduction potential range before the diffusion limiting current is achieved. This is because the LC3-700 and LC2-800 samples possess larger surface areas but have much lower nitrogen contents, whereas LC1-700 has a higher nitrogen content but a much lower surface area. This phenomenon will be further explained later by the Tafel plot measurements (Fig. 10). In this regard, the catalytic activities of LC2-700 and LC2-700H are superior to the rest, due to a combination of their relatively large surface areas and their highest nitrogen content among all the leaf-derived carbon samples.

The ORR catalytic activities of the leaf-derived carbon samples were further investigated by the number of electrons exchanged during the reaction, based on the Koutecky–Levich equation:1/J = 1/JL + 1/Jk = 1/0.62nFC0(D0)2/3v−1/6ω1/2 + 1/Jkwhere J is the measured current density (mA cm−2), JL and Jk are the diffusion-limiting and kinetic current densities (mA cm−2), respectively, n is the overall number of electrons transferred in the oxygen reduction, F is the Faraday constant (96483 sA mol−1), C0 is the bulk saturated concentration of O2 in 0.1 M KOH (1.2 × 10−3 mol L−1), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 M KOH (1.9 × 10−5 mol L−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the 0.1 M KOH (0.01 m2 s−1), and ω is the angular velocity of the disk (rad s−1).45 According to the Koutecky–Levich plots (K–L plots, 1/J vs. ω1/2, Fig. 9a), the number of electrons exchanged during ORR can be calculated from the slope, 1/0.62nFC0(D0)2/3v−1/6. It can be seen from Table 5 and Fig. S5† that the electron transfer number for LC2-700 at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl is 3.04, which is higher than those of all the other water-washed leaf-derived carbon samples. The value of electron transfer number for LC2-700 (3.04) suggests a combined two-electron and four-electron pathway, partly because the majority of the nitrogen species are pyrrolic (Fig. 3c), which is not the most reactive form in terms of catalysis for ORR. In addition to nitrogen doping, metal also plays a role in the ORR activity of leaf derived carbon. It is shown in Fig. 9b that the number of electrons transferred for acid-washed LC2-700H is much higher than that of water-washed LC2-700 over a broad range of potentials from −0.4 to −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The electron transfer number for LC2-700H at −0.6 V is 3.73, very close to 4, indicating a near four-electron reduction pathway. Given the very similar microporous structures of LC2-700 and LC2-700H (Table 1), this enhancement should be attributed to the removal of metal species after acid washing. In this case, metal dopants such as Ca and Mg are not the active sites for the catalytic reaction and act as ‘dead mass’.

Tafel plots of the leaf derived carbon samples were further applied to characterise the reduction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 10, within the potential range of −0.15 to −0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl (the fast reduction range), the LC2-700H sample shows the highest kinetic current density, followed by LC2-700. However, the Tafel slopes of LC2-700H and LC2-700 (90.2 and 92 mV dec−1, respectively) are greater than those of LC3-700 and LC2-800 (69.8 and 75.5 mV dec−1, respectively). One possible reason is that the higher specific surface areas (Table 1) for LC3-700 and LC2-800 potentially lead to easy access to the active sites, and thus smaller Tafel plots at a low potential range. However, the real amount of exposed active sites is determined by the nitrogen content (Table 2), which is very low for these two samples, leading to overall sluggish reduction kinetics – smaller kinetic current density (Fig. 10) and smaller electron transfer number (Table 5). In contrast, the LC1-700 shows a larger Tafel plot (102.4 mV dec−1) and a greater level of electron transfer than LC3-700 and LC2-800, as it possesses higher nitrogen content but a smaller specific surface area. The small kinetic current density and large Tafel plot (115.7 mV dec−1) of LC2-600 are explained by the lack of carbonisation, as discussed before.

Conclusions
London plane leaf waste, rich in lignocelluloses with a cellular structure, is an ideal precursor for the production of low-cost but high-performance microporous carbon materials. The KOH/carbon weight ratio and activation temperature are the two major factors that largely influence the final porous structure and chemical composition of the resulting materials. Equally important are the biological structure and chemistry of the leaves, particularly well dispersed nitrogen, magnesium and calcium dopants in the derived carbon. The sample activated at 700 °C with a KOH/carbon weight ratio of 2:1, and washed by distilled water, shows the highest CO2 uptake of 19.4 wt% under 1 bar CO2 and 25 °C, as a result of the highly developed microporous structure and the preservation of nitrogen and elemental metal contents doped in the carbon materials. The dopants exist in the form of aromatic nitrogen and metal cations, which can enhance CO2 binding on carbon by means of the Lewis basicity and electrostatic interactions. The positive influence of metal dopants on CO2 uptake was further demonstrated by artificial neural network analysis. Those samples with nitrogen and metal dopants showed higher CO2 uptake per unit porosity. However, in contrast, the sample with the best ORR catalytic performance was prepared under the same activation conditions but was washed with 1 M HCl to remove the metal contents; this is because the metal contents play the role of “dead mass” in ORR, with little contribution to the catalysis of the reaction. The highly porous LC2-700H, with a specific surface area of 1630 m2 g−1, shows an almost direct four-electron pathway, although the nitrogen bonding configuration is mostly in the pyrrolic form. To summarise, here we present a facile synthesis of highly microporous carbon, derived from “zero-cost” London plane leaf waste, which has shown excellent potential in CO2 capture and ORR catalysis. The optimal performance in both applications is determined by the combined effects of the highly developed microporous structure and the intrinsic nitrogen and metal doping. Appropriate preparation procedures have been carefully devised for the two different types of applications.
