    , Accepted 22nd February 2014First published on 25th February 2014AbstractLow temperature fuel cells (LTFCs) have received broad attention due to their low operating temperature, virtually zero emissions, high power density and efficiency. However, the limited stability of the catalysts is a critical limitation to the large scale commercialization of LTFCs. State of the art carbon supports undergo corrosion under harsh chemical and electrochemical oxidation conditions, which results in performance degradation of catalysts. Therefore, non-carbon materials which are highly oxidation resistant under strongly oxidizing conditions of LTFCs are ideal alternative supports. This minireview highlights the advances and scenarios in using nano-ceramics as supports to enhance the stability of catalysts, the solutions to improve electrical conductivity of nano-ceramic materials, and the synergistic effects between metal catalyst and support to help improve the catalytic activity and CO/SO2 tolerance of catalysts.
1 Introduction
As one of the important low temperature fuel cells (LTFCs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are promising future devices used for portable electronics, transportation and emergency electric power sources because of environmentally friendly and highly efficient energy conversion.1–10 In a typical fuel cell device where a fuel (usually hydrogen) is converted into electricity at the anode, oxygen is reduced at the cathode at the same time. In general, the platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) on carbon (Pt/C) catalysts are the most widely used to catalyze the reaction. However, low stability is still a critical limitation to wide spread commercialization of PEMFCs.11–13 In currently catalytic studies, Pt and its alloy NPs have been highly active catalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode in PEMFCs.14–19 Unfortunately, these Pt-based NPs are unstable under such chemical and electrochemical oxidation conditions. Corrosive environment results in a decrease of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) because of Pt NPs migration/aggregation, dissolution/redeposition (Oswald ripening process), and detachment due to support corrosion.20–23 Meanwhile, even trace amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) present in the reformate H2/CO and sulfur (e.g., SO2) in air are prone to poisoning the surface of Pt NPs and substantially increase the overpotential for HOR (0.7 V) or ORR.24–28 As a result, tremendous efforts have been made toward the development of high-performance catalysts with enhanced durability and CO/SO2 tolerance in recent years.29–31
So far, several approaches have been successfully developed to improve the catalytic performance and utilization efficiency of Pt catalysts. Different types of Pt-based nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs), nanotubes, nanospheres, and nanofibers, have been reported as alternative catalysts to replace the traditional Pt/C catalysts.32–36 The novel ultrathin Pt monolayer shell–Pd nanowire core catalysts show excellent ORR activity and electrochemical stability under accelerated half-cell testing condition as compared with commercial Pt NPs.37 On the other hand, traditional carbon black support (e.g., Vulcan XC-72), with high surface area, good electric conductivity and high porosity, has a low standard electrode potential (0.207 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) for complete oxidation of carbon to CO2, leading to instability under harsh chemical and electrochemical oxidation conditions at the cathode during fuel cell operation. Extensive research has been devoted to developing novel supports with long-term stability. More stable carbon nanostructures, such as graphene nanosheets, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers, have been employed as catalyst supports, because their high degree of graphitized structure provides a higher resistance to chemical and electrochemical oxidation.38–44 For instance, FePt NPs have been assembled on the graphene as catalysts for ORR, and shown that the novel catalysts are stable under ORR conditions and show almost no activity change after 10000 potential sweeps between 0.4 and 0.8 V.45 Despite tremendous efforts, carbon oxidation also occurs in using these carbon-based materials as catalyst support at elevated potential due to the low standard corrosion potential for carbon. Therefore, nanocarbon materials with high oxidation resistance and stability are needed most urgently.
More recently, nano-ceramic materials have attracted much attention to increasing the durability of Pt catalysts due to their unique mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, and outstanding oxidation and acid corrosion resistance. Typical cyclic voltammetries (CVs) for the nano-ZrO2 ceramic and carbon black supports before and after oxidation treatment at 1.2 V held for 48 h are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the ceramics has almost no change in the redox region after oxidation treatment for 48 h at 1.2 V, which means there are negligible surface oxides (Fig. 1a). In contrast, a visible current peak occurs in the redox region for carbon black (Fig. 1b), which results from the surface oxide formation due to a hydroquinone–quinone (HQ–Q) redox couple on the carbon black surface. These results indicate that ceramic material is more corrosion resistant and durable when used in fuel cells. Some metal oxides, carbides and nitrides have been found to facilitate the increment of stability for Pt-based NPs when supported on such supports. Although ceramic supports greatly improve the stability of the catalysts, the universal low electrical conductivity of ceramic materials is the main issue for limiting their commercialization in fuel cells.46–49 This work highlights recent advances and research prospects in using nano-ceramics as supports to enhance the stability of catalysts, the solutions to improve the electrical conductivity of nano-ceramic materials, and the synergistic effects between a metal catalyst and support to help improve the activity and CO/SO2 tolerance of the catalysts. Nano-ceramic materials have been proven to be a promising solution to address the stability of metal catalysts, not only for fuel cells, and even for broader industrial fields.

2 Improving the stability of catalysts by employing electrochemically inert ceramics
Nano-ceramic materials are usually used as stable supports due to their excellent resistance to electrochemical oxidation and acid corrosion in fuel cell environment. Metal oxides, nitrides, borides and carbides show potential application prospects in replacing the traditional carbon black supports, which can improve the stability of metal NPs catalysts. Several representative ceramic supports used to enhance the stability of the catalysts will be mentioned in this perspective.
2.1 Conducting metal oxides
TinO2n−1 (where n is between 4 and 10) is widely used in fields of photocatalysis, water splitting, and gas sensors. Recently, TinO2n−1 has shown promising effects on the durability and catalytic activity of fuel cell catalysts because of its good mechanical resistance and stability in acidic and oxidative environments. Among this series of distinct oxides, Ti4O7 exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, exceeding 103 S cm−1 at 25 °C.50–53 Ioroi et al. studied the catalytic activity and stability of Pt NPs on Ti4O7, which was prepared by reduction of TiO2 powder at high temperature.52 Before testing the electrocatalytic activity of Pt/Ti4O7 catalysts, the stability of Ti4O7 support was compared with that of conventional carbon black support. The onset potential of the corrosion current during the positive direction sweep of CV was much higher for Ti4O7 than that for carbon black, indicateing that Ti4O7 has a higher resistance to electrochemical oxidation than carbon black. Pt/Ti4O7 also exhibited good activity for both HOR and ORR as compared to the conventional Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, it showed greater stability than the conventional Pt/C catalyst at high-potentials (1 h holding at 1.0–1.5 V vs. anode). So the Pt/Ti4O7 catalyst has a potential as both corrosion-resistant anode and cathode catalyst for fuel cells.
Popov et al.54 synthesized a novel TiO2-supported Pt electrocatalyst and compared the fuel cell performance with that of the Pt/C catalyst, although TiO2 had low electrical conductivity.55–57 The Pt/TiO2 catalysts exhibited an excellent fuel cell performance as well as ultrahigh stability at high positive potentials, which was attributed to low mass transport limitation in the cathode catalyst layer. Fig. 2 shows polarization curves for Pt/TiO2 electrocatalysts after the potential was held at 1.2 V for 0–200 h and the normalized ECSA of the two electrocatalysts as a function of Tc. The polarization curves were similar even after a corrosion time (Tc) of 200 h. In contrast, the Pt/C catalyst as a benchmark showed a greater decrease in its performance (93% after Tc = 80 h) due to the corrosion of carbon support and the induced migration and agglomeration of Pt NPs at high positive potentials. The ultrahigh stability of the Pt/TiO2 catalyst can be attributed to a strong metal support interaction between the Pt NPs and the TiO2 support synthesized via a template-assisted route. It has been reported that TiO2 can anchor the Pt NPs by interacting with Pt, thereby inhibiting Pt migration and agglomeration.

Tin oxide (SnO2) is a transition-metal dioxide with rutile structures, which is usually applied as oxygen deficient n-type semiconductor.58–60 The SnO2 was also prepared as a catalyst support due to its unique electrical, chemical, and physical properties.61–63 The Pt/SnO2 catalyst exhibited good electrochemical activity for ORR and much better stability in CV cycling tests (up to 1.3 V) when compared with the Pt/C. Surprisingly, after 1000 cycles the ECSA loss of the Pt/C was nearly 90%, whereas the Pt/SnO2 only approached a maximum of 50% ECSA after 5000 cycles. Meanwhile, the Pt/C catalyst showed a dramatic increase in the average particle size of Pt NPs. In contrast, slight agglomeration was observed for Pt/SnO2 due to the strong interaction between Pt NPs and tin oxide.64
Other metal oxides, such as SiO2, WOx and ZrO2, were also reported as the potential stable supports for fuel cell catalysts due to their specific properties.65–75
2.2 Metal nitrides
Resembling metal oxides, nano-metal nitrides (e.g., ZrN, TiN, TaN, VN) have also attracted much attention owing to their excellent thermal and chemical stabilities and possessing some potential catalytic properties that are similar to those of noble metals. Among them, titanium nitride (TiN) has been widely used as alternative support for fuel cell catalysts until now. TiN is a triple bond transition metal compound which is chemically inert, has outstanding oxidation and acid corrosion resistance, and higher electrical conductivity (4000 S m−1 as opposed to 1190 S m−1 for carbon black).76–78 These specific properties make it an excellent candidate for durable fuel cell catalyst supports replacing carbon. Haldar et al.79 synthesized the Pt/TiN catalyst via a polyol process, which showed higher electrochemical performance than the conventional Pt/C catalyst under PEMFC conditions. The TiN support is electrochemically inert and functions as a good electrical conductor in the potential region. The prepared Pt/TiN has similar ECSA to Pt/C and higher ORR activity for Pt/TiN was also exhibited in comparison with the carbon supported catalyst. The stability of TiN under fuel cell conditions has also been studied.80,81 TiN NPs supports had a lower corrosion rate as compared to conventional carbon black, and an active behavior of TiN NPs can be observed in sulphuric acid electrolyte at 60 °C, due to the formation of –OH groups on their surface which reduces electrical conductivity, thereby inhibiting the electron transportation properties. The degradation mechanism of the Pt/TiN is also different to the Pt/C catalyst. As the same amount of Pt NPs was loaded on both supports, unlike Pt/C which undergoes degradation via carbon corrosion and Pt NPs agglomeration mechanism, the Pt/TiN electrocatalyst degrades solely via surface agglomeration of Pt NPs.79–81
In addition, non-metal nanonitrides, such as BN and Si3N4 also have good thermal and chemical stabilities,82,83 which are worth considering in an application as stable catalyst supports.
2.3 Titanium diboride (TiB2)
TiB2 is another relatively new titanium based support which has been considered as base material for a range of technological applications. TiB2 ceramics obtain many superior properties, including high melting point, great hardness, good electrical, high thermal conductivity, excellent thermal stability and corrosion resistance in an acidic medium.84,85 In 2010, for the first time, our group reported TiB2 as a stable support for fuel cell catalysts.86 TiB2 powders prepared by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), were uniform, and had a narrow size distribution. Pt/TiB2 was prepared by a colloid route, and the highly dispersed Pt NPs were stabilized by Nafion functional polymer, which significantly facilitates the dispersion of Pt NPs on TiB2. An improvement of ORR activity was observed in terms of onset potential. The Pt/TiB2 showed a more reduced current density of 0.29 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V as compared to Pt/C (0.11 mA cm−2 at 0.9 V) with the same Pt loading, because the SO3− end groups in the polyelectrolyte chain structure of Nafion can facilitate the reaction species transfer process for ORR. Furthermore, it was found that the electrochemical stability of Pt/TiB2 catalyst is about four times higher than that of Pt/C under electrochemical oxidation cycles in the potential range of 0.6–1.2 V. The perfluorosulfonic acid serving as both a proton-conducting polymer and a stabilizer was also employed to coat the surface of TiB2 before depositing Pt NPs.87 Pt/TiB2 was much more stable than that of Pt/C, which is attributed to the excellent stability of TiB2 support and the stabilization effect of Nafion. The above studies show a scenario for the TiB2 ceramics as an alternative support for fuel cell catalysts.
Other stable nano-metal boride ceramics, including ZrB2, MB6 (M = Ca, Ba, Sr, La, etc.) have been reported.88–90 Among them, ZrB2 possesses metal-like electrical conductivity and high resistance against wear and oxidation,91 which is most promising in fuel cell catalyst supports.
3 Improving the electric conductivity of ceramics by hybridizing supports
Nano-ceramic supports possess excellent resistance to electrochemical oxidation and stability in acidic environment, which prompts consideration of the nano-ceramic as alternative catalyst support. However, the low electrical conductivity of some ceramic materials may prevent their extensive application in fuel cells, because of its negative effects on catalytic activity. Therefore, it is of importance to develop new nano-ceramic supports, which can not only enhance the electrochemical stability of the catalysts, but can also improve their catalytic performance. Therefore, hybridized support systems combining nano-ceramic and carbon supports or doping metal elements into the nano-ceramic supports have been developed.
3.1 Hybrid supports by introducing carbon
Carbon has also been introduced into ceramic supports-based catalysts by a physically combined method, to improve catalytic activity by increasing electrical conductivity. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a popular material with many desirable properties, including high thermal conductivity and stability in acidic and oxidative environments.92–94 However, the low electrical conductivity of nano-SiC inhibits its application in fuel cell catalyst supports. Although, Pt NPs were homogeneously dispersed on the surface of SiC supports with a particle size of about 3 nm,95 the low ECSA (12 m2 g−1) of the Pt/SiC was not in accordance with the more homogenous dispersion of Pt NPs. After the carbon was introduced into the Pt/SiC, the ECSA of Pt/SiC/C catalysts greatly increased to 48 m2 g−1 which is comparable to that of Pt/C (62 m2 g−1). This indicates that the poor electrical conductivity of nano-ceramic materials can be greatly improved by adding carbon. This hybrid catalyst also showed higher stability than Pt/C due to the excellent stability of SiC support. There was only 8.9% of the initial ECSA of Pt/C remained, whereas 22.5% of the initial ECSA of Pt/SiC/C remained after 4000 cycles. In addition, such catalyst, with similar ORR activity to Pt/C catalysts, showed higher stability of ORR than that of the latter, which was remarkably consistent with the ECSA loss as mentioned above. Therefore, the addition of carbon in a ceramic supported catalyst supplies a possibility to synthesize an advance catalyst with high electrocatalytic performance and stability.
In order to further improve the electrical conductivity of nano-SiC, the SiC@C core shell structure support was developed for fuel cell catalysts. The SiC@C was prepared by graphitization of nano-SiC using vacuum annealing treatment, and then the Pt NPs were dispersed on the SiC@C hybrid support via a microwave-assisted reduction method. The Pt/SiC@C catalysts exhibited higher stability and much better catalytic activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ORR in comparison to conventional Pt/C catalysts.96 Morgen et al.97 also synthesized nano-SiC supports with high electric conductivity using nano-porous carbon black as a template. The novel nano-SiC based catalysts showed higher catalytic activity than conventional Pt/C catalysts, which opens up a new era of nano-SiC ceramics as fuel cell catalyst supports.
Further, the electrical conductivity and activity of the catalyst can be further enhanced using advanced nano-carbon materials (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotube/nanofibers) or optimizing the architectures between the nano-ceramics and the nano-carbon.98,99 Song et al. reported the ultra-long Pt nanolawns supported on TiO2-coated carbon nanofibers as 3D hybrid catalyst for methanol oxidation, which showed great potential as the active anode in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).99
3.2 Hybrid supports by doping metal elements
Titanium oxides as alternative support materials for fuel cell catalysts have been mentioned above due to their good mechanical resistance and stability in acidic and oxidative environments.100–102 However, their universal low electrical conductivity prevents their practical application in fuel cell catalysts. Different elements, such as vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta), have been introduced into TiO2 to help improve the electrical conductivity. Among them, Nb is the most promising dopant because of similarity in the ionic radii between Nb5+ and Ti4+ resulting in almost no lattice distortion.103–105 Popov et al. reported the rutile phase Nb-doped titanium oxide (NbxTi(1−x)O2) as a cathode catalyst support and investigated its stability and activity in fuel cell conditions.106 The Pt/NbxTi(1−x)O2 catalyst showed comparable ORR activity to that of Pt/C. The Pt/C lost 96% of its initial activity (from 3.18 to 0.13 mA cm−2) at 0.85 V after 2500 linear potential cycles, whereas there was only 59% loss for Pt/NbxTi(1−x)O2. Meanwhile, the Pt/NbxTi(1−x)O2 showed nearly ten-fold higher ORR activity than Pt/C catalyst after the potential cycling experiment. Fuel cell testing showed that the Pt/NbxTi(1−x)O2-based had only a small voltage loss after 3000 cycles. In contrast, there was no activity remained for the conventional Pt/C catalyst after 1000 cycles because of severe oxidation of carbon and subsequent disintegration of the catalyst layer. The experiment demonstrated that the Nb doped NbxTi(1−x)O2 support is a new promising approach for improving the performance and durability of fuel cell catalysts.
ITO is a degenerated crystalline structure semiconductor with a wide band gap, and formed by substitutional doping of In2O3 with Sn which replaces In3+ atoms in the cubic bixbyite structure of indium oxide. ITO also possesses the special qualities of optically transparency and electrical conductivity, and has long been used as a transparent electrode in organic light emitting diodes and solar cells.107–109 Chhina et al., for the first time, reported the effects of catalytic activity and stability of Pt/ITO using ITO as catalyst support.110 Pt/ITO catalysts were prepared via a reflux method, in which Pt NPs were dispersed on commercially available ITO, and both the thermal and electrochemical stability were compared with that of conventional Pt/C catalysts. The crystallite sizes calculated from XRD were 38 and 13 nm for ITO and Pt NPs, respectively. The Pt/ITO presented significantly enhanced stability over Pt/C after an oxidation cycle between +0.6 and +1.8 V, and hydrogen desorption peaks in the CVs existed even after 100 cycles for Pt/ITO. In contrast, most of the active surface area was lost after 100 cycles for Pt/C, which indicates that the ITO support catalyst has a lower ECSA loss under accelerated voltage cycling.
Recently, Mustain et al. reported that ITO NPs were conceived as a high catalytic activity and durability support for Pt NPs.111 To prepare ITO NPs, indium acetylacetonate (In(acac)3) and tin bis-(acetylacetonate) dichloride (Sn(acac)2Cl2) with variable ratios were decomposed in oleylamine at 250 °C for 3 h. Pt NPs were deposited on the surface of ITO through galvanic displacement of Cu by Pt. The ECSA of Pt was determined to be 83.1 m2 g−1 for Pt/ITO, which was about three times that of Pt/C (27.3 m2 g−1). The electron transfer number was calculated to be about 3.9 at 0.6–0.85 V from the sops of Koutecky–Levich plots, illustrating a 4e− oxygen reduction process. The Pt/ITO catalyst had ORR specific activity of 0.750 mA cm2 at 0.9 V, which was 3 times that of Pt/C (0.235 mA cm2). On the other hand, after normalization to the loading amount of Pt metal, the mass activity of Pt/ITO was about 4 times that of Pt/C (Fig. 3). The higher catalytic activity of Pt/ITO is likely caused by synergistic effects between the surface Sn of ITO and the supported Pt NPs. The stability of both Pt/ITO and the conventional Pt/C was investigated by applying potential sweeps at the rate of 10 mV s−1 to a thin-film rotating disk electrode in an O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4. The half-wave potential of the Pt/ITO showed only a cathodic shift of approximately 4 mV in a mixed kinetic diffusion controlled region after 1000 cycles. In comparison, the shift in the half-wave potential for Pt/C was 20 mV. After the stability test, the Pt/ITO showed almost no recordable loss of Pt ECSA. In contrast, the Pt/C catalyst retained only 65% of the initial ECSA after the potential cycling. Therefore, the ITO has a potential as oxidation-resistant material candidate as a catalyst support in PEMFCs.

3.3 Hybrid supports by introducing nano-ceramics into carbon supports
Recently, our group developed a novel strategy for improving the stability of Pt/C catalyst using a zirconia (ZrO2)–carbon hybrid as Pt NPs support. The hybrid support not only showed the excellent stability of ceramic supports, but showed the superior electrical conductivity of carbon supports.112 For the Pt/ZrO2–C, firstly the Pt/C catalyst was synthesized through an ethylene glycol reduction method, and then a nano-ZrO2 shell with excellent thermal, chemical and electrochemical stability was introduced into the Pt/C by isothermal hydrolysis of the ZrOCl2·8H2O aqueous solution at low temperature. The nano-ZrO2 shell can not only inhibit the migration and aggregation of Pt NPs by inhabiting the undecorated surface of the carbon supports, but can also dramatically protect the carbon support from chemical and electrochemical corrosion. After 2500 cycles, the Pt/C catalysts retained only 14% of the initial ECSA (from 63 to 9 m2 g−1). Although some loss of ECSA (from 51 to 22 m2 g−1) on Pt/ZrO2–C was observed, the Pt/ZrO2–C showed higher retention (41%) of ECSA compared with the Pt/C. On the other hand, the ORR activities of both the Pt/ZrO2–C and Pt/C catalysts were similar, illustrating a very limited impact of ZrO2 on the catalytic activity of Pt NPs catalysts. This work represents a novel and significant strategy for functionalizing the nanocatalyst support with remarkably high stability which has great potential application in fuel cells.
The Pd/ZrC–C and Pd/ZrO2–C catalysts with zirconium compounds ZrC or ZrO2 and carbon hybrids as novel supports for formic acid fuel cell catalysts have also been reported.113 They showed higher activity and stability than that of the Pd/C catalyst for formic acid electrooxidation because of the inherently excellent mechanical resistance of zirconium compounds (ZrC and ZrO2), and metal–support interaction. Similarly, TiC–C and TiO2–C hybrid materials as Pd NPs supports for formic acid electrooxdation have also been reported.114 The addition of Ti compounds significantly increased the catalytic and stability of Pd NPs for formic acid electrooxidation due to the outstanding oxidation, acid corrosion resistance of TiC and TiO2 supports and the synergistic effect between Pd NPs and the supports.
Wang et al. firstly grew ITO NPs on functionalized graphene sheets to form an ITO–graphene hybrid and studied their application as a catalyst support.115 Pt–ITO–graphene was synthesized via polyol processes. DFT calculations were also conducted to understand the preferential bonding of Pt NPs with both graphene support and ITO NPs at the triple junction points, and suggested that the defects and functional groups on graphene help improve the stability of the catalysts. The stability of the catalysts was measured by continuously applying linear potential sweeps. As can be seen in Fig. 4, there was only 14 mV degradation in half-wave potential for the Pt–ITO–graphene after potential sweeps; in contrast, the Pt–graphene revealed a remarkable negative shift 40 mV degradation. The ECSA of both catalysts was also calculated before and after ADT, and its loss of Pt–graphene was 62%, whereas the Pt–ITO–graphene only degraded by 45%. As respected, these results were remarkably consistent with the ORR activity results. This study developed a new approach for combining the metal catalyst, metal oxide, and carbon materials.

4 Improving the catalytic activity by synergistic effects
Nano-ceramic supports can not only improve the stability of the catalysts but can also enhance the catalytic activity and CO/SO2 poisoning resistance of the catalysts by synergistic effects between the metal catalyst and nano-ceramic supports.
4.1 Improve the ORR activity
Shen et al. reported the bimetallic carbide Co6Mo6C2 supported on graphitic carbon (Co6Mo6C2/gC), prepared by an anion-exchange method, and further used it as supports for Pt NPs.116 The Pt–Co6Mo6C2/gC catalyst showed higher ORR activity in comparison with the Pt/C catalyst. Its half-wave potential exhibited a significantly more positive shift of 80 mV than that of the Pt/C, which indicates that such support promotes the ORR kinetics due to a synergistic effect between the Co6Mo6C2 support and active Pt NPs. Meanwhile, the catalyst exhibited 271.7 A gpt−1 at 0.9 V, which was 2.5 times higher than that of the Pt/C (108.6 A gpt−1). Also, a higher stability than that of the Pt/C catalysts after the linear sweeping cycles, was found. There was only a 6 mV shift negative for the catalyst in the half-wave potential, while the degradation of 27 mV was observed for the Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 5). With a similar synergistic effect, the Pd/WC–Mo2C/C was prepared and showed superior activity for ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation, which is almost ten times higher than that of the Pd/C. The above findings indicate that bimetallic transition-metal carbide can be potential support for fuel cell catalysts.

CeO2 has been intensely studied for solid oxide fuel cells and catalytic applications due to its rich oxygen vacancies and low redox potential via the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycle.117–119 CeO2 can also be a promoter for improving the ORR activity and durability of Pt/C catalysts. Lee et al. developed an effective method for preparing highly dispersed CeO2 NPs on Pt/C catalyst.120 In the ORR tests, Pt–CeO2/C exhibited higher kinetic current density and a positive shift of half-wave potential compared to the Pt/C catalysts. The stability of the catalytic activity was also tested by performing linear potential sweeps, and the Pt–CeO2/C showed only 20 mV degradation after 1000 cycles. On the other hand, Pt/C catalysts showed an obvious positive shift of 72 mV in half-wave potentials. Moreover, the ECSA of Pt–CeO2/C decreased from 49 to 43 m2 g−1 (about 11%) after 1000 cycles, indicating no considerable decrease of Pt active surface area; while the ECSA of Pt/C decreased from 42 to 28 m2 g−1 (about 33%), which indicated that the Pt–CeO2/C catalyst was significantly more durable as compared to the Pt/C catalyst in fuel cell conditions.
4.2 Improving the activity by ordered nano-ceramic supports
Currently, highly oriented nanostructured electrodes with a one-dimensional structure have attracted more attention because of a significantly increased surface area and unique physicochemical properties.121–123 For instance, Debe et al.121 reported that the unique nanostructured thin film (NSTF) electrode consisting of oriented nano-sized crystalline organic whiskers can improve the specific activity of the catalysts as well as reduce the loss of ECSA. Among the oriented supports, TiO2 nanotube (TNT) arrays have been wildly used due to their high stability under fuel cell operating conditions, large surface-to-volume ratio and strong synergistic effects between the metal and the metal oxides.124–126 The highly ordered TNT arrays with a high specific surface area are potential supports for fuel cell catalysts (see Fig. 6). Hydrogenation significantly improving the electrochemical performance of TNTs when using as catalyst supports was demonstrated. The ordered TNT electrode showed excellent durability during ADTs.125 The decrease of the ECSA was only 36% after 1000 cycles as compared to 68% for the Pt/C electrode after 800 cycles. The ordered TNT electrode also exhibited excellent power density reaching 500 and 88 mW cm−2, respectively. This research could open up new opportunities for TNT materials in fuel cells as well as in other energy devices.

4.3 Improving the CO and SO2 poisoning resistance
Hitherto, low content of CeO2 has been used to improve the CO and SO2 poisoning resistance for the traditional Pt/C catalysts.127 Different ratio of CeO2 up to 6% was introduced to the Pt/C catalyst by a moderate method. The loss of active sites for hydrogen adsorption/desorption on Pt surfaces was negligible when 2 and 4% of CeO2 were present in the catalyst, resulting in almost no performance compromise. Significantly, the SO2 and CO tolerance of the prepared catalysts were also measured by the CV method. Almost 50 mV negative shift of the onset potential was observed for SO2 oxidation in the presence of 2 and 4 wt% CeO2, which indicates that SO2 oxidation was promoted in the presence of CeO2. Meanwhile, the enhancement towards CO oxidation was examined by CO stripping, and the onset potential for the CO oxidation also had a negative shift with the increased CeO2 amount, indicating that the high concentration of surface oxygen vacancies of the CeO2 can enhance the oxygen diffusion and spillover, and hence assist the CO oxidation on Pt surfaces.
Boron carbide (B4C), as one of the most stable carbides due to its low density and high stable in acidic solution, has been widely used in wear resistant, armor and neutron absorber materials.128–130 B4C is also expected as alternative support for the fuel cell catalyst, because it can promote catalytic activity through synergistic effects.131,132 Recently, the Pt/B4C catalyst was synthesized and showed greatly enhanced MOR activity and CO tolerance than that of Pt/C catalyst.133 The catalyst showed a very high peak current density of 63 mA cm−2, which was nearly twice that of Pt/C catalysts (37 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C catalyst had the most negative onset potential shift for the MOR and CO tolerance as compared to that of the Pt/C, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process. These results suggest promising applications for the nano-B4C as the next generation catalyst support for fuel cells.
NbC NWs with high electrical conductivity and outstanding resistance of oxidation, were synthesized through a bamboo-based carbon-thermal method and used as alternative supports of Pt NPs for DMFCs.134 The Pt/NbC NWs catalysts exhibited very high peak current density of 766.1 mA mg−1 Pt, which was more than 3 times that of Pt/C (221.7 mA mg−1 Pt). Meanwhile, the onset and peak potential of the Pt/NbC NWs showed a larger negative shift, which indicated that the NbC NWs supports can effectively reduce the overpotential due to a synthetic effect between the Pt NPs and supports. There was only 2.4% loss of the peak current density for the Pt/NbC NWs after 200 linear sweeping cycles, while the Pt/C showed almost 19.4% loss after the same number of cycles. The above results indicate that the NbC NWs are a promising application as catalyst supports for DMFCs or another electrocatalytic field.
Tungsten-based nano-ceramic materials have also attracted much attention as alternative support for fuel cell catalysts due to their chemical and electrochemical activities and synergistic effect for many reactions. WC and WOx can help enhance the catalytic activity for ORR and MOR, and improve the CO and sulfur tolerance.135–139 Shen et al. firstly developed the PdFe–WC/C catalyst for direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) with enhanced alcohol-tolerant ORR activity due to the synergistic effect between the PdFe NPs and WC supports.140 The PdFe–WC/C exhibited an obvious positive shift in half-wave potential for ORR than that of the PdFe/C and comparative performance to that of the Pt/C. The effect of alcohol on the PdFe–WC/C and Pt/C as a benchmark was also performed (Fig. 7). The ORR activity of Pt/C was totally restrained because the alcohol oxidation is the dominant reaction in the presence of CH3OH or C2H5OH. In contrast, the PdFe–WC/C was hardly affected even when an alcohol concentration was up to 1.0 mol L−1. Therefore, the synergistic effect between PdFe NPs and WC supports makes PdFe–WC/C alternative catalysts for the ORR in the presence of alcohol and promising Pt-free cathodic catalysts for DAFCs.

Recently, WOx was adopted to modify Pt catalysts with the aim of acquiring sulfur tolerance.28 A different ratio of WOx was introduced to the Pt/C catalyst by a moderate method. Electrochemical test results showed that catalysts with WOx doping exhibited excellent sulfur tolerance compared to traditional Pt/C catalysts. The catalyst with 5 wt% WOx exhibited the best sulfur tolerance due to a synergistic effect between WOx and Pt where the OH group was generated on the hydrophilic surface of WOx, and the hydrogen spillover effect on WOx plays an important role in the oxidation of SOx. Meanwhile, the enhanced ORR activity of WOx–Pt/C was also demonstrated by a higher half-wave potential and lower amounts of H2O2 formation.
Another potential approach of low-cost WC-based catalysts is that WC supports are coated by one atomic layer or monolayer (ML) of Pt metal. Chen et al. described promising ML PT/WC catalysts and discussed the approaches to overcome limitations based on a better understanding of the Pt–WC interface and its behavior in electrochemical environment.141 This is a perspective not only for the combination of Pt and WC, but other combinations of metals and nano-ceramic materials have great potential to be used as low-cost and stable catalysts for fuel cells and various clean energy devices.
4.4 Synergistic effect by co-catalyst function
Nano-ceramic materials have also been reported which possess ORR activity themselves and can improve the ORR activity of metal NPs after combining with metal NPs in alkaline solution.142,143 Shen et al. reported that a W2C nanocrystal modified Pt catalyst (Pt–W2C/C) with enhanced ORR activity than the Pt/C. The results revealed that both W2C and Pt/C were active for the ORR in alkaline media. However, the overpotential of Pt–W2C/C was significantly reduced as compared to P/C, which showed a synergic effect to improve the ORR activity by the co-catalyst function. The Pt–W2C/C also exhibited catalysts potential applications in anion exchange membrane hydrogen or alcohol fuel cells, alcohol monitors and metal–air batteries due to their unique properties of selectivity and immunity to methanol. The nano-ceramic RuO2 as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalyst has also been mixed with the ORR catalyst to enhance the oxidation of water/OH− to oxygen and provide protection of other redox active species at high cathode potential. The ECSA loss of Pt catalyst was almost 100%, whereas in the presence of the RuO2 co-catalyst it was reduced to 30–35%.144 Moreover, the addition of RuO2·xH2O into Pt/C catalyst increases single cell performance but also dramatically improves the dynamic response performance, revealing that it can buffer the voltage undershoot whenever the current increases instantly.145 The application of co-catalyst improves the catalytic activity and stability of traditional catalysts, showing great potential application in fuel cells and other industrial fields.
5 Summary and outlook
Carbon supports for the metal NPs catalysts are susceptible to corrosion under harsh chemical and electrochemical oxidation conditions in fuel cells including acidic electrolyte (pH < 1) and high operating potential (up to 1.2 V). The nano-ceramic materials have been considered as alternative support materials to replace traditional carbon supports due to their unique mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability, and outstanding oxidation and acid corrosion resistance. This work has reviewed recently significant progress in using nano-ceramic materials as the supports of low temperature fuel cell catalysts. Such novel nano-ceramic supports can improve the stability of the catalyst as expected, and simultaneously enhance its catalytic activity and CO/SO2 poisoning resistance by synergistic effects between the metal catalyst and nano-ceramic support. Although the potential application of nano-ceramic supports has been demonstrated, the practical one is limited because of their low conductivity. So, future efforts should be focused on the following aspects. Firstly, to further improve the stability of the catalyst by developing more stable nano-scale ceramic supports with a high specific surface area, which can increase the adsorption capability of metal NPs on supports to get homogeneously dispersed catalysts. At the same time, different shapes of nano-ceramic supports, such as nanowires and nanotubes, are also desired, not only confined to the common nano-spherical structure. For example, the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays with high specific surface areas are potential supports for fuel cell catalysts. Secondly, cost reduction is important for the fuel cell industry. Enhancing the catalytic activity by synergistic effects between the metal nanoparticles and nano-ceramic supports, and reducing the usage of Pt NPs by coating one atomic layer or ML of Pt metal on nano-ceramic supports are also potential strategies. Thirdly, conductivity of the nano-ceramic supports is very important for the performance of metal catalysts, so developing novel pure or composite metal-like nano-ceramic supports (e.g., ZrB2, ZrB2–SiC, ZrB2–B4C) with superior resistance to oxidation is a potential direction for their wide application. On the other hand, hybrid support systems consisting of metal element doping nano-ceramic supports and combining nano-ceramic and nanocarbon supports (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanofibres), are also promising solutions to this problem. To further enhance the catalytic activity, tolerance of harmful gases, and water management to increase the volumetric specific power of the fuel cell stack, the elevated temperature fuel cell (<200 °C) is a potential trend. However, the corrosion of conventional carbon supports can be further exacerbated. Hence, nano-ceramic materials can be an important alternative support due to their unique mechanical properties, conductivity, superior oxidation and acid corrosion resistance.
