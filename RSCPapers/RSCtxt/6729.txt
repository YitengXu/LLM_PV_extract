    First published on 10th March 2020AbstractThe design and development of crystalline porous materials (CPMs), including metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent–organic frameworks (COFs), have been subjects of extensive study due to their regular crystalline lattices and well-defined pore structures. In recent times, an enormous amount of research effort has gone into using CPMs as sacrificial templates to fabricate electrochemically functional materials. The inherently electrochemically active sites inside CPMs are notably abundant and being explored with respect to electrochemical reactions. In this review, electrochemically active sites and the space around them (metal ions, ligands, crystal structures, pores, and morphologies) inside CPMs are the focus and recent progress in the fields of metal-ion batteries, metal–air batteries, water splitting, and other related electrochemical devices has been summarized. Overall, this review provides guidance on the preparation of electroactive CPMs via rational design and modulation of active sites such as redox-active metal clusters and organic ligands, and the space around the electrochemically active sites, and their applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.

1. Introduction
In recent times, with the continuous consumption of non-renewable fossil sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas, pursuing innovative renewable energy techniques to address critical energy issues has become particularly significant. Newly developed, emerging electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, including metal-ion/air batteries (where “metal” can be typically lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminum, or zinc), supercapacitors, fuel cells, and solar cells, have attracted increasing attention and achieved encouraging success. Even though there are different operating mechanisms, all energy storage and conversion devices have similar device configurations, consisting of two electrodes and an electrolyte/separator, which aid the successful operation of electrochemical reactions in metal-ion batteries, metal–air batteries, metal–CO2 batteries, fuel cells, water splitting, and the ionic transport and prevention of electronic conduction in electrolytes.1 Presently, all above-mentioned electrochemical energy storage and conversion techniques face diverse issues. For example, among metal-ion batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) face availability and cost issues, arising from the shortage of lithium, and safety issues, while post-LIB systems (sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries) mainly lack reasonable longevity and ionic reversibility due to larger ionic diameters than lithium ions. For metal–air batteries and fuel cells, sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen reactions involving the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction severely restrict battery performance. For metal–CO2 batteries, three problems, including large polarization between the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, poor reversibility of the recharge process, and capacity fading during cycling, limit further application. In addition, water splitting, as a novel energy conversion technique, also labors under a poor hydrogen evolution reaction rate and a more sluggish and challenging oxygen evolution reaction. A number of drawbacks of the energy storage and conversion equipment slow their further development. Generally, the performances of these devices are primarily driven by the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of functional materials used in their components. Therefore, searching for high-performance and reliable materials for future energy storage and conversion systems is critical in the field of materials science.
Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have received considerable attention as functional materials and achieved great progress in synthesis and applications in recent years.2–5 They are constructed by atomically integrating organic units with one another through strong covalent bonds or metal ions/clusters via coordination interactions. Commonly, CPMs typically include porous coordination polymers (CPs) containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent–organic frameworks (COFs), and metal–organic polyhedra (MOPs). Due to the advantages of tunable structure, excellent chemical stability, easy fabrication and feasible hybridization with other components, CPMs have become promising candidates for electrochemical energy-related applications (Fig. 1). In energy storage and conversion applications, the structural properties that make CPMs attractive for implementation in electrochemical devices consist of the following: (1) metal ions/clusters or organic linkers are able to serve as electrochemically active sites to facilitate electrochemical and electrolytic reactions on electrodes. Moreover, in separator systems, coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUMs) or characteristic organic groups can directly or indirectly bind alkali metal ions for high ion transport; (2) porous and open channel structures are able to promote the penetration of electrolytes and strong adsorption of ions and gas molecules while alleviating the mechanical stress/strain caused by the electrochemical reaction; (3) high surface area provides a significant amount of large interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes, enhancing electrochemical activity and kinetics. Particularly, rational design and construction of active sites in CPMs are critical in determining the performance, which can, thereby, further highlight applications in energy-related electrochemical systems.

In recent years, many review articles have been published on strategies used to design and develop MOF-, COF-, CP-, and POM-based functional materials for energy storage and conversion.6–11 However, few reviews focus on the electrochemically active sites in CPMs. In this review, the functional structures of CPMs and their effects on the performance of energy storage and conversion devices are summarized and briefly discussed. Recent advances in CPMs for energy storage and conversion systems (metal-ion batteries, metal–air batteries, fuel cells and water splitting) and other related electrochemical devices will be introduced from the viewpoint of functionally-oriented design of electrochemically active sites, including metal ions/clusters and redox-active organic linkers, the space around active sites (including morphologies, pores, crystal structure, etc.), and other aspects of improvement (Fig. 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review focusing on electrochemically active sites of CPMs for energy applications. It is believed that this review will provide comprehensive guidance on the design and development of electroactive CPMs and promote their applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.

2. Electrochemically active sites in CPMs for metal-ion batteries
In recent years, LIBs have become promising energy storage devices because of their high energy density, long cycle life, and improved safety performance, which all enable mature manufacturing technology and large-scale applicability. Various materials have been optimized to increase energy storage and conversion efficiency. Functional inorganic materials are commonly used in lithium storage systems due to their high chemical stability. However, it is still very challenging to prepare purely inorganic materials, and their synthesis can consume energy and generate carbon emissions and generate the problems of cost and environmental concerns. In addition, for electrode materials, only a limited number of metals can exhibit the desired properties related to molar mass and attainable potential. Therefore, from these standpoints, inorganic electrode materials face great challenges for further improvement, especially in terms of cathodes. Comparatively, organic materials have drawn increasing attention in recent years and are regarded as promising candidates for next-generation electrode materials because of beneficial characteristics, such as diverse molecular structures and multiredox organic groups. However, there are some challenges for organic materials, such as low redox potential, high solubility in electrolytes, and low conductivity. Therefore, it is of great importance to address these issues for large-scale energy storage applications. Assembling small organic molecules/metal sites to form ordered networks in CPMs is a promising strategy to solve these key issues, namely, solubility and conductivity. Also, abundant and designed channels and pores make the utmost of metallic/organic redox sites. In this section, as multifunctional porous materials, CPMs (especially MOFs and COFs) have been applied to LIBs and post-LIBs (sodium-ion batteries and potassium-ion batteries) and are highlighted for the first time.
2.1 CPMs as cathodes
Cathode materials are important for the success of high-performance rechargeable batteries in terms of energy density, cycling stability, and cost effectiveness. To fulfill the requirement of large-scale energy storage systems, they should also satisfy other properties, such as high voltage (vs. Li/Li+), favorable electrochemical stability in the ion insertion/extraction process, and low pollution.12 However, in general, the specific capacities of cathodes are barely satisfactory, which can induce bottlenecks preventing metal-ion batteries from attaining increased energy density at this time. For example, in commercial LIBs, cathodes possess much lower specific capacities (∼200 mA h g−1) than anodes (above 380 mA h g−1, up to 1000 mA h g−1). Therefore, improving the specific capacity of cathodes is essential for further improvements in metal-ion batteries. Currently, numerous efforts on CPM-based cathodes have been focused on improving the electrode voltage and building multiredox sites for achieving high specific capacity.

2.1.1. Redox-active sites. 
Introducing redox metal sites into CPMs is an efficient approach to achieve high-capacity cathode materials. Initially, MOFs were investigated as cathode materials in LIBs due to analogous redox pairing with traditional inorganic cathodes, which usually show higher electrode potentials than organic cathodes. In 2007, Tarascon et al. first reported a MIL-53 [Fe(OH)0.8F0.2(O2CC6H4CO2)] material, in which the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair exhibited reversible redox activity at ∼3.0 V vs. Li/Li+.13 Though the MIL-53 cathode showed a low gravimetric capacity of 75 mA h g−1 and irreversible conversion/decomposition of the solid towards Li, the redox metal sites in CPMs opened many new opportunities for cathodic applications. Soon afterwards, Vittal and co-workers reported a V4+/V5+ redox couple in a crystalline metal–organic-phosphate open framework (K2.5[(VO)2(HPO4)1.5(PO4)0.5(C2O4)]) exhibiting an ultrahigh potential of 4.0 V vs. Li/Li+, higher than that of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) (3.4 V).14 When evaluated as the cathode material in LIBs, it showed a reversible specific capacity of 66 mA h g−1, extremely close to the one-electron theoretical capacity of V4+/V5+. Nishihara and co-workers reported a bis-(diimino)nickel framework (NiDI) cathode, possessing a faradaic-reaction-driven mechanism, undergoing four-electron transfers per Ni center during the discharge–charge process (Fig. 3a).15Via ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, it was found that the counterions preferentially located in the pores of the NiDI and the injected electrons were relatively localized around Ni atoms during the NiDI reduction (Fig. 3b). The unique Ni-induced multielectron-transfer property not only enabled NiDI with a high capacity of 155 mA h g−1 but also improved the cycling stability in the LIBs to 300 cycles. Subsequently, various multi-valence metal sites in CPMs have been investigated, exhibiting reversible conversions under high voltage in rechargeable batteries, such as Cu+/Cu2+16 and Fe2+/Fe3+.17

In general, active organic groups in ligands are more stable than the metal nodes at the junctions of networks during redox reactions, resulting in high reversibility and perfect Coulombic efficiency (CE). Thus, various redox-active organic groups have been used in assembling ligands of CPMs to improve capacity. Currently, organic compounds including N-containing heterocyclic compounds, radical compounds, and carbonyl compounds have been reported as electroactive cathode materials for metal-ion batteries.18 When assembled in CPMs, they usually exhibit higher stability than monomers, and the robust CPM networks facilitate the electrolyte-ion diffusion. Naphthalene diimides (NDINAs) have been found to exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as cathode materials as the carbonyl groups directly conjugated with aromatic rings can form multivalent anions.19,20 Jiang et al. reported a redox-active COF/carbon nanotube (CNTs) composite, containing redox-active carbonyl groups in the NDINA linkers. The electrochemical analysis indicated that the two-electron-involved redox activity of the carbonyl groups in NDINA units is reversible. Subsequently, our group reported two crystalline COFs using NDINA as the reactive conjugated backbones and investigated the impacts of the COF conjugated backbone on the electrochemical performance of redox-active NDINA.21 Both COFs exhibited good rate performance and high CE values when used as LIB cathodes. Despite their high stability, a key challenge in using CPM cathodes is how to promote the redox reactions of organic groups to achieve high specific capacity. Li et al. built abundant carbonyl groups in a microporous two-dimensional (2D) COF (poly(imide-benzoquinone), PIBN-G), as shown in Fig. 4a.22 Upon analyzing in situ FTIR spectra and ex situ13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, it was confirmed that the CO bonds of the imide and quinone units in PIBN interacted with eight Li+ and two Li+, respectively, in the discharge/charge process, as depicted in Fig. 4b and c. Therefore, the reversible specific capacities of the PIBN-G cathode had greatly increased (271.0 mA h g−1 and 193.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 10C, respectively). Feng and co-workers selected hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN) integrated with rich redox-active CN groups as linkers to build N-rich 2D conjugated frameworks (CCP-HATN). Benefitting from this structure, CCP-HATN delivered a high utilization of reactive sites (accepting six Li+ per CN group), thus exhibiting high reversible capacity when used as the cathode.

When multiple sites exist on CPMs (both metal sites and active organic groups), outstanding gravimetric capacity can be achieved. Awaga and co-workers selected 2,7-anthraquinonedicarboxylic acid (2,7-AQDC) as a ligand to build a Cu(2,7-AQDC) MOF, in which anthraquinone (AQ) had shown a two-electron reversible redox in LIBs (Fig. 3c).23 As revealed by in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis and cyclic voltammetry, both Cu2(Ac)4 paddlewheels and 2,7-AQDC ligands in the Cu(2,7-AQDC) MOF afforded redox reactions in the lithium storage process, as shown in Fig. 3d.23 In the same way, Peng et al. reported a MOF of Cu-TCA (H3TCA = tricarboxytriphenyl amine) with the coexistence of redox-active metal clusters (Cu+/Cu2+) and organic ligand radicals (N/N+), as revealed by ex situ XPS and cyclic voltammetry.
In comparing sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (KIBs), the most notable difficulty arises from the larger ionic radius (Na: 0.97 Å, K: 1.38 Å), which leads to a significant reduction in the available insertion sites and diffusion channels for sodium or potassium ions in the crystalline host lattices compared with similar Li insertion compounds. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs, A2M[Fe(CN)6], A = alkali metal; M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) are preferred to host sodium and potassium ions due to their large ionic channels and interstitial spaces in the lattice.24 Two redox sites, M2+/3+ and Fe2+/3+, per molecule of PBA suggest that PBAs can potentially reach a two-electron redox capacity. It was reported that Na2Fe[Fe(CN)6] can release a considerably high capacity of ≈160 mA h g−1 with a high potential of 3.1 V vs. Na+/Na, corresponding to a high energy density of 496 W h kg−1.25 By partially or completely substituting Fe using other redox-active transition metals, the electrochemical performances of PBA cathodes can be conveniently tuned and further improved. High capacities and energy densities of PBA cathodes enable stronger competitiveness than the commercial LiFePO4 cathodes (≈530 W h kg−1) in LIBs, possibly offering a promising alternative to metal-ion battery cathodes. Many related PBAs have been reported exhibiting excellent performance, such as anhydrous Na2MnFe(CN)6,26 defect-suppressed Na2CoFe(CN)627 and K1.75Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.89 0.15H2O.28


2.1.2. The space around redox-active sites. 
To increase the use of active sites as mentioned above, the space around redox-active sites becomes a focus for high-performance metal-ion battery cathodes, with respect to porosity, morphology and size. First, the crystalline and porous structures of CPMs are vital parameters for electrochemical storage performances. Loh et al. designed a series of isostructural Cd-naphthalenediimide MOFs and investigated their electrochemical performance as cathode materials. These results show that the Cd-MOF with larger porosity induced a higher Li-ion diffusion coefficient than the nonporous complex.20 Second, morphological effects have been studied for the enhancement of energy storage performance in terms of reaction kinetics.29–31 As demonstrated recently, cathode materials with a yolk@frame structure or layer-like structure exhibit larger active surface and better ion-diffusion kinetics than their analogues with a bulk structure. Hu et al. synthesized a single crystal Ni–Fe PBA with a yolk@frame structure. Compared with the cubic Ni–Fe PBA, the yolk@frame Ni–Fe PBA possessed more interstitial sites and a shorter ion-diffusion path. Therefore, when used as a cathode in SIBs, it exhibited excellent cycling stability and better rate performance than cubic Ni–Fe PBA, especially at a high current density (Fig. 5a).32 Wang and co-workers prepared few-layered COFs by exfoliating bulk COFs rich in fully accessible redox-active sites (Fig. 5b).33 Compared with bulk COFs, the exfoliated COFs delivered faster kinetics as cathode materials in lithium storage, where the specific capacity can be increased to 210 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1.

2.2 CPMs as anodes
In metal-ion batteries, anode materials usually demand widely varied characteristics: lower chemical potential for high power density, excellent electronic/ionic conductivity, high reversible capacity, and long cycle life. First, MOFs have been used as anodes in LIBs due to their ability to provide ordered redox metal sites and channels for electrolyte-ion diffusion. In 2006, Chen et al. directly used MOF-177 as an anode material in LIBs for the first time. However, fast degradation led to poor cycling performance and was unsuitable for lithium storage.34 Nevertheless, this report provides new ideas for applications of MOFs in battery anodes, and numerous CPMs, including MOFs and COFs, have been investigated as anodes in energy storage systems. In this section, a number of influential factors are discussed such as metal sites, active organic groups, structure, morphology, porosity and conductivity. These factors should be considered separately and comprehensively when improving the electrochemical properties of anode materials.

2.2.1. Redox-active sites. 
Active sites, including metal sites and active organic groups, are of importance for the improvement of specific capacity. Research shows that various metal centers in CPMs can participate in metal-ion storage. Generally, with the same ligands, Mn-, Co-, and Ni-based MOFs have shown higher specific capacity because of their multi-valence characteristic compared with Cd-, Zn-, and Cr-based MOFs. Xu et al. fabricated two MOFs with the same coordination mode, [M(L)-(H2O)]n·2nH2O (M = Co or Cd, L = 5-amino-isophthalic acid).35 When applied as anodes in LIBs, Co(L) MOF delivered higher specific capacity (1185 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles) than Cd(L) MOF. Similarly, two MOFs (Mn2(NDC)2(DMF)2 and Cd2(NDC)2(DMF)2, NDC = 1,4-naphthalene dicarboxylate), with the same one-dimensional (1D) shape, were compared as anode materials in LIBs.36 The results indicate Mn2(NDC)2(DMF)2 exhibited higher specific capacity compared to Cd2(NDC)2(DMF)2. Hu et al. fabricated a Mn-based MOF (Mn-UMOFNs) and a Ni-based MOF (Ni-UMOFNs) with the same coordination mode (Fig. 6a).37 In comparison to Ni-UMOFNs, the Mn-UMOFNs exhibited higher reversible capacity (1187 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for 100 cycles) due to its thinner nanosheets and higher specific surface area. More importantly, the authors confirmed that the Mn centers participate in the lithiation–delithiation process via magnetic measurements, X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and soft X-ray spectroscopy (sXAS) (Fig. 6b). The change in magnetic susceptibilities and the high-spin Mn2+ ion signals demonstrate the occurrence of Mn0 during the Li-ion insertion process (Fig. 6d). Such findings are also in accordance with sXAS, which proves the rehybridization between O2p and Mn3d orbitals, the decrease in bond covalence upon discharging, and the following recovery of the local environment around oxygen upon charging (Fig. 6c). As a result, the authors proposed a redox-active mechanism showing that the discharge process above 0.5 V indicated the reduction of Mn2+ to Mn0, and the plateau below 0.5 V represented Li-ion interactions with coordinated oxygen atoms, as shown in Fig. 6e.

Introducing and integrating polar organic groups, such as CN and CO groups, and π-units into periodically ordered CPM frameworks is another approach to improve specific capacity, which have been considered as active sites in anode materials due to their excellent stabilities and specific mechanism. Unlike the cathodes mentioned above, organic components in anodes usually exhibit straight charge–discharge curves without an obvious charge–recharge platform. Early in their exploration, researchers attempted to find active organic sites and summarized regularities by comparing CPMs of similar structure and different functional groups.38,39 More recently, Wang and co-workers prepared few-layered 2D COFs consisting of CN and CC groups and CNTs through controlled growth strategies, as shown in Fig. 7a.40 Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ electrochemical analysis revealed the storage mechanism of one lithium ion per CN group and six lithium ions per benzene ring (CC) (up to 14 lithium storage for a COF monomer) (Fig. 7c–f), thereby delivering a highly reversible capacity of 1536 mA h g−1 and 500 sustained cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 7b). Similarly, Xin and co-workers reported a COF (polyanthraquinone-triazine)41 consisting of CN, CO, and benzene groups, while enabling a 17-electron redox reaction with Li per molecular unit. When evaluated as anodes in LIBs, the COF showed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1770 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and maintained a CE of ca. 100%. Huang and co-workers designed a wavy layered MOF of Zn-PTCA (zinc perylenetetracarboxylates),42 which showed stretched space between adjacent perylene planes, enabling aromatic rings activated as sodium storage sites. A high specific capacity of 357 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 of the Zn-PTCA electrode resulted from CO groups and aromatic rings involved in the sodium insertion processes, as proven by experiments and DFT calculations. Through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of EPR, XANES, and solid-state NMR, Lu et al. indicated that a 2D DAAQ-COF anode undergoes C–O and α-C radical intermediate formation and transformation during the sodium storage process.43 Due to the redox and tunable stability of radical intermediates in the 2D DAAQ-COF, it is considered to be a high capacity and stable anode for SIBs. Subsequently, Wang and co-workers also confirmed a potassium-storage mechanism on a boronic ester COF/CNTs, which showed the π-cation effect between π-electron clouds of benzene rings and potassium ions during the potassiation/depotassiation process.44

If both redox-active metal sites and organic groups participate in energy storage, both multiredox reaction and high capacity will be obtained. Cheng and co-workers prepared a 1D [Co1.5L(H2O)4]n MOF, (H3L = 4-hydroxypyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) and demonstrated that both the aromatic ligand and the Co center can participate in lithium storage simultaneously.45 By analyzing CVs and XPS, a reversible redox reaction between Co2+ and Co0 occurred at an average potential of 1.22 V during the discharge–charge process. In addition, another reversible redox reaction between carboxylate carbonyl and enolate groups occurred at an average potential of 0.8 V. Wang et al. reported a 1D π-d conjugated coordination polymer (Ni-BTA),46 which underwent a three-electron reaction in the sodium intercalation process. CN double bonds and Ni2+ in the Ni-BTA reversibly transferred to C–N and Ni+, respectively, which was proved by XPS spectra, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Raman spectra. Through electrochemical analysis, the specific capacity of the Ni-BTA anode can reach 420 mA hg−1 with CE approaching 100% at 0.1 A g−1 after 9 cycles, which is close to the theoretical capacity of 419 mA hg−1.


2.2.2. The space around redox-active sites. 
The space around redox-active sites also influences the electrochemical performance of CPM anodes, which is strongly dependent on the crystal structure, porosity, specific surface area, and morphology.47 Crystal structure is a crucial factor that can generate steric effects around redox-active sites, and influence metal-ion storage performance. Various CPMs with different crystal spaces have been investigated, such as wavy layered MOFs,48 honeycomb-type MOFs,49 and three-dimensional (3D) MOFs.50 Hu and co-workers reported a pillar-layered MOF exhibiting improved lithium storage capacity compared with a chain-like MOF in a system without the influence of metals.51 The pillar-layered MOF retained rich accessible space for reversible insertion and diffusion of active lithium ions although lost crystallinity after the first cycle. Cheng and co-workers reported four coordination compounds, ([M(HNA)2(H2O)4] and [M(NA)]n, M = Co or Ni), and it was shown that the structural dimensionality and bond strength change induced by water can significantly influence the electrochemical properties and stability of the materials.52 The 3D [M(NA)]n performed higher specific capacity, CE and structural stability than the 0D [M(HNA)2(H2O)4] due to the absence of water molecules. The authors explained that it is probably because the coordination bonds forming the framework are much stronger than the hydrogen bonds. Li and co-workers reported two hydrated/anhydrous calcium terephthalate (CaC8H4O4) MOFs as anodes for LIBs.53 The results showed that the anhydrous CaC8H4O4 had a spaciously ordered layer structure and a higher Ca–O chemical bonding interaction, delivering a higher capacity and better rate performance.
Until now, the rules are unclear about the effects of pore size on performance improvement. Zhu et al. prepared two homologous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with different pore sizes and found that the electrochemical performance dramatically relied on the pore sizes of the CTFs in the K-storage system. As proven, the depotassiation from the smaller pores of CTFs is exothermic and beneficial to a higher reversible capacity.54 CTF-0 with smaller pores (pore diameter of 0.5 nm) exhibited larger apparent diffusion coefficients according to the kinetic analysis, thus possessing higher specific capacity than CTF-1 (pore diameter of 1.5 nm). Vaidhyanathan and co-workers developed triazole-triformyl phloroglucinol-based crystalline COF nanosheets (HSERP-CON1).55 The DFT-optimized structure and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the lithiated CON1 did not display strong Li-framework binding. More importantly, compared with recently reported CPMs for lithium storage, it exhibited a high reversible capacity of 720 mA h g−1 (1.0 A g−1) and the lowest drop (20%) in specific capacity with an increase in current density to 1.0 A g−1 (Fig. 8a and b). The authors concluded that the primary reason for the optimized performance was the optimal interaction (suitable pores for more proximal active sites) between the HSERP-CON1 and lithium, and, more importantly, the lack of any undesirable irreversible redox activity (Li–COO bonds). Furthermore, robust pores and channels in CPMs can be used to encapsulate active components for improving energy storage performance. Polyoxometalates (POMs) are referred to as “electron sponges” due to their large electron uptake number. Even though POMs do not have abundant pores and channels, when combined with MOFs, they can maintain the whole crystal state and may offer a good capacity for energy storage applications. Lan et al. reported POM-based MOF/reduced graphene oxide (PMo10V2@HKUST-1/rGO)56 and ionic liquids (ILs) encapsulated into POM-based MOFs (PMo10V2-ILs@HKUST-1),57 respectively, which exhibited superior lithium storage performance compared to combinations of other components. The results can be attributed to the synergistic effects: MOFs, possessing high thermal and chemical stabilities, can encapsulate and disperse soluble POMs, POMs can provide multi-electron redox reactions, and rGO and ILs can enhance conductivity. Some new structural POM-based MOFs have also been investigated, such as [Cu10(H3trz)4(Htrz)4][HPW12O40], [Cu10(H3trz)4(Htrz)4][H2SiW12O40],58 [Ag10(trz)4(H2O)2][HPW12O40] and [Ag10(trz)4(H2O)6][H2SiW12O40],59 exhibiting similar dominant positions in LIBs.

Layered-like morphologies bring facile charge transport and ionic diffusivity, which can affect electrochemical performance. It has been proven that 2D CPMs exhibit excellent surface-controlled electrochemical behavior compared with bulk CPMs, due to the added surface capacity of the rapid discharge–charge reaction and ultrafast kinetics of the metal-ion insertion in layered form. It is in particular remarkable for the improvement of rate performance and stability, which is imperative for all anode materials. By means of conventional methods, various layered-like CPMs can be successfully synthesized and studied as anode materials. Liu and co-workers prepared a series of Ni-BTC MOFs with different morphologies by adjusting reaction solvents.60 Compared with sphere-like Ni-BTC, hierarchical flower-like Ni-BTC samples, assembled with 2D Ni-BTC, exhibited a larger specific surface area (551 m2 g−1) and a suitable mesoporous structure, which facilitated ion and electron transport, achieving superior rate performance (1085 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 358 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1) and stability (no obvious capacity decay after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). Recently, Zheng et al. fabricated a tremella-like MOF of aluminum fumarates (Al-FumA),61 assembled by 2D ultrathin MOFs, which exhibited excellent cycle stability (without obvious fading in 100 cycles) and rate performance (258 mA h g−1 at an ultrahigh current density of 37.5 A g−1). In addition, some CPMs with layered crystal structures were more easily exfoliated via sonication to form a 2D morphology for improved rate capability and cycling life. Liu et al. reported 2D COF films assembled by polyporphyrin (TThPP) nanosheets and 4-thiophenephenyl groups that showed a larger exposed area, offering more lithium-insertion channels.62 When used as an anode material in LIBs, it exhibited a high reversible capacity of 666 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 and a long cycle life at 1.0 A g−1. Xu et al. exfoliated micrometer-sized CTFs63 into few-layer sheets (Fig. 8c) and found that the exfoliated 2DP sheets exhibited higher capacity (262 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 119 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1) and cycle stability (capacity retention of 95% after 1200 cycles) than bulk CTFs (Fig. 8d–f).
Synthesis of smaller CPMs is another promising route to provide sufficient accessible sites for enhanced rate properties and cycling life of anodes. From this point of view, Xu and co-workers explained the effects of crystal size on lithium storage performance.64 Ultrasmall Co-MOFs (sub-5 nm) encapsulated within N-doped carbon/graphene (GCP350) were fabricated from bulk Co-MOF particles/graphene by thermal pulverization. Due to the coating of polypyrrole on the Co-MOFs, bulk Co-MOF particles transformed into ultrasmall nanocrystals without oxidation. The ultrasmall Co-MOFs in GCP350 increased electrolyte infiltration and shortened the electron/ion transport pathway. When evaluated as the anode in LIBs, GCP350 delivered an ultrahigh reversible capacity (1301 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), extraordinary rate performance (494 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1), and outstanding cycling stability (98.6% capacity retention at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles).


2.2.3. Improvements in other aspects. 
When applied as electrode materials, one of the biggest issues of CPMs is the poor electrical conductivity, which hinders the electrochemical performance improvements, leading to severe polarization and capacity decay during cycling. Therefore, many researchers have attempted to improve anode performance via conductivity improvement. The most frequently used method is to combine with conductive agents, such as graphene,65 or CNTs.66 More recently, 2D conductive CPMs have drawn increasing attention for electrochemical applications. Bao et al. designed a 2D conductive MOF (Co-hexaaminobenzene (HAB)), which exhibited bulk electrical conductivity as high as 1.57 S cm−1 and demonstrated that the Co-HAB could store nearly three sodium ions per HAB in organic electrolytes.67 When used as the anode in SIBs, the Co-HAB delivered a high capacity of 291 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and a remarkable rate capability (a specific capacity of 152 mA h g−1 at 12 A g−1). The excellent properties resulted from high conductivity and redox-active HAB molecules. Yuan et al. fabricated 1D conductive Cu-MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene)2) nanowires, which exhibited a low Rct (305 Ω), resulting in high rate performance for lithium storage.68

2.3 CPMs as carriers in electrolyte systems
A series of CPMs with open channels have been considered as excellent carriers in ion-conductor systems due to their tunability, regular crystal structure, and compatibility with a wide range of mobile cations.69–71 Currently, CPM-based separators applied in the gas/ion separation field have been intensively explored, providing a foundation for further exploration in electrolyte systems.72,73 When used as separators or solid electrolytes, CPMs perform a similar function of obstructing electron transfer and allowing ion transport. In addition, the crystalline nature of CPMs provides theoretical guidance for the synthesis of new carriers in electrolyte systems. Particularly in solid electrolyte systems, CPMs, consisting of two sublattices (a crystalline framework composed of immobile ions and a sublattice of mobile species) can achieve high ionic conductivities without a high concentration of defects. In other cases, they have been shown to inhibit metal dendrites to a certain extent.74
To date, varieties of CPMs have been explored as carriers in solid electrolytes. By adding alkali metal salts or ILs into the pores of CPMs, the ion conductivity (σ), ion-transference number (t) and active energy (Ea) of reported CPM-based electrolytes are particularly attractive and have the potential to meet the commercial requirements, as listed in Table 1. Two assembly approaches have been widely investigated: (1) binding the anions to CUMs in the neutral framework, and (2) connecting the negatively charged organic groups directly. Recently, engineering alkali metal-based frameworks as highly stable solid electrolytes has become a new research direction. Therefore, the CUMs,82 ligands,92 and frameworks93 of CPMs have tremendous influence on the ion transport of electrolytes.

2.3.1. Unsaturated metal sites in CPMs. 
In some CPMs with coordination solvent molecules, CUMs can be easily obtained via thermal activation. It was reported that CUMs, including Mg, Cu, and Zr, possessing Lewis acidity, can serve as anchoring points for anionic species in electrolytes through electrostatic adsorption or bonding. For instance, UIO-66 is constructed of –O and –OH ligands originating from water molecules. Upon vacuum dehydration of the cluster cores, the Zr CUMs were exposed and behaved as strong Lewis acid sites.88 Based on this, in liquid-battery systems, Lu and co-workers prepared UIO-66(Zr)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite separators and UIO-66-NH2/glass fiber (GF) composite separators, exhibiting enhanced Li-ion transport. Particularly, the Zr CUMs in the crystalline UIO-66(Zr)-based separators can spontaneously adsorb anions for the improvement of the lithium-ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.79) and Li-ion conductivity (1.7 mS cm−1) significantly.94
In solid-state battery systems, CPMs must provide ionic carriers and transport channels to load metal-containing molecules (ILs, inorganic lithium salts, etc.). Thus, CUMs in CPMs have become even more important to electrolyte systems. In 2011, Long et al. first investigated a Mg2(dobdc)-based solid electrolyte (H4dobdc = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid), in which Mg CUMs facilitated the grafting of lithium isopropoxide (LiiOPr).75 Through subsequent soaking, the Mg2(dobdc)·0.35LiOiPr·0.25LiBF4·EC·DEC electrolyte was prepared and delivered a higher conductivity of 3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 and an active energy of 0.15 eV at 300 K. Inspired by selective ionic channels in biological systems, Dunn and co-workers designed biomimetic ionic channels in a series of MOFs by using the CUMs to graft anions (e.g., ClO4−), which allowed fast and effective cationic transport, as shown in Fig. 9a–d. The authors summarized several LiClO4/propylene carbonate (PC)@MOF (LPC@MOFs) electrolytes and demonstrated that those with CUMs showed low active energy (Fig. 9e). Additionally, via comparison to three MIL-100 MOFs (metal = Al, Cr, Fe) with identical pore structures but with different CUMs, it was confirmed that the stronger acidity of Al CUMs leads to greater ion-pair dissociation and enhanced ion transport (Fig. 9f and g).82

Via strong anionic bonding to CUMs, large-radius metal ions can achieve rapid transport in CPMs, such as Na+ and Mg2+. Dincă et al. reported a facile strategy to immobilize halide/pseudohalide salts into a Cu-azolate MOF, while simultaneously inducing a reversible single crystal–single crystal transition.80 When the halide/pseudohalide anions were bound to the Cu CUMs, the charge-balancing cations (Li+, Na+, and Mg2+) moved freely in the 1D channels, giving rise to high single-ion conductivity. Recently, they found another Cu-azolate MOF (Cu4(ttpm)2(CuCl2)0.6(MgBr2)0.7·21PC) with rich CUMs that could bind stoichiometric amounts of halide, resulting in high densities of Li+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 9h).95 Due to its intrinsic properties (pore size, pore polarity, and mobile ion identity), the Cu-azolate MOF exhibited promising Mg-ion transport (an ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1), contributing to solid electrolyte development.


2.3.2. Organic groups in CPMs. 
Different from CUM mechanisms, organic compounds with conducting alkali metal ions can be directly achieved in numerous ways. The three most common approaches are: (1) binding the anions of lithium compounds in positively charged organic groups of CPMs; (2) alkali metal ions as counterions in anionic CPMs or connecting with negatively charged organic groups directly; and (3) promoting ion dissolution via polymer chain anchoring in the frameworks. The mechanism of binding anions via positively charged organic groups is similar to the function of CUMs. Chen et al. selected a cationic moiety (triaminoguanidinium chloride) to assemble a cationic COF, in which Cl− counterions can be easily ion-exchanged with TFSI−, boosting the concentration of free mobile lithium ions, and improving the Li+ conductivity in the COF (2.09 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C) (Fig. 10a).87 Anionic frameworks and other functional groups have shown the ability to directly grasp lithium ions. Saha et al. reported a neutral Cu(I)-sulfonate MOF ([Cu2(BPY)2(NDIDS)], BPY = 4,4′-bipyridine, NDIDS = zigzag naphthalene diimide ligands equipped with two terminal sulfonate groups) in which carbonyl and uncoordinated sulfonate oxygen atoms can simultaneously bind guest lithium ions.96 After LiClO4 infiltration, its Li-ion conductivity can reach 2.3 × 10−2 S cm−1, which is much higher than its intrinsic electrical conductivity (4.65 × 10−8 S cm−1). Feng et al. designed an anionic cyclodextrin-based COF (CD-COF), as shown in Fig. 10b, which contained Li counterions in the robust open framework, leading to Li-ion conductivity of up to 2.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C.90 The idea of driving alkali metal ions to participate in a single crystal conversion is an innovative strategy. More recently, Lee and co-workers reported a new Li-sulfonated COF (TpPa-SO3Li), as a solvent-free single Li-ion conductor, in which sulfonates are covalently tethered enabling Li-ion conduction (Fig. 10c).86 It exhibited a high Li-ion transference number of 0.9 at room temperature and an active energy of 0.18 eV without additionally incorporating lithium salts and solvents.86

Reproduced from ref. 86 with permission from the American Chemical Society, copyright [2019]. 
Polyelectrolytes, engineered onto CPM frameworks, can contribute to the dissociation of lithium salts, offer a pathway for ion conduction, and promote ion transport through a low energy-barrier vehicle mechanism. In 2018, Jiang et al. reported the first example of a crystalline polyelectrolyte COF (TPB-BMTP-COF) by integrating flexible oligo(ethyleneoxide) chains onto the pore walls (Fig. 11a and b).91 Upon complexation with lithium salts, Li+@TPB-BMTP-COF exhibited lower active energy and higher Li-ion conductivity than those of Li+@TPB-DMTP-COF (with methoxy groups instead of oligo(ethyleneoxide) chains on the edge phenyl units) (Fig. 11c). Subsequently, Horike and co-workers anchored the dynamic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) moieties into the COF pores in a crystalline state, which was able to solvate Li+ for fast transport by its segmental motion. Via electrochemical analysis, the COF-PEO-9-Li sample with the highest density accumulation of PEO units showed over 10−3 S cm−1 at 200 °C.94

2.3.3. Technological improvements. 
In liquid-electrolyte systems, inspired by gas separation, CPMs are commonly assembled with organic polymers (polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, PVA, etc.) via electrospinning,94 post-coating,97 and ion exchange98 to upgrade the electrolyte wettability and uptake. In solid–electrolyte systems, the interfaces between solid electrolyte and electrodes are highly important. Pan and co-workers proposed a strategy to assemble an IL-impregnated MOF electrolyte (Li-IL@MOF) with nanowetted interfaces.85 The new solid electrolyte material not only possessed high phase ionic conductivity (0.3 × 10−3 S cm−1) but also exhibited excellent interfacial Li-ion transport performance due to its unique nanowetted interface for good matching between the active electrode particles. As a result of these characteristics, a Li|Li-IL@MOF|LFP battery with the Li-IL@MOF as the solid electrolyte achieved extremely high electrode material loading (25 mg cm−2). Small polarization voltage and high stability indicated low interfacial impedance and a stable interface between Li-IL@MOF and the Li metal. Meanwhile, the wide operating temperature range of the Li|Li-IL@MOF|LFP battery (−20 °C to 150 °C) suggested the superiority of Li-IL@MOF over its liquid counterparts.

3. Electrochemically active sites in CPMs for metal–air batteries and fuel cells
Over the past decade, many efforts have been devoted to the exploration of electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, especially metal–air batteries and fuel cells, aimed at alleviating current energy consumption and decreasing environmental pollution. At the core of these two systems is the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) between chemical and electrical energies. The basic principle for metal–air batteries is that oxygen accepts the electrons released from the oxidation of the anode metal to form an oxygen-reduced species, which then migrates and combines with the counterpart to form metal oxides during the discharge process (reversible).99 In comparison, the fundamental mechanism for fuel cells is that the reactant oxygen is reduced into OH− at the cathode side.100 In spite of tremendous progress, the development and application of metal–air batteries and fuel cells are still hindered by several critical issues, such as poor practical energy densities caused by sluggish kinetics on the cathode for metal–air batteries and high cost and poor stability for fuel cells. In analyzing the electrochemical reaction process, it has been shown that catalysts are key to the enhancement of ORR performance for both devices. Thus, searching for new promising catalysts with high ORR electrocatalytic activity for metal–air batteries and fuel cells is a top research interest for researchers in materials science and chemistry. Generally, the design of catalysts should focus on the interfacial area increase and enhanced air diffusion and transport.101 CPMs have been intensively studied for their electrocatalytic performance in the ORR (Table 2), based on their definite structure, ultrahigh surface areas, and abundant porous structure. During ORR processes in metal–air batteries and fuel cells, the metal, ligand, and surrounding spaces may individually or together act as electrochemically active sites to enhance electrocatalytic activity. Thus, understanding the sources of electrochemically active sites of CPMs is also particularly critical, which can provide a guidance on further design and construction of CPMs with highly electrocatalytic activity. This section will give a summary of the dominant electrochemically active sites in CPMs for enhanced ORR performance in metal–air batteries and fuel cells.

3.1 Active metal centers
In general, there are two types of metal ions used as electrochemically active sites for the ORR process. One is the high-activity metal-oxyhydroxides formed by CPM frameworks damages, which is more likely to exist in Zn–air batteries. These types of active sites can act as bifunctional active centers to boost ORR and OER processes and can be easily obtained from CPMs. As a typical example, Zhang et al. reported Co-based MOF (Co(bpdc)(H2O)4, bpdc = biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) arrays as an efficient electrocatalyst for Zn–air batteries, and it was found that the as-formed Co-MOF transformed into cobalt-oxyhydroxide nanosheets during the electrochemical process, thus serving as intrinsic electrochemical active centers.102 Another example is the metal-ion itself acting as an open metal catalytic site during redox activity, which can provide larger polar surface and strengthen the interactions between small molecules and ions, thus promoting electrocatalytic properties. This is more suitable for Li–air batteries.103 Until now, the following metal-ion-based CPMs have been used as active sites: Ni(BPY)(H3BTC),104 2D M-BDC MOF (M = Ni, Co, Mn; BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate),105 and MnCo-dobdc MOF.103 It was confirmed that these types of metal ions have a significant impact on the electrochemical performance, and the CPMs with open Mn sites delivered better electrocatalytic activity than those with open Co or Ni sites when evaluated as cathode materials for Li-oxygen batteries (Fig. 12),105 which is due to the reason that the Mn-CPM delivered a higher band gap than Co- and Ni-CPMs, indicating that higher activity of electrons existed in Mn-CPM to promote the reactions in the ORR and OER processes. Additionally, the types of metal ions also show a great influence on the discharging products. Mn in CPMs has been shown to boost the catalyzed transformation of Li2O2 into LiOH in the presence of water, while Co in the CPMs can induce the formation of Li2O2.103

Besides the direct usage of CPMs with electrochemically active metal centers as catalysts for metal–air batteries, other CPM catalysts with CUMs were studied for ORR performance, which could show their potential in metal–air batteries and fuel cells. Li et al. investigated the electrocatalytic ORR performance of ZIF-8, and found that the abundant pyridinic nitrogen and carbon atoms adjacent in ZIF-8 could act as active sites to promote ORR activity.106 Xia et al. used DFT calculations to reveal that the CUMs exhibited higher ORR activity and the efficiency could be further enhanced by controlling the number of ligands/coordinations and types of metal ions.107 Zhao and co-workers reported a nanocage NPC-4 MOF (Cu2(TMBDI)(H2O)2, TMBDI = 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-benzene-1,4-di-isophthalate) grown on a rGO composite and found that the as-obtained sample after acetone activation could respond to the electrochemical ORR,108 where the Cu CUMs acted as the catalytic site and rGO improved the electrical conductivity. Additionally, redox-active center Co(II) was shown to provide prominent catalytic properties towards the ORR.109
3.2 Metal-containing linkers
Active metal-containing linkers have been proven to be another effective electrocatalytically active center in CPMs. Generally, such electrochemically active sites can be obtained either by self-inherent metal anodes coordinated with organic linkers or by introducing metal cations into the organic functional groups to form metal-embedded linkers. The former currently reported method includes Fe–Nx,110 Co–N4,111 Ni–N4,112 and Co– or Ni–O6.113 Yin et al. confirmed that the bonded Fe atoms in PBA materials, for example, Fe–Nx, were beneficial to O–O activation, thus promoting ORR performance.3 As another example, a complex [Co(bpy)3](NO3)2 (bpy = 2,2′-Bipyridine) was synthesized and the coordinated Co–N4 acted as a catalytically active site for the ORR.111 When replacing one bpy with NO3− ([Co(bpy)2NO3]NO3·5H2O), the ORR performance was improved. This could be ascribed to the fact that the substitution of NO3 for the bpy ligand can decrease the bandgap of the complex, which thus enhanced the conductivity. Recently, Dincă and co-workers reported a conductive CPM Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) (Fig. 13a) and found that the square planar Ni–N4 acted as an active center to catalyze the ORR in terms of the competitive activity with the most active non-platinum group metal electrocatalysts.114 Xie et al. used DFT methods to further demonstrate that the most favorable catalytic sites for these types of MOFs X3(HITP)2 (X = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Rh, Os, Ir) are the central metals rather than the hydrogen or carbon atoms. Particularly, Ir3(HITP)2 delivered the best catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.92 V.115 Subsequently, Chen et al. verified the traditional Ni–N4 electrochemical sites used in the ORR in a theoretical manner (Fig. 13b) and demonstrated that the H atoms directly bonded to the N atoms could also act as electrochemically active sites for enhanced ORR.112

For comparison, introducing metal cations to form linkers is typically based on porphyrin-based ligands.116–119 Porphyrin is a polar, conjugated, and highly-delocalized organic molecule, which has strong ability to coordinate metal cations into complexes.120 These porphyrin-based building blocks can be easily incorporated into CPM frameworks by forming interlinkers with rigid units, originating from their unique macrocyclic characteristic.121 The most frequently chosen metal cations are iron and cobalt. Fateeva et al. reported the synthesis of a cobalt-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (Co-TCPP). The nature of the catalytic sites was investigated and found that the active centers were located only on the metalated linkers rather than in the inorganic building units.122 Nevertheless, the poor electrical conductivity of porphyrin-based CPMs severely restricts their electrocatalytic ORR performance. Thus, combining porphyrin-based CPMs with conductive substrates such as graphene and CNTs to construct hybrids is an efficient method to improve electrocatalytic performance (Fig. 14). The inherent catalytic active center of the metalloligand was well preserved and the conductivity was also improved. Until now, several hybrids have been prepared and have delivered much improved ORR performance, for example, rGO/covalent Co-porphyrin CPM,118 pyridine-functionalized graphene-iron porphyrin composite,116 and CNTs-modified Fe-porphyrin-based conjugated networks.117 In addition, anchoring metal-containing porphyrin-based ligands onto CPM structures can improve the chemical and structural stabilities and the distribution of available catalytic sites and stabilize the active catalysts, which is a comparable strategy for enhancing ORR activity.119 As a typical example, Zhang et al. precisely and controllably introduced Co-porphyrin active sites into a well-defined 2D COF at the atomic level, and successfully used it as a cathode catalyst for Zn–air batteries.120 The resultant material showed a small voltage gap of 0.71 V and outstanding stability up to 200 cycles, which is better than those of noble-metal-based cathodes. This is primarily ascribed to the well-defined Co-porphyrin active sites and strong covalent linkages to the COF framework. Complementarily, anchoring another electrochemically active Co-based complex onto the CPM framework was also proven to show excellent ORR performance.123

3.3 The space around active sites
Except for active metal ions and metal-containing linkers mentioned above acting as electrochemically active sites, self-inherent porous structures and channel characteristics are favorable for enhancing the electrocatalytic ORR activity. Li and co-workers systematically studied a series of CPMs including MOF-5, HKUST-1, and M-MOF-74 (M = Co, Mg, Mn) as cathode catalysts for Li–air batteries.124 It was found that the porous structure, especially hierarchical pores, played a critical role in improving the electrochemical performance. The micropores primarily enhanced the concentration of adsorbed oxygen, while mesopores facilitated the diffusion of electrolytes and the deposition of discharging products. In another important work, Chen's group found that the channel diameter and orientation of Ni-BTC CPMs also greatly influenced performance.104 The existence of the microporous structure in Ni-BTC (6 Å × 7 Å and 5 Å × 8 Å channels) guarantees the free transfer of molecular oxygen (kinetic diameter of 3.46 Å) and the electrolyte (containing Li+). By fully taking advantage of the pore structure, CPMs can also be used as separators for Li–O2 batteries, which can act as sieves to restrain the shuttling of the redox mediator species, thus significantly prolonging the cycle life at high current densities.125–131 Apart from the porous structure and channels, integrating electrocatalytically active inorganic materials, for example, MnO2 and CuS, into CPMs to form composites also facilitates the ORR activity.126 Suh et al. fabricated nano-CuS in/on a 3D Cu-MOF to investigate the electrocatalytic activities for the ORR.127 The results revealed that the increased nano-CuS amount could exponentially boost the electrical conductivity by up to circa 109-fold, therefore resulting in a higher electrocatalytic performance of composite than Cu-MOF or nano-CuS in an alkaline solution.
4. Electrochemically active sites in CPMs for CO2 conversion
With the excessive consumption of fossil fuels for energy-related needs, large amounts of CO2 are released and result in possible climatic warming and glacial ablation worldwide.134 To alleviate this urgent environmental issue, there are three potential strategies proposed. The first is to search for environmentally friendly alternatives to reduce CO2 release. The second is to directly sequester and utilize CO2 in the form of Li–CO2 battery systems, which not only fixes CO2 but also provides sustainable energy storage.135 The third is to develop corresponding techniques aimed at storing CO2 or transforming CO2 into high-value chemicals such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methane, or ethanol.136 Unfortunately, the current strategies including biomass and physical and chemical approaches face drawbacks of time consumption, limited capacity, and, sometimes, undesired environmental pollution. This has motivated the researchers to attempt other efforts to improve the above-mentioned serious issues. Li–CO2 batteries and photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reductions of CO2 have stood out from the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, Li–CO2 batteries and the electrochemical reduction approach have been proven to be sustainable strategies for CO2 utilization or transformation due to advantages of low energy requirements which could be directly obtained from renewable sources.137 In this way, the development of efficient and economical catalysts for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into chemical feedstocks is highly desirable.
4.1 CPMs as Li–CO2 cathodes
Currently, the generally accepted electrochemical reduction mechanism for Li–CO2 electrochemistry is based on the reaction of 4Li+ + 4e− + 3CO2 → 2Li2CO3 + C. According to the equation above, an ideal CO2 electrode should meet the following requirements: (1) the ability to store and capture CO2; (2) the space to restrict the deposition of the Li2CO3 discharge product; (3) sites to catalyze the decomposition of Li2CO3. It must be noted that CPMs may be a suitable choice for use as cathode catalysts in Li–CO2 batteries due to their unique structure and physicochemical properties such as capability for CO2 capture, regular pores, and monodispersed catalytic sites.138 This section describes the application of CPMs including MOFs and COFs in Li–CO2 batteries, and simultaneously analyzes the corresponding active sites for electrochemical performance improvement.
The research on CPMs for Li–CO2 batteries is still in its early stage. Recently, Wang and co-workers, for the first time, explored the potential application of MOFs as catalysts in CO2 electrodes (Fig. 15a).138 Eight porous MOFs including Mn2(dobdc), Co2(dobdc), Ni2(dobdc), Mn(bdc), Fe(bdc), Cu(bdc), Mn(C2H2N3)2, and Mn(HCOO)2 were chosen to investigate their electrochemical performance. It was found that the metal active center played a key role in adjusting the charge overpotential, and Mn(II) centers showed a much-reduced charge potential below 4.20 V, which meant that metal Mn was more inclined to activate the discharge product Li2CO3 upon charging. Compared with metal centers, the porosities of MOFs typically affect the uptake of CO2 molecules, which then tuned the discharge capacity. To verify, a series of Mn-MOFs with different pore sizes as well as nonporous MnCO3 were further investigated. The results indicated that the larger pore size of the MOF could achieve high CO2 uptake, and increase the discharge capacity (Fig. 15b–d).

As another kind of CPM, COFs are suitable for Li–CO2 batteries. They are constructed from small molecule building units that are linked and periodically extended through covalent bonds. In general, COFs show higher stability than MOFs, more open channels, and easier functionalization which all provide properties of materials with improved electrochemical performance when they are evaluated as cathodes in Li–CO2 batteries. As a typical example, Loh et al. investigated the first example of COF-based Li–CO2 batteries.139 A COF constructed from hydrazone/hydrazide-containing molecular units (Tf-DHzOPr) was selected, due to its properties of high stability, precise open channels and skeletons, and good CO2 sequestration. Furthermore, they combined COFs with Ru nanoparticle decorated CNTs (Ru-CNT) to construct a COF-based cathode catalyst, and found that COF mainly played key roles in the following aspects (Fig. 16a): (1) acting as a CO2 collector to improve the discharge capacity; (2) facilitating the decomposition of Li2CO3; and (3) serving as diffusion layers for both Li-ion and CO2 gas to improve the rate performance. Based on these advantages, the as-obtained COF-based cathode delivered excellent electrochemical performance in terms of the ultrahigh capacity of 27384 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 and low cut-off overpotential of 1.24 V (Fig. 16b and c).

4.2 CPMs as electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts
Current electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts are typically composed of metal, metal oxides, and carbon-based materials. Besides them, CPMs have been widely studied as effective electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion originating from their tunable physicochemical properties and promising catalytic performance as well as their CO2 sequestration ability. In CPMs, metal anodes, specific heteroatoms, functionalized organic ligands, porous structure, and defects can all act as electrochemical active sites to promote catalytic activity, selectivity and efficiency in CO2 reduction. This section summarizes CPMs that have been applied in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. Some typical examples for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 based on different kinds of electrochemically active sites are listed in Table 3.

4.2.1 Active metal centers. 
Generally, CPMs are constructed from metal ions/clusters and organic linkers through coordination interactions or hydrogen bonding. Originating from the unique structure and components of CPMs, they hold great promise as catalysts in the field of CO2 electroreduction. In most cases, there are three categories of electrochemically active sites for CO2 reduction. The first type is redox-active metal ions in CPMs, which mainly consist of inherent open metal sites, unsaturated coordination induced metal sites, and the formed clusters between metals and ligands. As a typical example, the M-MOF-74 series with different metal sources (Co, Ni, Zn) were synthesized by Jiang and co-workers, and directly studied as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.140 It was found that the M-MOF-74 structure presented Lewis acidic sites, namely open metal sites, during heating in vacuum, which induced the strong binding of CO2 molecules with the open metal sites, thereby resulting in excellent catalytic activity.
However, many studies have shown that Cu ions are more likely to act as metal sites due to their unsaturated coordination modes.134,141 For instance, Sargent et al. reported HKUST-1-regulated Cu clusters with controlled surface coordination number through controllable calcination of HKUST-1 to detach the adjacent carboxylate moieties.142 The formed undercoordinated site-promoted Cu clusters could act as catalytic sites to optimize activity, selectivity, and efficiency for CO2 electroreduction. Besides Cu ions, cobalt ions can also provide active sites for improved catalytic performance, most of which are combined with porphyrin molecules. Yaghi and co-workers synthesized a modified Co-porphyrin MOF (Al2(OH)2TCPP-Co) thin film as the catalyst for efficient and selective reduction of CO2 to CO, where Co acted as a catalytic metal center (Fig. 17).143 Additionally, the metal ions in CPMs could link with organic ligands to form clusters, which are also good choices for active sites of promoted CO2 electrocatalytic performance, typically as Re–CO or Ru–CO-based complexes,144 or Cu–O clusters.145,146 During the electrocatalytic process, Cu–O clusters might transform into CuO, Cu2O, and Cu4O3, and thus catalyze CO2 reduction. To further improve the catalytic properties of CO2 reduction, construction of CPMs with two metal active sites was realized by introducing Re-based complexes into COF materials followed by post-modification with CoCl2 and FeCl3 metal precursors.147

4.2.2 Active organic linkers. 
The second type of CPM for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction is organic ligands typically containing heteroatoms (N, S, etc.), which can also provide active sites for promoted CO2 electroreduction performance in terms of high catalytic activity, selectivity, and efficiency. Among the various organic ligands, porphyrin molecules are a widely adopted alternative due to their symmetrical structure and N heteroatoms. Hupp et al. reported a Fe-porphyrin-based MOF film as a highly efficient catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2.148 However, it was found that the porphyrin molecule more likely intended to be introduced into COF materials. Very recently, the Yaghi group introduced a porphyrin unit into COF materials (COF-366 and COF-367) and successfully tuned the electronic character of the porphyrin active sites via modification of the reticular structure by functionalizing a series of different electron-withdrawing groups (H, OMe, F) for enhanced electroreduction of CO2 to CO.149 It was found that the functionalization of the struts with electronegative elements directly translated into an electron withdrawing effect on the cobalt center and the extent of this effect was proportional to the electronegativity. Deng et al. reported a 3D amine-linked COF material (COF-300-AR) with excellent chemical stability in acid and base solutions as an effective catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction (Fig. 18a). The existence of amino groups could promote CO2 conversion efficiency by affording carbamate intermediates and selectivity towards CO, thereby facilitating the electrochemical reduction process (Fig. 18b).150

4.2.3 Improvements in other aspects. 
Besides the two above-mentioned electrochemically active sites, combining CPMs with metal oxide nanoparticles to form hybrid systems is also an available strategy to increase the electrocatalytic activity. In this category, CPMs only play the role of providing adsorption sites to anchor large amounts of CO2 molecules, while the metal oxide nanoparticles act as true catalytic sites to facilitate the electroreduction of CO2. Qiu et al. reported an all-in-one hybrid catalyst by time-resolved controllable restructuring from Cu2O to a Cu2O@Cu-MOF.151 During the electroreduction process, a large number of CO2 molecules were adsorbed and captured on the surface of the Cu-MOF, which not only reduced the increased concentration of local CO2 on the electrode surface, but also effectively prevented the contact of Cu2O and the electrolyte, thus avoiding the occurrence of the HER. Additionally, embedding metal nanoparticles into MOF films is also beneficial for improved CO2 reduction.152 Besides the three kinds of above-mentioned active sites, the porous structure of CPMs could also play a key role in enhanced catalytic activity, but few works have focused on this idea.153

5. Electrochemically active sites in CPMs for water splitting
Electrocatalytic water splitting is an important technology to generate green and sustainable energy sources. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions in water splitting occurring at the cathode and anode, respectively (Fig. 19a). The HER has two possible reaction mechanisms (Volmer–Heyrovsky or Volmer–Tafel mechanism), and the latter pathway is kinetically more favorable for the HER. For the OER, there is one reaction mechanism, and it follows a four-electron pathway both in acidic and alkaline solutions. The performance parameters, such as the onset potential, overpotential, turnover frequency (TOF), Tafel slope, and stability, are typically used to assess the electrocatalytic performance. Based on the Volcano plots (Fig. 19b), it can be concluded that precious metal oxides (IrO2, RuO2) are excellent catalysts for the OER, while precious metals (Pt, Pd) have higher catalytic activity for the HER (Fig. 19c). Due to the high price and scarcity of precious metals, it is urgent to seek alternatives.

CPMs possessing regular crystalline lattices and well-defined pore structures are good choices as electrocatalysts for water splitting. In 2011, Dolbecq and co-workers directly used MOFs as electrocatalysts for water splitting, where they obtained POM-based MOFs (POMOFs) with excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER due to the “microenvironment effect” (showing a high TOF ca. 6.7 s−1).157 Subsequently, many works on pristine CPMs as electrocatalysts for water splitting have arisen. However, there are many drawbacks of CPMs used as electrocatalysts, such as low conductivity and inferior stability in strong acid or base solutions. In terms of these issues, new and improved strategies are still needed.
For CPMs, MOFs are used to a larger extent as electrocatalysts than the others. MOFs as main parts of CPMs possess many properties enabling them as excellent electrocatalysts for water splitting. Their ultrahigh surface areas (from 1000 to 10000 m2 g−1) and porosities enable high electrolyte adsorption and expose more active sites. The large cavities inside MOFs can accommodate guest molecules with catalytic activity. In addition, the characteristics of easily functional and tunable metal nodes and organic ligands are in favor of tuning the electrocatalytic activity of MOFs. In general, the metals in MOFs are the active sites for electrocatalyzing water splitting. The CUMs, guest molecules, and organic ligands also play significant roles during the electrocatalytic process. In this section, the roles of metals, CUMs, guest molecules, and organic ligands in MOFs are summarized for electrocatalytic water splitting. In addition, other compounds of CPMs, such as COFs are summarized as electrocatalysts for water splitting.
5.1 CPMs as hydrogen evolution catalysts
Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable energy source, which can generate electricity via electrocatalytic water splitting. In recent years, CPMs, especially for MOFs, have been widely used as electrocatalysts for the HER. The representative and excellent work of CPMs as electrocatalysts for the HER through water splitting are summarized in Table 4. The following describes the roles of CUMs, guest molecules, and organic ligands in MOFs for the HER in detail. In this section, addition of matrices or materials with superior conductivity is also summarized.

5.1.1 Active metal centers. 
For the HER in electrocatalytic water splitting, the main active sites are metal sites. Among them, transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) with multiple valence states are frequently used. Due to the easily tunable properties of MOFs, the electrocatalytic activity for the HER can be tuned by controlling the coordination environment, contents, and species of metal ions. Additionally, the electrocatalytic activity is usually enhanced through synergistic effects of multiple metal ions. Electrocatalytic activity is greatly influenced by the coordination environment of metal ions, which is closely related to the reaction solvents, organic ligands, surfactants, and the innate characteristics of the metals. Bu et al. reported MOFs (CTGU-5 and -6) selectively crystallized using anionic and neutral surfactants with different bonding interactions with water molecules, thus influencing their coordination environment. The unpaired electron and empty Eg state of Co2+ in CTGU-5 was shown to facilitate the capture of protons and electrons, respectively, thus exhibiting better electrocatalytic activity for the HER than that of CTGU-6.162 The type of metal ion also greatly influences the catalytic activity. Marinescu and co-workers reported BHT coordination frameworks (CoBHT, NiBHT, FeBHT) as electrocatalysts for the HER in pH = 1.3 aqueous solutions. The overpotential, Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicated that electrocatalytic activities followed the order CoBHT > NiBHT > FeBHT. In addition, CoBHT with an overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm−2 showed the lowest overpotential of the reported metal dithiolene-based CPs to date.
Single metallic MOFs often exhibit lower catalytic activity than multiple metallic MOFs. The coupling effect between multiple metals can enhance the catalytic performance. For example, Zhao and co-workers reported 2D NiFe-MOFs with ultrathin nanosheets as electrocatalysts for the HER.179 Lu and co-workers reported a NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)-MOF in situ grown on 3D conductive macroporous nickel foam (NF) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting (Fig. 20).160 Then, as reported in 2019, they demonstrated an inter-molecular synergistic effect for direct MOF-based electrodes to enhance electrocatalytic activity for the first time.170 The works of Lu and co-workers both demonstrated that the coupling effect between Fe and Ni can enhance the catalytic performance. In addition, endowing metals with defects facilitates more active electrochemically active sites. Ho and co-workers utilized chemical etching to cyanide-bridged cobalt-iron (CN-CoFe) with highly reactive high-index facets and defect-rich structures of Co and Fe, which generated superior electrocatalytic activity for the HER. Synergistically, defects and bimetallic Co and Fe can facilitate hydrogen adsorption.161

5.1.2 The space around active sites. 
Although coordinated metal ions are essential active sites for electrocatalysis, organic ligands occupy a significant position in electrocatalysts, via linking metal sites for achieving ultrahigh BET surface area, large channels and cavities. Generally, organic ligands are not active sites during the HER process, but they play critical roles in electrocatalytic processes, especially in facilitating the transfer of protons and electrons. Many functional or conductive organic ligands were used to construct MOFs to improve electrical conductivity. For example, Marinescu et al. reported conductive metal dithiolene-based coordination frameworks as electrocatalysts for the HER.158 Hupp and co-workers used H4TBAPy as organic ligands to enhance the transfer of protons, which greatly improved the electrocatalytic performance for the HER.168 H2BDC is typically used as an organic ligand to construct MOFs as electrocatalysts for the HER, where the functional H2BDC often exhibits better performance, such as NH2-BDC. Lu et al. utilized amino group functionalized H2BDC as the organic ligand to construct an NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)-MOF. The –NH2 as an electron donor facilitated reduction of water molecules in the Volmer process. Meanwhile, the NH2-BDC connected the MOF with the NF through strong electronic coupling, thus enhancing the electronic and mechanical connections between the NH2-MIL-88B(Fe2Ni)-MOF and the NF to improve HER performance.160 The synergistic effect of the additive and MOFs may improve the catalytic activity. By adding heteroatoms, an interfacial-bond-induced charge relocation occurs and electronically modifies the active sites to tune electrocatalytic activity. In 2019, Qiao and co-workers hybridized 2D Ni-MOFs and Pt to realize outstanding electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. Charge relocation on newly formed Ni–O–Pt interfacial bonds increased OH* adsorption energy and reduced H* adsorption energy, which facilitated electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER.159 Xin Zhang and co-workers also reported MoSx anchored on porous Zr-MOF with enhanced performance of the HER. Its porous structure is favorable for the delivery of protons. Additionally, the –NH2 group in UiO-66-NH2 greatly facilitates proton transport from the electrolyte toward the edge active sites of MoSx particles, thus improving the HER activity.169


5.1.3 Electronic transport boosters. 
The low conductivity of MOFs greatly reduces their electrocatalytic activity. In order to improve the conductivity of MOFs, additives with good conductivity are adopted, such as poly(3-aminobenzoic acid), graphene, acetylene black (AB), and CNTs.
Conductive polymers are typically used to enhance the conductivity of composites. Modibane and co-workers obtained HKUST-1 decorated with poly(3-aminobenzoic acid) (PABA) particles by a solvothermal synthesis. The presence of PABA significantly increased the HER exchange current density and reduced the electrochemical reaction resistance. Additionally, the synergistic effect between PABA particles and the MOF support can facilitate the migration of Hads.180 On the basis of the above-mentioned work, Modibane and co-workers also obtained HKUST-1 wrapped with polyaniline (PANI) in 2018.181 Cao et al. reported PBA@PANI core–shell nanocubes as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, where the unique structure can effectively promote the electron transfer from PANI to PBAs.167
To improve conductivity, conducting carbon materials are also often used. Li et al. reported a novel 3D microporous Co-MOF (denoted CTGU-9) mixed with AB to improve the electrical conductivity. By changing the ratio of AB to CTGU-9, a composite (AB&CTGU9(3:4)) with the best electrocatalytic activity for the HER was obtained with an onset potential of 98 mV, an overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm−2, a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1, and a long-term stability of at least 21 h.164 Similarly, they also reported a Cu-MOF mixed with AB as the electrocatalyst for the HER.56 Lin et al. reported the growth of Hf12-porphyrin-based MOFs on CNTs as electrocatalysts for the HER. Covalently-attached MOF nanoplates with conductive CNTs can improve the electron transfer from electrode to Co-porphyrin active sites and increase the number of active sites on the electrode surface.166 Presently, excellent works about enhanced electrocatalytic activity through conductive additives are few, thus much exploration is still needed.
In addition to MOFs, other CPMs have been used as electrocatalysts for the HER. POMs are outstanding inorganic nanoclusters showing excellent electrocatalytic activity towards water splitting, because of their reversible multi-electron transfer processes, arising from self-inherent electron and proton transfer and/or reservoir abilities. However, their low surface area and high solubility greatly weaken the electrocatalytic performance. To further improve the electrocatalytic performance of POMs, constructing POMOFs are efficient strategies. Pang and co-workers reported the first POM-encapsulated metal–organic nanotube (MONT) framework crystalline materials as electrocatalysts for the HER. By encapsulating POMs into the MONT framework, their electrocatalytic performances are greatly enhanced. Due to the low surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte, the catalytic performance of POMs is limited.171 They also reported 24-connected POMs encapsulated into 3D twenty-nuclear silver-tetrazole [Ag20(tta)16]4+ nanocage frameworks with good air stability and acid tolerance as electrocatalysts for the HER.172 Zhou and co-workers reported ultrastable POM-based MOFs constructed by Zn-ε-Keggin and H3BTB as superior electrocatalysts for the HER. Metal Mo acted as the active center, and the DFT calculation indicated that the μ3-bridging oxygen (Oa) site in Zn-ε-Keggin-Cl was favorable for H adsorption, thus enhancing the catalytic activity.163 Actually, as early as in 2011, Dolbecq and co-workers reported the “microenvironment effect” from ε-Keggin POMs entrapped in 3D-configured MOFs with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the HER.157 Subsequently, they reported POMs with different dimensionalities by using mixed organic ligands, which can tune their electrocatalytic performance for the HER in 2014.182 Furthermore, another POMOF-based electrocatalyst for the HER was also prepared by the same group in 2017. It was found that cations could influence the structure of POMs, thus tuning the HER performance. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) cations may play the role of charge compensating ions and structure-directing agents in the ε-Keggin based coordination polymers. These bulky ions occupy the voids delimited by the coordination networks so that none of these structures exhibit accessible porosity. Thus, divalent or monovalent counterions are used to replace TBA+. This indicates that monocationic counterions are more favorable than dicationic ones for the electrocatalytic activity.173
COFs possess high surface area, porosity and structural periodicity, which enable them as excellent electrocatalysts for the HER. In 2017, Pradhan and co-workers reported the first example of metal-free COFs as electrocatalysts for the HER. Pyrene and porphyrin were connected by π-electronic conjugation to obtain a microporous quasi-2D COF (SB-PORPy-COF). The imine nitrogen sites presented in the COF (–N) are considered as free docking sites for the HER. SB-PORPy-COF has shown an onset potential of 50 mV and a Tafel slope of 116 mV dec−1.174 Marinescu and co-workers reported a Co dithiolene CP based on ATTAc4 in 2017. Double-layer capacitance measurements, EIS studies, and Tafel analyses were used to understand the role of electrochemically accessible active sites, electron and charge transfer, and electrical integration between the catalyst and the support in the resultant electrocatalytic hydrogen evolving activity. Overpotentials to achieve 10 mA/cm2 ranging from 445 to 571 mV and from 388 to 527 mV for glassy carbon/CP and graphite/CP, respectively, were observed.176 Kandaiah and co-workers prepared mixed-metal-containing (Co, Ni, Cu) triazine thiolate CPs on a copper surface with improved electrocatalytic activity for the HER. Among them, Cu-NiTCA exhibited the best catalytic activity. The free nitrogen centers of the triazine ring facilitated the adsorption of H+ and transfer of proton. In addition, the mixed-metal had a coupling effect on the electrocatalytic performance.177 Xu et al. developed Cu-BHT nanoparticles as electrocatalysts for the HER. The nano-sized structure generated more grain boundaries and exposed more edge sites. DFT calculations indicated the Cu edge sites were the most active sites for the HER.178

5.2 CPMs as oxygen evolution catalysts
The OER is an important half reaction for electrocatalytic water splitting, and often follows a four-electron participant reaction with sluggish kinetics, which significantly limits the catalytic performance. An excellent electrocatalyst should have neither too strong nor too weak binding strength for OH, O, and OOH. CPMs have been more intensively used as electrocatalysts for the OER in recent years, due to their specific properties. Among these CPMs, MOFs are typical candidates widely applied in the OER. Meanwhile, designing 2D ultrathin MOFs, or bimetallic MOFs on conductive matrices are popular methods to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Ultrathin MOF nanosheets as electrocatalysts possess the following advantages: nanometer thickness allows rapid mass and electron transfer and ultrathin 2D nanosheets expose abundant CUMs, which greatly improve the electrocatalytic performance. The electrocatalytic activity of bimetallic or multiple metallic MOFs can be enhanced by the synergistic effect and altered electron density. The metal ions in MOFs often possess variable and high valence states, which benefit catalytic oxidation of water molecules for the OER. MOFs as electrocatalysts for the OER are more extensively reported than those for the HER. In this section, MOFs as electrocatalysts for the OER are summarized from the aspects of metal ions, organic ligands, and conductive additives. Similar to the HER, the real electrocatalytic active sites for the OER are the metal sites, while the other factors can positively tune the activity. Selected reports on CPMs as electrocatalysts for the OER are summarized in Table 5.

5.2.1 Active metal centers. 
The catalytic activity of metal ions for the OER arises from their variable and high valence states. There are two cases for the real active sites of metal ions. One is the pristine metal ions in MOFs with the same morphology, components and crystal structures before and after the catalytic reaction, and the other is that metal ions in MOFs are reacted into MOH or oxidized into MOOH. There are many works about MOFs as electrocatalysts for the OER with ultrahigh stability, where their active sites are pristine metals in MOFs without changing into MOH or MOOH. Du et al. reported the first synthesis of a nickel phthalocyanine-based 2D MOF as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation, exhibiting ultrahigh durability up to 50 h.212 Qiao et al. found that Cd-BIF-89 could incorporate Fe3+ at the atomic level via uncoordinated carboxylic groups to form Fe@BIF-89-NF.206 Moreover, multiple metals in MOFs possessing coupling effects can change the electron cloud configuration, thus tuning the catalytic activity. Among them, 2D MOFs are most commonly chosen, because of the advantages of more exposed active sites and facilitated electron and proton transfer. Tang et al. synthesized 2D ultrathin NiCo-MOF nanosheets loaded on copper foam with admirable electrocatalytic activity for the OER in 2016. Notably, the as-formed electrocatalyst was extremely stable at a constant overpotential of 0.25 V for at least 200 hours. Characterizations and DFT calculations proved that the excellent electrocatalytic performance resulted from the coupling effect between Ni and Co (as illustrated in Fig. 21), and CUMs.183 Wang and co-workers chose NiFe-UMNs with 2D ultrathin nanosheets as electrocatalysts for the OER.184 Similar to the reaction mechanism to the above-mentioned work, Lin et al. prepared NiFe-based MOF nanosheets grown in situ on NF namely MIL-53(FeNi)/NF, with long-term stability.185 Lan and co-workers reported a series of stable MOFs (NNU-21-24) with high stability up to 15 h when evaluated as electrocatalysts for the OER,186 Wang et al. reported NiFe-MOFs deposited on NF, and the Ni species were the active centers.213 Lang and co-workers reported trimetallic MOFs (Fe/Ni/Co(Mn)-MIL-53) grown on NF with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the OER, and the active sites were Ni species.187 Liu et al. developed lattice-strained transition metal MOFs as highly active bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts prepared by a facile and controllable process to photoinduce lattice strain (Fig. 22).214

Reproduced from ref. 214 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright [2019]. 
Different from the reaction mechanism in the above-mentioned works, there are many studies about metal ions in MOFs changing into MOH or oxidizing into MOOH as active sites for the OER. Zhao and co-workers reported a series of 2D MOFs with ultrathin nanosheets grown in situ on supports via a facile one-step chemical bath deposition method and used them as electrocatalysts for the OER. Among them, NiFe-MOFs exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance for the OER in terms of low overpotential of 240 mV and Tafel slope of 34 mV dec−1. Meanwhile, NiO6 inside the MOF was oxidized into NiO6/NiOOH species, which acted as active centers. Fe impurities introduced additional structural vacancies enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-based catalysts. Liu and co-workers reported an ultrathin NiCo-MOF nanosheet via a facile in situ transformation from layered double hydroxides strategy on conductive substrates. During the electrocatalysis process, Ni2+ was transformed into NiOOH.188 Sun et al. obtained Fe-MOF nanoparticles deposited on 2D Ni-MOFs at room temperature. The veritable active species for oxidation water splitting was NiO/NiOOH, which was verified by ex situ TEM and Raman spectra.189 In 2019, Lang and co-workers synthesized a lamellar MOF ([Ni3(OH)2(1,4-BDC)2-(H2O)4]·2H2O) with excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER.192 MOOH was detected during the reaction. In addition, the introduction of Fe significantly enhanced the catalytic performance of Ni–Fe-MOF nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 23, Fe serving as the active site in the bimetallic Ni–Fe-MOF nanosheets could greatly contribute to the enhanced OER performance. In 2019, our group reported a series of mixed Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs synthesized by straightforward sonication as electrocatalysts for the OER, and studied the catalytic mechanism through ex situ means, indicating that mixed Ni-MOFs and Fe-MOFs partially converted to NiFe-LDH which were the real active sites for the OER. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the reaction mechanism in the OER for later studies.194

5.2.2 The space around active sites. 
The numbers of organic ligands have a great influence on the structure of MOFs and the adsorption energy of metal sites by charge redistribution, thus tuning the electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Zhang and co-workers reported a Fe:2D-Co-NS@Ni material with enhanced electrocatalytic performance. First, a 3D-Co@Ni MOF constructed with H2dhbdc2− as pillars and [Co6O(dhbdc)2]2+ as layers was obtained. When the 3D-Co@Ni was used as electrocatalysts for the OER, the pillars were oxidized into 2-oxocyclopenta-3,5-diene-1,3-dicarboxylic acid by electrochemical exfoliation, showing a tendency to leave the layers to form 2D-Co-NS@Ni. By doping with Fe, the final product exhibited excellent catalytic performance with durability up to 96 h.207 For the first time, Wang et al. obtained CUMs in ZIF-67 through dielectric barrier discharge plasma etching as an electrocatalyst for water splitting. Dimethylimidazole (2-Hmim) ligands were partially removed by plasma etching to form CUMs, and the remaining ligands maintained the framework integrity.200
The H2BDC ligand with exposed carboxyl groups is beneficial to improve the OER activity by enhancing the hydrophilicity and availability of OH−. Meanwhile, the functional H2BDC can endow MOFs with better catalytic activity. Thus, H2BDC and functional H2BDC are the most common organic ligands to construct MOF electrocatalysts for the OER. Li et al. employed a mixture of organic ligands to improve the electrocatalytic activity for the OER. In their work, H2BDC and NH2-BDC were connected with metals to assemble A2.7B-MOF-FeCo1.6. Different linkage ratios could change the electronic structure. Densities of states (DOS) based on first-principles calculations indicated that introducing the secondary link could make partial electrons more delocalized, thus resulting in the transference of electrons to the 3d orbital of Co and the formation of CoOOH.197
Although multiple or functional organic ligands are used to enhance catalytic activity and have achieved improvement, the low conductivity is still a fatal factor weakening activity. In recent years, constructing conductive MOFs has become more popular to improve the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. Cao and co-workers used HHTP and Co2+ to construct conductive [Co3(HHTP)2] MOF nanosheets with different layers as electrocatalysts for the OER.208
There are other factors that can tune the activity, such as counter ions. Zhang and Li et al. obtained a MAF-X27-OH electrocatalyst via ion exchange of MAF-X27-Cl for the OER. Isotope tracing experiments further confirmed that the hydroxide ligands changed the reaction pathway during the OER process, which tended to provide a low-energy intra-framework coupling pathway.209
Precious metal or non-precious metal compounds with high conductivity or electrocatalytic activity are usually inserted into or loaded on MOFs to improve performance. For example, Alkordi and co-workers reported Ni-loaded Zr-MOF growth on graphene (UiO66-NH2-Ni@G). Ni and Zr species were converted into Ni(OH)2–Zr(OH)4, and the actual active sites were Ni(OH)2. Additionally, the synergistic effect among Ni(OH)2, Zr(OH)4 and graphene improved the electrocatalytic activity.196 Zhang et al. found that the electrocatalytic activity for the OER of a Co-MOF was enhanced by the introduction of non-3d metals. This as-formed electrocatalyst was shown to have exhibited the best activity for the OER in neutral solution. The non-3d metals can change the Co charge/oxidation state, thus increasing the affinity to polar H2O molecules.202 In addition, inserting precious metals into MOFs has also been shown as an effective method to enhance activity. The existence of precious metals not only enhances the conductivity but also tunes the metal active sites in MOFs to high valence states. Zhang and co-workers introduced Pt nanoparticles into Co3[Fe(CN)6]2 to improve the electrocatalytic activity for the OER.215 Pang et al. reported Ag nanowire-inserted ZIF-67 as electrocatalysts for the OER and found that Ag nanowires could enhance the conductivity of the composite, and facilitate the penetration/transportation of electrolyte ions to improve performance.203


5.2.3 Electronic transport boosters. 
Similar to the HER, to further improve the electrocatalytic performance of MOFs for the OER, conductivity should be improved. Many researchers have chosen the combination of MOFs with conductive carbon substrates, such as CNTs and graphene. Ma and co-workers reported the hybrids of Co-MOFs and CNTs as electrocatalysts for the OER with comparable catalytic activity to RuO2.109 Alkordi et al. prepared a Ni-loaded Zr-MOF grown on graphene composites and found that the introduced graphene had a significant influence on OER activity.196
Additionally, introducing conductive organic molecules into MOFs can also improve conductivity. Pang and co-workers reported the first example of a π-conjugated HHTP molecule coated on ZIF-67 to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of catalysts. The coating of HHTP on ZIF-67 could accelerate the transfer of electron and increase the valence of Co.204 Lin et al. anchored the bpy ligands to a graphene-modified electrode followed by treatment with metal nitrate solutions (Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Cu2+) to obtain M-bpy-GO-ITO with high electrocatalytic activity in neutral aqueous solutions.216
COFs can exhibit good electrocatalytic activity, due to their mechanically robust architectures, low density, and highly accessible surface area. Kurungot and co-workers reported that a bipyridine-containing COF (TpBpy) was utilized as an OER catalyst by way of engineering active Co(II) ions into its porous framework.210 Arne Thomas et al. reported hierarchical COF structures with macropores in addition to their inherent microporosity via a template-assisted method. Fast mass and ion transport in hierarchical COFs have been confirmed by utilizing cobalt-coordinated bipyridine-based COFs as an OER catalyst.211

6. Conclusions and perspectives
Currently, the development of novel electrode materials or catalysts to meet the urgent demand for high-performance energy-related devices is of particular significance. Due to the advantages of abundant active metal/ligand centers, tunable structure, high surface area and feasible hybridization with other components, CPMs have shown great potential in many fields; particularly, the powerful capability of applying CPM-based materials as electrodes or catalysts in energy storage and conversion applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, CO2 conversion and utilization, and water splitting has been adequately demonstrated. Diversified building blocks and design principles endow CPMs with multifunctional active sites including metal ions, organic linkers, and the space around them, such as pore structures, surface areas, morphologies, and size and have enabled diverse charge storage mechanisms and reaction types. This review covers the current research frontiers of CPMs applied in metal-ion batteries, metal–air batteries, fuel cells, CO2 conversion, and water splitting systems. Meanwhile, the electrochemically active sites in each energy storage and conversion system are also summarized and discussed in detail, which shows the milestones and guidelines.
In terms of metal-ion batteries, many traditional CPMs, as excellent candidates, were investigated as cathode or anode materials. It has been confirmed that some multivalent metal ions (Mn, V, Ni, Cu and Fe, etc.) and organic functional groups (carbonyl group, diimide, amine, quinone, etc.) in CPMs can be considered as active sites in the reversible redox reaction without the collapse of CPMs. By rational design of CPMs, the coexistence of redox-active sites in both metal centers and ligands can be achieved for more metal-ion storage per unit. Additionally, porosities, sizes, and morphologies of CPMs can also influence the space around open active sites. Effective strategies of pore-creating and 2D layer exfoliation of CPMs were approved to expose more active sites and improve electronic conductivity for high specific capacity and excellent rate performance. Currently, CPMs are evaluated as electrolyte carriers or separators at the infant stage, and many researchers are focused on MOFs in which rich open metal sites can immobilize anions for effective transport of alkali metal ions. Therefore, ionic channel design in CPM-based electrolyte systems has great perspectives and promotes the development of new-generation energy storage devices in the near future.
With respect to CO2 conversion, CPMs also show great potential not only in metal–air batteries and fuel cells, but also in Li–CO2 batteries and electrochemical CO2 reduction. Similar to metal-ion batteries, metal ions and high-activity metal-oxyhydroxides, formed by the damage of CPM frameworks, are main active sites to boost the electrochemical performance of CPMs, and Mn generally delivers better electrocatalytic activity than other metal ions such as Ni, Fe, and Co. In addition, metal-containing organic linkers, especially M–N4 and M–O6 types (where “M” represents Fe, Co, Ni in M–N4 and Co, Ni in M–O6), and porphyrin-based building blocks also act as ideal activity centers to enhance catalytic properties. Besides the similar role of porosity for CPMs improving the permeability of electrolytes, the self-inherent porous structure and channel characteristics are more favorable for adsorbing and fixing gas molecules, and acting as a sieve to restrain the shuttling of a redox mediator species.
For water splitting, the current study of CPMs as electrocatalysts is at an early stage, especially for COFs and POMOFs. Compared with HER catalysts, CPMs are more extensively used as OER catalysts. In general, metal ions (usually Fe, Co, Ni) in CPMs are the active sites for electrocatalyzing water splitting, and organic ligands and additional guest molecules also have a great influence on the electrocatalytic performance. Among them, 2D MOFs often exhibit better electrocatalytic performance, because 2D MOFs expose more active sites and facilitate the transfer of electrons and protons. In addition, single metal MOFs often exhibit lower catalytic activity than multiple metal MOFs. The coupling effect between multiple metals can enhance the catalytic performance. The electrical conductivity and stability of CPMs play a critical role in the electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. Thus, designing conductive CPMs with excellent stability is an important research interest.
By virtue of structural and compositional design in aspects of active sites and structure, CPMs have been commercially used in the fields of gas adsorption, storage, and separation. In the electrochemical storage and conversion field, the synergistic effect among active sites, the space around them and other aspects is more significant than their individual factor, which can greatly promote the improvement of the electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is reasonably considered that the design of highly electrochemically active CPMs can be engaged in summing up the electrochemically active sites, which was not confined to metal nodes and linkers but extended to the pore, crystal structure, morphology, and other aspects. There is still a long way to go in achieving the practical application of CPMs in fabricating high-performance electrochemical materials and intensive efforts are still devoted to the application of CPMs. The challenges associated with CPMs in electrochemical fields include the following:
(1) The intrinsic characteristics of CPMs are important to their electrochemical performance. At present, a large disparity exists between CPMs and traditional inorganic materials in terms of electrical/ionic conductivity. Controllable selection of CPMs and construction of active sites based on required features are effective strategies for enhancing electrochemical performance. For instance, as an electrode or electrocatalyst, conductive CPMs and CPMs/conductive matrix composites are more efficient for improved electron transport. For aspects of separators and solid–electrolyte carriers, the modification of anion active sites in the frame of CPMs is helpful for specific-cation conductivity.
(2) The stability of CPMs in specific systems should also be taken seriously. Collapse or chemical compositional changes have often happened, and CPM structures are easy to change under severe conditions. It is important to clarify which is the active site. Indeed, many active centers stem from CPM derivatives, especially in electrocatalytic processes.
(3) Rational design of the CPMs and the functional pasts of devices is worthy of emphatic attention. The space around the active sites of CPMs enables them to influence the final established properties, including pore, size, and dimension designs. For instance, 2D CPMs are generally considered to exhibit higher electronic conductivity and more active sites, especially in certain surface-controlled reactions, which is significantly essential to mass/electronic transport and obtaining more exposed active sites.
(4) Though much progress has been achieved by CPMs in energy-related systems, a thorough understanding of the electrochemical reaction and conversion mechanisms of CPMs, which is beneficial to the targeted construction of CPM materials with more abundant active sites and excellent electrochemical/electrocatalytic performance is still lacking. Thus, a variety of advanced in situ techniques including HEXRD, XAFS, and HAXPES, which were used for precisely analyzing the relationship between electrochemical/electrocatalytic performance and metal, ligands, porosities, and channel characteristics of CPM materials, are urgently suggested.

 	Fig. 21  DFT calculation for the OER on UMOFNs: (a) primitive steps of the OER process on UMOFNs surfaces. Colour scheme for chemical representation: green for metal S1 (Ni/Co), purple for metal S2 (Ni/Co), red for O, grey for C, and white for H. The Roman numerals represent the (i) adsorption step, (ii and iii) dissociation steps and (iv) desorption step during the OER process; (b) standard free energy diagram of the OER process on UMOFNs surfaces; (c) schematic representation of the electronic coupling between Co and Ni in UMOFNs. Reproduced from ref. 183 with permission from Springer Nature, copyright [2016].	 

 	Fig. 22  Structural characterizations of lattice-strained MOFs. (a–d) HRTEM (top) and SEM (bottom) images of the pristine (a), 1.7%- (b), 3.6%- (c) and 4.3%- (d) MOFs, enlarged XRD (e) and XRD (f) patterns for the pristine, 1.7%-, 3.6%- and 4.3%-MOFs, and the XRD simulation of the NiFe MOF (turquoise bars); (g) schematic of the crystal structure variation of NiFe MOFs under ultraviolet irradiation.
