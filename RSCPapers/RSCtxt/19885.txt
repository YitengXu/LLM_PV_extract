    , Accepted 7th September 2020First published on 8th September 2020AbstractWe present a novel, foam-type, high surface area electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that is not only highly selective toward n-propanol (PrOH) formation (FEPrOH = 13.7%, jPrOH = −1.15 mA cm−2) at relatively low overpotentials (−0.65 V vs. RHE) but also demonstrates an excellent long-term stability during CO2 electrolysis experiments of 102 h in duration. A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 °C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd9Cu91 alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at −0.65 V vs. RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated by operando Raman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd9Cu91 foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway. The improved product selectivity towards the highly valuable C3 alcohol is rationalized by an efficient and concerted spillover of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (*CO) and atomic hydrogen (*H) species from the Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains of the oxide-derived Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst where the C–C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation processes take place to form the targeted oxygenate product.
Introduction
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into high energy density fuels or valuable chemicals is considered a promising approach for mitigating anthropogenic contributions to the steadily increasing CO2 content (currently ∼410 ppm) of our atmosphere.1–4 This so-called power-to-X concept becomes particularly appealing when the surplus of renewable electric energy from hydro, solar, or wind sources is used to power the highly endergonic CO2 conversion process. Catalysts are needed for this electrochemical transformation not only to accelerate the kinetically hindered CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) but also to guide the process towards the desired reaction products.5,6 Recent studies have demonstrated that, not only the chemical nature of the catalyst but also its morphology at various length scales which dictates the resulting CO2RR product distribution.7,8
Among the various catalysts studied thus far, Cu stands out as the only mono-metallic material that can produce multiple hydrocarbons and oxygenates of various chain lengths from CO2.9–14 Higher alcohols are particularly desirable due to their high volumetric energy density (e.g. n-propanol: 27.0 MJ L−1). They can be considered synthetic energy carriers of high added-value that are essential for the so-called energy transition.9,11,15–21
In early related studies, Hori et al. observed the formation of n-propanol on Cu foil.22 However, the reported faradaic efficiency was rather low (FEPrOH = 3.0% at −1.44 V vs. NHE). In principle, an improvement of the selectivity towards alcohols can be achieved by a partial or complete oxidation of the Cu catalyst prior to the CO2 electrolysis. The formed cuprous and cupric oxides are considered to be precursors of the active catalyst material and, under the harsh experimental conditions commonly applied for the CO2RR, typically undergo rapid electroreduction thereby accomplishing catalyst activation and the formation of the low-coordinated sites that are required for C–C coupling and subsequent alcohol formation.23–25
As an example, Rahaman et al. reported improved efficiencies of ethanol (EtOH) and n-propanol (PrOH) formation of FEEtOH = 10.4% and FEPrOH = 13.1%, respectively, at −0.90 V vs. RHE on oxide-derived dendritic Cu catalysts.26 A similar mixture of EtOH and PrOH was obtained by Ren et al. with Cu nanocrystal agglomerates (FEPrOH = 10.6% and FEEtOH = 7.7% at −0.85 V vs. RHE).27 Activation by plasma treatment also yields a slightly higher selectivity towards the C2 alcohol (FEEtOH = 17% and FEPrOH = 8.1% at −0.95 V vs. RHE).28 To date, the highest reported PrOH efficiency still do not exceed 15% (FEEtOH = 13% and FEPrOH = 15% at −0.95 V vs. RHE).29 So there is much room to improve the PrOH selectivity.
One crucial requirement for the production of higher alcohols is the sufficient abundance of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (*CO, the asterisk refers to an adsorbed state) which forms as a key intermediate in the course of the CO2RR.30 The further stabilization of *CO on the catalytically active surface is particularly important as the CO dimerization (C–C coupling) process ideally takes place in an early stage of alcohol formation.
Attempting to further increase the product selectivity towards C2 or C3 oxygenates therefore, often relies on the addition of a second catalyst component to the activated Cu (C–C coupler, alcohol producer), which selectively produces CO (CO producer).31 Obvious candidates for the CO forming catalysts, according to the CO2RR catalyst classification scheme introduced by Hori et al., are Zn, Ag, Au, and Pd.22 Pd nanoparticles have recently been employed to produce CO at medium overpotentials with a high selectivity reaching FECO values of ∼90%.32 However, one particular drawback of Pd as the CO-producing component is related to its comparably high affinity for CO chemisorption, which can lead to irreversible catalyst poisoning in the course of extended CO2 electrolyses as demonstrated in several studies.33,34 One promising approach for tackling the shortcoming of this CO2RR catalyst is based on the co-alloying of Pd, e.g., with Cu. This approach is known to reduce the binding strength of *CO to the catalyst sites35,36 with the result that CO can be released more easily from the catalyst during extended electrolyses thus preventing any irreversible poisoning of the catalyst by strong CO chemisorption.37 At the same time, co-alloying Pd with Cu introduces the required C–C coupling component and, if further activated, the actual ‘alcohol forming phases’ to the catalytic system. A further beneficial role of the Pd, embedded into the Cu matrix of the binary alloy, is associated to the required hydrogenation reaction of the C–C coupled reaction intermediates. This is due to the moderate hydrogen adsorption energy of the *H reactant on the Pd in combination with its facile transfer to the adjacent Cu sites where the actual hydrogenation reaction of the C–C coupled intermediated is supposed to take place.38
In this study, we apply the so-called dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach7,39,40 to form binary high surface area alloy catalysts containing Cu and Pd as the major and minor components, respectively. This approach was originally developed by Shin et al. for mono-metallic Cu40 and Sn39 systems, based on the superposition of the metal electroplating (primary process) by a massive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, secondary process) at high cathodic current densities of up to −3 A cm−2. H2 bubbles, which evolve at the cathode surface due to the rigorous HER, act as a temporary geometric template for the metal foaming process.7,8,39–42
In particular when C–C coupled alcohols are targeted as the CO2RR product, it is mandatory to further activate the Cu component prior to the actual CO2RR, e.g. by oxidation.26 For this purpose we applied a thermal annealing treatment (200 °C for 12 h in air) to the as-deposited homogeneous alloy foam, which resulted in significant morphological and compositional changes of the material, a process that can be probed by so-called identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) imaging. The catalyst pretreatment was completed by applying −0.65 V vs. RHE cathodic potentials that transforms the oxides into a phase-separated metallic catalyst (oxide-derived) which is essential for multicarbon alcohol formation. A maximum efficiency of 13.7 ± 0.8% PrOH (jPrOH = −1.15 mA cm−2) was obtained by this approach at relatively low overpotentials of −0.65 V vs. RHE, with only 7.1 ± 0.3% of EtOH (jEtOH = −0.60 mA cm−2) as a minor oxygenate product, providing a remarkable C3 alcohol selectivity that was two times higher than the respective C2 alcohol yield.
Extended catalyst stressing experiments of >100 h in duration demonstrate a superior degradation stability of the binary CuPd alloy foam catalyst with average total faradaic efficiencies of alcohol formation never decreasing to values less than 18%. More importantly, the high PrOH selectivity is also maintained during the extended electrolyses experiments.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
The Cu foil (99.99% pure) was purchased from Goodfellow (initial dimension 10 cm × 10 cm) and cut into pieces measuring 8 mm × 25 mm. The Cu foils served as substrates for catalyst preparation by means of hydrogen bubble assisted alloy electrodeposition. Na2PdCl4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) and CuSO4·5H2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) served as metal precursors for the plating step. KHCO3 (ACS grade) and K2SO4 (ACS grade) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. ACS grade H2SO4 (Sigma) was used to prepare the plating bath. All chemicals were used without further purification. Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm, 4 ppb of total organic carbon content) was used for the preparation of all solutions.
Catalyst preparation
Prior to alloy electrodeposition the Cu foil substrate was electropolished in 50% phosphoric acid (ACS grade, Sigma Aldrich) to remove the native oxide layer from its surface. For this pre-treatment step, a two electrode arrangement that consisted of a graphite foil and the Cu foil serving as cathode and anode, respectively, was used. A potential difference of 2.0 V was applied for 2 min. After electropolishing, the Cu foil was thoroughly rinsed in Milli-Q water, subsequently sonicated in ethanol for 15 min, and finally dried in air before use.
To obtain a well-defined geometric surface area of 1 cm2 the Cu foil substrate was masked with an insulating PTFE tape. Unless otherwise stated, alloy deposition was carried out using a plating bath containing Na2PdCl4 and CuSO4·5H2O metal ion sources (1:9 ratio, 25 mM) in 1.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (pH ∼ 0.5). A three-electrode arrangement, consisting of a Pt foil (4 cm × 3 cm, counter electrode), an Ag/AgCl3M reference electrode (Metrohm), and the Cu foil substrate serving as the working electrode, was used for electrodeposition. A constant current density of −3 A cm−2 was applied for 40 s. After deposition, the formed metal foams were gently rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove excess electrolyte.
For the majority of the CO2 electrolysis experiments the PdCu foam catalyst were further activated by 12 h of thermal annealing in air at a temperature of 200 °C using a tube furnace (GERO, GmbH, Germany). Catalyst activation was completed by an electrochemical reduction of the formed oxidic precursor in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution for 45 min at an applied potential of −0.65 V vs. RHE. The individual steps of the catalyst preparation and activation procedure are schematically shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Scheme illustrating individual preparation and activation steps of the Pd9Cu91 catalyst. 
The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the as-deposited as well as the activated PdCu foam catalysts was determined based on voltammetric measurements using di-methyl viologen as a reversible redox probe. This procedure has been described in detail elsewhere.7
CO2 electrolysis experiments
All electrochemical measurements were carried out using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm Autolab 128N, The Netherlands). Prior to the electrolysis experiments, the cell resistance was measured by means of impedance spectroscopy. All potentials reported herein are iR-corrected. The CO2RR was carried out at room temperature using a custom-made H-type glass cell where the two compartments were separated by a cation exchange membrane (Nafion 117, Electrochem, USA). Aqueous 0.5 M KHCO3 solution was used as electrolyte. A leakless Ag/AgCl3M (EDAQ) served as the reference electrode, a Pt foil (15 mm × 5 mm, 99.95%, Alfa Aesar) was used as the counter (anode), and the CuPd foam catalyst served as the working electrode (cathode). Prior to commencing CO2 electrolysis, both the anolyte and the catholyte were purged with CO2 (99.9999%, Carbagas, Switzerland) at a flow rate of ∼30 mL min−1 at least for 30 min. During the electrolysis, the catholyte was constantly purged with CO2 at a flow rate of ∼13 mL min−1.
For the sake of comparability, all potentials, recorded versus the Ag/AgCl3M electrode, were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation:ERHE (V) = EAg/AgCl3M (V) + 0.210 V + (0.0591 V × pH)
The quantification of the gaseous and non-gaseous reaction products by means of gas-chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography is described elsewhere.7,26
According to the post-electrolysis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, Pt was detected neither in the separated catholyte compartment nor on the catalyst surface. Any interference of Pt dissolution at the anode during electrolysis can thus be excluded.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
XRD analyses of the as-prepared (ap), thermally annealed (ta), and oxide-derived (od) PdCu catalysts were carried out by means of powder XRD (Bruker D8) using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1540 nm, 40 mA) generated at 40 keV. Scans were recorded at 1° min−1 for 2θ values ranging from 20 to 90°. The obtained XRD patterns were analyzed and compared with JCPD (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction) standards for different pure metals, bimetallic alloy materials (Cu, Pd, and CuPd alloy) and corresponding oxide phases (CuO, Cu2O, CuPdO3). An activated graphite foil was used as the substrate for all XRD analyses to avoid undesirable contributions of the substrate to the XRD pattern of the PdCu alloy sample of interest.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
The morphology and composition of the as-prepared and oxide-derived CuPd catalysts were studied by means of a FE Zeiss DSM 982 SEM instrument equipped with a Noran SIX NSS200 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
XPS studies were performed by means of Al-Kα radiation sources which was operated at 150 W with an Omicron Multiprobe (Omicron Nano Technology) spectrometer coupled to an EA 125 (Omicron) hemi-spherical analyzer. C 1s peak was used as reference and the fitting was performed using CasaXPS software. Note that, the samples were used for the XPS analyses without any further modifications (e.g. metal sputtering).
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
HR-TEM and HAADF-STEM were carried out by a Thermo Scientific Talos F200X G2 TEM (FEI, operating voltage 200 kV). For these measurements, the catalyst materials were gently removed from the Cu foil substrate, dispersed in ethanol by sonication, and subsequently drop-casted on a carbon coated Ni grid (300 mesh).
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
The bulk elemental composition has been studied by ICP-OES analysis (Thermo Scientific iCAP 7400 ICP-OES DUO). The PdCu metal foams have been dissolved in 30% HNO3 for ICP-OES analysis. The time-dependent monitoring of the electrolyte chemical composition (metal content) has been carried out using a NexION 2000 ICP-MS instrument (PerkinElmer).

Operando Raman spectroscopy
Details of the operando Raman spectroscopy have been described elsewhere.43 The spectroscopic analysis was conducted by means of a LabRAM HR800 confocal microscope (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Spectral data were collected with Lab Space 3.0 software. A large working distance objective lens (50× magnification, 8 mm focal length) was applied with a numerical aperture of 0.1 in order to focus a diode-pumped solid-state laser beam (excitation wavelength 633 nm, DPSS laser, power 3 mW) on the sample and collect the incident and scattered laser light. A home-made spectro-electrochemical cell made of Kel-F was used for the spectro-electrochemical experiments. The spectro-electrochemical cell consisted of a Ag/AgCl reference (EDAQ) electrode whereas a Au-wire served as the counter electrode. A μ-Autolab III (EcoChemie) potentiostat was used for the electrochemical measurements. Raman spectra were collected in the spectral range of 100–2500 cm−1. For the data acquisition during the potentiostatic experiments, the holding time was 120 s at each applied electrolysis potential.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the catalyst
The PdCu alloy foam, used herein for the CO2RR experiments, contains a nominal composition of 9 at% Pd (minor component) and 91 at% Cu (major matrix component) and thus named as Pd9Cu91. This ‘integral’ bulk composition was determined on the basis of quantitative ICP-OES measurements. EDX analysis, which is more sensitive to the near-surface region of the catalyst and thus is a more spatially-confined method, yielded, however, comparable results of 7 at% Pd and 93 at% Cu (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Note, however, that the EDX analysis is only semi-quantitative and that chemical composition of the outermost surface and the near-surface ‘bulk’ region of the deposit might slightly deviate from that of the bulk material. In the following we denote the catalysts analyzed herein according to their stage of preparation/activation as ap-Pd9Cu91 (as-prepared), ta-Pd9Cu91 (thermally-annealed), and od-Pd9Cu91 (oxide-derived). This notation assumes that thermal annealing and the subsequent electrochemical (ec) reduction of the oxidic precursor don't lead substantial changes in the integral ‘bulk’ composition of the foam material. This assumption is in agreement with ICP-OES analyses of ap-Pd9Cu91 and od-Pd9Cu91 samples which provide similar % of Pd and Cu as bulk compositions of the materials. The term ‘oxide-derived’ (od) refers to the state of the annealed catalyst after the electrochemical pretreatment (45 min at −0.65 V vs. RHE in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, pH 7.2), assuming that it represents the stable metallic state under reactive conditions during the CO2RR experiments. Fig. 1 depicts the individual preparation and activation steps of the bimetallic Pd9Cu91 catalyst used throughout this study.

Fig. 2 shows a collection of representative identical location (IL)-SEM micrographs of the ap-Pd9Cu91 (panels a–d), the ta-Pd9Cu91 (panels e–h), and the od-Pd9Cu91 sample (panels i–l), demonstrating morphological alterations of the as-prepared alloy foam that are due to thermal annealing treatment and the subsequent electrochemical reduction of the oxidic catalyst precursor. The SEM images (panel a) reveal a three-dimensional architecture of meso-pores (primary porosity) with a mean surface diameter of 23 ± 3 μm. This value corresponds well to the respective depth of the topmost meso-pores of 25 ± 2 μm, as determined by white-light interferometry analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†). As it can be seen, the porosity on the μm length scale neither changes upon thermal annealing (panel e) nor upon oxide reduction (panel i). Due to their dendritic nature, the sidewalls of the 3D foam structure reveal a secondary porosity on the nanometer length scale that is, in contrast to the meso-pores, significantly affected by the combined thermal and electrochemical catalyst pre-treatment. One prominent feature of the ap-Pd9Cu91 is the presence of textured nanometer-sized (∼50 nm) crystallites that often exhibit a cubic shape ((100) texture, e.g., see Fig. 2, panel d). SEM results of as-prepared pure Cu and pure Pd foams are also shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The cubic-shaped crystallites (in ap-Pd9Cu91) completely disappear upon thermal treatment due to the partial coalescence of the fine dendritic features that compose the pore sidewalls (Fig. 2, panel h). The ta-Pd9Cu91 foam undergoes further morphological changes in the course of the electrochemical oxide reduction at −0.65 V vs. RHE. Under these reductive conditions, nm-sized (10–50 nm) particles appear on the catalyst surface, further increasing the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) upon catalyst activation (see Fig. S4, ESI†). Similar morphological alterations, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, have also been reported for the activation of dendritic Cu and can be rationalized by the significant migration of oxygen and Cu associated with oxide precursors formation (thermal annealing) and their subsequent electroreduction.26

The IL-SEM analysis results are further supported by the complementary ex situ XRD analysis of the metallic and oxidic foams, as presented in Fig. 3. For comparison purposes, XRD data of pure Cu and Pd metallic foams are included in Fig. 3a. A comparison of the three diffractograms confirms the co-alloying of Pd and Cu in the ap-Pd9Cu91 sample. The (111), (200), and (220) diffraction peaks of the face centered cubic (fcc) ap-Pd9Cu91 sample appear at 2θ values of 42.73°, 49.74°, and 73.18°, which reside between the corresponding peaks reported for Cu (43.3°, 50.4°, and 74.1°; JCPDS: 85-1326) and Pd (40.2°, 46.8°, and 68.3°; JCPDS: 87-0638). The intense diffraction feature at 2θ ∼ 56° corresponds to the C(004) diffraction of the graphite foil support on which the metal foams were deposited for XRD inspection.
 Fig. 3  (a) X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-prepared (ap) pure Cu, pure Pd, and the Pd9Cu91 foam samples. (b) X-ray diffraction pattern of the Pd9Cu91 sample depending on the processing stage (as-prepared (ap), thermally annealed (ta), and oxide-derived (od)). Standard diffraction peaks and their corresponding JCPDS files are shown. 

Fig. 3b demonstrates alterations in the crystal structure of the ap-Pd9Cu91 that are associated with the thermal treatment and the subsequent oxide reduction. Clearly, all diffraction features of the fcc ap-Pd9Cu91 sample disappear after thermal annealing (see diffractogram of ta-Pd9Cu91), indicating the transformation of the metallic alloy into an oxidic form, which obviously affects not only the catalyst surface but the entire ‘bulk’ of the alloy foam. Note that this oxidation process causes a partial phase segregation into domains of copper oxide(s) and a mixed PdCu oxide phase. The Cu2O (200) and CuO (111) diffraction peaks appear at 2θ = 40.9° (JCPDS: 74-1230) and at 2θ = 38.76° (JCPDS: 80-1268), respectively. The mixed CuPdO3 oxide phase was identified via its (113) diffraction peak at 2θ = 35.32° (JCPDS: 48-0587).
Under reductive conditions, applied during the electrochemical part of the catalyst pre-treatment, these oxide phases are thermodynamically unstable and undergo rapid compositional and structural transitions back into their metallic state. Thus, there is no indication for the presence of any oxide phase with long-range transitional order after the electrochemical treatment (see diffractogram of the od-Pd9Cu91 sample in Fig. 3b). However, the partial phase segregation, initially started after thermal annealing treatment, is retained after the subsequent oxide reduction. As a consequence, a Cu-rich phase is formed which exhibits a Cu-like diffraction pattern with (111) plane at 2θ = 43.18° (JCPDS for Cu: 85-1326). Besides this major Cu-enriched phase, a second Pd-rich alloy phase develops, as deduced from the shift of the main (111) diffraction peak from 42.73° (ap-Pd9Cu91) to 41.34° (od-Pd9Cu91). An expansion of the crystal lattice towards the fcc Pd thus confirms enrichment by Pd (JCPDS for Pd: 87-0638) in the second phase (see Fig. 3).
The (metal → oxide → metal) transitions, observed in the XRD patterns, are also in full agreement with a complementary XPS analysis presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which shows the spin–orbit split Cu 2p (panel a) and Pd 3d (panel b) photoemissions of the Pd9Cu91 samples in their respective processing states. The appearance of characteristic shake-up satellites in the Cu 2p photoemission spectrum after thermal treatment indicates the presence of cupric CuO in the ta-Pd9Cu91 sample. It should be noted, however, that XPS cannot discriminate between metallic Cu and cuprous oxide (Cu2O) as both phases exhibit the same binding energy of BE(Cu 2p3/2) = ∼933 eV.44 The Pd 3d peak broadened after the annealing treatment and a Pd(II) component (PdO, BE(3d5/2) = ∼336.7 eV) was evident after peak deconvolution (Fig. S5, ESI†). After completion of the electrochemical pre-treatment, both the Cu 2p and Pd 3d emissions in the od-Pd9Cu91 exhibit the same features as the metallic ap-Pd9Cu91 sample, thus indicating the complete conversion of the intermediately formed oxide into a metallic catalyst under the applied reductive conditions (45 min at −0.65 V vs. RHE). Survey XPS analysis further proves that there is no contamination of other metals on the catalyst surface (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Operando Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4) further confirms the instability of the oxides, formed during thermal annealing of the alloy foam, under those electrochemical conditions applied for the catalyst activation (−0.65 V vs. RHE) and PrOH production (see below discussion of Fig. 7 and 8). Note the Raman spectroscopic experiment probes to some extent the bulk but in particular the surface conditions of the catalyst material.45Fig. 4a shows the potential-dependent evolution of operando Raman spectra for od-Pd9Cu91 in CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte where the potential is stepped from the open circuit potential (OCP) to those potentials relevant for the oxygenate production. Raman features at 518 cm−1 and 624 cm−1 are typically assigned to the presence of cuprous oxides.45–47 It becomes obvious that the oxides have already disappeared at 0 V vs. RHE prior to the actual onset of the CO2RR which in full agreement with previous results on pure Cu foam catalysts.31,45 Important to note is that the chemisorption of reactants, intermediate and products of the CO2RR starts only after the disappearance of the oxidic species from the catalyst surface at 0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4a). The Raman features at 283 cm−1 and 353 cm−1 (Fig. 4a, inset) can be assigned to the restricted rotational and vibrational modes of chemisorbed CO (*CO) on the binary PdCu catalyst which forms as key intermediate for the oxygenate products formation on Cu-based catalysts.45

Fig. 4b directly compares to the electrochemical part of the catalyst pre-treatment protocol where the potential is stepped from the OCP directly to −0.65 V vs. RHE using a ta-Pd9Cu91 sample. Within a few minutes (time needed to record the Raman spectrum) the oxide features have completely disappeared under the applied cathodic potential.
As suggested by the XRD data (Fig. 3), the consecutive (metal → oxide → metal) transitions leads to a phase segregation into Cu-rich and Pd-enriched domains. This hypothesis is further experimentally corroborated by combined TEM, HR-TEM, HAADF, and STEM-EDX analyses of the ap-Pd9Cu91 (a–d) and the od-Pd9Cu91 (e–h) sample, presented in Fig. 5. HR-TEM analysis identifies almost pure Cu domains in the dendrites of the foam after electrochemical oxide reduction (Fig. 5, panel f). Local changes in the chemical composition (Pd/Cu ratio) as a consequence of the oxidation/reduction treatment are further corroborated by the spatially-resolved STEM-EDX maps shown in panels d and h of Fig. 5. Three spots, indicated by the yellow frames (panel d), were analyzed in more detail by means of STEM-EDX. The EDX spot analysis reveals a chemical composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (scattering of ± 0.5%) which is in excellent agreement with the bulk composition of the ap-Pd9Cu91 sample determined on the basis of ICP-OES analysis. Visual inspection of the STEM-EDX mapping (panel d) confirms the homogeneous distribution of the Pd (minor component) in the Cu matrix prior to the catalyst activation treatment.

In total 10 different spots were analyzed by the STEM-EDX for their chemical composition on the od-Pd9Cu91 sample (Fig. 5, panel h). Two different kinds of surface domains can be distinguished on the catalyst surface as indicated by the black and green frames, respectively. Those regions, highlighted by the black frames, indicate Cu-rich domains with a mean chemical composition of ∼2 at% Pd and 98 at% Cu (±1% scattering) which can be found predominantly at the center of the dendritic features. Regions indicated by the green frames represent a PdCu alloy which is substantially enriched by Pd. The respective EDX analysis reveals a mean composition of ∼22 at% Pd and 78 at% Cu (±5% scattering). These Pd-enriched domains are preferentially observed at the outermost periphery of the dendritic features of the alloy foam. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the proposed preparation and activation procedure respective repetition experiments are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†) demonstrating a similar phase segregation phenomenon as shown in Fig. 5.
Not only the initial thermal annealing contributes to the observed phase segregation (see Fig. 3) of the ap-Pd9Cu91 catalyst but also its further activation under potential control. This can be concluded from complementary time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution during the oxide reduction reaction at −0.65 V vs. RHE. Form the work by Mayrhofer et al.48,49 it is known that a release of metal ions from an oxidized electrode surface into the bulk of the electrolyte preferentially takes place upon oxide reduction. The same phenomenon can be observed in the present case for the reductive activation of the ta-Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst. Fig. 6 depicts the time-dependent change of the Cu and Pd content in the CO2-saturated electrolyte during the electrolysis at −0.65 V vs. RHE. Also for the experiment shown in Fig. 6, the potential was stepped right after the sample immersion into electrolyte from the OCP to −0.65 V vs. RHE. It has, however, to be noted that already the contact of the ta-Pd9Cu91 sample to the electrolyte at OCP leads to a certain release of Cu components into the solution phase (cCu = 0.3 mg L−1 prior to the potential step to −0.65 V vs. RHE). This dissolution process is accelerated during the first minutes (<30 min) of the oxide-reduction which is superimposed on the electrolysis reaction (HER, CO2RR). The Cu content in the solution reaches a maximum of 0.54 mg L−1 at t = 5 min before it slowly drops down as a function of time. This experiment clearly demonstrates that the 45 min lasting catalyst pre-treatment at −0.65 V vs. RHE involves both (i) the initial dissolution and (ii) the subsequent partial re-deposition of Cu material on the alloy surface from the electrolyte phase. The applied potential of −0.65 V vs. RHE is well below the respective reversible Nernst potential for Cu deposition/dissolution. Interestingly these sequential dissolution and re-deposition processes are selective with regard to the less noble Cu component of the binary alloy whereas the minor Pd component is not affected by the oxide reduction. The Pd content in the solution phase remains almost 0 ppm over the entire analysis time.

Electrochemical performance
Systematic catalyst performance testing was carried out by potentiostatic electrolysis experiments in CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 (pH 7.2) using both the ap-Pd9Cu91 and the od-Pd9Cu91 samples. The applied electrolysis potentials ranged from −0.45 V to −0.95 V vs. RHE. A multi-catalyst approach has been applied for this screening where a newly-prepared catalyst was used for each screening experiment (3 h duration). Fig. 7a depicts the potential (E) dependent evolution of the product distribution (faradaic efficiency (FE)), represented as a plot of FE vs E for the ap-Pd9Cu91 sample.

(c) Alcohol efficiencies derived from the electrolysis carried out over the od-Pd9Cu91 sample. (d) Partial current densities of multicarbon alcohols. 
Formate is the main CO2RR product at low applied overpotentials reaching a maximum faradaic efficiency of FEformate = 42.7% (jformate = −1.2 mA cm−2) at −0.55 V vs. RHE. Both pure Pd and PdCu alloys have already been identified as excellent catalysts showing high efficiencies towards formate production at particularly low overpotentials.33,34,37 In the present case, the formate efficiency steadily decreases with increasing overpotentials reaching a value of FEformate = 12.5% at −0.95 V vs. RHE (see Table S1, ESI†). A similar trend is also observed for CO, starting from a maximum value of FECO = 35.6% (jCO = −0.52 mA cm−2) at lowest applied potentials of −0.45 V vs. RHE.37,50 Within the entire window of applied electrolysis potentials, hydrocarbon formation remains at a relatively low level and reaches a maximum C2 hydrocarbon efficiency of FEC2 = 12.3% (FEC2H4 = 8.2%, FEC2H6 = 4.1%) at −0.75 V vs. RHE. The sum of the FE values detected by online (head-space) gas-chromatography (for CO, H2, C2H4, and C2H6 detection) and post-electrolysis ion-exchange chromatography (for formate detection) reaches close to 100% irrespective of the applied electrolysis potential and thus demonstrating that all relevant major products were covered by this analysis approach. The result is obviously different when the CO2RR is carried out over the od-Pd9Cu91 catalyst, for which as much as 20% appears to be missing in the balance of total faradaic efficiencies (Fig. 7b). The reason for this discrepancy is due to the appearance of oxygenates as major CO2RR products. The results are depicted in panels c and d of Fig. 7. Both C2 (EtOH) and C3 (PrOH) alcohols form as CO2RR products, however, with a clear preference for PrOH. A maximum selectivity of FEPrOH = 13.7% (jPrOH = −1.15 mA cm−2) is observed at −0.65 V vs. RHE (Table S2, ESI†). The onset potential of PrOH formation (−0.45 V vs. RHE) and the electrolysis potential of maximum PrOH efficiency (−0.65 V vs. RHE) are both significantly shifted towards the positive direction (≈200 mV) in comparison to the CO2 electrolysis reactions carried out over ‘pure’ oxide-derived copper catalysts (Fig. S8, ESI†).9,26,27 The presented potential-dependent product distribution clearly demonstrates the beneficial catalytic effect of the co-alloyed Pd particularly in regard to the C3 alcohol formation (see discussion of the proposed reaction mechanism in Fig. 9 below). In contrast, the EtOH efficiency remains at a comparably low level (e.g., FEEtOH = 7.1% with jEtOH = −0.60 mA cm−2). Under these optimum electrolysis conditions, the PrOH efficiency is actually twice as high as that for EtOH. A representative GC chromatogram is provided in Fig. S9 (ESI†). In both the FE vs. E and the j vs. E plots, the trends of EtOH follow the ones for PrOH but at a significantly lower level. In contrast, previous studies indicated either similar FE values for PrOH and EtOH under optimized experimental conditions or a higher selectivity towards EtOH (see Table S3 for a comparison data, ESI†).26–29 Note that the maximum faradaic efficiency (FEPrOH) and the optimum rate of production (jPrOH) are obtained at different electrolysis potentials. The maximum partial current density for PrOH production, jPrOH = −2.50 mA cm−2, was observed at −0.85 V vs. RHE where the FEPrOH was 8.2% (Table S4, ESI†).

This set of long term experiments shows that we could store the catalyst for long time and reuse it when necessary.

To demonstrate the excellent stability of the novel PdCu foam catalyst against degradation, extended CO2 electrolysis experiments were performed at an applied potential of −0.65 V vs. RHE using od-Pd9Cu91 as the catalyst. Gaseous and liquid (PrOH, EtOH) products were quantified in intervals of 1 h for a total duration of 102 h (Fig. 8). The electrolyses consisted of an initial continuous section (first 30 h) and an extra sequence of discontinuous electrolysis experiments of variable duration (six 10 h and one 12 h experiments). The potential control was switched off after each electrolysis experiment, and the catalyst was stored in pure Milli-Q water at the open circuit potential (OCP) before the next electrolysis was started. The main purpose of these continuous-discontinuous, long-term experiments was to demonstrate whether the catalyst could be successfully stored for long time periods and reused whenever necessary. This long-term experiment actually represents a two-fold stressing of the catalyst achieved by (i) the prolonged CO2RR itself and (ii) the repetitive loss of potential control in combination with the storage of catalyst in an aqueous environment (Milli-Q water) at the OCP. Fig. 8a shows the current transient (wine curve) of the 102 h of electrolyses. The average steady state current density reached −7.5 mA cm−2. Slightly higher current densities were observed at the beginning of the individual electrolysis experiments (discontinuous 10/12 h section), likely corresponding to the reduction of surface oxides formed during the resting time when the catalyst was kept at the OCP in Milli-Q water. Irrespective of the applied interruptions the resulting steady-state current density remained largely stable over the entire period of 102 h. This can be considered as a first experimental indication for an excellent structural and compositional stability of the catalyst. As already argued for pure Cu catalysts, one important factor contributing to the chemical stability of the catalyst is the successful total suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon pathway.26
Methane production was identified as the mechanistic origin of an irreversible poisoning of the Cu surface with chemisorbed carbon species. In the present case, the absence of methane as one of the CO2RR products can also be considered beneficial for the observed long-term stability of the catalyst. During the first 30 h of continuous electrolysis, both the partial current density (panel a) and the corresponding faradaic efficiency (panel b) of PrOH formation increase with elapsing electrolysis time, from an initial value of jPrOH = −1.11 mA cm−2 (FEPrOH = 12.9%) to jPrOH = −1.25 mA cm−2 (FEPrOH = 13.9%). This trend is consistent with a slight decrease of the EtOH selectivity and the respective rate of production with time. However, the overall alcohol production rate does increase within the first 30 h period of the electrolysis reaction, thus proving that a continuous electrolysis does not cause any significant loss of catalytic performance, in particular with regard to the targeted C3 alcohol formation. Alterations in the catalyst's CO2RR activity appear to be more complex when the sequence of discontinuous electrolyses is applied. The initial reduction of the surface oxide species, which likely formed during the resting period under the OCP conditions, leads to a temporary increase in the overall current density as well as partial currents of both PrOH and EtOH (panel a) right after restarting of the electrolysis which, however, steadily drops down in the further course of the reaction. However, in the first four 10 h discontinuous electrolyses, FEPrOH reaches a steady state value of ∼13.4 ± 0.9% after approximately 4 h of electrolysis time, keeping the low FEEtOH of ∼6.8 ± 0.3% and thus maintaining the steady PrOH selectivity until nearly 70 h (Fig. 8b). After that time, FEPrOH starts to decrease slightly, which affects the PrOH selectivity. This result demonstrates that repetitive switching between the off and on state of electrolysis leads to a more significant degradation pattern than the (initial) continuous electrolysis experiment. CO and C2 hydrocarbon efficiencies decreased slightly with time whereas FEH2 increased with time (see panel c of Fig. 8). Combined HAADF, STEM-EDX, and SEM analyses confirm that the compositional and structural characteristics of the od-Pd9Cu91 catalyst are preserved even after prolonged electrolysis at −0.65 V vs. RHE (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†).
Mechanistic explanation
The experimental data presented herein can be considered as a prime example of a CO2RR catalyst material that undergoes significant structural and compositional changes during the activation stage of subsequent thermal and electrochemical pre-treatment thereby creating those electrocatalytically active sites that govern the resulting product distribution. The design of our catalyst is based on the combination of a *CO and *H forming component with a C–C coupler and alcohol-former component, which follows the similar concept of recently published bimetallic AgCu catalysts for selective ethanol production where the ethanol selectivity was rationalized by a spillover effect and the improved abundance of CO as the key intermediate of C–C coupled CO2RR products in comparison to pristine Cu.31,51,52 According to Dutta et al., segregated domains of pure Ag take over the role of the CO formation whereas the Cu, activated by thermal annealing prior to the CO2RR, transforms the formed CO into ethanol with a high selectivity, reaching FEEtOH = 33.7% at −1.0 V vs. RHE.31 Due to the limited miscibility of Ag and Cu, efficient phase segregation is easily achieved during the initial foam electrodeposition stage.31,53 In contrast, Pd and Cu show a strong tendency towards co-alloying, thus resulting in a rather homogeneous distribution of the Pd in the Cu matrix of the as-prepared foam (Fig. 5, panels b and d). In our PdCu alloy foam, the spatial separation into *CO and *H forming and C–C coupling (alcohol forming) domains does not occur in the initial electroplating step but rather in the sequential activation steps of oxide formation and their subsequent electrochemical reduction (Fig. 1, 3 and 5). The thermally annealed Pd9Cu91 foam consists of copper oxides (CuO, Cu2O) and a mixed PdCu oxide phase (CuPdO3, see Fig. 3). Subsequent electro-reduction of these oxide phases forms the phase separated Cu-rich and Pd-rich metallic domains. Kenis et al. also discussed the effect of phase separation in a bimetallic PdCu catalyst where ethylene and ethanol were produced from CO2RR on phase-separated bimetallic PdCu nanoparticles.54
The domain of a Pd-rich PdCu alloy, formed after the electrochemical oxide reduction, can take over the role of the *CO and *H former (see Fig. 3 and 5h). Recent studies have already shown that both pure Pd and PdCu alloys are promising CO2RR catalysts with excellent selectivity towards formate particularly at low overpotentials33,34,37 (see also Fig. 7a) and towards CO at medium and high overpotentials.32 However, pure Pd catalysts suffer from strong CO chemisorption, which leads to an irreversible poisoning of the active sites in the course of the CO2RR.33,34 One possible approach to tackling this challenge is to co-alloy the Pd with a second transition metal that exhibits CO2RR activity in its own pure state but has a lower affinity towards CO adsorption/absorption in comparison to pure Pd.
A number of bimetallic systems have already been reported as CO2RR catalysts including PdAu,55 PdNi,56 and PdCu.57,58 Among these, copper is the most promising candidate for such a co-alloying approach because it shows a moderate binding strength towards CO, and allows for the C–C coupling reaction, towards oxygenate formation.9,10,59 In this case, the C–C coupling role is taken over by Cu-rich PdCu domains (Fig. 3, 5h, and Fig. S7, ESI†).

Fig. 9 summarizes the proposed mechanism of C3 alcohol formation on the od-Pd9Cu91 catalyst surface. *CO and *H form preferentially on the Pd-rich PdCu domains and they are subsequently transported to the Cu-rich domain via surface diffusion or, alternatively, via CO and H transport through the solution phase (coupled desorption and re-adsorption processes). Besides the increased abundance of *CO and *H intermediates, it is the stabilization of the chemisorbed *CO on the catalyst surface and the efficient *H-transfer for the hydrogenation of the C–C coupled intermediates further direct the CO2RR towards multicarbon alcohol formation.38 This stabilization is achieved by the presence of Pd-rich domains next to the Cu-rich domains, which help to bind *CO and *H intermediates stronger than pure Cu.10,60Operando Raman spectroscopy provides a proof of *CO adsorption on the catalyst surface as it shows clear bands at 283 cm−1 and 353 cm−1 which can be assigned to the chemisorbed *CO (Fig. 4a, inset). EtOH formation most likely proceeds via a combined C2 hydrocarbon–oxygenate pathway, as discussed by Nie et al. and Kortlever et al.61,62 In addition, another *CO further binds to the stabilized C2 intermediate to form the key-intermediate of PrOH, which is the adsorbed C3 aldehyde species (*CH3CHCHO).9 Additional control experiments in Ar-saturated CO2-free 0.5 M K2SO4 electrolyte using CH3CH2CHO as the reactant demonstrated that PrOH can be obtained from the respective C3 aldehyde (see Fig. S12, ESI†) under similar electrochemical conditions.
Conclusions
A novel PdCu alloy electrocatalyst was prepared by means of a hydrogen bubble-assisted foam deposition process. The Pd (minor component, 9 at%) was homogeneously dispersed in the Cu matrix (major component, 91 at%) of the as-prepared alloy foam sample.
The basic bimetallic catalyst concept, followed herein, is based on the combination of a *CO and *H forming catalyst component and a second component, active for C–C coupling and subsequent alcohol formation. Additional catalyst activation, involving the thermal annealing of the ap-Pd9Cu91 foam at 200 °C (12 h in air) and the subsequent reduction of the formed oxidic precursor under electrochemical conditions (at −0.65 V vs. RHE, 45 min), led to segregation into Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains which took over the role of *CO, *H-producer and C–C coupler (alcohol producer), respectively.
Highly selective n-propanol formation was observed (FEPrOH = 13.7%, jPrOH = −1.15 mA cm−2) over ethanol (FEEtOH = 7.1%, jEtOH = −0.60 mA cm−2) at −0.65 V vs. RHE, which led the selectivity of the C3 alcohol over the C2 alcohol by a factor of two. Key to the extraordinary performance of the oxide-derived od-Pd9Cu91 foam catalyst was the complete suppression of methane formation (C1 hydrocarbon pathway). Extended CO2 electrolyses, carried out for 102 h in a combined continuous and discontinuous mode, demonstrated rather stable PrOH selectivity and efficiencies that did not decrease during the continuously performed electrolysis but eventually were affected by the repetitive (intended) loss of potential control during the discontinuously performed catalyst stressing experiments. The continuous–discontinuous electrolyses indicated that the catalyst could be stored for long time and then used again when necessary.
Future work will focus on the transfer of these promising electrocatalysts to flow-cell electrolyzer with the aim of studying the catalyst degradation characteristics under well-defined mass transport conditions at elevated current densities relevant to industrial applications.

 	Fig. 1  Scheme illustrating individual preparation and activation steps of the Pd9Cu91 catalyst.	 
ERHE (V) = EAg/AgCl3M (V) + 0.210 V + (0.0591 V × pH)

 	Fig. 2  Identical location (IL) SEM analysis of the co-alloyed foam catalyst depending on the processing stage; (a)–(d) as-prepared (ap) alloy foam; (e)–(h) thermally annealed (ta) alloy foam (200° C, 12 h, in air); (i)–(l) oxide-derived (od) alloy foam (after ec pretreatment at −0.65 V vs. RHE for 45 min).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-prepared (ap) pure Cu, pure Pd, and the Pd9Cu91 foam samples. (b) X-ray diffraction pattern of the Pd9Cu91 sample depending on the processing stage (as-prepared (ap), thermally annealed (ta), and oxide-derived (od)). Standard diffraction peaks and their corresponding JCPDS files are shown.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Potential-dependent operando Raman spectra of the od-Pd9Cu91 foam sample in the CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte starting at the OCP, inset is showing zoomed PdCu–CO adsorption features; (b) operando Raman spectra corresponding to the catalyst activation procedure by stepping the potential from the OCP to −0.65 V vs. RHE using a ta-Pd9Cu91.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a)–(d) TEM, HR-TEM, HAADF and elemental STEM-EDX analysis of the ap-Pd9Cu91 sample; (e)–(h) TEM, HR-TEM, HAADF and STEM-EDX analysis of the od-Pd9Cu91 sample (after annealing (12 h at 200 °C in air) and ec pre-treatment (45 min at −0.65 V vs. RHE)).	 

 	Fig. 6  Time-dependent ICP-MS analysis of the CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution during the CO2RR at −0.65 V vs. RHE starting with the ta-Pd9Cu91 foam as the catalyst. The inset highlights the first 200 min of the electrolysis.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Product distribution of the electrolyses (3 h) carried out over the ap-Pd9Cu91 sample. (b) Product distribution of the electrolyses (3 h) carried out over the od-Pd9Cu91 sample. (c) Alcohol efficiencies derived from the electrolysis carried out over the od-Pd9Cu91 sample. (d) Partial current densities of multicarbon alcohols.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a) Current transient and time-dependent partial current densities of alcohols from the extended electrolysis carried out at −0.65 V vs. RHE over the od-Pd9Cu91 sample; (b) corresponding alcohol efficiencies; (c) corresponding CO, H2 and C2 hydrocarbon efficiencies. This set of long term experiments shows that we could store the catalyst for long time and reuse it when necessary.	 

 	Fig. 9  Proposed reaction scheme for n-propanol formation from CO2 over a phase-separated od-Pd9Cu91 catalyst.
