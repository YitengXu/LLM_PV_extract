    , Accepted 5th February 2013First published on 6th February 2013AbstractA transformative, sustainable technology to replace the age-old CO2-intensive production of iron is presented. Molten calcium inclusive carbonates are introduced for STEP Iron. Understanding the speciation constraints permits iron synthesis at nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, without exotic electrocatalysts, and at low electrolysis energy.
There is an urgent need for a material's synthesis to replace the millennia old CO2-extensive (carbothermal) iron making process. The production of iron and its alloys are one of the top contributors to greenhouse gases (other major contributors are electrical and vehicular power production and cement), and 9 kg of carbon dioxide are emitted for each 10 kg of iron produced. We presented a STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Process) theory of solar energy conversion, building on an alternative theory of solar water splitting, that solar thermal energy could drive endothermic electrochemical reactions (such as the reduction of carbon dioxide) at high solar energy conversion efficiency in molten electrolytes and without carbon dioxide emission.1 We experimentally demonstrated that STEP can extract graphite from carbon dioxide at solar efficiencies exceeding that of solar cells. STEP has now been applied to a range of useful products including cement, and towards water desalinization and water treatment.1–3
In this communication a new, effective molten path for the electrolytic CO2-free formation of iron is introduced. The electrochemical reduction of iron ore had been investigated in several electrolytes.4–9 Each of those electrochemical reductions had physical chemical limitations, such as high energy or corrosivity that, to date, had prevented implementation of an electrochemical replacement to the carbothermal production of iron. Electrolysis of the emitted CO2 subsequent to iron production has also been considered.1,10 Recently, we presented a molten Li2CO3 electrolytic process (STEP) to generate iron without emitting CO2 and requiring little energy, in mixed alkali and pure lithium molten carbonates.1,11 However, a complex, spatially dispersed, electrodeposition occurs near the cathode that includes partially reduced (Fe2+) species. This speciation is mapped for the first time in this study. An alternative, carbonate NaxKyCO3 can confine iron to the cathode, but is not “green” corroding anode and cathode and decomposing the carbonate emitting CO2.12 Here, this corrosion is eliminated in a new, less alkaline iron splitting electrolyte, in which iron ore is effectively electrolyzed to iron at high efficiency and low energy.
In the prior STEP Iron formation process, an oxide, such as lithium oxide, Li2O, dissolves the iron oxide, and is regenerated during the electrochemical reduction. Iron oxides were discovered to be unexpectedly, highly soluble in lithiated carbonates.1 The electrolysis of the iron oxide enriched electrolyte occurs without carbon dioxide release, and without net consumption of the carbonate, such as through the intermediate soluble salt MFeO2: dissolution: Fe2O3 + M2O → 2MFeO2(1) electrolysis: 2MFeO2 → 2Fe + M2O + 3/2O2(2) net: Fe2O3 → 2Fe + 3/2O2(3)
Broadening the base of understanding of speciation in the STEP Iron process will be critical to replace a pervasive high carbon footprint industrial process with an effective, low energy CO2-free alternative. In this communication, we provide (i) the first map of the speciation of the diffuse STEP Iron product, (ii) minimize the energy of the eqn (1)–(3) mechanism, and (iii) demonstrate an alternative synthetic route, which does not produce a spatially diffuse product based on dissolution. The alternative pathway maintains the low carbon footprint, but is based on insoluble iron oxides and produces an iron metal product confined to within the interfacial domain of the cathode, and without release of iron oxide to the bulk electrolyte.
The series of photos in Fig. 1 present a STEP Iron electrolysis product, as deposited from molten lithium carbonate onto a planar steel cathode. A reductive bias protects cathodes during STEP Iron electrolysis, and a wide variety of materials (iron, steel, carbon) are effective as cathodes.11 The left photo of Fig. 1 presents a cathode subsequent to electrolysis in molten Li2CO3 containing dissolved iron oxide, extraction and cooling. The middle photo shows a cut, cross-section view of the product as removed from the cathode. The product readily peels off the cooled cathode, and the right photo shows the reusable, bare cathode after removal of the product.

Right: a cut, cross-section view of the product still on the cathode. 
The ESI† details the iron analyses and electrolysis configuration used.13–16 To address the issue of the ratio of the different oxidation states of iron in the electrolysis product several techniques were considered. Techniques such as XPS provide these different oxidation states, but apply to only a small portion of the sample. From a material's perspective this high degree of spatial localization was considered here to leave the interpretation subject to too small a sample (the “trees” rather than “forest” perspective). However, such studies will be valuable in the future. Powder X-ray diffraction was also considered, and was performed on several samples. For example the electrolysis product near lying to the cathode exhibited iron metal 2-theta peaks (at 44.6°) and Li2CO3 (at 21.3, 29.4, 30.6, 31.8, 34.2 36.1, 36.9, 43.6, 44.7, and 48.8°). However the technique was considered more time consuming, expensive and less direct than classic quantitative analysis methodologies. This latter method directly probes the oxidation state of the iron species, and had the added advantage that it was conducted in-lab. Hence the classic quantitative analysis technique of precipitation analysis was chosen for this study to provide a complete description of the ferrous, ferric and metallic iron oxidation states as detailed in the ESI.†

Fig. 2 profiles the measured concentrations of the reduced iron species subsequent to electrolysis. The width reflects the relative total fraction of iron metal found in each layer. The vertical subdivisions of each bar reflect the relative iron oxide concentration that has been reduced to Fe2+ or to iron metal. Product closer to the cathode is on the left side, and product further from the cathode is on the right side of the scheme.
 Fig. 2  Cross sectional profile of the reduced iron species analyzed from the layers photographed in Fig. 1, and the electrolyte (right side). 
The Fig. 2 compositional analysis provides an understanding of each of the layers evident in the photograph of the cathode product. Consistent with the grey-metal color, the dominant iron species in the layer adjacent to the cathode is zero-valent iron. The additional black evident in the next layers is consistent with the color of partially reduced iron oxides, such as ferrous oxide or Fe3O4. The thin, top layer on the product was still molten while the cathode was extracted. The red/brown color of this layer is similar to that of the remaining bulk electrolyte, but still contains a significant (zero valent) iron metal content. Finally furthest from the cathode, the post electrolysis bulk electrolyte also contains zero valent iron (although at a much lower level, less than 1% of that found at the cathode surface), as well as partially reduced (ferrous) iron, and also ferric ion remaining from the initial iron oxide dissolution.
The product speciation profile in Fig. 2 presents the substantial, but incomplete reduction of iron. One objective of this study is the systematic optimization of the STEP Iron to approach 100% coulombic efficiency of the conversion of ferric ion, Fe3+, to iron metal, Fe°, and a second objective to accomplish that high coulombic efficiency at low energy (low applied electrolysis potential and high current density). The electrolysis of Fig. 1, is conducted with parallel, horizontal anode and cathode. The nickel oxygen evolving anode is situated near the surface of electrolyte, 1 cm above the cathode. The 10 cm2 nickel electrode is oversized compared to the 6.2 cm2 cathode.
The electrolyte composition and temperature, and the electrode configuration, duration and current density have a substantial impact on STEP Iron coulombic efficiency. For example, the electrolysis of Fig. 1 is conducted at 730 °C, near the electrolyte melting point, and a rise in temperature to 850 °C decreases the requisite electrolysis potential but generates a lower fraction of iron metal. The ESI† begins with an electrolysis temperature of 800 °C, and systematically conducts modification of the physical chemical components of the system to understand conditions which increase coulombic efficiency and minimize the requisite electrolysis potential.
Following extensive modification and systematic optimization as delineated in the ESI,† optimized, high efficiency, low energy electrolyses are measured with an outer foil or wire cylinder pure nickel anode and a small or large diameter inner steel foil cathode. The coulombic efficiency compares the applied electrolysis current to the theoretical required for the three electron reduction of Fe3+ to iron metal. Efficiency is highest at minimum molten lithium carbonate temperature, intermediate dissolved ferric concentration (3 molal), intermediate cathode and anode current density, anode electron transfer facilitated by situating the anode near the electrolyte//air interface, and or a vertical cathode parallel to a vertical anode. Extended duration electrolyses can be sustained if levels of ferric are not depleted, such as would be achieved via continuous addition of ferric oxide during the electrolysis. The electrolysis configuration is simplified when the electrolysis is conducted in a nickel crucible, which comprises both the anode and the cell body in one piece.
The overpotential is constrained by the anode current density; energy minimization is achieved with a maximum anode surface area. Interelectrode separations must be small enough (<1 cm) to minimize potential loss at high (>0.1 A cm−2) current density. Consistent with the expected Nernst decrease of redox potential with increasing ferric concentration, higher LiFeO2 (and Li2O) concentration decreases the electrolysis potential.
As delineated in the ESI,† optimized electrolyses occur in a low electrolysis potential of 1.35 V and at coulombic efficiency approaching 100%. The energy required to generate a mole of iron is 1.35 V × (3 Faraday/mole Fe) × (26.8 Ah per Faraday) = 109 Wh per mole of iron. This is only approximately 1/3 of the energy required to produce a mole of iron using coke carbon by the conventional carbothermal method (this assumes solar thermal energy is used to maintain the 730 °C STEP Iron electrolysis temperature).
Lithium containing carbonate electrolytes promote soluble iron oxide, as mediated by lithium oxide, eqn (1). The high solubility leads to low energy iron metal electrodeposition, but the iron product can be spatially diffuse. The carbon footprint of molten carbonate electrolytes with less soluble or insoluble is explored here as green, low cost alternatives to a pure lithium carbonate electrolyte. Iron oxide solubility in a molten carbonate electrolyte decreases when there is less lithium present; the solubility of Fe3+ in a Li0.87Na0.63K0.5CO3 eutectic is less than half of its value in Li2CO3.1 Electrolysis of Fe3+ dissolved in this eutectic diminishes the secondary Fe2+ layer in the product, compared to that in Li2CO3, as seen in Fig. 7 of the ESI.†
We previously observed that a lithium-free carbonate Na1.23K0.77CO3 eutectic is corrosive towards the nickel anode, the steel cathode, and the electrolyte, impeding CO2 electrolysis, and in preliminary results (on CO2 splitting) observed that CaCO3 addition is highly stabilizing, sustaining an effective electrolysis of CO2 to carbon and oxygen.2 We attributed the Na1.23K0.77CO3 corrosivity to the observed high solubility and alkalinity of Na2O, and the effective electrolysis in Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3 to the low solubility and alkalinity of CaO.
Here we observe that Fe3+ is insoluble (solubility ≪ 0.1 m Fe2O3) in both Na1.23K0.77CO3 and Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3. We investigate electrolysis of solid Fe2O3 pressed onto the cathode as shown on the bottom of Fig. 3. Electrolytic reduction of 2 g of solid Fe2O3 (pressed at 6000 psi on each side of a coiled 26.5 cm, 1.2 mm diameter, 10 cm2 iron wire, Fig. 3 bottom), then dry annealed at 750 °C for 2 hours, was compared in three molten carbonate electrolytes: pure lithium, a sodium potassium eutectic and a calcium, sodium, potassium eutectic. The previous STEP Iron process using Fe2O3 dissolved as LiFeO2 in Li2CO3 is a CO2-free process.11,12 However, the electrolytic reduction of Fe2O3 in Na1.23K0.77CO3 is not “green”. Unlike the Li2O containing Li2CO3 electrolyte, this electrolyte reacts with iron oxide and releases CO2 in accord with: Fe2O3 + M2CO3 → 2MFeO2 + CO2(4)
 Fig. 3  Electrolytic production of iron using solid, rather than dissolved, iron oxide. 

Eqn (4) is observable both as a mass loss from the electrolyte, rapid bubble evolution from the cathode, and darkening of the electrolyte during the electrolysis.
Electrolysis in the Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3 electrolyte decreases the rate of CO2 emission from the cathode, and results in a high quality iron metal deposit. The observed, qualitative rate of bubble evolution from the immersed cathode during 750 °C electrolysis decreased in the order Li2CO3 (vigorous in the absence of dissolved Li2O) > Na1.23K0.77CO3 (vigorous) > Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3 (little, if any bubble evolution). Similarly as shown on the top of Fig. 3, post electrolysis, the molten calcium-containing electrolyte had not changed color, whereas the Li2CO3 electrolyte has turned red due to ferric dissolution (as LiFeO2), and the Na1.23K0.77CO3 electrolyte has become black. The electrolyte, which solidifies on extraction of the Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3 electrolysis product, is readily removed by a water wash. The washed metal product seen in Fig. 3, is formed at high coulombic efficiency (98% compared to only 49 or 50% coulombic conversion from Fe2O3 in either the Li2CO3, or Na1.23K0.77CO3 during the 2 hour 0.5 amp electrolysis). The nickel oxygen anode, photographed on the top right of Fig. 3 is unaffected by this electrolysis in Ca0.27Na0.7K0.75CO3.
Finally, although Ca2+ added to the NayKzCO3 electrolyte as calcium carbonate, CaCO3, suppresses corrosion and CO2 emission from the cathode, it does not prevent CO2 emission from another source; that is the decomposition of the carbonate electrolyte, which occurs in accord with the equilibrium: M2CO3 ⇌ M2O + CO2(5)
This final electrolyte decomposition challenge is overcome by the addition of 0.5 m CaO (lime) rather than CaCO3 (limestone) to the molten carbonate electrolyte, and we observe that both the iron oxide insoluble CaO/NayKzCO3 and CaO/Li2CO3 electrolytes, as well as the previous iron oxide soluble Li2O/Li2CO3 electrolyte, provide a high quality iron metal electrolysis product from solid, pressed iron oxide. Added oxide eliminates the carbonate decomposition emission of CO2 by driving equilibrium 5 to the left. Specifically, we had previously observed that at 750 °C Li2CO3 with 3 m Li2O, absorbs atmospheric CO2 and gains mass when exposed to air, while without added Li2O, Li2CO3 or CaCO3/Li2CO3 both emit CO2 and lose mass (these effects are quantified and elaborated upon in ref. 2 ESI†).
In summary, the chemistry of a transformative process to decrease greenhouse gas emissions is developed here. High quality, low energy iron metal products are produced by the green electrolysis of iron oxide in molten carbonates and provide an important opportunity to replace the CO2 intensive-carbothermal production of iron. A calcium-containing electrolyte, CaO/NayKzCO3, is more effective for iron production than NayKzCO3 from several perspectives, maximizing iron conversion efficiency, minimizing nickel anode corrosion, minimizing dissolution into the electrolyte, and spatially constraining the iron product to the cathode surface. The energy required to produce STEP Iron is only approximately 1/3 of the energy required to produce a mole of iron using coke carbon by the conventional carbothermal method (this assumes solar thermal energy is used to maintain the 730 °C STEP Iron electrolysis temperature). Future studies will probe replacing calcium with barium, which presumably will have similar, less alkaline, advantageous effects on the iron product, and electrolyte and anode stability.
