    , Accepted 29th June 2022First published on 4th July 2022AbstractTwo-dimensional group III chalcogenides have gained global interest on account of their excellent prospects for applications in multifunctional energy conversion. Herein, via density functional theory calculations, we systematically unravel the electronic structures of In2XY2 (X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y) monolayers for their applications in energy conversion areas. Interestingly, the characteristics of the efficient spatial separation of photo-generated charge carriers, suitable band edge positions, and outstanding light-harvesting abilities indicate that In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers are desirable photocatalysts for the overall water splitting. It is found that In2SSe2 and In2STe2 act as donor materials, while In2SeS2 and In2SeTe2 act as acceptor materials in solar cells made of In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures. It is highlighted that the theoretical power conversion efficiency reached 15.5% and 22.5% for In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures, respectively. In particular, the ZT value of the In2STe2 monolayer reaches 3.2 at 500 K, indicating its potential as an up-and-coming candidate for next generation thermoelectric materials. The present research will pave the way for the practical applications of In2XY2 monolayers in the field of multifunctional energy conversion.
Introduction
The development of photocatalytic, photovoltaic, and thermoelectric materials has been given much attention due to the energy crisis and environmental degradation in the past few decades.1–3 Inspired by the successful synthesis of graphene,4 many two-dimensional (2D) materials have been reported experimentally or theoretically, providing unimagined possibilities for the development of clean energy conversion materials. For example, g-C3N4,5 black phosphorene (BP),6,7 MXenes,8,9 transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDs),10 and group III chalcogenides (MX and M2X3)11–14 are all able to achieve high performance in the fields of photocatalysis and photovoltaic cells. Moreover, these 2D materials also show better performance in the field of thermoelectric devices due to their outstanding thermal transport properties which can be traced back to the quantum confinement effect.15 However, the discoveries and investigations of these novel 2D materials applied to the multiple energy fields are still ongoing and of great importance to realize the environmentally friendly, sustainable, and efficient energy conversion.
Fortunately, as one of the typical members of the group III chalcogenide family, the α-In2Se3 monolayer has been successfully fabricated using the physical vapor deposition (PVD)16 and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)17 method. The out-of-plane and in-plane ferroelectric18 and piezoelectric19 properties induced by the asymmetric structure of α-In2Se3 suggest its promising applications in data storage devices, optical devices, and electronic devices. In addition, α-In2Se3 has been theoretically revealed to be a promising photocatalyst14 and thermoelectric20 material. However, its indirect bandgap characteristic feature significantly hinders its further applications.13 Currently, 18 artificial asymmetric indium-based tri-chalcogenide monolayers are theoretically constructed.21 Interestingly, half of them exhibit the direct bandgap semiconductor characteristics, which are beneficial to the transport of photo-generated charge carriers.21 Herein, similar to Janus 2D materials,22,23 indium based tri-chalcogenide monolayers with the stacking configuration of Y-In-X-In-Y (short for In2XY2, X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y) represent tunable electronic properties related to the chemical composition, which show the presence of the same chalcogen Y on the top and bottom surfaces, and another different chalcogen X in the internal layer. It is worth noting that the suitable and direct bandgap characteristics of In2XY2 monolayers indicate their great potential applications in multifunctional sustainable energy conversion fields. Therefore, the evaluation of In2XY2 monolayers for energy conversion applications is anticipated and of great interest.
In the present studies, systematic investigations have been carried out on the dynamic electronic properties and structures of In2XY2 (X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y) monolayers using the density functional theory calculations. The phonon spectrum calculations and AIMD simulations confirm the dynamic and thermal stabilities of In2XY2 monolayers, respectively. The present calculations show that In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 are very promising photocatalysts for the overall water splitting. The spatial separation of photo-induced charge carriers and outstanding light-harvesting ability further ensure a high efficiency in the overall water splitting. Additionally, the In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures have been utilized as the solar cells and their corresponding theoretical power conversion efficiencies are predicted to reach 15.5% and 22.5%, respectively. Moreover, the In2STe2 monolayer exhibits outstanding phonon transport properties, which lead to high thermoelectric performance.
Computational details
The present density functional theory (DFT) calculations were implemented using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)24 in conjunction with the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method25 and dealt with the ALKEMIE platform.26 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)27,28 version of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)29 was used to treat the interaction between electrons. A cut-off energy of 600 eV and the Γ-centered 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack30k-point mesh were used for structural optimizations and self-consistent calculations. The convergence criteria for the energy and force are 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. A vacuum thickness of 35 Å along the z-axis was added. To obtain accurate electronic structures, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)31 hybrid function was used. Moreover, the phonon curves and the harmonic interatomic force constants were calculated by the phonopy32 code with 6 × 6 × 1 supercells. The thermal stability of In2XY2 monolayers was confirmed by the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD).33,34 The thermoelectric properties of In2STe2 were calculated in combination with the BoltzTrap code.35 A denser k-point mesh of 33 × 33 × 1 in the Brillouin zone was adopted to ensure the convergence and accuracy of eigenvalues. The 4 × 4 × 1 supercells were applied to obtain the third-order interatomic force constants (anharmonic) in combination with the harmonic interatomic force constants as input files to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity, as realized in the ShengBTE code.36 The photocurrent of an InXY2 monolayer was computed by means of the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)37 in combination with DFT, as realized in the Quantum Wise Atomistix ToolKit (QuantumATK).38 The photocurrent was defined in the following equation:39 (1)where ΓL stands for the line-width function, f(E) is the Fermi distribution function and G>(ph)/G<(ph) is the lesser/greater Green's function including the electron–photon interaction.
Results and discussion
The top and side views of the crystal structures of the In2XY2 (X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y) monolayers are plotted in Fig. 1(a and b), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the top and bottom surfaces of the monolayers are both occupied by Y atoms. The Y-upper represents the upper surface chalcogen group atoms, while the Y-lower is the lower surface chalcogen group atoms. The crystal structure of 2D In2XY2 belongs to the space group of Pm1 with C13v symmetry. The optimized lattice constants (a) of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, In2SeTe2, In2TeS2 and In2TeSe2 monolayers are 4.06 Å, 4.30 Å, 3.97 Å, 4.34 Å, 4.05 Å and 4.18 Å, respectively (as listed in Table 1), which is in good agreement with the previously reports.21 On the other hand, as seen in Table 1, the optimized layer thicknesses (h) of the In2XY2 monolayers are in the range of 6.60–7.14 Å. Here, the thickness of 2D In2XY2 can be defined as the distance between the Y-upper and Y-lower atoms. It could be found that these lattice constants (layer thicknesses) are larger than that of In2S3 and smaller than that of In2Te3, which corresponds to the atomic radii order of S, Se, and Te: S < Se < Te, suggesting that our calculations are reasonable.

To check the dynamic stabilities of the In2XY2 monolayers, firstly, the calculations on the phonon dispersion curves for the lattice dynamic stability evaluations were carried out. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2. Except for the fact that the In2TeS2 and In2TeSe2 monolayers possess a very small imaginary frequency (−0.02 THz and −0.09 THz, respectively), no imaginary frequency is observed in other monolayers, which confirmed the lattice dynamic stabilities of the In2XY2 systems. Moreover, the thermal stabilities of In2XY2 monolayers were evaluated by performing AIMD simulations. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), after annealing for 10 ps at 300 K, the total energy of the individual In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers is found to fluctuate in a narrow window and the corresponding structure is found to have no significant distortion. However, for the In2TeS2 and In2TeSe2 monolayer, as shown in Fig. S1(e and f) (ESI†), the total energy gradually decreases and the structure is severely changed and damaged. This phenomenon is mainly due to the existing imaginary frequency in the phonon dispersion curves, leading to the relative structural instability of In2TeS2 and In2TeSe2 monolayers. These results clearly indicate that the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers possess high dynamic and thermal stabilities.

To unravel the electronic structures of the In2XY2 monolayers, their band structures were investigated and the atomic contributions are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the In2SeS2 monolayer is situated at the Γ point, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is located in the middle between Γ and M points. Interestingly, except for the In2SeS2 monolayer, all the other materials are found to be direct bandgap semiconductors. Compared with the indirect bandgap features of the α-In2X3 monolayers, the direct bandgap natures of the In2XY2 monolayers are more beneficial to the optical transition to induce the photo-generated charge carriers, which create favorable conditions in the photocatalysis and photovoltaic devices.40 The calculated band gaps of the In2XY2 monolayers are found to be within the range of 0.05 and 1.60 eV (as listed in Table 1). Moreover, from the investigated projected band structures of the In2XY2 monolayers, the contributions of the VBM are found to be mainly classified into the following two types: In type-I, the VBM is primarily occupied by the upper surface Y atoms (In2SSe2, In2STe2, and In2SeTe2), while in type-II, the VBM is mainly contributed by the inner X atoms (In2SeS2, In2TeS2, and In2TeSe2). As for the CBM, in all the cases, the CBM is mainly contributed by the lower surface Y atoms and inner In atoms. The spatial separation of the VBM and CBM makes a significant influence on the efficiency of the charge separation of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs, the larger separation of the VBM and CBM leads to prolonging the recombination time of photo-generated electrons and holes, being beneficial to the photocatalytic overall splitting of water.41,42

As the energetic requirement for the photocatalytic overall splitting of water on the various semiconducting catalysts, the band edge positions (the CBM and VBM) step over the redox potentials of water (H+/H2: −4.44 eV and O2/H2O: −5.67 eV). Due to the thermal instability of In2TeS2 and In2TeSe2 monolayers, the photocatalytic properties of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers have been mainly focused in the present study. The calculated electrostatic potentials of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers are shown in Fig. 4, and the electrostatic potential difference ΔΦ is shown in Table 1, which can be calculated by the difference in electrostatic potentials between two surfaces. A significant potential difference is clearly observed between two surface sides of the monolayers, indicating the formation of built-in electric fields. Moreover, the observed band-decomposed charge densities shown in Fig. 4 also suggest the formation of built-in electric fields in the semiconducting materials. In other words, the CBM and VBM are occupied by different atom layers, which shows a good agreement with the investigated band structures of these semiconducting materials. Interestingly, due to the formation of the built-in electric fields the photo-generated electrons and holes move in the opposite directions, resulting in an efficient charge separation.13,14Fig. 4 also illustrates the band edge alignments of the materials relative to the vacuum level, which includes the influence of the built-in electric field for the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers. It is clear that the CBM of all these materials is located at more positive positions than that of H+/H2, while the VBM is situated at a more negative position than that of O2/H2O, indicating their energetically favorable conditions to apply to the photocatalytic overall splitting of water to produce H2 and O2.

Since the light absorption capacity of photocatalysts is an essential factor to affect the photocatalytic efficiency, the optical absorption coefficients of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers were investigated and their results are shown in Fig. 5 to evaluate the light-harvesting abilities. As shown in Fig. 5, the optical absorption peaks of the In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers are found in the visible light regions at around 410–440 nm, while that of the In2SSe2 monolayer is found in the UV-light area at around 330 nm. These features indicate that the In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers utilize sunlight more efficiently than the In2SSe2 monolayer. However, it was found that despite this drawback of the In2SSe2 monolayer, its high absorption coefficient (∼105 cm−1) in the visible light region guarantees its high visible light-harvesting ability. These results further demonstrate the high potential of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers for application to photovoltaic devices.

As shown in Table 1, the calculated bandgap energies of the In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeS2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers are 1.6, 1.48, 1.50 and 1.45 eV, respectively. These bandgap energies are located within the range between 1.2 and 1.6 eV, overcoming the primary requirement to be a high-quality heterostructure solar cell.43,44 Therefore, the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures were constructed with a lattice mismatch of 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively. The lattice mismatch can be defined as: |(aIn2SeY2 − aIn2SY2)/aIn2SeY2| × 100%, where aIn2SeY2 and aIn2SY2 represent the lattice constant of In2SeY2 and In2SY2, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), six different stacking configurations were considered to understand the stacking pattern's effect on the stability of the heterostructures. These six stacking configurations are divided into two categories: In category-I, the upper surface Y atom in one layer is combined with another one's upper surface Y atoms at the interface (stacking-I, stacking-II, and stacking-III), while, in category-II, the upper surface Y atoms combine with lower surface Y atoms (stacking-IV, stacking-V, and stacking-VI). In order to investigate the stacking effect on the electronic structures, the band structures of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures with different stacking configurations were calculated. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), all the bandgaps of the stacking configurations classified in category-I are found to be larger than that of those classified in category-II. These features contribute to the electrostatic potential difference and the energetic separation of the VBM and CBM between two sides of monolayer systems. By considering their practical applications as solar cells, the stacking configurations in category-I (stacking-I, stacking-II, and stacking-III) with larger bandgaps were investigated.
In order to understand the stability of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures, the formation energies (Ef) were calculated using the following eqn (2): Ef = EIn2SY2/In2SeY2 − EIn2SY2 − EIn2SeY2(2)where EIn2SY2/In2SeY2 represents the total energy of the heterostructure, and EIn2SY2 and EIn2SeY2 are the total energies of the corresponding monolayers. Based on the calculated formation energy (Ef), the most stable stacking configurations of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures are in stacking-II, and their corresponding top and side views are also shown in Fig. 6(a and b), respectively. The corresponding calculated formation energies for In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 were −0.99 eV and −1.1 eV, respectively. These negative values of the formation energy indicate that the formation of these heterostructures is an exothermic and energetically favorable reaction. Moreover, in order to understand the binding strength between two monolayers, the binding energies (Eb) were calculated using the following eqn (3): (3)where  and  are the energy of the corresponding monolayer fixed in the heterostructure lattices, and A stands for the cross-sectional area. The calculated binding energies of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures were −15.03 and −13.8 meV Å−2, respectively. These values are found to be located in the range of the typical van der Waals heterostructures.45,46 Furthermore, the Eb of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures as functions of the interlayer distances are shown in Fig. 6(c). The equilibrium interlayer distance d is found to be 3.02 and 3.36 Å for In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2, respectively. These results reveal that the Eb values reach the lowest value at their equilibrium states, representing the typical Lennard-Jones potential type relationship.47

The band structures of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures projected to the layer contributions are shown in Fig. 7(a and b), respectively. Interestingly, both of them are indicated to be the direct bandgap semiconductors. The calculated HSE06 bandgap energies of the In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures were found to be 0.96 eV and 1.18 eV, respectively. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, the VBM of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 (In2STe2/In2SeTe2) heterostructure is completely occupied by the In2SSe2 (In2SeTe2) layer, while the CBM is contributed by both In2SeS2 and In2SSe2 (In2STe2 and In2SeTe2) layers. From these results, it might be concluded that the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures belong to the type-V heterostructure, which leads to effective separation of the photo-generated charge carriers into free electrons and holes, improving the photon energy utilization efficiency.48,49 These characteristic features of the type-V heterostructures can be further visualized through the decomposed charge densities of the VBM and CBM at Γ points plotted in the insets of Fig. 7(a and b). The charge density of the VBM of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 (In2STe2/In2SeTe2) heterostructure is mainly localized at In2SSe2 (In2SeTe2) layer, while the CBM is predominantly ascribed to both In2SSe2 and In2SeS2 (In2STe2 and In2SeTe2) layers.

As with the photocatalysts, the light absorption ability is also a critical parameter for solar cells. The optical absorption spectra of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures and their corresponding monolayers are shown in Fig. 8(a). Interestingly, the optical absorption spectra of both In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures exhibit much higher absorption than their corresponding monolayers in the entire spectral ranges. Moreover, the optical absorption spectrum of the In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructure exhibits much higher absorption than the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 heterostructure. The highest optical absorption coefficient of the In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructure in the visible wavelength regions between 400 and 600 nm reaches 1.37 × 106 cm−1. Furthermore, in order to better understand their photovoltaic performance, the photocurrents of these heterostructures were evaluated under AM 1.5 spectral illumination of 1000 W m−2 conditions. For the validation of the reliability of the photocurrents, the local density of states of the solar cell devices are calculated and shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). These results indicate that the device models used in the present simulations are long enough. The simulated photocurrents for the heterostructures and the corresponding monolayers are shown in Fig. 8(b). As with the optical absorption coefficients, the photocurrents of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures are found to be much higher than those of the corresponding monolayers in the entire solar spectral range. It is noted that the photocurrent of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 heterostructure reaches 7.0 A m−2 at 2.75 eV, while the value of the In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructure is 4.47 A m−2 at 2.32 eV, being about twice higher than that of the g-C3N4/InSe heterostructure (2.9 μA mm−2).50 These high photocurrents of the In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures exhibit their excellent light-harvesting abilities, further guaranteeing their favorable application as solar cell devices.

In order to assess the solar cell performances of In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures, the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) η of these heterostructure solar cells were estimated by using the following eqn (4):51,52 (4)where βFF is the fill factor equal to 0.65, VOC represents the open-circuit voltage, JSC stands for the short circuit current and Psolar is the total incident solar energy. Eg is the bandgap of In2SSe2 or In2STe2, ΔEc stands for the conduction band difference between the donor and acceptor, and P(ħω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux under the value of photon energy (ħω). Firstly, the conduction band offset, ΔEc, was calculated to be 0.39 and 0.05 eV for the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures, respectively. The relatively small ΔEc of these heterostructures implies the high PCE of these heterostructure solar cells. The schematic band edge alignments of the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures are shown in Fig. 9(a), in which the band edge alignments were obtained from the band structures of the corresponding monolayers fixed in the lattice of the heterostructures.53 It will be observed that the electrons migrate from the In2SSe2 layer to the In2SeS2 layer in the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 heterostructure. On the other hand, in the In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructure, electron migration will occur from the In2STe2 layer to the In2SeTe2 layer. Thus, the In2SSe2 and In2STe2 layers serve as the electron donors in the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructure solar cells. The contour map of the PCE as a function of Eg and ΔEc is shown in Fig. 9(b). The PCEs for the In2SSe2/In2SeS2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 heterostructures were calculated to be 15.5% and 22.5%, respectively. It is noted that the PCE of In2STe2/In2SeTe2 is comparable with those of the fascinating heterostructure solar cell candidates like Ti2CO2/Zr2CO2 (22.74%),9 Pb2SSe/SnSe (20.2%),54 and Sc2COHH/InS (21.4%),55 being higher than those of GaTe/InS (11%),12 MoSeTe/WSTe (18.32%)56 and ZrS3/HfS3 (16–18%).57

Thermoelectric materials are another momentous clean energy conversion material that can directly or reversibly convert thermal energy and electrical energy. Inspired by the outstanding thermoelectric performance of the In2Se3 monolayer20 and the relatively soft acoustic phonon modes of the In2STe2 monolayer, the In2STe2 monolayer has been applied as an example to study the thermoelectric properties of In2XY2 monolayers. The thermoelectric conversion efficiency for thermoelectric materials can be directly assessed by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT, which is calculated using the following eqn (5):58 (5)where the numerators T, S and σ are the temperature, Seebeck coefficient, and electrical conductivity, respectively. The denominator κ is thermal conductivity, which is contributed by the electronic and lattice parts according to κ = κe + κl. The thermoelectric power factor (PF) is defined as PF = S2σ. Apparently, a higher PF and lower κ can contribute to a large ZT value. Owing to the relaxation time approximation in the Boltzmann transport theory, the obtained electric conductivity is related to the relaxation time. Thus, the relaxation time of the In2STe2 monolayer is defined using the following eqn (6): (6)where the charge carrier mobility μ is estimated using the following eqn (7):59,60 (7)where e and ħ are the electron charge and the reduced Planck constant, respectively, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, m* is the effective mass of the electron or hole, C2D is the elastic modulus, and Ei is the deformation potential constant and defined as Ei = dEedge/dδ, where Eedge represents the band edge position related to the vacuum level. As shown in Fig. S6(a) (ESI†), the orthorhombic lattice of the In2STe2 monolayer is built for the calculation of the charge carrier mobility. The band structure, total energy vs. strain, and Eedgevs. strain of the In2STe2 monolayer in the orthorhombic unit cell are shown in Fig. S6(b–d) (ESI†), respectively. The calculated charge carrier mobility and electronic relaxation time as well as their corresponding parameters mentioned above are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). A large difference in the electron and hole carrier mobilities (μ) is seen in Table S1 (ESI†), suggesting huge differences in the electronic transport performance of the n-type and p-type doping of the In2STe2 monolayer.
Based on the relaxation time approximation, the electronic transport properties of the In2STe2 monolayer are shown in Fig. 10 in the temperature range of 300 to 500 K and at the chemical potential between −1.0 and 1.0 eV. As shown in the contour map of the Seebeck coefficient (S), it decreases with an increase in temperature. Moreover, the highest Seebeck coefficients are found to br 2509 and 2453 μVK−1 for the p-type and n-type doping at 300 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(b), unlike the Seebeck coefficients, the electrical conductivity (σ) is less sensitive to temperature. Furthermore, the power factors (PF) of the In2STe2 monolayer were calculated and are plotted in Fig. 10(c), in which the power factors of the n-type doping are found to be much higher than that of the p-type, and the maximum n-type doping power factor value is found to reach 0.012 Wm−1 K−2 at 300 K, being about 19 times higher than that of the p-type doping of 0.00063 Wm−1 K−2. When the temperature increases to 500 K, the power factor of the n-type doping further increases to reach 0.22 Wm−1 K−2, being comparable to the value reported for novel 2D thermoelectric materials such as GeAs2,61 Bi2O2S,62 and In2Se320 monolayers.

The thermal conductivity contributed by the electronic (κe) and the lattice (κl) parts for the In2STe2 monolayer are shown in Fig. 11(a and b), respectively. κe is obtained through the well-known Wiedemann–Franz law defined as: κe = LσT, where L represents the Lorenz constant, being equal to 2.45 × 108 W·Ω K−2. Thus, the κe exhibits a linear relationship with σ. From Fig. 11(b), the κl is found to decrease significantly with an increase in temperature. The calculated κl is 0.92 W m−1 K−1 for the In2STe2 monolayer at 300 K, being lower than 1.32 W m−1 K−1 for the In2Se3 monolayer.20 Moreover, as shown in the inset figure of Fig. 11(b), the lattice thermal conductivity has a good linear relationship with the reciprocal of temperature (κl ∝ 1/T) since the thermal resistivity is mainly contributed by the phonon–phonon scattering process.63 To unravel the low thermal resistivity behavior in the In2STe2 monolayer, the phonon group velocities (νλ) and phonon relaxation times (τλ) were calculated since κl is obtained using the following eqn (8):64 (8)where V, Cλ, νλ and τλ stand for the volume, capacity heat, phonon group velocity, and phonon relaxation time, respectively. At room temperature, the heat capacity follows the Dulong–Petit limit, therefore, κl is mainly contributed by νλ and τλ. The calculated phonon group velocities and phonon relaxation times are shown in Fig. 11(c and d), respectively. Apparently, the LA mode contributes to the highest phonon group velocity, which is about 2.59 Km s−1. Moreover, the average value of phonon group velocities is 0.61 Km s−1, being comparable to 0.63 Km s−1 of the SnTe, whose κl is only 0.67 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K.65 However, the TA mode is contributed by the highest phonon relaxation time, and the average phonon relaxation time of the acoustic branches is 4.8 ps, being comparable to 4.05 ps of the KAgS and 3.88 ps of the KAgSe monolayer.66 These small values of the phonon group velocities and phonon relaxation times suggest a low value of κl in the In2STe2 monolayer. The Grüneisen parameters (γ) for the In2STe2 monolayer are also shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The average value of the Grüneisen parameter is found to be 1.57, being comparable to 2.05 for the PbSe monolayer67 and much higher than 0.71 for the GeSe and 0.96 for the SnSe monolayers.67 Such a large Grüneisen parameter clearly suggests the presence of the strong phonon anharmonic interaction in the In2STe2 monolayer.66

It is anticipated that the high PF values and low κl of the In2STe2 monolayer lead to high ZT values. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 12, based on the electronic and thermal transport parameters, the ZT values for the In2STe2 monolayer were evaluated. The ZT is found to exhibit a similar tendency to PF, its n-type doping values being much higher than p-type doping. Surprisingly, the maximum ZT value for the In2STe2 monolayer reaches 3.2 at 500 K with n-type doping. Such a large ZT value is comparable to 3.02 for the In2Se3 monolayer at 400 K,20 3.23 for the InP3 monolayer at 500 K,68 2.56 for the WSTe monolayer at 1200 K,69 and 3.45 for the Bi2TeSe2 monolayer at 900 K.70

Conclusions
In summary, based on density functional theory calculations, systematic studies of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of In2XY2 (X, Y = S, Se, and Te; X ≠ Y) monolayers as well as their corresponding applications in the field of photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and thermoelectrics have been carried out. The stabilities of the In2XY2 monolayers were confirmed from the lattice dynamics and thermodynamics point of view. Except for the In2SeS2 monolayer, all In2XY2 monolayers exhibited direct semiconducting features with the bandgap energies in the ranges between 0.05 and 1.60 eV. The In2SSe2, In2STe2, In2SeTe2, and In2SeTe2 monolayers were demonstrated to be very promising candidates for the photocatalytic overall water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen because of their thermodynamically suitable band edges, efficient separation of the photo-generated charge carriers, and excellent optical absorption abilities. Due to the appropriate bandgaps and lattice mismatches, the In2SeS2/In2SSe2 and In2STe2/In2SeTe2 vdW heterostructures exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 15.5% and 22.5%, respectively. In particular, the excellent optical absorption coefficients and high photocurrents of these two heterostructures suggest their potential applications in solar cell devices. Furthermore, the In2STe2 monolayer exhibited outstanding thermoelectric properties owing to its low lattice thermal conductivity and high power factor, where the ZT value reached 3.22 at 500 K with n-type doping. These present findings have clearly indicated that the In2XY2 monolayers are promising materials for clean energy production and also pave the way for the development of new types of α-In2X3-based monolayers.
