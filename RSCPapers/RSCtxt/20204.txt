    , Accepted 2nd October 2018First published on 3rd October 2018AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is an attractive method to convert solar energy into chemical fuel. However, developing highly efficient photoanodes for PEC cells to meet industrial requirements remains a challenge. Herein, we effectively alter the onset potential of a photoanode though the doping of V into Co oxide film via the low-cost method of magnetron co-sputtering deposition on a p+n junction Si cell (p+nSi/CoVO). The highest photocurrent density of p+nSi/CoVO is 29.15 mA cm−2 (at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Moreover, a successful decrease in the onset potential by 40 mV to 1.00 V (at 1 mA cm−2) and a 3.6-fold increase in the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are achieved compared to p+nSi/CoO. The p+n junction Si cell provides not only photoexcited vacancies but also a photoproduced voltage of 608 mV. We find that the doped V atoms are multifunctional: they can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the Co3O4 film, serve as a Lewis acid to increase the local pH value, and facilitate the generation of oxo-bridged CoIVO species to accelerate the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); therefore, they can obviously decrease the onset potential of p+nSi/CoVO in the OER. This work highlights a general approach to further improve the performance of OER catalysts via engineering active sites and the local chemical environment through element doping.
Introduction
As there is increasing world energy demand and fossil fuel depletion, sustainable solutions are urgently required to mitigate this contradiction.1 Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar energy is a widely accepted strategy to solve the energy and environmental crises. Because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a four electron–proton coupled reaction, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is only a two electron-transfer reaction, the bottleneck of this strategy to date in relation to its practical application is the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Therefore, developing highly efficient and stable photoanodes is crucial for water splitting. Moreover, the cost of solar H2 generation (energy transformation) is yet to be reduced.
Silicon (Si) is a promising photoelectrochemical (PEC) photoanode because of its continuously decreasing cost, high carrier mobility (1500 and 450 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron and hole), narrow bandgap (1.12 eV) matching a large portion of the solar spectrum, and capabilities for large-scale production. Unfortunately, Si tends to be corroded under illumination under alkaline conditions. Therefore, a protecting layer on the Si photoanode is necessary. Covering with a dielectric layer, e.g., HfO2 or TiO2, may protect Si from corrosion, but it also increases the OER overpotential.2–4 For highly efficient Si photoanodes, the protecting layer is multifunctional; it not only protects the Si electrode from photocorrosion, but also serves as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to decrease the kinetic barriers of the OER. Ir and Ru oxides are usually used as protecting layers and they can enhance the kinetics of the OER.5 However, IrO2 and RuO2 suffer from low stability and dissolution problems at high anodic potentials, where they are oxidized to IrO3 and RuO4 and dissolve in solution.6,7 Moreover, their high prices further restrict their large-scale application. Recently, substantial research efforts have been devoted to the study of first-row transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) oxides as protecting layers, and it has been revealed that the incorporation of different metal atoms in oxides can dramatically improve catalytic performance.8–10 It was reported that Ni(1−x)Fex oxyhydroxide possesses excellent OER activity.11 Hence, binary metal oxides are considered as promising protecting layers to replace Ir and Ru oxides due to their moderate conductivities, low cost, ease of application and environmental benignity. Cobalt oxide is one of the most effective non-precious OER catalysts, with low price and good tolerance to a broad range of pH values. An ab initio study of a wide range of elemental and compound semiconductors found that Co3O4 is stable during illuminated water oxidation, because its thermodynamic oxidation potential is quite a lot lower than the water oxidation potential.12 Vanadium is another earth-abundant element, and has shown great OER activity in the form of VOOH.13,14 Further studies have indicated that vanadium oxide cluster anions could help to create active species through electron–phonon coupling.15 Moreover, the work function of stoichiometric V2O5 is extremely high (7.0 eV), which creates the advantage that it can serve as a hole-injection buffer layer for the anode.16 Introducing V into Co oxide can help to form a layered double hydroxide (LDH), because the high valance V cations (V3+, V4+ and V5+) occupy the centers of edge sharing octahedra, and adsorb more anions and solvation molecules as intercalated species in the interlayer region under hydration to maintain electric neutrality.17 Decreasing the overpotential of the photoanode for water oxidation is important for saving energy and increasing the photon conversion efficiency for chemical energy, instead of it being wasted as heat. It was reported that the incorporation of V into Fe electrocatalysts led to an onset potential of 390 mV (10 mA cm−2), and the incorporation of V into Ni electrocatalysts led to a low overpotential of 350 mV (27 mA cm−2), which is comparable to NiFe and IrO2.14,18 However, detailed mechanisms for the enhancement of catalytic activities under V doping remain unclear.
Normal photoanodes employing an n-type semiconductor as a substrate generally suffer photovoltage loss associated with hole extraction barriers. An implanted p+n silicon (p+nSi) anode structure maintains a characteristic hole density at the semiconductor interface, which can overcome this photovoltage loss.3 Meanwhile, the degenerated p+ layer pins the Fermi level at its surface, encouraging the photovoltage to be independent of catalysts at its surface. Depositing a thin catalyst layer on the surface of p+nSi to construct a photoanode is an effective method to decrease the onset potential for water oxidation, and to protect the photoanode from photocorrosion. Zhou et al. deposited a 50 nm thick CoOx on planar n-Si (100) via ALD, and obtained a photovoltage of 570 mV and a photocurrent density of 23.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).19 Yang et al. constructed p+nSi/CoOx photoanodes with nanotextured interfaces via plasma-assisted ALD, and obtained a photovoltage of 610 mV and a photocurrent density of 17 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE.20 However, ALD is an expensive and complicated method to prepare a protective layer. Furthermore, ALD is usually used to prepare metal oxides of single elements, and it is hard to prepare binary metal oxides or carry out metal oxide doping using this method. As mentioned above, binary metal oxides usually possess better catalytic properties and stabilities than single metal oxides; thus, finding other methods to prepare composite oxides is necessary.
Experimental section
Materials
Ethanol (AR, ≥99.7%), isopropyl alcohol (AR, ≥99.7%), acetone (AR, ≥99.5%), HF (AR, ≥40%), KOH (AR, 99%), KNO3 (AR, 99%) and TMAOH (AR, ≥25%) were used as received without further treatment. The ultrapure water (resistivity = 18 MΩ cm) used for preparing solutions was obtained from a Milli-Q system.
Preparation of p+nSi substrates
Commercial p+nSi cells were provided by YingLi Co., Ltd. The thermal diffusion of B2H6 into n-Si forms a heterojunction. The p+ region was measured to be about 200 nm, and the boron concentration is as high as 1020 atom per cm3. The sheet resistance of the prepared p+nSi cell is about 63 Ω □−1. The original 156 × 156 mm2 p+nSi cell was cut into 2 × 2 cm2 slices using a laser scribing machine. Polished nSi (1–10 Ω cm) and p+Si (0.001–0.005 Ω cm) were obtained from MCL Electronic Materials. All these slices were cleaned using ultrasonic waves with ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and acetone mixed solutions for 30 min, and were soaked in 10% HF solution for 10 min. Quartz slices underwent the same cleaning procedures without HF solution soaking.
Film deposition
Co3O4 and (Co + V)Ox films were deposited on p+nSi, nSi, p+Si, and SiO2 using an ultrahigh vacuum magnetron sputtering system (ULVAC, ACS-400-C4). The samples with p+nSi/Cr substrates were prepared through magnetron sputtering 2 nm-thick Cr on clean p+nSi first, with a direct current (DC) power of 150 W. Cobalt oxide was deposited on the substrate via Ar and O2 plasma sputtering using a DC model with a constant power of 150 W for 70 s. In the meantime, the doping of V was realized via co-sputtering using a radio frequency (RF) model. The two different particle types of Co and V were oxidized through Ar and O plasma, and they then flew to the substrate from two different directions. The doping concentration of V can be adjusted using RF powers of 50, 80 and 110 W, which correspond to 2.91, 4.96 and 7.76 atom% V in the films, respectively. The background vacuum was 2.3 × 10−5 Pa, and the reaction gases were Ar (99.99%, 10 sccm) and O2 (99.99%, 10 sccm). The nomenclatures for the samples and corresponding measurements are listed in Table S3.†
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
PEC measurements were conducted using in a standard three-electrode cell under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The three-electrode cell is a customizable 6 ml polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) cell with a quartz window, using a coiled 20 cm Pt wire as the counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode, and the sample as the working electrode. A rubber ring with a diameter of 10.77 mm was employed to normalize the exposed surface of the samples. Illumination was provided by an Abet SunLite solar simulator (Model: 11002), filtered using an AM1.5 filter, and was calibrated using a Newport power meter (Model: 2936-R) with an 884-UVR detector that was placed at the location of the working electrode. All experiments were carried out using a CHI650E potentiostat at room temperature of 22.7 degrees Celsius. Unless specified, all experiments were conducted at a scan rate of 20 or 10 mV s−1, and compensation was carried out in situ with the resistance that was measured before PEC experiments, using the CHI650E apparatus. The compensation resistances were 5.7–9.3 Ω in 1.0 M KOH (pH = 13.63), 13.0–15.0 Ω in 0.5 M KOH (pH = 13.44), 50.7–58.1 Ω in 0.1 M KOH (pH = 12.70), 30.1–35.6 Ω in 0.5 M TMAOH (pH = 13.22), and 30.8–32.3 Ω in 0.1 M TMAOH and 0.1 M KNO3 mixed solution (pH = 12.82). The applied potentials from the corresponding experiments were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (ERHE) using the following relationship (1): ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH(1)
The photocurrent densities in all experiments were normalized using the exposed surface area of 0.911 cm2.
Characterization
Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 microscope, and cross-sectional transmission electron micrographs (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron micrographs (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) data were measured using an FEG SEM (SIRION-100, FEI). Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies were conducted using a Rigaku Ultima IV Advanced X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). Raman spectra were recorded using a laser micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw; 532 nm excitation wavelength with a continuous-wave output power of 50 mW). Electrical measurements were recorded using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent B2912A). The samples for electrical measurement, EDX, GIXRD and Raman studies were all prepared under the same deposition conditions and an extended sputtering time of 14000 s. Optical transmittance spectra of films on quartz substrates were recorded using a UV-vis-near-IR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were recorded using Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi apparatus with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) and He Iα (21.22 eV) radiation sources, respectively. All samples were connected with gold foil to keep the same surface potential for work function measurements via UPS. Vacuum-annealing processes were conducted at 5 × 10−5 Pa, and samples were linearly heated from room temperature to the target temperature (200, 300 and 400 °C) over 40 min. The samples were kept at that temperature for 1 h, and then were naturally cooled down under vacuum.
Results and discussion
Herein, we report the fabrication of V-doped Co oxide photoanodes on p+nSi slices (p+nSi/CoO) via magnetron co-sputtering deposition. Magnetron sputtering deposition is a low-cost, efficient and environmentally benign mass production method for depositing coatings; it can be used to implement uniform doping though co-sputtering. p+nSi/CoO shows an onset potential of 1.04 V vs. RHE and a photocurrent density of 23.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. After V is doped into the Co oxide film, the onset potentials of p+nSi/CoVO samples are obviously decreased. The best performing p+nSi/CoVO shows a successfully decrease in the onset potential by 40 mV to 1.00 V vs. RHE; it also exhibits an extremely large photovoltage of 608 mV compared with p+Si/CoVO. The doped V plays a key role in decreasing the onset potential of p+nSi/CoVO, and the corresponding catalytic mechanism is systematically discussed.
The p+nSi used in this photoanode is a commercial product, with a 200 nm thick p+n junction fabricated via the thermal diffusion of boron into n-type silicon. p+nSi/CoVO can be prepared on a large scale (Fig. S1†). The doping concentration is as high as 1020 cm−3, which encourages the formation of a degenerated p+ layer in the near-surface area. The textured surface of p+nSi has a jagged pyramid-shaped morphology, with a height ranging from 1 to 5 μm (Fig. 1a and b). The deposition time for both Co3O4 and (Co + V)Ox is 70 seconds, with a constant DC power of 150 W for the Co source. The doping concentration of V is controlled through changing the radio frequency (RF) power of the V source from 50 to 80 or 110 W. The deposited samples are named p+nSi/CoO, p+nSi/CoVO-1, p+nSi/CoVO-2 and p+nSi/CoVO-3, respectively. In order to detail precisely the crystal structures and atom percentages of V in the films, another group of samples was prepared under the same sputtering conditions and with an extended deposition time of 14000 s. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra show that the atom percentages of V in p+nSi/CoVO-1, -2 and -3 are 2.91, 4.96 and 7.76%, respectively (Fig. S2†). Comparing SEM images of the original p+nSi (Fig. 1c) with p+nSi/CoVO-2 (Fig. 1d), it is found that the (Co + V)Ox film shows slightly roughened lateral pyramid sides, but doping with V doesn't obviously change the morphologies of the samples (Fig. S3†). A cross-sectional transmission electron micrograph (TEM) image (Fig. 1e) reveals that the film thickness is about 70 nm and the substrate, Si, has no obvious surface oxide layer. Optical transmittance spectra of Co3O4 and (Co + V)Ox deposited on SiO2 substrates under the same conditions (Fig. S4†) show that the films demonstrate the good transmission of solar light, especially light in the wavelength range of 450–1100 nm (T > 90%). A high-resolution transmission electron micrograph (HRTEM) image and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 1f) of p+nSi/CoVO-2 show that the film has the same crystal structure as Co3O4, and the lattice spacings are 2.30 Å for {311} and 1.98 Å for {400}. The lattice spacings show a little deviation from Co3O4 (000-002-1079: 2.43 Å for {311} and 2.02 Å for {400}). The reason for this is that the electronegativity of doped V (1.63) is less than that of Co (1.88), and this induces the shrinking of the Co3O4 lattice, which is also confirmed via the positive peak shifts of the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) patterns (Fig. S5†).

Fig. 2a shows photocurrent density vs. applied potential (J–E) curves for p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO-1, -2, and -3. The onset potential of p+nSi/CoVO is obviously reduced from doping V in the Co3O4 film (the same phenomenon is presented in J–E curves after an extended deposition time of 14000 s, as shown in Fig. S6†). Compared with p+nSi/CoO, p+nSi/CoVO-2 with a V concentration of 4.96 atom% has the largest decrease in the onset potential value, 40 mV, and the onset potential reaches 1.00 V vs. RHE, which equals the best reported value for a p+nSi/CoO photoanode.21 When shuttering the light, obvious transient photocurrent densities are observed, which demonstrates the great illumination response of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO-2 (Fig. S7†). The photocurrent density response of p+nSi/CoVO-2 increases sharply along with the applied potential after 1.00 V vs. RHE, however beyond 1.23 V vs. RHE, the response plateaus off to 29.15 mA cm−2. The difference between the plateau current densities of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO results from the different resistivities of the films and illumination disturbance from bubbles during the reactions (as shown in Video†). The extraordinary OER activity of p+nSi/CoVO is comparable to that of the most advanced photoanodes (Table S1†). Fig. 2b shows the J–E curves of p+nSi/CoVO-2, nSi/CoVO-2 and p+Si/CoVO-2. The photocurrent density of p+Si/CoVO-2 rises steeply from an onset of 1.608 V vs. RHE, demonstrating that the (Co + V)Ox film makes low resistance contact with p+Si.22 Meanwhile, the work function of (Co + V)Ox (5.11 eV, Fig. S8†), as a p-type semiconductor, is smaller than that of the p+ region of p+nSi (5.24 eV, Fig. S8†), which also supports ohmic contact at the interface between p+Si and (Co + V)Ox. nSi/CoVO-2 shows a modest slope in the photocurrent density at an onset of 1.319 V vs. RHE, and the heterojunction between nSi and the (Co + V)Ox film is capable of providing a small photovoltage under illumination due to Fermi level pinning. The Fermi level pinning derives from surface states at the interface between the (Co + V)Ox film and Si, induced by lattice mismatch. However, the photoanode with the p+nSi substrate can greatly decrease the onset potential by 608 mV, benefitting from the built-in electric field of p+nSi and the ohmic junction between p+Si and the (Co + V)Ox film. As shown in the proposed energy band diagram (Fig. S9†), at the junction of nSi/CoVO, the photo-excited holes need more energy to cross the band offset before reaching the electrolyte. However, at the junction of p+nSi/CoVO, the photo-excited holes are freely driven by the built-in electric field to react with the electrolyte, which is demonstrated via electrical measurements (Fig. S10†). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values at 1.23 V vs. RHE shown in Fig. 2c manifest that p+nSi/CoVO-2 has much higher efficiency than p+nSi/CoO over the whole wavelength range of solar light; in particular, an average 3.6-fold increase in the IPCE is achieved over the visible spectrum (400–800 nm), which results from the smaller onset potential and faster kinetics of p+nSi/CoVO-2. As shown in Fig. 2d, the photocurrent density vs. time (J–t) curve demonstrates that p+nSi/CoVO-2 in 1 M KOH at an applied potential of 1.6 V is stable for more than 3 hours, which shows the good stability of the photoanode. EDX mapping demonstrates that Co oxide contains well-distributed V before stability testing, and there is no obvious V segregation after stability testing (Fig. S11†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data are given in the Nyquist plots of undoped and doped p+nSi/CoO with and without illumination, as shown in Fig. 3a and S12,† which reveal that the doped V can obviously affect the transfer of holes from the substrate to the reactants. Circuit model fitting analysis of the EIS data shows that all electrodes can be modelled using a modified Randles circuit consisting of series resistance (RS), a constant phase element (Qdl), charge transfer resistance (RCT), and a modified mass-transport impedance element (dashed line box). When EIS measurements are taken in the dark (Fig. S12†), the high frequency range of the arcs, corresponding to Qdl and RCT, seen for p+nSi/CoO significantly decreases for p+nSi/CoVO-1 and -2, and completely disappears for p+nSi/CoVO-3. This demonstrates that RCT decreases with increasing V concentration in the films. However, when EIS measurements are taken under illumination, as shown in Fig. 3a, the double arcs in the EIS data taken in the dark are replaced by unclosed arcs, and p+nSi/CoVO-2 has the smallest RCT value. Moreover, the trails of the middle and low frequency ranges of the arcs, corresponding to the modified mass-transport impedance element, significantly deviate from the line of Warburg resistance (the slope is π/4), which manifests the presence of a limited mass-transport process at the interface between the photoanodes and electrolyte in 1 M KOH. The changes in EIS data with/without illumination indicate that a transformation may happen in the Co3O4 and (Co + V)Ox films.

It has been reported that cobalt oxide undergoes in situ progressive amorphization to form a LDH phase on surfaces upon exposure to alkaline electrolytes.21,23 CoOx(OH)y is a LDH structure, where Co cations occupy the centers of edge sharing octahedra, and vertexes of the octahedra contain hydroxide ions that connect to form infinite 2D sheets. It is well established that an amorphization process is undergone in p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO under illumination in alkaline solution; the transition of Co3O4 to CoOOH is confirmed from the redox peak of Co at −0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. S13†) and Raman spectra (Fig. S14†). There is an increase in the number of amorphous shells in the (Co + V)Ox film, which is also demonstrated from the open circuit potential (OCP) of the photoanode. The OCP in the photoanode before and after illumination can be treated as the output photovoltage; it can be seen from Fig. 3b that the output photovoltage decreases along with an increase in the V concentration. Because all the samples have identical p+nSi substrates and the contact between p+Si and (Co + V)Ox is ohmic contact, and meanwhile RCT decreases along with an increase in the V concentration, the loss of output photovoltage is attributed to the increased thickness of the amorphous shell. The decreased output photovoltage along with the increase in the V concentration demonstrates that introducing V into Co oxide can help to form LDHs. Due to the infinite 2D sheets of the amorphous shell of CoOOH, the solvation molecules and water molecules, as intercalated species between the ionic lamellar structures, can also participate in the OER. Therefore, the OER in an LDH structure not only takes place at the interface between the amorphous shell and the electrolyte, but also throughout all of the amorphous shell.24 Therefore, the electrochemical impedance of the photoanode is simultaneously dependent on the volume of the amorphous shell and the speed of proton–electron hopping through the amorphous shell of CoOOH, which is consistent with the limited mass-transport process observed in Fig. 3a. Meanwhile, the modified mass-transport impedance element can be well modeled as a parallel combination of the constant phase element of the LDH (QM) and the charge transfer resistance of the LDH (RM), as shown in the dashed line box in Fig. 3a. However, LDHs have poor electric conductivity; charge transport efficiency is related to physical ionic migration in the channels, to proton–electron hopping, or to both.25 The increase in the V concentration in the (Co + V)Ox film will increase the volume of the amorphous shell for faster reaction kinetics and meanwhile decrease the speed of proton–electron hopping through the amorphous shell. Hence, there is an optimal V concentration in this work; 4.96 atom% V in p+nSi/CoVO-2 shows the lowest electrochemical impedance in Fig. 3a, which is consistent with the J–E curves in Fig. 2a.

Fig. 3c shows the pH dependence of the onset potentials from 13.44 to 12.70 (0.5 to 0.1 M KOH) at 1 mA cm−2, which reveals the thermodynamic mechanism of proton and electron transfer in a quasi-reversible OER. The corresponding Pourbaix slopes (ΔEonset/ΔpH) are shown in the inset table in Fig. 3c. The Pourbaix slopes are inversely proportional to the concentration of doped V in the films. When the Pourbaix slope is close to the Nernstian shift of 59 mV pH−1, this indicates a process of concerted one-proton coupled one-electron transfer (PCET).26,27 Due to the low Pourbaix slope of 58.1 mV pH−1, 7.76 atom% V in p+nSi/CoVO-3 undergoes a typical PCET process in its thermodynamics. However, the unusual Nernstian 83.8 mV pH−1 value for p+nSi/CoO means that the process is part of decoupled proton transfer–electron transfer (PT/ET), because the concerted two proton–one electron transfer process is not thermodynamically allowed. In thermodynamics, different mechanisms for proton and electron transfer can be controlled via the surface concentration of reactants; here it refers to the local pH value. Normally, first-row transition metal oxides have a Lewis acid effect in aqueous solutions, where they have the ability to absorb hydroxyl in water. V, as one of the first-row transition metals, can sustain PCET against pH changes through an increase in the localized hydroxyl concentration, likened to the role of Fe in Ni reported by Li et al.28 As one of the surface states, the effects of Lewis acids will also contribute to the double-layer capacitance at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, which can be measured through the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The ECSA (Fig. S15†) increases along with an increase in the V concentration, which demonstrates the Lewis acid effects of V. Hence, a conceivable thermodynamic process in the Co3O4 film is that the PCET process lags behind hydroxyl adsorption at some of the Co active sites. Nevertheless, the Co active sites in the (Co + V)Ox film could undergo PCET via a reaction between Co active sites and neighboring vicinal/geminal hydroxyls at V sites, and the rich adsorption of hydroxyl can facilitate PCET for the OER. The lower Pourbaix slope of p+nSi/CoVO reveals that the OER is conducted more easily with p+nSi/CoVO than p+nSi/CoO, thermodynamically, because the Lewis acid effects of V can increase the local pH value.
However, normal Pourbaix diagrams do not take kinetic effects into account, meaning that they cannot reveal situations with a different chemical turnover-limiting step (TLS). Different from the quasi-reversible OER process described by Pourbaix slopes, Tafel slopes reveal the irreversible OER at photoanodes, which can be controlled by kinetic OER routes. In Fig. 3d, p+nSi/CoVO-2 exhibits a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1, which is much smaller than that of p+nSi/CoO (80 mV dec−1). The smaller Tafel slope demonstrates the faster kinetics of the OER in p+nSi/CoVO-2, which means that different TLSs are involved in charge transport, and V probably plays a key role in the irreversible OER.29 Meanwhile, the chemical hardness scale proposed by Pearson et al. characterizes both Co3+ and VO2+ as strong Lewis acids.30 Lewis acidity is offered by the acidity coefficient (pKa) of the hexaaqua metal complex; experiments by Gilson et al. indicate that the pKa of [V(OH2)6]3+ is 2.6, which is only a little smaller than that of [Co(OH2)6]3+ (pKa = 2.9).31 Therefore, the Lewis acid effect of V in (Co + V)Ox film probably does not fully account for the OER improvement. Therefore, more analysis into the mechanism of the enhanced OER performance is needed.
To further analyze the role of V in the (Co + V)Ox films, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. The main comparison of XPS spectra is carried out between samples before hydration (hereafter represented as “before OER”, Fig. S16†) and those naturally dried after the OER (hereafter represented by “after OER”, Fig. 4) for p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO. From a multipeak fitting procedure on the O 1s core level before the OER (Fig. S16†), the spectra can be resolved into four different bonding energy (BE) peaks: O1, O2, O3 and O4 stand for lattice O (BE = 529.9 eV), nonstoichiometric oxygen or hydroxide (BE = 531.4 eV), chemisorbed H2O (BE = 532.2 eV) and physisorbed H2O (BE = 534 eV), respectively. From a multipeak fitting procedure on the Co 2p core level before the OER (Fig. S16†), the main spectra can be resolved into three different BE peaks: Co(II) (BE = 780.7 eV); CoOOH (BE = 780.18 eV); and Co3O4 (BE = 779.6 eV). Comparing the XPS spectra of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO before the OER, it is found that the intensities of the Co3O4 peaks are a little increased after V doping and V 2p peaks are presented (Fig. S17 and Table S2†), which is consistent with the sharper {311} peak in the GIXRD spectrum of p+nSi/CoVO. Meanwhile, comparing the XPS spectra of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO before and after the OER, the samples demonstrate two notable and interesting changes, as shown in Fig. 4. Firstly, the intensity of the O3 peak in p+nSi/CoO is increased after the OER, because the OER is accompanied by hydration. Nevertheless, for p+nSi/CoVO after the OER, the intensities of the O3 peaks decrease, and intensities of the O2 peaks increase along with the increase in the V concentration. Weidler et al. attributed the peaks in the range of 531–531.7 eV to either nonstoichiometric oxygen or hydroxide species, which depend on the preparation method.32 In the XPS spectra of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO after the OER, the O2 peaks represent chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, because the sites of O defects have high activity in alkaline solution for adsorbing hydroxyl groups. Thus, the decreased intensities of the O3 peaks and the increased intensities of the O2 peaks in the XPS spectra of p+nSi/CoVO after the OER indicate that part of the chemisorbed water was replaced by chemisorbed hydroxyl groups, which is consistent with the discussion of the Lewis acid effects of V in p+nSi/CoVO provided above. Secondly, Co(II) presents as both CoO and Co3O4 with O defects in p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO before the OER, and presents as both CoO and Co(OH)2 in p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO after the OER. The notable changes in the Co 2p peaks in the XPS data after the OER are decreased intensities of the Co(II) peaks and increased intensities of the CoOOH peaks both in p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO. Moreover, the difference in the relative intensities of Co(II) and CoOOH becomes larger along with an increase in the V concentration. The transformation of Co from Co(II) to CoOOH was reported in many papers relating to Co oxide electrocatalysts, and it is generally recognized that CoOOH is the formal oxidation state for the OER. Hence, the XPS spectra here show that doped V can elevate the active sites of Co though the adsorption of hydroxyl groups and the transformation from Co(II) to CoOOH during the OER.

Up to now, the transformation from Co(II) to CoOOH has mostly been probed using ex situ or operando methods.33,34 It was reported that Co(III) in CoOOH could be further converted to a higher active state of Co(IV), and Co(IV) plays a significant role in PCET, because it acts as a necessary precursor for forming the O–O bond in the OER.35 Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering studies and DFT calculations by Hadt et al. indicated that the electron–hole delocalization in a Co4O4 cubane of a LDH could actually prevent the formation of Co(IV), while redox-inactive metal substitution with Lewis acid effects could enhance Co(IV) formation through switching the ground state, modifying metal–metal and antibonding interactions across the cluster.36 Then, doped V, as one of the effective redox-inactive metal substitutes with Lewis acid effects in (Co + V)Ox, can help the formation of Co(IV) to increase the number of active sites and facilitate regeneration. Co(IV) is in the form of isolated CoIVO or adjacent oxo-bridged CoIVO; both of these can facilitate the PCET process, and they can only be probed via in situ experiments, because they are extremely unstable and highly active. It is believed that oxo-bridged CoIVO has faster kinetics to drive O–O bonding and release O2 than isolated CoIVO.34–37 The oxo-bridged CoIVO mechanism is proposed for mixed metal catalysts to explain the unusually small Tafel slopes and high coverage of hydroxyl. p+nSi/CoVO-2 in this work has a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1 and a higher coverage of hydroxyl than p+nSi/CoO, which is consistent with the oxo-bridged CoIVO mechanism. In order to verify the presence and form of Co(IV), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) is employed to probe the presence of oxo-bridged CoIVO during the OER. TMA+ is a surfactant cation, and undergoes specific interactions with oxygen species formed upon deprotonation.38 Here, TMA+ can selectively bond with oxo-bridged CoIVO, and hamper the high efficiency of the catalyst. In order to maintain a constant ionic strength, proper amounts of 0.1 and 0.5 M KNO3 solutions were used for mixing. As shown in Fig. 5, the differences between the J–E curves in a TMAOH + KNO3 mixed solution of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO are hard to distinguish. Furthermore, the differences in onset potentials between p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO in pure TMAOH solution (Fig. S18†) are also much smaller than the 40 mV shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with p+nSi/CoO in 0.5 M TMAOH, the onset potential is merely improved by 9 mV (Fig. S18†) for the best performing sample of p+nSi/CoVO-2. These results suggest that TMA+ has interacted with the oxo-bridged CoIVO in the (Co + V)Ox film during the OER, and forced p+nSi/CoVO to perform with an onset potential close to that of p+nSi/CoO. The rest of the differences in the onset potential between p+nSi/CoVO and p+nSi/CoO come from the Lewis acid effects of doped V. Therefore, the J–E curves in TMAOH solution give clear evidence confirming the presence of oxo-bridged CoIVO in the OER. Ruling out the formation of concomitant O vacancies during the doping of V resulting in the improved catalytic activity (Fig. S19†), the doped V is the main factor boosting the generation of oxo-bridged CoIVO.

According to the above analysis regarding the influence of doped V on the catalytic activity in this work,29,34,35,38 a practicable catalytic mechanism is proposed to explain the catalytic behavior of the Co atoms and the role of doped V in the OER. As shown in Scheme 1, in the Co3O4 film, the Co(II) sites in the LDH are firstly activated by reactions R1 and R2 to form CoOOH (species A in Scheme 1), which is the formal oxidation state for the OER. Due to electron–hole delocalization in the Co4O4 cubane, A is only prone to transform to isolated CoIVO (species B in Scheme 1; CoIVO is also recorded as CoIII–O˙ in other works) at low applied potentials, which is consistent with the sluggish Tafel slope of p+nSi/CoO. Then, B undergoes three PCET processes to complete the whole OER, tracking the cycle C1 (A → B → C → D → A) in Scheme 1 to sustain the OER at low applied potentials. In the (Co + V)Ox film, the Co(II) sites in the LDH undergo similar processes (R′1–3) to form isolated CoIVO (species B′ in Scheme 1), which is supported by the reported results of Görlin et al.26 In his work, operando DEMS studies manifested that the generation of O2 was a little behind the valence changes of catalytic atoms. However, because V can switch its ground state and modify metal–metal and antibonding interactions across the cluster,36 B′ can transform to a more active state (species C′ in Scheme 1), which has oxo-bridged CoIVO in the cubane. Then, the OER with the (Co + V)Ox film is performed via a different cycle, C2 (A′ → B′ → C′ → D′ → E′ → A′). Cycle C2 includes a water hydrogen atom abstraction (WHAA) process, which can easily generate a hydroperoxo intermediate (species D′ in cycle C2 or species C in cycle C1) thermodynamically. In both the C1 and C2 cycles, the O–O bond formation reactions R4 and R′4 are still the TLSs in the OER, because the free energy for forming –OOH is the highest at low applied potentials in each cycle.39 However, C′ shows faster O–O bond formation than B kinetically, which corresponds to the smaller Tafel slope of p+nSi/CoVO in Fig. 3d. Meanwhile, the oxo-bridged CoIVO (species C′ in Scheme 1) can simultaneously serve as a catalyst to facilitate R′1–3, with the generation of isolated CoIVO (species B′ in Scheme 1) as the reduction product,29 which is consistent with the increased intensities of the CoOOH peaks in Raman and XPS measurements. As the OER goes along in cycles C1 and C2, the hydroxyls in the interlayer region of the LDH are rapidly depleted at high applied potentials; the OER is gradually governed by proton–electron hopping through the amorphous shell or a hydroxyl transport process, which corresponds to the linear relation between the applied potential and the photocurrent densities in Fig. 2a. Actually, because the Pourbaix slopes of p+nSi/CoO and p+nSi/CoVO in TMAH solution are different to those in KOH solution, cycles C2 and C1 are not completely abandoned in films of Co3O4 and (Co + V)Ox, respectively; nevertheless, the predominant cycle is different in each film.

Conclusions
In conclusion, V-doped Co oxide films were deposited on p+nSi with a jagged surface to serve as photoanodes via the cheap and convenient method of magnetron co-sputtering deposition. High efficiency photoanodes for the OER, using the films, are demonstrated. The best performing photoanode, p+nSi/CoVO, shows a 3.6-fold increase in the IPCE under visible light, and a 40 mV decrease in the onset potential compared to p+nSi/CoO, helping the onset potential of p+nSi/CoVO reach 1 V vs. RHE. The doping of V can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the Co3O4 film, increase the local pH value via Lewis acid effects, and facilitate the generation of oxo-bridged CoIVO. These factors are combined to improve the OER performance of p+nSi/CoVO. This research extends our knowledge of the catalytic mechanism of redox-inactive metal substitution with Lewis acid effects, and presents a wide range of possibilities for the further development of high efficiency photoanodes for commercial applications.
