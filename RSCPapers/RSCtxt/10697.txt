    , Accepted 25th May 2011First published on 16th June 2011AbstractPhotocurrents of a ruthenium dye–TiO2 system are enhanced by gold nanoparticles (100 or 40 nm diameter) embedded in TiO2. As dye–particle spacing decreases to 10 nm, enhancement factor and intensity of localized electric fields at the TiO2 surface increase. A further decrease in the spacing suppresses the enhancement.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as cost-effective solar cells.1 DSSCs work on the basis of electron transfer from LUMO of a photo-excited dye (e.g., a Ru complex) to conduction band of TiO2 and that from I− to HOMO of the dye. In general, nanoporous TiO2 is used and a large amount of dye molecules are adsorbed on the porous TiO2 for efficient use of incident photons. However, electrons and redox species (i.e., I3−/I−) have to move long distance in TiO2 and nanopores, respectively, resulting often in high internal resistance, which suppresses the fill factor and the energy conversion efficiency. Also, the nanoporous structure sometimes prevents solid electrolytes from being used in the cells.
On the other hand, it has been reported that Ag and Au nanoparticles (NPs) enhance dye-sensitized photocurrents.2 The enhancement effect is believed to be based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of NPs. Oscillating conduction electrons of metal NPs resonate with the electric field of incident light, giving rise to oscillating electric fields (i.e., optical near field) that are localized in the vicinity of the metal NPs.3 The localized electric fields can excite dyes more efficiently than the incident far field light; the NPs function as light harvesting antennae for dyes. The photocurrent enhancement has also been achieved in silicon solar cells and organic thin film solar cells.3a,4 Similar processes are involved in surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)5 and fluorescence enhancement.3a,3b,6 The LSPR-based photocurrent enhancement in DSSCs is expected to reduce the consumption of expensive Ru-complex dyes. It also allows one to make the pores larger and shallower, so that transport of redox species in the pores would be facilitated and solid electrolytes and hole transport materials would be used instead of liquid electrolytes.
With these in mind, we developed an enhancement system for dye-sensitized photocurrents by Au NPs to reveal details of the enhancement effect, in particular effects of the dye–NP spacing and the size of NPs. So far, enhancement of dye-sensitized photocurrents by Ag NPs has been reported to increase monotonically as the dye–NP spacing decreases from 8 to 5 nm and 5 to 2 nm, for the system with anatase TiO2 and amorphous TiO2, respectively, prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD).2c Here we developed our system by employing anatase TiO2 prepared by a spray pyrolysis technique,7 which is a much more convenient and inexpensive way, and Au NPs, which are thermally, chemically and photochemically more stable than Ag NPs. The thermal stability of Au NPs allows the employment of spray pyrolysis and the use of the thin anatase TiO2 films. We prepared photoanodes with a Au NP/anatase TiO2/dye structure (Fig. 1a), in which the dye–NP spacing was controlled by the TiO2 thickness to be 3–38 nm, and found the optimum spacing to be ∼10 nm. We also report a quenching effect on the enhancement of dye-sensitized photocurrents for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, 100 nm Au NPs exhibit a greater enhancement effect than 40 nm NPs in the present system. These behaviours are similar to those for LSPR-based fluorescence enhancement,6 suggesting that LSPR plays an essential role in the present photocurrent enhancement.

A smooth ITO (indium tin oxide)-coated glass plate (Kuramoto) was modified with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, and Au NPs (diameter = 100 or 40 nm, Tanaka Kikinzoku) were adsorbed on the surface. Adsorption densities were 3.75 particles μm−2 for 100 nm Au NP and 23.6 particles μm−2 for 40 nm Au NP so that the ratio of the surface area of the NPs to the projected area of the ITO surface was 0.12 in both cases. The ITO surface with Au NPs and a bare ITO surface were coated with thin TiO2 films prepared by a spray pyrolysis method from a 2-propanol solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (spray pressure was 0.12 MPa, spray time was 1 s, calcined at 500 °C for 30 min). The thickness was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to be 3–38 nm for the TiO2 films prepared from the 0.045–0.374 M solution. The TiO2-coated electrodes were immersed for 12 h in ethanol containing 0.5 mM N719 dye (Solaronix), followed by thorough rinsing. Photocurrents of the obtained ITO/Au NP/TiO2/dye or ITO/TiO2/dye electrode (26.4 mm2) were examined by constructing a two-electrode cell with a platinum-coated ITO counter electrode. The gap between the electrodes (5 mm) was filled with N2-saturated acetonitrile containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine. LSPR-based absorption of the Au NPs coated with TiO2 did not decrease in the electrolyte solution, which is very corrosive to Au, during the photoelectrochemical measurements, indicating that the TiO2 films are sufficiently dense and that contact of Au NPs with the dye and the redox species (i.e., I3−/I−) can be ignored.
Short-circuit photocurrents were measured at various wavelengths (460–700 nm, full width at half maximum = 10 nm) at a constant photon flux (1.0 × 1015photons cm−2s−1). Both of the electrodes prepared with and without Au NPs (100 or 40 nm) exhibited anodic photocurrents in the wavelength range examined. The action spectra in terms of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE, the number of electrons generated in the external circuit divided by the number of incident photons) for electrodes with 10 nm thick TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2a. The short-circuit photocurrents for the electrode without Au NPs (i.e., ITO/TiO2/dye) peaked at 520 nm, which was almost the same wavelength as the absorption peak wavelength of the dye adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 2b). The electrodes with Au NPs exhibited significantly higher photocurrents than the electrode without Au NPs. The peaks of the photocurrent were observed in between the absorption peak wavelengths of the dye and Au NPs, likely because the dye-sensitized photocurrents were enhanced by excited Au NPs. Incidentally, the wavy spectra of Au NPs (Fig. 2b) are explained in terms of uncompensated interference effects of the layered film consisting of ITO and TiO2. Actually, the interference effects were negligible for samples with more thick TiO2 layers (≥20 nm). The difference in the photocurrents between the electrodes with and without Au NPs was sufficiently larger than the photocurrents of an ITO/Au NP/TiO2 electrode8 without dye (peak IPCE = 0.01%). Also, photocurrent enhancement factors (photocurrent ratio of the electrode with Au NPs to that without NPs) were obviously much higher than the ratio of the TiO2 surface area of the electrode with Au NPs to that without Au NPs, which is 1.12 or less. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the dye-sensitized photocurrents were significantly enhanced by Au NPs embedded in TiO2.

Results of control experiments without dye or without Au NPs are also shown. (b) %Absorption spectra of an ITO/10 nm TiO2/N719 dye electrode and ITO/100 or 40 nm Au NP/10 nm TiO2 electrodes. 
We also examined dependence of the photocurrent on the TiO2 thickness (= dye–NP spacing) under visible light (>480 nm, 100 mW cm−2) (Fig. 3). As the dye–NP spacing decreased from 38 to 3 nm, the enhancement factor increased gradually, followed by a sharp drop. The maximum enhancement factors of 3.1 and 2.3 were obtained for Au NPs of 100 and 40 nm diameter, respectively, at the dye–NP spacing of 9 nm and 7 nm, respectively. These behaviours are quite similar to those for LSPR-based fluorescence enhancement,6 suggesting a possibility that the dye-sensitized photocurrent enhancement is strongly related to localized electric fields at the TiO2 surface, to which the dye molecules adsorb. We therefore calculated distributions of electric field intensity by a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method (FDTD Solutions, Lumerical Solutions) on the basis of models with a single Au NP on ITO coated with TiO2. These models are appropriate since the Au NPs are well dispersed in experiments as shown in Fig. 1b. It is obvious from the calculated results (Fig. 1c) that the electric fields are localized in the vicinity of the TiO2–Au and TiO2–electrolyte interfaces, and that the electric field intensities increase as the TiO2 thickness decreases. These simulation results are reasonable if the dye-sensitized photocurrents are enhanced due to the electric fields localized at the TiO2 surface.

However, when the TiO2 thickness is less than 7 nm, the enhancement factor decreases with decreasing dye–NP spacing, whereas the electric field intensity increases (data not shown). The drop of the enhancement factor could be explained in terms of (1) energy transfer from dye to a NP and/or (2) back electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the HOMO of dye and the oxidized electron donor (I3−) in the electrolyte. In the case of the LSPR-based fluorescence enhancement, its attenuation when the dye–NP spacing is small has been explained in terms of the energy transfer from a dye molecule to a metal NP. On the other hand, the back electron transfer is related to space-charge layers formed in the TiO2 film. Both of the TiO2–Au and TiO2–electrolyte junctions are Schottky type, so that Schottky barriers form at both interfaces. After electrons are injected from excited dye molecules into the TiO2 conduction band, back electron transfer is considered to be suppressed by the Schottky barrier at the TiO2–electrolyte interface, whose thickness is generally about 200 nm. A far thinner TiO2 layer and interference from the TiO2–Au Schottky junction may lower the Schottky barrier at the TiO2–electrolyte interface, resulting in facilitated back electron transfer from TiO2 to dye and I3−.
Thus we observed the quenching effect on the enhancement of dye-sensitized photocurrents. On the other hand, Hupp et al.2c did not observe the quenching effect. Their photocurrents increased as the dye–NP spacing decreased from 8 to 5 nm and 5 to 2 nm. This is possibly due to the use of Ag NPs, amorphous TiO2 and N3 dye, which should affect the energy transfer and the electronic structure in the space-charge layer. Snaith et al.2d reported that they observed no significant change in the cell performance when the dye–NP spacing was increased from 3 to 8 nm. These results suggest that the enhancement and quenching effects depend strongly on the structure, composition and parameters of the system.
The enhancement factor for 100 nm NPs was higher than that for 40 nm NPs when the TiO2 thickness is 10 nm (Fig. 3), despite the lower electric field intensity (Fig. 1c). Broader electric field distribution for the 100 nm NP may be responsible for the higher enhancement.
In summary, dye-sensitized photocurrents are enhanced by Au NPs and the enhancement is suppressed when the dye–NP spacing is <7 nm. Although the maximum enhancement factor is 3.1 under >480 nm light, ∼87.4% of the total surface area is that for TiO2 coated on ITO, not on the Au NPs. The effective enhancement factor would be ∼15, if the TiO2 regions on the Au NPs are exclusively taken into account. The experimentally observed enhancement factor would be improved to this effective value by increasing the amount of Au NPs.
