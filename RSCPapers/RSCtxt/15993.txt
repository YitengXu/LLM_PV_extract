    , Accepted 14th January 2014First published on 14th January 2014AbstractA new type of simple organic solid additive, 2,3-pyridinediol, was added into the active layer of a Bulk Hetero-Junction Polymer Solar Cell (BHJ-PSC) to improve the processing and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device. The 2,3-pyridinediol additive, which has pyridyl and hydroxyl groups, can interact with both P3HT and PC61BM (via π–π interactions or/and hydrogen-bonding), reorganizing the phase/domain and vertical distribution of the blended film. Therefore, even without thermal annealing, P3HT/PC61BM/2,3-pyridinediol film forms bicontinuous interpenetrated nano-domain networks with more P3HT close to the PEDOT:PSS anode. The 2,3-pyridinediol additive also can improve the efficiency of BHJ-PSCs based on other n-type materials such as ICBA (PCE of the device based on ICBA/P3HT increased from 3.35 to 5.93% after addition of the additive) and p-type materials such as PTB7 (PCE of the device using a PTB7/PC71BM active layer increased from 5.30 to 7.54% after addition of the additive). Moreover, the thermal stability of the PTB7/PC71BM/2,3-pyridinediol blended film is better than PTB7/PC71BM blended with 1,8-diiodooctane. When the active films were heated at 100 °C for 30 min, the PCE of PSC based on PTB7/PC71BM/1,8-diiodooctane decreased 20% (from 6.62% to 4.26%), whereas the PCE of PSC using a PTB7/PC71BM/2,3-pyridinediol blended film as an active layer decreased only ca. 3% (7.54% decreased to 7.30%). A small molecule solid additive in the active layer can mix well with the active components and will not be removed during the device fabrication processes. Therefore, the morphology of the active film can be well-controlled and PCEs of the corresponding devices are more reproducible.
1. Introduction
High efficiency and low fabrication costs combined with solution processing and flexibility have made organic photovoltaics (OPVs) potential candidates for the next generation low-cost solar cells.1–4 Inverted bulk hetero-junction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) incorporating low-band gap conjugated polymers (such as PTB74 or PBTl3T5) and fullerene derivatives have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to approximately 9%.5–9 Furthermore, tandem cells based on oligomers with PCE values of up to 12% have also been certified.10 In a BHJ-PSC, the morphology of the polymer blend (active layer) has a crucial influence on the photo physics of the active film and the performance of the corresponding device.11,13 However, controlling the morphology of the active film to obtain the best performance of the device is extremely difficult since the optimal morphology of the active layer is not thermodynamically stable. As a result, the nanoscale morphology of the active layer (film) is greatly affected by the film processing conditions and the best morphology can be obtained only by kinetically controlling the non-equilibrium state. Therefore, optimizing the active layer processing conditions using methods such as thermal14–16 or solvent17–19 annealing or additives20–23 is necessary in order to achieve a high device efficiency. Among these methods, the addition of additives into the active layer is the simplest and most effective.
Research using additives started with Bazan and coworkers24 who found that adding n-octylthiol into a P3HT/PC61BM blend dramatically enhanced the structural order of the P3HT domain. As a result, the hole mobility increased by two orders of magnitude. In the following year, Heeger and coworkers21 used 1,8-octanedithiol as an additive in a PCPDTBT/PC71BM system and found that PCE of the resulting devices increased from 2.8 to 5.5% with the additive. They believed that the increase in the structural order of PCPDTBT caused by the addition of 1,8-octanedithiol could be the reason for the increase in PCE. The same group later found that 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)25 could also be an effective additive for enhancing the efficiency of BHJ-PSCs. The additive is generally a higher boiling point substance compared to the host solvent (such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene or chlorobenzene) and a good solvent for PCBM, therefore it was believed that during the film drying process, PCBM stayed longer in solution than the polymer. This may allow PCBM to reorganize, resulting in better nanophase segregated structures with appropriate domain sizes.26 Furthermore, Wei et al.27 found that a 1,6-diiodohexane (DIH) additive could induce not only higher polymer crystallinity (2.4 and 3.6 times in the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively), but also decrease the average size of the aggregated PC71BM clusters to 30 nm (from 150 nm for the film without the additive). Both Cheng28 and Heeger29 reported that 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) could also be used as a good processing additive, where PCE is improved as a result of an increase in the Jsc value. It is now widely accepted that the function of high boiling point liquid additives is to reduce the aggregation of n-type fullerene and enhance the crystallinity of the self-organized p-type polymer via selective solubility towards one component. Furthermore, ferroelectric oxides,30 Au nanoparticles,31 discotic liquid crystals,32 4-bromoanisole,33 C60-end capped P3HT,34 diblock copolymers35–37 and various other substances38,39 have all been reported to be processing additives that improve the performance of BHJ-PSCs. Nevertheless, the detailed mechanism has not been clearly addressed.
Low-band gap conjugated polymers, such as PTB7 (ref. 4) have many excellent properties, including broad absorption in the solar spectrum, which ensures the effective harvesting of solar photons, high charge mobility for carrier transport, energy levels that match those of fullerenes, providing a large open-circuit voltage, and enough offset for charge separation. A PSC based on PTB7/PC71BM using DIO as an additive achieved a PCE of 7.40% (without DIO the PCE (3.92%) was very poor).6 However, PTB7/PC71BM blended films are very thermally sensitive even with the DIO additive. For example, our experiments have shown that PCE of a BHJ-PSC based on PTB7:PC71BM with an DIO additive decreased significantly (20%) when the active film was heated at 100 °C for 30 minutes. Therefore, searching for new additives with new functionality in order to increase the thermal stability of the active film is very important for the practical application of low band-gap polymers in BHJ-PSCs.
In this article a new additive, 2,3-pyridinediol, for improving the photovoltaic performance and processing of BHJ-PSCs was reported. We first study the effect of 2,3-pyridinediol on the physical properties of a P3HT/PC61BM blend and PCE of the corresponding device in order to investigate the function of this new additive. We have then proven that 2,3-pyridinediol is an all-purpose additive that can significantly improve PCE of BHJ-PSCs based on P3HT/ICBA and PTB7/PC71BM active films. Finally, we demonstrated that the thermal stability of the PTB7/PC71BM blended film also increases in the presence of the 2,3-pyridinediol additive.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and physicochemical studies
RR-P3HT (region-regularity > 95%, from Rieke Metal Inc., America), PBT7 (1-Material Chemscitech Inc., Canada), and the fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM and ICBA, Solenne B. V., Netherlands) were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra were recorded with Hitachi U-4100 and F-7000 spectrometers, respectively. AFM images were obtained using a Digital Instruments Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope (E-sweep, SEIKO Inc., Japan). The thickness of the active film was measured with a depth-profile meter (Veeco Dektak 150, USA). Five lines on a film of 1 cm × 1 cm were made by carefully scratching with a plastic tip and the average height between the hills and valleys is used to represent the film thickness. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer PHI-590AM XPS/ESCA spectrometer system with a Cylindrical Mirror Electron (CMA) energy analyser. The X-ray sources were Al Kα at 600 W and Mg Kα at 400 W. XPS were measured at pass energies of 160 eV and 10 eV for the survey scans and high-resolution scans, respectively. Data analysis was carried out with the OriginPro 8 software package. The surface energy of the blended films was measured with a contact angle measuring system (Sigma Force tensiometers) using the pendant drop method. H2O and CH2I2 were used as probe liquids and the surface energy was calculated from the contact angle of the liquids on the film surface using the OWRK (Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble) method. In order to determine the hole-only mobility, devices comprising ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/P3HT-PC61BM (100 nm with and without additive)/Au (100 nm) were fabricated. The hole mobility of the active layer was determined using the space charge limiting current (SCLC) method.40
2.2. OPV device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
P3HT and PC61BM were dissolved in 1 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene (conc. for each component is 20 mg mL−1) in a 1:1 weight ratio, then various amounts of 2,3-pyridinediol were added and the resulting mixtures were stirred overnight. BHJ-PSC devices were fabricated followed a previous literature report,39 except for the preparation of the active layer. A 30 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, from H.C. Starck, Baytron® P, PH 1000) was used as a hole transport layer, 20 nm of calcium and 100 nm of aluminum (or silver) were deposited onto the blended film by thermal evaporation to form a cathode. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by the spin rate. The active area of the device is 0.2 cm × 0.5 cm. P3HT/ICBA and PBT7/PC71BM systems were prepared using a similar process. The J–V curves of all of the devices are measured using a Keithley 4200 source-measuring unit. A calibrated solar simulator (Oriel) with a 100 mW cm−2 power density was used as the light source. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in air and a chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for the phase sensitive detection with QE-R3011 (Enlitech Inc., Taiwan).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The effect of the 2,3-pyridinediol additive on PCE of BHJ-PSCs based on P3HT/PCBM blended films
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the P3HT/PC61BM based devices with or without the 2,3-pyridinediol additive and with or without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 1 and the photovoltaic data are listed in Table 1. The device based on an active layer without the additive and thermal annealing (the pristine film) exhibits poor photovoltaic characteristics (PCE = 1.53%) due to the fragmented phases that were formed in the blended film during the high rate (1600 rpm) spinning process,41 which significantly reduced the time available for P3HT to aggregate. On one hand, a higher efficiency (3.55%) is observed only when the active layer undergoes thermal annealing in order to reorganize both P3HT and PC61BM components. On the other hand, when 2,3-pyridinediol (20 mg in 1 mL dichlorobenzene) is added into the P3HT/PC61BM solution, without thermal annealing of the active film, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increases more than 2 times compared to that for the pristine device and the PCE value also significantly increases from 1.53% to 4.44%. Thermal annealing the active film with the additive slightly increases the Voc and FF, however, Jsc decreases (∼10%) more significantly, resulting in an overall decrease of PCE from 4.44% to 4.07% (see Table 1). Changing the amount of the additive in the active film does not increase the PCE of the device further. Optimization of the devices was also performed by changing the thickness of the active film (via changing the spin-coating rate) and the results show that the optimal thickness of the active film was ca. 350 nm (including 30 nm of PEDOT:PSS film, see Table 2). The data displayed in Table 1 and 2 show clearly that 2,3-pyridinediol can simplify the fabrication process (no thermal annealing is needed) and improve the PCE (mainly in terms of Jsc and FF) of the devices. Using a simple fabrication process to achieve high device efficiency is very important progress for the practical application of low-cost BHJ-PSCs. Furthermore, in general the maximum efficiency of OPVs based on P3HT/PCBM system occurs at an active film thickness less than 200 nm. Nevertheless, we found that the optimal thickness of the P3HT/PCBM/additive film is higher than 300 nm. This unique phenomenon suggests that the 2,3-pyridinediol additive has a special impact on the organization of P3HT and PCBM, therefore, the thicker active film still has a high efficiency. In the following paragraphs we will explore how 2,3-pyridinediol affects the organization of P3HT and PCBM, and also the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of the resulting blended films.

3.2. The effect of the 2,3-pyridinediol additive on the physicochemical properties of the P3HT/PCBM blended films and EQE of the corresponding BHJ-PSC devices
UV-Visible absorption spectra of P3HT/PC61BM containing 2.0 wt% 2,3-pyridinediol with and without thermal annealing are shown in Fig. 2(a). The absorption spectra of the pristine films are also shown in Fig. 2(a) as references. All of the films were spin-coated from the respective solutions under identical conditions at a spin speed of 1600 rpm. The absorption over the visible range is due to P3HT and the intensity of the characteristic vibronic peaks at 510, 550 nm and 603 nm is an indication of the crystallinity of the P3HT domains.42,43 Qualitatively speaking, the ratio of the absorbance of the peaks at 603 nm (which has been assigned to a highly inter-chain delocalized excitation44) and 550 nm can be correlated to the local order of P3HT; the stronger 603 nm peak, the better crystallinity of P3HT.45 The λmax of the blended films with the additive is slightly red-shifted by 4 nm compared to that of the pristine films (both with and without thermal annealing) and the higher intensity of 603 nm peak indicates that the additive increases the order of the P3HT domains. Furthermore, the peak intensity at 603 nm only decreases very slightly when the blended film with the 2,3-pyridinediol additive is thermally annealed, implying that the order of the P3HT domains in the film with the additive has already formed at room temperature and that the ordered domains are thermally stable.

In order to probe the charge transfer between the P3HT donor and fullerene acceptor in the active films, photoluminescence (PL) spectra (also shown in Fig. 2(a)) were measured by exciting the blended film with 580 nm light. The PL signal from P3HT was quenched significantly by adding 2,3-pyridinediol into the blended film, indicating that a more efficient photo induced charge transfer occurred between P3HT and PCBM (or P3HT and the additive).46–49 The additive seems to either assist the formation of the ordered P3HT phase, facilitating exciton/charge migration48 or increase the interfacial area between P3HT and PC61BM (or between P3HT and 2,3-pyridinediol) for exciton dissociation by reducing the aggregation of P3HT. Moreover, the PL intensity of the active film with the additive increases upon heating, indicating that the P3HT domains aggregate, but the crystallinity (not the size of the ordered domains) of the domains remains intact, as observed in the absorption spectra. Heating the blended film with the additive also induced the growth of PC61BM domains as seen using an optical microscope (see Fig. S1 in the ESI).† Oversized P3HT and PC61BM domains that reduce the interfacial area between P3HT and PC61BM in the active layer may be the reason for the decreasing Jsc of the device. However, large P3HT and PCBM domains may also facilitate exciton/carrier transport (charge recombination decreases), therefore, FF and Voc slightly increase upon heating of the active film. Thermal annealing may also induce better contact between P3HT (or PC61BM) and the electrode, increasing the FF value.
In a BHJ-PSC, after the excitons dissociate at the donor/acceptor interface, efficient carrier transport/collection is required for a high Jsc value. EQE spectra (Fig. 2(b)) of the devices were obtained to examine the changes in the carrier transport of the active films after adding 2,3-pyridinediol. The patterns of all of the EQE curves essentially correspond to the absorption spectra of the blended films in the range of 450–650 nm, which is due to the absorption of P3HT, however, the values are significantly different for each device. The device based on the non-thermal active film with the additive achieves the highest EQE values over the entirety of the measured wavelength range. Without thermal annealing, the absorption intensity of the active film with the additive is only slightly stronger than that of the pristine film (see Fig. 2(a)). Nevertheless, the EQE values for the devices based on the active films with the additive are much higher, suggesting that better exciton/carrier transportation pathways are formed in the P3HT/PC61BM films with the 2,3-pyridinediol additive. Furthermore, upon thermal annealing (150 °C, 30 min) of the active film with the additive, the EQE of the corresponding device decreases only slightly in the whole of the visible region (400–700 nm). The absorption, luminescence and EQE data agreed with what was proposed in the previous paragraph that thermal annealing of the active film induces the aggregation of P3HT and PC61BM to form bigger domains without changing the crystallinity (not the crystal size) of the P3HT domains. Thermally induced aggregation of P3HT is beneficial for the pristine film, however, it is not necessary for the film with the additive, which forms a bicontinuous interpenetrated network of suitable size for exciton migration/dissociation and charge transport at room temperature.
The hole-only mobility of BHJ-PSCs based on P3HT/PC61BM active films with and without additive are measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method35,40,50 and the results are listed in Table 1. Without thermal annealing of the active layer, the mobility of the device based on the active film with the additive is one order of magnitude higher than that for the devices without the additive. When the active film with the additive was thermally annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, the mobility decreased, probably due to the formation of some isolated P3HT or PC61BM domains. Notably, upon thermal annealing, the mobility of the devices based on the pristine film and the film with the additive are similar, however, Jsc, FF and PCE for the device based on the active film with the additive are all higher. Therefore, the hole mobility of the active film is not a major reason for the significant improvement in Jsc of the device based on the active film with the additive.
As discussed in the preceding paragraphs and previous literature reports,51,52 the morphology of the active layer is a very important factor for determining the photovoltaic performance of BHJ-PSCs. There have been numerous investigations focused on exploring the morphology of P3HT/PCBM blends using an assortment of film processing conditions, additives and/or subsequent treatments with various physicochemical methods.53–56 Here we have used an AFM in tapping mode to simultaneously collect topographic and phase images of the active films, as shown in Fig. 3. The surface roughness obtained from the topographic images was 2.49, 2.83, 2.94, and 3.45 nm for the pristine film without thermal annealing, the pristine film with thermal treatment, the film with the additive, but without thermal annealing, and the film with the additive and thermal treatment, respectively. The surface roughness of the blended films increases upon heating and, compared to the pristine film, the surface roughness of the blended films with the additive are higher. The higher surface roughness probably arises from the better defined P3HT and PC61BM domains, which is supported by the phase images shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 3. The phase image of the pristine film without thermal annealing (Fig. 3(a)) reveals big, isolated PC61BM (dark) and P3HT (bright) domains. After thermal annealing, an interpenetrated morphology is formed (Fig. 3(b)), but the domain size of each phase is small (<15 nm). Neither the isolated domains nor the small domain size is the optimal morphology for facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport simultaneously. However, in the presence of an additive, even without thermal annealing, a beautiful bicontinuous/interpenetrated fiber-like network is formed (Fig. 3(c)). These bicontinuous nanoscale domains of P3HT and PC61BM phases are known53–57 to be a suitable morphology for charge separation and transport. Furthermore, the diameter of each domain, as estimated from the cross section of the blended film with the additive (for details, see Fig. S2, ESI†) is ca. 30 nm, which is an optimal size for exciton diffusion.58 Heating the blended film (with additive) results in an increase in the size of both the P3HT and PC61BM domains, but the interconnected fiber-like network is preserved (see Fig. 3(d)). Thermal annealing the active film with the additive leads to a few oversized domains for exciton diffusion/charge separation, therefore, Jsc of the corresponding device is decreased. Nevertheless, heating the active layer can improve Voc and FF, probably due to better wetting by the metal electrode or a structural change at the PEDOT:PSS/active layer interface.59 As a result, PCE of the device only slightly decreases after thermal annealing of the active film with the additive.

Interestingly, the phase images shown on the right hand side of Fig. 3 also reveal that the surface composition for the P3HT/PC61BM film with 2,3-pyridinediol is not the same as that for the pristine film. It seems that the surface of the pristine film is rich in P3HT (the lighter colored parts), however, the blended film with the additive has more PC61BM (the darker colored parts) molecules on the surface in both the thermally and non-thermally treated films. The vertical composition profile of the active film is also an important parameter that affects the photovoltaic performance of a BHJ-PSC. However, most studies are often limited to the film morphology. One of the few examples of a study that focuses on the composition of the active film in a vertical direction was carried out by Campoy-Quiles et al.54 They used ellipsometry to study the vertical composition profiles of P3HT/PC61BM films under variable fabrication conditions (such as thermal annealing and post solvent treatment) and found that the pristine film spin coated onto fused silica (or PEDOT:PSS coated quartz) had a composition that varied from PC61BM rich close to the substrate to P3HT rich near the free (air) surface. After thermal treatment, some of the PC61BM molecules in the film moved toward the film/air interface, therefore, the vertical composition profile changed. We have used depth profile ESCA analysis to probe the vertical composition profiles of the non-thermally treated P3HT/PC61BM films (with and without the additive) deposited onto PEDOT:PSS coated ITO and the results are shown in the middle section of Fig. 4. In the pristine film (without additive), P3HT (represented by the S atoms) is rich at the film surface/air interface and then decreases gradually towards the PEDOT:PSS coated anode and PC61BM (represented by the O atoms) increases accordingly, probably due to a strong interaction between the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS and hydrophilic PC61BM. This type of composition distribution is not good for hole transfer from P3HT to the PEDOT:PSS coated anode. In contrast, for the blended film with the additive (surprisingly, the content of the additive (represented by the N atoms) is very homogeneous throughout the whole film, therefore, the atomic ratio of O can be used to represent the content of PC61BM), the amount of P3HT increases towards the anode and PC61BM decreases accordingly, reversing the vertical distribution (see the middle section of Fig. 4). It seems that the additive interacts with both P3HT and PC61BM, changing their hydrophobicity, therefore, more P3HT moves towards the PEDOT:PSS (anode) side (or more PC61BM diffuses towards the film surface/air side) to form a better vertical composition profile for charge transport: holes to the anode via P3HT and electrons to the cathode via PC61BM. The increase in Jsc for the device based on the film with the additive may also be due to the redistribution of P3HT and PC61BM in the vertical direction of the blended film as demonstrated in the two sides of Fig. 4.

3.3. The functions of the 2,3-pyridinediol additive
The function of the solid 2,3-pyridinediol additive will be different from liquid additives previously reported in the literature.20,23–29 Most (>90%) of these liquid additive are removed19 after the active film is dried upon standing/heating, whereas 2,3-pyridinediol remains in the active film even after thermal annealing. The reversed distribution of P3HT (or PC61BM) in the vertical direction of the film and the homogeneous distribution of 2,3-pyridinediol within the blended film suggest that 2,3-pyridinediol interacts with both P3HT and PC61BM. The interaction between 2,3-pyridinediol and P3HT (or PC61BM) is supported by the following 3 pieces of evidence. Firstly, 2,3-pyridinediol is only very slightly soluble in CHCl3, nevertheless, 2,3-pyridinediol–P3HT (1:1 weight ratio) and 2,3-pyridinediol–PC61BM (1:1 weight ratio) are both soluble in CHCl3 (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Secondly, the 1H-NMR (Fig. 5. The full spectrum can be found in Fig. S4, ESI†) peak for the Hs on O in 2,3-pyridinediol shifts up-field, becoming very sharp, and the integral area also increases (this is not a general phenomenon observed in 1H-NMR for hydrogen-bonded H) when PC61BM is added. The NMR data suggest that in pure 2,3-pyridinediol there is intramolecular (or intermolecular) hydrogen bonding in 2,3-pyridinediol, therefore, the NMR signal is relatively broad. When PCBM is added, the carbonyl group from PCBM disrupts this intramolecular hydrogen-bonding in 2,3-pyridinediol via bi-dentate hydrogen-bonding (i.e., the two hydroxyl groups from 2,3-pyridinediol both interact with the carbonyl group). Bi-dentate hydrogen-bonding has the potential to be a stronger interaction than intramolecular hydrogen-bonding, therefore, the proton signal upshifts and becomes sharp. A similar phenomenon was observed in HOC–P3HT–COH and PC61BM reported by Chen et al.60 Thirdly, the surface energies of the P3HT and PC61BM films are 23.1 and 33.2 mN m−2, respectively. In contrast, the surface energy of the 2,3-pyridinediol–P3HT (1:1 weight ratio) and 2,3-pyridinediol–PC61BM (1:1 weight ratio) films are 63.8 and 50.9 mN m−2, respectively (2,3-pyridinediol is very hydrophilic, therefore, the contact angle of water on the 2,3-pyridinediol film cannot be measured). These data suggest that 2,3-pyridinediol may interact with both P3HT and PC61BM in the blended film. The significantly higher surface energy of the P3HT/2,3-pyridinediol blend may be one of the reasons that more P3HT moves to PEDOT:PSS side when P3HT/PC61BM/2,3-pyridinediol was spin-coated onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO. Considering the structures of all of the materials involved, it is reasonable to assume that the interaction between P3HT and the additive is a π–π interaction and that between PC61BM and 2,3-pyridinediol is hydrogen bonding, as shown in Fig. 6. Certainly, a π–π interaction between PC61BM and 2,3-pyridinediol cannot be totally ruled out.

3.4. Proving 2,3-pyridinediol can be a general additive in varied active components for improving various aspects of the photovoltaic performance of BHJ-PSCs
The effects of this new solid additive imply that the bicontinuous interpenetrated morphology of the active film can be formed automatically at room temperature by addition of the additive. Moreover, the 3D organization/distribution of the blended film can be manipulated by carefully selecting the functionality of the additive, thus changing the physical properties of the both components in the active film. To demonstrate the generality of using 2,3-pyridinediol as an additive in BHJ-PSCs, an ICBA acceptor61 (instead of PC61BM) or PTB7 donor6 (instead of P3HT) was used as one of the active components. The photovoltaic parameters of the devices based on P3HT/ICBA and PTB7/PC71BM active films (with and without the 2,3-pyridinediol additive) are listed in Table 3. The data in Table 3 again demonstrate that 2,3-pyridinediol is an effective additive for improving both the Jsc and FF of devices using either a high LUMO energy acceptor or a low band-gap polymer donor as one of the active components. Therefore, we believe that 2,3-pyridinediol is an all-purpose additive, which can be employed in BHJ-PSCs with a variety of active components. Interestingly, ICBA does not have functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds with 2,3-pyridinediol, but the additive still increases the photovoltaic performance of the device based on P3HT/ICBA. This result implies that a π–π interaction may also occur between the additive and ICBA or that a π–π interaction between 2,3-pyridinediol and P3HT could be the major driving force for the formation of the optimal 3D organization in P3HT/ICBA film that improves the efficiency (mainly in Jsc) of the corresponding device.

Furthermore, as mentioned before, the PTB7/PC71BM blended film is thermally sensitive even with the DIO additive. We found that the 2,3-pyridinediol additive also improves the thermal stability of the PTB7/PC71BM film. For example, the PCE of a BHJ-PSC based on PTB7/PC71BM with the DIO additive without thermal annealing is 6.62%. However, when the active film was heated at 100 °C for 30 min, the PCE of the corresponding device dropped to 4.26%, due to a significant decrease in the current density (see Table S1, ESI†). In contrast, without thermal annealing the PCE of the device using PTB7/PC71BM with 2,3-pyridinediol as an active film is 7.54%. When the PTB7/PC71BM/2,3-pyridinediol film was heated at 100 °C for 30 min, PCE of the corresponding device slightly decreased to 7.30% (only a 3% decrease. For further detail also see Table S1, ESI†). 2,3-pyridinediol is a solid with a high boiling point (Tm = 245 °C; Tb = 387 °C). It will not evaporate (the mobility is also low) during the heating or device fabrication process, therefore, the thermal stability of the active layer can be improved with this additive. 2,3-pyridinediol is also a simple organic molecule with multiple functionality (both an aromatic ring and OH group), therefore the effect of the additive on the physical properties of the active film can be well-controlled and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding BHJ-PSC is reproducible. This is the merit of using solid 2,3-pyridinediol instead of a high boiling point liquid as an additive in BHJ-PSC devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a new solid organic additive, 2,3-pyridinediol, that can be used to increase the PCE of BHJ-PSCs without the need to thermally anneal the active film. The morphology of the donor/acceptor network is critical to optimize the performance of the device. Nevertheless, the vertical distribution of the n-type and p-type materials in the active film is also a determining factor for achieving a high PCE. We found that 2,3-pyridinediol not only induces the formation of a bicontinuous interpenetrate network with an appropriate domain size, but it also regulates the vertical distribution of P3HT and PC61BM in the active film. The function of the solid 2,3-pyridinediol additive is different from other previously reported liquid additives. Liquid additives influence the domain size of n-type fullerenes and the crystallinity of p-type polymers due to their selective solubility towards fullerenes and prolonging the solvent annealing time. In contrast, 2,3-pyridinediol interacts with both active components (perhaps forming a special supra-molecular architecture, which still needs more sophisticated studies to prove), changing the polarity. Therefore, an optimal morphology was formed at room temperature and P3HT is distributed more closely to the PEDOT:PSS coated anode, while the surface (air/film interface) has more PC61BM, which facilitates charge transport. The effect of the 2,3-pyridinediol additive is not specific to these materials and can also be applied to other n-type materials such as ICBA and p-type low band-gap polymers such as PTB7 to improve the efficiency of the corresponding devices. It is also noteworthy that the thermal stability of the active layer is a very important property for long-term stability and, therefore, the practical applications of organic solar cells. The active film with the 2,3-pyridinediol additive shows good thermal stability, owing to the fact that the additive has a high boiling point (387 °C) (it may also have a strong interaction with the active components). Moreover, if the 3D organization/distribution of the active films in BHJ-PSCs can be manipulated using the interaction between the additive and active components, it is reasonable to assume that the thermodynamically unstable film morphology can be controlled by adding a specially designed additive. Certainly, much more study is needed to find the right methods. However, we believe that this result provides a new route to simplify the fabrication process of BHJ-PSCs, improve the thermal stability of the active layer and increase the PCE of the corresponding devices using an additive with specially designed functionality.
