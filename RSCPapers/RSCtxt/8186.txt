    , Accepted 13th September 2017First published on 14th September 2017AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen energy has attracted considerable attention for solving current energy and environmental crises. However, the intrinsically high electron–hole recombination and low charge mobility greatly diminish the PEC efficiency. Herein, we demonstrated that metal organic framework MIL-53(Fe) could serve as an efficient hole-transfer co-catalyst to significantly improve the PEC performance of Mo-doped BiVO4 photoanodes toward water oxidation under solar irradiation, which is much higher than that of the traditional FeOOH co-catalyst under the same conditions. More specifically, owing to the unique 3D interlinked nanochannel and confinement effect of Fe atom sites, the charge separation, hole transport at the interface, and interactions with H2O molecules have been effectively facilitated, which thus allows for enhancing PEC water oxidation properties.
Introduction
The utilization of solar energy for producing sustainable energy has been considered as a promising approach to account for the increasing global energy demands. During the past few decades, great efforts have been devoted to solar energy conversion with various strategies, such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells.1–4 Among them, PEC water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen has received particular interest owing to its great potential for practical applications. However, the exploration and fabrication of highly efficient and stable semiconductor photoanodes still remains a significant challenge.5–7 Metal oxides have been generally utilized as potential photoanodes due to their low-cost synthetic routes and higher stability compared to other semiconductors.6 Among diverse oxides, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4), with a band gap of ∼2.4 eV and a high valence band position, has attracted considerable attention in PEC water splitting.8–11 However, its higher electron–hole recombination rates and low charge transport properties greatly limit its practical applications.12–14 Therefore, great efforts have been made to improve the PEC performance of BiVO4-based photoanodes using various strategies including metal ion-doping15,16 and p-type VIII metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) oxide or (oxy)hydroxide co-catalyst deposition.17–19 However, the usual large thicknesses or dimensions of p-type VIII metal co-catalysts may block sunlight absorption and extend the hole transport distances. Moreover, most of these co-catalysts possess amorphous structures and poor conductivity, which inevitably decrease the charge separation efficiency. Thereby, the exploration of novel metal (VIII)-containing co-catalysts may further enhance the PEC performance of BiVO4 photoanodes.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of new-style organic–inorganic composite materials with flexible structures and large specific surface areas, have been widely applied in gas storage,20 heterogeneous catalysis,21 adsorption,22 photonics,23 multiferroics,24 and drug delivery.25 More recently, researchers have paid more attention to the combination of MOFs and semiconductor materials for photocatalytic applications. Among various MOFs, one Materials Institute of Lavoisier (MIL) MOF, MIL-53(Fe) with the formula Fe(OH){O2C–C6H4–CO2}, has been fabricated and extensively reported in various photocatalytic systems. For example, Basu et al.26 synthesized a Fe2O3/MIL-53(Fe) composite that showed greatly improved catalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue under both UV and visible light irradiation. Lei et al.27 fabricated a MIL-53(Fe)–graphene nanocomposite, which exhibited improved photocatalytic performance for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol under visible light and ambient conditions. However, the application of metal–organic framework MIL-53(Fe) for photoelectrochemical water splitting has been rarely reported.
In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that MIL-53(Fe) could serve as an efficient hole-transfer co-catalyst to significantly improve the PEC performance of 2% Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes toward water oxidation under solar irradiation. MIL-53(Fe) greatly increases the charge-carrier density and facilitates more efficient electron–hole separation. More specifically, the 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) photoanode shows a photocurrent of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). Moreover, its H2 generation capability is nearly 7 and 2 times higher than that of pure and FeOOH-modified Mo:BiVO4, respectively. These demonstrations clearly reveal that the modification of metal–organic frameworks could be utilized as an alternative strategy for enhancing the PEC performance of semiconductor photoanodes.
Experimental
Materials and instruments
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glasses as substrates were purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Electronic Components Co., Ltd. China. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO4, 99%), iron chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 99%), terephthalic acid (99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99%), ethyl alcohol (99.7%), bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99%), ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, 99%), ethylene glycol (EG, 99%), polyethylene glycol (PEG-600, 99%), and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6·Mo7O24·4H2O, 99%) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, without any further purification. Deionized water with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ cm was used in all reactions.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6701F, JEOL) operated at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The crystalline structure of the products was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku RINT-2000) using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. The elemental composition was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out by using a FEI Tecnai TF20 microscope operated at 200 kV. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was performed with a UV-2550 (Shimadzu) spectrometer by using BaSO4 as the reference. Evolved hydrogen gas was detected using a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu).
Preparation of nanoporous BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4 (molar fraction) photoanodes
Nanoporous BiVO4 photoanodes were fabricated by drop-casting the precursor solution onto FTO substrates.28 The preparation of the precursor solution will be shown in detail in the following discussion. At first, 1.5 mmol Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 1.5 mmol NH4VO3 were dissolved separately in 20 ml EG according to a molar ratio of Bi:V (1:1). 0.34 g PEG-600 was dissolved in 10 mL EG as a structure controlling solution. Then, according to the desired volume ratio that is Bi:V:PEG-600 = 2:2:1, these three solutions were mixed to create a yellow precursor solution. Then, 0.2 mL of the precursor solution was drop-cast onto a FTO substrate (1 × 5 cm2). The sample was dried in an oven at 150 °C for 60 min, and then annealed in a muffle furnace in air at 500 °C for 2.5 hours. Finally, a yellow BiVO4 photoanode was formed on the FTO substrate.
2% Mo:BiVO4 films were fabricated according to the above-mentioned method except that the molar ratio of Bi:V:Mo (originating from (NH4)6·Mo7O24·4H2O) is 0.98:1:0.02, and the desired volume ratio of Bi:V with Mo:PEG-600 = 2:2:1.
Preparation of MIL-53(Fe)
Typically, MIL-53(Fe) was synthesized by a microwave synthesis method with a simple procedure.29 According to this method, 4 mM FeCl3·6H2O and 2 mM terephthalic acid were dissolved in 40 ml of DMF and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The obtained solution was then transferred into a microwave reactor (MAS-II Plus, Sineo Microwave Chemistry Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) and heated at 150 °C for 30 min. The reaction was carried out under 300 W illumination during the heating process. After cooling down to room temperature, the obtained suspension was centrifuged and washed with DMF and ethanol three times. Finally, the sample was dried at 100 °C under vacuum to give the final MIL-53(Fe).
Preparation of 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) and BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) composite materials
Generally, BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4 films were prepared by the above mentioned method. The as-prepared MIL-53(Fe) powder (4 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of ethyl alcohol by ultrasonication in distilled water for 30 min to obtain the solution. The prepared BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4 films were coated on FTO with the solution by spin coating at 600 rpm for 20 s and then 2000 rpm for 10 s. After coating, the films were dried at 150 °C for 1 h.
Photoelectrochemical characterization and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production
The photoelectrochemical properties were measured in a 3-electrode system in 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. A Pt foil (3 × 2 cm2) as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and the as-prepared BiVO4, 2% Mo:BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) films as the working electrodes (with a surface area of 5 cm2) were employed, respectively. The electrochemistry measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D). Illumination through the FTO side (back-side illumination) was used under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination provided by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300C). Linear sweep voltammograms were measured under a bias voltage between 0 V and 1.6 V (vs. RHE) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Amperometric i–t curves were measured at a bias voltage of 1.0 V (vs. RHE). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were obtained at 0.6 V (vs. RHE) with a small AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz. The measured spectra were fitted with ZView software.
Photoelectrochemical H2 evolution was studied in a three-electrode cell with a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode, and a sample as the working electrode, respectively. 0.2 M Na2SO4 was used as an electrolyte after saturation with N2 gas for 30 min. Evolved H2 gas was collected and measured according to the standard H2 evolution curve as shown in Fig. S12.†
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis method of the 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) (FMBV) photoanode. Firstly, nanoporous 2% Mo:BiVO4 grown on a FTO substrate was prepared through simple coating, followed by a thermal treatment at 150 °C for 60 min and secondly at 500 °C for 2.5 hours in air. Then, the MIL-53(Fe) co-catalyst was deposited on the 2% Mo:BiVO4 samples via a simple spin-coating method. The FMBV composite photoanodes with various contents (350, 450 and 550 μl) of MIL-53(Fe) were denoted as FMBV-1, FMBV-2 and FMBV-3, respectively. Fig. 1A exhibits typical scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared MIL-53(Fe), which clearly reveal that uniform MIL-53(Fe) with an average length of 1 μm has been obtained. The high magnification SEM (inset of Fig. 1A) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1B) images distinctly demonstrate its hexagonal bipyramidal structure. The mapping images (Fig. 1B) show the existence of C, Fe, and O elements in the whole area of MIL-53(Fe). The crystalline structure as well as composition has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). In Fig. 1C, the XRD pattern of MIL-53(Fe) shows a monoclinic symmetry, which is in accordance with the crystalline MIL-53(Fe) framework reported in the literature.29Fig. 1D shows a model of the MIL-53(Fe) structure, which contains terephthalate anions and chains of Fe(III) octahedra sharing OH groups to form a three-dimensional framework with a one-dimensional pore channel system.30

Fig. 2A and B show typical SEM images of 2% Mo:BiVO4 and FMBV composite materials. The 2% Mo:BiVO4 sample (Fig. 2A) shows a worm-like structure with a size of 300–800 nm and the cross-section image is presented in Fig. S1,† indicating that MIL-53(Fe) could attach well on the surface of the 2% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode. For the FMBV composite sample (Fig. 2B), it is clearly shown that the worm-like structure of 2% Mo:BiVO4 is covered by the hexagonal bipyramidal structure with a mean length of 1 μm. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping images (Fig. 2C) clearly exhibit the existence of MIL-53(Fe) on the 2% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode. To explore the optical properties of the 2% Mo:BiVO4, MIL-53(Fe) and FMBV samples, their UV-vis absorption was measured and shown in Fig. S2,† indicating that the absorption edge of the FMBV composite material is in accordance with that of the pure 2% Mo:BiVO4, both of which have higher absorption (e.g. after 600 nm) than pure MIL-53(Fe).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of FMBV-2 and pure 2% Mo:BiVO4 have been measured to determine their crystalline structure as well as compositions, and the results are shown in Fig. 3A and other FMBV films are also exhibited in Fig. S3.† All the characteristic peaks could be indexed to monoclinic bismuth vanadate (JCPDS, No. 14-0688), except for the diffraction peaks of SnO2 from the FTO substrate. No additional peaks of MIL-53(Fe) can be observed for the FMBV photoanode, although there is an obvious coating layer on the FMBV photoanode observed in SEM (Fig. 2B). Fig. S4† shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the FMBV composite material. It clearly demonstrates the presence of Fe, C, O, Mo, Bi and V in the obtained structure, confirming the presence of MIL-53(Fe) on the 2% Mo:BiVO4 photoanode. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed as shown in Fig. 3B and Fig. S5.† The characteristic absorption peaks of the MIL-53(Fe) sample appearing at 1686, 1543, 395, 1015, and 750 cm−1 mainly originate from the vibrations of carboxylate groups, which are consistent with those of reported data in the literature.32–34 The two sharp peaks at 1543 and 1395 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric (νas(C–O)) and symmetric (νas(C–O)) vibrations of carboxyl groups, respectively, confirming the existence of a dicarboxylate linker within the sample. The peak at 750 cm−1 is ascribed to the C–H bending vibration of benzene. The 2% Mo:BiVO4 sample shows the broadening of the stretching bands in the range of 600–900 cm−1. The FMBV-2 composite material possesses the characteristic peaks of both MIL-53(Fe) and 2% Mo:BiVO4. Above all, it can be concluded that MIL-53(Fe) has been successfully constructed on the 2% Mo:BiVO4 films.

To investigate the PEC performance of the as-prepared FMBV films, systematic PEC measurements with a set of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under AM 1.5G illumination. As shown in Fig. 4A, all the samples show a negligible current density under dark conditions, suggesting that no drastic electrocatalytic water splitting occurred. The LSV performance of the MIL-53(Fe) photoanode is shown in Fig. S6,† which displays a very low negative photocurrent, indicating its p-type characteristic. For the pure BiVO4 sample, it shows a photocurrent of 0.57 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, while the photoresponse increases to 1.06 mA cm−2 at the same potential after doping with 2% Mo. After modification with the MIL-53(Fe) co-catalyst, the FMBV-2 film shows a notably enhanced photoresponse in the potential range from 0.5 to 1.3 VRHE, and a photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 is obtained at 1.23 VRHE, which is four times higher than that of the pure BiVO4 film (0.57 mA cm−2). Fig. 4B shows the amperometric i–t curves under chopped AM 1.5G illumination at a fixed bias potential of 1.0 VRHE. The FMBV-2 film exhibits the highest photocurrent density that can reach up to 1.67 mA cm−2 at 1.0 VRHE, which is significantly higher than those of pure BiVO4 (0.35 mA cm−2) and 2% Mo:BiVO4 (0.55 mA cm−2). To explore the durability of the FMBV-2 photoelectrode under constant working conditions, according to previous reports on BiVO4 in terms of stability,35–39 the stability of the photocurrent density as a function of time was measured and shown in Fig. S7.† It can be clearly seen that the FMBV-2 photoanode exhibits relatively high PEC stability during the entire test. Moreover, the PEC properties of the different contents of MIL-53(Fe) on BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4 samples were measured as shown in Fig. S8 and S9.† The FMBV-2 sample exhibits the optimum conditions for both BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4. In order to compare the effect of the co-catalysts, 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH films synthesised at different photoelectrodeposition times (10, 20 and 30 min) of 0.1 M FeSO4 were also prepared, which were denoted as 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-1, 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 and 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-3. The PEC performance of 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 is exhibited in Fig. 4 and S10.† It was found that although the 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 sample shows an enhancement in the photoresponse, the photocurrent of the FMBV-2 film is still much higher.

All the performances were measured in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination. 
To further explore the water oxidation kinetics at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed as shown in Fig. 4C. The charge transfer at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte can be proved through the semicircle arcs in the Nyquist plots. In Fig. 4C, it is clearly revealed that compared with the pure BiVO4, 2% Mo:BiVO4 and 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 films, the FMBV-2 film shows a much smaller semicircle arc at high frequency, indicating that the electrode exhibits a faster transport rate of charge carriers. The EIS results of the other FMBV films are shown in Fig. S9C,† which are in accordance with the above photoelectrochemical results (Fig. S9A†). The hydrogen evolution rate versus time plot at the Pt counter electrode for the BiVO4, 2% Mo:BiVO4, 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 and FMBV-2 films is shown in Fig. 4D, and H2 generation was detected using gas chromatography (GC). The measurement was carried out in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at an applied bias voltage (1.23 VRHE) under AM 1.5G illumination. From Fig. 4D, the amount of H2 is linearly related to the reaction time during the H2 production process, and the FMBV-2 film shows the highest amount of H2 evolution (34.7 μmol) compared to BiVO4 (0.35 μmol), 2% Mo:BiVO4 (5.1 μmol) and 2% Mo:BiVO4/FeOOH-2 (17.07 μmol) films, indicating the unexceptionable reduction power of the photogenerated electrons in the FMBV-2 photoelectrode. What's more, the H2 and O2 evolution in PEC water splitting over the FMBV-2 photoanode was performed using on-line gas chromatography equipment, and the result is shown in Fig. S11.† It can be clearly seen that the H2 and O2 evolution volumes linearly increased with prolonged light irradiation time up to 2 h and the stoichiometric ratio of the H2 and O2 volumes is approximately kept at 2:1, indicating that stable PEC water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen gas has been achieved over the FMBV-2 photoanode.
According to the above results, we propose a possible mechanism for the improved charge separation of the 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) composite material, as shown in Scheme 2. Non-doped BiVO4, due to its poor charge transport properties, has a poor water oxidation efficiency. This issue could be effectively addressed via doping with Mo6+, W6+, phosphate species, etc. According to the studies reported,32 Mo-doped BiVO4 did not affect the indirect nature of the electronic band gap, and the reason for the improved PEC efficiency of Mo:BiVO4 comes from the increasing charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, it can be concluded from theoretical calculations that Mo6+ and W6+ substituted at the V5+ site could enhance the n-type doping of BiVO4,40 and Mott–Schottky experiments further confirm the increase in carrier density.41 In this study, under illumination, 2% Mo:BiVO4 with a narrow band gap energy (2.4 eV, according to BiVO4) could be easily excited, inducing the generation of photoelectrons and holes.42 The electrons from 2% Mo:BiVO4 are photoexcited from the valence band to the conduction band, and then transported to the conductive substrate. Meanwhile, the holes are transferred to MIL-53(Fe). Owing to the Fe–OH groups linking with terephthalate anions and trans chains, MIL-53(Fe) could quickly transfer the hole to the electrolyte from 2% Mo:BiVO4. The formed junction between 2% Mo:BiVO4 and MIL-53(Fe) in the composite material could thus further prevent the recombination of photoelectrons and holes. Thereby, the photoinduced electron–hole pairs could be effectively separated and thus enhance the photoconversion efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated for the first time a facile and simple spin-coating process for the fabrication of a 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) composite material. The PEC performance of the 2% Mo:BiVO4–MIL-53(Fe) composite materials has been greatly improved compared with that of pure 2% Mo:BiVO4 under AM 1.5G illumination. The iron-based MIL-53(Fe) metal–organic framework exhibits a strong capability toward the separation of electrons–holes of 2% Mo:BiVO4 to realize a highly efficient photoelectric activity. This work provides a novel insight into using MOFs as co-catalysts in PEC water oxidation via reasonable designs, which may be applied for constructing more advanced MOF-based catalysts for solar photoelectric conversion.
