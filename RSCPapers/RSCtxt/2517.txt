The kinetic features of photo-induced charges transfer properties of samples have been discussed by surface photovoltage spectrum (SPS) and transient photovoltage (TPV) techniques in detail. The Bi2WO6 with hierarchical clew-like structure possessed the highest efficiency of electron-hole separation and the lowest recombination rate of photo-induced charges, resulting in the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Orange-II under the visible light (λ > 420 nm) illumination.

1. Introduction
The preparation of hierarchical architectures by assembling nanomaterials with anisotropic structures has attracted considerable attention in recent years.1–5 Owing to the dependence of their interesting physical and chemical properties on size, shape, orientation, and dimensionality, hierarchical architectures are considered to have many potential applications, such as solar energy conversion, efficient catalysts, magnetic materials, and wettability, etc.6–9 So far, several methods have been reported for the preparation of hierarchical architectures,10–13 and hydrothermal treatment is one of the simplest methods because of its easily tunable preparation condition, for instance, temperature, time, and addition of a template and/or a surfactant.
As an important material in the field of electronic and optical, bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6), one of the simplest members of the Aurivillius oxide family, possesses excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. Hydrothermal preparations of Bi2WO6 with hierarchical architectures have been reported by several research groups over the past few years.13–21 Wang and co-workers reported the preparation of flower-like Bi2WO6 superstructure without using any surfactant and template.15 In an aqueous solution with low pH value, Amano et al. and Wang et al. successfully prepared flake-ball Bi2WO6 microspheres.17,20 Also several research groups had synthesized hierarchical hollow Bi2WO6 microspheres in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP).14,16,18 Qian and co-workers reported the hydrothermal synthesis of Bi2WO6 microspheres by inorganic salt-assisted method.21 However, further researches on the improvement of Bi2WO6 photocatalytic activity are still needed in developing facile, economical, and effective prepared method. In this work, we developed for the first time a method for the preparation of hierarchical Bi2WO6 spheres by simply adjusting the volume ratio of H2O/EG mixed solution in a hydrothermal reaction. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the crystal growth mechanism.
It is well known that the photo-induced charge transfer properties of materials have important influences on their photocatalytic activity. The surface photovoltage (SPS) method is a well-established nondestructive technique for the characterization of semiconductors, which has been successfully employed in the study of charge transfer properties in photo-induced surface interactions,22dye-sensitized processes,23 as well as photocatalysis.24 This method has been shown in studying the photo-induced charge transfer properties of ZnO nanocrystals,25Fe2O3 nanorods array,26 and TiO2 powder.27 And the transient photovoltage (TPV) technique is another promising method for the investigation of dynamic properties of photo-induced charge carriers.28 This technique could be directly utilized to obtain information of the behavior of photo-induced charge carriers in the system, including the generation, separation and recombination of the photogenerated charges. An outstanding example is Fe2O3/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts, TPV was used to investigate the dynamic process of separation and transport of photo-induced charge carriers.29
In this work, Bi2WO6 with different morphologies can be obtained by simply adjusting the volume ratio of H2O/EG in the mixed solution. At a proper volume ratio, the 3D hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6 structures can be obtained. And the formation mechanism of clew-like structure was discussed. We demonstrated that the photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6 not only depended on its morphology, but also relied on the charge transfer properties. The photo-induced charge carrier separation and transfer mechanism of as-synthesized samples with different morphology were studied by means of SPS and TPV. The photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6 samples were evaluated by oxidative decomposition of Orange-II under the visible light (λ > 420 nm) illumination. SPS and TPV demonstrate that clew-like structure has the highest efficiency of electron-hole separation and the lowest recombination rate. It is also found that the clew-like Bi2WO6 shows the highest photocatalytic activity among Bi2WO6 samples with different morphology.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, the aqueous solution which marked as solution A was first prepared by dissolving Na2WO4·2H2O (1.25 mmol) in 40 mL deionized water. At the same time, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (2.5 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL ethylene glycol (EG) under vigorous stirring, and the resultant solution was marked as solution B. When solution A and B were clear, two solutions were mixed and stirred for 2 h until it became homogeneous. Then the homogeneous suspension was sealed into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, maintained at 180 °C for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The precipitate was collected by centrifugally separating and washing with ethanol and deionized water for several times, and finally dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 4 h. For the purpose of comparison, other samples were also prepared by adjusting the volume ratio of the H2O/EG. The detailed reaction parameters and corresponding results are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Characterization
The phase of as-synthesized products was characterized by X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) with a Rigaku D/Max-22550 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of samples were obtained by field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM; FEI Company), transmission electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM; TECNAIG2 FEI company), respectively. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-3600 (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer. The specific surface area was analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from Nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2020.
2.3. 
          SPS and TPV measurement
The SPS measurement system is made by a lab-made instrument,25 which is made up of a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a photovoltaic cell, and a computer. Monochromatic light is provided by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global xenon lamp power) though a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, No.09010, Zolix). The construct of the photovoltaic cell is a sandwich-like structure of ITO-sample-ITO. The TPV measurement was carried out on a home-made instrument.28 The samples were excited with a laser radiation pulse (wavelength of 355 nm and pulse width of 5 ns) from a third-harmonic Nd:YAG laser (Polaris II, New Wave Research, Inc.). The TPV signal was recorded by a 500 MHz digital phosphor oscilloscope (TDS 5054, Tektronix). The SPS and TPV measurements were finished in air atmosphere at room temperature.
2.4. Photocatalytic decomposition of Orange-II
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of Orange-II under visible light irradiation using a 500 W Xe arc lamp with a UV cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm). Powder photocatalyst (20 mg) was dispersed into 20 mL of Orange-II solution (10 mg L−1). Before illumination, the suspensions were vigorously stirred in dark for 1 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption-desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst powder and Orange-II. Then the solution was exposed to visible light irradiation under magnetic stirring. At certain intervals, 0.8 mL suspension was taken from the reaction cell and separated by a centrifugal machine during the process. At last the UV-vis spectra of the centrifuged solution were recorded using a Maya2000-Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics). The value of COD was based on the standard method of potassium dichromate (GB-11914-89), measured with COD analyzer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and morphology of the clew-like Bi2WO6

          Bi2WO6 samples were prepared by hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for 24 h. A typical XRD pattern of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 is shown in Fig. 1. All of the diffraction peaks can be clearly indexed to the pure orthorhombic phase of Bi2WO6 with lattice constants a = 5.456, b = 5.436, and c = 16.426 Å (JPCDS card no. 73–1126). Moreover, the strong and sharp diffraction peaks in the pattern show that the as-synthesized product is in highly crystallinity. XRD patterns of Bi2WO6 prepared at different volume ratio of H2O/EG are shown in Figure S1 in Supporting Information†. The shape of diffraction peaks is similar and the intensities increase slightly with the decrease of EG content from BiWO-1 to BiWO-6.

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of as-synthesized Bi2WO6. Low-magnification FESEM images in Fig. 2a show that the sample consists of a large quantity of microspheres, indicating that Bi2WO6 microspheres can be prepared on a large scale by this facile method. High magnification FESEM images (Fig. 2b and c) further reveal that these microspheres are in a clew-like structure with a diameter of 1.0–1.5 μm. The exterior surfaces of microspheres are rough and each clew is actually composed of many crisscrossing nanosheets. Fig. 2d shows the TEM image of an individual clew-like microsphere. It also can be seen from the TEM image that the microsphere consists of many interlaced nanosheets. The faint light color in the central section indicates that the clew-like Bi2WO6 microspheres have dense central regions. Fig. 2e is the HRTEM image taken from the edge of the clew-like Bi2WO6, which shows several layers of nanosheets. On the top layer, the spacing of the lattice is 0.315 nm, which is consistent with the spacing of (113) planes of orthorhombic Bi2WO6. Furthermore, the regular and clear diffraction spot array in the FFT pattern (an inset in Fig. 2e) demonstrates the single-crystal nature of original nanosheets.

3.2. Morphological evolution of Bi2WO6
To understand the growth mechanism of the clew-like Bi2WO6, the products were prepared at different aging time at 180 °C. The FESEM images of the samples synthesized at different reaction time intervals are shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding XRD patterns of the time-dependent evolution of Bi2WO6 samples are shown in Figure S2†. In the initial stage, the resulting products are irregular amorphous nanosized particles (Fig. 3a, Figure S2†). After hydrothermal treatment of 1 h, some aggregations built by nanoparticles appear (Fig. 3b). After 3 h, aggregations are transformed into incomplete clew-like Bi2WO6 microspheres (Fig. 3c, Figure S2†). When the reaction time is prolonged from 6 to 24 h, microspheres become larger and plumpish (Fig. 3d–f). Most of the obtained products are uniform, compact and clew-like microspheres. Figure S2† shows that the intensities of diffraction peaks increase with the increase of reaction time, which implies that the crystalline structure of Bi2WO6 is improved.

3.3. Formation mechanism of hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6
Base on the above experiment results, the possible reactions involved in the synthesis process can be described following:
At first, when NaWO4·2H2O aqueous solution smoothly blended with Bi(NO3)3·5H2O along with EG, the irregular nanoparticles formed. In this stage, EG coordinates with metal ions to produce alkoxide and decrease the concentration of free Bi3+ ions.21 As a result, the whole reaction is distinctly slowed down, resulting in the separation of nucleation and growth. Meanwhile, Bi2WO6 nanoparticles are produced at a relatively slow rate and tend to assemble into sub micro-scaled solid spheres driven by reducing the surface energy of nanoparticles,30 as shown in Fig. 3b. In addition, there may be many free EG molecules absorbed on the surface of the micro-scaled solid spheres, which provide many high-energy nucleation sites for further growth.31 With prolonged hydrothermal treatment time, the crystallization of Bi2WO6 begins from these nucleation sites. Meanwhile, these nanoparticles prefer to grow into plate-like structure viaOstwald ripening mechanism because of the high intrinsic anisotropic nature of Bi2WO6,32 as shown in Fig. 3c. Then these nanocrystals may grow gradually from the outer side of the aggregates toward the inside, which leads to the formation of dense center structure, as shown in Fig. 3d. In a further crystallization process, the free EG molecules could preferentially adsorb on the primary nanoplates and function as potential crystal face inhibitors in the system, which is beneficial for the formation of oriented nucleation and further leads to the construction of a hierarchical clew-like structure.33 It is evident to conclude that the formation of hierarchical clew-like microspheres in the result of EG-induced agglomeration and the oriented growth follow the Ostwald ripening mechanism. Figure S4 in Supporting Information† shows a schematic of formation mechanism of hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6.
3.4. Effects of the volume ratio of H2O/EG
In order to investigate the role of EG on the formation of hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6 microspheres, controlled experiments of different volume ratios of H2O/EG were carried out in the solution. As shown in Fig. 4, only a regular clew-like sample was obtained at the volume ratio (1:1) of H2O/EG (Fig. 4d). When the volume ratio (1:0.67) solution was controlled in an experiment, clew-like microspheres and flakes were observed (Fig. 4e). If volume ratios are set to other parameters, only nanoplates were obtained (Fig. 4a, b, c, and f). These facts indicate that similar hierarchical microspheres can only be obtained in the condition of the approximate volume ratio (1:1) of the H2O/EG. In other words, EG plays an important role in the formation of hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6. This conclusion is also proved by Figure S3†. Similar clew-like microspheres can be obtained as well when the experimental parameter was set at the volume ratio (1:1.2) and (1:0.8). It is obvious that the amounts of EG in the solution significantly affect the shape and size of the as-synthesized samples. It is always necessary to further understand their growth process.

3.5. Photovoltaic properties

Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of the different morphologies of as-synthesized Bi2WO6. According to the spectra, the steep shape of the spectra indicates that the absorption is due to the band gap transition.34 The onset of absorption edge for Bi2WO6 samples is around 450 nm, which corresponds with the optical band gap absorption reported in previous literatures.17 The band edge and band gap of the samples calculated by the equation: band gap (EG) = hc/λ, where EG is the band-gap energy (eV), h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light (m s−1), and λ is the wavelength (nm),35 as recorded in Table 1. The photo absorption onset wavelengths of the clew-like Bi2WO6 (BiWO-4) shifts to a longer wavelength compared with that of nanoplates (BiWO-1). The band gap of the clew-like Bi2WO6 is the smallest 2.67 eV.

Fig. 6 shows the normalized SPS of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 with different morphologies. Photovoltage responses are observed in the region of 300–470 nm due to the band gap transition, which implies the possibility of high photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants over Bi2WO6 under visible-light irradiation. An interesting phenomenon can be seen in Fig. 6. The hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6 (BiWO-4) has a distinct red shift in photovoltage response compared with that of plate-like Bi2WO6 (BiWO-1and BiWO-3), which is similar with UV-vis DRS. In photocatalytic experiment, the high photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 may be associated with the efficient utilization of visible light. And thus it is predicted that 3D hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6 may possess the highest photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.

To further explore the photo-induced charge transfer behavior, the transient photovoltage (TPV) was measured. TPV of the as-synthesized Bi2WO6 in Fig. 7 is displayed on a logarithmic time scale, three features can be seen: (1) The TPV of Bi2WO6 have positive signs (photo-induced electrons move toward the bulk and photo-induced holes move toward the surface), which is a typical for the photovoltage signal in n-type semiconductors.36 (2) The order of the photovoltage amplitude is BiWO-4 > BiWO-5 > BiWO-3 > BiWO-1, suggesting clew-like structure is important for the efficient of charge separation. (3) Two peaks can be observed in the TPV plot, the peak at time less than 10−6 s and the peak at time longer than 10−5 s, respectively. At time less than 10−6 s, the TPV signal rises with the laser pulse, which is a typical feature of the surface photovoltage when charge carriers are separated in the electric field of the surface space-charge region.37 At time longer than 10−6 s, the TPV signal of as-synthesized Bi2WO6 is strongly retarded in time, which is typical for diffusion photovoltage with a higher diffusion coefficient for excess electrons than for excess holes.38,39 The time of the peak position (tpeak) of the TPV can give information about the retardation time in the case of diffusion photovoltage.36

The larger the value of tpeak is, the lower recombination rate of electron-hole pairs will be, which means that photo-induced charges will have more time to participate in the photocatalytic reaction before recombination. As shown in Fig. 7, the order of tpeak is BiWO-4 ≈ BiWO-3 ≈ BiWO-1 > BiWO-5, which suggest that the clew-like structure can decrease the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs. Based on the above results, it can be demonstrated that the 3D hierarchical clew-like Bi2WO6 can promote the separation efficiency of the electron-hole pairs and inhibit the recombination of excess charge carries, which are beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Here, according to the test results of BET specific surface area of samples (shown in Table 1), all samples have the similar BET specific surface area. Thus, the influence of BET in photocatalytic activities is ignored.
3.6. Photocatalytic activity

Fig. 8 shows the time course of Orange-II degradation under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). The blank experiment shows that the degradation of Orange-II under visible light irradiation is negligible and the dark experiment demonstrates that almost no Orange-II degradation occurs after the adsorption-desorption equilibrium (shown in Fig. 8). The Orange-II photodegradation over the Bi2WO6 catalysts is fitted for pseudo-first-order kinetics.40,41 In Fig. 8, the sample of BiWO-4 shows excellent photocatalytic activity with a rate constant kf of 0.0042 min−1, which raises 3.8 times compared with that BiWO-1(kc = 0.0011 min−1). In addition, it is shown that the adsorption of Orange-II from aqueous solution on catalysts in dark BiWO-1, BiWO-3, BiWO-4, and BiWO-5 are 10%, 18%, 13%, and 13%, respectively. Adsorption data of the samples is similar, which is consistent with their similar BET specific surface area. The clew-like Bi2WO6 (BiWO-4) exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity over other samples with other morphologies. Although the BET specific surface area of Bi2WO6 photocatalysts is similar, their photocatalytic activities are different, implying that photo-induced charge transfer properties of Bi2WO6 also have a great influence on photocatalytic activity. Besides, Table S1† shows the photocatalytic performance of samples and the COD removal efficiency during the Orange-II photodegradation process of samples under UV light, and the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6 samples had also been carried out using simulate solar light in Figure S5 in Supporting Information†. In these photodegradation experiments, similar results can be obtained: the order of rate of degradation is BiWO-4 > BiWO-5 > BiWO-3 > BiWO-1. This result is consistent with the results of SPS and TPV. Table S1† shows that there was a substantial decrease of the COD of the solution after 80 min irradiation. The COD removal efficiency of the clew-like Bi2WO6 (BiWO-4) is the highest. However, the COD removal efficiency is lower than that of the percent degradation of Orange-II recorded by UV-vis spectra, which is due to the production of uncolored products during the photodegradation of Orange-II.35 Based on the above results, we suggest that the high activity of the clew-like structure Bi2WO6 is ascribed to a narrower bandgap (2.67 eV) for the efficient utilization of visible light; the homogeneous clew-like structure can promote the separation of the electron-hole pairs and inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, which make the more time the photo-induced charges can get to participate in the subsequent photocatalytic reactions before they recombine.

(a) the blank experiment (without catalyst), (b) the dark experiment (with clew-like Bi2WO6), (c) BiWO-1, (d) BiWO-3, (e) BiWO-5, (f) BiWO-4. 
To evalute the stability of the photocatalytic performance of the clew-like Bi2WO6, which is an important factor in practical application, the circulating runs in the photodegaradation of Orange-II under visible light (λ > 420 nm) were recorded in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 9, the photocatalytic activity of clew-like BiWO6 does not exhibit any significant loss after five recycles for the photodegradation of Orange-II, which implies that the clew-like Bi2WO6 have high stability. This fact demonstrate the clew-like Bi2WO6 do not photocorrode during the photocatalytic oxidation of the pollutant molecules. Up to now, high photocatalytic performance of Bi2WO6 have been studied by many researchers.18–21 Although photocatalytic activity of clew-like Bi2WO6 is not the highest, we have the confidence to enhance further their catalytic activity in future work when we can understand their photo-induced charge transfer properties by means of SPS and TPV.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized 3D Bi2WO6 hierarchical clew-like microspheres with smaller size in the volume of EG/H2O (1:1). EG have important roles in synthetic reaction. The clew-like structure Bi2WO6 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Orange-II under visible light. It is because that the clew-like structure can promote efficient separation of the photo-induced electron-hole pairs and inhibit recombination of excess charge carries, which can be explained by SPS and TPV experiment. In addition, the clew-like Bi2WO6 have high stability. It is expected that this kind of 3D hierarchical clew-like structure Bi2WO6 could be exploited in applications like solar energy conversion, oxidative decomposition of organic compounds, water purification, etc.
