    , Accepted 21st December 2015First published on 21st December 2015AbstractA novel electrolysis approach for hydrogen evolution directly from native biomasses, such as cellulose, lignin and even wood and grass powders, to hydrogen at low temperature is presented. Using aqueous polyoxometalate (POM) as a catalyst at the anode, the raw biomass is oxidized and electrons are transferred to POM molecules by heating or light-irradiation. Protons from biomass diffuse to the cathode and are reduced to hydrogen. The electric energy consumption could be as low as 0.69 kW h per normal cubic meter of H2 (Nm−3 H2) at 0.2 A cm−2, which is only 16.7% of the energy consumed for the reported water electrolysis. Unlike the traditional electrolysis of alcohols, a noble-metal catalyst is not required at the anode.

Broader context
Biomass is a sustainable source for hydrogen production. Although thermochemical approach (pyrolysis and gasification) has been practically applied to produce hydrogen, the process requires high temperature and expensive catalysts. The presence of mixture gases in the hydrogen product is another problem. Biological (biophotolysis, water–gas shift reaction and fermentation) processes can produce hydrogen from biomasses, but their efficiency is low. Electrolysis technology can produce pure hydrogen at low temperature, but the current technology cannot utilize polymeric biomass directly. Furthermore, the noble metal catalysts used in the current electrolysis process are easily poisoned by contaminants existing in raw biomasses. Herein, we report an electrolysis approach for directly producing hydrogen from almost all native biomasses by using polyoxometalate (POM) solution as both a catalyst and charge carriers. The catalytic redox reaction occurs in the solution but not on the anode surface. As a result, a noble metal is no longer needed for the anode. The POM catalyst is robust and tolerant to most organic and inorganic contaminants. Therefore, chemical pretreatment is not necessary for native biomasses. The electrolysis energy consumption is very low, which is only about 16.7% of the energy consumption of electrolysis of water.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and also the cleanest fuel on Earth.1,2 Because hydrogen has the highest energy density of all fuels (143 kJ kg−1), it is suggested that 1 kg of hydrogen can effectively replace 2.63 kg of gasoline.3 Hydrogen combustion emits only water vapor without carbon emissions. However, 96% of the global demand for hydrogen is currently produced from petroleum reforming and coal gasification.3 Because biomass is one of few currently available renewable energy sources, a biomass based route for sustainable hydrogen generation is highly attractive.4
Hydrogen production from biomasses includes a variety of developing technologies including thermo-conversion, photoelectrochemical conversion, fermentation, and electrolysis.5 Biomass thermo-conversion (e.g., gasification, pyrolysis and water/steam treatment etc.) presents a possible large-scale hydrogen production route from agricultural or forestry residues,3 but there are also some technical barriers including low heat efficiency, poor catalyst durability and impurities in the product etc.6 The photoelectrochemical (PEC) process and fermentation are promising approaches for hydrogen production from biomasses and derivatives.7,8 However, the low hydrogen generation rate of the PEC process and fermentation has still not been overcome yet so they are difficult to be practically adopted.6 The electrolysis process provides a quick and convenient approach to produce pure hydrogen. Comparing to water electrolysis, biomass electrolysis generates hydrogen by substituting oxidation of biomass-derived fuels at the anode for the oxygen revolution reaction, which can significantly reduce the electric energy consumption required for hydrogen production.
Electrolysis of renewable biomass for producing hydrogen can be realized by two common technologies: a proton exchange membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC) and a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC).9 Recently, the performance of PEMEC was highly improved using nanostructured noble-metal catalysts on the anode.10 However, several issues still exist with the current technologies. The current PEMECs are limited to a few biomass-derived alcohols, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol. Native polymeric biomasses like starch, cellulose and wood-powder have not been directly used in PEMECs up to now because the noble-metal based catalysts cannot effectively catalyse the conversion reaction of polymeric biomass molecules at low temperature. Even for ethanol, the simplest C–C bond alcohol, it could be electronically oxidized to acetic acid (−4e) in the PEMEC, which means a very low hydrogen mole yield can be achieved. Completely oxidizing of 1 mol ethanol (−12e) could produce 6 mol hydrogen; otherwise only 1/3 (2 mol) hydrogen could be obtained when it ended at the product of acetic acid. The performance deterioration also occurs because the noble-metal catalyst based anode is sensitive to some of intermediates such as CO, some sulphur compounds and other impurities formed during the reaction. Moreover, as alkaline mediation is used in a common PEMEC, NaOH is also consumed during the electrolysis process because organic acids are generated as the oxidation products. The alkaline mediation process adds to the cost of hydrogen production as well. Even though the microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) can use different types of substrates ranging from organic acids to alcohols, microorganisms in the MEC cannot directly utilize lignocellulosic biomass, an abundant renewable resource in the nature.11,12 It has to be fermented firstly to convert to low-molecular-weight compounds or monosaccharides. In addition, the slow hydrogen production rate and the limited lifetime hinder their application. Therefore, highly efficient hydrogen production directly from biomass is a valuable research objective but with great challenges.
Recently, we reported a direct biomass fuel cell that uses polyoxometalates (POMs) as the catalyst to realize the biomass-to-electricity conversion at low temperature.13,14 Polyoxometalates are water-soluble molecular metal-oxide clusters that have been used in photocatalytic water splitting.15,16 In some advanced research studies, POMs were used as the electron-coupled-proton buffer in water electrolysis for decoupling hydrogen and oxygen evolution.17,18 Herein, we present a novel chemical-electrolysis conversion (CEC) process utilizing polyoxometalates as both a catalyst and an electron–proton carrier for hydrogen generation directly from native biomasses. In this process, raw biomass can be effectively decomposed via a chemical conversion by aqueous POM at low temperature and followed by electrolysis with very low electric energy input to generate hydrogen.
The chemical-electrolysis conversion process was conducted in a common PEMEC, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A. The proton exchange membrane was sandwiched between a simple graphite-felt anode without coating any catalyst and a carbon cathode coated with a Pt black catalyst (4 mg cm−2) for hydrogen evolution (experimental set-up and details of the graphite-felt anode are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S1). Before the electrolysis, biomass was mixed with the solution of phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40, noted as PMo12) that is one of the typical POMs (shown in Fig. 1 bottom (B)). Under either sunlight irradiation or direct heating, the biomass–PMo12 mixture gradually changed the colour from initial yellow to dark blue (shown in Fig. 1, bottom (C)), indicating the reduction of POM and the oxidation of biomass. The electrolysis carried out by applying an electric potential to the anode and the cathode (shown in Fig. 1A). At the same time, the obtained biomass–POM solution was pumped into the anode and the phosphoric acid aqueous solution (1 mol l−1) was pumped into the cathode side of the electrolysis cell. During the electrolysis, the reduced POM was gradually electro-oxidized, and turned back to yellow; hydrogen bubbles released from the cathode outlet, and was collected. When the reduced POM blue completely turned to yellow at the anode side (shown in Fig. 1D), a chemical-electrolysis conversion cycle was completed. Experimentally, the biomass–POM solution could be irradiated or heated in situ with the circulation in the electrolyzer to generate hydrogen.

The anode is a simple graphite-felt electrode; the cathode is a gas-diffusion electrode loaded with the Pt black catalyst (4 mg cm−2). (B) Solution of POM–biomass before heating or light irradiation. (C) The colour change of biomass–POM mixture after heating. (D) The biomass–POM solution after the electrolysis for hydrogen production. 
In order to understand the biomass–POM hydrolysis process, a control test was performed first with only phosphoric acid (1 mol l−1) pumped through both the anode and cathode sides. As expected and shown in Fig. 2A, there is no obvious current even when the applied potential was 1.1 V because the applied potential is lower than the standard potential of water electrolysis (1.23 V), and the oxygen evolution reaction has a large over-potential over the graphite electrode in phosphoric acid. This was further confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry of the graphite electrode in the H3PO4 solution and the I–V curve in an extended applied potential range (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). When the electron donor, for example, glucose, was introduced into the H3PO4 solution, it can be observed that the electrolysis current was still very low (Fig. 2A). This is reasonable because no noble-metal catalyst was loaded on the carbon anode. However, when the simply heated blue biomass–PMo12 solution was pumped through the anode, electrolysis current sharply increased after applied potential was increased over 0.6 V (Fig. 2A), and hydrogen gas bubbles were clearly observed at the cathode side. Current density up to 0.45 A cm−2 was measured at applied potential 1.0 V by the electrolyzing of native starch powders. This is much higher than the value of electrochemical conversion of ethanol alcohol in the common PEMEC (0.2 A cm−2 at applied potential 1.0 V),19,20 even though no noble-metal catalyst was used on the anode in our study. After 2 hours electrolysis, the solution colour turned back to yellow (Fig. 1. bottom (D)), indicating the POM anions were oxidized to their original state.

The cathode side is pumped with 1 mol l−1 H3PO4 solution. (C) Polarization curves of SiW12 (0.3 mol l−1) and alcohols (2 mol l−1) pre-irradiated under UV-light (irradiation density 60 mW cm−2; irradiation area 15.8 cm2; solution volume 10 ml) at room temperature for 1 hours. (D) Polarization curves of the solution pre-irradiated under sunlight (irradiation density 6.16 mW cm−2; irradiation area 15.8 cm2; solution volume 10 ml) for 6 hours. Values of reduction degree (m) of PMo12 and SiW12 in different solutions are noted. The electrolysis temperature is 80 °C. 
Not only the native starch powder but also several other types of biomasses, including glucose, lignin suspension, cellulose powders, switchgrass, poplar wood powder and fresh algae, were directly used for hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 2A and B. It should be noted that the native biomasses used in this study were only mechanical grounded without any chemical pre-treatment. The biomass powders actually were particle suspensions in the POM solution at the beginning, and they gradually dissolved after reacting with PMo12 at an elevated temperature (90–100 °C). These experiments demonstrate, for the first time, the successful conversion of raw biomasses into hydrogen at low temperature.
Besides the heating induced redox reaction, light can also be used to induce the redox reaction between POM and biomass because POM is a photosensitive catalyst.21,22 Therefore, the light-drive electrolysis of biomass was also performed in this study by mixing PMo12 and bio-derived alcohols such as glycerol and glucose under irradiation of AM-1.5 solar simulator (experimental conditions are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). This process was promoted by using silicotungstic acid (H4SiW12O40 noted as SiW12) that has the strong photocatalytic ability under short-wavelength light irradiation. Fig. 2C shows the electric performance by using bio-alcohol–SiW12 mixture after UV-irradiation. The results indicated that even at 0.1 V applied potential, about 50 mA cm−2 electrolysis current and significant hydrogen evolution at the cathode were observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the lowest electrolysis voltage that shows the remarkable hydrogen generation in the literature. The electric energy consumption drops to 0.69 kW h Nm−3 H2 at a current density of 0.2 A cm−2. Considering the reported alkaline water electrolysis, 1.8 V potential and the energy of 4.3 kW h Nm−3 H2 were generally required,23 which suggests 83.3% electric energy could be saved by using the light-induced alcohol–SiW12 solution. Even for the reported methanol or ethanol–water electrolysis, the energy consumption is usually in the range of 1.5–2.0 kW h Nm−3 H2,20,24 which is still ∼2.8 times higher than our approach (Table 1). Not only UV light but also sunlight could induce electron transfer from biomass to SiW12. As shown in Fig. 2D, sunlight irradiated biomass–SiW12 solutions have similar electric performance as UV irradiation, which depends actually on the reduction degree of the POM. Because solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source, using the solar-induced redox reaction of native biomasses in the presence of POM could provide a practical route to significantly reduce the cost and energy consumption in hydrogen production.
As shown in Fig. 2, it seems that the onset potential (the point at which the electrolysis current suddenly increases) depends on the type of biomass. For example, glucose and starch solutions have small onset potentials because glucose and starch are easily oxidized and hydrolysed by POM. But cellulose and lignin have opposite situations due to the rigid crystalline structure of cellulose and achromatic rings in lignin. However, the actual reason affecting the onset potential is the reduce degree of the POM after reacting with biomass under either heating or light irradiation. Even under the same experimental conditions, different biomasses could result in different reduction degree of POM because the redox reaction between biomass and POM depends on the chemical structure of biomass. The reduction degree (noted as m, shown in Fig. 2) of POM was defined as the average number of electrons (in moles) that were transferred from the biomass to one mole of the POM anion. The absorbance at the wavelength of 700 nm of the reduced POM was utilized for the determination of reduction degree, because the linear relationship between the absorbance at 700 nm and reduction degree was demonstrated (shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The reduction degree of POM is our concern in electrolysis because the actual electric oxidation on the anode is POM anions rather than biomass molecules (demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry shown in Fig. S5, ESI†). The higher reduction degree the POM has, the lower onset potential is required in the electrolysis, and more electrolysis energy could be saved. This mechanism is different from noble metal catalyzed alcohol electrolysis in which the redox reaction of alcohol molecules occurs on the Pt loaded anode surface rather than in the solution. Therefore, the electric performance in this study not directly related to the chemistry of biomass although biomass chemistry is one of the important factors affecting the biomass–POM reaction kinetics.

In order to test the stability of the hydrogen evolution using the biomass–POM electrolysis device, continuous tests running at constant-current densities of 50, 100 and 200 mA cm−2 were performed under the conditions of both heating (by feeding with glucose–PMo12 solution) and UV-irradiation (by feeding with glucose–SiW12 solution). At the same time, the produced H2 gas was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, the potential was very stable during the process of 24 ml H2 generation. The steady performance depends on a stable electron capturing from biomass by POM. The redox reaction rates between different types of biomasses and POM were determined under heating, UV and actual sunlight irradiation (shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). Actually, the biomass–POM reaction rate strongly relies on the conditions such as irradiation intensity, irradiation area, temperature and concentration, but results show that the reaction rates are sufficient for the continuous hydrogen production. Theoretical yield of H2 gas during the constant-current electrolysis was calculated according to Faraday's laws (shown in Fig. 3B and D). The average Faraday efficiency (ratio of measured to theoretical yield of H2) is 96.74%, which indicates that it has a high efficient electrons transfer in the overall process from biomass to H2.

It is of interest to know what the final products in the system are and how much hydrogen can be released from the biomasses. The final products depend on the chemistry of the biomass, the reaction temperature and time, the type of POM and its concentration. Although the actual redox reactions and the reaction products are complicated, it was confirmed in this study that the high molecular weight native biomasses were first depolymerized to low molecular weight derivatives. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to demonstrate the decomposing of polymeric biomass into a series of small molecular-weight substances (shown in Fig. S7, ESI†). The oxidized organic species in the electrolyte solution were analysed by HPLC-MS, GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (shown in Fig. 4, Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). The major oxidation residues of glucose, cellulose and starch are formic acid, glycolic acid and acetic acid. The emission gas from the reaction was collected and analysed using gas chromatography (GC) and CO2 was the only gas emitted from the solution reactions (Table S1, ESI†). When glucose was used as the feeding raw material, the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis showed that 80% weight of the initial glucose was consumed to CO2 after 20 repeated oxidation and electrolysis cycles (shown in Fig. S10, ESI†). Alternately, when lignin was used, some aromatic compounds, such as vanillin and methyl vanillate, were founded in the solution, and CO2 was found in the emission gas. If the biomass–POM reactions were induced by light irradiation rather than heating, the vanillin and methyl vanillate could further be converted to CO2.
Based on the electrical characterization and chemical analyses, the principle of this chemical-electrolysis conversion process can be proposed. The conversion process starts with the oxidation of biomass by POM in the solution under the conditions of heating or light irradiation to form a reduced POM complex (H-POMRed). At the same time, water may also play as a proton donor in the biomass oxidation by POM,5 as shown in eqn (1): (1)
When POM accepts the electrons from biomass, the valencies of metal ions (Mo6+ or W6+) changed into a low valence state (Mo5+ or W5+), which leads to a drop of the electrode potential of the POM solution. The electrode potentials with different reduction degrees were investigated using a graphite electrode immersed in the POM solution, which are shown in Fig. 5A. With the reduction degree of SiW12 increased from 0 to 0.12, the electrode potential decreased from 0.65 V to near 0 V (vs. Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE)). For PMo12, the electrode potential dropped about 0.3 V after the reduction degree increased to 3. These results indicate the reduced POM complex can be readily oxidized on the anode when an electric potential was applied. The linear potential sweep curves (shown in Fig. 5B) clearly illustrate that high reduction degree POM requires a low applied potential for electro-oxidation and produces a large anodic current density at the same applied potential. Many factors may affect the anodic currents such as the reduction degree, temperature and the total concentration of POM anions. The detail experiments of linear potential sweep reveal that the reduction degree and temperature are significant factors that will profoundly promote the electrolysis performance (shown in Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†).

Pt wire was used as a counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. (B) Linear potential sweep curves of PMo12 (0.3 mol l−1)–glucose solution (25 °C) at different reduction degrees in a three-electrode compartment using a polished graphite rod as a working electrode. 
By applying an electric field, the reduced POM complex releases an electron to the anode electrode, and a proton into the electrolyte solution, as shown in eqn (2). This electron transfer process does not require the assistant of noble-metal catalysts (demonstrated by Fig. S13, ESI†). Therefore, different from the traditional PEM electrolysis cell, the anode in our biomass electrolyzer was made of the simple graphite-felt without noble-metal catalysts.
The released proton diffuses to the cathode side through the proton-exchange membrane and combined with the electron that comes from the anode side under applied electric field. Finally H2 produced, as shown in eqn (3): (2) (3)
In summary, a new route for a high efficient chemical-electric conversion (CEC) of biomass to H2 was reported. Although it has been known that adding alcohols in PEMEC can reduce the split energy, the sluggish kinetics of the alcohol oxidation on electrode leads to a high over-potential and the high costs of the noble-metal catalyst used in traditional electrolysis limit their commercial application. Different from the traditional PEMEC method, we reported a new route here that biomasses were directly oxidized by POM in the aqueous solution but not on the anode electrode surface. As a result, raw biomasses without chemical pre-treatment and purification in a form of suspended solid powder or soluble polymer solution can be directly used for hydrogen production by the electrolysis method. Upon reacting with POM in the solution, biomass is degraded and continuously oxidized into small derivatives, and part of the ultimate product in the oxidation could be CO2, which indicates a high utilization of biomass. The electron transfer from biomass to POM can be promoted by simple heating or sunlight irradiation. Therefore, the solar energy and the chemical energy of biomass are transformed and stored in the form of a reduced POM complex in the electrolyte solution. The reduced POM has a low applied potential and it can be readily reoxidized on a carbon anode. This leads to a large drop of applied potential during the electrolysis, and therefore a large amount of electric energy can be saved by the electrolysis of the biomass–POM solution. The POM ions also play as the electron–proton carrier that captures electrons from biomass and protons from water and biomass. Therefore, a complete noble metal free carbon electrode could be adopted as the electrolysis anode. In addition, different from the noble-metal catalysts applied in the traditional PEM electrolysis cell, the POM catalyst is tolerant to most organic and inorganic contaminants,28 and the cost of POM is very low. Because POMs are robust and self-healing,28 they can be reused in this chemical-electrolysis conversion. Borrás-Almenar et al. indicated that for the reaction mixture containing the substrate and the POM catalyst, hundreds of thousands of turnovers are possible.29 If the biomass can be completely decomposed to CO2, biomass is the only material to be added to the system, and a completely reuse of POMs can be realized. The direct use of raw biomass, the noble-metal catalyst free anode and the very low electric energy consumption demonstrate a promising route for H2 production in this study.

Broader context
Biomass is a sustainable source for hydrogen production. Although thermochemical approach (pyrolysis and gasification) has been practically applied to produce hydrogen, the process requires high temperature and expensive catalysts. The presence of mixture gases in the hydrogen product is another problem. Biological (biophotolysis, water–gas shift reaction and fermentation) processes can produce hydrogen from biomasses, but their efficiency is low. Electrolysis technology can produce pure hydrogen at low temperature, but the current technology cannot utilize polymeric biomass directly. Furthermore, the noble metal catalysts used in the current electrolysis process are easily poisoned by contaminants existing in raw biomasses. Herein, we report an electrolysis approach for directly producing hydrogen from almost all native biomasses by using polyoxometalate (POM) solution as both a catalyst and charge carriers. The catalytic redox reaction occurs in the solution but not on the anode surface. As a result, a noble metal is no longer needed for the anode. The POM catalyst is robust and tolerant to most organic and inorganic contaminants. Therefore, chemical pretreatment is not necessary for native biomasses. The electrolysis energy consumption is very low, which is only about 16.7% of the energy consumption of electrolysis of water.
