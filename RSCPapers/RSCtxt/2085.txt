    , Accepted 5th October 2015First published on 6th October 2015AbstractThe efficiency of water splitting is mainly limited by the low rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and it is thus of great importance but still remains a huge challenge to develop efficient OER catalysts capable of delivering high current densities at low overpotentials. Herein, we describe our recent finding that a Fe-doped Ni3S2 particle film with 11.8% Fe-content hydrothermally grown on nickel foam (Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF) behaves as a highly active robust oxygen evolution electrode in strongly alkaline media. This electrode needs an overpotential of only 253 mV to achieve 100 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 65.5 mV dec−1 and maintains its catalytic activity for at least 14 h in 1 M KOH, and the NiOOH and FeOOH formed at the Fe11.8%-Ni3S2 surface are the actual catalytic sites. Notably, it also operates efficiently and stably in 30 wt% KOH, capable of affording very high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2 at small overpotentials of 238 and 269 mV, respectively, with a faradaic efficiency of 100%.
Introduction
The growing depletion of non-renewable resources and the increasing concerns about environmental pollution from fossil fuels have stimulated intense interest in energy conversion and storage from alternative sustainable energy sources.1 Hydrogen is considered as an ideal clean fuel essential to several key industrial processes and could play a major role as an energy carrier in a future hydrogen economy.2 Splitting of water affords a promising solution to hydrogen generation from renewable energy sources like solar and wind power,3,4 but the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proceeding through several steps with high activation energies severely limit the efficiency of hydrogen production.5,6 Thus, efficient OER catalysts must be utilized to accelerate the reaction rate and reduce the overpotential.4 The best OER catalysts (IrO2 and RuO2) suffer from scarcity and high cost hampering their widespread use,7 which pushes the development of efficient earth-abundant alternatives.
Ni has emerged as an interesting non-precious metal for its catalytic power toward oxygen evolution and considerable recent research attention has been paid to make Ni-based inorganic materials active OER catalysts, including oxides/hydroxides,8–11 chalcogenides,12,13 nitrides,14,15etc., and some Ni-containing mixed-metal oxides/hydroxides11,16–24 and sulfides25,26 have also been developed. It has also been reported that heterogeneous metal doping leads to enhanced OER activity of Ni-based oxides/hydroxides.27–29 Although with such great success, these catalysts cannot satisfy the requirements of industrial applications where very high current densities (≥500 mA cm−2) are driven at low overpotentials (≤300 mV). Only recently have Lu et al. reported electrodeposition of hierarchically structured three-dimensional NiFe double hydroxide on nickel foam (NiFe/NF) as an efficient oxygen evolution electrode which needs an overpotential of 270 mV to drive 1000 mA cm−2 in 10 M KOH.30
The superior electronic conductivity of most sulfides to oxides/hydroxides31 offers a great benefit to the electrochemical performance of catalysts. Fe-doped nickel sulfide is thus expected to work as a high-performance OER catalyst, which, however, has not been explored before. In this work, we describe our recent finding that the Fe-doped Ni3S2 particle film in situ hydrothermally grown on NF with 11.8% Fe-content (Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF) behaves as a cost-effective OER electrode excellent in activity and stability in strongly alkaline electrolytes. This electrode affords 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential (η) of only 253 mV with a Tafel slope of 65.5 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH. Remarkably, it still maintains strong long-term electrochemical durability with superior activity in 30 wt% KOH, requiring small overpotentials of 238 and 269 mV to drive very high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively, with 100% faradaic efficiency (FE).
Experimental
Materials
FeSO4·7H2O and KOH were purchased from Beijing Chemical Corp. Nickel foam (NF) was purchased from Shenzhen Green and Creative Environmental Science and Technology Co. Ltd. Ethanol was purchased from Aladdin Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72R) and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the reagents were used as received. The water used throughout all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.
Preparation of Fex%-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF
Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF was prepared as follows. Typically, 1.75 mmol of FeSO4·7H2O and 5.25 mmol of L-cysteine were dissolved in 35 mL water under stirring for 1 h. Then the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave (50 mL) and a piece of NF (2.5 cm × 3.5 cm), which was cleaned by sonication sequentially in acetone, ethanol and water for 30 min each, was immersed into the solution. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 150 °C for 10 h in an electric oven. After the autoclave cooled down slowly at room temperature, the NF was taken out and washed with water thoroughly before being vacuum dried. Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF were prepared similarly by adjusting the amount of FeSO4·7H2O to 0.875 mmol and 2.625 mmol, respectively. Ni3S2/NF was made without the addition of FeSO4·7H2O. The Fe-content was calculated using the equation: Fe (wt)% = [Mr(Fe)]/[Mr(Fe) + 0.5 × n × Mr(Ni3S2)]. The mass loading of Fex%-Ni3S2 grown on the NF was calculated as follows: mFex%-Ni3S2 = [Mr(Fe)]/[Mr(Fe) + n × Mr(S)] × y + [n × Mr(S)]/[Mr(Fe) + n × Mr(S)] × [Mr(Ni3S2)/2Mr(S)] × y. For Ni3S2/NF the mass loading of Ni3S2 grown on the NF was calculated as follows: mNi3S2 = [Mr(Ni3S2)/2Mr(S)] × y with Mr being the relative formula mass, n being the molar ratio of S to Fe obtained from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectra, and the weight increment (y mg) of Ni foam was directly weighted after the synthesis of the sample on NF.
Preparation of RuO2
The RuO2 catalyst was prepared as follows. In brief, 0.01 mol of RuCl3·3H2O was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water and heated under air atmosphere at 100 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 1 mL KOH solution (1.0 M). The reaction mixture was maintained at this temperature under stirring for 45 min. After that, the solution was centrifuged for 10 minutes and filtered. The precipitate was washed several times with deionized water to remove the remaining chlorides. The resulting Ru-hydroxide was dried for 5 h at 80 °C and then calcined in air at 300 °C for 3 h to obtain RuO2.
Characterization
Powder XRD data were collected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (λ = 1.5418 Å). XPS analysis was carried out on a Thermal ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV photons). SEM measurements were performed on an XL30 ESEM FEG scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. TEM measurements were performed on a HITACHI H-8100 electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. GC analysis was carried out on a GC-2014C (Shimadzu Co.) with a thermal conductivity detector and nitrogen carrier gas. Pressure data during electrolysis were recorded using a CEM DT-8890 Differential Air Pressure Gauge Manometer Data Logger Meter Tester with a sampling interval of 1 point per second.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed with a CHI 660D electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai) in a standard three-electrode system using Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF as the working electrode, a graphite plate as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. To prepare RuO2 loaded electrodes, 20 mg RuO2 and 10 μL 5 wt% Nafion solutions were dispersed in 1 mL 1:1 v water/ethanol solvent by 30 min sonication to form an ink finally. Then 98.7 μL catalyst ink was loaded on a TiM with a catalyst loading of 7.9 mg cm−2. All electrolytes were saturated by oxygen bubbles before and during the experiments. Polarization curves were recorded using linear sweep voltammetry without the involvement of any activation process. Prior to measurement, resistance tests were made using the CHI software at corresponding open-circuit potentials (in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz) in the alkaline standard three-electrode system. All potentials measured were calibrated to the RHE using the following equation: E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 V + 0.059 × pH − iR.
Results and discussion
The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of hydrothermally treated NF (Fig. S1†) indicates the existence of Fe, Ni, and S elements while the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1a) only shows diffraction peaks indexed to the (101), (110), (003), (113), and (122) planes of Ni3S2 (JCPDS 44-1418) with the observation of another two strong peaks arising from the substrate (JCPDS 65-2865). These observations suggest the formation of Fe-doped Ni3S2 with 11.8% Fe-content (see the Experimental section for calculation details) and the resulting electrode is denoted as Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1b) demonstrate the full coverage of the surface of NF by Fe11.8%-Ni3S2 particles. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1c) reveals that the particles have diameters in the range of 400–800 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1c inset) shows clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 0.184 nm corresponding to the (113) plane of the Ni3S2 phase. Fig. 1d presents the SEM and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of Fe, Ni, and S for Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF, suggesting the uniform distribution of Fe, Ni, and S elements. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum in the Ni 2p region (Fig. 1e) shows two strong peaks at 856.2 and 874.2 eV, corresponding to the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively.12,32 The peak at 852.8 eV can be attributed to Ni3S2 or nickel.12,33 The satellite peaks at 861.8 and 879.8 eV are shakeup type peaks of nickel.34 The two peaks at 711.9 and 725.1 eV in the Fe 2p region (Fig. 1f) correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, indicating the presence of Fe(III).35 The absence of satellite peaks of Fe2O3 at around 719 and 732 eV excludes the existence of Fe2O3.36 The peaks at 161.5 eV and 162.8 eV in the S 2p region (Fig. S2a†) correspond to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, attributed to the S2− of Ni3S2.37 The additional peak at 168.8 eV is typical for Ni–O–S species with a high oxidation state of sulfur, which is due to the surface oxidation in air.37 The peak at 531.2 eV in the O 1s region (Fig. S2b†) corresponds to NiO generated by the surface oxidation.32 The other peak at 532.7 eV may be due to absorbed water or possibly adsorbed O2.33 All the results confirm the incorporation of Fe(III) into the Ni3S2 lattice. Note that the same preparation without the presence of Fe salt produces a Ni3S2 particle film on NF (Ni3S2/NF), as shown in Fig. S3.†

The electrochemical OER performance of the Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF electrode was first evaluated in O2-saturated 1 M KOH with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, using a standard three-electrode system. For comparison, blank NF, Ni3S2/NF, and RuO2 on NF (RuO2/NF) electrodes were also examined. All potentials were reported with respect to the RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and an iR compensation was applied to all initial data for further analysis because the as-measured reaction currents cannot directly reflect the intrinsic behavior of catalysts due to the effect of ohmic resistance.38Fig. 2a presents the polarization curves. The oxidation peaks at ∼1.4 V vs. RHE are attributed to the formation of Ni(III).13,30 As observed, RuO2/NF is highly active for the OER with 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 257 mV while blank NF has negligible OER activity. Ni3S2/NF is also active for the OER with the need for an overpotential of 431 mV to drive 100 mA cm−2. It is surprising to find that Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF has significantly enhanced catalytic activity requiring a much lower overpotential of only 253 mV to afford 100 mA cm−2. This current density compares favorably with the behavior of many recent non-noble metal OER catalysts at the same overpotential, including FeNi-GO/LDH (50 mA cm−2),39 H-LDH-1 (∼72 mA cm−2),40 NiFe/NF (∼32 mA cm−2),30 CQDs/NiFe-LDH (∼22 mA cm−2),41 NiFeOx/CFP (∼28 mA cm−2),42 NiFe-LDH/CNT on CFP (∼23 mA cm−2),19 Ni2/3Fe1/3-GO (∼20 mA cm−2),43 NiFe LDH/NF (∼13 mA cm−2),22 NiFe NS (∼2 mA cm−2),44etc. At the same overpotential, the current density of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF based on the loading mass is 12.7 mA mg−1 (Fig. S4†). Although it is lower than that of NiFeOx/CFP (∼17.5 mA mg−1)42 and NiFe NS (∼28.6 mA mg−1),44 it is higher than that of NiFe-LDH (∼8.9 mA mg−1),41 Ni2/3Fe1/3-NS (∼12.1 mA mg−1),43 NiFe (∼3.6 mA mg−1),45 and Fe-Ni-Ox-MPs (∼8.9 mA mg−1).46 To estimate the effective surface areas of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF, we measured the capacitances of the double layer at the solid–liquid interface of both electrodes.47 The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were collected in the region of 1.07–1.17 V in 1 M KOH, where the current response should be only due to the charging of the double layer (Fig. S5†). The capacitances of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF are 14.6 and 6.5 mF cm−2, respectively, demonstrating that Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF has much higher surface roughness than Ni3S2/NF. Thus, the superior OER activity of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF can be partially associated with the high surface area.48 Previous reports demonstrated that the introduction of Fe into the Ni-based nanostructured material can promote the formation and stabilization of the catalytically active species, leading to high OER performance.49

The electrolyte is 1 M KOH. 
The catalytic kinetics of these OER electrodes were further examined by Tafel plots (Fig. 2b). The Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF exhibits a lower Tafel slope (65.5 mV dec−1) than Ni3S2/NF (107.1 mV dec−1), implying that Fe doping gives faster OER kinetics and higher performance. The multi-step chronopotentiometric curve (Fig. 2c) shows that at the start of 100 mA cm−2 the potential immediately levels off at 1.54 V and remains constant for the remaining 500 s. All current densities tested up to 600 mA cm−2 give similar results, showing the excellent mass transport property, conductivity, and mechanical robustness of this Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF electrode. Since long-term stability is another critical parameter determining the practical ability of an electrocatalyst, we probed the stability of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF by a chronopotentiometric test. As shown in Fig. 2d, this electrode preserves its catalytic activity for at least 14 h, confirming its strong electrochemical stability. Fig. 2e and f show the XPS spectra in Ni 2p and Fe 2p regions of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF after OER electrolysis, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2e, the peaks corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 and their satellite peaks are still preserved in the Ni 2p region. The peak at 858.1 eV reveals the occurrence of NiOOH.50 The formation of NiOOH is also confirmed by the additional peak at 533.5 eV in the O 1s region (Fig. S6b†),50 with the increased peak intensity of Ni–O–S in the S 2p region (Fig. S6a†). The XPS spectrum in the Fe 2p region (Fig. 2f) shows two peaks at 711.4 and 724.9 eV and two satellite peaks around 718.9 and 733.1 eV, confirming the formation of FeOOH.51 The formation of NiOOH and FeOOH was also confirmed by the Raman spectra (Fig. S7†). After OER catalysis there are only three peaks, the peak around 305 cm−1 is attributed to FeOOH52 and the other two belong to NiOOH.53 These observations conclude the evolution of NiOOH and FeOOH species at the electrode surface as the active phases for the OER.54,55
Because practical water electrolysis usually operates in a 25–30 wt% KOH,56 we further tested the OER performance of the Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF electrode in 30 wt% KOH. This electrode exhibits larger current densities and a lower Tafel slope (64.3 mV dec−1) compared with those in 1 M KOH, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The oxidation peaks shift to ∼1.25 V vs. the RHE, which is consistent with a previous report that the oxidation peak potential would shift to a less anodic potential value with increased basic concentration.57 It needs an overpotential of 222 mV to attain 300 mA cm−2, which is comparable to that of RuO2/NF (221 mV) but much smaller than those of Ni3S2/NF (322 mV) and highly active NiFe/NF (340 mV).30 Also note that this electrode requires small overpotentials of 238 and 269 mV to drive very high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively. The observation of small OER activity attenuation of this electrode after 14 h OER electrolysis (Fig. 3c) suggests its strong long-term electrochemical stability even under such strongly basic conditions.

(c) Chronopotentiometric curve of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF with a constant current density of 500 mA cm−2. (d) The amount of O2 theoretically calculated (black curve) and experimentally measured (blue curve) versus time for Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF at 1.6 V for 60 min. All experiments were carried out in 30 wt% KOH. 
The evolved O2 was confirmed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis and its total amount (n) was measured quantitatively using a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the anode compartment of an H-type electrolytic cell according to the established method.38,58 Potentiostatic electrolysis was performed at 1.6 V for 60 min. The FE of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF for oxygen evolution was determined by comparing the amount of generated O2 with the theoretically calculated value (assuming 100% FE). The total amount of charge (Q) passed through the cell was obtained from the current–time curve and the FE can be calculated from FE = n/(Q/4F), where F is the Faraday constant. The agreement of both values suggests 100% FE (Fig. 3d), implying that the current density is directly related to oxygen evolution.
We further examined the effect of Fe-content on the OER activity by preparing another two samples with an Fe-content of 6.5% (Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF) and 14.9% (Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF). Although no obvious differences in the structure and morphology are observed for three samples (Fig. S8†), both Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF electrodes exhibit inferior OER activity over Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF in 30 wt% KOH requiring overpotentials of 261 and 280 mV to drive 300 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b presents the Tafel plots of Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF, indicating that Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF has a smaller Tafel slope and thus more favorable OER kinetics than Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF (77.1 mV dec−1) and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF (108.7 mV dec−1). To estimate the effective surface areas of the samples, we collected the CVs in the region of 1.07–1.17 V in 30 wt% KOH (Fig. S9†). The capacitances of Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF, Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF are 15.6, 31.3, and 12.4 mF cm−2, respectively, demonstrating that Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF has much higher surface roughness than Fe6.5%-Ni3S2/NF and Fe14.9%-Ni3S2/NF. Thus, the superior OER activity of Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF can be partially associated with the high surface area.48 It should be mentioned that the decreased catalytic activity with further increased Fe content can also be partially ascribed to the fact that more Fe would suppress the electrochemical oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) and decrease the number of Ni active sites on the catalytic surface.36,59

Conclusions
In summary, Fe-doped Ni3S2 particle films with different Fe-contents have been hydrothermally developed on nickel foam. The Fe11.8%-Ni3S2/NF behaves as a high-efficiency and robust oxygen evolution electrode with very high current density in strongly alkaline electrolytes. It requires an overpotential of only 253 mV to drive 100 mA cm−2 with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 14 h in 1 M KOH. In 30 wt% KOH, small overpotentials of 238 mV and 269 mV are needed to attain 500 and 1000 mA cm−2, respectively. The superior catalytic activity and stability meet the strict criteria for practical industrial uses. We believe that this work not only provides us with a low-cost, stable, and active oxygen evolution catalyst, but also points out the new direction in designing and developing metal-doped transition metal chalcogenides as attractive heterogeneous catalytic materials for applications in water-splitting devices and metal–air batteries.60
