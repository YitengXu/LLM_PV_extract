Broader context
Thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy. Thermoelectric power generation technology is hopefully expected to crack the alternative energy source development and global climate warming problems by harvesting and converting waste heat into electricity. A new potential thermoelectric material, composed of nontoxic, naturally abundant, light, and cheap elements, is expected to play a vital role in extensive applications for waste heat recovery in a thermally stable atmosphere. This review summarizes and discusses the crystal structures, microstructures, electronic structures, physical and chemical properties, and the effective approaches successfully applied to enhance the thermoelectric performance for BiCuSeO. To date, BiCuSeO has been paid ever-increasing attention and extensively studied since it was reported as a promising thermoelectric material in 2010. The thermoelectric performance ZT was significantly increased from 0.5 to 1.4 in the past three years, which indicates that BiCuSeO oxyselenides are robust thermoelectric candidates for energy conversion applications in the moderate temperature range.

1. Introduction
Providing a sustainable energy supply is becoming a major societal problem as fossil fuel supplies decrease while demand increases. Hence, the past few years have witnessed a surge in interest in developing alternative renewable energy technologies. In particular, thermoelectric materials have drawn vast attention because thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy, and provide an alternative for power generation and refrigeration. The key parameter that defines the efficiency of thermoelectric materials is the ‘dimensionless figure of merit’ ZT which derives from a combination of three physical properties: thermal conductivity (κ), electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S), ZT = (S2σ/κ)T, with temperature T. The quantity of S2σ is defined as the power factor. Ideally, both electrical conductivity σ and Seebeck coefficient S must be large, while the thermal conductivity κ must be minimized. However, the well-known complex relationship among the three parameters makes it challenging to develop effective approaches to improve the overall ZT.
Since Seebeck observed thermoelectric phenomena in 1821 for the first time, thermoelectric materials have been developed for nearly 200 years. Historically, the development of thermoelectric materials can be divided into three generations.1 From 1821 to the 1950s to the 1960s for the first functioning devices fabricated, ZT was about 1.0, and the devices can operate at ∼4–5% conversion efficiency; the second period extends to the 1990s, during which period the new theoretical ideas related to “size effects” and the search for new materials following the PGEC (phonon-glass electron-crystal) concept2 stimulated new experimental research that eventually led to significant advances, resulting in a ZT of 1.3–1.7. These second generation materials are expected to produce power generation devices with conversion efficiencies of 11–15%; the third generation of bulk thermoelectric materials has been under development recently, new concepts and new technologies have pushed ZT to range from 1.8 to 2.2, and the predicted device conversion efficiency increased to ∼15–20%, but no experimental evidence of such a large conversion efficiency in modules or of its stability upon time has been reported yet.
The widely used approaches to enhance ZT can be summarized as: modifying the band structure,3,4 band convergence,5,6 quantum confinement effects,7 electron energy barrier filtering to enhance Seebeck coefficients,8 nanostructuring,9–15 all-scale hierarchical architecturing16,17 to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, and band energy alignment between nano-precipitate/matrix to maintain the carrier mobility.18,19 Most of these approaches aim to maintain a high power factor and/or reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Alternatively, one can seek high performance in pristine thermoelectric materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivity,20 which may arise from large anharmonicity,20–22 a large molecular weight,23 a complex crystal structure,24 and charge density wave distortions,25 and improve their electrical transport properties by optimizing the charge carrier concentration, tuning the band-gaps, etc.26–31
According to the optimal working temperature, the thermoelectric materials can be divided into three applied temperature ranges.12,14,32 In the low temperature range (200–400 K), typical materials are bismuth chalcogenides (Bi–Sb–Te, Bi–Te–Se, and Bi–S);33–38 in the middle temperature range (600–900 K), typical materials are lead chalcogenides (PbTe, PbSe, and PbS),3,5,9,16,18,39–42 magnesium group IV compounds (Mg–Si–Sn),6,43,44 skutterudites,10,45–50 half-Heusler alloys51–55 and clathrates;56–59 while in the high temperature range (>900 K), typical materials are silicon–germanium60–62 and Zintl phases.23,63–65 Most of the above mentioned thermoelectric materials are heavy-metal-based alloys, including rare-earth and costly elements. In addition, all the above mentioned materials may not be attractive in practical applications, particularly when operating at high temperature, because their constituents can decompose, be oxidized, vaporize, or melt at high temperatures. Therefore, new potential thermoelectric materials, composed of nontoxic, earth-abundant, light, and cheap elements, are expected to play a vital role in extensive thermoelectric applications for energy conversion; examples are SrTiO3, sodium cobalt, calcium cobalt, etc.66
Since BiCuSeO oxyselenides were reported as potential thermoelectric materials in 2010, they have attracted ever-increasing attention and they have been extensively studied.30 In this review, we summarize and discuss the crystal structures, microstructures, electronic structures and physical/chemical properties of BiCuSeO oxyselenides. The effective approaches that successfully enhanced the thermoelectric performance in BiCuSeO systems are summarized, specifically, increasing carrier concentration, optimizing Cu vacancies, a simple and facile ball milling method, multifunctional Pb doping, band gap tuning, and increasing carrier mobility via texturing. A discussion of future possible strategies is aimed at enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit of these materials.
2. A short review for conventional thermoelectric materials and BiCuSeO
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the number of publications on BiCuSeO oxyselenides has shown an increasing trend since they were reported as promising thermoelectric materials in 2010.30 The research studies involve many world leading groups in the thermoelectric community. Many publications concerning the development of BiCuSeO oxyselenides appeared in the past three years, indicating indisputable interest in this system as the most promising candidates for commercial thermoelectric applications. It is interesting to compare BiCuSeO with the most advanced thermoelectric materials well known to date. Fig. 1(b) shows some typical state-of-the-art bulk thermoelectric materials developed in the last few decades, which cover the temperature ranges from 200 K to 1200 K. In this plot, the conventional Bi2Te3-based (∼300 K),34 Pb(Ge)Te-based (∼700 K)9,16,67 and SiGe-based (∼1000 K)60 alloys have been reinforced by advanced nanotechnology recently. At the beginning of the 1990s, the search for new materials, such as skutterudites,68 clathrates,58etc., was mainly motivated by the concept of Slack's “Phonon Glass-Electron Crystal”.2 In these compounds, the “rattling” motion of loosely bonded atoms within a large cage generates strong phonon scattering but has a less impact on the transport of carriers. Furthermore, Zintl phases with large and complex unit cells, including Yb14MnSb11,23 Yb11GaSb9,69 Ca11GaSb9 (ref. 70) and SrZnSb2,71 have been revealed to possess intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity due to the high fraction of low velocity optical phonon modes, and a tremendous amount of effort was thereafter devoted to enhancing the electrical transport properties of these Zintl phase materials. Alternatively, one can select compounds with promising electrical transport properties but relatively large lattice thermal conductivity, such as Mg2Si–Mg2Sn,6,44 half-Heusler,51,53–55,72etc. In these compounds, the reduction of the thermal conductivity would be very promising to enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit.

(b) Dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT vs. temperature of typical current thermoelectric materials: CsBi4Te6,33 Bi–Sb–Te,34 AgPbmSbTem+2 (LAST),9 Mg2SiSn,6 PbTe–SrTe–Na,16 Te–Ag–Ge–Sb (TAGS),67 skutterudite,48 BiCuSeO,73 half-Heusler,72 SiGe,60 and Zintl phase.23 
The ZT values of several materials, such as Bi2Te3- and PbTe-based ones, well exceed unity and are sufficient for commercial applications but regardless of the environmental and materials cost. What is more, the emergence of some cutting-edge techniques and synergistic approaches makes these bulk thermoelectric materials still lead the research frontier with record performances;1 typical examples are nanostructured Bi–Sb–Te,34 AgPbmSbTem+2 (LAST) with nano-dots,9 PbTe–SrTe–Na of hierarchical architecture,16etc. Although record ZT values were realized, there are very few reports on the thermoelectric module performances, and their potential for real applications still need to be demonstrated. Apart from pursuing high record ZT, the new promising candidate is also very attractive. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the maximum ZT of BiCuSeO exceeds 1 above 650 K and monotonously increases up to 1.4 at 923 K.73 The average ZT, quantitatively represented by the area under the ZT vs. temperature curve, is the property that is being used extensively to estimate the performances under real application conditions. It can be seen that the average ZT of BiCuSeO outperforms several conventional thermoelectric materials. Moreover, compared with these conventional heavy-metal-based thermoelectric materials,12,32 BiCuSeO oxyselenides consist of earth-abundant and non-toxic elements, and can thus be regarded as promising candidates for vehicle waste heat recovery and solar thermal engine replacement.

Historical background
LaAgSO as an ancestry analogue of BiCuSeO, initially studied as an ionic conductor, was first reported by Palazzi et al. in 1980.74 LaAgSO crystallizes in a layered ZrCuSiAs structure, with conductive AgS layers and charge reservoir LaO layers being mutually separated.75 Due to the similarity of their layered crystal structure to that of cuprates, oxysulfides, or more generally oxychalcogenides, were thoroughly studied during the 1990s as new promising high temperature superconductors.76–78 Several isostructural compounds of general formula RMChO (R = Bi or Ce to Dy, M = Cu or Ag, and Ch = S, Se or Te) were also discovered; they will be called “1111” in this article hereafter based on the stoichiometry.79–81 However, no superconductivity was observed in any of these compounds, the interest in this family of materials gradually faded away. A few years later, apart from the superconductivity, interest in the 1111 oxychalcogenides recurred because they might be promising in optoelectronic applications;82 since then, numerous 1111-type compounds have been synthesized.83–85
The research on the superconductor in 1111-type compounds started a new era, which was ignited by the discovery of superconductivity in two new layered superconductors LaFePO86 and LaNiPO87 by Hosono et al. in 2006. Nevertheless, due to the very low critical temperature Tc, this discovery did not lead to enthusiastic reactions until 2008. Superconductivity with Tc ∼ 26 K was observed by Hosono et al. in the F-doped LaFeAsO, which initiated tremendous research toward the high Tc iron-based superconductors,88 and Tc rapidly increased up to 43 K (ref. 89 and 90) and 56 K.91 The discovery of superconductivity in the tetragonal iron-based pnictide has stimulated significant search for superconductivity in a wide class of materials with similar structure. The effect of various substitutions on the low temperature properties of the BiCuSeO system was investigated. Whatever the substitution (Bi substituted by Sr, Cu by Fe, Se by Te, and O by F), all samples revealed p-type, and no superconductivity was observed.92 Following this Iron Rush era, Dragoe et al. started to study the 1111 oxypnictides in 2008, just three months after Tc ∼ 26 K was reported; they found that LaFeAsO exhibits a large Seebeck coefficient peak and a promising power factor at around 100 K, which make it promising for thermoelectric cooling applications in the cryogenic temperature range.93,94 Dragoe et al. therefore decided to reevaluate the potential of the oxychalcogenides for thermoelectric applications. It was found that the thermoelectric figure-of-merit of these 1111-type oxychalcogenides is mainly restricted by their high electrical resistivity, which still can be strongly reduced by tuning the carrier concentration through routine doping.95 Indeed, Sr-doped BiCuSeO exhibited a promising ZT value of 0.76 at 873 K in 2010,30 which was rapidly boosted to 1.4 at 923 K three years later,73 as will be described later. As of now the BiCuSeO system has the highest reported ZT of all oxygen containing compounds free of Pb and Te, two elements that limit large scale applications owing to the high environmental and element cost.
Crystal structure
BiCuSeO crystallizes in a layered ZrCuSiAs structure type,81 with the tetragonal unit cell a = b = 3.9273 Å, c = 8.9293 Å, Z = 2, and the space group P4/nmm (no. 129, PDF 45-0296), as listed in Table 1. Fig. 2(a) shows that, like every other LnCuChO (Ln = lanthanide, Ch = S, Se, Te), BiCuSeO exhibits a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure containing fluorite like Bi2O2 layers alternatively stacked with Cu2Se2 layers along the c-axis.96,97Fig. 2(b) shows the top-view along the c-axis. The Bi2O2 layers consist of slightly distorted Bi4O tetrahedra, Fig. 2(c), with two kinds of Bi–O–Bi bond angles, i.e., ∼106.95° and ∼114.65°.80,96–98 The coordination of Bi can also be considered as a distorted square antiprism with four O in one base and four Se in the other. The Bi–Se bond length of ∼3.2 Å is longer than the Bi–O bond length of ∼2.33 Å, which implies its layered feature. The Cu2Se2 layers consist of slightly distorted CuSe4 tetrahedra with Se–Se edges being shared, Fig. 2(d). Two kinds of Se–Cu–Se bond angles exist, with the small one being 102.6–106.95° and the large one being 113.1–114.65°.80,81,95,98 The Cu2Se2 layer could be considered as a reversed version of the Bi2O2 layer, because the position of Se atoms is the same as that of Bi atoms, while the position of Cu atoms is the same as that of O atoms in the Bi2O2 layer.80,81,95–98

Electronic band structure and projected density-of-states (DOS)

Fig. 3 shows the electronic band structure and projected DOS of pristine BiCuSeO.99 The main features are consistent with the results previously reported by Hiramatsu et al.95 According to the band structure calculation, BiCuSeO is a multiband material with an indirect band gap. From optical band gap measurements, the band gap is ∼0.8 eV for bulk and powder, and ∼1.0 eV for the thin film. In BiCuChO, as Ch ions change from S to Se to Te, the band gap decreases from ∼1.07 eV to 0.8 eV to 0.4 eV. The band gap of BiCuSeO is narrower than that of LaCuSeO (3.01 eV), mainly due to the low energy Bi 6p orbitals which are not present in LaCuSeO.99 Bi 6s states are located deep in the valence band (−10 eV to −12 eV relative to the valence band maximum), as well as O 2p states (−5 eV to −7 eV).99 The bottom of the conduction band mainly consists of Bi 6p states. The top of the valence band consists of bonding hybridized Cu 3d–Se 4p states, nonbonding Cu 3d states (−1 eV to −3 eV) and antibonding hybridized Cu 3d–Se 4p states (close to the valence band maximum). It is noteworthy that in the vicinity of the Fermi level (0 eV to −0.5 eV) Cu and Se contribute almost equally to the DOS, with about 1 state eV−1 fu−1, and synergistically determine the electronic conduction.

As mentioned above, BiCuSeO is a multiband semiconductor.29,99 The top of the valence band consists of a hole pocket located on the Γ–M line, Fig. 3(b). Other hole pockets can be observed on the Γ–X line and at the Z point, which are located about −0.15 eV below the Fermi level, and they participate in the electronic conduction at high hole concentration or at high temperature. Surprisingly, a maximum is located at the Z point for a 2D character of the crystal structure. Nevertheless, it is consistent with the projected DOS features as aforementioned. Therefore, it seems that although the electrical behavior of BiCuSeO will certainly be anisotropic, the anisotropy is probably moderate because of the moderate effective mass anisotropy, originating from the Bi 6p contribution to the DOS. The layered features of the BiCuSeO structure motivate an expected strong anisotropy,100,101 similar to the artificial superlattices.102 However, both DOS calculations and transport measurements indicate that their electrical transport properties are closer to “classical 3D materials”, with an almost parabolic-like dispersion relationship as compared to the 2D step-like DOS in superlattices.99
Microstructures
The layered structure of BiCuSeO has been investigated by advanced transmission electron microscopy (TEM),29 the layered feature, i.e., conductive Cu–Se layers alternately stacked along the c axis with insulating Bi–O layers, can only be seen along non-c axes. As expected, the lattice image along the [001] zone axis (c axis) shows homogeneous contrast, Fig. 4(a) and its fast Fourier transform image exhibit no spot splitting, Fig. 4(d), both of which reveal that the two sublattices (Cu–Se and Bi–O) are commensurate along the c axis. In contrast, lattice images along [100] and [110] zone axes in Fig. 4(b) and (c) clearly show a six-period (according to the stacking sequence –Bi–O–Bi–Se–Cu–Se–) layered structure, and the respective distinct spot splitting can be observed in fast Fourier transform images, as shown in Fig. 4(f) and (h).29

(d, f and h) Fast Fourier-transform images of (a), (b) and (c), respectively. (e, g and i) Crystal structures of BiCuSeO along [001], [100] and [110] zone axes, respectively. 
A typical low-magnification TEM image shows lamellar grains with an average width of 0.5 μm and an length of 4 μm, Fig. 5(a). The lamellar grains at the mesoscale actually stem from the directional stacking of BiCuSeO layered lattices. Due to this lamellar microstructure, anisotropic transport properties can be expected in uniaxially densified pellets, as the density of grain boundaries will not be isotropic.29 The TEM observations also reveal all types of relative orientations, i.e., coherent, semi-coherent and incoherent, between the lamellar grains. Fig. 5(b) shows a coherent boundary between two [001] direction grains, while a semi-coherent boundary also between two [001] direction grains but with ∼70° rotation, as Fig. 5(c) shows. Fig. 5(d) is a typical high resolution TEM image of another boundary between two grains with a sharp and bright interface. The upper grain is along the [100] direction while the direction of the bottom grain is along [110]. Based on the lattice image in Fig. 5(d), the established atomic model, Fig. 5(e), clearly shows the mismatch and misfit dislocations at the interface, which can also be seen from the real image in Fig. 5(d). Fig. 5(f) and (g) are the fast Fourier transform images of Fig. 5(d) and (e), revealing a similar spot distribution. However, the fact that split spots along the c direction only present in Fig. 5(f) but not in Fig. 5(g) means that the strain was partially relaxed in these two grains.29

Thermoelectric transport properties of pristine BiCuSeO
The properties of oxychalcogenides in the form of films and bulks were investigated. The optoelectronic properties were mainly studied in the form of films, which were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD),103 a reactive solid-phase epitaxial (R-SPE) technique, etc.104 The bulk materials were usually prepared by a two-step routine method: powder synthesis followed by pellet densification.27,30 Single phase powders can be synthesized by hydrothermal methods,105 solid state reactions,95 or mechanical alloying.106,107 The as-synthesized powders can then be solidified into bulk by cold-pressing,29,30 hot-pressing sintering,73,108,109 or spark plasma sintering.106,110–113 It should be noted that the studies by several groups indicate that the thermoelectric properties vary depending on the densification methods, which probably originates from either density differences or preferential orientations of grains. Here, we only discuss the thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO prepared by powder grinding followed by solid state sintering hereafter in this section.29
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the electrical conductivity of BiCuSeO increases with rising temperature, indicating a semiconductor transport behavior. In the entire temperature range of the measurement, the electrical conductivity is much lower than that of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials;1,8,12,15,32 for example, it is about 1.12 S cm−1 at room temperature, Table 1. The low electrical conductivity is related to a low carrier concentration of 1 × 1018 cm−3 and a carrier mobility of 22 cm2 V−1 s−1. Fig. 6(b) shows that the Seebeck coefficient of BiCuSeO is about 350 μV K−1 at room temperature, and keeps increasing with rising temperature and reaches about 425 μV K−1 at 923 K. The origin of the p-type conduction in pristine BiCuSeO is possibly related to the Cu vacancies, which will be discussed later. The combination of low electrical conductivity and large Seebeck coefficient results in a moderate power factor of about 2.5 μW cm−1 K−2 at 923 K, Fig. 6(c). The heat capacity, Cp, shows an increasing trend with temperature, Fig. 6(d). As shown in Fig. 6(e), the total thermal conductivity is low at room temperature and keeps decreasing with rising temperature. The thermal conductivity is determined by its lattice part, since the electrical thermal conductivity is low. The lattice thermal conductivity is about 0.60 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and decreases to 0.40 W m−1 K−1 at 923 K,29 which is much lower than the values observed in most thermoelectric materials.12,13,32 The origin of this low thermal conductivity will be discussed in the next section. The relatively low power factor can be over-compensated by the extremely low thermal conductivity, thus leading to a modest dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT value of about 0.5 at 923 K,29 as shown in Fig. 6(f). This ZT value indicates that BiCuSeO is a potential candidate for thermoelectric applications in the middle temperature range.

DOS effective masses
The Seebeck coefficient of pristine BiCuSeO is large, e.g., 350 μV K−1 at 300 K and 425 μV K−1 at 923 K. Initially, the large Seebeck coefficient values were suggested to be related to its layered crystal structure. The alternating insulating (Bi2O2)2+ layers and conductive (Cu2Se2)2− layers were supposed to form a natural superlattice, with a 2D confinement of the charge carriers.30 Indeed, the natural layered structure of (Bi2O2)2+/(Cu2Se2)2−/(Bi2O2)2+ is very similar to the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3/SrTi0.8Nb0.2O3/SrTiO3 artificial multilayer structures, which exhibit a giant absolute value of Seebeck coefficient, ∼850 μV K−1 at 300 K.102 Despite the complex nonparabolic multi-band structure in BiCuSeO, the single parabolic model could still be adopted to give a rough estimation of the effective mass of about 0.6 me,29 only keeping in mind that this DOS effective mass is a mixed effective mass of multi-bands since there are at least two valence bands contributing to the electrical transport properties.
Lee et al. were the first to determine the individual effective masses of the two valence bands for BiCuSeO.114 The effective mass of the heavy band (∼1.1 me) was estimated by using the Pisarenko relationship:32 (1)where S is the Seebeck coefficient, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the electron charge, h is the Plank constant, m*d is the effective mass at the Fermi level, and p is the hole concentration. Fig. 7(a) shows the Seebeck coefficients of K doped BiCuSeO, and the effective mass can be estimated from the slope of Sp2/3vs. T as shown in the inset of Fig. 7(a). It can be seen that the slope of Sp2/3vs. T in the undoped BiCuSeO is much steeper than those in K-doped ones, indicating a large effective mass in undoped BiCuSeO, in which only the heavy band is regarded to involve in the valence band and the effective mass is thus estimated to be ∼1.1 me. The estimated DOS effective masses of the K doped BiCuSeO series are shown in Fig. 7(b); K doping moves the Fermi level deep into the second valence band, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 7(b). The increase in the effective mass along with the K doping evidences the nonparabolic feature of the light valence band. The effective mass of the nonparabolic second valence band is dependent on the carrier concentration:114 (2)where m*d0 is the DOS effective mass in the valence band maximum (VBM), which can be determined by the extrapolation of a plot of (m*d)2vs. p2/3, and E1 is a constant which can be calculated by the slope of the plot. The DOS effective mass at the VBM of the light hole was estimated to be 0.18 me. Fig. 7(c) shows that the power factor of BiCuSeO is critically dependent on both the effective mass and the carrier concentration. A similar power factor enhancement was observed in the K and Na doped BiCuSeO.114,115

Origin of the low thermal conductivity
Even though the electrical transport properties are not as promising as the ones in state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials,12–14,32 with a power factor S2σ of 2.5 μW cm−1 K−2 at 923 K, the dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT can reach about 0.5 at 923 K. The promising ZT of pristine BiCuSeO is mainly due to its intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity. As listed in Table 1, the lattice thermal conductivity is about 0.60 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and decreases to as low as 0.40 W m−1 K−1 at 923 K. To clarify the origin of the intrinsically low thermal conductivity, the elastic properties of BiCuSeO compounds have been analyzed.29,110 Young's modulus (E) value of BiCuSeO can be extracted from the longitudinal (vl) and transverse (vs) sound velocities.24,29,110 Young's modulus is related to the stiffness of a material's individual atomic bonds.24 Weaker bonds of interatomic bonding generally result in lower stiffness and lower Young's modulus. The materials with lower Young's modulus are considered as having “soft” bonding, which will result in slow transport for phonons, and thus resulting in lower lattice thermal conductivity.116 Indeed BiCuSeO exhibits a low sound velocity (Fig. 8(a)), Young's modulus (Fig. 8(b)) and lattice thermal conductivity (Fig. 8(c)) at 300 K compared to some oxygen containing samples,117,118 namely, the parameters (2107 m s−1, 76.5 GPa, 0.9 W m−1 K−1) of BiCuSeO are lower, when compared to those (2901 m s−1, 109.4 GPa, 1.4 W m−1 K−1) of Ba2YbAlO5, (3078 m s−1, 116.5 GPa, 1.8 W m−1 K−1) of BaDyAlO5 and (3832 m s−1, 234.3 GPa, 2.2 W m−1 K−1) of Gd2Zr2O7.29,110

Besides the analysis of Young's modulus (E), which is related to the chemical bonding strength, the Grüneisen parameter (γ) is also relevant to the evaluation of the thermal conductivity.20,119 The Grüneisen parameter is often referred to as a temperature dependent anharmonicity parameter that reflects the phonon vibrations in crystal lattices that deviate from harmonic oscillation. The anharmonicity of the chemical bond drives the phonon–phonon umklapp and normal processes that intrinsically limit the lattice thermal conductivity. The Grüneisen parameter of BiCuSeO can be calculated using the following relationship:29,120 (3)where Poisson ratio νp can be derived from the longitudinal vl and transverse vs sound velocities by117,120 (4)
The Grüneisen parameter γ was calculated to be ∼1.5 for BiCuSeO, which indicates high anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations and is a signature of a low thermal conductivity material. The Grüneisen parameter (γ) value of ∼1.5 for BiCuSeO is comparable to or even a little bit higher than that (1.45) of PbTe,121 which is a conventional thermoelectric material that has been paid extensive attention. Morelli et al. reported that the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of AgSbTe2 results from an extremely high Grüneisen parameter (γ) value of 2.05.20 The high Grüneisen parameter (γ), linked to the bond anharmonicity, may originate from the presence of the lone pair electrons in the Sb's sp-hybridized orbitals.20,122 This lone-pair electron gives rise to extra electron clouds surrounding Sb atoms and causes nonlinear repulsive forces which are manifested as bond anharmonicity.20,122 As in the same V group, similarly low lattice thermal conductivity should be observed in the Bi-based compounds.120,122 The connection between the nature of the bonding and the Grüneisen parameter (γ) has been explored in detail theoretically by Huang et al.,123 who clearly showed the effect of large electron clouds on anharmonicity. In addition, the lone pair electrons of Bi probably lead to a more asymmetric electron density, thus resulting in stronger lattice anharmonic vibration. The very low thermal conductivity and high Grüneisen parameter (γ) value of 1.5 in the BiCuSeO system arise at least partially from the increased bond anharmonicity associated with the occurrence of trivalent Bi.120–122
Besides the analysis of Young's modulus and Grüneisen parameter for the BiCuSeO system, other possible reasons were also suggested, including the layered structure where phonons might be confined and scattered at the interfaces,124 the presence of heavy elements which leads to lower phonon group velocity, etc.13,14 All these features can be shortly summarized as involving heavy atoms with ‘soft’ bonding, which can meet the requirements for the selection of low thermal conductivity materials as suggested by Clarke.116
4. Enhanced thermoelectric performance of BiCuSeO through optimizing charge carrier concentration
Compared with state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials,12–14,32 the features of pristine BiCuSeO can be summarized as a moderate Seebeck coefficient, intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity, but low electrical conductivity. At first glance, it seems that there is not too much room left to further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, which is already low and ranges from 0.40 W m−1 K−1 to 0.60 W m−1 K−1 at 300–923 K. Therefore, the best way to enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT seems to improve the electrical transport properties. The room temperature carrier concentration is about 1 × 1018 cm−3, which is much lower than the optimum values observed in state-of-the-art thermoelectrics,12–14,32 which are generally of the order of 1 × 1019 to 1 × 1020 cm−3.32 The positive Seebeck coefficient indicates that holes are the majority carriers. Therefore, several options can be followed to increase the carrier concentration. Although BiCuSeO cannot be described using an “ionic-model”, as can be seen from the strong hybridization between Cu and Se orbitals in the band structure calculations, Fig. 3, such a simplified model can still be useful to understand the doping behavior in this compound.99 In this model, to keep the charge balance in BiCuSeO, the valent configuration of Bi is 3+, that of Cu is 1+, and that of both Se and O is 2−. Therefore, the elements with positive valence <3 can be selected as p-type dopants on Bi sites, while no elements with positive valence <1 could substitute the Cu site. For the Se and O sites, the elements with negative charge must be >2, which offers few options. Thus, to improve the electrical transport properties of BiCuSeO, most of the elements with 2+ valence (M2+) were extensively studied; examples are alkaline-earth metals: Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba.26,27,29,30 In this section, we summarize the thermoelectric transport properties of Bi1−xMxCuSeO.
Carrier concentration and carrier mobility of Bi1−xMxCuSeO

Fig. 9(a) shows the schematic crystal structure of BiCuSeO, which depicts that the holes generated by M2+ (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) doping into Bi sites are injected into (Cu2Se2)2− metallic layers.26,27,29–31 This behavior can be described similarly to that of iron-based LaFeAsO superconductors.88 In a simplified picture, BiCuSeO materials consist of insulating oxide (Bi2O2)2+ layers with ionic bonds, acting as charge reservoirs, and conductive selenide (Cu2Se2)2− layers with covalent bonds, serving as the conduction pathway for carrier transport. Therefore, the carrier concentration can be enhanced through partial substitution of Bi3+ by M2+ in the insulating oxide (Bi2O2)2+ layers, and the induced holes then transfer to the conductive (Cu2Se2)2− layers. This can be explained by a defect equation as follows:26,27,29,30 2(Bi1−xMxCuSeO) = (Bi2(1−x)M2xO2)2(1−x)+ + (Cu2Se2)2− + 2xh+(5)
 Fig. 9  (a) Schematic crystal structure of BiCuSeO, in which hole carriers generated by M2+ (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) doping into Bi sites are injected into CuSe metallic layers as a result of the large energy offset between these two layers. (b) Carrier concentration of BiCuSeO as a function of M2+ doping fractions. (c) Carrier mobility of BiCuSeO as a function of M2+ doping fractions. 
This simplified description is well supported by the band structure calculations. Indeed, one can see above that Bi and O states are located well below the Fermi level, and that the top of the valence band consists of hybridized Cu and Se states. Therefore, when some holes are created within the Bi2O2 layers they are transferred to the Cu–Se states, at the top of the valence band.99,125 Moreover, the calculations have shown that M2+ substitution on the Bi site does not influence the states located close to the Fermi level and that the doping can be described in the framework of a rigid band model.99 Therefore, M2+ doping on the Bi site only changes the Fermi energy, and thus the charge carrier concentration.
As shown in Fig. 9(b), the carrier concentration is significantly increased after M2+ (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) doping.26,27,29,30 A value as high as 1.3 × 1021 cm−3 can be reached at a 15% M2+ doping level. According to eqn (5), which corresponds to the rigid band model, if we assume that each M2+ gives one hole h+ to the valence band, with x = 0.15 M2+ doping there should be 0.3 holes per unit cell (2 BiCuSeO units per unit cell), and based on the volume of the BiCuSeO unit cell, which is around 137.06 Å3 (Table 1), it should lead to a theoretical carrier concentration of around 1.1 × 1021 cm−3. The experimental value agrees very well with the estimation, which confirms the validity of the rigid band model framework for these materials. It should be noted that not all M2+ elements are effective dopants. Indeed, the carrier concentration obtained by Mg2+ doping is two orders of magnitude lower than those of M2+ (M = Ca, Sr and Ba),26,27,29,30 and is much lower than the aforementioned calculated value, indicating that not all Mg atoms effectively replace Bi3+ in the BiCuSeO lattice. This phenomenon might be explained by the fact that Mg2+ is much smaller than Bi3+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, which thus has a smaller overlap of the atomic orbitals and lower charge transfer.26
Compared with the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials,12–14,32 the carrier mobility of pristine BiCuSeO is relatively low, around ∼22 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 9(c), the carrier mobility shows a pronounced decrease with rising M2+ doping fractions, from 22 cm2 V−1 s−1 for pristine BiCuSeO to about 1–2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the samples with 0.15 M2+ (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) doping.26,27,29,30 This dramatic decrease of carrier mobility can be well explained by the increased ionized impurity scattering.
Thermoelectric transport properties of Bi1−xMxCuSeO
In this section, the thermoelectric properties of Bi1−xMxCuSeO (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) are compared,26,27,29,30 and only the samples exhibiting the highest ZT values were selected. It should be underlined that all transport properties of BiCuSeO polycrystalline samples must be measured along the same direction since BiCuSeO exhibits a layered structure leading to platelet grains; the ZT would be overestimated by 25–30% if the measurement directions were wrong in the BiCuSeO system.73 A good example of possible measurement errors is found in Bi2Te3 alloys, which crystallize in a layered structure too. In Bi2Te3 single crystals, the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity perpendicular to the c-axis are about 4 and 2 times larger than those along the c-axis, respectively.126 If the thermoelectric properties were measured along the different directions, in other words, the thermal and electrical conductivities were measured along out-of-plane and in-plane directions, respectively,127 thus the final ZT would be overestimated by 50% due to the texture in polycrystalline materials.
As shown in Fig. 10(a), BiCuSeO exhibits low electrical conductivity over the entire temperature range from 300 K to 923 K and semiconducting behavior. Upon M2+ doping, the electrical transport changes to metallic behavior and the electrical conductivity shows a significant increase with rising M2+ doping fractions. The highest electrical conductivity is obtained in the 0.125 Ba doped sample.27 0.05 Mg doping improves the electrical conductivity but only with a very limited effect, which is consistent with the aforementioned low doping efficiency of Mg.26 M2+ doping also decreases the Seebeck coefficient, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The Seebeck coefficient values of BiCuSeO range from ∼350 μV K−1 at 300 K to ∼425 μV K−1 at 923 K, and decrease down to ∼69 μV K−1 at 300 K and ∼167 μV K−1 at 923 K upon 0.125 Ba doping,27 owing to the significantly increased carrier concentration. Fig. 10(c) shows that all power factor curves increase monotonously up to 923 K and can be enhanced by optimization of the carrier concentration. The lattice thermal conductivity for BiCuSeO is intrinsically low and ranges from 0.40 W m−1 K−1 to 0.60 W m−1 K−1 at 300–923 K. However, the lattice thermal conductivity can be further reduced by M2+ doping, Fig. 10(d). The reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity has been well explained by point defect scattering based on the Callaway model, in which the point defect scattering in a solid solution system originates from both the mass difference (mass fluctuations) and the size and the interatomic coupling force differences (strain field fluctuations) between the impurity atom and the host lattice.29,117 Apart from the point defect scattering, the lattice thermal conductivity also can be further reduced, i.e., the lattice thermal conductivity was reduced to ∼0.25 W m−1 K−1 at 923 K as the grain size was reduced to 200–400 nm for Ba2+ doped samples.27

Fig. 11 shows the temperature dependent dimensionless figure-of-merit, ZT, for the Bi1−xMxCuSeO systems (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba).26,27,29,30 Here, it should be noted that the thermoelectric properties of some BiCuSeO systems were measured up to 923 K, some others not. The reasons may be the instrument limit. For in-depth analysis of the potential properties at elevated temperatures, one can coat the sample with a thin (0.1–0.2 mm) layer of boron nitride (BN) to protect instruments; the operation details can be referred to the literature.39 From Fig. 11, it can be seen that the ZT has been significantly improved from 0.5 for pristine BiCuSeO to 0.67, 0.9, 0.76, and 1.1 for Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba doped samples, respectively.26,27,29,30 These achievements are impressive for a new candidate since the ZT of unity has been a threshold value for several decades until the nanotechnology was discovered in the 1990s.12–14,32
 Fig. 11  Dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT for the Bi1−xMxCuSeO (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) systems.26,27,29,30 
Apart from optimizing the electrical conductivity through doping with alkaline-earth metals, i.e., Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba,26,27,29,30 alkali metals (Na and K) are also confirmed to be promising owing to their similar ionic size to alkaline earth ones,114,115 only differing in the sense that two extra holes, instead of one, can be introduced for each alkali-metal substitution. However, the limited solubility of alkali metals in BiCuSeO impedes their application in BiCuSeO as effective acceptors. As a result, the power factor of alkali metal doped compositions shows a decreasing trend with rising temperature, as compared to those of alkaline earth metal-doped Bi1−xMxCuSeO.
5. Other methods to enhance the thermoelectric performance of BiCuSeO
Other than charge carrier concentration optimization via M2+ doping, decreasing the grain size, producing Cu vacancies, doping with Pb, tuning the band gap, and increasing the carrier mobility through grain texturation are also proved to be effective to enhance the thermoelectric performance in the BiCuSeO system.
Increasing the performance by optimizing Cu vacancies
In this section, we shall describe an effective way to achieve high thermoelectric performance by introducing Cu deficiencies.111 It is generally believed that Cu vacancies widely exist in BiCuSeO synthesized during various processes.128,129 Here is the first example of study devoted to the use of Cu vacancies to dope BiCuSeO and optimize the carrier concentration. Fig. 12(a) depicts a schematic crystal structure of BiCuSeO with Cu deficiencies. In contrast to M2+ doping, the holes are directly generated in the conductive (Cu2Se2)2− layers due to Cu vacancies. In a simplified ionic model, this can be expressed by a defect equation as follows:111 2BiCu1−xSeO = (Bi2O2)2+ + (Cu2(1−x)Se2)2(1+x)− + 2xVCu− + 2xh+(6)where VCu− is the Cu vacancy and h+ is the generated holes. This equation implies that Cu deficiencies can increase the hole concentration just like conventional acceptors.

As shown in Fig. 12(b), the samples with Cu deficiency (x < 0.1, the solubility limit may be smaller than this) exhibit significantly enhanced electrical conductivity, e.g., the electrical conductivity of BiCu0.975SeO is 5.3 × 103 S m−1 at 923 K, one order of magnitude higher than 470 S m−1 of pristine BiCuSeO. The introduction of Cu deficiencies also significantly decreases the Seebeck coefficient, as shown in Fig. 12(c). Upon formation of Cu deficiencies, the Seebeck coefficient decreases due to the increased hole concentration, but the values still maintain between 165 μV K−1 and 323 μV K−1 over the entire temperature range of the measurement. Fig. 12(d) shows that the thermal conductivity for BiCu1−xSeO is almost independent of the fraction of Cu deficiencies up to x = 0.025, while the thermal conductivity starts to increase as the Cu deficiency fraction x exceeds 0.025 due to the growing contribution from the electronic thermal conductivity. Fig. 12(e) shows that ZT increases with temperature, reaching a maximum of ∼0.81 at 923 K in BiCu0.975SeO. The comparison of thermoelectric properties between samples with Cu deficiencies and pristine one are shown in the inset of Fig. 12(e) (pristine BiCuSeO is marked by the subscript symbol o), which unambiguously shows that the obtained ZT enhancement is mainly due to the improved electrical conductivity. The results indicate that the thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO can be remarkably improved by optimizing hole concentrations through tuning the fractions of Cu deficiencies in the conductive (Cu2Se2)2− layers.111
To explore the mechanisms associated with charge and heat transport in BiCu1−xSeO with Cu deficiencies, Xu et al. carried out electronic structure calculations of both the ground and excited states based on density functional theory (DFT) using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell and the BiCu0.9375SeO composition;130 here it should be noted that the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell is not big enough to estimate the band structures of a doped BiCuSeO system and calculation uncertainty may be caused. As Cu deficiencies are introduced into the structure, dramatic changes in the electronic structures are revealed by DFT calculations, which are consistent with the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements. The projected DOS and the electronic configurations of the BiCu1−xSeO system indicate that Cu deficiencies may significantly enhance the charge transfer among Bi atoms and among Se atoms, but have nearly no effects on Cu and O atoms. Fig. 12(f) shows that the charge transfer difference between BiCu1−xSeO and BiCuSeO is 0.02 among Bi atoms and 0.03 among Se atoms, respectively, whereas the charge transfer among Cu atoms and O atoms in BiCu1−xSeO can be considered the same as those in BiCuSeO. The existence of an interlayer charge transfer route involving the Bi–Se chain along the c axis is probably the origin of the high performance of the BiCu1−xSeO system. Besides the growing contribution from the electronic thermal conductivity, another explanation for the increasing thermal conductivity with the rising fraction of Cu deficiencies was proposed, that is Cu deficiencies as well as the enhanced interlayer charge transfer between the Se and Bi atoms might affect the polarizability of the Bi 6s2 electron lone pairs and relieve the bond anharmonicity, thus resulting in an increased lattice thermal conductivity. The calculation by Xu et al. reveals that the increase in conductivity in BiCu1−xSeO via Bi–Se linkages is quite inspiring and may further evidence BiCuSeO as a promising thermoelectric material.130
Improving the performance via simple and facile ball milling
Although the thermal conductivity in pristine BiCuSeO is already extremely low, there is still room left for further reduction. Li et al. reported that a simple ball milling process could cause a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric properties for pristine BiCuSeO. A ZT value of up to ∼0.70 at 773 K was achieved, which mainly comes from the composition homogeneity improvement and grain size refining during the ball milling process.110
As shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b), the grain size of BiCuSeO was significantly reduced to 1–2 μm from 10–20 μm by 1500 min ball milling. Both total (Fig. 13(c)) and lattice thermal conductivities (inset of Fig. 13(a)) exhibit the same decreasing trend with increasing temperature. The lattice thermal conductivity above 700 K shows a significant decrease after the ball milling process, stemming mainly from the enhanced grain boundary scattering due to the refined grain size by ball milling.

It is usually believed that the electrical conductivity would be diminished with reduced grain size due to the intensified charge carrier scattering at the grain boundaries. However, it is not the case for ball-milled BiCuSeO. Fig. 13(d) shows that the carrier mobility was indeed reduced by ball milling and further reduced with a prolonged ball milling time, whereas the carrier concentration was found to increase after the ball milling process, which showed an enhancing trend with prolonging ball milling time from 500 min to 1500 min. The carrier concentration at room temperature was increased from 2.65 × 1017 cm−3 to 5.22 × 1018 cm−3 after 500 min ball milling, and further to 2.73 × 1019 cm−3 after 1500 min ball milling.110 Although the reason for the increased carrier concentration by ball milling was not mentioned in the report, they most certainly come from the introduced Cu vacancies that form easily during the synthesis process.108 A similar phenomenon was observed in Bi2Te3,126,131 whose carrier concentration was recognized to be sensitive to the crystal defects aroused from the ball milling process. The accepter crystal defects came from the broken layered structures through mechanical stress during the ball milling process, thus the carrier concentration would be increased accordingly. Fig. 13(e) shows that the electrical conductivity of BiCuSeO was strongly improved after ball milling, especially at high temperatures, and that the electrical conductivity was further increased when the ball milling time was prolonged from 500 min to 1500 min. All the electrical conductivity behaviors are consistent with the observed carrier concentration variations, evidencing that ball milling is responsible for the electrical conductivity enhancement, by unintentional doping.
Benefiting from the strongly enhanced electrical conductivity and lowered thermal conductivity, the ZT value was lifted up to ∼0.70 at 773 K for BiCuSeO by a 500 min ball milling process, as shown in Fig. 13(f); this value is about 3.5 times higher than that of its pristine counterpart. It is quite astonishing that a simple ball milling process could cause such a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric performance for pristine BiCuSeO. This enhancement originates from the improved electrical conductivity, which is due to unintentional doping leading to an increased carrier concentration, and also to the reduced lattice thermal conductivity linked to the large grain boundary concentration. The work reported by Li et al. also indicated a good anti-oxidation feature of BiCuSeO, because the single phase powders were ball milled in air without any protective atmospheres.110 Later, this anti-oxidation feature of BiCuSeO was further evidenced by the successful synthesis of single-phase BiCuSeO powders by mechanical alloying in air.106,107 This advantage of the anti-oxidation feature of BiCuSeO outperforms most of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials.12–14,32
Increasing the performance through multifunctional Pb doping
Besides alkaline-earth anion M2+ (M = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) doping on Bi3+ sites, Pb2+ doping has been extensively studied by several groups,106,108,112,132 which is also an effective method to enhance the thermoelectric performance of BiCuSeO. Although the function of Pb2+ doping resembles that of alkaline-earth metal doping to the most extent, we would like to introduce Pb2+ doping in this separate section since some distinct mechanisms were also noticed.
Lan et al. observed some 5–10 nm nanodots in Pb2+ doped BiCuSeO under TEM, however, the compositions of these nanodots have not been well identified,112 although the over-doping Pb is most suspicious. These nanodots provided excessive phonon scattering centers and thus greatly reduced the lattice thermal conductivity. Lan et al. also found that the carrier concentration and the carrier mobility were enhanced simultaneously by Pb2+ doping, both of which exhibited an increasing trend with the Pb2+ doping fraction.112 The normalized carrier mobility, μ(m*)3/2, was evaluated to investigate the origin of the enhancement of the thermoelectric performance. The DOS effective mass (m*) was derived through experimentally fitting the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient on the carrier concentration, within a single parabolic band model. The results showed that the DOS effective mass was increased from 1.7 m0 (m0 is the rest mass of an electron) to ∼5 m0 by Pb2+ doping, indicating the dramatic change of the DOS (details are shown below).112 The electronic structure analysis provided an explanation for the carrier mobility (μ) enhancement, as summarized below. However, it may partly result from the grain texturation as some preferential orientation could be observed in the XRD pattern. As shown in Fig. 14(a), the normalized mobility μ(m*)3/2 of the Pb2+ doped sample is higher than those obtained with M2+ (M = Mg, Sr, and Ba) doped ones. The increased normalized mobility μ(m*)3/2 and reduced thermal conductivity lead to a maximum ZT of 1.14 at 823 K in 0.06 Pb doped BiCuSeO, as shown in Fig. 14(b).

Fig. 14(c) depicts the electronic structure calculation in detail, which shows that the enhancement of the hole mobility is very likely due to the Pb-induced delocalized lone-pair 6s orbitals in the electronic states close to the valence-band maximum, which are primarily responsible for hole transport.112 By using first-principles calculations, Pb substitution for a Bi atom (compared with other dopants, such as Mg, Sr, and Ba) gives the lowest defect formation energy in Bi0.875M0.125CuSeO (M = Pb, Mg, Sr, and Ba) among all possible configurations. In addition, on the basis of the relaxed Bi0.875M0.125CuSeO structures with the substitution impurity M2+, the orbital-projected DOS and orbital-projected band structures were calculated using a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell and a Bi0.875Pb0.125CuSeO composition. As aforementioned, it is similar to the case of the BiCu1−xSeO calculation, in which the selected small 2 × 2 × 1 supercell may cause calculation uncertainty. The authors reported that Pb2+ doping introduces substantial 6s components into the states close to the valence band maximum, while the s states from Mg, Sr, and Ba only contribute deep into the conduction band. Such delocalized 6s orbitals from the lone pair electrons in Pb are believed to be helpful to enhance the hole mobility. Thus, the Pb doping would enhance the electrical conductivity more effectively than other dopants.
Pan et al. observed somewhat distinct results of both carrier mobility and electronic structure in BiCuSeO upon Pb2+ doping.132 As shown in Fig. 14(d), the carrier mobility decreases with increasing Pb doping level, which is contrary to what Lan et al. reported.112 Regarding the electronic structure, both Pan et al. and Barreteau et al. did not find any DOS distortions in BiCuSeO due to Pb doping, which was supposed to be responsible for the enhanced effective mass.99,132 As shown in Fig. 14(e), the Seebeck coefficient of Sr doped samples is similar to that of Pb doped ones, invoking us to evaluate the effects on the band structure of BiCuSeO with different doping elements. Specifically, the Sommerfeld coefficient (γ) was measured to estimate the DOS at the Fermi level D(EF) for both spin directions according to:99,132 (7)where λe–ph is the electron–phonon coupling constant, which was set to zero. The magnitude of D(EF) of Pb doped samples increased monotonically with increasing Pb content, as shown in Fig. 14(e). This observation was consistent with the Bi1−xSrxCuSeO series, in which the density of states increased up to Sr = 0.2 where it started to decrease, in agreement with the band structure calculations. Thus, a similar D(EF) for both Pb and Sr doped samples was observed. This measured DOS at the Fermi level for Pb and Sr doped samples using the Sommerfeld coefficient would indicate that the DOS is exactly the same for Pb2+ and Sr2+ at fixed carrier concentration, which would mean that Pb2+ has a slight effect on the electronic structure of BiCuSeO.99,132
Despite that interesting physical and chemical behaviors were observed in Pb doped BiCuSeO, the underlying mechanisms still need further clarifications. For example, one can speculate that the observed nanoinclusions might contribute to the thermal conductivity reduction and ZT enhancement, as a long-time perspective, further evidence shall be gathered through performing HRTEM on these nanostructures.
Improving the performance through band gap tuning
A low electrical conductivity of the pristine BiCuSeO mainly results from its relatively narrow band gap of ∼0.8 eV, while an even narrower band gap of 0.4 eV was reported in its analogue BiCuTeO by Hiramatsu et al.95 Later on, a solid solution study of BiCuSeO/BiCuTeO was reported by Barreteau et al.,125 who found that Te substitution of Se has a significant influence on the structural and electronic properties of BiCuSeO, and that a complete solid solution exists between the two end members BiCuSeO and BiCuTeO. Here, we demonstrate that an improved thermoelectric performance can be achieved by substituting Te on the Se site in (Cu2Se2)2− layers, as reported by Liu et al.28 A smaller band gap also implies a smaller resistivity but also a smaller Seebeck coefficient, therefore, a good balance between two sides could result in an optimal power factor. Indeed, a ZT of 0.71 at 923 K was achieved in BiCuSe0.94Te0.06O, and this value is nearly 1.5 times larger than that of pristine BiCuSeO.
The proposed mechanism is schematically illustrated in Fig. 15(a). As the band gap decreases, a growing number of electrons can be excited across the band gap into the conduction band, leaving the same quantity of holes in the valence band, eventually resulting in promoted electrical conductivity. Experimental evidence of the shrinking band gap due to the replacement of Se by Te in BiCuSeO is provided in Fig. 15(b), in which the electronic absorption spectra of BiCuSe1−xTexO are shown. The absorption edge shifts towards lower energy with increasing Te fraction, and the band gap shows a systematic reduction with increasing Te fraction x, from ∼0.8 eV to ∼0.65 eV in going from x = 0 to 0.2.28

The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of BiCuSe1−xTexO is shown in Fig. 15(c).28 All the curves increase with elevating temperature, showing semiconducting behaviors. The change in electrical conductivity with increasing Te fraction at room temperature is negligible, probably due to neutral impurity scattering of the charge carriers. However, the electrical conductivity shows a significant improvement above 550 K, and reaches ∼40 S cm−1 at 923 K for BiCuSe0.85Te0.15O, which is much larger than that of pristine BiCuSeO (∼15 S cm−1) at the same temperature. The enhancement of the electrical conductivity at high temperature can be attributed to the onset of thermal excitation of electrons across the band gap into the conduction band at ∼550 K. Coupled with low thermal conductivity values, the optimized power factor contributes to a ZT of 0.71 at 923 K in BiCuSe0.94Te0.06O, as shown in Fig. 15(d).28 This is a successful route to improve the thermoelectric performances by tuning the band gap of the BiCuSeO system through Te substitution on the Se site.
Increasing the mobility and performance through sample texturation
The low carrier mobility of ∼22 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature is the bottleneck for pristine BiCuSeO, which greatly limits the improvement of the electrical transport properties and its thermoelectric performance, and even worse, since most of the previous studies focused on the carrier concentration enhancement through various doping, the carrier mobility was further deteriorated due to impurity scattering, even down to 1–2 cm2 V−1 s−1 as the carrier concentration increases up to the order of 1 × 1021 cm−3. As BiCuSeO oxyselenides crystallize in a layered structure, the electrical and thermal transport in the BiCuSeO system should be anisotropic in single crystals, and higher in-plane carrier mobility could be expected. Moreover, in polycrystalline bulk, this intrinsic layered structure leads to the formation of platelet grains, with a preferential orientation due to extrinsic forces; a strong anisotropy of the grain boundary concentration can be achieved between the c-axis and the in-plane direction. This anisotropy (either intrinsic or extrinsic) can be well utilized to improve the carrier mobility.
Sui et al. applied hot-forging processes to obtain textured samples, where the a–b plane of the grains was preferentially oriented perpendicular to the pressing direction through sample deformation under external applied pressure (hot-forging), as depicted in Fig. 16(a). The start-up pellets were synthesized by a conventional two-step solid state reaction route, and the highly textured samples were realized by repeating hot forging processes through the sample deformation within an extra space in a bigger mold.73

The highly textured microstructures after hot-forging processes were confirmed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) detector. It is shown in Fig. 16(b) that the platelet grains are oriented perpendicular to the pressing direction of Bi0.875Ba0.125CuSeO. The grains with red, green and blue color are oriented along [001], [010] and [110] directions, respectively. With increasing number of hot-forging steps, the grains experience slight growth, but the preferential grain orientation along the [001] direction (red color grains) is more and more obvious. The pole figures on the right clearly reflect that the orientation of grains changes from absolute disorder before hot-forging to the [001] direction after hot-forging.73

Fig. 16(c) indicates that the carrier concentration was not influenced by the hot-forging processes, while that the carrier mobility was increased from 2 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the sample without hot-forging to ∼3 cm2 V−1 s−1, ∼3.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 and ∼4.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 after one, two and three hot-forging steps, respectively. The grain orientation could also lead to an increase of the lattice thermal conductivity in the perpendicular direction, which might weaken the benefit from the enhanced electrical conductivity. As can be seen in Fig. 16(d), the ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity was enhanced in the direction perpendicular to the pressing, but impaired in the direction parallel to the pressing. After the hot-forging processes, the ZT measured in the direction parallel to the pressing was reduced, yet improved from ∼1.1 to ∼1.4 at 923 K in the perpendicular direction after three hot-forging steps, Fig. 16(e). This is a record ZT value in the BiCuSeO system, indicating that texturation is a promising technique to effectively improve the thermoelectric performance in the BiCuSeO system. The ZT of 1.4 at 923 K makes BiCuSeO a robust candidate for medium temperature thermoelectric applications.73
6. Theoretical calculations of the thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO
Theoretical calculations of thermoelectric properties were utilized to provide support and guide to experiments. Zou et al. calculated the thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO with different doping levels on the Bi site, and estimated the optimal doping concentration to predict a maximum thermoelectric performance.133 The calculations of electronic transport properties were based on the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in conjunction with rigid band approximation, showing good agreement with experimental data. In this calculation, an energy-independent constant relaxation time approximation was adopted, and the influence of the bands' non-parabolicity on the relaxation time was neglected since it was difficult to derive the relaxation time from ab initio band calculations.
The calculated thermoelectric properties of BiCuSeO as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 17. As shown in Fig. 17(a), the Seebeck coefficient increases monotonously with temperature over the whole range. At a given temperature, the Seebeck coefficient decreases as the doping level increases. The calculated Seebeck coefficient of BiCuSeO agrees well with the experimental data especially above 500 K. The calculated electrical conductivities are shown in Fig. 17(b). The results show that the electrical conductivity decreases with temperature and exhibits a metal-like behavior. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity at a given temperature increases with increasing doping level. It is noteworthy that the deviation of theoretical calculations from experimental observations in the low temperature regime could be ascribed to the over-simplified constant relaxation time approximation.133

To obtain the total thermal conductivity, the lattice thermal conductivity was assumed to obey 1/T Umklapp phonon scattering behavior to fit the experimental data, and the electronic thermal conductivity was given by the Wiedemann–Franz law. The fitted thermal conductivity is plotted in Fig. 17(c), which matches well with the experimental data. It can be seen that the total thermal conductivity decreases with climbing temperature, and increases with elevated carrier concentration.133
With the calculated electrical and thermal transport properties, the figure of merit ZT of p-type BiCuSeO can be obtained as a function of temperature, as shown in Fig. 17(d). The calculations confirm the experimental observations that ZT can be enhanced in the high temperature range (above 600 K) via optimizing the doping level. Theoretically, ZT shows an increasing trend with temperature, and a maximum value of 1.32 is predicted at 1000 K for the 12.5% (elements' doping level on the Bi site) doped BiCuSeO.133 The slightly higher theoretical values come partially from the overestimated electrical conductivity values.
7. Summary and outlook
In this perspective, we have reviewed and summarized the crystal structure, microstructure, electronic structure and physical/chemical properties of BiCuSeO oxyselenides, which have been reported as very promising thermoelectric materials since 2010. BiCuSeO oxyselenides have received ever-increasing attention and have been extensively studied, and the thermoelectric performance ZT was significantly increased from 0.5 for pristine BiCuSeO to 1.4 by texturation of optimally doped materials. The intrinsically low thermal conductivity of BiCuSeO implies that the most effective method to enhance ZT is enhancing the electrical transport properties. In the past three years, many effective approaches were successfully applied in BiCuSeO systems, which include optimizing the carrier concentration through doping, band gap tuning, and increasing the carrier mobility through texturing. If these power factor enhancing approaches were combined together to achieve a synergistic approach, they would probably further improve the performance of these BiCuSeO materials. Despite vast effort on BiCuSeO oxyselenides being devoted, the research on the oxyselenide family as promising thermoelectric materials is still at a relatively infant stage, and thus many fundamental and technical issues remain to be further investigated, which at least include the following.
(1) Novel synergistic approaches need to be developed to further enhance the power factor yet maintaining the low thermal conductivity. Currently several possibilities might be suggestive. For instance, the much anticipated technique of implanting resonance states to increase the Seebeck coefficient and the overall power factor has not yet been realized in BiCuSeO systems. In addition, the effective band convergence in enhancing the Seebeck coefficient in PbTe5 and Mg2Si6 systems can be expected to extend to p-type BiCuSeO systems. Since a high carrier mobility exists in the in-plane direction of the layered structure for BiCuSeO, it can be expected that the carrier mobility in BiCuSeO single crystals will be much higher than that of 22 cm2 V−1 s−1 in BiCuSeO polycrystalline materials, and possibly a high ZT of 2.0 can be achieved in BiCuSeO single crystals. However, the single crystal growth in the BiCuSeO system is extremely challenging with current synthesis technologies.
(2) BiCuSeO belongs to the more general family of LnCuChO (Ln = lanthanide, Ch = S, Se, Te), thus many analogues are worthy exploring; examples include BiCuTeO,109 BiCuSO, LaCuSeO, CeCuSeO, etc.
(3) Since BiCuSeO has a high ZT value over 1, it is still a p-type thermoelectric material. Therefore, an n-type compound based on the BiCuSeO system with a high ZT value is more urgent. Extensive studies are warranted in n-type compounds with layered ZrCuSiAs structures, such as those respectively doped in Bi and Cu sites with elements with positive valences of >3 and >1, or doped in Se and O sites with elements with a negative charge of −1.
(4) Besides the improvement of the thermoelectric performance, studies should be devoted to assessing and understanding the electrode materials, the contact resistance, thermal stability for the high performance and the mechanical properties. These mentioned above are also critical for thermoelectric device fabrication. Understanding mechanical robustness issues in the new high performance materials will help open the path to device assembly, testing and ultimately commercialization.

Broader context
Thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion between thermal and electrical energy. Thermoelectric power generation technology is hopefully expected to crack the alternative energy source development and global climate warming problems by harvesting and converting waste heat into electricity. A new potential thermoelectric material, composed of nontoxic, naturally abundant, light, and cheap elements, is expected to play a vital role in extensive applications for waste heat recovery in a thermally stable atmosphere. This review summarizes and discusses the crystal structures, microstructures, electronic structures, physical and chemical properties, and the effective approaches successfully applied to enhance the thermoelectric performance for BiCuSeO. To date, BiCuSeO has been paid ever-increasing attention and extensively studied since it was reported as a promising thermoelectric material in 2010. The thermoelectric performance ZT was significantly increased from 0.5 to 1.4 in the past three years, which indicates that BiCuSeO oxyselenides are robust thermoelectric candidates for energy conversion applications in the moderate temperature range.
