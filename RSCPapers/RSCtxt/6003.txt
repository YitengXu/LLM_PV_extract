    , Accepted 4th September 2019First published on 4th September 2019AbstractThe exploration of high-performance, cost-effective, and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for future energy storage and conversion technologies. Cobalt-based hydroxides and oxides have been considered as ideal OER electrocatalysts and have been intensively studied; however, their catalytic activity is still unsatisfactory. It is known that the interfacial electron and structure engineering of composite electrocatalysts often results in synergistically enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, a self-supported binary heterogeneous catalyst composed of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se nanosheet arrays vertically grown on carbon cloth has been reported. The heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits excellent activity for the OER in alkaline electrolyte, requiring an overpotential of only 241 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1. These performances are significantly better than those of the bare CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se catalysts. Moreover, the composite electrodes exhibit outstanding durability within 40 h of testing. Our further electrochemical results show that the excellent activities of the heterostructure electrodes should be ascribed to the interfacial coupling effect, increased number of activity sites, accelerated electron transfer, and strong structural stability. This work paves an interesting route for boosting the OER performance of oxide-based electrocatalysts by the regulation of electronic structure through introducing non oxide electrocatalysts for various applications.
1. Introduction
With the ever-increasing concerns about energy crises and serious environmental issues, research on sustainable energy conversion and storage has attracted considerable attention.1–3 Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, especially powered by renewable energy including solar and wind energy, has been widely accepted as one of the most promising strategies for producing clean hydrogen using renewable and abundant water as the source.4 Nevertheless, the major bottleneck for water electrolysis is the anodic half reaction known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a multistep, four proton-coupled electron transfer and uphill reaction suffering from a sluggish kinetics process.5–7 In this case, designing effective and highly active electrocatalysts is highly desired to reduce the overpotential and improve the reaction kinetics of the OER process. Despite noble-metal-based materials such as RuO2 and IrO2 being considered as the most efficacious and robust electrocatalysts for the OER, their scarcity and high price have severely limited practical applications.8,9 Therefore, developing earth-abundant and noble-metal-free based electrocatalysts with high activities and excellent stability are critical for electrochemical water oxidation.10–12
Recently, great effort has been devoted to the development of earth-abundant first-row transition metal-based OER electrocatalysts for water oxidation with high activity, of which oxides/hydroxides are getting special attention due to their outstanding OER performance.13–17 Among them, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) consisting of edge-sharing octahedral MO6 layers have become a class of promising OER catalysts owing to their unique two-dimensional (2D) lamellar structures and intercalated anions.18–21 It has been widely accepted that the eg occupancy of surface transition-metal cations should be close to the unit for ideal OER catalysts, with high covalency of transition metal–oxygen bonds.22 In this regard, the bivalent cobalt ion with a t2g6eg1 electronic configuration possesses the ideal eg filling of OER electrocatalysts.23 Therefore, CoFe LDH with Fe3+ doping has received extensive attention as a promising candidate for efficient OER electrocatalysts.24–27 To further enhance the OER catalytic performance of CoFe LDH, intensive research efforts have been focused on electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) engineering and electronic structure modulating.23,26,28–32 However, the performance of the reported CoFe LDH is still far from those of the benchmark OER electrocatalysts. Hence, further optimizing the electronic structure of CoFe LDH electrocatalysts is essential to improve their electrocatalytic performance.
Recent studies demonstrate that the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities can be enhanced by engineering the interfacial atoms or molecules by coupling with another electrocatalyst, which would trigger electronic or chemical modification at the interface between the two components.32–36 Such a structure design not only regulates the charge transfer of hybrid electrocatalysts but also provides the possibility to utilize the synergistic effect of two different kinds of electrocatalyst to accelerate the performance of water oxidation. Although some Co-based metal oxides have been utilized to couple with CoFe LDH to enhance the OER performance, little effort has been focused on metal selenides, especially cobalt selenides, to rationally design the interfacial structure despite the fact that they also have OER catalytic ability.32,37 It is known that cobalt selenides have better conductivity than the corresponding oxides and consequently show superior ability to improve the OER performance of CoFe LDH. Although CoSe2 is the most commonly studied polymorph of cobalt selenide, the nonstoichiometric phase of Co0.85Se has drawn great attention very recently due to its intrinsic half-metallic character, rendering high conductivity.38,39 Inspired by these promising ideas, we infer that the integrated CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se architectures may further improve the OER performance for water electrolysis. Moreover, from the practical standpoint, self-supported electrocatalysts grown directly on the current collector with binder-free configurations are greatly desirable and represent a promising configuration due to the maximum exposure of the active sites, efficient charge/mass transfer, rapid release of gas bubbles, and good mechanical adhesion. However, to date, no attention has been paid to the rational design of interfacial structures with CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se nanosheet architectures grown directly on a conductive substrate to achieve highly efficient performance for electrocatalytic water oxidation.
In view of these points, here we report the self-supported binary hybrid heterogeneous catalyst, CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se, which was constructed using cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se) nanosheets vertically grown on carbon cloth and then electrodeposition of layered CoFe LDH nanosheets. By applying structural and electronic engineering simultaneously, the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se electrode shows better electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH solution: lower overpotential (241 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and smaller Tafel slope (48 mV dec−1) as compared with those of the bare Co0.85Se/CC and CoFe LDH/CC electrodes. Mechanistic insights into the impact of the heterostructure compared to its single-component counterparts were also provided. More importantly, the composite electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding durability within 40 h of testing. The exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance makes the hybrid CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se highly promising as an alternative to the noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The following chemicals were used as received without any further purification: Co(NO3)3·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·6H2O, NaBH4, Se, and KOH were purchased from Aladdin; IrO2 and Nafion (5 wt%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; carbon cloths (CC) were provided by CeTech Co. Ltd. Deionized water was collected through a Millipore system.
2.2 Synthesis of α-Co(OH)2 on carbon cloth (α-Co(OH)2/CC)
The α-Co(OH)2 nanosheet precursor was prepared by a facile electrodeposition method similar to a previously reported procedure.40 Prior to deposition, CC (1 × 1.6 cm2) was activated in concentrated HNO3 at 100 °C for 1 h, rinsed with deionized water and ethanol, and subsequently dried in air. The electrodeposition process was carried out in a two-electrode system using the cleaned CC and Pt wire as the cathode and anode electrode, respectively. The α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets were deposited on the surface of the CC at a constant cathode current of 8 mA in an electrolyte containing 0.05 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O. After electrodeposition for 20 min, the CC electrodes were withdrawn from the electrolyte, rinsed thoroughly with deionized water several times to remove residual Co2+ on the surface and left to dry in air.
2.3 Synthesis of Co0.85Se/CC
The solvothermal method was used to prepare Co0.85Se nanosheets. Firstly, 20 mg Se powder was dissolved in 1.5 mL deionized water containing 50 mg NaBH4 to obtain fresh NaHSe solution. Secondly, a piece of α-Co(OH)2/CC and the above NaHSe solution were sequentially loaded into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 30 mL N2 saturated absolute ethanol and then heated at 140 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature naturally, the Co0.85Se/CC was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The average loading amount of Co0.85Se on the carbon cloth was calculated to be ∼2.4 mg cm−2.
2.4 Synthesis of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC
The CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC nanocomposite was prepared by the electrodeposition method. Typically, a piece of Co0.85Se/CC and a Pt wire were used as the cathode and anode electrode, respectively. Constant current deposition was carried out at −8 mA for 5 minutes. The electrolyte solution contained 0.05 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O (Co:Fe = 2:1). After reaction, the as-prepared Co0.85Se/CoFe LDH/CC was washed with deionized water to remove residual Co2+ and Fe3+ on the surface and dried at 60 °C for 2 h. The calculated average mass loading was about ∼2.51 mg cm−2.
2.5 Synthesis of CoFe LDH/CC
For a comparative account, CoFe LDH/CC with a similar loading amount of about ∼2.45 mg cm−2 was synthesized using the same protocol for Co0.85Se/CoFe LDH with more Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·6H2O salt for the deposition, except CC instead of Co0.85Se was used as a cathode.
2.6 Characterization
The crystal structure of the samples was identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation). The morphologies and structures of samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta-450 FEG) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010HR). The surface chemical composition and structure were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). All of the XPS spectra were corrected using the C 1s line at 284.6 eV. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured on a Vertex 80 V instrument (Bruker Corp., USA). The specific surface areas of all samples were measured using an automatic physical–chemical isothermal adsorption instrument (Iq-1900, QuantaChrome, USA).
2.7 Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration in 1 M KOH solution controlled by a Zanher IM6 electrochemical workstation. Oxygen gas was bubbled into the electrolyte during the measurement. The as-prepared Co0.85Se/CC, CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC and CoFe LDH/CC served directly as the working electrodes, while a graphite rod and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. All potentials used in the text were converted with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using the following equation: E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.242 V + 0.059 pH. Prior to linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) testing, the working electrodes were electrochemically activated multiple times using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) test at scan rates of 100 mV s−1 and 20 mV s−1. Polarization curves were obtained using linear sweep voltammetry from 1.1 to 1.8 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. All polarization curves were corrected for iR losses through the system. Tafel slopes were derived from the LSV curves by plotting the overpotential η against log(J). The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was evaluated using the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which was obtained through CV measurements in a potential window with no apparent faradaic process occurring at different scan rates of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mV s−1. The frequency of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranged from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at the potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE. The long-term stability test of the electrocatalysts was carried out by applying a constant current density using chronopotentiometric measurements without compensating for iR drop. CV cycling tests were performed at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 from 1.1 V to 1.8 V vs. RHE for 1000 cycles at first, and the final LSV polarization curves were recorded at 2 mV s−1.
The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using the following equation:TOF = (J × A)/(4 × F × N)where J is the measured current density, A is the area of the electrode, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), and N is the number of moles of Co on the electrode.
Commercially available IrO2 nanopowder was chosen as the benchmark electrocatalyst for the OER for comparison. The catalysts were mixed with water/ethanol and Nafion to form a homogeneous ink and then coated onto a preprocessed carbon cloth. Finally, the sample was dried under ambient conditions. The catalyst loading was about 2.5 mg cm−2, similar to that of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se on CC.
3. Results and discussion
The CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrodes were successfully synthesized by a simple three-step electrodeposition–selenization–electrodeposition method, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Carbon cloth was used as a binder-free substrate for catalysts and also current collector. Firstly, the α-Co(OH)2 nanosheet precursor was synthesized by electrodeposition in a Co(NO3)2·6H2O solution under constant current conditions. Then, the as-obtained α-Co(OH)2 nanosheets were converted to Co0.85Se by a solvothermal selenization process. Finally, the CoFe LDH nanosheet layer was electrodeposited onto the surface of Co0.85Se, leading to the formation of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC nanosheet array electrocatalysts.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se on carbon cloth. 
The crystallographic texture and phase composition of the as-prepared α-Co(OH)2/CC, Co0.85Se/CC, CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC and CoFe LDH/CC were identified by X-ray diffraction measurements, as shown in Fig. 2. All of the samples have a broadened peak located at ∼25°, corresponding to the diffraction characteristic of carbon cloth. For the α-Co(OH)2 precursor, all the characteristic diffraction peaks are consistent with the hexagonal phase of cobalt nitrate hydroxide (JCPDS no. 46-0605), respectively indexed to the (003), (100), and (110) lattice planes. After selenization by the solvothermal method, the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 33.3°, 45.2° and 51.4° are well indexed to the (101), (102) and (110) planes of Co0.85Se, respectively (JCPDS No. 52-1008). Compared to the precursor α-Co(OH)2 nanosheet, there is no impurity diffraction peak in the Co0.85Se phase. In addition, in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S1†), a significant vibrational peak at 1380 cm−1 for NO3− in the α-Co(OH)2 intercalation layer almost completely disappears after solvothermal selenization. The above results demonstrate that the selenization method employed can successfully convert α-Co(OH)2 to Co0.85Se. After further deposition of CoFe LDH, the diffraction pattern is almost the same as that of Co0.85Se. However, a new diffraction peak at 11.65 has emerged, which should correspond to the (003) plane of CoFe LDH (JCPDS No. 50-0235), indicating the formation of a hybrid of Co0.85Se and CoFe LDH. Due to the weak crystallinity of the CoFe LDH and overlapping with the peaks of Co0.85Se and carbon cloth, only the (003) plane of CoFe LDH could be observed.

The morphology and microstructure of the α-Co(OH)2, Co0.85Se, CoFe LDH and the corresponding CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC nanohybrids were further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrodeposited α-Co(OH)2 is composed of vertically aligned nanosheets (Fig. S2a and b†), which are commonly observed of hydroxides. Typical SEM images (Fig. 3a and S2c†) demonstrate that Co0.85Se nanosheets were grown uniformly on the surface of the carbon cloth with a thickness of about 20–30 nm. Fig. 3b shows the bare electrodeposited CoFe LDH, which has a similar micro-morphology to but smaller size than that of Co0.85Se (Fig. S2d†), while for Co0.85Se nanosheets hybridized with CoFe LDH (Fig. 3c and S2e and f†), much smaller CoFe LDH nanosheets with a thickness of about 2 nm are uniformly grown on the surface of the Co0.85Se substrate, and element mappings (Fig. S3†) indicate the uniform distribution of Co, Fe, Se and O elements. Furthermore, this heterostructure can be seen clearly from the TEM image of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC (Fig. 3d and e). The interfacial region of CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se was observed by high-resolution TEM; the lattice spacing of 0.27 nm was attributed to the (101) plane of Co0.85Se, and the lattice spacing of 0.23 nm was attributed to the (015) crystal plane of CoFe LDH, as shown in Fig. 3f. In addition, these nanosheets were vertically oriented on the substrate and interconnected with each other, forming a hierarchical network that maximized the electrochemically active surface area and offered a high electrode/electrolyte interface area.41,42 The results of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement (Table S1†) demonstrate that the three samples have a similar specific surface area.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to reveal not only the chemical states of the CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se but also the electronic interaction between them. The XPS spectrum survey confirms the presence of Co, Fe, Se, O and C in the product of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC (Fig. S4†), which is consistent with EDS results (Fig. S2g†). Fig. 4a shows the Co 2p XPS spectra for CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC, and the spectra were divided into six species, including Co3+ fitting peaks centered at 778.5 eV (2p3/2) and 794.5 eV (2p1/2), Co2+ fitting peaks centered at 780.4 eV (2p3/2) and 796.1 eV (2p1/2), and their shakeup satellites (denoted as Sat.), confirming the coexistence of Co3+ and Co2+ in the hybrid.43 Such six peaks are also observed for pure Co0.85Se/CC, confirming that the CoFe LDH on the surface of the heterostructure did not completely block the XPS signal of the Co0.85Se nanosheets. Obviously, compared with the binding energies of Co0.85Se/CC, the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC show negative shifts of 0.5 and 0.3 eV toward lower binding energies, respectively, suggesting a lower oxidation valence state of Co0.85Se in the composite.44 Similarly, the Fe 2p of the CoFe LDH/CC energy region (Fig. 4b) could be resolved with two peaks at 712 and 725 eV, consistent with the binding energy of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, suggesting that the valence state of Fe is a high oxidation state (Fe3+).6 However, the Fe 2p of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC reveals positive shifts of 0.6 (Fe 2p3/2 to 712.6 eV) and 0.7 eV (Fe 2p1/2 to 725.7 eV), indicating the strong electronic interactions at the interface between CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se.32 Such a strong electronic interaction between CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se could possibly enhance the OER performance of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC composite.45,46 In addition, the electron cloud migration shows the nature of the strong coupling effect in CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC, which prompts abundant high valence state Co ions present in the composites. The increased population of Co ions with higher valence state (Co3+) is highly valuable for enhancement of the OER electrocatalytic activity.

To evaluate the catalytic activity of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC for OER, an electrochemical test was performed in O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte solution using a three-electrode quartz electrolytic cell. For comparison, Co0.85Se/CC, CoFe LDH/CC and commercial IrO2 coated on bare CC with the same quality loading were also tested under the same conditions. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve with iR correction in Fig. 5a shows that the overpotential of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrode to drive the current density (j) of 10 mA cm−2 is only 241 mV, which is obviously superior to those of the CoFe LDH/CC (299 mV) and Co0.85Se/CC (287 mV) electrodes. It should be noted that a low overpotential at a large current density for a rapid OER electrocatalyst is practically valuable. The overpotential for the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrode at 300 mA cm−2 is about 355 mV, which is far below that of CoFe LDH/CC and Co0.85Se/CC. In addition, the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC surpasses the state-of-the-art IrO2 OER catalysts. The excellent OER performance of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC is also better than that of recently reported high-performance electrocatalysts, as shown in Table S2.† The Tafel slope is frequently used to assess the OER kinetics, and the data were calculated from the steady-state current density. It could be declared that a smaller Tafel slope indicates the rate-determining step at the end of the multiple-electron transfer reaction, which is commonly a sign of a good electrocatalyst.10 In addition, a smaller Tafel slope is more beneficial to practical water oxidation because it leads to a more rapidly increased OER current with increasing overpotential. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the outstanding catalytic kinetics of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC was confirmed by the lowest Tafel slope, which was only 48 mV dec−1, substantially lower than that of Co0.85Se (79 mV dec−1) and CoFe LDH (50 mV dec−1). Thus, the low Tafel slope implies that the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC follows a faster OER kinetics.

In order to elucidate the possible origins of such an extraordinary OER performance, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were investigated to determine the double-layer capacitance (Cdl), which is proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). As shown in Fig. 6a, the double-layer capacitance of Co0.85Se/CC, CoFe LDH/CC, and CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC was calculated using the CV curves (Fig. S5†), in which potential ranges have no apparent faradaic process occurring. It is easy to observe that the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrode possesses the highest Cdl of 74 mF cm−2, which is nearly 2.4 and 3.2 times that of the pure Co0.85Se/CC (31 mF cm−2) and CoFe LDH/CC (24 mF cm−2), respectively, suggesting the improved ECSA and more exposure of the active sites achieved by the coupling of CoFe LDH with Co0.85Se. The large ECSAs are beneficial to the water molecule adsorption and intimate contact between the solid–liquid interfaces, along with abundant active sites for catalytic reactions, which may account for the intensified electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, to exclude the contribution of ECSA for the OER performance, the normalized LSV curves were obtained by dividing their corresponding Cdl for the original LSV curves (Fig. 5a), as shown in Fig. 6b. The results indicate that the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC has the lowest overpotential at a given normalized current density among the three samples, demonstrating that the enhanced OER activity is attributed not only to the increased ECSA but also to the improved modification electron structure possibly caused by the synergy mechanism of the heterostructure.

(c) Nyquist plots for the OER tested at 1.5 V (vs. RHE). (d) Comparison of TOF values calculated at overpotential η = 350 mV. 
Meanwhile, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to study the electrode kinetics of the OER catalysts, and the smaller Rct reveals the desirable electron transport and catalytic kinetics behavior of the catalysts.47 As shown in Fig. 6c, the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrode possesses a much smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of ∼2.9 Ω, in contrast to that of the pure Co0.85Se/CC (4.6 Ω) and CoFe LDH/CC (16.5 Ω), indicating that the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC electrode has a better charge-transfer capacity during the OER process. The coupling of CoFe LDH and Co0.85Se may account for the highest evolution kinetics, which is consistent with the smallest Tafel slope. In addition, the inset in Fig. 6c shows the enlarged EIS curves of the small resistance region, which exhibits that CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC and Co0.85Se/CC electrodes have smaller series resistances (Rs), suggesting good electrical contacts to the substrate.48 The superior intrinsic activity for CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC was also evidenced by the remarkable improvement of the turnover frequency (TOF) using these data (Fig. S6†). The TOF of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC is the highest among the three samples, supporting the high intrinsic activity of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC. All the above measurements confirm that the hybrid CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC is intrinsically more active than CoFe LDH/CC and Co0.85Se/CC alone, resulting in the improved OER performance.
In addition to the high catalytic activity, the operating stability also plays a key role in industrial application. The stability of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC in 1 M KOH solution was tested at the OER current of 10 mA cm−2 for 40 hours (Fig. 7a). The overpotential was maintained constant and only increased from the initial 1.49 V to 1.51 V (without iR correction) during the whole test, suggesting its good catalytic stability under OER conditions. Meanwhile, the polarization curve of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC (inset of Fig. 7a) almost overlaps with the initial one after 1000 cycles of CV. In addition, the excellent OER performance of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se was evidenced by multistep chronopotentiometric (CP) measurement (Fig. 3d). The current density was increased from 10 to 500 mA cm−2 with a current step of 50 mA cm−2 every 500 s. During each CP period, a very stable OER potential was observed quickly with negligible fluctuation. Moreover, the EIS curves before and after the OER indicate that Rct only increased by ∼0.53 Ω after the test (Fig. S7†), proving that the catalyst can maintain efficient charge transfer efficiency during long-term testing. These results indicate excellent mass transport, high efficiency charge-transfer and fast gas dissipation of the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC nanosheet arrays.38,49 The excellent durability of such a self-supported heterostructure may be ascribed to the direct growth of Co0.85Se on CC and the firm grasp of the CoFe LDH shell on the surface of the Co0.85Se nanosheet arrays, which can be confirmed by the following characterization.

(b) Multistep chronopotentiometric curves of the conditioned CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC at varying current densities (from 10 to 500 mA cm−2) without iR correction. 
In order to further realize the possible morphological or structural changes of the post-OER catalyst, many characterization methods including SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS were performed. Compared with the initial CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC, the intensity of the peaks corresponding to (101) and (102) reduces greatly, indicating the decrease of crystallinity and no formation of a new crystalline phase (Fig. S8†). The SEM images (Fig. S9a and b†) indicate that the surface of the nanosheets becomes rougher than that of the sample before the OER, while the morphology of the nanosheets remains after long-term OER measurement. In addition, the post element mappings (Fig. S10†) indicate that Co, Fe, Se, and O are still uniformly distributed. Moreover, the EDS spectra in Fig. S9c† shows that the ratio of Se/O decreases greatly, indicating the formation of amorphous metal oxide/oxyhydroxides after the OER. XPS before and after the OER (Fig. S11†) reveals that Co2+ and Co3+ coexist in the hybrid which is similar to the fresh catalyst. In addition, the peak position for Co 2p3/2 has been shifted toward higher binding energy, indicating that Co was oxidized under alkaline OER conditions. The post Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. S11c†) could be resolved with two peaks at 712.7 and 725.7 eV, suggesting the persistence of the Fe3+ state. In Fig. S11e,† the O 1s spectrum after the OER not only shows the characteristic peaks of H–O–H (533.1 eV) and M–OH (531.2 eV), but also exhibits a new peak of M–O at 529.7 eV. Furthermore, a significant vibrational peak attributed to CoOOH appears at 580 cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum after the OER (Fig. S11f†).50 All of above results confirm that CoFe LDH is still anchored on the surface of Co0.85Se and the surface of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC is transformed to metal oxide/oxyhydroxide after OER measurements, which generates the OER electrocatalytically active species.36,46,51 Despite the surface chemical composition changes after the OER, the CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC maintains the nanosheet structure and crystalline phase of Co0.85Se, which may be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the interface interaction in the composite.
Conclusions
In summary, the binary hybrid heterogeneous catalyst of CoFe LDH/Co0.85Se/CC composite was prepared via a simple electrodeposition on the cobalt selenide electrode. Such an electrode exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential of (241 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slope of 48 mV dec−1 as well as shows excellent durability in alkaline medium. This excellent performance may be ascribed to the following several reasons: (i) improvement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities by the electronic interaction effect between Co0.85Se and the unique layered structure of CoFe LDH; (ii) the formation of an amorphous oxide/hydroxide layer generates efficient electrocatalytically active species for the OER; (iii) more active sites are exposed for the heterostructures; (iv) the excellent electrical conductivity of Co0.85Se favors the electron transfer; (v) directly growing on carbon cloth endows the electrode excellent mechanical adhesion and rapid releasing of gas bubbles under high current. Moreover, this cost-effective hybrid structure with electronic coupling effect may point a new avenue to design and explore other novel hybrid materials as efficient catalysts for renewable energy applications.
