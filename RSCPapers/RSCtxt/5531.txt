    , Accepted 4th January 2022First published on 14th January 2022AbstractEngineering a highly accessible semiconductor with optimized physicochemical structure for efficient photocatalysis under visible light is never-ending. Herein, a facile route was developed to fabricate a caterpillar-like ZnO–C (ZC) hollow nanocomposite by directly pyrolyzing Zn-BTC MOF microrods and nanorods, which have been previously synthesized via a rapid supersonic-assisted aqueous reaction at room temperature. It is demonstrated that the ZC nanorods radically grow on the surface of the hollow nanocomposite directly converted from MOF-microrods at 550 °C and form a caterpillar-like catalyst based on an oriented attachment mechanism. After in situ photo-reduction of AgNO3, the Ag–ZnO–C (AZC550) nanocomposite catalyst possesses ultrahigh photodegradation turnover frequency (TOF) values towards methyl blue (3.00 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1), 4-nitrophenol (0.14 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1) and amoxicillin (3.43 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1), as well as a photo-inactivation activity of 6.25 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1 towards E. coli, outperforming most state-of-the-art catalysts reported thus far. The ameliorated photocatalytic performance and recyclability can be assigned to the synergistic effects between the Zn–C hierarchical nanoarchitecture and Ag-NPs. This work provides a new approach for the design of efficient solar photocatalysts.

Environmental significance
Engineering a highly accessible semiconductor with an optimized physicochemical structure for efficient environment applications, such as the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms under visible light, is never-ending. This work reports a facile strategy for pyrolyzing Zn-BTC MOF microrods and nanorods and the in situ photoreduction of AgNO3 to prepare a caterpillar-like Ag–ZnO–C (AZC) hollow nanocomposite. The ameliorated solar photocatalytic degradation and disinfection performance over the nanoarchitecture is superior to most of the values in the reported literature, which is the combined result of the adsorption and photoelectrochemical properties of the present nanomaterial, and is synergistically affected by the hierarchical structure of C-doped ZnO, the carbon matrix and Ag-NPs.

1 Introduction
Employing natural solar irradiation to excite semiconductor mediated heterogeneous photocatalysts is promising and efficient1 for the degradation of organic pollutants (such as phenols, pesticides, dyes, and solvents)2 and the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms.3 When a photocatalyst absorbs light with energy equal to or greater than its band gap, electron–hole pairs are generated that separately react with water and dissolve oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).4 These ROS are strong oxidants that degrade organic contaminants and disinfect pathogens by damaging their functional groups or macromolecules.3 Engineering highly accessible semiconductors with optimized structures and chemical compositions to promote photocatalytic activity under visible light is never-ending. ZnO is the most widely used and is still one of the most attractive wide band-gap (Eg ∼ 3.3 eV at 300 K) photocatalysts, with advantages including relatively low cost, facile preparation, and stability under light irradiation.5 However, the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO is its main drawback and of major concern due to the high recombination ratio of its photoinduced electron–hole pairs, very poor response to visible light and high possibility of the photo-corrosion.6
To solve this problem, a widely adopted approach is to combine ZnO with other materials that act as an electron sink to eliminate or slow down the recombination process of photo-induced electron–hole pairs.7 These materials normally include carbon-based materials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon nanodots, C3N4),7–11 metal nanoparticles7,12 and their compound systems,13 which have been used as electron sinks to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO. Besides this, the synergetic effect between these dopants and ZnO in the form of diverse nanoarchitectures is another factor that facilitates the photocatalytic properties of ZnO-based composites.13 To manipulate the structures of ZnO-based composites, one of the ways that has actively been achieved over recent years has been the carbonization of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their advantages including high surface area, versatile porous structures, and highly-tunable chemical compositions.8,14,15 Aside from pristine MOF structures, MOF-derived nanomaterials also present a series of exquisite structures, including multi-shelled or hierarchically porous14 or urchin-like morphologies.16 Derived nanomaterials generally inherit, but are not limited to, the physicochemical structures of MOFs. The structure of the former is finally determined by comprehensive factors such as internal factor (metal ion-organic linker framework features), apparent factor (size and morphology of MOFs) and the pyrolysis factor (temperature and time).17 Thus, the efficient integration and modulation of the above-mentioned factors is crucial to the function implementation of MOFs-derived materials. For instance, sintering Zn/Co-ZIF at 600 °C generates ZnO@C–N–Co core–shell hybrids that show improved photocatalytic performance and excellent recyclability.18 Utilizing 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) in the synthesis process of MOFs, porous Cu/Zn-NPs@carbon materials,19 and ZnO–C composite microparticles20 have been successfully prepared via the carbonization of MOF precursors. However, even though BTC possesses three carboxylate groups and one benzene ring beneficial to the multiplicity of MOF structures, due to their lack of size and morphology control, Zn-BTC based MOFs tend to be converted to bulk phase materials featuring a low number of exposed active metal sites.21
Herein, we present a new and effective strategy to synthesize a hierarchical Ag–ZnO–C (AZC) hybrid hollow nanocomposite comprising plentiful nanorods, nanoparticles and nanosheets. Zn-MOF nanorods were firstly obtained via a reaction between ZnCl2 and BTC in aqueous solution at room temperature in a short time. After controlling the conditions of carbonization, a caterpillar-like ZnO–C (ZC) hollow nanocomposite was gained based on an “oriented attachment” mechanism at 550 °C. The resultant nanocomposite was further employed to immobilize Ag nanoparticles on its surface via a photo-deposition method. The as-prepared hybrid material AZC presents excellent comprehensive photocatalytic properties, including the degradation of organic contaminants (methylene blue (MB), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and amoxicillin (AMX)) and inactivation performance against bacteria (E. coli). The synergistic effects of structure and composition on the properties were also analyzed, implying the superiority of the present strategy in the application of water treatment.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
1,3,5-Benzoic acid (98%) was obtained from Aladdin. Ethanol was purchased from Sinopharm. Sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, silver nitrate, zinc chloride and MB trihydrate, 4-NP and AMX (≥98%) were all of analytical grade and used without further purification. PVA-co-PE nanofibrous membrane (nominal pore size: 0.1 μm) was obtained from We-change Tech. Co. Ltd. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was purchased from Nanjing Bianzhen Biotech. Co., Ltd.
2.2 Synthesis of the Zn-BTC MOF rods
The process for the synthesis of Zn-BTC MOF rods is shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, BTC (0.105 g) and NaOH (0.06 g) were dissolved in 40 ml of green solvent containing 25 ml of deionized water and 15 ml of ethanol. Then, ZnCl2 (0.83 mmol) was evenly dripped into the above mixed solution. After 0.5 h of ultrasonication, Zn-BTC MOF rods formed as a white powder. Finally, the powder was washed with ethanol and deionized water three times and dried until it reached a constant weight before its further use. For comparison, pure Zn-BTC nanorods (Zn-BTC-nano) were synthesized under similar conditions in 5 min. Pure Zn-BTC microrods (Zn-BTC-micro) were obtained by directly mixing the above ZnCl2 and BTC solutions over 30 min of ultrasonication.

2.3 Preparation of the ZnO–C (ZC) catalysts
Zn-BTC MOF rods were pyrolyzed at different temperatures (450, 500, 550 and 600 °C) for 2 h after heating at a temperature rate of 5 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the Zn-BTC MOF derived material ZnO–C (ZC) nanocomposite as a black material was obtained as a catalyst. In this study, four samples were prepared: ZnO–C-450 (ZC450), ZnO–C-500 (ZC500), ZnO–C-550 (ZC550) and ZnO–C-600 (ZC600).
2.4 Preparation of the Ag–ZnO–C (AZC) catalysts
ZnO–C (ZC) nanocomposite was surface decorated with silver nanoparticles via a photoinduced in situ reduction method. In this process, 0.0138 g of AgNO3 was added to 50 mL of deionized water and stirred to achieve a homogeneous solution. Then, 1 g of ZnO–C (ZC) nanocomposite black powder was further immersed in the above solution and well dispersed under ultrasonication. Next, the suspension was then kept in a transparent small beaker, which was placed under a Hernia lamp (300 W) for 1 h with a light intensity set to 100 mW cm−2. Finally, AZC black powder was collected as a catalyst after being cleaned with deionized water three times.
2.5 Preparation of ZnO nanorod control
In a typical procedure, 7.6 mmol of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 2.43 g of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water with rigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then kept in a 500 ml reaction still and heated at 140 °C for 12 h in a vacuum drying oven. Next, the white powder was washed three times with deionized water and centrifuged at 10000 r min−1 for 5 min. Finally, the white powder of ZnO-nanorods was suspended in 20 ml in ethanol under ultrasonication and kept for further use.
2.6 Characterization
A JEOL JSM-7800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer was used to collect SEM images and emission SEM elemental distribution mapping images of the membrane samples. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL 2100PLUS transmission electron microscope.
Detailed information about the crystalline structure of the photocatalysts was collected using a wide-angle X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex600, Rigaku, Japan), recorded from 10° to 90° with a step width of 0.02°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was acquired using a VG MultiLab 2000 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Electron Corporation) employing Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) radiation as the excitation source.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the samples were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (model: UV-2550, Shimadzu, China). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured using an EMXnano instrument (Bruker, Germany) employing 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a radical spin trap. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the samples were analyzed on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-380, Tianjin Gangdong, China). The zeta potentials of the samples were measured using a Zetasizer Nano series system (Nano ZS, ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments Ltd. UK). The N2 sorption isotherms were measured on a surface area analyzer (Micrometrics, ASPS2020, USA) at 353 K. From the adsorption branch of the isotherm curves, the specific surface areas of the samples were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model.
Pyrolysis of the MOF samples was performed and comparisons were made using a thermobalance (NETZSCH STA 449F5). Thermogravimetric analysis and derivative thermogravimetry (TGA and DTG) of the samples was carried out by heating approximately 3.0 mg of each sample in an alumina crucible at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 1000 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The gases that evolved in the TG chamber were channeled to a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (THERMOFISHER, Nicolet is10) using a DTGS-KBr detector. Each IR spectrum was obtained by averaging 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and scanning from 4000 to 450 cm−1.
2.7 Photocatalytic degradation tests
The as-prepared catalyst (5 mg) was immersed in 15 ml of MB solution (20 mg L−1) in a transparent small beaker with vigorous stirring and then kept in the dark for 1 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium before illumination. The photodegradation capability of the catalyst was evaluated by detecting the variation in the concentration of MB with time after illumination. The catalysis testing was performed when the beaker was exposed to visible light (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co., Ltd, Microsolar300, 300 W, 11 A). The applied lamp provides sun-like irradiation with a spectral radiation power distribution at wavelengths between 380 and 780 nm. In the process of photodegradation, 2 ml of MB solution was withdrawn at regular intervals of time (5 min). The concentration of MB was determined by the UV-vis spectrophotometer, where time-dependent absorption intensity of the peak at 664 nm was observed. In this study, MB solutions with a concentration of 5 mg L−1 and 50 mg L−1 were also investigated.
Using the same method, the photodegradation performance of the catalysts toward 4-NP and AMX were also investigated. The adopted concentrations of 4-NP and AMX were 1 g L−1 and 0.09 g L−1, respectively. In particular, the dosages of the catalysts and contaminant solutions were 1 mg and 3 mL, separately. The sampling time interval of the contaminant solution was extended to 30 min for 4-NP and 10 min for AMX. The mineralization degrees of AMX were examined by total organic carbon analysis (TOC-Lcsh/csn, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Degradation byproducts of AMX produced during their photo-induced degradation were monitored by an UHPLC Dionex Ultimate 3000 with Q-Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer system (Ultimate 3000 UHPLC-Q Exactive, Thermo Scientific, US). The Q-Exactive mass spectrometer was equipped with a heat electrospray ionization (HESI) instrument, an online vacuum degasser, a quaternary pump, an autosampler and a thermostated column compartment. The test parameters are presented in the ESI.† The evolution of the ionic species (NO3− and SO42−) formed during the AMX degradation were detected by an ion chromatograph (Thermo Electron Instruments Co., Ltd., iCS-5000, US).
2.8 Photocatalytic inactivation tests
To better evaluate the photocatalytic inactivation performance of the catalysts, PVA-co-PE nanofibrous membrane (NFM) with a diameter of 3.8 cm was employed to collect and immobilize the powder-like catalyst. Catalyst with a weight of 4 mg was firstly dispersed in ethanol to obtain a stable suspension. Next, all the catalyst powder was collected on the surface of the membrane by filtering the suspension with the assistance of a vacuum pump. Finally, the membrane covered by catalyst powder was dried in an oven at 80 °C for further use.
A Gram-negative bacteria E. coli strain was chosen as a model pathogen for the antibacterial properties testing. Bacterial suspensions were prepared by incubating E. coli overnight in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C. The bacteria cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) to remove residual nutrients. The concentration of the final culture was controlled to be around 106 cfu mL−1. All glass apparatus and solutions used in the experiments were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min prior to their use to ensure sterility. The photo-antibacterial properties of the membrane covered by AZC550 and the pristine membrane were evaluated. The composite membranes were immersed in 50 ml of E. coli solution (106 cfu mL−1) and then subjected to solar irradiation provided by a solar simulator (ultra-vitalux lamp, 300 W) with the light intensity set to 100 mW cm−2 for around 20 min. The disinfection properties of the composite membrane was evaluated by assessing the inactivation of E. coli. To distinguish the effect of light on the antibacterial activity, inactivation tests in a dark environment were also performed under the same conditions, in the absence of light. After the tests, 1 μL of E. coli solution was transferred onto an agar plate and incubated for 24 h. The number of viable cells on the agar plates was determined using a plate counting method.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of caterpillar-like catalysts
To obtain a high-performance photocatalyst, we firstly synthesized a Zn-BTC MOF with a Zn-containing rod structure, which was expected to generate a material with the desired structure. Here, the organic bridging linker 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (1,3,5-BTC) was adopted to act as a template. After rapid reaction for around 30 min, as shown in Fig. 1, the as-synthesized Zn-BTC MOF presents a rod-like morphology on two scales, microrods (1–3 μm) and nanorods (100–200 nm) (Fig. 1a and S1c–f†), while almost only nanorods and rods with a wide diameter range can be obtained when reacted for 5 and 15 min (Fig. S1a and b†), respectively. The product is crystalline with hexagonal R3c symmetry,22 as illustrated in Fig. S6a.† Therein, the Zn atom is coordinated to oxygen atoms of 1,3,5-BTC ligands to build up ZnO4 and ZnO6 polyhedral chains,23 which favors the formation of a 1D structure and thus benefits the anisotropic nucleation of the present MOF precursor.
After pyrolysis for 2 h at 550 °C, the color of the MOF samples changed from white to black, indicating the prominent variation in the structure and composition inside of the materials. A caterpillar-like hierarchical hollow nanocomposite ZC550 can be distinctly observed, as shown in Fig. 1b and 3e, where radically-grown nanorods possess crystalline ZnO nanodomains distributed in an amorphous carbon matrix (Fig. 2d and h). After the immobilization of Ag on ZC, the black powder AZC-550 still maintains its caterpillar-like morphology (Fig. 1c and 2a) with Ag NPs distributed on the surface of its hollow trunk part (Fig. 2e–g). The chaeta part of the nanocomposite presents a similar size, with the diameter of MOF nanorods in the range of 100–200 nm. While the trunk part of the as-obtained hollow nanocomposite possesses a diameter of around 4 μm larger than the microrods of the precursor MOFs. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2i reveals the polycrystalline nature of the hollow nanocomposite, with a combination of a hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure and face-centred cubic (FCC) Ag structure,24,25 which is consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 2k). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping indicates that Zn, O, C and Ag are the main elemental components (Fig. 2j), while no obvious peak attributable to crystalline carbon can be observed in the XRD pattern. This is mainly because the carbon atoms are amorphous or doped in a crystalline/noncrystalline Zn–O–C domain (Fig. 2e–h and 3a). Amorphous carbon has been previously demonstrated to be the main matrix of composite materials evolved from BTC-linked MOFs.19

(h) Proposed formation process of caterpillar-like ZC550 based on an oriented attachment (OA) mechanism at high temperature. 
It was also found that the morphology of the MOF derivative was sensitive to the pyrolysis conditions. Below 550 °C, only microcluster rods were obtained with a rough surface consisting of abundant nanosheets and nanoparticles (Fig. 3d and S3a and b†), which is also evidenced by the TG and DSC curves shown in Fig. S5c† that the temperature range above around 500 °C is suitable for the calcination of the present MOF materials. ZC550 possesses a hierarchical structure (Fig. S2 and S3c†) with a high specific surface area (Fig. 4i, Table S1†) rather than the samples pyrolyzed at other temperatures, resulting in it showing the best adsorption capability and photocatalytic degradation performance towards organic contaminants (Fig. 4 and 5). The collapsed structure of ZC600 is mainly due to excessive decomposition at high temperature. This motivated us to synthetically investigate the structure of ZC550 and its derivative AZC550 as well as their wide applicability in photocatalytic degradation and disinfection.

The intense diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of the photocatalysts illustrate that the as-synthesized products exhibit high crystallinity, as shown in Fig. 2k. The main diffraction peaks of ZC550 and AZC-550 are consistent with those of ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 36-1451), where the typical hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO shows peaks at 31.7°, 34.5°, 36.2°, 47.7°, 56.84°, 63.0°, 68.1° corresponding to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103) and (112) planes,25 respectively. Furthermore, AZC550 reveals three additional diffraction peaks at 38.2°, 44.2° and 64.5° that can be assigned to the (111), (200), and (220) crystal planes of FCC metallic silver.24 In addition, there was no remarkable shift in the diffraction peaks, indicating that silver atoms were decorated on the surface of ZnO and excluding the possibility of their incorporation in the ZnO structure by substituting Zn sites.
The surface chemical composition and chemical states of the catalysts were investigated by XPS. The XPS survey spectra in Fig. 3a indicate that ZnO, ZC550 and AZC550 are composed of the corresponding elements as expected. No other impurity elements were observed. Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution Zn 2p spectra, with specific peaks at 1021.1 ± 0.03 eV for 2p3/2 and 1044.2 ± 0.03 eV for 2p1/2, indicating the oxidation state of Zn2+ in the form of ZnO in the materials. The blue shift in the Zn 2p peaks to 1022.43 eV could be attributed to Zn–O–C bonds, which present a small difference in binding energy (BE) to the Zn–O–Zn peak (1.33–1.53 eV) due to the electronegativity difference between Zn (χZn = 1.65) and C (χC = 2.55).26 This indicates the successful doping of carbon into the ZnO lattice during the pyrolysis process of the MOFs.27 The peak at 529.90 eV in the O1s spectrum corresponds to the lattice oxygen in ZnO, while the peak at 531.48 eV can be attributed to chemisorbed –OH groups in ZnO.26,27 The spectrum of ZnO–C and the deconvoluted peaks located at BE are completely different to those of pure ZnO, mainly due to the doping of carbon in ZnO. The two components centered at around 531.20 and 532.58 eV can be assigned to Zn–O–C and C–O and/or C–O–C bonds.26 Finally, the peak located at around 534.08 eV may be associated with COOR or COOH group surface contamination.28 The C 1s spectra of the samples ZC500 and AZC500 show a main peak at 283.90 eV, which can be assigned to Zn–C bonding.27 The high intensity of this peak shows that there is a large amount of carbon doped into the ZnO lattice. The second-highest deconvoluted peak of C1s is located at 284.86 eV, which is attributed to free graphitic carbon,26 suggesting that the coexistence of carbon-doped ZnO and pure carbon in the nanocomposite, as shown in the TEM images in Fig. 2e and f. The component located at around 286.00 eV suggests the formation of Zn–O–C bonds, while the peak located at 287.02 eV can be assigned to a O–C–O complex.26 The peak at around 288.60 eV, especially for Zn–C-550, can be attributed to the residual structural species of carbon in the form of COOR or COOH bonding and/or adsorption of surface CO2.29 The peak at around 290.8 eV is mainly due to π–π interactions in the aromatic rings.26 The difference in this peak between ZC550 and AZC550 can be assigned to the photocatalytic degradation of COOR by ZnO–C during the in situ reduction of the Ag-NPs,30 which presents the feature of elemental silver, consistent with the decreased oxygen content in AZC550 (Table S2†).
3.2 Mechanism study of the formation of caterpillar-like catalysts
Through calcination at 550 °C, the obtained ZC materials present a hollow caterpillar-like structure, probably originating from the collapse of MOF microrods and the “oriented attachment” based growth of ZnO–C nanorods. Firstly, due to their micro-sized diameter, a temperature gradient is generated from the surface to the center of the microrods. As a result, the surface components of the MOFs preferentially transfer to the inorganic crystalline phase of the ZnO–C composite in the form of nanoparticles and nanosheets (see Fig. 2e and S5†), accompanied by a release of CO2 and H2O (Fig. 3c and S8†).31 During the calcination process, the weight loss and relocation of the outside shell of the MOF (Fig. 3b and d and S7†) generated abundant vacancies for the outward diffusion of carbon, oxygen and the even larger Zn ions, which further reacted with each other to promote shell thickness and finally produce a larger hollow cavity.14
Secondly, as the temperature rose to around 550 °C, the amount of CO2 and H2O released dramatically increased (Fig. 3c and S8†), and the Zn-BTC MOF nanorods were converted into a Zn-rich ZnO–C nanoarchitecture. In sequence, radicalized ZnO–C nanorods further grew on the nanoarchitecture driven by an “oriented attachment” mechanism32 with the assistance of released CO2 and Zn vapor during the decomposition of the Zn-BTC microrods,33,34 as shown in Fig. 3h. We proposed that the coexistence of Zn-BTC microrods (Zn-BTC-micro) and nanorods (Zn-BTC-nano) is essential for the formation of hollow caterpillar-like ZC-550. Only hollow micro-clusters or nanoparticles alone can be obtained by pyrolyzing Zn-BTC-micro or Zn-BTC-nano, respectively (Fig. 3e and S9†). We found that Zn-BTC-nano released more CO2 and H2O than that of the microrods (Fig. 3c and S8†), mainly due to their difference in diameter and the resultant degree of decomposition difference between them (Fig. 3f and S10†). As a result, the Zn-rich ZnO–C nanoarchitecture formed in the Zn-BTC-nano and carbon-rich ZnO–C nanoarchitecture was converted from Zn-BTC-micro, as shown in Fig. 3h. The combination of these two types of nanoarchitecture facilitates the formation of a gradient distribution of chemical composition in Zn-BTC: from the interior to the exterior showing increased zinc concentration and decreased carbon concentration, which is beneficial to the occurrence of the four proposed chemical reactions illustrated in Fig. 3h. H2O and CO2 are simultaneously released in the interior of the solid particles and pass outwards through Zn-BTC (reaction 1), where they are further converted to CO and H2 catalyzed by ZnO when brought into contact with solid carbon in C-rich ZnO–C (reaction 2, Fig. 3h and S8†). These volatile reducing agents also in turn reduced ZnO to Zn vapour. The continually generated Zn vapour was carried outward and converted to ZnO again when it reached the surface of Zn-rich ZnO–C, near which highly concentrated CO2 was generated and acted (Fig. 3c) as the main oxygen reagent and carbon source for the growth of ZnO–C nanorods rooted in Zn-rich ZnO–C. The low content of released CO2 (Fig. 3c), CO (Fig. S8c†), low weight loss and low heat absorption for Zn-BTC at 550 °C (Fig. S7c†), as well as the high carbon content in ZC550 (Fig. 3f), also elucidated the consumption of CO2 and CO in the above-mentioned reactions and the carbon fixation in ZnO–C nanorods. Initially, ZnO crystal domains with a diameter of several nanometers formed (Fig. 3g) and aggregated with each other in the high-temperature gaseous atmosphere due to Brownian motion.35 With time delay, the nano-domains attach to each other by oriented attachment (OA) along (100) (indicated by the white line) and coalesce to grow into polycrystalline nanorods doped with carbon atoms and surrounded by noncrystalline carbon (Fig. 2d and h and 3g), which is distinctly different to the monocrystalline ZnO nanorods36 (Fig. S4†). Upon the occurrence of the above mechanism, ZnO–C nanorods radically grew until the hollow caterpillar-like photocatalyst ZC550 was formed.
3.3 Photocatalytic activity of catalysts in degradation and disinfection
Photocatalytic degradation performance was achieved toward MB (Fig. S12†) under visible light through investigating the intensity of the UV-vis characteristic absorption peak at 664 nm, as shown in Fig. S13a.† It has been reported that the ameliorated photocatalytic performance of the catalyst is two-fold: the adsorption capacity toward the reactants and the separation–migration efficiency of the photoinduced charge carriers.37 Before illumination, the samples were immersed in MB solution for 120 min in the dark to allow sufficient contact between them, as shown in Fig. S14.† The adsorption capacity of ZC samples pyrolyzed at different temperature toward MB are displayed in Fig. 4a. ZC550 shows the best adsorption ability among the samples, elucidating that surface area plays a critical role in determining the adsorption performance. ZC550 has the best surface area, pore volume and pore size compared with the other catalysts (Fig. 4i and j and Table S1†), which means that MB molecules are liable to be captured by ZC550. However, the AZC samples show lower adsorption ability toward MB compared to the ZC samples, as shown in Fig. 4a–c. This phenomenon can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the charged surface of the catalysts and the reactant MB, which is a positively charged compound (Fig. S12a†).38 The zeta potential of ZC550 is more negative than that of AZC550 (Table S3†), resulting in a higher adsorption capability via the enhanced electrostatic interaction despite its lower surface area (Fig. 4i). The adsorption of MB at different initial concentrations and adsorption times confirm this conclusion, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. For 4-NP and AMX, due to the neutrality of 4-NP and AMX at pH = 7 (Fig. S7b and c†),35,39 AZC550 presents much higher adsorption ability toward the two reactants, which can be positively correlated to the surface area results. Additionally, since ZnO has a positively charged surface (Table S3†), the adsorption of MB is remarkably low due to the repulsive interaction between them, completely different to that of 4-NP and AMX, as indicated in Fig. 4b–d and h. The relevant mechanism regarding the adsorption behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4e.
The photocatalytic performances of the ZC composites were evaluated toward MB photodegradation under visible light illumination. As delineated in Fig. 5a, the photoactivity over the ZC samples can be enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis temperature of Zn-BTC, especially at a temperature of higher than 450 °C. The dependence of MB degradation efficiency on the temperature shows volcano behavior, the same as the result of the adsorption capability shown in Fig. 4. The decline rate of the MB concentration increased, indicating that its photocatalytic degradation is dramatically better than its adsorption (Fig. S13 and S14†). The degradation performance of ZC550 is also the best among the samples, mainly due to the surface area (256.58 m2 g−1) of the hierarchical ZnO–C nanoarchitecture being the highest.40
The AZC nanocomposite exhibits high photocatalytic degradation efficiency toward MB compared to the ZC material, as shown in Fig. 5b. Taking the adsorption efficiency results into consideration, where the adsorption capability of AZC is obviously lower than its ZC counterpart, it can be confirmed that photocatalysis plays a significant role in determining the removal of MB than adsorption for all of the AZC catalysts. The pseudo-first order kinetics of the degradation of MB based on the above data are shown in Fig. 5d. For MB solutions with different initial concentrations, all the AZC samples show a higher reaction rate than ZC, pristine ZnO and Ag-decorated ZnO samples, among which AZC550 exhibits the highest reaction rate of 0.1865 min−1 for C0 = 5 mg L−1, 0.1458 min−1 for C0 = 20 mg L−1, and 0.0484 min−1 for C0 = 50 mg L−1 (Fig. S15 and S16†) even though the Ag loading is only 3.23 at% (Table S2†). Moreover, the catalyst AZC550 also shows excellent repeated-use performance in photocatalytic degradation due to its stable caterpillar-like morphology and crystalline structure, as indicated in Fig. 5e and S18,† where the conversion rate of MB still reaches around 97% after 6 successive test cycles. In addition, it is well known that 50 mg L−1 is an industrial pollutant concentration, where full degradation was achieved within 120 min, indicating the excellent feasibility of the present composite catalyst in the real application of photodegradation.
To demonstrate the wide applicability of AZC550 in the photocatalytic degradation of the diverse contaminants in bodies of water, 4-NP (a persistent organic pollutant) and AMX (an antibiotic) were also employed as model pollutant candidates. The absorption bands of 4-NP and AMX are located at 400 and 273 nm (Fig. S13†), respectively. With the help of visible light, the concentration of substances decreases dramatically for ZnO, ZC550 and AZC550 (Fig. S18†), with a high pollutant conversion ability in the order of AZC550 > ZC550 > ZnO (Fig. 5g and h), the same trend as that of MB degradation, which indicates their superiority in the visible light induced catalytic degradation of various organic contaminants. After the photodegradation of AMX solution, the TOC concentration decreased with a similar trend in UV absorbance, indicating the efficient mineralization of AMX in the presence of the catalysts, especially AZC550 (Fig. S18c†). Additionally, small molecules and ionic species (NO3− and SO42−) were tested, without observation of the mass spectrum peak of amoxicillin emerging, as shown in Fig. S19,† thus excluding the idea that the decreased concentration of the AMX antibiotic wastewater was merely caused by adsorption.
The higher photocatalytic performance of ZC550 and AZC550 compared with ZnO can be attributed to the combined effect of narrow energy band gap and the enhanced migration behavior of electrons. The former can capture more visible light over a broader wavelength to generate a mass of electron–hole pairs, while the latter hinders the recombination of electron–hole pairs and further ameliorates the catalytic reaction. These factors were confirmed by the results of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) (Fig. S20†), XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Fig. 5j) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 5k).
Compared to bare ZnO (Fig. S20†), the characteristic absorption edge of the ZC500 semiconductor is located not only below 400 nm but also another absorption band can be observed in the visible region (400–800 nm), implying the enhanced visible light absorption ability of ZC500. Moreover, with the introduction of Ag on the surface of ZC500, a distinct additional absorption peak between 400 and 500 nm, which is the typical surface plasmon response (SPR) peak of Ag-NPs,41,42 can be detected, showing its further improved visible light absorption capability compared to the other two samples. The calculated band gap derived from the Tauc plot data (Fig. 5i) was found to be approximately 3.16 eV for ZnO, in agreement with literature data.43 The decreased band gap of 2.97 eV for ZC550 is mainly derived from the visible-light response induced by the carbon doping in crystalline ZnO (ref. 40) and the amorphous carbon matrix. AZC550 shows a reduced band gap of 2.37 eV, which can be attributed to the SPR phenomenon.24 The position of the valence band (VB) with respect to the surface Fermi level was determined using a linear extrapolation method (Fig. 5j). AZC550 and ZC550 have VBs at around 2.33 and 2.37 eV, respectively, approaching the Fermi level and lower than that of ZnO (2.48 eV), which indicates that carbon atoms were successfully doped into the structure of ZnO,44 with the creation of new recombination centers between the VB and CB of ZnO (Fig. 7). Moreover, the resultant CB presents a positive shift from −0.70 to −0.14 eV (Fig. 5f), beneficial to the transfer of electrons from Ag NPs to carbon via ZnO–C nanocomposites. The PL spectra of the ZnO, Ag–ZnO, ZC and AZC samples with a peak at 503 nm illustrate that the best charge carrier-transfer efficiency is shown by AZC550, followed by ZC550 (illustrated in Fig. 5k and S21†), which is in accordance with the results of transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S22†). AZC550 and ZC550 present higher photocurrent densities and smaller arc radii in the Nyquist plots compared with ZnO, indicating their better electron–hole separation efficiency and light absorption, as well as lower charge transfer resistance, respectively.31,45
This is mainly derived from the doped carbon in ZnO and carbon matrix, which generally inhibits the combination of photoinduced charge pairs31 and is recognized as an electron reservoir and brilliant pathway for electron transfer.46 The reduced recombination rate of photogenerated carriers supplies enough electrons to activate O2 and promote the formation of reactive species during the photocatalytic redox reaction. The EPR spectra of the catalysts were also investigated to detect the formation of radical species, employing DMPO as a spin trap to trap hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and superoxide radical anions (˙O2−) in water and in methanol, respectively. The signals of ˙OH are weaker than those of ˙O2−, implying the major role of ˙O2− in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, especially MB (Fig. 5l), which is consistent with the results of the active species strapping experiment shown in Fig. S22.†
In Table S4,† the photocatalytic performance of AZC550 in the present work is compared with the data from other literature studies. It is clear that AZC550 in the present work is one of the best catalysts reported for the visible light photodegradation of MB (TOF: 3 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1), 4-NP (TOF: 0.14 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1) and AMX (TOF: 3.43 × 10−3 mol mol−1 min−1) (TOF: turnover frequency, defined as the mole of pollutant per mole of catalyst per second when the pollutant reaches 100% conversion). Although NH2-MOF-Sm2O3–ZnO shows a higher TOF47 than AZC550, UV irradiation adopted as the light source is the main obstacle in their real application. It is believed that factors including membrane supports or stirring and smaller Ag nanoparticles play roles in further improving the photocatalytic activity of AZC550.
To fully explore the photocatalytic performance, the light induced antibacterial properties were investigated. To avoid the pollution of AZC550 powder in the bacterial solution, the black catalyst powder was coated on white nanofibrous membranes (NFM) for antibacterial activity testing (model bacteria: E. coli) under visible light, as shown in Fig. 6a. Obviously, without illumination, NFM still presents antibacterial properties to a certain degree upon a variation in the visible cell number from 4300 to 3340 cfu (contact time: 20 min), which is due to the water layer energy barrier on the surface of the membrane created by the hydroxyl groups of PVA-co-PE. In contrast, AZC550-NFM exhibits a better inactivation performance (4300 to 1200 cfu) due to silver nanoparticles. After exposure to visible light for 20 min, AZC550-NFM inactivates all the E. coli cells, mainly due to the numbers of ROS generated by AZC550. Nevertheless, there are still 4080 and 3120 cfu active cells left in the original bacterial solution and that in contact with NFM, respectively. There was a slight decrease in visible cell number compared to that in the dark. Additionally, the disinfection performance of the above products can also be observed from the visible cells in agar plates shown in Fig. 6b. We also compared the properties of AZC550-NFM with those in the literature48–50 (Fig. 6c). AZC550-NFM presents the fastest disinfection rate of less than 20 min and a relative high inactivation efficiency (106 cfu) compared with Ag/AgO/g-CNMS51 (30 min, 105 cfu), TiO2-rGO49 (180 min, 105.3 cfu), CuBi2O4/Bi2MoO6 (ref. 52) (240 min, 107 cfu), Cu–MoS2 (ref. 4) (20 min, 105 cfu), BV-NT50 (300 min, 105.3 cfu), and Ag-TiO2 (ref. 48) (30 min, 107 cfu). For better comparison, the solar quantized parameter antimicrobial activity was employed and defined as the number of visible cells inactivated by per mole catalyst per minute. AZC550-NFM exhibits an activity of 6.25 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1, much higher than most other catalysts, except for Cu-MoS2,4 indicating the superiority of the present material in the application of the solar photocatalytic disinfection of bacteria.

The plot shows the log inactivation of E. coli with respect to illumination time for this work (antimicrobial activity: 6.25 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), (1) Ag/AgO/g-CNMS (0.2 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), (2) TiO2-rGO (0.61 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), (3) CuBi2O4/Bi2MoO6 (0.52 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), (4) Cu–MoS2 (31.25 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), (5) BV-NT (0.06 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1), and (6) Ag–TiO2 (0.2 × 105 cfu mg−1 min−1). 
Based on literature and photodegradation test results, we propose a plausible mechanism for the present photocatalytic process, as shown in Fig. 7. Firstly, when AZC550 was exposed to visible light (λ > 380 nm), the metallic Ag-NPs began to absorb visible light due to the SPR effect (indicated by DRS result in Fig. 3e). The Ag-NP electron density was polarized to one side and oscillated in resonance with the light frequency, which further generated abundant electron–hole pairs in the Ag-NPs.53 Under visible light, strong electron oscillation occurs and gives electrons sufficient energy to overcome the Schottky barrier formed at the interface of Ag–ZnO, and further transfer from Ag to the conduction band of ZnO. This ameliorates the separation and the reduction in the recombination probability of the charge carriers.42 Carbon-doped ZnO combined with a carbon matrix possesses a narrow energy band gap (EBG) of around 2.97 eV, resulting in enhanced visible light absorption capability (Fig. 5j) and benefiting the generation of electron–hole pairs. Additionally, the amorphous carbon matrix also impedes the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers by effectively transferring and receiving the photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of carbon-doped ZnO,15,46 which can also be confirmed from the PL spectra of a mixture of ZnO nanorods and BTC-derived carbon in various atomic ratios, as shown in Fig. S21.†

Top: The degradation of MB, 4-NP and AMX (the yellow arrows in the Ag-NPs represent the photoexcitation process of electron–hole pairs; the white dashed line represents the recombination of electron–hole pairs; the red arrows denote the transfer pathway of electrons), bottom: the disinfection of E. coli. 
During this period, O2 interacts with photo-generated electrons to form superoxide radicals (O2−). Meanwhile, hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) are generated from H2O with the assistance of photo-generated holes. Generated hydroxyl and superoxide radicals function as strong oxidants to decompose organic molecules adsorbed on the amorphous carbon matrix to carbon dioxide, water and photodegraded products31 and disinfect pathogens by damaging essential macromolecules.4 The adsorption capability of AZC550 toward the pollutant is improved by the carbon matrix and the multilevel architecture, which further enhances the oxidation process between the substances and the surface of the catalysts. The control mixture shows a lower catalytic reaction rate of around 0.029 min−1 compared with that of AZC550, also indicating the remarkable influence of the hierarchical structure of the ZnO–C nanocomposite on the enhancement in catalytic capability (Fig. S16†).
Therefore, the advantage of observed AZC550 lies in the following factors:
(1) Light adsorption: decorated Ag-NPs act as an admirable visible light absorber,54 carbon-doped ZnO nanocrystal domains in nanorods are also beneficial for light absorption compared to pure ZnO;
(2) Generation and migration of electrons: Ag-NPs and carbon-doped ZnO continuously generate photoinduced electrons and inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes. The catalyst consists of plenty of 1D nanorod building blocks, which favor the transfer of photogenerated electrons and reduction in charge carrier recombination; the carbon matrix not only provides a high specific area for adsorbing reactants, but also prevents the recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs;
(3) Synergistic effects: the 3D hierarchical rod structure facilitates the light harvesting of Ag-NPs and ZnO nanocrystals by scattering and reflecting incident light; carbon-doped ZnO, carbon matrix and Ag-NPs supported by a hierarchical structure synergistically enhance the function of electron–hole pairs and further improve the photocatalytic performance.
4 Conclusions
Overall, a Ag–ZnO–C nanocomposite with hierarchical hollow structure was successfully fabricated through directly pyrolyzing Zn-BTC MOF-microrods and nanorods followed by in situ photo-reduction of AgNO3. The results show that the ZnO–C nanorods radically grew on the surface of the hollow nanocomposite consisting of nanoparticles, nanosheets and nanorods converted from Zn-BTC MOF-microrods at around 550 °C. Photoinduced Ag-NP-decorated AZC550 presents excellent photocatalytic performance in the degradation of MB, 4-NP and AMX, as well as in the inactivation of E. coli, better than that reported in the literature. The brilliant properties are recognized to be a joint effect of the result of the adsorption ability and photoactivity of the catalyst. These advantages of the present product can be assigned to the synergistic effects between the multi-level Zn–C nanoarchitectures (C-doped ZnO in the carbon matrix) decorated by Ag-NPs. This work may pave a new avenue to design MOF-derived semiconductors for highly efficient photocatalytic applications in a wide range of fields.

Environmental significance
Engineering a highly accessible semiconductor with an optimized physicochemical structure for efficient environment applications, such as the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms under visible light, is never-ending. This work reports a facile strategy for pyrolyzing Zn-BTC MOF microrods and nanorods and the in situ photoreduction of AgNO3 to prepare a caterpillar-like Ag–ZnO–C (AZC) hollow nanocomposite. The ameliorated solar photocatalytic degradation and disinfection performance over the nanoarchitecture is superior to most of the values in the reported literature, which is the combined result of the adsorption and photoelectrochemical properties of the present nanomaterial, and is synergistically affected by the hierarchical structure of C-doped ZnO, the carbon matrix and Ag-NPs.
