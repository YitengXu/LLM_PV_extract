    , Accepted 21st March 2012First published on 22nd March 2012AbstractThis study involves the development of new solution processable organic small molecules for photovoltaic applications. We have rationally designed and synthesized two novel, symmetrical and linear D–A–D–A–D-type π-conjugated organic small molecules bearing a rigidly fused naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene core flanked by bithiazole (M3) or triphenylamine-capped thiophene(3-decanyl)-bridged bithiazole (M4) conjugated moieties through thiophene(3-decanyl) spacer. The resultant small molecules have been characterized by thermal analysis, UV-Vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and cyclic voltammetry. Their applications in field effect transistors and solution processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have also been explored. Due to the presence of an adequate number of 3-decanylthiophene moieties as short π-bridging units into the conjugated molecular backbone, both the small molecules have good solubility in common organic solvents and form highly ordered self-assembled π–π stacks in their solid states with long decyl chains organized by interdigitation. Additionally, they exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures exceeding 380 °C. Photophysical and electrochemical studies reveal that these molecular donors have comparable optical band gaps (∼1.99 to 2.02 eV) and nearly similar HOMO–LUMO energy levels, both of which are aligned with the PC61BM/PC71BM electron acceptors. The preliminary BHJ photovoltaic cells configured with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/Lif/Al were evaluated. The small molecule M3 was found to deliver the best power conversion efficiency of 1.09% when processing the active layer from chloroform solvent. In contrast, under identical device conditions M4 gave improved performance with a maximum efficiency of 1.62%. The morphological studies using atomic force microscopy showed that the PCE enhancement for M4 is mainly due to improvement in the nanoscale film morphology of the M4–PC71BM blend.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) that contain a blend film of low band gap polymers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors have dominated organic solar cell research for the last few years and hold potential as a renewable photovoltaic technology with great promise for the near future.1–5 Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the design and synthesis of alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers,2 to the elucidation of their structure and properties,3 and to device engineering,4 which guided the polymer photovoltaic technology nearer to the commercial applications with power conversion efficiencies close to 8%.5 There is currently an evolving interest in π-conjugated D–A conjugated small molecules for BHJ organic solar cells (OSCs). These arise as potentially good alternatives to conventional D–A conjugated polymers because of their simple synthesis and low processing cost. Optoelectronic properties can be tuned by adding desirable segments or functional groups by a stepwise synthetic procedure consisting of coupling and activation reactions. A well-defined molecular weight and architecture can be created in a way that improves reproducible device performance. Many new small molecules have recently been developed in parallel with conjugated polymers based on different electron-donor–acceptor moieties including oligothiophene,6 triphenylamine (TPA),7 benzothiadiazole (BT),8 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalonitrile (PM),9 and well-known dye molecules such as merocyanine,10 squaraine,11 boron-dipyrromethene,12 quinacridone,13 diketopyrrolopyrole,14 and isoindigo15 with D–A–D, A–D–A, D–A–A, and even more extended D–A molecular architectures that have substantially contributed to realizing the potential of conjugated small molecules for organic photovoltaic device applications. More recently, encouraging results have been reported with the diketopyrrolopyrole- and dithienosilole-based conjugated small molecules leading to PCEs even in excess of 5% in solution processed small molecule OSCs.14d,16,17 To accomplish high efficiency in photovoltaic devices, it is additionally desirable to develop new small molecules by incorporating novel building blocks in the molecular structures similar to the ongoing trend towards developing D–A conjugated polymers. A promising approach for developing efficient photoactive small molecules is to incorporate π-conjugated rigidly fused thiophene rings into donor–acceptor conjugated units. Fused thiophene rings can increase the rigidity of the molecular backbone while increasing face-to-face π⋯π overlap.18 These effects enhance the effective π-conjugation, extend absorption, lower the band gap, and facilitate charge carrier mobility in a way that could significantly improve device performance.19 Substantial progress has recently been made in polymer solar cells by introducing many new π-conjugated rigidly fused thiophene units, enhancing the PCEs above 7%.5,19,20 Remarkably, a PCE surpassing 6.7% has also been reported more recently even in the case of solution processed small molecule organic solar cells by employing dithienosilole fused moieties in the core of D–A–D–A–D type small molecules.17 However, the research devoted to developing low molecular weight conjugated small molecules based on π-conjugated fused thiophene units is still inadequate, especially when compared to the amount of research devoted to p-type conjugated polymers.
Recently, naphthodithiophene derivatives with two thiophene rings fused at different positions of the naphthalene unit have attracted great interest for use in polymer/small molecule organic solar cells. For instance, You et al. have investigated the solar cell performance of 5,6-dialkylnaphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-based D–A conjugated copolymers combined with different acceptor units, such as thienothiophene and benzothiadiazole.21 Marks et al. used the 5,10-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene building block in small molecular organic solar cells with encouraging PCE results.22 In addition, we recently developed the first naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-based novel small molecules (see Fig. 1 for molecular structures) by combining with benzothiadiazole (M1) or triphenylamine-capped benzothiadiazole (M2) conjugated units.23 A solution-processed organic solar cell efficiency of up to 2.2% was achieved. Furthermore, this new naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene unit was also employed by us to synthesize a D–A conjugated polymer by combining with quinoxaline acceptor for PSCs that demonstrated a PCE of up to ∼1.5% with elementary device characterization.24 These preliminary results indicate that in addition to naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene moieties, naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene also holds potential as a building block for designing new conjugated small molecules/polymers for organic solar cell applications. On the other hand, among the acceptor units, the bithiazole unit has also drawn much attention due to its potential for improving the hole-mobility in the conjugated unit while lowering the HOMO energy levels of the semiconductors and improving the Voc of the solar cell devices.25 There are some recent examples of successful bithiazole-based conjugated polymers with high Voc that attain decent PCEs in polymer solar cells.26 Moreover, we have reported the first bithiazole-based small molecule that has also shown promise in solution processed OSCs with an outstanding Voc of 0.97 V and a moderate PCE of 1.30%.27 Zhan et al. further reported a series of bithiazole containing D–A small molecules with increased PCE (of up to 2.61%).28 Obviously, it would be interesting to explore the photovoltaic properties of some enlarged D–A conjugated small molecules based on naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene as donors and bithiazole as acceptors. We envisioned that incorporating additional thiophene units into D–A small molecules may substantially extend conjugation and enhance absorption, while the 3-decanyl chain would increase solubility and processability to alleviate the good film morphology of the small molecules, which are indispensable for high performance photovoltaic devices. Thus, two new linear symmetrical solution processable organic small molecules M3 and M4 (Fig. 1) were designed with the naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene moiety as a π-conjugated rigid core and thiophene(3-decanyl)-bithiazole (M3) or triphenylamine flanked thiophene(3-decanyl)-bithiazole (M4) as conjugated terminal segments connected through thiophene(3-decanyl). The small molecules have been synthesized by stepwise Pd-catalyzed Suzuki and Stille coupling reactions. The detailed characterization of their thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties, thin-film transistors, and photovoltaic behaviors has been investigated and discussed.

General instrumentations

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL FT-NMR (400 MHz) spectrophotometer using CDCl3 as a solvent. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to the internal standard tetramethylsilane (TMS). Elemental analyses were carried out using CE Instruments Flash EA 1112 series. The UV-Vis absorption spectra films or solutions were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of films were obtained using a FP-6500 (JASCO). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out with a TA Instrument Q-50 at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature of degradation (Td) corresponded to a 5% weight loss. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a TA Instrument (DSC 2910) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a VersaSTAT3 (METEK) under argon at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature, wherein a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter- and reference electrodes respectively. The reference electrode was calibrated with Fc/Fc+ as an external standard. The samples were prepared in chloroform solution with 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as electrolyte. Thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X-Pert diffractometer operating at 30 kV and 20 mA with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at a scan speed of 1° min−1 and a step size of 0.04°. The measurements were obtained in a scanning interval of 2θ between 1° and 30°. The film samples were fabricated by drop-casting on a silicon wafer, followed by drying under vacuum (solvent: chloroform, solution concentration: 10 mg mL−1). The surface morphology was measured using a Digital Instruments Multimode atomic force microscope (AFM) controlled by a Nanoscope IIIa scanning probe microscope 20 controller.
OFET device fabrication and characterization
Thin-film transistor devices were fabricated on silicon wafers in a bottom-contact geometry (channel length, L = 12 μm, width, W = 120 μm). A heavily n-doped silicon wafer with a 300 nm thermal silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer was used as the substrate/gate electrode, with the top SiO2 layer serving as the gate dielectric. The SiO2 surface of the wafer substrate was first cleaned with piranha solution (H2O2–H2SO4) at 130 °C for 20 min, and the cleaned wafer was immersed in a solution of 1.0 mM octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8) in toluene at room temperature for 2 h under nitrogen. The semiconductor layer was spin-coated at 2000 rpm from a 0.5 wt% chlorobenzene solution, to a thickness of 70 nm. Subsequently, a series of gold source–drain electrode pairs were deposited by vacuum evaporation through a shadow mask. Silicon oxide on the back of the silicon wafer of the TFT device was removed with HF to provide a conductive gate contact. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out in air at room temperature.
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
All the organic photovoltaic cells were prepared on a commercial ITO-coated glass substrate with a sandwiched structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/M3 or M4:PC71BM/LiF/Al. Prior to use, the patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonication, followed by treatment with UV and O3. The PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083, H. C. Starck) was spin-coated (2600 rpm, 40 s) onto the cleaned ITO-glass at a thickness of 40 nm and dried at 140 °C for 20 min in atmosphere and then transferred into the glove box filled with N2. Blends of M3 or M4 and PC71BM (Nano-C, USA) with different weight ratios (from 1:1 to 1:4 w/w) were solubilized overnight in chlorobenzene (concentration: 20 mg mL−1) or chloroform (concentration: 10 mg mL−1) solution, filtered through a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and subsequently spin-coated at 700 (for chlorobenzene)/1400 (for chloroform) rpm for 60 s (thickness, 60–70 nm) onto the PEDOT:PSS layer of the ITO. The resulting films were dried at room temperature for 20 min under nitrogen and then under vacuum for 12 h. The devices were completed by deposition of a 0.5 nm layer of LiF and a 120 nm Al layer. These layers were thermally evaporated at a pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr at room temperature. The active area of every device was 9 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured in the dark and under white light illumination at AM 1.5G using a solar simulator (Newport) at 100 mW cm−2, adjusted with a standard PV reference (2 × 2 cm), a mono-crystalline silicon solar cell (calibrated at NREL, Colorado, USA) with a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined using a Polaronix K3100 spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and structural characterization
The small molecules M3 and M4 were synthesized according to the synthetic routes outlined in Scheme 1. Naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (7) was synthesized in four steps starting from 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene (3).29 Lithiation of naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene was followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride to give 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (8) in 70% yield. 2,7-Bis(3-decylthiophene-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (9) was prepared by a Pd(0) catalyzed Stille cross-coupling reaction of 8 and 2-bromo-3-decylthiophene, giving a yield of 63%. 2,7-Bis(3-decylthiophene-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene distannane (10) was synthesized in analogy to the synthesis of 8. 5,5′-Bis(3-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bithiazole (14) was synthesized according to the literature.27,30 Monobromination of 14 was carried out with NBS in chloroform at 0–5 °C to afford 15 as yellow solids in 45% yield. Dibromination of 14 with NBS in CHCl3–glacial acetic acid (GA) at room temperature gave 5,5′-bis(5-bromo-3-decylthiophen-2-yl)-2,2′-bithiazole (16). The subsequent Suzuki coupling reaction of 16 and 17 afforded 18 in a 52% yield. The title compound M3 (1) was synthesized via a Pd2(dba)3/P(o-Tolyl)3-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling of 10 and 15 resulting in a 74% yield of a dark red solid. By reacting 18 with 10 under identical conditions, the title compound M4 (2) was obtained as a dark brown powder with a 71% yield. The detailed synthetic procedure and characterizations can be found in the experimental section. Because of the fact that sufficient aliphatic hydrocarbon chains were introduced to the D–A conjugated unit of the small molecules, both target compounds exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents, including chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran. This characteristic allows adequate solution processability and miscibility with n-type materials. The thermal properties of the small molecules were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC was performed at a heating (cooling) scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen. In Fig. S7†, DSC traces of M3 and M4 in the second heating and cooling cycle are compared. Notably, M3 displayed a distinct melting temperature (Tm) at 95.7 °C and an isotropic-to-crystalline transition (Tc) at 52.9 °C (in the cooling cycle). In contrast, M4 had a higher melting to crystallization transition temperature (Tm = 137 °C and Tc = 117.2 °C) accompanied by a less pronounced endothermic peak at 54.9 °C (during the heating cycle) corresponding to its glass transition temperature (Tg). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere and are presented in Fig. S8†. The TGA analysis revealed that both the small molecules have sufficient thermal stability for long-term photovoltaic applications, with high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 388 °C for M3 and 395 °C for M4.

Photophysical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the small molecules were measured in dilute chloroform solutions (10−5 M) and in solid films spin coated on a quartz substrate. The normalized absorption spectra of M3 and M4 in chloroform solutions and thin films are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding absorption data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, M3 exhibited one absorption band in the 330–540 nm range with absorption maxima (λmax) at 449 nm. M4 exhibited a similar absorption profile, though the maximum absorption of M4 in solution was slightly broader (in the 300–550 nm range). λmax of M4 underwent a nearly 11 nm red shift compared to that of M3. The broader and red-shifted absorption of M4 was expected due to its increased effective conjugation length resulting from the two additional terminal triphenylamine (TPA) units. Due to increased π-electron delocalization the molar extinction coefficient of M4 also increased slightly (∼5%). The thin-film absorption spectra of M3 exhibited a large red shift Δλ (λmax (solid) − λmax (solution) ≈ 67 nm) as compared to the solution with well-defined vibronic splitting peaks at 540 nm and 550 nm. This is similar to what is seen in regioregular semiconducting polymers such as HT-P3HT,31 and is indicative of efficient π-stacking and strong intermolecular interaction in the film.32 The film absorption spectrum of M4 was also red-shifted compared to its solution spectrum. However, the red shift was relatively smaller (Δλ ≈ 21 nm) than that of M3. The vibronic splitting was observed as a shoulder at 510 nm and 555 nm. The thin film absorption band of M4 extends up to ∼613 nm, while that of M3 reaches ∼623 nm. The optical band gap (Egopt) of M4 estimated by the onset absorption of the thin film is 2.02 eV, which is 0.03 eV higher than that of M3. The smaller absorption peak shift for M4 between the dilute solution and solid-state suggests that incorporating a bulky TPA moiety is likely to have a negative effect on reducing the band gap of a small molecule. The absorption spectra for M2 (see Fig. 1) solid and solution were previously found to broaden and shift towards longer wavelengths when a triphenylamine amine unit was incorporated into the conjugated benzothiadiazole-naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene unit.23 A reduced thin-film band gap of 1.96 eV was achieved for M2, 0.2 eV lower than that for M1, which lacks terminal triphenylamine units. Contrary to the results of our previous studies, the thin film absorption of M4 is blue-shifted despite its enlarged π-conjugated M4 skeleton. This may be attributed to the twisted conjugated backbone and reduced effective conjugation length caused by steric hindrance between the bulky three-dimensional TPA moieties and the adjacent alkylated-thienyl unit.

To probe the photo-induced electron transfer from the donor small molecule to the acceptor PCBM, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of M3, M4, and their corresponding composite thin films with PC71BM were taken and are presented in Fig. S9†. The pristine M3 film exhibited one emission band with an emission maximum at 632 nm, while the emission maximum of M4 is bathochromically shifted with a peak centered at 656 nm. For the small molecules–PC71BM composite films, the emission intensity exhibited significant quenching (more than 99%) in both cases upon doubling the PC71BM content. This indicates a photo-excited charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, which is highly favorable for competing with radiative recombination of the excitons.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the small molecules and their HOMO and LUMO energy levels were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The measurements were carried out in a 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile at room temperature under argon with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The CV curves were referenced to Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) and were calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard. The onset potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.4 V relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The HOMO energy levels of the small molecules were calculated using the empirical equation EHOMO = −e(4.8 − 0.4 + Eoxonset) = HOMO = −e(4.4 + Eoxonset), where Eoxonset is the onset potential for oxidation relative to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.33 The cyclic voltammograms of the small molecules are presented in Fig. 3a. Both small molecules exhibited quasi-reversible oxidation peaks with onset potentials (Eoxonset) of 0.8 V for M3 and 0.82 V for M4 (versus Ag/AgCl). The HOMO energy levels were determined to be −5.2 eV for M3 and −5.22 eV for M4. These values were determined from the corresponding Eoxonset according to the above-mentioned empirical equation. The LUMO energy levels were calculated as −3.21 eV for M3 and −3.2 eV for M4 by subtracting the optical band gap value from the respective HOMO energy levels (ELUMO = EHOMO − Egopt). The results of the electrochemical measurements and calculated energy levels of the small molecules are listed in Table 1. Upon comparing the electrochemical properties between the small molecules, it revealed that the estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of M3 and M4 are very close. Therefore, the incorporation of a triphenylamine unit has little effect on their HOMO and LUMO energy level differences. However, it is interesting to note that despite having a more electron donating character, which usually increases the HOMO level, the M4 HOMO is 0.02 eV lower than that of M3. This is primarily due to reduced electron delocalization, which results from twisting at the linkage of terminal triphenylamine and adjacent alkylated thienyl units. Thus, the electrochemical properties of the small molecules are consistent with their optical properties. To better understand their electronic properties and potential for energy transfer to PCBMs for photovoltaic applications, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the small molecules were further compared with those of PC61BM or PC71BM in Fig. 3b. To effectively compare the molecular designs, the energy levels of M1 and M2 are also included, as previously reported by us. According to the band-gap alignment diagram in Fig. 3b, the LUMO energy levels of M3 and M4 are located within a reasonable range (−3.21 to −3.2) maintaining an energy offset of >0.3 eV. From a photovoltaic device perspective, efficient charge transfer/dissociation is anticipated on a suitable BHJ device fabrication.34 The HOMO energy levels of M3 and M4 are in between the HOMO levels of M1 and M2. Earlier, BHJ organic solar cells devices based on M1 and M2 with PC71BM acceptors exhibited high Voc of 0.93 V and 0.95 V, respectively. Because Voc is mainly determined by the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, a Voc value comparable to those of M1 and M2 is expected. A significantly higher Voc is also more reasonable in photovoltaic devices based on M3/M4 than in devices of rrP3HT because the HOMO values of M3 and M4 are much lower than the HOMO value of rrP3HT (HOMO = −4.75 eV).35

X-ray diffraction
To investigate the molecular arrangement of the small molecules in solid state, thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed. The XRD patterns of the spin coated cast films of M3 and M4 in chloroform are presented in Fig. 4a. Similar to thiazole36 and thiophene based polymers,37 both small molecular films exhibited sharp diffraction peaks (100) at smaller angle regions, indicating a highly ordered assembly and crystallinity. In addition to a weak low angle diffraction peak at 2θ of 5.56°, M3 showed a more intense peak centered at 2θ = 3.34°. This peak corresponds to the d-spacing (d1) of 26.42 Å which appeared towards lower angle regions. In comparison, M4 had a peak centered at 2θ = 5.71° (d-spacing of 15.46 Å). The much stronger peak intensity for M3 is likely related to its high degree of crystallinity and the corresponding coplanarity of the conjugated unit in M3 due to the absence of bulky triphenylamine moiety. These results are consistent with the results of the optical and electrochemical studies. The peaks in the small angle region are attributed to interchain spacing between the conjugated units where the alkyl chains are segregated. The d spacings calculated with the Bragg equation for M3 (26.42 Å) and M4 (15.46 Å) are smaller than the distances between the conjugated main chains separated by the long decyl side chains in their most extended conformations (∼28.01 to 28.43 Å). This indicates that both the small molecules should attain an interdigitation packing mode rather than end-to-end packing as proposed in part (b) of Fig. 4. An additional strong broad peak towards wider angles and at half width peak maxima of ∼16.64° were also observed for M3. This peak corresponds to a d spacing (d2) of 5.31 Å, which is due to strong interlayer π–π stacking between the coplanar conjugated main chains. In contrast, M4 exhibited sharp and less intense peaks at 2θ of 10.35° and 11.46° followed by a barely detectable broad peak centered at 16.06° (corresponding to the d spacing of 5.51 Å). These peaks indicate relatively weak π-overlapping interactions. In addition, it is worth noting that the d2 spacing of M4 (5.51 Å) was slightly larger (∼0.2 Å) than that of M3 (5.31 Å). Broader and stronger peak intensity is associated with lowered d2 spacing for M3, suggesting better film organization and closer co-facial interlayer π–π stacking than in M4. These results are facilitated by less steric hindrance and the more coplanar structure of M3.

Field-effect transistor characteristics
The field-effect carrier mobilities of the small molecules were evaluated by fabricating thin-film transistors (TFTs) with bottom-gate, top-contact device configurations built on an n-doped silicon wafer with an evaporated gold source–drain electrode and an octyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8)-modified (300 nm) silicon dioxide (SiO2) gate dielectric. Solutions of M3 or M4 (10 mg mL−1) in chloroform were filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter, spin coated on OTS-treated SiO2–Si substrate, and heated at 40 °C for 10 min in a glove box. The gold (Au) source–drain electrode pairs (70 nm) were deposited on top of the thin films by high vacuum thermal evaporation through a shadow mask to define channel length (L = 12 μm, width, W = 120 μm). The detailed device fabrication process is further described in the experimental section. All device fabrication procedures and measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions. Hole mobility (μh) was extracted from the slope of the square root of the drain current plot vs. VG from the following equation: (1)where IDS is the drain–source current in the saturated region, W and L are the channel width and length respectively, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the insulation layer (SiO2, 300 nm), and VG and VT are the gate and threshold voltages, respectively. Fig. 5 shows plots of IDS as a function of drain–source voltage (VDS) at different VG and transfer curves at constant VDS. Both M3- and M4-based devices exhibited p-channel FET responses. The mobilities and on/off ratios of TFTs made with the resulting small molecules are listed in Table 1. On the basis of transfer curves measured at VDS = −60 V, the hole mobility of M3 was found to be 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with an Ion/Ioff ratio of 103. Under identical device conditions, M4 had a hole mobility of 2 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio of 5 × 101. The fact that the hole-mobility of M3 is one order higher than that of the M4 obviously due to more chain-planarization and better face-to-face packing than M4 which corroborates the XRD results discussed above.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of the small molecules was evaluated by fabricating bulk heterojunction OSCs with device architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecules:PCBM/LiF/Al, where small molecules, M3 and M4, were used as donors and the fullerene derivative, PC71BM, as acceptor. The PC71BM was chosen as an acceptor as it has more absorption in the visible region than the analogous acceptor PC61BM. The active layers of the photovoltaic cells were spin coated from chloroform or chlorobenzene solutions at different weight ratios of small molecules to PC71BM (from 1:1 to 1:4). The active layers range in thickness from 60 to 70 nm. The thickness was controlled by changing the spinning speed and the concentration of the active layer solution. All solar cells had an active area of 9 mm2. All devices were tested in the dark and under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cell devices are presented in the Fig. 6 and the corresponding short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices are summarized in Table 2. As listed, both small molecules performed better when the active layers were processed from chloroform rather than chlorobenzene. M3:PC71BM solar cells from chloroform showed the best PCE of 1.09% at a blending ratio of 1:3 (w/w) with a Jsc of 3.35 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V, and a FF of 0.41. M4:PC71BM cells at 1:1 ratios resulted in the maximum PCE of 1.62% with an enhanced Jsc of 4.47 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and a FF of 0.48. Increases in FF for M3:PC71BM solar cells generally led to improved PCE. Both Jsc and FF were significantly enhanced in M4:PC71BM cells when the processing solvent was switched from chlorobenzene to chloroform. It is further interesting to note that the Voc of M4:PC71BM is lower than that of M3:PC71BM cells despite their similar HOMO levels. It is known that in addition to the difference between the HOMO of the donor molecule and the LUMO of PCBM, the mobility and morphology might also influence Voc.34,38 We speculate that the lower Voc for M4–PC71BM cells is possibly due to the lower mobility attributed to the charge recombination losses at the M4–PC71BM interfaces and the electrode. A similar trend was also observed earlier in some D–A conjugated polymers intended for polymer solar cell devices.39

In addition to photovoltaic studies, the external quantum efficiency of the best devices was also examined. Fig. 7 displays the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the M3–PC71BM (1:3 w/w) and M4–PC71BM (1:1 w/w) devices measured under monochromatic light. As shown, the device based on M3–PC71BM exhibits photoresponse in the range of 300 to 700 nm with photon-to-current conversion efficiencies greater than 25% at 380 nm. The M4:PCBM solar cell devices exhibited significantly broader EQE responses (over 30%) in the range of 360 to 515 nm with a maximum of 34.8% at 380 nm, which attributed its higher photocurrent in OSCs device under the same conditions.

Morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of M3–PC71BM and M4–PC71BM composite films in both chloroform and chlorobenzene were taken at 1:1 w/w blending ratios to compare their surface morphology and its correlation to photovoltaic performance. The AFM topography and phase images of M3:PC71BM and M4:PC71BM blend films are presented in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8a, the M3-blend film prepared from chlorobenzene has self-assembled crystalline features with M3 surrounded by small PCBM crystals precipitates with root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of 1.16 nm, which resulted due to the more ordered structure, better coplanarity and stronger crystallization ability of M3. In contrast, affecting the increased planarity and enhanced-intermolecular packing of the conjugated backbone of M4 by insertion of triphenylamine unit at the terminal ends, no aggregated domains were observed with the M4-blend film when processed from chlorobenzene. However, unlike the M3-composite film, the surface of the M4-composite layer was appeared to be covered with large bright dots, which are defects in the device that cause charge recombination. Both the M3- and M4-composite films processed from chlorobenzene exhibited rough surfaces with coarse morphology. These characteristics are not favorable for exciton dissociation and lead to low Jsc and low FF values, restricting the PCE value. In comparison, when the same M3- or M4-blends were processed from chloroform, improvements in morphology were observed for both small molecules. Despite some aggregated PCBM crystals with high surface roughness (RMS = 2.71 nm) for the M3–PC71BM blend (Fig. 8c), an interpenetrating network with moderately homogeneous morphology was observed. Uniform mixing with minimum aggregation of donor–acceptor components is beneficial for obtaining large interface areas and for maximizing Jsc and FF.40 As shown in Fig. 8d, the M4–PC71BM film acquired from chloroform had the finest film morphology. Both the donor and the acceptor components were uniformly dispersed in the matrix with a much smaller domain size. This facilitated charge transport, depressed leakage current and led to the highest Jsc, FF and PCE. Thus, the gain from higher hole mobility due to better coplanarity of M3 could not compensate for its loss for not obtaining ideal phase separation due to its enhanced aggregation, finally leading to inferior device performance as compared to M4. Similar problems have also been witnessed in case of rigid donor polymers for PSCs.41

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed two new solution processable D–A–D–A–D type small molecules, M3 and M4. They are based on a π-conjugated, rigidly fused naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene core connected to terminal thiophene(3-decanyl)-bithiazole (M3) or triphenylamine-flanked thiophene(3-decanyl)-bithiazole (M4) moieties through thiophene(3-decanyl) units as short π-bridging spacers. The application of these small molecules was investigated for use in solution-processed BHJ organic solar cells. The small molecules have excellent solubility and thermal stability (Td ≈ 388–395 °C), as required for photovoltaic applications. Optical and electrochemical studies showed that these small molecules have similar band gaps (∼1.99 to 2.02 eV) and almost invariant HOMO–LUMO energy levels due to their similar structural and electronic effects. However, the field effect mobility of M3 is one order higher than that of M4 due to its coplanarity and efficient intermolecular π–π stacking. The M3:PC71BM blend film showed a PCE of 1.09%. This OPV performance was obtained when the film was cast from chloroform solvent at a 1:3 w/w ratio with a 64 nm thickness. The higher PCE of 1.62% resulted for the M4:PC71BM blend under the same conditions at 1:1 w/w blending ratios due to improved film morphology. The elementary device performance of these small molecules demonstrates that they are promising donor materials. Their efficiency is expected to enhance through device optimization by mixed solvents, thermal treatments, and additive treatments. We anticipate that our contribution will likely expand the scope of the relatively new naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene building block in organic photovoltaic work and especially in solution-processed small molecule solar cell applications.
