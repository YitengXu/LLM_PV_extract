Introduction
The synthetic chemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related polycyclic heteroaromatic systems has attracted increasing interest in the last several decades, because of the high application potential of these compounds as materials for organic electronics and photovoltaics.1–3 In general, aromatic molecules can be engineered to work as either p-type (donor, hole conducting) and n-type (acceptor, electron conducting) semiconductors. A wide range of p-type organic semiconductors have been developed, often showing remarkable performances, whereas the number of n-type materials is currently limited by the smaller range of suitable molecular structures and their often complex synthesis. A good n-type organic semiconductor should be solution processable and stable in air, while providing low electron injection barriers and high charge carrier mobilities.4,5 Electron-poor PAH derivatives meeting these criteria have been explored as n-type semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs),6 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),4,7–9 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and displays.10
In the current literature, there is no established criterion of electron deficiency, although this property is often implicitly linked with the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). It has been theoretically proven and empirically demonstrated that a LUMO energy of ca. −4 eV or lower (but not higher than −3 eV)11,12 is required to realize stable electron transport performance in an organic semiconductor.7 In practical terms, n-type behavior combined with air stability can be expected for systems with the first reduction potential lying in the −0.4 to −0.8 V range (versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple),13 in line with the LUMO energies given above.14 Thus, an upper LUMO energy limit of −3.5 eV can be assumed as a convenient criterion for selecting electron-deficient materials, and it will be used throughout this review.
Structural modifications can affect the LUMO energy to a varying extent. Homologation of aromatic frameworks, e.g. rylenediimides,15 results in progressive narrowing of energy bandgaps, but this effect is usually dominated by the increase of HOMO energies, and the LUMO levels are lowered to a smaller extent. Doping the aromatic structure with heteroatoms, notably with nitrogen16 or boron,17,18 is a more efficient strategy of LUMO engineering. The influence is however dependent on the placement of dopant sites, and combinations of different heteroatoms (e.g. B–N,19 B–O,20 or B–S21) may produce a diminished effect. Finally, the introduction of strongly electron-withdrawing groups and rings on the periphery of the polycyclic aromatic molecule can result in considerable lowering of the LUMO energy. Effective functionalities include e.g. imide and amide substituents, halogens (fluorine and chlorine), and some heterocyclic rings, such as benzothiadiazole.
Direct chemical functionalization of extended aromatic cores with electron-withdrawing groups is occasionally a remarkably successful strategy, illustrated by the recently reported examples of multiple carbamylation22 and chlorination23 reactions. Generally, however, the application of this approach is limited by deactivation of partly substituted intermediates, and unpredictable positional selectivity. Direct assembly of large aromatic frameworks from electron-poor components is thus a more popular strategy. Such syntheses usually rely on sequences of oxidative couplings,24 which have become the most general method of assembling nanographene-like molecules.3,25 The oxidative approach is however often inefficient with electron-poor targets, creating a demand for alternative synthetic strategies. In this review, we will discuss most recent developments in the synthesis of electron-deficient aromatics, with a focus on emerging carbocyclization strategies and new structural designs. To keep the length of the article within reasonable limits, we will mostly cover advances of the last 5 years, occasionally referring to earlier work. The use of carbon–heteroatom bond-forming annulations in the synthesis of polycyclic heteroaromatic systems has been summarized elsewhere.1,16,26 Herein, we will only discuss cases involving a C–C bond forming annulation.
PAHs containing several electron-withdrawing imide rings, in particular derivatives of perylene diimides (PDIs) and naphthalene diimides (NDIs), have been extensively explored as n-type semiconductors. By altering the topology, heteroatom doping, and geometry of the π-aromatic core in such imides, it is possible to control the optical and electronic properties of the generic NDI and PDI structures, as recently reviewed by the groups of Müllen27,28 Würthner,29 Li,30 and Wang.31 In this context, annulation reactions performed on the rylene core are conveniently classified in terms of the affected region of the aromatic unit (Fig. 1). Available synthetic strategies typically make use of prefunctionalized building blocks (Fig. 2), which are assembled into larger structures using sequential coupling reactions. As will be evident from the following discussion, current interest is focused on the development of selective annulation methods and concise synthetic protocols, especially ones based on tandem C–C bond couplings.

K-region-fused rylene imides
K-region functionalization (Fig. 1A) has been intensely investigated for naphthalene diimides, because of the easy accessibility of reactive building blocks, such as NDI-Br2 and NDI-Br4, and the favorable charge-transport characteristics of these systems.29 Among these reactions, some C–C bond-forming annulations have been reported, usually involving Pd-catalyzed chemistry. Catalytic direct arylation (CDA) reactions32 are of particular utility here, because (a) they require only one functionalized site (a C–X bond), (b) they can be used to close both six- and five-membered rings, and (c) they can be performed in tandem, enabling rapid development of complex frameworks.
A recent example of such work is provided by the two-step Stille-CDA pentannulation sequence, which was employed by the groups of L. Zhang and Y. Li in the synthesis of laterally π-extended NDI derivatives 1.3a–b (Scheme 1).33 Their synthesis, formally combining K- and L-region annulations, begins with the double Stille coupling of the distannyl derivative 1.1, available by catalytic stannylation of NDI-Br2.34 Double CDA pentannulation of the resulting 1.2a–b was achieved in the presence of DBU as the base, to provide moderate yields of 1.3a–b. Placement of four imide rings on the relatively compact fluorantheno[8,9-k]fluoranthene core results in a markedly electron-deficient character of 1.3a–b. For the more soluble 1.3a with branched alkyl chains, a LUMO energy of −4.2 eV was determined using electrochemical methods. Preliminary FET devices based on solution-processed microfibers of 1.3a–b exhibited electron mobilities of up to 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1. These values were three orders of magnitude higher than in corresponding thin film devices, because of the reduced number of grain boundaries.

 is a versatile building block,29 and has been used in a number of distinct annulation sequences35–37 (F3.1–F3.4, Fig. 3). Installation of four aryl groups on the NDI core, followed by oxidative coupling (as in F3.136) is of particular interest here, as it is likely to work with many electron-rich aromatic substituents. This strategy was recently implemented by Tani et al. in the synthesis of a tetracene diimide F3.4 containing four fused azulene units.38 The assembly of F3.4 was accomplished by means of the Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of NDI-Br4 with 2-azulenylboron pinacol ester, followed by oxidation with 2,3-dicyano-5,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ, Fig. 3). Tetracene F3.4 is a stable compound with good solubility in organic solvents. It is the first tetracene diimide for which four reversible one-electron reduction processes were observed.

The susceptibility of NDI-Br4 to nucleophilic substitution enables stepwise replacement of up to four Br atoms with various functional groups.29 An interesting tandem annulation, combining a nucleophilic displacement with a C–C bond-forming step, was reported by D. Zhao, J. Pei and co-workers (Scheme 2).39NDI-Br4 was found to react with naphthalene-1,5-diamine 2.1 to furnish initial tetraimide 2.2 in a one-pot reaction without using transition-metal catalysis. Each of the two annulations was proposed to consist of nucleophilic amination of a C–Br bond followed by an unusual SNAr C–C coupling step, with a C(sp2)–H fragment acting as the nucleophile. Further treatment of compound 2.2 with sodium 1,1-dicyanoethylene-2,2-dithiolate led to the formation of compound 2.3 with a more pronounced D–A character. The latter species showed an absorption maximum at ca. 1100 with ε > 1.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Such a strong NIR absorption, observed for the first time in a closed-shell polycyclic dicarboximide dye, was attributed to the substantially lowered LUMO level of 2.3 (−4.7 eV). In spite of such a low-lying LUMO and the narrow bandgap, 2.3 was stable for months under ambient conditions. Importantly, solution-processed OFETs based on 2.3 provided very high electron mobilities of up to 0.96 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compound 2.4, obtained in a nearly quantitative yield by oxidation of 2.2 with lead dioxide, had a similarly low LUMO energy (−4.66 eV). However, in contrast to 2.3, the latter system underwent partial autoreduction to 2.2 when stored under ambient conditions for only a few days.

The Müllen group reported a seven-step synthesis of o-phenyleno-fused naphthalene diimides 3.4a–b (Scheme 3).40 Initially, NDA-Br4 was converted into the tetraester 3.1, which was further functionalized by trimethylsilyl (TMS) acetylene groups using Stille coupling. In the presence of potassium carbonate, the TMS groups were removed to give the unstable product 3.2, which was used directly in the next step of core extension. Target diimides 3.4a–b were obtained by saponification and imidization of the intermediate tetraester 3.3. 3.4a showed strong absorption in the visible range, intense pink fluorescence and two reversible reduction peaks at −1.45 and −1.74 V vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively.

Higher rylene diimides containing rings fused to the K regions are typically obtained by L-region assembly of benzannulated rylene monoimides (cf.Scheme 7), whereas direct K-region annulation of such systems has so far been rarely performed.28 Propeller-like PDIs 4.3a−b, obtained by Z. Wang, W. Jiang et al. provide a recent example of the latter approach (Scheme 4).41 The four fused indole units in these molecules were constructed by nucleophilic substitution of the perhalogenated PDI derivatives 4.1a–b, and subsequent quadruple Pd-catalyzed annulation. Propellers 4.3a–b exhibited red shifted electronic spectra and LUMO levels of −3.64 and −3.67 eV, respectively. The chirality of these systems was, however, not explored.

“Angular” fusion in the K region (Fig. 1B) is rarely achieved by direct annulation of rylene imides.42 This type of modification is found in a recent synthesis of benzo[s]picene diimides 5.3 reported by Yin, Liu and co-workers (Scheme 5). These systems were prepared by dimerizing the dihalo-NMI derivative 5.1 under Suzuki–Miyaura conditions, and subsequent annulation of the resulting intermediate 5.2 with an arylboronic acid. The latter step combined two distinct catalytic bond forming events: a Suzuki coupling and subsequent CDA cyclization.

L-region-fused rylene imides
Intermolecular oxidative coupling of unfunctionalized NMI and PMI building blocks can be achieved at high temperatures in the presence of strong bases (Scheme 6, box).28 This simple approach, which enables direct syntheses of perylene-, terrylene-, and quaterrylenediimides, can be viewed as a generic method of L-region extension. However, even though self-coupling of naphthalenes has been known for a long time (cf.ref. 43), its practical utility is limited by the harsh reaction conditions. A better control over the selectivity of L-region annulations can be exerted when the first C−C bond is formed in a Pd-catalyzed reaction, to be followed by an oxidative benzannulation step. In its simplest incarnation, this approach can be used for the synthesis of unsymmetrically functionalized PDIs from NMI precursors, as recently shown by Hawker et al.44 A more elaborate example of this two-step strategy is found in the recent synthesis of sexterrylenetetracarboxylic bisimide 6.3 by Langhals et al. (Scheme 6).15 In that work, the terperylene precursor 6.2 was synthesized via a double Suzuki coupling and converted into the substituent-free sexterrylene 6.3 using the previously developed two-step oxidative annulation.45 Oxidative annulations in the L-region of ryleneimides typically produce six-membered rings. An interesting exception from this general behavior was observed by C. Li, Y. Li et al., who found that the PMI-corannulenyl hybrid 6.5 regioselectively produced the pentannulation product 6.6, when treated with PIFA−BF3·OEt2 at −40 °C (Scheme 6).46
 Scheme 6  Direct and stepwise oxidative approaches to extended rylene imides. Reagents and conditions:15,46 (a) Pd(PPh3)4, K2CO3/H2O, toluene/ethanol, 90 °C; (b) FeCl3, CH2Cl2, CH3NO2; (c) K2CO3, HOC2H4NH2, 130 °C; (d) PIFA, BF3·OEt2, −40 °C. 
The above approach is potentially limited by three factors: (1) the efficiency of the Pd-catalyzed biaryl coupling (usually either Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling), (2) the selectivity of the annulation step, and (3) potential side reactions. The first of these limitations was apparent in the synthesis of π-extended PDI derivatives 7.3a and 7.3c containing dibenzo[a,f]perylene cores, obtained by M. Murata, Y. Murata et al. (Scheme 7).47 The initial coupling between the hindered tetracene monoimide 7.1 and NMI-Bpin did not produce satisfactory yields under standard Suzuki conditions, and required the use of the Pd-PEPPSI-IPr catalyst system (N-diisopropylphenylimidazolium carbene-PdCl2-3-chloropyridine).48 In the cyclization step, the dihexyl derivative 7.2b underwent selective transimidization with the excess ethanolamine. This additional transformation was only observed on the NMI end of the product 7.3c, apparently because of the lower electrophilicity of the tetracene-fused imide ring. ortho-Fusion of benzene rings to the PDI core in 7.3a,c resulted in a twisting distortion of the fused ring system. In comparison with PDI itself, 7.3a is characterized by a reduced bandgap (1.54 eV) and somewhat higher reduction potentials. A similar synthetic concept was recently explored by Hawker et al. who prepared core extended rylene diimides 7.4 using the three-step annulation sequence discussed above.44

Segura and co-workers developed the synthesis of perylene imide derivatives 8.4a–b endowed with a cyclic 1,2-diketone functionality (Scheme 8).49 Unusually, the cyclodehydrogenation step was carried out under the classic Scholl conditions, which were found to produce better yields than base-promoted cyclizations or radical-cation coupling procedures. Subsequently, the BSA-mediated double oxygenation of the five-membered ring produced compounds 8.4a–b, which can be considered higher homologues of the previously reported naphthaleneimide diones.508.4a–b were subsequently condensed with various 3,4-diaminothiophenes, furnishing hybrid peryleneimides fused to thiophene (8.5a–b) and terthiophene units (8.6a) via pyrazine spacers (Scheme 8). LUMO energies determined for compounds 8.5a–b and 8.6a (−3.33 to −3.49 eV) were comparable to those of typical n-type semiconductors.

An important alternative approach to L-region annulation is provided by dehydrohalogenative couplings based palladium-catalyzed direct annulation (CDA) reactions. While these reactions resemble the Heck coupling, their actual mechanism is likely dependent on specific reaction conditions. In many cases, the cyclization can lead to both penta- and benzannulated isomers. Recent work, summarized below, has been focused on developing multiple annulations and single-step cascades, with the goal of rapid assembly of large polycyclic systems, often characterized by non-benzenoid ring fusion of low Clar-sextet counts.
F. Würthner and co-workers recently succeeded in developing a tandem strategy, capable of combining multiple inter- and intramolecular couplings into a synthetically useful annulation cascade. In a showcase example of this approach, a planar C64 nanographene 9.2 bearing four imide rings was obtained in one step from NMI-Br2 and 1,3,6,8-tetrasubstituted pyrene boronic acid ester 9.1 (Scheme 9).51 In the latter synthesis, ten C−C bonds are formed in a single chemical operation, providing 9.2 in a remarkably high yield of 15%. The reaction is performed under SPhos-assisted Suzuki–Miyaura conditions and formally consists of four Suzuki bond forming steps (red bonds, Scheme 9), four CDA annulations (blue), and two oxidative cyclodehydrogenations (green). 9.2 has an experimentally determined LUMO level of −3.81 eV.
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of an electron-poor C64 nanographene. Reagents and conditions:51 (a) Pd(dba)2, SPhos, Cs2CO3, toluene/H2O, 90 °C. 
The above tandem strategy is applicable to closures of five- and six-membered rings. It has so far been explored only for naphthalene monoimide building blocks, although it may be expected to work also with higher rylene units. In particular, the method was applied to the synthesis of electron-poor pseudo-rylenes built around pyrene52 (F4.1–F4.3) and corannulene53 cores (F4.4–F4.5, Fig. 4). The planar pyrene-based systems F4.1–F4.3 were prepared from NMI-Br2 and appropriate pyrene boronic acids. The reactivity was rationalized in terms of a Suzuki-CDA annulation cascade.52 For the construction of the bowl-shaped derivatives F4.4–F4.5, the strategy was additionally refined by introduction of NMI-BrCl as the dihaloarene coupling partner. The use of the latter building block helped suppress the competition of further intermolecular Suzuki couplings with the desired CDA cyclization. The latter step was additionally promoted by addition of tetrabutylammonium chloride to the reaction mixture.

The Suzuki−CDA cascade described above was subsequently found to exhibit base-dependent regioselectivity of the annulation step.54 Specifically, the use of an organic auxiliary base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), instead of cesium carbonate, produced moderate yields of pentannulated products (Fig. 5). In comparison with their benzannulated isomers, these new systems typically displayed somewhat less negative first reduction potentials (by ca. 0.15 V). The change of annulation selectivity in these reactions was attributed to different mechanistic pathways taken by the initially coupled intermediate F5.1. In contrast to the Heck-like benzannulation (Route A, Fig. 5), it was proposed that in the presence of the organic base (Route B), the reaction involves a C−H bond activation, according to a SEAr or concerted metalation−deprotonation mechanism, followed by reductive elimination. In this mechanism, the observed ring-size selectivity was linked to the steric preference for the formation of a 6-membered (rather than 7-membered) palladacycle intermediate. The amidine base was assumed to act as a competitive neutral σ-donor ligand, preventing the formation of an intermediate π-complex, and effectively suppressing the Heck route. It was also observed, in line with the proposed Heck mechanism, that the benzannulations did not occur at C−C bonds with low olefinic character.

A similar Suzuki−CDA cascade was used by Müllen et al. to synthesize terrylene mono- and diimides (e.g., 10.1, Scheme 10).55 The Pd/PCy3/K2CO3 catalytic system used in the latter work was observed to produce only benzannulation products, and it was additionally found to work in a reversed substitution scheme, i.e. with an electron-poor boronic acid (yielding 10.2). In a parallel effort, the Würthner group refined their method to include 1-chloronapthalene as the reaction solvent.56 In spite of the high reaction temperatures, the latter modification turned out to be remarkably general, providing high yields of complex polycyclic systems such as 10.3. The above method can even be used with an electron-deficient rylene block PMIBr2Cl4, to produce bay-chlorinated products such as 10.4.57

Two distinct approaches to electron-deficient zethrene systems, each based on L-region extension of a rylene imide, were recently reported by J. Wu and co-workers (Scheme 11). The synthesis of diaryl zethrene diimides 11.3 and 11.4, was achieved by Pd-catalyzed cyclodimerization of the ethynyl NMI precursors 11.1 and 11.2.58 This method differs from an earlier route based on transannular cyclization, providing access to first zethrene derivatives substituted in the bay regions. The reaction was additionally found to yield small amounts of a bay-annulated byproduct 11.5. A similar, more extended system 11.8, was obtained in a three-step sequence consisting of a double Suzuki coupling involving PMI-Bpin, followed by Friedel−Crafts cyclizations and dehydrogenation.59 Compound 11.8, which can be viewed as a perylene dimer bridged with a para-quinodimethane moiety or a doubly NMI-fused heptazethrene, a singlet biradical ground state and small singlet/triplet energy gap of −2.97 kcal mol−1. The LUMO energy of 11.8, calculated from CV data, was −4.01 eV.

Bay fusion of perylene diimides
Since the development of PDI-Br and regioisomerically pure PDI-Br2 derivatives,60,61 these building blocks, along with their ester analogues PTE-Br and PTE-Br2, have been commonly applied for the synthesis of bay extended PDIs.28 Bay-region benzannulations are typically achieved in two steps. First, aromatic substituents are attached by means of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling chemistry, and the resulting intermediates are subsequently annulated photochemically (via the Mallory reaction) or by using strong oxidants, such as FeCl3 (Scheme 12, box). While the choice between photochemical and chemical oxidation is not clear-cut, strained, helicene-like systems are more often obtained by photocyclization, whereas for efficient use of chemical oxidation, the substituent being coupled needs to be electron rich. An alternative approach to benzannulation involves the introduction of acetylene substituents and their further electrophilic cyclization.

These approaches provide rapid access to complex electron-deficient targets, containing benzo[ghi]perylene or coronene substructures, characterized by good solubility, and low-lying LUMO levels (ca. −3.7 eV). Recent examples of such systems include coronenediimides 12.862 and 12.9,63 and their larger congeners with fused naphthalene 12.1,64 phenanthrene 12.2,65 pyrene 12.366 and corannulene 12.6,46 as well as related benzoperylenediimides 12.4, 12.5,66 and 12.7.46 π-Extended PDI derivatives fused to two symmetrical units (such as 12.3 or 12.6) can be prepared directly from the isomeric mixture of 1,6- and 1,7-PDI-Br2, because of the regioconvergent character of the final double annulation.
The majority of reported bay-region carbocyclizations of PDIs result in singly or doubly benzo-fused products, i.e. benzo[ghi]perylenes or coronenes, respectively,28 whereas reported carbon−heteroatom bond-forming annulations mostly produce fused 5-membered rings.1 Bay fusion of pyridine rings was recently achieved by Würthner and co-workers (Scheme 13).67 They found that PDI-NH2 can be condensed with various aromatic aldehydes in a Pictet–Spengler reaction, to produce singly annulated products 13.1a–f. The use of molecular sieves and dry DMF shifted the equilibrium toward the formation of the iminium cation, thus improving the conversions of less active aldehydes. 1,6- and/or 1,7-diamino-PDIs reacted similarly to yield the corresponding bis-annulated products 13.2 and 13.3.

The PDI-Br and PDA-Br building blocks are commonly used for introducing multiple terminal PDI units into various π-extended assemblies. In the simplest design, bay regions of two PDI units are bridged via a fused aromatic moiety. A particularly efficient recent example of this strategy was reported by A. K.-Y. Jen and co-workers, who developed a series of fused systems 14.7–14.9, in which two PDI moieties are bridged respectively by a furan, thiophene, or selenophene ring (Scheme 14).68 Their synthesis consisted of a double Stille coupling, yielding dimers 14.4–14.6, which were subsequently annulated using the conventional FeCl3 oxidation. In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, the fused di-PDIs 14.7–14.9 exhibited reduced reorganization energies in comparison with 14.4–14.6, while their extended effective π-conjugation facilitated exciton diffusion and charge transport. The morphology, phase separation, and crystallinity in the bulk heterojunctions obtained from 14.7–14.9 were found to depend on the identity of the center heterocycle, which affected the alignment of the two PDI units. Compound 14.8 with a modest twist angle showed the most balanced structural features, resulting in the highest hole and electron mobilities, and consequently the best PCE of 6.72%.

The above method works well when the structure of the linker precludes the formation of regioisomers during annulation. When this condition is not fulfilled, the regioselectivity can sometimes be controlled by the choice of the annulation method. When a dichloromethane solution of 15.1 is illuminated by sunlight in the presence of a catalytic amount of diiodine, the helical dimer 15.3 forms in an excellent yield, accompanied by traces of the planar isomer 15.2 (Scheme 15).69 The latter species can be synthesized selectively in a two-step procedure, consisting of a thermally assisted photocyclization and chemical oxidation with DDQ. Tetraimides derived from 15.2 and 15.3 were recently explored by Marks, Wasielewski et al. as OPV acceptors,70 demonstrating the benefit of using a twisted rigid aromatic structure in the bulk heterojunction, similar to that observed by Jen and co-workers.

The two-step bay annulation strategy has recently found application in the synthesis of various thieno bridged dimers,70,71 such as the ladder-like bis-PDI F6.1, obtained in a very high-yielding synthesis by Yu, Goodson et al. (Fig. 6).71 Fluorescence quantum yields of such ladders decrease with the increasing linker length but the two-photon absorption cross-sections accordingly increase (up to 124.6 GM for F6.1). Extension of the linker is also possible in helicene systems, as recently demonstrated by Nuckolls and co-workers.72 Two homologous systems, F6.2 and F6.3 (Fig. 6) were obtained in an efficient sequence that combined Suzuki coupling with photocyclization. Compound F6.2 was configurationally stable even at very high temperatures, while its larger sibling F6.3 racemized at room temperature. Because of the electron-donating character of the acene linkers, LUMO levels of helicenes F6.2 and F6.3 were slightly higher than that of the parent PDI. The greater overlap of the π system in F6.2 enhances intramolecular through-space electronic delocalization when the system is reduced to the mono- and trianion, an effect that is not observed in the larger helicene, F6.3.

Bay annulation of PDI units offers an attractive approach towards electron-deficient graphene nanoribbons with predefined lengths.28 Of particular interest here is the recent work on non-planar ribbons, which are longitudinally twisted because of the steric repulsions in cove regions formed between adjacent subunits. Pei, Zhao and co-workers reported a bis-PDI system fused via a benzo[k]tetraphene subunit (16.4, Scheme 16).73 Their synthesis relied on an ICl-induced cyclization of a bis-acetylene precursor 16.1. The resulting intermediate 16.2 could not, however, be directly cyclized under catalytic conditions. The final annulation was accomplished by dehalogenation of 16.2, followed by oxidative photocyclization. Ring fusion in 16.4 resulted in a slight increase in the LUMO energy relative to 16.1 (−3.54 vs. −3.72 eV), accompanied by a reduction of the electron mobility in OTFT devices (0.014 vs. 0.079 cm2 V−1 s−1).

An efficient method of synthesizing longer PDI ladders was recently developed by the Nuckolls group (Fig. 7).74 The prototype system, F7.1, was obtained from the PDI-Br building block via Stille coupling with 1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethene, followed by photocyclization. Longer ribbons, up to a tetramer (F7.3), were then obtained by iterative application of the above approach. As expected, elongation of these structures resulted in the decrease of electronic bandgaps and a notable lowering of the LUMO energies. When employed in solar cell devices, the longest ribbons, F7.2 and F7.3 yielded PCE values of up to 8.3%.75 The repeat unit found in F7.1 is inherently helical but, according to the reported DFT calculations, it does not produce a uniform sense of helicity along the longer ribbons.74 Derivatives of F7.1 and F6.2 were recently obtained in a modified approach that employed PDI building blocks bearing methoxy groups in the bay regions.61 The use of OMe groups provided better control over regioisomeric purity and enabled redox-neutral photocyclizations.
 Fig. 7  PDI nanoribbons74 and their PDI-pyrene hybrid congeners.76,77 The twist of the cove regions is not indicated for the longer ribbons. 
In subsequent work, hybrid ribbons F7.4 and F7.5 were obtained by fusing the all-PDI oligomers (F7.1-Br and F7.2-Br) to a central pyrene unit.76 These highly twisted structures showed power-conversion efficiencies of up to 8% in unoptimized OPV devices. Related ribbons F7.6–F7.8 containing up to four PDI moieties alternating with pyrene units were reported by Y. Wu, L. Bai, et al.77 Iterative Suzuki coupling, used to assemble the oligomeric precursors of F7.6–F7.8, was difficult to optimize, whereas the final FeCl3-mediated annulation was very effective. All of these hybrid ribbons showed red fluorescence emission, with quantum yields increasing with the ribbon length (up to 0.72 for F7.8).
Bay-fused PDI moieties are also employed as terminal units in various branched assemblies, both two- and three-dimensional. The buildup of such structures often involves bay annulation steps, as seen in the recent syntheses of the truxene-cored PDI triad 17.178 and the fluorene-based tetrad 17.279 reported by Xiao and co-workers, and the triptycene-based system 17.3, developed by the groups of Wang and Li80 (Scheme 17). Both systems were obtained by means of the Suzuki-photocyclization sequence discussed above. Compound 17.1 possessed remarkable photostability, strong fluorescence (Φ = 0.40 in THF), and very high two-photon absorption cross-sections (11000 GM at 990 nm). Tetrad 17.2, characterized by strong absorption in the 300 to 550 nm range and a low-lying LUMO (−3.88 eV), was investigated as an acceptor in BHJ solar cells, providing a maximum PCE of 0.64%.

Bay photocyclization can be effective even in highly congested environments, as demonstrated by the recent synthesis of a C3-symmetric triple helicene system 17.4a–b by Wang, Li, Sun et al. (Scheme 17).81 This molecule consists of three PDI units fused to a central benzene ring and can be further annulated to produce the selenophene derivative 17.5. Both 17.4a–b and 17.5 absorbed strongly in the 300 to 600 nm region and had sufficiently low LUMO levels (ca. −3.8 eV) to be used in TFT and OPV devices. In particular, solar cells based on 17.4a–b and 17.5 showed very high power conversion efficiencies of 8.28 and 9.28%, the highest values recorded for PDI acceptors.
Acenaphthylene imides
In spite of the recent progress in the L-region chemistry of rylene imides, discussed above, some structures containing five-membered rings such as 18.1–18.3 (Scheme 18) are more easily synthesized by functionalization of acenaphthene than by direct annulation of naphthalimides. The use of acenaphthene-derived starting materials provides access to various pentannulated NMI assemblies, such as the recently reported acenaphtho[1,2-k]fluoranthene diimide 18.5, developed by J. Pei, Z. Su, et al. (Scheme 18).83 BHJ solar cells based on this system achieved PCEs of up to 0.33%.

NMIP, a new type of NMI-containing building block was recently reported by our group.84NMIP belongs to a larger class pyrrole-containing donor−acceptor hybrids, which are easily accessible from the diamide 19.1 (Scheme 19). 19.1 itself was synthesized in 6 steps from acenaphthene. While NMIP and related D−A pyrroles have theoretical LUMO energies higher than −3.0 eV,84 they can be used as building blocks for electron-deficient oligopyrrole chromophores. In particular, porphyrins 19.2-H2 and 19.4-H2 were efficiently obtained by condensing 19.1 and NMIP, respectively, using the Lindsey method. The more electron-rich monopyrrole 19.1 showed superior reactivity under these conditions, and in fact, 19.4-H2 was more efficiently accessed in a circuitous route involving a stepwise imidization of 19.2-H2. The zinc(II) complex of the tetra-NMI porphyrin, 19.4-Zn, is easily reduced (E(1)red = −0.97 V vs. Fc+/Fc) and can reversibly accept up to eight electrons when reduced electrochemically or chemically.

In subsequent work, we obtained the peripherally extended hexapyrrolohexaazacoronene 20.1 by reaction of NMIP with hexafluorobenzene, followed by oxidative coupling using excess of FeCl3 (Scheme 20).85 This large heterocycle, containing 37 fused rings shows extended redox activity, spanning at least 13 oxidation levels, but is otherwise chemically stable. With E(1)red = −1.26 V, 20.1 may be considered somewhat less electron deficient than the corresponding zinc porphyrin. Radial expansion of the π system in 20.1 results in a chromophore characterized by strong fluorescence and solvatochromism in the neutral state, and extended near-infrared absorption in the charged states.

Most recently, the NMIP-containing dipyrrolylmethane 20.2 and related systems were employed to explore the utility of double C−H bond activation in the synthesis of electron-deficient heteroaromatics (Scheme 20).86,87 It was found that the latter method provides efficient coupling in cases in which conventional oxidative annulations (e.g. ones employing FeCl3) are not effective. In particular, oxidation of 20.2 with Pd(OAc)2 in acetic acid produced an unprecedented dilactam product 20.3. In a subsequent mechanistic study, the formation 20.3 was found to involve the initial Pd-induced annulation, followed by two consecutive α-oxidations, and final oxidative deacetylation. The presence of a quinoidal substructure in 20.3 results in a markedly electron-deficient character of the π-conjugated system, electrochemically determined reduction potentials of E(1)red = −0.57 V and E(2)red = −0.83 V.
Phthalimide PAHs
Glyoxylic Perkin condensation
In the so-called glyoxylic Perkin (GP) reaction, an aryl-glyoxylic acid is condensed with an arylacetic acid in the presence of base and acetic anhydride, to yield maleic anhydride derivatives (Scheme 21, box). First reported in 1941 as a method of synthesizing diphenylmaleic anhydride,88 the reaction was subsequently combined with Mallory-type photocyclization, to yield some ortho-fused PAH-anhydrides.89 In 2013, H. Bock et al. reported a modified method,90 in which the GP reaction was followed by conversion of the anhydride to the diester, and then by palladium-catalyzed dehydrobromination, which was used as the annulation step (Scheme 21). This approach relies on the favorable Z-selectivity of the GP olefination and was subsequently found to be a general and efficient tool for constructing carboxy-functionalized polycyclic arenes.
 Scheme 21  Synthesis of dipyreno-anthracene via glyoxylic Perkin condensation and Pd-catalyzed dehydrobromination. Reagents and conditions:90 (a) NEt3, Ac2O, dioxane, reflux, 3 h, then addition of ROH, RBr, DBU, reflux; (b) Pd(OAc)2, PCy3, K2CO3, DMA, 110 °C; (c) (C11H23)2CHNH2, imidazole, C6H4Cl2, reflux. 
In subsequent work, the photocyclization-based protocol was employed by Bock's group for the synthesis of fused helicenes (Scheme 22, Fig. 8).91 Photocyclization allows direct coupling of two unfunctionalized sites, and, whenever the formation of isomers is possible, the formation of the more hindered (i.e., helicene-like) products is typically favored. In a complementary manner, the CDA annulation is usually more successful with unhindered targets containing planar, extended polycyclic skeletons. The two above approaches were further developed by Bock, Durola et al. who successfully employed various combinations of singly and doubly functionalized reactants, to construct a variety of imide-functionalized PAHs (F8.1,92F8.2–F8.3,93F8.4,90F8.5,94F8.6–F8.7,95F8.8,91F8.9–F8.12,96F8.13–F8.14,97Fig. 8). The presence of multiple imide rings imparts an electron deficient character to these systems. However, the effect is generally weaker than observed in ryleneimide derivatives, and the resulting LUMO values are usually somewhat higher than −3.5 eV, ranging from −3.13 eV for F8.4 to −3.45 eV for F8.2.

 Fig. 8  Polycyclic arene diimides obtained by Perkin condensation followed by Pd-catalyzed cyclization or oxidizing photocyclization (F8.1,92F8.2–F8.3,93F8.4,90F8.5,94F8.6–F8.7,95F8.8,91F8.9–F8.12,96F8.13–F8.1497). Bonds formed during final cyclization are marked in red. Imidation steps, which sometimes followed the cyclization, are not indicated. 
A similar strategy was employed in the work of J. Pei, D. Zhao, and co-workers, who prepared acene diimides F9.1–F9.5 (Fig. 9).98 Partially thionated analogues of the latter materials, F9.3S–F9.5S (ca. 50% S), were prepared using Lawesson's reagent, with yields of 40−48%. Interestingly, under identical conditions, compounds F9.1 and F9.2 gave unstable products, which apparently decomposed during the reaction. The thioimide derivatives exhibit LUMO energies of −3.76 (F9.3S), −3.83 (F9.4S) and −3.90 eV (F9.5S), systematically lower than observed for their oxo analogues (−3.40, −3.54 and −3.67 for F9.3, F9.4, and F9.5, respectively). The stability of the thioimides F9.3S–F9.5S was however limited and they were found to gradually decompose under ambient conditions.
 Fig. 9  Polycyclic aromatic diimides and their partially thionated derivatives. Bonds formed during final cyclization are marked in red.98 
As many other approaches, the above method reaches its limits when the increasing size of building blocks results in low solubility of the intermediates and final products. The 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 condensation strategies discussed above, yield respectively only one and two imide rings, which can be used as functionalization sites. To overcome this problem, F. Durola, et al. proposed a modified approach involving the use of aryl diacetic acid monoesters as singly protected, doubly functionalized building blocks for the Perkin condensation between arylacetic acids and arylglyoxylic acids.99 Through this modification, linear condensations of more than three building blocks were achieved, producing well-defined oligomers with a greater number of solubilizing ester substituents (Scheme 23). For instance, the protected monofunctional product 23.3 was obtained in excellent yield from 23.1 and 23.2, demonstrating compatibility of the ester protection with Perkin reaction conditions. 23.3 was then saponified and used to obtain the flexible oligomer 23.6, which was functionalized with butyl chains for better solubility. Quadruple CDA annulation performed on the latter compound furnished the poorly soluble product 23.7, which could nevertheless be characterized by mass spectrometry. However, because NMR data were not obtained, the authors could not rule out the formation of isomeric products. The solubility problem was not experienced in the synthesis of the smaller acene 23.8, which was obtained in a similar synthetic scheme from three functionalized naphthalene building blocks (Scheme 23, box). In the case of 23.8, photocyclization was used instead of catalyzed annulations.

The use of two doubly functionalized reactants in a GP reaction can be expected, at appropriately high dilution, to yield macrocyclic products. In further work from Durola et al., reactions of 4,4′-bis(phenylglyoxylic acid) 24.2 with either 4,4′-bis(phenylacetic acid) 24.1 or p-phenylenediacetic acid 24.3, followed by fourfold oxidative photocyclization, produced two partially fused products, saddle-shaped cyclophane 24.4 and figure-eight propellicene 24.5, respectively (Scheme 24).100 These two macrocycles had electrochemically determined LUMO levels of −2.79 and −2.86 eV, respectively, but they would likely be lowered upon conversion into corresponding tetraimide derivatives.

Other routes to phthalimide PAHs
Diverse structural modifications of large acene systems are currently explored with the goal of increasing their stability and tailoring their semiconducting properties. Several routes toward such systems have been developed, as recently summarized by Chi et al.101,102 In this context, incorporation of phthalimide subunits into acene structures is of particular interest as it results in lowering of LUMO energies and n-type behavior. One of the more general approaches to such extended phthalimides capitalizes on the use of maleic acid derivatives as dienophiles in direct Diels−Alder annulations. A representative recent example of such a strategy is the synthesis of diacenopentalene dicarboximide 25.5, which was developed by Chi, Dai, et al. as an organic semiconducting material for OFETs (Scheme 25).103 In that work, a reactive quinodimethane104 was generated in situ from 25.1 and cyclized with 25.2 to produce the annulated building block 25.3 (Scheme 25). Sonogashira coupling of the latter with phenylacetylene gave the mono-substituted product 25.4 which was converted into the target fused pentalene 25.5 by palladium-catalyzed cyclodimerization. Compound 25.5 has high thermal stability and features a relatively low-lying LUMO energy level at −3.76 eV, yielding an average n-type semiconducting performance.

Ovalene derivatives possessing electron withdrawing groups can be prepared using the cycloaddition method originally reported by Clar105 and subsequently developed by Bock and co-workers.106 More recently, the method was applied by J. Wu et al. to prepare the diimide derivative 26.3 (Scheme 26).107 The dicyanoovalene 26.5 was subsequently obtained by electrophilic bromination, which occurs selectively at positions 7 and 14, followed by Pd-catalyzed cyanide exchange. The combination of strong electron-withdrawing cyano and dicarboximide groups in 26.5 significantly enhanced its electron affinity and air stability. With a LUMO level of −3.90 V, 26.5 was used to prepare solution-processed OFET devices, which displayed high electron mobilities of up to 0.51 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air.

In the majority of available methods, imide rings are formed via cyclization of two carboxylic groups or conversion of preexisting cyclic anhydrides. With few exceptions,22 late stage acylation of large aromatic cores is typically avoided. An interesting alternative to the latter paradigm is offered by the isocyanate acylation reaction, which was shown by Mayer et al. to yield 1,8-naphthalimide (Scheme 27, box).108 A modification of this method, involving the use of Bi(OTf)3 as the Lewis acid catalyst, was later probed by Yamada et al., who found that acenedicarboxylic acids 27.1a–c could be converted to acenediimides 27.2a–c in moderate yields.109 The LUMO levels of these systems decreased with acene length (down to −4.17 eV for 27.2c) and n-type behavior was demonstrated for tetracene derivatives in OFET devices. Interestingly, the Mayer reaction showed different regioselectivity when performed on pyrene-1,6-dicarboxylic acid dichloride 27.3. Pei, Wu, Wang, et al. found that 27.5 reacts with isopropyl isocyanate to produce exclusively the double pentannulation product 27.6.11027.6 is selectively borylated at positions 4 and 9, and the resulting derivative 27.7 is of considerable interest as a prefunctionalized building block. In particular, it was converted into the electron-deficient dicyano derivative 27.8, with electrochemically determined LUMO of −3.84 eV.

Other annulation strategies
Even though the chemistry of electron deficient PAHs has been dominated by the synthesis of naphthalimide and phthalimide derivatives, the electronic properties of aromatic cores can be controlled with other functionalities. Nitrile groups, which are of particular interest because of their strongly electron-withdrawing character, are typically introduced via catalytic halogen exchange or by Knoevenagel condensations with malononitrile. Alternatively, Hinsberg's classical benzannulation between an o-xylylene dicyanide and a 1,2-dicarbonyl compound111 can be used to create a benzene ring bearing two CN groups. A recent application of this reaction to synthesize an electron deficient nanographene, tetrabenzoheptacene 28.3 was reported by Mateo-Alonso et al.112 Compound 28.3 was prepared in 40% yield by condensation of 2,7-di-tert-butylpyrene-4,5-dione 28.1 and tetracyanomethylbenzene 28.2 under basic conditions (Scheme 28). However, the reaction proceeded well only on a scale of up to ca. 50 mg. Introduction of four cyano groups simultaneously induced a twist in the aromatic framework and stabilized the LUMO level (−3.87 eV using electrochemistry). Product 28.3 exhibited n-type semiconducting behavior with electron mobilities of up to 6.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These values remained comparably high even after thermal annealing at 280 °C, indicating high thermal stability of this material.

A novel tandem annulation of rylene anhydrides with acetylanilines was reported by the Müllen group (Scheme 29).113 In initial experiments, condensation of 2-acetylaniline with 1,8-naphthalic anhydride 29.1 was found to produce two isomeric quinoline derivatives 29.2 and 29.3, which can be conveniently regarded as heterocyclic benzanthrone derivatives. The synthesis showed a striking dependence on reaction conditions.

When imidazole was utilized as the condensation agent, the 4-hydroxyquinoline derivative 29.2 was obtained. When using quinoline as solvent with addition of catalytic amount of zinc acetate, the reaction selectively generated the 4-oxoquinoline derivative 29.3. Mechanistic investigations showed that the formation of 29.3 took place under kinetic control, with the imidization step followed by aldol cyclization. In the more nucleophilic imidazole solvent, the initial imidization was reversible and the thermodynamic product 29.2 was obtained instead. When 29.1 was reacted with 2,6-diacetyl-4-tert-butylaniline, dione 29.5 was formed both in quinoline and imidazole. Perylene anhydrides were found to exhibit analogous reactivity, yielding a family of extended heteroaromatic systems F10.1–F10.5 (Fig. 10).

The electron-deficient character of 29.2, 29.3, and 29.5 was manifested by the observed stabilization of their LUMO levels (−3.34, −3.81, and −3.48 eV, respectively). A further shift of LUMO energies was achieved by condensing 29.3 and 29.5 with malononitrile. In the resulting systems, 29.4 and 29.6, LUMO energy levels of −3.68 and −4.11 eV, respectively, were determined electrochemically, indicating potential use of these molecules as n-type semiconductors.
Tilley et al. developed a general synthetic approach to large, nitrogen-containing PAHs (Scheme 30).114 Their strategy, based on earlier work on oligo(diyne) cyclization from the same group,115,116 involves two key steps: (1) a titanocene-mediated reductive cyclization of an oligo(dinitrile) precursor to form a PAH appended with di(aza)titanacyclopentadiene functionality; (2) a divergent titanocene transfer reaction, which allows final-step installation of one or more o-quinone, diazole, or pyrazine units onto the PAH framework. The titanocene intermediates 30.6–30.8 were not isolated but could be observed by NMR spectroscopy. On addition of di-n-propyl acetylenedicarboxylate, 30.6–30.8 were converted into pyrazine-annulated compounds 30.9–30.11, thus providing the first example of pyrazine synthesis in a formal 2 + 2 + 2 cycloaddition. The NEt2-substituted bis(dinitrile) 30.4 was subjected to the titanocene-coupling/chalcogen transfer reactions which produced bis(chalcogenadiazoles) 30.14–30.16. Finally, bis(o-quinone) 30.13 was produced from 30.8 upon treatment with hydrogen chloride. In cyclic voltammetry, 30.13 showed three chemically reversible reductions (−1.16, −1.32, and −1.91 V vs. Fc+/Fc), indicative of its expected electron-deficient character.
 Scheme 30  Large, angular PAHs via twofold titanocene-induced coupling. Reagents and conditions:114 (a) Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, K3PO4·nH2O, toluene, 115 °C; (b) toluene, 22 °C, 15 min; (c) HCl(anhydr), Et2O; ii. HClaq, MeOH, 70 °C. 
Conclusions
As we attempted to show in this account, the synthetic chemistry of electron-poor aromatics has expanded considerably in recent years, not only by iterative application of existing preparative protocols, but also through the introduction of new building blocks, and new or refined synthetic strategies. Tandem Pd-catalyzed methods are of particular importance here, because they can potentially lead to very short and robust syntheses of large aromatic cores. At the same time, the revival of such methods as the Perkin or aldol condensation demonstrates the prospective utility of the classical reaction toolbox.
The advances described above have been largely driven by specific needs of organic semiconductor technologies, and aimed at providing control over electronic bandgaps, LUMO energies, and solid-state packing. The latter property is affected by the two-dimensional extent of the aromatic core, and can benefit from judiciously designed deviations from planarity. The future of this field critically depends on the development of efficient and scalable methods capable of producing nanoscale molecular materials with precisely controlled electronic properties.
