    , Accepted 2nd March 2021First published on 4th March 2021AbstractA side-chain-extended conjugation strategy is demonstrated here to improve the photocatalytic performance of a linear conjugated polymer for hydrogen production from water. For this, polymers P0, P1, and P2 were designed and synthesized based on benzodithiophene and dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide. Compared with P0, P1 and P2 have two additional thiophene units conjugated in the polymer skeleton along the main-chain and side-chain directions, respectively. Studies found that side chain-conjugated functionalization in P2 enhances thermal stability, redshifts light-absorption bands, narrows the polymer bandgap, prolongs the exciton lifetime, enlarges the photocatalytic over-potential, increases charge mobility, reduces charge transport resistance, and thus improves the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) by a factor of 160 fold. Although performance improvement is still observed in P1, the factor is only 3.6 fold. Thus, P2 exhibits the most promising performance among the three polymers with a HER of 20314 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of 3 wt% Pt cocatalyst and a record apparent quantum yield of 7.04% at 500 nm, rendering it an excellent green light photocatalyst.
Introduction
Photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water using solar energy has been recognized as one of the promising solutions to provide a green, renewable and sustainable energy source alternative to fossil fuels and has been extensively studied since 1972.1 Although transition metal oxide- and sulfide-based inorganic photocatalysts dominate field studies,2–7 organic semiconductors bearing a large π-conjugated structure have emerged as a new class in the past decade and drawn particular attention due to their diversity, designability, and synthetic flexibility in chemical structures and easy modulation in frontier orbital energy levels and bandgaps.8–11 So far, a variety of organic semiconductor photocatalysts, including linear conjugated polymers (LCPs),12–14 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs),15–17 covalent organic frameworks (COFs)18–21 and carbon nitrides22–26 have been developed, and some of them achieved a hydrogen evolution rate (HER) over 10000 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation.27–29 However, when the photo-action spectrum and apparent quantum yields (AQYs) at specific wavelengths are concerned, few of them showed an enough wide photoactive region with sufficiently large AQY values to afford reasonable solar-to-hydrogen energy (STH) conversion efficiency. It has been calculated and found that only around 2% STH efficiency was achieved for a photocatalyst absorbing light up to 400 nm with AQYs of 100% throughout its absorption spectrum.30,31 For 10% STH target, which has been believed to be basically needed for their practical use, photocatalysts with AQYs of 100% should absorb light up to 520 nm. But when AQYs decrease to 60%, the light absorption edge should extend to 600 nm. However, at present, only a few state-of-the art systems can deliver AQYs slightly exceeding 10% at their optimal wavelengths, which are mostly in the range of 400–500 nm.8–11,32,33 When the wavelength shifts above 500 nm, very rare cases can give AQYs larger than 5%.34 Obviously, the field still lacks efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts and further material innovation is highly desired.
In principle, high performance photocatalysts require strong light-harvesting capability (large molar absorption coefficients, wide light-absorption spectrums, etc.), right lying energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to provide sufficient overpotentials, efficient exciton dissociation, and effective charge carrier transport to catalytic sites. And being a heterogeneous catalyst, the surface area, the affinity to reactive species and the number of active sites on the surface are other important factors that influence its catalysis. Aiming to improve these processes and factors, scientists so far have proposed numerous outstanding strategies and consequently invented many excellent organic semiconductor catalysts. For example, CMPs and COFs bearing intrinsic branched geometry and a porous structure have been developed or the available surface area has been increased.15–21,35–37 The construction of a donor–acceptor (D–A) alternative structure is a popular approach for achieving a narrow bandgap, tuning HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and promoting charge separation in the field of organic semiconductors38–41 and is also applied in the design of photocatalysts.8–11 The use of large fused and planar building blocks,27 the modification of backbone units with electron-withdrawing or donating substituents,42,43 such as fluoro-, cyano-, methyl and methoxyl, and the insertion of an acetylene unit into the backbone44 were conducted to shift the absorption bands, modulate frontier orbital energy levels, and regulate the charge transfer direction. More recently, a molecular heterojunction was adopted in COFs and found to facilitate charge carrier separation and suppress charge carrier recombination.45 Fine control of local conjugation and charge transfer pathways in D–A polymers was proved to minimize the exciton binding energy.46 Undoubtedly, all these strategies enable a more rational design of organic photocatalysts and push the field forward.
In this contribution, we report a side-chain extended conjugation modification strategy, i.e., applying conjugated side chains to functionalize photocatalytic polymers. It means the polymer π-conjugated system is expanded not along the backbone direction but also along the side chain direction, and thus becomes more two-dimensional. This would greatly reinforce interchain π–π interactions and facilitate the interchain transfer of charge carriers. Moreover, the conjugation modification can generally narrow the material bandgap, redshift light-absorption bands, and modulate HOMO and LUMO energy levels, and thus would exert great impact on photocatalytic performance. To be honest, this strategy has been already reported for other organic semiconductors,47–49 especially for organic photovoltaics.48,49 But it has not yet been used to design organic photocatalysts.
To prove its applicability, three polymers, P0, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1), were designed with a D–A structure basically composed of dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (DBTSO) and benzodithiophene (BDT). DBTSO is a promising building block for efficient organic photocatalysts due to its hydrophilicity and electron-withdrawing nature. Based on this, a number of high performance photocatalytic polymers, including LCPs, CMPs and COFs, have been developed, some of which represent the state-of-the-art level of organic photocatalysts.13,27–33,43,46,50–54 For example, the homopolymer of DBTSO (P10) prepared by conventional Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation displayed a HER of 3260 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation,32 while it increased to 60600 μmol g−1 h−1 when it was prepared using mini-emulsion polymerization.53 When it copolymerized with triazine, the yielded CMP (triazine-Th-CPP) exhibited a HER of 16287 μmol g−1 h−1 and an AQY of 61.5% at 365 nm.29 A crystalline COF (FS-COF) based on its fused dimer delivered a HER of 16300 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of an infrared dye (WS5F) as a co-sensitizer.27 More recently, a fluorinated DBTSO-based CMP (PyDF) reported an impressing HER of 18929 μmol g−1 h−1 under full-arc light irradiation and a HER of 13470 μmol g−1 h−1 under visible light irradiation.43 On the other hand, BDT is a popular building block in the construction of photovoltaic conjugated polymers, a number of them show outstanding performance and assist organic solar cells in increasing power conversion efficiency rapidly with a record over 17% in the past decade.55,56 Through its 2,6- and 4,8-positions, π-conjugation can be easily prolonged two dimensionally. This strategy has been often adopted in BDT-based linear photovoltaic materials and proved to favour their performances.57–60 In the field of photocatalysis, such two-dimensionally extended BDT units were engaged as a branching building block in preparation of a series of CMPs, in which the best HER using 3.5 mg photocatalyst reached ∼33 μmol h−1 (9400 μmol h−1 g−1).15,61 However, the studies did not report the impact of such two-dimensionally π-conjugated functionalization on photocatalytic performance. Therefore, we were motivated to combine it with DBTSO for construction of photocatalytic polymers. As shown in Fig. 1, compared with P0, P2 places two additional thiophene units in the 4,8-position of BDT, i.e., the side chain direction, and endows its BDT unit with prolonged conjugation along not only the main chain direction but also the side chain direction. In order to clearly identify the influence of the conjugated side chain, we also designed polymer P1, which integrates these two additional thiophene units in the backbone of the main chain. Surprisingly, such different modifications not only bring different π-extended conjugations in P1 and P2, but also result in huge different improvements in their photocatalytic performances. As referred to P0, the modification provides P2 a side-chain extended conjugation and remarkable improvement in the HER with an increasing factor up to 160 fold. In comparison, the modification also brings a main-chain extended conjugation and an improved HER for P1. But the increasing factor is only 3.6 fold. Therefore, P2 displays the most promising photocatalytic hydrogen production performance with a HER around 10000 μmol g−1 h−1 in the family. On incorporation with a Pt co-catalyst, P2 further increased its HER to an impressive value of 20314 μmol g−1 h−1. Moreover, its AQY reached 7.04% at 500 nm and 5.06% at 550 nm, rendering P2 one of outstanding green light photocatalysts.

Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water
All photocatalysis experiments were carried out on a CEL SPH2N system purchased from Beijing Zhongjiaojinyuan Company. The system was equipped with a home-made soda lime glass reaction cell having a gas-tight quartz top cap and a total volume of 30 mL, a 300 W Xe lamp, a vacuum and auto-sampling apparatus, and a gas chromatograph (GC-7920) with a thermal conductive detector. In a typical experiment, 3.5 mg polymer was dispersed into 16 mL H2O/MeOH/DMF/triethyl amine (TEA) mixed solvent with a volume ratio of 8/2/1/5 under the assistance of ultrasonication. The suspension was transferred into the reaction cell, sealed with a quartz cap, and subjected to degassing using a vacuum pump for 30 min. Afterwards, the 300 W Xe lamp was turned on to start the photoreaction. A water bath was used to keep the reaction temperature around 5 °C. In the desired interval, the atmosphere in the reaction cell was automatically sampled and analysed using a gas chromatograph using N2 as the carrier gas. The produced hydrogen amount was obtained by calculation against a working curve, whose data were detected by injecting pure hydrogen with a known volume into the same reaction cells and sampled using a gas chromatograph in the same manner.
For the determination of apparent quantum yields at different wavelengths, a series of bandpass filters were used to achieve monochromic light-like irradiation centred at 420, 450, 500, 550, and 600 nm. And a calibrated power meter (CEL-NP200) was used to measure the light density (I). And the apparent quantum yield was calculated using the following equation:  where NH2 is the molar amount of hydrogen produced in a unit time, NA is the Avogadro constant, h is the Planck constant, c is the light velocity in a vacuum, I is the light intensity, A is the light irradiation area, and λ is the light wavelength. In our experiments, the light irradiation area was measured to be 5.23 cm2, and the light intensities to be 1.99 mW cm−2 at 420 nm, 2.00 mW cm−2 at 450 nm, 2.42 mW cm−2 at 500 nm, 1.93 mW cm−2 at 550 nm, 1.84 mW cm−2 at 600 nm, and 1.77 mW cm−2 at 650 nm.
Results and discussion
Polymer characterization and properties
As described in the above Experimental section, the as-prepared P0, P1, and P2 are all powder solids and have poor solubility in most common solvents. Therefore, in order to identify their structures, solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2a, all three polymers displayed similar intense peaks in the range of 0–40 ppm, assignable to carbons of alkyl side chains. In the spectra of P0 and P1, a peak at 76 ppm was observed, which originates from alkoxy carbon. This peak did not show up in the spectrum of P2 because the alkoxy groups were replaced by the conjugated thiophene moieties. In the aromatic region, the carbon signal of the sulphonyl group appeared at around 140 ppm for all three polymers, while the integrated thiophene units in P1 and P2 were presented at certain intensified peaks around 135 ppm. Moreover, TGA was performed to study the thermal stabilities of the polymers (Fig. 2b). It was found that the 5% weight loss-temperature (Td) is 305.9 °C for P0, 285.3 °C for P1, and 444.9 °C for P2. Clearly, as compared to P0, P2 with side-chain-extended conjugation has greatly enhanced thermostability, while P1 with main-chain-extended conjugation conversely decreases thermostability slightly. This implies that the side-chain-conjugated modification greatly strengthens noncovalent interactions among polymer chains.
 Fig. 2  (a) Solid-state 13C NMR spectra, (b) TGA curves, (c) powder XRD patterns, and (d–f) SEM and (g–i) TEM images of P0, P1, and P2. 
The morphologies and crystalline properties of the polymers were investigated by SEM, TEM and powder XRD. As can be seen from the SEM images (Fig. 2d–f), the particles of all these polymers have a layered structure. Their TEM images (Fig. 2g–i) further support this observation, although not in a very clear manner. Furthermore, in their XRD profiles (Fig. 2c), a peak assignable to (100) diffraction of the layer structure appeared at 5.6° for P0, 6.0° for P1, and 4.7° for P2. Based on these data, the layer distances were calculated to be 1.58 nm for P0, 1.47 nm for P1, and 1.88 nm for P2. Obviously, the integration of two thiophene units in the side chain direction enlarges the layer distance, while backbone functionalization slightly shortens it. Moreover, it was noteworthy that two wide and weak peaks around 18.4 and 24.5° with d-spacings of 0.48 and 0.36 nm, respectively, showed up in the P2 XRD profile in addition to the above (100) diffraction peak, whereas only a broad halo diffraction without distinguished peaks was observed in the same region of P0 and P1 profiles. Since the d-spacing of 0.36 nm is quite close to the layer distance of graphite (0.34 nm), the presence of such a peak is mostly due to the occurrence of π–π stacking among the polymer chains. This illustrates that side chain-extended conjugation modification strongly reinforces interchain π–π interactions and stacking, which would benefit interchain transport of photo-generated excitons and charge carriers.
UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy was used to investigate polymer light-harvesting properties and found that the three polymers have intense light absorption in the region of 300–600 nm (Fig. 3a). In this region, P0 has two absorption peaks around 394 and 478 nm, while P1 has only one with a redshifted apex at 493 nm. However, in the case of P2, up to four peaks (or shoulders) around 353, 430, 480, and 520 nm were observed, making P2 the most suitable polymer for light absorption among the family. The Tauc plots displayed in Fig. S1† show that the optical bandgaps are 2.32 eV for P0, 2.23 eV for P1, and 2.22 eV for P2. These data illustrate that the main chain- and side chain-extended conjugations are valid in red-shifting polymer light-absorption bands. Judging from the changes in the longest λmax, the latter seems to be more effective. This can be vividly confirmed by the naked eye because the color of their DMF dispersions changes from bright yellow in P0 to berry red in P1, and then to orange red in P2 (Fig. 3a inset).

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are important parameters for a photocatalyst. Fig. 3b displays the measured CV profiles of the polymers. From them, the onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eox, onset and Ered, onset) were determined to be 1.113 and −1.027 V for P0, 1.093 and −0.997 V for P1, and 0.583 and −1.167 V for P2, respectively. Since the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (EFc/Fc+) bearing a energy level of 4.8 eV from vacuum was measured to be 0.063 V under the same conditions, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.85 and −3.71 eV for P0, −5.83 and −3.74 eV for P1, and −5.32 and −3.57 eV for P2 using the equations EHOMO = −(Eox, onset − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8) and ELUMO = − (Ered, onset − EFc/Fc+ + 4.8), respectively (Fig. 3c). It is clear that, as compared to that of P0, the LUMO of P2 resides in a much shallower position, while that of P1 stays in almost the same level. Since the hydrogen evolution overpotential is the difference between the proton reduction potential (EH+/H2, it is −4.5 eV at pH = 0, while −3.79 eV at pH = 12) and the LUMO energy level of the catalyst, P2 undoubtedly can provide the largest overpotential among the family. Therefore, the side-chain extended conjugation in P2 not only red-shifts the polymer light absorption spectrum, but also endows a shallower lying LUMO, both favorable to photocatalytic performance.
In order to gain insight into the fundamental molecular geometry and electronic properties of the polymers, density functional theoretical (DFT) computation was performed on the basic polymer repeating units using a Gaussian09 program using the B3LYP method with the 6-31G basis set. As shown in Fig. 3d, all three polymers have HOMO electron density mainly residing on the BDT unit, while LUMO electron density was located at the DBTSO unit, confirming the D–A feature and the intramolecular charge transfer characteristic of generated excitons. Moreover, it was found that the newly added thiophene units in P1 have a good planar structure against adjacent BDT and DBTSO units with dihedral angles of 0 and 13.8°, respectively. In comparison, the dihedral angle between the newly added thiophene units and central BDT unit in P2 is as large as 51.9°, revealing a twisting structure for side chain modification. But even so, the HOMO electron cloud is found to delocalize into the newly added thiophene units in both P1 and P2, illustrating the extended π-conjugation. This is consistent with the above optical observations.
Photocatalytic hydrogen production performance
Photocatalytic hydrogen production was performed by dispersing 3.5 mg tested polymer into 16 mL H2O/MeOH/DMF/TEA mixed solvent with a volume ratio of 8/2/1/5. Here, TEA served as a sacrificial agent (SA), while MeOH and DMF were used mainly as co-solvents to assist the dispersion of the polymer catalyst. Such roles were confirmed by the control experiments without the addition of TEA, in which almost no hydrogen was produced. Upon exposure to a 300 W Xe lamp, all three polymer systems were found to continuously produce hydrogen, but with quite different rates (Fig. 4a). The HER of P0 was 68 μmol g−1 h−1, whereas those of P1 and P2 were 247 and 10850 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Clearly, P2 displayed the most efficient photocatalysis. Its HER increased 160 fold as compared to that of P0. In comparison, P1 also showed an improved performance, but the enhancement factor was only 3.6 fold.

(d) Hydrogen evolutions of P2 with and without the addition of a Pt co-catalyst. (e) Wavelength-dependent apparent quantum yields of P2 together with its UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. Conditions: 3.5 mg polymer photocatalyst, 16 mL H2O/MeOH/DMF/TEA (v/v/v/v: 8/2/1/5) mixture, exposed to a 300 W Xe lamp, 3 wt% Pt added as a cocatalyst in (d, e). 
Since P2 is much superior to P0 and P1 in photocatalytic hydrogen production, it was subjected to a detailed study. First, when the polymer dosage was changed from 3.5 mg to 5 and 6.5 mg, the hydrogen evolution rate was determined to be 8141 and 9901 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Both are not substantially different from that in the 3.5 mg case (10850 μmol g−1 h−1). Second, its stability after the photoreaction was investigated by means of XPS, SEM, and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4b, the XPS signals of S 2p, C 1s and O 1s did not change after the photoreaction, indicating the robust chemical stability of P2. Also, the SEM and TEM images before and after the photoreaction confirm no substantial change in the reaction (Fig. S2 and S3†). Third, five light ON–OFF cycles were applied and found that the HER changed from 7230 to 11720, 11640, 10350 and 9600 μmol g−1 h−1, confirming the stable hydrogen production and good stability of the polymer catalyst (Fig. 4c). Fourth, since Pt nanoparticles have been well documented as a cocatalyst for light-driven hydrogen production from water, the addition of Pt nanoparticles was investigated. It was found that the HER greatly boosted to 20314 μmol g−1 h−1 when 3 wt% Pt was loaded (Fig. 4d). Under these conditions, we also investigated the use of other sacrificial agents, such as triethanolamine (TEOA) and ascorbic acid (AA). However, both exhibited much inferior performance as compared to TEA (Fig. S4†). Finally, the photo-action spectrum was recorded by determining a series of AQYs at various specific wavelengths. As seen from Fig. 4e and its inset, the AQYs of P2 polymer were 2.13% at 420 nm, 2.49% at 450 nm, 7.04% at 500 nm, 5.06% at 550 nm, and 0.96% at 600 nm. It is valuable to point out that most reported photocatalytic conjugated polymers present their highest AQYs in the region of 420–450 nm, as shown in Table S1.†5–11,13,15,27–29,32,42–46,50–54 When the wavelength is longer than 500 nm, their AQYs quickly decrease and rarely exceed 5%. For example, the conventional Suzuki-coupling polymerization prepared P10 gave an AQY of 11.6% at 420 nm, but no data were available for other wavelengths.32 Although its HER can be increased to 44200 μmol g−1 h−1 in the presence of KH2PO4 (ref. 28) and to 60600 μmol g−1 h−1via mini-emulsion polymerization,53 the highest AQY was reported to appear at 420 nm with the values of 8.5% and 5.8%, respectively. And the AQY at 500 nm was estimated to be 2.7% for the former system, while no data at other wavelengths were reported for the latter one. Although numerous conjugated polymers, such as P7,13P7-E,44B-BT-1,4-E,44N-PDBT-O,52P-FSO,51DBTD-CMP1,50PCP4e,15FS-COF,27CTF-BT/Th-1,45triazine-Th-CPP,29FSO-FS,46B-FOBT-1,4E,42P64,54 and Py-DF43 listed in Table S1,† exhibit impressing HER performance, none of them reported AQY values larger than 3% at wavelengths longer than 500 nm. In our previous work, we used diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), a strong electron-deficient and efficient light absorption moiety, as a building block, and the obtained DPP-bdy-TPA CMP showed AQYs of 9.60% at 420 nm, 8.56% at 450 nm, and 7.32% at 500 nm.34 But they quickly dropped to 2.30% at 550 nm and 0.31% at 600 nm. These comparisons clearly demonstrate that P2 is quite unique among the developed organic photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water because it showed the largest AQY with a value of 7.04% at 500 nm and still had 5.06% at 550 nm. Considering that lights with wavelengths around 500 nm are in the most energy dense region of the solar spectrum, P2 would be a suitable photocatalyst for harvesting more solar energy.
Mechanism study
It is intriguing to see that such a small difference in conjugation modification style brings largely different photocatalytic enhancement in P2 and P1. In order to understand the mechanisms behind, a series experiments and theoretical calculations have been carried out.
In heterogeneous catalysis, the particle size of catalysts is one of the important factors that affect catalytic performance. Generally, the smaller particle size is, the larger available catalytic surface and thus higher performance are. However, we found that P2 has a particle size in the range of 300–800 nm with an average value of 497 nm in the reaction media (Fig. S5†). But, the particle size of P1 is in the range of 200–600 nm with an average value of 382 nm, while that of P0 in the range of 100–500 nm with an average value of 272 nm. Obviously, the outstanding performance of P2 is not derived from this factor. It should be closely correlated with its chemical structure and inherent properties.
It was reported that the sulphonyl group in the polymers serves as an electron-output “tentacle” and its oxygen atoms are the key active sites for proton capture and reduction in photocatalysis.51 In order to learn the effect of different conjugation modifications in P1 and P2 on these functions, the Mulliken atomic charges of the basic repeating units in the three polymers were firstly DFT computed and the result is shown in Fig. 5a. In all cases, the O atoms of the sulphonyl group display the lowest negative Mulliken charge, indicating their strong ability in electron withdrawing and concentrating. However, the values of Mulliken atomic charge for a single O atom are −0.503e for P0, −0.504e for P1, and −0.503e for P2, which are not substantially different among the three polymers. This implies that different conjugation extensions in P1 and P2 do not influence the amount of concentrated negative charge. Furthermore, hydrogen-binding free energy (ΔGH) was theoretically calculated to compare the hydrogen absorption and catalytic potential of these oxygen sites of the sulphonyl groups in the three polymers. In the heterogeneous catalytic hydrogen production reaction, ΔGH of a specific site is a good indicator to identify whether it can serve as an active catalytic center and to assess its catalytic potential.51,62 An ideal catalytic site is required to absorb hydrogen neither too weakly nor too strongly and generally has a ΔGH value of 0 eV, because it should facilitate the protonation process and avoid a high barrier in H2 formation and release at the same time. In this study, we got the ΔGH values of single sulphonyl oxygen sites in P0, P1, and P2 of 1.732, 1.523 and 1.651 eV, respectively, all much larger than that of the metallic Pt site (ca. −0.1 eV).63 This is the reason why the addition of Pt nanoparticles as a cocatalyst can boost the photocatalytic performance of the polymers. When the comparison was carried out among the three polymers, it is easy to find that both P1 and P2 lower the ΔGH values as compared to P0 and the decreasing extent is larger in the case of P1. This verifies that the extended conjugation favours lowering of the hydrogen-binding free energy, and thus facilitates the photocatalytic hydrogen production reaction. But the side-chain-extended conjugation in P2 is less effective than the main-chain-extended in P1.

Excluding the factors of particle size, electron-concentrating ability and hydrogen-binding free energy of the surface sulphonyl group that account for the observed high performance in P2, the investigation turned to other processes in photocatalytic hydrogen production. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, in a photocatalytic nanoparticle, photons are mostly absorbed by the inner molecules and produce excitons inside the nanoparticle. After generation, excitons have two possible methods for photocatalysis. One is to migrate to the nanoparticle surface and use surface photocatalytic active sites directly. The another method is to dissociate either in situ or during migration, and the dissociated hole and electron carriers are required to transport to surface photocatalytic active sites. Otherwise, photon-generated excitons will be annihilated and wasted. During these processes, the exciton lifetime is one of the key factors that govern the process efficiencies. Herein, by means of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 6b), we found that P2 has an exciton lifetime of 7.14 ns, which is near nine times longer than that of P0 (0.73 ns). In comparison, P1 displays an exciton lifetime of 1.35 ns, less than one-fold increment as referred to that of P0. Clearly, the side-chain-extended conjugation in P2 is more effective than the main-chain extended conjugation in P1 in enhancing the exciton lifetime and thus ensuring more efficient exciton utilization.

(f) EIS Nyquist plots and (g) transient photocurrent responses to illumination on–off cycles of P0, P1, P2. 
Besides the exciton lifetime, carrier mobility is another vital factor in determining the efficiencies of the above processes. In this work, we used organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with these polymers as an active component to assess their carrier mobilities. As shown in Fig. 6c–e, only P2-based devices can work normally with a charge mobility of 7.32 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 while, those of P0 and P1 reported their charge mobilities to be 7.94 × 10−7 and 2.60 × 10−7 cm2 V −1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, P2 possesses the largest charge mobility among the family, which would facilitate the transport of excitons or charge carriers to the surface catalytic sites and then promote hydrogen production. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate electron transport across polymer films, which can positively correlate charge mobility in polymer nanoparticles and bulk materials. As shown in Fig. 6f, the radius of the first semicircle in the Nyquist plot decreased following the order of P0, P1, and P2. This illustrates that the extended conjugation along either side-chain or main-chain direction promotes charge transportation, while the former is more effective. This is further supported by transient photocurrent response measurements (Fig. 6g), in which P2 showed an almost 7-fold photocurrent as compared to P0. All these coincide with the aforementioned powder XRD observations, in which P2 exhibited a reinforced interchain π–π interactions and stacking. Undoubtedly, the greatly improved charge mobility and transport is one of the primary factors that endow P2 with greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Conclusions
In this work, the introduction of conjugated side chains is demonstrated here to be a promising approach for modulation and development of high performance photocatalytic linear conjugated polymers. The strategy produces a large two-dimensional π-conjugated structure, and thus has multi-aspect impacts on polymer basic properties and photocatalytic performance. In the exemplified case, it strengthens interchain π–π interactions, redshifts light-absorption bands, narrows the material bandgap, prolongs the exciton lifetime, modulates HOMO and LUMO energy levels to provide a larger hydrogen production overpotential and improves charge mobility and transport among polymer chains. These improvements work together and finally dramatically improve photocatalytic hydrogen production performance, affording the so-prepared P2 polymer as an outstanding visible light-driven hydrogen production photocatalyst with a HER of 20314 μmol g−1 h−1 and an AQY of 7.04% at 500 nm in the presence of 3 wt% Pt cocatalyst. Therefore, the work contributes a new structure design strategy for photocatalytic conjugated polymers for solar fuel production.
