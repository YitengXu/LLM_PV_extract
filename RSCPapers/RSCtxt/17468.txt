    , Accepted 9th July 2014First published on 18th July 2014AbstractAn excellent, platinum free fiber counter electrode (CE) was successfully fabricated, consisting of porous, single crystalline titanium nitride (TiN) nanoplates grown on carbon fibers (CF). The fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) based on the TiN–CF CE show a high conversion efficiency of 7.20%, comparable or even superior to that of the Pt wire (6.23%).
Fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) have recently attracted increasing attention as they show unique and promising advantages over the conventional planar structures. The FDSSCs are light-weight and can be easily woven into clothes or integrated into other structures, which enable applications in electronic textiles and various complex devices.1–14 The FDSSCs are generally made by twisting titania-based photoanodes coated on conductive wires with platinum (Pt) wires.2,15a,b However, Pt wires as CEs are not only expensive but also not the best choice due to low surface area of their smooth surface.16 Increasing the surface area of Pt and reducing the amount of Pt are useful for lowering the manufacturing cost of FDSSCs. A Pt–carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid fiber as a CE of a titania-based FDSSC was developed with a power conversion efficiency of 4.85%, comparable to that of the same type of fiber cell with a Pt wire electrode (4.23%).17 Recently, the FDSSC with a CE of the graphene–Pt composite fiber twisting titania nanotube on a Ti thread reached a record photo-conversion efficiency of 8.45% so far.18 However, the nanoscale Pt particles deposited onto the carbon surface often suffer from aggregation, erosion, and even loss with time to severely depress the FDSSC performance.19
For the purpose of further cost-cutting of the FDSSCs, novel high performance Pt-free CEs are of high demand. However, to date, there have been few attempts to make totally Pt-free fiber CEs. Although the inorganic metal compounds, such as nitrides, carbides, sulfides, and oxides of Ti,20,21 W,22,23 Co,24,25 and other metals,26 have exhibited good performance in conventional planar DSSCs, they have been less reported in FDSSCs still because there is a lack of effective techniques to coat both high electrocatalytic activity and conductivity inorganic metal compound films onto high-curvature surfaces of conductive fibers.27,28
In this communication, we report low-cost, Pt-free fiber-CE materials consisting of porous, single crystalline titanium nitride (TiN) nanoplates grown on carbon fibers (CF) through a simple two-step approach. We directly grew TiO2 nanoplates onto the CF (labeled as TiO2–CF), followed by complete transfer of them into TiN nanoplates (labeled as TiN–CF) using an ammonification process under high temperature. The FDSSC based on the TiN–CF CE shows high conversion efficiency of 7.20%, comparable or even superior to that of the Pt wire CE (6.23%). The noticeable photocurrent density reaches a record value as high as 19.35 mA cm−2 among all the developed FDSSCs hitherto. The excellent photoconversion performance can be attributed to multiple factors, not only to the intrinsic electrochemical properties and electrical conductivity of the TiN nanoplate, but also closely to their specific nanostructure. A TiN–CF-based solar cell model assembled with four 21 cm-long FDSSCs in parallel connection enables us to easily drive a small fan motor in outdoor sunlight. The present TiN–CF may be a promising alternative to the conventional Pt electrode in FDSSCs.
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images show that the intercrossing TiO2 square nanoplates with narrow size distribution were uniformly and densely grown on the CF substrates (see ESI,† Fig. S1). No other product morphologies were observed, demonstrating the high-yield growth of the TiO2 nanoplates (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†). The high-magnification FE-SEM image reveals the clear square contours and the smooth surface of the nanoplates with a side length of ∼2–3 μm and a thickness of ∼100 nm (Fig. S1c, ESI†). The TEM image further reveals that these nanoplates have regular square geometric shapes (Fig. S1d, ESI†). The HRTEM image collected at the edge of the TiO2 nanoplate shows a lattice fringe of 0.19 nm that is consistent with the d-spacing of the (200) or the (020) atomic plane of the anatase TiO2 structure (Fig. S1e, ESI†). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern along the [001] zone of a typical nanoplate demonstrates the clear diffraction spots with well alignment, indicative of the single crystal structure of the TiO2 nanoplates (Fig. S1f, ESI†).
The TiN nanoplates were achieved through self-templating transfer by nitriding TiO2 nanoplates in an ammonia atmosphere. The N atom replaced the O atom in situ and the Ti4+ ions were reduced to Ti3+ to form bound Ti–N.29 The FE-SEM image suggests that the resulting TiN inherits nanoplate-like macroscopic morphology from the TiO2 sintering, vertically standing on the CF (Fig. 1a and Fig. S2a–c, ESI†). In comparison with the mother TiO2 nanoplate, the surface of the TiN nanoplate becomes rough, and considerable numbers of pores were formed during the chemical transformation as shown in the inset in Fig. 1b, which can be explained by that the volume shrinks because of the change in density during the transformation from TiO2 (ρ = 3.90 g cm−3) to TiN (ρ = 5.40 g cm−3).30 The porous structure may improve the electrode surface area exposed to the electrolyte solution. In addition, the tight fusion of the contact parts of the neighboring TiN nanoplates during the high-temperature ammonification process would greatly reduce the hindrance for electron transfer among the nanoplate networks. The elemental mapping image revealed the exact composition of Ti and N (see ESI,† Fig. S2d and e). The TEM image clearly reveals that the embedded mesopores range from 20–50 nm in size and absolutely penetrate through the nanoplate (Fig. 2a and c). The diffraction dot pattern of SAED indicates the single crystalline nature of the TiN nanoplate (Fig. 2b). The HRTEM image clearly shows a fringe spacing of 0.21 nm, corresponding to the d-spacing of the (200) lattice plane of the cubic TiN structure (Fig. 2d). The TiN nanoplate was identified to be enclosed by {001} top and bottom surfaces.

The typical powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrate the corresponding phase transformation process. The XRD peaks of the TiO2 nanoplate can be indexed to the anatase phase (Fig. S3, ESI†). The broad peak centered at 25° corresponds to amorphous CF. After annealing at a temperature of 900 °C in an ammonia atmosphere for 1 h, all XRD peaks of the formed product can be indexed to the cubic TiN crystal structure (Fig. S3, ESI†). No peaks associated with TiO2 or other compounds were detected, indicating that TiO2 was completely transferred into the TiN product. The stronger intensity of the (200) diffraction peak of the TiN cubic phase relative to the standard JCPDF card demonstrates a preferential orientation of the plate in the {200} direction, consistent with the above HRTEM observation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis shows the N1s peak with a bond energy around 396 eV, which confirms the N substituting O atom in the crystal lattice and formation of the Ti–N bond (Fig. S4, ESI†).29
TiN possesses high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions owing to the similarity of the electronic structure of the metal nitrides to that of the noble metals.21,26,31 To evaluate the TiN–CF with traditional Pt wire electrodes, we fabricated FDSSC devices with TiN–CF, the Pt wire (100 μm diameter), and bare CF of similar cell configuration. Fig. S9 (ESI†) presents the photograph, FE-SEM images and the corresponding schematic illustration of the TiN–CF based FDSSC. A bundle of TiN nanoplate-functionalized CFs were twisted with the TiO2 nanotube array-coated Ti threads as photoanodes, which were inserted into a transparent capillary filled with an electrolyte to be assembled into a FDSSC. Fig. 3 shows that the FDSSCs with different CEs display distinct photocurrent density–voltage curves and energy conversion efficiencies. The FDSSC with the TiN–CF CE achieved the highest conversion efficiency of 7.20% while a similar photovoltaic device made with the Pt wire has a conversion efficiency of 6.23%.15 The cell efficiency of the TiN–CF is also much higher than the prevenient TiN nanocube on FTO glass of η = 6.23%26 and CNT-supported TiN nanoparticles (η = 5.41%) on FTO glass21 on the standard planar I3−/I− DSSC. It indicates that the porous, single crystalline TiN nanoplates have a superior electrocatalytic activity to facilitate the reaction of I3−/I− redox pairs, comparable or even superior to the Pt electrode. Due to the poor electrochemical catalyst of the applied CF, the FDSSC assembled with bare CF shows the lowest conversion efficiencies of 1.20%. It reveals that the catalytic active sites on the TiN–CF dominantly originate from the TiN nanoplate itself rather than the CF which mainly functions as an electron-transport network. Obviously, the TiN–CF shows many advantages in short-circuit current density owing to more interfacial active sites. The noticeable short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc = 19.35 mA cm−2) of the TiN–CF FDSSC is not only higher than that of the Pt electrode (Jsc = 12.70 mA cm−2), but also ranks as a record value among all the FDSSCs reported hitherto, based on the statistics in Table S1 (ESI†). The corresponding open-circuit voltage and fill factor (FF) are a little lower than those of the Pt electrode, possibly due to the intrinsic nature of the applied CF because the TiN–CF and bare CF-based cells show almost the same open-circuit voltage.32
 Fig. 3  
I–V curves of FDSSCs based on TiN–CF, Pt wire and bare CF as CEs. 
In order to understand the different efficiencies among the FDSSCs with various CEs in detail, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to investigate the catalytic activity of the TiN–CF, Pt wire, and bare CF electrodes (Fig. S6, ESI†). Two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks are predominantly observed for the TiN–CF and Pt wire electrodes, whereas none for the bare CF electrode. The result indicates that both TiN and Pt have good electrocatalytic activity for the I3−/I− system, and slower reduction reaction on the bare CF, consistent with the data of the I–V test. Compared to the Pt electrode, while the anodic oxidation peak for the TiN–CF electrode is kept unchanged in potential, the reverse cathode reduction peak potential is also close to that of the Pt electrode. It indicates that the TiN nanoplate possesses comparable electrocatalytic capacity with the Pt electrode of the redox reaction iodide species. Meanwhile, the current density of both the oxidation and reduction for the TiN–CF electrode was higher than that of Pt, which may be attributed to a larger catalytic active surface of the TiN–CF.21 It may also be the reason that the FDSSC with TiN–CF could achieve high Jsc.
To further elucidate the higher catalytic activity of TiN–CF than the Pt wire in FDSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out by using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE/electrolyte/CE) under dark conditions. The TiN–CF, Pt wire, and bare CF electrodes all show two semicircles (Fig. S7, ESI†). The fitting values of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE/electrolyte interface corresponding to the TiN–CF, Pt wire and, CF electrodes are 9.2, 20.2, and 478.8 Ω, respectively. It indicates that the TiN–CF CE would facilitate the reduction of the oxidized iodide species, then give rise to a small charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte–CE interface, and finally result in high energy conversion efficiency. The Nernstian diffusion impedance (ZN) of the TiN–CF is 58.1 Ω, much lower than that of the Pt wire (125.1 Ω). It means that the diffusion coefficients of triiodide increase with increasing electrocatalytic activity of the CE,25 as triiodide ions can be rapidly reduced to iodide ions under catalysis of TiN nanoplates to accelerate diffusion of triiodide ions. As a result, the smaller Rct and ZN of the TiN–CF give the explanation that the TiN–CF has superior catalytic activity upon the reduction of I3− ions to the Pt wire.26 The relatively lower FF of the TiN–CF than Pt may be attributed to the larger ohmic resistance (Rs, corresponding to onset of the first semicircle) due to the CF substrate. In addition, the corresponding Tafel polarization curves are listed in Fig. S8 (ESI†).
The good photovoltaic performance of the TiN–CF can be attributed not only to the intrinsic electrochemical properties and electrical conductivity of the TiN nanoplate, but also closely to its specific nanostructures: (1) the single crystallinity and minimal number of defects allow good electrocatalytic activity of the TiN nanoplate; (2) the mesopores on the TiN nanoplate endow the TiN with more active sites. The large macropores generated through the intercrossing of the nanoplates provide an easy transport tunnel for I3−/I− diffusion throughout the TiN layer; (3) tight fusion connectivity among the nanoplates caused by the high temperature sintering favors the longer distance electron transport with less diffusive hindrance, and is obviously more facile than within a random network of the nanoparticles,21 where the electrons have to cross many tiny particle boundaries, and those boundaries trap electrons and thus decelerate the electron transport; (4) the vertically aligned configuration of the nanoplate on the CF also increases electron transport, which can provide direct electrical pathways from the CF to the nanoplate, and subsequently to the electrode/electrolyte interface. To prove the practical usefulness of low-cost FDSSCs with inexpensive TiN–CF substituting the expensive Pt wire as CEs, four 21 cm-long FDSSCs in parallel connection were assembled into a solar cell module, which enables us to easily drive a small fan motor in outdoor sunlight (see Fig. S10 and Movie S1, ESI†). The electric fan remains running while the cell is under continuous illumination.
In summary, the porous, single crystalline TiN nanoplates grown on the CF were successfully fabricated through sintering the TiO2 nanoplates in an ammonia atmosphere. The TiN–CF CE exhibits excellent electrochemical catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide in DSSCs. This work has tremendous implications that substitution of a low-cost, easily handled TiN–CF CE material with good performance for the precious metal Pt will foster the development of FDSSCs and reduce the cost for energy conversion.
