    , Accepted 10th January 2012First published on 10th January 2012AbstractPorous copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) thin film was prepared via a solvothermal approach. Compared with conventional dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), double junction photoelectrochemical cells using dye-sensitized n-type TiO2 (DS-TiO2) as the photoanode and porous p-type CZTS film as the photocathode shows an increased short circuit current, external quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiency.
Photoelectrochemical cells, especially dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), are believed to be one of the most promising cost-effective alternatives to conventional solar cells.1–4 Traditional DSSCs are single junction solar cells, which are fabricated with a dye-sensitized n-type semiconductor photoanode (n-DSSC)1,2 or a dye-sensitized p-type semiconductor photocathode (p-DSSC)5 and a counter electrode. Recently, p-DSSCs and n-DSSCs have been combined to fabricate double junction solar cells (pn-DSSCs)6 with a theoretical efficiency limitation well beyond that of single junction DSSCs.7 n-DSSC using dye-sensitized n-type TiO2 (DS-TiO2) as the photoanode has a considerable conversion efficiency.4 However, it is a great challenge choosing a suitable dye and p-type semiconductor for the photocathode.6 Nanostructured p-type semiconductor thin films with narrow band gaps might meet the demand of the photocathode for double junction solar cells.8 Traditional p-type semiconductors, such as CdTe and CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS), however, are not amenable for eventual production due to the scarcity and cost of Te, In, and Ga. Composed of earth-abundant elements, copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) has recently become a focus of attention in the photovoltaic field.9 Actually, this p-type10 semiconductor exhibits a large absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and a suitable direct band gap (Eg = 1.4–1.5 eV)11 which could match the range of solar irradiation.
In our recent work, we convert the traditional DSSCs to double junction photoelectrochemical cells using porous CZTS thin films. Firstly, we successfully synthesized porous CZTS thin films on flexible Mo foils via a facile template-free solvothermal approach. Composed of interconnected CZTS nanocrystallites with a diameter of 20–40 nm, the film exhibits high surface area and porosity compared with traditional CZTS film. As a result, it shows quite low reflectivity in the full spectrum at a range of 400–1600 nm, indicating effective light trapping. Then we fabricated photoelectrochemical cells with double junctions using the porous CZTS thin film: dye-sensitized n-type TiO2 (DS-TiO2) as the photoanode and porous CZTS film as the photocathode. The solar cell shows increased short circuit current (22%) and conversion efficiency (7%) compared with solar cells using traditional Pt counter electrodes. External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cells prove that the porous CZTS act as a light absorber as well as a counter electrode. This study successfully provides a new photocathode for low-cost and high-efficiency double junction photoelectrochemical cells.
Porous CZTS thin films on flexible Mo foils were prepared via a solvothermal approach without the assistance of organic ligands. Copper, zinc and tin precursors and thiourea dissolved in ethanol were added to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Mo foil was put into the autoclave aslant, followed by heating at 200 °C for 6 h. After cleaning with ethanol several times, the film was annealed at 500 °C for 0.5 h in sulfur vapour (see Experimental section, ESI†). The phase and purity of the products were determined by XRD. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S1†) correspond to CZTS of the kesterite structure (JCPDS 26-0575) and Mo (JCPDS 42-1120). The lack of characteristic peaks in Fig. S1b† might be attributed to the superfluous sulfur while being annealed. The morphologies of as-prepared porous CZTS thin films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1 shows the top view of the porous CZTS thin films with different magnifications. The porous structure could be seen easily from the image. As is shown in Fig. 1d, the porous film is constituted of interconnected CZTS nanocrystallites, diameters of which range from 20 nm to 40 nm. The porous CZTS film is not quite planar, and the thickness of the film is approximately 3 μm, as is shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 2a shows the room temperature UV-Vis reflectivity spectrum for the Mo substrate and the as-prepared CZTS film. When spectra range from 400 to 1600 nm, the Mo substrate's reflectivity is higher than 50% above 450 nm, while reflectivity of the porous CZTS film is always below 3%, as expected for a strong light-trapping effect.

Porous TiO2 photoanode, N719 dye, I−/I3− electrolyte and Pt serosity are bought from WuHan Geao Instruments Science & Technology Co., Ltd. The optical properties of the DS-TiO2 photoanode are shown in Fig. 2b. A decreased absorptivity appeared around 600 nm. Excluding the reflectivity, there are also many photons transmitting through the DS-TiO2 photoanode, which might be absorbed by a photocathode to form a double junction solar cell. A single junction DSSC (DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell) was assembled using the bought materials (see Experimental section, ESI†). The double junction solar cell (DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell) was constructed by replacing the Pt-coated FTO with the porous CZTS film using the same DS-TiO2 photoanode.
The current–voltage characteristics of the DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell and the DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell are shown in Fig. 3. The parameters of DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell are as follows: short circuit current (JSC) of 2.47 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.695 V, fill factor (FF) of 67.0, and power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.15%. Replacing the Pt-coated FTO with the porous CZTS film, a DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell was constructed and the parameters of the cell changed significantly (Fig. 3). The JSC increased significantly from 2.47 mA cm−2 to 3.03 mA cm−2 (22% increase), and the FF also improved from 67% to 68.8%. However, the VOC dropped from 0.695 V to 0.590 V. In summary, the power conversion efficiency increased from 1.15% to 1.23% (7% increase).

Fig. 4 shows the scheme of the DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell. The possible electron transfer and recombination process in the different components are also shown. As to the DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell (Fig. S3†), open circuit voltage (∼0.7 V) is determined by the Fermi energy around the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (ECB: −0.5 V vs.NHE), and the oxidation reduction potential of I−/I3− (0.33 V vs.NHE).4,12 However, VOC of the DS-TiO2/CZTS cell (Fig. 4) is determined by the quasi-Fermi levels above the valence band (VB) of CZTS and below the CB of TiO2.3 The energy level of the VB of CZTS has not been reported yet. But, VB of p-type semiconductors roughly correspond to the flat band potential (Efb) obtained from the current–voltage curve of the photocurrent response.13Efb of our prepared CZTS thin film is roughly 0.3 V vs.NHE in 3-methoxypropionitrile (Fig. S5†). Thus, VB of CZTS is roughly 0.3 V vs.NHE. Considering the difference between Fermi level and VB, the quasi-Fermi level is lower than the oxidation reduction potential of I−/I3−. Therefore, the VOC of the DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell is lower than that of the DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell, which is due to the decrease of VOC from 0.695 V to 0.590 V.
 Fig. 4  Scheme for the DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell. Schematic diagram of possible electron transfer and recombination is also shown. The green arrows indicate the possible electron transfer and the dashed yellow arrows show the possible electron recombination. The thick green arrows are the most possible electron transfer route of a double junction photoelectrochemical solar cell. 
The decrease of the VOC might be attributed to the energy levels of the quasi-Fermi level of CZTS, which might be between CB of TiO2 and oxidation reduction potential of I−/I3−. Oxidation reduction potential should be lower than the Fermi levels of p-type semiconductors in a photoelectrochemical cells.14 Thus, as seen from the current–voltage characteristics and the electron transfer process, I−/I3− electrolyte is inapposite for this double junction solar cell. Further attempts on suitable electrolytes are continuing. The possible electron recombination is also shown in the Fig. 4, which leads to lower values of the current–voltage behaviour.

Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the solar cells. The EQE of the DSSC dropped quickly above 550 nm, and has an onset wavelength of about 700 nm, corresponding well to the absorptivity of the DS-TiO2 photoanode. The EQE of the DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell, however, is incongruent with the absorptivity of the DS-TiO2 photoanode. The quick drop started at 620 nm and the tail of the curve extended up to 800 nm, which is consistent with the band gap of CZTS (about 1.5 eV), indicating that the cell acts as a double junction solar cell. The DS-TiO2/CZTS solar cell also has a higher EQE than the DS-TiO2/Pt solar cell using the same DS-TiO2 photoanode from 300 nm to 500 nm, indicating that CZTS act as a more efficient counter electrode than our prepared Pt counter electrode. Seen from the EQEs, porous CZTS thin film did absorb the waste photons and contributed to the photocurrent. These two increases result in the 22% increase in JSC. To further elucidate the electrochemical characteristics of the solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. S6.† According to the reported equivalent circuit,15 the high-frequency (corresponding to low Z′) intercept on the Z′ axis represents the series resistance (RS) of the metallic substrate e.g. FTO or Mo foil. RS of the DS-TiO2/CZTS cell (9.56 Ω cm2) was lower than that of the DS-TiO2/Pt cell (16.75 Ω cm2). The semicircle in the high-frequency range results from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct-pt) and the corresponding constant phase-angle element (CPE) at the electrolyte/photocathode interface. Rct-pt of the electrolyte/CZTS interface (18 Ω cm2) is higher than that of the electrolyte/Pt interface (11.41 Ω cm2), suggesting the charge transfer process at the electrolyte/photocathode interface needs further improvement.

In summary, we report a simple and cost-effective technique for fabricating porous CZTS thin film. This is a new p-type porous film of great promise with environment-friendly and earth-abundant elemental composition and a narrow band gap. The porous CZTS film shows quite low reflectivity in the full spectrum, which indicates effective light trapping caused by the mesoporous structure. A novel double junction solar cell was also constructed with dye-sensitized porous TiO2 films as the photoanode and porous CZTS films as the photocathode. Judging from the EQE, porous CZTS is an efficient counter electrode as well as a good light absorber. Finally, the double junction solar cell has an enhanced short circuit current (22%) and increased efficiency (7%) compared with traditional DSSCs using Pt as the counter electrode. The porous CZTS thin film shows the potential to convert conventional DSSCs into more efficient double junction ones with minor changes, namely by the replacement of the Pt-coated counter electrode with porous CZTS thin film. This work gives a cost-effective technology to high-efficiency photoelectrochemical solar cells.
