This study paves the way for utilization of more molecules from corannulene families in perovskite research.
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials have gained huge attention in next generation photovoltaic research, primarily due to their remarkable photovoltaic performance and low cost large area fabrication potential.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has increased more than six-fold since the initial report of a perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a humble PCE of 3.9% in 2009.3,4 The major development of PSCs in the last decade was attributed to understanding the chemistry of perovskite layer formation, defect engineering and transport layer modifications.5–8 Despite great achievements in device efficiency, moisture-induced degradation still remains a road-block to the wide application of PSCs.9 Several types of organic molecules have been used to increase the hydrophobicity of the perovskite layer. For instances, hydrophobic molecules such as functionalized aliphatic compounds, fullerenes, and ionic liquids have been reported to increase the moisture-resistance of PSCs when used as additives in perovskite precursor solution.10–12 Separately, hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(acrylic acid) were found to maintain device stability despite their water-absorbing nature.13,14 However, the beneficial effect of amphiphilic organic molecules has been scarcely discussed. Herein, novel amphiphilic corannulene-pentakis-(triethyleneglycol-monomethyl ether)-sulfone (Cor-TEG) (Fig. 1a) is utilized to explore the mutual effect of both hydrophobic corannulene and hydrophilic side chains (ethylene glycol oligomers) in increasing the moisture resistance of PSCs. It is found that the Cor-TEG additive modulated the perovskite crystal growth to form large and columnar grains with reduced defects and enhanced photocarrier extraction. Notably, the highest PCE of 17.0% has been attained in a Cor-TEG modified perovskite device with improved stability under both inert (91% of initial PCE for 65 days) and humid conditions (87% of initial PCE for two weeks).
Corannulene is a non-planar π-system which can be synthesized at kilogram-scale.15 It can also be functionalized in a controlled manner to modulate the electronic properties of the core carbon scaffold.16 The synthesis of Cor-TEG was carried out by the oxidation of the previously reported corannulene-penta(TEG)-sulfide.17 The electron-withdrawing capability of the resulting corannulene compound is significantly enhanced by the addition of five sulfonyls known to be strong electron withdrawing functional groups.18 In this study, Cor-TEG was added into perovskite precursor solution and stirred for at least one hour.

(b) Device schematic of the planar PSC used in this study, (c) J–V scan of the pristine and Cor-TEG treated devices, and (d) stabilized power output tracking under one-sun illumination measured at 0.84 V and 0.87 for the pristine and Cor-TEG treated devices, respectively. 
The role of Cor-TEG additive was studied in planar perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices. The device architecture of planar PSCs is depicted in Fig. 1b. The current density–voltage (J–V) characterizations measured under simulated AM 1.5 radiation of our best cells with and without the Cor-TEG additive in the perovskite light absorbers are shown in Fig. 1c. The average device parameters are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). A high PCE of 17% can be achieved for the Cor-TEG treated device. Notably, higher fill factor was observed as a predominant factor in the overall increase of device performance. Fig. 1d presents the stabilized power output (SPO) obtained using maximum power point tracking, where the Cor-TEG treated device could still maintain the device efficiency above 16% after 3000 seconds (see Fig. S1, ESI†) while the pristine one partially degraded, in which the power output was reduced from 15.4% to 14.1%.
Cor-TEG has 25 oxygen atoms including those of 5 sulfone (OSO) functional groups on each molecule as the side chains, which act as Lewis bases that coordinate to Lewis acidic Pb(II) in the perovskite precursor solution, thus slowing down the crystallization process.19 Interaction between the Lewis base sites of Cor-TEG with Pb(II) was confirmed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Several peak shifts to lower wavenumbers were observed, implying efficient coordination with Pb(II).20,21 For instance, the SO stretching peak of sulfone and C–O stretching peak of triethyleneglycol (TEG) were red-shifted from 1128 to 1104 cm−1 and 1025 to 1019 cm−1, respectively (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been utilized to investigate the morphologies of the perovskite films with different amounts of Cor-TEG (Fig. 2a–d). The grain size of the pristine perovskite was observed to be around 281 nm. Upon addition of Cor-TEG at 4, 10, and 30 μg mL−1, the size of the perovskite grains increased to 316, 358, and 399 nm, respectively (see also Fig. S3, ESI†). More compact and smoother perovskite surfaces are also observed which was further confirmed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), where the surface roughness analysis exhibited a reduced root-mean square (RMS) roughness from 22.0 nm to 18.7 nm upon Cor-TEG addition (Fig. S4, ESI†). The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 2e–h) agree with the larger grain size and clearly illustrate more uniform and columnar perovskite films. This controlled growth of perovskite crystallites is attributed to the role of Lewis bases in the ripening process of perovskite film growth.22
 Fig. 2  Top-view SEM images of the perovskite films (a–d) and cross-sectional SEM images of the pristine and Cor-TEG treated devices (e–h), showing a trend of larger and more columnar grains of perovskite active layer over increasing amounts of Cor-TEG. Statistical presentation of the grain sizes is presented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Scale bars are 500 nm. 
Moreover, more columnar-like grains significantly reduce the amount of grain boundaries that are susceptible to degradation reaction in the presence of moisture, which later contribute to the stability of the resulting device under ambient conditions.23,24 However, the x-ray diffraction spectra do not show significant differences in the peak positions and intensities (Fig. S5, ESI†). We postulate that this is likely due to the hydrophilic nature of the underlying UV-ozone treated SnO2 layer that induces a large number of nucleation sites at the initial stage of perovskite formation. Overall, increasing the amount of Cor-TEG leads to beneficial perovskite grain growth and morphology.
The photophysical properties of the obtained pristine and modified perovskite films are analyzed using photoluminescence (PL) profiles. Fig. 3a shows the higher intensity of steady-state PL for the modified perovskite film and thus correlates well with the improved perovskite film quality. The effect of Cor-TEG addition was further probed using time-resolved PL decay measurement (Fig. 3b). The PL decay curves were fitted by bi-exponential decay function to extract the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) characteristic decay times. The τ1 and τ2 are attributed to the non-radiative and radiative recombinations of the excited charge carrier, respectively. The higher value of the time constants (slower decay) for Cor-TEG treated perovskite films as compared to that of pristine film indicates suppressed amounts of defects and non-radiative recombination, which can be further attributed to reduced grain boundaries in the perovskite films.25 The PL lifetime (τave) (see Table S2, ESI†) has been evaluated from the amplitude weighted average of the two characteristic lifetimes. The addition of Cor-TEG significantly prolongs the PL τave from 157 ns to 454 ns.
 Fig. 3  (a and b) Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) profiles of pristine and Cor-TEG treated perovskite films on a glass substrate, (c) light intensity-dependent open-circuit voltage measurement and (d) photo-current decay profile of complete devices for pristine and Cor-TEG treated films. 

Fig. 3c depicts the light intensity dependence of open-circuit voltage (Voc) for the devices. It has been shown that the recombination mode is related to the ideality factor (n) of the device and is extracted using the slope of nkT/q in the semi-logarithmic plot of Vocversus light intensity (where q is the elementary charge, T is temperature in Kelvin, and k is Boltzmann constant). When n = 1, the dominant loss mechanism is band-to-band recombination, while n = 2 refers to trap-assisted recombination.26 Under light irradiance in the range of 10 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2 (1-sun), the Cor-TEG modified devices exhibit lower ideality factor than that of the pristine ones, i.e. 1.58 and 1.97, respectively. This indicates reduced defect states from perovskite films upon utilization of Cor-TEG as the additive, which correlates well with the larger grain size and reduced grain boundaries as observed in the SEM images. The reduced defect states were also reflected in the smaller hysteresis between the reverse and forward scans of the J–V curve (Fig. S6, ESI†). Moreover, the smoother perovskite surface as seen in AFM images (Fig. S4, ESI†) could result in a more conformal packing of the hole-transport layer (HTL) on top of the perovskite layer, giving rise to the improved interface. The electron withdrawing nature of sulfone-functionalized corannulene could also play an important role in bridging inter-grain charge transport, facilitating the photocurrent extraction as shown in Fig. 3d. The charge carrier property was analyzed by probing the photocurrent decay after perturbation with a small increase in light intensity. This method elucidates the kinetics of carrier extraction upon light illumination. A faster decay was observed on the Cor-TEG treated device (17.0 μs) than the pristine one (21.2 μs). This finding is in good agreement with the hypothesized role of Cor-TEG at bridging intra-grain transport utilizing the electron withdrawing nature of the electron-poor polyaromatic core.
The stability test of the devices has been completed for a period of 65 days and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. The devices are stored in an argon-filled glovebox. As compared to the pristine device that could only retain 61% of its initial PCE, the Cor-TEG modified PSC can hold ∼91% of its initial PCE. The ambient stability of the obtained PSCs was also tracked over the course of 2 weeks. These devices were not encapsulated but exposed to ambient atmosphere with a measured relative humidity of 70%. The Cor-TEG treated devices demonstrated excellent stability and retained 87% of their initial efficiency in such a harsh environment (Fig. 4b). The major factors of performance decrease over time appeared to be due to the degraded perovskite active layer and deteriorated interface as seen in lower Jsc and FF, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). We next compared the moisture stability of the pristine and Cor-TEG modifed perovskite films after aging through X-ray diffraction spectra (Fig. 4c and d). There are two peaks clearly indicating the severe degradation in the pristine films. First, the peak at 12.7° is known to hint at the relative amount of lead iodide, the by-product of the perovskite degradation reaction. Second, the peak at lower angle ca. 11.3° could be attributed to perovskite monohydrate species23 with respect to the moisture-induced degradation mechanism predominant when a perovskite film is exposed in high humidity atmosphere. The quantification of the relative intensities from the respective peaks indicates that in the pristine sample, after storing for 8 days in a controlled chamber with 50% RH, 73% perovskite had degraded, referring to strong perovskite monohydrate and PbI2 peaks at 11.3° and 12.7°, respectively. Remarkably, only a minute intensity is observed at 11.3° for the Cor-TEG modified perovskite films, which strongly suggests that moisture adsorption and ingress could be inhibited by the presence of Cor-TEG molecules at the periphery of the crystal grains. Moreover, the presence of Cor-TEG on the perovskite surface was confirmed using water droplet contact angle measurement, where the Cor-TEG treated perovskite film exhibits a slightly higher angle (Fig. S8, ESI†), which also supports the role of Cor-TEG in protecting the underlying perovskite layer from the surface. The protection from moisture-induced degradation found in this study was in accordance with the previous reports whereby long chains of poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized additive were used in both the perovskite precursor27 and anti-solvent mixture.28 Here, the ambient stability is thus attributed to the TEG chains present in the Cor-TEG molecule. Counter-intuitively, the TEG chains known for hygroscopicity could prevent degradation by passivating uncoordinated Pb ions on the perovskite surface and by slowing down the perovskite hydration process by containing the water molecules before reaching the perovskite layer.20

In summary, we have shown that the Cor-TEG molecular additive serves to improve the perovskite film morphology and enhance the interfacial quality as shown by a higher fill factor of 81% and an overall decent efficiency of 17%. Moreover, the improved charge extraction, as shown in photocurrent decay curves, was attributed to the electron withdrawing nature of the corannulene sulfone. The enhanced moisture resistance was attributed to the protective role of TEG chains. Overall, the benefits of corannulene and TEG chains were combined and proved to be favorable in both device performance and stability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first study of the use of the corannulene family in perovskite solar cell research to improve device efficiency and moisture resistance. The methodology in this work is simple and only requires a very minute amount of additive, allowing utilization in large area perovskite solar panel fabrication.
