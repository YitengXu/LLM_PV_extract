To achieve the HTNT arrays, smooth TiO2 nanotube (STNT) arrays are fabricated by a two-step anodization process followed by hydrothermal treatment in the presence of the aqueous solution of NH4F. Both STNT and HTNT arrays can serve as photoanodes in the flexible fiber-type DSSCs. We demonstrate that the conversion efficiency of the HTNT array-based flexible fiber-type DSSC (8.6%), which has increased by more than 30% compared with that of the STNT array-based flexible fiber-type DSSC. Moreover, the conversion efficiency is highly stable, even when the flexible fiber-type DSSC is subjected to extreme mechanical deformation, such as 180° bending. This promising conversion efficiency may originate from the significant dye loading capability of the photoanode, which has an enormous surface area benefited from the hierarchical nanostructures.
1. Introduction
In the last two decades, there have been several crucial advances in the development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). One of the attractive achievements in the fabrication of DSSCs is the application of three-dimensional (3D) network composed of nanoscale semiconductor colloids with nanoporous structures.1–3 However, the disordered 3D network results in numerous grain boundaries, which may reduce electron mobility and hinder the transport of excited electrons, thus damping the increase of conversion efficiency.4,5 Highly crystallized one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, such as nanotubes, nanowires, and nanorods, have gained considerable research attention because they intrinsically have low grain boundaries. Possible improvement in the transportation of photogenerated carriers are highly expected for these 1D nanostructures due to their efficient transportation channels and less charge recombination at grain boundaries.6–8 However, to date, this hypothetical advantage has not been fully materialized yet. One possible reason is that the specific surface area of these 1D nanostructures is generally smaller than those of nanoparticle frameworks, which may result in the attachment of less dye molecules. A promising strategy for tackling this limitation is to grow hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures, in which the specific area can be largely promoted in comparison with nanotube or nanorod arrays.
Recently, some attempts to make hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures possessing large specific surface area have been reported. A multitude of nanostructures, such as ZnO/TiO2 “nanoforests”, ZnO “caterpillar-like” structure and hierarchical TiO2 nanowire structures, have been synthesized on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, which served as photoanodes for DSSCs.9–19 All of the above nanostructures exhibited high conversion efficiencies. Because the stiffness of FTO deprives the flexibility of the DSSCs, flexible substrates attract considerable interests for academic research. For example, many efforts have been recently devoted to fabricate hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures on Ti foil.20–23 These new designs endow DSSC with the expected flexibility, but the opaque characteristic of Ti foil limits the DSSC from back-side illumination, which leads to the incident light loss through redox electrolytes compared with the front-side illumination.24 Simultaneously, some researchers have attempted the use of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/indium tin oxide (ITO) as the substrate to achieve the flexibility.25,26 Though the PET/ITO substrate displays good flexibility, it has its own limitation of incapability to withstand temperatures higher than 150 °C. To obtain well-crystallized anatase TiO2, the annealing temperature should reach around 450 °C, at which PET/ITO substrate will be destroyed. The flexible fiber-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on metal microwires can fulfill the needs and expectations of new DSSCs.27–43 To the best of our knowledge, the researchers have produced these types of cells using some nanomaterials and nanostructures, namely, ZnO nanowires, TiO2 nanoparticles, TiO2 nanotubes/nanowires. To date, the realized conversion efficiency is still not encouraging, which may be due to the numerous grain boundaries of nanoparticles and low specific surface area of nanotubes/nanowires. The synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 nanostructures on Ti microwires for flexible fiber-type DSSCs is still an urgent need.
Herein, highly ordered hierarchical TiO2 nanotube (HTNT) arrays are synthesized using a facile and low-cost method. To obtain HTNT arrays, smooth TiO2 nanotube (STNT) arrays are first fabricated via two-step anodization of Ti microwires, and then the Ti microwires covered with the STNT arrays are post-processed in NH4F aqueous solutions. The obtained HTNT arrays consist of a multitude of nanoparticles. Both the STNT and HTNT arrays are used as the photoanodes in the flexible fiber-type DSSCs. The results show that the conversion efficiency of the HTNT array based flexible fiber-type DSSC (8.6%) is higher than that of the STNT array based flexible fiber-type DSSC (6.4%). To our knowledge, it is the most highly efficient flexible fiber-type DSSC so far. In addition to the attractive conversion efficiency, the flexible fiber-type DSSCs possess stable performance even under extreme mechanical deformation, such as 180° bending.
2. Results and discussions
Similar to the previous works in our laboratory, a smooth TiO2 nanotube (STNT) array with a good alignment was obtained by a modified two-step anodization process.44,45Fig. 1a shows a typical top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of an STNT array, which possesses both a uniform alignment and clean surface. Fig. 1b shows the side-view SEM image of the STNT array: the STNT array features a smooth wall with a low surface area. The diameter of the Ti microwire covered with the STNT array is about 260 μm, as shown in Fig. S1a.† To obtain the hierarchical TiO2 nanotube (HTNT) array, the STNT array was immersed into the NH4F aqueous solution by a hydrothermal method at 200 °C for 10 h (see Experimental Methods). Fig. 1c and d show the typical SEM images of an HTNT array. The HTNT surface is composed of numerous fine nanoparticles, which indicates that the HTNT array holds a higher surface area. Fig. S1b† exhibits that the diameter of the Ti microwire covered with the HTNT array remains about 260 μm. Quite intriguingly, the alignment and integrity of the nanotube array is retained during the hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C, which can provide a continuous pathway for photogenerated electrons to transport over a long distance.

To investigate the formation mechanism of the HTNT array, another two control experiments were carried out by altering the reaction time of STNT array in the aqueous solution of NH4F. Therefore, the STNT arrays were immersed into the aqueous solution of NH4F and heated at 200 °C for 5 h and 15 h, respectively. The corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. S2.† After the reaction of STNT array in NH4F solution for 5 h, the top end of the HTNT array converts into numerous nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. S2a.† Fig. S2b† shows the side-view SEM image of the HTNT array obtained from NH4F aqueous solution for 5 h, which indicates that some nanoparticles appear on the side-wall of the HTNT array, and the reaction time should be increased if more nanoparticles are desired on the side wall. However, as shown in Fig. S2c and d,† when the reaction period is extended to 15 h, though entire HTNT array still consists of the nanoparticles, the alignment and integrity of the nanotube array are severely destroyed. The fewer nanoparticles, leading to a lower surface area, and the destroyed nanotube array, result in a shorter pathway of photogenerated electrons to transport, which is unbeneficial for their applications in flexible fiber-type DSSCs. Therefore, in the subsequent part of this study, we will focus on the HTNT array obtained in 10-hour-long reaction in NH4F aqueous solution at 200 °C.
To better understand the morphology and crystal structure of the STNT and HTNT arrays, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis were performed, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the TEM image of a selected STNT array with a diameter of ∼150 nm, having a smooth surface. This value is in accordance with the results shown in Fig. 1a and b. Fig. 2b shows an HRTEM image of the STNT array. The corresponding lattice distance along the (103) plane is 0.246 nm, which is in very good agreement with the interplanar spacing of the (103) anatase TiO2 crystal planes (JCPDS card: 21-1272). Fig. 2c and d present the representative TEM and HRTEM images of an HTNT array fabricated in 10-hour-long reactions in NH4F aqueous solution at 200 °C. Fig. 2c reveals that the HTNT array is composed of numerous small TiO2 nanoparticles, which significantly increase its surface area. Fig. 2d shows an HRTEM image of some TiO2 nanoparticles of the HTNT array. The lattice distance along the (101) plane is 0.35 nm, suggesting that the HTNT array is well-crystallized.

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of the STNT and HTNT arrays. The spectra were dominated by the photoelectron lines of Ti and O elements. The C 1s line, which was generally believed to have occurred from the adventitious carbon because of its exposure to the atmosphere, was also found in the spectra of all the samples and used as the standard for data calibration. With the energy of the C 1s line set at 284.6 eV, the energies of the Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 lines were determined after calibration. These data were in accordance with our previous work.44 Therefore, the XPS results confirmed that the chemical composition of the two samples was TiO2.

The crystal structures of the STNT and HTNT arrays were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as shown in Fig. 3b. All the diffraction peaks of the STNT and HTNT arrays can be indexed to anatase (JCPDS card: 21-1272) and no other impurities can be found from their XRD patterns, which is in good agreement with the HRTEM results, as shown in Fig. 2b and d.
Subsequently, both the STNT and HTNT arrays were finally assembled into flexible fiber-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs, Fig. 4), and their current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured. The photovoltaic performance was characterized by the four most important parameters, which are the short-circuit density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and the conversion efficiency (η).

Fig. 4a shows a digital image of a flexible fiber-type DSSC in a straight form. The working and counter electrodes are extracted from each end of the flexible fiber-type DSSC, respectively. Fig. 4b and Fig. S3† show the digital images of a flexible fiber-type DSSC in the spring shape with different thread pitches and in the bending state, which demonstrates that it possesses better flexibility than devices described in the previous studies.27–31 To fully recognize the flexible fiber-type DSSC, a schematic of its cross-sectional structure is also depicted in Fig. 4c. The working electrode, on which N719 were attached, was a Ti microwire covered with STNT (or HTNT) array. The Ti microwire as working electrode and the counter electrode, a Pt microwire, were inserted into a flexible plastic capillary tube filled with I−/I3− based liquid electrolyte.

Fig. 5a shows the J–V characteristics of the flexible fiber-type DSSCs based on STNT and HTNT arrays. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 1. For each case, more than three electrodes were tested and their photovoltaic performance was highly consistent, as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1.† A hump was found in all the I–V curves, which may result from the sealing glue (main component: ethyl cyanoacrylate) or the local shunt current. As shown in Table 1, the HTNT array-based flexible fiber-type DSSC exhibited a higher η of 8.6% than that of the STNT based flexible fiber-type DSSC (6.4%) with the VOC of 0.673 V, JSC of 15.9 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.80, and VOC of 0.713 V, JSC of 12.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.71, respectively. The higher JSC for the HTNT array based flexible fiber-type DSSC was attributed to the higher dye adsorption on the HTNT array over the STNT array. To determine the amount of dye for the STNT and HTNT arrays, the measurement of adsorption–desorption, which has also been employed in the previous literature, was performed.46–48 In particular, the two dye-sensitized photoanodes with the same effective length (1 cm) were soaked in a 4 mL mixed NaOH solution containing water and ethanol and their absorbance spectra were measured (as shown in Fig. 5b). The higher absorbance of HTNT array as compared to that of STNT array indicates that the rough wall made up of a multitude of nanoparticles (Fig. 1) has stronger dye loading capability than a smooth wall.

To further understand the charge transfer properties related to the interfacial regions within the flexible fiber-type DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the flexible fiber-type DSSCs, constructed from STNT and HTNT arrays, were performed. Fig. 5c shows the Nyquist plots of the two flexible fiber-type DSSCs at their VOCs in the dark conduction. Typically, the large semicircles in the low frequency region correspond to the charge transfer at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. To obtain the recombination resistance (R2) and electron lifetime (τr), the two Nyquist plots were fitted by Z-view software using an equivalent circuit (the inset in Fig. 5c) and the corresponding parameters were summarized in Table 1. The τr can be calculated from R2 multiplied by the chemical capacitance (CPE2).49
As shown in Table 1, for the flexible fiber-type DSSC based on the HTNT array, both R2 and τr are smaller than that of the flexible fiber-type DSSC based on the STNT array, indicating a faster electron recombination rate (or shorter electron lifetime) occurs within the flexible fiber-type DSSC based on the HTNT array. Considering that the severe charge recombination process in the conduction band of TiO2 hindered the VOC value, the flexible fiber-type DSSC, constructed from the HTNT array, thus had a lower VOC value than that based on the STNT array, which was in accordance with the results shown in the Fig. 5a.50 The flexible fiber-type DSSCs, both constructed from the STNT and HTNT arrays, have the same architecture, except for the working electrodes, which indicates that the differences of the series resistance between the two types of flexible fiber-type DSSCs are mainly determined by R2. As is well-known, decreasing the series resistance will lead to the increase of FF.51 Therefore, the smaller R2 for the flexible fiber-type DSSC based on the HTNT array results in a higher FF relative to that based on the STNT array. Accordingly, the HTNT array played a favorable role in augmenting JSC and FF, while an unfavorable role in decreasing VOC. Because the increases in JSC and FF were much more remarkable than the decrease in VOC, the conversion efficiency of the flexible fiber-type DSSC was considerably improved by using the HTNT array.
Compared with conventional flexible solar cells based on Ti foil, the developed flexible fiber-type DSSCs have better flexibility. The effective length of the wire was 1.7 cm, which was irradiated perpendicularly to the working electrode. The radius of curvature of the flexible fiber-type DSSC is assumed to be constant when it is bent at a fixed angle θ (Fig. 6a). θ = 0° means that the solar cell is not bent, i.e., it is the solar cell in a straight form. The flexible fiber-type DSSC under different bending angles is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b shows the J–V characteristics of a 1.7 cm long flexible fiber-type DSSC, constructed from a HTNT array, under different bending angles. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Fig. 6c and Table S2.†Fig. 6b and c show that under certain bending angles, the η of the flexible fiber-type DSSC slightly decreases, which might have resulted from the partial damage of the HTNT array. However, under certain bending angles, the performances of the flexible fiber-type DSSC slightly improved, which can be ascribed to the reduction of the thickness of the electrolyte between the working electrode and the plastic capillary tube, thus increasing light transmission. However, for both of the two cases, the η of the bent flexible fiber-type DSSC remained relatively high. For instance, the flexible fiber-type DSSCs with the lowest η among these states, bent at θ = 30°, retained about 99% of the η displayed by the strain-free flexible fiber-type DSSC (θ = 0°). In terms of this advantage, flexible fiber-type DSSCs have potential applications in wearable electronics. Similarly with the HTNT array, the flexible fiber-type DSSCs assembled with a STNT array exhibited almost the same flexible performance (Fig. S5 and Table S3†).

Fig. 6d shows the J–V characteristics of the flexible fiber-type DSSCs based on HTNT arrays at different bending times when θ = 90°. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table S4.† After bending for 500 times, the VOC and FF remain 0.67–0.68 V and 0.80–0.82, respectively; JSC slightly decreases from 15.9 mA cm−2 to 14.2 mA cm−2. As a result, the η of the flexible fiber-type DSSC still retains 90% of its value even after the flexible fiber-type DSSC is bent for 500 times. This indicates that the flexible fiber-type DSSC has better flexibility and can withstand repeated bending.
3. Conclusion
In this paper, highly ordered hierarchical TiO2 nanotube (HTNT) arrays were synthesized using a facile and low-cost method. The HTNT arrays made up of a multitude of nanoparticles were obtained by subjecting the smooth TiO2 nanotube (STNT) arrays fabricated by a two-step anodization process to the hydrothermal treatment in the presence of NH4F aqueous solution. Subsequently, the STNT and HTNT arrays were exploited as the photoanodes in the flexible fiber-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The results showed that the conversion efficiency of the latter (8.6%) was higher than the former (6.4%), which almost never changed even if the flexible fiber-type DSSCs was bent at 180°.
4. Experimental section
Synthesis of TiO2 nanotube arrays
Highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays were fabricated by anodizing a Ti microwire (Φ = 0.25 mm, 99.7% in purity, Alfa aesar) in ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) solution containing NH4F (0.25% in mass) and H2O (0.6% in volume). In each reaction, the Ti microwire was used as the anodic metal after successive ultrasonic cleaning in acetone, de-ionized water and ethanol for fifteen minutes each. The Ti microwire was attached to the positive electrode of a DC power source. A piece of graphite was connected to the negative electrode and immersed in the electrolyte approximately 5 cm away from the Ti microwire. All the reactions were conducted at room temperature. For the better ordering and alignment of the TiO2 nanotube arrays, the Ti microwire was anodized twice. The first anodization step was performed to provide a regular pattern on the Ti surface, which acted as a starting template for the second anodization. The Ti microwire was first anodized under a potential of 60 V for 6 h. The TiO2 nanotube array was ultrasonically removed and the Ti microwire, which possessed a uniformly etched pattern, was obtained. It was again subjected to anodization at 60 V. The anodizing time was generally 10 h. Then, the samples were annealed in air at temperatures of 450 °C for 30 min with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1 and then naturally cooled to room temperature. A highly ordered smooth TiO2 nanotube (STNT) array was successfully synthesized on the Ti microwire.
Synthesis of hierarchical TiO2 nanotube arrays
The Ti microwire covered with a highly ordered STNT array was immersed in 30 mL aqueous solution of 0.11 g NH4F in a sealed Teflon autoclave reactor. The autoclave was placed into an oven and heated at 200 °C for 5–15 h. After the reaction was completed, the autoclave was removed from the oven and rapidly cooled under tap water for 10 min. Finally, the Ti microwire was removed from the autoclave, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and annealed again under the same conditions as described above. After this reaction, a highly ordered hierarchical TiO2 nanotube array (HTNT) was obtained.
Fabrication of flexible fiber-type DSSCs
Two types of working electrodes covered with STNT and HTNT arrays were separately immersed into 0.3 mM cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,20-bipyridyl-4,40-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech, China) solution for 24 h, when they cooled down from sintering to about 80 °C, followed by rinsing with ethanol to remove the physically adsorbed dye molecules. The counter electrode was a Pt wire (Φ = 0.25 mm, 99.9% in purity, Alfa aesar). The two microwires were inserted into a flexible plastic capillary tube. Then, a I−/I3− based liquid electrolyte (0.05 M I2, 1.0 M PMII (1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.5 M NMBI (1-methylbenzimidazole) and 0.1 M GNCS (guanidinium thiocyanate) in MPN (3-Methoxypropionitrile)) was injected into the capillary tube. Finally, the two ends of the capillary tube were sealed with sealing glue to prevent the evaporation of the electrolyte.
Characterizations and photoelectrochemical measurements
The morphologies and microstructures of the samples were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The crystal structures and the components of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. To estimate the amount of the dye, the sensitized electrodes were dipped into NaOH solutions (0.2 M), with solvent composed of deionized water and ethanol mixed together in a 1:1 volume ratio. The concentration of desorbed N719 was measured by absorbance using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV 5000 spectrometer, Cary). The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was measured under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight, produced by a 300-W Oriel Solar Simulator (Model, 91160) with the illumination intensity being 100 mW cm−2. An electrochemical analyzer was used to record the information of photocurrent and photovoltage. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were conducted with an electrochemical workstation with the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100000 Hz in the dark. The effective area of the flexible fiber-type DSSC was equal to the diameter of the Ti microwire covered with the STNT/HTNT arrays (ca. 260 μm) multiplied by the effective length of the wire subjected to illumination (1.6–1.7 cm).27–36
