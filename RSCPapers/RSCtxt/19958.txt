    , Accepted 17th June 2019First published on 19th June 2019AbstractHerein, a novel photothermal agent based on polyoxometalate clusters and food-borne antioxidant peptides was exploited to overcome the inherent problems of poor photothermal stability of polyoxometalate photothermal materials, which commonly appear in the current stage of development, and the inevitable simultaneous inflammatory responses during the therapeutic process.
Photothermal conversion materials have recently attracted significant attention and have extensive applications in various areas such as in solar cells,1,2 seawater desalination,3 photothermal catalysis,4 photothermal actuators5 and especially photothermal treatment.6,7 Recently, diverse photothermal materials, including noble metal nanoparticles,8–11 graphene,12 carbon nanotubes,13 transition metal sulfides (e.g. MoS214 and CuS15), porphyrin-liposomes,16 NIR-absorbing organic dyes,17,18 and supramolecular photothermal nanomaterials,19 have been developed in succession. Therefore, it is imperative to continuously develop better agents with integrated characteristics such as uniform size control, precise chemical composition, biocompatibility and storability; however, the heating temperature during the therapeutic process is often raised above 41 °C or higher, and the hyperthermic process induces necrocytosis and proinflammatory responses, which is prone to triggering bacterial infections.20,21 To date, only few studies have focused directly on the infections caused by PTT.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), as a type of inorganic metal-oxide nanosized clusters, are synthesized via a precisely modulated synthesis approach and exhibit abundant physical and chemical properties.22,23 They have been used as antibacterial24 and antiviral agents,25 magnetic contrast agents,26 as well as protein inhibitors.27 Over the past two years, the use of POMs as photothermal agents has been started because they can easily change into heteropoly blue upon reduction.28–30 Unlike the conventional photothermal materials whose photothermal abilities are dependent on the surface or internal conduction electron's resonant oscillation, some POMs can be used as photothermal agents due to charge transfer between different valence metal ions through the bridging oxygen that becomes the origin of the typical NIR absorption of POM;31 this leads to their effective NIR photothermal conversion behavior. As an emerging class of photothermal materials, POMs possess some distinct advantages such as uniform size control, precise chemical composition, biocompatibility and storability.30,32 Ever since the initial study describing the formation of a Mo-based polyoxometalate cluster via the reduction of L-ascorbic acid has been reported,28 numerous studies focused on the construction of POM-based hybrid materials assembled by different types of reduced polyoxometalates and functional organic components (containing proteins, peptides and polymers) have been reported. Moreover, POM-based hybrid materials exhibited excellent photothermal conversion efficiency; for instance, the efficiency value of a Mo154-based dendritic nanoparticle (<10 nm) could reach up to 30.9%.30 Although the polyoxometalate materials possess outstanding photothermal behaviour, there are still many challenges hindering the development of these materials that must be addressed. First, the quantity of natural heteropoly blue clusters that do not need external reduction is very limited. Only Mo154 has been exploited as a photothermal agent to date. Second, the heteropoly blue states of most POMs after external reduction are reversible and unstable. They are easily oxidized when exposed to oxygen; this greatly reduces their photothermal efficiency. Third, the bare POMs are sensitive to acidic and basic environments and electrolytes. These factors severely limit their development and application. Therefore, it is urgent to find a way to inhibit the oxidation process and improve the physiological stability while retaining both applicable intrinsic structural and photothermal properties of these photothermal therapeutic agents (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Schematic of the preparation of rSP hybrid materials and their application in photothermal therapy and the inhibition of bacterial infection. 
Food-borne antioxidant peptides, as natural antioxidants, have attracted extensive attention of the international researchers in scavenging superfluous free radicals and exhibit a very distinct advantage due to their low molecular weight, easy absorption, and high safety.33,34 Numerous antioxidant peptides have been identified and obtained from various kinds of foods such as soybeans,35 corn,36 peanuts,37 milk, eggs,38 fish and meat. The inhibition of antioxidant peptides for oxidative processes could be attributed mainly to radical quenching. These natural antioxidant peptides not only curtail free radical formation in food products by retarding lipid oxidation, but are also used as nutraceuticals to increase health by incorporation into functional foods. They are also widely used in food processing and storage, medicine making, as well as biomaterial processing.39 The ionic self-assembly of cationic short peptides and polyanions have been reported to show antimicrobial ability because the positively charged surface of the assembly materials binds with bacterial cells.24,40 Thus, the co-assembly of peptides and polyoxometalates may be suitable for antibiosis in photothermal processes.
Therefore, in the present study, the soybean pentapeptide Ser-His-Cys-Met-Asn (SHCMN) was chosen to act as an oxidation inhibitor; moreover, it was assembled with reduced polyoxometalate (rPOM) through supramolecular interactions to improve not only the photothermal and physiological stability of rPOMs but also the antimicrobial activity of the photothermal assembly materials. SHCMN is a novel food-borne antioxidant peptide identified from soybean protein hydrolysates and exhibits high radical-scavenging ability according to our previous study.41,42 The encapsulation of rPOMs by SHCMN is vital as our studies have shown that the formed supramolecular materials (rSP) exhibit much better photothermal stability properties than the isolated rPOM, overcoming the problems that commonly appear in maintaining stable photothermal behavior. Moreover, the obtained rSP has uniform size and exhibits good physiological stability and biocompatibility features. Importantly, the detailed characterizations demonstrate that the incorporation of the peptide and polyoxometalate lead to new antibacterial properties. The simplicity of the POM and peptide assembly procedure makes this approach highly promising for the development of heteropoly blue materials for photothermal therapy.
Short peptides were synthesized using the standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis strategy. Their purity was confirmed by analytical HPLC performed using an RP-C18 column and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS; Fig. S1, ESI†). The aqueous co-assembly of the peptide SHCMN and POM nanocluster was prepared by simply stirring a mixture of SHCMN with a POM aqueous solution.21 The POM used in this study has a −3 charge, and in the best case, the peptide has a +1 charge due to the fact that the cationic His residue can be protonated at neutral pH. However, when the peptide and POM ratio is 3:1, the assembly materials possess poor solubility. By integrating the charge numbers and solubility, the molar ratio was controlled at 1:1.
Then, the co-assembly aqueous solution (SP) was irradiated under UV light for 5 min for photo-reduction to obtain a reduced solution (rSP). During irradiation, the aqueous solution changed from yellow to dark blue. The reduced hybrid assembly rSP and isolated reactive materials were carefully characterized by FTIR elemental analysis (EA), DLS and TEM. In the FTIR spectra, the characteristic vibrations of the organic component at 3300, 2933, 2823, 1630, 1425, 1350, 1325, and 1297 cm−1 are attributed to methyl/methylene stretchings, and the peak at 1672 cm−1 is ascribed to an amine band; moreover, the peaks at 1203 and 1128 cm−1 are ascribed to the imine and carbon–sulfur bonds, respectively. In addition, the peaks of the inorganic cluster at 1064 cm−1 (P–Od), 967 cm−1 (MoOd), 867 cm−1 (Mo–Ob–Mo), and 791 cm−1 (Mo−Oc−Mo) were found, indicating that the peptide and POM frame structure were retained well in the hybrid complexes (Fig. S2 and Table S1, ESI†). For the freeze-dried rSP samples, the EA result reveals that the chemical composition of the prepared complex is the peptide and POM cluster at the molar ratio of 1:1 (Table S2, ESI†). The co-assembly is based on the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between the five cationic residues and POMs. In addition to the electrostatic interactions, the previously reported explanations revealed that a hydrophobic interaction occurred between the His residue and the POMs and hydrogen bonding occurred between the polar NH group of Ser and oxygen atoms of the POM cluster.43–45 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements demonstrated that the assembly rSP of the peptide and POM tended to form spherical aggregates with a size of 60 nm due to the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The average hydrodynamic diameter of 60 ± 15.4 nm (PDI = 0.066), measured from dynamic light scattering (DLS) in an aqueous solution, is in perfect agreement with the size observed via TEM. The particle size of the hybrid assembly complex rSP differs from the values of both the isolated peptide SHCMN and the inorganic cluster, indicating the co-assembly and structural stability of the peptide and POM cluster in an aqueous solution (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Characterization of (a) DLS curves and (b) TEM image of rSP in an aqueous solution at the concentration of 1 mM. 
We evaluated the stability of rSP by DLS and ζ-potential measurement. The measured ζ-potential value of rSP and the POM cluster is +22.4 and −32.5 mV (Fig. S3, ESI†), respectively. This result reveals that a net positive potential of the resultant aqueous spherical aggregates implies that the surface of the rSP was covered by highly concentrated positive segments. However, the co-assembly enhances the structural stability of the POM cluster, which makes the rSP suitable for in vivo applications. We repeated the DLS measurement of the rSP solution after 24 h under the same conditions. Beyond that, we repeated the DLS measurement in DMEM culture media. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the rSP maintained its aggregate state and the sizes are almost invariant, indicating its high stability in physiological conditions (Fig. S4, ESI†). We also performed the DLS and ζ-potential measurements of the assembled nanoparticles under different initial concentrations and stoichiometries (i.e., the ratio of the peptide and POM is 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1). The DLS data in Fig. S5 (ESI†) demonstrated that when the ratio of the peptide and POM is 1:3 and 1:1, the assembled nanoparticles formed small aggregates, but when the ratio is 3:1, the assembled nanoparticles formed big aggregates (about 1000 nm) and the solution possessed poor solubility. The ζ-potential value in Fig. S6 (ESI†) demonstrated that with the increase in the ratio of peptide, the assembled nanoparticles possess more positive charge, which further confirmed that the optimal molar ratio was 1:1. Furthermore, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of the rSP complex under different concentrations via culturing Hepg2 cells through the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay. The rSP and its separated components rPOM and SCHMN exhibit high cell viability. The cell viability is maintained at ca. 90% of the control cells even when the concentration of the rSP complex increases up to 104 nM, which demonstrates that the rSP exhibits high biocompatibility at the cellular level and may be applicable for further biological applications (Fig. S7, ESI†).
After photochemical reduction, the rSP solution changed into a dark blue, and a broad NIR absorption band appeared in the UV-Vis spectrum, which was assigned to an intervalence charge-transfer transition between Mo6+ and Mo5+ (Fig. 2a). This enabled the rSP to function as a photothermal agent for NIR-triggered photothermal therapy. To assess this property, we investigated the photothermal behavior of the complex in an aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, upon NIR laser irradiation (1.0 W cm−2 at 808 nm), the temperature change was monitored using an IR thermal camera for a total of 10 min. The temperature in the rSP solution increased rapidly and ascended to 57.1 °C within 10 min without heat insulation; this demonstrated high conversion efficiency from light to heat. The rSP solution after exposure in air for 24 h also showed a similar rapid temperature change. In contrast, pure POM only shows a temperature change of less than 5 °C under the same condition. While the photochemical reduction POM (rPOM) solution showed an obvious temperature increase under the same irradiation condition, it showed only a mild temperature change (∼7 °C) upon irradiation after exposure in air for 24 h. The IVCT band in the UV spectrum of the rPOM solution disappeared accordingly. These results confirmed that the co-assembly of the peptide and POM not only exhibited excellent photothermal properties, but also provided improved photothermal stability. Considering that the significant near-infrared light intensity may damage skin, tissue and other biological components, we also investigated the photothermal behavior of the rSP solution at the lower laser intensity (0.5 W cm−2 at 808 nm). The temperature in the rSP solution still clearly increased, but the highest temperature was a bit lower than that in the laser irradiation condition of 1.0 W cm−2 (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Due to the good and stable photothermal behaviour of the rSP, the photothermal therapeutic effects on tumor cells were investigated. We cultured HpeG2 cells and incubated them with the rSP and rPOM at different concentrations. After irradiation with an 808 nm laser for 10 min, the cytotoxicity was evaluated through the MTT colorimetric assay. As shown in Fig. 3a, there was noticeable cell apoptosis of the rSP complex incubation group upon 808 nm laser irradiation with the increasing concentration. For the rSP solution, after exposure in air for 24 h, the cell viability was decreased dramatically. Only 21.3% of the cells remained alive when the concentration was up to 104 nM, displaying the efficient photothermal ablation of the cancer cells. On the contrary, the rPOM group showed an obvious activity for killing the tumor cells; however, the rPOM group exhibited no obviously cell death after exposure in air for 24 h. This demonstrated that the photothermal therapeutic effects of rPOM disappeared after exposure to atmosphere, corresponding with the UV and photothermal curves (Fig. 3b). Therefore, our results indicated that the rSP could be used as an efficient and stable agent for the photothermal therapy of cancer cells.

The thermal therapeutic process is liable to induce bacterial infection due to the inflammatory response. The possible inhibition of the PTT-induced bacterial infection was evaluated by exploring the antibacterial activity of rSP with the clinically relevant bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). The antibacterial activity may result from the binding of bacteria and the stable rSP with positively charged surfaces. We monitored the incubation-time-dependent optical density (OD600) by co-culturing E. coli with rSP, rPOM and peptide in LB medium. The inhibitory effect of SHCMN or rPOM alone was poor; however, the rSP complex showed a significantly increased antibacterial effect (Fig. 4a). Correspondingly, the bacterial quantity of the rSP sample in the LB solid medium is obviously inhibited when compared with the case of the rPOM and peptide groups (Fig. 4b).

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study puts forward a simple strategy to use polyoxometalates and antioxidant peptides as a new kind of photothermal therapeutic agents. In addition to improving the poor photothermal stability of common POM-based photothermal agents, the fabricated rSP materials effectively inhibit bacterial infections induced by the PTT process. The resultant rSP exhibited superior physiological stability and biocompatibility as well as unique photothermal properties for tumor inhibition and antibacterial activity. This co-assembly of the antioxidant peptides and polyoxometalate cluster provided tremendous value to the wide range of polyoxometalate and polyoxometalate-based materials for photothermal therapy. More importantly, it is also expected that the resultant agents with extraordinary antibacterial properties can be used to avoid the inevitable inflammatory response in the field of PTT materials and expand the application of polyoxometalates in biological and medicinal sciences.
