    , Accepted 2nd March 2016First published on 2nd March 2016AbstractA pentacyclic building block containing an azepine-2,7-dione moiety, TTA, was developed. Two D–A copolymers (PTTABT and PTTABDT) using TTA as the acceptor unit were synthesized, showing good solubility and medium bandgaps. The PTTABT film exhibits a broad absorption with a FWHM of 205 nm, while PTTABDT:PC71BM solar cells gave a higher PCE of 5.46%, resulting from its higher Voc and ideal phase separation in the active layer.
Developing high-performance photovoltaic materials, especially new building blocks1 for donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers, is the key for boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJ solar cells. When designing D–A copolymers, several requirements should be satisfied: (1) good light harvesting capability to produce sufficient excitons; (2) suitable energy levels for efficient exciton dissociation and high open-circuit voltage (Voc); (3) high mobility to ensure fast charge transport and reduce charge recombination; (4) appropriate solubility for solution processing and appropriate miscibility for ideal phase separation. So far, D–A copolymers2 as the donor materials have been widely used in BHJ solar cells because of their good light harvesting capability, facile chemical modification and energy level modulation. Lots of work focused on developing new building blocks for efficient D–A copolymers. Good units such as benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,3 silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,4 benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,5 thieno[3,4-b]thiophene6 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione7 have been used. Currently, D–A copolymers based on fused-ring building blocks have attracted great attention due to their high performance and potential in making thick-film devices.8 Fused-ring units possess rigidity and coplanarity, and they can facilitate π-electron delocalization, decrease the bandgap and enhance intermolecular interactions, thus improving light absorption and photocurrent. Some representative fused-ring units were reported by Hsu,9 Jen,10 Yu,11 Cao,1d McCulloch12 and Ding1c,13et al. Up to now, copolymers based on a fused-ring unit, naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole, gave the highest PCE of 10.1%.14

N-alkyl-2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI) as an acceptor unit was developed by Marks et al. in 2008,15 and its copolymers gave a PCE of 8.7%.16 The FF got close to 80%, which is the record for organic solar cells. However, all BTI-based copolymers have relatively wider bandgaps which limit the photocurrent. Replacing thiophene with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) can extend the effective conjugation length and decrease the bandgap, thus enhancing the photocurrent.17 TT can also improve π–π stacking and charge transport. In this work, we developed a new pentacyclic acceptor unit, thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (TTA) (see Scheme 1). Two D–A copolymers (PTTABT and PTTABDT) based on TTA were synthesized. PTTABDT:PC71BM solar cells gave a PCE of 5.46%. The optical and electrochemical properties, photovoltaic performance, and the active layer morphology were discussed.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for TTA and the copolymers. Reagents: (a) TMPMgCl·LiCl, Bu3SnCl; (b) TMPMgCl·LiCl, C2Cl4Br2; (c) Pd(PPh3)4, CuI; (d) NaOH, dilute HCl; (e) (CH3CO)2O; (f) 2-octyldodecan-1-amine, concentrated H2SO4; (g) NBS. 

TTA, an axisymmetric unit, contains five fused heterocyclic rings with two TT around azepine-2,7-dione. A 2-octyldodecyl side chain is attached to the N atom to endow the monomer and copolymers with good solubility. The synthetic routes for TTA and the copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. Ethyl thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (1)18 was substituted with tributyltin or bromine to give 2 and 3, respectively. Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling of 2 and 3 gave compound 4 in high yield. 4 was hydrolyzed to produce compound 5, which further cyclized in refluxing acetic anhydride to afford the key intermediate 6. Condensation of compound 6 and 2-octyldodecan-1-amine produced TTA. Brominating TTA with NBS in CHCl3/DMF gave the monomer, TTA-Br. Copolymerization of TTA-Br and (4,4′-ditetradecyl-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5,5′-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) or (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) in refluxing toluene using the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst gave the target copolymers, PTTABT and PTTABDT, respectively. The crude products were purified via Soxhlet extraction by using methanol, hexane and chloroform successively. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and then precipitated in methanol to give the purified polymers. The polymers show good solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) for PTTABT and PTTABDT are 54.0 and 61.7 kDa with PDI of 1.97 and 1.84, respectively. The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5 wt% loss) for PTTABT and PTTABDT are 407 °C and 395 °C, respectively, indicating their good thermostability.
The absorption spectra for the polymers in solution and in solid states are presented in Fig. 1 and the optical data are listed in Table 1. All the spectra show two peaks, and the peaks at long wavelengths can be ascribed to π–π stacking. The solution spectrum for PTTABT shows two peaks at 626 and 678 nm, while that of PTTABDT shows two peaks at 588 and 632 nm. From solution to film, the absorption peaks do not make remarkable shifts, but the absorption onsets show slight red-shifts, from 745 nm to 754 nm for PTTABT and from 687 nm to 698 nm for PTTABDT, respectively, indicating enhanced π–π stacking in the solid state. The optical bandgap for PTTABT (1.64 eV) is smaller than that of PTTABDT (1.77 eV). The electrochemical properties of the polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The oxidation onset potentials (Eonox) for PTTABT and PTTABDT are 0.50 V and 0.53 V, respectively. The reduction onset potentials (Eonred) for PTTABT and PTTABDT are −1.68 V and −1.77 V, respectively. HOMO energy levels for PTTABT and PTTABDT are −5.30 eV and −5.33 eV, while LUMO energy levels for PTTABT and PTTABDT are −3.12 eV and −3.03 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap of PTTABT is 0.12 eV lower than that of PTTABDT (2.30 eV), which matches well with the difference in optical bandgaps.

Solar cells with a conventional device structure, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTTABT:PC71BM/Ca/Al, were fabricated to evaluate photovoltaic performance of PTTABT. After systematic optimization, a PCE of 3.59% was obtained with a Voc of 0.72 V, a Jsc of 8.81 mA cm−2 and a FF of 56.3%. Solar cells with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PTTABT:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were then fabricated, and the optimized PCE was 4.65% with an enhanced Jsc of 10.19 mA cm−2 and a better FF of 65.8%. The best cell had a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w) and an active layer thickness of 98 nm, with 1 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in chlorobenzene. The series resistance (Rs) for the inverted cell was 4.82 Ω cm2, which is much lower than that of the conventional cell (15.70 Ω cm2). The reduced Rs and higher transmittance of ZnO19 result in better performance of the inverted cells. Compared with PTTABT cells, PTTABDT:PC71BM inverted cells gave a higher PCE of 5.46% with a higher Voc of 0.79 V and an enhanced Jsc of 10.52 mA cm−2. The best cell had a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w) and an active layer thickness of 90 nm, with 1 vol% DIO in chlorobenzene. The device optimization details are summarized in Tables S2–S8.† The J–V curves and EQE spectra are presented in Fig. 2, and the best performance data are listed in Table 2. Though PTTABDT cells showed a narrower EQE spectrum than that of PTTABT (corresponding to their film absorption spectra), it gave much higher EQE at 339–669 nm and the highest EQE reached 71%, leading to a higher Jsc for PTTABDT cells. Jsc obtained from EQE spectra is 9.90 and 11.39 mA cm−2 for PTTABT and PTTABDT cells, respectively, confirming the value from J−V measurements.

The morphology for the blend films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3). The RMS roughnesses of PTTABT:PC71BM and PTTABDT:PC71BM blend films are 6.10 and 3.04 nm, respectively, suggesting that the latter film is smoother. The clearly separated phases with sizes of ∼20 nm in the PTTABDT:PC71BM blend film demonstrate sufficient D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation, which help to enhance the photocurrent.20 The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to determine the hole mobilities (Fig. S7†). The hole mobilities for PTTABT and PTTABDT are 2.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PTTABDT possesses a higher hole mobility than PTTABT, benefiting Jsc. The polymer films were also studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 4). The peak at 24.5° or 24.1° (for PTTABT or PTTABDT) results from π–π stacking, corresponding to d-spacings of 3.63 Å and 3.69 Å, respectively. The PTTABDT film shows a strong peak at 4.58°, suggesting a lamellar structure in the film (a d-spacing of 19.3 Å). The BDT unit has a bigger planar structure which favors molecular stacking.

Conclusions
A new fused-ring acceptor unit containing an azepine-2,7-dione moiety (TTA) was developed. Two D–A copolymers, PTTABT and PTTABDT, were synthesized, and they have medium bandgaps. The PTTABT film has a broad absorption with a FWHM of 205 nm. PTTABDT:PC71BM solar cells gave a higher PCE of 5.46%, resulting from higher Voc and ideal phase separation in the active layer. These results indicate that TTA is a potential acceptor unit for constructing D–A copolymers. By using appropriate donor units to optimize energy levels, light absorbance and hole mobility, we may obtain highly efficient D–A copolymers for BHJ solar cells in the near future.
