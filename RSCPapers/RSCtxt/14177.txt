    AbstractA new ruthenium photosensitizer, coded CYC-B7, incorporating a bithienyl-carbazole antenna ligand was designed and prepared for improving the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) device. This new sensitizer displays the low energy MLCT transition band centered at 551 nm with a high molar absorption coefficient of 2.19 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In addition, a simple approach to reduce the aggregation of bulky ruthenium dyes assembled onto the surface of TiO2 film is demonstrated. The cell based on this new heteroleptic ruthenium dye provides a high Voc of 788 mV and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 8.96%. The functionality of carbazole in CYC-B7 resulting in the increases of the Voc value of the corresponding device is verified by comparing with the performance of the DSC sensitized with a structurally similar dye without carbazole.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have emerged as the alternative photovoltaic technologies to convert sunlight into electricity by virtue of their low manufacturing cost and good conversion efficiency.1 In this type of solar cell, the dye molecule (sensitizer) self-assembled onto the surface of the wide-band gap semiconductor, TiO2, is not only the photon-to-current conversion center but also a barrier to block the undesired dark current (electrons moving backward from the TiO2 to the electrolyte). Since a DSC with an efficiency higher than 10% was demonstrated first in 1993 by Grätzel and co-workers2 using cis-di(thiocyanato)bis-(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) (N3) as a sensitizer, numerous efforts on structure modification of polypyridyl ruthenium sensitizers to enhance the light-harvesting ability in the visible and near-infrared regions as well as increasing the amphiphilicity toward the better cell performance and device robustness have been made.3–5 Amongst these dye molecules developed recently, a pioneer dye, CYC-B1,5a exhibiting a remarkably high light-harvesting capacity of up to 2.12 × 104 M−1 cm−1 by incorporating the electron-rich bithiophene, has demonstrated the potential of ruthenium dyes with the ancillary ligands containing the thiophene derivative.
It has been recognized that the short-current density (Jsc) of DSCs based on ruthenium sensitizers is closely related to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition of immobilized dye molecules, which could be improved significantly by means of extending the π-conjugation length and enrich the electron-donating ability of the ancillary ligands.4,5 In spite of this, it seems that sometimes there is a trade-off of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) in a DSC device sensitized by heteroleptic ruthenium dyes:5k the electron recombination appears easier when the coverage of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface is more sparse, due to an enlargement of the molecular volume.
With the attempts to increase the Voc of the DSC device sensitized by heteroleptic ruthenium as well as exploring how the intrinsic properties of the heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizer affect the Voc of the corresponding cell, a new heteroleptic ruthenium dye, coded CYC-B7 (its molecular structure is illustrated in Fig. 1), was synthesized and its photovoltaic performance was tested and compared with CYC-B1 that we reported previously.5a Furthermore, the effect of the staining dye concentration on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices was also studied to search for another possible way to solve the dye aggregation problem.

Results and discussion

CYC-B7 was synthesized using the typical one-pot synthetic procedure3b,5a and its structure was identified with NMR, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis as described in the Experimental section. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Gaussian 09 program6 adopting the Becke, three-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) function and DGauss Double-Zeta Valence Polarized (DGDZVP) basis set7a–c were used to optimize the geometry and calculate the molecular orbitals of CYC-B7 in DMF. The graphical representation of the calculated frontier orbitals is shown in Fig. 2. The LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and LUMO+1 are mainly localized on the mixed orbitals of dcbpy (4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine) anchoring and antenna-ancillary ligands. However, the LUMO+2 is merely located on the ancillary ligand. On the other hand, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital), HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 are contributed primarily from the Ru–NCS mixed orbitals. These features indicate that incorporating the bis-alkyl-substituted carbazole segments on the ancillary ligand may not have a significant influence on the localization of the frontier orbitals, especially the HOMOs; in other words, the MLCT transition of CYC-B7 can be as efficient as that of CYC-B1 and other high light-harvesting ruthenium dyes.5a,c,k

The electronic absorption spectra of CYC-B7, CYC-B1 and their ancillary ligands (ligand-7 and ligand-1) measured in DMF are displayed in Fig. 3. It was found that the absorption band of ligand-7 centered at 387 nm shows a red-shift of 12 nm compared to ligand-1. This result reveals that the presence of carbazole units can reinforce the electron-donating ability of the ancillary ligand thereby may also be able to enhance the spectral response of the corresponding ruthenium sensitizer. In the visible light region, CYC-B7 displays two absorption bands centered at 412 nm and 551 nm. The band at 412 nm is assigned to the overlap of intra-ligand π–π* transitions of ligand-7 and one of the MLCT bands for CYC-B7. Another peak with a λmax of 551 nm and a molar absorption coefficient (ε) of 2.19 × 104 M−1 cm−1 is attributed to the MLCT transition associated intensively with the incident photon (with longer wavelength)-to-current conversion efficiency of the cell based on CYC-B7. To gain insight into these absorption bands, the time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation of the lowest 80 singlet–singlet electronic transitions for CYC-B7 was performed using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM)7d,e with DMF as the solvent. A comparison between the experimental and calculated absorption spectra in the range of 400–800 nm of the CYC-B7 in DMF shows a good agreement based on excitation energy and relative intensities (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The excitation energies, oscillator strengths and their corresponding transition assignments of orbital contributions are also tabulated in Table S1 in the ESI†). To investigate how these excited state transitions are related to the electron transfer, we analyze the major orbital contributions of these transitions. In this study, we focused on the absorption band centered at 551 nm since it plays an important role in the power conversion efficiency of DSCs. The TD-DFT calculation shows that the experimental 551 nm absorption band is mainly contributed from the 557.58 nm excitation with higher oscillator strength of 0.2701. The 557.58 nm electronic transition mainly arises from electron density excited from HOMO−1 to LUMO (38.1%), HOMO−2 to LUMO+1 (36.8%) and HOMO−2 to LUMO (19.85%). (The relevant orbitals involved in this transition are shown in Fig. 2.) Compared to the lower-energy MLCT absorption band of its predecessors, CYC-B1,5a adding the carbazole moieties on the ancillary ligand of the ruthenium complex did not significantly affect its ε value. Nevertheless, the advantages of carbazole antennas in an optical response of dye molecules can be visualized by comparing the absorption profiles of CYC-B7 and CYC-B1 (see Fig. 3): the carbazole moiety is slightly red-shifted the absorption region, similar to what we have observed in the previous study.5g The result suggests that the device based on CYC-B7 may provide as high a short-circuit current density as that of the CYC-B1-sensitized cell, if the amounts of both molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 electrodes are similar.

The energy level of the ground state for CYC-B7 determined by square-wave voltammetry is 0.98 V (versus NHE) (Fig. 4) which is more positive than the redox potential of the iodide/tri-iodide couple used as an electrolyte in a DSC. In addition, the oxidization potential of CYC-B7 is slightly shifted by 0.04 V cathodically compared to that of CYC-B1 (measured under the same conditions and also displayed in Fig. 4). This phenomenon indicates that the presence of the terminal carbazole segment can destabilize the Ru–NCS mixed orbital. This may be a benefit in terms of the increase of the electronic transition dipole moment. The optical transition energy, E0–0, of CYC-B7 determined from its absorption onset is 1.58 eV. Neglecting entropy changes during the excitation, the excited-state redox potential, ϕ0(S+/S*) is −0.60 V (versus NHE) which is more negative than the potential of the TiO2 conduction band edge.5e,n The energy levels of the ground and excited states for CYC-B7 match the requirement of a dye for applying in DSCs.8

To compare swiftly the performance of devices using CYC-B7 and CYC-B1, respectively as an sensitizer, preliminary photovoltaic experiments were conducted using the same device parameters as we reported previously.5g The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curve and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells based on CYC-B7 (device A) and CYC-B1 (device B) under the illumination of AM (air mass) 1.5 sunlight (100 mW/cm2) are illustrated in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Encouragingly, the CYC-B7-sensitized device (device A) provides the higher open-circuit potential (Voc) of 784 mV, compared to that (748 mV) of the cell based on CYC-B1 (device B). The augmentation of Voc will be discussed more in detail later in this article. In spite of this, the CYC-B7-sensitized cell has a conversion efficiency (η) of 7.94% which is lower than that (9.66%) for the device based on CYC-B1.

By intuition, the relatively low Jsc and FF values of the CYC-B7-sensitized cell may be due to two reasons: (1) compared to CYC-B1, there is a lesser amount of CYC-B7 molecules loaded on the porous TiO2 electrode since its molecular size (4379.89 Å3) is larger than CYC-B1 (2911.08 Å3); and (2) there is a serious aggregation of CYC-B7 when it was self-assembled onto the surface of TiO2. After desorbing the CYC-B7 and CYC-B1 dyes from the practical TiO2 electrodes (active area of 0.16 cm2 and thickness of 15 μm) their UV/Vis absorption spectra were measured. It was found that the number of CYC-B7 and CYC-B1 anchored onto the surface of the TiO2 film is 1.10 × 10−8 mol and 1.44 × 10−8 mol, respectively: less CYC-B7 adsorbed on TiO2. These results confirm that the molecular volume of the sensitizer indeed plays a vital role in the dye loading onto the surface of the porous TiO2 film as we had observed before.5g Furthermore, the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 6) of the dyes assembled on TiO2 thin films (ca. 5 μm) and in DMF show that the MLCT transition band for CYC-B7 grafted on the TiO2 film has a larger blue-shift compared to that for CYC-B1. The absorption data suggested that CYC-B7 molecules adsorbed on TiO2 have a more serious H-aggregation, therefore the efficiency of CYC-B7-based cells can be improved by solving the aggregation problem.

The aggregation of dye molecules is one of the important problems to be solved in order to improve the conversion efficiency of DSCs. For solving the aggregation problem, surface engineering of the mesoporous TiO2 film with co-adsorbents9 or additives2 has been developed, and their benefits on the cell performance as well as the device durability have been proven. However, the advantages of co-adsorbents were not observed in the cells based on CYC-B7, probably due to the fact that the solvent used in dye solution was a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butylpyridine (1:1 volume ratio). An excess amount of tert-butylpyridine can increase the solubility of the dye molecule, enhancing the performance of the corresponding cell; nevertheless, it also diminishes the function of the co-adsorbents. Thus for decreasing the aggregation of the dye molecules in this system, we tried another approach: decreasing the concentration of the staining dye solution from the typical value of 0.2 mM (for device A) to 0.1 mM (for device C) and 0.05 mM (for device D). The J–V curves and the corresponding IPCE spectra of the cells (device C and device D) based on CYC-B7 are also displayed in Fig. 5. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices are also tabulated in Table 1. Encouragingly, the efficiency (η) of the CYC-B7-sensitized cell (device C) can be significantly improved from 7.94% to 8.96% when the concentration of staining dye solution decreases from 0.2 mM to 0.1 mM. The efficiency enhancement is attributed primarily to the increase in Jsc and FF values as well as maintaining a similar Voc value. The variation of the photovoltaic parameters caused by diluting the staining dye solution is similar to those10 using co-adsorbents to reduce the dye aggregation. These results reveal that the degree of aggregation for the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film can be reduced simply by diluting the staining dye solution. However the Jsc value of device D decreases when the concentration of the staining dye solution is further diluted to 0.05 mM. Meanwhile, a small decrease of Voc is also observed, due to an insufficient dye loading in the porous TiO2 electrode, resulting in an increase of the undesired backward electron transfer (dark current) from TiO2 to the electrolyte.
It is interesting to know more about how the concentration of the dye solution affects the Jsc values and therefore the conversion efficiencies of the DSC devices sensitized with CYC-B7. By desorbing dye molecules from the practical TiO2 electrodes and estimating the amount of immobilized CYC-B7, we found a smaller amount of dye anchored in the device C and D compared to that in device A (100%, 64.2% and 42.9% for device A, C and D, respectively). However, the efficiency of device C is higher than that of device A, as described in the previous paragraph. These data show that the light-harvesting efficiency of the DSC is determined not only by the amount but also by the dispersion of the dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode. The concentration of the staining dye solution affects the dispersion (aggregation) of the dye molecules and, therefore, the conversion efficiency of the corresponding DSC cell. The higher efficiency of device C is because the CYC-B7 disperses and covers well on the surface of the porous TiO2 electrode. Unfortunately, the optimal dye solution depends on the structure of the dye molecule. To gain more evidences for the different degree of aggregation (coverage) of CYC-B7 adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode, the lifetime (τ) of the electron on the TiO2 electrode was measured using the pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient at open circuit (Fig. 7). This technique measures the recombination lifetime of the injected electron with the photo-oxidized dye.11 The electrolyte used in this study is 0.5 M of LiI in CH3CN (note: I2 is not present in the electrolyte to avoid the production of the dark current). The average recombination lifetime (τ) can be estimated by fitting the transient photovoltage decay with exp(−t/τ), wherein t is the decay measuring time. Four cells (E, F, G and H) fabricated by using the same concentrations (0.2 mM, 0.2 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.05 mM, respectively) of staining dye solutions as those employed in devices A, B, C, and D were explored. The results show that the τ values of 1.71 ms, 1.90 ms and 1.68 ms were obtained for devices E, G, and H, respectively. The longer recombination lifetime (1.90 ms) in cell G is consistent with our proposal that the dye aggregation can be reduced by decreasing the concentration of the staining dye solution. Better dispersion/coverage of the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode can increase the Jsc value and therefore enhances the photo-to-current conversion efficiency of the corresponding cell.
 Fig. 7  Pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient of the cells based on CYC-B7 prepared using different concentrations of staining dye solution: cell E (0.2 mM); cell G (0.1 mM); cell H (0.05 mM) and CYC-B1 (cell F; 0.2 mM); electrolyte: 0.5 M of LiI in acetonitrile; thickness of TiO2: 15 μm). 
It is worth noting here that the average recombination lifetimes of electrons in cells based on CYC-B7 are slightly shorter than that (2.00 ms) based on CYC-B1 (device F, see Fig. 7.) This may be one of the reasons that DSC sensitized with CYC-B1 has a higher efficiency compared to those based on CYC-B7. Then, why do CYC-B7-based devices provide the higher Voc? In DSCs, the Voc is determined intrinsically by the potential difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor (TiO2), and the redox potential of the hole-conductor (or electrolyte). It will be affected by the degree of electron recombination12 and a shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge.9f To scrutinize the behavior of the dye in blocking the dark current, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the dark with various potentials for measuring the electrons transported backward from the dye covered porous TiO2 network to the tri-iodide ions. The electron lifetimes of the devices extracted from the EIS results with the transmission line fitting model13 are illustrated in Fig. 8. Under the applied bias potential close to the open-circuit voltage of devices, the electrons lifetime of devices increases in the order of devices D < A < C < B, which is consistent with the results obtained from the previous pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient measurements. It was shown that the device based on CYC-B1 shows the longest electron lifetime under various bias potentials, compared to the other three CYC-B7-sensitized devices. Both pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient and EIS results indicate that the degree of back electron recombination is not the reason for the higher Voc for CYC-B7-based DSCs compared to that sensitized with CYC-B1. That means the improved Voc in the cells based on CYC-B7 is attributed to the conduction band edge of TiO2 shifting upward (to more negative potential).14 This may be caused by the terminal carbazole segments which enhance the electric dipole moment of the dye-modified titania film under an electronic field. Interestingly, the calculated polarizability (one of the QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) parameters) shows that CYC-B7 (185.65 Å3) is larger than CYC-B1 (123.83 Å3), arising from the incorporation of the carbazole segments in CYC-B7. This datum suggests that the polarizability of the heteroleptic ruthenium complex increases through an incorporation of the hole-transport moieties which may be associated with the improvement of the Voc values even in this complicated DSC system.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have reported a new ruthenium sensitizer, CYC-B7, with a new antenna substituent consisting the electron-rich bithiophene and bis-heptyl-substituted carbazole. The functionality of carbazole in CYC-B7 results in the increase of the Voc value of the corresponding device being verified. In addition, diluting the staining dye solution has been demonstrated successfully to be a feasible approach to reducing the dye aggregation as well as to improving the cell performance. Understanding the relationship between the dye molecular structure, induced dipole moment and the open-circuit voltage of the corresponding cells provides a hint to design heteroleptic ruthenium dyes for high performance DSCs.
Experimental
All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received unless specified. Solvents were dried over sodium or CaH2 before use. The structures of the CYC-B7 dye and its intermediates were identified with 1H-NMR spectra. The structure of the CYC-B7 dye was further confirmed by FAB-MS and elemental analysis. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker 200 MHz or DRX-500 NMR spectrometer in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6. FAB-MS spectra were obtained using JMS-700 HRMS. Elemental analyses were carried out with a Heraeus CHN-O-S Rapid-F002 analysis system. UV/Vis spectra were measured using a Cary 300 Bio spectrometer. Electrochemical study of the metal complexes in solution was performed in a single-compartment, three-electrode cell with a platinum disk working electrode and a Pt wire counter electrode. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag+ and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in DMF. The square-wave voltammograms (potential step increment: 10 mV; frequency: 25 Hz) were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, the Netherlands) and ferrocene was used as a calibration internal standard.
The solvent used for desorbing the dye molecules from the practical dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes is a mixture (volume ratio of 1:1) of 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) (40 wt% in water). The detailed dye desorption process can be found in our previous report.5g
Synthesis of CYC-B7 and its intermediates

3,6-Diheptyl-9-(8-trimethylstannyl-2-bithienyl)carbazole. 
The starting material, 3,6-diheptyl-9-(2-bithienyl)carbazole, was prepared according to the procedure similar to the synthesis of 3,6-diheptyl-9-(5-trimethylstannyl-2-thienyl)carbazole5g wherein the 2-bromobithiophene was used instead of the 2-bromothiophene. 1.03 mL n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane) was added into the solution of the starting material (1.14 g, 2.16 mmol) dissolved in 50 mL anhydrous THF at −78 °C. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, and then 0.56 g trimethyltin chloride in anhydrous THF was added. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding saturated NaCl aqueous solution and the product was extracted with CH2Cl2. From the collected organic layer, the solvent was removed to afford 1.42 g (95% yield) crude product of 3,6-diheptyl-9-(8-trimethylstannyl-2-bithienyl)carbazole. This crude product was used without further purification.


Ligand-7. 
This ancillary ligand was prepared by Stille coupling of 3,6-diheptyl-9-(8-trimethylstannyl-2-bithienyl)carbazole and 4,4′-di-bromo-2,2′-bipyridine. 1.42 g of 3,6-diheptyl-9-(8-trimethylstannyl-2-bithienyl)carbazole and 0.29 g 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine were dissolved in 45 mL anhydrous DMF, then 0.14 g Pd(PPh3)4 was added as a catalyst. The mixture was refluxed under argon for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, 5 wt% NH4Cl(aq) was added to terminate the reaction and the product was extracted with CHCl3. The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3(aq), distilled water and saturated NaCl(aq), respectively. The crude product was purified with Soxhlet extraction using hexane as solvent to remove non-reacted reagent 3,6-diheptyl-9-(8-trimethylstannyl-2-bithienyl)carbazole, then using CHCl3 to extract the product ligand-7 (73.1% yield). 1H-NMR (200 MHz, δH/ppm in CDCl3): δ 8.70 (d, 4H), 7.88 (d, 4H), 7.58 (d, 2H), 7.49 (m, 6H), 7.28 (d, 4H), 7.23 (d, 4H), 7.10 (d, 2H), 2.79 (t, 8H), 1.71 (t, 8H), 1.30 (m, 32H), 0.88 (t, 12H).

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the electronic structure of CYC-B7 within the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.6 For convenience of calculations, the long heptyl-terminal chains in CYC-B7 were modeled by methyl groups. To model the partially deprotonated state of CYC-B7 dissolved in DMF, one of the protons on the anchoring groups was replaced with one counter ion, tetramethylammonium. Ground state optimizations for CYC-B7 have been performed with B3LYP exchange-correlations functional with the DGDZVP basis set.7a–c The DMF solvent effects were included in the calculations using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM).7d,e TD-DFT excited-state calculation of the lowest 80 singlet–singlet electronic transitions for CYC-B7 was performed using the same method as used for the geometry optimization. The molecular volume and QSAR properties for free sensitizers were computed using the Hyperchem7 program and the geometry optimizations were calculated with Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (ZINDO/1) semi-empirical method.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
The detailed methods for TiO2 film preparation, device fabrication, and the photocurrent–voltage measurements can be found in our earlier report.5g After sintering at each coating step, the TiO2 electrodes with an active surface area of 0.16 cm2 and thickness of 15 μm were immersed in the dye solution for 12 h (the concentration of CYC-B7 solutions were varied from 0.2 mM, to 0.05 mM); for CYC-B1 the concentration was 0.2 mM). The solvent is the mixture of acetonitrile and 4-tert-butylpyridine with the volume ratio of 1:1. A Pt-coated (thickness of 100 nm) indium tin oxide glass (ITO, sheet resistivity of 8–10 Ω/square) plate was used as a counter electrode and the electrolyte was the mixture of 0.6 M butylmethylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) in acetonitrile.
Pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient study
The pulsed-laser-induced photovoltage transient of the assembled device was recorded with a digital oscilloscope (LeCroy, model LT322). Pulsed laser excitation was applied by a frequency doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics laser, miniliteII) with 2 Hz repetition rate at 532 nm and a 7 ns pulse width at half-height. The beam size was slightly larger than 0.16 cm2 to cover the area of the device with incident energy of 1 mJ/cm2. The recombination lifetime of photo-injected electrons with oxidized dyes was measured by transient photovoltages at open circuit with the electrolyte consisting of 0.5 M LiI in acetonitrile. The average electron lifetime can be estimated by fitting a decay of the open-circuit voltage transient with exp(−t/τ), where t is time for measuring and τ is the electron recombination lifetime.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement
The electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSCs were obtained in the dark using the potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with FRA2 module and the explored frequency range was from 0.05 Hz to 1 MHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The data were analyzed and fitted by using the equivalent electric circuit model.11,12
