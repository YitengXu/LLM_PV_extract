    , Accepted 23rd September 2009First published on 5th October 2009AbstractYD12 (η = 6.7%) is a green sensitizer remarkable for its outstanding cell performance beyond that of N719 (η = 6.1%) with no added scattering layer; the additional scattering layer assists N719 in promoting the efficiency in the red shoulder of the spectrum, but has only a small effect on the improvement of the cell performance for porphyrins.
As a cost-effective energy-conversion device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have received much attention after the pioneering work of Grätzel and co-workers.1 These devices with Ru complexes as photosensitizers have attained the greatest efficiency (η∼11%) of conversion of photovoltaic power,2 but the limited availability of Ru dyes and their environmental concerns have stimulated much effort to find cheaper and safer alternative organic-based dyes.3 Among those non-Ru-based dyes, porphyrin chromophores are promising candidates because of their efficient capture of solar energy in the visible region. Numerous reports on porphyrin-based DSSC have appeared.4 In principle, the molecular design of a porphyrin sensitizer is based on a P–B–A structure, in which B represents a π-conjugation bridge serving as a spacer between the porphyrin light-harvesting center P and the carboxyl anchoring group A. A DSSC device using porphyrin sensitizers with the B–A unit functionalized at the β-position is reported to have attained a cell performance as great as η = 7.1%;4d the meso-substituted porphyrins gave smaller η values.4f,g,i,j The effects of porphyrin aggregation on the TiO2 surface,4e,5 the bridge length of the sensitizers,5c,6 and the position and the number of the B–A units4e,j,6a have all been investigated to rationalize the performance of the cell. We have reported a novel zinc porphyrin dye (YD1) with a molecular design based on a concept of a D–P–B–A structure (Scheme 1), simply adding an electron-donating diarylamino group (D) attached at the meso-position of P opposite the meso-substituted phenylethynylcarboxyl anchoring group.7 A device made from this porphyrin dye has a cell performance similar to that of a Ru-based DSSC, making the push-pull porphyrin the most efficient green dye for DSSC applications.7
 Scheme 1  Molecular design of YD1 based on a D–P–B–A structure. 
Here we report the cell performance for three new porphyrin sensitizers (YD11–YD13, Scheme 2): YD11 was modified from YD1 for which the two tert-butyl groups in the diarylamino substituent were replaced by two hydrocarbon long chains to improve its thermal and photochemical stability in a device. This design mimics the strategy applied in an amphiphilic ruthenium polypyridyl sensitizer (Z907) that has shown excellent stability toward water-induced desorption under both thermal stress and light-soaking conditions.8YD12 and YD13 have the same diarylamino substituent as in YD11 but with the phenyl group in B being replaced by naphthalene and anthracene, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of YD11–YD13 in ethanol solution; the Soret and Q bands shift toward longer wavelengths as the π system in B is expanded, because of the spectral coupling between the aromatic substituent and the porphyrin ring. This coupling effect was exceptionally pronounced in YD13, for which both Soret and Q bands become significantly broad and red-shifted. We investigated the electrochemical properties of these porphyrins using cyclic voltammetry. The measured oxidation and reduction potentials of YD11–YD13 are summarized in Table S1;† the corresponding energy-level diagram showing the HOMO and the LUMO of each porphyrin is depicted in Fig. S1.† These results indicate that electron injection from the LUMO of the excited porphyrin to the conduction band of TiO2 and dye regeneration from redox couple I−/I3− to the HOMO of the porphyrin cation are feasible.

 Fig. 1  Calibrated absorption spectra of YD11–YD13 in ethanol. 
Because of the large absorption coefficients of these porphyrins, we expect that thinner TiO2 films might suffice to produce a reasonable cell performance. We accordingly prepared three TiO2/FTO working electrodes with TiO2 film thicknesses (L) ∼5, ∼10 and ∼(10 + 4) μm for photovoltaic measurements (the corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. S2†). As the first two TiO2 films (A and B) contain only the active layer (particle size ∼20 nm), the films were essentially transparent before dye loading and they can be see-through after dye loading. The third TiO2 film (C) has the same active layer as the second one (∼10 μm) but with an additional scattering layer (∼4 μm, particle size 200–600 nm) to improve further the light-harvesting efficiency. The corresponding DSSC devices were fabricated according to a standard procedure reported elsewhere.6b,7,9
The photovoltaic measurements were performed with three to four identical working electrodes for each porphyrin (YD11–YD13) adsorbed on each TiO2 film (A–C) under the same experimental conditions. The raw data from each J–V measurement are summarized in Tables S2–S4† for films A–C, respectively; the corresponding averaged photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2a–c show one set of typical J–V curves (working electrode “a” in Tables S2–S4†) of the porphyrin-based DSSC devices for TiO2 films A–C, respectively; for comparison, the cell performances of the devices made of N719 dye with the same TiO2 films as for YD11–YD13 are shown as dashed curves in each plot. Our results indicate that both YD11 and YD12 exhibit exceptionally superior performance relative to N719 dye; the poor performance of YD13 is remarkable and is discussed below. The short-circuit photocurrent densities (JSC) of the two promising porphyrin-based devices are significantly greater than those of the N719 devices, in particular for those of film B (Fig. 2b). Even though the open-circuit photovoltages (VOC) and fill factors (FF) for the former are smaller than for the latter, the net effects of these variations make the overall efficiencies of power conversion of the YD11 and YD12 devices outperform those of the N719 devices at L∼ 10 μm without a scattering layer (Fig. 2b). YD11 (η = 6.6%) and YD12 (η = 6.7%) are thus two remarkable green sensitizers for their outstanding cell performances relative to that of N719 (η = 6.1%) without an added scattering layer (film B) for light-penetrable DSSC applications. When the ∼10-μm TiO2 films were covered with a scattering layer (film C), we found that the cell performance of N719 was significantly improved to η = 7.3% whereas the performances of the porphyrin dyes increased only slightly (η = 6.8% and 7.0% for YD11 and YD12, respectively, Fig. 2c). Our results indicate that a substantial increase in JSC for the N719 device is a key factor for the improvement of the cell performance with the addition of a scattering layer. To understand why the scattering layer was insensitive to the cell performances of the porphyrin-based devices, we performed measurements of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for each device.10

Fig. 3a–c show the efficiency spectra of the same DSSC devices of which the corresponding J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. 2a–c. Integrating the IPCE over the AM 1.5G solar spectrum gives a calculated JSC similar to the collected value for all devices under investigation (Fig. S3†). There are three important points deduced from our IPCE results. First, the efficiency spectra of both YD11 and YD12 sensitizers are similar for all three TiO2 films, but the spectra of YD12 have a Q-band shoulder slightly extended to longer wavelengths, which increases slightly JSC for YD12 relative to YD11. This effect is consistent with the absorption spectral feature shown in Fig. 1. Second, the efficiency spectra of YD13 show smaller values than those of YD11 and YD12, which explains its poor performance. This effect is inconsistent with the absorption feature shown in Fig. 1 and is discussed in the next section. Third, the efficiency spectra of YD11 and YD12 involve a large gap between the Soret and the Q bands in film A (Fig. 3a), but this gap became smaller when thicker TiO2 films (B) were applied (Fig. 3b). On addition of another scattering layer (film C), the gaps in YD11 and YD12 became even smaller so that the efficiency spectra display a nearly flat nature in the entire visible region, 400–700 nm (Fig. 3c). The shoulders of the efficiency spectra on the red side extended no further beyond the edge of the Q band in the presence of a scattering layer; for this reason only a slight improvement in JSC was found for the porphyrin-based DSSC with a scattering layer. In contrast, a significant improvement in cell performance was found for a N719-based DSSC with a scattering layer, because of the effective scattering effect in the red shoulder of the efficiency spectrum. Based on the above observations, we conclude that the involvement of the partially allowed triplet MLCT states of ruthenium complexes2a is responsible for the enhanced efficiency in the red shoulder of the IPCE spectrum of N719, whereas the effect of spin–orbit coupling in zinc porphyrins was insufficient for S0→ T1 transitions to occur; the additional scattering layer thus provides no improvement of the efficiency spectra of YD11–YD13 beyond the Q-band absorptions.

We applied femtosecond fluorescence decays to investigate the dynamics of interfacial electron injection in the porphyrin/TiO2 films (film A), with porphyrin/Al2O3 films serving as references (L∼ 5 μm). The corresponding absorption spectra of the thin-film samples appear in Fig. S4.† An additional band at ∼800 nm occurred for porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 films (∼820 nm for YD13), but this spectral feature was absent from all porphyrin-sensitized Al2O3 films. In our previous work on the spectroelectrochemistry of YD1, a characteristic band at ∼800 nm was observed for the oxidized species of YD1.7 The presence of such a band at ∼800 nm for the YD1/TiO2 film thus indicates the formation of species YD1++; the same is true for all other porphyrin sensitizers (YD11–YD13) sensitized on TiO2 films found here. For the sensitized Al2O3 films, the cationic spectral feature was absent because the excited electrons of the porphyrin sensitizers cannot inject into the conduction band of Al2O3 to form the cationic species on the Al2O3 surface.11
Femtosecond excitation of the thin-film samples was performed at 430 nm using a fluorescence up-conversion system described elsewhere.5b The emissions at the intensity maximum were optically gated with the fundamental pulse (860 nm) to yield the emission decays of YD11–YD13/TiO2 films shown in Fig. 4a–c; those of YD11–YD13/Al2O3 films are shown for comparison. The temporal profiles of all samples show multi-exponential decay, and the corresponding time coefficients were obtained on analyzing the data with a parallel kinetic model.5b,12 With the time coefficients weighted by their relative amplitudes (shown in parentheses), the average time coefficients of the TiO2 films are determined to be all similar () for YD11–YD13; those of the Al2O3 films are determined to be , 10.6, and 4.8 ps, respectively. The emission decays of the Al2O3 films reflect only the intermolecular energy transfer due to aggregation of the dye on the Al2O3 surface, but the emission decays of the TiO2 films contain not only the aggregate-induced energy transfer but also rapid electron injection from the excited state of a porphyrin into the conduction band of TiO2. If we assume that the extent of dye aggregation on both TiO2 and Al2O3 films is similar (Fig. S4†), based on the same amount of dye molecules adsorbed on the films, the quantum yields of YD11, YD12 and YD13 for electron injection on a TiO2 surface become evaluated to be Φinj = 0.83, 0.83 and 0.62, respectively.13
 Fig. 4  Femtosecond emission decay curves of thin-film samples excited at the Soret band (λex = 430 nm) and probed at the wavelength of maximum emission intensity. Panels (a)–(c) represent the transients of YD11–YD13 on TiO2 (circles) and on Al2O3 (squares) films. Solid curves represent theoretical fits with the corresponding time coefficients and relative amplitudes (in parentheses) as indicated. 
In Fig. 4, the fluorescence decays are similar for all three porphyrins sensitized on TiO2 films, but the fluorescence decay of YD13 was much more rapid than that of YD11 or YD12 sensitized on Al2O3 films. Hence the presence of the anthracene group in the bridge from YD13 to TiO2 did not hamper the rate of interfacial electron transfer for the observed small injection yield. We consider two other possibilities responsible for the small injection yield of YD13: one is the anthracene-induced rapid intramolecular relaxation due to effective vibronic coupling, and the other is the anthracene-induced rapid relaxation of intermolecular energy due to aggregation. To examine the first possibility, we measured time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) to determine the lifetimes of excited state of YD11–YD13 in dilute solutions. All three porphyrins in ethanol (2 × 10−5 M) have similar lifetimes in a nanosecond range (1.3–1.4 ns). Ultrarapid non-radiative relaxation through intramolecular channel is thus excluded. For the other possibility, we performed photovoltaic measurements for YD11–YD13 co-adsorbed with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on TiO2 (film B) in a ratio [porphyrin]:[CDCA] = 1:2; the results appear in Fig. S5,† and the obtained photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S5.† The presence of CDCA slightly decreases JSC for YD11 and YD12 through a slight reduction of the amount of dye loading, but CDCA plays a role to improve dye aggregation to some extent so as to significantly enhance the JSC for YD13. As a result, the efficiency of YD13 greatly increased from 1.8% to 2.9% in the presence of CDCA. Anthracene thus induces much more rapid intermolecular energy transfer due to dye aggregation, leading to a cell performance for YD13 poorer than for YD11 and YD12.
The electron injection yield is an important factor to be considered to improve further the cell performance of the devices for organic dyes with a tendency to aggregate. For a Ru-based DSSC, in contrast, Φinj was expected to be ∼1.0,1b,3b,14 but a smaller value (∼0.9) was reported.15 For porphyrin sensitizers such as YD11 and YD12, even though several bulky tert-butyl groups and hydrophobic long alkyl chains were incorporated around the porphyrin macrocycle, the effect of aggregation cannot be completely eliminated: there is still room for improvement of porphyrin-based solar cells from the approach of the molecular design.
In summary, three push–pull zinc porphyrin sensitizers (YD11–YD13) were designed, synthesized and characterized for highly efficient green see-through photovoltaic applications. Both YD11- and YD12-sensitized solar cells exhibit excellent cell performances that outperform those of N719-based DSSC because of their exceptionally large photocurrents generated in the 400–700 nm region with no added scattering layer. The additional scattering layer assists N719 in promoting the efficiency in the red shoulder of the spectrum, but has only a small effect on the improvement of cell performance for porphyrins. Moreover, the efficiency spectra of YD12 have a Q-band shoulder slightly extended to longer wavelengths, which increases JSC slightly and thus also increases η for YD12 relative to YD11. With the addition of a scattering layer, the cell performance of YD12 was comparable to that of N719 (η = 6.91 ± 0.15% vs. 7.27 ± 0.14%). These porphyrins adsorbed on TiO2 films have a long-lived cationic state occurring at ∼800 nm for its protracted charge recombination. Measurements of femtosecond fluorescence decay for all three porphyrins sensitized on TiO2 and Al2O3 films determined the electron injection yields for YD11, YD12, and YD13 to be 0.83, 0.83 and 0.62, respectively. The poor performance of YD13 is understood to be due to the rapid aggregate-induced energy transfer in the presence of an anthracene group in the bridge. Work is in progress to diminish the effect of dye aggregation in the device, to improve its stability and to apply this series of porphyrin dyes for prospective applications in solid-state DSSC.4d,16

The emission decays shown in Fig. 4 were well fitted on convolution of the multi-exponential decay functions () with the laser pulse (a Gaussian function with FWHM ∼220 fs), which yielded time coefficients τi (relative amplitudes Ai) of YD11–YD13 sensitized on both films indicated in each plot.
Electron injection from the electronically excited state of porphyrin into the conduction band of TiO2 competes with other radiative or non-radiative relaxation channels. The electron-injection quantum yield (Φinj) defines the fraction of photons absorbed by the porphyrin that are converted into electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, which is formulated as , in which kinj and kagg represent the non-radiative rate coefficients of electron injection and aggregate-induced energy transfer, respectively; kr and knr denote radiative and other non-radiative (e.g., intersystem crossing) rate coefficients, respectively.
