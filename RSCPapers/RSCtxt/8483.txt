    , Accepted 15th March 2015First published on 16th March 2015AbstractWe report here an efficient method for preparing high efficiency CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells under high relative humidity, where the morphology of PbI2 was found to be of crucial importance. CH3NH3PbI3 was formed on a mesoporous TiO2 layer by a two-step spin coating method. During the first-step spin-coating procedure to form a PbI2 layer, an FTO glass substrate was pre-heated at temperatures ranging from room temperature (without pre-heating) to 60 °C. An average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.16% was achieved without pre-heating, which was improved to 15.31% as the temperature of the substrate (Tsub) was raised to 50 °C. The pre-heated substrate led to higher photocurrent and voltage than the non-pre-heated one. When Tsub increased to 60 °C, the PCE declined to 10.49% due to the large portion of unreacted PbI2. Compared to the non-pre-heated substrate, unreacted PbI2 was present on the pre-heated substrates after the second-step spin-coating of CH3NH3I as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) depth profile analyses. The improved crystallinity of PbI2 induced by substrate pre-heating was responsible for incomplete conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3. Nevertheless, the increase in photocurrent and voltage by pre-heating was attributed to better pore filling and surface coverage of the perovskite layer, as observed by focused ion beam assisted scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) images, which was associated with the morphology of the PbI2 layer. According to a study on the effect of CH3NH3PbI3 thickness controlled by the concentration of PbI2, the substrate temperature was found to play a predominant role in determining the photovoltaic performance rather than thickness. A best PCE of 15.76% was achieved along with a photocurrent density of 21.27 mA cm−2, a voltage of 1.033 V and a fill factor of 0.718 from the perovskite solar cell prepared under 50% relative humidity.
Introduction
Since the first report on long-term durable solid state perovskite solar cells in 2012 (ref. 1) following the reports on organo lead halides as sensitizers in liquid electrolyte based solar cells in 2009 (ref. 2) and 2011,3 enormous attention has been focused on perovskite solar cells due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) attained by a low-cost and facile fabrication process. As a result, a PCE of 20.1% was certified in 2014.4 Solution-processed and vapor deposition methods have been proposed to achieve a high quality perovskite layer and thereby high efficiency. Deposition from PbCl2 and CH3NH3I vapors led to a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) phase with preferred orientation and flat surface morphology,5 which demonstrated a PCE of 15.4%. One-step spin coating using PbCl2 and CH3NH3I could also result in a highly oriented MAPbI3 phase, leading to a PCE of 19.3%.6 Solvent-engineering techniques were developed in one-step spin coating of PbI2 and CH3NH3I, which produced large crystal domains with a flat surface of MAPbI3.7,8 The one-step solvent engineering method has recently given rise to a PCE approaching 20%.9 Apart from the one-step solution process, a two-step sequential deposition method has alternatively been proposed, in which the reaction of CH3NH3I with the spin-coated PbI2 layer readily formed MAPbI3.10 The crystal size was controlled by varying the CH3NH3I concentration in a two-step deposition procedure and a PCE of 17.01% was achieved from large MAPbI3 cuboids.11 Regardless of preparation methods, MAPbI3 has been prepared under negligible or extremely low humidity in a glove box. However, preparation in the glove box may not be efficient for mass production from the industrial point of view. We have been thus motivated to fabricate perovskite solar cells under ambient conditions even under high humidity conditions. To achieve high photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells prepared under relative humidity higher than 30%, a modified two-step coating method has been designed and carefully conducted. While we were investigating and developing the fabrication of high efficiency perovskite solar cells under high relative humidity conditions, a method for 12.73% perovskite solar cells prepared under high relative humidity was reported using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition technology.12
Here we report an effective way for preparing high efficiency MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells under high relative humidity. In a two-step coating procedure, the morphology of the PbI2 layer deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 coated FTO glass substrate is crucial in determining the final morphology of MAPbI3 and photovoltaic performance, which is found to depend significantly on the substrate temperature while preparing the PbI2 layer under indoor humidity. The dependence of photovoltaic performance on the substrate pre-heating temperature has been investigated. Perovskite solar cells prepared under a relative humidity of around 50% demonstrated a PCE of 15.76%.
Methods
Materials synthesis
CH3NH3I was synthesized by the reaction of 27.8 ml of CH3NH2 (40 wt% in methanol, TCI) with 30 ml of HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a round bottomed flask under vigorous stirring for 2 h in an ice bath.1,3 The precipitated CH3NH3I was collected using a rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 1 h, washed with diethyl ether several times and finally dried in a vacuum for 24 h. TiO2 nanoparticles with an average diameter of about 50 nm were synthesized hydrothermally according to the method reported elsewhere.13 The seed particles with a diameter of about 20 nm were first synthesized using titanium isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) under acidic conditions at 230 °C for 12 h. The hydrothermal procedure was repeated to grow the seed particles. A TiO2 paste was prepared by mixing nanocrystalline TiO2, terpineol, ethyl cellulose and lauric acid with a nominal ratio of 1.25:6:0.9:0.1. For controlling the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film, the paste was further diluted with ethanol (99.9%, Samchun).
Solar cell fabrication
Solar cells were fabricated under indoor humidity, usually higher than 40%. FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 ohms per sq.) was cleaned in a UV-ozone cleaner for 15 min, followed by washing with detergent solution and acetone. The substrate was further cleaned by sonication in ethanol. 60 nm thick compact TiO2 was formed on the cleaned FTO glass by spin-coating the 0.15 M solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Aldrich) in 1-butanol (99.8%, Aldrich) at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s, which was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. A 150 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was formed on the compact TiO2 layer by spin-coating the diluted TiO2 paste (0.14 g ml−1) at 2000 rpm for 20 s. After the coating process, the substrate was dried at 125 °C for 5 min and annealed at 550 °C for 1 h. The mesoporous TiO2 film was post-treated with 0.02 M aqueous TiCl4 (>98%, Aldrich) solution at 70 °C for 10 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min. PbI2 solutions were prepared by dissolving 498 (1.0 M), 392 (0.8 M) and 290 (0.6 M) mg PbI2 (99%, Aldrich) in 1 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich) at 60 °C. 20 μl of PbI2 solution was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 film at 7000 rpm for 20 s. The solution temperature was kept at 60 °C while spin-coating. Before PbI2 coating, the substrates were pre-heated at 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C on a hot plate respectively. After the coating process, the film was dried at 40 °C for 3 min, followed by 100 °C for 5 min. To convert the PbI2 layer to MAPbI3, 300 μl of 0.044 M (7 mg ml−1) CH3NH3I dissolved in 2-propanol was spin-coated on top of the PbI2 layer at 0 rpm for 45 s (loading time) followed by 4000 rpm for 20 s, which was dried at 100 °C for 5 min. A spiro-MeOTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD in 1 ml chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (520 mg/1 ml acetonitrile (99.8%, Aldrich)) were added. The spiro-MeOTAD solution was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 film at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, gold was thermally evaporated at 1 Å s−1.
Characterization
The photocurrent density and voltage curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G one-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA). A 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) was used as a light source. The light intensity was adjusted using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-2 filter. During the measurement the device was covered with a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.10 cm2. Morphologies were investigated using a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (HR FE-SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL) and a focused ion beam assisted SEM (FIB-SEM, Zeiss Auriga). The crystal structures of the PbI2 and MAPbI3 formed on the mesoporous-TiO2 films were investigated using an X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD, D8 ADVANCE, Bruker Corporation) with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 4 °C min−1 under operation conditions of 40 kV and 40 mA. The absorption spectra of PbI2 and MAPbI3 films were analyzed using an UV/vis spectrometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer) in the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies), where the excited wavelength was 530 nm and detected in the wavelength range of 600 to 900 nm with 10 nm increment. The depth profiles of the MAPbI3 films were recorded using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS, Model-TOF-SIMS 5 of ION-TOF GmbH, Germany), where the pulsed primary ions from a 25 keV Bi+ liquid-metal ion gun were used to bombard the sample surface to produce secondary ions, and a 1 keV O2 source was used to sputter out the layers from the sample surface in order to investigate the depth. The sputtering was performed on a 150 × 150 μm2 area, whereas the analysis was done on a 40 × 40 μm2 area for all samples. The layer thickness was measured using an alpha-step IQ surface profiler (KLA Tencor).
Results and discussion
Two-step spin coating was performed outside the glove box and under indoor humidity conditions. In the two-step spin coating procedure in the glove box, the DMF solution of PbI2 has been normally spin-coated on the FTO glass substrate without pre-heating the substrate. However, we found that a turbid yellow PbI2 film was formed under indoor humidity conditions, which became serious with the increase of relative humidity. For the case of the substrate with pre-heating, the deposited PbI2 layers became more transparent. This indicates that the morphology of the deposited PbI2 film is likely to be influenced by substrate pre-heating. Fig. 1 shows plane-view and cross-sectional SEM images of the PbI2 films depending on the pre-heating temperature. Imperfect coverage of PbI2 on the substrate with porous nature is observed without pre-heating, whereas the substrate is fully covered with PbI2 when the substrate is pre-heated. It is also found that perovskite is well infiltrated into the mesopores of the TiO2 film upon pre-heating the substrate compared to the non-pre-heated substrate. The PbI2 layer thickness increases with increasing the pre-heating temperature from 40 °C to 60 °C. The average thickness of the PbI2 film is estimated to be 300 nm, 350 nm, 400 nm and 540 nm without pre-heating and with pre-heating at 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. This increase seems to be related to competition between the solvent evaporation rate and PbI2 crystallization rate, that is, the PbI2 crystallization rate becomes higher than the solvent evaporation rate as the pre-heating temperature increases.

Scale bars in (a–d) represent 1 μm and 300 nm in (e–h). 

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of MAPbI3 formed by spin-coating of CH3NH3I solution on the PbI2 coated substrate prepared at different substrate temperatures. Cuboid MAPbI3 crystals are formed with gaps between crystals while depositing CH3NH3I on the PbI2 prepared without pre-heating (Fig. 2(a)). On the other hand, cuboids are closely packed when the substrates are pre-heated (Fig. 2(b)–(d)). It is noted that the MAPbI3 size increases as the pre-heating temperature increases (∼200 nm without pre-heating, ∼400 nm at 40 °C and 50 °C and ∼800 nm at 60 °C), which is associated with the conversion rate of PbI2 to MAPbI3. If the conversion reaction requires a longer time, the crystal is expected to grow bigger. It was reported that it took a very long time (several days) to obtain large sized single crystal MAPbI3,14–17 which means that slow reaction leads to a large crystal. Thus, an increase in the MAPbI3 crystal size with pre-heating temperature is probably ascribed to the slower reaction due to the increased crystallinity and in part thickness of PbI2.

X-ray diffraction was performed to investigate any change in crystallinity depending on the substrate pre-heating temperature. Fig. 3(a) shows the XRD patterns of the PbI2 films on the mesoporous TiO2 coated FTO glass at different pre-heating temperatures. The (001) peak at 2 theta = 12.6° becomes intense and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) narrows after pre-heating and as the pre-heating temperature increases, which indicates that the crystallinity and X-ray crystallite size increase simultaneously. Such an improved crystallinity of PbI2 is expected to retard the conversion of PbI2 into MAPbI3. Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD patterns of MAPbI3. Compared to full conversion of PbI2 into MAPbI3 without pre-heating, an unreacted PbI2 peak appears upon pre-heating the substrate and its intensity increases as the pre-heating temperature increases. As expected, the large portion of the unreacted PbI2 at high substrate pre-heating temperature is attributed to the improved crystallinity of the deposited PbI2, associated with a longer reaction period. We have tried to convert fully the PbI2 prepared at a pre-heating temperature of 60 °C into MAPbI3 by prolonging the loading time of CH3NH3I, it was however hardly successful because PbI2 would start to dissolve partially upon long exposure to 2-propanol. Although some unreacted PbI2 is present in the film, the residual PbI2 was reported to bring about a passivation effect in perovskite solar cells.18
 Fig. 3  X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) PbI2 and (b) MAPbI3 films depending on the substrate temperature. Inset in (a) shows the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (001) peak of PbI2. These data were collected using PbI2 and MAPbI3 films formed on mesoporous TiO2 deposited FTO glass substrates. 
TOF-SIMS depth profiling was carried out for elemental analysis in the film. Fig. 4 displays the depth profile of the MAPbI3 layer formed on the mesoporous TiO2 coated FTO glass substrate depending on the substrate pre-heating temperature. Elements of C, N, H, Pb, I, Ti, O, Sn and F were detected, where H, N, Pb, I, Ti, O and Sn are displayed in the figure. As can be seen in Fig. 4, Pb decreases in parallel with I and then their intensities are unchanged with time. The large cuboid of perovskite results in an inhomogeneous perovskite capping layer, and both parts with thin and thick perovskite capping layers are etched simultaneously during the TOF-SIMS measurement. As a result, the Pb and I profiles appear to decrease when crossing the perovskite capping layer. This indicates that Pb and I are in the same compound such as MAPbI3 and/or PbI2. Ti and O increase simultaneously and then their intensities are saturated, which is due to the mesoporous TiO2 film. For the case of the substrate without pre-heating, the intensities of Pb and I decrease gradually up to about 100 s (Fig. 4(a)), while they decrease up to 180 s for the case of the 60 °C-pre-heated substrate (Fig. 4(d)). This indicates that the latter case has a thicker MAPbI3 layer. Since no PbI2 peak is detected for the non-pre-heated case, depth profiling of Pb and I was performed for pure MAPbI3. There is difference in depth profiles when comparing the depth profiles of Pb and I for the 60 °C-pre-heated sample with those for the non-pre-heated one in Fig. 4(a) and (d), which may be due to the presence of PbI2 as detected by XRD. The Pb content in PbI2 is 50% with respect to iodide, while Pb is 33% in MAPbI3. The decreasing rate of Pb from 0 s to 100 s in the 60 °C-pre-heated sample is slower than that in the non-pre-heated one, which is indicative of the higher Pb content. The unreacted PbI2 is probably to be present in the bulk of the perovskite capping layer, because the conversion of PbI2 in the bulk of the thin film into MAPbI3 takes a much longer time compared to the conversion rate of PbI2 in the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 film. It has been reported that CH3NH3I insertion hardly proceeds beyond the surface of thin PbI2 films, and that the complete transformation of the crystal structure requires several hours while the conversion of PbI2 in mesoporous TiO2 into MAPbI3 is completed within one minute.10 If the wide band gap insulating PbI2 layer is present near the FTO, charge collection at FTO may be significantly hindered by the unreacted PbI2 layer. However, all the samples prepared by pre-heating the substrate show higher photocurrent despite the presence of PbI2 (see Fig. 5), supporting that the unreacted PbI2 exists in the bulk of the MAPbI3 capping layer.

Depth profiling was performed from the perovskite layer to the FTO substrate.

Fig. 5 shows short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) depending on the pre-heating temperature. The average photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. Jsc and Voc are significantly higher for the 40 °C- and 50 °C-pre-heated cases than for the non-pre-heated one. In addition, FF is slightly higher for the pre-heated cases. Jsc is improved from 16.94 mA cm−2 for the non-pre-heated case to 19.63 and to 20.71 mA cm−2 upon the deposition of PbI2 on the 40 °C- and 50 °C-pre-heated substrates, respectively. Voc is also enhanced from 937 mV to 1012 and 1017 mV. As a result, the average PCE is improved from 11.16% to 14.53 and 15.31%. On the other hand, the device prepared based on the 60 °C-pre-heating procedure deteriorates the PCE to 10.49% along with large standard deviation. Compared to the non-pre-heated case, the lower PCE of the 60 °C-pre-heated case is mainly due to the lower FF in spite of slightly higher Jsc and Voc. The superior performance obtained by the pre-heating procedure (40 °C and 50 °C) is due to the morphology of MAPbI3 determined by the morphology of deposited PbI2, as investigated previously. To understand the property–structure relationship, FIB-assisted SEM images are obtained for the full cell.

FIB-SEM images of full cells in Fig. 6 show clearly each layer. The mesoporous TiO2 film is not fully covered by the MAPbI3 crystals when processing without pre-heating as can be seen in Fig. 6(a). The uncovered TiO2 is directly brought into contact with spiro-MeOTAD, which is likely to be responsible for low Voc due to recombination.19 The relatively low Jsc may be attributed to low MAPbI3 coverage. The coverage of the TiO2 layer with MAPbI3 becomes better by substrate pre-heating and fully covered upon pre-heating the substrate at 50 °C (Fig. 6(c)). Thus higher Voc along with higher Jsc can be explained by the morphology and coverage of MAPbI3 for 40 °C- and 50 °C-pre-heating cases. It is to be noted that large MAPbI3 crystals do not fully cover the TiO2 film upon pre-heating at 60 °C (Fig. 6(d)), which deteriorates Jsc and Voc being close to those obtained without pre-heating. Moreover, the increased capping layer thickness of MAPbI3 for 60 °C-pre-heating is in part responsible for low FF due to the increase in resistance.20,21 From the cross-sectional SEM study on the full cell structure, the highest performance obtained by the 50 °C-pre-heating procedure can be explained.

Fig. 7 compares the PL intensity of the MAPbI3 film depending on the pre-heating temperature. The sample for PL measurement is composed of the MAPbI3 film deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 coated FTO substrate (see the inset in Fig. 7). The emission peaks appearing in the 750–800 nm range resulted from the PL of MAPbI3 because the emission photon energy corresponds to the band gap of about 1.6 eV.22 The PL peaks shift to longer wavelength as the pre-heating temperature increases. Since the PL of perovskites is expected to occur due to the recombination of localized excitons, the bathochromic shift of both absorption (not shown here) and PL spectra can be attributed to less localized exciton states in large crystals. In addition, compared to the non-pre-heating case, the PL intensity decreases significantly upon pre-heating. When considering higher coverage of MAPbI3 for the pre-heated cases than the non-preheated one, the reduced PL intensity is due to better electron injection into mesoporous TiO2. This is consistent with interfacial morphology as confirmed by FIB-SEM. The improved Jsc is related to better charge separation and thereby charge collection. The lowest PL intensity observed for the 60 °C-pre-heating case is indicative of more effective charge separation occurring at the TiO2/perovskite interface. However, despite such effective charge separation, the increased capping layer thickness and the partially uncovered TiO2 film are responsible for low Jsc and Voc.

We investigated the effect of preparation conditions on the I–V hysteresis. Fig. 8 compares the I–V hysteresis, where no significant I–V hysteresis in terms of the scan direction is observed for the device prepared without pre-heating conditions. On the other hand, the I–V hysteresis is pronounced as the pre-heating temperature increases and serious under 60 °C-pre-heating conditions. It was reported that the I–V hysteresis was dependent on the MAPbI3 crystal size and the presence and absence of the mesoporous TiO2 layer,23 where serious I–V hysteresis was observed from the planar structure (without mesoporous TiO2 layer) and smaller crystals. Compared to the less I–V hysteresis from the non-pre-heating conditions, the pronounced I–V hysteresis for the pre-heating conditions is due to the increased capping layer at the same thickness of TiO2.

J–V measurements were performed under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. 
Since the thickness and crystallinity of PbI2 and MAPbI3 could be changed not only by the substrate temperature but also the concentration of PbI2, it is required to investigate the effect of concentration of PbI2 (1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 M) on photovoltaic performance at different substrate temperatures (50 °C and 60 °C). Fig. 9 shows J–V curves, XRD and SEM images depending on the PbI2 concentration at 50 °C and 60 °C. Photovoltaic parameters along with PbI2 and MAPbI3 film thickness are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the thickness of MAPbI3 decreases with increasing the concentration of PbI2 solution from 1.0 M to 0.6 M. On the other hand, the MAPbI3 thickness increases as the substrate temperature increases from 50 °C to 60 °C. It is noted that Jsc, Voc and FF decrease simultaneously as the concentration of PbI2 decreases regardless of the substrate temperature. Consequently PCEs decrease from 15.01% to 11.03% at 50 °C and from 14.53% to 11.24% at 60 °C. In addition, when comparing the photovoltaic performance for the similar MAPbI3 thickness (∼665 nm for the 1.0 M PbI2 at 50 °C and ∼602 nm for the 0.8 M at 60 °C), the device prepared at 50 °C with 1.0 M PbI2 shows better photovoltaic performance. This indicates that the substrate temperature plays a more important role in determining the performance rather than film thickness. The basis for the difference in the performance is the fact that the higher amount of unreacted PbI2 originating from the higher crystallinity of PbI2 at higher temperature, as confirmed by XRD in Fig. 9(c) and (d), leads to lower Jsc and FF. The lower Voc at higher substrate temperature is probably due to the direct contact of the hole transporting layer with mesoporous TiO2 as can be seen in Fig. 9(f), which might result from the larger cuboid formed by the higher crystallinity of PbI2. For the case of devices prepared at 60 °C, the photovoltaic performance was found to be sensitive to humidity compared to other temperatures. The PCE was reproducibly observed to be relatively low at high humidity (see Table 1) but improved at low humidity (Table 2). We can draw a conclusion that the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell prepared under ambient conditions is mainly influenced by the substrate temperature.

The best performing device with a PCE of 15.76% is obtained by the two-step deposition procedure based on the 50 °C-pre-heating condition under a relative humidity of 50% (Fig. 10). Under high relative humidity conditions, the procedure of pre-heating the substrate for the PbI2 deposition is crucial and important to achieve high efficiency because the PbI2 deposition process is sensitive to humidity.

J–V curve of the best performing perovskite solar cell prepared under the relative humidity of 50%. MAPbI3 was formed by reacting CH3NH3I with the PbI2 layer deposited at a substrate temperature of 50 °C. Data were collected by the reverse scan at AM 1.5G one sun illumination. 
Conclusions
We developed an effective way to fabricate perovskite solar cells with high photovoltaic performance exceeding 15% under high relative humidity conditions, in which the substrate pre-heating process for PbI2 deposition in the two-step coating procedure was important. While spin-coating the PbI2 solution, the pre-heated substrate led to infiltration of PbI2 into the mesopores of the TiO2 film and hence full coverage of the TiO2 film with PbI2. The optimal pre-heating temperature was around 50 °C at least in our experimental procedure. We also tried to investigate the effect of pre-heating on photovoltaic performance under one-step deposition conditions, where preliminary results showed that the pre-heating method did not work well for one-step deposition under high relative humidity more than 40%. This indicates that the PbI2 coating process is critical in producing high quality MAPbI3 under high relative humidity conditions. Without pre-heating conditions, an average PCE of 10–11% is observed, while the PCE over 15% is reproducibly achieved by the substrate pre-heating process.
