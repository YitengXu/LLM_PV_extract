    First published on 23rd July 2014AbstractOver the past decade, high-quality lanthanide doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been successfully synthesized with the rapid development of nanotechnology. Due to the unique electron configuration of lanthanide ions, there are rich energy level structures in the near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet spectral range. However, for UCNPs, only a limited number of efficient upconversion excitation and emission have been generated due to the limited number of sensitizer (Yb3+) and activator (Tm3+, Er3+, and Ho3+) ions, and the application is mainly focused on the bio-imaging by using the upconversion luminescence of UCNPs. Recently, more and more researchers have started to focus on tuning of upconversion optical properties and developing of multi-functional UCNPs by using the combination of sub-lattice mediated energy migration, core@shell structural engineering and UCNPs based nanocomposites which greatly expands the range of applications for lanthanide-doped UCNPs. Therefore, a “nanolab” can be created on UCNPs, where the property modulation can be realized via the designed host-dopants combinations, core@shell nanostructure, energy exchange with “alien species” (organic dyes, quantum dots, etc.), and so on. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advances made in developing lanthanide-doped UCNPs, which include excitation and emission energy levels guided designing of the UCNP nanostructure, the synthesis techniques to fabricate the nanostructure with optimum energy level structure and optical properties, the fabrication of UCNPs-based nanocomposites to extend the applications by introducing the additional functional components, or integrating the functional moiety into one nanocomposite.

1. Introduction
It is known that rare-earth (RE) materials exhibit not only down conversion (Stokes type) but also efficient upconversion luminescence (UCL) (anti-Stokes).1–5 Upconversion refers to nonlinear optical processes characterized by the absorption of two or more photons, and leads to the emission of a single photon at the shorter wavelength. The phenomenon has been known since the 1960s,6 but the use of the upconversion effect has been limited to bulk glass or crystalline materials7–12 and exploited for the development of some remarkably effective optical devices such as infrared quantum counter detectors,13–15 temperature sensors,16–18 and compact solid state lasers.19–22 Until the late 1990s, nanoscience and nanotechnology experienced fast momentum.23–30 Due to the appropriate small size (which is small enough to go in and out many biological hosts, such as cytoplasm, karyon and so on) and the unique optical properties, the bio-applications of UCNPs for bioimaging have been reasonably recognized.31–34
Recent advances in the integration of UCNPs with biological and other applications have created tremendous excitements.35–42 Starting from late 1990s, the field of UCNPs has undergone a significant expansion and become one of the most active research areas within the nanoscience community. Exciting developments have been made at very fast pace from many research groups. The vast number of papers published about UCNPs over the past two decades clearly witnesses it, which has increased exponentially, with most of the activity and development happening in the last ten years. Now, UCNPs are emerging as an important class of nanomaterials owing to their wide applications in solid-state lasers, three-dimensional flat panel displays, and especially bio-labels and bio-imaging.31–34,43 Compared with the conventional biological labels, such as organic dyes and quantum dots, UCNPs have many advantages, including the virtually zero auto-fluorescence back ground for the improved signal-to-noise ratio, large anti-Stokes shifts allowing us to easily separate the PL from the excitation wavelength, narrow emission bandwidths allowing the ease of multiplexed imaging, and high resistance to photo-bleaching making them suitable for long-term repetitive imaging. In addition, UCNPs are non-blinking, less light scattering, and allow a deep tissue penetration because of excitation being in the near-infrared (NIR) region that is within the optical transparency window. Moreover, a new direction for theranostic UCNPs utilizes hierarchically built nanostructures to combine UCL imaging with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),44 computed tomography (CT),45 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT),46 positron emission tomography (PET),47 as well as with therapeutics of photo-thermal therapy (PTT),33 photo-dynamic therapy (PDT),48 gene and drug delivery,49 for in vitro and in vivo theranostics. Indeed, significant advances in theranostic UCNPs have recently been made by using the nano-chemistry that allow for nano-control of their optical properties to enhance upconversion at a selected wavelength,50 surface modification for phase transfer,51 and surface coupling chemistry for bio-conjugations.52 By way of metaphor, the fabrication of UCNPs based nanomaterials is just as creating a “lab” and making an experiment in the “lab”. All the unique properties of UCNPs based combinations can be attributed to the “reaction” or “combination” among different parts.
This review aims to summarize recent progress in the UCNPs based “nanolab”, including excitation and emission energy levels guided designing of UCNP nanostructures, the synthesis techniques to fabricate the nanostructure with optimum energy level structure, the fabrication of UCNPs based nanocomposites to extend the working range of UCNPs by introducing the additional functional component, or integrating the additional functional moiety into one nanocomposite. The organization and the scope of this review are represented in Fig. 1. In Section 2, we describe recent advances in dopant and host guided fabrication of the UCNP “nanolab” to realize the high upconversion efficiency and tunable output colors, respectively. Section 3 is dedicated to core@shell structures based luminescence engineering of the UCNP “nanolab”. Section 4 aims to describe LaMer nucleation-growth model directed controlled synthesis of lanthanide doped UCNPs. Section 5 summarizes recent advances in the fabrication of UCNPs based nanocomposites and the corresponding extended applications including controllable drug loading & releasing, PDT, bio-sensors, solar cells and so on. Finally, Section 6 concludes the overall current status, challenges, and future perspectives for the synthesis and applications of UCNPs.

2. The components of the UCNPs: dopants and hosts
An inorganic upconversion phosphor consists of a crystalline host and a dopant (usually lanthanide ions) added in a low concentration. The dopant provides luminescent centers, and the host lattice with its crystal structure provides a matrix to bring these centers into optimal positions. The ion-to-ion distance and spatial arrangement are especially important in UCL. Many lanthanide-doped UCNPs are able to emit visible light under NIR excitation, but highly efficient upconversion requires a good tunability between the host lattice, dopant ions, and doping concentration.
2.1 Lanthanide dopants
Lanthanide ions have a 4fn5s25p6 electron configuration with n = 0–14. The partly filled 4f shell is responsible for the unique optical and magnetic properties. For n electrons in 14 available orbitals there are 14 over n possible configurations and all configurations can have different energies. This gives rise to a rich energy level structure in the NIR, visible (Vis) and ultraviolet (UV) spectral range. Because the outer 5s and 5p shells shield the 4f inner shell, the electronic transitions are independent of the surrounding host materials. The trivalent ions may be doped in different host materials, varying from fluorides to oxides, depending on the application. The large variety of absorption and emission wavelengths, the independence of host materials and low vibration energy losses make lanthanide ions ideal for spectral conversion. Each lanthanide ion has a unique set of energy levels and generally exhibits a set of sharp emission peaks with distinguishable spectroscopic fingerprints (Table 1). It has been demonstrated that most of the lanthanides ions from La to Lu can exhibit upconversion, including Pr,53–57 Nd,58,59 Sm,60,61 Eu,60,61 Gd,62–64 Tb,60,61 Dy,60,61 Ho,65–67 Er,65,68–70 Tm.71,72 In addition, the luminescence from a given lanthanide ion is almost independent of different host materials due to the weak coupling of the f–f transition with the local crystal field provided by the host lattice. Thus, these features enable production of a range of selective color output by selecting different lanthanide dopants or using their combinations.

In general, upconversion is a slightly more complex nonlinear optical process characterized by the successive absorption of two or more pump photons via intermediate long lived energy states followed by the emission of the output radiation at a shorter wavelength than the pump one. The most efficient mechanisms behind the lanthanide ions based upconversion process are two-step excitation (excitation to the ground state followed by excited state absorption, GSA/ESA) and subsequent energy transfer upconversion (ETU, also known as addition de photon par transfers d'energies, the APTE effect).6,73,74 GSA/ESA is a single ion based process, whereas ETU always involves at least two ions.
Owing to the long lifetime of the excited states, single excited lanthanide ions may sequentially absorb a second photon of suitable energy at comparatively low excitation densities and reach an higher excited state. If energy gaps between three or more subsequent energy levels are very similar within one ion, sequential excitation to a highly excited state is possible with a single monochromatic light source, since each absorption step requires the same photon energy. This single doping upconversion process can be explained with ESA: excitation takes the form of successive absorption of pump photons by a single ion. The general energy diagram of the ESA process is shown in Fig. 2 for a simple three-level system. If excitation energy is resonant with the transition from ground level G to excited metastable level E1, photon absorption occurs and populates E1 from G in a process known as ground state absorption (GSA). A second pump photon that promotes the ion from E1 to higher-lying state E2 results in UCL, corresponding to the E2–G optical transition.6,73,74

Lanthanide ions with a ladder-like energy level structure are suitable for the single doping system including Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ (Fig. 2), which are currently the most common activators of UCNPs. The efficiency of the upconversion process is particularly high for single doping with Er3+, where a similar energy gap of about 1.27 eV (∼980 nm) exists between two subsequent pairs of energy levels, namely between 4I11/2 and 4I15/2 states and between 4I11/2 and the 4F7/2 states (Fig. 2). Thus, the energy levels of 4I15/2, 4I11/2, and 4F7/2 can be used to generate UCL using ∼980 nm excitation. Instead of being directly excited to the 4F7/2 state, Er3+ ions in the 4I11/2 state can relax to the 4I13/2 state, followed by excitation to the 4F9/2 state with phonon-assisted energy transfer. Hence, at least three different transitions in Er3+ ions are induced by ∼980 nm photons of the same energy, thus leading to emission of green at around 525/545 nm originated from the transitions 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2, and red at ∼660 nm originated from the transition 4F9/2–4I15/2 after the sequential absorption of two photons.73,75 Ho3+ ions have two main upconversion bands of green and red emission at 541 and 647 nm, corresponding to the transitions 5S2/5F4–5I8 and 5F5–5I8, respectively.76,77 The main upconversion band of Tm3+ ions is in the NIR range at ∼800 nm originated from the 3H4 → 3H6 transition. This NIR upconversion band is located within the “optical transparency window” for biological tissues, in which both light absorption and scattering are significantly reduced.75 This feature makes Tm3+-doped UCNPs particularly interesting for imaging deep tissue in rodents. Tm3+ ions have another three UCL bands at around 479, 450, and 350 nm, generated by the transitions of 1G4–3H6, 1D2–3F4, and 1D2–3H6, respectively.78 Several reports focused on the synthesis and investigation of single rare-earth-ion-doped nanomaterials.79–86 However, in single doping nanocrystals, the two major parameters that affect upconversion processes are the distance between two neighboring activator ions and the absorption cross-section of the ions. High doping levels can lead to deleterious cross-relaxation, resulting in quenching of excitation energy. The concentration of activator ions should be kept low and precisely adjusted to avoid the quenching effect. The upper limit of concentration depends on the exact distance of the lattice sites occupied by lanthanide ions, but in most upconversion materials the concentration of Er3+ does not exceed 3% and the concentration of Tm3+ does not above 1%. In addition, most lanthanide activator ions exhibit low absorption cross-sections, leading to low pump efficiency. Therefore, the overall upconversion efficiency for singly doped UCNPs is relatively low. To increase the absorption of lanthanide-doped UCNPs, materials are often additionally doped with strongly absorbing ions called sensitizers, which should also ensure efficient energy transfer to the activator.
To enhance UCL efficiency, a sensitizer with a sufficiently large absorption cross-section in the NIR region is usually co-doped along with the activator to take advantage of the efficient ETU process between the sensitizer and the activator. Specifically, excitation takes the form of successive absorption of pump photons by two neighboring ions. Both the ions can absorb a pump photon of the same energy, thereby populating the intermediate reservoir level E1 (Fig. 3a). Then one of the ions is promoted to upper emitting state E2 according to a non-radiative energy transfer process from the neighbor ion, while the ion relaxes back to ground state G. A short wavelength photon is released when the promoted photon is back to the ground state G.6,73,74 Yb3+ possesses an extremely simple energy level scheme with only one excited 4f level of 2F5/2 (Fig. 3b). The absorption band of Yb3+ that is located at around 980 nm due to 2F7/2–2F5/2 transition has a larger absorption cross-section than that of other lanthanide ions. Additionally, 2F7/2–2F5/2 transition of Yb3+ is well resonant with many f–f transitions of typical upconverting lanthanide ions (Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+), thus facilitating efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to other ions. The ability of the sensitizer Yb3+ ion to efficiently transfer its absorption energy to Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ ions enables a single wavelength excitation (∼980 nm) of UCNPs doped with these lanthanide ions or their various combinations for multicolor emissions (Fig. 3c-f). The selection of different emitters or combinations of lanthanide dopants is a straightforward approach to tune the upconversion multicolor emission. The first demonstration of efficient multicolor UCL in colloidal lanthanide-doped nanoparticles was reported by Haase and co-workers. They utilized Yb3+/Er3+ and Yb3+/Tm3+ co-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles to yield strong yellow and blue emissions, respectively.68 Similar observations have also been reported by Capobianco et al. in NaYF4 nanoparticles.87 Later, Nann et al. showed four color emissions from NaYbF4:Tm, NaYbF4:Ho, NaYbF4:Er, and NaYF4:Yb nanocrystals, respectively.67 Besides the single activator-sensitizer co-doping UCNPs, Liu et al. further reported on a general and versatile approach to fine-tune the UCL in a broad range of color output by a single wavelength excitation at ∼980 nm by using a dual-activator doping system (Fig. 4a and b).88 By selecting Er3+ and Tm3+ as activators, Yb3+ as a sensitizer, the UCL can be deliberately tuned from Vis to NIR under 980 nm excitation. Our group also demonstrated that multicolor fine-tuning can be alternatively achieved via the three-component dopant UCNP system (NaYF4:Yb,Ho,Tm) (Fig. 4c) in a multi-photon emission process.89 The co-doped NaYF4:Yb,Tm system exhibits a blue color emission, resulting from 1D2–3F4 and 1G4–3H6. By adding a second emitter (Ho3+) with different concentrations to the system, the relative intensity ratio of the dual emissions can be precisely controlled. Consequently, the adjustable balance of emission intensities enables the tri-doped particle system to display a tunable color output from blue to green. Similarly, the Han group has shown a simple and reproducible thermolysis approach to fabricate multicolor YF3 UCNPs with different lanthanide dopants and combinations.90 More recently, we have reported that the multicolor UCL can be deliberately tuned through the doping position control, suggesting a facile route for development of novel upconversion multiplexed probes.91 When the same amounts of dopants (Fig. 4d and e) are doped in the different positions of one consistent sized nanoparticle, the local relative concentration of dopants can be increased as the doping position is gradually transferred from the outer shell to the inner core. Due to efficient cross relaxation processes among Er3+ ions at high doping levels, the red/green emission ratio can be increased upon increasing the local relative concentration of Er3+ and Yb3+. Chan et al. used combinatorial screening of multiply doped NaYF4 nanoparticles to identify a series of doubly and triply doped UCNPs that exhibit narrow and spectrally pure emission spectra at various visible wavelengths (Fig. 4f and g).92 They also elucidated the energy transfer mechanism giving rise to spectrally pure emission by using the comprehensive kinetic model developed by their group. To sum up, given the broad range of emission wavelengths from lanthanide dopants, an appropriate selection of different lanthanide dopants or their combinations can generate a large library of emission spectra in the NIR-UV spectral region that are particularly useful for multiplexed labeling and encoding.

2.2 Host matrix
The choice of the host lattice determines the distance between dopant ions, their relative spatial position, their coordination numbers, and the type of anions surrounding the dopant. The properties of the host lattice and its interaction with the dopant ions therefore have a strong influence on the upconversion process. Furthermore, the host materials generally require close lattice matches with dopant ions and low phonon energies. As all trivalent rare earth ions exhibit similar ionic size and chemical properties, their inorganic compounds are ideal host materials for upconverting lanthanide dopant ions. In addition, alkaline earth ions (Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) and some transition metal ions (Zr4+ and Ti4+) also exhibit close ionic size to lanthanide ions.73 Therefore, inorganic compounds containing these ions are also frequently used as host materials for upconversion processes.93–96 However, lanthanide-doping in these nanocrystals is always accompanied by the formation of crystal defects such as cation vacancies, the interstitial anions which are used to maintain charge neutrality, and so on. To maintain a single-crystal phase of the host for efficient UCL, the dopant concentration should be stringently controlled. Semiconductor nanocrystals such as ZnS have also been proposed as upconversion host materials.97 However, it is still debatable whether lanthanide ions in these nanocrystals are mainly located on the outermost layer of the nanocrystals due to largely mismatched ionic size between the host and dopant ions or incorporated homogeneously in the host lattice. To date, a series of host materials such as LiYF4,71,98–100 NaYF4,44,50,70,87,101 NaGdF4,102,103 NaLuF4,104 BaYF5,105,106 KY3F10,107 BaGdF5,108 YOF,109 LuOF,110 LaOF,111 GdOF,110,111 CaF2,112,113 SrF2,112,113 and BaF2112 have been developed and reviewed in many papers. In this section, we aimed at providing a review of the latest advances made in the development of the new host materials and the corresponding new optical properties.
Generally speaking, the main intra 4f electronic-dipole transitions of rare-earth ions are forbidden by the quantum mechanical selection rules, which, however, can be broken by the local crystal field (host) of the rare-earth ions due to the capability to intermix their f states with higher electronic configurations.6,114,115 Consequently, tailoring the host crystal field of rare-earth ions and thereby the radiation parameters might become an alternative general strategy to increase the UCL for various host materials doped with diverse rare-earth ions. Li+ ions have the smallest cationic radius in the periodic table of elements, which is favorable for the movement and site occupation in the host lattice. These advantages make them attractive for the use in tailoring of the host lattice local crystal field. It has been demonstrated that Li+ ions can be doped easily into the host lattice sub-situationally or interstitially, and this can break the symmetry of the crystal field around the rare-earth ions, leading to the enhancement of PL intensity.115–118 For example, the Zhang group reported a 25 times enhancement of the visible UCL in Y2O3:Yb,Er nanoparticles by co-doping with Li+ ions in the host.115 Cai et al. reported that green and red UCL intensities of NPs were enhanced by about 47 and 23 times in NaxLi1−xGdF4:Yb,Er.116 Nann et al. have gained more than a 30-fold increase in luminescence intensity for NaxLi1−xYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs (Fig. 5a).118 Most recently, the Chen group has developed a unique strategy for the synthesis of novel LiLuF4:Ln3+ based core@shell UCNPs with typically high absolute upconversion quantum yield (QY) of 5.0 and 7.6% for Er3+ and Tm3+, respectively (Fig. 5b and c).119

As we all know, a common strategy for tuning UCL is to control the doping concentration or species of lanthanide ions.60,88,89 However, the phenomenon of concentration quenching of the excited state at high doping levels poses a significant constraint. Thus, lanthanide ions have to be stringently kept at a relatively low concentration to minimize luminescence quenching. Liu et al. described a new class of KYb2F7 host nanocrystals adopting an orthorhombic crystallographic structure in which the lanthanide ions are distributed in arrays of tetrad clusters (Fig. 5d and e).120 Importantly, this unique arrangement enables the preservation of excitation energy within the sub-lattice domain of the host and effectively minimizes the migration of excitation energy to defects, even in stoichiometric compounds with a high Yb3+ content (calculated as 98 mol%). It means that the KYb2F7 can not only serve as a host matrix, but also serve as a sensitizer to absorb and preserve the energy. This allows us to generate an unusual four-photon-promoted violet upconversion emission from Er3+ with an intensity that is more than eight times higher than previously reported. The results highlighted that the approach to enhancing upconversion through energy clustering at the sub-lattice level of the host may provide new opportunities for light-triggered biological reactions and PDT.
Furthermore, the host materials can also influence the emission color of the obtained UCNPs.109,121–123 Recently, Liu and co-workers have employed KMnF3 as a host and obtained high pure single-band red (650, 660 nm) and NIR (800 nm) emissions from Er3+, Ho3+ and Tm3+ dopants, respectively (Fig. 5f).123 The emission can be ascribed to non-radiative energy transfer from 2H9/2 and 4S3/2 levels of the Er3+ dopant to the 4T1 level of Mn2+ of host materials, followed by back transfer to the 4F9/2 level of Er3+, which is consistent with the energy transfer mechanism proposed by Zhao et al.122 Except KMnF3 host materials, the Gao group also reported the strong single-band red upconversion emission (∼669 nm) under 980 nm excitation by using YOF nanoparticles as a host matrix.109
In general, the final crystal structure and grain size are quite related to the parameters of host nanoparticles. As summarized in Table 2, the size of current synthesized host nanoparticles doped with lanthanide ions is typically in the range of 20 to 50 nm. However, the optimal size for bioimaging probes is reported to be less than 10 nm, so that the nanoparticles can be efficiently cleared from the body.50,124,125 Thus, one of the important goals still need to be achieved is to obtain small (<10 nm) lanthanide-doped nanoparticles with intense UCL. With regard to this, much effort has been input to synthesize ultra-small nanoparticles with intense UCL and many great achievements have been obtained.50,94,104,125–128 For example, the Prasad group has reported the synthesis of monodispersed α-NaYF4 host matrix based UCNPs with ultra-small size (7∼10 nm) and high upconversion efficiency (Fig. 6a and b).50 The intensity of NIR emission can increase up to 43 times along with an increase in the relative content of Yb3+ ions from 20 to 100%. The resultant ultra-small NaYbF4:Tm3+ nanocrystals manifest NIR UCL, which is 3.6 times more intense than that from NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals with a size of 25∼30 nm reported previously. Chen et al. presented a simple and reproducible thermolysis approach to synthesize 3.7 nm-sized lanthanide-doped UCNPs by using YF3 as a host matrix (Fig. 6k and l).90 The UCL intensity of these ultra-small nanoparticles was found to be about ten times brighter than that of the CaF2 host with a size of ∼4.5 nm, which were reported to be some of the smallest efficient UCNPs. The Cohen group also described the controlled synthesis of β-phase NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with a protein size from 4.5 to 15 nm (Fig. 6c and d). The core@shell β-phase NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4 nanoparticles less than 10 nm exhibit higher luminescence efficiency (0.18 ± 0.01%) than the core nanoparticles with 37 nm in size (0.14 ± 0.01%).128 Most recently, Liu et al. have synthesized the sub-10 nm hexagonal NaLuF4 host nanoparticles, which displayed bright UCL with a QY of 0.47 ± 0.06% (Fig. 6i and j).104 Mahalingam et al. showed the upconversion process via inter-particle energy transfer in lanthanide-doped BaLuF5 matrix nanocrystals with a sub-5 nm size for the first time.126 van Veggel and co-workers reported the synthesis of monodisperse 2.5∼8.0 nm NaGdF4 host nanoparticles by optimizing the reaction parameters associated with both the nucleation and growth phases in a high boiling point binary solvent mixture (Fig. 6e and f).127 Most recently, the Chen group has developed a strategy based on sodium co-doping for the synthesis of monodisperse and ultra-small CaF2:Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Tb; Yb, Er; Yb, Tm) UCNPs through a co-precipitation route. The resulting sub-10 nm CaF2:Ln3+ core-only and core@shell nanoparticles with tunable shell thickness yielded an enhanced UCL (Fig. 6g and h).94

3. Core@shell structure based luminescence engineering of the UCNPs nanolab
In addition to lanthanide-doped core-only UCNPs, much progress has also been made in the synthesis of UCNPs with core@shell structures in the past decade. It should be noted that the small lattice mismatch between the core and shell materials is the important preconditions for the fabrication of high quality core@shell structures. In the UCNPs “nanolab”, the core@shell structure plays a very important role in the luminescence engineering of UCNPs, because core@shell nanoparticles not only provide an excellent platform to combine different properties or functional units into one single nanoparticle, but also offer an effective solution to problems associated with the core-only nanoparticles.
3.1 Enhancing UCL with core@shell structure
Nano-sized lanthanide-doped UCNPs normally have a high proportion of dopant ions distributed on the surface of particles. Luminescence is readily quenched by high energy oscillators arising from surface defects and weakly bound impurities, ligands, and solvents due to the lack of effective protection by the host lattice. Excitation energy of the interior ions can also be transferred to the surface through adjacent dopant ions and eventually dissipated non-radiatively. To compensate for the deficiencies, growing a shell with small lattice mismatch around the core to reduce non-radiative decay losses of the surface luminescence can provide an effective way to improve the optical properties of UCNPs. In such core@shell structures, the dopant ions are confined in the interior core of the nanocrystals. The shell can effectively suppress energy loss on the crystal surface, leading to an enhanced luminescence efficiency. The first demonstration of the core@shell structured UCNPs was reported by Lezhnina and co-workers, which was focused on EuF3@GdF3, GdF3@EuF3, LaF3:Yb,Ho@LaF3, LaF3:Nd@LaF3 core@shell nanoparticles.129 In 2007, Chow et al. realized ∼7 and 29 times luminescence enhancement for NaYF4:Yb,Er and NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals after coating with NaYF4 shells, respectively.130 Since then, many core@shell nanocomposites have been prepared to improve the efficiency, such as NaYF4:Yb,Er(Tm)@NaGdF4,131–133 NaYF4:Yb,Er(Tm)@NaYF4,130,134,135 NaGdF4:Yb,Tm(Er,Nd)@NaGdF4,136–138 NaGdF4:Yb,Er(Tm, Ce, Tb)@NaYF4,91,139 CeF3:Tb@LaF3,140–142 KYF4:Yb,Er@KYF4,143 YOF:Yb,Er@YOF,109 and so on.
Interestingly, the Liu group has recently showed that the epitaxial growth of an optically inert NaYF4 layer around a lanthanide-doped NaGdF4@NaGdF4 core@shell nanoparticle could effectively prevent surface quenching of excitation energy (Fig. 7a and b).61 To verify the effect of the activator emission enhancement by NaYF4 layer protection, they further investigated a series of NaGdF4:Yb,Tm@NaGdF4:A@NaGdF4 core@shell@shell nanoparticles (A = Eu, Tb, Dy, Sm). The results show that Gd excitation energy can migrate through the Gd shell and dissipate through the trapping by the surface defects or solvent molecules. The photoluminescence studies show that the Tb3+ emission in the core@shell@shell nanoparticles is essentially not improved. When Gd3+ ions in the outermost shell were gradually replaced by optically inert Y3+, a steady enhancement of the activator emission was observed. Taken together, the results conclusively suggest that the suppression of surface quenching to Gd3+ ions is primarily responsible for the enhanced activator emissions.

The shell composites of the core@shell UCNPs mentioned above are all host shells without dopants. Because of the simple and single property of the host shell, the enhancement of the luminescence efficiency is very limited. So the design and fabrication of the UCNPs with more efficient core@shell structure is desirable.36,102,144 For example, Capobianco and co-workers showed a strong enhancement of the green and red emission bands of NaGdF4:Yb,Er particles by growing the Yb3+ doped NaGdF4 shells around cores (Fig. 7c and d).102 In addition to the ETU process in the NaGdF4:Yb,Er cores, additional energy transfer from excited Yb3+ ions in the shell to Er3+ ions in the core increases the overall efficiency of nanoparticles. The upconversion emission of the active core–active shell particles is more intense by a factor of about 3 (green) and 10 (red) compared to the standard core@shell particles with a doped core and an inert shell.
The fabrication of core@shell structures is a very effective strategy to improve the optical property of UCNPs. However, only a few papers reported a precise link between the shell thickness of core@shell nanoparticles and their optical properties, mainly because the core@shell structures have only been inferred from indirect measurements. Recently, with the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) technology, our group and van Veggel et al. have shown that the core@shell nanoparticles synthesized by the most widely used seed mediated heating-up method did not have a uniform shell, meaning that the core was partially covered by the shell (Fig. 8a and b).131,133,145 Therefore, the core nanoparticles cannot be passivated efficiently to decrease the core surface defects and insulated from the environmental effect. Furthermore, we also realized the direct imaging of NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 core@shell structure at the sub-nanometer level for the first time using a cryo-transmission electron microscope (Cryo-TEM) and a rigorous electron energy loss spectroscope (EELS) at a low operation temperature (96 K).131 A strong linear link between the NaGdF4 shell thickness and optical response of the hexagonal NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 core@shell nanocrystals has been established. In order to avoid the growth of the heterogeneous shell, a reproducible multi-cycle batch method to grow host shells on NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with monolayer (ML) thickness has been demonstrated for the first time.131 During the epitaxial growth of the host shell layer-by-layer, surface defects of the UCNP cores can be gradually passivated by the homogeneous shell deposition process, which results in the obvious enhancement in overall upconversion emission intensity and lifetime and more resistance to quenching by water molecules. Furthermore, we also developed a facile one-pot successive layer-by-layer (SLBL) method to realize the successive shell coating by using high boiling-point Re–OA (rare-earth chlorides dissolved in oleic acid) and Na–TFA–OA (sodium trifluoroacetate dissolved in oleic acid) as shell precursors (Fig. 8c and d).91 This protocol is flexible to deposit the uniform multi-shell by successive introduction of the shell precursor solutions instead of the lengthy multi-cycle batch operation.131 As a result of the high quality uniform shell and advanced core@shell structures, the UCL efficiency can be improved up to 0.51 ± 0.08%. Therefore, we believe that high quality UCNPs with more reasonable and advanced structures would be fabricated by simply changing amounts or species of the shell precursors with this SLBL method.

Actually, the most effective way to enhance upconversion intensity is by increasing the number of emitters.6 However, high doping levels of emitters lead to deleterious resonant energy transfer, resulting in quenching of excitation energy.73 It has been extensively demonstrated that the optimal dopant concentration is ∼2 mol% for emitter Er3+, as far as upconversion nanomaterial NaYF4:Yb,Er is concerned,146 and no effort has yet been made to surpass this limitation. Recently, Kong and Zhang et al. have demonstrated that the well accepted upper limitation of the concentration quenching threshold could increase from 2 to 5 mol% for Er3+ by a designed spatial separation strategy of the emitter doping area.147 The separated layer effectively minimizes the energy transfer between the emitters in the inside and outside layers and largely lowers the possibility of trapping of excitation energy by defects, resulting in enhancement of the UCL. Actually, the quenching effect with high doping levels of emitters has been demonstrated in 2008 by Qian and Zhang.144 They reported the synthesis of hexagonal NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4:Yb,Er nanocrystals with Tm and Er doped in the core and the shell, respectively (Fig. 9a and b). Different from the Tm/Er co-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals in which Tm fluorescence was quenched, both Tm and Er fluorescence was observed from the core@shell nanocrystals. NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanocrystals with a sandwich structure were also synthesized and the luminescence from Er and Tm were greatly enhanced. Furthermore, the Liu group showed that the spatial confinement of dissimilar dopant ions within specific regions of the core@shell nanoparticles was critical for generating efficient energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) (Fig. 9c and d).60 The core@shell structure was designed to eliminate cross relaxation induced energy loss due to direct interaction between the Yb–Tm pair and the activator in their work. To verify the requirements of a core@shell structure separating the Yb–Tm pair and the activator (Eu, Tb, Dy, Sm), they prepared a series of NaGdF4@NaGdF4 core@shell nanoparticles with the core homogeneously doped with Yb3+, Tm3+, and Tb3+ at different doping levels. By comparing the emission spectra of these core@shell nanoparticles with the Yb–Tm pair and activators at separated layers, it was found that the homogenously doped nanoparticles with Tb3+, Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+ all exhibited weak emission intensities, in stark contrast to strong emissions from the heterogeneously doped counterpart. The decreased emission intensity can be attributed to cross relaxation between Tm3+ and Tb3+ (or Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+). The suppressed emission peaks of Tm3+ centered at 360 and 450 nm also proved the interaction between Tm3+ and Tb3+ (or Eu3+, Dy3+, Sm3+). Note that the cross relaxation between Tm3+ and Tb3+ can be slightly eliminated at a low Tb3+ dopant content. However, a low concentration of Tb3+ is also unfavorable for trapping the excitation energy of Gd3+. As a result, a suppressed EMU process occurs with significant luminescence quenching.

Besides rare earth based shells, the heterogeneous core@shell structures have also been investigated for the enhancement of the upconversion efficiency of the core nanoparticles. Wang et al. reported ∼300-fold enhancement of UCL in NaYF4:Ln3+@CaF2 heterogeneous core@shell nanoparticles with a size of 10∼13 nm in comparison to the parent NaYF4:Ln3+ nanoparticles.148 The hetero shell of CaF2 was chosen as well to coat NaYbF4:Tm, leading to a 35-fold enhancement of NIR-to-NIR up-conversion intensity and reaching a QY as high as 0.6% under an excitation power density of 0.3 W cm−2.149 Han et al. reported on 2 orders of magnitude enhancement of NIR-to-UV UCL in NaYF4:Yb,Tm@CaF2 core@shell nanoparticles compared to the core nanoparticles.150 As compared to the typically used NaYF4 shell, CaF2 coating is found to be more effective in resisting quenching in aqueous medium to preserve the upconverting emissions, and more efficient in suppression of lanthanide leakage.
3.2 Tuning upconversion emission using core@shell structures
The use of core@shell architectures with two or more lanthanide activators incorporated into the core and different shells is a typical strategy to tune the luminescence of UCNPs, while maintaining a high luminescence efficiency.151 This strategy also explores different combinations of lanthanide activators to produce multicolor emissions, but exercises a spatial isolation of these lanthanide activators using an appropriate core@shell structure. It eliminates deleterious cross relaxations between the lanthanide activators and suppresses the surface-related quenching mechanism in the core nanoparticles, thus yielding a range of tunable emission with high efficiency. Recently, Liu et al. have reported the tuning of upconversion properties for a rather wide range of activators by using the combination of gadolinium sublattice mediated energy migration and core@shell structural engineering, which would expand the range of applications for lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.60 The results show that many lanthanide ions, including Tb3+, Eu3+, Dy3+ and Sm3+, without long lived intermediary energy states can also serve as the activators to generate tunable upconversion emissions spanning the visible spectral region. Similarly, the Chen group designed a novel strategy to fabricate uniform NaGdF4 NPs that were composed of a NaGdF4:Yb,Tm core and a NaGdF4:Eu shell in order to achieve dual-mode up/downconversion luminescence from identical Eu3+ ions (Fig. 10c and d). The use of such core@shell structures allows the elimination of the deleterious cross-relaxations between doped Eu3+, Yb3+and Tm3+ ions, which therefore yields a 10 times enhancement in the UCL of Eu3+ as compared with the triply-doped core-only counterparts.152 Zhang et al. reported on hexagonal phase core@shell structured NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4:Yb,Er144 and sandwich structured core@shell@shell NaYF4: Yb,Tm@NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb,Tm, NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYbF4:Tm@NaYF4:Yb, Tm, NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYbF4:Er@NaYF4:Yb,Er, and NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYbF4:Er@NaYF4:Yb,Tm nanoparticles to produce multiple emission peaks and for multi-color cellular imaging (Fig. 10a and b).36

3.3 Tuning of the excitation wavelength
One major limitation of conventional UCNPs is the low conversion efficiency especially under a low-intensity laser excitation, mainly due to the extremely weak absorption of sensitizer Yb3+ ions in the NIR wavelength range.153–155 Moreover, owing to the very narrow NIR absorption spectral window of UCNPs, 980 nm laser is the most commonly used NIR excitation source to generate UCL. However, the use of 980 nm NIR laser as an excitation source for biological applications has an intrinsic disadvantage: water, as the most significant component of the animal and human body, exhibits a high photon absorbance at around 980 nm.156 The intensity of the laser beam would be overwhelmingly attenuated while diffusing in biological tissues, resulting in a limited penetration ability. Furthermore, the absorbed light energy would transform into thermal energy, often causing serious sample overheating in conjunction with substantial cell and tissue damage under continuous irradiation. Therefore, to make UCNPs more suitable for biological applications, it is necessary to enhance the absorption of NIR light and optimize the excitation light wavelength into an appropriate range. In contrast to 980 nm NIR laser, the use of 800 nm NIR laser as the excitation source may both overcome the overheating issues and significantly improve the penetration depth for deep tissue imaging since the NIR region at around 700–900 nm reaches a minimum absorbance for all bio-molecules.156 Unfortunately, the UCL of conventional UCNPs could be hardly detected under excitation of 800 nm, due to the extremely low absorption cross section of commonly used activators (Er3+, Tm3+ and Ho3+) and a sensitizer (Yb3+) at around 800 nm. To overcome this problem, it is essential to combine UCNPs with other components which have large absorption at around 800 nm. Nd3+ ions could become a quite potential candidate as the sensitizer to realize the UCL of UCNPs, due to the intense absorption cross-section of Nd3+ around 800 nm and efficient energy transfer from excited Nd3+ to Yb3+ ions. Therefore, assisted by the delicate designing of the core@shell nanostructure, the excitation wavelength of UCNPs can be blue-shifted to ∼800 nm.
The intrinsic excitation wavelength of colloidal dispersible UCNPs was first engineered by the Han group according to the fabrication of cascade sensitization of Nd/Yb/Er (Tm) tri-doped core@shell β-NaYF4 colloidal UCNPs.157 Nevertheless, the doping concentration of Nd in the tri-doped system must be constrained to a very low level (less than 1%) to minimize the quenching of the excitation energy through efficient energy back transfer from activators to 4IJ manifolds of Nd3+. Thus, directly doping Nd3+ into UCNPs always results in much lower UCL under 800 nm irradiation than that under 980 nm irradiation. Afterwards, Xie et al. developed a new type of NaYF4:Yb,Nd,A@NaYF4:Nd (A = Tm, Er, Ho) core@shell UCNPs which can be effectively excited at 795 nm. The core@shell UCNPs were synthesized through spatially confined doping of neodymium (Nd3+) ions (Fig. 11a and b).158 The use of Nd3+ ions as sensitizers facilitates the energy transfer and photon upconversion of a series of lanthanide activators (Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+) at a biocompatible excitation wavelength (795 nm) and also significantly minimizes the overheating problem associated with 980 nm excitation. Importantly, the core@shell design enabled high-concentration doping of Nd3+ (∼20%) in the shell layer and thus markedly enhanced the UCL from the activators, providing highly attractive luminescent biomarkers for bioimaging without auto-fluorescence and concern of overheating. Similarly, to address the spatial separation of the activator and Nd3+, the Yan group also synthesized β-NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Nd core@shell nanoparticles. The new excitation band located at 808 nm could achieve high upconversion excitation efficiency similar to that at 980 nm, but with a greatly minimized tissue overheating effect.159 Wen et al. described a novel design, based on nanostructural engineering to separate unwanted electronic transitions for constructing a new class of materials displaying tunable upconversion emissions spanning from UV to the visible spectral region by single wavelength excitation at 808 nm.160 These results demonstrate that core@shell nanostructures can be harnessed to integrate and coordinate several distinct optical processes for realizing unusual upconversion of NIR light in the medical spectral window (about 800 nm) into tunable emissions spanning from UV to the visible spectral region. Most recently, Zhong et al. have fabricated a quenching-shield sandwich structure (NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaYF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb) to eliminate the photon quenching for 800 nm excited UCL of Nd3+ sensitized nanoparticles (Fig. 11c).161 This unique nanostructure is essential to eliminate the deleterious cross-relaxation pathways between the activator and the sensitizer by means of a precisely controlled transition layer (NaYF4:Yb). The optimized emission intensity of the quenching-shield sandwich structure upon 800 nm excitation is even brighter than that at 980 nm with a low excitation power density, as a result of the higher absorption cross-section of the sensitizer Nd3+ ion. Core@shell1@shell2@shell3 structured NaGdF4:Nd@NaYF4@NaGdF4:Nd,Yb,Er @NaYF4 nanocrystals were also well designed and synthesized in our group (Fig. 11d),162 each of the parts assumes the respective role and work together to achieve dual-mode up/downconversion (UC/DC) luminescence upon the low heat effect 800 nm excitation. Nd3+, Yb3+, Er3+ tri-doped NaGdF4:Nd,Yb,Er UC layers [NIR (800 nm)-to-Visible (540 nm)] with a constitutional efficient 800 nm excitable property were achieved for the in vitro bioimaging with low auto-fluorescence and photo-damage effects. Moreover, typical NIR (800 nm)-to-NIR (860–895 nm) DC luminescence of Nd3+ has also been realized with this designed nanostructure. Due to the low heat effect, high penetration depth of the excitation and the high efficiency of the DC luminescence, the in vivo high contrast DC imaging of a whole body nude mouse were achieved at the same time.

4. LaMer nucleation-growth model directed controllable synthesis of lanthanide doped UCNPs
Development of facile synthesis strategies for high quality lanthanide-doped UCNPs with controlled composition, crystalline phase, shape, and size is crucial to tune their chemical and optical properties and explore their potential applications in diverse fields. With the development of nanotechnology, a variety of methods have been established to synthesize different kinds of UCNPs with controlled crystalline phases and sizes, including co-precipitation,68,69,88,163–168 thermal decomposition,83,87,101,169,170 hydro(solvo)-thermal synthesis,2,76,93,171–177 sol–gel process,95,96,178,179 and combustion synthesis,66 which have been reviewed in many papers.6,73–75,77,155,180,181 In this review, we mainly focus on the thermolysis strategy, including one-pot heating-up, layer-by-layer growth, and Ostwald-ripening methods, which are most widely used, as they can offer precise control over the phase, shape, size, and stoichiometric composition of the core only and the core@shell UCNPs.
The research on the preparation of uniform colloidal particles dates back to the 1940s. LaMer and his colleagues pioneered the concept of “burst nucleation” during the preparation of various oil aerosols and sulfur hydrosols.182–184 In this process, many nuclei are generated at the same time, and then these nuclei start to grow without additional nucleation simultaneously. This is the essence of the “burst-nucleation” process which makes it possible to control size distribution of particles during growth. Otherwise, if the nucleation process occurred throughout the whole particle formation process, the growth histories of the particles would differ largely from one another, and consequently the control of the size distribution would be very difficult. “Burst nucleation” has been adopted as an important concept in the synthesis of monodispersed nanocrystals. It is well known that to prepare highly uniform nanocrystals, it is necessary to induce a single nucleation event and to prevent additional nucleation during the subsequent growth process. As a synthetic strategy, this method is often referred to as “the separation of nucleation and growth.”182–184 LaMer and his colleagues firstly utilized the homogeneous nucleation process to separate nucleation and growth. In this process, nuclei appear in a homogeneous solution without any seed for heterogeneous nucleation. In this homogeneous nucleation process, there exists a high energy barrier to nucleation, because the system spontaneously changes from the homogeneous to heterogeneous phase. The LaMer plot, as shown in Fig. 12, is very useful for visualizing how the energy barrier works to induce the “burst nucleation.”184 The concentration of the “monomer”, which is the minimum subunit of bulk crystals, constantly increases with time. Note that precipitation does not occur in stage I even under supersaturated conditions (S > 1), because the energy barrier for spontaneous homogeneous nucleation is extremely high. In stage II, when the nucleation occurs, the degree of supersaturation is high enough to overcome the energy barrier for nucleation, thus resulting in the formation and accumulation of stable nuclei. Since the rate of monomer consumption resulted from the nucleation and growth processes exceeds the rate of monomer supply, the monomer concentration decreases until it reaches the level at which the net nucleation rate (the number of nuclei formed per unit time) is zero. Below this level, the system enters the growth stage (stage III), in which nucleation is effectively stopped and the particles keep growing as long as the solution is supersaturated. Once monomer concentration is sufficiently depleted, growth can proceed by Ostwald ripening (stage IV). Here, sacrificial dissolution of smaller (higher-surface-energy) particles results in growth of larger particles and, thereby, fewer particles in the system.

The thermolysis strategy generally employs organometallic compounds as precursors, which decompose in a high boiling point organic solvent with the assistance of surfactants at an elevated temperature. The commonly used precursors are metallic trifluoroacetate salts or oleatum; the solvent can be 1-octadecene (ODE), paraffin oil, etc.; the surfactants can be oleic acid (OA), oleylamine (OM) or trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), which typically contain a functional capping group to coordinate the metallic elements and the long hydrocarbon chain to prevent nanoparticle aggregation. By carefully tailoring the experimental variables, such as the nature of solvents, concentration of metal precursors, reaction temperature, and time, high-quality UCNPs with a narrow size distribution, good crystallinity, and exceptional optical properties can be readily obtained from the thermolysis process. The thermolysis strategy can be divided into three routes: a one-pot heating-up method for the synthesis of both core only and core@shell UCNPs;60,131,137,145 one-pot successive layer-by-layer (SLBL)91,119,162 and Ostwald-ripening methods for the fabrication of core@shell UCNPs.185 It should be noted that all the three routes are developed under the direction of the LaMer nucleation-growth model. So, in this section we focus on the LaMer nucleation-growth model directed controllable synthesis of lanthanide-doped UCNPs.
4.1 One-pot heating-up method
For a one-pot heating-up method, the nucleation and growth match with the LaMer model for the synthesis of monodisperse UCNPs. For the synthesis of the core UCNPs, the precursors are mixed at a low temperature and then brought to the temperature at which precursor reaction or decomposition occurs sufficiently quickly to result in supersaturation (stage I). Supersaturation is again relieved by a “burst nucleation” (stage II), after which temperature is controlled to avoid additional nucleation events, allowing monomer addition to existing nuclei to occur more rapidly than new monomer formation (stage III).
The seed-mediated growth method for the synthesis of core@shell nanocrystals is the most apparent case for the separation of nucleation and growth, wherein nucleation is physically separated from growth by using preformed nanocrystals as seed nuclei. This method utilizes heterogeneous nucleation to suppress the formation of additional nuclei by homogeneous nucleation. In this method, the reaction can enter into stage III directly. Preformed nuclei are introduced into the reaction solution and then the monomers are supplied to precipitate on the surface of the existing nuclei. The lower monomer concentration should be kept during growth to suppress homogeneous nucleation. So, the one-pot heating-up method can be not only used in the synthesis of core only nanoparticles but also make a great success in the fabrication of core@shell UCNPs (Fig. 13a). The whole experiment procedure is nearly the same as the synthesis of the core nanoparticles except the presence of the seed nanoparticles. The first step is to synthesize the core nanoparticles which are then used as seeds in the second step to induce further epitaxial growth. To ensure an epitaxial growth and to create a homogeneous interface between the core and the outer shell, the host material of the shell should exhibit a low lattice mismatch with the core material. Then, the epitaxial growth can be implemented in the growth solution. The monomer of shells in the growth solution, produced by thermal decomposition of corresponding chemical precursors in the solvents of OA and ODE, is able to gradually and stably deposit on the seeding core nanoparticles and finally form the shell layer (stage III in LaMer plot).

4.2 One-pot successive layer-by-layer method for the fabrication of core@shell UCNPs
Although a one-pot heating-up method has been considered to be the most commonly used method for the fabrication of core@shell UCNPs, a few shortcomings should still be improved. For example, recent work reported by van Veggel et al. showed that the core@shell nanoparticles synthesized by the one-pot heating-up method do not have a uniform shell (the core is only partially covered by shell), indicating that the core nanoparticles cannot be passivated efficiently to decrease the core surface defects and insulated from the environmental effect.133,145 On the other hand, it was found that the size distribution of the obtained core@shell nanoparticles was larger than that of the original core. Furthermore, the bimodal size distribution was always observed when a high volume of shell precursors was introduced.60 We assume that the non-uniform shell and broader or bimodal size distribution of the obtained core@shell UCNPs result from the fast deposition speed or independent nucleation of the shell precursors induced by excessive introducing of the shell precursors. Although a homogeneous shell could be obtained by using the multi-cycle path (reducing the amount of shell precursors of each cycle) (Fig. 13a),131 owing to the selection of the low boiling point NaOH–NH4F–methanol precursor, the multi-cycle path must undergo a lengthy cooling and volatile solvent removing process during the growth of every layer of the shell. For the reason of batch operation, this process is considered to be time-consuming, laborious, and user unfriendly, especially for the synthesis of complicated multi-shell UCNPs. Based on the LaMer nucleation-growth model,182,183 our group developed a facile one-pot successive layer-by-layer method to realize the successive shell coating by using high boiling-point Re–OA and Na–TFA–OA as shell precursors (Fig. 13b).91 This protocol is flexible to deposit the uniform multi-shell by successive introduction of the shell precursor solutions instead of the lengthy multi-cycle batch operation. This protocol is flexible to deposit the uniform multi-shell on both hexagonal and cubic phase cores by successive introduction of the shell precursor solutions. The shell thickness of nanoparticles can be well controlled from 1 ML (∼0.36 nm) to more than 20 ML (∼8 nm) by simply tuning the amounts of the shell precursors. Furthermore, the tunable doping positions (core and shell doping) can also be achieved by adjusting the species and addition sequence of the shell precursors. With the SLBL method, the preformed nuclei were dissolved into the reaction solution and then the shell precursors were alternately introduced, and the formed monomers were supplied to precipitate on the surface of the nuclei. The monomer concentration was kept low during the growth to suppress homogeneous nucleation because its production and consumption maintained the balance. The released monomers could be continuously consumed to deposit as a shell without homogeneous nucleation (Fig. 13c). As discussed in Section 3, the most distinguished feature of core@shell UCNPs synthesized from the SLBL method is that the shell is very uniform. It means that the cores are completely covered by the shell, which is quite different from the non-uniform shell NPs synthesized by the commonly used one-pot heating-up method (the core is only partially covered by shell, Fig. 8a and b). As a result of the high quality uniform shells, the optical properties of the obtained core@shell nanoparticles could be improved in UCL efficiency and stability. Most recently, our group reported for the first time that the homogeneous doping approach based on the SLBL method can greatly improve the efficiency of the UCNPs.186 The quantum yield as high as 0.89 ± 0.05% is realized for the homogeneous doping NaGdF4:Yb,Er/NaYF4 UCNPs, which is nearly 2 times higher than that of the heterogeneous doping NaGdF4:Yb,Er/NaYF4 UCNPs (0.47 ± 0.05%). The influences of spatial distributions and local relative concentrations of the dopants on the optical properties of UCNPs were investigated at the single particle level. It was found that heterogeneous doping indeed existed during the spontaneous growth process of the nanoparticles. The heterogeneous doping property can further induce many negative effects on the optical properties of UCNPs, especially the luminescence efficiency. The spatial distributions and local relative concentrations of the dopants can be well controlled by the SLBL homogeneous doping method at the monolayer level and homogeneously distributed at the single particle level. With the similar SLBL method, the highly efficient LiLuF4:Ln3+@LiLuF4 core@shell UCNPs and dual-mode up/down converting NaGdF4:Nd@NaYF4@NaGdF4:Nd,Yb,Er@NaYF4 core@shell1@shell2@shell3 (Fig. 11d and e) have been well established.119,162
4.3 Ostwald-ripening strategy for the fabrication of core@shell UCNPs
The Ostwald ripening process is referred as the last stage in the LaMer plot, in the process larger particles with smaller surface-to-volume ratios are favored over energetically less stable smaller particles, resulting in the growth of larger particles at the expense of smaller ones. The fabrication of core@shell UCNPs by using the common physical phenomenon of Ostwald ripening (i.e. self-focusing by Ostwald ripening) was developed by van Veggel and co-workers.185 In their study, small α-NaYF4 sacrificial nanoparticles (SNPs) were synthesized first and then used as shell precursors. The subsequent injection of SNPs into a hot solution of NaYF4 core nanoparticles (defocusing) can induce the rapid dissolution of SNPs and their deposition onto the larger core nanoparticles (self-focusing), thereby resulting in the formation of genuine core@shell structured UCNPs with a well defined shape, narrow size distribution, and tunable shell growth. More importantly, the shell thickness and multiple layers of such core@shell UCNPs can be precisely controlled by manipulating the number of SNPs injected and/or repeating the above defocusing and self-focusing cycle. Furthermore, this method is flexible and can be easily extended to prepare other high-quality core@shell NPs with different compositions.
5. Fabrication of UCNP-based nanocomposites and applications
Multifunctional nanocomposites have recently attracted increasing attention, with the hope to extend the applications of the unique UCL property further. The introduction of another component to UCNPs can use UCL as a wavelength transformation to extend the working range, or integrating the additional functional moiety into one nanocomposite. This extends the scope of their potential applications.
5.1 UCNP–SiO2 nanocomposites
Silanization is a popular technique for surface modification of nanoparticles since silica is highly biocompatible, the ease of surface modification (e.g., –COOH, –NH2, –SH, etc.), which allows for bio-labeling, drug targeting and delivery. Furthermore, the silica-coated functional nanoparticles can be protected by the SiO2 shell against the influence of physiological conditions and outside environments. Two routes can be adopted to coat silica, depending on the polar nature of the capping ligands on the nanoparticle surface. One is the Stöber method, which can be utilized to coat silica on hydrophilic UCNPs. A precise control of the amounts of involved reagents as well the pH value can lead to a uniform growth of silica layers onto UCNPs.3,164,187,188 For example, Zhang et al. coated a very uniform and thin silica shell (1–3 nm) onto polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized hydrophilic NaYF4 nanoparticles to form a core@shell structure.164 The β-NaYF4@SiO2 core@shell nanorods were also synthesized in our group.187 Another route is the reverse micro-emulsion (water-in-oil) method to realize silica coating onto UCNPs with hydrophobic capping ligands.189–193 This method utilizes chemical reactions (the hydrolysis of TEOS) in nano-confined hydrophilic cavity (nano-reactor space) generated by a homogeneous mixture of ammonia, cyclohexane, surfactant (Igepal CO-520, TritonX-100) and TEOS. This strategy could be used to obtain silica shells with varying thicknesses. As mentioned above, one of the most salient advantages is the ease of surface modification of SiO2. Taking –NH2 functionalization as an example, it just needs replacing a part of TEOS with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and the surface of the obtained UCNPs@SiO2 can be modified with –NH2.194 With the help of the surface functional group, the “alien species” can easily be combined with UCNPs. Folic acid (FA), which has been widely used as a targeting agent, can be easily conjugated with the amine functionalized UCNPs@SiO2 nanocomposites to realize the targeting imaging or delivery. With the help of SiO2 shells, the scope of potential applications of upconversion nanomaterials is extremely extended. In 2009, Zhang and co-workers first demonstrated the potential of UCNPs based gene delivery.195 The anti-Her2 antibody and folic acid modified NaYF4@SiO2 nanoparticles were prepared and used for luminescence imaging and targeted delivery of siRNA. The results showed that GL3 siRNAs were delivered to SK-BR-3 cells with the Her2 receptor by using the nanoparticles, and their delivery could be tracked. And then, a FRET system based on ultra-fine silica coated NaYF4 UCNPs was designed by the same group to study the intracellular fate of siRNA in live cells.196 A FRET phenomenon between the UCNP donor and the siRNA intercalating dye BOBO-3 acceptor was simultaneously used to study their intracellular uptake, release and bio-stability. Chien and co-workers formulated UCNPs@SiO2 nanocomposites as the NIR-triggered targeting and drug delivery vehicles that successfully deliver in vitro and in vivo for NIR photo-controlled targeting, bioimaging, and chemotherapy.197 To achieve photo-targeting, the tumor-homing agent (i.e., folic acid) has been constructed as a photo-responsive molecule. For the chemotherapeutic effect, the anti-tumor drug doxorubicin is thiolated on the surface of SiO2 to form a disulfide bond that can be cleaved by lysosomal enzymes within the cells. The caged UCNPs can serve as a platform for the improvement of selective targeting and possible reduction of adverse side effects from chemotherapy. Zhai et al. reported a novel design based on a combination of UCNPs@SiO2 nanoparticles and polyoxometalates, for electrically controlled fluorescence switches and sensitive detection of antioxidants in aqueous solution.198 Besides the surface conjugation of organic groups or guest molecules, the small nanoparticles can also be anchored on the surface of the UCNPs@SiO2 nanocomposites according to the surface functional groups. The Shi group reported a tri-modal imaging probe of NaY/GdF4:Yb,Er,Tm@SiO2–Au@PEG5000 nanocomposites with a uniform size (less than 50 nm) (Fig. 14).45 The as-designed nano-probes showed: (i) strong UCL ranging from Vis to NIR for fluorescence imaging, (ii) T1-weighted MRI by reducing T1 relaxation time and (iii) an enhanced Hounsfield unit (HU) value as a CT contrast agent. The structure was optimized based on a comprehensive investigation into the influence of the distance between the NaY/GdF4:Yb,Er,Tm core and Au nanoparticles at the surface by adjusting the thickness of SiO2 layers. Combined with the magnetic and UCL of the Gd3+ ion doped UCNPs, Chen et al. developed a new kind of UCNPs/MB-based PDT drug, NaYF4:Er,Yb,Gd@SiO2–MB with a diameter less than 50 nm.199 The bio-compatibility, bio-distribution, bimodal imaging, and PDT effects of the antibody-conjugated nanoparticles were systematically investigated.

As mentioned above, the “alien species” are mainly anchored on the outer surface of UCNPs@SiO2 nanocomposites, indicating that only a low amount of “alien species” is introduced due to the limited area of the outer surface of UCNPs@SiO2 nanocomposites. Taking the advantages of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in applications of delivery systems, including high surface areas, large pore volume, tunable pore sizes, good biocompatibility, and the ease of surface functionalization, the nanocomposites of UCNPs and MSNs were also developed in the past few years. The formation of mesoporous silica is nearly the same as the synthesis of dense SiO2 (as mentioned above) except the presence of the structure-directing agent (i.e. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB).187 In general, there are mainly two routes to get the nanocomposites. The first route is based on coating mesoporous silica (mSiO2) layers on the surface of UCNPs@SiO2 to form the UCNPs@SiO2@mSiO2 core@shell@shell structure (Fig. 15a).187,200–202 The second route is based on over coating with mSiO2 layer on the surface of UCNPs directly in one step (Fig. 15f).203–205 For example, Liu et al. reported the fabrication of the mSiO2 layer directly on the hydrophobic surface of UCNPs (OA capping) in the presence of a large amount of CTAB.203 In this process, CTAB serves not only as the stabilizing surfactant for transferring hydrophobic NaYF4:Tm,Yb UCNPs to the aqueous phase but also the organic template for the formation of mesoporous structures in the sol–gel reaction. The mSiO2 layer, with open mesopores, large surface areas, is immobilized on UCNPs, and can offer many sites for the accommodation of functional biomolecules or drugs onto the surface of UCNPs.

Over the past decade, much research on light controlled drug delivery and release systems has been carried out extensively because light as an external stimulus offered controllable drug release both spatially and temporally and thus exhibited great potential for further biomedical applications. Many papers have been reported on photo-responsive controlled release motifs designed based on UV excitation.206–209 However, biomedical applications prefer longer wavelength NIR light that has deep penetration into tissue and is less detrimental to healthy cells. Therefore, with the combined unique advantages of UCNPs and mSiO2, NIR-triggered guest delivery and release applications have appeared and expanded greatly in recent years.201,205,210 In 2012, Zhang et al. reported a new design to remotely active biomolecules by encapsulating photo-caged DNA/siRNA molecules into the mesochannels of mSiO2 shells of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm@mSiO2 UCNPs, which offered a high biocompatibility and more efficient loading and delivery of biomolecules in deep tissues (Fig. 25a and b).202 Lin and co-authors developed a facile methodology to construct a multifunctional anticancer drug nanocarrier by combining the special advantages of UCNPs and mSiO2. β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Yb is chosen as it can provide the dual modality of UCL and MRI.204 Then mSiO2 is directly coated onto the UCNPs to form discrete, monodisperse, highly uniform, and core@shell structured nanospheres, which are subsequently functionalized with a hydrophilic polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), to improve the colloidal stability and biocompatibility. The obtained multifunctional nanocomposites can be used as anticancer drug delivery carriers and applied for imaging. Most recently, Shi et al. have reported a general strategy for NIR light-triggered anticancer drug release based on the azobenzene (azo) modified mSiO2-coated UCNP structure.205 As shown in Fig. 16, under excitation of NIR light, the UCNPs emit photons in the UV/Vis region which can be absorbed immediately by the photo-responsive azo molecules in the mesoporous silica layer to create a continuous rotation–inversion movement. The back and forth wagging motion of the azo molecules can act as a molecular impeller that propels the release of a drug molecule.

In recent years, PDT based on the photochemical reactions mediated by the interaction of the photo-sensitizer (PS) with specific light and molecular oxygen has attracted a great deal of attention owing to its advantages of highly localized, specific tumor treatments, outpatient therapy, high cure rates, cost effectiveness, and so on. However, the PS used in conventional PDT is mostly activated by visible or even UV light, which is limited to treating tumors on or just under the skin and less effective when treating large and deep seated tumors. The use of NIR light in PDT can afford greater penetration depths than that of Vis light because the absorbance for most biomolecules reaches a minimum in the window. Therefore combined with the ability of converting NIR light to Vis photon properties of the UCNPs and high loading capacity of the mSiO2, many NIR-triggered PDT were designed based on the nanocomposites of UCNPs and mSiO2.48,199,200 The mSiO2-coated NaYF4@SiO2 nanocomposites with a core@shell@shell structure were synthesized by the Zhang Group and used for synergistic imaging and PDT of cancer cells.200 A thin layer of silica is coated onto NaYF4 UCNPs to form NaYF4@SiO2 nanoparticles and another layer of mSiO2 is further coated onto the nanoparticles to form a core@shell@shell structure. PSs are incorporated into the porous mSiO2 shells. After exposed to NIR light, the nanoparticles can convert NIR light to visible light which activates the PS to produce reactive oxygen species to kill cancer cells. The PS encapsulated in mSiO2 is protected from degradation in the harsh biological environment. Then, the same group used the mSiO2 coated UCNPs as nano-transducers to convert deeply penetrating NIR light to visible wavelengths and carriers of PSs (Fig. 17a-d).48 It is worth noting that they used the multicolor-emission capability of UCNPs at a single excitation wavelength for simultaneous activation of two PSs for enhanced PDT. The bio-regulatory molecule nitric oxide (NO) plays important roles in cancer biology and has been implicated in both tumor growth and suppression. Furthermore, NO is a γ-radiation sensitizer that can enhance selective killing of neoplastic tissues. For these reasons, our group used UCNPs to facilitate NO releasing from a precursor by 980 nm irradiation (Fig. 17e).201 The results showed that NIR-to-Vis upconversion by Yb3+/Er3+ doped NaYF4 nanocrystals could trigger photoreactions of the NO precursor, Roussin's black salt anion. It was a potential game changer in multi-photon excitation based therapeutic delivery of NO and other small molecule bio-regulators.

Thanks to the rapid development of nanotechnology, various silica based nano-drug carriers have come into being. Besides mentioned above, rattle-type (or yolk–shell) nano-capsules, which possess movable cores, porous shells and interstitial hollow spaces in between, provide an attractive nano-platform for drug delivery due to their unique hollow structure, multifunctional properties, and biological potential in the fields of nano-medicine. By a “surface-protected etching” strategy,211–213 Fan et al. fabricated the multifunctional rattle-structured (NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 UCNPs as the core, a porous silica layer as the outer shell, and a controllable internal cavity between them) nano-theranostics.214 The NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 core can serve as a magnetic/luminescent dual-mode imaging agent, the internal cavity can be used for loading of the guest molecules. Zhao et al. also demonstrated UCNPs@mSiO2 yolk–shell nanoparticles which displayed intense NIR-to-UV emission and large pore volume and loaded with hydrophobized phototrigger-conjugated drug (Fig. 18a-f).215 Most recently, the Shi group has reported the synthesis of multifunctional NaYF4:Yb,Tm @NaGdF4 core–hollow mSiO2 shell nanoparticles and their application in simultaneous NIR-triggered drug delivery and in situ quantitative drug release monitoring by both UCL and longitudinal relaxation time (T1) MRI imaging in real time (Fig. 18g-n).216

5.2 UCNPs based FRET–LRET nanocomposites
Optical sensing and assays play vital roles in theranostics due to the capability to detect and hint biochemical entities or molecular targets as well as to precisely monitor specific fundamental physiological processes. UCNPs are promising for these endeavors due to the unique frequency converting capability of biocompatible NIR light that is silent to tissues. They have the potential to reach a high detection sensitivity deeply located in the living body systems. However, UCNPs usually respond little to changes in the surroundings, because the UCL arises from 4f–4f orbital electronic transitions with concomitant wave functions localized within a single lanthanide ion. The shielding of 4f electrons by the outer complete 5s and 5p shells results in high resistance to photobleaching, photochemical degradation and other changes in chemical surrounding. Therefore, to be useful in a biochemical recognition process, UCNPs have to be used in combination with suitable recognition elements such as indicator dyes. Fortunately, energy transfer processes provide a chance to introduce an analyte-responsive chromophore as the optical detection component, and the wavelength conversion ability of UCNPs can extend the working wavelength of this chromophore from the original short wavelength region to the NIR range. The energy transduction between UCNPs and the chromophore was generally implemented by a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) or luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) mechanism. In this section, we summarized UCNPs-based FRET–LRET nanocomposites and corresponding applications in detection of ions (cyanide, mercury, etc.), sensing of small gas molecules (oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, etc.), as well as UCNP-based bioassays for biomolecules.
FRET, a mechanism describing the non-radiative and distance-dependent energy transfer between two chromophores, is a powerful tool used in several fields of science.75,217 LRET is a radiative process where light emitted by the donor is absorbed by acceptor molecules. The difference between LRET and FRET resides in that the energy transfer process in LRET is radiative, whereas it is non-radiative for FRET. When utilizing UCNPs as energy donors and the dye or quantum dots (QDs) as energy acceptors, it offers a large freedom for tuning of upconversion emission wavelengths. Indeed, Zhang et al. reported that an expanded range of multicolor emission could be obtained from the core@shell NaYF4:Yb,Er(Tm)@SiO2 nanostructures whereby organic dyes or QDs were encapsulated into the silica shells.218 For each type of lanthanide-doped UCNPs, a wide range of multiple colors can be produced through the FRET from UCNPs to the organic dyes or QDs that produce new emission colors. In nanocomposites designed for detection based on the FRET process, the distance between the energy donor and the acceptor and the spectral overlap are factors that can be controlled to influence the energy-transfer process (Fig. 19). The energy acceptor chosen for upconversion detection of nanocomposites on the basis of the FRET process should have absorption corresponding to the UCL of UCNPs. The distance between the donor and the acceptor in the FRET process should be small enough to ensure highly efficient energy transfer. The UCL is usually chosen as the detection signal, which can be turned on or off when the FRET process is turned off or on, respectively.217 Some FRET–LRET detection examples based on the UCNP nanocomposites are introduced below. Zhang et al. developed a kind of energy transfer sensor to determine Hg2+ in aqueous media in which a NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs–SYBR Green (a DNA intercalating dye function) nanocomposite is employed as a donor–acceptor pair.219 By monitoring the ratio of the acceptor emission to the donor emission, they can quantitatively detect the presence of the mercuric ions with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.06 nM. Li et al. reported on a highly selective water soluble probe for UCL sensing of intracellular Hg2+ ions, where the chromophoric ruthenium complex (N719) was labeled on the surface of NaYF4:Yb,Er,Tm nanoparticles.220 The absorption peak of N719, centered at 541 nm, matched the green UCL of UCNPs to facilitate efficient LRET from Er3+ to N719 molecules, causing quenching of the green UCL. The addition of Hg2+ can induce a blue shift of the maximum absorption wavelength of N719 from 541 to 485 nm, which decreases the spectral overlap between the green UCL and the absorption of N719, and breaks the LRET process, leading to recovery of the green UCL. The N719–UCNP nanocomposite can be applied for bioimaging of Hg2+ ions in living cells. The LOD of Hg2+ ions in water is reported to be down to 1.95 ppb (parts per billion), which is even lower than the maximum level (2 ppb) of Hg2+ in drinking water set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Using a similar principle, the Li group developed a nanocomposite composed of UCNPs (NaYF4:Yb,Er,Tm) and a CN− sensitive chromophoric iridium(III) complex Ir1 (Fig. 20a),221 and hydrophobic heptamethine cyanine dye (hCy7) modified by two long alkyl moieties and amphiphilic polymer (P-PEG)-modified UCNPs (hCy7-UCNPs) as a highly sensitive water-soluble probe for UCL monitoring and bioimaging of methyl-mercury (Fig. 20b).222

Besides the detection of hazardous ions in liquid, determination of the concentration of gas molecules such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, etc. has great significance in analytical biochemistry, clinical medical diagnosis, and bioprocess monitoring. The use of UCNPs based FRET–LRET nanocomposites for gas molecule sensing has attracted a great deal of attention because of their outstanding properties. For example, the oxygen sensor based on UCNP nanocomposites was presented by the Wolfbeis group, in which NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs as nanolamps and iridium(III) complexes as oxygen indicators were both incorporated in an ethyl cellulose thin film.223 The fluorescence of the iridium(III) complex, produced by FRET–LRET from UCNPs, is sensitive to molecular oxygen concentration, which can quantify the content of oxygen molecules. Using a similar principle, they designed NaYF4:Yb,Er–bromothymol blue (BTB) nanocomposites and NaYF4:Yb,Er–phenol red nanocomposites to determine carbon dioxide, and ammonia, respectively. The LOD is measured to be about 0.11% for CO2 and 400 μM for ammonia.224,225
As a good case of the combination of diagnosis and therapy by using the UCNPs based FRET nanocomposites, Xing et al. designed a personalized NIR light-activated nano-platform by combining a photo-activatable Pt(IV) prodrug and a caspase imaging peptide conjugated with silica-coated UCNPs for the remote control of anti-tumor platinum prodrug activation, and simultaneously for real-time imaging of apoptosis induced by activated cytotoxicity by using the FRET effect of the nanocomposites.226 Upon NIR light irradiation, the converted emission from UCNPs@SiO2 could locally activate the Pt(IV) prodrug and thus efficiently induce potent anti-tumor cytotoxcity in both cisplatin-sensitive and resistant tumor cells. Moreover, such NIR light-controlled tumor inactivation can trigger the cellular apoptosis and the highly activated caspase could cleave the NIR imaging peptide probe from the nanoparticle surface, thus greatly turning on the quenched NIR fluorescence of Cy5. These systematic studies indicated that the Pt(IV) probe UCNPs@SiO2 could not only provide a promising strategy to remotely control the localized activation of the Pt(IV) prodrug at the target tumor sites, but more importantly, the developed Pt(IV) probe UCNPs@SiO2 conjugates may serve as personalized tumor markers to image in real time and evaluate the anti-tumor therapy at the cellular level.
5.3 Inorganic nanocrystals functionalized UCNP nanocomposites
The rapid development in nanotechnology has allowed the engineering of various functional nanomaterials with multiple discrete function-related components integrated in one nanoparticle for applications in multimodality bio-applications to circumvent the limitations of each single mode application. So in this section, we describe some potentially useful designs and applications of UCNP–nanocrystal multifunctional nanocomposites, such as UCNPs–magnetic nanoparticles (UCNPs–MNPs), UCNP–metal and UCNP–semiconductor nanocomposites etc., which have been attracting increased research attention because of their easily accessible multifunctional properties.

5.3.1 UCNP–MNP multifunctional nanocomposites. 
Conventional chemotherapy is commonly used in the clinical management of many cancers, often with severe side effects due to the cytotoxicity of the agents and genetic heterogeneity of tumors, that is, their phenotypic drug sensitivity or resistivity.227 Nano-engineered drug-delivery systems could improve the clinical performance of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and reduce overall toxicity by enhancing the specificity of the drug's delivery through tumor targeting and making elevated local dosages possible.228 A major goal in nano-medicine is the coherent implementation of multifunctional platforms within a single targeted nano-delivery system that would simultaneously perform diagnosis, targeted delivery and efficient therapy (theranostics).229,230 Along these lines, luminescent and MNPs have been used as bio-labeling, contrast agents, and for MRI and targeted drug delivery, leading recently to major advances in bio-applications.229,230 As one of the most important members in the luminescence materials family, the fabrication of UCNPs–MNPs multifunctional nanocomposites attract much attention due to the unique properties of UCNPs.33,231–234 Our group fabricated nanorattles consisting of hydrophilic lanthanide doped NaYF4 shells each containing a loose magnetic nanoparticle with the aid of the intermediate layer of SiO2.231 This multi-functional mesoporous nanostructure with both UCL and magnetic properties has excellent water dispersibility and a high drug-loading capacity. As shown in Fig. 21, the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized from monodispersed Fe3O4 nanocrystals with ∼20 nm in diameter as a core, using a reverse micro-emulsion method. Due to the presence of a SiO2 layer, a layer of Y,Yb,Er(OH)CO3·H2O is easily deposited on the Fe3O4@SiO2 nanospheres via a homogeneous precipitation method. After the thermal treatment at high temperature and the flowing ion-exchange process, the multifunctional Fe3O4@SiO2@α-NaYF4,Yb,Er UCNP–MNP nanocomposites can be obtained. The material emits visible UCL upon NIR excitation and can be directed by an external magnetic field to a specific target, making it an attractive system for a variety of biological applications. Measurements on cells incubated with the nanorattles show that they have low cytotoxicity and excellent cell imaging properties. In vivo experiments yield highly encouraging tumor shrinkage with the anti-tumor drug and significantly enhance tumor targeting in the presence of an applied magnetic field. Cheng et al. described a novel class of multifunctional UCNP–MNP–Au nanocomposites.33 The nanocomposites were prepared by layer-by-layer self-assembly (Fig. 22). Ultra small super-paramagnetic dopamine (DA) modified Fe3O4 MNPs are adsorbed on the surface of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-modified NaYF4 based UCNPs by electrostatic attraction to form a UCNPs–MNPs complex, on top of which a thin gold shell is formed by seed-induced reduction growth. The layer of MNPs between UCNPs and the Au shell not only affords magnetic properties but also significantly reduces the luminescence quenching effects of the gold nanostructure on UCNPs. The multifunctional UCNP–MNP–Au nanocomposites are then coated by PEG to impart stability to physiological solutions used for in vitro targeted UCL, MRI and dark-field light scattering imaging. The surface plasmon resonance absorption contributed by the gold shell is utilized for dual-targeted photo-thermal ablation of cancer cells. Shen and co-workers reported the Fe3O4–NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNP–MNP nanocomposite synthesized by a ligand anchoring strategy (Fig. 5).234 Fe3O4 nanoparticles are localized at the surface of UCNPs assisted by cross linkers. Compared with other chemical linkage methods for hybrid nano-structures, this cross linker anchoring strategy comprises the ligand exchange process, crystallization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and integration into UCNP–MNP nanocomposites in a sequential one-pot reaction. The process is facile and effective for the construction of multifunctional nanocomposites in a solvothermal system. This approach is not limited by lattice mismatch for different functional components, and is applicable to QDs and noble metal nanoparticles, etc. The obtained UCNP–MNP nanocomposites can well preserve the UCL and room-temperature super-paramagnetism, which enable both effective optical detection and magnetic trapping. Most recently, Chen et al. have developed a new method to synthesize PEGylated UCNP–MNP nanocomposites with an iron oxide core and a luminescent shell of uniform thickness with the assistance of a polyelectrolyte.235

5.3.2 UCNP–metal nanocomposites. 
It is well known that metal nanostructures (i.e. plasmonic substrates) can efficiently collect light and enhance the intensity due to surface plasmon resonances (SPR). These effects have been widely used for enhancing various optical processes, such as Raman scattering and downconversion luminescence.236–240 So in this section we focus on the fabrication of UCNP–metal nanocomposites, which is an important way to enhance the UCL according to the SPR effect of metals.241–253 The optical properties of a photoluminescence material positioned in close proximity to colloidal metal nanoparticles are affected by the near field electrodynamical environment.254 The modified fields cause an enhancement or quenching of the photoluminescence relative to the native state, which depends sensitively on the distance between the luminescent material and the metal surface. A judicious balance of two factors needs to be worked out for plasmonic modulation of luminescence. Quenching predominantly would occur if the luminescent nanoparticle is brought into contact with the metallic surface directly. Conversely, the enhancement of the luminescence occurs upon moving the nanoparticle away from the metal surface and is maximized at some critical distance. The guiding principle is that the luminescence efficiency of the nanoparticles can be enhanced by tuning the SPR peak to the excitation/emission wavelength. Recently, a number of nanostructured systems of metal-cores, spacer molecules and photoluminescence materials have been examined. The distance dependency of photoluminescence enhancement and quenching has so far been observed with organic dyes,254 QDs,255 and rare-earth complexes with organic molecules,256 polyelectrolytes254 or silica255 as spacers. In 2010, we reported a facile method to fabricate metal core enhanced Er3+ doped UCNPs based on a core@spacer@shell approach. Ag@SiO2@Y2O3:Er nanocomposites with different SiO2 spacer thickness were synthesized (Fig. 23).257 We found that the UCL enhancements or quenching was dependent on the dielectric silica spacer thickness. The average photoluminescence intensity could reach a maximum value of 4 times that from the pure Y2O3:Er shell at an optimal spacer thickness of 30 nm. Almost at the same time, the Duan group reported a new approach for the modulation of UCL through plasmonic interactions between UCNPs and gold nano-structures.242 The attachment of gold nanoparticles onto UCNPs can more than double the UCL intensity. The quantitative analysis of the confocal images showed that an intensity enhancement factor of approximately 2.6 could be achieved. This enhancement is at least partly attributed to surface-plasmon-coupled emission, which can increase the radiative decay rate and emission efficiency. Interestingly, they also found that the formation of a gold shell could significantly suppress the emission because of considerable scattering of excitation irradiation.

The SPR peaks of the above introduced metal nanoparticles are confined to the visible region at around 500–550 nm, which overlap with the green emission and therefore a selective enhancement occurs for this emission peak only. Although gold nanoshells have been coated on the nanocrystals by the Duan group, it greatly suppressed the emission from the nanocrystals due to the strong scattering of the excitation irradiation. It is predicted that simultaneous enhancement for all the upconversion emission peaks can be achieved if the SPR peak is tuned to the NIR region and made resonant with the absorption of UCNPs at 980 nm thereby substantially increasing the excitation flux via a local field enhancement effect. Recently, Priyam et al. have reported a poly-(amino acid) templated gold nanoshell encapsulation of silica coated NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNPs and tuned the SPR peaks in a wide wavelength range from the visible to NIR region with a highly intense single plasmon peak. The luminescence was dramatically transformed from quenching into an enhancement effect.252 The photoluminescence intensities of the three upconversion emission peaks at 660 (red), 545 (green) and 410 nm (blue) can be enhanced for 2.1, 2.6 and 3.3 times, respectively.
It has been demonstrated that UCL can be enhanced not only by the metal nanoparticles but also by plasmonic metal microarrays (Fig. 24). Most recently, Zhang et al. have investigated a plasmon-enhanced UCL of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals on a 3D plasmonic antenna architecture, the disk-coupled dots-on-pillar antenna array (D2PA) (Fig. 24b).258 They optimized the D2PA structure by tuning the pillar height (h), and consequently the resonance frequency of the substrate, and found that, when h = 75 nm, the resonance frequency matched the pumping laser's frequency and the enhancement factor of UCL reached its maximum, 310 fold. Furthermore, Kagan and co-workers demonstrated amplification of luminescence for hexagonal NaYF4 doped with Yb3+, Er3+ or Yb3+, Tm3+ by close proximity to metal nanoparticles (Fig. 24a).241 They present a configuration in which close-packed monolayers of UCNPs were separated from a dense multilayer of metal nanoparticles (Au or Ag) by a nanometer scale oxide. Metal-enhanced UCL was found to be dependent on the thickness of the oxide spacer layer and the type of metal nanoparticles with enhancements of up to 5.2 fold proximal to Au and of up to 45 fold proximal to Ag nanoparticles.

5.3.3 UCNP–semiconductor nanocomposites. 
Over the past few years, a lot of efforts have been made for the fabrication and control of size and shape of semiconductor nanostructures, because of their importance in catalysis, electronics, photonics, optoelectronics, sensing, and potential applications in nano-devices. One of the most important characteristics of semiconductors is the ability to absorb the light with a specific range of wavelengths, which is corresponding to their band gap. The absorbed light can be converted to electricity, luminescence, or heat. Combined with the unique optical properties of UCNPs, some UCNP–semiconductor nanocomposites have been developed to extend the potential applications of UCNPs.
Xiao et al. constructed a multifunctional core–satellite nanocomposite by decorating ultra-small CuS semiconductor nanoparticles onto the surface of silica-coated UCNPs (Fig. 25a-e).259 The nanocomposite could not only convert NIR light into heat for effective thermal ablation but also induce a highly localized radiation dose boost to trigger substantially enhanced radiation damage both in vitro and in vivo. With the synergistic interaction between photothermal ablation and the enhanced radiotherapy, the tumor could be eradicated without visible recurrence in 120 days. Moreover, the novel nanocomposite facilitates excellent UCL/MRI/CT tri-modal imaging. Yan and co-authors prepared a new nanocomposite, CdSe/NaYF4:Yb,Er, that up-converts NIR photons and uses the created exciton to generate charge carriers in CdSe-based films, leading to a reversible and stable NIR photoconductivity switch (Fig. 25f and g).260 The Liu group reported a novel design, based on a combination of lanthanide-doped UCNPs and MnO2 semiconductor nanosheets, for rapid, selective detection of glutathione in aqueous solutions and living cells.261 In this approach, MnO2 nanosheets formed on the surface of UCNPs serve as efficient quenchers for UCL. The UCL can be turned on by introducing glutathione that reduces MnO2 into Mn2+. The ability to monitor the glutathione concentration intracellularly may enable rational design of a convenient platform for targeted drug and gene delivery.

For conventional solar cells, one of the major energy loss mechanisms is the transmission of sub-bandgap photons. The use of upconversion materials provides a solution to the transmission loss by converting two sub-bandgap photons into one above-bandgap photon. Indeed, UCNPs have been coupled to a wide range of solar cells including crystalline Si,262 amorphous Si thin-film,263 organic,264 and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).265 Su et al. demonstrated a new method to utilize UCNPs in a hetero-nanostructured photo anode for enhanced NIR light harvesting.266 They showed that upconversion is responsible for the observed photo-response upon NIR exposure. This is the first demonstration of photo-electrochemical electrodes with UCNPs embedded in porous photonic crystals. The interconnected pores of the photonic crystals render the nanoparticles spatially positioned in close proximity to CdSe quantum dots, leading to an enhanced energy transfer and light harvesting. This proof-of-concept is highly applicable to other types of solar cells such as thin-film, liquid-junction and organic solar cells where infrared photons with sub-bandgap energies can be harvested for improved photon-to-electricity conversion efficiency by broadening the spectral response. Most recently, Zhao and co-workers have designed and employed a highly uniform core–double-shell structured β-NaYF4:Er,Yb@SiO2@TiO2 hexagonal sub-microprisms and employed in DSSCs internally for the first time (Fig. 26).267 These sub-microprisms can act as effective scattering centers to enhance the light harvesting. By coating with the amorphous SiO2 insulating layer around the β-NaYF4:Er,Yb UCNPs, the electron trapping and capture caused by surface defects and ligands of bare β-NaYF4:Er,Yb crystals can be thoroughly avoided. At a certain mixing mass ratio of 10%, an efficiency of 8.65% was obtained, which was 120% higher than that of a device based on bare NaYF4:Er,Yb crystals and an enhancement of about 10.9% was achieved when compared to the reference cell. Then, they also used the same double-shell β-NaYF4:Yb,Er@SiO2@TiO2 sub-microplates as scattering and upconverting layers for DSSCs. Due to their effective light scattering and upconverting effects, the performance of DSSCs was significantly enhanced, resulting in an efficiency of 7.70%, which is a noticeable improvement of ∼29.41% compared to the cell without the bifunctional layer (5.95%).268

6. Conclusions and perspectives
In this paper, we summarized recent progress in UCNPs, including excitation and emission energy levels guided designing of UCNP nanostructure, the synthesis techniques to fabricate the nanostructure with optimum energy level structure, the fabrication of UCNPs-based nanocomposites to extend the working range of UCNPs by introducing the additional functional component, or integrating the additional functional moiety into one nanocomposite.
Despite the UCNPs have attracted a great deal of attention in a wide range of applications due to their unique optical and chemical properties, practical applications of UCNPs set demanding requirements on their optical properties, size, surface chemistry, as well as their ability to incorporate with “alien species”. New advancements in diverse aspects are needed to make rapid progress in this field to fulfill requirements of the practical applications. So, we would like to highlight some future directions that can produce pronounced effects in the field. Firstly, the brightness of UCNPs is still unsatisfactory, in particular, under a low excitation density of 10−2–10−1 W cm−2. Manipulation of the local environment around the lanthanide dopants by delicate designing and optimizing of the structure of the UCNPs may be a promising direction to enhance the quantum yield. Through the development of UCNPs, the structures of the nanoparticles become more and more advanced, ingenious. Thus the structure, especially the core@shell structure, becomes more and more complicated, indicating that the traditional synthesis method hardly fulfils the practical needs. So the second anticipation is the development of the new synthesis approach which can fulfill the requirements for the fabrication of complicated multi-shell structured UCNPs. Last but not the least, most of the equipment used to characterise the optical properties of UCNPs are based on the home-made instruments. Standard measurement facilities and protocols are highly required to allow the quantitative comparison of optical properties.
