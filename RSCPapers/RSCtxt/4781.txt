    , Accepted 6th September 2018First published on 7th September 2018AbstractA suitable electron transport material (ETM) plays key roles in efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs), because it is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport at the interface thus increasing the short circuit current density. Based on the experimentally reported efficient electron transport molecule 10,14-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c][1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-i]phenazine (TDTP), we theoretically design a set of new ETMs (TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, TDTP-2b, TDTP-3a, and TDTP-3b) by introducing a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring or replacing a hydrogen atom on the methyl with an amino group. Quantum-chemical calculations reveal that the designed molecules behave much better than TDTP in terms of electron mobility, air stability, and solubility, where the electron mobility of TDTP-3b is two orders of magnitude higher than that of TDTP owing to the extra S⋯N interactions in TDTP-3b that lead to the quasi two-dimensional π packing motif which facilitates electron transport evidently. Moreover, we find that the substitution effect of the nitrogen atom strongly depends on the position, where the nitrogen atom at the β-position of the thiophene ring (TDTP-2b and TDTP-3b) is more conducive to electron transport. Importantly, our calculations show that the ETM/perovskite interface interaction is enhanced after the introduction of the nitrogen atom and amino group thanks to the added N⋯Pb interaction, which favors electron transport with the newly designed ETMs. Our results not only report a set of novel promising ETMs, but also provide a useful design strategy for efficient ETMs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been advancing at an unprecedented pace with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22% after only nine years.1–3 The device can be divided into two types, the conventional (n-i-p) and inverted (p-i-n) configurations depending on which selective contact is used on the bottom (p, i, and n refer to p-type, undoped intrinsic, and n-type semiconductors in these configurations, respectively).4 The inverted structured PSCs with a sandwich-like structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL)/metal have been recently attracting increasing attention.5–7
Compared to the impressive progress on hole transporting materials, the pace of developing suitable ETMs lags far behind.8,9 A suitable ETM for PSCs should fulfill the following requirements: (1) good energy alignment between the perovskite materials and electrode; (2) high electron mobility; (3) easy dissolution in an organic solvent, and (4) good stability in air.10,11 Compared to employing conventional inorganic materials as ETMs like TiO2, the use of organic materials as ETMs has many specific advantages such as low solution-processing temperature,12 easy fabrication process,13 compatibility with flexible substrates,14 and negligible hysteresis.15 In addition, organic ETMs have prominent charge extraction properties, which are helpful to prevent the recombination of carriers at the perovskite/ETL interface.16,17 Fullerene and its derivatives (i.e. (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) have been used as ETMs to fabricate the inverted PSC devices because of their low temperature fabrication, suitable energy level alignment, and decent electron mobility.18 However, there are some inherent drawbacks in fullerene-based ETMs, such as easy absorption of oxygen or water onto the surface leading to degradation, easy aggregation, and high price, which limit their further applications.19–21
Recently a variety of endeavors have been directed at finding novel small organic molecules as ETMs, thanks to their tunable optoelectronic properties and simplicity in synthesis and purification.22,23 Troshin and co-workers reported that replacing PCBM with perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives as ETMs can remarkably improve the operational stability without sacrificing the photovoltaic performance.24 The Jen group used hexaazatrinaphthylene as an ETM and acquired a high PCE of 17.6%.25 Zhang et al. pushed up the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells to 18.2%, with the n-type sulfur-containing azaacene molecule TDTP as the ETL, despite its low electron mobility.26 The improved performance was ascribed to strong interaction between TDTP and the perovskite surface, possibly mediated by the thiophene–iodine or thiophene–Pb interaction.27,28 It is well known that electron mobility is closely related with short circuit current density and fill factor.29,30 An ETM with higher electron mobility is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport at the interface of the perovskite and ETL.31
In addition, nitrogen-containing semiconductor materials have drawn much attention due to their superior and tunable properties.32–35 For instance, introducing nitrogen atoms into the backbone of pentacenes led to soluble and stable N-heteropentacenes with high field-effect mobility.36,37 Moreover, both photovoltaic performance and moisture stability of perovskite solar cells were evidently improved by crystal surface modification with bifunctional ammonium cations.38 Furthermore, previous studies reported that the introduction of nitrogen into the ETM is beneficial for enhancing the ETM/MAPbI3 interaction and improving the PCE.39–42
On the theoretical side, great efforts have been devoted on the hole transport properties and provided valuable instructions for designing new HTMs,43–46 but there are very few studies on the electron transport properties of the small organic ETMs for PSCs. There is a huge demand to reveal the relationship between the electronic structure and microscopic electron transport properties, which is beneficial for designing new ETMs with high mobility and further increasing the PCE.
In this work, the structure and electron transport properties of TDTP were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and the Marcus theory. Subsequently, five TDTP derivatives (see Fig. 1) were designed based on the above guidelines by introducing an amino group at the terminal of the side chain (TDTP-1), or a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring (TDTP-2a with a N atom at the α position and TDTP-2b with a N atom at the β position), or both an amino group at the terminal and a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring (TDTP-3a and TDTP-3b). Theoretical analysis demonstrates that all the five designed TDTP-based ETMs exhibit enhanced electron mobility, air stability, and solubility compared to TDTP, where the electron mobility of TDTP-3b is up to 1.28 cm2 V−1 s−1, two orders of magnitude higher than that of TDTP. In addition, our calculations show that the ETM/perovskite interface interaction is enhanced with the newly designed ETMs. The obtained results are expected to be instructive for further designing of high performance ETMs for PSCs.

Theoretical and computational method
The hopping mechanism, in which the charge carriers likely localize on a molecule and the charge randomly jumps between neighboring molecules, has proved to be successful in describing the organic semiconductor transporting mechanism.47–49 The Marcus-type expression is an appropriate choice and has been widely used to predict the carrier mobility.50 The carrier mobility was evaluated by the Einstein–Smoluchowski relation without an electric field:47  where e is the electron charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and D represents the diffusion coefficient and can be expressed as:51  where n is the spatial dimension which equals to 3 for the crystal; i represents a specific hopping pathway; di is the electron hopping centroid to centroid distance; ki is the hopping rate in a specific hopping pathway i; and pi is the relative probability for the charge carrier hopping to a particular ith pathway which is calculated as  Based on the Marcus theory the electron hopping rate (ki) can be evaluated by52  where h denotes the Planck constant, λ is the reorganization energy, and v is the transfer integral.
The inner reorganization energy can be estimated by the adiabatic potential energy surface approach:53λ = λ1 + λ1 = E±(QN) − E±(Q±) + EN(Q±) − EN(QN)where the subscripts N, +, and − denote the neutral, cationic, and anionic electronic state, respectively.
The transfer integral (v) measures the strength of electronic coupling between adjacent molecules, and can be estimated by the direct approach:54v = 〈φiHOMO/LUMO|F|φfHOMO/LUMO〉where φHOMO/LUMO represents the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the isolated molecules 1 and 2 in the dimer, respectively, and F is the Fock operator of the dimer.
We used a quantum chemical method that combines density functional theory (DFT) with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) to calculate the LUMO energy levels. The ground-state geometries were optimized across different functionals. The TDDFT was used to simulate the excitation energies with the same functional settings as used in the optimization of ground-state geometries. And the conductor like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) was taken into consideration in the dichloromethane solvent.55 The calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.56
As for the crystal structure, firstly the single molecules were optimized in Dmol3 with the accuracy setting in fine; at the same time the electrostatic potential and population analysis was carried out. Next the crystal structure prediction was carried out by employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation energy functional and the Dreiding force field. Five most probable space groups (P21/C, P1, P2121, P21 and P2/c) were restricted. This part was done in the polymorph module, which has been proved as a useful method in predicting the crystal structure.57,58 Then the crystal structure with the lowest energies was selected and optimized in the Dmol3 module with the 10−5 accuracy setting. The above calculations were done by using Materials Studio.59 Based on the obtained crystal structures, the transfer integral was computed by the M06-2X/6-31G (d, p) method, which has been proved to be good in describing the non-covalent interaction.60
The ETM/perovskite interface was investigated with the GGA-PBE functional61 on the VASP software.62 In the calculations, we chose the 110-perovskite surface in the tetragonal phase for comparing our results on TDTP derivatives with a previous report26 on TDTP where the optimized configuration was a TDTP molecule adsorbed on the 110-perovskite surface. A 20 Å vacuum region was added, which is enough for this study. The valence wave functions were expanded by plane waves with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Geometries were relaxed until a residual force less than 0.05 eV Å−1 per atom. Dispersion corrections were considered using the empirical formula by Grimme et al.63
Results and discussion
Assessment of the computational method
For ETMs, a preliminary requirement is the suitable LUMO energy level (ELUMO) that ensures effective electron extraction without an energy barrier. Besides, the ELUMO is also the key factor for the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the device which is relative to the difference between the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) of HTMs and the ELUMO of ETMs.64
It is well known that the EHOMO and ELUMO strongly depend on the employed functionals in DFT calculations.65 In order to obtain a reliable method, the ELUMO of TDTP was calculated by using six popular functionals (B3LYP, PBE1PBE, MPW1B95, PBE33, PBE38, and MPWB1K) with a broad range of HF exchange ratios (from 20% to 43%) combined with the 6-31+G (d, p) basis set. We can see that in Fig. 2, the computed ELUMO values decrease obviously with increasing HF exchange in the range of 20–43%. Specifically, the ELUMO value obtained by using PBE33 (−4.04 eV) is in very good agreement with the experimental result (−4.03 eV). So the PBE33 functional with the 6-31+G (d, p) basis set was chosen hereafter to compute the ELUMO of TDTP-based ETMs.

Geometric and electronic structures
Geometric and electronic structures exert important influences on intramolecular electrostatic potential distribution and intermolecular interaction, and play a key role in determining stacking motifs in the solid phase.66 To explore the substitution effects on the molecular backbone structure, the selected bond length changes (BLC = Rmolecule − RTDTP) between the designed molecules and TDTP are shown in Fig. 3 and Table ESI2† (the coordinates and energies of the studied compounds are listed in the ESI†). Generally speaking, the obtained BLC values are close to zero except those of bonds 9, 13, and 14 adjacent to the substituents in TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a. In addition, the sum of the BLC values ∑|ΔR| is small, which is 0.005, 0.028, 0.014, 0.032, and 0.014 Å for TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, TDTP-2b, TDTP-3a, and TDTP-3b, respectively. These results imply that the introduced nitrogen atom has an insignificant impact on the bond lengths of the molecular backbone, especially in the case of the nitrogen atom substituted at the β-position of the thiophene ring.

Meanwhile, we noticed that there is evident difference in the twist angle (θ, see the inset of Fig. 4 for the illustration) of the thiophene or thiazole ring with respect to the main backbone plane among TDTP and the investigated derivatives. As shown in Fig. 4, TDTP exhibits good π-conjugation character with a twist angle of about 26°. There are no big changes in the θ values in the case of the nitrogen atom substituted at the β-position of the thiophene ring (24° in TDTP-2b and 27° in TDTP-3b), whereas the substitution of the nitrogen atom at the α-position leads to an obvious increase in the twist angle, which is 41° in TDTP-2a and 43° in TDTP-3a resulting from the strong repulsion of the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atoms in thiazole and thiadiazole where the related N⋯N distance is about 2.9 Å evidently smaller than that of about 4.2 Å in TDTP-2b and TDTP-3b (see Fig. ESI1†).

These results demonstrate that the introduction of a nitrogen atom at the β-position of the ring tends to maintain the rigid structure. As a result, TDTP-2b and TDTP-3b with more planar geometries are expected to be better at electron transport than TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a.
The EHOMO and ELUMO of the six investigated molecules were calculated at the PBE33/6-31+G(d, p) level and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table ESI3,† where the dashed lines in Fig. 5 indicate the eigenvalues of the conduction band (CBM) and valence band (VBM) of MAPbI3, and the work function of LiF/Al since Al is usually employed as the electrode metal that conducts with the ETL. It is vital for ETMs to have a proper ELUMO that matches well with the active layers to aid effective electron extraction, as well as an appropriate EHOMO that is low enough to block the undesirable hole transport. As shown in Fig. 5, the CBM and VBM of MAPbI3 are at −3.9 eV and −5.4 eV and the work function of LiF/Al is −4.2 eV (see ref. 26); so the ELUMO of an ideal ETM should lie between −4.2 and −3.9 eV and its EHOMO should be lower than −5.4 eV.26 Based on this instruction, we can see that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the studied six molecules meet this requirement since their ELUMO lies in the range of −4.2 to −4.0 eV and the EHOMO lies below −5.6 eV (see Fig. 5 and Table ESI3†). The introduction of an electron-donating amino group67 leads to a slight increase (0.01–0.04 eV) of the ELUMO, for instance, TDTP-1 (−4.02 eV) > TDTP (−4.05 eV), TDTP-3a (−4.20 eV) > TDTP-2a (−4.21 eV), TDTP-3b (−4.15 eV) > TDTP-2b (−4.19 eV). In the case of adding a nitrogen atom on the thiophene ring, which results in a thiazole ring with strong electron-withdrawing ability,68 the ELUMO clearly goes down by 0.1–0.2 eV. In addition, the ELUMO of TDTP-2a (−4.21 eV) and TDTP-3a (−4.20 eV) with a nitrogen atom at the α-position of the ring is slightly lower than that of TDTP-2b (−4.19 eV) and TDTP-3b (−4.15 eV) with a nitrogen atom at the β-position. As it is well known, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the inverted PSCs approximately equals the difference between the EHOMO of HTMs and the ELUMO of ETMs. Thus, the VOC values of the devices using TDTP-2b and TDTP-3b as ETMs are expected to be higher than those employing their isomers TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a as ETMs.

The shape of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) is one of the key factors to illustrate the carrier transport properties. The plots of the FMOs of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 6. We can see that the HOMO of the molecules is mainly located on the [1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-i]quinoxaline and thiophene moiety, while the LUMO is almost delocalized over the entire molecule suggesting that these molecules are more conducive to electron transfer than hole transfer. Therefore, it is clear that introducing a nitrogen atom on the thiophene or amino group at the side chain has little influence on the shape of the FMO.

Transport properties
For ETMs, the transport capacity is the most important property. The values of the reorganization energy (λ, eV), centroid to centroid distance (d, Å), electron transfer integral (v, eV), electron hopping rate (ki, s−1), and average electron mobility (μ, cm2 V−1 s−1) for the six investigated molecules are presented in Table 1. The computed μ values are 0.023 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.071 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.081 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.433 cm2 V−1 s−1, 0.148 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.280 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TDTP, TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, TDTP-2b, TDTP-3a, and TDTP-3b, respectively. It is worthwhile to mention that there is a two orders of magnitude increase in μ from TDTP to TDTP-3b. The sequence of μ (TDTP-3b > TDTP-2b > TDTP-3a > TDTP-2a > TDTP-1 > TDTP) indicates that the modified TDTP derivatives may be more efficient ETMs than TDTP. Furthermore, we can see that both introducing a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring and attaching an amino group on the side chain are effective for improving μ, and the two approaches display synergistic effects. Moreover, the μ values of TDTP-3b and TDTP-2b increase by approximately one order of magnitude compared to those of TDTP-3a and TDTP-2a, indicating that the different substitution positions of the nitrogen atom in the thiophene ring have unequal effects on the charge transfer property.

Then we explore the possible reasons for the evident difference in μ between TDTP and its nitrogen-containing derivatives. According to the Marcus theory, the reorganization energy and transfer integral are two key parameters governing the intrinsic charge-transport rate.52 The reorganization energy (λ) mainly originates from the geometrical relaxation during the charge transfer process and reflects the barriers from one molecule to another.69 The reorganization energy consists of an external reorganization energy and an internal reorganization energy. In organic crystals, the external reorganization energy is significantly lower than the internal reorganization energy, so the external part is ignored in this work.70,71 The inner reorganization energies were calculated by using the B3LYP functional, which proved to be a satisfactory method in organic systems.72–75 The obtained reorganization energies (λ values) of the investigated molecules are listed in Table 1. We can see that the λ value of TDTP is 0.19 eV, while the λ values of the nitrogen substituted derivatives lie in the range of 0.21–0.24 eV. The λ values of TDTP-2b and TDTP-3b are slightly smaller (0.01 eV) than those of TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a. As a result, the difference in the reorganization energy is too small to be the main reason for the evident difference in the electron mobility of the investigated TDTP and its nitrogen-substituted derivatives.
Then we turned to the other possible factor, the transfer integral, which strongly depends on the relative position of the interacting molecules and the overlapping degree of their frontier molecular orbitals. Fig. 7 depicts the main charge-hopping channels in the predicted crystal structures of TDTP and the designed molecules. As shown in Fig. 7, the packing modes of the investigated molecules can be classified into three categories: herringbone packing (TDTP, TDTP-2a, and TDTP-3a), one-dimensional (1D) π packing (TDTP-1 and TDTP-2b), and quasi two-dimensional (2D) π packing (TDTP-3b).76 Apparently, the packing modes can be sensitively tuned by using various substituents. Electrostatic potential (ESP) is widely used to visualize and understand the reasons for the change of crystal packing.77,78 As shown in Fig. 8, the ESP of TDTP shows negative potentials in the 2,9-phenanthroline part, almost neutral electrostatic potential in the other side of the molecular backbone, and positive potential in the side-chains, because the nitrogen atom is an electron donor moiety compared to the carbon atom. Accordingly, the interaction between the negative potential and the positive potential may appear in the 2,9-phenanthroline part of the molecular backbone and the side chains. Such non-covalent electrostatic interactions explain why TDTP packs in the face-edge (herringbone) pattern in the crystal structure. The large centroid to centroid distance (4.02 Å) indicates a very weak interaction between adjacent molecules, which results in a small transfer integral and mobility. In TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a, the negative potentials locate on the 2,9-phenanthroline part and around the γ-position side, while the positive potentials locate on the lateral sides of the molecules. To maximize electrostatic attraction and minimize electrostatic repulsion, the nitrogen atom on the α-position may interact with the lateral sides forming herringbone stacking. The negative potentials increase with a sequence of TDTP-3a > TDTP-2a > TDTP, which is consistent with their mobility trend.

TDTP-
1 and TDTP-2b adopt 1D π-packing. We find that the negative electrostatic potential region decreases in the side chains of TDTP-1 and TDTP-2b compared to that of TDTP, TDTP-2a and TDTP-3a, which leads to the reduced interaction between the molecular backbone and the side chains. Meanwhile, the interaction between the 2,9-phenanthroline part (molecular backbone) and the 1,2,5-thiadiazole part (molecular backbone) increases, resulting in 1D π-packing. It is well recognized that the intermolecular distance between neighboring molecules is an important parameter for investigating the transport properties.79,80 The centroid to centroid distances of the major hopping pathways have a sequence of TDTP-1 (3.81 Å) > TDTP-2b (3.71 Å) in accordance with that of the mobility TDTP-1 (0.071 cm2 V−1 s−1) < TDTP-2b (0.433 cm2 V−1 s−1).
In TDTP-3b, the ESP picture in Fig. 8 shows that the negative potential mainly appears on the nitrogen atom of the 2,9-phenanthroline of the molecular skeleton, while the positive potentials appear at the other end of the skeleton (1,2,5-thiadiazole part) and the thiazole ring of the side chain. Therefore, the multiple electrostatic interactions between the adjacent molecules, in the same layer or the neighboring layers, especially the strong S⋯N interactions with an intermolecular S⋯N distance of 3.4 Å (see Fig. ESI2†), lead to a quasi 2D π packing pattern. This also explains why path 4 (ki = 1.65 × 1013 s−1) of TDTP-3b contributes the most to the mobility although the centroid to centroid distance of this path is very large (11.49 Å).
Stability and solubility
For the structure of inverted PSCs, the electron transport layer is the topmost layer exposed to ambient air except for the metal electrode.81 A good ETM has to be stable enough against oxygen and water, and can enhance the water resistance of the perovskite devices.82 Adiabatic electron affinity (EAa) is directly relevant to the anionic species stability toward the reaction with oxygen and water in air. Chao et al. studied 47 existing n-channel organic semiconductors and found that the EAa of air stable n-channel organic semiconductor materials should reach 2.8 eV at least.83 As shown in Table 2, the EAa value of TDTP is 3.79 eV and it remains almost unchanged for TDTP-1 at 3.78 eV. Meanwhile, the EAa values (3.90–3.93 eV) of the other four molecules are higher than that of TDTP, meaning that they are quite stable when exposed to air as n-type materials. In addition, the stability of an organic semiconductor can be predicted by absolute hardness (η), which is the resistance of the chemical potential to the change in the number of electrons. η can be described as: η = (IPa − EAa)/2, where IPa represents the adiabatic ionization potential.84,85 As shown in Table 2, the η values of the newly designed TDTP derivatives (0.70–0.86 eV) are larger than that of TDTP (0.69 eV), indicating that nitrogen substitution improves the stability. Alternatively, it was found that the improved stability of a device using small organic molecules compared to that using PCBM may arise from the fact that small organic ETMs are inclined to form a close packing pattern due to the stronger intermolecular interactions.20,86 The degree of close packing is reflected in the material density (ρ, g cm−3), which is listed in Table 2 for the studied ETMs. We can see that the density of TDTP-1 is slightly smaller than that of TDTP, while those of the other four designed compounds are larger, suggesting good device stability using the designed ETMs.

Besides stability, the solubility of ETMs in organic solvents is another important factor that should be considered for the desirable solution-based fabrication of PVSC devices that could be easily scaled up for industrial production. The solubility can be estimated by the solvation free energy (ΔGsolv), which is defined as the difference in free energy of the solute in the solution and gas phases.87 The more negative the solvation free energy, the more soluble the material. In the present work, we evaluated the solubility of the studied molecules in 1,2-dichlorobenzene because this solvent was employed for TDTP experimentally.26 In Table 2, we can see that the ΔGsolv value of TDTP is −12.79 kcal mol−1, and those of the newly designed molecules are in the range of −14.91 to −19.41 kcal mol−1, implying that the solubility in 1,2-dichlorobenzene is enhanced by nitrogen substitution.
Interface property
The interface interaction is one of the important factors influencing the extraction of photogenerated carriers.88 To characterize the interface property, we optimized the structures of the TDTP-based ETMs adsorbed on the 110-perovskite surface with two different types of terminations (PbI2-terminated or MAI-terminated). The calculations obtained a similar trend in the interface structure and charge transfer behavior for the two terminations, so in this text we explicitly discussed the results on the PbI2-terminated interface which is favored to contact the ETMs,89,90 and put the results of the MAI-terminated interface in the ESI (Fig. ESI3 and 4†). The obtained configurations are shown in Fig. 9. The adsorption energy (Eads) is calculated by the following equation: Eads = EETM/perovskite − EETM − Eperovskite, where EETM/perovskite, EETM, and Eperovskite are the energies of the ETM adsorbed on the perovskite system, the pristine ETM, and the perovskite surface, respectively. In the TDTP/perovskite system, the shortest distance between the sulfur atom (S) in thiophene and the lead (Pb) atom in MAPbI3 is 3.43 Å, which is in good agreement with a previous report of about 3.3 Å adsorption distance between the TDTP molecule and the 110-perovskite surface.26 In the newly designed ETM/MAPbI3 systems, the shortest N⋯Pb distance decreases to 2.55–2.64 Å, indicating a stronger interface interaction. Accordingly, the adsorption energies (from −1.35 eV to −1.79 eV) with the newly designed ETMs are three to four times higher than that (−0.39 eV) with TDTP, confirming the enhanced interface interaction by introducing a nitrogen atom into the thiophene ring or replacing a hydrogen atom on the methyl with an amino group.

To obtain more information about the interface property, we have computed the charge density difference and plotted the results in Fig. 10, which show the charge depletion (in yellow) and charge accumulation (in blue) between the interacting ETM/perovskite complex and the isolated fragments at the same position. In Fig. 10, we can see that the charge depletion mainly distributes in the areas around the N atoms of the molecular skeleton in the ETM and the Pb atoms in MAPbI3, while the charge accumulation mostly appears in the regions of the side chains in the ETM. Thus, there is an evident charge rearrangement for both the ETM and perovskite as a consequence of the interface interaction. A further charge analysis based on the Bader method91 indicates the number of transferred electrons from the perovskite to ETMs are 0.48, 0.64, 0.60, 0.40, 0.40, and 0.65 electrons for TDTP, TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, TDTP-2b, TDTP-3a, and TDTP-3b adsorbed on perovskite systems. Therefore, our results illustrate that TDTP-based ETMs (especially TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, and TDTP-3b) exhibit good charge transfer capability across the ETM/perovskite interface.

Conclusions
In this work, we designed a series of organic molecules (TDTP-1, TDTP-2a, TDTP-2b, TDTP-3a, and TDTP-3b) as ETMs for inverted PSCs by introducing a nitrogen atom or attaching an amino group into the side chain of TDTP. Theoretical results reveal that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the designed molecules agree well with the active layers of the perovskite devices. Importantly, nitrogen substitution greatly improves the electron mobility by approximately two orders of magnitude up to 1.28 cm2 V−1 s−1 in TDTP-3b. This superior performance is mainly attributed to the strong interactions between the introduced nitrogen atoms and the positively charged regions of the backbone that change the crystal motif from herringbone to quasi two dimensional π-packing. Moreover, the designed molecules exhibit enhanced stability in air and solubility in an organic solvent. Simulations on the structures and adsorption energies of TDTP-based ETMs adsorbed on the 110-perovskite surface reveal that the ETM/perovskite interface interaction is enhanced due to the additional N⋯Pb interaction, which implies more efficient electron transport with the newly designed ETMs. Overall, our findings that the added N atoms turn the ETM crystal motif to a more packed pattern in favor of electron transport and enhance the ETM/perovskite interface interaction appear as the physical origin for the observations of introducing nitrogen atoms to ETMs achieving improved performance in PSCs.39–42 Our results offer a useful strategy for designing small organic molecules as ETMs for efficient and stable PSCs.
