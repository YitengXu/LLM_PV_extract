    , Accepted 31st July 2015First published on 31st July 2015AbstractTernary donor (D)–acceptor (A)–acceptor (A) molecules are commonly considered as low triplet (T1) energy systems for specific applications. In this work, exception to this behavior was observed in a triangle-shaped D–A–A molecule PCImbPO with unusually high triplet energy of 3.0 eV. Profiting from the enhanced D–A electronic coupling, electron injecting and transporting ability of PCImbPO was dramatically improved with negligible influences on its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) characteristics. Its particular T1 configuration adjustment further gives rise to the separated frontier MO and T1 locations, beneficial to suppress quenching effects. By utilizing PCImbPO as host in blue phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence devices, impressively high external quantum efficiency of 22% and 12% were achieved, respectively. This work established a new understanding of high-energy-gap complicated D–A systems.
1. Introduction
Optoelectronic organic semiconductors have a bright prospect in information technology1–6 and energy conversion fields,7–9 owing to their unique superiority in functional design and integration at a molecular level.10 Nevertheless, demanding requirements on optoelectronic performance for practical and commercial applications motivate continuous efforts towards judicious and accurate molecular design with simultaneous consideration of functional groups, linkage modes and intra-/inter-molecular interactions. Commonly, optical properties of organic molecules are mainly determined by excited state characteristics, especially the first singlet and triplet states (S1 and T1),11–16 while electrical properties primarily originate from frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) and molecular topological structures.17 These seemingly independent factors are actually correlative, since (i) excited-state energy strongly depends on FMO energy gap and distributions, e.g. low-energy charge-transfer (CT) excited states form in donor–acceptor (D–A) type molecules with separated FMOs; (ii) molecular configuration exerts an important impact on excited state energy and location.18 These correlations reflect the contradiction between optical and electrical properties, which gradually become predominant under increasingly stringent requirements on material performance and has aroused extensive interest in selective photoelectronic modulation approaches.19
Ternary D–A structures are superior in carrier injection and transportation balance and absorption bathochromic shift, owing to independent and tunable charge affinities of D and A moieties and the formation of low-energy CT excited states,20 which are harmonized for photoactive dyes in organic solar cells.21,22 However, ambipolar characteristics and low-energy triplet excited states become an obstacle for host materials in blue phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) and thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) devices, since in most cases the low triplet (3CT or 3ππ*) energy of the ternary D–A system can not support efficient triplet energy transfer to blue phosphorescent and TADF dyes such as bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato-N,C2′)(picolinato)iridium(III) (FIrpic, T1 = 2.65 eV)23 and bis[4-(9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine)phenyl]sulfone (DMAC-DPS, T1 = 2.90 eV)24 (Fig. 1a, II).23 This leads to a perception that ternary D–A systems with effective intramolecular electronic coupling can hardly realize high triplet energy approaching 3.0 eV.24–34 Nevertheless, owing to their superior electrical properties, efficient phosphorescent D–A hosts have emerged in recent years,32,35–49 even though their intramolecular electronic coupling is commonly suppressed by meta-, insulating or twisted linkages; while, only few D–A hosts are reported for blue TADF devices.50 Nevertheless, there are very few reports about high-energy-gap ternary D–A type hosts without any spacers or linkers involved. Actually, if high triplet energy is less of an issue (Fig. 1a, III), ternary D–A systems are almost ideal as host materials with the independent highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and T1 locations, which is conducive to suppressing polarization-induced exciton decomposition (PIED)51 and triplet–polaron quenching (TPQ) effects.52,53 Recently, we reported a D–A–D host with a structure of two carbazole donors linked by a phenylphosphine oxide acceptor, which endowed its FIrpic-based blue PHOLEDs with favorable performance owing to its unique dynamically adaptive electrical characteristics.54 Nevertheless, a more in-depth understanding on universal determinants of excited state and FMO properties for ternary D–A molecules is still imperative.

In this contribution, two triangle-shaped ternary D–A type carbazole–benzimidazole hybrids (Fig. 1b), namely PCImbCz and PCImbPO, were constructed with unusual optoelectronic properties. Both of them achieved an extremely high T1 energy of ∼3.0 eV – one of the largest values among D–A molecules with effective intramolecular electronic coupling.55 Compared with their D–A–σ–D and D–A–σ–A analogues (PCImpCz and PCImpPO), the selective adjustment of FMO and triplet state distributions in PCImbCz and PCImbPO was successfully realized through controlling the T1 state configuration and amplifying electronic coupling by secondary donor and acceptor, rendering improved electroactivity and the separated FMO and triplet state locations for PCImbPO. As the result, PCImbPO led to conventional blue PHOLEDs and TADF devices with favorable electroluminescent (EL) performances, e.g. EQE up to 22% and 12%, respectively, providing a brand-new insight into the potential and advantages of ternary D–A systems as ideal high-energy-gap semiconductors.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials and instruments
All reagents and solvents used for the synthesis of the compounds were purchased from Aldrich and Acros and were used without further purification.

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Mercury plus 400NB spectrometer relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Molecular masses were determined by a FINNIGAN LCQ Electro-Spraying Ionization-Mass Spectrometer (ESI-MS), or a MALDI-TOF-MS. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The crystal suitable for single-crystal XRD analysis was obtained through slowly diffusing hexane into dichloromethane solution of PCImbPO at room temperature. All diffraction data were collected at 295 K on a Rigaku Xcalibur E diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation in ω scan mode. The structure was solved by direct methods and difference Fourier syntheses. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters. The hydrogen atoms attached to carbons were placed in calculated positions with C–H = 0.93 Å and U(H) = 1.2Ueq(C) in the riding model approximation. All calculations were carried out with the SHELXL97 program. Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the target compound were measured using a SHIMADZU UV-3150 spectrophotometer and a SHIMADZU RF-5301PC spectrophotometer, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed on Shimadzu DSC-60A and DTG-60A thermal analyzers under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) studies were conducted using an Eco Chemie B. V. AUTOLAB potentiostat in a typical three-electrode cell with a platinum sheet working electrode, a platinum-wire counter-electrode and a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate was used as electrolyte with a concentration of 0.1 mol L−1. All electrochemical experiments were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature in dichloromethane. Phosphorescence spectra were measured in dichloromethane using an Edinburgh FPLS 920 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 77 K cooling by liquid nitrogen with a delay of 300 μs using Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) method with a microsecond pulsed xenon light source for 10 μs–10 s lifetime measurement, the synchronization photomultiplier for signal collection and the Multi-Channel Scaling Mode of the PCS900 fast counter PC plug-in card for data processing.

The residue was purified by column chromatography with petroleum ether–ethyl acetate (2:1) as eluent to afford the product as a white powder (0.72 g, 85%). 1H NMR (TMS, CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 8.14–8.12 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.84–7.82 (d, J = 8 Hz, 1H), 7.51–7.49 (d, J = 8 Hz, 2H), 7.47–7.35 (m, 3H), 7.34–7.19 (m, 8H), 4.32 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H), 4.26 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 2.57–2.40 ppm (m, 2H); LDI-TOF: m/z (%): 566 (100) [M+]; elemental analysis (%) for C40H30N4: C 84.76, H 5.35, N 9.89; found C 84.72, H 5.33, N 9.95.

2.3 Density function theory (DFT) calculations
DFT computations were carried out with different parameters for structure optimizations and vibration analyses. The ground states and triplet states of molecules in vacuum were optimized without any assistance of experimental data by the restricted and unrestricted formalism of Becke's three-parameter hybrid exchange functional56 and Lee, and Yang and Parr correlation functional57 (B3LYP)/6-31G(d), respectively. The fully optimized stationary points were further characterized by harmonic vibrational frequency analysis to ensure that real local minima had been found without imaginary vibrational frequency. The total energies were also corrected by zero-point energy both for the ground state and triplet state. The spin density distributions were visualized with Gaussview 3.0. All computations were performed using the Gaussian 03 package.58
2.4 Device fabrication and testing
Before loading into a deposition chamber, the ITO substrate was cleaned with detergents and deionized water, dried in an oven at 120 °C for 4 h, and treated with oxygen plasma for 3 min. Devices were fabricated by evaporating organic layers at a rate of 0.1–0.2 nm s−1 onto the ITO substrate sequentially at a pressure below 4 × 10−4 Pa. Onto the electron-transporting layer, a layer of LiF with 1 nm thickness was deposited at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1 to improve electron injection. Finally, a 100 nm-thick layer of Al was deposited at a rate of 0.6 nm s−1 as the cathode. The emission area of the devices was 0.09 cm2 as determined by the overlap area of the anode and the cathode. After fabrication, the devices were immediately transferred to a glove-box for encapsulation with glass cover slips using epoxy glue. The EL spectra and CIE coordinates were measured using a PR655 spectra colorimeter. The current–density–voltage and brightness–voltage curves of the devices were measured using a Keithley 4200 source meter and a silicon photodiode calibrated in advance. All the measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient conditions. For each structure, five devices were fabricated to confirm the performance repeatability. To make conclusions reliable, the data reported herein were most close to the average results.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Design, synthesis and stability
These molecules with a collective name of PCImG contain a typical D–A unit of 2-(N-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)benzimidazole (PCIm), in which carbazole and benzimidazole served as D and A groups, respectively (Fig. 1b). Secondary donor of carbazole or acceptor of diphenylphosphine oxide (DPPO) are incorporated at N-position of imidazole ring through either phenyl (PCImbCz and PCImbPO) or propyl (PCImpCz and PCImpPO) as a linker to form triangle configuration and desired D–A–D/D–A–A or D–A–σ–D/D–A–σ–A structures, respectively (Scheme 1). The molecular structure of PCImbPO was further confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 2). PCImG showed good thermal stability with a temperature of decomposition (Td) of >300 °C, making device fabrication through vacuum evaporation feasible (Fig. S1, ESI† and Table 1). PCImbCz and PCImbPO were more thermally stable compared to their σ-linked congeners owing to their fully conjugated structures. Furthermore, a melting point of more planar PCImbCz was observed at 268 °C without visible glass transition. Contrarily, asymmetrical PCImbPO with sterically hindered DPPO and thereby more rigid structure showed excellent morphological stability with an extremely high temperature of glass transition (Tg) of >200 °C, which is outstanding among small molecules.35,46,59

3.2 Optical properties
Particular optical properties of PCImG were investigated with their electronic absorption and emission spectra shown in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 3). PCImG indicated similar absorption bands, among which the bands corresponding to intramolecular CT (ICT) transitions of PCImbCz and PCImbPO at 300–350 nm were remarkably stronger than those of their σ-blocked congeners, owing to more effective D–A electronic coupling. Consequently, according to absorption edges, band gaps of PCImbCz and PCImbPO are smaller than those of PCImpCz and PCImpPO. Directly linked D–A–A structure endowed PCImbPO with the lowest 1CT energy of 3.2 eV, which was coincident to the longest emission wavelength of its fluorescence (FL) spectrum (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The improved ambipolar characteristic of PCImbPO was further affirmed by the largest bathochromic shift of its emissions in polar solvents, compared to other derivatives (Fig. S2, ESI†). Simultaneously, the asymmetric triangle configurations of PCImG suppressed the intermolecular interactions, which gave rise to their almost unchanged FL spectra in thin films (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Absorption (filled symbols) and fluorescence spectra (FL, open symbols) of PCImG in CH2Cl2 (10−6 mol L−1) and time-resolved phosphorescence (PH) spectra (inset) after a delay of 300 μs. 
More interestingly, the triplet energy of PCImG was as high as 3.0 eV according to 0–0 transitions of their time-resolved phosphorescence (PH) spectra in CH2Cl2 glass at 77 K (inset in Fig. 3), which was ∼0.3 eV higher than their linear analogues.60 Since the influence of secondary donor/acceptor in PCImpCz and PCImpPO on triplet states and electronic coupling was suppressed by their σ-linkers, essentially identical triplet energies of PCImG testified that triplet energy preservation for PCImbCz and PCImbPO was successfully implemented through their triangle configuration, accompanied with enhanced D–A electronic coupling in the ternary D–A systems. The same T1 energy of PCImG led to almost identical optical properties of their FIrpic-doped thin films, including similar FIrpic-attributed emissions and corresponding lifetimes (Fig. S4, ESI†), which verified efficient host-dopant energy transfer and comparable suppression effects of PCImG on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA). Therefore, triangle-shaped D–A–D and D–A–A structures successfully endowed PCImbCz and PCImbPO with top-ranking T1 values among ternary D–A molecules and effective electronic coupling simultaneously.
3.3 Electrical properties
Density function theory (DFT) simulation on ground and triplet states of PCImG was performed to quantify the nature of selective modulation effect of their secondary donor or acceptor groups on optoelectronic properties (Fig. 4 and Fig. S5, ESI†). For PCImpCz and PCImpPO, their σ-linkers effectively block electronic communication between PCIm and the pendent carbazole and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO). Their 3ππ*-attributive T1 states, HOMOs and LUMOs are mainly localized and almost completely overlapped on carbazole of PCIm without any contributions from their secondary donor or acceptor. PCImbCz and PCImbPO reveal identical HOMO locations to those of their σ-blocked analogues. However, for PCImbCz, its LUMO shifts to the N-phenylimidazole moiety, accompanied with minor contribution from one phenyl of carbazole in PCIm. The involvement of active secondary acceptor in PCImbPO further induces its LUMO to be completely localized in the imidazole–TPPO segment, which is consistent with the strongest electronic coupling in the D–A–A structure as proved by optical analysis of PCImbPO. Simultaneously, steric hindrance of rigid pendent groups in PCImbCz and PCImbPO gives rise to approximately planar PCIm at the T1 state with remarkably reduced dihedral angle of its carbazole and benzimidazole, which enhances conjugation in PCIm to generate the 3CT-type triplet state. Therefore, different with their σ-blocked congeners, T1 states of PCImbCz and PCImbPO are mainly localized on benzimidazoles rather than carbazoles of PCIm. It is convincing that as designed, compared with all of carbazole–imidazole based D–A–D and D–A–A congeners (Fig. S6, ESI†), PCImbPO achieves the lowest LUMO and the most separated FMO and triplet state locations, establishing independent charge and energy transfer channels for PIED and TPQ suppression.
 Fig. 4  DFT calculation results of T1 state and FMO properties of PCImG. SDD refers to spin density distribution. 
The superiority of ternary D–A structures in modulating charge injection and transportation was experimentally verified with cyclic voltammetric analysis and the nominal single-carrier transporting devices of PCImG (Fig. 5). As estimated by DFT simulation, the same HOMO distributions in PCImG give rise to their similar HOMOs around −6.0 eV with a negligible differences within 0.04 eV. However, compared with other analogues, acceptor-localized LUMO of PCImbPO is dramatically reduced by 0.2 eV to afford an energy level of −2.7 eV, close to that of conventional electron-transporting material TmPyPB for barrier-free electron injection (Scheme S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, PCImpCz provided its single-carrier only devices with the largest current density (J), since its flexible pendent carbazole can serve as an intermediate for charge hopping between adjacent carbazole groups. The smallest hole-only J of PCImpPO-based devices indicated the opposite effect of its pendent TPPO on blocking carbazole–carbazole communication. PCImbCz with two hole-transporting carbazoles supported its hole-only devices with the second largest J, while its LUMO-localized N-phenylimidazole is embedded by these carbazoles, leading to the smallest electron-only J of its devices. Contrarily, the effective involvement of TPPO in electron transportation endowed PCImbPO-based devices with the second largest electron-only J and the unique electron-dominant characteristics. In this sense, PCImbPO can balance carrier flux in emitting layers (EMLs) of the conventional heavily p-doped and hole-dominant OLEDs, sequentially improving EL efficiencies and reducing roll-offs.

3.4 EL performance of blue PHOLEDs and TADF diodes
After rationally demonstrating ternary D–A systems with unusually high triplet energy and selectively optimized T1 location and electrical properties, to investigate the intrinsic performance of host materials, blue PHOLEDs PA-PD and TADF devices FA-FD of PCImpPO, PCImbPO, PCImpCz and PCImbCz with the same conventional three-layer configuration of ITO|MoO3 (10 nm)|TAPC (70 nm)|PCImG:FIrpic or DMAC-DPS (10%, 20 nm)|TmPyPB (35 nm)|LiF (1 nm)|Al were fabricated without any further optimization (Scheme S1, ESI†). Commercially available high-energy-gap host mCP was utilized to prepare the control devices PE and FE with the same configuration. The effective energy transfer from PCImG to FIrpic and DMAC-DPS was verified by the dopant-attributed EL emissions (insets of Fig. 6a and c).
 Fig. 6  (a and c) Voltage–current characteristics (open symbols) and voltage–luminance curves (filled symbols) of blue phosphorescent and TADF OLEDs of PA-PE (a) and FA-FE (c) using PCImG and mCP as host; (b and d) efficiency–luminance curves of PA-PF (b) and FA-FE (d). 

PCImbPO endowed PB and FB with the lowest operating voltage values of 3.0 and 3.6 V for onset, 5.0 and 5.1 V at 100 cd m−2 and 6.5 and 7.2 V at 1000 cd m−2, respectively, which were about 0.3–1.4 V lower than those of PE and FE (Fig. 6a and c and Table S1, ESI†). Strikingly, the driving voltages and J of PA-PD and FA-FD were perfectly corresponding to charge injecting and transporting ability of their hosts, which made controlling electrical status in devices through structural modification of D–A hosts feasible and predictable. Suffering from the weakest carrier transporting ability of PCImpPO, PA and FA revealed the highest driving voltages among these devices. Nevertheless, PCImpPO with the secondary acceptor improved carrier flux balance in PA and FA, leading to efficiencies either higher or equal to those of mCP-based PE and FE (Fig. 6b and d and Table S1, ESI†). By contrast, the hole-dominant characteristic of PCImpCz led to serious charge flux imbalance and narrow recombination zones in PC and FC, which partially resulted in their efficiencies being 30% lower than those of PE and FE. However, in spite of the most unbalanced electrical performance of PCImbCz, the maximum efficiencies of PD and FD were increased to 36.4 and 18.8 cd A−1 for current efficiency (CE), 38.1 and 16.0 lm W−1 for power efficiency (PE) and 17.5 and 9.4% for EQE, respectively, which should be mainly attributed to reduced quenching effects by partially separated FMO and T1 locations in PCImbCz. As expected, PCImbPO with the best electrical performance and separated FMO and T1 locations endowed PB and FB with the highest efficiencies as shown by maxima of 46.9 and 24.2 cd A−1, 49.1 and 21.0 lm W−1 and 22.5 and 12.2%, which were 1.5- and 2-fold of those of mCP-based PE and FE, respectively, and among the best blue phosphorescence31,45,61–63 and TADF diodes with conventional structures.6,64–66 The suppressed quenching effects in PB and FB were further evidenced by their reduced efficiency roll-offs as low as 5 and 6% for EQE at 100 cd m−2, respectively, which were less than a half of those of other devices. PA-PD and FA-FD showed identical consistency between EL efficiencies and T1 location and electroactivity of their hosts. On account of the identical T1 value of PCImG, the best EL performance of PB and FB among these devices should be ascribed to their balanced charge flux and efficiently suppressed PIED and TPQ supported by PCImbPO with enhanced D–A electronic coupling and separated FMO and T1 locations, which reflects the superiority of directly linked ternary D–A hosts in controllable modulation of optoelectronic properties compared to their binary and σ-blocked ternary analogues.
4. Conclusions
Selective optoelectronic modulation of ternary D–A systems through manipulating T1 configuration and controlling D–A electronic coupling was demonstrated by a TPPO substituted carbazole–benzimidazole hybrid PCImbPO. Its unique triangle-shaped D–A–A configuration results in an unusually high T1 value of 3.0 eV, identical to its σ-blocked congeners. The enhanced electronic coupling in the D–A–A structure gives rise to notable electron-dominant characteristics of PCImbPO, verifying the inherent advantage of D–A systems in electrical property tunability, which further renders separated FMO and T1 locations for quenching effect suppression. Therefore, an effective selective optimization approach for ternary D–A hosts was established to enhance electrical performance without any negative effects on optical properties. Consequently, PCImbPO endowed its blue phosphorescent and TADF OLEDs with the favorable performances, e.g. maximum EQE of >20% and 12%, respectively. With persuasive evidence of achievement of high triplet energy and facile control of triplet state and electronic properties through ternary D–A systems, this work not only establishes a new understanding about the determining characteristics for optimization of optoelectronic characteristics of D–A systems, but also provides a pathway to develop high-energy-gap ternary or even more complicated D–A organic semiconductors for potential applications.
