    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 28th May 2020AbstractOptimal morphology tailoring and complete utilization of the nanomaterial components are the effective parameters for improving the electrocatalytic activity of nanomaterials in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). In the present work, a core–shell reduced graphene oxide (rGO) on tungsten sulfide (WS2), i.e., rGO@WS2 nanostructure was successfully prepared via microwave irradiation, which was found to catalyze the four-electron ORR in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. The rGO@WS2 nanostructure showed an onset potential of 0.94 V and a 1.68-fold increase in the kinetic current density (−5.9 mA cm−2) for the ORR as, compared to the bare WS2 nanosheets. The superior performance of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure posits it as one of the efficient noble-metal-free ORR and MOR electrocatalysts. Predominantly, this work demonstrates the importance of an appropriate core–shell rGO@WS2 nanostructure in achieving high intrinsic activity for the four-electron ORR and MOR with significantly enhanced efficiency.
Introduction
Rapidly increasing demand for efficient, inexpensive, and eco-friendly energy sources has necessitated the research and development of fuel cells as an alternative to the traditional energy sources, such as the combustion of coal and gas.1 Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have gained significant attention in the energy conversion devices field due to their low-temperature operation (50–100 °C), high energy conversion efficiency (40–60%) and low pollutant emission.2,3 In particular, direct-methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) are the next-generation power sources for portable electronic devices due to high energy conversion efficiency, simple design, low pollutant emission, and convenient fuel storage and transportation.4,5 In DMFCs, Pt catalysts act as the active anode materials for the MOR whereas for the ORR, they act as the cathode materials.6 However, when Pt is used as the anode catalyst for the MOR, the catalyst surface is easily poisoned due to the formation of a carbon monoxide (CO) intermediate during the reaction, which blocks the active sites and inhibits the methanol oxidation.7,8 Besides, low activity, high price and limited abundance of the Pt catalyst in DMFCs limit its future applicability for ORR and MOR reactions.9 To overcome such disadvantages, several researchers have focused on improving the fuel cell performance by using transition metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and nitrides.10–14
Among various carbonaceous materials, graphene is one of the well-known two-dimensional (2D) materials due to the presence of a mono-atomic sheet of carbon atoms. In addition, graphene sheet exhibits outstanding properties such as ultrahigh precise surface area of 2600 m2 g−1, superior electrical conductivity, flexibility, and high electrochemical performance.15,16 The atomically thin 2D metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials such as TiS2, TaS2, WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2 and their composites with graphene or graphene oxide have gained increased research interest in recent years due to their optical activities and electronic properties.17,18 Moreover, these TMDCs exhibit certain excellent properties (optical, chemical, catalytic, and electronic), which make them highly attractive for various applications19 such as supercapacitors,20 energy storage,21 lithium and sodium ion batteries,22 solar cells,23 and biosensors.24 Among various TMDCs, WS2 is a layered material that has an indirect bandgap of 1.3 eV in its bulk form and a direct bandgap of 2.0 eV in the monolayer form.25,26 The altered bandgap makes WS2 an important candidate material for optoelectronics and nanoelectronics,26,27 particularly because of its non-toxic, inert, and eco-friendly nature.27,28
In order to improve the mitigated aggregation and electronic conductivity of WS2, rGO has attracted interest due to its remarkable electrical and thermal conductivity, inherent flexibility and large surface area.29 For example, Wu et al.30 demonstrated that the MnO/rGO nanohybrid exhibits a higher ORR performance when compared to pristine ones. Importantly, the rGO surface consists of functional groups like –COOH and –CHO that can form a heterostructure. Considering the catalytic activity of WS2 and excellent electrical conducting characteristic of rGO, the rGO@WS2 nanostructure has been expected to be a superior ORR catalyst by abstaining from aggregation and retaining high electrical conductivity.
In the present work, we have developed a facile and highly efficient electrocatalyst, rGO@WS2 through a simple microwave irradiation approach. The electrocatalytic performance of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure has been studied by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). The electrocatalytic activity of rGO@WS2 towards the MOR was assessed by cyclic-voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA), which demonstrated the enriched activity and stability of the synthesized catalyst for the MOR and ORR in alkaline media.
Results and discussion
The phase and structural purity of the as-synthesized WS2 and rGO@WS2 catalysts were analyzed by XRD, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 1. The XRD pattern suggests that the WS2 catalysts have a hexagonal structure, with the major peak positions at 14.3°, 32.33°, 33.47°, and 39.29° assigned to the (002), (100), and (103) reflection planes of WS2, in accordance with JCPDS-84-1398.27 The rGO shows a single obvious peak at 26.56° that was well indexed to the (002) crystal plane of graphite. For the rGO@WS2 catalyst, the (002) peak was relatively weaker compared to that of the bare WS2, indicating that the (002) crystal faces of WS2 in the rGO@WS2 nanostructure were less exposed than in the bare WS2. It is evident that the rGO has been successfully deposited on the surface plane of WS2 and its crystalline structure was preserved even after the deposition of rGO onto the surface of WS2 along the (002) plane.

Fig. 2 displays the SEM morphology images of the rGO@WS2 catalysts. The WS2 nanosheets were completely enclosed by the rGO layers, forming a core–shell nanostructure. Moreover, the surface roughness of the bare WS2 as successfully modified by rGO indicates the formation of additional active sites which were favorable for high catalytic performance. Fig. 3a shows the HRTEM image of the rGO@WS2 catalyst, and it has been observed that few-layer rGO nanosheets were deposited on the surface of WS2. Most importantly, the few-layer rGO effectively improves the electrode conductivity, and diminishes the volume change of WS2, thereby rendering the WS2 catalyst more stable during the oxygen reduction process. Fig. 3b shows the SAED pattern of the rGO@WS2 catalyst, and the dot SAED pattern indicates the crystalline nature of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure.

FTIR spectra of the WS2, rGO, and rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. For WS2, the bands at 490–1050 cm−1 could be assigned to the W–S bonds and S–S bonds of WS2.31 The peaks perceived at 1364 and 1736 cm−1 could be ascribed to the stretching modes of the hydroxyl group, and the band at 2930 cm−1 has been allotted to the OH vibrations.31,32 For rGO, the peaks at 1200–1640 cm−1 were accredited to the C–O–C and C–OH bending, and sp2 lattice modes, and the peaks at 1745 and 2979 cm−1 were endorsed to the CO and O–H stretching modes of rGO.33 For the rGO@WS2 nanostructure, the peaks at 618, 1200–1780, and 2142 cm−1 were accredited to the W–S bond, and the CO and –OH stretching vibration modes of rGO and WS2. These results have confirmed the deposition of rGO on the WS2 nanosheet surfaces.33,34

XPS was engaged to recognize the chemical composition and purity of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows the full range spectrum of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst. Mainly, three marked peaks were detected at the binding energies of 34.12, 161.96, and 284.86 eV, that were assigned to W 4f, S 2p, and C 1s, respectively. W and S atomic peaks were detected from WS2, while the C 1s signal arose from rGO, confirming that the rGO was embedded on the surface of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst. Fig. 5b shows that the W 4f spectrum exhibits three major peaks at the binding energies of 31.98, 34.12, and 37.28 eV that were attributed to the W 4f7/2, W 4f5/2 and W 5p3/2 states, correspondingly.35 In the S 2p field (Fig. 5c), the two broad peaks at 161.96 eV and 163.41 eV match to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, correspondingly.36Fig. 5d presents the C 1s spectrum, with three major peaks at 284.86, 285.17, and 285.74 eV conforming to the sp2 hybridized CC, sp3-hybridized C–C, and C–O bonds, correspondingly.37–39 These results confirmed that rGO nanosheets were attached to the surface of WS2 in the rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst.

Fig. 6a and b explain the LSV profiles of the bare WS2 and rGO@WS2 electrodes in O2-soaked 0.1 M KOH obtained for the different rotation speeds of 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1300, and 1600 rpm. Remarkable increase in the peak current was observed with the changes in the rotation speed for both electrodes. The onset potential and half wave potential of the rGO@WS2 electrode were 0.94 V and 0.75 V vs. RHE and the peak current moved closer to the negative side. For the rGO@WS2 nanostructure, the current peak was abruptly amplified and the onset potential was greater relative to that of bare WS2. The rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode exhibited a higher onset potential (0.94 V) than the bare WS2 electrode (0.83 V), confirming the crucial role of rGO in the ORR activity. Consequently, these results established the rGO@WS2 nanostructure as a good electrocatalytic material for the ORR. Fig. 6c shows the LSV profiles obtained at 1600 rpm using the bare WS2, rGO and rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrodes. Here, it is important to note that the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode originates to be more dynamic with a higher current density value (−5.9 mA cm−2) than the bare WS2 and rGO electrodes. The observed high current density of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode suggests that the rGO@WS2 nanostructure has considerably enhanced the ORR performance. The ORR performance characteristics of the WS2, rGO, and rGO@WS2 catalysts were investigated using the CV technique in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution purged with O2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (Fig. 6d). It is noteworthy that the rGO@WS2 electrode demonstrated an ORR performance at an advanced reduction potential as indicated by the appearance of a robust cathodic peak at 0.62 V (vs. RHE) with a greater current density compared to that of the bare WS2 electrode (0.51 V). These outcomes revealed that the high ORR activity on the rGO@WS2 nanostructure was due to the abundance of the redox active sites, good electrical conductivity, and greater active specific surface area of rGO. Moreover, the conjugated π-molecular assembly of rGO has also improved the stability and redox properties of the rGO@WS2 electrode.40 Therefore, the above-mentioned outcomes support the effective catalytic activity of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure for the ORR. The comparative study of various heterostructure electrocatalysts with the rGO@WS2 catalyst has been tabulated in Table 1.

To gain better insights into the ORR drive at the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode, the electron number (n) was assessed using the LSV curves of ORR on RRDE from Fig. 6a and Fig. S1 (ESI†), as presented in Fig. 7a. The number of electrons “n” value was estimated on average as 3.97, indicating that the ORR involves a 4e− transfer route carried out over the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode. Fig. 7a also reveals that the yield of the peroxide species formed during the reduction reaction was negligible, thereby reflecting the dominant role of the 4e− transfer process. Therefore, the proposed rGO@WS2 nanostructure exhibits a greater catalytic activity towards ORR performance. Furthermore, the corresponding K–L plots and the number of relocated electrons (e−) in this ORR process were evaluated using the K–L equation.40 From the K–L plot (Fig. 7b), a decent linear range with an almost persistent slope value was observed, indicating that the identical number of e− were relocated for the potentials in the 0.3–0.9 V range. The results suggest that the ORR involves a multi-electron transfer reaction process that could proceed through two main possible pathways: (i) the 2e− pathway and the 4e− pathway as described in the following equations: O2 + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH− (2e− transfer)(1) H2O + 2HO2− + 2e− → 3OH− (2e− transfer)(2) O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH− (4e− transfer)(3)

In addition to the elimination of the noble-based electrocatalysts, the efficient catalytic performance, long-durability, and extraordinary tolerance to the MOR of the ORR catalysts are the additional significant requirements for the practical use of FCs. The I–t chronoamperometric retorts were obtained for the rGO@WS2 nanostructure in an O2-purged 0.1 M KOH solution (Fig. 8a). The relative current density for the rGO@WS2 nanostructure demonstrates a slow attenuation even after the run time of 5000 s, retaining 99% of the initial current density. The initial current density of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure decreased negligibly, reflecting the stability of the electrode, ascribed to enhanced activity sites and electrical conductivity by coupling of rGO with WS2. This result indicated that the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode would facilitate stable ORR performance. Furthermore, the durability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure for the ORR was also estimated by assessing the LSV profiles before and after the 5000 s CA series in O2-purged 0.1 M KOH at 5 mV s−1. Fig. 8b shows the LSV curves before and after CA for the run time of 5000 s. It is evident that in both cases, a minute decrease was observed in the cathodic current due to carbon corrosion during the potential cycling after the run time of 5000 s.41 However, for both cases, the onset potential was the same, indicating the remarkable stability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure.

The electrocatalytic MOR activity of the as-synthesized rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst was examined using CV and EIS analysis. Fig. 9a displays the CV curves of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode obtained at a rate of 50 mV s−1 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte in the absence and presence of methanol, i.e., for the concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 M. It was observed that the rGO@WS2 nanostructure catalyst exhibited the strongest oxidation that contributed to the charge transfer in the solid-state reactions in the presence of methanol. Furthermore, the enclosed CV curve area was increased with increasing methanol concentration, indicating the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode as the origin of its high MOR activity. Initial reactants (OH−) were adsorbed on the rGO catalyst surface and then changed into the by-products through the formation of an intermediate species. The addition of 2 M methanol caused a rapid increase in the current density to 75 mA cm−2 at 50 mV s−1, demonstrating the good electrocatalytic performance of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure. It was ascribed to the 2D/2D core–shell feature of rGO and WS2 that facilitates ion transport due to the considerably improved number of reactive edge sites in the nanostructure. Thus, the enhanced high current density of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode was attributed to the synergetic effect of the 2D layer structure of rGO and WS2.
 Fig. 9  CV profiles recorded for the rGO@WS2 nanostructure (a) with and without methanol, and (b) influence of methanol concentration over the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode. 

Fig. 9b shows the cyclic stability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode with different methanol concentrations. It was perceived that the current density increased with increasing methanol concentration along with the cyclic stability of the as-fabricated electrode. Since the electrochemical activity of an electrode could be contingent on its charge transfer features, EIS measurements were performed to obtain information about the charge transfer resistance of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode without and with an increase in the methanol concentration to 2 M in 1 M KOH, and the corresponding consequences are shown in Fig. 10. It is observed that the EIS spectrum consists of two regions, namely a high-frequency region with the attendance of a very slender semicircle demonstrating an insignificant Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the straight line in the low-frequency trace subsequent to the well-known double layer capacitance effect of the rGO and WS2 materials. After the accumulation of methanol up to 1 M, the charge transfer increased and then decreased as the methanol amount increased to 2 M. The slight variation in the substrate resistance was due to the unevenness and roughness of the electrode surface. Overall, the Nyquist curve shapes were the same for all the conditions, indicating the higher conductivity and lower electron transfer resistance of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode. After the addition of methanol, a very slight change was observed in the EIS plots, indicating that the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode has greater tolerance to intervening poison.63–67 The enriched electrochemical activity of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode was due to its unique 2D/2D layered structure and core–shell morphology.

To investigate the stability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode for the MOR, the electrochemical stability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure was analyzed by CA analysis, with the results presented in Fig. 11. The outcomes for the rGO@WS2 nanostructure with different methanol concentrations at 0.4 V vs. SCE for 2400 s demonstrate the remarkable stability of the rGO@WS2 nanostructure electrode. As shown in Fig. 11, it is important to note that 1 M methanol is the optimal concentration for the rGO@WS2 nanostructure for which the electrode has exhibited a stable and maximum current density of 14 mA cm−2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we report a facile, template-free, and rapid microwave treatment synthesis approach for obtaining a rGO@WS2 catalyst with a core–shell structure. The synthesized catalyst showed better performance and stability for the MOR and ORR in alkaline media. RRDE tests of the rGO@WS2 nanocomposite as an electrode in O2-saturated 0.1 KOH demonstrated enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the ORR and MOR, due to the greater abundance of catalytic sites and greater reactant exchange efficiency of the core–shell rGO@WS2 catalyst structure. By virtue of its remarkable stability and catalytic performance towards the MOR and ORR, rGO@WS2 stands as a suitable electrocatalyst material and promising candidate for future use in alkaline fuel cells.
