    , Accepted 12th March 2018First published on 13th March 2018AbstractIn this work, we have designed and synthesized two new non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) based on a thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole (BTT) unit as a π-bridge to connect an indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the central core and 3-otcylrhodanine (A1) or 3-otcyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (A2) as the terminal group. Compared with the analogous structure of IDT-2BR, which possesses a benzothiadiazole (BT) unit as a π-bridge, the fusion of an aromatic thiophene ring onto the BT unit not only extends the conjugation length, but also stabilizes the quiniod conjugation system, which greatly strengthens the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. Meanwhile, the introduction of an electron-withdrawing ester group at the fused thiophene ring also intensifies the ICT effect, thus leading to more red-shifted absorption and a reduction in the bandgap. Moreover, because the 3-otcyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine unit with a strong electron-withdrawing malononitrile group further strengthens ICT and stabilizes the quinoid structure more than the 3-otcylrhodanine unit, A2 shows a deeper red-shifted absorption compared with A1, which is favourable for improving the light-harvesting efficiency and enhancing the short-circuit current density (Jsc). The photovoltaic performances of organic solar cell (OSC) devices based on A1 or A2 as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor have been investigated in detail. It was found that the device based on A1:PTB7-Th only displays a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.79%, whereas the PCE of the A2:PTB7-Th-based device with 1% DIO reaches 9.07% with a Jsc of over 20.33 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest Jsc values among IDT-2BR-type NFA-based OSCs. This work provides further insight into the structural design of new deep narrow bandgap NFAs with high efficiency in OSCs.
Introduction
Over the past two decades, bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have been recognized as a very promising technology in solar energy utilization because of their light weight, flexibility, and low-cost roll-to-roll production.1–4 Generally, in BHJ solar cells, the active layer is a blend film consisting of an electron donor and an electron acceptor that acts as an important key sub-unit to transform light into electricity.5–7 Fullerene derivatives including PC61BM and PC71BM as electron acceptors have some virtues, including isotropic electron transporting ability, high electron mobility and high electron affinity etc.8–10 Therefore, they have been widely used to build OSCs, and single-junction OSCs containing fullerene derivatives have shown excellent photovoltaic performances with efficiencies of over 11%.11 However, fullerene acceptors have some inherent drawbacks, such as a weak and narrow absorption band in the visible region, difficulties in regulating the energy level, high synthesis costs and poor morphological stability, which greatly limit their further development and application in BHJ-OSCs.12–14 Thus, these limitations have encouraged researchers to explore and develop non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) as a substitute for fullerene acceptors to achieve excellent BHJ-OSCs. Fortunately, some novel NFAs have been obtained through rational molecular design, and the photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NFA-based solar cells have exceeded those of fullerene-based BHJ devices.15–22
Up until now, much attention has been concentrated on the molecular design of NFAs with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type structures, in which electron-deficient units are located at both end-sides of the electron-donating core.23–27 The electronic and optical properties of those NFAs can be easily adjusted by modifying the molecular structures, including the electron-donating core and the electron-accepting terminal groups. At the same time, some conjugated units have been chosen as a π-bridge into the A–D–A type structure to further regulate the HOMO–LUMO energy levels and optical bandgap. For example, the benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) unit has been introduced as a π-bridge to build a series of A–π–D–π–A type NFAs for BHJ devices with excellent PCEs.16,28–32 A typical medium bandgap NFA called IDT-2BR was developed by Zhan and co-workers,15 in which IDT acted as an electron-donating core to be connected with the end groups of 3-ethylrhodanine by a BT unit as the π-bridge. IDT-2BR was combined with the narrow bandgap polymer poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th) as a donor, to build BHJ-OSC devices with excellent PCEs of over 10%.33 McCulloch and co-workers applied IDTBR and IDFBR as mixed acceptors in the fabrication of a solar cell device and achieved a PCE of over 11%.16 However, these kinds of NFAs still have much room for further molecular optimization and improvement, such as replacing the IDT core with an IDTT core34 or a DTN core,35 and substituting the BT bridge with a TbT unit,27 or a fluorinated BT unit,36,37 to modulate the optical and electronic properties.
Considering that the fusion of a thiophene ring on the BT unit can increase the quinoid population to strengthen the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of the conjugated backbone,38 it can be expected that the introduction of the thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole (BTT) unit as a π-bridge into an IDT-2BR derivative would further stabilize its quinoid conjugation structure to broaden the ICT absorption, thus significantly improving the capacity to harvest photons across the solar spectra and enhancing the generated photocurrent. Therefore, in this work, we have designed and synthesized two new non-fullerene acceptors based on the BTT unit as a π-bridge into IDT-2BR derivatives (A1 and A2). Fig. 1 shows the relative stabilization of the aromatic and quinoid resonance forms based on the BT unit and the BTT unit, respectively. As can be seen, a fused thiophene ring exists in the aromatic format in the quinoid structure, indicating that it can reduce the potential energy of the conjugated system and significantly stabilize the quinoid structure of A1 and A2.39,40 Thus, introducing the BTT unit into the IDT-2BR structure can make the π-electrons of the conjugated backbone more delocalized, implying that A1 and A2 will exhibit more broadened ICT absorption and a deeper and narrower bandgap than IDT-2BR. In addition, an electron-withdrawing carboxyl group introduced into the fused thiophene ring may further intensify the ICT effect and lower the LUMO–HOMO energy levels of the BTT-based acceptor, which can also reduce the optical bandgap and broaden the red-shifted absorption to improve Jsc. At the same time, two different terminal electron-withdrawing groups were introduced to regulate these properties. As the 3-otcyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine unit containing a malononitrile group can make the ICT effect stronger and the quinoid structure more stable than the 3-otcylrhodanine unit, A2 will show a deeper red-shifted absorption to improve the Jsc and PCE compared with A1. Indeed, the as-cast BHJ solar cells with A2 as the acceptor and PTB7-Th41,42 as the donor do exhibit PCEs of up to 9.07%, with Jsc values of over 20.33 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest Jsc values among NFA-based OSCs.43–47

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The detailed procedures for all of the intermediates, as well as A1 and A2, are described in the ESI.† The synthetic route of a key intermediate, ethyl 8-bromo-4-formylthieno[2′,3′:4,5]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-6-carboxylate (9), for the synthesis of A1 and A2, is shown in Scheme 1. Initially, 1-bromo-2,4-difluoro-3-methylbenzene was chosen as a starting material to prepare compound 1 via the aromatic nucleophilic substitution of a Br atom by a formyl group. The nitration of compound 1 produced compound 2, followed by amino-substitution of a fluorine atom at its 4-position, to afford compound 3. Compound 4 was easily synthesized through microwave irradiation of ethyl mercaptoacetate reacting with compound 3 to fuse the thiophene ring onto the benzene unit. The reduction of 4 by SnCl2 produced compound 5, which was not isolated and directly reacted with SOCl2 and then bromated with Br2 to give the benzothiadiazole derivative 7. Compound 8 was obtained by the further di-bromination of the methyl group in 7. Then the key intermediate 9 was obtained by the reaction of 8 with formic acid.

Scheme 2 presents the chemical structures and the corresponding synthetic routes for A1 and A2. As shown, compound 10 was synthesized via the Stille coupling of 9 with (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane). Ultimately, two new non-fullerene acceptors, A1 and A2, were obtained via the Knoevenagel condensation of 10 with 11 or 12, respectively. All of the new compounds were characterized using 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, EI-MS or TOF-MS, and elemental analysis.
 Scheme 2  The synthetic route for A1 and A2. 
In order to improve the solubility of A1 and A2, a long-chain alkyl group was introduced at the rhodanine group. Both of them can be easily solubilized in some common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature, which is very important for synthetic purification and device fabrication. The thermal properties of A1 and A2 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). They exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) at 332 °C (A1) and 374 °C (A2) (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of A1 and A2, and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, both of them exhibit broad and strong absorption in the 300–800 nm region with two intense peaks located at 334 nm/335 nm and 681 nm/707 nm, corresponding to A1 and A2, respectively. The former band can be assigned to the localized π–π* transition, while the latter comes from the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. In thin films, the absorption spectra of A1 and A2 become more broadened, with the maximum absorption peaks red-shifted to 785 nm and 770 nm, respectively, suggesting stronger intermolecular π–π interactions in the solid state. The onset absorption of A1 and A2 are estimated to be about 884 nm and 907 nm, corresponding to much narrower optical bandgaps of 1.40 and 1.36 eV, respectively. Compared with IDT-2BR, these two acceptors show more red-shifted ICT absorption in solution and in thin films (see Table 1 and Fig. S2 in ESI†). Also, the optical bandgap of IDT-2BR estimated from the absorption edge of the thin film (736 nm) is about 1.68 eV, much wider than that of A1 and A2. These results correspond to the expectation of our molecular design, indicating that the introduction of BTT to substitute the BT unit is an effective way to extend the ICT absorption and reduce the optical bandgap.

It should be noted that the absorption bands of A1 or A2 show good complementarity with the classic polymer PTB7-Th in the 500–1000 nm region (Fig. 2), suggesting that these two acceptors may be a good partner for PTB7-Th in the fabrication of BHJ-OSC devices with considerable broad light harvesting ability.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to determine the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of A1 and A2. The CV curves for A1 and A2, as well as those for IDT-2BR, are shown in Fig. S3,† and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, the HOMO/LUMO values of A1 and A2 are estimated to be −5.66/−3.70 and −5.70/−3.78 eV, respectively, which is much deeper than −5.58/−3.58 eV for IDT-2BR, indicating that the introduction of BTT to replace the BT unit lowers the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and reduces the bandgap. For A1 and A2, the presence of a stronger terminal electron-withdrawing group can further lower the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and reduce the bandgap of the acceptor.
Photovoltaic performance
Considering the complementary absorption and the matched energy levels of the acceptor and donor for improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, PTB7-Th was chosen as a donor alongside A1 or A2 as the acceptor to build the active layer for OSCs and evaluate the photovoltaic performance. Because inverted architecture shows better device stability compared to conventional architecture, we fabricated an inverted BHJ device with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/A1 or A2:PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag in this work. The active layer was spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solution. Fig. 3 depicts the J–V curves for the optimized devices. The photovoltaic parameters were acquired under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, and are summarized in Table 2. More particular device parameters under different device manufacturing conditions are given in Table S1 (ESI†).

Firstly, the influence of different donor/acceptor (D/A) blend ratios on the photovoltaic performances of OSCs was explored to optimize the devices. It was found that the devices with a blend ratio of D/A = 1.5:1 (by weight) for A1 and D/A = 1:2 (by weight) for A2 exhibit the best photovoltaic performances. A PCE of 3.32% with a Voc of 0.90 V, Jsc of 7.86 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 46.78% for A1 and a best PCE of 7.20% with a Voc of 0.71 V, Jsc of 17.57 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 57.65% for A2 were obtained. Then, under the optimal D/A ratio, 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added as a solvent additive to further optimize the photovoltaic performances. For A1, the PCE was increased to 5.79% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 12.54 mA cm−2 and FF of 51.75% after the addition of 1% (v/v) CN. As for A2, the PCE was significantly increased to 9.07% with a Voc of 0.71 V, Jsc of 20.33 mA cm−2, and FF of 62.80% after the addition of 1% (v/v) DIO. Although the A2:PTB7-Th-based device shows a much lower Voc (0.71 V), which is mainly attributed to its deeper LUMO energy level than A1, its Jsc reaches over 20.33 mA cm−2. Obviously, the much higher Jsc of the A2:PTB7-Th-based device can adequately compensate for its relatively lower Voc, thus leading to an improved PCE of over 9% in comparison to the A1:PTB7-Th-based device.

Fig. 4 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the A1:PTB7-Th and A2:PTB7-Th-based devices for comparison. The EQE of the optimal A1:PTB7-Th-based device covers a wavelength range from 300 to 900 nm, with a maximal value of 50.5% at 680 nm. By comparison, the optimized device based on A2:PTB7-Th has a broader photon response from 300 to 950 nm with the maximum value reaching 78.5% at 710 nm, manifesting more efficient photon harvesting and charge collection. The calculated Jsc values from the integration of the EQE data with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum are 7.84/12.14 mA cm−2 for the A1-based devices and 18.19/20.66 mA cm−2 for the A2-based devices without and with additive, respectively (the error was below 4%).

Charge carrier generation, transport, and recombination
In order to find out the difference between A1 and A2 with regards to exciton generation, dissociation and charge collection efficiency, we plotted the correlation of the photocurrent density (Jph) against the effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 5a. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL represents the current density under illumination conditions and JD represents the current density under dark conditions. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias voltage.48 It is supposed that photogenerated excitons are almost entirely dissociated into free charge carriers at high Veff (in this case, >2.0 V), the carriers are gathered by the electrodes effectually, and the gross efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection can be determined by the Jph/Jsat ratio. Under short-circuit conditions, the binary device based on the A1 or A2:PTB7-Th active layer has Jph/Jsat ratios of about 85.8% and 90.5%, respectively. Obviously, the large Jph/Jsat ratio of 90.5% for the A2:PTB7-Th active layer exhibits favourable exciton generation and charge collection processes, leading to the distinctly improved Jsc values of the binary device based on A2:PTB7-Th.
 Fig. 5  (a) Jphversus Veff curves; (b) Jsc dependence on light intensity (s is the slope of the linear fitting). 
In order to investigate the relationship between charge recombination and transport in the photoconductive layer, we measured the light intensity (P) dependence of Jsc. In general, if the slope (s) of the Jscversus P curve is close to 1, bimolecular exciton recombination is repressed in an OSC device.49,50 As shown in Fig. 5b, the recombination parameter (s) of the devices based on the A2:PTB7-Th blend film with DIO and the A1:PTB7-Th blend film with CN are determined to be 0.92 and 0.88, respectively, suggesting that bimolecular exciton recombination can be more effectively suppressed in the A2:PTB7-Th-based device than in the A1:PTB7-Th-based device. This result is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF of the binary A2:PTB7-Th devices.
In addition, a photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiment was also carried out to explore the exciton dissociation in the blend films.51 As shown in Fig. 6, after being excited at a wavelength of 700 nm, the PL emission of PTB7-Th appears in the range of 720–880 nm with a maximum peak at 769 nm. However, the emission of PTB7-Th is quenched by 95.8% and 98.8% for A1 and A2, respectively, in the A1 or A2:PTB7-Th blend films, indicating that the exciton can be separated more efficiently in the A2:PTB7-Th blend film than that in the A1:PTB7-Th blend film.
 Fig. 6  Photoluminescence spectra of the PTB7-Th film, A1:PTB7-Th with 1.0% CN film and A2:PTB7-Th with 1.0% DIO film excited at 700 nm. 
To better understand the difference in Jsc between the A1:PTB7-Th and A2:PTB7-Th-based devices, the charge transport properties of the optimized active layers were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method. The results are summarized in Table 3 and are shown in Fig. S4.† It can be seen that the electron mobility (μe) for the neat A1/A2 film is about 3.0 × 10−4/7.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, suggesting that A2 exhibits better electron mobility than A1. In addition, the hole/electron mobilities for the optimized A1:PTB7-Th and A2:PTB7-Th blend films were measured to be about 6.1 × 10−4/6.3 × 10−5 and 1.0 × 10−3/2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. By comparison, the A2:PTB7-Th blend film has a better hole–electron transport balance (μe/μh = 0.23) than that of the A1:PTB7-Th blend film (μe/μh = 0.10). Therefore, the higher electron mobility for A2 and the more balanced μe/μh for the A2:PTB7-Th blend film are responsible for the higher Jsc and FF of the resulting OSC device.

DFT calculations
Two acceptors and their π-stacking complexes with PTB7-Th (we use a dimer structure to represent the donor polymer) were optimized at BLYP/def2-SVP level with RI approximation using the ORCA 4.0 (ref. 52) program, while the long alkyl chain was simplified to be a methyl group. Grimme's D3 dispersion correction with Becke–Johnson damping53 and Grimme's geometrical counterpoise correction (gCP)54 were used during the optimization. Based on the optimized structures, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels, ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA) and excited state properties were calculated at the PBE0/def2-SVP and TD-PBE0/def2-SVP levels using the Gaussian 09 program. The solid phase polarization effects were approximated by the SMD solvation model55 using ethyl phenyl ether as the solvent (ε = 4.18). The optimized acceptor structures are shown in Fig. 7, and the complex structures are shown in Fig. S5.† A1 and A2 have similar planarity, in which a slightly larger torsion angle of around 25.6 degrees is observed between the donor unit and the BTT unit in A1, while the dihedral angle is only about 24.8 degrees in A2. The calculated HOMO and LUMO spatial distributions of A1 and A2 in Fig. 7b indicate that A2 has less HOMO spatial distribution extended to the BTT moiety. According to the theoretical calculation results, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels are −5.32/−3.62 eV and −5.55/−3.88 eV for A1 and A2, respectively. The corresponding bandgaps (Eg) for A1 and A2 are 1.70 eV and 1.68 eV. All of the theoretical calculation results are in good agreement with electrochemical data and absorption data.
 Fig. 7  (a) Optimized geometries of A1 and A2; (b) molecular orbitals of A1 and A2. 
In order to further investigate the intermolecular interaction between donor and acceptor in the active layer, the binding energies (ΔE) of both systems were calculated using the formula: ΔE = Ecomplex − Edonor − Eacceptor, which refers to the ability of the donor and the acceptor to bind together. The greater the absolute value of this calculated value, the stronger the ability of the donor and acceptor to bind and the better the efficient charge separation in the donor and acceptor.56 The optimized complex geometries are shown in Fig. S5.† The binding energy of A2:PTB7-Th is −57.77 kcal mol−1, which is larger than that of A1:PTB7-Th (−52.71 kcal mol−1), indicating that there is a stronger interaction between PTB7-Th and A2. Thus, a more optimized interaction between the donor PTB7-Th and acceptor A2 as well as higher charge separation efficiency could be expected. In the meantime, the CT exciton binding energy (Eb) was calculated based on the optimized complex structures. This value was decided by Eb = IP − EA − ES1, where ES1 is the energy of the first excited state. The ES1, IP and EA values of the PTB7-acceptor complex are shown in Tables S2 and S3.† The first excited state of both complexes is mainly contributed to by the HOMO to LUMO transition, where the HOMO is located on the polymer and the LUMO is located on the acceptor. The corresponding HOMO, LUMO and hole–electron distributions (obtained by Multiwfn57) are shown in Fig. S6.† The CT exciton binding energies are 0.406 eV and 0.385 eV for A1:PTB7-Th and A2:PTB7-Th, respectively, which could make the exciton of A2 exhibit better charge separation than that of A1, thereby resulting in a higher FF and Jsc. Thus, a more optimized interaction between the donor PTB7-Th and acceptor A2, along with higher charge separation efficiency would be expected.
Morphology characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to examine the morphologies of the active layers.58 The corresponding images of the acceptor:PTB7-Th blend films optimized with the additive are shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8a and d, the root mean square surface roughness values (Rq) are 15.472 nm and 0.982 nm for the A1:PTB7-Th blend film treated with 1% CN and the A2:PTB7-Th blend film treated with 1% DIO, respectively. Compared with A1, the A2:PTB7-Th blend film exhibits a much smoother surface with Rq decreasing from 15.472 nm to 0.982 nm. In terms of the phase images shown in Fig. 8b and e, the blend film based on A2 exhibits a much smaller size, clearer phase separation and more uniform morphology than the blend film based on A1. The smooth surface morphology of the film based on A2 is beneficial to minimizing the electrical leakage. As shown in Fig. 8c, the blend film of A1:PTB7-Th with CN (1.0%, v/v) shows obvious oversized black aggregations, which would retard the charge transport. On the contrary, Fig. 8f shows that the blend film of A2:PTB7-Th with DIO (1.0%, v/v) exhibits smaller aggregation domains and an interpenetrating network, which is basically in agreement with the morphology observed by AFM. The morphology of the A2:PTB7-Th blend film with DIO (1.0%, v/v) shows a bicontinuous D–A interpenetrating network morphology, which exactly corresponds to the smaller Rq value from the AFM images. The difference in the morphologies is conducive to the reinforced exciton dissociation, charge transfer and hole/electron mobility for the A2:PTB7-Th-based OSCs.59,60 Finally, these results are in good agreement with the increased Jsc and FF for the A2:PTB7-Th-based OSCs compared with A1:PTB7-Th based OSCs.

Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the A1:PTB7-Th and A2:PTB7-Th blend films were measured to further investigate the intermolecular stacking. As can be seen in Fig. S7,† the A2:PTB7-Th blend film shows a clear peak at 2θ = 4.34°, but no obvious peak is observed for the A1:PTB7-Th film. This peak for the A2:PTB7-Th blend film can be attributed to the (100) diffraction (d100) from a lamellar packing structure, and the corresponding lamellar stacking distance was calculated to be about 20.34 Å. Apparently, the crystallinity of the A2:PTB7-Th blend film is better than that of the A1:PTB7-Th blend film, which is likely due to the more stabilized quinoid structure of the A2 acceptor to strengthen the intermolecular interaction. Generally, more well-ordered intermolecular stacking is favourable for improving the charge transfer properties of OSCs.61–63 In addition, a broad and weak (010) peak that originates from the π–π stacking in the A1:PTB7-Th blend film and A2:PTB7-Th blend film appear at 2θ = 23.66° and 24.86°, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding π–π stacking distances (dπ) are calculated to be 3.76 Å and 3.59 Å for A1 and A2, respectively. The stronger lamellar stacking and short π–π stacking distance endow A2 with higher carrier mobility than A1, which is in agreement with their Jsc and FF values.61
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized two new BTT-based small molecule electron acceptors, A1 and A2, in which an IDT unit is used as the central core and 3-otcylrhodanine and 3-otcyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine are used as terminal groups, respectively. Notably, the thiophene-fused benzothiadiazole unit, for the first time, is employed as a π-bridge to build a new kind of NFA, resulting in an extended absorption band, effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer, and thereby enhanced Jsc values. Through morphology and device optimization, the OSC based on A2:PTB7-Th with 1% DIO exhibits a high PCE of 9.07% with an impressive Jsc of 20.33 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to the suitably strengthened intermolecular interaction between the donor and the acceptor on account of the extended conjugation and stabilizing quiniod structure of the bridge group. These results suggest that A2 is a promising NFA to be used in the fabrication of highly efficient OSCs. This work also provides a new idea that introducing a larger conjugation and stronger electron withdrawing group as a π-bridge to construct new NFAs is a feasible way to broaden the absorption and strengthen the intermolecular interactions of NFAs in highly efficient OSCs.
