Hence, the resulting solution-processed solar cells display an impressive Jsc of 12.03 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 4.35%.
Owing to their intense absorption in the visible-NIR region and their good photochemical/photophysical stability, squaraine dyes have drawn much attention for small-molecule organic solar cell (SMOSC) applications.1 According to their molecular framework, photovoltaic squaraine (SQ) dyes are generally classified as symmetrical (D–A–D, SSQ) or asymmetrical (D–A–D′, ASQ), with the squaric acid core acting as the electron acceptor (A) subunit, and electron-rich aromatic systems acting as the electron donor (D or D′) subunits. In addition, as illustrated in Scheme 1, for SSQ dyes, the D aryl groups can be linked to the A unit in either an X-manner1a,c (D aryl groups are connected to the A subunit directly) or a Y-manner2 (D aryl groups are linked to the A subunit via methylidene bridges); while for ASQ dyes, the D and D′ aryl groups can be linked to the A subunit not only in an X- or Y-manner, but also a further Z-manner,3 in which the D and D′ segments are connected to the A subunit directly and via a methylidene bridge, respectively.4
 Scheme 1  Typical molecular frameworks of photovoltaic squaraine dyes. 
Thanks to recent enthusiastic research efforts, high-performance SSQ-based SMOSCs with record power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 5.50%5 for X-manner and 3.14%2a for Y-manner have been achieved, whereas ASQ-based SMOSCs have showed relatively poor performances, with maximum PCEs of 2.05% and 1.22% for Y- and Z-manner,6 respectively. Therefore, ASQs have been considered as futureless organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials for a long time, and have received little research attention. However, in comparison with ASQs bearing a D–A–D′ molecular skeleton, D–A–D-structured SSQs possess less plentiful room for molecular tailoring, as they lack the diverse potential combinations of D and D′ subunits, and have no possibility of a Z-mannered linkage. Recently, through delicate molecular design, we have developed some high performance OPV ASQs linked in a Z-manner. SMOSCs using these dyes as electron donor materials showed a maximum open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.12 V, short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.03 mA cm−2, and PCE of 4.29%,1e,7 indicating that ASQs are also promising OPV materials.
It became clear from the studies of Gude et al. that the photophysical properties of squaraine compounds are highly correlated with their manner of connection,8 while all the hitherto developed OPV ASQs have been constructed through either a Y- or Z-manner, and no X-manner examples have been exploited.1,2 Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel ASQ dyes (Py-1–3, molecular structure shown in Scheme 2), the D and D′ segments of which are linked to the A subunit in an X-manner. Through rational molecular design, one of the synthesized compounds Py-3 showed an ideal bandgap of 1.33 eV, together with an intense and broad absorption band in the range 550–950 nm. An SMOSC using Py-3 as an electron donor displayed an excellent Jsc of 12.03 mA cm−2 and a high PCE of 4.35%, which are the highest Jsc and PCE among all the reported ASQ-based SMOSCs,1e indicating that ASQs with an X-manner linkage have good potential as OPV materials. Since most squaraine dyes suffer from a narrow absorption band, which is disadvantageous for the light-harvesting process in solar cells,1c,e we aimed at the exploitation of ASQs showing relatively broad absorption spectra in the visible-NIR region. Inspired by the discovery of Marks et al.1a,b that squaraines containing an (E)-2-((2,2-diphenylhydrazono)-methyl)-1-(hex-5-enyl)-1H-pyrrole D unit have relatively broad absorption bands and good hole mobility due to the presence of double-bond end-capped alkyl side-chains, and our finding that N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)indoline with a planar geometry is an ideal D′ segment for constructing high performance OPV ASQs with relatively low bandgaps, initially, we designed and synthesized compound Py-1 with (E)-2-((2,2-diphenylhydrazono)-methyl)-1-(hex-5-enyl)-1H-pyrrole as the D subunit and N-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)indoline as the D′ subunit, so that a broad absorption band and a low bandgap might be simultaneously acquired. Pleasingly, compared with the ASQ compounds we have reported previously, Py-1 shows wider absorption bands in both solution and thin film states.1e,7 In fact, in the thin film state, Py-1 displays an intense and broad absorption band in the visible-NIR region in the range 550–950 nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 232 nm (videFig. 1 and Table 1), which has effective overlap with the solar spectrum. In addition, the bandgap of Py-1 is 1.37 eV, which falls into the ideal bandgap range (1.2–1.6 eV) for OPV applications,9 and is lower than those of the OPV ASQ derivatives reported so far (≥1.43 eV).1e However, Py-1 shows rather poor solubility in common organic solvents (e.g., 7 mg mL−1 in chloroform), which may be ascribed to its rather planar molecular conformation and hence severe π–π intermolecular stacking. Since poor solubility of optoelectronic materials is disadvantageous for the fabrication of high-quality photoactive layers by spin-coating,10 a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) SMOSC using Py-1 as an electron donor and PC71BM as electron acceptor only exhibits a low PCE of 2.86% (device I, ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/Py-1:PC71BM (1:5, 80 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (100 nm); data shown in Table 2).

Consequently, to improve the processability of the target compounds, we changed the 1-indolinyl D′ subunit of Py-1 to a cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl group bearing additional alkyl segments. As expected, the resulting compound Py-2 shows much enhanced solubility over Py-1 (e.g., 20 mg mL−1 in chloroform);7b and its bandgap is 1.37 eV, which is identical to that of Py-1. Further photophysical characterization results indicated that in dilute solution, the absorption spectrum of Py-2 resembles that of Py-1 (Fig. 1), implying that the alteration of indolin-1-yl to cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl had little effect on the conjugation length of the resulting ASQ. Meanwhile, in the solid film state, the FWHM of the absorption spectrum of Py-2 is ∼10 nm narrower than that of Py-1, suggesting that the presence of the less coplanar cyclopenta[b] indolin-1-yl group in Py-2 alleviates intermolecular interactions.7b Nevertheless, intense molecular interactions in OPV materials are not only favourable for the widening of absorption spectra and hence improved light-harvesting capabilities, but are also beneficial for the enhancement of charge-carrier mobility. To promote more effective intermolecular π–π stacking,11 we designed and synthesized Py-3, in which an extra phenyl group is fused to the cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl segment of Py-2. Excitingly, Py-3 not only shows good solubility in common organic solvents (e.g., 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform), but also displays a ∼15 nm red-shifted λabs compared to Py-2 in both solution and solid film states. In fact, in comparison with Py-2, Py-3 displays an even lower bandgap of 1.33 eV and a ∼5 nm larger FWHM in its absorption spectrum in the solid film state. Therefore, the presence of the benzo[e]cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl D′ group in Py-3 endows it with not only a more extended conjugation length and hence a lower bandgap, but also stronger intermolecular interactions and hence a broadened absorption band. Moreover, all three target compounds Py-1–3 exhibit fairly high molar extinction coefficients of ∼105 L mol−1 cm−1. Taking into account the fact that Py-3 shows strong and broad absorption in the visible-NIR region together with a low bandgap of 1.33 eV, it is a good potential candidate for SMOSC applications.
Additional cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements indicated that all three compounds show two-electron reversible oxidation waves at 0.29 V and 0.69 V during the anodic scan, and hence the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of Py-1–3 were all calculated to be −5.09 eV. Meanwhile, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Py-1, Py-2 and Py-3 were estimated to be −3.72 eV, −3.72 eV and −3.76 eV, respectively, according to the HOMO energy level and optical bandgap data (Table 1 and Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
To gain deeper insight into the relationship between the molecular structure and photovoltaic properties of the target ASQ compounds, two solution-processed BHJ-SMOSCs with a similar device structure to Py-1-based device I were fabricated using Py-2 (device II) and Py-3 (device III) as the electron donor. The representative photovoltaic data of these devices are summarized in Table 2, and the current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency–wavelength (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with device II, device III shows an analogous Voc but a higher Jsc (11.22 mA cm−2vs. 10.32 mA cm−2) and a higher FF (0.46 vs. 0.42), hence giving a higher PCE (3.98% vs. 3.30%). In principle, Jsc correlates strongly not only with the light-harvesting capability and the hole-mobility of electron-donor materials, but also with the morphology of donor–acceptor blending films,12 hence, we firstly investigated the EQE curves of devices II and III. As shown in Fig. 2b, consistent with the absorption spectral properties of Py-2 and Py-3 in the thin film state, a broader spectral response towards EQE could be observed for device III compared to device II. The integration areas of the EQE curves in the range 300–900 nm were calculated to be 159.5 for device II and 175.4 for device III, implying that the broader absorption band of Py-3 relative to Py-2 indeed contributes to the light-harvesting capability and hence the enhancement of Jsc in device III compared to device II. Subsequently, we measured the hole-mobility of the neat ASQ films and the ASQ/PC71BM blended films by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. According to the experimental and calculated results, the hole-mobilities of the Py-2 and Py-3 films are 5.21 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1 and 5.56 × 10−5 cm2 V s−1, respectively; and the hole-mobilities of the Py-2/PC71BM and Py-3/PC71BM composite films are 3.27 × 10−6 cm2 V s−1 and 4.95 × 10−6 cm2 V s−1, respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Obviously, Py-3 shows higher hole-mobility than Py-2 in both neat and ASQ/PC71BM composite films, which may be attributed to the more effective intermolecular packing resulting from the benzo[e]cyclopenta[b]indolin-1-yl D′ segment with its more extended π-system.11 Further AFM characterization results revealed that both the Py-2/PC71BM and Py-3/PC71BM composite films show quite smooth surfaces with similar root-mean-square (RMS) values of 0.25 nm and 0.23 nm, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Consequently, the higher Jsc of device III relative to device II may originate from the broader absorption band and higher hole-mobility of Py-3 relative to Py-2. In addition, the FF of device III is higher than that of device II (0.46 vs. 0.42), which may also arise from the higher hole-mobility of Py-3.13

J–V characteristics (a) and EQE characteristics (b) of the OPV devices. 
Because thermal annealing is a well-adopted process for enhancing the performance of OPV devices,14 device IV (Py-2-based) and device V (Py-3-based) were fabricated by annealing their photoactive layers at 70 °C for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2, upon thermal treatment, the PCEs of both devices IV (3.72%) and V (4.35%) were increased relative to devices II and III. To the best of our knowledge, the Jsc of 12.03 mA cm−2 and the PCE of 4.35% for device V are both record values for ASQ-based OPV devices.1e,2a In fact, the OPV devices reported here have not been further optimized, and an even more improved device performance could be expected if additional optimization of the blending ratio of the electron donor/electron acceptor, the solvent annealing and additives were to be carried out.
In summary, a series of novel ASQ derivatives Py-1–3 were designed and synthesized. Unlike previously reported high performance OPV ASQs, the D aryl groups of which are generally directly connected to the A subunit but the D′ aryl groups of which are linked to the A subunit via a methylidene bridge, Py-1–3 have both D and D′ aryl groups linked directly to the A subunit. Through rational molecular design, Py-3 has been synthesized, which shows good solubility, a relatively low bandgap, a broad and intense absorption band in the visible-NIR region, and effective intermolecular packing properties. BHJ-SMOSCs using Py-3 as an electron donor material show high photovoltaic performance, with a PCE of 4.35% and Jsc of 12.03 mA cm−2, both of which are the highest values among BHJ-SMOPVs with ASQs as electron donor materials. All of these preliminary results indicate that ASQ derivatives with D and D′ aryl groups linked to the A subunit directly are promising OPV electron donor materials.
