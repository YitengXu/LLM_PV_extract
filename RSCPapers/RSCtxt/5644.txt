    , Accepted 16th December 2019First published on 16th December 2019AbstractThe poorly conductive organic layers in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites create quantum wells, which hinder the carrier separation and transformation. Therefore, the search for new 2D hybrid lead-halide materials with conductive organic components is crucial to high performance 2D perovskite solar cells. Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and its derivatives are well-known building blocks for conductive organic materials. We report here a new compound containing TMT–TTF (tetrakis(methylthio)tetrathiafulvalene) and layered PbI2, formulated as (TMT–TTF)[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3 (1). Crystal structural analysis shows that compound 1 is a unique TMT–TTF-intercalated 2D hybrid lead iodide with partially oxidized TMT–TTF cations and Pb-vacancy in anion. Its structural characteristics give the compound a narrow band gap and high conductivity. Furthermore, the carrier density and the photoelectric properties are first evaluated for TTF-PbI compounds and the results show that these properties of 1 are superior to those of the previously reported TTF-PbI salt, which is attractive for exploiting new lead-halide materials.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead-halide materials have attracted a great deal of interest because of their applications in photoelectric materials and especially in photovoltaic materials.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of hybrid halide perovskites with three-dimensional (3D) structures has increased rapidly from 3.8% to over 23% in less than a decade.2 Nevertheless, the stability of 3D perovskites remains a critical issue for perovskite materials.3 Motivated by the PCE and the stability issues of the solar cells, considerable works have been pouring into the studies of innovative architectures and chemical compositions for hybrid perovskites.4 The sizes of the organic cations have been shown to drastically affect the dimensionality and connectivity of the lead-iodide inorganic lattice.5 Small organic cations, such as MA (methylammonium)5a,b or FA (formamidinium),5c result in 3D hybrid perovskites while some slightly larger aliphatic ammoniums5d–f and cyclic ammonium cations5g,h form two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites. The 2D perovskites have shown great potential due to their appropriate PCE and appealing environmental stability.6 However, the PCE of the 2D perovskite materials is still lower than that of the 3D perovskites. The unsatisfactory performances of 2D perovskite solar cells result from the insulating organic spacer components. These organic layers create quantum wells, which hinder the carrier separation and transformation and consequently have higher carrier recombination rates. Therefore, the search for new 2D hybrid lead-halide materials with conductive organic components is necessary for high performance 2D perovskite solar cells. Recently, tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives (TTFs) have been found to exhibit excellent performances as hole transport materials in hybrid perovskite solar cells,7 which injects an impetus to the study of the photoelectric properties of TTFs-lead-halide compounds.
TTF is a sulfur-rich quasi-conjugated organic molecule with two reversible and easily accessible oxidation states (i.e., TTF˙+ radical cation and TTF2+ dication).8 TTFs exhibit tunable charge transfer (CT) properties and have been used in constructing a lot of CT materials such as molecular conductors and other electronic devices.9 By introducing TTFs into lead-iodide frameworks, the electric properties of the hybrid materials might be improved through carrier transfer between the inorganic lattice and the electron delocalized TTF moiety. The reported lead-halide compounds containing TTF and TTFs include β-(EDT-TTF-I2)2[Pb5/6□1/6I2]3, β-(EDT-TTF-I2)2[Pb2/3+xAg1/3−2x□xI2]3 (x = 0.05),10 (EDT-TTF-I2)2PbI3·H2O,11 and (TTF)Pb2I5.12 The electric properties for these four compounds have been studied and the results showed that the former three compounds display metallic behavior and the latter compound exhibits semiconducting behavior, but their photoconductivity and charge-carrier properties related to the performance of hybrid perovskites have not been investigated.
We report here a new hybrid compound containing TTFs and PbI2 networks, formulated as (TMT–TTF)[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3 (1) (TMT–TTF = tetrakis(methylthio)tetrathiafulvalene, Chart 1). Crystal structural analysis indicated that compound 1 is a unique TMT–TTF-intercalated 2D hybrid lead iodide. The basic formula of 1 is (TMT–TTF)[PbI2]3, where the layered PbI2 is a neutral structure. The TMT–TTF is inserted between the neutral PbI2 layers and forms a regularly packed organic layer. The inorganic Pb–I anion exhibits a 2D close-packed layer with a partial Pb-vacancy. The TMT–TTF is partially oxidized for charge-balance of the lead vacancies. The organic TMT–TTF layer and inorganic Pb–I layer arrange alternately, which provides efficient pathways for charge and carrier transfer between these layers. These structural features have a profound influence on electrical transport. The conductivity, photoconductivity and charge-carrier properties of the compound, along with the previously reported (TTF)Pb2I5 compound as a comparison, were evaluated preliminarily.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Compound 1 was obtained as black crystals using a solvothermal reaction through mixing a CH3CN solution of PbI2 and Bu4NI with a DMF solution of TMT–TTF and I2, and reacting at 80 °C for 3 days. The molecule I2 was indispensable, if I2 was not added, no black crystal could be obtained, but red crystals of TMT–TTF appeared. Though the Bu4N+ ion did not enter the compound, if Bu4NI was not added, only a black powder was obtained. Therefore the synthetic reaction occurred under a delicate balancing condition. Single crystals are hand-picked under a microscope for all measurements to ensure the phase purity and that the XRD pattern matches with that of the corresponding one simulated from the single-crystal X-ray data (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The crystals are air stable. The result of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the compound is stable until 200 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). The crystal loss of a neutral TMT–TTF molecule started at 210 °C and ended at 403 °C with 22.7% mass lost (calculated 23.0%). As a contrast, compound (TTF)Pb2I5 was synthesized using a previously reported method12 and the sample purity was verified by PXRD (Fig. S1, ESI†).
Single crystal X-ray diffractometry shows that compound 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group I2/m(12) and the asymmetric unit contains two Pb(II) atoms (Pb1 and Pb2), three I− anions and half a TMT–TTF moiety (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both Pb1 and Pb2 atoms are surrounded by six iodine atoms in a somewhat distorted octahedral environment (Fig. 1a) where the Pb1 atom is coordinated by all μ3-I atoms and the Pb2 atom is coordinated by four μ3-I and two μ2-I atoms. Three edge-sharing PbI6 octahedra form a subunit that links each other to construct a one-dimensional (1D) belt structure extending along the b axis (Fig. 1b). Such belt structures further stack along the a axis through edge-sharing to form a 2D corrugated PbI2 layer (Fig. 1b and c).

(c) Top-view of the 2-D structure. 

Fig. 2a clearly shows how TMT–TTF layers intercalate PbI2 slabs. The organic component TMT–TTF overlaps completely along the b axis to form an organic column. There are two different orientations of the TMT–TTF molecules that produce the observed disorder. Fig. 2b illustrates the sttrong π⋯π stacking of the TMT–TTFs within one column showing the S⋯S distances of 3.537 and 3.672 Å and C⋯C distance of 3.368 Å, less than the corresponding sum of van der Waals radii of S⋯S 3.70 Å and C⋯C 3.40 Å. The organic columns link each other along the a axis through S⋯S short contacts to form a 2D supramolecular organic layer structure (Fig. 3). The short contacts I⋯S and I⋯H–C contacts made the successful intercalation of TMT–TTF layers into PbI2 slabs. It is interesting to note that the packing structure of TMT–TTF is commensurate with the corrugated layer structure of PbI2 as per the orientation of the orange lines, as shown in Fig. 2a. Obviously, the formation of the corrugated layer structure of the PbI2 is attributed to the templating effect of the tetrakis(methylthio) of TMT–TTF.

Structural features of the intercalated compounds
Based on the structural analysis, the ratio of Pb:I in the title Pb–I polymer is 1:2. Now, a problem arises: if the inorganic polymer is neutral PbI2, then, the organic component should also be neutral. However, in the growth of single crystals, only when I2 was added, could black crystals be obtained. Some of the TTF moieties should be oxidized by I2 to form a radical cation,13 which indicates the presence of an anionic inorganic motif. Batail's group reported the first example of the crystal structure of a PbI2 intercalation compound, β-(EDT-TTF-I2)2[Pb5/6□1/6I2]3,10 where the inorganic polymer is the layered PbI2 with the negative charge due to the Pb vacancy and the intercalated organic component is the (EDT-TTF-I2)/(EDT-TTF-I2)˙+ pairs which are seriously disordered. According to the literature, Pb occupancy in 1 was released and refined in the final stage to yield a stoichiometry close to [Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2] (site occupancies: Pb1, 1.0; Pb2 (inversion center), 0.6). Therefore, the compound formula is (TMT–TTF)0.8˙+{[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3}0.8−. The radical character of the cation was confirmed by ESR and electronic spectra (vide infra). It is why the black crystals can only be obtained in the presence of I2. TMT–TTF was partially oxidized by I2 in the reaction. The formula of 1 is verified by the results of elemental analysis (see Experimental section) and TGA.
The remarkable structural feature of 1 is the existence of a layered PbI2 with a Pb vacancy (0.4 Pb per formula). Partial oxidation of TMT–TTF made it take on average 0.8 positive charges per cation. This is a second crystalline PbI2 intercalation compound being found with partially oxidized TTF molecules. Different from the reported planar hexagonal close-packed structure of the layered {[Pb5/6□1/6I2]3}− (Fig. 4a, a layered CdI2 type structure), {[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3}0.8− in 1 takes a corrugated layer structure with hexagonal close-packed edge-sharing steps (Fig. 1c). The anion structure of {[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3}0.8− is also different from that of a recently reported TTF cationic lead halide (TTF)Pb2I5, where [Pb2I5]− also takes a corrugated PbI layer but with corner shared steps (Fig. 4b and c).12 Besides the difference of the anion structures between the title compound 1 and the compound β-(EDT-TTF-I2)2[Pb5/6□1/6I2]3, for 1, there are various strong π⋯π interactions and S⋯S contacts within the TTF layers, I⋯S and I⋯H–C contacts between the organic layers and inorganic layers, which provides an efficient carrier transport pathway, but for the latter compound, only I⋯I interaction exists between the layers. Although these interactions were also found in (TTF)Pb2I5, no mixed valence exists for TTF cations. It is the structural feature of 1 that appears to exert a significant influence on electric and photoelectric properties of the material (vide infra).

Radical characters and redox properties

Fig. 5a and b display the UV-vis and NIR spectra for 1 as well as the starting material TMT–TTF. Compound 1 shows an intense full-range (up to 2000 nm) absorption for its mixed valence and radical features. It is a narrow band material with a band gap lower than 0.6 eV. The low-energy broad band at NIR is assigned as inter-layers and intermolecular charge-transfer transition between neutral TMT–TTF molecules and partially oxidized TMT–TTF+˙ cations. The radical character of crystalline sample 1 was proved by ESR analysis (Fig. 5c). A sharp signal at g = 2.005 confirms the presence of the radical cation species TTF+˙. Fig. 5d presents the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the compound along with that of the TMT–TTF. The parent compound TMT–TTF shows two typical reversible redox-waves corresponding to the TTF/TTF˙+ and TTF˙+/TTF2+ redox couples, with E1/2(1) at 0.56 V and E1/2(2) at 0.85 V vs. SCE (saturated calomel electrode). Compound 1 showed a broadened wave at 0.59 V due to the overlap of the E1/2(1) and the oxidation of the I− anion. The second oxidation E1/2(2) of 1 shifts to a lower potential (0.81 V) due to the anion (Pb–I) to cation (TMT–TTF) charge transfer.

Electric and photoelectric properties
It has been reported that the mixed valence systems have great influence on their electric properties due to the effective electronic coupling between the two redox state moieties.14 To investigate the electric and photoelectric properties of compound 1, a simple device was fabricated in which a layer of powder (crystals were ground into fine powder) was sandwiched in two ITO glasses. The conductivity of 1 is very high, 3.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 in the dark and an increase to 7.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 under irradiation from a 150 W xenon lamp, as calculated from the I–V character (Fig. 6a). As a comparison, the conductivities of (TTF)Pb2I5 was measured in the same way, with the results being 2.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 in the dark and 4.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 in the light (Fig. 6b), which are are one order of magnitude smaller than those of 1. Fig. 6c gives the photocurrent response properties of 1 along with those of(TTF)Pb2I5. A steady on–off current of 1 in the mA cm−2 scale is recorded, which showed the stability of the device. The photocurrent density of 1 is 1.7 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V bias, while that of (TTF)Pb2I5 is 0.3 mA cm−2. The better electric and photoelectric properties of 1 are attributed to the interactions among partially oxidized TMT–TTF cations and short contacts between the intercalated TMT–TTF layers and the PbI2 layers.

In order to understand the mechanism of the enhanced conductivity and obtain the band edge as well as the flat-band potentials for electrode material 1, potentiodynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with different frequencies was performed (see Experimental section). Fig. 6d presents the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots of electrode 1. The curves show that 1 is a p-type semiconductor. The flat-band potential (Efb) of the electrode was obtained from the plots by extrapolation to 1/Cs × Cs = 0. The calculated Efb value is 0.44 V (vs. NHE). The ECB and EVB are −4.78 eV and −5.38 eV (vs. vacuum level), respetively, estimated based on electronic spectra and MS plot.15 The carrier density of 1 is 2.5 × 1020 cm−3 obtained from the slope of the MS plot, larger than that of (TTF)Pb2I5 (1.2 × 1020 cm−3) (Fig. S4, ESI†). The carrier mobilty of 1 (2.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is estimated based on the MS plot and J–V measurements,16 higher than that of (TTF)Pb2I5 (1.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The mechanism of the enhanced conductivity is due to the increases of carrier concentration and mobility attributed to the partially oxidized TMT–TTF cations, π⋯π stacking and short contacts.
Conclusions
In summary, a TMT–TTF hybrid lead iodide compound, (TMT–TTF)[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3 (1), was obtained and characterized. Compound 1 is a rare TTF-intercalated 2-D hybrid lead iodide with partially oxidized TMT–TTF cations and Pb-vacancy in anion. There are efficient pathways for charge and carrier transfer via strong π⋯π interactions and S⋯S contacts among partially oxidized TMT–TTF cations and via I⋯S and I⋯H–C short contacts between the intercalated organic TMT–TTF layers and the inorganic PbI2 layers. ESR and UV-vis-NIR spectra confirm the radical character of crystalline sample 1. More intriguingly, compound 1 exhibits a narrow band gap and high conductivity. Its carrier density and photoelectric properties are better than those of the previously reported compound (TTF)Pb2I5. These results demonstrate the superiority of the layered PbI2 with partially oxidized TTF derivative layers to that with fully oxidized TTF˙+ layers. We believe that this research is helpful for the design of new photovoltaic materials, which encourages us to do further exploration.
Experimental
General remarks
TMT–TTF was prepared using a modified method previousl reported in the literature.17 All analytically pure reagents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. Elemental analyses (C, H and S) were performed using a VARIDEL III elemental analyzer. Solid-state room-temperature optical diffuse reflectance spectra of the microcrystal samples were obtained with a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer using BaSO4 as a standard reference. Thermoanalytical measurements were performed using a TGA-DCS 6300 microanalyzer, and the sample was heated under a nitrogen stream of 100 mL min−1 at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were obtained using a D/MAX-3C X-ray diffractometer with CuKα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were obtained at room temperature and using a Bruker ER-420 spectrometer with a 100 kHz magnetic field in X band. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed on a CHI600 electrochemistry workstation in a three-electrode system with a Pt plate working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the auxiliary electrode.
Preparation of compound (TMT–TTF)[Pb2.6/3□0.4/3I2]3
A solution of PbI2 (0.0125 mmol, 5.8 mg) and tetrabutylammonium iodide (Bu4NI) (0.0625 mmol, 2.3 mg) in 0.5 mL acetonitrile (CH3CN) was added into a solution of TMT–TTF (0.005 mmol, 2.0 mg) and iodine (0.0025 mmol, 0.6 mg) in 0.125 mL dimethylformamide (DMF). The reaction mixture was sealed in a Pyrex tube (7 mm dia., and 180 mm length) under ambient atmosphere and pressure. The tube was heated to 80 °C for 3 days. After cooling to room temperature, single crystals of 1 as black blocks were obtained and were used for all measurements (1.1 mg, yield: 35.4%). Anal. calcd for C10H12I6Pb2.6S8 (MW: 1688.77): C, 7.11; H, 0.72; S, 15.19%. Found: C, 7.25; H, 0.83; S, 15.25%. IR data (cm−1): 3445(b), 2983(w), 2914(m), 1632(m), 1418(s), 1305(s), 1122(w), 1050(w), 963(m), 882(s), 772(m), 693(w), 600(w).
X-ray crystallographic study
The crystal data were collected on a Bruker APEX-II CCD diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and Mo Kα (λ = 0.71075 Å) radiation was used to carry out the measurements at 120 K. SAINT was employed to process the data. An absorption correction (multi-scan) was applied for all these compounds. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-16 program and the refinements were performed against F2 using the SHELXL-16.18 Detailed crystal data and structural refinement parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
Electric and photoelectric response measurement
A simple device was assembled to detect the conductivity and photoelectric response properties of the materials. The electroactive layer is sandwiched between two ITO electrodes. The thickness of the active layer is about 100 μm and the effective irradiated area is 0.385 cm2 (Φ = 0.7 cm). Bias voltage at 0.5 V was applied on the device. A 150 W high-pressure xenon lamp, located 20 cm away from the surface of the ITO electrode, was employed as a full-wavelength light source.
Mott–Schottky plots
Mott–Schottky plots were generated by conducting impedance-frequency measurement. The capacitance of the semiconductor–electrolyte interface was collected at different frequencies from 500 to 3000 Hz. The measurement was conducted using a CHI650E electrochemistry workstation using a three-electrode system with an ITO glass working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a Pt plate as the auxiliary electrode. The working electrode was prepared according to the following process: 3 mg of compound was ground and dispersed in a solution containing 30 μL alcohol, which was then dip-coated and dried in air on a 7 × 7 mm area of a 10 × 40 mm ITO glass electrode. The supporting electrolyte solution was a 0.1 mol L−1 sodium sulfate aqueous solution.
