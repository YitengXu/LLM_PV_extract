    , Accepted 22nd January 2018First published on 22nd January 2018AbstractIn this work, we report on the first successful deposition of Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluoride (V-YOF) thin films on Si (100) wafers using pulsed liquid injection metal organic chemical vapor deposition (PLI-MOCVD). The formation of V-YOF has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements and electron probe microanalysis. The infrared phonon modes of V-YOF thin films and their corresponding optical constants as inferred from spectroscopic ellipsometry are reported here for the first time. The V-YOF thin films are featured by a broad absorption band centering around 370–373 cm−1; their refractive index is located between those of YF3 and Y2O3, and which shows an intimate relationship with the oxygen content in the film. The luminescence properties of Er3+ doped V-YOF thin films are finally examined and compared with that of YF3. Our results highlight that the as-deposited V-YOF thin films by PLI-MOCVD serve as promising candidates as efficient host material for spectral conversion for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
In order to improve the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells, possibly beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit,1 researchers have been trying to adapt the solar spectrum to match the absorption properties of the semiconductor devices via up-conversion (UC) or/and down-conversion (DC) processes.2–5 Such spectral conversion has proved to be an effective approach and is commonly achieved by applying a luminescent layer doped with lanthanide ions.6–8 Among the many host materials, yttrium trifluoride YF3 is one of the most promising matrices due to its wide optical transparency and low phonon energy which is desired for minimizing non-radiative losses and improving the luminescence efficiency.5 Compared to YF3, yttrium oxide Y2O3 as another important host material usually shows a larger phonon energy,9 while it is chemically and thermally more stable. Furthermore, Y2O3 exhibits a larger refractive index, which is essential in improving the fraction of photons emitted towards solar cells and thus ensuring a high conversion efficiency of the system as a DC layer situated in the solar cell front.2 Therefore, yttrium oxyfluorides combining the advantages of both fluorides and oxides are considered most promising materials and are being pursued. Among them, the Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluorides (V-YOF) with compositions of YnOn−1Fn+2 stand out as a promising family of materials. A few studies of V-YOF powders/nano-crystals doped with lanthanide ions have been recently reported.10–12 Compared to powders, however, V-YOF in its thin film form would be more adapted for photovoltaic applications, which nevertheless has not been reported in the literature.
Metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is one of the most common thin film deposition techniques, thanks to its versatility/reliability, conformal coverage, low-cost, high throughput and adaptability to large-scale depositions. In this work, we have used pulsed liquid injection metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (PLI-MOCVD) coupled with a patented liquid injector which delivers the liquid precursor in a fully controlled manner thus avoiding waste of precursor materials as in conventional CVD. PLI-MOCVD has previously been used to deposit high-quality phase-pure YF3 thin films.13 In this study, we present, for the first time, the successful deposition of V-YOF thin films on Si (100) wafers using PLI-MOCVD and investigate the various interesting aspects of the optical properties of V-YOF thin films. We report on the first infrared vibration and spectroscopic ellipsometry observations on V-YOF thin films; further, we examine the luminescence emission of V-YOF thin films doped by Er3+ ions in comparison with that of Er3+ doped YF3 thin films.
Experimental
Thin film deposition
Pure and Er3+-doped YF3 and yttrium oxyfluoride thin films were grown by pulsed liquid injection metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (PLI-MOCVD) on 2-inch Si (100) wafers at 590 °C. The precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving Ln(hfac)3 (hfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetonato-; Ln = Y, Er) in 15 mL 1,2-dimethoxyethane (monoglyme) with a total concentration of 0.05 M. Our patented pulsed liquid injector consists of high-speed electro-valves driven by a computer, allowing us to control the amount of solution injected during deposition by opening time, frequency, and number of pulses.14 The precursor solution was injected as micro-droplets into the evaporator and was vaporized. The vaporized precursor vapor was then carried by an O2/Ar gas flow into a vertical hot-wall reaction chamber to a hot substrate, where decomposition/reaction led to the film deposition.
Characterization techniques
The Bragg–Brentano (theta–2theta) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Bruker D8 Advance Series II diffractometer in the 2theta range of 20–65° using CuKα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). A JEOL-2010 LaB6 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 keV was used with the sample cross section prepared by tripod polishing followed by Ar ion milling. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was performed on a Cameca SX50 system equipped with a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer. The EPMA data were analyzed using the Stratagem program dedicated to the analysis of thin films.15 The surface morphologies were examined with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Quanta 250) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a Digital Instrument D3100 Nanoscope enabling multimode imaging with silicon tips (NanoWorld Arrow™ NC probes). The tapping mode was used to collect AFM images.
The infrared measurements were collected using a Thermo Fisher iS-50 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with an RT DLTGS detector and a solid Si beamsplitter in the normal incidence transmission mode. The spectra were measured in the range of 100–550 cm−1, with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and 64 spectra have been co-added. The infrared peak positions were resolved from spectra fitting using OMNIC software supplied by Thermo Fisher. The dispersion of optical constants was determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) using a Rotating Compensator Ellipsometry Wollam M2000 over a 254–1700 nm spectral range and three different incidence angles: 50, 60 and 70°. The optical model used for the fitting of the measured ellipsometric data was: air/surface roughness/film/interfacial SiO2/Si. As both V-YOF and YF3 are wide bandgap dielectrics and their optical bandgap (>5 eV) falls outside the measured spectral range, the Sellmeier dispersion law16 was used for modelling the optical constants of both V-YOF and YF3 thin films. The surface roughness of the films was modelled by the Bruggeman Effective Medium Approximation: 50% film + 50% air and the obtained values have been found to be in good agreement with the AFM measurements. The luminescence spectra were recorded with a Jobin Yvon/Horiba LabRam spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled device detector using the 488 nm line of an Ar+ laser as the excitation source (power 85 μW).
Results and discussion
Formation of yttrium oxyfluoride thin films by PLI-MOCVD
In our pulsed liquid injection metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (PLI-MOCVD) system, the oxygen partial pressure p(O2) can be changed by varying the O2/Ar ratio in the carrier gas flux or/and the total reactor pressure according to the following equation:p(O2) = c·pwhere c is the volumetric percentage ratio of O2 in the O2/Ar gas mixture and p is the total reactor pressure.
At a constant total reactor pressure p = 10 torr, three films were deposited at the O2 ratio of 40%, 60%, and 80%, corresponding to p(O2) of 4, 6, and 8 torr, respectively. A fourth film was deposited at p(O2) = 16 torr with p = 20 torr and c = 80%. The Bragg–Brentano XRD patterns of all four films are summarized in Fig. 1. At p(O2) ≤ 6 torr, the diffraction peaks of the as-deposited films match well with those of YF3 (blue vertical bars in Fig. 1). Thus, films deposited at lower p(O2) crystallize into a pure YF3 phase with the orthorhombic structure (Pnma space group), which is consistent with previous studies.13 Upon further increasing the p(O2) above 6 torr, the films grow into Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluorides (V-YOF) with orthorhombic symmetry as well. It should be noted that currently, there exist several V-YOF with the formula YnOn−1Fn+2 (n = 5–7),17–19 and the XRD patterns of Y6O5F8 and Y7O6F9 are reported to be almost identical.20,21 Neither XRD nor TEM (transmission electron microscopy) succeeded in assigning the exact film composition with a sufficiently high accuracy. Nonetheless, the elemental analysis performed on the yttrium oxyfluoride thin films by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) suggests the film composition to be Y6O4.7F8.6, closest to Y6O5F8. Y6O5F8 therefore serves as the model V-YOF throughout the discussions: for example, its powder diffraction file (PDF) is referenced in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Bragg–Brentano XRD patterns (with intensities shown in log scale) of films deposited at oxygen partial pressure p(O2) = 4, 6, 8, and 16 torr, respectively. The diffraction peak originating from the Si (100) wafer is indicated with a star while those corresponding to YF3 (Pnma, PDF 00-032-1431) and the Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluorides (Y6O5F8: Pcmb, PDF 04-011-5072) are marked with blue bars and red arrows, correspondingly. 
The representative crystal structure of Y6O5F8 adopting the Pcmb space group shows an elongated supercell a × 6b × c, where the values of a, b, and c are not far from those of YF3.12 The structural change from YF3 films to V-YOF films is accompanied with a clear modification of the morphology, as shown in Fig. 2. The V-YOF thin films developed triangular shaped grains with sharp edges while the YF3 films developed rectangular flat grains, although both grow in a columnar structure. The surface of the V-YOF film thus appears rougher with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness estimated around 32 nm from AFM images while the RMS roughness of the YF3 film is only about 14 nm. Further examination of the AFM images has revealed the presence of very small secondary crystallites on the surface of both YF3 and V-YOF films originating from secondary nucleation on the surface of existing films.

Infrared vibration properties of V-YOF thin films
The far infrared (IR) spectra (100–500 cm−1) of both V-YOF and YF3 thin films grown on Si substrates by PLI-MOCVD are presented in Fig. 3. The films obtained at lower p(O2) exhibit two prominent absorption peaks (shaded in grey in Fig. 3) characteristic of YF3, in good agreement with those reported in the literature,13,22,23 while the V-YOF thin films obtained at higher p(O2) show distinct spectral features characterized by a broad absorption band centered around 370–373 cm−1 (shaded in yellow in Fig. 3). Similarly broad infrared bands have been observed for the orthorhombic Vernier phase lutetium oxyfluoride, Lu10O9F12.24 The detailed infrared modes for each film are summarized in Table 1. The primitive cell of V-YOF contains a significant number of atoms (in the case of Y6O5F8, 76 atoms per unit cell are expected), making the factor group analysis complicated to realize. It is thus barely possible to assign the observed bands to the theoretically expected symmetry of the vibrational modes. Nevertheless, V-YOF can essentially be seen as starting with the fluorite structure of YF3 and inserting extra O atom rows following the Vernier effect.24 Further examinations reveal that the broad absorption band characteristic of V-YOF films can essentially be deconvoluted into three peaks (labelled A, B, and C) as shown in Fig. 4. The observed broad absorption bands of V-YOF can thus be understood as a comprehensive consequence involving both Y–F and Y–O vibrations.

More specifically, sub-bands A and C essentially correspond to the Y–F bond as in YF3 while sub-band B corresponds to the Y–O bond as in Y2O3.25–27 At p(O2) ≤ 6 torr, the film crystallizes into YF3 due to the lack of oxygen entering the film; when p(O2) > 6 torr, sufficient oxygen atoms enter the film which transforms the film into V-YOF. When comparing Fig. 4a and b, it is seen that the strength of sub-band B increases with increasing p(O2), which corresponds to a higher oxygen incorporation. The peak positions of sub-bands differ due to the varying contributions between Y–O and Y–F bonds, and as well to the in-built lattice strain due to oxygen incorporation. It is thus seen that FTIR not only works as an effective tool to distinguish V-YOF from YF3 thin films, but also works to monitor the oxygen incorporation in V-YOF films by examining the strength of sub-band B.
Spectroscopic ellipsometry investigation of V-YOF thin films
The refractive index dispersions of the four films are subsequently determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements as shown in Fig. 5. For the two YF3 films obtained at lower p(O2), the value of the refractive index is around 1.55–1.56, similar to those previously reported.13,28 The refractive index of the YF3 thin film deposited at p(O2) = 4 torr appears slightly higher than that of the second film obtained at p(O2) = 6 torr.
 Fig. 5  Dispersion curves of the refractive index for the four films deposited at p(O2) = 4, 6, 8, and 16 torr, respectively. 
This is possibly due to the slightly better crystallinity of the former film as evidenced in Fig. 1. The optical constants for V-YOF thin films are reported here for the first time, which are seen to be larger than those of YF3 but smaller than those of Y2O3 film (refractive index of Y2O3 is around 1.9).29,30 Moreover, the refractive index of V-YOF thin films shows a strong dependence on p(O2) during growth. It is seen that when p(O2) increases from 8 torr to 16 torr, the refractive index of the corresponding V-YOF film also increases. This is due to larger oxygen incorporation at higher oxygen partial pressure, which is consistent with the FTIR results discussed above. The strong dependence of the refractive index on the oxygen content in V-YOF thin films is similar to that observed for the silicon oxynitrides.31 The larger refractive index makes V-YOF thin films more advantageous to be integrated as a down-converting layer at the front of solar devices to maximize the fraction of photons emitted towards a cell, as pointed out by T. Trupke et al.2
Luminescence properties of Er3+ doped V-YOF thin films
The luminescence properties of V-YOF thin films doped with different Er3+ cationic concentrations were examined with a 488 nm excitation laser as shown in Fig. 6a. Green and red emissions, characteristic of Er3+ luminescence properties,32–34 occur in all Er3+ doped V-YOF films. Upon absorption of incident photons of 488 nm, Er3+ ions are excited from the 4I15/2 ground state to the 4F7/2 state and relaxed nonradiatively via multiphonon to the next lower lying 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 states, giving rise to green emissions of 520 nm and 550 nm, and red emission of 650 nm. The green emissions at 520 nm and 550 nm are attributed to the Er3+:2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and Er3+:4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions; the red emission around 650 nm is due to Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. As shown in Fig. 6b, the green emission increases up to 2 at% Er3+, the red one up to 2.5 at% Er3+ and then, both are followed by the quenching for higher Er3+ concentrations. As Er3+ concentration increases, the interactions between the Er3+ centers increase as well as the energy transfer between the Er3+ ions. However, at higher concentrations the energy loss in traps dominates due to the increased delocalization of the excitation. These effects result in an optimum Er3+-doping. The different Er3+ concentration dependence between green and red emissions should be related to the different concentration dependence between 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels.
 Fig. 6  (a) Luminescence emission spectra of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 at% Er3+ doped V-YOF thin films grown on Si (100) wafer excited at 488 nm. (b) Integrated red (4F9/2 → 4I15/2), green (2H11/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2), and total emission intensity as a function of Er3+ concentration. 
To illustrate the influence of the host material on the luminescence properties, an YF3 thin film doped with 1.5 at% Er3+ was prepared and its emission spectrum is compared to that of 1.5 at% Er3+ doped V-YOF shown in Fig. 7. One notices that the luminescence bands in the V-YOF film appear to be more broadened compared to the sharp bands in the YF3 film. The oxygen and fluorine anions in V-YOF suffer a stoichiometric deviation following the Vernier effect.35 The assorted array of O2− and F− ions in the supercell gives rise to several different Y3+ cation sites (for Y6O5F8, there are four Y3+ cation sites), providing alternative possibilities for the Er3+ ions replacing the original Y3+. As a consequence, the different sharp transitions overlap with each other resulting in the broadened emission bands in the Er3+ doped V-YOF films.

Conclusions
By increasing the oxygen partial pressure p(O2) above 6 torr during pulsed liquid injection metal organic chemical vapor deposition (PLI-MOCVD), we have succeeded in growing Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluoride (V-YOF) thin films on Si (100) wafers for the first time. The as-grown V-YOF thin films develop sharp triangular grains resulting in a high RMS roughness of 32 nm. The characteristic infrared absorption band of V-YOF thin films is identified as a broad band centering around 370–373 cm−1. This broad band can essentially be deconvoluted into three sub-bands: A and C correspond to the Y–F bond as in YF3, while B corresponds to the Y–O bond as in Y2O3 and is thus indicative of the oxygen incorporation in the film. As determined from spectroscopic ellipsometry, the dispersion of the refractive index of the V-YOF thin film is situated between that of YF3 and Y2O3. Consequently, the V-YOF thin films bear great potential to function as a suitable down-converting layer to be placed at the front surface of solar devices to maximize the fraction of photons emitted towards a cell. Moreover, the refractive index of V-YOF thin films increases with increasing oxygen content in the film. Finally, the Er3+ doped V-YOF thin films exhibit efficient luminescence emission which appears more broadened due to the presence of several different Y3+ cation sites. Our study opens up a new realm in developing V-YOF thin films using a vapor-based deposition technique that can be easily compatible with a solar cell fabrication process and highlights the great potential of using V-YOF thin films as a spectral conversion layer in the photovoltaic field.

 	Fig. 1  Bragg–Brentano XRD patterns (with intensities shown in log scale) of films deposited at oxygen partial pressure p(O2) = 4, 6, 8, and 16 torr, respectively. The diffraction peak originating from the Si (100) wafer is indicated with a star while those corresponding to YF3 (Pnma, PDF 00-032-1431) and the Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluorides (Y6O5F8: Pcmb, PDF 04-011-5072) are marked with blue bars and red arrows, correspondingly.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Top scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and bottom atomic force microscopy (AFM, 1 × 1 μm2) images of Vernier phase yttrium oxyfluoride (V-YOF) thin film. (b) Top SEM and bottom AFM (1 × 1 μm2) images of YF3 thin film. For each film, the cross section TEM image is shown in the inset and root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is indicated.	 

 	Fig. 3  Far infrared (IR) spectra of the four films deposited at p(O2) = 4, 6, 8, and 16 torr, respectively. The most prominent features of YF3 films are shaded in grey while that of V-YOF films are shaded in yellow.	 

 	Fig. 4  Deconvolution of the broad peak centering around 370–373 cm−1 characteristic of V-YOF films grown at (a) p(O2) = 8 torr and (b) p(O2) = 16 torr. The sub-bands labelled A and C correspond to Y–F vibration modes while sub-band B corresponds to the Y–O vibration mode.
