1. Introduction
Human beings have had a long history of utilizing solar energy since the discovery of solar drying by ancient, uncivilized people. As one of the green, clean and sustainable energy resources, solar energy is still attracting worldwide attention by providing about 120000 TW annually to the Earth. Such an enormous energy source might be the solution to the increasing energy consumption, which could increase to 27 TW by 2050 and will probably reach 43 TW by 2100, in comparison to the current level of 15 TW.1,2 The energy crisis, along with environmental deterioration and climate change caused by fossil fuel combustion, has propelled technological developments for versatile solar energy applications. Two main categories, e.g. solar thermal and photovoltaic systems, have been operated in industrial processes. The first system includes solar water heating, steam generation, solar drying and dehydration, solar refrigeration, and air-conditioning, while the latter is represented by building-integrated photovoltaic, solar electricity for industry, and the solar-powered water desalination industry.3,4 Such applications are mainly based on physical processes.
It is anticipated that solar-induced chemical processes would be able to greatly extend the application fields. This assumption can be verified by natural photosynthesis, which has literally populated the Earth with creatures by converting carbon dioxide and water to green plants by harvesting sunlight.5 Mimicking natural photosynthesis, i.e. artificial photosynthesis, led to the discovery of photocatalysis at the beginning of the 1970s. Japanese scientists, Fujishima and Honda, reported that water could be split to produce hydrogen and oxygen under irradiation when TiO2 was used as a semiconductor electrode.6 Once the semiconductor particles were used, numerous micro photoelectrochemical cells were formed on the surface to carry out chemical reactions based on the effective separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs.7 As a result, heterogeneous photocatalysis appeared to be a promising alternative to photoelectrochemical catalysis.
In typical photocatalysis processes, semiconductor photocatalysts, such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, CdS, and ZnS, are initially activated by incoming photons provided by either ultraviolet (UV) or visible-light irradiation. Once the photon energy is equal to or is higher than that of the band-gap energy of the semiconductor photocatalysts, electrons can be activated from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductors, leaving positively charged holes in the VB. The photoinduced electron–hole pairs will migrate to the surface of the particles, undergoing bulk and surface recombination, and then react with the reactants on the surface. The redox potentials of the carriers are determined by the band structure, i.e. the positions of the VB (oxidation potential) and CB (reduction potential).8 Such a principle for heterogeneous photocatalysis processes has derived a variety of applications.
The historic milestones in photocatalysis are briefly summarized here and the main fields are schematically shown in Scheme 1. Photocatalysis was firstly discovered in 1972 for artificial photosynthesis by splitting of water for hydrogen production.6 The photocatalytic oxidation ability was then utilized for the oxidation or decomposition of toxic organics in contaminated water, air, or soils.9,10 Following the idea of water reduction, the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide was reported in 1979, demonstrating a novel route for converting CO2 to hydrocarbons (or CO).11 In 1988, Yamagata et al. reported the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols on TiO2, in which oxygen participated in a radical chain mechanism in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde, opening an avenue for selective oxidation of organics.12 In 1991, gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons on TiO2 and ZnO surfaces was reported by Anpo and co-workers.13 Inorganic ions or metal ions could also be removed by photocatalysis.14,15 The photo-induced hydrophilicity has enabled the application of photocatalysis as a self-cleaning technology for developing building materials.16 In fact, this technology is the only one that has been commercialized on a reasonably large scale. Moreover, the most historic applications of photocatalysis were observed on the classical photocatalyst, titanium dioxide.17
 Scheme 1  Main applications of photocatalysis. 
The wide applications of photocatalysis in hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, degradation, synthesis, and self-cleaning in the 1970s and 1980s had paved sound fundamentals, leading to a number of excellent review papers being published in the 1990s. Legrini et al.18 reviewed different photochemical processes for water treatment, and indicated that the presence of TiO2 under UV can lead to similar degradation to those with oxidants, such as H2O2 or O3. Kamat19 discussed the photochemistry on nonreactive and reactive surfaces of semiconductors, providing the surface activation and charge transfer processes and the induced photocatalytic degradation mechanism. Fox and Dulay20 discussed the mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis with particular attention to catalyst preparation, surface group conversion, and surface reactions in photocatalysis. Using TiO2 as a typical photocatalyst, a more comprehensive mechanistic discussion was provided by Linsebigler and coworkers.8 The band structure, photoexcitation, separation and migration of photoinduced charges, surface adsorption, photochemistry, and the modification of TiO2 surfaces were introduced. Hoffmann et al.21 presented an excellent review on the environmental applications of semiconductor photocatalysis, with a focus on the reaction kinetics of photocatalysis for the removal of aqueous and gaseous pollutants. Later on, more review papers, focusing on environmental applications of photocatalysis, appeared.22–24 With the above-mentioned reviews, a knowledge base and application implications had been well established. The practical application of photocatalysis was believed to be restricted by the low efficiency of the photocatalyst, i.e. TiO2. Thereafter, the adventure of photocatalysis was navigated to the development of new photocatalyst materials.
Traditional wide-band-gap semiconductors, such as TiO2 (3.2 eV for anatase),8,21,25,26 and ZnO (3.3 eV),27–29 can only absorb UV light, which possesses less than 4% solar energy. Also, ZnO is unstable and will undergo photo-corrosion, resulting in Zn-leaching into water.30 For more efficient utilization of solar energy, visible light having around 42% solar spectrum energy should be used. Therefore, narrow-band-gap semiconductors, such as Cu2O (ref. 31, 32) and α-Fe2O3,33,34 can be used. However, these photocatalyst materials are unstable and usually have a low activity. Metal sulfides are also well known for their photo-corrosion.35–38 After more than four-decades of studies, TiO2 has so far been the most popular photocatalyst. It is discouraging that, as claimed by Ma et al.,39 TiO2 has not been suitable for practical applications and will not be in the near future. Thus, new photocatalysts are still urgently needed.
In this review, a comprehensive survey of photocatalyst materials was made. Scheme 2 shows the content of research activity in photocatalyst development. Comparative studies on graphitic carbon nitride with titanium dioxide and their associated photocatalysis reactions were carried out. Particular attention was then paid to a novel metal-free photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride, its modifications for visible-light photocatalysis and emerging elemental photocatalysts. Therefore, this article can be both a tutorial to fundamental photocatalysis and a critical comment on the most recent progress in metal-free photocatalysts.

2. Metal-based photocatalysts
2.1. TiO2 and modified TiO2 counterparts
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a typical semiconductor having three main crystalline structures, i.e. brookite, anatase and rutile. Anatase TiO2, with a band-gap energy of 3.2 eV, has been believed to possess a higher photocatalytic activity than rutile, while brookite shows the lowest efficiency. It is known that most milestones in photocatalysis were made with TiO2.6,9–12,14,15 As with any other semiconductor photocatalyst, TiO2 undergoes photoexcitation, charge separation and surface reactions in a typical photocatalytic process. As a result, enhanced TiO2 photocatalysis can be achieved by modulating the material to control each step and a variety of modification methods have been undertaken.
Surface modification was firstly proven to be effective. Noble metals, such as Pt, Au, Pd, Rh, and Ag, can be deposited on a TiO2 surface;40–42 therefore, charge separation can be promoted for enhanced photocatalysis. Surface or dye sensitization applies an organic sensitizer to absorb more photons for activating and injecting more electrons to the semiconductor to achieve a higher efficiency. It was reported that some dyes, such as erythrosin B, thionines, and different Ru(bpy)32+ compounds, can be used as effective sensitizers to harvest visible light for photocatalysis.43–45 Coupling another narrower band-gap semiconductor to TiO2 could integrate the advantages of surface modification and sensitization by harvesting more photons and inhibiting the recombination of photoinduced charges. Spanhel et al.46 reported that illuminated CdS can inject electrons into the attached TiO2, indicating a newly created visible-light response. It has been demonstrated that metal sulfides, such as CdS,47 MoS2, and WS2,48 and some metal oxides,49 can make TiO2 respond to visible light more efficiently.
Compositional modification, i.e. heteroatom doping, is also expected to have a profound influence on TiO2 photocatalysis. Initially, transition-metal ions were extensively employed as dopants for TiO2. The introduction of metal ions can lead to the formation of new energy levels in the band-gap and can sometimes reduce the recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs.14,50 Although extensive studies on transition-metal51–53 or rare earth54–56-doped titania have been conducted and reported, some disadvantages of metal doping have been experienced. For example, the thermal stability of the doped ions is poor. Also, the newly created energy bands can act as recombination centres, leading to decreased quantum efficiencies.
Non-metal-doped TiO2 has attracted extensive attention due to induced visible-light photocatalysis, which can utilize 42% of the solar spectrum energy compared to less than 4% of ultraviolet light (UV). In 2001, Asahi et al.57 reported the synthesis of nitrogen-doped TiO2 and its application in visible-light photocatalysis. Inspired by this excellent work, numerous studies on nitrogen doping have thus been conducted and reported.26,58–62 Based on heteroatom doping, co-doping with nitrogen by metals63,64 or non-metals65–67 has been explored. Carbon-doped titania has been also investigated. In 2002, Khan et al.68 found that carbon-doped titania showed strong absorption of visible light and that C-doping would induce enhanced photocatalysis. Carbon-doped TiO2 photocatalysts prepared by different methods and their different applications,25,69–71 as well as co-doping studies with other elements,66,72–74 were then reported. Besides nitrogen or carbon doping, other elements, such as sulfur,75–77 phosphorus,78–80 boron,81–84 and halogen elements,85–87 were also employed to synthesize visible-light-driven TiO2 photocatalysts. After extensive studies, TiO2 was proposed to be the most suitable candidate for practical applications.17,39
2.2. ZnO and other metal oxide photocatalysts
ZnO has a wide band-gap energy of 3.3 eV, close to that of anatase TiO2, and has also been demonstrated as an efficient photocatalyst.13,30,46,88,89 In fact, ZnO could show a higher photocatalytic activity than TiO2,88,89 yet the stability is poor due to photo-corrosion.90,91 For improving the stability, enhancing the photocatalytic activity, and extending the absorption to the visible-light region, a variety of modifications, such as semiconductor coupling,92–95 noble metal-,28,96–98 transition metal-,27,99,100 or non-metal doping,29,101,102 have been employed. In addition to the most popular photocatalysts, TiO2 and ZnO, some other metal-oxide semiconductors have demonstrated effective photocatalysis. Hou et al.103 reported that β-Ga2O3 shows efficient photodegradation of gaseous benzene in air under UV light, at one order of magnitude higher than that over P25. Wang et al.104 observed the photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3 for water splitting, which can be significantly enhanced by tailoring the α–β junction. Faust et al.105 firstly reported that α-Fe2O3 can act as an efficient photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of SO2 in water. Further studies showed that this can be a promising photocatalyst for water splitting and organics degradation via photocatalysis.106–108 Due to the lower band-gap energy and the more negative conduction band position, Cu2O has been employed as an efficient photocatalyst for photoreduction, i.e. splitting of water for hydrogen production.31,32 Other metal oxides, such Ta2O5,88,109 Bi2O3,110,111 and WO3,112,113 have demonstrated promising photocatalytic performances in various applications.
2.3. Complex metal oxides and single-site photocatalysts
Involving two or more metals in semiconductors would make it easier to modulate the band structures, e.g. band-gap energy and the positions of the VB and CB, therefore achieving the desired photocatalysis. In 2001, Zou et al.114 reported that In1−xNixTaO4 (x = 0–0.2) can induce direct water splitting into stoichiometric amounts of O2 and H2 under visible-light irradiation with a quantum yield of 0.66%. Some other compounds, such as AgInW2O8, CaBi2O4, BiWO6, and Zn2GeO4, were also developed by the group.115–118 Our group has prepared BiTaO4, InTaO4, and other bi-metallic oxides for the photodegradation of gaseous organic pollutants.119–121 Once the isolated and tetrahedrally coordinated metal oxide moieties, for example, Ti, W, Cr, Mo, or V oxides, are located in the silica-based zeolites or similar porous materials, single-site photocatalysts can be produced.122 Anpo et al.123,124 prepared Ti-, V-, and Cr-oxide single-site photocatalysts and isolated them within zeolite frameworks. Their photocatalytic activities were evaluated in the decomposition of NOx or CO2 conversion. The novel photocatalysis mechanism was also discussed. Recently, metal–organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts have also been developed, yet the stability issues still require to be addressed in further studies.125
2.4. Metal sulfides and nitrides (or oxynitrides)
In the pursuit of visible-light photocatalysis that cannot be realized on wide-band-gap metal oxides, such as TiO2 and ZnO, metal sulfides have been employed as alternative photocatalyst materials. CdS has a band-gap energy of around 2.4 eV and can harvest visible light with an absorption threshold of about 520 nm.126 In 1983, Aruga et al.127 reported that CdS can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light photocatalysis using the sulfite anion as a hole scavenger. To avoid photo-corrosion, CdS has frequently been applied in the form of hybrid photocatalysts for hydrogen production.128–131 With proper modification or hybridization, CdS has been also used for the photodegradation of organic pollutants in water.132–134 ZnS has proven to be a good photocatalyst owing to the rapid generation of electron–hole pairs and its excellent reduction potential for hydrogen production and CO2 conversion.135,136 The photodegradation of organic pollutants in water was also investigated.137,138 Bulk MoS2 is not a good photocatalyst, while nanoscaled MoS2 can exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity.139 Other metal sulfides, such as WS2,140 NiS,141 CuS,142 In2S3,142 Ag2S,143 and some complex sulfides, such as A2(I)–Zn–A(IV)–S4 (A(I) = Cu and Ag; A(IV) = Sn and Ge),144 CuInS2,145 and Zn1−xCdxS,146 have demonstrated their photocatalytic activities in a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Hitoki et al.147 reported that Ta3N5 can be an efficient photocatalyst, responding to visible light and producing hydrogen and oxygen from water splitting. Ma et al.148 observed enhanced water oxidation on a Ta3N5 photocatalyst that was modified by alkaline metal salts. Lee et al.149 reported that Ge3N4 can be used for overall water splitting. In addition, metal oxynitrides, such as TaON (ref 150) and ZnxTiOyNz,151 have also been investigated as visible-light photocatalysts.
2.5. Noble metal-based plasmonic photocatalysts
Some novel photocatalysts appeared to initiate further exploration of photocatalysis mechanisms. In 2005, Tian and Tatsuma152 investigated plasmon-induced photo-electrochemistry in the visible-light region on Au–TiO2 composites, and found that gold nanoparticles can be photo-excited due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Charge separation can occur when electrons are transferred from gold nanoparticles to the TiO2 conduction band, and then the induced photocatalysis can oxidize organics. The associated mechanism is schematically shown in Fig. 1.152 Chen et al.153 prepared several metal-oxide-supported Au nanoparticles, such as Au/ZrO2, Au/Fe2O3, Au/CeO2, and Au/SiO2, and efficient photodegradation of gas pollutants was achieved under sunlight. In 2008, Awazu et al.154 proposed that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 might be improved by the assistance of the near-field amplitudes of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) of silver nanoparticles. Wang et al.155 described the synthesis of Ag@AgBr and proposed it as a highly active plasmonic photocatalyst with a visible-light response. An et al.156 reported the facile synthesis of AgCl:Ag plasmonic nanoparticles as photocatalysts. The prepared materials showed efficient degradation of organics under sunlight, and the activity was ascribed to the strong SPR of metallic Ag components. The plasmonic photocatalysis can be used for degradation, hydrogen production, and chemical synthesis.157–170 Plasmonic photocatalysis has offered new opportunities for this field, and more mechanistic aspects are covered in previous review papers.171–174

3. Metal-free graphitic carbon nitride
The scarcity in nature and toxic metal-leaching from photo-corrosion were considered to be significant barriers for metal-based photocatalysts with respect to practical applications.175 A non-metal or metal-free photocatalyst, for example, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), has been proposed as a promising candidate. Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride only contains the non-metal, earth-abundant elements, carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen.176,177 It has been believed to be the most stable allotrope among CxNy, due to it having a similar layered structure to graphene. Carbon nitride has demonstrated extensive applications in various catalytic reactions;178,179 g-C3N4 is a polymeric semiconductor with a band-gap energy of 2.7 eV, a unique structure and remarkable physicochemical properties.180 In 2009, Wang et al.181 observed efficient hydrogen production for the first time from visible-light photocatalysis on g-C3N4 and the quantum efficiency was 0.1% under irradiation at 420–460 nm. The crystal structure and optical properties of g-C3N4 are shown in Fig. 2. The low activity can be ascribed to several aspects, such as the high excitation energy, the low charge mobility of the polymer compared to metals or oxides, the low surface area (2–10 m2 g−1), and poor absorption at longer wavelengths.182 Therefore, a number of modification approaches have been applied to improve the photocatalytic activity. Shalom et al.183 reported an ordered, hollow carbon nitride structure using a cyanuric acid–melamine complex as the precursor. Enhanced photocatalysis for the degradation of organic pollutants was then achieved.

Recently, a number of excellent review papers on graphitic carbon nitride have been published. Wang et al.184 summarized modification methods for varying the band structures of g-C3N4 by doping and copolymerization, and approaches for creating porous structures. The catalyst materials were evaluated in the photochemical splitting of water and some organic oxidation and dehydrogenation reactions. Zheng et al.185 presented a perspective on the synthesis of g-C3N4 with controllable structures and morphologies, and indicated a promising future for environmental remediation, energy conversion and storage. Zhu et al.186 reviewed the synthesis of g-C3N4 and presented discussions on its applications as a metal-free catalyst for NO decomposition, a support for differentiating oxygen activation sites, a functional material for nanomaterial synthesis, and a photocatalyst. Zheng et al.187 published a review on the synthesis and modification of tailored g-C3N4 photocatalysts, mainly for water splitting. Electronic structure modulation, nanostructure design, crystal-structure engineering, and heterostructure construction were analyzed and discussed. Zhao et al.188 categorized g-C3N4-based nanocomposites as: metal-free heterojunction, g-C3N4/single metal oxide (sulfide), g-C3N4/composite oxide, g-C3N4/halide, g-C3N4/noble metal, and g-C3N4-based complex system. The associated mechanisms of the unique function of the p–n junction, the Schottky junction, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect, photosensitization, and superconductivity were also discussed. Cao et al.189 reviewed the design and synthesis of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts, including the development of pristine g-C3N4, bandgap engineering, and g-C3N4-based semiconductor composites. Emphasis was placed on enhanced photocatalysis by carbon materials, non-noble-metal cocatalysts, and Z-scheme heterojunctions. With this specific focus, Dong et al.190 discussed exfoliation strategies for the synthesis of two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets, such as thermal oxidation exfoliation, ultrasonic exfoliation, chemical exfoliation, and some other approaches. Zhang et al.191 reviewed more synthesis methods of g-C3N4 nanosheets, for example, top-down delamination and bottom-up assembly of molecular building blocks. Yin et al.192 concentrated on the progress made in enhancing hydrogen evolution activity by loading noble-metal-free co-catalysts, exfoliation, and their extended applications in photocatalytic O2 evolution and CO2 reduction. Yang et al.193 paid particular attention to the structural modification of g-C3N4 using soft (surfactants and block copolymers, ionic liquids, and gas bubbles) or hard templates (silica, anodic alumina oxide, carbon) or biotemplates.
Very recently in 2016, Ong et al.194 presented an excellent review summarizing the research progress of the design and synthesis of g-C3N4-based materials. The physiochemical properties, such as band structure, electronic properties, optical features, and separation of charges of the hybrid photocatalysts, were analyzed based on DFT calculations. The applications and the future of the g-C3N4-based photocatalysts in water splitting and CO2 reduction and environmental remediation were discussed. Luo et al.195 reviewed recent research advances in 2D materials for the application of photocatalysis, of which g-C3N4 is a typical metal-free photocatalyst. Graphitic carbon nitride was also introduced in a tutorial review as a metal-free photocatalyst for water splitting, and other carbonaceous materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, were also discussed.196 For solar fuel production, Low et al.197 reviewed the progress of photocatalytic CO2 reduction by 2D carbon-based materials, including g-C3N4. Mamba and Mishra198 focused on the environmental remediation capacities of g-C3N4 nanocomposites and discussed their photocatalytic degradation mechanisms. Jiang et al.199 discussed the enhancement of catalytic activity and the oxidative ability of g-C3N4 and claimed that the former is controlled by nanostructure design and hybridization, and that the latter is tailored by valence band modulation. The tuned properties of g-C3N4 were expected to be beneficial for energy conversion and environmental remediation.
In this review, the scope will be restricted to metal-free materials, namely structure-modified or non-metal-doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts, or composites with nanocarbons. Some interesting elemental photocatalysts will be introduced. For tutorial purposes, metal-involved g-C3N4 will be briefly mentioned.
3.1. Structural modification

3.1.1. Hard templating. 
It is well known that a higher specific surface area (SSA) of catalysts can provide more active sites on the surface for enhanced catalysis. For pristine g-C3N4, it is unfortunate that the surface area is usually lower than 10 m2 g−1. Modification on g-C3N4 began with the creation of a porous structure and the increase of SSAs. Table 1 lists the templating methods and the resulting textural properties of various g-C3N4 catalysts. Hong et al.200 employed SiO2 nanoparticles as a hard template and obtained mesoporous g-C3N4 with a high surface area of 128 m2 g−1, while the unmodified compound had a low BET surface area around 12 m2 g−1. Zhao et al.201 reported the synthesis of mesoporous carbon nitride nanorods using SBA-15 as the template and hexamethylenetetramine as the precursor. A super-high specific surface area of 971–1124 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume of 1.31–1.79 cm3 g−1 were achieved. In another study, calcium carbonate was used as a template to prepare porous g-C3N4, and the resulting BET surface area was 31.8 m2 g−1, about 3 times higher than for the pristine compound. Also, about a 4–7.5 times higher photocurrent was obtained.202 Liang et al.203 reported a macroscopic 3D porous g-C3N4 monolith produced by thermal polymerization of urea inside an unique template of melamine sponge (MS), normally found in the kitchen. The SSA and pore volume of the material were determined to be 78 m2 g−1 and 0.76 cm3 g−1, respectively. With the fabrication of a silica-templated g-C3N4 for hydrogen evolution, Li et al.204 suggested that the limited photoactivity of g-C3N4 is mainly due to slow charge mobility, as with other polymeric semiconductors, and that structural modification should be beneficial with respect to improving the electronic properties.

3.1.2. Soft templating. 
Pluronic P123 was applied as a soft template to prepare g-C3N4 with worm-like pores and a narrow pore size distribution, and the BET surface area was increased to 90 m2 g−1.211 Zhang et al.212 reported the synthesis of a sponge-like structure of graphitic carbon nitride via biopolymer-activation through soft-templating, using seaweed polysaccharide or gelatin. The control material of pristine g-C3N4 had a low BET surface area of 10 m2 g−1, while a 6 times higher BET surface area (63 m2 g−1) was achieved by the soft-templating synthesis. The increased BET surface area can improve the photoelectrochemical activity; however, the sample with the highest BET surface area does not promise the highest activity. This is because an increase in the surface area of g-C3N4 can lead to the deterioration of the crystalline structure, with more defects, which will cause high recombination of photoinduced electron/hole pairs. Moreover, it was found that soft-templating-induced samples have a relatively lower BET value compared to those from hard templates.


3.1.3. Template-free. 
Han et al.217 reported that the BET surface area of g-C3N4 can be increased to ca. 210 m2 g−1 by a facile template-free method controlling the polymer reaction according to Le Chatelier's principle. In the synthesis, a semi-closed system was applied to partially expose the polymerization to air. Partial oxidation can be also employed as a post-treatment of g-C3N4. Niu et al.218 reported that the BET surface area of g-C3N4 could be increased to 306 m2 g−1 when it was exfoliated to nanosheets by a simple top-down method of thermal oxidation etching of bulk g-C3N4 in air. Manipulation of the synthesis without a template appears to be effective for improving the textural properties of g-C3N4. Recently, mesoporous g-C3N4 nanomesh with an atomic thickness was fabricated by solvothermal exfoliation of the mesoporous sample.221 It was found that the structural modification could effectively tune the energy levels, charge mobility, light absorption, and surface active sites. With the modified properties, the prepared g-C3N4 nanomesh was able to continuously produce hydrogen from water for 30 h at a rate of 8510 μmol h−1 g−1, under visible light of λ > 420 nm. The activity was 5.5 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart, and 24.3 fold compared to traditional bulk carbon nitride. She et al.222 reported the template-free synthesis of 2D porous ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets. Enhanced photocatalytic performances were shown in photocatalytic water splitting and photodegradation to be 5.2 and 71 times higher, respectively.
Introducing salts in the synthesis has proven to be effective for the creation of a porous structure of g-C3N4. Ma et al.223 developed an in situ ion-assisted synthesis of porous g-C3N4 nanosheets, in which lithium chloride was used to produce a porous sample with 2–3 nm pores and 2–3 nm thickness, and a high surface area of 186.3 m2 g−1.
It can be seen that all the soft- or hard-templating and template-free approaches can be applied to prepare porous g-C3N4 with an enlarged BET surface area and pore volume. Because of the mechanical strength and stability in the polymerization of g-C3N4 precursors, hard-templating can generally produce better textural properties than soft-templating and template-free protocols. The improved porous structure from the structural modification will be able to enhance the adsorptive, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical properties of g-C3N4 materials. It is noteworthy that the normalized performance (to surface area) of the porous g-C3N4 is usually lower than that of pristine g-C3N4. This is different from metal-based catalysts. It was suggested that the key parameter of g-C3N4 in determining the photocatalytic activity is not the surface area and pore volume, but the charge mobility and separation rate.204 Lin et al.224 reported that crystalline g-C3N4 with tri-s-triazine subunits derived from a tri-s-triazine-based precursor and KCl and LiCl salts possessed improved crystallinity and enhanced charge carrier mobility, and showed higher photocatalytic hydrogen production.

3.2. Shape-control synthesis
In metal-based catalysis, for example, involving noble metals225 and metal oxides,226 it has been well established that the shape of the catalyst represents the exposed crystal facet, which can be a key parameter in manipulating the catalysis performance. In the synthesis of g-C3N4, in addition to 2D nanosheets, a number of other shapes were fabricated. Fig. 3 shows a number of different shapes of g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Liu et al.227 reported that uniform g-C3N4 nanorods (200 nm long and 80 nm wide) can be fabricated by a morphology-preserving route using SiO2 nanorods as the template. The morphology is shown in Fig. 3(a). The BET surface area of the nanorods was determined to be 52 m2 g1, about twice that of the bulk g-C3N4. Blue-shift and suppressed charge recombination were observed with the nanorods. Transformation to g-C3N4 nanorods from nanoplates was carried out by a simple reflux method.228 Since the BET surface area was not significantly increased, the enhanced photocatalysis was ascribed to an increase in the active lattice face and the removal of surface defects.
 Fig. 3  Shape-controlled g-C3N4 photocatalysts, (a) nanorods,227 (b) nanospheres,229 (c) helix,230 and (d) flower.231 

Fig. 3(b) shows g-C3N4 nanospheres composed of nanosheets that were prepared by a templating route using KCC-1 silica spheres as sacrificial templates.229 A high BET surface area of 160 m2 g−1 for the nanospheres was obtained, compared to 9 m2 g−1 of bulk g-C3N4. Excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was observed owing to the improved mass transfer and better charge separation originating from the structural benefits. A template-free synthesis of g-C3N4 microspheres was developed using a solvothermal method with melamine and cyanuric chloride as the precursors.232 The porous structure, narrowed band gap and lowered resistance were proposed to originate from enhanced H2 production. Jun et al.233 reported the synthesis of carbon nitride hollow spheres by melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular aggregation. Stronger optical absorption, a widened band gap, and an increase in the lifetime of the charges worked together to achieve 10 times higher photodegradation over the g-C3N4 hollow spheres. Open-structured microspheres of g-C3N4 with a hierarchically ordered porous structure, modified absorbance and electronic properties were prepared by Huang et al.,234 and the photocatalysts demonstrated enhanced photocatalysis. Under λ > 420 nm visible-light irradiation, the best catalyst showed a hydrogen evolution rate of 392 μmol h−1, compared to 27 μmol h−1 on a bulk sample.
Zheng et al.230 reported the preparation of helical g-C3N4 with a twisted hexagonal rod-like morphology via nanocasting with chiral SiO2 templates. The morphology is shown in Fig. 3(c). It was suggested that the helical nanoarchitectures are able to promote charge separation and mass transfer to obtain better water splitting and CO2 reduction.

Fig. 3(d) displays a flower-like structure, which is mainly composed of 2D nanosheets/plates.231 As phosphorous doping was involved, it was difficult to judge whether the unique structure contributed to the hydrogen evolution performance.
It can be seen that the shape-controlled synthesis of g-C3N4 can be achieved with or without a template. Also, no significant changes in crystalline structure were observed and, in general, the enhanced photocatalysis was suggested to originate from the structural benefits. This is comparable to the creation of a porous structure for g-C3N4. Moreover, improved charge transfer and mass transfer, as well as tailored optical properties, were present in the morphology-controlled g-C3N4. The preferred exposed facets for enhanced catalysis on metals or metal oxides do not occur here.226
3.3. Heteroatom doping

3.3.1. Metal doping. 
Doping heteroatoms into TiO2 has been extensively proven to be an effective strategy to extend the light absorption and to enhance the photocatalytic performance.61,62,74 This technique has also been employed to modify g-C3N4. Fe-Doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets were prepared by Tonda et al.,235 using ferric chloride as the Fe-precursor. The Fe dopant appeared to be in the +3 oxidation state and could significantly influence the electronic and optical properties of g-C3N4. It was reported that 2 mol% Fe-doped g-C3N4 showed almost 7 times and 4.5 times higher activity compared to unmodified g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 nanosheets, respectively. Potassium-doped g-C3N4 was prepared by the thermal polymerization of dicyandiamide and KI. It was found that the doped potassium can enhance the photocatalytic activity by lowering the valence band and increasing the charge separation rate.236 Besides, Zr-doped and W-doped g-C3N4 were also developed for enhanced photocatalysis.237,238


3.3.2. Non-metal doping. 
In consideration of the metal-free nature of the modified g-C3N4, non-metal doping has attracted more extensive attention. Moreover, as demonstrated with doped TiO2 or other metal oxide photocatalysts, non-metal doping can also avoid the thermal variation of chemical states of doped metal ions.57,62,64,74,87
3.3.2.1. Oxygen doping. 
Following the idea of heteroatom doping, a variety of dopants of non-metal elements have demonstrated great effectiveness for g-C3N4-based photocatalysis. Table 2 summarizes non-metal-doped carbon nitride photocatalysts and their physiochemical properties, as well as photocatalytic performances.

Oxygen-doped g-C3N4 was prepared by a hydrothermal route using H2O2 as the dopant precursor.239 XPS studies showed that oxygen was doped into the lattice and then formed N–C–O, leading to significant changes in the physicochemical properties. Accordingly, enhanced photodegradation and photocatalytic hydrogen production were observed. Huang et al. reported that porous O-doped g-C3N4 was prepared by a precursor pre-treatment method, forming hydrogen-bond-induced supramolecular aggregates for the creation of the porous structure and tailored O-doping.240 The porous structure and O-doping worked together to achieve 6.1 and 3.1 times higher hydrogen evolution compared to bulk and porous g-C3N4 (non-doping), respectively. Guo et al. prepared holey-structured g-C3N4 with doped oxygen at the edges via photo-Fenton reactions.241 A lowered band gap energy of 2.43 eV and an increased BET surface area of 348 m2 g−1 were achieved. The effect of oxygen doping on the electronic and geometric structure of g-C3N4 was investigated by first principles.260 It was theoretically confirmed that oxygen doping can improve the visible-light absorption, increase the carrier mobility, produce more active sites and reduce the recombination of electron/hole pairs.
3.3.2.2. Sulfur doping. 
Zhang et al.182 developed sulfur-mediated synthesis to stimulate carbon nitride bulk condensation with trithiocyanuric acid as the precursor, in which the –SH groups were supposed to play a key role in adjusting the physicochemical properties of the prepared g-C3N4. A trace amount of sulfur doping showed effective modification of the textural, optical, and electronic properties. As a result, the activity in water oxidation reactions was improved. Liu et al.243 reported that sulfur-doping can induce a unique electronic structure that shows an increased VB along with an elevated CB minimum and minor declined absorbance. Significant changes in the optical properties and electronic structures would lead to enhanced photocatalysis in hydrogen evolution over the sulfur-doped g-C3N4, with rates 7.2 and 8.0 times higher than the unmodified counterpart under λ > 300 and 420 nm, respectively. Sulfur-doped g-C3N4 was also used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Wang et al.246 reported that sulfur-doped g-C3N4 can convert CO2 by photocatalysis to CH3OH with a yield of 1.12 μmol g−1, compared to 0.81 μmol g−1 on the undoped sample. First-principles studies showed that the band gap was not changed by the doping, however impurity states appeared.
Stolbov and Zuluaga261 carried out a comprehensive first-principles study to investigate the effect of sulfur doping on the electronic and geometric structures of g-C3N4. It was found that sulfur would contribute to the valence charge densities and then significantly reduce the band gap energy. Other than the effect of sulfur-doping on the catalyst, Lin et al.262 applied DFT calculations to determine the influence of sulfur-doping on the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic water oxidation. They found that sulfur-doping of g-C3N4 not only induces a different reaction mechanism but also decreases the overpotential.
Both the theoretical and experimental studies shown in Table 2 suggest that sulfur-doping has been most extensively studied. The S-doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts have demonstrated effectiveness in photodegradation, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and water oxidation. As various synthetic routes were involved, some inconsistency raised in the studies might be due to the different chemical states of the dopants.
3.3.2.3. Phosphorus doping. 
Phosphorus-doped g-C3N4 was prepared by poly-condensation of a mixture with g-C3N4 (dicyandiamide) as precursor and a heteroatom source, namely a phosphorus-containing ionic liquid. The doping can provide much better electric conductivity and an improvement in photocurrent generation.247 Phosphorus doping and structural modification were integrated by Ran et al.,250 who prepared porous P-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets by combining P doping and thermal exfoliation of a bulk material. The P-doping and novel macroporous nanosheet morphology significantly increased the visible-light photocatalytic H2-production compared to pristine g-C3N4. Newly formed mid-gap states (−0.16 V vs. SHE) were observed due to the P-doping. With a similar strategy of simultaneous tailoring of texture and electro-/optical-properties, mesoporous P-doped g-C3N4 nanostructured flowers were also prepared by a co-condensation method in the absence of any templates.231 Improved hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation was observed due to the promoted light trapping, mass transfer, and charge separation.
Guo et al.251 applied a hexagonal rod-like supramolecular of melamine-cyanuric acid as a precursor of g-C3N4 and phosphorous acid as a P source to prepare P-doped carbon nitride tubes and used the photocatalysts to carry out hydrogen evolution reactions. It was observed that, after P-doping, the band gap energy decreased to 2.55 from 2.67 eV. The valence band position of the P-TCN (P-doped g-C3N4) decreased to 1.44 from 1.67 eV, and the conduction band position shifted to −1.11 from −1.0 eV. Compared to the pristine sample, the changes in the band gap structure bearing a more negative CB but a more positive VB indicated a better reduction ability and a lower oxidation ability. Furthermore, a 7 times higher photocatalytic H2 evolution rate was achieved. A computational study on the effect of phosphorus doping on the electronic structure and photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 was reported.263 When phosphorus substitutes N (P@N2) or C (P@C1) sites in g-C3N4, its doping can significantly reduce the band gap energy to 2.03 and 2.22 eV, respectively, compared to the original value of 2.73 eV for the pristine compound. Moreover, a less negative CB and a more positive VB were theoretically predicted for both P@N2 and P@C1 doping. This is different from the experimental study.251 However, it would be hasty to judge which one is correct. As usual, the doping studies are full of controversies.
3.3.2.4. Iodine doping. 
Iodine-modified g-C3N4 was synthesized by the co-condensation of dicyandiamide and ammonium iodine. It was expected that the introduction of iodine would induce an effective extension of the aromatic carbon nitride heterocycle by I ions. Extended optical absorption, reduced band gap energy, improved charge separation, and enhanced hydrogen evolution were achieved.252 Iodinated g-C3N4 nanosheets were prepared by a simple and scalable method using a ball-milling technique.253 Both the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties were changed by I-doping. Photoelectrochemical tests on pristine and I-doped g-C3N4 samples were carried out. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of three samples, bulk g-C3N4 (GCN), I-free GCN (modified g-C3N4 by ball-milling), and IGCNSS1/2 (the mass ratio of iodine to bulk GCN at ½ in the ball-milling process), was measured in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution in the dark. It was suggested that the electrons of IGCNSS1/2 can be more freely transferred to the protons than in the other two samples. Moreover, the I-doped sample also demonstrated the highest photocurrent density among all the samples under visible-light irradiation. Such an enhanced photoelectrochemical performance also led to the best hydrogen evolution rate of 44.5 μmol h−1 with IGCNSS1/2, compared to 4.9 and 19.5 μmol h−1 on bulk GCN and I-free GCN, respectively.
Fluorinated g-C3N4 was prepared by directly incorporating NH4F into the thermal condensation process in a g-C3N4 synthesis.257 The doped F can shift both the VB and CB to higher energy values, which was beneficial for the redox properties and could enhance heterogeneous photocatalysis. In photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, F-g-C3N4 with 3 wt% Pt as the co-catalyst demonstrated about 2.7 times higher activity than the unmodified g-C3N4.
Another halogen element, bromine, was also applied to prepare doped g-C3N4.254 The Br dopant was from a precursor of NH4Br, while the precursor of carbon nitride can be flexible. Photoelectrochemical measurements suggested that the introduction of bromine could facilitate the interfacial charge transfer. Moreover, a larger photocurrent density was obtained at an applied potential of −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH 6.8), indicating a smaller resistance of the electrode materials after Br-doping. In the photocatalytic water splitting tests, 2.4 times higher hydrogen production, and 6 times higher oxygen evolution were achieved, respectively, on the best sample with Br-doping, with the assistance of Pt and CoOx as the co-catalysts.
3.3.2.5. Nitrogen, fluorine or boron doping. 
Nitrogen-doped g-C3N4 was fabricated by the co-thermal condensation of the precursor of melamine with a nitrogen-rich additive of hydrazine hydrate.255 The band structure of C3N4+x was changed compared to pristine g-C3N4. Fig. 4 shows the modified band structure determined by the integration of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Mott–Schottky plots. Fig. 4(a) shows that N-doping can lower the band gap of 2.72 eV of pristine g-C3N4 to 2.65 eV in C3N4+x. Fig. 4(b) indicates that the valence band maximum of pristine g-C3N4 is at 1.84 eV. Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. 4(c) and (d) show typical n-type characteristics and a flat band potential of −0.98 and −1.13 eV vs. Ag/AgCl for C3N4+x and g-C3N4, respectively. With the above analyses, the band structure can be shown in Fig. 4(e). The modified band structure can improve the photocatalytic activity. In hydrogen evolution, the rate with C3N4+x was 1.8 times higher than with pristine g-C3N4 photocatalysts. Zhou et al.256 reported the synthesis of N-doped g-C3N4 using citric acid and urea as starting precursors for the thermal polymerization. It was suggested that the lone pair electron on the graphitic N atom can result in the aromatic π-conjugated system being extended and delocalized. As a result, the photocatalysis performances and the photocurrent were improved.

Boron-doped g-C3N4 was prepared by heating a mixture of melamine and boron oxide.258 It was found that boron doping for g-C3N4 can improve the efficiency of photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) owing to the increased dye adsorption and light absorption of the catalyst. Sagara et al.259 prepared a p-type B-doped g-C3N4 electrode using BH3NH3 as the dopant precursor. Under solar irradiation, the photocurrent density of the B-doped sample was about 5-times larger than the unmodified sample. The B-doped g-C3N4 demonstrated efficient CO2 reduction under photoelectrochemical conditions with both gas and liquid products. With the co-catalysts, C2H5OH was determined to be the main product with a small amount of gaseous CO and H2.
3.3.2.6. Vacancy/defect modification. 
Defects and vacancies would profoundly influence the properties of the crystalline materials, thereby controlling the catalytic activity. Wu et al.264 used melamine to remedy various defects (for example, cyano and amino defects) of mesoporous g-C3N4. Once the defects were passivated, better separation and transfer of electron–hole pairs could be achieved, as confirmed by ESR, the photocurrent and the conductivity. In the photo-oxidation reactions of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (1,4-DHP) and the associated/simultaneous hydrogen production, the conversion and H2 evolution of the remedied sample were enhanced 2 and 6.5 times compared to the unmodified mesoporous g-C3N4. Li et al.265 applied hot argon gas to create carbon vacancies on g-C3N4. Both experimental and theoretical investigations proved that the carbon vacancies would reduce the symmetry of the g-C3N4 and modulate the electronic structure. The vacancies would also give g-C3N4 more excited electrons and a lowered band gap energy. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production reaction, a 14 times higher production rate was achieved via the carbon-vacancy modification.
Generally, it can be seen that a variety of non-metal elements can be doped into carbon nitride at either carbon or nitrogen sites, or as surface modification groups. However, compared with non-metal doping of metal oxides, such as TiO2, much work is still required. Unlike the sole substitution of oxygen in metal oxides, the potential replacement of both carbon and nitrogen sites also poses demanding protocols regarding the rational design of the materials. Moreover, recent studies on the vacancies hold more flexible options for tailoring the properties of g-C3N4.

3.4. Semiconductor coupling

3.4.1. Coupling metal oxides. 
Coupling one semiconductor to another is an effective technique to create heterojunctions for extended absorbance and improved charge separation, which could enhance the photocatalytic performance. Yan and Yang266 reported that coupling TiO2 to C3N4 can remarkably increase the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate due to an improved charge separation efficiency. Li et al.267 prepared various TiO2 nanostructures, such as 0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets, and 3D mesoporous nanocrystals, and attached each of them onto g-C3N4 to create heterojunctions. meso-TiO2/g-C3N4 demonstrated the highest activity in the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) and phenol, which was 29–37 times higher than with bare g-C3N4. Jo and Natarajan268 investigated the influence of TiO2 morphology (nanoparticles and nanotubes) on the photodegradation of isoniazid and found that the Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube (3%-CN/TNT) exhibited enhanced photocatalysis (90.8% degradation in 4 h) compared to that of nanoparticles/CN (79.5%), pure TiO2 (56.3%), and g-C3N4 (13.5%).
Song et al.269 reported the fabrication of a g-C3N4/(0 0 1)-TiO2 composite by a solvent-free in situ method. The compact connection between g-C3N4 and (0 0 1)-TiO2 can facilitate the interfacial charge transfer process. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced in the removal of NO, being 2.4 times higher than with pure (0 0 1)-TiO2 and 4.1 times higher than with g-C3N4 under UV irradiation. Huang et al.270 studied the effect of the contact interface between (0 0 1) or (1 0 1) TiO2 and g-C3N4 and found that g-C3N4 can efficiently remove the photo-generated electrons on (1 0 1) facets for enhanced photocatalysis.
ZnO was used to hybridize g-C3N4 by a monolayer-dispersed method. The prepared hybrids showed a 5 times higher photocurrent compared to pure ZnO and a photocurrent was also observed under visible light. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity under UV irradiation was increased by 3.5 times and the photo-corrosion of ZnO was suppressed.271 A ZnO/g-C3N4 composite was also prepared by a simple impregnation method for CO2 conversion to fuels. The light-absorbance was not changed much but the heterojunction could inhibit the recombination of photo-induced charges. Therefore, the optimal ZnO/g-C3N4 composite showed a higher CO2 conversion rate, which was 4.9 and 6.4 times higher than pristine g-C3N4 and P25, respectively.
Other metal oxides, such as α-Fe2O3,34 SnO2,272 WO3,273 and CuO,274 were also used to couple with g-C3N4. A variety of bimetallic oxides, such as SnNb2O6 nanosheet,275 NaNbO3,276 CuFe2O4,277 and Ag3VO4,278 have been demonstrated to be effective for the modification of g-C3N4. Besides, metal sulfides,279 metal oxohalides,280,281 ternary compounds,33,282–284 and other novel materials (phosphates,285,286 polyoxometalates,287 and zinc phthalocyanine288) were also able to modify g-C3N4 for enhanced photocatalysis.


3.4.2 Metal-free hybridization. 
3.4.2.1. Carbonaceous materials. 
To maintain the metal-free nature, non-metal compounds were employed for modification of g-C3N4. Zhang et al.289 described the non-covalent modification of g-C3N4 with graphene and suggested that, with a π–π stacking interaction, the band structure of g-C3N4 can be modulated for enhanced photoelectrochemical properties. Graphene oxide (GO) modified g-C3N4 was prepared by a sonochemical approach.290 GO was found to have a 2D sheet structure with chiffon-like ripples, which can form a layer–layer structure with 2D g-C3N4. GO can act as a separation centre and electron acceptor; thus, photodegradation of RhB and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) under visible-light irradiation was improved by 3.8 and 2.08 times compared to pristine g-C3N4, respectively. Ai et al.291 applied a method of thermal condensation of melamine and GO to prepare graphene–carbon nitride hybrids. Enhanced photodegradation for both phenol and methylene blue (MB) was observed. Graphene quantum dots were employed by Zou et al.292 to prepare g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalysts. Improved hydrogen production was observed.
Ge and Han293 prepared an MWCNT/g-C3N4 composite as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution from water. At the optimal modification level of 2.0 wt%, the composite photocatalyst showed a 3.7 fold higher hydrogen evolution from methanol solutions compared to pristine g-C3N4.
Sun et al.175 described an interesting, metal-free hybrid photocatalyst made of carbon nitride and carbon spheres. The prepared pristine g-C3N4 was hydrothermally treated with glucose, which was then converted to uniform carbon spheres attached to carbon nitride sheets. It was found that the introduction of carbon spheres significantly improved the optical absorption and charge separation. Enhanced photodegradation of organic pollutants was observed. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that the improved photocatalysis was not due to textural changes.
A composite of g-C3N4/S-doped porous carbon was then prepared and its photoactivity was investigated.294 The material was determined to be conductive, porous and surface active due to the sulfur functionality, and it demonstrated excellent electroreduction under visible light.
Very recently, carbon dots were used to fabricate g-C3N4 hybrid photocatalysts. Fang et al.295 prepared carbon-dot-modified g-C3N4 using C-dots and dicyandiamide as the starting materials. A series of samples, S0, S4, S5, S6, and S10 (where 0, 4, 5, 6, and 10 referred to n mL of C-dots in the starting materials) were obtained and the C-dot loading levels were dependent on the initial volumes. The photocatalytic performances of the hybrid of C-dots and g-C3N4 were evaluated by both the photodegradation of RhB under UV and hydrogen production under visible-light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 5. It was found that S5 (0.25 wt% C-dot-modified g-C3N4, via 5 mL C-dots as the precursor) showed the best activity in both the reactions. It was suggested that the C-dots would induce lattice distortion, act as an electron-sink, and prevent the recombination of the photoinduced charges. However, too high a level of C-dots might form a recombination centre and reduce the photocatalytic activity. Similar studies were also carried out by Li et al.,296 using carbon quantum dots, and Liu et al.,297 using carbon nanodots.

3.4.2.2. Polymeric materials. 
Grafting functional groups onto g-C3N4 can be achieved by copolymerization with organic compounds having amino cyano moieties. Zhang et al.298 employed various monomer building blocks with desired compositions and electronic structures for the modification of g-C3N4. Enhanced photocatalysis was claimed on the modified photocatalysts. Chu et al.299 reported a simple bottom-up approach to prepare g-C3N4 with a desired band structure by incorporating an electron-deficient pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) monomer. The modified g-C3N4 has a lowered VB, ensuring a stronger photo-oxidation ability in the degradation of MO. Moreover, the formation processes of reactive radicals were tuned by photoinduced holes rather than electrons due to the band-gap engineering.
3.4.2.3. Other metal-free materials. 
Some other metal-free compounds, such as polyacylonitrile (g-PAN),300 melem,301 and g-C3N4 itself,302 were also employed to modify g-C3N4. In recent studies, Zhu's group prepared a 3D C3N4-agar hydrogel photocatalyst,303 and C3N4/SiO2 hydrogels,304 and evaluated their photocatalytic activities. Ansari et al.305 reported the feasible synthesis of g-C3N4/red phosphorus and its potential applications for the degradation of dyes and energy storage.

3.5. Dye-sensitization of g-C3N4
Dye sensitization was discovered a long time ago and has been widely used in photocatalysis and solar cells. With light absorption and the injection of electrons from dye excitation, the solar energy conversion efficiency can be greatly increased.
Takanabe et al.306 reported that magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc) dye sensitization of mesoporous carbon nitride can lead to highly efficient hydrogen evolution, even with irradiation at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. Highly asymmetric phthalocyanine (zinc-tri-PcN) was used to modify carbon nitride due to the intense near-IR light absorption.307 In the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a very high quantum yield of 1.85% at 700 nm was achieved.
A low-cost dye, erythrosin B (ErB), was applied to sensitize carbon nitride nanosheets. After sensitization, a 14.5 times higher rate of hydrogen evolution was achieved and the highest quantum efficiency of 33.4% was observed when the irradiation was at a wavelength of 460 nm. It was proposed that more electrons can be transferred to the CB of g-C3N4 from excited ErB due to the energy structure difference between the LUMO level of the dye and the CB of the photocatalyst (−3.59 eV vs. −3.71 eV vacuum level accordingly).308 Xu et al.309 employed eosin Y (EY) for sensitizing carbon nitride and found that the apparent quantum yield in hydrogen evolution was 18.8%.
Zhang et al.310 reported that four commonly used xanthene dyes, such as fluorescein, dibromofluorescein, eosin Y, and erythrosine B, were compared in the dye-sensitization of carbon nitride. The electron transfer rate from the LUMO of each excited dye to the CB of carbon nitride was investigated. Moreover, the potential of the selected xanthene dye as a hole acceptor was discussed with respect to the implications for photocatalysis.
In a recent study, Liu et al.311 found that oxygen doping can promote the dye-sensitization process. With tests employing four dyes, eosin-Y, perylene, Nile-red and coumarin, Nile-red sensitization was effective for MB degradation while eosin-Y was suitable for phenol degradation. However, without oxygen doping, the dye sensitization was not effective. Fang et al.312 observed that pre-treatment of the carbon nitride precursor would profoundly influence the resulting g-C3N4 samples. The optical and electronic properties were modulated and enhanced hydrogen production was obtained compared to bulk g-C3N4.
4. Carbonaceous, boron-based and elemental photocatalysts
Zhang et al.313 reported the synthesis of GO and rGO pillared by carbon nanotubes by a CVD method with acetonitrile as the carbon source. They observed that the CNT-rGO composite showed excellent photocatalytic performances in the degradation of RhB owing to its porous structure and improved electronic properties. GO was employed as a novel photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 conversion to methanol by Hsu et al.314 It was reported that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) can function as an efficient photocatalyst that is responsive to near infrared (NIR) light for selective oxidation reactions.315
Liu et al.316 demonstrated that inexpensive boron carbides (B4.3C and B13C2) can be functionalized as visible-light photocatalysts for H2 production and the rate was about two orders of magnitude larger than that with g-C3N4. More recently, synthesis of a ternary semiconductor, boron nitride (BN), was developed and the photocatalyst showed excellent performances in hydrogen or oxygen evolution from water and CO2 reduction reactions.317 DFT calculations showed that pure BN has an indirect band-gap of 4.56 eV and, after carbon doping, the band gap energy can be reduced to 2.00 eV for potential visible-light photocatalysis.
In addition to conventional photocatalysts, several novel, elemental photocatalysts have been reported.318 For example, α-sulfur,319 red phosphorus,320 and β-rhombohedral boron321 were all proven to be effective photocatalysts. However, the detailed mechanism is still not clear and few investigations have focused on this.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
Photocatalysis has been extensively investigated for over four decades and has demonstrated a wide variety of applications, such as water splitting for hydrogen evolution, CO2 conversion for hydrocarbon fuels, oxidation of aqueous and gaseous pollutants, reduction of heavy metals, building materials, and fine chemical synthesis. The mechanism and application implications have been well elucidated. The barrier to photocatalysis is the development of effective photocatalyst materials.
TiO2 and ZnO, as wide-band-gap semiconductors, have been widely employed as photocatalysts. The wide-band-gap energy ensures high redox potentials, necessary for facilitating photocatalytic reactions. However, the wide band gaps can only be activated by UV, so in solar energy utilization, the overall efficiency is very low. To extend the light absorbance, surface modification, doping, dye-sensitization, and semiconductor coupling have been used. On the other hand, many other metal oxides, bimetallic oxides, metal sulfides, and nitrides were also explored for enhanced photocatalysis and visible-light response. It is very common for multiple modifications to be used for the modulation of the physiochemical properties of the photocatalyst materials.
The scarcity and metal toxicity of metal-based photocatalysts were raised as major concerns. Metal-free, polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was demonstrated as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. It is generally prepared using a condensation approach, which leads to a very low BET surface area, not higher than 10.0 m2 g−1. The polymeric nature indicates a low mobility of charges, leading to a low photocatalytic activity. Also, the band structure of high VB minimum and high CB maximum of g-C3N4 determines that it has a high reduction ability but a low photo-oxidation activity. Therefore, various methods have been applied to modify g-C3N4 photocatalysts, such as the creation of porosity, semiconductor coupling, carbonaceous materials coupling, metal-doping, non-metal doping, monomer modification, and sensitization.
For maintaining the metal-free nature, metal-free modification, non-metal doping using oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, iodine, nitrogen, fluorine, and boron, were developed. More recently, the creation of defects offers another option for modulating the properties of g-C3N4. The metal-free coupling was another hot topic in recent studies, and graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, carbon spheres, and carbon dots were employed to prepare hybrid g-C3N4 photocatalysts. SiO2, red phosphorus, and agar were also used in some studies. With the modifications, porosity, morphology, surface functional groups, and band structure can be modulated for enhanced photocatalytic activity and extended applications, i.e. from photoreduction to photo-oxidation. More recently, some emerging photocatalysts, such as boron nitride, boron carbide, and elemental photocatalysts (sulfur, boron and phosphorus), were also developed as novel photocatalyst materials.
So far photocatalysis remains restricted to fundamental research only, as the efficiency of the photocatalysts is not satisfactory. In future studies, based on the development of photocatalyst materials, several strategies can be applied as follows.
(i) Basal photocatalysts for modification should be cheap, non-toxic and abundant on the Earth. Photocatalyst development has sometimes gone too far beyond reality, with the employment of very expensive rare earth elements or highly toxic metals. This kind of research is highly likely to be confined to the lab scale, even if superior solar energy utilization efficiency is achieved.
(ii) Multiple modification techniques offer both thermodynamic and kinetic control. The photocatalysis involves photon absorption, charge formation, charge separation and recombination, surface reactions for radical generation, and photocatalytic reactions. The final photocatalytic efficiency is literally controlled by each step; therefore, multiple modifications, including changing composition, tailoring shape, and modulating surface features, should be incorporated.
(iii) Integrated studies should employ both experimental and theoretical investigations. Photocatalyst design is very complicated. For example, for simple element doping, the experiments can involve the selection of an element, the level, and the species of the dopant. In the ISI database (on 10/05/2016), when “TiO2 and photocata* and nitrogen and dop*” is used in “TOPIC”, 2675 results are obtained. Experimental studies will never be able to screen all the possible solutions. Therefore, theoretical studies, including molecular simulations and reaction kinetics, should be used for the design of photocatalyst materials.
(iv) It is suggested that the most advantageous feature of g-C3N4 is its metal-free nature, but the efficiency is quite low. Modification with metal or metal oxides is likely to achieve a higher activity, yet deviates from the initial objective of the research. For maintaining the metal-free nature, creation of porous structures, metal-free doping, metal-free coupling, and dye-sensitization are preferred. For better modifications, integration of the above approaches would be able to deliver more promising g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.
