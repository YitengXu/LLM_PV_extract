    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractMolecular engineering of a photosensitizing dye plays a vital role in the control of excited states and charge carriers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) for performance improvement. Herein we report three metal-free donor–acceptor organic dyes by conjugating electron donors triphenylamine–cyclopentadithiophene (TPA–CPDT), triphenylamine–phenanthrocarbazole (TPA–PC), and di(biphenyl)amine–phenanthrocarbazole (DBPA–PC) with electron acceptor 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (EBTBA). The influences of electron donors on the energy levels, light absorption, dynamics of excited states and photogenerated charges, and photovoltaic parameters of DSCs were systematically analyzed via theoretical calculations and physical measurements. A DSC with dye SC-3 employing the bulky DBPA–PC electron donor achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.5% measured under the air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) conditions, owing to the significantly reduced interfacial charge recombination. Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion measurements have unraveled that energy relaxation and electron injection both occur for dye molecules in the nonrelaxed hot excited states. Also, the rate constants of injecting electrons from dyes in the excited states to titania are very dispersive by over 1 order of magnitude, which could be mainly ascribed to the broad energy distribution of excited states.
Introduction
Over the past 25 years, a lot of research activities have been attracted to dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) technology.1 Intense explorations on functional interfaces,2–4 single-electron redox couples,5–12 and photosensitizing dyes13–19 have led to a Japanese team in 2015 to achieve a vital power conversion efficiency (PCE) benchmark of 14.5%, for a DSC measured under the air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) conditions.20 A crucial strategy to enhance the PCE of a DSC consists in the development of dyes, which can not only harvest photons emitted from solar or artificial light sources to generate charge carriers, but also act as the main component of the self-organized molecular layer between the electron-transporting titania and hole-transporting redox electrolyte to control charge recombination.21–26 The latter role is of supreme importance for the photovoltage output, in case that the flux of carrier generation is not varied. In this regard considerable efforts have been devoted to metal-free donor–acceptor (D–A) organic dyes owing to the abundance of raw materials, the flexibility of molecular design, and the bright color.13–19
A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), N-annulated perylene (1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, PC), with a coplanar electronic backbone has been initially utilized by Luo et al. as an auxiliary electron-donating moiety in zinc-porphyrin dyes to enhance the harvesting of near-infrared solar photons. Later, PC was actively pursed as the central electron-releasing block of a variety of D–A dyes for efficient DSCs.27–31 In this context, last year we reported a structurally simple D–A dye C266 (Fig. S1†) characteristic of a binary electron donor triphenylamine–phenanthrocarbazole (TPA–PC) in combination with the widely used electron acceptor cyanoacrylic acid, attaining a fairly good PCE of 9.0%.32 This efficiency is nearly comparable to that of our model dye C218 (Fig. S1†) with electron donor triphenylamine–cyclopentadithiophene (TPA–CPDT).33 Meanwhile, electron acceptor 4-(7-ethynylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (EBTBA) with a theoretical lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −2.97 eV versus vacuum has been successfully used as the electron acceptor for high-efficiency zinc-porphyrin and metal-free organic dyes.11,28,34 Note that EBTBA in THF presents a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of ∼85% and a long equilibrium excited state lifetime of ∼3.9 ns (Fig. S2b†).
In this work, we plan to first synthesize two dyes SC-1 and SC-2 (Fig. 1), taking a further look at the crucial role of PC versus cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) for the development of metal-free D–A dyes. Next, TPA–PC will be replaced with a bulky electron donor11 di(biphenyl)amine–phenanthrocarbazole (DBPA–PC) for SC-3 (Fig. 1). The impacts of electron donors TPA–CPDT, TPA–PC, and DBPA–PC on the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels, energy gaps, light absorptions, and photovoltaic parameters of these three EBTBA-based D–A dyes will be scrutinized via joint experimental measurements and theoretical calculations.

The bond in cyan could be conceived as formed by oxidative coupling of electron-rich and electron-deficient entities. 
Results and discussion
To resolve the impact of electron donors TPA–PC and DBPA–PC versus TPA–CPDT on the energy levels and energy gaps of D–A dyes, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) were first recorded in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels (Table 1) could be approximately extracted from the curves given in Fig. 2a by virtue of the following equation E = −4.88 − eEonset,(1)where Eonset stands for the onset potential of oxidation or reduction of the ground state of a dye dissolved in THF. It can be observed that with respect to SC-1 using the TPA–CPDT electron donor, the TPA–PC based dye SC-2 and the DBPA–PC dye SC-3 both own deeper HOMO energy levels, the difference being 0.07 eV and 0.11 eV, respectively. Likewise, these three dyes all carry an equivalent LUMO energy level of −3.29 eV. In this fashion, the transformation of electron donor from TPA–CPDT to TPA–PC and DBPA–PC gives birth to larger LUMO/HOMO energy gaps (ΔECVL/H).

a The frontier orbital energies (ECVL and ECVH) with respect to vacuum were derived from cyclic voltammograms presented in Fig. 2a. H and L represent HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The frontier orbital energies (EB3LYPL and EB3LYPH) with respect to vacuum were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for a dye in THF. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λMEASABS,MAX), maximum PL wavelength (λMEASPL,MAX), and stokes shifts (ΔMEAS) were derived from the electronic absorption and PL spectra of a dye solution in THF. The maximum absorption wavelengths (λTD-MPW1KABS,MAX) and transition densities were derived from TDDFT calculation at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level of theory for a dye in THF.

Decamethylferrocene (DMFc) was added as the internal reference. Potentials were further calibrated with respect to the standard redox couple ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). (b) LUMO energy levels (values above color bars), HOMO energy levels (values under color bars), and energy gaps (ΔEL/H) of D−A dyes and their corresponding electron donors and electron acceptors. Note that these data are theoretical values calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. (c) UV-vis (solid lines) and PL (dash lines) spectroscopies of diluted dye solutions (10 μM) with THF as the solvent. (d) Geometries and contour plots of HOMOs and LUMOs dominating the S0 → Svert1 transitions. The large aliphatic substituents were cut to ethyl to improve computational efficiency. 
As shown in Fig. 2b and Table 1, the electronic energy level alignment of these three dyes can be well imitated by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level. In addition, we computed the FMO energy levels of the building blocks (TPA–CPDT, TPA–PC, DBPA–PC, and EBTBA) to understand their energetically genetic correlations with these three D−A dyes. In good agreement with our previous results,35–37 the LUMO energy levels of these dyes are intimately inherited from that of electron acceptor EBTBA as exemplified in Fig. 2b. In the meantime, their HOMO energy levels are nearly indistinguishable in comparison with those of their corresponding electron donors.
Afterwards, we measured the stationary electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2c) of these dyes dissolved in THF. As tabulated in Table 1, the maximum absorption wavelengths (λMEASABS,MAX) are 525 nm for SC-1, 523 nm for SC-2, and 522 nm for SC-3. The stepwise blue-shifting of λMEASABS,MAX is apparently consistent with the HOMO/LUMO energy gap enlargement. The movement of λMEASABS,MAX can also be reproduced by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level. The maximum molar absorption coefficients (εMEASMAX) are 28.5 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for SC-1, 34.5 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for SC-2 and 40.1 × 103 M−1 cm−1 for SC-3. The vertical electronic transitions of S0 → Svert1 for these three dyes principally originate from HOMO to LUMO. By watching contour plots of molecular orbitals presented in Fig. 2d, one can easily identify the intramolecular charge-transfer character of these dyes.
The steady-state PL spectra of dyes in THF are presented in Fig. 2c. The calculated values of Stokes shifts (ΔMEAS) are collected in Table 1, being 5.7 × 103 cm−1 for SC-1, 5.3 × 103 cm−1 for SC-2, and 5.8 × 103 cm−1 for SC-3. The large energy losses upon vertical excitation have suggested the existence of vibrational, torsional, and solvent relaxations of the initially generated vertically excited state.38 To have an intuitional understanding of conformational relaxations, the geometries of dye molecules in the equilibrium excited state (Seq1) were optimized by using the TDDFT calculations at the TD-MPW1K/6-311G(d,p) level. Recall that the vertically excited state (Svert1) retains the same geometry as S0 according to the Frank–Condon (FC) principle. Through comparing the optimized geometries of S0 and Seq1 (Fig. S4†), one can note considerable conformational changes in the excited states. In addition, the electronic backbones of all these three dyes tend to be more planar during the structural relaxation, which has also been observed for other organic conjugated materials.39
By use of the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and time-correlated single photon counting techniques, we further measured the time-resolved PL (TRPL) traces for SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3 in THF at the time scale from femtosecond to nanosecond as shown in Fig. S5–S7.† Note that each PL trace is independent of the intensity and wavelength of excitation light. It can be clearly observed that all dye molecules present PL wavelength dependent kinetics. The traces at the high-energy PL wavelengths have a fast decay, which is in the same time scale concomitant with the slow rising for the traces at the low-energy PL wavelengths. Using the free Glotaran software,40 we globally fitted the PL curves at various wavelengths for each dye. At least four time constants (τi) listed in Tables S2–S4† were needed for all samples to get a satisfactory global fitting. Next, each PL trace was fitted to obtain the corresponding fractional amplitudes (Ai, Tables S2–S4†) of the four time constants with the Surface Xplorer software (version 2.3). The amplitude-averaged lifetime (, Tables S2–S4†) can be further derived via equation (2)where Ai > 0. As presented in Fig. S8,† it is valuable to note that the  gradually elongates along with the red-shifting of PL wavelengths, and eventually tends to be an invariable value which can be ascribed to the deactivation time constants of the first equilibrium excited singlet state (Seq1). We have also noted that the Seq1 lifetimes of the two PC based dyes SC-2 and SC-3 are 1049 ps and 834 ps, which are remarkably longer than that (87 ps) of the CPDT based dye SC-1.
Recall that the integral of the time-resolved PL curve at a certain wavelength (Fig. S5–S7†) is proportional to the counts of photons emitted at the corresponding wavelength in the static PL spectra (Fig. 2c). Thus we reconstructed TRPL spectra (Fig. S9a–c†). As shown in Fig. S9d–f,† the evolution associated photoluminescence (EAPL) spectra were further derived by performing the global analysis using the Glotaran software in combination with the four time constants. This scenario could be described by a picture that the Svert1 state formed upon the light excitation of dye molecules undergoes stepwise conformational and solvent relaxations to form Seq1.41–46 This is strongly supported by significant structural variations of S0 and Seq1 (Fig. S4†), slow-rising signals (Fig. S5–S7†), and negative amplitudes of the short time constants in Tables S2–S4† at the long PL wavelengths.
As illustrated in Fig. 3a, we further measured the stationary PL spectra of dye-grafted alumina and titania films in contact with a Co-bpy electrolyte. Note that compared with the dyed alumina film, the titania counterpart exhibits a blue-shifted PL peak for a given dye, which should originate from the considerable electron injection to titania from the nonrelaxed excited states. To evaluate the impact of replacing electron donor TPA–CPDT with TPA–PC and DBPA–PC on electron injection yield (ϕei), the time-resolved PL traces (Fig. S10–S15†) of these dyed oxide films in contact with a Co-bpy electrolyte were recorded by use of the femtosecond fluorescence upconversion technique. As presented in Fig. 3b, all dyed oxide films also present PL wavelength dependent kinetics. Resorting to the same protocols for solutions, the  values can be derived by globally fitting the PL traces of dyed oxide films. The feature of wavelength-dependent average lifetimes (Fig. 3c) can also be detected. It is observed that for dye-grafted alumina samples, the two PC dyes SC-2 and SC-3 also exhibit elongated lifetimes of Seq1 with respect to that of SC-1, being 270 ps for SC-1, 667 ps for SC-2, and 527 ps for SC-3, which is in general consistent with the preceding discussion on solution samples. Moreover, TRPL (Fig. 4a–f) and EAPL (Fig. 4g–l) of dyed oxide films can also be obtained with the same protocol for solution samples. Both intramolecular torsional relaxations and intermolecular energy transfer processes could occur in the self-organized dye layer on the surface of oxide nanocrystals, contributing to the dynamic Stokes shifts detected in Fig. 4g–l.

(g–l) Evolution associated PL (EAPL) spectra of (g) SC-1 on alumina, (h) SC-2 on alumina, (i) SC-3 on alumina, (j) SC-1 on titania, (k) SC-2 on titania, and (l) SC-3 on titania. All dye-grafted oxide films were immersed in a Co-bpy electrolyte. The solid lines are fitting lines with a lognormal function. 
The dynamic quenching yield (QYD) at each PL wavelength was calculated via equation (3)wherein (A,λ) and (T,λ) are amplitude-averaged PL lifetimes at each wavelength of dyes on alumina and titania, respectively. Note that the high-energy excited state of a molecule with a large free energy should emit a photon at the short wavelength and vice versa. The considerably lower QYD values (e.g. at the PL wavelength of 620 nm, 78% for SC-1, 81% for SC-2, and 74% for SC-3) of the vibrationally hot excited states for each dye (Fig. 5a) observed here can be ascribed to the competitive transformations of them to the low-energy excited states, which indeed have higher QYD values (e.g. at the PL wavelength of 840 nm, 96% for SC-1, 98% for SC-2, and 97% for SC-3). In general, we could estimate that the lower limits of QYD are 96% for SC-1, 98% for SC-2, and 97% for SC-3. Besides, we also calculated the time constant of electron injection (ei) with the following equation (4)
 Fig. 5  (a) Plots of dynamic PL quenching yields (QYD, symbols) as a function of PL wavelengths for SC-1 (red), SC-2 (green), and SC-3 (blue). (b) Plots of time constants of electron injection against PL wavelengths. 
As shown in Fig. 5b, with a decrease of free energy from 2.03 eV to 1.68 eV over one order of magnitude augmentation of ei can be observed. In addition, we also observed that the order of ei for these three dyes at a given energy of PL is SC-3 > SC-2 > SC-1. Recalling the energy level alignment of HOMOs in Table 1, one could infer that at a certain PL wavelength, the LUMOs of excited states should be aligned in the order SC-1 > SC-2 > SC-3. Therefore the potential energy of the excited state and the driving energy for electron injection should decrease in the order SC-1 > SC-2 > SC-3. Thereby the variation of ei could be attributed to the gradually augmented driving energy for electron injection.
To understand the dual-path charge transfer reactions of photo-oxidized dye molecules (D+) with electrons in the conduction-band (CB) as well as traps below the CB of titania, and cobalt(II) ions in the electrolyte, we further performed nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements. With the help of spectroelectrochemical measurements (Fig. S16†) of dye-grafted titania films immersed in EMITFSI, we identified a strong electronic absorption in the near-infrared spectral region of D+ for all dyes. Hence, a probe light at 785 nm was used in the following measurements and the excitation wavelengths were also elaborately selected in terms of an optical density of ∼0.5 of dye-grated titania films, ensuring a similar electron distribution profile for all samples. As shown in Fig. 6a–c, in the presence of an inert electrolyte (for its recipe see the caption of Fig. 6), the slow absorption decays in the millisecond time domain can be ascribed to the charge transfer reaction between D+ and negatively charged titania. The half lifetimes (τinert1/2) of this reaction were 1.5 ms for SC-1, 1.7 ms for SC-2, and 1.8 ms for SC-3. Furthermore, the replacement of the inert electrolyte with the electroactive Co-bpy electrolyte (for its recipe see the Experimental section) results in a considerable acceleration of absorption decays (Fig. 6d–f), suggesting the occurrence of charge transfer from D+ to the cobalt(II) ions in the electrolyte. The half lifetimes (τCo-bpy1/2) of this reaction are derived to be 55 μs for SC-1, 43 μs for SC-2, and 33 μs for SC-3, which can be explained by the increased driving force (see the HOMO energy levels in Table 1). Overall, the hole injection yields (ϕhi) were computed, being 96%, 97%, and 98% for SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3, respectively via the following expression ϕhi = 1 − τCo-bpy1/2/τinert1/2.(5)

Absorption transients of (d) SC-1, (e) SC-2, and (f) SC-3 grafted titania films in combination with a Co-bpy electrolyte. Pulse fluence: 20 μJ cm−2. The excitation wavelength was selected according to a 0.5 optical density of dye-grafted titania films to yield a similar distribution profile of vertically excited states in our testing samples. Excitation wavelength: 596 nm for SC-1/inert; 626 nm for SC-2/inert; 615 nm for SC-3/inert; 601 nm for SC-1/Co-bpy; 630 nm for SC-2/Co-bpy; 619 nm for SC-3/Co-bpy. Probe wavelength: 785 nm. The solid grey lines are the fitting lines of normalized absorption (ΔA) that were obtained by employing a multi-exponential function: . 
Finally, we combined SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3 grafted bilayer titania films with a Co-bpy electrolyte to fabricate DSCs. The electrolyte recipe and the detailed manufacturing processes are described in the Experimental section. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of DSCs were measured at an interval of 10 nm for incident monochromatic lights and also an irradiance of white light bias (10 mW cm−2). As illustrated in Fig. 7a, DSCs with all these three dyes exhibit comparable EQE summits. The onset wavelengths of EQE curves could be rationalized by recording the light-harvesting efficiency (ϕlh) derived from the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 7b) of 8.0 μm-thick, dye-grafted mesoporous TiO2 films. The improved ϕlh in the wavelength range from 610 nm to 720 nm for SC-2 and SC-3 should be also contributed by the increased dye loading amount (cm), i.e. being 2.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for SC-2 and 2.6 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 for SC-3 in contrast to that of SC-1 (2.1 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1).

(c) Current–voltage (J–V) curves measured under the simulated AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2). An antireflection film was laminated on top of a DSC. The aperture area of our metal mask was 0.160 cm2.

(e) Charges extracted from a dye-grafted titania film (QCE) plotted as a function of VOC. (f) Plots of electron half-lifetimes (tTPD1/2) against QCE. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 7c) were further recorded at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight to evaluate the photovoltaic parameters (Table 2) of cells with SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3. Dye SC-1 exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 14.70 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 828 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.2%, yielding a moderate PCE of 9.3% for Co-bpy based DSCs. In compliance with the integrals of EQEs over the standard AM1.5G emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03), dye SC-2 outputs an augmented JSC of 16.62 mA cm−2 and an enlarged VOC of 856 mV, yielding an ∼14% enhanced PCE of 10.6%, notwithstanding a slightly reduced FF of 74.5%. Moreover, owing to the highest VOC of 920 mV and a FF of 75.8%, dye SC-3 affords an impressive PCE of 11.5%, in spite of a slightly reduced JSC of 16.50 mA cm−2 compared to SC-2. This is the first time that one can employ the PAH core of PC to design dyes for such a high PCE, while other PC based higher-level PAHs have been used for other dyes achieving the highest PCE of 13%.12,28 One may anticipate a further PCE improvement of SC-3via tailoring the oxide layer.47,48

As presented in Fig. 7d, we further measured J–V characteristics at different light intensities and plotted VOC as a logarithmic function of JSC. In view of the three parallel lines (red, green, and blue), an ∼80 mV uplifted VOC accompanies with one order magnitude enhancement of JSC for all three cells. In addition, the VOC values at a certain JSC for these three cells rank in the order SC-1 < SC-2 < SC-3. To figure out the interfacial energetic and dynamic origins of the change of VOC, we further carried out the charge extraction21,49 and transient photovoltage decay50,51 measurements. As shown in Fig. 7e, at a fixed VOC charges (QCE) stored in the titania are very much similar for dyes SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3, indicating the same conduction-band edge and distribution of trap states of titania for these three cells. Furthermore, the logarithmic value of charges stored in titania is in linear correlation with the value of VOC. As illustrated in Fig. 7f, the half lifetime (τTPD1/2) of electrons in the CB as well as traps below the CB of titania elongates in the order SC-1 < SC-2 < SC-3 at a fixed QCE, being consistent with the tendency of VOC. The shortest τTPD1/2 for SC-1 could be ascribed to its smallest dye loading amount with respect to SC-2 and SC-3. Seemingly, the twisted configuration of SC-3 at the end of the electron donor contributes significantly to the enhanced VOC, albeit a slight reduction of cm with respect to SC-2. The orientation of dye molecules on titania could be further studied using grazing wide-angle X-ray scattering and other modern analytical tools.52
Conclusions
In summary, by combining electron donors TPA–CPDT, TPA–PC, and DBPA–PC with electron acceptor EBTBA, we have synthesized three metal-free D–A dyes. The dye with bulky electron donor DBPA–PC has reached an excellent PCE of 11.5% under the AM1.5G full sunlight, which is relevant to the significantly improved photovoltage, originating from the effectively attenuated interfacial charge recombination. Our ultrafast PL studies have revealed the presence of dynamic Stokes shifts for these EBTBA dyes both dissolved in solutions and absorbed on oxide nanocrystals. These dynamic Stokes shifts could be well elucidated in view of the relaxation of hot excited states, which would compete with electron injection, and should be better controlled in future materials and device development.
Experimental section
Materials
THF, acetonitrile, ethanol, and toluene were distilled before use. LiTFSI, EMITFSI, DMFC, FC, and TBP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The synthetic details of SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3 are described in the ESI.†
Computational details
The 6-311G(d,p) basis set was applied for all theoretical calculations with Gaussian 09. The optimization of ground state geometries was carried out using the popular B3LYP exchange–correlation functional.53 The TD-MPW1K hybrid functional was picked to calculate the vertical excitation energies and optimize the geometries of the first excited state.54,55 The solvent effect on the geometries and transition energies was taken into account by means of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).56
Electrochemical and photophysical measurements
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of dye molecules in THF were recorded on a CHI660C electrochemical workstation. A three-electrode electrolytic cell was used and all potentials were reported with Fc/Fc+ as the internal reference. Static electronic absorption spectra were measured with an Agilent G1103A spectrometer equipped with a silicon diode array detector. Steady-state PL spectra were recorded by use of a cw laser diode and a SpectraSuite Spectrometer (Ocean Optics). Nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements were performed with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer. The probe light at 785 nm generated from a LDM 785 laser diode module (Thorlabs Corp.) was detected by a silicon detector in connection with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer. Time-correlated single photon counting measurements were performed with a LifeSpec-II fluorescence spectrometer. The details of femtosecond fluorescence upconversion measurements were outlined in our previous paper.57 In brief, the laser source at 800 nm with 4.2 mJ pulse energy and 130 fs pulse width generated from a regenerative amplifier (RGA, Spitfire, Spectra Physics) was split into two parts with a 9:1 beam splitter. The large portion was directed to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C, Light Conversion) to give birth to pump pulse at 490 nm. The minor part of the RGA output, which passed a delay line (2 ns, CDP Corp.), was employed as gate light to overlap with the photons transmitted from a rotating sample at a 0.3 mm-thick BBO crystal to yield a sum frequency light. The polarization between pump and gate beams was set to the magic-angle (54.7°). The intensity of pump light of 28 μJ cm−2 used here lies in the intensity independent kinetics region for our samples. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature.
Cell fabrication and characterization
A 4.6 + 5.0 μm-thick, double layer titania film screen-printed on a pre-cleaned FTO conducting glass (NSG, Solar) was employed as the negative electrode of DSCs and further dye-loaded by immersing it into a dye solution made by dissolving 150 μM of dye in a toluene–ethanol mixture (v/v, 1/9) for 12 h. The details of film preparation were described in a previous paper.58 The dye-grafted titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO electrode by using a 25 μm-thick Surlyn ring to produce a thin-layer electrochemical cell. The Co-bpy electrolyte is made with 0.25 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.05 M tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. A detailed description of photovoltaic characterization such as EQE, J–V, charge extraction and photovoltage decay measurements has been given in our previous publications.59,60
