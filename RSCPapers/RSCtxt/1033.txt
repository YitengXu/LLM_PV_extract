    , Accepted 8th April 2015First published on 9th April 2015AbstractWe demonstrated SnO2 films prepared by sinter-less spin-coating processes as an electron selective contact for CH3NH3PbI3-based planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A modified sequential deposition method, in which the grain size of PbI2 precursors was controlled by an equivalent solvent vapor annealing (SVA) process, was used to prepare the perovskite layer on SnO2. With this SVA process, the remnant PbI2 nanocrystals can stably occur at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 to carry out a passivation effect. The photovoltaic performance of SnO2-based PSCs is dependent on both the SVA time and the thickness of the perovskite layer. The optimized PSC device achieves the best power conversion efficiency of up to 13% under the AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination, which is highly durable over 30 days of storage time with exposure to the ambient air environment.
1 Introduction
Amongst the next-generation photovoltaic technologies being developed nowadays, CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most shining star because of their rapidly boosted power conversion efficiency (PCE), their cost-effectiveness, and their scalable processability.1–6 Investigations focused on the perovskite materials have revealed their superior opto-electrical properties, including suitable band-gap, high absorption coefficient, and extremely long and balanced ambipolar carrier transport.7–11 In spite of the large potential of perovskite materials, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is always sensitive to many factors, e.g., the device configurations, the method of producing the perovskite layer, the materials employed as the charge extraction contacts, and even the moisture level during the PSCs preparation.12–20 Before a consensus in PSC devices can be reached, explorations toward all the aspects of PSCs will help in the knowledge accumulation.
The exploration of the materials used as the electron selective contact (ESC) for PSCs remains one of the most challenging scientific issues. Although many inorganic semiconductors may be feasible as ESC materials for PSCs, to the best of our knowledge, the majority of the research into PSCs so far focuses mainly on TiO2 and ZnO.21–28 The opto-electrical properties between these two semiconductors are too similar to differentiate the electron transport mechanisms at the perovskite/ESC interface.
Compared to TiO2 and ZnO, tin oxide (SnO2) is similar with a wide band-gap, high transparency, and large electron mobility, but exhibits lower energy for the conduction-band edge (CBE).29–32 The fact that the SnO2 thin films could give sufficient conductivity without a higher temperature sintering process will benefit the future fabrication of photovoltaic devices on plastic substrates. Importantly, it was found in a previous investigation that SnO2 is much more effective at collecting electrons with low energy than TiO2, resulting in a substantially improved photocurrent in electrochemical cells.33 Similarly, some low-energy charge carriers of narrow band-gap perovskite absorbers with tin metal or formamidinium in their structure may not efficiently be collected by TiO2 or ZnO, but will be collected by SnO2. Thus, the study of SnO2 as the ESC for PSCs will provide an important piece of information for the further development of this photovoltaic device to efficiently utilize long wavelength photons.
A general concern with the use of SnO2 as an ESC, however, is that the voltage of PSCs may be decreased accordingly as the low CBE of SnO2 may reduce the built-in potential of the Schottky barrier between the perovskite and the ESC layers. This problem could be solved through surface passivation, as suggested by many previous investigations on TiO2-based PSCs.34,35 It was found that the presence of PbI2 species in the grain boundaries upon thermal annealing can lead to a successful passivation of CH3NH3PbI3 films, resulting in improved carrier electric property and thus device performance.35,36 The mechanism of this passivation effect by PbI2 was further revealed by femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy.37 Nevertheless, the fact that PbI2 passivation was achieved by decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 in these investigations may be accompanied by improvement of PSCs' durability.
In this investigation, we employed SnO2 thin films prepared by spin-coating of nanoparticles as ESCs to fabricate low-temperature-processed PSCs. We modified the typical two-step deposition technique by introducing slow growth of the PbI2 precursor with solvent vapors to control the crystal growth of perovskite. Intriguingly, we observed variations in absorbance and grain size of PbI2 with different solvent vapor annealing times. The varied PbI2 precursor results in a clear variation in the surface morphology, grain size, and absorbance of the corresponding perovskite layer. Importantly, the constantly occurred PbI2 layer on the perovskite/SnO2 interface has no negative effect on the photovoltaic performance of the resulting PSCs. Optimization of theCH3NH3PbI3 film thickness has delivered a maximum PCE of 13.0% under the standard air mass AM 1.5G light illumination. Most importantly, the SnO2-based PSCs exhibited high stability against ambient air without encapsulation. This study will contribute to both a deeper understanding of the mechanism and the real-world applications of the PSC technology.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
SnO2 nanoparticles (ca. 22–43 nm) were purchased from Wako Chemicals. Lead iodide (beads, -10 mesh, 99.999% trace metals basis) and lithium salts (>99.0%) were purchased from Aldrich. CH3NH3I (>99.0%) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (PLT). Spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, >99.0%) was purchased from Merck. Ultradry solvents N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF, >99.9%) and isopropanol (>99.9%) were obtained from J&K and Acros, respectively. All the chemicals and solvents were kept in a glove-box before starting our experiment.
2.2 Device fabrication
The pre-patterned ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol in sequence. The SnO2 nanoparticles were dispersed in butanol at a concentration of 6 mg mL−1 and stirred for 3 hours before use. The solution was filtered with a PVDF hydrophobic 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated on ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s to form a SnO2 layer, followed by short baking at 150 °C for 5 min. This procedure was repeated three times before finally baking at 200 °C for 1 hour. A 460 mg mL−1 solution of PbI2 in DMF was then spin-coated on the top of the SnO2 layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox. The PbI2-coated SnO2 thin films were kept in a Petri dish for x minutes (x = 1, 10, 20, 35, and 50) allowing slow growth of PbI2 nanoparticles, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the films were dipped into a CH3NH3I 2-propanol solution (10 mg mL−1) for 50 s, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 20 min to give the desired crystallite formation. As the hole-transporting material (HTM), an 80 mg mL−1 solution of spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene was spin-coated at 4000 rpm on the CH3NH3PbI3 containing 46.5 μL of Li-TFSI and 10.5 μL of tert-butylpyridine per milliliter. The substrates with HTM were left overnight in dry air in the dark at room temperature. Finally, 100 nm thick Ag was thermally evaporated on the top of the HTM to produce a completed PSC device.
2.3 Device characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system with an AM1.5G filter at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as determined by a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). The effective area of the cell was defined to be 0.04 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. IPCE spectra were measured in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial IPCE setup (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD), which was equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, filter wheel, and monochromator. Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents measured using a lock-in amplifier. The setup was calibrated against a certified silicon reference diode.
2.4 Thin film characterization
Film thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profilometer. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 25 °C. The data were collected with a 0.01° step size (2θ). A field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU8020) was used to acquire SEM images.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Sequential deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 on SnO2 ESCs

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the SnO2 nanoparticles used in this investigation. Each of these diffraction lines are commonly assigned to the tetragonal rutile crystalline phases of SnO2.38Fig. 1b shows the high magnification scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the SnO2 film prepared by spin-coating of the SnO2 nanoparticles without using a PVDF filter. The SnO2 films used in the PSCs, however, are inhomogeneous and do not have a typical porous structure so the following study of PSCs is likely based on a planar-heterojunction configuration. Both the lower and higher magnification SEM images of SnO2 nanoparticle film are also shown in Fig. S1.†

A two-step sequential deposition method was employed to produce the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer on this SnO2 film, as schematically shown in Fig. 2. To maintain the PbI2 layer with good crystallinity for effective passivation of the SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, a modified method to prepare the PbI2 films was introduced, as detailed in the Experimental section.34 As shown in Fig. 3a, with different aging times of the wet PbI2 films in N2 atmosphere in covered Petri dishes, the appearance of the PbI2 films gradually changes from transparent red-yellow with 1 min to opaque dark-yellow with 50 min. This process could be regarded as an equivalent process to solvent vapor annealing (SVA), as suggested by previous investigations on organic solar cells.39 In order to clarify the differences in the film appearances, the XRD patterns of the PbI2 films were measured and are shown in Fig. 4. With elongated SVA time, the density of the most representative XRD peak of the PbI2 nanocrystals at 2θ = 12.56° gradually increases together with the narrowing of the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). The enlarged XRD peak of the PbI2 nanocrystals at 2θ = 12.56° is shown in Fig. S2.† We employed the Scherrer formula, i.e., D = Kλ/(βcosθ), to calculate the grain size of the PbI2 nanocrystals. Here, the Scherrer constant, K, is 0.943, and the X-ray wavelength, λ, is 0.15406 nm. The FWHM of these diffraction peaks in digits are 0.39671, 0.25951, 0.22059, 0.20612, and 0.19980, which corresponds to the PbI2 crystalline size of 21.1, 32.3, 38.0, 40.6, and 41.9 nm for SVA times of 1, 10, 20, 35, and 50 min, respectively. The PbI2 crystallite size increases with increased SVA time of the PbI2 films, and the growth of the crystallite size is especially severe in the first 20 min. The SEM images of the PbI2 film surfaces with different SVA time are also depicted in Fig. 5, and in Fig. S3 of the ESI† with low magnification. Generally speaking, it is difficult to identify the crystallite size of each PbI2 crystal from the SEM image, because these PbI2 nanocrystallites aggregate along the surface, forming large domains. Interestingly, the domain size of PbI2 multi-crystals gradually increases with increased SVA time. Noticeably, there are no distinguishable cavities in the PbI2 film with 1 min SVA time, whereas the numbers and sizes of the cavities on the surface of the PbI2 film increase with further increasing SVA time until 50 min. It is expected that PbI2 films with more cavities must be more capable for CH3NH3I solution penetration during the dipping process of the sequential method. Therefore, PbI2 films with longer SVA times will be more reactive with CH3NH3I to produce the perovskite layer than those with shorter SVA times during a certain period of time.

The variation of crystallite size and the compatibility of the PbI2 films must influence the perovskite film formation. Fig. 2b shows the photo images of perovskite films prepared by dipping these SVA treated PbI2 films into CH3NH3I solution for 50 s. The perovskite films gradually change from light-brown to dark-black in color with increased SVA time. Fig. 4 shows the electronic absorption spectra of the corresponding CH3NH3PbI3 films. The absorption of the perovskite films increases throughout the long wavelength region with increased SVA time, except for that of the perovskite film obtained from 1 min SVA time, in which the absorption of PbI2 is still predominant. The absorption spectra of these perovskite films are consistent with their photo images, indicating that more PbI2 is converted into CH3NH3PbI3 with increased SVA time. The absorption spectra are consistent with the observation of the increased porosity in the PbI2 films with increased SVA time, because CH3NH3I is more conductive to infiltrate into the inner of PbI2 layer in the case of PbI2 films with more cavities (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films obtained from the PbI2 layers with different SVA times. 
The significant difference in the absorption spectra of perovskite films might be an implication of different film morphology. The SEM images of the perovskite films obtained from PbI2 layers with different SVA times are depicted in Fig. 7. The average grain diameter of the perovskite crystals increases as the SVA time of PbI2 films increases. The change in the morphology is particularly significant between the SVA times of 1 min and 10 min. Obviously, the grain size of the perovskite crystals is dependent on that of the PbI2 crystals, i.e., the smallest 21.1 nm PbI2 crystal obtained from 1 min SVA time produces the smallest CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, whereas the largest 41.9 nm PbI2 crystal obtained from 50 min SVA time produces the largest CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. It is naturally expected, therefore, that the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal must be accompanied by the consumption of PbI2 crystals. This process is usually observable from the XRD patterns of the perovskite films, as studied in many previous investigations.21,25,34 The XRD patterns of the perovskite films were also measured and are shown in Fig. 8. In the XRD patterns, the newly generated 2θ peaks appearing at 14.0°, 24.3°, 28.4°, 31.7° and 50.3° correspond to the (110), (202), (220), (310) and (404) planes of the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3, respectively.40 Interestingly, the XRD peak of the PbI2 nanocrystals at 12.56° has negligible changes after the generation of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. Given that there has been definitive evidence (absorption spectra and SEM images) of a large yield of perovskite from raw PbI2 during the dipping process, the only interpretation of the strong PbI2 signals in the XRD pattern of the perovskite films is that the remaining PbI2 in the perovskite films has retained high crystallinity. From this point of view, the 001 plane (12.56°) of the PbI2 crystal must be less reactive with CH3NH3I. The remaining PbI2 crystals are likely occurring at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3 and SnO2 ESC, because the reaction of PbI2 film with CH3NH3I in solution is a diffusion limited process. Compared to previous reports that their PbI2 phase was present in all perovskite grain boundaries and at the relevant interfaces,36,37 the occurrence of PbI2 crystals in our perovskite layers is more specifically acting as a passivation layer for charge transportation/recombination at the perovskite/SnO2 interface.

3.2 Photovoltaic performance and durability of SnO2-based perovskite solar cells
Although the above detailed characterization of the perovskite layer on SnO2 has concluded that high crystalline PbI2 remains constantly at the interface throughout different SVA times, this rare situation is not seen in any high efficiency PSCs reported so far. In fact, some investigations suggested the presence of PbI2 would lead to poor photovoltaic performance.41,42 To determine whether this design is feasible for the device performance, PSCs were fabricated with SnO2/perovskites examined in the previous section. For the convenience of comparison, the perovskite layer was fixed at 190 nm for all PSCs. Fig. 9a shows the PSC device configuration based on the SnO2 ESC. As the hole-transporter, the typical spiro-OMeTAD was employed. Fig. 9b shows the energy alignment of each component in the PSC devices.32,34,43 Here, the energy level of PbI2 is nicely aligned between that of both SnO2 and CH3NH3PbI3, indicating that PbI2 may be not only retarding the reversed electron leakage but also mediating the electron transportation from perovskite to SnO2. Fig. 10 shows a typical cross-sectional SEM image of a perovskite solar cell device obtained from PbI2 film with 10 min SVA time. Although the presence of pure PbI2 crystals in the perovskite layer is proven by the XRD patterns, the occurrence of either the pure PbI2 or the boundary of the perovskite/SnO2 interface is quite misty.

 Fig. 10  Cross-sectional SEM image of a PSC device based on SnO2 ESC. 

Fig. 11a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics (sweeping from the open-circuit to the forward bias) of the PSCs with different perovskite layers. Table 1 lists the parameters directly obtained from the J–V curves. As can be seen from the data, all the performance-related parameters including the short-circuit current (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF), and PCE are poor for the device corresponding to the PbI2 with 1 min SVA time. As the SVA time increases, the Jsc, Voc, and FF reached their maximum value at 20, 10, and 10 min, respectively. The gradually decreased Voc and FF with increased SVA time of PbI2 films from 10 min to 50 min may be due to the decrease of the amount of remnant PbI2 in the perovskite films. We suppose that remnant PbI2 suppresses detrimental electron-transfer processes to cause charge recombination/interception, and acts as a passivation effect for surface defects and charge carrier trapping so as to enhance Voc and shunt resistance, as also suggested by a previous investigation.36 Moreover, the perovskite film quality seems the highest with 10 min SVA time, suggesting that the film quality may play a role in determining the photovoltaic performance. The highest PCE of 12.3%, determined with a Jsc = 18.8 mA cm−2, a Voc = 1.08 V, and a FF = 0.60, was achieved for the perovskite layer obtained from 10 min SVA time of PbI2. Fig. 11b shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the corresponding devices in Fig. 8a. The photocurrent as integrated area under the IPCE spectra is in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V characteristics. For the PSC based on PbI2 with 1 min SVA time, the IPCE values are low over the whole spectrum. In particular, the IPCE response signal was not from the absorption of CH3NH3PbI3 but from that of PbI2. In this case, the PbI2 layer must function as an insulation layer for the perovskite free-carriers, whereas it seems that some free-carriers generated in the PbI2 layer can somehow be extracted by the electrodes. For the other PSCs with longer SVA times in PbI2 preparation, the charge carriers of the perovskite layer were efficiently extracted by the electrodes, indicating that the PbI2 crystallite at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 does not disturb the electron extraction by SnO2. Besides, the IPCE values of the optimal device reach more than 70% across a broad range of wavelength proving the excellent light-harvesting and quantum conversion of the device. In order to evaluate the composition of PbI2 in the perovskite layer in the best performing solar cells, EDX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) analysis was also carried out for the perovskite layer obtained from the PbI2 with 10 min SVA time (the EDX patterns are shown in Fig. S4†). The resultant atom% of the Pb and I elements are 25.7 and 74.3, respectively, and the atom ratio of Pb and I is approximately 1:2.9. We thus roughly calculated the fraction of PbI2 as ∼10% in the perovskite layer, which indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 is still predominantly more than the remnant PbI2.

Given that with the same SVA time for PbI2, the CH3NH3PbI3 thickness is a constant value after a certain dipping time for PbI2 in CH3NH3I solution, the amount of PbI2 left on the CH3NH3PbI3/SnO2 interface will depend on the amount of initial PbI2 reactant. We thus prepared the initial PbI2 layer with different thickness, followed by a 10 min SVA time to fabricate PSCs. In Fig. 9, we plotted the Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE values as a function of total perovskite film thickness. Generally speaking, the Jsc value increases with increased perovskite thickness, whereas in our experiments the optimal Voc and FF values were found at the perovskite thickness of ca. 190 nm. The averaged PCE reaches the maximum level at ca. 240 nm thick perovskite layer with a value of 12.0 ± 0.6%. These results indicate that adjusting the thickness of the crystallite PbI2 layer will balance a series of processes, including free carrier generation and carrier transportation/extraction (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) FF and (d) PCE as a function of perovskite film thickness (ca. 130, 190, 240 and 290 nm). Data are derived from measurements on 10 separate devices. 
As shown in Fig. 13, a champion PCE of 13.0% was achieved with a Voc of 1.08 V, a Jsc of 19.5 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.62, upon optimization of the SVA time and thickness of PbI2. This result is comparable with PSCs studied for TiO2 and ZnO having a planar-heterojunction configuration. Given that SnO2 has a much deeper CBE than those TiO2 and ZnO ESCs, this study provides a unique model system for studying those PSCs with narrow band-gap perovskite materials.

It was reported by some research groups that PSCs based on planar-heterojunction architectures are unstable over time, even without constant light soaking.19,43 It was a mystery that devices based on either TiO2 or ZnO significantly degraded to 10–30% of the initial value after only dozens of hours storage, no matter what atmosphere the devices are stored in.19,43 We also wonder if the planar-heterojunction PSCs studied in the present research are stable in ambient air. Fig. 14 shows the stability result of the SnO2-based device stored in an ambient air environment. The PCE of the SnO2-based PSC keeps almost constant over 700 hours. In comparison, a PSC device based on compact TiO2 (ref. 12) (see Fig. S5 in the ESI† for its photovoltaic performance) with planar-heterojunction prepared with the same sequential deposition method degrades apparently faster than the SnO2-based devices. This excellent durability of SnO2-based PSC may partially originate from the remnant PbI2 that prevents the direct contact of SnO2 and CH3NH3PbI3 and so reduces the possible degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 through charge injection (as the TiO2-based PSC also shows improved durability compared to the reference results19). We speculate that the lower hygroscopicity of the SnO2 compared with TiO2 also contributes to the durability of the PSC device. In addition, both oxygen vacancies and UV light induced degradation in TiO2 are well-known problems to reduce the stability of TiO2-based photovoltaic devices.44 In the present investigation, the hole selective contact is a commonly used material, i.e., spiro-OMeTAD. Thus, the durability of the devices will be severely affected by the spiro-OMeTAD layer. In fact, our PSC devices, no matter with what kind of electron selective contact, degrade significantly 1–2 months after the preparation, mainly owing to the degradation of spiro-OMeTAD. Fortunately, some inorganic hole selective contact materials, such as CuSCN and CuI,45–47 give improved stability compared with the spiro-OMeTAD, indicating that our SnO2-based PSCs have larger potential in real-world applications.

Finally, one of the reviewers suggested to preliminarily examine the photo-stability of the SnO2-based PSCs. Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the durability result of the device under simulated sunlight illumination. The PCEs of PSC devices based on both SnO2 and TiO2 decreased significantly under the simulated sunlight illumination within merely 8 h, in spite of the SnO2-based device being slightly more stable than the TiO2-based device. Interestingly, the photovoltaic performance of these PSC devices is recoverable after storage of the devices in the dark for 18 hours, indicating that the reduction of photovoltaic performance upon light illumination of the PSC devices is not due to the degradation of materials, but may be due to the ferroelectric nature of the perovskite materials that accumulate charge carriers at the interface to interfere with the electricity flow at the working conditions.
4 Conclusions
In summary, we have developed SnO2 thin films as electron selective contacts for CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells. During the process of perovskite preparation, we observed the variation of the grain size of the PbI2 layer to be dependent on the solvent vapor annealing time resulting in morphological and absorbance changes in the corresponding perovskite films. The remnant PbI2 crystallites at the SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface have a passivation effect, which is supposed to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. By optimization of the solvent vapor annealing time and the thickness of the perovskite layer, the SnO2-based devices achieved a maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.0%, which is highly durable with exposure to an ambient air environment for 30 days. This combination of ease-of-fabrication, low-temperature processing, efficient performance and excellent durability is expected to help promote the development of novel photovoltaic technology using perovskite.
