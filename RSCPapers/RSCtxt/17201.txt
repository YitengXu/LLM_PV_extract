    , Accepted 10th April 2014First published on 10th April 2014AbstractThe competition between 4I13/2–4I15/2 near-infrared downconversion emissions and visible upconversion emissions of 2H11/2/4S3/2/4F9/2–4I15/2 is a vital factor for obtaining efficient upconversion luminescence (UCL) in Er3+ and Yb3+ co-activated oxides. In this paper, we systemically studied the entire emission spectra of Er3+ ranging from 400–1700 nm in Er3+ and Yb3+ co-activated cubic Y2O3, tetragonal GdVO4 and tetragonal NaGd(WO4)2 micro-sized powders, prepared by the same sol–gel method, which have different phonon thresholds, 600 cm−1, 880 cm−1 and 1000 cm−1, respectively. It is interesting to observe that in these phosphors, the visible UCL of Er3+ relative to near-infrared emissions increase remarkably with the increase of phonon thresholds. In comparison with the UCL in the Y2O3 host, the UCL in YVO4 and tetragonal NaGd(WO4)2 was tremendously improved by 9.5- and 120-fold, respectively. The UCL intensity of the NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+ was comparable to that of the famous UCP NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. A model was proposed to explain the phonon-modulated UC process. This work is of great significance in the search for a novel, efficient UCP.
1. Introduction
The rare earth (RE) ion-activated upconversion phosphors (UCPs), which can convert a low-frequency excitation photon into a high-frequency emission photon through two or more photon processes, have attracted considerable research interests since the upconversion (UC) phenomenon was discovered in 1966 by Auzel et al.1 Because of their unique physical features, the UCPs have demonstrated a large number of potential applications, such as background lighting sources, infrared detection, solid-state lasers, bio-labels and biosensors, and solar-spectral conversion for photovoltaic devices.2–8 However, various practical applications have been hindered owing to the lower UC efficiency of the current UCPs, and thus more efficient UCPs are desired.9
The UCPs generally comprise the inorganic host, sensitizer and activator. Among various sensitizers and activators, the Er3+ and Yb3+ pair is very favorable because Er3+ ion has an energy level capable of infrared pumping that closely matches the most attractive 980 nm laser-diode wavelength, which is in fair agreement with the peak wavelength of Yb3+ ion absorption.10 Host materials are also important for obtaining efficient UCL. Previously, it was generally believed that ideal host materials needed to have low phonon energies, which is a requirement for minimizing nonradiative losses and maximizing radiative emission.11 Fluorides usually exhibit low phonon energy of (∼350 cm−1) and thus have attracted most of the previous attention.12–14 For instance, the hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ is commonly considered the most efficient UCP under the excitation of 980 nm (ref. 15) and most of the efficient UCPs originate from the NaLnF4 (Ln = La, Y, Lu, Gd) family as well as the LnF3 family.16–19 In comparison with the fluorides, oxides have more stable chemical and thermal properties and better mechanical strength; however, for most of the oxide UCPs, the efficiency/brightness of the UCL is lower than that of the fluorides, which is usually attributed to the improved nonradiative losses.20,21
Actually, for most of the activators, such as Er3+ and Tm3+, due to the complex energy levels, the excitation light cannot exactly match with the UC transitions and the UC population requires the assistance of phonons; therefore, in some cases, the appropriate phonon energy could largely modulate the population processes of the UC and positively impact the UCL. Moreover, in UCPs, the energy losses for UCL come not only from the thermal losses due to the nonradiative relaxations, but also from the competition of the UCL process with the downconversion transitions. For instance, for Er3+ ions, the visible UC emissions and near-infrared emissions of 4I13/2–4I15/2 (∼1.54 μm) can both occur under the excitation of 980 nm,22 and the two emissions compete with each other. If the near-infrared transition channels are “frozen” or suppressed, the UCL would be naturally improved.
The photon energy of the hosts is only one of the important factors to impact the strength of the UCL. Actually, there are many factors affecting the UC strength in the UCPs, such as the symmetry of host materials, lattice constants, doping concentration of the activator and sensitizer.17,23,24 For instance, in different hosts, the excitation cross sections of the Yb3+ ions at 980 nm have a wide variation due to the influence of the crystal field.25 Even in the same host material with different crystal structures (such as α-phase and β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+), the UCL properties of RE ions also demonstrate obvious differences.26 However, the knowledge related to the influence of crystal structure on the UCL of RE ions is quite limited.
In this work, in order to reveal the impact of photon energy on the UCL of Er3+, Yb3+ co-activated UCPs and obtain novel efficient oxide UCPs, we prepared Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped oxide micro-powders UCPs, tetragonal NaGd(WO4)2 and tetragonal GdVO4, as well as the well-known cubic Y2O3 by the same sol–gel method, in which the phonon thresholds of the host lattices are ∼1000, 880 and 600 cm−1, respectively.27–29 It is interesting to observe that, although NaGd(WO4)2 has the largest phonon threshold among the three materials, it demonstrates the strongest green 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2 UCL in the materials, and its intensity is enhanced as high as 120 times that of the well-known Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+. The high-excitation cross section of Yb3+ at 980 nm, high optimum concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+ and the modulation of large phonon energy on the population of the green level are capable of efficient UCL.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received without further purification. Yttrium nitrate [Y(NO3)3·6H2O], gadolinium nitrate [Gd(NO3)3·6H2O], ytterbium nitrate [Yb(NO3)3·6H2O] and erbium nitrate [Er(NO3)3·6H2O] were purchased from the National Engineering Research Centre of Rare Earth Metallurgy and Function Materials. Sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonium metatungstate, ammonium metavanadate, nitric acid and citric acid were received from the Beijing Chemical Plant (Beijing, P. R. China). All of the luminescent materials with the different molar doping concentrations were prepared by a conventional sol–gel method. First, the corresponding lanthanide and alkali metal nitrates, ammonium metatungstate, ammonium metavanadate and citric acid were dissolved in the mixture solution of deionized water and ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:1. After stirring for 30 minutes, the homogeneous transparent solutions were transferred to a 60 °C oven for 20 hours to remove the deionized water and ethanol. The mixture solution contained citric acid as the chelating agent, and the appropriate amount of nitric acid was used for dissolving ammonium metavanadate. Annealing was carried out with slowly elevating temperatures (40 °C h−1) up to 900 °C for 4 hours.
2.2 Measurement
The morphology of the samples was measured with a JEOL JSM-7500 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The phase structure of the samples was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer using a monochromatized Cu target radiation resource (λ = 1.54 Å). For the measurements of the UCL and infrared emission spectra, a continuous 980 nm was used to pump the samples. A visible photomultiplier (400–850 nm) and an infrared InAsGa detector (800–2200 nm) combined with a double-grating monochromator were used for spectral collection in the range of 400–2200 nm. The luminescent dynamics were pumped by a laser-system consisting of a Nd:YAG pumping laser (1064 nm), a third-order Harmonic-Generator (355 nm) and a tunable optical parameter oscillator (OPO, Continuum Precision II 8000). The pulse duration was 10 ns, with a repetition frequency of 10 Hz and a line width of 4–7 cm−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Sample characterization
In order to better understand the relationship of crystal structures and the UCL properties of the materials, the crystal structures of cubic Y2O3, tetragonal GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 are shown in Scheme 1.30–32 The cubic phase Y2O3 has a space group of IaTh (ref. 7) with the unit cell parameter a = 10.60 Å, in which doped RE ions can occupy two distinct sites with point-group symmetries C2 and C3i.30 The tetragonal phases GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 have the space groups of I41/amd and I41/a with the unit cell parameters a = 7.2176 Å, c = 6.3483 Å and a = 5.2440 Å, c = 11.3794 Å, respectively. The RE ions occupy the position 4a(000) for GdVO4 and the sites for both 2b and 2d with the S4 symmetry for NaGd(WO4)2.33,34

The lattice structure, particle size and morphology of the samples prepared by the sol–gel technique are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Y2O3, GdVO4, and NaGd(WO4)2 phosphors fabricated at different Yb3+ doping concentrations. According to JCPDS standard cards, all of the samples for Y2O3, GdVO4, and NaGd(WO4)2 exist in the pure phase structures, namely, cubic for Y2O3, tetragonal for GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2. The narrower X-ray diffraction peaks suggest that every sample has a larger crystalline size and an improved crystallinity. However, Fig. S1† shows a little difference among all of the XRD patterns. Compared with the corresponding standard cards, as the doping Yb3+ concentrations increase from 2% to 20% for Y2O3:Yb3+/1% Er3+, from 2% to 30% for GdVO4:Yb3+/2% Er3+ and from 5% to 80% for NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/2% Er3+, the main peaks shift slightly to the higher degree because the ionic radius of the replaced Y3+ (0.893 Å) and Gd3+ (0.938 Å) are larger than the ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.858 Å). From the analysis of XRD patterns, it also can be concluded that the Yb3+ have been effectively doped into the Y2O3, GdVO4, and NaGd(WO4)2 host lattices. According to the Scherrer formula Dhkl = Kλ/βcosθ, where hkl is the Miller index, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the full-width at half-maximum, θ is the diffraction angle, and K is a constant, the estimated mean crystallite size of all the samples are in micrometers. Fig. 1(d) presents the SEM images of Y2O3:5% Yb3+/1% Er3+, GdVO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+, NaGd(WO4)2:40% Yb3+/2% Er3+ and the NaYF4 commercial phosphors (15% Yb3+/3% Er3+). It can be seen that all the samples prepared demonstrate irregular shapes and their particle sizes range within several hundreds of nanometers. In this case, the influence of particle size on the UCL can be neglected.

3.2 UCL of Er3+ ions in different host lattices
The UCL properties of the UCPs depend strongly on the concentrations of the doping ions of the activator and the sensitizer. In order to reveal the concentration-dependent UCL properties and obtain the optimum concentration of doping ions in different host lattices, the Er3+ and Yb3+ concentration-dependent UCL spectra of the Y2O3, GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 samples are shown in Fig. 2(a)–(f), respectively. In the Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ powders (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)), green 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 transitions and red 4F9/2–4I15/2 can be indentified, and the red emissions are dominant as the Yb3+ is sufficiently high. The intensity ratio of the red 4F9/2–4I15/2 to the green 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition varies greatly with the doping concentration of the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. With the increased doping concentration of Yb3+ and Er3+, the intensity ratio of red to green gradually increases. As Yb3+ concentration is fixed at 20%, and Er3+ concentration increases to 5% in molar ratio, the green emission of 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 nearly completely disappears. Similar results were observed by Capobianco et al. and in our previous literatures; moreover, this phenomenon can be attributed to the improved cross-relaxation process of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 between nearby Er3+ ions.24,35 The concentration enhancement of the Er3+ ions and Yb3+ ions can both increase the Er3+ ions in excited states.24 It should be noted that in nanosized Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+, the intensity of red to green increases with the decrease of particle size owing to the involvement of large phonon modes on the surfaces of the nanoparticles, such as OH− groups.36 Conversely, in the GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 samples, the green emissions of 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 are dominant all the time, and the red emissions of 4F9/2 nearly completely disappear (see Fig. 2(c)–(f)). There exist two possible reasons for this phenomenon: (1) the populating for the 4F9/2 state is ineffective due to the ineffective cross-relaxation process of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2. (2) Most of the electron populations on 4F9/2 further relax to the lower excited states because of the highly improved nonradiative relaxation rates on 4F9/2. If (2) is the dominant mechanism, we should observe improved transitions of 4I13/2–4I15/2; however, the result is opposite, indicating that (1) is the most possible reason for this point. In Fig. 2(c)–(f), it can be also seen that with the increase in Er3+ or Yb3+ concentrations, the intensity ratio of 2H11/2–4I15/2to 4S3/2–4I15/2 increases considerably, which can be mainly attributed to improved local thermal effect due to the improved absorption of Er3+ and Yb3+.37Fig. 3(a)–(f) show the dependence of the integral intensity of the Er3+ ions on the Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations in the Y2O3, GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 samples. According to the experimental results, the following three optimal samples for the three kinds of materials were determined: Y2O3:5% Yb3+/1% Er3+, GdVO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ and NaGd(WO4)2:40% Yb3+/2% Er3+.

All the UCL spectra were measured at a fixed power density of 18 mW mm−2 under 980 nm excitation.

Yb3+ concentration-dependent UCL spectra of (b) Y2O3:Yb3+/1% Er3+; (d) GdVO4:Yb3+/2% Er3+; and (f) NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/2% Er3+. 
To accurately compare the UCL intensity in different hosts, the spectral measurement was repeatedly performed for the three optimum samples under the same conditions. Fig. 4 shows the UCL emission spectra of the Y2O3:5% Yb3+/1% Er3+, GdVO4:20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ and NaGd(WO4)2:40% Yb3+/2% Er3+ pumped by a 980 nm LD with an output power density of 18 mW mm−2. It is exciting to observe that the total integrated intensity of the UCL are enhanced by 120-fold for NaGd(WO4)2 and 9.5-fold for GdVO4 in contrast to Y2O3. For comparison, note that the emissions of Er3+ ions in GdVO4 and Y2O3 are magnified 5 and 50 folds, respectively. Moreover, the UCL of the NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+ was compared with the most efficient hexagonal NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ commercial phosphor, and the result shows that the green emission of NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/Er3+ is comparable to that of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ (as shown in Fig. S2†).

For any mechanism, the visible output intensity (IV) will be proportional to some power (n) of the infrared excitation (IIR) power: IV ∝ IIRn, where the value of n presents the number of IR photons absorbed per visible photon emitted. However, the saturation effect will induce n to deviate from the required photon number, depending on the competition between the linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states.38 Based on the theory,24 for a two-photon populating process, if the linear decay is dominant, the slope is close to 2; if the downconversion is dominant, the slope is close to 1. Fig. 5 shows the logarithmic plots of the emission intensity as a function of excitation power for the green emission in the samples of Y2O3:20% Yb3+/1% Er3+, GdVO4:20% Yb3+/1% Er3+ and NaGd(WO4)2:20% Yb3+/1% Er3+. The values of n in Fig. 5 are determined to be 1.75, 1.41, and 1.56, respectively, in Y2O3, GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 with the same doping concentration. The decreased value of n in GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 indicates that in these materials, the relative contribution of upconversion relative to the linear decay increases in contrast to that in Y2O3. As the excitation power is strong enough, the intensity of the UCL decreases with the excitation power, in all three samples, which can be attributed to the local thermal effect induced by laser exposure.10

The power dependence of UCL NaGd(WO4)2:Yb3+/2% Er3+ samples with different Yb3+ doping concentrations was also studied, as shown in Fig. 6. The values of n were determined to be 1.86, 1.60, 1.44, 1.39, 1.37, 1.32 and 1.29, respectively, for the samples with Yb3+ concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 80%. Apparently, the value of n decreases gradually with the increasing Yb3+ concentration in the range of 1–2, indicating the improved contribution of the upconversion process (see the inset of Fig. 6). The decreased power density at the maximum intensity implies an improved local thermal effect with the increasing doping concentration of Yb3+ ions.24

The lattice structure is also an important factor in affecting the UCL. The samples with the different host lattices could provide a distinct surrounding for the sensitizer and activator. For example, the varied phase structure leads to the different distributions of the doping ions and alters the interaction between them.17 In order to reveal the influence of lattice structures on the UCL of the tungstate groups, the UCL of the monoclinic phase KGd(WO4)2 samples was studied, as shown in Fig. S3.† The optimal doping concentration of KGd(WO4)2 was determined to be 30% Yb3+/3% Er3+ in molar ratio, and the UCL of optimal KGd(WO4)2 is comparable to that of NaGd(WO4)2:40% Yb3+/2% Er3+, including the ratio of UCL to DCL. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lattice structure of tungstate has only a negligible influence on its UCL.
3.3 Origin of upconversion enhancement in NaGd(WO4)2 and GdVO4
In NaGd(WO4)2 and GdVO4, the optimal UCL strengths of Er3+ UCL are improved considerably over that of Y2O3, and we consider that this can be attributed to the following three facts. Firstly, in NaGd(WO4)2 and GdVO4, the optimum doping concentration of the activators and sensitizers (20% Yb3+/2% Er3+ for GdVO4 and 40% Yb3+/2% Er3+ for a NaGd(WO4)2) are largely improved than that in Y2O3(5% Yb3+/1% Er3+). This means that the luminescent centers, particularly the excited luminescent centers, are largely improved, which is significant for the intensity enhancement of the UCL. This can be essentially attributed to the influence of lattice structures and local environment surrounding the activators and sensitizers on the ET process and cross-relaxation process of the RE ions. Secondly, the sensitizing of Yb3+ is an important factor for improving Er3+ UCL, and in different hosts, the sensitizing ability of Yb3+ to Er3+ is quite different. Table 1 lists the central wavelength, the emission cross section, and line-band width and lifetimes of the 2F7/2–2F5/2 transition for Yb3+, the central location of 2F7/2–2F5/2 absorption band and thermal conductivity of Y2O3:Yb3+, YVO4:Yb3+ and KGd(WO4)2:Yb3+ crystals, in which the hosts are the same or similar to the present hosts.39 From Table 1, it can be concluded that the emission cross section, as well as the absorption cross section of Yb3+ in NaGd(WO4)2 and Gd(WO4)2, increases greatly (∼2.25 and ∼7 times, respectively) in comparison to that in Y2O3. This shows that the sensitizing ability of Yb3+ to Er3+ in NaGd(WO4)2 and Gd(WO4)2 should be improved greatly compared with that in Y2O3. Thirdly, we consider that the highly improved UCL in NaGd(WO4)2 and GdVO4 is also related to the modulation of photon energy and crystal symmetry in the processes of UC population and emission, particularly the competition between the visible UCL and the NIR downconversion luminescence (DCL).

To reveal the competition between the visible UCL and NIR DCL, the entire emission spectra, from visible to NIR, of Y2O3, GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2 samples with the same doping concentrations of Yb3+ and Er3+ (20%, 1%) are shown in Fig. 7. It is obvious that in the GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2, the absolute intensity of UCL and DCL both increase in comparison to that in Y2O3 (see Fig. 7(a)). Based on Fig. 7(b), the normalized emission spectra and the intensity ratios of visible UCL intensity to the total emission intensity (UCL + DCL) are deduced, to be 0.10, 0.15, and 0.46 in Y2O3, GdVO4, and NaGd(WO4)2, respectively. It should be also noted that in the Y2O3 sample in addition to the 4I13/2–4I5/2 transition around 1.54 μm, the transition of 4I9/2–4I13/2 around 1650 nm can be also identified. This shows that there are at least two population paths for the 4I13/2 state of Y2O3: (1) the nonradiative relaxation of 4I11/2–4I13/2, which requires only one photon for excitation. (2) After two-photon excitation, electrons on 4F9/2 nonradiative relax to 4I9/2, and then radiatively transit from 4F9/2 to 4I13/2. This process was also observed in the Er2O3 powders40 and might be a main reason for the relative increase of NIR emissions in Y2O3.

Fig. 8 shows possible upconversion populating processes of the Yb3+, Er3+ co-doped samples under 980 nm excitation (similar to our model), which was previously supposed to explain the size-dependent and phase-dependent UC in the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals.17 As drawn in the schematic, in micro-sized oxide materials, the involvement of large-energy phonons such as OH bonds due to surface adsorption can be neglected, and the photon thresholds of all the host materials are not very high (<1100 cm−1). The nonradiative relaxation of 4I11/2–4I13/2 requires at least three photons (for NaGd(WO4)2, three photons are required; for GdVO4, four photons are required; and for Y2O3, five photons are required); thus, it can be neglected in comparison to the second step of the ET process on 4I11/2. In this case, the main upconversion population channels can be expressed as follows: 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+),(1) 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2(Yb3+) + 4F7/2(Er3+).(2)

Thus, there are two paths for the depopulation of 4F7/2: one is the nonradiative relaxation of 4F7/2–2H11/2/4S3/2, and the other is the cross relaxation of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2. Actually, the ratio of green to red (GRR) depends strongly on the competition between the nonradiative relaxation of 4F9/2–2H11/2/4S3/2 and the cross relaxation of 2F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 because the former process leads to the green 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2 emission, whereas the latter process leads to the red 4F9/2–4I15/2. In GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4) two photons are required for the nonradiative relaxation of 4F7/2–2H11/2 (the energy gap of 4F7/2 and 2H11 is about 1600 cm−1), whereas at least three photons are required in Y2O3. In the former case, the nonradiative transition of 4F7/2–2H11/2 is dominant in contrast to the cross-relaxation process of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2, whereas in the latter case, the cross-relaxation rate is comparable to the nonradiative relaxation rate of 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2. Therefore, due to the modulation of photon energy, the UCL of GdVO4:Yb3+/Er3+ and NaGd(WO4):Yb3+/Er3+ demonstrates pure green color, whereas that of Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ demonstrates yellow color, which depends strongly on the concentration of Yb3+. It should be noted that the crystal structure may also influence the competition between the nonradiative relaxation of 2H11/2/4S3/2–4I15/2 and the cross-relaxation of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2. If the activator ions distribute randomly on the lattice sites of the host, some pairs with close proximity will be formed, thus the cross-relaxation process occurs easily. On the other hand, if the activator ions distribute strictly on the lattice sites of the host, the cross-relaxation process does not occur easily. A general example for this point is the UCL of an α-phase and a β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+.41 Based on the schematic, it can be also concluded that if the red level of 4F9/2 can be effectively populated, then the extra two-photon population channel for the NIR emission of 4I13/2–4I15/2 will be effective; thus, the relative contribution of the DCL will increase. Actually, the two-photon channel might be a dominant population path of 4I13/2 for Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ because the one-step population of 4I11/2–4I13/2 requires at least five photons. The easily understandable process of the UCL and DCL modulated by the phonon threshold is shown in Scheme 2.

3.4 UCL dynamics
UCL dynamics are a powerful method to study the microscopic process of UCL. In order to reveal the difference of the upconversion processes of Er3+, Yb3+ co-doped in the three different hosts, Y2O3, GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2, the UCL dynamics of green 4S3/2–4I15/2 and red 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions for these samples with varied doping concentrations of Er3+ and Yb3+ are systemically studied and compared, as shown in Fig. 9. Note that in these samples, both the 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions decay nearly exponentially; thus, the exponential decay time constants are deduced in the light of the luminescent dynamics. An obvious difference of the dependence of the decay-time constant on the concentration of Yb3+ and Er3+ was identified in different host lattices. For the Y2O3:Yb3+/Er3+(see Fig. 9(a) and (b)), it is apparent that for both the transitions of 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2, the decay-time constants only decrease with the increase of Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations. This can be mainly attributed to cross ET processes happening on the corresponding excited states. For the green level, the possible cross ET process of 2H11/2 + 4I15/2 → 4I9/2 + 4I13/2, whereas for the red level, the possible cross ET process of 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 → 4F7/2 + 4I11/2.42 Moreover, with the increase of Yb3+ concentration, the back ET from the Er3+ to Yb3+ also might happen in the corresponding excited states.37

Conversely, in the GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2, both the decay-time constants of 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 transitions first increase with the doping concentrations of Er3+ and Yb3+, approach a maximum at a certain value, and then decrease with the further increase of concentration (see Fig. 9(c)–(f)). The improvement of decay-time constants with the increase of Er3+ and Yb3+ concentrations can be attributed to supplementary population due to the ET processes of other Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, whereas the suppression of decay-time constants can be attributed to the cross-relaxation processes happening in the corresponding energy states as well as the possible back ET from Er3+ to Yb3+.
4. Conclusions
In this work, the UCL of Yb3+ and Er3+ co-doped GdVO4, NaGd(WO4)2 and Y2O3, which have different phonon thresholds, were systemically studied and compared. Several new points should be noted. First, due to the modulation of large phonons of host lattices, the UCL in GdVO4 and NaGd(WO4)2, demonstrated dominant green emissions of 2H11/2, 4S3/2–4I15/2 all the time, indicating that the nonradiative transition of 4F7/2–2H11/2 played an overpowering role compared to the cross-relaxation process of 4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2 in the population. Second, in the three hosts, the intensity ratio of the UCL to the near-infrared DCL for Er3+ increased greatly with the increase of phonon thresholds, indicating that the modulation of suitable photon energy is an important factor for improving the competition of the UCL in oxide compounds. Third and most important, compared with the optimal Y2O3:5% Yb3+/1% Er3+, the UCL of NaGd(WO4)2:40% Yb3+/2% Er3+ was enhanced by a factor of as high as ∼120 and even comparable to that of the NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ commercial powders. Moreover, as the most efficient UC phosphor in the three oxide compounds, NaGd(WO4)2 demonstrates the strongest excitation cross section of Yb3+ around 980 nm, the highest optimum concentration of Yb3+ and the largest intensity ratio of UCL to DCL due to the modulation of large phonons. This work implies that efficient UCL phosphors could be also obtained in some oxide compounds with suitable phonon thresholds.
