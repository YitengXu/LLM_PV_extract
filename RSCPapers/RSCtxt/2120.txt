    , Accepted 21st July 2015First published on 23rd July 2015AbstractFor organic films, remarkably enhanced red–NIR broad spectral absorption was achieved via the incorporation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using a simple and facile preparation. The relevant thermal evaporation method has produced size-controllable AuNPs in the range of 0–20 nm diameter. The potential use of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) enhanced organic photosensitive diodes (OPDs) as sensitive broadband sensors was discussed in this context. Here we showed that, by combining organic heterojunctions with size-controllable plasmonic AuNPs, the efficiency of organic photodetectors could be increased by up to one order of magnitude, because of LSPR and scattering effects of the AuNPs. Fabricated OPD devices showed a large photoresponse under radiation from wavelengths between 650 and 830 nm, accompanied by a low power consumption profile. A schematic energy level model combined with theoretical simulation analysis was proposed to explain the experimental data. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrated the broadest photosensitivity with high responsivity from AuNP-based photodetectors, proving the potential of AuNPs as a promising material for efficient optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Broad spectral absorption of light from the visible to the near-infrared (NIR) region is of significant interest for all kinds of industrial and scientific applications, and can be further applied in, for example, image sensing, communication, environmental monitoring, remote control, day and night surveillance, space exploration, and military applications.1 As for broad-spectral absorption materials, currently, one of the most important applications is the broadband photodetector.2,3 This is an optoelectronic device that absorbs light of a certain wavelength region and generates electron–hole pairs, and then produces an electrical signal due to the separation and directional movement of the electron–hole pairs. It will be of major interest to make broadband photodetectors for innovative applications. For example, broadband photodetectors could be loaded into spectrometric analyzers so that one photodetector could detect light from ultraviolet, visible, to infrared. However, to date, separate sensors or materials have still been required for different subbands from the visible to NIR wavelength range. Therefore, it is still a challenge to develop facile, high-performance and broad-response photodetectors. In general, the broadband photodetector consists of a photoconductor,2 a phototransistor4,5 and a photodiode,3,6 formed by either a multi-materials blend or a single material. Among them, metal nanoparticles-based photodetectors (especially gold nanoparticles) have drawn particular attention.5–7
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), three-dimensional submicrometre-size nanostructures of gold atoms with unique physical and chemical properties different from those of the bulk state or atoms,8–10 have recently attracted significant interest in photoelectric applications for realizing, for example, optically switchable transistors,5,11 photovoltaic cells,12,13 light-emitting diodes,14 surface plasmonic devices7,9,15,16 and photodetectors17–19 due to the quantum size effect resulting in specific electronic structures.20,21 For example, Liu and co-workers reported a photodetector made by integrating the plasmonic structure of AuNPs with graphene, thereby achieving greatly enhanced photocurrent and external quantum efficiency up to 1500%.5 Lu et al. described a cooperative plasmonic effect for improving the performance of polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells by mixing Ag and Au nanoparticles into the anode buffer layer, showing superior light absorption enhancement with a power conversion efficiency of 8.67%.22 As for photo detection, the most impressive advantage of AuNPs could be their tunable absorption ability13 for incident light over a broad wavelength range owing to their nanoscale island or layer size. According to the publication in ref. 23 this advantage mainly depends on the AuNP shape, size, crystal structure, and the dielectric parameters of the surrounding environment, which provide an alternative strategy to realize broad spectral organic photodetectors. The origin of the optical property is explained in terms of increased resonant light absorption of AuNPs because of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect.5,7,13,19
To confirm the broad spectral absorption of AuNPs and further achieve a practical application of photodetection, an organic photosensitive diode (OPD) architecture was adopted to fabricate a photodetector by introducing AuNPs into an organic matrix. OPDs are a newly emerging organic device drawing significant attention3,24,25 due to their photodetection combined with light weight, flexibility, large-scale yields, and low cost of organic materials.6,26,27 For the OPD, fullerene (C60) and 4,4′-N,N′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino] biphenyl (NPB) are chosen as n-type and p-type materials, respectively, to form the junction diode, because C60 is a commonly-used and stable n-type semiconductor with a very high electron mobility (>1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and NPB is a commonly-used p-type semiconductor with a hole mobility of about 7.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.28 He and co-workers also have proved that the NPB/C60 based diode structure has excellent device characteristics.29 Additionally, the most significant consideration is that both materials have nearly no photoabsorption in the 600 to 900 nm wavelength range, which can be approximately regarded as a configuration without any influence on the red–NIR resonant absorption of AuNPs.
Herein, we proposed a methodology, by optimizing the deposited thickness of ultrathin gold films to control the size of AuNPs, thereby successfully demonstrating remarkably enhanced broad-spectral absorption via the incorporation of AuNPs into organic heterojunction interfaces. Further, two kinds of OPDs were fabricated simultaneously. One was fabricated as a reference device. The other one was used as a plasmonic absorption device. The photoresponse characteristics of the devices were systematically examined under the broad light range from 650 nm to 830 nm. Through comparative analysis of the two photodetectors, it can be found that the plasmonic device showed much better performance in this broad wavelength range. These results demonstrated that the vacuum thermal deposition technique could achieve size-controllable AuNPs, which were considered to be promising candidates for applications in high sensitivity and broad-response photodetectors.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the ultrathin AuNPs layer
The size-controllable AuNPs were fabricated by the traditional vacuum thermal evaporation technique, as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The preparation method was conducted by evaporating 99.999% pure Au wires to form AuNPs in a high vacuum chamber. A glass baffle was adopted in order to control the termination or continuation for the AuNPs’ deposition. Significantly, a predeposition was implemented to remove any impurity effects prior to the normal thermal evaporation process by shutting the glass baffle for a certain time interval. A crystal oscillator was installed in the vicinity of the substrate (in close contact with a heater) to achieve real-time monitoring of the deposition thickness through equipping and connecting a thickness monitor. The deposition rate was fixed at 0.2–0.3 Å s−1 by using a voltage regulator connected with a voltmeter. The thickness-dependent parameters for our system were calibrated by using a surface profilometer (Veeco Dektak 8). The measurement accuracy of the thickness-monitor system was ±0.1 Å for gold deposition. The whole preparation process was carried out at room temperature, and the chamber pressure was less than 1 × 10−3 Pa. Herein, the size-controllable AuNPs were achieved by optimizing the deposited thickness of ultrathin gold films under a certain substrate temperature and deposition rate. To the best of our knowledge, the vacuum thermal deposition of AuNPs is a comparatively simple and facile fabrication technology in contrast with other synthetic strategies for AuNPs.8

2.2. Materials and fabrication of OPDs
C60 was purchased from Luminescence Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan, and NPB and 2, 9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1, 10-phenanthroline (BCP) from Jilin OLED Co. Ltd. China, respectively, and used as received. Devices were fabricated on 30 Ω per square patterned indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates, which were ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water (Millipore, nominal 18 MΩ cm), and were dried by blowing N2 gas and baked in an oven with a temperature of 60 °C for 30 minutes. For the experimental device (plasmonic device), highly purified NPB was firstly deposited onto the ITO substrate at a rate of 0.28 Å s−1. Following that, nanoscale gold was thermally evaporated onto the NPB films, thereby forming AuNPs. C60, BCP and aluminum (Al) were sequentially evaporated onto the aforementioned substrate and corresponding deposition rates were 0.28 Å s−1, 0.33 Å s−1 and 0.42 Å s−1, respectively. By using some appropriate masks, device structures were obtained as shown in Fig. 2. The film thicknesses were 3 nm for the gold nano-island layers, around 15 nm for the NPB layers, 50 nm for the C60 layers, 15 nm for the BCP layers, and 100 nm for the Al contacts. During all the materials deposition, the chamber pressure was kept at the value of less than 2 × 10−3 Pa. For a systematic comparison, in the same way, the reference device (without AuNPs in the interface of NPB/C60) was fabricated simultaneously, and all devices were deposited in the same batch.

2.3. Measurements and characterizations
All the measurements were carried out immediately after the devices were taken out of the thermal evaporation chamber, using an organic semiconductor characterization system in the dark and under illumination. The morphological and structural information of the AuNPs was obtained at the nanoscale using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800 II, Japan), a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Tecnai™ G2 F30, FEI, US) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX, AMETEK Co., Ltd), high-angle annular dark-field and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD, Japan). X-ray diffraction (X'Pert PRO PHILIPS with Cu Kα radiation, Almelo, the Netherlands) was employed to study the structure of the samples. For optical absorption measurements, 15 nm NPB, 50 nm C60, and the films of NPB (15 nm)/AuNPs/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (15 nm) with different gold nano-island thickness were vacuum deposited on cleaned quartz substrates. A TU-1901 spectrometer was used for the measurements of the absorption spectra. Raman spectra were recorded on a J. Y. HR800 Raman spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) with 532 nm diode laser excitation. In order to measure the photo effect, a red laser diode (650 nm, 125 mW cm−2), a NIR laser diode (830 nm, 720 mW cm−2) and a thermo AM 1.5 solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) were used. The variation of optical power was realized by inserting neutral filters before the laser diode. Optical responses of the AuNPs were simulated using a commercial finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) package CST STUDIO SUITE™.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Absorption property studies
UV–visible spectroscopy was one of the most widely used techniques to study the optical characterization of the films. Fig. 3 shows the optical absorption spectra of 15 nm NPB, 50 nm C60, and films of NPB (15 nm)/AuNPs/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (15 nm) structures with different gold nano-island thicknesses. The absorption peaks of C60 and NPB were confirmed in the range of ca. 200–500 nm, and 200–400 nm, respectively. The films of NPB (15 nm)/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (15 nm) structures also show scarcely any absorption after 650 nm red light. It is worth mentioning that a remarkably enhanced absorption was found between 600 nm and 900 nm when different thickness AuNPs were deposited in the interface of the NPB/C60 heterojunction, which could not be due to the absorptions of C60, NPB and BCP, but supported the LSPR absorption of AuNPs between 550 nm and 900 nm. As the particle size increases, the nanoparticle resonance red-shifts. This phenomenon can be observed in Fig. 3, which is also consistent with some publications.13,23 Additionally, a uniform red–NIR broad spectral absorption was obtained when the size of the AuNPs was 3 nm, which was likely due to the effect of the nanoparticle size relative to the absorption and scattering cross-sections.23 This was very important for broad photoresponse detectors. In this regard, it is obvious that the incorporation of AuNPs into the organic-semiconductor matrix would enhance the light absorption and conversion efficiency.

3.2. Crystal structure and morphology characterizations
The XRD patterns recorded for both organic films (NPB, C60 and BCP) and gold nanoparticles show some intense peaks in the whole spectrum of 2θ values ranging from 5° to 90°. Fig. 4 shows XRD measurements of the quartz/NPB/AuNPs/C60/BCP film structure with different gold nano-island thicknesses. According to the publication in ref. 30 the broad diffraction peaks at 2θ values of about 20° observed in Fig. 4, match the (220) and (311) crystalline planes of C60. The broad nature of the XRD peaks can be attributed to the nanocrystalline nature of the C60 grains. The presence of intense peaks for the gold nanoparticles, emerging at about 38.3°, 44.5°, 64.7°, 77.8° and 81.8°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) planes, respectively, was indexed as the crystalline gold face centered cubic phase. The standard XRD patterns for gold were similar [Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file no: 01–1174 for Au]. Thus, the XRD patterns clearly show that the gold nanoparticles formed using the thermal deposition technique were crystalline in nature. Additionally, waterfall plots of the XRD measurements of Fig. 4 are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†), which indicate that the excessively thick AuNPs (greater than 6 nm) affect the subsequent growth of the C60 films, leading to a decrease in the crystallinity and a further depression in the charge carrier transport. Therefore, the optimized thickness for AuNPs in the device structure was ca. 3 nm with respect to both broad spectral absorption and charge transport in C60.

Furthermore, FESEM and HRTEM were used to confirm the morphology of the AuNPs formed by vacuum–thermal deposition, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Indeed, the whole surface of the substrate was evenly covered with AuNPs. One can clearly see these AuNPs were essentially spherical and appeared to be reasonably quasi-monodisperse. The particles were well separated and did not show a periodic order. Fig. 5(c) shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained from the AuNPs shown in Fig. 5(b). The Scherrer ring pattern characteristic of face centered cubic (fcc) gold was clearly observed, showing that the structures from the TEM images were nanocrystalline in nature. This observation was also consistent with the results in the aforementioned XRD measurements. Furthermore, the AuNPs size histogram derived from the particles in the HRTEM micrographs is shown in Fig. 5(d). The statistical result indicated that the particle size distribution was approximately in line with a Gauss distribution centered at ca. 3 nm. In order to explicate the size-controllable AuNPs by optimizing the thermally deposited thickness of ultrathin gold films, we also performed TEM structural analysis of the thermally deposited AuNPs with increased thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 6. It could be inferred reasonably that the AuNPs’ size gradually increased with the deposited thickness of ultrathin gold films, which is consistent with the TEM images. The TEM images in Fig. 6 indicated that the AuNPs were size-controllable in the range of 0–20 nm (Fig. 6(a)–(h)) by optimizing the thermally deposited thickness of ultrathin gold films. In order to obtain clearer details of the crystalline phases in the size-controllable AuNPs, a HRTEM technique was employed, as shown in the insets of Fig. 6. We find that the single AuNPs were almost monocrystalline with a primary phase (111) when the size was less than 4 nm. Whereas they became polycrystalline as the size increased. It was worth noting that the AuNPs grew into large-size nano-islands when the thickness of the gold films continued to further increase (Fig. 6(i)), and these nano-islands were almost connected together. As a whole, the thermally deposited AuNPs were size-controllable (Fig. 6(a), (c), (e), (g), and (i)) and polycrystalline, and the proportion of the main crystal phase (111) decreased with the increased size (Fig. 6(b), (d), (f), (h), and (j)). Indeed, the controllable size of the AuNPs was also related to the substrate temperature and deposition rate of materials. So further optimization of the preparation process is a necessary study in the future.

3.3. Device performance
To examine the LSPR effects of AuNPs in an OPD device configuration, we conducted I–V studies for the specific devices with and without AuNPs in the interface of the NPB/C60 heterojunction. According to the absorption properties depicted in Fig. 3, we selected two specific lasers (wavelength: 650 nm and 830 nm) and a standard AM 1.5 solar simulator to characterize the device performance. Fig. 7–9 show the typical I–V characteristics of the devices measured in the dark and under illumination of a 650 nm laser, an 830 nm laser and an AM 1.5 solar simulator, respectively, among which panels (a) and (b) are the linear plot and the half logarithmic plot for the reference device and panels (c) and (d) are the corresponding plots for the plasmonic device, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the I–V curves under illumination intersected with those in the dark approximately at a single point, which was similar to that observed by Kumar et al. in an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device based on a CuPc/C60 heterojunction,31 and the voltage of the intersection point was regarded as the built-in voltage of the device, resulting from the photovoltaic effects. A weak photovoltaic effect was observed, where the short current Isc and open circuit voltage Voc were small, as shown in Fig. 7–9. For comparison, all measurements were conducted in the same applied voltage range with different incident optical powers. For the OPDs both a dark current (Idark) and a photocurrent (Iph) were measured. It is interesting to find that the plasmonic device has an enhanced Idark compared to that of the reference device; additionally, the Iph of the plasmonic device remarkably improved more than the reference device in the case of the 650 nm laser (Fig. 7), 830 nm laser (Fig. 8) and AM 1.5 solar illumination (Fig. 9). A photocurrent of hundreds of microamperes was generated under illumination at wavelengths of 650 nm and 830 nm for plasmonic OPDs, much higher than the photocurrent (∼10 μA magnitude) generated in a pristine OPD under the same illumination conditions. The enhancement of the photocurrent in a spectral region where the C60 and NPB have almost no absorption was a clear indication that the electron–hole pairs were created in the AuNP itself.

To further characterize quantitatively the optoelectronic properties of the devices, we evaluated the device performance with respect to three critical parameters to determine the sensitivity for an OPD. The spectrum responsivity (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) represent the ability to provide photo-generated carriers per single incident photon. R and EQE can be expressed as R = ΔI/PS and EQE = tlife/ttran = hcR/(eλ), where tlife and ttran are the lifetime of the carriers and the charge transport time between electrodes, respectively; ΔI is the difference between the current under photo-excitation and the dark current; P is the light power intensity irradiated on the device; λ is the wavelength of the incident light; and S is the effective irradiated area of the device (S = 1.766 mm2). In addition, the detectivity (D*) is another important parameter for photodetectors, which indicates the measure of detector sensitivity. The detectivity (unit: Jones, 1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) can be defined as D* = R/(2qJdark)1/2, where Jdark is the dark current density. The R, EQE and D* of the OPDs were estimated by measuring the I–V characteristics under different illumination powers, as shown in Fig. 7–9. The current increased gradually as the illumination power increased, consistent with the photo-gating mechanism proposed below. Fig. S2† shows the R, EQE and D* values of the OPDs as a function of the light power. Compared with the reference OPDs, the plasmonic OPDs exhibited about an order of magnitude improvement of photosensitivity performance considering the three parameters above. As shown in Table 1, D* was found to exceed 1011 Jones when illuminated with 20 μW of 650 nm laser light for the plasmonic OPDs. The value of D* was expected to exceed 1014 Jones at an illumination power of 1 nW because the value increased as the illumination power decreased.32 Importantly, relatively high R (155 mA W−1) and EQE (29.64%) values were obtained under 650 nm wavelength irradiation for the plasmonic OPDs, which were both ∼10-fold higher than those for the reference OPDs. Similarly, the plasmonic OPDs, under 830 nm laser and AM 1.5 solar illumination, also displayed an apparent improvement in photodetection (details in Table 1). It is interesting to mention that the plasmonic OPDs showed a remarkably enhanced and balanced broadband detection no matter which of the three illumination sources was used. The high value of R for red–NIR broadband detection was much larger than that for the photodetector based on a SnS2 nanosheet microsphere film achieved by Tao et al. in 2014,2 and the EQE and D* for red–NIR regions were also higher than those from relevant publications33–37 in recent years. More importantly, to our knowledge, this was the broadest range detection reported for an AuNPs-based photodetector device. The results above clearly demonstrate that OPDs combined with AuNPs hold high potential in next-generation broadband OPDs for red–NIR regions. Note that the photocurrent (current as a function of the illuminated laser power) was proportional to the applied voltage under illumination. So the R, EQE and D* were voltage-dependent, and increased linearly as the applied voltage was increased. The high optoelectronic parameters above were all obtained even at a very low applied voltage of −0.4 V, indicating that our plasmonic OPDs offered a low power consumption profile.

3.4. Theoretical analysis and mechanistic explanation
To find the origin of the improved optoelectronic performance due to the optical effect of the AuNPs for plasmonic OPDs, we carried out Raman spectroscopy measurements. The Raman scattering spectra of the quartz/NPB/AuNPs/C60/BCP films with different gold nano-island thicknesses are shown in Fig. 10. The Raman spectra exhibit an obvious difference with or without AuNPs in the films. The positions of the Raman peaks did not shift whereas the intensity at 1458 cm−1 was enhanced remarkably compared to the sample without AuNPs. This phenomenon was observed as the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) effect,9,16 which greatly increased the signal by utilizing the regions of intense electric field created near the granular AuNP surfaces. The SERS effect can be understood as resulting from localized surface plasmon modes resonantly excited by the incident laser.38 In the case of our samples, Raman scattering signals from the films were obviously enhanced by the aggregated AuNPs in the interface of the NPB/C60 heterojunction, which indicated that LSPR was certainly generated around the aggregated AuNPs, even in NPB or C60.39
 Fig. 10  Raman spectra of the films of NPB (15 nm)/AuNPs/C60 (50 nm)/BCP (15 nm) with different gold nano-island thicknesses. All films were deposited on the surface of quartz glasses. 
In order to verify the observations above, we conducted a theoretical analysis and simulation for the AuNPs. Generally, localized surface plasmons (LSPs) are associated with the collective oscillations of electrons confined locally by metal nanostructures.7 As shown in Fig. 11(a), the most representative examples of LSPs are AuNPs. The particle plasmons are excited when the frequency of the incident photons matches the resonance frequency of the AuNPs, resulting in the formation of an electric dipole and near field. Their resonance wavelength depends on the particle shape, size, and the dielectric parameters of the surrounding environment.40 According to the publication in ref. 13 combined with our absorption measurements, larger AuNPs scatter light more efficiently, whereas smaller ones absorb most of the photons. Therefore, the AuNP with 3 nm diameter demonstrated the enhanced red–NIR broad spectral absorption for OPD applications. Considering that complex physical effects in the neighborhood of AuNPs exist, we simplified the physical model and investigated four primary physical effects when the AuNPs were excited by a laser: (i) exciton generation, (ii) exciton coupling, (iii) exciton dissociation and (iv) exciton recombination, as depicted in Fig. 11(b). In our OPDs, the photo-physical process, firstly, can be interpreted by the concept of “hot excitons” which possess excess energy to overcome their initial Coulombic potential due to the decay of surface plasmons to hot carriers (namely (i) exciton generation).41,42 Subsequently, the strong local electromagnetic field around AuNPs can more effectively interact with photo-generated excitons in the NPB/C60 heterojunction interface. This physical phenomenon can be understood as a strong electromagnetic coupling (ii). Bellessa et al.43 and Sugawara et al.44 have verified that the Rabi splitting characteristic of the strong coupling reaches as high as ∼200 meV magnitude at room temperature. We speculated that the resulting plasmon–exciton coupling participated in the charge transfer process, thus accelerating exciton dissociation (iii)45 and resulting in a more efficient charge transfer and shorter exciton lifetimes46 (exciton coupling, exciton dissociation). Therefore, the generation of hot excitons is beneficial for enhancing the probability of dissociation into free carriers. Previous reports have also shown that the plasmonic field around AuNPs can strongly modify the dynamic properties of the photo-generated excitons through the plasmon–exciton coupling.43,44,47 As a result, the enhanced degree of exciton dissociation reduced the recombination level of geminate excitons or single excitons through radiative or nonradiative processes (iv), thereby improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the OPDs.

(b) Schematic diagram of the plasmonic effect of AuNPs under illumination, which gives a cartoon depiction of the interplay between the LSPR and the excitons. The resulting interactions enhance the rate of exciton dissociation, thereby reducing exciton recombination. (c) and (d) are FDTD-simulated electric field distributions of 3 nm-diameter AuNPs under 650 nm and 830 nm excitation light, respectively. The corresponding electric phase is 0 degrees. The magnitude of the enhancement in the electric field intensity is indicated by the colour scale. 
Subsequently, to unveil the LSPR effect of the AuNPs in a more visible way and to further understand the physical mechanism of the surface plasmon resonance enhanced photo-detection, we adopted the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method to simulate the near-field electric field (E-field) intensity distributions of the AuNPs with 3 nm diameter under irradiation with light of wavelengths 650 and 830 nm. The details about the FDTD simulation are described in the ESI (Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 11(c) and (d), clearly, one can see that the 3 nm AuNP can induce ∼109 V m−1 E-field intensity in its own vicinity (0–1.5 nm spacing), which is 100-fold higher than the external E-field (107 V m−1 when the applied voltage is 1 V). This phenomenon was understandable considering the fact that LSPR and SERS effects excited by the AuNPs contributed to plasmon resonance and light absorption. In addition, the E-field distributions were nearly the same with respect to the 650 and 830 nm laser excitation. A comparison for the X-, Y-, Z- and absolute-component, and the different electric phases of the E-field distribution are displayed in the ESI (Fig. S4 and S5†). It can be found that the X-component of the near E-field was much larger than the Y and Z-components, and the different electric phases showed a different plasmonic E-field distribution. On the basis of the theoretical simulation results, the enhancement of photo-responsivity of the plasmonic OPDs could be explained in terms of resonant light absorption in the AuNPs which was accompanied by a strengthened near E-field intensity in the vicinity of the particle because of the LSPR effect. Meanwhile, we also showed here that an excited plasmon in an AuNP was also capable of emitting an electron directly in a preferential direction if the particles were placed inside an oriented electrical field like the one existing in the depletion layer of a Schottky junction.48
Finally, a mechanistic explanation was proposed to support the performance improvements of the above-mentioned OPDs considering the energy level. Fig. 12(a) shows the interfacial properties and the full energy level alignment. It is noteworthy that the energy levels of the NPB/C60 interfacial heterojunction and the electrodes were properly matched. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of NPB is higher in energy than that of C60. Driven by this difference, photogenerated electrons at the interface of C60 and NPB will move to C60 spontaneously. Fortunately, C60 transports electrons well, meanwhile, the work function of Al is lower in energy than the LUMO of C60 and BCP. Consequently, the electrons can reach the Al electrode automatically or under a very low voltage bias. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes tend to move into the NPB and ITO electrode. Thus, the interfacial heterojunction and its electrodes are beneficial for the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers. Importantly, the AuNPs in the NPB/C60 interface would form a stepwise energy level configuration that improves charge carrier transport or recombination in the dark, thereby leading to an enhanced Idark compared with that of the reference device. Under illumination, the excitons from the NPB/C60 heterojunction and the plasmon-enhanced absorption of the AuNPs were generated. In the forward bias (ITO was positively biased, Fig. 12(b)), the electrons and holes were injected from the Al cathode and ITO anode, respectively, achieving recombination in the film interface. On one hand, the photoexcited electrons at the LUMO of C60 moved to the interface, formed an accumulated layer, and then recombined with the holes; on the other hand, the plasmonic hot-carriers also accumulated in the interface, leading to no efficient or sufficient separation of excitons in this case. Therefore, the forward photocurrent had no marked increase upon illumination. While, in the reverse bias (Fig. 12(c)), when the OPD device was operating, photoinduced electrons and holes were generated at the NPB/C60 films and AuNPs, and then transported to the cathode and anode, respectively. The applied external field facilitated the photoexcited carriers’ transfer and extraction at the interface. Also of note is that the plasmonic hot excitons generated by the AuNPs would be dissociated effectively into electrons and holes and extracted promptly by the corresponding electrodes, resulting in the sufficient separation of excitons, and hence leading to a larger photocurrent. The results above proved that the photogenerated charges could be generated, separated and collected efficiently in the structure and bias condition. The methodology presented here can provide a new avenue for the development of AuNPs-based broadband high performance OPDs and other optoelectronic devices.

The AuNPs act as plasmonic photosensitizers. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, size-controllable AuNPs have been prepared and characterized using a vacuum thermal deposition technique. A remarkable red–NIR broad spectral absorption with a performance-enhanced device application has been demonstrated via incorporation of the size-controllable AuNPs at an organic heterojunction interface. UV-vis absorption measurements confirmed the remarkably enhanced and balanced broad absorption between wavelengths of 550 and 900 nm when 3 nm AuNPs were added into the NPB/C60 interface of the OPD. It was also observed that the AuNPs-optimized OPD exhibited apparent sensitivity to red–NIR light, to which the reference device is virtually blind. The enhanced light absorption and detection are the result of both LSPR and SERS effects by the AuNPs. Moreover, interactions between the plasmons and the photogenerated excitons resulted in an enhanced degree of exciton dissociation, thereby reducing the level of exciton loss through recombination. A good qualitative agreement between absorption, XRD, Raman spectra and the OPD device performance was obtained. For comparison, the plasmonic OPD achieved more than one order of magnitude performance improvement with respect to the reference device. A schematic energy level model combined with FDTD simulation of a AuNP was able to explain the experimental data. The experiments and accompanying theoretical calculations pointed out the importance of AuNPs for broad spectral photodetection. However, there is still much room for improvement in the OPD's performance. In particular, by utilizing AuNPs and organic materials with a special broad spectral absorption range, the corresponding performance is expected to achieve further enhancement with a broader detection band. Note that assessing and optimizing carrier collection efficiency of plasmonic nanostructures additionally requires models for the transport of hot carriers, which is a subject for future study.
