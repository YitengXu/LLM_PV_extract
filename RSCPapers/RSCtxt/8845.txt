    , Accepted 13th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractWe report that doping with hydrophobic bulky 2D phenylethylammonium (PEA+) is desirable to stabilize the perovskite matrix and enhance its stability. The addition of PEA+ alters the crystal growth orientation and improves the connectivity of the crystal grains. However, solely adding the PEA+ material cannot fully passivate the severe bulk recombination sites/interior defects due to Sn vacancies, leading to an efficiency of 3.96% (Voc of 0.36 V) for a Ge-free device. In contrast, we find that the addition of smaller-sized Ge ions with an optimum doping concentration effectively reduces the leakage current and suppresses the carrier density of the perovskite material. From the perspective of traps, the addition of Ge reduces the traps, typically deep traps, and its effectiveness (Ge) in trap passivation is further deduced from the thermally stimulated current (TSC) profile. The total trap density was doubly reduced to 4.14 × 1020 cm−3 when 7.5 mol% Ge was added, which led to a photo-conversion efficiency of 7.45% with a high Voc of 0.46 V. In addition, defect healing by the Ge additive significantly enhanced the stability of the unencapsulated device for 192 h. This work shows that Ge is an effective additive to suppress the recombination sites (trap state passivation), leading to the establishment of an efficient tin-based perovskite solar cell.
Introduction
Recently, attention has been steered towards lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by substituting lead with less toxic metals such as tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge).1,2 Sn is one of the most potential B-site candidates for lead-free PSCs owing to its high absorption coefficient, small exciton binding energy, and high charge carrier mobility.3–5 In addition, the Sn perovskites exhibit narrower optical band gaps (1.2–1.4 eV), which are closer to the Shockley–Queisser limit (1.34 eV), making them ideal for photovoltaic and optoelectronic device applications. However, one of the challenges for Sn perovskites is the easy formation of Sn vacancies owing to its small formation energy and the ease of oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which result in severe charge carrier recombination losses.6–11 In addition, the presence of dangling bonds on the Sn perovskite surface and grain boundaries and the formation of defects in polycrystalline perovskite films cause the formation of trap states and non-radiative recombination sites, which are responsible for inducing device degradation.12–14
Strategies have been executed to plunge the undesirable background carrier density such as by adding SnF2 to suppress its unintentional self p-doping process and to fill the vacancies. In 2014, Kumar et al. reported 2% efficiency for a CsSnI3 solar cell upon the addition of 20% SnF2 as a reducing agent.15 Subsequently, a double increment in efficiency up to 4.8% was reported by Seok and co-workers when SnF2–pyrazine was incorporated into FASnI3. They revealed that the addition of SnF2–pyrazine as a mediator enhanced the film morphology of FASnI3, which was due to the slow thin film crystallization rate and the SnF2–pyrazine complex mitigating the phase separation on the perovskite surface.16 Additionally, the beneficial effect of SnF2 on trap suppression was further demonstrated by Ng et al. via thermally stimulated current (TSC) studies. The Sn perovskite without SnF2 possessed a wide TSC signal and a huge total trap density (5.79 × 1022 cm−3), which is one order higher in magnitude than that of the perovskite with SnF2 (1.93 × 1021 cm−3). When an optimum amount of Ge was added to the FA0.75MA0.25Sn1−xGexI3 perovskite, it was reported that the Ge ions could fill the defects and Sn vacancies of the perovskite, consequently contributing to significant reduction in trap density to 108 to 1014 cm−3.17,18 Nevertheless, the stability and moisture resistivity of the Sn-based PSC could still be restrained by the hydrophilic FA+ and MA+ cations, which calls for the development of 2D or quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.
The replacement of the hydrophilic cations with hydrophobic long alkyl chain cations can enhance the solar cell stability.19–22 G. Kanatzidis and co-workers fabricated quasi-2D Sn3I10 (n = 3) and Sn4I13 (n = 4) PSCs, which exhibited PCEs below 3% but with much improved stability than that of the 3D MASnI3 PSC.7,23 With the addition of 20% stoichiometric ratio of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) into the FASnI3 perovskite, the PCE substantially improved to 5.94% and subsequently, it improved to 9% when a relatively lower stoichiometric ratio of PEAI was added to FAI, which resulted in excellent stability.7,24 Ke et al. reported the best Sn perovskite device with a PCE of 7.14% when a 10% ethylenediammonium {en} additive was added to the FASnI3 framework. The encapsulated {en}FASnI3 solar cell retained 96% of its initial PCE after a 1000 h aging process.25 The addition of a trace amount of 2D dopant can passivate the ease of oxidizing the Sn perovskites by moisture, leading to stability enhancement; however, they still suffer from intrinsic and oxidative instability, which can be attributed to the presence of trap states. It is notable that the important criterion for a solar cell with excellent photo-physical properties and photovoltaic performances is always commensurated with good film quality, which is in regard to low defect states.17
In this work, we investigated the effect of Ge on trap passivation and discussed its beneficial impact on the charge carrier dynamics of the perovskite material. We combine the advantages of both PEAI and Ge ions as the prime ingredients in the Sn perovskite framework for moisture ingression and passivation purposes. Knowing that the hydrophobic PEA+ cations can improve the perovskite crystallinity and serve as moisture inhibiting layers, the alteration of the perovskite crystal orientation by these bulky 2D chains to a certain extent may induce undesirable distortions. More importantly, it is impossible for the bulky 2D chains to penetrate into the 3D framework for passivation unless a smaller ion such as Ge is utilized. Effectively, the introduction of Ge significantly reduced the energetic depth of the deepest trap states in the system, which contributed to a low total trap density of 4.14 × 1020 cm−3 as opposed to that of the quasi-2D/3D PSC without Ge (9.68 × 1020 cm−3). More importantly, the inclusion of Ge restrained self p-doping, minified undesirable carrier density, and thus contributed to higher charge mobility. The addition of an optimum amount of Ge (7.5 mol%) resulted in a high PCE of 7.45% with excellent stability.
Results and discussion
Relative to the pristine FSI cell, the role of PEAI was first explicated with the improved Voc and FF values (Fig. 1a and Table 1); the compact hydrophobic PEAI layer contributed to the passivation of the surface defect states. It is speculated that the bulky PEA+ improves the connectivity of crystal grains and partially passivates the defects at the grain boundaries, as shown in Scheme 1.12 Nevertheless, the inclusion of PEA+ cations could slice the 3D perovskite structure and they acted as an insulator to retard the internal charge transportation. In contrast, the inclusion of Ge substantially impacted the photovoltaic performances of the FA0.92PEA0.08SnxGe1−xI3 (FPSxG1−xI) solar cells. The Ge-based devices (excluding FPSGI (10.5Ge)) exhibited higher photocurrent (Jsc) responses, Voc, and PCEs. The best PCE of 7.45% was realized when 7.5 mol% Ge was incorporated; we also observed a high Jsc of 21.92 mA cm−2, high Voc of 0.46 V, and high FF of 0.73 with a negligible hysteresis effect (Fig. 1c). The high Jsc values of the Ge-based solar cells are in great agreement with the absorption spectrum (Fig. S1a†). The excellent photovoltaic performances are also ascribed to the formation of highly crystalline perovskite materials, as explicated from the XRD profile (Fig. S1b†). The orthorhombic (Amm2) crystal structure of FASnI3 exhibited five dominant diffraction peaks at 14.07°, 24.39°, 28.14°, 31.55°, 40.47°, which were indexed to the (100), (120)/(102), (200), (122), and (222) planes, respectively; these were consistent with the results reported in literature. The presence of all five diffraction peaks indicates that FSI is composed of grains with random orientations.3,6,7 After adding PEAI as an additive, low-intensity diffraction peaks (Fig. S1c,† green pattern) were observed at low diffraction angles, indicating the presence of 2D perovskites in the 3D FSI matrix. Interestingly, no additional peak was observed when Ge was added, implying that the addition of Ge caused no disruption in the perovskite structure. In addition, the existence of PEAI was further evidenced through SEM (Fig. S2†), where the FSI film morphology was considerably altered upon the addition of PEAI with no apparent crystalline grain boundaries (Fig. S2b†). The addition of PEAI merged the crystal grains to form a continuous film; however, the pinholes and grain boundaries were still unambiguously observable. Interestingly, these pinholes were filled when we incorporated an optimum amount of Ge ions (Fig. S2c†). The role of Ge was further amplified when FPSGI (7.5 Ge) was used, which had lower dark current density than that of the Ge-free device (Fig. 1d); this implied improved charge transport, suppression of charge recombination, and lower leakage current, which led to higher Voc (corroborating the J–V results).26–29 The slight increment in dark current density after 0.6 V for the FPSGI (7.5 Ge) device is ascribed to a lower charge injection barrier, which leads to higher charge recombination resistance.

 Scheme 1  The passivation effect of Ge within the perovskite lattice. 
Owing to the combined effects of PEA+ and Ge2+, the PCE of FPSGI (7.5 Ge) was elevated to 7.57% after storage for 192 h in a glovebox, as depicted in Fig. 1b and S3a.† This phenomenon is hypothesized to be due to the effectiveness of PEA+ in preventing the ingression of moisture and the passivation of the defect states by Ge. In addition, the contribution of the iodide source from the Ge ions helps in stabilizing the SnI2 proportion. It is expected that the bulky organic molecule (PEAI) can act as a capped layer to encapsulate the perovskite material due to its appreciable van der Waals forces that lead to stability improvement.19 The combined positive effect of PEA+ and Ge2+ was further magnified when an un-encapsulated FPSGI (7.5 Ge) solar cell was exposed to continuous illumination at an ambient environment, where this device retained 70% of its original efficiency after 3 h of illumination (Fig. S3b†). The enhanced stability of the Ge-based device is credited to the passivation effect of Ge and the formation of a thin GeO2 layer that prevents moisture ingress.17 The reproducibility of FPSGI with and without Ge is explicated through a histogram with Gaussian fitting composed of 25 devices, as displayed in Fig. 1e and Table S2.†Fig. 1f shows the IPCE spectrum of the FPSxG1−xI3 perovskite solar cells. A plateau of IPCE (FPSGI (7.5 Ge)) around 400–600 nm (∼70%) implies the high photon-to-electron conversion of the state-of-the-art devices and the integrated Jsc is in great agreement with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V profile).
In contrast, the compromised overall photovoltaic performances of the Ge-free devices such as Jsc and Voc are speculated to be ascribed to the presence of non-desirable trap states (as evidenced through the TSC profile). Evidently, both the devices without Ge exhibited lower shunt resistances, Rsh, (12-fold and 2-fold lower for FSI and FPSGI (0 Ge), respectively) than that of FPSGI (7.5 Ge) (refer to Table S3†) probably owing to the occurrence of minor interfacial charge recombination.26 This phenomenon thus reflected the reason for the low Jsc and Voc of the Ge-free solar cells. We speculate that the reduced Voc (greater Voc loss) can be attributed to the increased trap states across the interfaces and within the perovskite absorber, which consequently affects the photovoltaic and stability performances.
The impact of Ge in trap passivation is revealed through TSC, which is a powerful tool to evaluate the trap densities and depths of a semiconducting material. The depth of the trap states in the system was calculated using eqn (1):30,31 (1)here, kB is the Boltzmann constant, Tm is the TSC peak's temperature, and β is the heating rate. The trap density was calculated viaeqn (2):30,31 (2)here, Q is the area under a TSC graph, q is the electronic charge, A is the active area, and L is the perovskite's thickness.
As shown in Fig. 2a, a wide TSC signal is recorded when 10.5 mol% Ge is added, which is ascribed to the presence of severe trap state distribution (typically deep traps) with a huge total trap density of 5.26 × 1021 cm−3 (Fig. 2b).17,32 We found that the recorded enormous trap densities after the addition of 10.5 mol% Ge could not be attributed to the Sn2+ vacancies, but they could be due to the distorted or destabilized perovskite framework caused by the dense GeO2. As evidenced through the XPS profile (Fig. S4d†), FPSGI (10.5 Ge) exhibits the least Sn4+/Sn2+ ratio but with an intense GeO2 peak (Fig. S4e†). Although the role of Ge in suppressing the oxidation of Sn2+ has been certified, the highly dense GeO2 worsens the charge transportation. It is notable that the large increase in current at a high temperature is not owing to the release of trap carriers, but it could be due to the leakage current or thermally activated atomic vacancies.30,33,34

The carrier concentrations of the perovskite materials were measured via hall measurements. 
As depicted in Fig. 2b, it is clear that trap states and defects (FPSGI (10.5 Ge)) are severely formed at a deeper trap level from −0.6 eV onwards, which significantly impacts the Voc (higher energy loss) of the device owing to energy disorder.35 This phenomenon can be the downside of excessive Ge ions, which can worsen the film formation, as observed through the morphological structure of FPSGI (10.5 Ge), where pinholes (yellow circles) are observed on the perovskite surface. In contrast, when an optimum amount of Ge (7.5 mol%) was incorporated, the shallow trap density substantially decreased from 1015 cm−3 (0 mol% Ge) to 1013 cm−3 due to the passivation effect of Ge ions, as evidenced through the smaller TSC signal in Fig. 2a. The activation energy, Ea, of the trap states can be identified through the initial rise method from the Arrhenius plot from 94 K to 286 K, as depicted in eqn (3):36 ITSC ∝ exp(−Et/kT)(3)here, ITSC is the TSC in the initial rise regime, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
The succession in trap state passivation can be further verified through the reduction in the energetic trap states of the Ge-based device from an Ea of 252 meV (0 mol% Ge) to 214 meV (Fig. S5†).32 It is thus ascertained that Ge can effectively remove the detrimental traps or shift traps closer to the valence or conduction band in the perovskite vicinity but not PEAI.32 In great agreement with the TSC evaluation, the density of states (DOS) distribution shown in Fig. 2c manifests that the Ge-based device has a fewer number of available states for the electrons to occupy.17,37 The beneficial role of Ge was further demonstrated by correlating the carrier concentration and trap density of the perovskite films. As observed in Fig. 2d and Table 2, the FPSGI (7.5 Ge) perovskite exhibits the least trap density and carrier concentration as compared to FPSGI (0 Ge). Thus, we conclude that Ge is a perfect ingredient for defect passivation, background carrier density reduction, and decreasing the formation of Sn vacancies, making it an important additive to suppress recombination and Voc loss.

To rationalize the charge recombination mechanism, we performed impedance spectroscopy under dark with an open circuit condition and the Nyquist plots were fitted by using the equivalent model, as displayed in Fig. 3a. It is notable that lower series resistance, Rs, enhances charge transportation, while larger charge recombination resistance, Rrec, indicates a lower recombination rate.38,39 Expectedly, the Ge-based solar cells except FPSGI (10.5 Ge) and the Ge-free device exhibited larger Rrec (larger semicircle), which was due to the less trap density formation (Fig. 3b and Table 3); this indicates the remarkable suppression of interfacial charge recombination due to defect passivation by Ge.40,41 The success of Ge in trap state passivation and Sn2+ vacancy suppression was also verified when FPSGI (7.5 Ge) exhibited higher Rsh than the devices without the Ge additive, implying that the device possessed a higher resistance to increase carrier density caused by self p-doping. The exceptional case for FPSGI (10.5 Ge) could first be owing to the excessive doping of Ge, which is anticipated to have distorted the perovskite framework. Second, the formation of the dense GeO2 layer (proven through the XPS profile in Fig. S4e†) might have severely hampered the charge transportation. To further analyze the charge recombination mechanism and Voc improvement, we obtained capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. Consistently, the larger flat band potential (Vbi) of the FPSGI (7.5 Ge) device than that of the Ge-free devices (Fig. 3d) implied better charge transport, separation, and collection of carriers.12 Comparatively, the Ge-free devices exhibited the least Vbi value (consistent with the Rrec value), indicating the occurrence of severe charge recombination at the trap states, especially at a deeper trap level (corroborating the TSC profile). In addition, the passivation effect of Ge is further verified through transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) studies. Fig. S6a† manifests that the decay time of the mixed 2D/3D perovskite with Ge under an open-circuit condition (TPV) is longer than that for the perovskite without Ge, indicating less non-radiative recombination sites (consistent with the TSC results). In contrast, the TPC profile (Fig. S6b†) illustrates that the decay time of the perovskites with Ge is quicker, implying that the Ge-based perovskites exhibit better charge carrier extraction capability than the Ge-free perovskite. This phenomenon can be credited to the enhanced perovskite morphology upon Ge addition (pinhole-less) in addition to the alteration of the perovskite electronic structure by Ge ions, which consequently shifts the Ge-perovskite valence bands to match the hole-transporting layer (Fig. S7†).42 The capability of Ge in trap passivation and Sn4+ suppression significantly improved the carrier dynamics of FPSGI (7.5 Ge) with an achievable high mobility of 70.65 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 3c). Relatively, the charge mobility for the FPSGI (0 Ge) perovskite was compromised due to the occurrence of severe recombination processes (low Rrec = 21.2 kΩ).

Conclusion
In summary, we have highlighted the importance and effectiveness of Ge in trap passivation owing to the synergism between PEAI and GeI2 in stabilizing the mixed 2D/3D perovskite lattice. Ge plays an important role in suppressing the defect/trap states, as deduced through TSC evaluations. The addition of an optimum amount of Ge reduces carrier trapping at the surfaces and grain boundaries; this is evidenced by the addition of 7.5 mol% Ge that doubly reduces the trap densities from 9.68 × 1020 cm−3 (FPSGI (0 Ge)) to 4.14 × 1020 cm−3, which is in great agreement with the DOS distribution. It was also assured that Ge addition could suppress the Sn2+ oxidation process, as proven through XPS, which is an important finding for high photovoltaic performances. The effectiveness of Ge in passivating traps and suppressing Sn2+ vacancies was also explicated through the reduction of carrier densities upon the addition of Ge, which led to a high mobility of 70.65 cm2 V−1 s−1. Effectively, the FPSGI (7.5 Ge) solar cell recorded a high efficiency of 7.45%, high Jsc of 21.92 mA cm−2, and high Voc of 0.46 V with excellent stability at ambient conditions.
Experimental
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
The FTO glass was first cleaned through ultrasonic bath using a lab detergent (SCAT 20-X, Japan), distilled water, acetone, isopropanol, and distilled water for 10 min, respectively. Subsequently, the glasses were dried and subjected to plasma treatment (electronic Diener, Plasma-surface-technology, Germany) for 5 min prior to the spin-coating process. PEDOT:PSS used as a hole transport material was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s, followed by heating treatment at 140 °C for 20 min to completely evaporate the water. The coated samples were then transferred and kept inside the N2 gas circulated glovebox, and the subsequent coating processes were done inside the glovebox. Then, 0.92 M FAI, 0.08 M PEAI, (1 − x M) SnI2, x M GeI2, and 0.1 M SnF2 were stirred in DMF::DMSO in a 4:1 ratio. Next, 50 μL of the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate at 5000 for 50 s; 500 μL chlorobenzene was casted at 13–15 s and the film was completed by annealing at 70 °C for 10 min. Next, 25 nm C60, 6 nm BCP, 70 nm Ag, and 30 nm Au were sequentially deposited by the thermal evaporation process.
