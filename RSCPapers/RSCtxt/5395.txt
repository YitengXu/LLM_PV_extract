    , Accepted 15th May 2018First published on 16th May 2018AbstractIn this study, we introduced alcohol based vapor annealing of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer for fabricating high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells. Atomic force microscopy measurements and atomistic theoretical simulations indicated that phase separation between PEDOT and PSS was enhanced by this annealing, improving the hole conductivity at the PEDOT:PSS layer. As a result of using methanol, the short-circuit current density improved from 20.7 to 21.6 mA cm−2; consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) improved from 16.1 to 17.3%. However, using ethanol or isopropanol yielded a smaller performance improvement. The PCEs of the best sample in this study under forward and reverse scans were 17.7 and 18.0%, respectively, indicating that the PSC had a small hysteresis. Our results suggest that alcohol vapor annealing is a simple and effective method of developing high-performance inverted perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
Since they were first reported by Kojima and co-workers in 2009,1 organic–inorganic methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, or I)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been rapidly developed because of their high performance, low cost, light weight, and simple fabrication process.2–4 Recently, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.7% was reported for PSCs, indicating their great potential for commercialization.5
Conventional PSCs are usually fabricated on metal–oxide-based substrates using TiO2 as the electron transport material.2–4 However, a high sintering temperature of about 500 °C is required for processing TiO2 layers in PSCs, which would increase the cost of large-scale production.2–4,6–8 In addition, the brittleness of TiO2 makes it unsuitable for future roll-to-roll production.6–8 Thus, it is desirable to find new materials and design new architectures to overcome these challenges.6–8 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising material for fabricating polymer-based organic solar cells (OSCs) and PSCs, because it can be utilized both as a hole transport layer and highly conductive electrode depending on its composition.9–12 Recently, inverted-structure PSCs have been actively investigated owing to the low processing temperature (about 140 °C) and easy fabrication procedure, which usually utilizes organic PEDOT:PSS and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the hole and electron transport materials, respectively.11–15
In addition to finding new materials, morphology control of each layer is also very important for device performance.14–18 For example, a perovskite layer with good morphology is beneficial for light harvesting and charge generation,16,17 and the morphologies of the electron and hole transport layers are decisive for charge dissociation, transportation, and collection.14,15,18 Thermal annealing (TA) is a conventional method of controlling the morphology of thin layers.16,17 Solvent annealing (SA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) are other widely used and effective ways to control the morphology of organic layers.16 For PCBM (the electron transport layer), TA and SVA were performed to improve the morphologies of PCBM films, and the resulting PSCs showed high PCEs of 16.3–19.4%.19,20 A high boiling point material, 1,8-diiodoctane, was used as the solvent additive to control the morphology of PCBM, resulting in a PCE improvement of 15% (from 11.0 to 12.7%).21 Then poly(methylmethacrylate) mixed into PCBM layers was found to decrease the aggregation of PCBM; consequently, the PCE improved from 18.0 to 18.7%.22 These results indicate that controlling the morphology of the charge transport layers is very effective for improving the performance of PSCs.
On the other hand, compared with that of PCBM, the morphology effect of PEDOT:PSS (the hole transport material) on the performance of PSCs has been investigated very little. Because the conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS is generally low, enhancing its conductivity becomes an important issue for device fabrication.21–26 To date, several organic solvents (methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, and dimethyl sulfoxide) and co-solvents (ethylene and methanol) have been added into PEDOT:PSS solution to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films for fabricating OSCs and PSCs.27–30 Chen and co-workers used some organic solvents to rinse the PEDOT:PSS layer and enhance its conductivity; as a result, the PCE was improved by 4.7–8.0%.22 By adding imidazole to PEDOT:PSS solutions, Wang et al. tuned the pH value and modified the morphology, improving the PCE from 12.7 to 15.7%.23 Huang et al. controlled the morphology of PEDOT:PSS by using polyethylene oxide as an additive; the PCE was improved from 11.4 to 16.5% owing to the enhanced conductivity.24 However, using the SVA method to control the morphology of PEDOT:PSS has not been investigated yet; therefore, it is very important to examine the effect of SVA of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the performance of PSCs.
In this work, we developed alcohol vapor annealing of the PEDOT:PSS layer for fabricating high-performance inverted PSCs. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicated that phase separation between PEDOT and PSS was enhanced by the alcohol treatment, which might result in more efficient hole extraction. Atomistic theoretical simulations of this system also supported this alcohol-enhanced phase separation. Methanol-based SVA improved the PCE from 16.1 to 17.3% and enhanced the short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 20.7 to 21.6 mA cm−2. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) were also slightly improved. Ethanol- or isopropanol-based SVA yielded a smaller performance improvement (5.0–1.9%). The best PSC in this study was obtained using methanol and exhibited PCEs of 17.7–18.0% without significant hysteresis. Our findings indicate that using alcohol vapor annealing to control the morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layer is a simple and effective way to develop high-performance PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and PCBM were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (China) and Nano-C (USA), respectively. Lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc2·3H2O), bathocuproine (BCP), and all the solvents [including N,N-dimethylmethanamide (DMF), chlorobenzene (CB), methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses were purchased from Ying Kou You Xuan Trade Co., Ltd (China).
2.2. Fabrication of PSCs
PSCs were fabricated on pre-rinsed ITO glass substrates with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)/PCBM/BCP/Ag. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbAc2·3H2O and MAI (1:3 in molar ratio) in DMF with a concentration of 40 wt%. First, PEDOT:PSS [Clevios P VP AI 4083; molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1(a)] layers of about 40 nm were spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min in air. During the alcohol vapor annealing process, 100 μL of methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol was added to a Petri dish cover (with a diameter of 14 cm and a height of 2 cm) to form a alcohol atmosphere for SVA, as shown in Fig. 1(b). To fabricate reference devices, this operation was skipped. Then perovskite layers were formed by spin-coating the perovskite precursor solution onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 90 °C for 10 min. Next, a PCBM solution (20 mg mL−1 in CB) was subsequently spin-coated onto the perovskite layers at 1000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, BCP (3.5 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were thermally evaporated onto the PCBM layers to complete device fabrication. The effective working area of the PSCs was 0.1 cm−2, which was defined by a shadow mask.

2.3. Characterization
The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layers was measured using a four-point probe system with a current source-meter (Keithley 2400, USA). The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was measured using a surface profilometer (Dektak 150, Veeco, USA). The transmittance and absorbance spectra were obtained using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Lambda 750, USA). Topographic images of the layers were acquired using an AFM (Veeco, USA) in tapping mode. Cross-sectional and top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using an SU8020 instrument (Hitachi, Japan) operated at an acceleration voltage of 8 kV. The photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained using a spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, UK). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (AM1.5). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix, China).
2.4. Simulation
The effects of alcohol vapor annealing were theoretically investigated using dissipative particle dynamics implemented in the Mesocite module of the Materials Studio (MS) 8.0 software.31 A cubic supercell with lateral dimensions of 100 Å × 100 Å × 100 Å was employed in the simulations and contained 9260 PEDOT:PSS monomers and 1389 alcohol molecules. The average densities of PEDOT and PSS were set to 1.34 and 1.16 g cm−3, respectively. Newton's equation of motion was integrated using the Verlet algorithm with a time step of 1 fs. The ratio of the simulated PEDOT and PSS monomer beads was set to 1:3, which is similar to the results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement and previous work.22 The simulated temperature and pressure were set at 413.15 K (140 °C) and 101.325 kPa (1 atm), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Table 1, the conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS layers after alcohol vapor annealing with methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol were 0.08, 0.03, and 0.009 S cm−1, respectively, whereas the pristine PEDOT:PSS without alcohol treatment showed a low conductivity of only 0.004 S cm−1, which was similar to the values obtained in previous studies.22,23 The results indicate that methanol-based SVA could greatly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS (by 20 times).

To find the reason for the conductivity improvement, we conducted AFM measurements of the surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layers, as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). In Fig. 2(a), the pristine PEDOT:PSS surface shows a uniform morphology without significant phase separation, indicating that PEDOT and PSS are well mixed with each other, as in previous studies.22,23,33Fig. 2(b) shows that, after methanol-based SVA, the size of the domains increased significantly from 7 to 20 nm (average). Generally, the bright regions indicate the relatively hard PEDOT phase, and the dark regions correspond to the soft PSS phase.23,24,34 The root mean square roughness increased from 0.8 to 1.4 nm, indicating a rougher surface, which is induced by phase separation of PEDOT and PSS.33 The SEM images in Fig. S1 (ESI†) show that after methanol treatment, the surface of PEDOT:PSS became more distinct, with clearer boundaries between the bright and dark regions, possibly owing to the phase separation of PEDOT and PSS. In fact, PEDOT is a conducting material, and PSS is an insulating one.22,23,33 Thus, the enhanced conductivity is consistent with the aggregation of conductive PEDOT.22,23,33

We also performed XPS measurements of pristine PEDOT:PSS and methanol-treated PEDOT:PSS. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), peaks at 167.5 and 163.5° corresponding to PSS and PEDOT, respectively,33,34 were observed for the samples with and without methanol annealing. This indicated that the chemical bonding behavior of PSS and PEDOT molecules was not affected by annealing. On the other hand, the ratio of PEDOT to PSS was changed by the methanol treatment. Following previous studies, we used the integrations of the peaks at 166–170° and 163–166° to determine the amounts of PSS and PEDOT in the films, respectively.32–34 The calculated ratio (PEDOT to PSS) was increased slightly (from 27.8 to 29.4%) by methanol vapor annealing. Considering that XPS can usually measure the region within 5 nm below the surface,35 phase separation may have changed the local PEDOT and PSS composition in the XPS-measurable region, whereas the total composition might be changed. Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) shows that methanol-based SVA did not significantly change the light transmission of the PEDOT:PSS layers. Fig. S3(b) (ESI†) indicates no clear crystalline structures in pristine PEDOT:PSS or PEDOT:PSS after methanol-based SVA, similar to previous studies.22,23,33 Compared with the use of methanol, using ethanol resulted in weaker phase separation [Fig. 2(c)], and using isopropanol produced almost the same morphology as in the pristine sample [Fig. 2(d)].
We also theoretically optimized the atomic structures of PEDOT:PSS without and with alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The partial pair correlation functions g(r) for PEDOT–PEDOT, PSS–PSS, and PEDOT–PSS molecule pairs were calculated (Fig. 3). Because g(r) is the probability density of finding one member of the pair at a distance r from the other member at the origin, relative to that for the uniformly distributed case, it is useful to measure the interactions of homogenous or heterogeneous molecule pairs.36 For PEDOT:PSS without any alcohol molecules, the first peak value of g(r) for PEDOT–PSS pairs is 2.9, which is greater than those for PEDOT–PEDOT and PSS–PSS pairs (2.2 and 2.5, respectively). Thus, the correlations between heterogeneous PEDOT–PSS pairs are stronger than those between homogeneous pairs, indicating that PEDOT and PSS molecules are mixed well in this system.36 When methanol molecules are added to the cell, the interactions between the homogenous molecules are enhanced, whereas those between the heterogeneous molecules decrease; as shown in Fig. 3(a), the first peak values for PEDOT–PEDOT and PSS–PSS pairs (3.3 and 3.8, respectively) become greater than that for PEDOT–PSS (2.4). This indicates enhanced interactions between the homogeneous molecules, which result in stronger phase separation between heterogeneous PEDOT and PSS molecules. In the simulations using ethanol or isopropanol molecules, the first peak for PEDOT–PSS pairs increases, indicating that the degrees of phase separation become weaker as the type of alcohol is changed; among the alcohols considered here, isopropanol gives the highest peak (2.8), which is still lower than that (2.9) for the case without any alcohol, whereas the lowest peak is obtained with methanol. This indicates that the degree of phase separation increases as the alcohol is changed in the order isopropanol, ethanol, and methanol, in good agreement with the AFM measurements shown in Fig. 2. The diagram in Fig. 4 schematically illustrates the phase separation process in alcohol vapor annealing. Previous studies suggested that molecules with a high dielectric constant exhibited a screening effect for separating PEDOT and PSS.33,37 This suggestion is quite reasonable, because polar alcohol molecules can screen and reduce the attractive Coulomb interactions between the positively charged thiophene ring in PEDOT and the negatively charged SO3− in PSS. Actually, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS shows a good linear dependence on the dielectric constant, as illustrated in Table 1; thus, electrostatic screening by alcohol molecules can be regarded as one of the important reasons for the enhanced phase separation. In addition, the hydrophilic alcohols are more soluble to PSS; thus, PSS could be removed from PEDOT molecules during the SVA process, forming phase-separated PEDOT:PSS films.33,37

On the basis of the discussion above, we fabricated PSCs with the schematic device structure shown in Fig. 5(a) on pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS treated by SVA using three alcohols. From the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 5(b), the PSC has a dense layered structure. The thicknesses of the perovskite and PCBM layers are estimated to be 400 and 80 nm, respectively. The UV–vis absorption spectrum in Fig. 5(c) suggests that the perovskite film exhibits strong absorption for wavelengths in the visible range (400 to 700 nm). The excellent absorption of the perovskite film would further ensure superior performance by our PSCs.16,38 The AFM image in Fig. 5(d) shows that the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS has a grain size of approximately 100–300 nm. The non-pinhole perovskite film with full surface coverage is similar to that in the previous studies of high-quality perovskites, which is beneficial for device performance.16,22,38

The device parameters are summarized in Table 2, and the averages and standard deviations are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The J–V characteristics in Fig. 6(a) show that the PSC using pristine PEDOT:PSS has a PCE of 16.1%, which is similar to or higher than those in previous studies based on similar structures,14–17,26,33 demonstrating our well-optimized fabrication process. When methanol was used for SVA, the PCE improved dramatically to 17.3%, with an improved Jsc of 21.6 mA cm−2. Furthermore, Voc and FF also improved to 1.03 V and 77.6%, respectively. SVA using ethanol and isopropanol yielded smaller improvements in the PCE, resulting in values of 16.8 and 16.4%, respectively. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the best sample in the methanol-based SVA group had a high PCE of 17.7%, with a high Jsc of 21.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.04 V, and a FF of 77.7%. Fig. 6(b) shows the steady-state current density and PCE as a function of time for the best cell in the methanol-based SVA group, which was measured at a forward bias of 0.82 V. The current density remains within 21.2–21.6 mA cm−2 for 200 s, yielding a PCE of 17.2–17.5%, which means that the power output of the PSC is stable, as indicated in previous studies.13,22,39Fig. 6(c) shows the IPCE spectra of the PSCs using pristine PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS treated by methanol-based SVA. The integrated Jsc values from the IPCE are 20.5 and 21.3 mA cm−2, respectively, for these two cases. The difference between the calculated and measured Jsc values is less than 1.5% (1–1.4%), indicating the high accuracy of our J–V measurements. Fig. 6(d) shows the J–V characteristics of the best PSC under forward and reverse scans. Under the reverse scan, the PSC showed a slightly higher PCE of 18.0%, which was caused by the slightly higher Voc (1.05 V) and FF (78.1%). The difference between the performance under forward and reverse scans is only 1.7% (17.7–18.0%), indicating the small hysteresis of the PSC.

To better understand the reason for the improved device performance, we obtained the PL and TRPL spectra of the perovskite on PEDOT:PSS layers, as shown in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7(a), the PL signal was significantly quenched by using PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA. However, the signal from the perovskite on SVA-treated PEDOT:PSS is about 28% lower than that of the perovskite on pristine PEDOT:PSS, indicating improved quenching ability of the PEDOT:PSS after methanol-based SVA.15 On the other hand, from the bi-exponential fits to the TRPL spectra in Fig. 7(b), the PL lifetime of devices based on bare PEDOT:PSS (without methanol-based SVA) was 75 ns, which is similar to those in previous studies based on similar structures.13,15,22 By using PEDOT:PSS treated by methanol-based SVA, the PL lifetime was reduced to 49 ns. Faster PL quenching means more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to PEDOT:PSS.13,15,22 These PL and TRPL measurement results confirm the improved hole collection characteristics of the PEDOT:PSS layer treated by methanol-based SVA compared with those of the pristine PEDOT:PSS. Thus, methanol-based SVA can induce phase separation of PEDOT and PSS, which further enhances the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. The PEDOT:PSS layer with improved conductivity is more efficient for hole collection and thus exhibits an improved Jsc, which is the main factor for the ultimate improvement in the PCE.13
 Fig. 7  (a) PL and (b) TRPL spectra of the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA treatment. 
Finally, to determine why Voc and FF improved, we analyzed the dark current densities of PSCs using PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA. Fig. 8 shows the dark J–V characteristics of PSCs using PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA. The other device parameters could be obtained from the fitting results. In the equivalent circuit model, the J–V characteristics are modeled by the following equation:21,40–43 (1)where J is the current density, V is the applied voltage, J0 is the reverse saturation current density, n is the ideality factor, q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is the working area of the solar cell, and Jph is the voltage-dependent photogenerated current density. The fitting results showed that J0 decreased from 2.3 × 10−6 to 1.2 × 10−6 mA cm−2, and n also decreased from 2.38 to 2.35 when methanol-based SVA was used. Because J0 and n reflect the leakage current of carrier recombination and charge recombination in the space-charge region,21,40–43 the decreases in J0 and n indicate suppressed charge recombination due to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS, which is in good agreement with the PL analysis. Additionally, the suppression of charge recombination suggests an enhanced FF.21,40–43 Assuming that Jph is equal to Jsc, eqn (1) is simplified to the following Shockley equation under open-circuit conditions, where Voc ≪ JscARsh:21,40–43 (2)
 Fig. 8  Dark current density characteristics of PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA treatment. 
Thus, the improvement in Jsc and decreases in J0 and n are the reasons for the improvement in Voc. According to eqn (2), the calculated ratio of Voc for PSCs using PEDOT:PSS without and with methanol-based SVA is 0.97, and the ratio of the measured values is (1.01 V)/(1.03 V) = 0.98, indicating that our analysis is highly accurate.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we used alcohol vapor annealing of the PEDOT:PSS layer to improve the performance of inverted PSCs. AFM images showed that the phase separation of PEDOT and PSS was enhanced after treatment with various alcohols, increasing the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layers. The PL, TRPL, and dark current analyses indicated that improved charge transport and suppressed charge recombination were obtained by using methanol-based SVA. Theoretical simulations of PEDOT and PSS in the alcohol atmospheres showed phase separation behaviors similar to those observed experimentally by analyzing the partial pair correlation functions. Using methanol for SVA significantly improved the PCE (from 16.1 to 17.3%). The improvement came mainly from the enhanced Jsc (from 20.7 to 21.6 mA cm−2), which resulted from the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS; Voc and the FF were also both improved. Furthermore, using ethanol or isopropanol yielded a smaller performance improvement (5.0–1.9%) owing to the weaker phase separation of PEDOT:PSS. The best PSC in this study showed high PCEs of 17.7–18.0% with a stable power output and small hysteresis. Our results suggest that using alcohol vapor annealing to control the morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layer is a simple and effective way to develop high-performance PSCs.
