    , Accepted 11th February 2022First published on 11th February 2022AbstractTransition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been widely explored as electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). Nevertheless, the application of TMSs alone is limited due to their lattice expansion and dissolution in an alkaline electrolyte. To overcome these challenges, in this study, hierarchical core–shell hollow Co3S4@NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays have been constructed on reduced graphene oxide/nickel foam (rGO/NF) through a metal–organic framework (MOF)-engaged strategy. The MOF-derived two-dimensional (2D) hollow Co3S4 nanosheets can offer rich electroactive sites and rapid charge transport paths. The 2D NiCo2O4 nanosheets with high electrochemical activity and a stable lattice can overcome the intrinsic defects of Co3S4 by coating on its surface. Besides, the binder-free configuration ensures good electronic conductivity and mechanical stability. Thus, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF exhibits a significantly improved specific capacitance (6.34 F cm−2 at 2 A cm−2), rate capability (57.9% at 50 mA cm−2) and cycling durability (70.9%, after 5000 cycles), compared with Co3S4/rGO/NF. Moreover, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF and an activated carbon (AC) electrode have been constructed into an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), which exhibits an excellent energy density (35.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 799.3 W kg−1) and an outstanding cycling stability (85.7% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles) and a high coulombic efficiency (95%). Two solid-state ASCs can power four green light emitting diode (LED) bulbs for 4 min, demonstrating the great potential of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF electrode in practical applications.
1. Introduction
The rapid depletion of fossil fuels accompanied by climate change due to the emission of CO2 has urged the utilization of sustainable energy. However, renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, wind and biomass are intermittent. Therefore, it is urgent to develop efficient and reliable energy storage devices to address the issues of energy crisis and carbon neutrality.1,2 Supercapacitors (SCs), as a kind of efficient and sustainable green energy storage equipment, have been attracting great attention due to their high power density, long cycling life and low maintenance cost.3 However, the relatively low energy density of SCs is inadequate for modern commercial electrical equipment. The energy density (E) of SCs can be enhanced by improving the working voltage (V) and specific capacitance (C), according to the formula E = 1/2CV2. The working voltage can be extended by integrating the opposite potential windows of the electric double layer capacitor (EDLC)-like anode and faradaic battery-type cathode through assembling an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), and the specific capacitance is determined by electrode materials.4,5
Compared with EDLC-like carbon-based materials and pseudocapacitive materials (e.g., MnO26–8 and conductive polymers9), battery-type materials are capable of delivering much higher capacity by taking advantage of the deep surface faradaic reactions.10 Recently, battery-type transition metal sulfides (TMSs) such as Co9S8, Co3S4, NiS and NiCo2S4 have been widely studied and used as cathode materials for ASC devices due to their high specific capacitance.11–13 Various TMS nanostructures have been constructed via a template strategy in order to provide large accessible electroactive sites and rich ion diffusion channels. In particular, TMSs derived through a sacrificial template method by using a metal–organic framework (MOF) as the precursor can not only control the material morphology better than other methods, but also have high porosity, large specific surface area and a hollow structure.12,14 In this regard, MOF-derived TMSs have been widely explored as electrode materials for SCs. For example, Jiang et al. first reported a hollow CoS nanocage by simple sulfidation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) template in the presence of thioacetamide (TAA). The as-prepared CoS delivered a high specific capacitance (1475 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Zhao et al. prepared a series of mixed metal TMS nanocages (Ni–Zn–Co–S) by sequential etching, ion exchange and sulfidation utilizing a Zn–Co–ZIF as the template/precursor.15 The optimal Ni–Zn–Co–S-0.25 electrode exhibited an ultra-high specific capacitance (1930.9 at 1 A g−1) and a good rate capability (64.5% at 10 A g−1). Compared to powdery electrode materials, the self-supported electrode does not require the use of non-conductive binders, which helps to avoid the extra resistance generated when electrons are transferred between the active component and the conductive substrate.16 Thus, growing MOF-derived TMS nanostructures on conductive substrates is of particular interest for SCs.17,18 Han et al. directly deposited ZIF-L nanoarrays on nickel foam (NF), and porous Co9S8 nanosheet arrays were obtained after solution sulfidation.19 The prepared binder-free electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 1098.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Zheng et al. reported a Ni–Co–S nanosheet array derived from a Ni–Co MOF, and Ni–Co–S displayed an ultra-high specific capacitance (3724 F g−1).20 Despite these achievements, the TMSs alone cannot meet the requirements of practical applications. An important reason is the lattice expansion and structure collapse of TMSs during the long-term charging/discharging processes, which results in capacitance decay.21 To tackle these challenges, the most typical strategy is to construct a core–shell nanoarray to avoid direct contact between the TMSs and electrolyte.21,22 Moreover, the core–shell structure can make full use of the merit of each component.
NiCo2O4, as a bimetallic oxide, has been widely used in the field of electric energy storage due to its high energy storage performance.23 Compared with single metal oxides, NiCo2O4 shows more complex faradaic redox reactions (Co2+/Co3+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couples).24 In addition, bimetallic oxides have more lattice sites in the crystal structure, so that the material has better stability.25 Herein, hierarchical core–shell hollow Co3S4@NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays are constructed, and used as binder-free electrodes for SCs. The construction process of the electrode consists of three steps (Scheme 1). Firstly, the NF was modified by rGO to prevent the oxidation of the NF and improve the electronic conductivity.26,27 rGO has rich oxygen-containing groups, which not only increase the hydrophilicity, facilitating the growth of the MOF but also provide additional redox reactions to improve the electrochemical performance.28 Secondly, ZIF-L was grown in situ on rGO/NF under ambient conditions, and 2D hollow Co3S4 nanoarrays were obtained by the hydrothermal sulfurization of ZIF-L. Finally, NiCo2O4 nanosheets were constructed on the surface of Co3S4 to form a hierarchical core–shell structure. The advantages of this 2D@2D hierarchical hollow Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF electrode are elaborated as follows: (i) Co3S4@NiCo2O4 was directly constructed on the rGO/NF, which avoided the use of additives, eliminating “dead volume” and ensuring fast electron transfer. (ii) 2D Co3S4 derived from the MOF showed an obvious hollow structure with high specific surface area, which was conducive to the infiltration of the electrolyte inside electroactive sites. (iii) Co3S4 was coated with the NiCo2O4 shell, avoiding its dissolution in the electrolyte. Moreover, the hierarchical core–shell structure provided large accessible surface areas, and NiCo2O4 also had high specific capacitance and stability, and thus all these factors contributed to boosting the electrochemical performance.24,25 As expected, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF exhibited a largely improved specific capacitance (6.34 F cm−2/1681 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2), rate performance (57.9% at 50 mA cm−2) and cycling durability (70.9%, after 5000 cycles), compared with Co3S4/rGO/NF (1.55 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, 36.3% at 50 mA cm−2, and 43.8%, after 5000 cycles). Meanwhile, the constructed Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC ASC exhibited a high energy density of 35.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 799.3 W kg−1. Importantly, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC cell demonstrated extremely high stability, showing 85.7% capacitance retention after 10000 charging/discharging cycles in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. These results imply that the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF is a potential electrode for electrochemical energy storage devices.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (98.5%, AR), 2-methylimidazole (Hmim, 99%, AR), thioacetamide (TAA, 99%, AR), methanol (99.9%, AR) and ethanol (99.9%, AR) were supplied by Aladdin Co., Ltd. Graphene oxide (GO) powder and activated carbon (AC) were purchased from Chengdu TIMESNANO.
2.2 Synthesis of rGO/NF
All reagents are of analytical grade and are used as received without further purification. 0.01 g of GO powder was dispersed in 40 mL of deionized water (DIW) under sonication for 2 h. Then, 0.57 mmol of ascorbic acid was added to the mixture under stirring for 30 min. After that, a piece of clean NF (3 × 4 cm2) was soaked into the mixture, and the mixture was heated to 85 °C for 6 h. Finally, the rGO/NF was taken out, washed with DIW and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.3 Preparation of hollow Co3S4/rGO/NF
Typically, 2 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 16 mmol 2-MIM were dissolved in 80 mL of DIW, and the mixture was stirred for 2 min. The rGO/NF was then immersed in the mixed solution, and the synthesis solution was incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After the synthesis, the ZIF-L/rGO/NF was taken out, washed with DIW and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C overnight. 20 mmol TAA was dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol, and the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, the ZIF-L/rGO/NF was added, and the autoclave was heated in a 120 °C oven for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the Co3S4/rGO/NF was taken out, cleaned and dried. The mass loading of the Co3S4 on rGO/NF was around 1.2 mg cm−2.
2.4 Fabrication of hierarchical hollow Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF
2 mmol NiCl2·6H2O, 4 mmol CoCl2·6H2O and 0.5 mmol hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) were dissolved in 40 mL of methanol. Then, the mixture together with Co3S4/rGO/NF was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave, and the autoclave was heated at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF was taken out and placed in a beaker containing 30 mL of ethanol under sonication for 30 s to remove redundant particles. Finally, the product was cleaned and dried at 100 °C for 2 h. The mass loading of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 on rGO/NF was about 3.77 mg cm−2.
2.5 Characterization
The morphology of the product at each synthesis stage was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800). The microstructure and composition of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 were investigated by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Talos F200x) equipped with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The crystalline structure of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF was analyzed by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 Advance). The compositions and chemical states of Co3S4/rGO/NF and Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF were determined by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi).
2.6 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared integrated electrodes were evaluated in a three-electrode system, where the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (1 × 0.5 cm2), platinum foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (cathode) and an AC electrode (anode) were also assembled into a two-electrode cell. Electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, Shanghai Chenhua) using a 2 M KOH electrolyte. The details of electrochemical calculations are provided in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
The crystalline structure of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 scratched from the rGO/NF substrate was confirmed from the XRD pattern, as shown in Fig. 1a. It can be seen that the sample is composed of Co3S4 and NiCo2O4 phases. The diffraction peaks at 31.2, 32.9, 37.9, 49.8, 55.2 and 57.3° are ascribed to cubic Co3S4 (JCPDS: 47-1738), while the peaks located at 31.2, 37.9, 38.3, 44.4 and 55.2° are corresponding to cubic NiCo2O4 (JCPDS: 20-0781).29,30

In addition, an additional peak at 21.8° is attributed to S (JCPDS: 65-1101) originating from the TAA thermal conversion, and the residual Ni (JCPDS: 24-1251) peak at 44.4° overlaps with the characteristic peak of NiCo2O4. The XRD results indicate that the ZIF-L template has fully converted into Co3S4, and the Co3S4 is coated with NiCo2O4, while no other phases are formed during this process. The compositions and chemical states of Co3S4/rGO/NF and Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF were analyzed by XPS. The XPS survey spectra of Co3S4/rGO/NF and Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF are shown in Fig. 1b. It can be seen that Co, Ni, O and S are prominent in Co3S4/rGO/NF, while the absence of the S element signal in Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF is due to the limited detection depth of XPS, since the Co3S4 is covered by the NiCo2O4 shell. Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectra in the Co 2p, Ni 2p, S 2p and O 1s regions were collected. The Co 2p spectra of Co3S4/rGO/NF and Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (Fig. 1c) show Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin–orbit doublets along with the shake-up satellites of Co3+ and Co2+.31,32 The binding energies at 778 and 796.6 eV are corresponding to Co3+ and the Co2+ peaks of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF are located at 781 and 798.2 eV. The Ni 2p spectrum of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF is shown in Fig. 1d, which also shows two spin–orbit doublets and satellites. The peaks of Ni 2p3/2 are located at 854.9 (Ni2+) and 857.1 eV (Ni3+), while the peaks at 872.5 (Ni2+) and 875 eV (Ni3+) belong to Ni 2p1/2.29Fig. 1e shows the S 2p spectra of Co3S4/rGO/NF and Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF. In agreement with the survey spectrum, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF shows no S 2p signal due to the limited detection depth of XPS and the core–shell structure. The S 2p spectrum of Co3S4/rGO/NF was split into four peaks. The S 2p3/2 peak at 161.9 eV is attributed to the metal–sulfur bonds, while the S 2p1/2 peak (163 eV) is indexed to sulfur with low-coordination.26 The C–S bond (164.4 eV) suggests that there is coupling between Co3S4 and rGO, and the binding energy at 168.9 eV originates from the oxidation of the sulfur species.31,33 The O 1s spectrum of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF in Fig. 1f shows four signal peaks at 529.7, 530.4, 531.8 and 533.2 eV representing the metal–O binding (Ni–O and Co–O), intra-crystalline hydroxide groups, oxygen defects and adsorbed water, respectively.32 The oxygen defects not only can act as the active sites, but also can act as the ion transport channels, thus increasing the conductivity of the electrode.34

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of the samples at different synthesis stages. For comparison, the SEM images of bare NF, rGO/NF and NiCo2O4/rGO/NF are supplemented in Fig. S1.† As shown in Fig. 2a and d, the rGO/NF substrate is evenly covered by aligned ZIF-L nanosheets, and the nanosheets show a smooth surface and sharp edges. After sulfidation, the nanoarray structure of the ZIF-L template is largely retained (Fig. 2b and e). The surfaces of the Co3S4 nanosheets become coarse. Moreover, the broken tips of the Co3S4 nanosheets suggest that Co3S4 has a hollow structure, which facilitates electrolyte penetration and alleviates the volume change during the electrochemical process. The formation of the Co3S4 hollow structure can be attributed to the Kirkendall effect.35 After hydrothermal synthesis, it can be seen from Fig. 2c and f that Co3S4 is densely covered by interconnected NiCo2O4 nanosheets, forming a robust hierarchical core–shell structure. The outer layer of NiCo2O4 can protect Co3S4 from corrosion by the electrolyte, thus improving the stability of the electrode. Notably, Co3S4@NiCo2O4 is still orderly aligned on rGO/NF, and there is enough room between the neighboring nanosheets.

The microstructure and composition of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 were further analyzed by TEM characterization, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a confirms the core–shell structure of Co3S4@NiCo2O4, where Co3S4 is tightly wrapped by many randomly oriented NiCo2O4 nanosheets. The average thickness of a NiCo2O4 nanosheet is estimated to be around 10 nm (Fig. 3b). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 3c shows clear lattice fringes of Co3S4 and NiCo2O4. The interplanar spacing of 0.247 and 0.461 nm can be assigned to the (311) and (111) crystal planes of NiCo2O4, while Co3S4 shows the (311) facet with a spacing of 0.281 nm. It is worth noting that the form of Co3S4/NiCo2O4 heterointerfaces (marked by a white line) originating from the strong interfacial effect and lattice mismatch is verified by the discontinuous crystal fringes. The heterointerfaces are conducive to the charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 3d, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 shows multiple diffraction rings, indicating that Co3S4@NiCo2O4 is a polycrystalline material. As shown in the elemental mapping (Fig. 3e) by EDS, it is found that Co, Ni, S and O elements are evenly distributed in Co3S4@NiCo2O4. Notably, the signal of the S element is obviously weaker compared with other elements, which is caused by the shielding by the NiCo2O4 shell.

The as-prepared integrated electrodes were directly used as binder-free electrodes in three-electrode systems. Fig. 4a shows the comparative CV curves of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF and Co3S4/rGO/NF in the same potential window and at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. It is seen that the enclosed CV curve area occupied by Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF is much larger than that of Co3S4/rGO/NF, indicating that Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF has a larger specific capacitance.

(c) GCD curves of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF at various current densities. (d) Specific capacitances of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF, Co3S4/rGO/NF and NiCo2O4/rGO/NF at different current densities.

In addition, compared with Co3S4/rGO/NF, the cathodic and anodic peaks of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF migrate to negative and positive potentials due to the phase transition of the material.36Fig. 4b shows the CV curves of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF at scanning rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 within a potential window of −0.1–0.8 V (vs. SCE). It is seen that all the CV curves show obvious redox peaks, which correspond to the faradaic reactions as follows (eqn (1)–(4)).10,37 NiCo2O4 + OH− + H2O ↔ NiOOH + 2CoOOH + e−(1) CoOOH + OH− ↔ CoO4 + H2O + e−(2) Co3S4 + OH− ↔ Co3S4OH + e−(3) Co3S4OH + OH− ↔ Co3S4O + H2O + e−(4)
In addition, as the scanning rate increases, the potential gap between the cathodic and anodic peaks of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF extends since a higher potential is required for the faradaic reaction at a large scanning rate.34 The GCD curves of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF at different current densities with a potential window of 0–0.5 V (vs. SCE) are shown in Fig. 4c. All the GCD curves show obvious charge–discharge plateaus on account of the faradaic redox reactions. For comparison, the detailed CV and GCD curves of the control Co3S4/rGO/NF and NiCo2O4/rGO/NF electrodes are provided in Fig. S2.† The specific capacitance was calculated by using eqn (S1)† on the basis of the GCD curves (Fig. 4c and Fig. S2b, d†). The calculation results are presented in Fig. 4d. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF exhibits superior specific capacitance compared to Co3S4/rGO/NF and NiCo2O4/rGO/NF at the same current density. The specific capacitances of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF, NiCo2O4/rGO/NF and Co3S4/rGO/NF are 6.34 (3.67), 1.5735 (0.71) and 1.55 (0.56) F cm−2, respectively, at a current density of 2 (50) mA cm−2. Importantly, the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF also exhibits a superior rate capability (57.9%) to NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (45%) and Co3S4/rGO/NF (36.3%), as the current density increases from 2 to 50 mA cm−2. The Nyquist plots of the electrodes along with an equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. 4e) are used to analyze the electrode kinetics and resistance. The intercept between the curve and X-axis represents the equivalent series resistance (Rs), and the semicircle diameter in the high frequency region manifests the charge transfer resistance (Rct).38 The equivalent circuit simulation result shows that the Rs and Rct values of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (Rs = 0.75 Ω, Rct = 0.47 Ω) are much smaller than those of NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (Rs = 0.82 Ω, Rct = 1.52 Ω), indicating that the electrode conductivity is improved after coating NiCo2O4 on relatively conductive Co3S4/rGO/NF (Rs = 1.56 Ω, Rct = 0.23 Ω), and the core–shell structure is conducive to charge transfer. In addition, the straight line in the low frequency region for Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF shows a higher slope value (Warburg impedance, ZW) than that for NiCo2O4/rGO/NF, suggesting that Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF has more efficient charge diffusion.37 The cycling durability of the electrode is a crucial parameter for real applications. Fig. 4f illustrates the capacitance retention of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF and Co3S4/rGO/NF after 5000 cycles of charge/discharge at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. It can be seen that Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF (70.9% capacitance retention) exhibits significantly improved electrochemical stability compared with Co3S4/rGO/NF (43.8% capacitance retention) due to the consolidated core–shell structure and protection effect of NiCo2O4. It should be noted that 29.1% capacitance is lost after 5000 cycles, which may be ascribed to the peel off of the active materials.
The charge storage mechanism of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF was further revealed by analyzing the relationship between the cathodic/anodic peak current (i) and scan rate (υ) from the CV curves (Fig. S3a†) collected at low scanning rates using the power rule (eqn (S3)†).39,40 As shown in Fig. 5a, the b-values of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF for the anodic and cathodic processes are 0.64 and 0.57, respectively. This result implies that the charge storage mechanism of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF is mainly diffusion-controlled, with a little capacitive contribution. On the basis of eqn (S4),†39,40 the contributions of capacitive and diffusion-controlled processes to total current response can be distinguished, as shown in Fig. S3b–f† and Fig. 5b. The capacitive contribution ratios of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF are 31.2%, 44.9%, 59.4%, 67.9% and 71.8% at scanning rates of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mV s−1, respectively. With an increase of the scanning rate, the proportions of the diffusion-controlled process decrease, due to the delayed infiltration of the electrolyte inside the electroactive sites.

The application potential of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF electrode was investigated in a two-electrode ASC device, where it was used as the cathode and an AC electrode was used as the anode. The electrochemical properties of the AC electrode are provided in Fig. S4,† which shows typical EDLC features. The specific capacitance is 202.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Thus, the mass ratio of AC to Co3S4@NiCo2O4 for assembling the ASC device is fixed at 3.1 according to the charge balance between the anode and cathode (eqn (S5)†).41Fig. 6a shows the CV curves of individual Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF and AC at 50 mV s−1 in a three-electrode system. It is seen that AC exhibits EDLC characteristics in a potential window of −1–0 V, while Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF demonstrates faradaic behavior at −0.1–0.8 V. Therefore, the working voltage of the assembled ASC can be extended to 1.6 V. Fig. 6b shows the CV curve of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC cell at scanning rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 within a voltage window of 0–1.6 V. The quasi-rectangular CV curves with wide redox peaks of the ASC device imply an ideal charge match between the battery-type electrode and the capacitive electrode.42 The GCD curves of the cell at current densities from 1 to 10 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 6c. The symmetric curves indicate the excellent reversibility and coulombic efficiency of the ASC device. From the GCD curves, the specific capacitances are estimated to be 100.5, 89.8, 82.1, 71.9 and 57.5 F g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 6d). The energy density and power density of the ASC device were further calculated by using eqn (S6) and (S7).†41 As shown in the Ragone plots (Fig. 6e), the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC cell can deliver a high energy density of 35.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 799.3 W kg−1. When the power density is increased to 7982.6 W kg−1, the ASC device can still deliver an energy density of 20.4 W h kg−1. In addition, compared with previously reported ASC devices fabricated with similar electrode materials, the energy storage properties of Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC are superior to those of many of them, such as 3D holey graphene (3DHG)/NiCo2O4 (NCO)//3DHG/NCO (9.38 W h kg−1 at 250 W kg−1),43 NiCo2O4//AC (25.2 W h kg−1 at 799.6 W kg−1),44 NiCo2O4 (NCO)//AC (37.33 W h kg−1 at 691.31 W kg−1),45 Co3S4/g-C3N4-10//AC (35.7 W h kg−1 at 850.2 W kg−1),46 and NiCo2O4/Co3S4 (NC-9)//AC (14 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1).47 For the practical application of the ASC equipment, cycle stability is an important indicator. Fig. 6f shows the fluctuation of the specific capacitance and coulombic efficiency of the ASC device during cycling tests. It can be seen that after 10000 GCD cycles, the initial capacitance retention is around 85.7%, and the coulombic efficiency remains around 95%, indicating the outstanding electrochemical durability of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC. Moreover, two solid-state ASC devices connected in series can light four green LED bulbs for 4 min (Fig. 6g), highlighting the potential of the ASC device in practical applications. The excellent electrochemical performance of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF electrode can be ascribed to the following aspects: (i) the direct construction of Co3S4@NiCo2O4 on rGO/NF avoids additional resistance, and the rGO improves the electronic coupling between the active component and the substrate. (ii) The hollow Co3S4 derived from the MOF not only retains the original morphology, but also provides more electroactive sites and ion transport paths. (iii) The coating of NiCo2O4 on Co3S4 can prevent the dissolution of Co3S4 during charging/discharging processes, thus ensuring the stability of the material. Besides, the core–shell structure can make full use of the merits of Co3S4 and NiCo2O4.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, hierarchical core–shell hollow Co3S4@NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays have been constructed through a MOF-engaged strategy, and used as binder-free electrodes for SCs. The Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF exhibits a superior specific capacitance (6.34 F cm−2/1681 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2), rate performance (57.9% at 50 mA cm−2) and cycling durability (70.9%, after 5000 cycles) to Co3S4/rGO/NF (1.55 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, 36.3% at 50 mA cm−2, and 43.8%, after 5000 cycles). Besides, the assembled Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF//AC cell can deliver a high energy density of 35.7 W h kg−1 (799.3 W kg−1). More importantly, the ASC device shows excellent cycling performance. The initial capacitance retention is ∼85.7%, and the coulombic efficiency remains at ∼95% during 10000 GCD cycles. Two solid-state ASCs can power four green LED bulbs for 4 min. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the Co3S4@NiCo2O4/rGO/NF makes it a promising candidate electrode for electrochemical energy storage devices.
