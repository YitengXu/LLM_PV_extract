    , Accepted 5th November 2010First published on 25th November 2010AbstractBlood mimetic thixotropy sol–gel electrolytes were prepared and sandwiched between dye-coated porous TiO2 and a platinum counter-electrode to form a dye-sensitized solar cell. The highest overall conversion efficiency of 6.45%, and the fill factor of 0.74 under the white light irradiation AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) were obtained.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attracting much attention because of their low cost, ease of fabrication, high light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies, and environmentally friendly properties.1,2 A light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of more than 11% was achieved in a liquid electrolyte-based DSSC.3 However, considering the potential problems of the leakage and volatilization of the liquid, many efforts have been made in developing solid-state and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, such as polymer gel electrolytes,4–8 organic hole conductors,9–11 and inorganic p-type semiconductors (CuI, etc.).12–14 Due to low ionic conductivity, imperfect soakage of porous TiO2 film and poor contact with counter-electrode, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on quasi-solid/solid-state electrolytes were less than 7.2%.15–17 If an electrolyte can avoid the leakage and volatilization of liquid electrolyte and keep a high ionic conductivity and good interfacial contact with both porous TiO2 film and counter-electrode, it is possible to accelerate the practical application of DSSCs.
For the fabrication of DSSCs, electrolytes are ideally liquid during the filling process, while they are better to become solid afterwards because of the sealing and saving conveniences. Blood thixotropy is the reversible transformation between solution and gel in which blood platelets act as the main framework with three-dimensional (3D) networks, which can be broken under stirring and rebuilt without disturbing. Inspired by this phenomenon, we prepared the blood-like thioxotropy electrolytes using a precursor by hydrolyzation of tetrabutyl titanate, whose behavior is similar to that of blood platelets by forming 3D networks. The nanometer titania particles are capable of self-organizing into newly dispersed aggregates to form 3D structures by supramolecular interactions through hydrogen bonding (as shown in Fig. 1a). Such network structures can be mechanically stirred and regenerated to form a gel by standing still for a while (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b shows the photos of the as-prepared thixotropy titania precursor nanocomposite electrolytes (TPNEs) in the state of gel (left) and solution (right). The thixotropy property can enhance electrolyte fluidity and wettability by mechanical stirring, so that the electrolyte can be efficiently filled into the nanoporous TiO2 electrode. Then the electrolytes are self-assembled into a 3D network in the internal space between the nanoporous TiO2 photoanode and the counter-electrode of the DSSC. These processes generated highly efficient DSSCs with the quasi-solid state electrolyte.

Conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (NSG group, 14 Ω/□) was coated with a 6 μm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer prepared by a coating of nanocrystalline TiO2 paste with the high voltage electrohydrodynamic equipment (EHD method) and sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The detailed experiments can be found elsewhere.18,19 The TiO2 layer was sensitized by a monolayer adsorption of ruthenium complex dyes (N3, Solaronix), Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2 (dcbpy = 2,2′-bipyridine- 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid) for 24 h in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution. The translucent titania precursor colloid (TPC) was prepared by slowly dripping 10 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd) into a stirred mixture of 30 mL glacial acetic acid and 50 mL deionized water at 0 °C and then stirred for 8 h. The viscous ionic liquid electrolyte (VILE) was composed of 0.05 M iodine, 0.1 M LiI and 0.45 M N-methyl-benzimidazole (NMBI) in a mixture of 3-methoxypropionitrile and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII; volume ratio 1:2). The conductive TPNEs were prepared by simply mixing different volume ratios of TPC with VILE under sonication for 2 h. Then the volatile composites were removed in a rotary evaporator at 60 °C under vacuum (2 h). Here, the TPNEs were prepared with the primitive volume ratios of TPC/ VILE as 5:1, 10:1 and 20:1, and labelled with TPNE1, TPNE2 and TPNE3, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the TPNEs gels have very good thermal stability and photoelectrical properties. A thin layer of TPNEs was filled between the dye-sensitized TiO2 layer and a Pt/FTO counter-electrode. The brown TPNEs layer is in close contact with the surface of the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode and FTO counter-electrode to form the cell.

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of TPNE3 deposited into the dye-sensitized TiO2 porous film. A smooth surface of dye-sensitized heterojunction can be clearly seen (Fig. 2a). From the side view shown in Fig. 2b, we can see that the inner structure of TiO2 layer is homogeneous without the crystalline phase, indicating that TPNE3 is a homogeneous gel.

Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI630B, Chenhua Instruments Co., Shanghai) under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation of solar simulator illumination according to ref. 20. The photocurrent density–voltage curves for the DSSCs with TPNEs and VILE as a comparison are presented in Fig. 3. The photoelectrical parameters of DSSCs are also listed in Table 1. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (ff) and overall power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs with TPNE1 are 0.628 V, 13.87 mA cm−2, 0.74 and 6.45%, respectively. Compared with the VILE cell, the values of ff for TPNEs are all in the range of 0.70–0.74, indicating that TPNEs benefit the photoelectrical properties of DSSCs with the presence of TPC. However, the Voc values of TPNEs are decreased compare to that of VILE. It was proposed that the dissociated positive Ti4+ ions and protons in the TPNEs can be adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2 and hence the conduction band of TiO2 is possible to undergo a positive shift. Similar phenomena have already been reported in the case of adding additives in the electrolyte, such as lithium ions, alkali ions and 4-tert-butylpyridine, which are generally believed to affect the surface properties and the electrochemical potentials of TiO2.21,22 From Table 1, all three solar cells with TPNEs produce high light-electrical conversion efficiencies within the range of 5.70%–6.45%. While for TPNE3, the values of Jsc and η are lower than those of TPNE1 and TPNE2 mainly because the higher viscosity of TPNE3 makes the electrolyte filling into the pore of TiO2 difficult and results in poorer electrical contact with the TiO2 surface.

The photocurrent action spectra of DSSCs are shown in Fig. 3 (inset), which is close to the absorption spectra of the sensitizer (N3), indicating that the generated photocurrent results from electron injection of the dye. The maximum incident monochromatic photocurrent conversion efficiency is ca. 62% at 530 nm for DSSCs with TPNE1 and TPNE2, while the value is ca. 56% for TPNE3. However, the maximum incident monochromatic photocurrent conversion efficiency of DSSCs with VILE is ca. 68% at 530 nm, which is higher than those in the TPNEs due to the larger current density.
The ionic conductivities of the VILE and TPNEs films were determined with an alternating current (AC) impedance technique on Zahner IM6eX impedance analyzer (Germany) in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 0.1 MHz at room temperature (20 °C) with a signal amplitude of 5 mV. The ionic conductivity σ of the film is calculated by the equation, σ = L/(ARb). Here L is the thickness of the electrolyte film and A is the area of the electrode. The resistance (Rb) was taken at the intercept of the Nyquist plot with the real axis in high frequency.23 From Fig. S3,† it was found that with the increase of the portion of TPC, the conductivity of the mixtures decreased slightly for TPNE1 compared with pure VILE, and then enhanced with increasing volume content of TPC for TPNE2 and TPNE3. The electrical conductivity of TPNEs and VILE were about 10−3 S cm−1, close to the reported values.17,24 At the low TPC range, the conductivity decrease may be attributed to the viscosity of TPNE that restrict the ion (I− and I3−) diffusion and mobility due to the formation of an –O–Ti–O–Ti– network in VILE system. The conductivity increases at the high TPC range because the formation of loosened 3D network contains big pore channels that benefit ion diffusion and mobility. The electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out on a Zahner IM6eX impedance analyzer in the frequency range from 0.02 Hz to 0.1 MHz under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and open-circuit condition.23 As shown in Fig. 4, values of Rs (charge transport resistance of boundaries) in the highest frequency range for devices containing TPNE1, TPNE2 and TPNE3 are increased slightly (ca.13.8 Ω) compared with that of the device with VILE, and the semicircle of high frequency decreased slightly with increasing TPC amount (as shown in Fig. 4 (inset)). While for the medium-frequency semicircle, the bigger semicircles related to inner transport resistance of TPNEs in DSSCs increased from VILE to TPNE3. The cells with higher semicircles produce lower photocurrents similar to those reported.25 Furthermore, from the Bode phase plots in Fig. S4,† the characteristic frequency of both VILE and TPNE1 in the medium-frequency range is 10.1 Hz, while that of both TPNE2 and TPNE3 increase to 18.1 Hz, suggesting that the electron lifetime is shortened a little with increasing TPC amount. In the low frequency range, the semicircles and characteristic frequencies only showed small differences between TPNEs and VILE, indicating that the addition of TPC has very little influence on the diffusion and mobility of the I3− and I− ions.

In summary, the DSSC based on blood mimetic thixotropy sol–gel electrolytes fabricated in this paper gives a high conversion efficiency of more than 6% and a high fill factor over 70%. Another significant merit of our cell is its extreme ease in making and handling, making itself a low-cost alternative to liquid and quasi-solid electrolyte compositions. Its thixotropy performance can infiltrate into the pores of the TiO2 film and ensure good wettability and better contact with the TiO2 film. The electrolyte also displays good ionic conductivity. The ease of sealing is also worth noting, because the extremely viscous composite paste holds together both electrodes. Finally, the fabrication of dye-sensitized cells can be conducted to reduce the damage of dye molecules at low temperature, which can be applied to the fabrication of a plastic film-type flexible photocell by screen-printing the titania precursor nanocomposite electrolytes.
