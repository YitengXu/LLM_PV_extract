    , Accepted 19th February 2018First published on 20th February 2018AbstractPyrite (FeS2) is a promising electrode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) because of its high natural availability, low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, high theoretical capacity (894 mA h g−1) and high theoretical specific energy density (1270 W h kg−1, 4e−/FeS2). Nevertheless, the use of FeS2 in electrochemical capacitors was restricted due to fast capacity fading as a result of polysulfide (S/Sn2−) formation during the initial electrochemical cycling. In order to avoid the formation of polysulfides, we employed the strategy of utilizing an ether based electrolyte (1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/diglyme (DGM)). Herein, we introduce FeS2/C as the Faradaic electrode for a non-aqueous hybrid electrochemical capacitor (NHEC) in combination with activated carbon (AC) as a non-Faradaic electrode, and 1.0 M LiTFSI/DGM as a non-aqueous electrolyte. Specifically, FeS2/C nanoparticles have been prepared via the sulfidation of a room temperature synthesized Fe-based MOF (metal organic framework) precursor. The fabricated FeS2/C∥AC NHEC, operating within the chosen voltage window of 0–3.2 V, delivered energy densities in the range of 63–9 W h kg−1 at power densities of 152–3240 W kg−1. Remarkable cycling stability with stable energy density retention for 2500 cycles at high power densities (729, 1186 and 3240 W kg−1) was observed.
Introduction
The increasing demand for high-energy-density and high-power-density storage systems has motivated research toward energy-storing materials and devices that are environmentally friendly (minimal environmental impact, no emissions, and recyclable components) and efficient (long operational life, resistant to thermal stress, high specific energy, and economical raw materials). Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, are emerging as an attractive solution for energy-storage devices because of their favorable properties such as high power densities, long cycle life and relatively low cost of production. In electrochemical capacitors, electrical energy is stored in the form of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) or a pseudocapacitor mechanism between the positive and negative electrodes.1–4 In the case of EDLCs, the positive and negative charges are stored electrostatically on the electrode surface. Materials with high surface areas such as activated carbon, graphene, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been studied as electrodes for EDLCs.4,5 On the other hand, pseudocapacitor materials (such as MnO2 and RuO2) store electrical energy Faradaically by electrosorption and very fast reversible redox reactions on the surface of the active material at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte.1,4,6 The use of pseudocapacitive electrode materials in symmetric capacitor systems causes unevenness in the charge capacity of electrodes because, in pseudocapacitive materials, the electrochemical process characteristic is strongly dependent on the electrode potential which can result in significantly different behaviors in the same material under positive and negative polarization.7 Pseudocapacitive behaviors are further classified into (1) underpotential deposition, (2) redox pseudocapacitance, and (3) intercalation pseudocapacitance.8
The research on electrochemical capacitors is mostly focused on aqueous electrolyte systems with a limited cell working potential (0–1 V). The narrow potential window leads to restricted energy and power densities which are critically dependent on the square of the potential difference between the electrodes. Consequently, various approaches have been proposed such as the hybridization of Faradaic and non-Faradaic electrodes into a single two-electrode device (termed asymmetric capacitor) for improving the cell's working potential window.9 A non-Faradaic electrode in the system helps to increase the open-circuit voltage and maintain the reactive potential, thus increasing the energy density.10 Another approach is to use non-aqueous electrolyte solutions (organic/ionic liquid) for a wider electrochemical stability window (0–5 V vs. Li/Li+).11 The hybridization of high specific capacity battery-like electrodes with excellent rate capability supercapacitor electrodes in a non-aqueous electrolyte with a wide working potential window resulted in hybrid electrochemical capacitors with high energy and power densities and with long life spans.12,13 In a hybrid capacitor, during the charging/discharging process, the anions are adsorbed and desorbed at the non-Faradaic electrode and lithium ions are stored indirectly in the form of an electrochemical reaction involving Faradaic electron transfer and an electrochemical phase transformation of the battery-like electrode.3 Thus, electrochemical capacitors are classified as EDLC, pseudocapacitor, aqueous or non-aqueous, symmetric or asymmetric, lithium-ion capacitor, hybrid, and BatCap based on the charge storage mechanism in the electrodes, types of electrolytes, and the electrode arrangement in the cathode and anode.7,10,14 Over the past few decades, various battery-like electrodes such as TiO2, Li4Ti5O12, LiMn2O4, MnO2, V2O5, TiP2O7, SnO2/MnO2, NiCo2O4/MnO2, and bended polyester fiber have been studied for hybrid electrochemical capacitor applications.4,14–21 In addition, intercalation pseudocapacitive storage observed in materials such as Nb2O5 and LiFeTiO4 demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance due to its solid-state diffusion-limited reaction mechanism.8,17,22
In order to increase the energy density of the hybrid capacitors, the specific capacitance of the electrodes has to be increased and the operating potential window has to be broadened.18 In this scenario, large capacity, low or high electrochemical potential and naturally available materials are suitable for a Faradaic electrode in a hybrid electrochemical capacitor. Metal sulfide (MSx) nanomaterials (M = Ti, Mo, Cu, Ni, and Fe) have attracted considerable attention due to their excellent properties and promising applications in electronic, luminescence, energy conversion, and energy storage devices.23,24 Among the metal sulfides, the iron disulfide (FeS2) pyrite structure has gained considerable interest for solar cells and lithium-ion batteries because of its high natural availability, low toxicity properties and cost-effectiveness.25–27 The most common crystal forms of pyrite are cubic and pentagonal dodecahedral.27 Over the past three decades, iron disulfide has been extensively studied as the electrode material in primary and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries at moderate and high-temperature applications because of its high theoretical capacity of 894 mA h g−1 and high theoretical specific energy density of 1270 W h kg−1 (4e−/FeS2).27 At ambient temperature, lithium ions are stored via a conversion reaction and the corresponding electrochemical reaction mechanism is as follows: FeS2 + 2Li + 2e− → Li2FeS2(1) Li2FeS2 + 2Li + 2e− → Fe + 2Li2S.(2)
Based on previous reports, it is well understood that the initial lithiation of the FeS2 electrode involves two reactions (eqn (1) and (2)), which can occur in two equal capacity voltage plateaus. Under normal conditions, the voltage plateaus related to these two equations are merged into a single plateau at ∼1.5 V. However, a split in the voltage plateaus into ∼1.7 and ∼1.5 V can be observed under conditions such as low current rate, high temperature, or nano-sized particles with a favorable morphology.28,29
Subsequent extraction of Li+ occurs during charging; the iron is oxidized to provide electrons to react with Li2S which forms Li2FeS2 and releases Li ions (eqn (3)).30 The extraction of additional Li ions (0 < x < 0.8) leads to the formation of a phase that is likely hexagonal Li2−xFeS2 (0 < x < 0.8) as shown in eqn (4).26 Further cell charging (x > 0.8) leads to the decomposition of Li2−xFeS2 into FeSy and elemental sulfur (S).26 This occurrence is easily observed as a voltage plateau above 2.4 V in the galvanostatic charging curve. During the discharge process that follows, S reacts with Li+ to generate a polysulfide (Li2Sn), which can be easily identified by a discharge plateau above 2 V. These polysulfides (Li2Sn, 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) are readily dissolved in the electrolyte and lead to a loss of S, redox shuttling and Li corrosion. This process results in structural irreversibility of the FeS2 electrode during the charging process and ultimately leads to poor cycle performance.31,32 Hence, the cycle performance of Li/FeS2 cells varies greatly with the charging cut-off voltage and current. Recent studies demonstrated various strategies to improve the electrochemical performances of the FeS2 material: (a) limiting the electrochemical reaction between Li2FeS2 and Li(2−x)FeS2,31,33 (b) controlling the nanoscale morphology of FeS2 particles,34,35 (c) the addition of highly conducting carbon materials such as CNTs or graphene,36 and (d) preparing a composite phase of FeS2–Li2S.32 Fe + 2Li2S → Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e−(3) Li2FeS2 → Li2−xFeS2 + xLi+ + xe− (0 < x < 0.8)(4) Li2−xFeS2 → FeSy + (2 − y)S + (2 − x)Li+ + (2 − x)e− (x > 0.8)(5)
In addition, the electrochemical performance of FeS2 electrodes also depends on the electrolyte medium utilized. According to previous reports, the inferior electrochemical performance in Li–S batteries is due to the irreversible chemical reaction of sulfur with a carbonate based electrolyte which resulted in the formation of inert polysulfides.37 This phenomenon seriously causes sudden capacity fading and poor cycle performance due to the loss of active material. These studies also pointed out that high nucleophilic nature solvents such as carbonate, ester, aldehyde, ketone and anhydride-type are unsuitable for Li–S cells. Therefore, most of the solvents used in the recent reports on Li–S batteries have been focused on ether-based electrolytes such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME).38–40 Similarly, transition metal sulfide electrode materials like FeS2 pyrites have demonstrated the deteriorating electrochemical performance caused by the rapid capacity decay on short-term cycling in a commercialized carbonate electrolyte medium of lithium-ion batteries.35,41 To improve their electrochemical performance, recently, liquid electrolytes such as triflate salt (LiTFSI) in ether based solvents (1,3-dioxolane/dimethoxyethane, diglyme, and tetraglyme) have been utilized.29,42–45
Furthermore, for enhancing the specific capacitance of the electrodes, metal organic framework (MOF) based synthesis has gained considerable interest due to the prospect of developing a promising class of porous materials with very large specific surface area and ultrahigh porosity.46–50 Our group has been successful in the synthesis of various transition metal oxides using a MOF based technique for lithium ion battery application.46–49 Herein, we present the first report of FeS2 synthesized via the sulfidation of an iron-based MOF as an electrode material for a non-aqueous hybrid electrochemical capacitor (NHEC). In 1980, Conway et al. first reported the pseudocapacitive behavior of FeS2 in an acidic aqueous electrolyte.2,51 They observed the reversible two-electron transfer between persulfide (S-S)2− and sulfide (S2−) at the FeS2 electrode surface. To the best of our knowledge, studies on FeS2 in electrochemical capacitors have seldom been reported; more specifically, non-aqueous electrochemical capacitor systems have not been reported. In light of the above observations, we studied the electrochemical performance of the FeS2∥AC NHEC using an ether based non-aqueous electrolyte ((LiTFSI)/DGM).
Experimental
FeS2/C synthesis: As a precursor material, a Fe-based MOF was synthesized using a simple room temperature procedure.52,53 Initially, 0.04 mol of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in 100 ml of ethanol. After that, 0.01 mol of FeCl2·4H2O was added to the above solution and stirred for 30 min to form a homogeneous solution. Then the mixture was self-aged in normal atmosphere at room temperature for 24 h. Finally, a dense brown-yellow slurry was obtained by centrifugation and washing several times with ethanol and acetone. The resulting Fe-based MOF precursor was collected after drying the above product at 80 °C for 12 h. Then 0.16 mg of Fe-MOF and 0.32 mg of sulfur (S) were thoroughly mixed and transferred to an aluminum boat. The mixture was heated at 400 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace under a flow of argon gas medium (100 mL min−1). In order to remove residual sulfur, the annealed powder sample was washed several times with ethanol, 1 N HCl, and acetone. Finally, FeS2/C powders were obtained after drying the above sample at 80 °C overnight.
Structural characterization of the powder was performed using a synchrotron powder X-ray diffractometer (SXRD) from the 9B station beam line of the Pohang Light Source (PLS), South Korea. The incident X-rays were vertically collimated using a mirror and monochromated to a wavelength of 1.5184 Å using a double-crystal Si (111) monochromator. The detector arm of the vertical scan diffractometer was composed of seven sets of Soller slits, flat Ge (111) crystal analyzers, antiscatter baffles, and scintillation detectors. Each set was separated by 20°. The samples were rotated about the normal to the surface during the measurement to increase the statistical validity of the results. A step scan was performed in 0.02° increments at room temperature. The particle surface morphology was observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S-4700 Hitachi). XPS measurements were carried out using a Thermo VG Scientific instrument (Multilab 2000) dual anode X-ray source Al Kα radiation (h = 1486.6 eV). The spectrometer was calibrated using the photoemission line Ag 3d5/2 (binding energy 368.3 eV). The Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were recorded from the BL7D beam line of the Pohang Light Source (PLS), a third-generation synchrotron radiation source, in the 2.5 GeV storage ring with a ring current of 120–180 mA. A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator was used to monochromatize the X-ray photon energy. To reduce the incident X-ray intensity by approximately 30%, the monochromator was detuned to eliminate higher-order harmonic contaminations. All spectra were recorded at room temperature in the transmission mode. The monochromator energy was calibrated with the K-edge position of Fe foil at 7.112 keV and was reproducible within 0.1 eV between the scans. The incident X-ray intensity was monitored in pure N2 gas-filled ionization chambers. The obtained data were processed in the usual way to obtain the absorbance and analyzed using the ATHENA and ARTEMIS programs of the IFEFFIT program suite.54 Thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) was performed in the temperature range 30–700 °C under an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (TG-50 Shimadzu Co., Japan).
The FeS2/C electrodes were prepared by mixing the active material (80%), super P (10%), 5 wt% aqueous solution of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC, 4%) and 50 wt% aqueous solution of styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR, 6%). Distilled water was then added to the above mixture and mixed in a Spex ball mill for 20 min to obtain a homogeneous slurry, which was then coated uniformly onto a copper foil current collector. The coated electrodes were dried under vacuum for 12 h and then pressed between stainless steel twin rollers at room temperature. The active material mass in the electrodes was optimized to ∼1.5 mg cm−2. The activated carbon electrodes were prepared by mixing activated carbon (77%) with a teflonized acetylene black (TAB, 23%) binder. The mixture was then pressed over a 2 cm2 stainless steel mesh, which served as a current collector, and was vacuum dried at 120 °C overnight. The electrochemical performance of the FeS2/C electrode and activated carbon (AC) was examined separately using a 2032 coin cell setup consisting of 1.0 M lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li(CF3SO2)2N) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in diglyme (DGM) as the electrolyte; a Whatman glass fiber (GF/D) was used as the separator and Li foil was used as the counter and reference electrodes. The Li∥FeS2/C half-cell was tested in a potential range of 1.1–2.5 V (vs. Li/Li+) at different current densities. Similarly, activated carbon with a surface area of 1800 m2 g−1 (Haycarb, Sri Lanka) was also tested in a half-cell with a Li electrode in a potential range of 2.5–3.9 V (vs. Li/Li+).
The structural and electrochemical stability of FeS2/C electrodes after multiple insertions/extractions of Li ions was examined using synchrotron ex situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. Ex situ FeS2/C electrode samples were prepared with Li∥FeS2/C half-cells that were cycled between 1.1 and 2.5 V vs. Li/Li+ at 0.5 A g−1 using galvanostatic charge/discharge conditions and the cycling was terminated at the electrochemical potential equivalent of the end of the first and fifth cycles. The FeS2/C electrodes were then removed from the coin cell, washed with diglyme and dried in an Ar flow chamber. The samples were then transferred to an airtight vessel under an Ar atmosphere for further ex situ characterization. Pristine samples, which represent the material in its purest form, were not exposed to the electrolyte or to any electrical bias.
To understand the working potential of the NHEC, a stainless steel three-electrode cell (HS-3E Test Cell) was utilized with the prepared FeS2/C as the anode, AC as the cathode and a lithium metal ring as the reference electrode.52 For the NHEC full cell, the FeS2/C electrode was used as the anode, and activated carbon as the cathode. In both cell types, 1.0 M lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dissolved in diglyme (DGM) and a Ø 18 mm glass fiber (Whatman) were used as the electrolyte and separator, respectively. In order to optimize the electrochemical performance of the NHEC, the FeS2/C∥AC asymmetric capacitor was studied at various FeS2/C:AC mass ratios, with varying potential windows from 0 to 3.2 V, under various current rates using galvanostatic charge/discharge conditions; the best performance was obtained for a 1:5.8 mass ratio (FeS2/C:AC). Galvanostatic studies and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed on the coin cells, assembled in an argon-filled glove box, using a programmable battery tester (BTS-2004H, Nagano, Japan) and Bio-Logic Science Instruments.
Results and discussion
In this work, FeS2/C was facilely synthesized via the sulfidation of Fe-MOF.53,54 Initially, the Fe-based MOF precursor was prepared by a simple mixing of 2-methylimidazole with divalent Fe ions in ethanol at room temperature.53,54 The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†) demonstrates the amorphous nature of the intermediate Fe-MOF precursor. The absence of any specific peaks in the lower angle (2θ = 5–15°) of the Fe-MOF XRD pattern could be attributed to the room temperature synthesis of the sample.46 The FESEM images of the Fe-MOF precursor (Fig. S1(b and c), ESI†) illustrate that the individual nanoparticles in the range of 10–20 nm were agglomerated to form secondary particles (50–100 nm). Furthermore, the TG/DTA curves of Fe-MOF in Fig. S2 (ESI†) exhibit weight loss (in TGA) and a corresponding sharp exothermic peak (in DTA) around 350 °C. This weight loss could be attributed to the carbonization of the MOF. Further sulfidation of Fe-MOF at 400 °C for 2 h under a flow of argon gas resulted in the formation of FeS2/C nanoparticles. The synchrotron XRD (SXRD) pattern in Fig. 1(a) illustrates the formation of phase pure FeS2 nanoparticles (JCPDS file 01-042-1340). The lattice parameter value (a = 5.4338) was determined using the Highscore Plus software program.56 The cubic structure of pyrite is represented by octahedral coordination of Fe atoms by six S atoms and tetrahedral coordination of the S atoms by one S and three Fe atoms.27 Apparently, the FESEM images in Fig. 1(b) demonstrate the uniform distribution of particles with an average size of 100–200 nm. The magnified FESEM image in Fig. 1(c) depicts that the secondary particles are composed of an agglomeration of primary particles in the range of 20–50 nm. The sulfidation of Fe-MOF at 400 °C for 2 h leads to the marginal growth of the FeS2 primary particle size to 20–50 nm. Impressively, the sulfidation temperature (400 °C) facilitates the formation of nanoscale FeS2 particles and simultaneous generation of carbon by cleaving of the MOF network. In order to examine the amount of carbon in the FeS2/C sample, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed. The carbon content from the TGA curves (in Fig. S3, ESI†) was estimated to be around 10%.

The electrochemical performance of the FeS2/C electrodes with the insertion/extraction of Li ions was studied in a half-cell configuration with Li foil as the reference and counter electrode. The first, second, and fifth galvanostatic discharge/charge curves of the Li∥FeS2/C cell at 0.5 A g−1 current density at potentials ranging between 1.1 and 2.5 V are shown in Fig. 2(a). The initial discharge curve showed a flat voltage plateau near 1.4 V with a discharge capacity of 798 mA h g−1. Since FeS2/C was investigated as a potential anode for electrochemical capacitors, we tested the electrochemical property of the material in relatively high current densities (0.5 A g−1). The lower initial discharge capacity in comparison with the theoretical capacity of FeS2 (890 mA h g−1) could, therefore, be attributed to the use of a higher current density (0.5 A g−1). The flat plateau near 1.4 V in the first discharge curve demonstrates the electrochemical reaction related to the formation of a Li2FeS2 phase (eqn (1)) in the initial state and Li2S with metallic Fe in the final product (eqn (2)). Subsequent charging curves showed a plateau near 1.85 V and then gradually increased to the upper cut-off voltage (2.5 V). This charging plateau could be attributed to the generation of the Li2FeS2 phase from metallic Fe and Li2S (eqn (3)). Except for a small hump around 2.36 V (only in the 1st cycle), there are no other plateaus at higher voltages (>2.0 V) of the charging curve, which is evidence that there is no electrochemical reaction related to the formation of sulfur as mentioned in eqn (5). This clearly demonstrates that the extraction of Li ions during charging was controlled and x in the Li2−xFeS2 phase is less than 0.8 (eqn (4)). The second discharge curve is entirely different from the first discharge curve and indicates that FeS2 is not recovered at the end of the first charge. Since we limited the upper cut-off voltage to 2.5 V, the electrochemical reaction was expected to follow the reverse reactions of eqn (4) and (3). The formation mechanism of the Li2−xFeS2 phase and Li2S + Fe during electrochemical cycling will be discussed in detail in the following ex situ XANES and ex situ XPS studies. The capacity retention plot in the inset of Fig. 2(a) shows the reversibility of the electrochemical reaction between the Li2S + Fe and Li2−xFeS2 phases (0 < x < 0.8) as illustrated in eqn (3) and (4). Impressively, 82% of the second discharge capacity was maintained after 50 cycles illustrating the improved cycle performance of the FeS2/C electrode by using an ether-based electrolyte. In addition, the discharge rate performance of FeS2/C electrodes displayed in Fig. 2(b) showed that the material can deliver a discharge capacity of about 458, 419, 344, 258, 177, and 79 mA h g−1 at 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 A g−1, respectively.

Fig. 2(c) compares the cyclic voltammograms of the Li∥FeS2/C half-cell from 1.1 to 2.5 V at various scan rates from 1 to 100 mV s−1. In addition, the first few cycles at 0.5 mV s−1 are displayed in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The first discharge curve in Fig. S4 (ESI†) showed a sharp peak near 1.1 V corresponding to the formation of Li2FeS2 followed by Li2S and metallic Fe, as mentioned in the galvanostatic studies. In the successive charging and discharging voltammograms at lower scan rates (≤ 2 mV s−1), we observed broad peaks near 1.9 and 1.3 V for the anodic and cathodic scans, respectively. These peaks present during charging and discharging are indicative of the reversibility of the conversion reaction between Li2S + Fe and Li2−xFeS2, as mentioned in eqn (3) and (4), which agrees with the galvanostatic studies. More specifically, the noticeable shifting in the peaks, along with the broadening and separation of redox peaks with the increase in scan rates, clearly demonstrates the Faradaic characteristics of the battery material. Furthermore, the charge storage contribution from surface capacitive effect and diffusion controlled Li-ion insertion into the bulk region of the particle was investigated by analyzing the cyclic voltammetry data at specific scan rates, namely, 0.5, 2 and 10 mV s−1. The detailed explanation related to the determination of surface capacitive and diffusion limited process contributions are provided in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The comparative plots of capacitive and diffusion limited contributions at different scan rates in Fig. S5(d–f) (ESI†) demonstrate that the surface capacitive contribution increased from 29% at a lower scan rate (0.5 mV s−1) to 63% at a higher scan rate (10 mV s−1). Apparently, increasing the scan rates leads to a drastic increase in the non-diffusion limited pseudocapacitive contributions. The increase in the area of the CV curve as a function of the increase in the scan rates, up to 100 mV s−1, is indicative of higher capacitive charge storage at higher scan rates of the FeS2/C electrode.
In addition, the galvanostatic discharge/charge curves along with the corresponding cycle performance of Li∥FeS2/C using a carbonate based electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC) are shown in Fig. 3. The nano-sized particle with carbon in the synthesized FeS2/C facilitates a stable first discharge curve with a high discharge capacity value of 729 mA h g−1. However, the cyclability plot in Fig. 3 (inset) clearly indicates that the carbonate based electrolyte system suffers from capacity decay with increasing cycle number. On comparing the electrochemical performance of a Li∥FeS2/C half-cell containing a common carbonate based electrolyte (Fig. 3) with that of a similar cell utilizing the present ether based electrolyte (Fig. 2a) under the same measurement parameters, the electrode combined with the ether based electrolyte demonstrates a more stable cycling performance. The enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to diglyme (in the electrolyte) that largely inhibits both the generation of polysulfides and the side reaction between polysulfides.45 Nevertheless, this result clearly indicates the importance of ether based electrolytes in determining the electrochemical performance of FeS2/C in rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

The XANES spectra of the FeS2/C electrode at different electrochemical states, namely, (a) as-prepared, (b) 1.1 V discharged (first and fifth cycle) and (c) 2.5 V charged (fifth cycle), are displayed in Fig. 4(a). The initial state of the Fe K-edge absorption energy at 7118 eV could be assigned to the Fe2+ state. Comparing the Fe K-edge position of the discharged (1.1 V) and charged (2.5 V) electrodes with the pristine electrode, a significant shift in the peak position was observed with respect to the insertion/extraction of Li ions. After the first discharge, the pre-edge, main-edge and higher energy regions slightly shifted to lower energies, indicating a reduction of the average oxidation state of Fe2+ to a lower value. In general, metallic Fe and Li2S form at the end of the first discharge of FeS2 materials; however, the shape of the observed spectra of the discharged state is apparently different from the XANES pattern reported for the Fe metal foil in previous reports.32,55,57 The observed difference in the spectra with respect to the Fe-metal foil could also be due to the difference in the local structure of Fe formed electrochemically from FeS2. This structural difference could be due to the presence of light atoms (Li or S) as first neighbors around Fe atoms and/or the presence of small clusters of Fe0 atoms, which may not have the same XANES pattern compared to the bulk α-Fe.32,55,57 When the cells were charged to 2.5 V, the Fe K-edge shifted to a higher energy level closer to the pristine FeS2 sample. A closer examination of the pattern reveals a pre-edge peak, main-edge and white line, which are different compared to the pristine sample. During charging, the average oxidation state of Fe increased to a higher value equivalent to the initial state (Fe2+) and finally resulted in the formation of compounds like Li2−xFeS2. More specifically, the pre-edge peak around 7113.9 eV that slightly shifted to a lower energy (7113.5 eV) during the discharge process was slightly increased towards a higher value after charging to 2.5 V. In addition, the intensity of the pre-edge peak in the discharged and charged samples is higher than that of the pristine FeS2 sample. In general, pre-edge features correspond to 1s → 3d transitions, which are dipole forbidden in the octahedral symmetry. An increase in the pre-edge peak intensity is, therefore, indicative of distortions in the octahedral symmetry. Thus, the above results suggest a variation in the oxidation state of Fe during the electrochemical reaction along with the formation of compounds like Li2−xFeS2 in the charged state. The local structure and coordination of Fe in the charged state are relatively different from the original FeS2. In other words, FeS2 is not fully recovered after charging to 2.5 V.
 Fig. 4  (a) Ex situ synchrotron XANES patterns and (b) ex situ XPS spectra of a FeS2/C electrode in a Li∥FeS2/C half-cell using 1 M LiTFSI in a DGM electrolyte at various electrochemical states. 
The XPS spectra of the FeS2/C electrode at the pristine, discharged, and charged electrodes after five cycles are shown in Fig. 4(b). The main sulfur peak (S 2p3/2) observed at 162.4 eV could be due to the presence of sulfide in the synthesized pyrite material. In addition, we observed a peak at around 169 eV in all three samples that could be ascribed to the sulfate (SO42−) based impurity phase formed on the surface of the active material58 or electrode components (Na-CMC, SBR and super P). A similar peak at the same position was also observed for the ex situ results of different transition metal oxide materials analyzed during the same time. However, the intensity of this peak was greatly reduced after increasing the argon etching time (not shown), explaining the absence of these impurity phases on the bulk of the active material. Hence, further discussions are focused only on the variation in the oxidation states of the sulfide region at around 162.4 eV. The peak observed at 162.4 eV in the pristine sample corresponds to the disulfide (S22−) of the FeS2 samples. During electrochemical discharge, the position shifted to the lower binding energy of 161.8 eV, indicating the reduction of disulfide to monosulfide (S2−).59 Furthermore, the peak returned to 162.2 eV when the electrode was charged to 2.5 V, showing the reversibility of the conversion reaction between Li2S + Fe and Li2−xFeS2, as illustrated in eqn (3) and (4). The above observations also confirm the absence of any peaks related to S or polysulfides (Sn2−) that are responsible for the poor cycle performances of the FeS2 based electrode material. Thus the above ex situ XPS results clearly demonstrated the application of ether based electrolyte (LiTFSI/DGM), avoided the formation of S or polysulfides (Sn2−) during the electrochemical reaction and ultimately led to an improvement in the cycle performances of the FeS2 electrode.
Similar to the FeS2/C material, activated carbon (AC) was also tested in a lithium half-cell configuration in order to evaluate the optimum mass ratio for the asymmetric electrochemical capacitor system. Fig. S6(a and b) (ESI†) illustrate the cyclic voltammograms and the galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of Li∥AC in the potential range of 2.5–3.9 V vs. Li/Li+. The specific capacitances of the electrode materials from the CV curves were calculated using the following formula:60 (6)where  is the area under the CV curve, m is the mass of the active material (g), υ is the scan rate (mV s−1), and (Vf − Vi) is the working potential range (V). The specific capacitance value was calculated from the galvanostatic charge/discharge curve using the following formula:60 (7)where I is the discharge current (A), t is the discharge time (s), m is the mass (g) of the active material, Vi and Vf are the initial and final potential limits excluding the IR drop (V), respectively.60 The rectangular shape in the CV and linear voltage profile of the galvanostatic charge/discharge curve shows the EDLC behavior of the activated carbon. The corresponding specific capacitances estimated using eqn (6) and (7) were 27.6 and 33 F g−1, respectively. During the electrochemical reaction, (CF3SO2)2N− anions originating from the electrolyte are adsorbed/desorbed over the surface of the activated carbon electrode. Noticeably, the CV curves of the Li∥FeS2/C and Li∥AC half-cells concur with the electrochemical behavior of Faradaic and EDLC materials, respectively. Based on this observation, we deduced that the FeS2/C∥AC electrode combination behaved as a hybrid electrochemical capacitor (HEC).6
It is known from the previously reported literature that the electrochemical performance such as the specific capacitance, cycle performance, energy, and power density of the hybrid capacitors is dependent on the specific capacitance of each electrode, the mass balance between the cathode and the anode, the ion concentration in the electrolyte, and the working potential window.61,62 To optimize the electrochemical performance of the present hybrid capacitor, a three-electrode cell measurement was utilized. Fig. 5a illustrates the initial galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the individual AC and FeS2/C electrode with lithium as the reference electrode. In order to operate the NHEC at 0.1 A g−1 current density, the AC and FeS2/C electrodes were set to work at 0.68 and 0.12 A g−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5a, the response of the AC electrode (curve 1) reveals non-Faradaic charge and discharge processes within the potential range of 2.5–3.9 V vs. Li/Li+, while the FeS2 electrode behavior (curve 2) is similar to the discharge/charge curve observed for the Li//FeS2 half-cell under similar conditions. A proper mass balancing was performed in order to ensure the optimum potential range of the electrodes. Furthermore, the energy density of the hybrid device could be enhanced by increasing the cell working potential. For the two-electrode FeS2/C∥AC NHEC cell, the mass ratio between the cathode and the anode was balanced using the following equation:61,62 qelectrode = mcathode·Cspec, cathode·ΔEcathode = manode·Cspec, anode·ΔEanode(8) (9)where qelectrode is the charge in each electrode, melec is the mass of the active material in each electrode, Cspec. electrode is the specific capacitance of each electrode, ΔEelectrode is the variation in the voltage range of each electrode, and k is the mass ratio between both electrodes.61,62 The CV curves of individual electrodes with lithium as reference electrodes in their specific potential windows along with the FeS2/C∥AC full cell (0–2.8 V) at various scan rates are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The specific capacitances of individual FeS2/C and AC electrodes were calculated from the respective CV curves of Li∥FeS2/C and Li∥AC half-cells.63 On substituting the specific capacitance value and voltage range observed from the individual half-cells in eqn (9), the theoretical mass ratio between FeS2/C:AC was evaluated to be 1:5.8.63 According to that, the potential profiles of the two-electrode FeS2/C∥AC hybrid capacitor were investigated at two different potential windows, namely, 0 to 3.2 V (Fig. 5a and 6b) and 0 to 2.8 V (refer Fig. S8†), under various current densities. The best performance of the two-electrode NHEC cell was determined to be within the wider operating potential window of 0 to 3.2 V (Fig. 5a, curve 3).61,62

Specific energy density is calculated based on the total mass of the active materials in both the FeS2/C and AC electrodes. 

Fig. 5b shows the cyclic voltammograms of the FeS2/C∥AC asymmetric electrochemical capacitor system at potentials sweeping between 0 and 3.2 V and at various scan rates (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s−1). The CV curves at lower scan rates (shown in the inset of Fig. 5), namely, 0.5–5 mV s−1, display redox peaks, which clearly show the Faradaic contribution of the FeS2 material in the hybrid electrochemical capacitor system. Furthermore, the voltammograms at various scan rates are significantly different from the rectangular shape observed in the case of an ideal EDLC behavior. Thus, the shapes of the voltammograms indicate the collective contribution from the Faradaic and EDLC based energy storage mechanisms in the hybrid electrochemical capacitor system. The specific cell capacitances were calculated using eqn (6), where m is the total mass of the active material on the anode and cathode. The FeS2/C∥AC NHEC cell registered specific cell capacitances of 68, 58.6, 48, 40, 22, 15, 10 and 5.5 F g−1 at scan rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mV s−1, respectively.
The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC at various current densities between 0.1 and 3 A g−1 are compared in Fig. 6(a). The current density is calculated based on the total mass of the active materials in both FeS2/C and AC electrodes. The charge/discharge curves show the appearance of curved and linear voltage profiles. These features are indicative of the co-existence of Faradaic and EDLC behaviors, which are characteristic of the hybrid electrochemical capacitor system. During the cell charge/discharge process, Li ions from the electrolyte were inserted/extracted at the anode. At the same time, (CF3SO2)2N− anions were adsorbed/desorbed due to the non-Faradaic reaction at the activated carbon/liquid electrolyte interface. The specific energy density (E) and specific power density (P) of the FeS2/C∥AC asymmetric electrochemical capacitor at various current densities were calculated using the following equation:64 (10) (11)where I is the current,  is the area under the galvanostatic discharge curve, Δt is the discharge time (s), and manode + mcathode is the total active mass of both FeS2/C and AC electrodes. The calculated specific energy densities of the hybrid cell as a function of different current densities are plotted in Fig. 6(b). The material delivered energy densities of 63, 50, 44, 34, 21, 9 and 5 W h kg−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 A g−1, respectively. A gradual decrease in energy density with an increase in current density might be attributed to an ineffective quantity of active material involved in the redox reaction. Fig. 6(c) compared the Ragone plots for the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC system with previously reported lithium-ion based non-aqueous hybrid capacitor systems. Furthermore, the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC delivered 63 W h kg−1 at a power density of 152 W kg−1. Interestingly, as we increase the power density to 3240 W kg−1, the material still delivered an energy density of 9 W h kg−1, illustrating a reasonable discharge rate performance of the NHEC. The present FeS2/C∥AC NHEC system showed better energy and power density than the previously reported lithium-ion based hybrid capacitor systems, namely, CNT-V2O5∥CNT,61 Li4Ti5O12∥AC,61 V2O5∥CNT,65 Mn3O4∥ reduced coal-derived graphene oxide (RCDGO)66 and LiCrTiO4∥AC.67Fig. 4(d) shows the cycle performance of the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC at power densities of 729, 1186 and 3240 W kg−1. Impressively, the specific energy density of the material remains stable when cycling at higher power densities (729, 1186 and 3240 W kg−1) and the initial value was retained even after 2500 cycles. The initial and 2500th charge/discharge curves of the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC at 729 and 1186 W kg−1 are shown in Fig. 7(a and b), respectively. The shapes of the charge/discharge curves of the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC full cell remain almost unaltered even after long-term cycling. The ex situ SEM images of the FeS2/C electrode used in the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC full cell after 1000 cycles at 729 and 1186 W kg−1 are also shown in Fig. 7(c and d), respectively. It is clearly evident that the overall shape of the FeS2/C secondary particles is maintained after 1000 cycles. Shao-Horn et al. also reported a similar observation on the FeS2 electrode when cycled at higher current densities in a lithium half-cell.68 These observations clearly show the stability of the electrodes with respect to electrochemical cycling. The good cycle stability of the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC at a high current density is indicative of high reversibility in the electrochemical reactions.

It is worth noting that pyrite (FeS2) has found limited use in electrochemical capacitor applications owing to its poor cycle performance and rapid capacity fading in carbonate based electrolytes. However, the fact that FeS2 has many advantages of being naturally abundant, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, and possessing high energy density has motivated us to further the development of this electrode for useful electrochemical capacitor applications. Therefore, in the present work we stabilized the electrochemical cyclability of the FeS2/C electrode by avoiding the formation of S and polysulfides (Sn2−) during electrochemical cycling using an ether-based electrolyte. Impressively, the FeS2/C∥AC NHEC system showed reasonably good energy and power density in addition to a stable cycle performance up to 2500 cycles at higher power densities (729, 1186 and 3240 W kg−1) without the addition of any expensive conductive agents like graphene/CNT/MWCNT. In fact, in comparison with earlier studies on transition metal-based sulfide/oxide/phosphate Faradaic electrodes in hybrid or asymmetric electrochemical capacitors, the present FeS2/C based electrode showed reasonable energy and power density values.13,18,66,67,69,70 Cohn et al. recently studied a full cell sodium-ion battery system using pre-sodiated FeS2 as the cathode and a nanocarbon nucleation layer formed on a Al current collector as the anode and achieved a high energy density of 400 W h kg−1.71 When used in a battery configuration, FeS2 demonstrated impressively high energy density under low current rates. However, in the present work, the same material (FeS2/C) used as a Faradaic electrode in combination with activated carbon as the EDLC electrode in a hybrid electrochemical capacitor demonstrated a reasonable energy density, power density and cycle performance. Further efforts such as utilizing calculation strategies, as well as experimental procedures are required to improve the low Coulombic efficiencies related to the irreversible consumption of Li+ ions by the FeS2/C electrode during the initial cycles. Such studies can aid in the complete realization of this hybrid capacitor system for real-time applications. Nevertheless, given that FeS2 is naturally available and environmentally friendly and possesses high theoretical capacity, the present study can aid in the realization of a low-cost and plausible large-scale production of such NHECs.
Conclusions
In this work, a new NHEC system comprising a FeS2/C anode, an activated carbon (AC) cathode, and 1.0 M LiTFSI dissolved in DGM as an electrolyte was fabricated. In addition, FeS2/C nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple MOF-assisted sulfidation process. The FeS2/C∥AC NHEC delivered energy densities of 63, 50, 44, 34, 21, 9 and 5 W h kg−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 A g−1, respectively, within a potential range of 0–3.2 V. In addition, the NHEC cell retains a stable specific cell capacitance for over 2500 cycles at high current densities (729, 1186 and 3240 W kg−1). In particular, this system exhibits energy densities in the range of 63–5 W h kg−1 at power densities of 152–4000 W kg−1. The high reversibility of FeS2/C in this system could be attributed to the use of an ether-based electrolyte that evades the formation of lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn) at higher charging potentials. The performed ex situ XANES and ex situ XPS studies confirmed the reversibility of Li2S + Fe and Li2−xFeS2 (0 < x < 0.8) phases during the electrochemical cycling of Li∥FeS2/C half-cells. Thus, we demonstrated the possibility of using environmentally friendly and high energy density FeS2 as an anode material in NHECs.
