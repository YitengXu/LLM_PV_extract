    , Accepted 3rd July 2021First published on 26th July 2021AbstractSolution-processible and flexible transparent electrodes are highly required for polymer solar cells (PSCs) to accommodate their roll-to-roll manufacturing. Herein, we present a kind of solution-processed silver nanowire (AgNW)-based composite transparent electrode fabricated using blade-coating a SnO2 hydrocolloid and a AgNW aqueous dispersion. The resultant AgNWs:SnO2 composite film demonstrates a smooth surface morphology as the AgNW networks are well covered by colloidal SnO2. The AgNWs:SnO2 transparent film attains a sheet resistance of ca. 17 ohm per square and a high transmittance of ca. 92% at 550 nm. Inverted PSCs without additional cathode buffer layers are fabricated based on the AgNWs:SnO2 composite transparent electrode and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12% is attained. Furthermore, an organic solvent monoethanolamine (MEA) is used to passivate the surface defects of the AgNWs:SnO2 electrode via blade coating. The number of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode is effectively reduced and the PCE of the inverted PSCs is enhanced to 13.5%, benefitting from an increased short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). The synergistic enhancement of JSC and FF is attributed to the improved charge extraction and decreased defect-induced recombination at the cathode–active layer interfaces by MEA modification. Flexible PSCs based on the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite transparent electrode are fabricated via blade-coating and a PCE of 13.0% is attained. The device shows good flexibility with the PCE retaining 80% of its initial value after 500 bending cycles with a bending radius of 5 mm.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have advantages of low-cost solution-processing, light weight and mechanical flexibility, which enable them to be a promising photovoltaic technology in the future.1–6 Rapid development of novel donor and acceptor materials and optimization of the blend active layer morphology strongly boost the progress of PSCs and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 18% has been attained in small-area single-junction devices.7,8 These devices were fabricated on rigid indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates with a mini-area spin-coated active layer (<0.04 cm2). Flexible solution-processible transparent electrodes suitable for large-area processing are highly required to accommodate the roll-to-roll manufacturing of PSCs. Approaches compatible with large-area processing, including blade-coating and roll-to-roll processing, have been employed to prepare the active layer and a relatively high PCE has been achieved.9–12 The devices were fabricated on ITO-based substrates and the interfacial layers were spin-coated. In addition to the active layer, it is also essential to develop flexible solution-processible transparent electrodes and surface modification strategies suitable for large-area processing.
A solution-processed silver nanowire (AgNW)-based electrode film possesses exceptional optical and electrical properties, which make it a promising candidate for flexible transparent electrodes in various optoelectronic devices.13–18 However, the as-prepared AgNW-based transparent electrode film consisting of an interpenetrating network structure renders large surface roughness and poor adhesion to the substrate, limiting its application in thin-film optoelectronic devices.19,20 Besides, the energy-level match between the transparent AgNW-based electrode and the active layer should also be considered since it has a distinct influence on the device performance of PSCs.21 To address these issues, researchers have proposed a composite strategy to prepare AgNW-based transparent electrodes by blending or multi-layer processing. Various materials including inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and conductive polymers have been used in combination with AgNWs for the preparation of solution-processed AgNW composite electrodes.14,19,20,22,23 In the case of PSCs, the commonly used interface materials are undoubtedly more suitable for combining with AgNWs. For example, the PEDOT:PSS and ZnO nanoparticles have been employed to fabricate an AgNW-based composite film that was successfully used as the transparent electrode in high-performance PSCs. SnO2 colloids may be suitable for preparing AgNW-based composite transparent electrodes for PSCs since they have the merits of a deep conduction band, high electron mobility and high transparency in the visible region.24 Up to now, SnO2 colloids have not been used in the preparation of AgNW-based composite electrodes. High-temperature sintered SnO2 has been successfully used as an electron-transporting layer in perovskite solar cells. However, compared with a high-temperature sintered SnO2 layer, a low-temperature processed SnO2 layer used in PSCs has more trap defects, which severely deteriorate the device performance.25 One effective way to tackle this issue is to passivate the surface defects of the SnO2 layer by spin-coating a thin modification layer, such as polymer PFN, PEIE, quantum dots, etc.26,27 Such a modification layer is usually very thin (<10 nm) and hard to apply in large-area solution processing.
Herein, we present a kind of transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode via the blade-coating method and successfully employ it to fabricate high-performance flexible ITO-free PSCs. A new strategy of solvent surface modification is used to passivate the surface defects of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode. The processing of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film and its surface modification are compatible with blade coating. The prepared AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode demonstrates a figure of merit (FOM) of about 300 and superior adhesion capability to glass and PET substrates. The volatile organic solvent monoethanolamine (MEA) is used to passivate the surface defects of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode, which effectively boosts the device performance of PSCs. The device based on the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite transparent electrode achieves a PCE of 13.5% without additional cathode interfacial layers, while the control device without MEA modification attains a PCE of 12%. Blade-coated flexible devices based on the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite transparent electrode were also fabricated and a PCE of 13.0% was achieved.
Results and discussion
The processing of the transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode or the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode prepared on rigid glass or flexible PET substrates is illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and the processing details are given in the Experimental section. The AFM height images and SEM images of the blade-coated pure AgNWs (1-layer), AgNWs:SnO2 composite (3-layer) and MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite (3-layer) are presented in Fig. 1. It is seen that the AgNWs are randomly distributed on the substrate to form inter-connecting networks, but produce a rough surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 23.45 nm on a 20 µm scale. The inter-connecting AgNWs help in forming a highly conductive film; however, the rough surface morphology would cause a severe leakage current and lead to inferior device performance of PSCs. In the case of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film, the RMS roughness is sharply decreased to less than 5 nm due to the effective filling of SnO2 into the inter-connecting AgNW networks. In other words, the inter-connecting AgNW networks are well embedded into the SnO2 matrix. As shown in Fig. 1, the blade-coated MEA modification on the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film does not have a poor effect on the morphology of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film, whose RMS roughness is about 4.13 nm. Both the preparation of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film and its in situ MEA modification are processed via blade-coating.

The MEA modification on the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode film was studied via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The survey XPS spectra of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite and MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite films are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the N 1s and O 1s core spectra for the two samples are presented in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film shows a strong N 1s peak at 399.3 eV while the as-prepared AgNWs:SnO2 composite film does not show an obvious N 1s peak. It indicates that the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is modified with MEA after blade-coating the MEA solvent on the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film and subsequent annealing. The O 1s core spectra of the two samples are shown in Fig. 2(b). As the AgNWs:SnO2 composite films were prepared with only colloidal tin oxide and dispersive AgNWs in H2O and the prepared composite films were annealed at high temperatures, two main states of oxygen may exist in the composite film, originating from the Sn–O covalent bonds in SnO2 and the hydroxyl (–OH) groups on the surface of the colloidal SnO2. Generally, the binding energy of the oxygen atom in the hydroxyl group is larger than that of the oxygen atom combined with metal ions.28 As shown in Fig. 2(b), the O 1s peak of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite shifted to a low-energy region of about 0.5 eV compared with the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The O 1s spectra for the two samples are deconvoluted into two XPS peaks at 530.3 eV and 531.8 eV as shown in Fig. 2(c and d), respectively. The XPS peak at 530.3 eV corresponds to the Sn–O bonds in SnO2 and the higher binding energy at 531.8 eV is attributed to the hydroxyl group on the surface of the colloidal SnO2. Compared to the as-prepared AgNWs:SnO2 composite film, the contribution of the O 1s peak originating from the –OH group relative to that from the Sn–O bonds on the surface of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 film is decreased. It is speculated that the blade-coated MEA solvent reacts with the –OH group on the surface of the colloidal SnO2 and passivates the surface of the composite film. The unreacted MEA solvent volatilizes finally during high temperature annealing. The EDS mapping images of the two composite samples and the corresponding element analysis results are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is clearly shown that the MEA has been attached to the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film since the content of the N element is largely increased from 1.38% of the as-prepared AgNWs:SnO2 composite film to 8.85% of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The content of the O element is decreased on the surface of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The EDS results are consistent with the XPS results.

The thicknesses and properties of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film can be tuned by changing the number of blade-coated AgNWs:SnO2 composite layers. The transmission spectra of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite film prepared with different number of blade-coated composite layers (1–5 layer) are shown in Fig. 3(a). It is seen that the profile of transmittance does not change obviously, while the intensity of transmittance is gradually decreased due to the increased thicknesses with the increasing number of bladed composite layers. The changes of transmittance at 550 nm and the sheet resistance (Rs) of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite films are plotted as a function of the number of blade-coated composite layers in Fig. 3(b). Both the transmittance and Rs change almost linearly with the number of blade-coated layers. The transmittance of the 1-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film at 550 nm is about 94.08%, while it decreases to 87.60% for the 5-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The 1-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film attains a Rs of 30.6 Ω sq−1 while the Rs of the 5-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is decreased to 14.0 Ω sq−1. The detailed transmittance and Rs values of the different AgNWs:SnO2 composite films are summarized in Table 1. The figure of merit (FOM) is often used to evaluate the quality of a transparent conducting electrode (TCE) by balancing between transmittance and Rs. The higher FOM values indicate the higher quality of the TCE. Herein, the FOM values of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite films prepared with different blade-coated layers are calculated according to a reported method.29 As shown in Table 1, the 3-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film attains the highest FOM of 293. Its Rs and transmittance at 550 nm are 17.2 Ω sq−1 and 92.91%, respectively.

The effect of MEA modification on the transmittance of the resultant AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is tested. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the transmittance of the MEA-modified 3-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film does not change obviously compared with the 3-layer AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The flexibility of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is investigated by preparing the composite film on the PET substrate. The Rs changes after bending are used to evaluate the flexibility of the conductive AgNWs:SnO2 composite film. The Rs changes relative to its initial value for the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite/PET substrate and the commercial ITO/PET substrate are plotted as a function of bending cycles in Fig. 3(d). Both the samples were bent toward the PET substrate side and the Rs values were measured after different bending cycles. We can see that the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film does not show a distinct resistivity increment after 1000 bending cycles, indicating its superior mechanical flexibility. However, the commercial ITO/PET substrate experiences an abrupt increase of sheet resistance with the increasing bending circles due to microcrack formation in the rigid ITO film. The comparison implies that the proposed AgNWs:SnO2 composite film possesses better mechanical flexibility than the commercial ITO/PET substrate. The adhesion of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is tested by tearing with 3 M tape and being subjected to ultrasonication in deionized water. Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) exhibits the Rs changes of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 and pure AgNW films with the tape-peeling cycles. The pure AgNW-based film was peeled off the substrate after only a few tape-peeling cycles. However, the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film demonstrates superior adhesion to the substrate and its Rs does not show significant variance after 30 times of tape-peeling tests. The Rs changes of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 and pure AgNW films after ultrasonication in deionized water are shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). The SEM images and optical images for the pure AgNW and MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite films are exhibited in Fig. S5 (ESI†). In the case of the pure AgNW sample, a rapid increase of Rs is observed with the increasing ultrasonication time in deionized water and the film is significantly deteriorated as shown in the SEM and optical images. The Rs of the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite film is slightly increased with the ultrasonication time and the film morphology does not change obviously after 30 min of ultrasonication. This indicates that the colloidal SnO2 has formed a solid film after annealing which is robust to protect the embedded AgNWs.
Both the AgNWs:SnO2 composite (3-layer) and the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite (3-layer) films are used as the transparent bottom electrodes to fabricate the PSCs. The devices have a structure of glass substrate/transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode (without or with MEA modification)/active layer/MoOx/Al as shown in Fig. 4. The PM6 and N3 are used as the active materials and their chemical structures as well as energy levels are also given in Fig. 4(a). The illuminated J–V curves of the PSCs based on the two transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrodes are plotted in Fig. 4(b) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The device based on the transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode attains a JSC of 23.75 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.84 V and a FF of 60.18%, leading to an overall PCE of 12.03%. When the transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode is modified with MEA, the resultant device demonstrates enhanced photovoltaic performance with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 24.45 mA cm−2, a FF of 64.79% and a PCE of 13.51%. The enhancement of PCE is mainly attributed to the increase of JSC and FF compared with the device employing the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two devices are plotted in Fig. 4(c). The device employing the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode shows a slightly increased EQE in 400–950 nm as compared to the control device based on the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode. The calculated JSC from the EQE is in agreement with the measured results with an error of less than 5%.

The inverse photocurrent–effective voltage curves and the dependence of VOC and JSC on the illuminated light intensity were further studied to get insights into the charge recombination and charge collection status in the two kinds of devices. The relationship between photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) is shown in Fig. 5(a). Jph is the difference between the illuminated current density and dark current density. Veff is the applied voltage corrected by V0 at which Jph is zero. The photo-generated free charges are assumed to be collected by the respective electrodes at a Veff of 2 V, and thus the saturated current density (Jsat) is achieved.30 It is seen that the device based on the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode has a larger photocurrent than the control device employing the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode at a low Veff region, implying its improved charge collection. The calculated charge collection probabilities by Jph/Jsat are 89.9% and 93.5% for the devices employing the AgNWs:SnO2 composite and MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrodes, respectively. The dependence of VOC and JSC on the illuminated light intensity for the two devices is studied. The illuminated light intensity is varied from 15 to 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 5(b) shows the VOC dependence on the illuminated light intensity for the two devices using the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode and the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode, respectively. The slope of VOCversus ln(I) is close to kT/q for bimolecular recombination and the slope will be equal to 2kT/e in the case of monomolecular Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination.31 The slope is about 1.41kT/q for the device employing the AgNWs:SnO2 electrode. When the transparent AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode was modified with MEA, the slope of VOCversus ln(I) is decreased to 1.03kT/q in the resultant device. It indicates that MEA modification can effectively passivate the traps or defects on the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite and can lower the trap-induced SRH recombination. The JSC can be correlated with the illuminated light intensity (I) by JSC ∝ Iα. The value of α can reflect the bimolecular recombination degree, with α being close to 1 for maximum carrier sweep out and minimum bimolecular recombination at the short circuit.32 As shown in Fig. 5(c), the α value is about 0.896 for the AgNWs:SnO2 electrode-based PSCs, while it is increased to 0.959 for the device employing the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode. It indicates that the carrier extraction is improved and the bimolecular recombination is decreased at the short circuit when the surface of the AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode is modified with MEA.

Finally, flexible PSCs were fabricated by using the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode/PET substrate. Both the transparent MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode and the PM6:N3 active layer were prepared by blade-coating. Fig. 6 shows the photovoltaic performance of the flexible PSCs based on the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode/PET substrate and the PCE changes with bending circles. The devices were bent toward the PET substrate side with a radius of 5 mm and measured after different bending circles. The flexible PSC delivers a VOC of 0.84 V, JSC of 23.44 mA cm−2 (cal. J is 22.50 mA cm−2) and FF of 66%, leading to an overall PCE of 13.00%, which is comparable to 13.51% of the device fabricated on a rigid glass substrate. The PCE of the flexible PSC employing the MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 transparent electrode is slightly decreased with the increasing bending circles. The PCE of the flexible device retains about 80% of its initial value after 500 bending cycles. This result indicates that the proposed MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode is suitable for the blade-coated fabrication of flexible PSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, a kind of solution-processed AgNW-based composite transparent electrode is prepared by blade-coating a mixture of SnO2 hydrocolloid and AgNW aqueous dispersion. The resultant AgNWs:SnO2 composite film exhibits a smooth surface morphology as the AgNW networks are well covered by colloidal SnO2 colloids. The optimized AgNWs:SnO2 transparent film attains a figure of merit of 293 with a sheet resistance of ca. 17 ohm per square and a high transmittance of ca. 92% at 550 nm. An organic solvent MEA modification is further proposed to passivate the surface defects of the AgNWs:SnO2 electrode via blade coating. Both JSC and FF are enhanced in the inverted PSCs due to the improved charge extraction and decreased defect-assisted recombination at the cathode–active layer interfaces by MEA modification. The MEA-modified AgNWs:SnO2 composite transparent electrode and the flexible PSCs exhibit superior mechanical flexibility. As the proposed AgNWs:SnO2 composite electrode and its MEA modification are compatible with blade coating, it is promising for integration with roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible PSCs.

The tin(IV) oxide colloidal dispersion (15% in H2O) was purchased from Alfa. Monoethanolamine (MEA) was purchased from ACROS. The polymer donor PM6 was obtained from Solarmer Material Inc. and electron acceptor N3 was purchased from Yirou Photovoltaic Technology Co. Ltd. All the materials and solvents were used without further purification.
AgNW-based transparent electrode and photovoltaic device fabrication
The initial AgNW dispersion was diluted to 10 mg mL−1 with deionized water. The tin(IV) oxide colloidal dispersion was diluted to 7.5% and was added to the AgNW ink. The final concentration of AgNWs was kept at 7 mg mL−1 and the concentration of the tin(IV) oxide was kept at 2.25%. The glass and PET substrates were cleaned with alcohol and deionized water. The AgNWs:SnO2 composite ink was added dropwise on the pre-cleaned glass or PET substrates and blade-coated at a speed of 10 mm s−1. The temperature of the blade-coating plate was controlled at 85 °C. The blade-coating process is repeated 1–5 times to produce the AgNWs:SnO2 layer with different thicknesses. The AgNWs:SnO2 composite films were used directly or subjected to further MEA surface modification before use. The MEA was dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 10% (v/v) and was stirred at 60 °C for 2 hours. The MEA solution was blade-coated on the AgNWs:SnO2 composite films at a speed of 15 mm s−1 and at a substrate temperature of 85 °C. Finally, all the samples were annealed at 130 °C for 10 min.
A blend of PM6:N3 (1:1.2 in weight) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with a total concentration of 17.6 mg mL−1 and the solution was stirred at 45 °C for 2 hours. 0.5% (v/v) chloronaphthalene (CN) was added into the solution before use. The PM6:N3 active layer was prepared by spin-coating (1300 rpm, 60 s) or blade-coating (50 mm s−1, the gap between the blade and substrate was 100 µm, and the substrate temperature is 80 °C). The samples were annealed at 90 °C for 10 min. The MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) anode was thermally deposited in sequence in a vacuum chamber to complete device fabrication. Both rigid and flexible PSCs have an active area of 12.56 mm2.
Measurement and characterization
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The transmittance spectra were recorded using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer). The sheet resistance of the AgNW-based composite films was measured using a four-probe square resistance instrument (KDY-1 Kundekj Co., Ltd). The AFM images were obtained using an SPI3800N AFM instrument (Seiko Instrument Inc.) in tapping mode. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained using a Philips XL-30 ESEM FEG SEM FEI. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source meter when the devices were illuminated under an AM 1.5 G solar simulator (100 mW cm−2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured using a spectral response measurement system (Enlitech QE-R).
