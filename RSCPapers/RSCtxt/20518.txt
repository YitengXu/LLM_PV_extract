1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been recognized as a promising technology to produce hydrogen fuel with high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) energy conversion. The typical PEC cell usually consists of a photoelectrode, electrolyte and counter electrode.1–3 Ideal PEC electrodes are a synergistic combination of photoabsorbers, co-catalysts and protection layers.4–6 Photoabsorbers can generate electron–hole pairs under light illumination and co-catalysts accelerate the electrode surface water splitting reactions. Protection layers are usually needed for photoelectrodes to ensure a stable PEC performance. Besides ensuring the stability of photoelectrodes, researchers aim to achieve excellent photoelectrodes with high STH conversion efficiencies, for example, by preparing relatively narrow bandgap semiconductors for broad sunlight absorption,7–9 constructing semiconductor/cocatalyst electrodes or semiconductors with heterojunctions for efficient utilization of generated charge carriers,10–12 and carrying out substantial research on interface engineering in composite electrodes.13–15 Although some process has been made in fabrication of photoelectrodes, the STH efficiency in PEC cells at the current level still cannot satisfy practical requirements. In preceding works, the operating environment of photoelectrodes in PEC cells was usually ignored, which means that the study of photoelectrodes occurred only under some special conditions. As a result, the very fundamental issues of the diffusion, drift and reaction of charge carriers in the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface have not been clearly understood. Therefore, some innovative points of view on the interrelation of the photochemical environment, photoelectrodes and charge transfer need to be explored in the delicate PEC cell system.
The photochemical environment has a profound impact on the diffusion and drift of charge carriers, and the surface kinetics of the redox reaction in photoelectrodes.16,17 For instance, the band bending of BiVO4 photoanodes is closely related to the redox potential in electrolytes and the surfaces become more negative because of the deprotonating process in high pH value electrolytes.18,19 Light direction determines the initial distribution of charge carriers and charge collection probability in Si photoelectrodes.20 Researchers have noticed the impact of electrolytes or light direction on PEC water splitting behaviors. The STH conversion efficiency of the lead−titanium oxyfluoride anode in a pH = 13 electrolyte is superior to that in low pH value electrolytes;21 the photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 under front illumination is 1.87 times higher than that under back illumination (0.4 vs. 0.75 mA cm−1 at 0.4 V).22 However, not all materials show similar regulation; for example, the graphitic carbon nitride photoanode exhibits a diverse PEC performance with different pH electrolytes or light directions.23 Consequently, the characteristics of the operating photochemical environment play a non-negligible role in the PEC behavior of semiconductors.
In this work, the effect of the chemical and photic environments on photoanodes in the PEC water splitting system is rationally discussed to clarify the migration characteristics of charge carriers. TiO2 (with a long minority carrier diffusion length, valence band at 3.0 eV and conduction band at −0.1 eV vs. NHE;24–26) and Ti doped α-Fe2O3 (with a short minority carrier diffusion length, valence band at 2.3 eV and conduction band at 0.2 eV vs. NHE27–29) as the representation of two types of semiconductors were fabricated as two photoanodes. A combined study of the potential distribution and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that the low redox potential of electrolytes facilitates the charge transfer by enlarging the depletion layer and surface charge utilization. A light direction study of TiO2 and Fe2O3 indicates that the optimum thickness of semiconductors in photoelectrodes is the length of the depletion layer plus diffusion layer. Therefore, this research throws new light on understanding the PEC process from a system environment perspective, providing references to design and fabricate photoelectrodes according to the photochemical environment and characteristics of selected semiconductors.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the TiO2 photoanode
The TiO2 photoanode was prepared on a treated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate by a hydrothermal method.30 The FTO-coated glass of 2 cm × 5 cm was cleaned with redistilled water and ethanol. Next, 12 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid were fully mixed with 12 mL of redistilled water. 0.34 mL of tetrabutyl titanate was slowly added to the above solution under continuous agitation. After stirring for 15 min, the mixed solution was put into a clean Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. A clean FTO substrate with the conductive surface facing down was put in the autoclave in advance. Then, the autoclave was sealed and put in the oven at 150 °C for 16 h. The TiO2 nanorods on FTO were removed and rinsed with redistilled water after natural cooling to room temperature. The TiO2 photoanode was finally obtained by annealing at 400 °C for 2 h in air.
2.2 Preparation of the Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode
Fe2O3 was obtained by annealing pre-prepared Ti-doped FeOOH arrays.31 3 mmol FeCl3·6H2O, 20 mmol NaNO3 and 10 μL titanium trichloride (TiCl3) were dissolved in 20 mL of redistilled water. The pH of the obtained solution was adjusted to 1.5 with 37% hydrochloric acid. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a clean FTO inside. The yellow Ti-doped FeOOH was obtained after the autoclave was maintained in an oven for 6 h at 100 °C. Finally, FeOOH was transformed to Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 by annealing in air at 550 °C for 2 hours and 700 °C for 10 minutes with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 in a muff furnace. The obtained Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode was denoted as Fe2O3 for simplicity.
2.3 Characterization
The morphology was investigated using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan step of 10° min−1. Solid UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were collected on an Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer. All PEC water splitting performances were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) at room temperature.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
To ensure data consistency, all results of TiO2 or Fe2O3 were tested with a consistent TiO2 or Fe2O3 photoanode sample. A series of Na2SO4–NaOH electrolytes (pH = 7, 9, 11, 11.5, 12, 13) were obtained by adding NaOH (6 M) solution to the prepared 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The illumination source used was a 150 W Xe lamp under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The obtained TiO2 or Fe2O3 photoanode as the working electrode, platinum net as counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode (if any) were installed in a quartz cell. The photocurrent was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) or linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. In the LSV curves, the potential at which the photocurrent is zero is considered as the onset potential.
The open-circuit potential of the TiO2 or Fe2O3 photoanode was measured in various electrolytes with a three-electrode cell in air. The open-circuit potential in the dark or under illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was considered steady when the variation of potential is less than 0.005 V within 100 s of the test.
The charge carrier density (Nd) can be calculated from the Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation:32–35  where C is the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, Nd is the charge carrier density, e is the elemental charge, and ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, respectively.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying an AC voltage at selected potentials with frequency ranging from 100 kHz to 1 Hz under illumination. The EIS applied bias potential was chosen according to the current–voltage curves. At −0.2 V, the peak current of TiO2 appeared in the pH = 11 and 11.5 electrolyte, which means that there was an intense ion adsorption–desorption reaction in the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. A similar phenomenon was found for Fe2O3 around 0.4 V. For this condition, it is easier to distinguish the internal and surface charge transfer resistance according to the EIS results. ZView software was used to fit the measured EIS results.
3. Results and discussion
The TiO2 and Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 (denoted as Fe2O3) samples were synthesized using previously reported methods.30,31 The vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods were grown on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with an average diameter of 100–200 nm and thickness of ∼2.0 μm (Fig. S1a†). Similarly, Fe2O3 nanorods with an average diameter of 50–100 nm and thickness of ∼1.0 μm can be seen in Fig. S1b.† The XRD patterns of TiO2 and Fe2O3 confirmed the formation of rutile TiO2 and α-Fe2O3 (Fig. S2†). In addition, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. S3.† The calculated bandgaps of the TiO2 and Fe2O3 photoanodes are ∼3.0 eV and ∼2.2 eV, respectively, which are basically consistent with the reported results.24,27 The morphology and structure of TiO2 and Fe2O3 are similar, so the different PEC behaviors of the two photoanodes under the same conditions mainly result from the intrinsic nature of semiconductors.
The redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox) as the foremost chemical environment in the PEC water splitting system was studied, which depends on two redox couples EO2/OH-and EH+/H2in aqueous electrolyte. At a certain oxygen and hydrogen pressure, Eredox is determined by the concentrate of OH− (pH value) in the electrolyte. So the PEC water splitting measurements of TiO2 (Fig. 1a) and Fe2O3 (Fig. 1b) were carried out in a series of pH value electrolytes (pH = 7, 9, 11, 11.5, 12, and 13). It was found that electrochemical water splitting could not react for TiO2 or Fe2O3 with low bias in all of the pH electrolytes in the dark. Under illumination, at a low bias of −0.2 V vs. SCE, the photocurrent density of TiO2 enhanced from 0.06 mA cm−2 to 1.44 mA cm−2 along with an increase of pH. But at high bias, TiO2 displayed a similar photocurrent density in all of the pH electrolytes (1.3–1.7 mA cm−2, 0.6 V vs. SCE, Fig. 1c). In contrast to TiO2, almost no photoresponse could be found for Fe2O3 at a low bias (<0 V vs. SCE) in the entire pH range. At a high bias of 0.6 V, photocurrent densities showed a significant increase from 0.14 mA cm−2 to 2.11 mA cm−2 with the increase of pH. Though TiO2 showed a superior PEC performance in the high pH value electrolytes, the onset potential in various pH electrolytes was around 0.2–0.3 V vs. RHE (Fig. 1d). This implies that the overpotential of the water oxidation reaction in TiO2 is similar in various pH electrolytes. The onset potential of Fe2O3 showed a significantly positive shift compared to that of TiO2 at the same pH electrolyte, but remained around 0.9–1.1 V vs. RHE in various pH electrolytes. The “oxidation peaks” of TiO2 (at −0.2 V) and Fe2O3 (at 0.4 V) appeared in the pH = 11.5 electrolyte, suggesting that there was an intense ion adsorption–desorption reaction in the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. When the scan rate was reduced to 1 mV s−1 during the photocurrent test, flat oxidation peaks could still be observed in TiO2 or Fe2O3 (Fig. S4†), implying that quick mass transfer would occur when the photocurrent density improves. In addition, the PEC performance of the two-electrode cell was tested (Fig. S5†). The behaviors of TiO2 and Fe2O3 in various pH electrolytes were similar to those tested with the three-electrode cell, which confirms that the PEC performance is indeed superior in high pH electrolytes.

To investigate the effect of the chemical environment on PEC water splitting behaviors, the open-circuit potential between the photoanode (TiO2 or Fe2O3) and reference electrode was measured in various pH electrolytes under dark and light conditions (Fig. 2a, S6 and S7,† see details in the Experimental section). If the contact potential between collector and semiconductor is not taken into account, the measured open-circuit potential (Eo) could be recognized as the gap between the quasi-Fermi level potential (Ef*) in the semiconductor and reference electrode potential. Typically, after electronic equilibrium is reached, the potential distribution in an n-type semiconductor photoanode in the pH = 7 electrolyte is shown as the orange line (Fig. 2b).36–38EC and EV were the ideal conduction band and valence band of the bulk semiconductor, respectively. A built-in electric field formed in the depletion layer, preventing the electron transfer from the photoanode to electrolyte. Meanwhile a reversed potential formed in the diffusion layer due to the diffusion of holes in terms of the concentration gradient. Consequently, the maximum potential (Em) was on the interface of the diffusion layer and depletion layer.
 Fig. 2  (a) The measured open-circuit potential values, Eo of TiO2 and Fe2O3vs. SCE in various pH electrolytes; a schematic showing the potential gradient distribution in an n-type semiconductor (b) with the pH = 7 electrolyte in the dark, (b) with pH = 13 electrolyte in the dark and (d) with pH = 7 electrolyte under illumination. 
According to the Nernst equation, Eredox drops dramatically (∼0.355 V) along with the pH enhancing from 7 to 13 in the electrolyte. In the dark, the Eo values of TiO2 almost remained unaltered (decreased from 0.018 V to −0.064 V, ∼0.082 V). Because the intrinsic charge carrier concentration and diffusion characteristics in TiO2 remained invariable, the potential gradient in the diffusion layer should be similar in various pH electrolytes. The non-correspondence results between Eo and Eredox along with the pH improvement suggest that a larger potential gap would form in the semiconductor and electrolyte interface in the pH = 13 electrolyte, making the depletion layer wider (Fig. 2c). For Fe2O3, the value of Eo in the dark decreased by ∼0.115 V (from 0.109 V to −0.006 V), which was also much smaller than the decrease of Eredox. The Eo results indicate a low Eredox resulting from the broadening of the depletion layer in TiO2 or Fe2O3, which would facilitate the separation of charge carriers. The Eo value in Fe2O3 decreased more than that in TiO2, suggesting a weak broadening of the depletion layer. Under illumination, the Eo values of TiO2 were much lower than that in the dark (Fig. 2a and Table S1†). The surface potential was mainly determined by the redox potential in the electrolyte, so photo-generated charge carriers mainly resulted from the expansion of the diffusion layer (Fig. 2d). The Eo of TiO2 decreased dramatically to −0.746 V (pH = 13), indicating the high separation efficiency of the photo-generated charge carriers in the diffusion and depletion layers. In addition, the decrease in Eo values almost matched with a pH value multiple of 0.0592 V (from −0.286 V to −0.746 V), which could be ascribed to the relatively superior transfer abilities of charge carriers in TiO2 (with a long minority carrier diffusion length). For Fe2O3 (with a short minority carrier diffusion length), the gap between Eo in light and dark was smaller than that for TiO2, suggesting that strong charge carrier recombination may have occurred in the diffusion layer, resulting in potential loss. These results demonstrate that the low Eredox of the electrolyte facilitated the charge transfer by enlarging the depletion layer in the photoanode.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were further carried out under illumination to gain insight into the effect of the chemical environment on PEC water splitting behaviors with a certain bias potential. The electrical circuit (the inset of Fig. 3) was used as a model to fit the PEC water splitting process in the photoanode:39–41R1 and C1 are models of charge transfer behavior in the internal semiconductor; R2 and C2 are the analog reactions that take place at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface; R3 represents the external solution and wire resistance.
 Fig. 3  The measured EIS results of (a) TiO2 at −0.2 V vs. SCE and (b) Fe2O3 at 0.4 V vs. SCE in various pH electrolytes under illumination. 
The measured EIS results of TiO2 in various pH electrolytes (−0.2 V was selected as the applied EIS center voltage) are shown in Fig. 3a. The fitting Nyquist plots and values are shown in Fig. S8† and Table 1, which are similar to the measured EIS results. It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent densities of TiO2 increased dramatically along with the improvement in pH values, which had an impact on the charge transfer behaviors. Particularly in the pH = 13 electrolyte, O2 bubbles could be seen at the electrode surface during the measurement (Fig. S9†). The internal charge transfer resistance (R1) increased from 15 to 450 Ω, suggesting that some bias potential was consumed to drive the charge carrier diffusion at a high pH value as the photocurrent increased. Compared with TiO2 in pH = 7 and 9, the surface reaction resistance (R2) decreased to 100 and 140 Ω at pH = 11 and 11.5, which could be attributed to the relatively quick oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics in a high concentration of OH−. Though a low Eredox of the electrolyte facilitated the OER process, quick mass transfer could result from strong polarization in the Helmholtz layer at a high photocurrent density (1.43 mA cm−2). R2 increased to 600 Ω at the pH = 13 electrolyte, indicating that the OER on the semiconductor/electrolyte interface became the rate-limiting step as against the interior charge transfer resistance. The maximal C2 at pH = 11 and 11.5 indicates a fast OH− adsorption–desorption on the TiO2 surface, which is consistent with the “oxidation peaks” in current–voltage behaviors (Fig. 1a). As the pH improves from 7 to 13, C1 decreases from 0.3 × 10−3 F to 0.1 × 10−3 F, implying the broadening of the diffusion layer.

The measured EIS results of Fe2O3 in various pH electrolytes (0.4 V was selected as the applied EIS center voltage) are shown in Fig. 3b. The fitting Nyquist plots and values are shown in Fig. S10† and Table 2. At high bias voltages (0.4 V), the displayed internal semiconductor resistance R1 (22–40 Ω) in Fe2O3 was small. The tremendously high R2 (19000 and 8600 Ω) in low pH (7 and 9) demonstrates that holes migrating to the surface almost could not drive the OER under this condition. Because of the relatively low oxidation potential of holes in Fe2O3 (valence band at ∼2.3 eV vs. NHE), the OER could only efficiently react under low Eredox (in the high pH electrolyte) or in high hole concentration conditions (in high bias). In contrast to TiO2, the smaller C1 (<0.060 × 10−3 F) could be attributed to the much inferior carrier mobility in Fe2O3. The C1 of Fe2O3 decreased from 0.060 × 10−3 to 0.014 × 10−3 F remarkably as the pH improved, indicating that serious charge recombination occurred in the diffusion layer in the low pH value electrolytes. The EIS results demonstrate that the low Eredox of the electrolyte also facilitated the charge transfer by enhancing the surface charge utilization in the PEC water splitting system.

Besides light intensity, light direction in the main photic environment can be controlled by PEC measurements. To evaluate the effect of light direction, PEC water splitting measurements were carried out in the back and front directions under AM 1.5 G illumination. Under back illumination (Fig. 4a), efficient light intensity (blue line) gradually descends from the collector side to semiconductor surface due to the absorption of light in the semiconductor. The photo-generated charge carriers are inclined to diffuse from the internal bulk region (high concentration) to the depletion layer (low concentration) in the semiconductor. Under front illumination (Fig. 4b), light intensity in the depletion layer is high, while in the collector side it is weak. Photo-generated charge carriers in the depletion layer can separate efficiently under the built-in field. The photo-generated holes close to the depletion layer tend to migrate from the interior to exterior under the diffusion effect. The holes close to the collector side migrate along with the light intensity. When equilibrium is reached, a high concentration of holes should be at the edge of the diffusion layer. If the charge recombination in transfer is not taken into account, under back illumination, all photo-generated holes can migrate to the semiconductor surface (under drift or diffusion force), while under front illumination, internal bulk region generated holes will lack driving force.
 Fig. 4  Typical light intensity and hole density distributions in a photoanode under (a) back illumination and (b) front illumination; current–voltage behaviors of (c) TiO2 and (d) Fe2O3 under back and front illumination in the pH = 7 and pH = 13 electrolytes. 
For TiO2, the photocurrent densities under back illumination were almost the same as those under front illumination at the pH = 13 electrolyte (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the photocurrent density under back illumination was 0.99 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V, which was superior to that under front illumination (0.74 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V) in the pH = 7 electrolyte. As mentioned before, the depletion layer of TiO2 in the pH = 13 (low Eredox) electrolyte was much larger than that in the pH = 7 electrolyte under illumination. It could be proposed that all bulk TiO2 located in the “valid region” (including the diffusion layer and depletion layer) in the pH = 13 electrolyte either under back or front illumination. However, due to the narrow depletion layer in the pH = 7 electrolyte, some generated holes in internal bulk TiO2 under front illumination could not efficiently migrate to the surface. For Fe2O3, photocurrent densities under front illumination were superior to those under back illumination at the pH = 7 and pH = 13 electrolytes (Fig. 4d). It could be inferred that the poor mobility of the charge carriers in Fe2O3 resulted in relatively narrow diffusion and depletion layers. Because of serious charge carrier recombination in the internal of Fe2O3, the utilization of generated charge in the depletion layer would determine the photo conversion efficiency either in the pH = 7 or pH = 13 electrolyte. Under front illumination, the intense illumination was distinct on the depletion layer side, in which the photo-generated charge carriers could separate rapidly under the built-in electric field. Therefore, the Fe2O3 photoanode displayed a superior PEC performance under front illumination. In addition, the much higher photocurrent density of Fe2O3 in the pH = 13 electrolyte than that in the pH = 7 electrolyte confirms the wide “valid region” in the low Eredox electrolyte. The results of TiO2's superior PEC performance under back illumination (compared to Fe2O3's under front illumination) were verified by the carrier concentration of TiO2 and Fe2O3 under different illumination conditions in the pH = 13 electrolyte (calculated by Mott–Schottky measurement, see details in the experimental part). The carrier concentration of TiO2 under back illumination was calculated to be 1.87 × 1018 cm−3, which was higher than 1.37 × 1018 cm−3 under front illumination (Fig. S11a†). The carrier concentration of Fe2O3 was calculated to be 1.27 × 1017 cm−3 under back illumination versus 1.76 × 1017 cm−3 under front illumination (Fig. S11b†). The above results of TiO2 and Fe2O3 under different light directions demonstrate that thin Fe2O3 and thick TiO2 are recommended in photoanode design, which is consistent with previous works on thin Fe2O3 and thick TiO2 photoanodes.42,43 For a simplex semiconductor photoanode, the optimum thickness of the semiconductor in the photoanode should be the length of the depletion layer plus diffusion layer, which is affected by the characteristics of the semiconductor and the photic and chemical environments.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the effect of the photochemical environment (including the redox potential of electrolytes and light direction) on photoanodes in PEC water splitting is discussed based on TiO2 and Fe2O3 semiconductors. It is found that the low redox potential (Eredox) of the electrolytes facilitates the charge transfer by broadening the depletion layer and the surface charge utilization in the semiconductors. The optimum thickness of the semiconductor in a photoanode should be the length of the depletion layer plus diffusion layer, and is affected by the characteristics of the semiconductor and the photic and chemical environments. This work provides references to design and fabricate photoanodes according to the photochemical environment and the characteristics of selected semiconductors. It is expected that the described analytical methods can be extended to congeneric photoelectrode construction to facilitate higher charge carrier utilization in the field of solar-to-chemical energy conversion.
