    , Accepted 23rd April 2019First published on 23rd April 2019AbstractHole transporting material (HTM) free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are one kind of promising candidates for new generation photovoltaic technology due to their superior long-term stability and low cost. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of C-PSCs is significantly lower than that of HTM-based PSCs. This is mostly due to the unexpected electron recombination happening at the interface of perovskite/carbon. Moreover, the low conductivity of the carbon electrode slows down the charge collection process and results in a low fill factor and poor PCE. To address these concerns, we firstly inserted an inorganic CuSCN HTM between the perovskite and the carbon electrode to suppress the electron recombination process. Then we used a highly conductive carbon nanotube (CNT) network to form a robust interface of CuSCN/CNT and facilitate the hole collection process. As a result, the updated CuSCN and CNT incorporated C-PSCs exhibit a VOC of 1.01 V and deliver a PCE up to 17.58% (measured in the backward scan) with pretty good reproducibility, which is the highest PCE in C-PSCs. What's more, the incorporation of CuSCN can also improve the stability of devices dramatically. The optimized device shows superior operational stability, retaining over 80% of its initial performance after 1000 h of continuous one sun illumination.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of energy conversion since first reported in 2009.1 In the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased dramatically from 3.8% to the certified PCE of 23.7%.2–9 Benefiting from the low cost, high efficiency and solution process, PSCs have become a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technology.10 It is well known that most of the high-performance PSCs (PCE > 20%) are fabricated with organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) and noble metal electrodes (Au or Ag, need to be deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation), where adoption of highly expensive organic HTMs and noble metal electrodes as back contacts significantly increases the cost of raw materials and fabrication equipment.11 This is unbeneficial to the final large-scale commercialization of PSCs, so it is necessary to develop PSCs with good long-term stability but using a simple fabrication process and low cost materials.12–14
Carbon-based materials, when used as back contacts in HTM-free PSCs, have been proved to be a class of cheap, stable, water-proof, and anticorrosive materials. Since the first report in 2013, carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) have attracted intensive academic and industrial attention due to their outstanding device stability.15–20 It's reported that C-PSCs showed excellent stability in an ambient environment, and non-encapsulated devices can retain the initial photovoltaic performance in an ambient atmosphere for over 1000 h. Besides, C-PSCs also showed good thermal stability that unsealed devices can keep over 85% of the initial performance after heating at 150 °C for 400 min.21,22 However, the PCE development of C-PSCs is significantly behind that of HTM-based PSCs that adopt noble metals as back contacts, and the highest PCE of HTM-free C-PSCs is only about 15%,23 much lower than that of HTM-based devices.20,24 The limit of PCE in C-PSCs mainly originates from the serious loss of open-circuit voltage (VOC). The VOC of HTM-free C-PSCs is about 0.8–1.0 V, while the VOC of HTM-based PSCs mainly ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 V.25–27 In theory, the VOC is determined by the equation: VOC = Efn − Efp, in which Efn refers to the electron quasi-fermi level and Efp refers to the hole quasi-fermi level. Efn depends on the interface between the electron transporting layer and the perovskite layer, and Efp is determined by the interaction of the hole transporting layer and the perovskite layer. For HTM-free C-PSCs, Efp will be determined by the interaction between the perovskite layer and the carbon electrode due to the absence of the hole transporting layer. As the Fermi level of carbon (−5.0 eV) is higher than the HOMO of organic HTMs, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) (−5.2 eV) and poly-triarylamine (PTAA) (−5.25 eV), the quasi-fermi level separation of electrons and holes will be reduced in HTM-free C-PSCs, resulting in a much lower value of VOC. In this case, inserting a HTM layer between the perovskite and the carbon electrode to suppress charge recombination is crucial for improving the VOC and PCE of C-PSCs.
Recently, HTMs such as copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and spiro-OMeTAD have been purposely incorporated into C-PSCs to improve the performance of devices.28,29 However, spiro-OMeTAD is poor in charge mobility and needs to be doped with LiTFSI additive (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide), which is sensitive to moisture and results in poor long-term stability. And the CuPc layer needs to be deposited by thermal evaporation, which is not favorable and facile like solution fabrication processes. In this case, developing a solution-processed HTM layer without the need for additive doping is more desirable to realize high PCE and good long-term operational stability of C-PSCs. Inorganic materials, such as NiOx, CuSCN, CuI, and CuOx,30–37 are well-known stable HTMs with matching valence bands to those of most of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials. Among all these inorganic HTMs, CuSCN demonstrates decent performance in both normal structure PSCs and inverted structure PSCs.38–41 Besides, CuSCN can be deposited via solution processes other than high energy-consuming thermal evaporation or spray-pyrolysis. The favorable properties of a high hole mobility of 0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, wide bandgap of 3.8 eV, and good thermal stability make CuSCN suitable for PSC application.42 Since the first report of CuSCN-based PSCs with a PCE of 6.4% in 2014, continuous research efforts have been made towards the deposition methods, annealing process and device structure. An impressive PCE over 20% with great stability was achieved by Neha and co-workers in 2017, which significantly promotes the interest of adopting CuSCN as a HTM for PSCs. So far, most of the CuSCN-based PSCs use Au electrodes as back contacts, however, it is found that interface degradation takes place at the CuSCN/Au interface. The oxidation of Au can be observed when exposing the devices to continuous illumination, resulting in a poor long-term stability. To achieve long-term operational stability, interlayers like reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were necessarily adopted to improve the interfacial contact between the CuSCN film and the Au electrode,40 making the fabrication process more complicated. In other words, Au electrodes do not seem like a good choice for the CuSCN HTM. In this case, considering that carbon is more stable than Au and may form a stable interface with CuSCN, we propose to use carbon to replace Au to fabricate CuSCN-based PSCs. Moreover, owing to the hydrophobic nature of the inorganic CuSCN, the coverage of a CuSCN layer on the perovskite should also help to improve the stability of C-PSCs.
Herein, we report C-PSCs with a normal n–i–p meso-porous structure adopting CuSCN as the HTM and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the charge collection electrode for high performance C-PSCs. A solution-processed deposition method was used to deposit the CuSCN film on top of the perovskite active layer. The crystallization process of CuSCN is controlled via a low temperature dynamic spin-coating process, which is crucial to improve the morphology of the CuSCN film. We find that optimized solution-processed deposition methods help to dramatically improve the device performance and long-term stability of C-PSCs. Moreover, the charge collection efficiency in the CuSCN/carbon interface is dramatically improved by replacing the conventional carbon black with a highly conductive CNT network. As a result, the VOC of devices was improved from 0.85 to 1.01 V, and FF was also improved from 0.60 to over 0.70, contributing to a PCE over 17% (measured in the backward scan), which is a substantial improvement for C-PSCs. More importantly, by taking advantage of the all-inorganic interface of CuSCN/CNT, we can achieve an impressively stable C-PSC, retaining around 80% of the initial performance under continuous one sun illumination for 1000 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report of high efficiency C-PSCs with over 1000 h photostability.
2. Results and discussion
First of all, HTM-free and CuSCN-based C-PSCs were fabricated for direct comparison. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the CuSCN-based C-PSC device configuration is FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/CuSCN/carbon electrode, wherein triple-cation perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 with a small amount of lead iodide excess was used as the active layer. The energy level diagram of the CuSCN incorporated device is shown in Fig. 1b. The valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of CuSCN are −5.3 eV and −1.5 eV respectively according to ref. 42. The VBM level matches well with that of the perovskite, which facilitates efficient hole transfer at the interface. Besides, the CBM of CuSCN is above that of the perovskite, which blocks unfavorable electron recombination from the conduction band of the perovskite to the carbon electrode. The incorporation of a CuSCN layer between the perovskite and carbon contributes to enhancing the charge extraction efficiency and reducing the carrier recombination at the perovskite/carbon contact. As mentioned above, the theoretical VOC of PSC devices is determined by the difference between Efn and Efp. The incorporation of CuSCN doesn't change Efn but decreases the level value of Efp. In theory, the theoretical VOC can be dramatically improved in CuSCN-based C-PSCs. To prove the above theory, one batch of C-PSCs devices with and without CuSCN were fabricated, and their performances were carefully investigated. Fig. 1c shows the typical J–V curves of devices fabricated with and without CuSCN as the HTM. When the CuSCN HTM was adopted, the VOC was dramatically improved from 0.85 to 0.99 V. The power conversion efficiency was improved from 12.25 to 15.13%, indicating that inserting CuSCN as the HTM between the perovskite and carbon is an efficient method to boost the performance of C-PSCs. The statistical data of the VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are shown in Table S1.† The average VOC improved from 0.84 to 1.00 V when adopting CuSCN, while the average PCE improved from 11.70 to 14.95%. Besides, we also observed an improvement of the average FF (from 62.33 to 68.96%). The standard deviation of FF from devices without CuSCN is 6.68%, indicating poor reproducibility for high FF devices without the HTL. Although one can obtain high FF for certain devices due to the perfect contact between the well-deposited CNTs and the perovskite, the overall level of FF is inferior.

Impedance spectroscopy was performed to investigate the role of CuSCN in the charge transfer process in C-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 1d, the charge transfer resistance was distinctly reduced from 474.1 to 237.0 Ω, indicating that the charge transfer was more efficient after the adoption of CuSCN. We note that the series resistance is reduced from 62.0 to 25.6 Ω, which is due to the better interfacial contact of perovskite/CuSCN/C. We measured the contact angles of water on different surfaces to evaluate their interface affinity. As shown in Fig. S1,† the contact angles increase from perovskite (47.66°), CuSCN (70.29°) to CNTs (126.87°). As a result, the interfacial contact of perovskite/CuSCN/C is supposed to be better than that of perovskite/CNT, which is consistent with the EIS results.
It is believed that preparing a high quality CuSCN layer on perovskite without damage to the perovskite crystals and lowering the corresponding interfacial resistance are crucial to achieve high performance C-PSCs. The film quality of CuSCN is determined by the rate of nucleation and growth during the spin-coating process. To obtain a dense CuSCN film without cracks and pinholes, a relatively fast crystallization process is desired. However, too fast crystallization will always result in defects and a rough surface morphology, so an appropriate concentration of the precursor solution is essential to adjust the crystallization rate and the as-formed film quality. For this purpose, diethyl sulfide (DES) and dipropyl sulfide (DPS) were firstly used as solvents for CuSCN in solution-processed deposition. As shown in Fig. S2,† the device based on the DPS solution shows poor performance, and this may due to the fact that DPS causes more damage to the perovskite film, so DES was chosen as the appropriate solvent for further investigation. Then CuSCN solutions with different concentrations were prepared on FTO/TiO2/perovskite substrates and characterized by AFM. As shown in Fig. S3a–e,† when 10 mg mL−1 solution was adopted, the perovskite beneath can be seen obviously through the top CuSCN layer with low surface coverage. As the precursor concentration increased to 20–30 mg mL−1, a CuSCN film with full coverage was obtained. As the precursor concentration increased to 40 and 50 mg mL−1, a rather rough CuSCN film can be seen. As known to all, a low surface coverage will cause the short circuit effect and a rough surface morphology will always result in serious interface recombination. Therefore, a CuSCN solution with a medium concentration (such as 20 mg mL−1 and 30 mg mL−1) is expected to deliver the best device performance. A relatively thin CuSCN film with full coverage and a smooth surface will distinctly improve the PCE of C-PSCs. To investigate the concentration effect of CuSCN precursor solutions on solar cell performances, CuSCN-based C-PSCs were fabricated and the performance parameters are summarized in Table S2.† The PCE increases as the concentration changes from 10 to 20 mg mL−1, and then begins to decrease when the concentration exceeds 20 mg mL−1. In other words, we have successfully prepared a high quality CuSCN HTM on top of the perovskite and achieved good device performance with the optimized precursor concentration.
To fabricate devices with high performance, the quality of the perovskite film is also essential. Fig. 2a shows the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-fabricated perovskite film, revealing a full and smooth surface coverage with large crystals. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to further characterize the surface topography details of the perovskite film. As seen in Fig. S4,† there are continuous perovskite crystals (∼500 nm) arranged one by one tightly, and the roughness (Rq) of the film is 20.2 nm, indicating a flat surface and good morphology. The SEM image in Fig. 2b shows that the as-deposited CuSCN film is pinhole-free and formed by densely packed grains. It is observed that the annealing process of CuSCN will decrease the grain size and make a smoother surface (Fig. S5†), which is helpful for deposition of the carbon electrode and forming a good contact.

(c) XRD pattern and (d) time-resolved PL decay curves of the perovskite films with (red) and without (black) CuSCN HTM layers. 
To confirm the successful deposition of CuSCN on the perovskite layer, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to examine its crystal structure. Fig. 2c exhibits the XRD patterns of perovskite films with and without CuSCN. The sharp diffraction peak of the black curve located at 14.08° was assigned to the (110) crystallographic plane of the perovskite. The red curve refers to CuSCN on the perovskite film, and no peak of β-CuSCN was observed, which may due to the fact that the CuSCN film is too thin to detect by XRD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to detect the elemental stoichiometric ratio of the as-deposited CuSCN layer. As depicted in Fig. S6 and Table S3,† the atomic ratio of Cu/S is close to 1, indicating the existence of CuSCN. Besides, it is noted that the amount of Pb is negligible, which is due to the full coverage and high quality of the CuSCN layer on the perovskite, blocking signals from the bottom perovskite layer in the XPS test. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to understand the optical properties of perovskite and perovskite/CuSCN films. As shown in Fig. S7,† the absorption intensity of the pristine perovskite is nearly the same as that of perovskite/CuSCN, indicating successful deposition of CuSCN on the perovskite without notable damage to the perovskite composition. The PL spectra of perovskite/CuSCN films exhibit an obvious PL quenching effect as compared to the perovskite film, indicating efficient charge transport at the perovskite/CuSCN interface. This process is further confirmed by the time-resolved PL decay curves (Fig. 2d), in which the PL lifetime is remarkably reduced from 24.20 ± 0.69 ns to 6.17 ± 0.22 ns.
Carbon black, graphite and their mixture are used as conventional carbon electrodes in C-PSCs.24,43–45 However, the poor conductivity of these carbon materials will limit the charge collection rate at the interface and result in low FF and PCE. Wang et al. introduced single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) into both carbon paste and perovskite to improve the cell performance, proving that choosing suitable carbon materials is beneficial for improving performance.46 Apart from SWCNTs, multi-walled carbon nanotubes also have high conductivity, reasonably low material cost and network forming capability. We turned to use multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) to replace the conventional carbon black based electrode. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the carbon black nanoparticles will pack together and form a fluffy electrode. By contrast, the CNTs can form a network because the long tube structures easily cross together (Fig. 3c and d), and the network nature is supposed to be beneficial for high conductivity and a good interface between CuSCN and the carbon electrode. To evaluate the charge transfer and collection capability at the interface of CuSCN/carbon, we measured the I–V curves of the FTO/CuSCN/CNTs and FTO/CuSCN/carbon black devices. As shown in Fig. 3e, the CNT-based device demonstrates a higher current than the carbon black-based device, implying a better charge collection effect at the CuSCN/CNT interface. Fig. 3f gives the typical J–V curves of CuSCN-based C-PSCs with CNTs and carbon black as back contacts. All parameters of JSC, VOC, and FF of the CNT-based devices are higher than those of the carbon black based devices. The device with CNTs as the back contact delivers JSC = 23.4 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.01 V, FF = 0.725 and PCE up to 17.24% while the carbon black device delivers an inferior performance of JSC = 22.4 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.97 V, FF = 0.601 and PCE of 13.09%. A slight but nonnegligible hysteresis effect is observed in our CNT-based devices, similar to other reported C-PSCs.45 As shown in Fig. S8a,† the J–V curve with the forward scan (−0.1 to 1.2 V) gives a PCE of 16.07%, while the reverse scan (1.2 to −0.1 V) gives a PCE of 14.04%, the performance variation is due to the different FF values. Moreover, the measured device shows a stabilized efficiency of 14.55% at 0.78 V for 500 s under full one sun illumination (Fig. S8b†), implying a good stabilized power output capability.

(f) J–V characteristics and (g) electrochemical impedance spectra of CuSCN-based C-PSCs with carbon black (black) and CNTs (red) as back electrodes. (h) Contact angle test result of water on the CNT surface. 
Impedance spectroscopy was also performed to evaluate the charge transport behavior of carbon black and CNT based C-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 3g, the interfacial charge transfer resistance of the CNT-based device is obviously smaller than that of the carbon black based device. The charge transfer resistance deduced from the high frequency arc in the Nyquist plot is 178.9 Ω for the CNT-based device and 327.4 Ω for the carbon black based device. As the device structures are identical except for carbon materials, the difference in charge transfer resistance is therefore ascribed to the difference of charge collection behavior at the interface. The adoption of CNTs can obviously improve the charge transfer at the interface. Besides, Fig. 3h presents the contact angle of water on CNTs, indicating the hydrophobicity of CNTs, which can protect the perovskite layer from the attack of moisture and is beneficial for improving device stability in a humid environment.
We fabricated several batches of devices to evaluate the performance reproducibility of C-PSCs with CuSCN and CNTs, and a typical cross-sectional SEM image of the most efficient devices is shown in Fig. 4a, from which we can see that the thickness of the perovskite-filled meso-TiO2 and perovskite capping layer is about 150 nm and 500 nm, respectively. It is observed that perovskite grains are parallelly stacked one-by-one, indicating well-controlled perovskite crystal growth in favor of carrier transfer in the desired Z-direction. CuSCN with a thickness of 50 nm sited between the perovskite and the CNT network electrode can be clearly observed too. The well-formed interconnected network of CNTs can also be observed from the cross-sectional SEM image, in accordance with the top view SEM image in Fig. 3d.

(a) Cross-sectional SEM image of a typical device and (b) PCE histograms of 15 devices with an average PCE of 16.62 ± 0.45%. (c) J−V curve and (d) IPCE results of the best-performing device. (e) Shelf stability results of unencapsulated devices with different cell configurations under a relative humidity of 80 ± 10%. (f) Photostability result under continuous light irradiation. 
The statistical data of 15 fabricated devices are shown in Fig. 4b. From the statistical distribution we can see that, after optimization, all of the fabricated cells have PCE exceeding 16%, showing good reproducibility for high performance C-PSCs. The average PCE is 16.62 ± 0.45%, and the maximum PCE is up to 17.58%. The statistical distribution of VOC, JSC, and FF of fabricated devices is shown in Fig. S9,† with average values of 1.00 ± 0.01 V, 23.05 ± 0.53 mA cm−2 and 72.12 ± 1.93% respectively. The J–V curve of the champion device is presented in Fig. 4c, and the JSC, VOC, and FF values obtained from the J–V curve were 23.70 mA cm−2, 1.01 V and 0.734, respectively, yielding a PCE of 17.58%. Fig. 4d presents the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the champion device, exhibiting an integrated current density of 21.02 mA cm−2, which is slightly lower than 23.7 mA cm−2 from the result of the J–V curve, possibly due to the fact that we measured IPCE using weak monochromatic light (∼2 mW cm−2) without bias white light (0.1–0.2 sun intensity). We also sent our devices to other labs to evaluate the mismatch between J–V and IPCE results, and found that the integrated JSC from IPCE was lower than that of J–V measurement (Fig. S10†), possibly due to the same reason (low intensity monochromatic light used in IPCE measurements).
Long-term stability is one of the most difficult challenges for PSCs. We firstly investigated the shelf stability of our unencapsulated C-PSCs with different device configurations and the results are shown in Fig. 4e. After storage for 100 hours under a high humidity environment (RH 85 ± 10%), the device with the structure of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/CuSCN/Au completely degrades, which can be explained by the unstable interface of CuSCN/Au. In contrast, devices with and without CuSCN as the HTM maintain over 95% and 75% of the initial value, indicating that adopting CuSCN as the HTM can also promote the device moisture stability of C-PSCs. The superior shelf stability of the device with the CuSCN/CNT interface can be explained by the hydrophobic behavior of CuSCN and CNT surfaces, as revealed by the contact angle experiment result shown in Fig. S1.† The all-inorganic interface of CuSCN/CNT is supposed to bring in improved photostability to C-PSCs, and to prove this, we exposed our devices to continuous one sun illumination and measured J–V curves every 100 hours. The evolution of PCE as a function of illumination time (Fig. 4f) indicates that the device retains over 80% of its initial performance even after 1000 hours continuous illumination, showing an impressively superior long-term stability. It needs to be pointed out that we experienced a power outage, and the light illumination was interrupted at around 800 h. We continued the test after the power supply was recovered, and the slight increase of PCE at 800 h may due to the recovery of the light fatigue effect.
3. Experimental
3.1 Materials
All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
3.2 Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glasses (NSG TEC A7) were sequentially cleaned by ultrasonication using distilled water, acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol for 15 min respectively, and then treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. A 20–30 nm TiO2 blocking layer was deposited via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C using a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75% in 2-propanol) diluted in ethanol (Fisher, Absolute, HPLC grade) (1:10, volume ratio) and oxygen as a carrier gas. To deposit the mesoporous TiO2 layer, TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 30 NRD) was firstly diluted in ethanol with a weight ratio of 1:6, and then spin-coated onto the TiO2 compact layer at a speed of 5000 rpm for 20 s with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s−1. After spin-coating, the substrate was immediately dried on a hotplate at 100 °C and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. For the Li doping of the TiO2 substrate, 50 μL LiTFSI solution in acetonitrile (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the as-fabricated TiO2 substrate at a speed of 3000 rpm with a ramp-up of 2000 rpm s−1 for 10 s, followed by another sintering step at 500 °C for 30 min. Thereafter, the substrates were transferred into a N2-filled glove box immediately for further perovskite deposition. For the deposition of the perovskite film, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing FAI (1.0 M), MABr (0.2 M) (Dyesol), PbI2 (1.1 M) (TCI), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) in a mixed solvent of 173 μL of DMSO and 692 μL of DMF (v/v = 1:4). After stirring for 1 h, 45 μL of CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO) was added to the as-prepared solution. 50 μL of the precursor solution was spin-coated in a two-step process at 1000 rpm and 5000 rpm for 10 s and 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 150 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped on the spinning substrate at 5 s before the end of the procedure. The as-prepared film was immediately annealed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 50 μL of CuSCN solution (20 mg mL−1 in diethyl sulfide) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 50 °C for 10 min. The deposition of CuSCN was carried out in a dry air filled glove box with a temperature of 20 °C and relative humidity lower than 10%. To deposit the carbon electrode, 5 mg of multi-walled carbon nanotubes or carbon black was dispersed in 1 mL chlorobenzene under ultrasonication, and then deposited on top of CuSCN by a drop-casting method.
3.3 Characterization
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) under 1 sun conditions (ABET M-SLSS solar simulator), and the light intensity was calibrated using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an infrared cutoff filter (Schott KG-5). A shadow mask with an area of 0.067 cm2 was used for an accurate determination of the device area and short-circuit current density. The IPCE test was performed on an IPCE system (Enli tech, QE-R666) in DC mode, where the monochromatic beam was supplied by a 75 W xenon lamp. SEM images were recorded using a field-emission SEM (Hitachi S-8000 scanning electron microscope). XRD measurements were performed on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker AXS). Ultraviolet visible absorption and steady-state photoluminescence spectra were acquired using a flame spectrometer (Ocean Optics) in a N2-filled glovebox. Time-resolved photoluminescence was measured using a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM, Leca TCS SP8) with a pulsed excitation laser at a wavelength of 405 nm. The surface morphology of CuSCN films spin-coated on glass and the FTO/TiO2/perovskite substrate was studied using a tapping-mode AFM on a Multimode 8 SPM system (Bruker). The resonant frequency and force constant of the cantilever were 70 kHz and 40 N m−1, respectively. The surface roughness and grain size were determined from a scan area of 1 μm2 and 5 μm2 in AFM images using Nanoscope software. XPS analysis was carried out using the Thermo Scientific Esacalab250 XPS system, with a spot size of 500 μm, pass energy of 20 eV, and energy steps of 0.05 eV.
3.4 Stability measurement
For the moisture stability test of C-PSCs, unencapsulated devices were stored in a lab with a relative humidity of 85 ± 10% at room temperature, and then J–V curves were measured every 20 hours. To conduct the photostability test, some unencapsulated devices were placed in an unclosed chamber, which was purged with continuous N2 flow. Then the devices were exposed to a LED light source with a power density of 100 mW cm−2, no cooling system was adopted to control the device temperature, and J–V curves were measured every 100 hours.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that high quality CuSCN thin films can be successfully deposited via a low temperature dynamic spin-coating process and can be used to boost the efficiency and stability of C-PSCs. The CuSCN deposition method developed in this work delivers perfect reproducibility for high performance C-PSCs. The well-matched energy alignment between the perovskite and CuSCN facilitates efficient hole transfer at the interface and suppresses charge recombination, which remarkably improves the VOC of the device. More importantly, the hydrophobicity of CuSCN is also beneficial for the improvement of moisture stability. We also use a highly conductive CNT network electrode to form an interfacial contact with the CuSCN layer and facilitate the hole collection process. The all-inorganic interface of CuSCN/CNT makes us able to achieve high performance C-PSCs with impressively good photostability, i.e., PCE up to 17.58% and operation lifetime over 1000 hours under continuous illumination. This study demonstrates that incorporation of inorganic materials like CuSCN and CNTs is helpful to further improve the performance and stability of C-PSCs, which may make C-PSCs a step closer to the market.
