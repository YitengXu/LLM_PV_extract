    , Accepted 11th July 2019First published on 12th July 2019AbstractTwo synthetic chlorophyll (Chl) derivatives named Zn-Chl and H2-Chl are examined as efficient hole-transporting layers (HTLs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3). The device structure here is ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl/H2-Chl/Ag, which employs Zn-Chl/H2-Chl as the bilayer HTL. Zn-Chl and H2-Chl show different electronic absorptions, surface morphology, hole mobilities and energy levels due to their structural differences. The bilayer HTL realizes complementary performance of the Chl in each layer. The power conversion efficiency of the PSCs based on the bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) reaches 14.1% under standard AM1.5 illumination, which is higher than that of the device with monolayer Zn-Chl (11.9%) or H2-Chl (0.16%) only. The bilayer HTL also exhibits better device stability. This is the first time that bilayer Chl has been used as a HTL in PSCs. It provides a promising method to enhance the performance of Chl-based PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively studied and rapidly grown due to the superior photoelectronic properties of perovskite materials.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has recently exceeded 24% since Miyasaka et al. reported the first paper on an organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide PSC with the PCE of 3.8%.4–10 The performance of PSCs depends not only on the properties and preparation methods of perovskites, but also on the improvement of the device configuration and the charge extraction and transfer capability of the electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and hole-transporting layers (HTLs). Therefore, HTLs are an important part of high-efficiency PSCs.11–13
So far, HTLs commonly used in PSCs with the traditional n-i-p structure (indium-doped tin oxide or fluorine-doped tin oxide/ETL/perovskite/HTL/metal electrode) are 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)14 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).15,16 However, both spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT require dopants such as lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4-tert-butylpyridine to improve their hole mobilities. Unfortunately, the strong hygroscopicity of the lithium salts is not conducive to the growth and long-term stability of perovskites, thus affecting the performance of PSCs. Furthermore, the synthetic processes of these hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are completely cumbersome, which directly increases the cost of the materials and indirectly raises the expenditure on the manufacture of PSCs. This limits the large-scale production of PSCs in industry. Hence, it is urgent to find low-cost, readily available and environmentally friendly HTMs.
Chlorophyll (Chl), as the main photosynthetic pigment, is widely distributed in nature and plays a central role in light absorption and energy/charge transfer for photosynthesis pathways.17 The optoelectronic properties of natural Chl and its synthetic derivatives (Chls) with a typical cyclic tetrapyrrole structure have been reported previously.18–20 This shows that they can form aggregates to efficiently capture sunlight and transport charge rather than their monomers. Such properties inspired Chl derivatives being applied in biosolar cells,21 organic photovoltaics,22 dye-sensitized solar cells,23–25 microbial fuel cells26 and photoelectrochemical cells,27,28 revealing the great value of Chls as light-absorbing materials for solar energy research. Lately, Chls have been used as HTLs in PSCs. Li et al. have done a lot of research about this and achieved a PCE of more than 13%.29,30 This is a big step forward in employing Chls as HTLs in PSCs. It also displays that Chls have many advantages as HTLs compared with traditional HTMs. For instance, they are rich in resources, easy to synthesize and environmentally friendly. Moreover, their absorption spectra and energy levels can be adjusted by changing the peripheral substituents and they possess good charge mobility without adding any dopants.
However, previous reports all employed monolayer Chls as the HTLs in PSCs, which led to some shortcomings, such as instability, charge recombination and insufficient hole mobility. We need to improve this inherent system to seek new ideas for high-efficiency HTLs. Therefore, in this work, we selected two kinds of Chls with different optoelectrical characteristics, zinc methyl 3-devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide-a (Zn-Chl)31 and methyl 131-deoxo-131-dicyanomethylene-pyropheophorbide-a (H2-Chl),32 and adopted them as a bilayer HTL. Herein, we measured the photovoltaic performance of bilayer Chl-based PSCs which exhibited better stability and higher PCE of 14.1% than monolayer Chl-based PSCs. In the meantime, we discuss the optoelectronic properties of each layer of the bilayer Chl and its contribution to the device performance, which was confirmed by the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of Zn-Chl and H2-Chl used in the bilayer Chl and prepared as reported.31,32 The molecular structures of Zn-Chl and H2-Chl are partially different, which regulates their roles in the bilayer HTL. Zn-Chl has a hydroxy-methyl group at the 3-position and a carbonyl group at the 13-position, while H2-Chl has a vinyl group at the 3-position and two cyano groups at the terminal of the 131-methylene moiety. In addition, Zn-Chl has a central zinc ion in its tetrapyrrole ring while H2-Chl is a free base. It is worth mentioning that the 31-hydroxy group, central metal zinc ion and 13-carbonyl group along a molecular axis are of great significance for the self-assembly of Zn-Chl to form J-aggregates.31,33 This is due to the coordination of the oxygen atom in the 31-hydroxy group with the central zinc ion, and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the 31-hydroxy and the 13-carbonyl groups, thereby forming a strong intermolecular interaction of Zn⋯O–H⋯OC.31,34

Fig. 2 shows the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-VIS-NIR) absorption spectra of Chls dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and their thin films spin-coated on glass, for which Zn-Chl is dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of THF and chloroform (CF) (4:1, v/v) due to its poor solubility and H2-Chl is dissolved in pure CF. Compared with the redmost (Qy) band absorption peak of Zn-Chl solution that appeared at 647 nm, the Qy maximum of the Zn-Chl film (735 nm) reveals an apparent red shift and broadening. This results from the J-aggregates formed by π–π stacking of Zn-Chl molecules, which would facilitate the charge transfer in the aggregates.35 Likewise, for H2-Chl, the Qy absorption peak undergoes a small extent of red shift and broadening from the solution (705 nm) to the thin film (727 nm) due to the formation of J-aggregates by intermolecular self-assembly.36 It is remarkable that the larger the red shift of the Qy band, the stronger the J-aggregation, and the state of the aggregates determines the charge transfer capability of Chls. Clearly, both Zn-Chl and H2-Chl aggregates are qualified for HTLs in PSCs, and the former is better than the latter. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectra of the bilayer films formed by spin-coating Zn-Chl and H2-Chl on the glass in sequence. The absorption spectrum appears as a superposition of two Chl absorption spectra. The detailed photoelectronic parameters of the Chls are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Zn-Chl, H2-Chl and Zn-Chl/H2-Chl thin films spin-coated on ITO. We can observe that the surfaces of the monolayer Chls (Zn-Chl and H2-Chl) have obvious pores, while bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) makes up for this shortcoming, as its surface is relatively flat and complete, which provides a favorable environment for charge transfer.

The hole mobility (μ) is one of the main parameters of HTLs in PSCs. We attained the hole mobility of these Chls using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method on the hole-only devices (ITO/MoO3/Chls/MoO3/Ag) in the dark (Fig. S2, ESI†).37,38 The hole mobility was calculated using eqn S1 (ESI†), and summarized in Table 1. The bilayer HTL has the highest hole mobility of 7.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost four times as large as that of Zn-Chl (2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and over twenty times higher than that of H2-Chl (3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). This reflects the synergy of “1 + 1 > 2”. The bilayer HTL has better hole transport capability compared to the monolayer HTLs.
To determine the effect of THF (which is used with CF for dissolving Zn-Chl) on MAPbI3 during spin-coating, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of glass/MAPbI3, glass/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl and glass/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl/H2-Chl were measured (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Obviously, the characteristic peaks of perovskite crystals can be observed in all samples and the peaks are similar to previous reports.39 Thus, the THF component in the Zn-Chl solution does not destroy the perovskite crystals. At the same time, we recorded the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectra of these samples (Fig. S3b, ESI†) and found that there is a significant absorption peak at about 725 nm which comes from Chl aggregates, indicating that Chls form J-aggregates on the surface of the perovskite layer. This is consistent with the UV-VIS-NIR transmission spectra (Fig. S3c, ESI†). In addition, it is worth mentioning that the upper layer H2-Chl does not dissolve the lower layer Zn-Chl during spin-coating which can be verified by Fig. S4 (ESI†).21
We applied the bilayer Chl as the HTL for PSCs with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/Zn-Chl/H2-Chl/Ag presented in Fig. 4a. Fig. S5 (ESI†) displays the cross-sectional SEM image of the PSCs based on the bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) or monolayer Chl (represented by Zn-Chl) without the Ag electrode. The thickness of bilayer Chl is 85 ± 7 nm, while that of monolayer Chl is 50 ± 6 nm. Fig. 4b shows the energy level diagram of the device fabricated, where the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of Chls were determined via ionization energy photoelectron yield spectroscopy (IPS) in a vacuum (Fig. S6, ESI†). Meanwhile, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were estimated using eqn (1):40 LUMO [eV] = HOMO + Eg,(1)where Eg represents the optical band gaps obtained from the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectra (Fig. 2). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Chls are listed in Table 1. H2-Chl shows a HOMO value of −5.47 eV, which does not match that of the perovskite. In addition, H2-Chl has extremely low hole mobility as stated above. These characteristics limit the performances of PSCs with monolayer H2-Chl as the HTL (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†).

Fig. 5a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs employing monolayer Chl (Zn-Chl) and bilayer Chl (Zn-Chl/H2-Chl) as HTLs under AM 1.5G illumination. Table 2 lists the relevant parameters obtained from Fig. 5a. It is clear that the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs based on bilayer Chl are superior to those based on monolayer Chl, which are mainly reflected in the apparent increase of the fill factor (FF) and the slight enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Despite a slight decrease in the short-circuit current density (Jsc), bilayer Chl still has a positive effect on the PCE. Fig. 5b displays the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) responses for these PSCs. The integral currents obtained from IPCE have the same tendency as the actually measured Jsc, that is, as a HTL, Zn-Chl gives a slightly higher value than Zn-Chl/H2-Chl. It is apparent that the falling portion of the IPCE responses in the presence of H2-Chl corresponds to the absorption spectra of H2-Chl (see Fig. 2). This indicates that there is light competition between Chls and perovskite, which is the principal consideration for the drop in Jsc of PSCs based on bilayer Chl. On the other hand, the lower HOMO energy level of H2-Chl mismatched with perovskite also hinders the transport of holes and causes the reduction of Jsc. We also checked the PSC based on monolayer Zn-Chl treated with solvent CF without H2-Chl (Fig. S8 and Table S2, ESI†), revealing that the solvent CF treatment has no effect on the photovoltaic performances.

To investigate the hole extraction abilities of monolayer and bilayer Chl as HTLs, we measured the steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite layer covered with Zn-Chl or Zn-Chl/H2-Chl (Fig. 6a). The PL signal near 770 nm is derived from the perovskite. The presence of Zn-Chl and Zn-Chl/H2-Chl on the top of perovskite greatly weakens the intensity of the PL signal at 770 nm. The quenching of the PL signal demonstrates that both Zn-Chl and Zn-Chl/H2-Chl are beneficial to the transport of holes at the interface between perovskite and HTLs. Besides, the PL signal of the device based on bilayer Chl at approximately 800 nm may be assigned to the excitation from H2-Chl. The energy level alignment in Fig. 4b reveals that the excitons generated in H2-Chl cannot be transmitted. That is, perovskite is the only contributor to the photocurrent in this system, while Chls simply transport holes as HTLs. This is consistent with the previous report.30

To further explore the causes for the improvement of performance in PSCs based on bilayer Chl, EIS was carried out on the devices of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/HTL/Ag, where the HTL was Zn-Chl or Zn-Chl/H2-Chl. Fig. 6b presents the Nyquist plots of the two devices, showing the nearly semi-circular curves close to ideal. The values fitted to the equivalent circuit are tabulated in Table S3 (ESI†). Here, Rs is the series resistance mainly related to the external wire and ITO substrate. CPE is the chemical capacitance of the system and Rrec is the interfacial recombination resistance, representing the single semi-circle observed in Fig. 6b.41,42 In general, a higher Rrec can reduce the charge recombination to achieve more efficient charge transfer.37,43 The Rrec value follows the order: Zn-Chl < Zn-Chl/H2-Chl. The bilayer Chl-based PSCs have a higher Rrec, indicating less charge recombination at the interface. Therefore, we hypothesize that the presence of H2-Chl with a lower HOMO energy level has a positive effect on impeding charge recombination and results in a larger FF and Voc, which is the main reason for the improved performance of bilayer Chl-based PSCs.
The stability of the devices using Zn-Chl and Zn-Chl/H2-Chl as HTLs at their maximum power points (MPP) under one sun illumination in air without encapsulation was also recorded.9,44,45 Fig. S9 (ESI†) reveals the normalized stability of these devices. Apparently, the bilayer Chl-based PSCs exhibited better stability than the monolayer Chl-based one in 2000 seconds, reflecting that bilayer Chl can better prevent perovskite degradation induced by water and oxygen. Once encapsulated, even better stability can be expected.
Conclusions
In summary, we prepared two Chl derivatives and successfully used them as a bilayer HTL for PSCs. The bilayer HTL maximizes the application of these two Chls and a PCE of 14.1% can be achieved. Although the introduction of H2-Chl with a lower HOMO energy level in the bilayer HTL has a negative effect on the charge extraction at the interface between perovskite and HTLs causing a decrease in Jsc, its positive effect on FF and Voc is far greater than its negative effect, which can be reasonably certified by the PL spectra, SEM images and EIS results. Apart from the increased PCE, the PSCs based on bilayer Chl possess good stability in the unpackaged state. This work provides a new idea for the research of HTLs based on Chls, namely, it is not limited to a single layer Chl, multilayer Chl can also be used as a HTL to acquire PSCs with better performance.
