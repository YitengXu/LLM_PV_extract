, Accepted 11th October 2016First published on 14th October 2016AbstractHematite (α-Fe2O3) is considered a promising material for solar water splitting but still faces the challenges of poor conductivity and slow charge transfer kinetics. This issue is normally addressed by doping along with postsynthesis thermal treatments. In order to understand how the postsynthesis thermal treatment influences doped Fe2O3, Ti doped Fe2O3 nanorod arrays were synthesized and subjected to different post annealing processes. The TiCl4 solution hydrolysis treatment for doping and the post annealing time were optimized. To understand the thermal annealing effect on the interfacial properties and photoelectrochemical performance, the structural and photoelectrochemical properties of Ti doped and undoped samples with different annealing conditions were investigated. The formation energies for Ti or Sn doping were estimated by theoretical calculation. Both our theoretical and experimental results showed that the dopant Ti was easier to incorporated into Fe2O3 than Sn and thus required less annealing time. Our results also demonstrated the significant influence of postsynthesis thermal treatment on the photoelectrochemical performance of doped Fe2O3 nanorod arrays.
Introduction
Solar energy is the richest renewable and environmentally safe alternative energy source on Earth, and hydrogen is one of the prime candidates to be a carrier for the storage and use of solar energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for hydrogen production has been considered as a promising approach to solar energy conversion.1 Since 1972,2 a lot of semiconductor materials have been introduced into the PEC process, such as TiO2,3 ZnO4 and WO3.5,6 Hematite (α-Fe2O3), a promising material due to its appropriate bandgap, non-toxicity and abundance, has drawn much attention in recent years.7 However, the application of hematite for solar water splitting is hindered by challenges of poor conductivity, high recombination rate, poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, short hole diffusion length (2–4 nm), and improper band position for unassisted water splitting.8
Ti doping has been considered as a feasible way to improve the performance of Hematite in PEC process.9–11 Gongming Wang et al.12 reported a facile method for preparing Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films by a new deposition-annealing (DA) process. The method of APCVD was used to synthesize concentration controllable and photoelectrochemically active Ti doped hematite thin films.13 As reported by Omid Zandi et al.,14 a relatively large percentage of Ti doped hematite gave rise to a combination of improved bulk properties (hole collection length) and surface properties (resurrection of the dead surface to achieve a higher water oxidation efficiency) and resulted in an enhancement of PEC water oxidation performance. It has been demonstrated that Ti doping not only increases the free carrier concentration but also increases the motilities of electrons and holes.14,15 Higher carriers' diffusion lengths were also observed in the doped samples than the intrinsic samples.16 Furthermore, Ti doping was also found capable of surface states passivation and resulting in the decrease of the electron–hole recombination rate.17 Cathodic shift of the onset potential was observed in Ti doped Fe2O3 and ascribed to suppressing of the back reaction.18 Improvement of charge-transfer rate coefficient at the surface was also observed by Glasscock et al.19 Zhong et al.20 reported that oxygen vacancies in hematite mainly affected the performance by improving the donor density, while Ti-doping might affect the performance of hematite by surface catalytic effects or more active sites for water oxidation. The insight into the mechanisms of these properties change was investigated by state-of-art techniques. For example, soft X-ray absorption spectra at the oxygen K-edge show that Ti incorporation creates new oxygen 2p-hybridized states, which overlaps with and distorts the known unoccupied Fe 3d–O 2p band of α-Fe2O3.10
Although the Ti doped Fe2O3 have been thoroughly investigated, however, the effects of Ti incorporation on its electronic and photoelectrochemical properties appear to be highly synthesis-dependent.10 To increase the Ti doping concentration, in situ solid-state reaction method was adopted to improve Ti doping concentration from 2.2% to 19.7%.21 Co-doping of Ti with other elements such as Si,22 Sn23,24 were also found increase their PEC performance.
In addition to doping, introduction of a Fe2O3:Ti/ZnFe2O4 (ref. 25) or Fe2TiO5/Fe2O3 (ref. 26) heterojunction was used to further improve the electron–hole separation. TiO2 over-layer was deposited on Fe2O3 nanosystem by ALD, which enhanced charge separation as well as the PEC performance.27 Incorporation of g-C3N4 nanoparticles into hematite significantly improved the performance due to a synergy effect at the interface of the g-C3N4 and Ti–Fe2O3, including favorable contact, matched energy band levels and enhanced charge separation.28 6-fold enhancement of photocurrent density and negative shift of photocurrent onset by 500 mV were also observed when combining Ti-doped Fe2O3 and CdS nanoparticles.29 Furthermore, surface modification30 and corrosion31 were studied to shift the flat-band potential and the photocurrent onset potential of Ti-doped α-Fe2O3 films, respectively. Surface treatment with Al3+ was found passivate the surface states and decrease the accumulation of charge at the surface of Ti doped Fe2O3.32 Surface treatment with Zn however decreased the over-potential of the water oxidation reaction of hematite due to its interfacial catalytic activity for water oxidation.33,34 Acid-treated hematite with decreased surface electron–hole recombination losses has also been reported.35 With these results in mind, one can expect that postsynthesis thermal treatments would exert a great influence on its performance, by promoting crystallinity or reducing the defect density in solution-processed nanomaterials.36,37 Here we investigated the post thermal treatment effect on Ti doped Fe2O3 nanostructures. We synthesized Fe2O3:Ti nanorod arrays for PEC water splitting by a TiCl4 solution hydrolysis method. Ti element was incorporated into Fe2O3 nanowires by post annealing. And we also optimized the TiCl4 solution hydrolysis treatment to obtain the Fe2O3:Ti structured nanorod arrays photoanode with the best PEC characteristic. As observed by Caroline Toussaint et al.,38 Ti doped hematite films with its mesostructure preserved gave a better PEC performance than comparable dense and collapsed films. In order to keep the morphology of the nanorod arrays and conductivity of the FTO glass into Fe2O3 nanorods, we used a fast annealing process at high temperature for the post annealing treatment. The annealing condition was adjusted and the structural and photoelectrochemical properties of corresponding samples were investigated to understand the thermal annealing effect on the interfacial property and the photoelectrochemical performance.
Experimental
Sythesis of Fe2O3:Ti thin films
The hematite nanowire arrays were synthesized on a FTO coated glass substrate by the hydrothermal method.39 Typically, 3.65 g (0.15 M) of ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O) and 7.65 g (1 M) of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) were dissolved in 90 mL of deionized water and added with 100 μL of HCl (12 M). This precursor was then transferred to an autoclave, sealed and kept in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The resultant thin film was rinsed with deionized water and dried in a nitrogen stream, and then it was soaked in 0.2 M TiCl4 solution with water bath at room temperature for a certain time (e.g. 24 h) to obtain the TiO2 shell structure. Both pure hematite films (without TiCl4 solution treatment, marked with “P-XX”) and Fe2O3:Ti nanowire films (with TiCl4 solution treatment, marked with “T-XX”) were firstly annealed at 550 °C for 2 h with the rate of 4.5 °C min−1 and then further annealed using a rapid thermal annealing system (RTA) in a MTI OTF-1200X tube furnace at 800 °C for different time with the rate of 13 °C s−1.
Characterization
The phases of the samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an PANalytical X'pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphologies of the thin films were observed using a JEOL JSM-7800FE scanning electron microscope (SEM). The transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, 300 kV) was used to determine the crystal structure of the samples and obtain the TEM-EDS mapping and line-scan data. The surface compositions of the samples were analyzed by X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (Axis UltraDLD, Kratos, 150 W) with monochromatic an Al Kα irradiation. The controlled Ar+ etching was conducted at voltage of 4000 V and current of 4 μA cm−2. A three-electrode cell with a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.5) as electrolyte, a Pt plate (1 cm × 2 cm) as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl solution) as the reference electrode were used for PEC measurements. A 350 W Xe lamp solar simulator (100 mW cm−2) with AM 1.5 G filter was used as the light source. The PEC results were recorded with a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation. Mott–Schottky curves were measured at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark condition. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 kHz.
Computational details
A 2 × 2 × 1 Fe2O3 supercell with an iron atom replaced by a titanium (Ti) or tin (Sn) atom was used to mimic the Ti or Sn doping conducted in our experiment, with a dopant concentration of ∼2.1%. To estimate the doping capability of these foreign elements, the formation energy was calculated with the following formula, 
Ef = E(X: Fe2O3) − E(Fe2O3) + μFe − μX.
(1)
In this formula E(X: Fe2O3) and E(Fe2O3) are the electronic energies of the Fe2O3 supercell with and without a dopant in the neutral state. μFe and μX are the chemical potentials of Fe and dopant elements, of which the method to determine the chemical potential was given in detail in our previous paper.40 The key point is to prevent dopant Ti and Sn in Fe2O3 forming the secondary phases of rutile TiO2 and SnO2.
The electronic energy of pristine and doped Fe2O3 and the chemical potential of O, Fe and dopants were calculated with the ab initio code VASP. The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formalism was used to treat the exchange–correlation interaction within the framework of density functional theory. The Coulomb correction (U = 5 eV, J = 1 eV) among Fe 3d electrons was introduced to describe the strongly correlated electronic nature of Fe2O3. The projector augmented wave potential was employed to treat the electron–ion interaction. The energy cutoff of 520 eV was adopted to expand the electronic wave function, and the k-point mesh of 3 × 3 × 3 for the Brillouin zone sampling. The valence electron configurations were O 2s22p4, Fe 3d64s2, Ti 2p63d34s1 and Sn 4d105s25p2.
Results and discussion
Optimization of Fe2O3:Ti thin film synthesis
The as-prepared FeOOH nanowire arrays were soaked with TiCl4 solution and followed with rapid annealing treatment. Two different TiCl4 solution concentrations (0.2 M and 0.4 M) were used and the result showed that the sample treated with 0.2 M TiCl4 solution for 12 h generated a higher photocurrent than that treated with 0.4 M TiCl4 for 12 h as shown in Fig. S1.† Moreover, the sample exfoliated after being treated with 0.4 M TiCl4 solution for 24 h. This could be attributed to the erosion by the high acidity of the 0.4 M TiCl4 solution with an extended treatment time. It was also found that the amount of TiO2 deposited on FeOOH nanowire was less with 0.4 M TiCl4 solution due to the high acidity inhibiting the hydrolysis reaction of TiCl4. The treatment time in TiCl4 solution was then optimized in 0.2 M TiCl4 solution.
Fig. S2† shows the photocurrents of Fe2O3:Ti structured thin films with different treatment time in TiCl4 solution. The photocurrent density increased with treatment time and reached the maximum value (∼1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, ∼1.5 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl) when treatment time was 24 h. However, when the treatment time was increased to 48 h, the photocurrent density decreased significantly (∼0.7 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, ∼1.0 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl). So a long treatment time is detrimental to the photocurrent and the optimal treatment time is determined to be 24 h.
High temperature treatment is usually used to improve the photoelectrochemical properties of hematite samples. It was reported that heating treatment at ∼800 °C significantly increased the conductivity of Fe2O3 by the distortion of C3v crystal41 and diffusion of Sn from FTO into Fe2O3 rods.42,43 However the conductivity of FTO substrate usually decreased12 and thermal deformation of substrate occurred44 at such high temperature for relatively long annealing time.
To elucidate the effect of high temperature annealing time on the performance of Fe2O3:Ti samples, the as-prepared FeOOH nanowire arrays were treated with 0.2 M TiCl4 solution for 24 h and then annealed at 800 °C for different time using a rapid thermal annealing system (RTA). As shown in Fig. S3,† annealing time affected the photocurrent performance of the Fe2O3:Ti samples annealed with different time. The photocurrent density increased with the annealing time when the time was no more than 120 s, but started decreasing with the time increasing from 3 min to 10 min. At the beginning of annealing at 800 °C, the crystallinity of Fe2O3 rods increased and showed improved photocurrent. However with a prolonged annealing time (longer than 3 min), the photocurrent decreased due to the decreasing of FTO conductivity during the annealing. The conductivity of the FTO substrate decreased significantly after long time high temperature annealing. Impedance measurement of Fe2O3:Ti structured thin films with different annealing time at 800 °C were also carried out and shown in Fig. S4.† The experimental data (dotted points) were fitted (solid curves) using an equivalent circuit and shown in the inset of Fig. S4.† In this equivalent circuit model, Rs represents the series resistance combining the electrolyte, FTO and external contact for the electrochemical device. It can be found that Rs increased gradually with increase of annealing time. As there should be no change of resistance of electrolyte and external contact, the increase of Rs should originate from resistance increase of FTO substrate. The optimum annealing time for the Fe2O3:Ti samples was then determined to be 90 s. The morphological and crystal structures of Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti films were further investigated by using TEM. By comparing Fig. 1a and b, the Fe2O3 rods were covered by a uniform shell of TiO2 with a thickness of about 2 nm after TiCl4 treating. An interplanar spacing of 2.50 Å could be observed, which corresponds to the (110) planes of the rhombohedral Fe2O3. The HRTEM (inset of Fig. 1b) image of the interface area (marked by the box) in Fig. 4b reveals an interplanar lattice fringe of 2.12 Å, which could be attributed to the (121) plane of TiO2.

The TEM EDX elemental mapping data (Fig. 1c) indicated that the spatially distribution of Ti element was a little broader than that of Fe element, especially at the tip area. Fig. 1d displays the TEM EDX linear scanning results which show that the concentration of Ti element at cave area and the edge of the rod was much higher than that in other areas. The enrichment of Ti element in the holes of the rods could be a result of chemical bath method used for TiO2 deposition.
Thermal annealing effects on the performance of Fe2O3:Ti nanowire arrays
To gain insight into the mechanism of trade-off between crystallinity improvement of Fe2O3 rods, doping effect and FTO conductivity decreasing, detailed investigation of interfacial property and photoelectrochemical performance of pristine and TiCl4 treated Fe2O3 nanowires annealed with different time were conducted and discussed.
Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti electrodes annealed with 90 s or 10 min. It indicated that with a fast annealing of 90 s, both Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti nanorods showed a porous structure with 10–50 nm holes in the rods. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the TiCl4 solution treatment did not lead to a significant change of morphology. While for both Fe2O3:Ti sample and pure Fe2O3 sample annealed for 10 min, the surface became smoother to lower the surface free energy.

X-ray diffraction pattern analysis was performed to study the crystal structure of the nanowire samples with different annealing process, as shown in Fig. 3. It showed that there was little difference between pure Fe2O3 films and Fe2O3:Ti films. The strongest diffraction peak of [110] provided evidence that these nanowires grew along the [110] direction. No peak of TiO2 was observed for the Fe2O3:Ti samples which could be due to the thin thickness of the TiO2 shell that was not detectable for XRD measurements. For the 10 min annealed samples, the intensities of SnO2 peaks increased while intensities of Fe2O3 peaks decreased compared to those of the 90 s annealed samples. This could be due to the annealing effect which converted the nanowires into debris by recrystallization, thereby decreasing the X-ray diffraction of (110) crystal plane.

To confirm the successful doping of Ti element into the hematite, XPS spectra of Ti doped sample after Ar+ etching (4000 V, 4 μA cm−2) for different time were recorded and shown in Fig. S5.† It was found that before etching, only peak of Ti 2p3/2 for TiO2 (458.50 eV) was detected, while after etching for 940 s, the peak of Ti 2p3/2 for Ti dopants (458.00 eV) emerged, which could be due to the exposed Ti dopants inside the hematite rods after etching.18 For sample etched for 1540 s, the peak intensity of Ti 2p3/2 for Ti dopants further increased. This result indicated that Ti was successfully incorporated into hematite nanorod by diffusion.
Fig. 4 displays the photocurrents of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti thin films annealed at 800 °C for 90 s and 10 min. For pure samples, the photocurrent density of the sample annealed for 90 s was ∼0.05 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl and didn't increase much with bias potential increasing. When the annealing time was prolonged to 10 min, the photocurrent density increased to ∼0.3 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This improvement could be ascribed to Sn doping1 from the FTO glass into the Fe2O3 rods42 during the relatively longer time annealing at high temperature. While for the case of Fe2O3:Ti thin films, different results were obtained. The photocurrent density of Fe2O3:Ti sample annealed for 90 s reached ∼1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl (almost 22 times higher than pure sample). However, with an extended annealing time of 10 min, its photocurrent density decreased sharply (to ∼0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) but it was still higher than that of pure sample annealed for 10 min. When compare the photocurrent density of the two samples annealed for 90 s, one can draw the conclusion that the TiO2 shell plays an important role in the improvement of hematite's PEC performance. The layer of TiO2 coating could reduce the negative influence by surface states of hematite.45 Such surface treatment was also used with FexSn1−xO4 as a surface passivation layer on hematite rods to improve PEC performance.46 As for the decline in photocurrent of Fe2O3:Ti sample with prolonged annealing time, there are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. One is that the conductivity of the FTO substrate decreases (the resistance of the FTO substrate increases from 22 to 167 Ω after 4 h of annealing at 700 °C)12 and the other one is that the Sn diffusing from the FTO glass into the Fe2O3 rods. We measured the resistances of bare FTO substrate before and after the high temperature annealing treatment. It was found that the resistance of the FTO increased from 15 Ω □−1 (4 cm × 1.4 cm, the long side) to 20.4 Ω □−1 after annealing at 800 °C for 90 s (with an additional heat up section for 60 s) and 78 Ω □−1 after 10 min. The increase of resistivity of FTO substrate can be due to loss of Sn by diffusion and distortion of the glass substrate upon high temperature annealing.47 In addition to the resistance increase, both Fe2O3:Ti sample and pure Fe2O3 sample showed a great change in surface morphology after 10 min annealing at 800 °C, as shown in Fig. 2. This change in nanostructure led to a decrease in specific area of the samples, which could had a marked impact on the absorption of light and charge collection pathways.7

The Mott–schottky of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti structured thin films with different annealing time at 800 °C were also measured and shown in Fig. 5. After doping with Ti element, a positive shift of flat-band potential of 0.09 V was found for the samples and a nearly two-order increase of charge carrier density was observed, with the Nd values listed in Table 1. The charge transfer process at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface was also analyzed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as shown in Fig. 6, and the equivalent circuit parameters were summarized in Table 1. The series resistance (RS) increased significantly with thermal treatment time increased for both pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti samples due to the conductivity loss of the FTO substrate. RCT1 and CPE1 are considered as internal resistance and capacitance of depletion region in the films, respectively. RCT2 and CPE2 are referred to charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface, respectively. For pure Fe2O3 samples, both RCT1 and RCT2 decreased significantly when the annealing time increased from 90 s to 10 min which could be a result of Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate. However, as for the Fe2O3:Ti samples, it was unexpected that both RCT1 and RCT2 increased with annealing time prolonged from 90 s to 10 min. This increase should be a result of TiO2 shell affecting the charge transfer inside the Fe2O3 nanowire and at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. To look into the insight of annealing effects on pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded to determine the interaction of Ti shell and Fe2O3 nanowire upon the thermal treatment (Table 2).

The stoichiometry and the electronic structure of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti thin films with different annealing time at 800 °C were determined by means of in situ XPS measurements. Fe 2p, O 1s, Sn 3d, Ti 2p core levels and valence band spectra are shown in Fig. S6.† Similarly, Fe 2p3/2 and the Fe 2p1/2 core levels for all samples were observed. More precisely, the binding energies for the Fe 2p3/2 core level and the Fe 2p1/2 showed an increase of 0.1 eV when annealing increased from 90 s to 10 min, and the Ti treatment also increased by 0.1 eV when comparing to the pure one under same annealing condition (as shown in Fig. S6a–d†). These values are consistent with typical values observed for Fe2O3 as other article reported.12 O 1s XPS spectra of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti films are presented in Fig. S6e–h.† The binding energy of O 1s line (corresponding to Fe–O bonds) is 529.89 eV for pure Fe2O3 sample and 529.79 eV for Fe2O3:Ti sample with annealing time of 90 s, this shift could be a result of Ti doping which is consistent with the reported results.12,48 The minor peaks at binding energies of 531.10 and 532.20 eV for both samples correspond to CO and C–O bonds respectively.49 By carefully examination of binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 of sample Fe2O3:Ti, two binding energy peaks were obtained by fitting the Ti 2p peak. As shown in Fig. S6o,† these two peaks are at 458.39 eV and 459.26 eV. The 458.39 eV is consistent with typical values reported for Ti 2p3/2 of Ti doped hematite, while 459.26 eV can be corresponding to Ti 2p3/2 of TiO2.12,20,50 This result confirmed the successful incorporation of Ti element into Fe2O3 nanorod from the TiO2 layer. For both pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti thin films, longer annealing time increased Sn/Fe ratio which should due to Sn diffusion into Fe2O3 nanorod from the FTO substrate.42,43 The valence band of the Ti doped samples is shifted by 0.18 eV and 0.16 eV toward higher binding energies with respect to the undoped sample annealed for 90 s and 10 min, respectively, which is inconsistent with observation by Magnan et al.51
Based on the results above, one can infer that Ti is an effective doping element. With a short time of 90 s, Ti was successfully incorporated into Fe2O3, as proved by XPS and Mott–schottky results. With annealing time increasing to 10 min, the photocurrent dropped, which could be due to the deterioration of FTO conductivity. For Ti doping, only a short annealing time is needed. While Sn doping by thermal diffusion seems like requiring a longer time. With annealing time prolonged from 90 s to 10 min at 800 °C, the photocurrent of pure Fe2O3 sample further enhanced even with the deterioration of FTO conductivity, which should be ascribed to increase of Sn doping from thermal diffusion. To compare the difficulties of Ti and Sn doping, the energies of formation for the neutral Ti and Sn doping in Fe2O3 were calculated according to formula (1) and plotted as a function of oxygen chemical potential in Fig. 7. The formation energy decreased with oxygen chemical potential from −4.52 eV at O-rich condition to −7.18 eV at O-poor condition, suggesting that low oxygen pressure is preferred for incorporation of foreign elements into Fe2O3. This result agrees with the conclusion we reported previously.40 More importantly, the formation energy for Ti doping is always smaller than that for Sn doping throughout the allowed oxygen chemical potential, indicating that Ti dopant is easier to be incorporated into Fe2O3 than Sn dopant. This result well supports different behavior of thermal activation by Ti doping and Sn doping observed in this experiment.
 Fig. 7  Energy of formation for Ti and Sn doping in Fe2O3 as a function of allowed chemical potential of oxygen. Oxygen chemical potential at O-rich condition was taken as half the energy of molecular O2, while it at O-poor condition was determined when Fe2O3 transforming to Fe3O4. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, thermal annealing effect on the interfacial property of Fe2O3:Ti thin films, which were synthesized by hydrothermal and TiCl4 precursor soaking treatment, were investigated to look into the behavior of Ti doping upon postsynthesis thermal treatment to search for optimal doping strategy and procedure. The doping procedure was optimized by TiCl4 precursor concentration and soaking time. The postsynthesis annealing time were also optimized regarding their photocurrents. By carefully comparing the structural, optical and photoelectrochemical properties of pure Fe2O3 and Fe2O3:Ti thin films under different annealing time, the trade-off between crystallinity improvement of Fe2O3 nanowires, doping effect and FTO conductivity decreasing upon the annealing process was discussed. The thermal annealing facilitates the Ti incorporation through diffusion from the surface of Fe2O3 nanowires and Sn incorporation through diffusion from FTO substrate. The Ti incorporation was found require much shorter annealing time than Sn incorporation. The theoretical calculation shows that the formation energy for Ti doping is always smaller than that for Sn doping throughout the allowed oxygen chemical potential.
