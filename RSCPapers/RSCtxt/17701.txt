    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 31st October 2019AbstractMetal halide perovskites are known to possess upon photoexcitation long-lived hot carriers. By using femtosecond laser transient absorption spectroscopy, we probed in the current work interfacial charge transfer, that is, hot electrons and holes in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. The focus was, on the one hand, on titanium dioxide as an electron transporting material and, on the other hand, on several organic semiconducting materials as hole transporting materials in perovskite solar cells. An unexpected carrier loss pathway for hot electrons was found in the form of injection into the low lying LUMOs of several organic semiconducting materials. Of great importance is the fact that the final photocurrents of perovskite solar cells scale with the suppression of this newly discovered loss pathway.
1. Introduction
Ever since the emergence of lead halide perovskites as light harvesters,1 they have been widely investigated due to the perovskites’ outstanding properties for optoelectronic applications.2–4 Lead halide perovskites consist of a hybrid organic–inorganic ionic semiconductor material with a general formula ABX3. For methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI), the crystal structure is determined by the PbI6− octahedra, which have iodide anions in common. The methylammonium (CH3NH3+) cations fill the vacancies in the crystal structure.
In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Amongst others, different fabrication procedures have been exploited: one-step deposition,5 two-step deposition,6 and thermal evaporation.7 This was meant to gain control over the perovskite crystallinity. Equally important has been the focus on synthesizing and probing novel hole transporting materials (HTMs)8,9 as well as engineering and improving interfaces.10–12 At the forefront have been studies in which the well-known spiro-OMeTAD has been replaced as a HTM or the perovskite/HTM interface has been modified. Spiro-OMeTAD reveals by far the highest efficiency. But, spiro-OMeTAD entails high production costs due to difficult synthetic routes.12 Another concern is the chemical doping of the HTMs, which is required to enhance the hole mobility, imposing limitations in terms of long-term stability of the perovskite material and, in turn, the overall device.13 Currently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 24% have been realized in laboratory scale PSCs, a value which is close to that reported for silicon solar cells.14 Despite intense research activities, little consensus has, however, been reached on the working principles of PSCs. Several advanced photophysical investigations such as tetrahertz spectroscopy,15 time-resolved photoluminescence,16 and laser transient absorption spectroscopy2,17–20 have been employed to gather information regarding the modus operandi in PSCs.
In pioneering studies the properties of perovskite in its own right have been evaluated, the nature of the charge carriers, that is, excitonic vs. free charges has been tested, and the lifetime of charge carriers in terms of polaron protection,21–24 existence of hot carriers,18,25,26 and structural disorder have been rationalized.27 All of the aforementioned have been complemented by work centered around the origin of charge carrier losses and strategies to overcome them as ways to improve the device performances.28–30
In PSCs, the majority of charge carrier losses are based on radiative, non-radiative, and interfacial carrier recombinations.19,31 Our group28–30 and others32,33 have already shed light on carrier losses in full devices. Most of these studies were based on measurements on the nano- and microsecond timescales. Recently, the focus shifted to the usage of femtosecond laser transient absorption (fsTA) with emphasis on short-lived processes and charge injection kinetics.34–37
Herein, we test the charge carrier injection using fsTA in a series of semiconductors, namely (1) poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), (2) poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), and (3) poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7). All of them have been used as HTMs in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs)38–40 and have been integrated successfully into PSCs.28 But, only one of them, namely P3HT, was able to outperform solar cells built with the hole transporting spiro-OMeTAD.41 The underperformance of non-spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs is poorly understood. Some hypotheses are based on different driving forces for charge transfer,42,43 different charge mobilities,28 different molecular weights of the polymers,44etc. Nonetheless, none of these hypotheses have provided a compelling rationale.
In the current work, we demonstrate that the rates of interfacial hole transfer between photoexcited MAPI and the organic semiconductor materials do not limit the solar cell efficiency. Instead, the fate of the hot electrons in photoexcited MAPI, which are produced during the very early timescales of photoexcitation, is decisive. Most importantly, hot electrons are shown to interact with PCPDTBT. To the best of our knowledge, such a carrier loss pathway has never been identified in complete PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Film preparation
Glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with Hellmanex soap, deionized water, and finally ethanol for 15 min each. Then, for the samples containing a TiO2 layer a two-step fabrication process was employed. A dense layer of TiO2 was deposited by spin coating a solution containing 0.65 ml of titanium(IV) isopropoxide and 0.38 ml of acetylacetone in 5 ml of ethanol at 3000 rpm for 60 s under air conditions, followed by the sintering of the substrates at 500 °C for 30 min. Then, the films were immersed in titanium(IV) chloride solution (TiCl4, 40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating a commercially available TiO2 paste (30 NR-D, Dyesol) diluted in ethanol 1:5.5 (w:w) at 5000 rpm for 30 s in air. The films were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min.
The next step was the deposition of perovskite solutions, both for the films containing TiO2 and for the films containing a HTM. Perovskite was deposited by a two-step deposition method. In the first step, 1 M solution of lead iodide (PbI2, 99%) dissolved in a mixture of dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF:DMSO, 92:8 vol%) was deposited at 8000 rpm for 90 s. In the second step, a solution of 50 mg ml−1 methylammonium iodide (MAI) dissolved in isopropanol:ethanol (75:25 vol%) was deposited for 30 s before the spinning process ends. The films were annealed for 10 min at 100 °C. The spin coating conditions were chosen in order to obtain a proper thickness for fsTA measurements.
Finally, the HTMs were deposited to complete the sample. For spiro-OMeTAD (1-Material), a solution of 72 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene with the addition of 38.7 μl of tert-butylpyridine and 23.7 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (stock solution 520 mg ml−1 in acetonitrile) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds. In the case of the polymers, for thickness control purposes different concentrations were used. The concentrations were 30 mg ml−1 for PCPDTBT, 20 mg ml−1 for P3HT, and 10 mg ml−1 for PTB7 dissolved in chlorobenzene. All the solutions were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, yielding film thicknesses of 110 nm for PCPDTBT and P3HT and 90 nm for PTB7. The films were encapsulated with Meltonix 1170-60PF (Solaronix) and a cover slide on top of it in order to avoid degradation due to air exposure and humidity.
The deposition of the perovskite and HTM and encapsulation of the films were performed in a glovebox under a N2 atmosphere.
2.2 UV-Vis absorption
UV-Vis absorption measurements were directly performed on films, using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3102 PC).
2.3 Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fsTA)
695 nm excitation wavelength: fsTA experiments (295 K) were carried out with a HELIOS (Ultrafast Systems LLC) transient absorption spectrometer. The pulses from the Ti/sapphire laser system (CPA2101, Clark-MXR Inc.: 775 nm, 1.05 kHz, and 150 fs FWHM pulses) are divided into two single beams. The respective excitation wavelengths are produced by using a NOPA (NOPA Plus – Clark MXR); a laser fluence of 64 μJ cm−2 was used.
460 nm excitation wavelength: fsTA experiments (295 K) were carried out with an amplified Ti:Sapphire CPA-2110 fs laser system (Clark MXR: output 775 nm, 1 kHz, 150 fs pulse width) using transient absorption pump/probe detection systems (HELIOS, Ultrafast Systems). The 460 nm excitation wavelengths were generated with a noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA, Clark MXR); laser fluences ranging from 26 to 191 μJ cm−2 were used.
2.4 Spectroelectrochemistry
Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed in a homemade three neck cell in argon-purged solutions. A three-electrode setup was used, consisting of a platinum gauze working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a silver wire pseudo reference electrode. Potentials were applied by using a FRA 2 μAutolab Type III potentiostat from Metrohm, using the software NOVA 1.11. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Cary 5000 UV-vis/NIR spectrometer from VARIAN (PMT R928 detector (UV-vis), PbS detector (NIR), 175 to 3300 nm, double beam) and processed with Scan software from VARIAN.
2.5 X-Ray diffraction
XRD (X-ray diffraction) measurements were performed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Bragg–Brentano parafocusing geometry and vertical θ–θ goniometer) fitted with a curved graphite diffracted-beam monochromator, incident and diffracted-beam Soller slits, a 0.06° receiving slit and a scintillation counter as a detector. The angular 2θ diffraction range was between 5 and 70°. The data were collected with an angular step of 0.05° at 3 s per step and sample rotation. CuKα radiation was obtained from a copper X-ray tube operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.
2.6 Atomic force microscopy
AFM images were obtained with a Pico SPM II instrument. The images were processed with WSxM software.60
3. Results and discussion
Our MAPI films were characterized in terms of crystal structure (Fig. S1†) and morphology (Fig. S2†). Considering the absorption of 200 nm thin MAPI films (Fig. S3 and S4†), we choose 460 and 695 nm as excitation wavelengths. These wavelengths allow insights into differences which evolve upon exciting nearly resonantly with the band-gap transition into the first valence band (VB1) at 760 nm or into the second valence band (VB2) at 480 nm.45
In line with previous work, MAPI in its excited state is characterized by two ground state bleachings (GSBs) at 480 and 760 nm. These GSBs are a mirror-image of the characteristic features seen in the steady-state absorption spectra. In addition, broad photo-induced absorptions (PIAs) appear in the range between 500 and 740 nm as well as the NIR. The two GSBs are assigned to the depopulation of the two valence bands, namely VB1 and VB2, in the energy dispersion of MAPI.2,26,45–47 Different is the interpretation by Even et al., who relates the two GSBs to the R- and M-points of the perovskite reciprocal space. Photoexcitation across the visible range points to the fact that these R- and M-points correlate with the GSBs at 760 and 480 nm, respectively.48 The electron–hole pairs, which are, for example, generated at the M-point, relax into the R valley. In this study, we refer to the GSB at 480 nm as the bleaching correlated to VB2. But, the conclusions derived from this study are also applicable when considering the M-point. Regardless of the fsTA excitation wavelength, both GSBs are present in our study. Note that when we excite MAPI at an energy beyond that of VB2, namely 460 nm, the kinetics of the 480 nm GSB are much faster than those of the GSB at 760 nm (Fig. 1 and S11†). At the 480 nm GSB, the underlying kinetics (comment 1 in the ESI†) are multiexponential; the fastest component of (2.1 ± 0.4) × 1012 s−1 is due to carrier thermalization at the conduction band edge (Fig. 1).18§ Hot electrons are recorded on the timescale of sub-picoseconds and, in turn, before the GSB formation sets in. Their spectroscopic signature is a weak PIA, which maximizes at around 780 nm.18,25,49 Importantly, fsTA with 695 nm excitation lacks any detectable evidence for hot carrier signals. It is only upon 460 nm excitation that the 780 nm PIA fingerprint is discernable (Fig. 1 and S11†).

After assigning the different processes in MAPI, measurements were conducted with either an electron transporting material (ETM), namely TiO2, or with several HTMs. In terms of HTMs, we started with spiro-OMeTAD and compared the results with those of the following low band-gap semiconducting polymers, which are commercially available: PCPDTBT, P3HT, and PTB7 (Fig. 2, S4, and S5† depict the chemical structure and UV-vis spectra of the HTMs, as well as UV-Vis spectra of MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD, MAPI/PCPDTBT, MAPI/P3HT, and MAPI/PTB7 films, respectively; Fig. S6–S9† show the AFM images of the MAPI on top of spiro-OMeTAD, PCPDTBT, P3HT, and PTB7).

First, we probed MAPI (200 nm) with a 150 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer as the ETM.¶ Here, we followed the electron injection from photoexcited MAPI into the TiO2 conduction band by means of the growth of the characteristic features of TiO2 conduction band electrons in the NIR region. In this context, the 970 nm fingerprint is a great asset (Fig. 3B and S12†). Upon 460 nm excitation, the maximum is reached after 0.5 ps, from which we derive a rate of (10.0 ± 0.3) × 1011 s−1. Considering that any carrier relaxation is much slower, we ascribe the underlying process to hot electron injection.26,50

The spectral signatures of the HTM polarons evolve in the NIR region. 
After measuring the electron kinetics across the TiO2/MAPI interface, we turned to studies regarding the hole kinetics using fsTA. We placed particular focus on monitoring the HTM polarons and on deriving information regarding charge injection and carrier lifetimes.26,34,36 To establish the spectral polaron signature of the different HTMs, we carried out spectroelectrochemical measurements in chlorobenzene, in which the differential absorption changes of the oxidized HTM were recorded (Fig. S10†). Upon electrochemical oxidation, reversibly formed polaron features are noted for all HTMs in the NIR region, which are red-shifted in the fsTA measurements due to intermolecular interactions/aggregation in the thin films.
To this end, we recorded the fsTA of MAPI/HTM thin films containing spiro-OMeTAD (150 nm), PCPDTBT (110 nm), P3HT (90 nm), and PTB7 (90 nm) as HTMs by means of photoexcitation at either 460 or 695 nm (Fig. 3 and S13–S17†). Once again, these wavelengths were chosen to selectively excite MAPI, to observe VB1- and VB2-depopulation,51 and to monitor the charge transfer processes across the various MAPI/HTM interfaces. A direct comparison between MAPI and MAPI/HTM highlighted the subtle differences in the fsTA, in general, and in the NIR region, in particular (Fig. 3 and S13–S17†). At first glance, the MAPI characteristics continue to be present throughout the different timescales. A closer look reveals, however, newly developing characteristics in the NIR. Taking the bathochromic shift of aggregation upon film formation into account, these characteristics are in sound agreement with the spectroelectrochemical oxidations of the HTMs and those published in the literature.52–54 As such, the formation of polarons, which evolve as products of hole transfer from photoexcited MAPI to the HTMs, is unequivocally corroborated.
In Fig. S11–S16,† the kinetics of MAPI are compared in the absence and presence of HTMs. The corresponding charge injection rates were derived from the fast component of the HTM oxidation and are summarized in Table 1. Spiro-OMeTAD is kinetically the most efficient hole extracting material. Considering that the thermodynamic driving force for charge transfer is given by the offset between the VB of MAPI and the HOMO of the HTMs,42,55 it increases qualitatively from PCPDTBT to spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT to PTB7 (Table 1). This goes hand in hand with the hole transfer rates. Yet, the rate of hole injection is unlikely to be the key factor for efficient solar cells; PCPDTBT, for which a similar hole injection rate to that of spiro-OMeTAD is found, reveals the lowest light-to-energy conversion efficiencies in PSCs.28,56

In the following, we focused on a comparison between MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD and MAPI/PCPDTBT to gather a better understanding of the poorer HTM performance of PCPDTBT despite the kinetic conclusions.
In Fig. 4, the fsTA spectra employing 64 μJ cm−2 laser fluence are illustrated. For pump fluences ranging from 26 to 191 μJ cm−2 see Fig. S18–S28.† Important is the fact that the characteristic HTM polaron signatures are discernable regardless of the pump fluences, that is, either high or low. For example, we note PIA signals at 965 nm in the case of spiro-OMeTAD and at 905 nm in the case of PCPDTBT. We reach the important conclusion that the carrier injection and the PIA signature detection are not affected by the laser fluence. In addition, we contrasted the spectra of the three samples with a time delay of 0.5 ps (horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 4A–C) in Fig. 4D. The signals due to hot carriers, which are highlighted at 780 nm, will be discussed in depth at a later point. The dependences of the HTM polaron signal as a reflection of injected hot holes on the laser fluence for MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD and MAPI/PCPDTBT are gathered in Fig. S24.†

(d) Differential absorption spectra time delays: 0.5 ps for MAPI (black), MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD (red), and MAPI/PCPDTBT (green). Solid lines are added to highlight the PIA signals (vertical) of hot carriers (780 nm), while dashed lines are added to highlight the polarons of spiro-OMeTAD and PCPDTBT at 965 and 905 nm, respectively, as well as the time delays (horizontal) of 0.5 ps. 
Finally, we focused on the fate of the hot electrons in MAPI in the presence of the different HTMs. The 780 nm PIA, which is only observed on the early timescales, corresponds to the hot electrons in the conduction bands of MAPI. Longitudinal optical (LO) phonon emission contributes to the cooling of these hot electrons.18,25,49 By virtue of thermal relaxation at the MAPI conduction band edge the PIA transforms into a GSB.
A summary of the 780 nm PIA kinetics under 460 nm photoexcitation is presented in Fig. 6A for samples containing spiro-OMeTAD and PCPDTBT as the HTM and/or TiO2 as the ETM. For kinetics of the remaining HTMs, see Fig. S29.† Quenching of hot electrons in terms of interfacial charge transfer across the TiO2/MAPI interface is intuitive. Counterintuitive is, however, the quenching of hot electrons across the MAPI/PCPDTBT interface (Fig. S30†). Note that PCPDTBT is a HTM rather than an ETM. Implicit is a sub-picosecond competition between TiO2 and PCPDTBT to react with the hot electrons (Table S1†). Spiro-OMeTAD, with a higher LUMO than PCPDTBT, acts as an exclusive electron blocking layer and no competition is seen.

Fig. 5 summarizes how the hot electron PIA at 785 nm changes as a function of laser fluence for MAPI, TiO2/MAPI, MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD, and MAPI/PCPDTBT. The corresponding kinetics are shown in Fig. S31–34 of the ESI.† The cooling time of LO phonons is, in general, prolonged in MAPI, which is also referred to as the hot-phonon bottleneck effect.24,57 Increasing the laser intensity and, in turn, the carrier density induces Auger heating. This is likely to contribute to a further slow-down of the relaxation.57,58 Yet, as the laser fluence is varied, we noticed saturation of the rates in the high laser fluence regime (Fig. 5B). In both cases, that is, MAPI and MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD we postulate that Pauli blocking effects are operative.59
 Fig. 5  (a) The exponential (MAPI, black) and linear (TiO2/MAPI, cyan; MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD, red; and MAPI/PCPDTBT, green) increase of the PIA at 785 nm is given as a function of the laser fluence going from 2.6 to 26 μJ cm−2, with a MAPI film thickness of 100 nm. (b) The exponential (MAPI, black, and MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD, red) and linear (TiO2/MAPI, cyan, and MAPI/PCPDTBT, green) increase of the PIA at 785 nm is given as a function of the laser fluence going from 26 to 191 μJ cm−2, with a MAPI film thickness of 200 nm. The data were normalized in reference to 26 μJ cm−2. 
An entirely different behavior is found for MAPI/PCPDTBT. Here, the dependency on the laser fluence remains linear throughout the entire regime. Independent confirmation for our hypothesis came from the usage of a TiO2 mesoporous layer in the TiO2/MAPI sample to extract electrons, which resulted in the same linear dependency. The extraction of not only holes but also hot electrons by PCPDTBT reduces carrier–phonon interactions and, in turn, shifts any possible saturation to laser fluences exceeding our 191 μJ cm−2 cut-off. Such behavior requires the use of high laser intensities. Using, for example, laser fluences of 26 μJ cm−2 and less (Fig. 5A), it is solely MAPI that follows an exponential dependence, while MAPI in combination with both the ETM as well as HTMs gives rise to a linear dependence. In other words, we postulate that charge carrier injection is not only restricted to holes. At this point, we consider two scenarios: on one hand, recombination of electrons and holes may result in radiative recombination, that is, fluorescence from the polymer. The lack of any appreciable polymer fluorescence renders this scenario, however, highly unfeasible. On the other hand, electrons are back-transferred to MAPI. To corroborate the back-transfer, we monitored the 750 nm GSB. It maximizes at approximately 4 ps for spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2. If injection of hot electrons from MAPI to the different HTMs is followed by their back-transfer, the GSB maximum should emerge at time delays later than 4 ps. This is clearly substantiated in Fig. 6b and S29,† where the maximum of the decay is delayed to 9 ps for PCPDTBT and P3HT.|| A similar finding is noted at lower laser fluences, where the rise of the GSB maximum is delayed to 25 ps for MAPI/PCPDTBT compared to approximately 6–8 ps in the cases of TiO2/MAPI and MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 6c). Upon decreasing the laser fluence from 26 to 2.6 μJ cm−2, the 750 nm kinetics reflect the ambivalent charge carrier character of PCPDTBT. In particular, the corresponding time profiles of MAPI/PCPDTBT resemble the ETM kinetics, namely that of TiO2/MAPI, rather than the HTM kinetics of, for example, MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S35–S37†).
 Fig. 6  Kinetic traces from 0.1 to 100 ps obtained for MAPI (black), TiO2/MAPI (cyan), MAPI/spiro-OMeTAD (red), and MAPI/PCPDTBT (green) by means of pumping at λexc = 460 nm and detection at 780 (a), 760 nm (b and c), and 1040 nm (d) with a laser fluence of 130 (a and b) and 26 μJ cm−2 (c and d). 
Next, we analyzed the PIA kinetics at 1040 nm and a laser fluence of 26 μJ cm−2 (Fig. 6D). In the presence of an electron extracting TiO2 layer and a hole extracting spiro-OMeTAD layer we note different kinetics than in just pure MAPI. Electron and hole injection into TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, is responsible for our findings. The kinetics in the case of MAPI/PCPDTBT correlate with the presence of two charge injection processes. Early on, a lower intensity of the MAPI PIA signal relates to the electron injection into PCPDTBT. Later, the growth of polaron features of the HTM is discernable, which occurs simultaneously with the back-injection of electrons into the conduction band of MAPI. Considering that the broad absorption of MAPI originates from its multivalley conduction band48 our findings are detrimental in terms of avoiding loss processes. For example, the 0.15 eV energy difference between the MAPI CB minimum and the LUMO of PCPDTBT is compensated by the excess energy when MAPI is excited at 653 nm.
4. Conclusions
By means of fsTA we contributed towards gathering a sound picture of charge carrier transfer processes occurring across the perovskite–HTM interfaces. Hole injection, for example, occurs for organic HTMs on a timescale of up to 2 ps. For TiO2/MAPI, thermalized electrons are injected within 1–2 ps. For hot electrons, an unexpected path of transfer across the perovskite/HTM interfaces is demonstrated. Rather than being transferred fast and efficiently to TiO2, they are injected into the HTMs, where they thermally relax and are transferred back into the perovskite conduction band (Fig. 7). Recombination of holes and electrons in PCPDTBT was ruled out due to the lack of any significant fluorescence of the polymer. Hot electron injection into HTMs has, however, never been proven for PSCs. For photogenerated charge carriers this has detrimental consequences; a comparison between the overall power conversion efficiency, in general, and the photocurrent, in particular, of solar cells using HTMs other than spiro-OMeTAD reveals a lower figure of merit.28 For example, solar cells containing PCPDTBT rather than spiro-OMeTAD and PTB7 give rise to 40% and 30% lower photocurrents, respectively. This and the bright luminescence, which is seen in PCPDTBT-based PSCs as a result of electrons being injected into the HTM instead of TiO2, underscore the importance of this loss pathway. In short, for the future design of novel PSCs high LUMOs of the HTMs are imperative to avoid any unwanted loss pathways.
