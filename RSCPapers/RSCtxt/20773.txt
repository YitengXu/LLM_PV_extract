    , Accepted 31st December 2021First published on 31st December 2021AbstractNitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials for electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2ER) to CO have been extensively investigated, evaluated, and applied recently. Nevertheless, their weak adsorption capacity for CO2 usually results in a rapidly decayed CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) in the course of pursuing a commercial CO current density (jCO) by increasing the overpotential. Herein, we axially graft pyridine molecules on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes to construct a metal-free composite electrocatalyst (Py-N4CNTs-800) with enhanced CO2 affinity for CO2ER to efficiently generate CO. Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits a prominent FECO of 96% at −0.99 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) with a desirable jCO of 18.4 mA cm−2, and FECO can even be maintained above 90% in a wide electrochemical potential window (−0.79 to −1.19 V). In situ infrared spectra unambiguously indicate that grafted axial pyridine molecules can facilitate the CO2 adsorption and suppress the occurrence of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations enlighten that the introduction of pyridine molecules could dramatically stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, which effectively accelerates the reaction kinetics rate. Notably, Py-N4CNTs-800 delivers a promising jCO of 217 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V in a flow cell, showing a bright prospect of function strengthened carbon nanomaterial for industrial applications.
1. Introduction
In modern society, the massive consumption of non-renewable energy (coal, petroleum, and natural gas) inevitably increases the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing a series of severe global climate and environmental issues such as the greenhouse effect. At the same time, the electric energy generated by wind and solar energy has the characteristics of randomness, intermittence, and volatility, and cannot be fully integrated into the power grid,1 which leads to a great amount of waste of renewable energy. The use of these low-grade electrical energy to reduce CO2 to high value-added derived chemicals or fuels under mild conditions provides a promising strategy for storing renewable energy in the form of chemical energy, which is of great significance for alleviating the dual crises of energy and environment.2–4 CO2ER has set off a worldwide upsurge during the past few years, however, its industrial application is still limited by the construction of a versatile electrocatalyst with high product selectivity, considerable current density and durable stability.5
Nowadays, metal-free carbon materials, especially heteroatoms-doped (B, N, S, P, F) carbon materials,6–12 have become a hot spot owing to their low cost, thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and peculiar electron conductivity. Among the heteroatoms doped in carbon materials, the doped nitrogen atoms can controllably regulate the electronic structure and the defect degree of carbon due to its similar atomic radius to carbon atom and larger electronegativity, hence ensuring that nitrogen-doped carbon materials become the most efficient metal-free carbon materials for CO2ER.13–17 Therefore, unremitting efforts have been devoted to developing and improving the performance of nitrogen-doped carbon materials for CO2ER to generate CO, including heteroatom co-doping,18–21 morphology engineering,22–25 and increasing active nitrogen content.26–30 Despite these achievements, the industrial application of nitrogen-doped carbon materials to CO2ER still faces challenges: (i) the FECO decays rapidly at high overpotential, and shows a sharp volcanic trend; (ii) the reported jCO is usually less than 5 mA cm−2 when FECO reaches maximum value, which is difficult to meet the requirement for industrial production.31–39 These challenges can be attributed to the weak CO2 adsorption on the surface of metal-free carbon catalysts.40
Our previous work41 has certified that the axial pyridine molecules introduced onto the surface of carbon nanotubes can effectively increase the CO2 concentration on the catalyst surface. Therefore, we expect to introduce axial pyridine molecules to promote CO2ER or suppress HER on metal-free carbon catalysts, which may deliver high-performance CO2ER (excellent FECO & jCO) at high overpotentials. Herein, we graft the axial pyridine molecules onto nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes to construct an enhanced metal-free composite electrocatalyst for CO2ER and to investigate the role of grafted pyridine for CO2ER by in situ infrared spectra and DFT calculations. More specifically, the doped nitrogen within the carbon nanotubes is expected to serve as the active sites for CO2ER. The grafted axial pyridine molecules on the one hand act as co-catalyst to stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, thereby accelerating the kinetics of CO2ER; on the other hand, the introduction of axial pyridine molecules will facilitate the CO2 adsorption on the surface of the catalyst and suppress the occurrence of HER, especially at high overpotentials, ensuring a wide electrochemical window in the electrolysis. To maximize the performances of the metal-free composite catalysts, the flow cell tests are carried out. In flow cell, gas diffusion is no longer limited by the poor solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte, and the axial pyridine molecules will play a more profound role in promoting CO2 adsorption at the catalytic interface.
2. Experimental

Nafion (5 wt%) was provided by Sigma Aldrich Co., Ltd., Shanghai. N2 (99.99%) and CO2 (99.99%) were supplied by Shen Zhong Gas Co., Ltd., Shanghai. All chemicals were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of metal-free carbon catalysts

2.2.1. Oxidation of CNTs. 
Firstly, the oxidized carbon nanotubes (labeled as OCNTs) were prepared by the mixed acid ultrasonic method. Specifically, 1 g of CNTs were uniformly dispersed in a mixed solution of 94 mL HNO3, 80 mL H2SO4, and 6 mL ultrapure water under ultrasound at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by washing with deionized water several times and drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h.


2.2.2. Nitrogen-doping of OCNTs. 
800 mg melamine and 200 mg OCNTs (mass ratio of 4:1) were thoroughly grounded and mixed, followed by calcination in nitrogen atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h to obtain nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes, marked as N4CNTs-800. The synthesis process of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes with different nitrogen content and nitrogen species was the same as aforementioned steps, except that the ratio of melamine to OCNTs and the calcination temperature were accordingly adjusted. The as-prepared nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes are marked as N5CNTs-700, N5CNTs-800 and N5CNTs-900, respectively (for example, N5CNTs-700 was prepared by calcining the mixture of melamine and OCNTs with mass ratio of 5:1 at 700 °C).


2.2.3. Pyridine-grafting of N4CNTs-800 and OCNTs. 
The mature aryldiazonium salt functionalization method42 was used to chemically graft pyridine (Py) molecules on N4CNTs-800 to obtain pyridine grafted nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (labeled as Py-N4CNTs-800). Particularly, 60 mg N4CNTs-800, 240 mg 4-aminopyridine and 2 mL isoamyl nitrite were ultrasonically dispersed in 100 mL ultrapure water for 0.5 h and then refluxed at 80 °C for 15 h. The resulting product was washed in triplicated with ethyl acetate and deionized water, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The synthesis procedure of pyridine grafted OCNTs (labeled as Py-OCNTs) was the same as above, except that the OCNTs replaced N4CNTs-800.


2.2.4. Quaternization of Py-N4CNTs-800. 
Methyl iodide was applied as a methylation reagent43,44 for the quaternization of Py-N4CNTs-800. Specifically, 64 mg of Py-N4CNTs-800 and 1.1 g of methyl iodide were successively added into 15 mL acetone solution, and then vigorously stirred at 80 °C for 36 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Subsequently, the obtained solid was washed with acetone three times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to achieve the quaternization of Py-N4CNTs-800 (marked as QPy-N4CNTs-800).

2.3. Physical characterization
Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw InVia Reflex Lase Micro-Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw Plc., U.K.) equipped with a visible 532 nm argon ion laser. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was employed to evaluated the morphology of the metal-free catalysts. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) data were recorded by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were performed on a Thermos Scientific Escalab 250Xi instrument with Al Kα X-ray to analyze the elemental composition and electronic structure of the prepared catalysts. CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured by a Quadrasorb SI analyzer at room temperature. The in situ ATR-FTIR spectra were obtained by a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride detector. 40 μL of catalyst ink with a concentration of 10 mg L−1 was dripped on the gold-plated semi-cylindrical Si prism as a working electrode. A Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl (3.0 M KCl) electrode was used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. IR spectra were collected after 100 s of constant potential testing at different potentials.
2.4. Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical tests were carried out in a three-electrode H-cell where cathode and anode compartments were separated by Nafion 117 cation-exchange membranes (Fig. S1a†). The electrolysis parameters were controlled by an Autolab electrochemical workstation (Metrohm, PGSTAT 302N). Hydrophilic carbon paper (Toray, Japan) drop-coated with catalyst ink was used as a working electrode. Particularly, 3 mg of as-prepared catalyst was ultrasonically dispersed in a mixed solution of 60 μL Nafion (5 wt%) and 540 μL ethanol to obtain the catalyst ink, and then 200 μL of ink was dropped onto carbon paper to ensure that the loading of catalyst on carbon paper is 1 mg cm−2. Pt gauze (2 cm × 2 cm) and Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) electrodes were served as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. All test potentials were transformed to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by the following eqn (1): E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.2046 V + 0.0591 × pHelectrolyte(1)
The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests were performed in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolytes saturated with N2 and CO2 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Prior to potentiostatic electrolysis tests, the catholyte was saturated with CO2 at a rate of 20.0 sccm for at least 30 min. During the electrolysis, the cathode electrolyte was continuously pumped with CO2 at a flow rate of 10 sccm and magnetically stirred at a speed of 1000 rpm to enhance the mass transfer of CO2ER. After 20 min of electrolysis at each potential, the gaseous products formed in the cathode compartment were transported online to a gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC-7900) equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for quantitative analysis. In the stability test, the electrolyte was refreshed at 9.6 h to eliminate the influence of changes in electrolyte concentration during long-term electrolysis.
The flow cell (Fig. S1b†) was used to evaluate the industrialization potential of the as-synthesized metal-free carbon catalysts. The porous hydrophobic carbon paper coated with as-prepared catalysts (the catalyst loading is 1 mg cm−2, geometric area is 0.5 × 2 cm2), nickel foam and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were employed as the working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. 1 M KOH electrolyte was circulated into the cathode and anode compartments separated by an anion exchange membrane (AEM) at the flow rates of 15 mL min−1 and 25 mL min−1, respectively. CO2 entered the gas compartment with a rate of 20 sccm, and the reduction products were analyzed online by GC-7900.
2.5. Computational methods
All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) to optimize structures and energies.45,46 The exchange–correlation functional is performed within the generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerh (GGA-PBE).47 The cut-off energy of 400 eV was set to describe the electron-ion interactions. The convergence criteria of energy and force on each atom after relaxation are less than 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. The adsorption energy (Eads) can be calculated as eqn (2):48,49 Eads = Eadsorbate,slab − Eslab − Eadsorbate(2)where Eadsorbate,slab, Eslab and Eadsorbate are the total DFT energies of the adsorbate on the surface, the surface and the adsorbate itself, respectively.
Thermal and zero-point energy (zpe) corrections are further calculated by DFT-D3 to obtain the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of each fundamental step, which is determined by eqn (3): ΔG = ΔE + ΔEzpe − TΔS(3)where ΔH, ΔEzpe and ΔS are the changes of enthalpy, zero-point energy and vibrational entropy, respectively. T in each calculation step was set to 298.15 K. ΔEzpe can be obtained by vibration frequency analysis.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and composition of catalysts
The synthesis procedures of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N4CNTs-800) and pyridine-grafted nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Py-N4CNTs-800) are briefly illustrated in Fig. 1. The surface defects of the as-prepared metal-free carbon nanomaterials are evaluated by Raman spectra since the peak intensity ratio of D peak (∼1360 cm−1) to G peak (∼1597 cm−1) (ID/IG) is highly associated with the disorder or defect degree of carbon materials.50 The ID/IG values of OCNTs (1.071), N4CNTs-800 (1.090) and Py-N4CNTs-800 (1.098) increase sequentially, implying that nitrogen doping on OCNTs and grafting axial pyridine molecules on N4CNTs-800 were successful51 (Fig. 2a). XPS characterizations were performed to analyze the elemental composition and electronic structure of the metal-free catalysts. The nitrogen content of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 are 4.37% and 5.38%, respectively (listed in Table S1†). Additionally, the N 1s high resolution spectra of N4CNTs-800 (Fig. 2b) and Py-N4CNTs-800 (Fig. 2c) can be deconvoluted into four peaks at binding energies of 398.5 eV, 399.9 eV, 401.0 eV and 403.1 eV, which correspond to pyridine nitrogen, pyrrole nitrogen, graphite nitrogen and nitrogen oxides, respectively.52,53 As expected, the pyridine nitrogen content obviously increased from 2.04 at% in N4CNTs-800 to 2.86 at% in Py-N4CNTs-800, which can be attributed to the axial pyridine nitrogen grafted by the diazotization reaction. FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2d) further confirm the successful incorporation of axial pyridine molecules to the surface of N4CNTs-800. Specifically, the characteristic peak observed at approximately 818 cm−1 is assigned to the C–H bending vibration of benzene,54 certifying the existence of axial pyridine molecules. TEM images (Fig. S2a and S2b†) demonstrate that both N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 maintain the intact tubular structure of carbon nanotubes, ensuring the excellent conductivity of the as-prepared metal-free carbon materials.

3.2. Electrocatalytic performance of catalysts
The electrocatalytic activities of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 were initially evaluated by performing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in N2- and CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte (Fig. 3a). The onset potentials over N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 in CO2 atmosphere have obvious positive shift compared with N2 atmosphere, indicating that these two catalysts have catalytic activity for CO2ER. Furthermore, Py-N4CNTs-800 has a higher current density than N4CNTs-800 in CO2 atmosphere, meaning a higher catalytic activity for CO2ER. Notably, both N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibit a broad peak (around −1.0 V) in CO2 atmosphere, which indicates that the dominant reaction occurred on the cathode is likely to be CO2ER controlled by CO2 diffusion.26 Electrolysis at different potentials was carried out in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte saturated with CO2 to further clarify the catalytic performance of the modified carbon nanomaterials. CO and H2 were observed to be the only products at all applied potentials and no liquid products were detected. As shown in Fig. 3b, FECO on Py-N4CNTs-800 is remarkably enhanced than that on N4CNTs-800 at all applied potentials, which confirms that the introduction of axial pyridine molecules is conducive to the generation of CO from CO2ER. More specifically, Py-N4CNTs-800 delivers the maximum FECO of 96% at −0.99 V with a satisfying jCO of 18.4 mA cm−2, whereas N4CNTs-800 shows an inferior CO2ER performance (FECO of 94%, jCO of 16.3 mA cm−2) at the same potential. The jCO gradually increases (Fig. 3c) as the applied overpotential increases, and the jCO on Py-N4CNTs-800 can surprisingly reach 34.5 mA cm−2 at −1.39 V. Such a considerable current density is much higher than most reported metal-free carbon catalysts,7,16,17,24,26,29–37,55–59 and is even comparable to those metal catalysts60–63 (Table S2†). Furthermore, Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits high FECO (>90%) in a wide electrochemical window range from −0.79 to −1.19 V compared with those reported metal-free carbon catalysts with sharp volcanic FECO diagrams.55–59,64 FEH2 and jH2 of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 (Fig. S3†) demonstrates that the introduction of axial pyridine molecules not only markedly promotes the generation of CO, but also effectively inhibits the occurrence of HER, especially at high overpotential. The stability tests (Fig. 3d) were performed in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte saturated with CO2 at −0.99 V, where FECO reaches the maximum value. After 19.3 h of electrolysis, the FECO on Py-N4CNTs-800 dropped slightly from the initial 96% to 90%, while the FECO on N4CNTs-800 dropped from 94% to 80%, with a loss of about 14%. XPS N 1s spectra of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 after the stability test (Fig. S4†) show that the percentage of pyridine nitrogen decreased significantly, which may be due to the inevitable reduction of nitrogen during long-term electrolysis.26,65 However, it is noteworthy that the decrease of pyridine nitrogen content in Py-N4CNTs-800 is obviously weaker than that in N4CNTs-800, which ensures that Py-N4CNTs-800 has a longer life in long-term electrolysis. All the above electrochemical results manifest that Py-N4CNTs-800 is a prominent metal-free electrocatalyst for CO2ER with outstanding FECO, long-term stability and considerable current density (Table S2†).

3.3. The roles of doped nitrogen and grafted pyridine in CO2ER
Electrochemical tests suggest that N4CNTs-800 has a great potential to catalyse CO2ER to generate CO, while the OCNTs without nitrogen doping are inactive to CO2ER (Fig. S5a†), indicating that the high CO2ER activity on N4CNTs-800 is related to the doping of nitrogen atoms. To further elucidate the impact of doped nitrogen, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N5CNTs-700, N5CNTs-800, N5CNTs-900, N4CNTs-800 and N3CNTs-800) with different nitrogen types and content were prepared by adjusting the calcination temperature and the relative content of melamine. The nitrogen types and content were clarified by the XPS spectra (Fig. 4a and S6a–d†) and the electrocatalytic performances were evaluated by potentiostatic tests (Fig. S6e–4h†). Fig. 4b shows the relationship between the different nitrogen content of five samples and the jCO at −0.99 V. It is found that only the pyridine nitrogen content is positively correlated with the catalytic performance, suggesting that the doped pyridine nitrogen is the most active site for CO2 reduction though the contribution of other types nitrogen cannot be completely excluded, which is consistent with the reported conclusion.66

(c) Schematic diagram of quaternization of Py-N4CNTs-800. (d) Faradaic efficiencies of CO on Py-N4CNTs-800 and QPy-N4CNTs-800 at different potentials. 
To clarify whether the grafted axial pyridine molecules can also be served as active sites to catalyse CO2ER to generate CO, we directly grafted axial pyridine molecules on the OCNTs to obtain pyridine grafted oxidized carbon nanotubes (labelled as Py-OCNTs). Electrochemical tests show that Py-OCNTs have a poor catalytic activity for the conversion of CO2 to CO in a narrow potential range from −0.79 to −1.09 V (Fig. S5a†). Therefore, compared with N4CNTs-800, the improved catalytic performance on Py-N4CNTs-800 under high overpotential (E ≤ −1.19 V) can be attributed to the synergistic effect of grafted pyridine and doped nitrogen (Fig. S5b†). Specifically, the nitrogen doped in carbon nanotubes served as active sites to ensure the catalytic activity of the metal-free electrocatalyst for CO2ER to generate CO, while the grafted axial pyridine molecules, act as co-catalyst rather than active sites, further improve the catalytic performance of Py-N4CNTs-800 for CO2ER.
To further prove the fact that grafted axial pyridine molecules acts as a co-catalyst, quaternization of grafted pyridine nitrogen on Py-N4CNTs-800 was carried out.13 The quaternization process of Py-N4CNTs-800 is shown as Fig. 4c, and the obtained sample is marked as QPy-N4CNTs-800. A new peak at 402.06 eV corresponding to the quaternary nitrogen is detected in the N 1s XPS spectrum of QPy-N4CNTs-800 (Fig. S7a†).13,30 Moreover, the increased infrared absorption peak intensities of antisymmetric stretching vibration of methyl and methylene (2910 cm−1) and C–N stretching vibration (1107 cm−1) further prove the success of the quaternization reaction (Fig. S7b†). Fig. 4d and S8† show that QPy-N4CNTs-800 possesses lower catalytic performance for generating CO and higher catalytic activity for HER compared with Py-N4CNTs-800, which reasonably attests that grafted axial pyridine molecules as co-catalyst play an indelible role in promoting CO2ER and inhibiting HER. The CO2 adsorption capacity of QPy-N4CNTs-800 (4.88 mL g−1) also strongly verifies the ability of grafted axial pyridine molecules to enrich CO2 on the catalyst surface (Fig. S7c†).
The Tafel slopes of CO2ER on N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 were measured to evaluate the catalytic reaction kinetics. The Tafel slopes (Fig. 5a) for N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 are 298 and 218 mV dec−1, respectively, implying that the rate-limiting step of CO2ER might be the CO2 adsorption.14,36 The smaller Tafel slope of Py-N4CNTs-800 reveals that the grafted axial pyridine molecules accelerate the kinetics of CO2ER. Therefore, the CO2 adsorption isotherms at room temperature were carried out to determine the CO2 adsorption capacities of the metal-free carbon catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5b, the adsorption capacity of N4CNTs-800 (4.21 mL g−1) is almost 2.8 times that of OCNTs (1.49 mL g−1) at atmospheric pressure, manifesting that nitrogen doping obviously boosts the CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface. Previous studies have also proved that nitrogen doping can break the charge neutrality of carbon and induce charge redistribution, which is beneficial to the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules.13 Compared to the OCNTs and N4CNTs-800, the largest CO2 adsorption capacity (5.49 mL g−1) on Py-N4CNTs-800 can be ascribed to the reinforced interaction affinity by the introduction of grafted axial pyridine molecules, which is favourable for the adsorption of CO2 on metal-free catalysts.67,68

(c) In situ ATR-IR spectra of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 purged with N2 or CO2 at −1.0 V. (d) In situ ATR-IR spectra of Py-N4CNTs-800 and (e) N4CNTs-800 purged with CO2 at different potentials. 

In situ ATR-FTIR was employed to further explore the effects of grafted axial pyridine molecules in promoting CO2 adsorption and inhibiting HER. When CO2 was bubbled into 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution, a characteristic peak appeared at around 2346 cm−1 is assigned to the antisymmetric O–C–O stretching of CO2 adsorbed on the catalyst surface69,70 (Fig. 5c). Compared with N4CNTs-800, the more distinct characteristic peak of CO2 adsorption on Py-N4CNTs-800 at the same potential (−1.0 V) further confirms that the incorporation of axial pyridine molecules effectively enhances the chemical adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface and remarkably accelerates the activation of CO2.71 Moreover, the inverted peak centered at 1650 cm−1 (Fig. 5d and e) is ascribed to the consumption of surface water.72–74 It is well known that the occurrence of CO2ER is inevitably accompanied by HER, and studies have proved that the water at the catalyst surface serves as the main proton source of HER at high overpotentials.75 The intensity of the peak at 1650 cm−1 on N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 gradually increases with the negative shift of potential, indicating that the HER on the catalyst surface is continuously intensified, which perfectly corresponds to the gradual increase jH2 in potentiostatic electrolysis (Fig. S3†). The obviously suppressed water consumption peaks on Py-N4CNTs-800 compared with N4CNTs-800 indicate that the grafted axial pyridine molecules can effectively inhibit HER, especially at high overpotentials, which ensures that Py-N4CNTs-800 can maintain outstanding FECO (>90%) within a wide electrochemical window.
In summary, according to these experimental results, the nitrogen doped in carbon nanotubes provides active sites for CO2ER. The grafted axial pyridine molecules act as co-catalyst greatly facilitate the enrichment and activation of CO2 on the catalyst surface. The synergistic effect of the doped nitrogen in carbon nanotubes and the grafted axial pyridine molecules not only significantly accelerates the kinetics of CO2ER, but also effectively inhibits HER. To deeper understand the role of synergistic effect in accelerating the kinetics of CO2ER, DFT calculations with NCNT and Py-NCNT models were conducted to calculate the free energies of the following reaction steps [eqn (4)–(6)],61,76 where * denotes an adsorption site and e is an electron. CO2 (g) + * + H+ (aq) + e− → *COOH(4) *COOH + H+ (aq) + e− → *CO + H2O (l)(5) *CO → CO (g) + *(6)

Fig. 6a shows the optimized structures and calculated free energy diagram of CO2ER on NCNT and Py-NCNT. Both NCNT and Py-NCNT show a largest energy barrier (ΔG) for the formation of *COOH intermediate by the initial proton-coupled electron transfer [eqn (4)]. However, the ΔG for the formation of *COOH intermediate dramatically decreases from 0.73 to 0.58 eV by a hydrogen bond interaction between the hydrogen atom of *COOH and the nitrogen atom of pyridine. Subsequently, the protonated decomposition of *COOH to *CO [eqn (5)] and the desorption of *CO [eqn (6)] are also facilitated under the synergistic effect of the doped nitrogen in carbon nanotubes and the grafted axial pyridine molecule owing to the spontaneous process. Obviously, the presence of pyridine molecule accelerates the reaction kinetics of CO2ER to CO by forming hydrogen bonds with key intermediates *COOH (as shown in Fig. 6b), which coincides with the improved CO selectivity observed in experimental results.

3.4. Flow cell tests
In conventional H-type electrolytic cell, the low CO2 solubility in the electrolyte (<0.034 mol L−1) and slow diffusion rate of CO2 result in a poor current density, which is difficult to meet the requirement for industrial production (jCO > 200 mA cm−2).77 In recent years, the developments of gas diffusion electrodes and flow cells have efficaciously overcome the limitations of solubility and diffusion of CO2 in aqueous solutions.78,79 Studies also demonstrated that the use of alkaline electrolyte can not only inhibit the HER, but also reduce the reaction energy barrier of CO2ER, thereby improving the selectivity of CO and reducing the overpotential.80 Based on this, the flow cell tests in 1 M KOH electrolyte of N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 were performed to evaluate the role of the grafted axial pyridine molecules and the commercialization potentials of the as-prepared metal-free composite catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7a, Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits a prominent j of 240 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V, such low overpotential and considerable current density indicate that Py-N4CNTs-800 has a bright commercialization prospect. Compared with the H-type electrolytic cell, the FECO in flow cell is indeed improved as expected, for example, the FECO on N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 can reach 96.25% at −0.6 V and 98.42% at −0.7 V, respectively (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, FECO on Py-N4CNTs-800 can be maintained above 95% with the potential range from −0.41 V to −0.91 V, indicating a wide high-performance electrochemical window. In addition, as shown in Fig. 7c, Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits a prominent jCO of 217 mA cm−2 at −0.9 V, which is almost 1.6 times that on N4CNTs-800 of 131 mA cm−2 at the same potential, and this catalytic activity difference between N4CNTs-800 and Py-N4CNTs-800 in the flow cell is more obvious than that in the H-type electrolytic cell, which is consistent with our previous speculation. In H-type cell, CO2 diffuses to the catalyst surface through the electrolyte, while in flow cell, CO2 directly contacts the catalytic interface to ensure that the CO2ER is no longer limited by CO2 diffusion, but the CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface is critical to the CO2ER in this case. Therefore, Py-N4CNTs-800 has outstanding CO2ER catalytic activity in flow cell, which further proves that the grafted axial pyridine greatly facilitates the CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface and increases the CO2 concentration near the active sites. Moreover, Fig. 7d illustrates that the grafted axial pyridine molecules not only accelerate the kinetics of CO2ER, but also effectively suppress the occurrence of HER.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully constructed a metal-free composite electrocatalyst of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes grafted with axial pyridine molecules to facilitate CO2ER to generate CO with high current densities over a wide electrochemical window. The nitrogen doped in the carbon nanotubes acts as the mainly active sites for CO2ER. The adsorption isotherms of CO2 and in situ infrared spectra suggest that as a co-catalyst, the grafted axial pyridine molecules not only notably promote CO2 adsorption and accelerate the kinetics of CO2ER, but also effectively inhibit HER. DFT calculations further prove that the nitrogen atom of pyridine can form a hydrogen bond with the hydrogen atom of the key intermediate *COOH, thereby reducing the free energy of the reaction to generate *COOH and stabilizing the key intermediate. Benefiting from these merits, Py-N4CNTs-800 delivers a prominent FECO of 96% at −0.99 V with a desirable jCO of 34.5 mA cm−2 at −1.39 V, and the FECO can even be maintained above 90% in a wide potential window of −0.79 to −1.19 V. Considerable current density, high CO selectivity and durable stability of Py-N4CNTs-800 indicate that the as-prepared metal-free composite electrocatalyst is superior to most reported metal-free carbon catalysts, and is even comparable to those metal catalysts. Furthermore, the role of pyridine molecules in promoting CO2ER and inhibiting HER is amplified in the flow cell with 1 M KOH electrolyte, Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits a prominent j of 240 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V and the FECO can be maintained above 95% in the potential range from −0.41 V to −0.91 V, which shows a bright prospect to be applied as a composite metal-free electrocatalyst for CO2ER. This work has remarkable implications for the construction of high-performance metal-free electrocatalysts by introducing of co-catalysts and may provide a new idea for CO2ER industrial application.
