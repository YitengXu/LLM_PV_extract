1. Introduction
The photothermal effect is produced by light excitation, resulting in the generation of heat. This effect can be observed in some precious metals, semiconductors, carbon-based materials, and organic materials such as conjugated polymers.1 The mechanisms of photothermal conversion of different materials are usually divided into the following three categories: (i) the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, (ii) electron–hole generation and relaxation, and (iii) the conjugate or hyperconjugation effect.2 It depends on the light absorption range of the material (Fig. 1).3

In addition to metal nanomaterials, nano-scale chemical semiconductors represent other important photothermal properties, including transition metal sulfides (TMSs) and transition metal oxides. TMSs with LSPR effects have also attracted much attention because of their low cost and high PCE. Cu2−xS4 nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention since they were first reported in 2009, in which the collective oscillation of free charge carriers (holes) in the valence band led to the LSPR effect. Zhang et al.5 designed and used RuS1.7 nanoclusters to selectively target the tumor sites and effectively ablate cancer cells under NIR irradiation.
Although TMS nanoparticles demonstrated effective PTT performance for tumors under NIR light, their chemical stability and biocompatibility were poor.6 In contrast, transition metal oxides are considered more suitable photothermal materials attributed to their tunable energy bands and intrinsic thermalization processes.7 In metal oxide-based semiconductors, electron–hole pairs are generated when light wave energy approaching the bandgap energy is absorbed by the material; in narrow-bandgap semiconductors, electron–hole pairs are generated above the bandgap because most photons from the incident light have higher energy than the bandgap energy.8 These electron–hole pairs above the bandgap would then relax to the edge of the energy band and convert the extra energy into heat through the thermalization process. However, when the electron–hole pairs recombine near the bandgap edge, most of the absorbed light energy is re-emitted as photons in wide-bandgap semiconductors, resulting in a much lower PCE.1
Some organic materials also show good photothermal effects (e.g., polypyrrole and polydopamine). Zhang's group9 reported a continuously luminescent polypyrrole nanocomposite for medical imaging and PTT of breast cancer. Dong et al.10 prepared a kind of coating with shape memory function and self-repair by synthesizing polydopamine@polypyrrole nanoparticles, which exhibited high PCE. However, organic materials are generally unstable and less biocompatible.
Multidimensional carbon-based materials are widely used as solar absorbers because of their strong broadband absorption capability and improved PCE.7,11 Because of their good biocompatibility, carbon-based materials such as graphene oxide (rGO),12 carbon nanotubes,13 and other carbon-based materials14–16 have been widely investigated as excellent photothermal nanomaterials for biomedical applications. However, these materials can be tricky to use, for example, graphene has the problems of high hydrophobicity and difficult surface functionalization.17
In order to overcome the shortcomings of different photothermal materials mentioned above, researchers have been exploring new types of photothermal materials which are more suitable for medical applications. It is reported that the optical conversion efficiency of the internal structure of a Ti3C2 MXene material is as high as 100%, which has sparked significant interest among the researchers.18 MXenes refer to two-dimensional transition metal carbides (TMCs), nitrides, or carbonitrides, and are a new class of two-dimensional nano-materials obtained by etching and removing element A in a layered ceramic material MAX phase.19 The rich chemical and surface functionality endows MXenes with highly variable and tunable physicochemical properties, such as good electrical conductivity, large elastic modulus, excellent optical properties, high ionic specific capacity, and good compatibility with water and organic solvents.20 As a result, MXenes show great promise in a wide range of applications, from energy storage and conversion to electromagnetic interference shielding and adsorption, sensing, biomedicine, and environmental protection.20,21
In summary, compared to other materials, MXenes show several important advantages. First, MXenes possess strong broadband light absorption, including in the near-infrared region. Furthermore, MXenes exhibit high biocompatibility. Lastly, the surface of MXenes can be more flexibly chemically modified to optimize their performance and compatibility. To date, MXenes have been studied in many fields, but there are relatively few reports on their applications in biomedical aspects. A few studies have explored the applications in the field of PTT for tumors, while other aspects such as medical imaging and antibacterial fields have been rarely covered. Therefore, a review of the photothermal conversion of MXenes and their biomedical applications is needed. Recently, there have been some biomedical reviews about photothermal conversion of MXenes. For example, Xu et al.2 summarized the synthesis methods of MXenes and their nanocomposites, discussed their photothermal conversion mechanism, and demonstrated the progress in their photothermal applications. However, the summary of this review is not comprehensive enough. Yin et al.7 reviewed the application progress of photothermal nanomaterials in biomedical, environmental and energy fields. However, the review has not focused on MXenes. George et al.22 focused on the innovative applications of polymer-functionalized MXene composites in the biomedical field, but the photothermal conversion properties of MXenes have not been summarized. Iravani et al.23 reviewed and discussed the application and prospects of MXenes in optical medicine, but there is little discussion on MXene itself. Nashim and Parida21 reviewed a large number of applications of MXenes with rich content, but they also did not focus on the biomedical applications utilizing their photothermal conversion properties. In addition, these reviews lack a systematic summary of the future challenges of MXenes, resulting in a lack of specific and detailed discussion on the future development and prospects of this material in biomedicine. Here, this review has tried to give the first systematic summary of the biomedical applications based on the photothermal conversion properties of MXenes. First, we introduce the composition, preparation and structure of MXenes. Then, we show various applications of MXenes in four fields of biomedicine, and the corresponding roles of MXenes. Finally, we systematically clarify the existing problems of MXenes and the potential strategies to solve these problems, and put forward some suggestions for the future development of biomedical applications based on the photothermal conversion properties of MXenes. Our goal is to present an overview of the research progress in biomedical applications utilizing the photothermal conversion properties of MXenes, and we hope to provide useful information for promoting the development of this field, so as to better benefit all mankind.
2. Synthesis of MXenes
2.1. Precursor of MXenes
In 2011, Yury Gogotsi and Michel W. Barsoum et al.24 discovered and reported the first kind of MXene–Ti3C2TX, which was prepared by etching A-layer atoms in a ternary layered ceramic–MAX phase. Therefore, for a comprehensive understanding of MXenes, MAX phases should be first explored.
The MAX phase refers to a series of ternary layered compounds with molecular formula Mn+1AXn (n = 1, 2, and 3), in which M stands for pre-transition metal elements (Ti, Nb, V, Mo, Ta, Cr, Hf, Zn, and Sc). X represents carbon (C) and/or nitrogen (N), and most of the elements represented by A are elements of groups IIIA such as Al, Si, Ga, etc.19,25,26 According to the value of n, MAX can be mainly divided into 211 (M2AX1), 312 (M3AX2), and 413 (M4AX3) phases (Fig. 2a).27 From the crystal structure, the MAX phase belongs to the hexagonal crystal system, and the space group is P63/mmc.28 In addition, as the value of n increases, the properties of the MAX phase gradually approach those of the carbides or nitrides of the corresponding transition metals, but it becomes relatively difficult to prepare the MAX phase when n > 3.29,30

(b) The 413 o-MAX phase structure diagram represented by Mo2Ti2AlC3 and (c) the structure diagram of the (W2/3R1/3)2AlC i-MAX phase. General preparation procedure of Ti3C2Tx MXene. (d) The precursor MAX is first etched, then intercalated and dispersed, and finally the dispersion of MXene is obtained after washing. 
MAX phases, in addition to the generalized form of Mn+1AXn, can be designed to grow in a hybrid fashion to obtain deviated MAX phases, such as the 523-MAX phase and the 725-MAX phase.31
The MAX phase can also contain a variety of pre-transition metals, of which the MAX phase containing two pre-transition metals can be divided into a solid solution MAX phase and an ordered MAX phase. The ordered MAX phase can be further subdivided into out-of-plane ordered MAX phases (o-MAX) and in-plane ordered MAX phases (i-MAX).32
The general formula of the so-called o-MAX phases is (M′, M′′)n+1AlCn(n = 2 or 3), in which M′ and M′′ refer to two different early transition metals. Among them, the M′ layer and the M′′ layer are arranged in the middle of M–X block according to a certain rule. Different from o-MAX phases, the two early transition metals in the i-MAX phases are alternately arranged in the M layer in a certain order. For example, Mo2Ti2AlC333 (Fig. 2b) belongs to the 413 o-MAX phase. We can find that the phase is ordered, with Mo atoms mainly occupying the M' layer of the outer layer and Ti atoms occupying the M′′ layer of the inner layer. There is only one element in each layer, which alternates according to a certain rule. For the (W2/3R1/3)2AlC i-MAX phases (Fig. 2c), R represents lanthanides (Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm and Lu). These phases are found to be crystallized in a monoclinic C2/c structure (#15).34
The above MAX phases containing one or two early transition metals belong to the low-entropy MAX phase. In addition, the MAX phases containing three pre-transition metals are known as the medium-entropy MAX phase, and in recent years, the high-entropy MAX phase containing four or five pre-transition metals has also attracted extensive research interest.35,36
To date, more than 150 kinds of MAX phases have been synthesized, and new MAX phases are being constantly discovered and produced.29 The special structure of MAX phases can not only reduce the difficulty of synthesis of some MXenes, but also open up a broader space for the application of MXenes. For example, the MXenes with ordered vacancies in the plane can be obtained by etching i-MAX phases, while the MXenes with lattice distortion can be obtained by etching high-entropy MAX phases.37,38
In addition to the MAX phase as the precursor of MXenes, another class of non-MAX phases can also be used as the precursor of MXenes. There are mainly two categories: (MC)nAmCm−1 type layered compounds and M2A2C type layered compounds.39,40
In conclusion, the precursors of MXenes are divided into MAX phases and non-MAX phases. MAX phases are divided into a low-entropy MAX phase, a medium-entropy MAX phase, and a high-entropy MAX phase. At present, the low-entropy MAX phase, which contains one or two early transition metals, is the most widely synthesized and applied phase. Therefore, it is very important to find and synthesize more precursor phases to expand the category, properties, and applications of MXenes.
2.2. The synthesis of MXenes
The carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides of two-dimensional transition metals are collectively called MXenes. The general formula of MXenes is Mn+1XnTx, where M and X in MXenes have the same meaning as MAX phases, M represents early transition metal; X represents carbon or nitrogen element; and n = 1, 2, 3, or 4. The difference is that Tx in MXenes represents surface functional groups such as –OH, –O, –F, and –Cl, which are introduced during the etching process of MAX phases to prepare MXenes. So far, more than 100 MXenes have been reported, but only 40 of them have been synthesized experimentally, and most of them have only been calculated theoretically.41,42
Currently, most of the MXene preparation methods are classified as “top–down” and “bottom–up” strategies.
2.2.1. Top–down preparation of MXenes. Etching the precursors for obtaining MXenes is considered a “top–down” preparation method, or in other words, the “top–down” approach refers to the process of reducing bulk materials, or removing part of the bulk structures to leave micro- to nano-sized particles.43 For example, in 2011, Yury et al. synthesized the world's first MXene material, two-dimensional Ti3C2, by etching the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase with hydrogen fluoride solution. The principle was that the Ti–C bond is stronger than the Ti–Al bond, and based on the high reactivity of F− with Al, HF breaks the weaker Ti–Al bond and selectively etches the Al atom layer. The exposed Ti atoms on the surface combine with –OH, –O, and –F to finally form MXene materials with surface functional groups. The related reaction process is shown in eqn (1)–(4).24 
Ti3AlC2 + 3HF → AlF3 + 3/2H2 + Ti3C2
(1) 
Ti3C2 + 2HF → Ti3C2F2 + H2
(2) 
Ti3C2 + 2H2O → Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2
(3) 
Ti3C2 + 2H2O → Ti3C2O2 + H2
(4)Similarly, other MXenes can also be prepared by etching different MAX phases, based on the principle that the M–X bond is stronger than the M–A bond; thus the A atom layer is selectively etched. The general preparation procedure of Ti3C2Tx MXene is shown in Fig. 2d.
However, not all MAX phases can be easily etched, and typically, MAX phases with larger n values are more difficult to etch. And the difficulty of etching also depends on the strength of the M–A bond and the solubility of the A-layer atoms in the etchant. Therefore, the key to the successful preparation of MXene is to select an appropriate etchant and etching method for different MAX phases. For example, HF solution is only suitable for etching a small number of MAX phases where the A-layer consists of Al atoms. The high chemical activity of Al and the low reduction potential relative to all other A elements (e.g., Si, Ge, In, or Sn) make M–A bonds containing Al easier to break compared to bonds with other A elements.44 And for MAX phases with Al atoms in all A-atom layers, the difficulty in etching the MAX phases of different early transition metals is different. For example, Ti3C2TX-MXene can be obtained by etching Ti3AlC2 with 5 wt% HF at room temperature, but V2AlC and Nb4AlC3 need to be etched with 50 wt% HF to obtain the corresponding MXenes.45,46
HF solutions are highly hazardous, especially for biomedical applications; thus it is of great importance to minimize the use of HF. For this reason, researchers have made many attempts. One idea is to mix HF with other acids to ensure its etching ability while reducing the proportion of HF.47
Avoiding the direct use of HF solution and using in situ generated HF etching method is also one of the ways to reduce the risk. The most representative method is to prepare MXenes by in situ generation of HF as an etching agent from HCl/LiF mixed solution. This method was first reported by Ghidiu et al.,48 and “clay-like” Ti3C2Tx-MXene was successfully prepared by etching Ti3AlC2 with a mixed HCl/LiF solution at 40 °C. MXene films were further produced by roller pressing, which not only possess good flexibility and hydrophilicity, but also show excellent electrical conductivity.
In addition to LiF/HCl, other salts such as NaF,49,50 KF,51,52 NH4F,51 etc. can also be used as an alternative of LiF, which can combine with HCl as an etchant. Besides, the bifluoride salt NH4HF can also be used as an etchant to prepare MXenes. In 2014, Halim et al.53 reported the selective etching of Al by sputter deposition of epitaxial Ti3AlC2 films in an aqueous NH4HF2 solution to fabricate ∼1 × 1 cm2 Ti3C2 films. The films with a thickness of approximately 15 nm can transmit about 90% of light in the visible to infrared range, and exhibit metal conductivity as low as 100 K (Fig. 3a and b). Natu et al.54 synthesized MXenes without water using a polar solvent and NH4HF2 solution. This study showed that the MAX phase could be etched in a polar organic solvent and NH4HF2 solution, and F-terminated MXenes can be obtained without water, which opens the way for the use of MXenes in many water-sensitive applications.

In addition to the above method of in situ generation of HF as an etchant, there is another mainstream method for in situ generation of HF, the fluorine-containing molten salt etching method. This approach is more applicable to nitride MXenes than carbide MXenes. Nitride has higher formation energy and lower cohesion energy compared to carbide.55 The higher formation energy means that the Al atoms are more strongly bound in the N-based MAX phase, thus requiring more energy to remove. The lower cohesion energy means that the N-based MAX phase is less stable and may be dissolved in HF solutions.43 In order to overcome the above difficulties, Yury et al.56 prepared nitride MXenes for the first time in 2016 by a triple molten salt method. In this method a mixed molten salt of LiF, NaF, and KF was utilized to co-heat Ti4AlN3 at 550 °C to generate Ti4N3Tx, and the surface of the product obtained by this method did not contain –OH groups. This method showed that molten salt can be used as an etchant to prepare some MXenes that may be difficult to prepare by aqueous etching methods. It has provided a new idea for tailoring surface groups of MXenes.
However, the above methods still involve the utilization of –F groups, and fluorine-free etchants have been developed for MXene preparation. This series of methods mainly include electrochemical etching,57 alkali etching,58 Lewis acid molten salt etching,59 and so on. Electrochemical preparation of MXenes is a green and non-polluting method, but the efficiency is relatively low. Etching the MAX phases with a concentrated alkali is an effective method, and a highly hydrophilic product with no F-terminus can be obtained. However, the danger of using alkali at high concentration and high temperature limit their applicability in large-scale MXene preparation. Furthermore, the resulting products are usually multilayer MXenes with accordion-like morphology, which require further intercalation and layering to produce monolayer MXene nanosheets.60 Lewis acid salts extend the etchable MAX phases from Al-containing MAX phases to non-Al MAX phases (e.g., Si, Zn, and Ga).61 These molten salts can produce strong electron-accepting ligands, which can react thermodynamically with the A elements in the MAX phase. At the same time, certain types of atoms or ions can diffuse into the two-dimensional atomic plane, and then bind with unsaturated Mn+1Xn lamellae to form the corresponding MXenes. The flexible choice of salt composition can provide enough room to control the reaction temperature and the type of intercalating ions.62
In addition, some other interesting fluorine-free etching methods have been developed. Some methods are still in the preliminary stage of research and have great potential for development. As shown in Fig. 3c, Sun et al. proposed a novel and effective UV-induced selective etching method for preparing fluorine-free mesoporous Mo2C MXene from Mo2Ga2C bulk ceramics in a few hours, which expanded the range of precursors from MAX-phase precursors to non-MAX-phase precursors. The resulting MXene exhibited a unique two-dimensional sheet structure, without much contamination of impurity ions.63

2.2.2. Bottom–up preparation of MXenes. As mentioned previously, top–down methods of MXene preparation, whether with or without fluorine etching, inevitably introduce defects into the MXenes. These defects are heavily dependent on the structure of their parent phase, which makes it more difficult to control the quality of MXenes. Therefore, it is very important to develop the “bottom–up” preparation methods for direct generation of MXenes. Until now, “bottom–up” preparation methods for obtaining MXenes are less studied compared to “top–down” etching methods. “Bottom–up” methods mainly include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), templating, and plasma-enhanced pulsed laser deposition (PEPLD) methods.CVD involves several defined growth parameters, such as temperature, pressure, gas flow rate, catalyst type, etc. By adjusting these parameters, the size, morphology, number of layers, and quality of 2D materials can be finely controlled.64–66 In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the preparation of MXenes by CVD growth methods. In 2015, Xu et al.67 prepared high-quality ultrathin α-Mo2C crystals by CVD for the first time. The high-quality two-dimensional ultra-thin α-Mo2C crystals with thicknesses of a few nanometers and lateral dimensions of more than 100 μm were grown at temperatures above 1085 °C, when using methane as a carbon source and Cu foil as a substrate. The Mo atoms were arranged in a hcp structure, and the C atoms were located at the centre of six surrounding Mo atoms, forming an orthorhombic structure, without observable defects, disorders or impurities. In addition, Fan et al.68 summarized the recent research progress achieved inn the preparation of transition metal carbide and nitride MXenes by various CVD methods.
The template method is another bottom–up method for MXene preparation, with a yield much higher than that of CVD. All template methods involve 2D transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheets as templates, which are subsequently carbonized or nitrided to synthesize 2D TMCs or TMNs. The structure of 2D TMCs and TMNs depends on the 2D TMOs used. For example, Xu et al.69 reported a salt-templated synthesis of metallic two-dimensional MoN nanosheets. Fig. 4a shows the synthesis mechanism of MoN nanosheets. First, 2D hexagonal MoO3-coated NaCl powders are produced by annealing Mo precursor-coated NaCl in an Ar atmosphere. Second, by annealing the samples in an NH3 atmosphere, 2D MoN-coated NaCl samples can be obtained. Finally, by washing the samples in water, NaCl is dissolved, leaving 2D MoN dispersed in water. The Tyndall phenomenon in Fig. 4b shows the good dispersion of 2D MoN in an aqueous solution. The appearance of the N 1s peak (∼397.5 eV) and the Mo-N bonding (centered at ∼393.7 eV) confirms the formation of MoN (Fig. 4c). The obvious large size of the layered nanosheets can be seen (Fig. 4d).

Joshi et al.70 also reported the synthesis of large-area, vertically oriented 2D MoN layers by a template method. It consisted of two steps: synthesis of 2D MoO3 nanosheets by a hot filament CVD process, and then phase change to δ-MoN. This simple two-step phase transition 2D oxide layer approach may enable the facile synthesis of various nitrides and carbides of MXenes with tunable composition.
The PEPLD method combines the advantages of plasma-enhanced CVD and pulsed laser deposition. In 2017, Zhang et al.71,72 found that plasma CH4 facilitated the formation of MO2C, which could be used as a C source. When the sapphire substrate was heated to 700 °C, it reacted with Mo vapor generated by a pulsed laser to deposit high-quality Mo2C films. The obtained face-centered cubic (fcc) Mo2C films were very uniform and smooth.
Above are the various “top–down” and “bottom–up” methods of MXene preparation. The specific methods are summarized in Table 1.

2.3. The structure of MXenes
As mentioned above, the structure of MXenes is determined from their precursors. Currently, most of the synthesized MXene precursors originate from the MAX phases. After the atoms of the A-atom layers in the MAX phases are etched, the arrangement of the M and X atoms in MXenes remains the same as in the MAX phases. The schematic diagrams of the structures of different MXenes are shown in Fig. 4e.73 For double transition metal MXenes, the precursors to be etched can be selected according to the needs. For example, chemical-ordered o-MXenes along the out-of-plane direction can be obtained from the o-MAX phases;74 vacancy-ordered i-MXene can be obtained by etching the i-MAX phases;38,75 and the disordered structures of solid solution MXenes can be obtained by etching solid solution MAX phases.76
It is worth pointing out that in terms of structural stability, nitride MXenes are less stable than carbide MXenes due to the lower cohesion energy, which is why the number and application of nitride MXenes are far less than those of carbide MXenes at present.
Currently, high-entropy MXenes are increasingly attracting the attention of researchers. Anasori et al.36 successfully obtained two-dimensional high-entropy MXenes TiVNbMoC3Tx and TiVCrMoC3Tx by etching high-entropy MAX phases TiVNbMoAlC3 and TiVCrMoAlC3 with HF solution. Zhou et al.77 successfully prepared Ti1.1V0.7CrxNb1.0Ta0.6C3Tx high-entropy MXene films, which exhibited a gravimetric capacitance of 490 F g−1 (1688 F cm−3) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in a supercapacitor, demonstrating the ultra-high energy storage potential of the high-entropy MXenes. The concept of “high-entropy alloys” was introduced in 2004.88 In high-entropy alloys, multiple elements are combined with high atomic concentrations and almost equal atomic ratios to form stable single phases. The high-entropy MXenes have many special properties, such as high mechanical stability, high corrosion resistance, extreme thermal stability, and high catalytic properties, which are highly attractive for applications such as sensing, biomedicine, and energy storage.36,37,77,88
2.4. Intercalation and surface modification
2.4.1. Intercalation of MXenes. During etching process of most MXenes without intercalation peeling, the layers of MXenes are stacked together because of the van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, leading to the greatly reduced original performance of MXenes. Inserting molecules, cations, and organic bases between the layers of MXenes are the three main ways (Fig. 5a) of intercalation at present.42 Intercalation changes the lattice parameters of MXenes, expands the MXene layer spacing, and peels off the layers to form monolayer MXene nanosheets. Intercalation has been the key process affecting the crystal structure of 2D MXenes.89

The addition of certain synergistic additives during the intercalation and chemical modification of surface functional groups can yield stable and efficient MXene based materials, which exhibit excellent optical, electrical and magnetic properties.42 For example, Wang et al.90 reported a simple and efficient composite synthesis strategy employing TiOF2 intercalation to enhance the stability of MXene materials.
Wang et al.91 elucidated the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2Tx on an atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. STEM studies have shown that functional groups (such as –OH, –F, and –O) and intercalated sodium (Na) ions tend to stay on top of the central Ti atom and C atom, respectively, in the Ti3C2 monolayer. Fig. 5b shows the schematic representation of the intercalation layer during the preparation of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH). Fig. 5c shows a schematic diagram of the structure of Ti3C2Tx after being etched, showing the expansion of the interlayer spacing.92

2.4.2. Surface modification of MXenes. Ashton and his colleagues93 demonstrated, after DFT calculations, that binding the surface termination groups would significantly reduce the Gibbs free energy of MXenes, thus making the reactions proceed spontaneously. There are four possible sites for binding end groups on the surface of MXenes (Fig. 5d and e).94The four sites are the hcp site (hollow sites between stacked X-atoms), the fcc site (hollow sites between top M-atoms), the top M-atom site, and the bridge site between two M-atoms. Theoretical calculations indicate that all these sites are energetically stable, but during the relaxation of MXenes, the top sites of M atoms and bridging sites are transformed into hcp sites and fcc sites due to the structural optimization of MXenes. In addition, the fcc configuration of one surface and the hcp configuration of the other surface can be realized according to the ionic state of the surface M atoms.43,95,96
The surface of MXene usually contains a variety of termination groups, and the termination groups are usually disordered. In recent years, with the deepening of the research on the termination groups of MXenes, the supersaturation of surface termination groups of MXenes has been found, and the mechanism and impact of this phenomenon need further study.94 In addition, the researchers predicted a Janus MXene through theoretical calculations. Janus structure is a unique asymmetric surface structure. Janus MXene has the characteristic of dual surfactants by combining different functional groups on both the upper and lower surfaces, such as Cr2CFCl.97 Yu et al.98 synthesized a Janus MXene nanosheet with one lipophilic end and other hydrophilic end by selectively grafting polystyrene onto the side of MXene nanosheets. These findings and methods are yet to be further studied, and they all provide new ideas on how to modulate the properties of MXenes.
In conclusion, various theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the stability, electronic structure, and physicochemical properties of MXenes can be controlled by tuning surface termination.43

3. Optical properties and photothermal conversion of MXenes
MXenes have attracted the attention of researchers in many fields because of their unique and excellent performance. So far, MXenes have made a lot of research achievements in energy storage, catalysis, electromagnetic shielding, environment, and other fields. Although MXenes are also receiving increasing attention in the biomedical field, there is still much room for expansion of the achievements and research results, compared with other fields. The optical properties of MXenes and the principles of photothermal conversion have not been studied thoroughly. Attributed to the high tunability of various properties exhibited by MXenes, their conformational relationship remains to be explored. In short, further explorations on the optical properties and photothermal conversion of MXenes are of great significance for their biomedical applications.
3.1. Optical properties of MXenes
The optical properties of MXenes are closely related to their structures and electronic properties. For instance, MXenes such as Ti2C, V2C, and T3C2 at low n values match very well with photon energies in the visible range, with band gaps in the range of 0.92 to 1.75 eV, and can interact with light in the visible spectrum.99 So MXenes have a high PCE for promising photothermal applications, while MXenes with high n values such as Mo4VC4 show featureless absorption spectra in the visible to NIR range (400–2500 nm), and this type of MXene is suitable for application in transparent electrodes.100
Theoretical analysis of various optical properties of materials (such as transmittance, refractive index, absorptivity, etc.) is performed by studying the real part and imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant, and its correlation formula is as follows, eqn (1).101 
ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω)
(1)where ε denotes the dielectric constant, ω denotes the frequency of the photon, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) represent the real and imaginary parts of the function, respectively. The real part and imaginary part of the optical dielectric constant are obtained by the transformation of the Kramers–Kronig equation, and the expression of the photon absorption coefficient is as shown in the formula eqn (2): 
(2)As can be seen from the above formula, the larger the ε2(ω), the better the photon absorption.102 Therefore, surface termination groups have a great influence on the photon absorption properties of MXenes, since the –O terminals are more electronegative, which may lead to larger bandgaps compared to –F and –OH terminals, that is to say, –O has a higher ε2(ω) compared to –F and –OH, thus achieving stronger light-absorbing properties.20
In addition to modulating the end groups to improve the optical properties of MXenes, the modification of MXenes using magnetic transition metals can also enhance the optical properties of MXenes. For example, compared to Ti3C2 without Ni modification, the light absorption coefficient of Ni/Ti3C2 composites increased by 50% in the visible and UV range. The light absorption coefficient of Fe/Ti3C2 composites was increased by more than 100% compared to that of Ti3C2 without modification. This enhanced optical absorption was related to the changed electronic structure of MXenes after doping with magnetic atoms. DFT calculations showed that, the d electronic orbitals significantly influenced the electronic states near the Fermi energy level of Ti3C2 modified with Fe and Ni. There was a strong peak in the d orbitals in the −4 to −1 eV range, leading to spin polarization and changing optical properties.103 In addition, the optical performance of MXenes is also related to the thickness of their devices. For example, Yang et al.104 observed a linear relationship between the absorbance and the thickness of Ti3C2Tx films. Maleski et al.105 showed that Ti3C2Tx samples with larger flakes showed an absorption behavior similar to that of samples with smaller lateral sizes, and in general, the normalized absorption in the visible wavelength range decreased with reduced flake size.
3.2. Photothermal conversion of MXenes
As mentioned in the Introduction section, the photothermal effect is produced by light excitation, thus generating heat. Furthermore, when illuminated with light, these materials absorb photons to produce photoexcitation, and then mobile charges are driven by a light-induced electric field that ultimately converts solar energy into heat.106 At present, due to the complex structure and diverse composition of MXenes, their photothermal conversion mechanism may be varied, which needs further exploration.
The photothermal performance in photothermal conversion is based on two main parameters: extinction coefficient (α) and PCE (η), where α is used to characterize the light absorption capacity and η indicates the performance index of converting light into heat. Based on the Lambert–Beer law eqn (3): 
A/L = αC
(3)where A is the normalized adsorption intensity, L is the length of the cell, and C is the concentration.2
And the expression for the PCE efficiency (η) is given using eqn (4): 
(4)where Aλ is the absorbance of the nanosheet at the excitation wavelength of the NIR laser; I is the incident energy of the NIR laser in mW; Qdis is the reference energy input of the sample cell; Tmax and Tsurr are the maximum temperature and the ambient temperature, respectively; S is the surface area of the sample; and h is the heat transfer coefficient.107
Li et al.18 concluded by measurement that the internal PCE of Ti3C2-MXene could reach 100%. Lin et al.108 prepared ultrathin two-dimensional Ta4C3 nanosheets and achieved a high extinction coefficient of 4.06 L g−1 cm−1 under NIR light irradiation at 808 nm wavelength. A high PCE of 44.7% was achieved, which was significantly better than that of nanomaterials such as graphene and gold nanorods. It is now widely believed that the efficient photothermal conversion of MXenes resulted from the LSPR effect.109–111 The so-called LSPR effect refers to the resonant coherent oscillation of charges at the metal–dielectric interface when the photon frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the electrons on the metal nanoparticle surface. The decay of surface plasmons involves two competing processes, one is the radiative decay process of light scattering by re-emitting photons, and the other is the non-radiative decay process. The hot electrons are formed from the excitation of the occupied state to the unoccupied state and then converted into heat energy.112,113 However, Zhang et al.114 pointed out that the weak oxidation resistance and unclear photothermal mechanism of MXenes hindered their photothermal modulation. They fabricated in-plane two-dimensional Ti3C2/TiO2 heterostructures by partial oxidation, and demonstrated an unconventional photothermal effect under NIR irradiation, that is, oxidation damaged the LSPR capability. This performance was attributed to the faster transfer of photoexcited electrons on the seamless in-plane Ti3C2/TiO2 heterostructure, and the 1–2 orders of magnitude faster relaxation processes of electrons than the ground bleaching in the original MXenes.
MXenes are often hybridized with other materials to form nanocomposites with good photothermal conversion properties for practical applications. For example, Zhou and his colleagues115 coated Ti3C2 MXene with polyurethane (PU) to obtain MXene@PU composites for thermal activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) and clean water production. The principle is shown in Fig. 6. MXene exhibits excellent absorption performance for sunlight. Then, MXene converts the light into heat energy and raises the temperature of the MXene@PU module and the native solution. The thermal energy then activates the PDS and produces SO4−˙ and HO˙, which further decompose the organic pollutants. At the same time, heating the aqueous solution generates large amounts of water vapor. Finally, the water vapor condenses to produce clean water. It is worth mentioning that the interface temperature of MXene@PU reaches 140 °C, while the temperature of PU is almost only 82 °C. The efficient photothermal conversion of MXenes increases the interface temperature of the material by 1.7 times. Zhang et al.116 prepared carboxylated carbon nanotubes@MXene/cellulose films (CNTs@MXene/CFs) with an interconnected conductive network. A heterojunction of carboxylated carbon nanotubes and MXene was constructed by simple dip-coating and spray-coating methods. This work achieves the integration of multifunctional features of Joule heating, photo-thermal conversion, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding (Fig. 7a). The excellent photothermal conversion performance of MXenes is also demonstrated (Fig. 7b–e). The temperature of MXene material after loading carboxylated carbon nanotubes is significantly higher than that of uncoated MXene, attributed to the synergistic effect of CNTs and MXene.

In addition to the above MXene composites with carbon nanomaterials and polymers, MXenes also easily form good nanocomposites with semiconductors117 and metal materials.118
The composites obtained by combining MXenes with other materials can often show higher photothermal conversion ability, which is generally attributed to the synergistic effect of multiple materials. However, the mechanism of the synergistic effect is often complicated. As an example, Li et al.119 prepared Cu2MoS4@Ti3C2 nanocomposites with a very high PCE (η = 87.98%). This was attributed to not only the LSPR effect of Ti3C2, but also the fact that the excited electrons would irreversibly migrate from Cu2MoS4 to MXene until their Fermi energy levels reached equilibrium. This migration can then be accelerated due to the high electrical conductivity of MXene. The process was also defined as band engineering caused by electron transfer regulation effects. Apparently, the primary excited electrons of Cu2MoS4 in Cu2MoS4@ MXene nanocomposites would migrate to MXene instead of radiative complexation with holes, so the probability of non-radiative complexation can be increased exponentially, thus improving the photothermal performance.119,120
Furthermore, while MXenes and their composites have demonstrated high-efficiency conversion performance in many fields, their applications in biomedicine are still in the ascendant.
4. Photothermal conversion of MXenes for biomedical applications

Currently, the biomedical applications utilizing the photothermal conversion properties of MXenes are mainly focused on four fields, includingare PTT, PA imaging, drug delivery, and antibacterial agents.
In this section, the applications utilizing the efficient photothermal conversion properties of MXenes and their complexes in each of these four fields are reviewed.

4.1. PTT for tumors
PTT is an important biomedical method, in which nanomaterials effectively generate heat under light irradiation of a specific power intensity for killing target cells.121 The advantage of PTT is its ability to minimize damage to healthy tissues, making it a promising approach for biomedical treatment.
The applications of PTT for tumor eradication have inspired considerable research passion. Two basic components affect the performance of PTT: the external photoreactive agent and the photothermal agent. Typically, the photothermal agent accumulates within the tumor and generates local heat upon light irradiation, subsequently causing a hyperthermic effect to kill cancer cells.122,123 As previously described, the two main indicators for describing the performance of materials used for PTT are the PCE (η) and extinction coefficient (α).
The high extinction coefficient and PCE of MXenes have rapidly attracted the interest of researchers in the field of tumor treatment.
Ti3C2Tx, the most common MXene, has been extensively studied for the PTT of cancer. MXene quantum dots (MXene QDs) of titanium carbide have been fabricated. Yu et al.125 deployed a simple and safe fluorine-free method for preparing MXene QDs as an effective nanoscale biocompatible reagent for PTT. The preparation process is shown in Fig. 8a. As a result, the prepared MXene QDs showed an extinction coefficient of up to 52.8 L g−1 cm−1 and a PCE of up to 52.2% at 808 nm. The prepared MXene QDs achieved simultaneous PA imaging and significant PTT effects on tumors. Kyrylenko et al.147 showed for the first time that a pulsed 1064 nm laser could be employed for selective ablation of cells loaded with Ti3C2Tx MXene. The low toxicity and good biocompatibility of this MXene was demonstrated in vitro, and a good safety profile was demonstrated based on in vivo experiments (Fig. 8b). Perini et al.149 investigated the few-layer and multi-layer Ti3C2Tx MXenes-mediated PTT effects on two different 3D reliable breast cancer models including conventional and bioprinted spheroids. They performed PTT on two cancer models using MXene solutions at a concentration of 50 μg mL−1. After PTT, a significant decrease in cell viability and a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed. Furthermore, they investigated the effects of PTT on the migration of macrophages and endothelial cells to cancerous areas in two 3D models. Their results showed that PTT mediated by few-layer and multi-layer MXenes significantly modulated tumor progression through cell death by increasing temperature, which was especially significant for bioprinted models (Fig. 8c).

In addition to Ti3C2-MXene itself, Ti3C2 is usually hybridized with other materials such as metal nanoparticles to achieve better performance for PTT. Hussein et al.128 synthesized Au/MXene flakes by in situ reduction of tetrachloroauric acid on Ti3C2Tx, followed by in situ integration of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through the reaction between freshly prepared magnetite Fe3O4 NPs and MXene solutions, thus obtaining a magnetic Au/Fe3O4/MXene. Both new composites exhibited a significant in vitro dose-dependent PTT effect against human breast cancer cells MCF7. Interestingly, in vivo acute toxicity assays using zebrafish embryos indicated that Au/MXene and Au/Fe3O4/MXene had less embryonic mortality (LC50 ≫ 1000 μg mL−1) than pristine MXene (LC50 = 257.46 μg mL−1). Wu et al.135 doped Fe2+ into two-dimensional Ti3C2, and ferrous ions were anchored on two-dimensional MXene nanosheets by electrostatic adsorption to prepare multifunctional Fe-Ti3C2 materials for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PTT.
MXenes are also commonly integrated with metal oxides. Chen's group124 carefully designed a MnOx/Ti3C2 composite (Fig. 9). These MXene composites were generated by in situ growth of tiny MnOx nanosheets on the Ti3C2 surface through direct redox reactions. Then its surface was further modified with soybean phospholipid (SP) to further improve the stability of MnOx/Ti3C2 composite nanosheets. MnOx/Ti3C2 MXenes are used as multifunctional theranostic materials for MRI and PA dual-modality imaging to guide PTT of cancer. Zhu et al.155 prepared a composite of Ti3C2 and TiO2 by in situ assembly, and the heterojunction of Ti3C2 and TiO2 was used to synergistically enhance NIR-II PTT and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for breast cancer. The Ti3C2/TiO2 heterojunction showed a PCE of up to 44.98% under NIR-II irradiation.

The clinical application of PTT is severely limited by the depth of tissue penetration of the excitation light, and the previously developed enzyme therapy is hampered by the low therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, Ti3C2 MXene-based PTT was combined with artificial enzymes for performing synergistic cancer therapy. Zhu et al.139 injected the prepared Pt nanoparticles into the Ti3C2Tx dispersion, and then dispersed the mixed solution into a solution containing amino-[poly(ethylene glycol)] (NH2–PEG), and obtained the Ti3C2Tx–Pt–PEG complex after washing with water (Fig. 10a). In the tumor microenvironment, Pt nanoparticles exhibit peroxidase-like (POD-like) activity and can catalyze in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) from hydrogen peroxide to induce apoptosis and necrosis. At the same time, the composite showed desirable photothermal effects under NIR-II light irradiation at low power density (0.75 W cm−2). In particular, the POD-like activity was significantly enhanced because of the rising temperature induced by the photothermal effect of Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 10b). The PCE of Ti3C2Tx–Pt–PEG was calculated to be 31.78%, exhibiting efficient ablation of tumor cells via synergistic photothermal ablation and nanocatalysis therapy. Similarly, Dang et al.150 co-immobilized monodisperse ultrasmall Pd nanoclusters and the photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H porphyrin (Thp) to prepare multifunctional platform MXene nanosheets, thus generating Pd-Thp-Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites. Pd nanoclusters and Thp were well distributed on the MXene surface, while MXene maintained its broad light absorption and PCE. In this nanoplatform, Pd selectively catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to O2 under a single 808 nm laser irradiation, and O2 was continuously supplied to Thp to enhance NIR-driven PDT. In vivo fluorescence and photothermal imaging demonstrated significant accumulation of nanocomposites at tumor sites. The in vitro and in vivo results clearly demonstrated that the biocompatible nanocomposites exhibited synergistic PTT and enhanced PDT for promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells. This work not only provided a promising solution for tumor hypoxia through a combination of PTT and PDT, but also broadened the application of innovative optical materials in the biomedical field.

In addition to Ti3C2-based MXenes, other MXenes have been reported. For example, Ta4C3108 exhibited excellent photothermal conversion performance (η = 44.7%), which was used for in vitro/in vivo photothermal ablation of tumors. Dong's research group129 successfully synthesized V2C nanosheets by extracting the MAX phase of layered V2AlC from algae. It was then applied as a highly efficient photothermal agent for in vitro and in vivo photothermal ablation of tumors. This method for synthesizing MXene avoided the use of harmful fluorine element, making it an ideal biocompatible material for PTT. V2C nanosheets achieved a PCE of 48%. In addition, the PCE of other carbide MXenes was 42.9% for Mo2C, 36.4% for Nb2C in NIR-I (808 nm), and 45.65% in NIR-II (1064 nm).158,159
Nitride and carbonitride MXenes are able to increase the electron number of MXenes due to the incorporation of more electronegative N, leading to feasible enhancement of the LSPR.161 It was highly desirable to find PTT agents with excellent light trapping ability in both NIR-I and NIR-II ranges.142 However, so far, a limited number of studies have been performed on the use of nitride and carbonitride MXenes for PTT against tumors. But there are some interesting preliminary works. Zhu et al.142 reported that Ti3C1.15N0.85F0.88O0.56(OH)0.56 exhibited a strong NIR absorption (36.6 L g−1 cm−1 at 808 nm and 43.5 L g−1 cm−1 at 1064 nm), resulting in efficient photonic hyperthermia against tumors in vitro and in vivo. Shao et al.131 prepared Ti2N QDs with a size of about 5 nm, and the photothermal conversion rates were 48.62% and 45.51% under NIR-I and NIR-II laser irradiation, respectively. In addition to the high PCE, the biodegradability of Ti2N QDs is good, allowing them to be excreted out of the body at a suitable excretion rate (Fig. 11).

In conclusion, the application of MXenes' photothermal conversion in PTT has a broad prospect. Optimizing the structure and composition of MXenes to further improve their PCE and stability will also be a focus of future research.
4.2. Drugs delivery
The drug delivery performance of MXenes is mainly judged by two indicators: drug loading rate and drug release rate. The loading ability could be calculated using the following equation:Drug loading ability (w/w%) = (the weight of final loaded drugs)/(weight of initial MXenes) × 100%.
Precise drug delivery is important for targeted therapy. Ye et al.151 prepared two-dimensional ultrathin Ti3C2-MXene nanosheets and rapamycin (Rapa) by a two-step spin-coating method. Rapa@Ti3C2 was prepared by electrostatic self-assembly of Ti3C2 and Rapa, with a Rapa loading capacity of 92%. The prepared Rapa@Ti3C2 was used for the treatment of posterior capsule opacification (PCO, one of the most common late-onset complications after cataract surgery). Gao et al.152 processed MXene with CNTs for preparing three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb structures with anti-aggregation capability. The microspheres of this structure can achieve a maximum doxorubicin (DOX) loading capacity of 85.6%.
Researchers have combined PTT and drug delivery for targeted tumor therapy. After surface functionalization/modification with bioactive/biocompatible agents, MXene-based nanosystems have been used for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs/therapeutics in cancer therapy.162 The energy generated during photothermal conversion is also used to promote the drug release. For example, Lu et al.157 prepared IL-Ti3C2TxMXene@DOX nanosheets using ionic liquid etching. The release rate of IL-Ti3C2TxMXene@DOX exceeded 10% after 10 min of 808 nm laser irradiation, which was significantly higher than the release rate without irradiation. This may be because the heat generated by laser irradiation (∼50 °C) promotes the release of DOX. Hao et al.133 proposed an assembly consisting of Nb2C, Pt nanozymes, DOX, and tumor cell membrane (NPD@M, Fig. 12a) for enhancing biocatalytic activity and achieving tumor regression. Nb2C is a typical MXene with an ability to absorb NIR-II light, which can be applied as an ideal plasma exciton. As shown in Fig. 12b, the Nb2C-rich hot electron oscillations are utilized to enhance the catalytic activity of the nanoenzyme, and then excite and kill deep tumor cells using a NIR-II laser. Specifically, when NPD@M is injected into the body through the tail vein, the excellent photothermal properties under NIR-II light irradiation dilate the tumor blood vessels, thereby enhancing blood perfusion and drug extravasation. After NPD@M is engulfed into the tumor cells, DOX is released under hyperthermic and acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment. The thermal effect of plasma significantly enhances the activity of the nanoenzyme. Using a high concentration of H2O2 (100 μM–1 mM) in the tumor microenvironment, the nanoenzyme exhibits excellent peroxidase activity to produce more O2, alleviates tumor hypoxia, and down-regulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α). At the same time, the enhanced oxidase activity promotes ROS production, which may reduce the energy supply of mitochondria to P-gp glycoprotein, a membrane efflux pump that recognizes chemotherapeutic drugs and transports them out of the cell (Fig. 12c).

In summary, MXenes can combine with various drugs to form MXene-drug complexes, thereby achieving efficient drug loading and controlled release. How to improve the drug loading efficiency of MXenes and control the accuracy of drug release is a problem that needs to be solved at present. In addition, the further optimization of the PCE and photothermal stability of MXenes is also an important direction for future research.
4.3. PA imaging
PA imaging is a promising biomedical imaging modality that demonstrates both the superior contrast of conventional optical imaging and the excellent spatiotemporal resolution of ultrasound imaging.163 PA imaging takes advantage of the PA effect first reported by Alexander Graham Bell.164 The principal is that the tissue structure absorbs light energy and causes transient thermoelastic expansion, resulting in broadband US waves. The ultrasound waves can be detected using an ultrasound transducer, converted to an electrical signal, and appropriately processed to obtain PA images. PA imaging is a non-invasive imaging strategy that depends on the light absorption coefficient of the targeted tissue.165
It is necessary to develop externally injectable PA imaging contrast agents with high efficiency to improve their contrast, resolution, and tissue penetration. Excellent contrast agents should have photophysical properties such as low quantum yield, high molar extinction coefficients, NIR window peak absorption, excellent photostability, low toxicity and immunogenicity, high target affinity and specificity, and good biocompatibility.166
PA imaging technology is used as an auxiliary means, which is often jointly used with other medical applications. For example, Lu et al.,157 using ionic liquids (IL) as an etchant, synthesized few-layer IL-Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with high chemical stability for PA imaging and PTT for tumor treatment. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, the nanosheets have strong absorption in the near-infrared region and high PCE (∼63.91%). Using DOX as a model drug, the IL-Ti3C2TxMXene@DOX nanosheets exhibit high drug loading and pH-/photosensitivity, which will further facilitate the nanosheets’ drug development under an acidic tumor microenvironment and 808 nm laser irradiation. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that IL-Ti3C2Tx MXene@DOX has good biosafety, remarkable PA imaging capability, and can effectively kill cancer cells through photothermal/chemotherapy synergy. Its PA imaging has been demonstrated in Fig. 13. Dai and his colleagues156 constructed a MnOx/Ta4C3 composite material by in situ growth of manganese oxide nanoparticles on Ta4C3 MXene. The photothermal-conversion performance of MnOx/Ta4C3 composite nanosheets not only has achieved contrast-enhanced PA imaging, but also realized the significant tumor-growth suppression by photothermal hyperthermia. Shao131 and Dai158 prepared Ti2N and Mo2C quantum dots (QDs), respectively. Their research shows that MXene QDs materials have high potential in PA imaging guidance PTT and can be used for precise cancer treatment. Wang and his colleagues167 sequentially embedded glucose oxidase (GOx) and the respiratory inhibitor 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BP) into a two-dimensional Ti3C2 MXene/Cu2O nanosheet (MCP NS), constructing a multifunctional nanoplatform of 3-BP@MCG NSs. With excellent photothermal conversion performance and high-resolution PA imaging ability, this composite can overcome the hypoxic environment, enhance the effect of photodynamic therapy, and be monitored by PA imaging, further verifying the application potential of MXene in PA imaging and photodynamic therapy. There are also some good examples for applying PA imaging to PPT given in Table 2.

However, despite these promising findings, further research is needed to fully understand the biokinetics and long-term safety of MXenes in biological systems, as well as to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio in PA imaging, providing more accurate and detailed information for disease diagnosis and treatment.
Overall, MXene-based materials, due to their unique properties and versatility, show great potential in PA imaging. With continuous research and development, MXene-based materials may become an essential tool in non-invasive imaging and theranostics.
4.4. Antibacterial
MXenes are highly effective against a wide variety of bacteria and have been extensively studied due to their potent bactericidal activity.168 In 2016, Rasool and his colleagues169 conducted the first study exploring the antibacterial activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene. They found that this MXene exhibited strong antibacterial activity against multiple bacterial strains, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus. The study results preliminarily demonstrated the feasibility of antibacterial application of MXene, and speculated that its antibacterial mechanism might be related to the physical disruption of the bacterial cell membrane by MXene. Nowadays, the high-efficiency photothermal conversion performance of MXenes provides more ideas for antibacterial applications.
Zhang et al.132 prepared Ti3C2MXene/ZIF-8 (zinc-based organometallic framework)/PLA (polylactic acid) nanofiber membranes (MZ-8) for antibacterial experiments. Its antibacterial effects on E. coli and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are shown in Fig. 14. As shown in the figure, upon irradiating bacteria with NIR radiation the fluorescence changes from green to red within 5 min, achieving a bacterial inhibition rate of 99.9%. This is attributed to the photothermal conversion of the material, which increases the temperature to 50 °C and damages the bacterial cells.

Recently, Li et al.138 developed a Ti3C2Tx MXene@PVA hydrogel for antimicrobial application and wound repair (Fig. 15e and f). The hydrogel presented excellent mechanical properties. The hydrogel was heated to a maximum of 48.6 °C after NIR light irradiation for 10 min. MXene@PVA hydrogel showed over 90% kill rate against both E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 15a–d).

In addition, Gao et al.141 first explored the size-dependent photothermal antibacterial activity of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets against MRSA. As shown in Fig. 15g, the antimicrobial phototherapeutic efficacy of Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets is size-dependent. Three MXene suspensions, small size 196 nm (MX-s), medium size 347 nm (MX-m), and large size 497 nm (MX-l), were prepared by sonication. The temperature of MXene suspensions (10 μg mL−1) of MX-s, MX-m, and MX-l was increased to 64, 60, and 56 °C, respectively, after 5 min of NIR irradiation. Thus, the activity loss of MRSA induced by NIR was 93%, 69%, and 56% for MX-s, MX-m, and MX-l, respectively. Moreover, Hsu et al.143 conducted antibacterial research by constructing a heterojunction of Cu2O and Ti3C2, indicating that both the local photothermal conversion and the sharp edge of MXenes themselves had a synergistic effect on the destruction of the bacterial cell membrane. Jin and his colleagues170 controllably constructed a sandwich structure composed of plasmonic excitations (Ti3C2Tx MXene) on a wide-band-gap semiconductor (TiO2) and photosensitizer (PANi (Ni-phytate)), named PANi/TiO2/Ti3C2Tx (PTM). This structure can achieve bidirectional transmission of hot electrons under the irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared light, significantly increasing the carrier concentration on the TiO2 surface, with its PCE reaching as high as 43.3%. The sterilization effect on E. coli under 808 nm NIR radiation can reach 99.9%. Fang et al.171 successfully synthesized MXene@AgPd/polydopamine (PDA) nanosheets with excellent PCE through a simple redox-oxidative polymerization method. The inherent antibacterial effect of Ag, combined with the synergistic effect of photothermal conversion, significantly enhances the antibacterial effect. Furthermore, more antibacterial applications of MXenes can be found in Table 2.
In conclusion, there are still some issues with the antibacterial applications of MXene based on photothermal conversion. The most significant of these is that its biosafety needs further research. Although the biocompatibility of MXene has been somewhat confirmed, its long-term safety in the body, metabolism, and chronic toxicity, among other things, need further exploration. Despite this, the prospects for antibacterial applications of MXene based on photothermal conversion remain broad.
5. Issues and challenges
Although the current research on MXenes is in full swing, and the biomedical application research of their high-efficiency photothermal conversion is also increasing, the following problems and challenges still remain to be addressed to promote the practical applications of MXene materials.
5.1. The problem of scale production
The scalability of the material is the key question in determining its market potential. Current research tends to involve fluorine-containing solutions to etch precursors to prepare MXenes. However, large-scale production of MXenes with this method will bring the problems of environmental pollution, and the consistency of etching. Shuck and colleagues172 first tried and reported the production of MXenes on a large scale and they etched 50 g of Ti3AlC2 in a single pass using HF/LiF. This was an excellent attempt, while it was still far from real scale production. Zhang et al.173 obtained large-size MXene films by etching large-size MAX precursors and then coating the obtained MXenes onto large-size substrates using the scraping method. However, the method of preparing MXene in this work was to select a larger MAX precursor, fine-tune the etching conditions (used a 12 to 1 molar ratio of LiF to Ti3AlC2 in 9 mol HCl solution and etching was carried out at 50 °C with constant stirring for 30 h), slightly improve the etching efficiency and yield, and then coat the film by the scraping method to make the film size as large as possible, but this was not a true scale preparation of MXenes. Deng et al.174 prepared 575 cm2 2D MXene films by simple electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which took only 10 min. The preparation equipment and MXene membrane are shown in Fig. 16. In addition, Eom et al.175 also tried to prepare MXene membranes on a scale using electrostatic spinning method. The membranes they prepared presented high electrical conductivity. However, the slurries used in the MXene films were all obtained by etching the MAX precursors by traditional methods. Essentially, this preparation was more like improving the utilization of MXene materials, rather than preparing MXenes on a large scale.

There is still a long way to go for the large-scale preparation of MXene materials. One challenge with bottom–up preparation methods is the limitation imposed by the substrate size which can hinder large-scale production. At present, most of the large-scale production attempts are top–down preparation methods. Among them, the etching method needs to overcome the problems of environmental pollution, etchant corrosion of containers, and ensuring uniformity in the etching process. In short, the most promising method for achieving large-scale production of MXenes may be the electrochemical etching method.
5.2. Anti-oxidation issues
There are many factors affecting the oxidation of MXenes, and the oxidation rate of MXenes with different compositions is different. Specifically, the oxidation of MXenes is related to their composition, morphology, and storage conditions. It is believed that creating an environment of low temperature, dryness, and saturated argon would be beneficial in inhibiting the oxidation of MXenes.176
However, the oxidation of MXenes should be considered not only in storage, but also in use. The low temperature and dry conditions could not guarantee the normal use. It has been reported that the combination of MXenes with various oxidants such as sodium ascorbate177 and polyanion salts178 exhibited good antioxidant effects, but the amount of these antioxidants was often more than that of MXenes, which seriously hindered the performance of MXenes. Therefore, it is also necessary to find more anti-oxidation methods and antioxidants for MXenes.
5.3. Photothermal conversion mechanism and other issues
Currently, the photothermal conversion mechanism of MXenes is generally considered to be the LSPR effect. However, when MXenes are integrated with other materials, the photothermal conversion mechanism of composite materials may be more complicated. First, the research on the photothermal conversion mechanism of MXenes and their composites is not enough. Second, the mechanism for interpreting the applications of photothermal conversion is not enough. For example, most of the current reports on the mechanism of photothermal conversion application of MXenes in drug delivery only consider the drug release effect induced by temperature rise, without further exploring whether there are other effects on the drug. For another example, Janus particles were often studied for photothermal conversion-driven drug delivery. The principle was to use the asymmetric photothermal response of Janus particles to form a thermal gradient near the particles to promote their movement. Janus particles were particles with multiple surface areas, which exhibited different properties or asymmetric distributions.179 MXenes can be applied as a Janus material through surface engineering design (see 2.4.2 for details); thus, it is significant to apply the MXenes for photothermal self-driven drug loading. Also, whether photothermal conversion is helpful for MXenes to allow the movement of drugs remains to be demonstrated first.
In addition, the current application of photothermal conversion in biomedicine is mostly focused on Ti3C2Tx, and the application of various types of MXenes in biomedicine is worth exploring. What is more, the structure of different MXenes and the regulation effects of surface functional groups on photothermal conversion also need to be further explored.
6. Summary and outlook
This article summarizes the advances in biomedical applications of MXenes with photothermal conversion properties. We present the current preparation methods of MXenes, the mechanisms of photothermal conversion, and their applications in four fields of biomedicine, including PTT for tumor treatment, drug delivery, PA imaging, and antibacterial fields. The latest research progress in these fields has been demonstrated and summarized. As a promising two-dimensional material, MXenes have many types and complex structures. Based on previous reports, we can conclude that the high performance of MXenes with photothermal conversion properties and their applications may be related to their structure, transition metal type and different composite materials. It is summarized as follows:
Structure: the structure of MXenes has a significant impact on their performance in different applications. For PTT and PA imaging, thinner MXenes may have higher PCE and stronger PA signal. For example, the photothermal conversion efficiency of Ti3C2 is 50.8%, while the photothermal conversion efficiency of Ti3C2 QDs can be increased to 52.2%.125,134 For drug delivery, thinner, smaller MXenes may have a higher drug-carrying capacity due to their larger specific surface area. In addition, the shape and size of MXenes may also affect their drug delivery properties, such as the release rate and biocompatibility. For antimicrobial applications, smaller MXenes have the advantage of exposing more edges, increasing the likelihood of contact with microbial cells, physically disrupting bacterial cell membranes in synergy with photothermal conversion to enhance antimicrobial efficacy.
Transition metals: the type of transition metals in MXenes also plays a key role in their performance in different applications. Different transition metals such as Ti, V, Nb, and Mo may lead to different light absorption properties and thermal stabilities. For example, the same structure of V2C and Nb2C in Table 2 has a difference of nearly one-third in PCE, which may affect their performance in PTT, PA imaging, and antimicrobial applications. For drug delivery, different transition metals may lead to different drug adsorption and release properties.
Composites: MXenes compounded with different materials can improve their biocompatibility and stability, while also modulating their light absorption properties, thus affecting their performance in applications such as PTT, PA imaging, drug delivery and antimicrobial fields. Certain cladding materials (e.g., Ag) may have their own antimicrobial activity, further enhancing the antimicrobial properties of MXenes. However, the photothermal conversion effect of different composites on MXenes varies significantly, for example, the PCE of Fe-Ti3C2 is only 29.3%, while that of Ti3C2/ZiF-8 is as high as 80.5%, with a difference of nearly three times.132,135
In general, the structure of MXenes, transition metal species and different composites have significant effects on their photothermal properties and performance for various applications. Future research needs to further investigate the influence mechanism of these factors in depth in order to finely tune them and design and prepare MXene materials with better performance to meet the needs of various applications.
Besides, some bottlenecks in the development of MXene materials, such as how to mass-produce them and the oxidation of MXenes, are presented in this paper and some suggestions are made.
In conclusion, there is still a long way to the marketization of MXenes. However, many gratifying results have been achieved so far. Looking forward to the future, we expect that MXenes will achieve greater advancements in the field of photothermal conversion including understanding of mechanisms, types of materials, applications, preparation and regulation.
