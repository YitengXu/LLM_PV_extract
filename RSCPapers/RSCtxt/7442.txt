    , Accepted 27th April 2011First published on 3rd June 2011AbstractSize-tunable mesoporous spherical TiO2 (MS TiO2) with a surface area of ∼110 m2 g−1 have been prepared through combination of “dilute mixing”-driven hydrolysis of titanium(iv) tetraethoxide and solvothermal treatment. The hierarchically structured MS TiO2 are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen sorption analysis. Using three different MS TiO2 (587, 757, and 1554 nm in diameter) as a scattering overlayer on a transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 film, bi-layered dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been fabricated. Since the MS TiO2 particles are comprised of ∼10 nm nanocrystallites that cluster together to form large secondary spheres, they can function as light scatterers without sacrificing the surface area for dye-uptake. As a result, the present MS TiO2-based cells perform a noticeable improvement in the overall efficiency: maximum 9.37% versus 6.80% for the reference cell made of a TiO2 nanocrystalline film. This extraordinary result is attributed to the dual effects of enhanced dye loading and light scattering.
1. Introduction
With the growing interest in sustainable and renewable energies, solar power is getting more global attention nowadays. However, the expensive cost of producing conventional semiconductor solid-state solar cells limits their feasibility and applications for the electricity generation.1 Since the announcement of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, DSC technology has been regarded as a promising alternative to silicon-based photovoltaics with its prospective of low manufacturing cost and theoretical high efficiency.2
Till now, extensive research has been conducted to improve DSC performances in the field of materials chemistry.3–7 One of the research trends driving innovations in DSCs is the modification of oxide nanostructures. Since the rise of nanotechnologies in the 2000s, various oxide systems have been proposed in order to provide an efficient light-to-electric conversion in DSCs.8–11 However, traditional anatase nanocrystalline TiO2 is still the most convincing material for the photoanode of DSCs. As TiO2 nanoparticles are weak light scatterers in the visible wavelength region, a large portion of the light passes through the TiO2 film. Thus, the scattering particles are generally incorporated into the photoanode to capture the transmitting red and near infrared lights.12,13 Extensive research efforts have been made to understand scattering phenomena on the basis of the Mie and Lorentz theory,14–17 which were verified by experimental approaches in terms of the size or morphology of the particles.18–21 However, large scattering particles usually have a very low surface area and thus do not contribute much to the enhancement of the dye-loading capacity, thereby limiting the cell efficiency.22
Recently, considerable results were achieved with hierarchically structured oxide materials that include ZnO aggregates,23 nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2,24 and meso or nanoporous TiO2 beads.25–27 These porous spherical structures are composed of nano-crystallites that cluster together to form larger secondary particles, thereby functioning as light scatterers without sacrificing the internal surface area needed for effective dye-uptake. Owing to their dual effects of photocurrent generation as well as light scattering, these hierarchically structured particles are expected to be used as an efficient scattering layer combined with a transparent nanoparticle underlayer in the working electrode of a DSC. In spite of this expectation, however, little progress has been made in the practical implementation of the dual effects in DSCs by tailoring morphology in terms of tunable pore or particle sizes.
Herein we present a new approach of implementing the dual effects in high-performance DSCs by suitably combining the hierarchically structured mesoporous TiO2 overlayer with the nanocrystalline TiO2 underlayer. For this, we have developed a new synthetic route that can produce mesoporous spherical anatase TiO2 (MS TiO2) having tunable secondary particle diameters (ranging from 587 to 1554 nm) together with controlled internal pore sizes (∼10 nm for all samples) through the controlled-sol–gel and a subsequent solvothermal process. The bi-layered DSC made of the MS TiO2 overlayer (with the diameter 587 nm) exhibits a remarkable improvement in the power conversion efficiency: 9.37% versus 6.80% for the reference cell made of a TiO2 nanocrystalline film. We attribute this observation to the dual effects of high dye loading and enhanced optical scattering.
2. Experimental
2-1. Materials
The chemicals used in the synthesis were titanium(IV) tetraethoxide (TTE, technical grade, Sigma-Aldrich), hexadecylamine (HDA, 90%, Sigma-Aldrich), absolute ethanol (99.9% Samchun), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%, Kanto Chemical), deionized water (18.0 MΩ cm), cis-bis(isothiocyanato)-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II)bis tetrabutylammonium (N-719 dye, Solaronix), acetontrile (99.5%, Aldrich), valeronitrile (99.5%, Aldrich), iodine (I2, 99.99%, Aldrich) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII, 95%, Tokyo Chemical Industry), guanidinium thiocyanate (GSCN, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 99%, Aldrich). Commercial nanoparticle paste (T20/SP, Solaronix) and scattering particle paste (R/SP, Solaronix) were used to fabricate the photoelectrode.
2-2. Mesoporous spherical TiO2 preparation
The size-tunable MS TiO2 was prepared by a two-step synthesis: “dilute mixing”-driven hydrolysis and a subsequent solvothermal treatment (see electronic supplementary information (ESI) †). Firstly, 4.28 g of TTE and 1.66 g of HDA were dissolved in 125 mL ethanol, and 0.900 mL, 1.237 mL, 1.575 mL of 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution in a separate 125 mL ethanol. The amorphous TiO2 powders were obtained by mixing two diluted ethanol solutions at room temperature. Depending on the molar concentration of water to TTE, the monodisperse precipitates were prepared with three different sizes. The amorphous TiO2 particles were washed with ethanol by repeating centrifugation (3700 rpm) and sonication. Then they were dispersed in a mixture of 96 mL ethanol and 48 mL water. Finally, the mixture underwent autocalving at 160 °C for 16 h, resulting in the size-tunable MS TiO2 (T1, T2, and T3). To prepare the screen-printing paste, ethyl cellulose and alpha-terpineol were mixed with the MS TiO2 particles. Then the residual solvent in the mixture was removed by using a rotary evaporator to produce a viscous paste.
2-3. Cell fabrication
For working electrodes, a 12.4 μm thick nanocrystalline TiO2 (NC) film was screen-printed on the transparent F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrate, and approximately 7 μm thick films made of commercial 400 nm sized TiO2 scattering particle film (R), and three MS TiO2 films were deposited as overlayers on the NC underlayers to construct four distinct bi-layer structures as shown in Fig. 1(NC-R, NC-T1, NC-T2, and NC-T3). The films were heated at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. The counter electrode was prepared by dripping a Pt solution (Solaronix, Platisol T) on the FTO glass, which was followed by thermal treatment at 500 °C for 30 min. For the cell assembly, a hot-melt 60 μm thick Surlyn (Solaronix, Meltonix 1170–60) was used as a spacer between the working electrode and the Pt electrode. 0.03 M I2, 0.7 M BMII, 0.5 M TBP, and 0.1 M GSCN were dissolved in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85/15, v/v) in order to make the electrolyte.

2-4. Characterization
The morphology of the MS TiO2 was characterized by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7401F). SEM images were taken under a high vacuum with platinum coating on the samples. X-ray diffraction (Rigaku RINT 2000 with Cu Kα ray) was carried out in order to investigate the phase of each sample and to calculate the crystallite size from Scherrer's equation. The nitrogen sorption isotherms were measured by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. The I–V curves were obtained with a Keithley 2400 model as a source measurement unit. One sun of light (100 mW cm−2) was simulated using an Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was adjusted with a NREL-calibrated silicon standard cell to obtain AM 1.5 one sun condition. The IPCE values were recorded as a function of the wavelength from 350 nm to 850 nm (PV Measurements, Inc). A 75 W Xenon lamp was used as a light source with a monochromator. Calibration was performed with a NIST-calibrated photodiode G425 as a reference. The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lamda 750S). For the estimation of the dye-loading capacity, the dye attached onto the TiO2 electrode was dissolved in a 0.1 M NaOH solution of water and ethanol (50/50, v/v), and its absorption property was characterized using a UV-Vis spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Lamda 750S).
3. Results and discussion
Size-tunable MS TiO2 was synthesized by the hydrolysis of titanium tetraethoxide (TTE) and a subsequent solvothermal process.25,28 “Dilute mixing” was designed for the sol–gel process, based on the procedure reported by Barringer et al.,29 where the mixing method played a key role in producing fairly monodisperse amorphous TiO2 beads of different sizes along with the [water]/[TTE] ratio. It was observed that the average particle diameter decreased as the water concentration increased at a fixed TTE concentration and the smooth surface of the TiO2 beads became highly porous after the solvothermal treatment. Fig. 2a–c shows the microstructures of the MS TiO2 particles with three different diameters (1554 nm for T1, 757 nm for T2, and 587 nm for T3). The primary particles constructing T1, T2, and T3 interestingly have similar sizes of around 10 nm (insets of Fig. 2a–c). Fig. 2d presents a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a MS TiO2 particle (T3) which has been sliced to a thickness of 150 nm by using a focused ion beam method.30 It can be seen that each MS TiO2 particle has an interconnected mesoporous network composed of ∼10 nm sized nanocrystallites.

XRD patterns indicate that three different MS TiO2 particles are in the anatase phase after the solvothermal process and calcination (Fig. 3). The crystalline sizes of T1, T2 and T3 were determined from the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the anatase (101) peak by the Scherrer equation. The diameter of the TiO2 nanocrystals is about 9 nm for all three samples, which is in an agreement with the SEM analysis. Nitrogen sorption experiments were conducted to characterize the surface area and the pore size distribution (Fig. 4). Type IV isotherms and H1 hysteresis are shown at high relative pressures (P/Po = 0.8–0.9) for samples T1, T2, and T3, implying the presence of mesopores in the TiO2 particles. The physical properties of each MS TiO2 particle are listed in Table 1. The specific surface areas of T1, T2, and T3 are 117.8, 115.9, and 110.6 m2 g−1, respectively, as obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurement. The pore size distribution was derived from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model and indicated that T1, T2, and T3 had almost the same pore diameters of ∼8.5 nm.

The light scattering effect was quantified by measuring the diffuse reflectance spectra of (i) 20 nm sized nanocrystalline TiO2 (Solaronix T20/SP, labeled NC), (ii) commercial 400 nm sized TiO2 scattering particle film (Solaronix R/SP, labeled R), and (iii) the as-prepared three MS TiO2 films (T1, T2, and T3). The film R showed the highest reflectance among the five films studied. T3, T2, and T1 ranked behind R but still exhibited much higher reflectance than the film NC (Fig. 5a). The optical scattering can be explained in terms of the Mie theory, implying that there is an optimal particle size that maximizes the diffused reflection capacity in the visible light region.31 As illustrated in the reflectance spectra, the scattering intensity increases as the MS TiO2 particle size decreases.

The diffuse reflectance spectra take on a new aspect after the sensitization with N-719 (Fig. 5b) because they are strongly affected by the amount of adsorbed dye which depends largely on the oxide surface area. The greater the surface area of the TiO2 particles, the more dye molecules are adsorbed onto its surface, thus less reflectance will be shown. The reflectance of the sensitized films is drastically reduced at ∼520 nm, the maximum absorption peak of N-719 dye, but is scarcely influenced in the long wavelength region (between 600 and 800 nm). The reflectance lowering caused by the dye adsorption is in good agreement with the surface area calculated from the BET analysis. As the T1, T2, and T3 particles have surface areas of ∼115 m2 g−1, they are able to hold a much larger amount of sensitizers than the R particle does, which supports a significant decrease in the reflectance observed in the T1, T2, and T3 films.
As the next step, five distinct photoanodes have been prepared to investigate the size effect of the spherical MS TiO2 particles on the photovoltaic performance, in comparison to the traditional devices prepared with and without a scattering layer. For this, a 12.4 μm thick NC film was prepared, and approximately 7 μm thick films composed of R, T1, T2, and T3 were used as overlayers on the NC underlayers to construct four distinct bi-layer structures (NC-R, NC-T1, NC-T2, and NC-T3) in DSCs. Fig. 6 shows I–V curves of DSCs for five different working electrodes. In Table 2, photovoltaic properties are compared with the corresponding dye-loading capacity of each working electrode. The results suggest that the dye-loading capacity is closely correlated with the photocurrent generation.

Since the nanocrystalline TiO2 is too small to scatter visible light, the NC cell shows the lowest overall efficiency (η) of 6.80% with a photocurrent density (Jsc) as low as 11.2 mA cm−2. By adding a diffusing layer onto the NC film to make the NC-R device, Jsc is significantly enhanced to 14.1 mA cm−2 with a Voc (open-circuit voltage) value of 856 mV and η of 8.20%, which can be attributed to the improved light confinement within the photoanode. However, the introduction of large particles into the photoelectrode should limit the Jsc value because of the insufficient surface area. One way to overcome this problem is to introduce a porous spherical structure as an alternative scattering layer. It is clear that the MS TiO2 films contribute both to the high dye loading and the optical confinement effect, thereby increasing Jsc and the power conversion efficiency. In spite of the similar specific surface area of ∼115 m2 g−1, the dual effects seem to exhibit a meaningful difference depending on the diameter of the MS TiO2. The highest efficiency of 9.37% was achieved with the NC-T3 cell, compared with 9.04% for the NC-T2 and 8.93% for the NC-T1 cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the T3 overlayer provides the optimal dual effects of the highest dye loading and optical enhancement, resulting in a noticeable improvement in Jsc and η among the MS TiO2-based devices.
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra offer detailed information on the light harvest of the DSCs (Fig. 7). The dye-loading capacity of each photoelectrode is reflected on the corresponding IPCE in the shorter wavelength region, while the light scattering efficiency can be explained by the IPCE value in the longer wavelength region. It is observed that the overall IPCE increases considerably by the introduction of a scattering layer, and the MS TiO2 films possess higher IPCE values than the commercial scattering-particle film over the whole spectral range.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the MS TiO2 particles with tunable sizes (from 587 to 1554 nm) have been prepared by suitably exploiting a two-step synthetic route. The size dependence of the MS TiO2 particles on the overall conversion efficiency of DSCs has been studied. As compared with the reference cell composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 film, DSCs made with three different MS TiO2 overlayers exhibited a remarkable improvement in the power conversion efficiency, owing to the promotion of both light scattering and photocurrent generation. It has been shown that both the diffused reflection intensity and the dye-loading capacity increase with decreasing size of the MS TiO2. Accordingly, the best dual effects of the highest dye loading and optical enhancement was demonstrated in the NC-T3 bi-layer cell, resulting in the maximum conversion efficiency of 9.37% (versus 9.04% for NC-T2 and 8.93% for NC-T1).

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  A schematic of the cell structure consisting of the nanocrystalline TiO2 (NC) underlayer and the size-tunable mesoporous spherical TiO2 (MS TiO2) overlayer.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM images of the MS TiO2 having a diameter of (a) 1554 nm (T1), (b) 757 nm (T2), and (c) 587 nm (T3). Each inset shows a single particle at × 100000 magnification. (d) TEM image of a sliced MS TiO2 particle (T3).	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the MS TiO2 beads with three different diameters (samples T1, T2, and T3, color online).	 

 	Fig. 4  Nitrogen sorption isotherms of the MS TiO2 beads with three different diameters (samples T1, T2, and T3). The isotherms of T2 and T3 are shifted by 100 and 200 cm3 g−1, respectively, for the sake of clear presentation. The inset shows the pore size distributions of the three samples (color online).	 


T1	117.8	8.61	8.93	1554
T2	115.9	8.39	8.77	757
T3	110.6	8.57	9.21	587

 	Fig. 5  Diffuse reflectance spectra of the nanocrystalline (NC) TiO2, Solaronix light scattering TiO2 particle (R), and three MS TiO2 films (T1, T2, and T3) without (a) and with (b) the dye sensitization (color online).	 

 	Fig. 6  
I–V curves of DSCs based on the bi-layer structure of NC-R, NC-T1, NC-T2, and NC-T3. These curves are compared with the I–V curve of the NC-based DSC (marked with pink circles, color online).	 

NC	12.4	11.2 ± 0.1	856 ± 0.1	70.9 ± 0.2	6.80 ± 0.06	1.036
NC-R	20.0	14.1 ± 0.0	856 ± 0.2	68.0 ± 0.3	8.20 ± 0.07	1.146
NC-T1	19.7	14.7 ± 0.1	844 ± 0.3	72.0 ± 0.2	8.93 ± 0.06	1.822
NC-T2	19.9	15.5 ± 0.1	832 ± 0.2	70.1 ± 0.1	9.04 ± 0.04	2.096
NC-T3	19.9	15.9 ± 0.1	826 ± 0.3	71.3 ± 0.3	9.37 ± 0.05	2.225

 	Fig. 7  IPCE spectra of DSCs made with NC, NC-R, NC-T1, NC-T2, and NC-T3 (color online).
