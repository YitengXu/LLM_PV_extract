    , Accepted 22nd March 2021First published on 26th March 2021AbstractEu3+-Activated double and triple phosphates were synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state reaction. These phosphors were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and photoluminescence spectra. XRD and FTIR analysis indicated that the prepared phosphors crystallized as a single-phase component. The present investigation aimed to analyze the influence of europium-activated hosts on luminescence sensitivity in a Ca3(PO4)2 principal host. Under UV light excitation, the phosphors show bright red emission, which is assigned to the transition (5D0 → 7F2) at 612 nm. The crystallographic sites of the Eu3+ ions in the principal host were discussed on the basis of site-selective excitation and emission spectra and the host crystal structure. Upon tuning the host matrices, an outstanding increase in luminescence sensitivity is observed in the present investigation.

1. Introduction
In recent years, luminescent phosphor materials have shown promise in solid-state lighting and display applications due to their prospective utilization in the fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solid-state display devices.1 For the manufacturing of quality phosphor materials (luminescent phosphors) activated with lanthanide ions, the selection of an appropriate host is a very important factor to consider. Consequently, considerable effort must be expended in the production and characterization of luminescent phosphor materials. Calcium phosphates activated with lanthanides ions are of great interest to numerous investigators because of their excellent chemical and optical properties. A multitude of solid solutions encompassing these elements have been described in the literature. Most have been comprehensively used as a host lattice for luminescent applications.2 The Sb3+- and Mn2+-co-doped calcium phosphates Ca5(PO4)3X:Sb3+,Mn2+ (X = F, Cl) are outstanding examples, and are well-known phosphors in luminescent applications.3 In recent times, W-LED phosphors such as (M1,M2)10(PO4)6X2 (M1 = Ca, Sr, Ba; M2 = Eu, Mn; X = F, Cl, Br) have become promising candidates that are popularly used in luminescent applications. Ca5(PO4)3F:Tb3+ was examined as a suitable green phosphor in plasma display panel devices (PDPs).4,5 Moreover, a literature survey reveals that M5(PO4)3F:Dy3+,Na+ (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) has been considered for use in Hg-free lamps.6
In the area of vanadate-based phosphors, increasing attention is being paid to the innovation and progress in novel materials that emit white light with extraordinary UV absorption to emit in the red region.3,7,8 Additionally, new compounds designed by the grouping of tetrahedral [MoO4, WO4, PO4 and VO4] units are outstanding host matrices for phosphors due to their excellent chemical and thermal stability.9 The stability of a host matrix is dynamic, depending upon the structural behavior of each metal atom coordinated to oxygen atoms and tetrahedral distortions.10 Tungstates doped with trivalent lanthanide ions (RE3+) are widely recognized to be useful materials with unique physical and chemical assets.11 The incorporation of sulfur atoms into a phosphor host activated with rare earth ions usually serves to illuminate the structure of the naturally occurring phosphor hosts or potential applications to control optical and electrical properties by varying the ionic conductivity.12 The composition Na3Ca2(SO4)3(OH) has been reported. It shows typical features of the apatite structure, and the symmetry reduction from the centrosymmetric space group P63/M to the non-centrosymmetric space group P6 indicates the formation of multiple luminescence centers arising from independent crystallographic sites.13 Knyazev et al.14 reported compounds of the composition Na3Ca2(SO4)3F, Na3Cd2(SO4)3Cl, and Na3Pb2(SO4)3Cl prepared via solid-state reactions. Nikhare et al.15 prepared the phosphor Na3Ca2(SO4)3F:Ce3+via a solid-state method; this phosphor shows a single intense luminescence emission peak at 307 nm when excited by 278 nm (UV) light.
Poddar et al.16 reported the phosphor K3Ca2(SO4)3F:Ce,Eu, which shows emission at 334 nm when excited at 278 nm; the emission corresponds to the 5d → 4f transition of the Ce3+ ions. The Eu2+ and Eu3+ phases in this phosphor display emission at 440 nm, and 596 and 615 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 of Eu3+ ion transitions, respectively; these emissions are in the blue and red region of the visible spectrum. A literature survey also reveals the synthesis and optical properties of numerous phosphors involving the combination of 3d-metal ions with hexagonal strontium phosphate (Sr5(PO4)3OH).17 Ca5(PO4)3 and copper-containing vanadates Sr5(VO4)3CuO are formed as co-products in the synthesis of vanadium-doped materials.18,19 Molybdates are vital inorganic compounds and have displayed some outstanding performances in the fields of lasers, solid state lighting, catalysis, and ionic conductors.20,21 Recently, various researchers have concentrated their work on the luminescence properties of molybdates activated with europium ions.22–24 The luminescence behavior of molybdates strongly depends upon structure of the host lattice, and more importantly, molybdates can be present in different crystal phases irrespective of the valence of the molybdenum atoms. The development of phases in the desired structures is determined by the synthesis method, the stoichiometric ratio of the preparatory materials, the pH value of the system and the reaction kinetics. In recent times, molybdates have been extensively considered as host candidates for white LEDs. However, few studies have examined the luminescence properties of (MoO4)-based phosphors.25 In this work, we discuss the luminescence behavior of Ca(PO4)X−1(MoO4)X, Ca1−X−YSrYMoO4, and Ca1−X−YBaYMoO4 activated with Eu3+ ions and compare their emission intensity. Their concentration and luminescence quenching behavior are also investigated.
The Eu3+ ion is a significant activator for phosphor hosts because it exhibits excitation due to intraconfigurational 4f–4f transitions and can produce emission while located in a non-centrosymmetric site. Thus, many materials doped with Eu3+ can be used as red phosphors and have potential application in color television displays.26 The emission wavelength is around 615 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F2 forced electric dipole transition of Eu3+ ions, and correspondingly, it gives strong emission at around 595 nm due to the 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic dipole transition of Eu3+ ions. Both the emissions correspond to the splitting of Eu3+ ions with the host materials at subsequent equilibrium behavior. Consequently, it is obvious that the position of the emission lines in the spectrum arises from the splitting of the activator in the host.27 Consequently, in the present study, numerous secondary hosts, such as sulphate (SO4), vanadate (WO4), molybdenate (MoO4), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) have been incorporated in the principal Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor host and activated with europium rare earth ions. As a part of our study, detailed investigations of the structural, morphological and luminescence behavior have been carried out. Furthermore, the incorporation of other lanthanide ions such as Dy, Ce, Mn, Tb, and Gd in the present host and their detailed optical examination are under investigation and proposed for a forthcoming study.
2. Experimental
A series of Eu3+-doped Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors with different concentrations of Eu3+ ions were synthesized by a solid-state synthesis method. In this procedure, we first weighed the starting materials for the phosphor samples as per the stoichiometric calculations for different concentrations of Eu3+ ions, i.e., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 mol%. For the preparation of this series, each sample was crushed for 30 min and then heated in a muffle furnace at a temperature of 400 °C for 2 h. After this, the obtained sample was again crushed for 10 min and finally heated for 24 hours at 800 °C. This is the final form of the phosphor samples, and the optimum photoluminescence (PL) intensity was produced at a 0.5 mol% concentration of Eu3+ ions. After this, we replaced PO4 with WO4, SO4, and MoO4 to produce the new series Ca3(PO4)2(1−X)(M)X:1 mol% Eu3+ (i.e., M = WO4, SO4, MoO4 and X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1) by using a fixed concentration of 0.5 mol% of Eu3+ ions and repeating the same procedures. In this series, the complete replacement of MoO4 with PO4 enhanced the PL emission intensity compared to the primary series. Next, keeping the Eu3+ ion concentration constant and using MoO4, we further replaced Ca with Sr and Ba to synthesize a new series, viz. Ca1−YAYMoO4:0.5 mol% Eu3+ where A = Sr and Ba and Y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 by repeating the same procedure.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD pattern crystallographic information for the pure Ca3(PO4)2 host and doped Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2AX:X mol% of Eu3+
All the prepared samples, including pure Ca3(PO4)2 hosts and doped Ca3(PO4)2:Eu3+ are white powders. The XRD patterns of the phosphors are shown in Fig. 1. It can be perceived from the curves that the majority of the peaks can be indexed to the Ca3(PO4)2 phase, which is in good agreement and matched well with the standard PDF card numbered 702065. By matching the diffractograms, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample confirms a single phase isotopic with Ca3(PO4)2. It can be established that the obtained phases are iso-structural. Due to the similarity of the ionic radii (ionic radius of Eu3+ = 1.07 Å and Ca2+ = 1.12 Å),28 it is specifically expected that trivalent europium shares the same sites as divalent calcium. Accordingly, the incorporation of Eu3+ ions does not considerably influence the XRD pattern of the Ca3(PO4)2 host. Nevertheless, the existence of five probable sites makes it interesting to estimate its dissemination in the crystal structure, which is a vital point with respect to its optical properties. However, the density of electrons in trivalent europium is higher than that of calcium. To validate the statement, the crystal structure of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor was refined using the Rietveld refinement method.29 The FullProf Suite was used to refine the structure using the pseudo-Voigt peak profile function and linear interruption of the background.30–32Fig. 1(b) depicts the observed and calculated powder XRD profiles resulting from the Rietveld refinement of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor and their difference profile along with the Bragg positions. The consistency of the factors, along with the factors Rwp = 15.34, Rp = 7.68, Rexp = 10.41 and χ2 = 1.83, indicated the fulfilment of the manifestation conditions. The refinement analysis verifies that the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with the space group P21/c and lattice parameters a = 12.887 Å, b = 27.280 Å, c = 15.219 Å and α = 90.00°, β = 126.20°, γ = 90.00°. The volume of the unit cell is 4317.52 Å3. Table 1 lists the structural parameters of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor obtained from the Rietveld refinement. Fig. 2 shows the crystal structure of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor obtained from Rietveld refinement.

The average Ca–O bond distance was calculated for each a site and compared with the value expected from the ionic radius. The ionic radii used for a depended on the CN, with 6:r(Ca[6]) = 1.00, r(Ca[7]) = 1.06, (Ca[8]) = 1.12, r(Ca[9]) = 1.18 and r(O[4]) = 1.38 Å. The expected Ca–O distance increased linearly with increasing CN of Ca. The average Ca–O distances at the Ca(1), Ca(2), and Ca(3) sites obtained in the present structural analysis agreed well with the expected values. The average Ca(5)–O distance calculated from the refined crystal structure was smaller than the expected value, corresponding to a high bond valence sum (BVS) value of 2.7. On the contrary, the observed average Ca(4)–O distance was much larger than the expected value, corresponding to a lower BVS value of 0.7 for the Ca(4) site. The larger Ca(4)–O distance suggests weak bonding between the oxygen and Ca(4) atoms accompanied by a low occupation rate of 0.43 at the Ca(4) site. Thus, possible explanations for the larger isotropic thermal parameter and the deficiency at Ca(4) are the longer Ca(4)–O bond distances and the small CN value at Ca(4). These results indicate that the Ca(4) site is very different from the other four Ca sites: the Ca(4) has a lower occupancy factor of 0.43(4), a higher isotropic thermal parameter, a small BVS value, small CN and longer Ca–O distances.33
3.2 SEM
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) offers a significant ability to characterize the materials and to obtain the information about the morphology, size distribution and shape of the synthesized phosphors, and furthermore plays a significant role in optical investigations of any luminescent phosphor.34
The SEM images of Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors prepared by solid-state diffusion are given in Fig. 3, and confirm that the samples had a high particle density. The SEM images shown in Fig. 3 revealed well-defined particles with an irregular accumulated morphology, consisting of many spherical-shaped particles with clustering. The size of the phosphor particles was in the range of 5–10 μm, and twinning was common between agglomerates.
 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor. 
The observed fleecy morphology of the particles is normally acquired from the solid-state synthesis, and the voids are due to the vast amount of gaseous matter that runs away due to the extraordinary exothermicity. Nevertheless, the particles were close to one another through necking, and could be simply crushed to acquire distinct particles. Individual particles exhibited round surfaces and sizes of a few micrometers. The prepared phosphor showed a sintered structure in which the individual particles could barely be distinguished. All these physical observations were advantageous in terms of the application of the material as a phosphor powder for coating purposes in the manufacture of white LEDs.35
3.3 FTIR spectroscopy of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor
The many forms of calcium phosphates can be determined by their Ca/P molar ratio using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From a chemistry point of view, they are composed of three fundamental elements: calcium, phosphorus and oxygen. Numerous calcium phosphates incorporate hydrogen to form an acidic phosphate anion (for example, HPO42−), hydroxyl groups (for example, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), or in the form of bonded water (for example, CaHPO4·2H2O).
In order to study the molecular and structural environment of the titular phosphor, its FTIR spectrum in the range 4000–500 cm−1 was recorded at room temperature using a PerkinElmer Spectrum GX FT-IR/FT-Raman spectrometer with 40 scans and a resolution of 4.0 cm−1 using Ca3(PO4)2 pellets. The distribution of the frequencies of the bands and their wavenumber are strongly influenced by the nature of the local symmetry of the PO4 anion. The FTIR spectrum of the synthesized phosphor (Fig. 4) exhibits absorption bands corresponding to PO4 chemical functional groups.
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectrum of Ca3(PO4)2. 
The bands at around 400–700 cm−1 provide confirmation of the deformation of the PO4 groups. The infrared bands of Ca3(PO4)2 (Fig. 4) are distributed in four characteristic wavenumber ranges: 400–645, 720–750, 850–990, and 990–1400 cm−1. Likewise, in the infrared spectrum, the observation of (PO3) frequencies indicates that the [PO4] band adopts a twisted structure. One high-frequency IR absorption band located at 1226 cm−1 is assigned to the PO4 stretching mode of the ions. Frequencies in the 950–1300 cm−1 region are due to the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations of (PO4)2− groups. The existence of CaO is also confirmed by the wide concentrated absorption band of the [Ca–O] group, which is centered at ∼500 cm−1.36
The absorption peaks at 875, 1085, and 1400 cm−1 prove the existence of [CO3] groups in the phosphors, which consequently indicates the slight carboxylation of Ca(OH)2 from CO2 in the atmosphere. The wide absorption band from 1500–4000 cm−1 proves the presence of adsorbed water molecules in the sample. According to Corbridge et al.,37 the PO4 group can be used to clarify the vibration spectrum by means of the relationship of the vibrations of the PO4 and P–O–P groups. These lead to two orthophosphate (P–O) absorption bands at 1130–1030 cm−1 and 600–560 cm−1. For the present phosphor, these bands are extensive, balanced singlets; however, all crystalline mineral standards show band splitting, particularly in the 600–560 cm−1 region. The degree of reproduction and modification in the spectrum of the phosphates increases as the degree of polymerization rises in the [PO4] tetrahedron.38
3.4 PL investigations

3.4.1 PL excitation spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors. 
The excitation spectrum for the 591 nm orange-red emission of the 1 mol% Eu2O3 in Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor is shown in Fig. 5, and exhibits several absorption bands ranging from 250 to 550 nm. The band peaking at 258 nm is ascribed to O(2p) → Eu3+ charge transfer, which is the key band for UV excitation, especially for use as a phosphor. The fine absorption bands located beyond 350 nm are characteristic of typical Eu3+ 4f–4f parity-forbidden transitions. There are four recognizable excitation peaks at 258, 395, 466 and 536 nm, which cover the 250–550 nm spectral range well, indicating that UV, violet, blue and green laser diodes (LDs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are competent pumping sources for obtaining Eu3+ emission. Moreover, in the present investigation, detailed analysis was carried out by selecting individual excitation peaks to study the effect of the excitation wavelength on the enhancement of the luminescence intensity of the phosphor. It was observed that there was an essential enhancement in the emission intensity of the phosphor host, as described below.

3.4.2 PL emission in Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+. 
The luminescence properties of phosphors activated by trivalent europium ions strongly depend on their valence states. Typically, Eu3+ ions can provide luminescence from orange to red originating from 4f–4f transitions. The PL emission spectrum for the above-mentioned excitation peaks consists of two identical peaks, which is an important point of this work. The first emission peak corresponding to the 5D0 → 7F1 transition of the Eu3+ ion is located at 591 nm (orange), and another intense peak associated with the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of the Eu3+ ion is located at 614 nm (red).
3.4.2.1 PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 258 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 

Fig. 6(a) presents the emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:Eu3+ phosphors excited by 258 nm wavelength light. There are groups of sharp lines assigned to the transitions of the 5D0–7FJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) levels of Eu3+. The emission at approximately 580 nm due to the transition 5D0 → 7F0 is shallow. The emission at 591 nm initiates from the magnetic dipole transition 5D0 → 7F1. The emission corresponding to the 5D0–7F3,4 transitions is feeble. The dominant red emission band at 614 nm is ascribed to the electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2, and demonstrates that Eu3+ is situated at a point without non-inversion site symmetry.39,40

(b) PL emission spectra of the Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 395 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). (c) PL emission spectra of the Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 466 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). (d) PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 536 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 
Commonly, when the Eu3+ ion is situated at a crystallographic site without inversion symmetry, red emission from its hypersensitive transition 5D0–7F2 will dominate in the emission spectrum.41,42 In the Ca3(PO4)2:Eu3+ phosphor, the Eu3+ is substituted into principal host sites because of its valence state and similar size. Consequently, the Eu3+ is positioned at a site without an inversion center. Accordingly, the 5D0–7F2 red emission band at 614 nm presents the most prominent intensity (Fig. 6(a)). With increasing concentration of Eu3+, the luminescence intensity also increases. Fascinatingly, the luminescence intensity of the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors is maximized at 0.5 mol% of Eu3+, and beyond that, it tends to decrease, as shown in Fig. 6(a).
3.4.2.2 PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 395 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 
We carried out a detailed investigation of the emission intensities of present phosphor using varying excitation wavelengths. The PL emission spectrum for the above-mentioned excitation consists of two indistinguishable peaks, the first of which is situated at 591 nm (orange) and results from the 5D0 → 7F1 transition of the Eu3+ ion, and a second intense peak located at 614 nm (red), which is related to the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of the Eu3+ ion, as shown in Fig. 6(b). When the present phosphor is excited at a wavelength of 395 nm, the intensity of orange emission at 591 nm is enhanced 1.4-fold, and that of the red emission at 614 nm is enhanced by 1.3-fold compared to the emission when excited at 258 nm (see Section 3.4.2, Fig. 6(a) and (b)). Thus, we have established that the improved phosphors Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ are potentially useful as phosphors for white-light emitting diodes. The relationship between the Eu3+ emission lines under 258 nm and 395 nm excitation of the phosphor samples reveals strong intensity alternations (Fig. 6(a)). This indicates an alteration of the fraction of the amounts of Eu3+ ions at the different lattice sites in Ca3(PO4)2. The enhancement rate of the intensity of Ca3(PO4)2 is determined by its crystallographic sites, and there is no effective energy transmission from the divalent to the trivalent europium ions.43 The consequence of this is that the emission intensity of the luminescent phosphors depends essentially on the excitation intensity, the density, and the lifetime of the radiative atoms and luminescence centers of the molecules.
3.4.2.3 PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 466 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 
The luminescence emission ability must be considered on an energy and a quantum basis. When every single excited photon produces an emitted photon of identical energy, the luminescence efficacy is 100 percent with respect to the input energy and the number of quanta. When the number of secondary photons is equivalent to that of the principal photons, but their energy is less because some energy is dissipated as heat, the quantum efficiency is 100 percent, but the luminescence efficiency is less than 100 percent. The quantum efficiency of most luminescent phosphors is significantly lower than 100 percent. The luminescence emission spectra of the Eu3+-activated Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors at 466 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 6(c).
When the present phosphors are excited at a wavelength of 466 nm, the intensity of orange emission at 591 nm decreases 1.2-times and that of the red emission at 614 nm is decreased by 1.4-fold compared to their intensities when excited at 258 nm (see Section 3.4.2, Fig. 6(a)).
3.4.2.4 PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors upon excitation at 536 nm (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 
The emission spectra of the Eu3+-activated Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors excited at 536 nm are presented in Fig. 6(d). Careful observation of the emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ reveals that the emission intensity of Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ is much lower that of the Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors excited at 260 nm (see Section 3.4.2, Fig. 6(a)). The present phosphor exhibits emission bands between 400–700 nm under 536 nm excitation. Emission spectra typical of Eu3+ transitions (5D0 → 7F1 at approximately 591 nm and 5D0 → 7F2 at approximately 614 nm) were observed, and we infer that the emission intensity was reduced completely by phonon–phonon interactions. In contrast, the emission intensity was enhanced 1.23-fold compared to that of an Eu3+-activated Ca3(PO4)2 phosphor excited at 466 nm (see Fig. 6(c)). The concentration versus intensity curve of the Ca3(PO4)2:X mol% Eu3+ phosphor shown in Fig. 10 reveals that the maximum emission intensity is observed at 0.5 mol% of Eu3+ ions, and beyond that, it tends to decrease due to the concentration quenching effect.40,44
With variation in the activator concentration, the luminescence properties of the phosphor are affected. Zhang et al. reported that slight incapacitation of the activators due to concentration results in weak luminescence, but if it goes beyond a definite limit, it may lead to luminescence quenching.45 On account of this, in the present case, the luminescence intensity tends to decrease when the content of Eu3+ ions is increased beyond a certain extent, since the distance between Eu3+ ions becomes closer, which results in a higher probability of energy transfer among Eu3+ ions instead of energy transfer from europium to calcium ions in the host lattice. In the present case, the emission intensities of the phosphors vary with the content of Eu3+ ions. As the concentration was increased, the maximum PL intensity was observed at 0.5 mol%, and thereafter, the intensity decreased for 1 mol% as a result of concentration quenching. The spectral shape and peak positions do not have a robust dependence on the activator concentration (Fig. 7). Chen et al. reported that doping with different activator ions is a good method to improve the luminescence properties of phosphorescent materials.46 Shinde and Dhoble47 also reported that the increase in photoluminescence intensity is due to fractional energy transfer from the excited ions to other ions (cross-relaxation between Eu3+ ions), consequently, with increasing concentrations of Eu3+ ions, the number of luminescence centers in the material increases and the corresponding intensity is enriched.48 However, point defects may be increased due to the discrepancy in charges, leading to an ensuing reduction of luminescence intensity via non-radiative transitions. Furthermore, higher concentrations of the activator atoms result in clustering, which leads to the quenching effect and reduced luminescence intensity at higher concentrations. The effect of the concentration of Eu2O3 in the Ca3(PO4)2 phosphors on their relative emission intensity are shown in Fig. 7.

3.4.2.5 Critical transfer distance (Rc) for Ca3(PO4)2:Eu3+ and type of interaction. 
The critical transfer distance (Rc), which is the shortest average distance between the nearest activator Eu3+ ions at the concentration of optimum intensity Xc, is the main factor responsible for the concentration quenching process. Hence, it is essential to determine the critical transfer distance (Rc) to further understand the mechanism of concentration quenching. Blasse pointed out that taking V as the volume of the unit cell, Xc as the optimal concentration, and N as the number of cations in the unit cell, the critical transfer distance can be calculated using the following formula: (1)In the present study, V = 4317.52 Å3, N = 36, and Xc = 0.5. Using these values, we obtain the of critical transfer distance value Rc = 7.7101 Å. The multipolar interactions among Eu3+ ion are effective if the value of Rc is equal to or greater than 5. Since the value of Rc is greater than 5, we thus infer that multipolar interaction is significant and exchange interaction is ineffective. An overview of the critical transfer distances calculated using eqn (1) for all the phosphor series is given in Table 3.

The strength of the multipolar interaction can be estimated from the change in the emission intensity from the emitting level that has the multipolar interaction.49,50 When the concentration of the activator is significantly high, the luminescence intensity I and the activator concentration x are related by the equation, (2)
This equation can be expressed as: (3)where k, β, and c are constants for the same excitation condition for a given host matrix. According to Van Uitert theory, the θ value indicates the electric multipolar character, where θ = 3 for energy transfer via the exchange interaction, θ = 6 for dipole–dipole (d–d) interactions, θ = 8 for dipole–quadrupole (d–p) interactions, and θ = 10 for quadrupole–quadrupole (q–q) interactions.51 The relation between log(x) and log(I/x) is given in Fig. 1. Since the interaction of ions after concentration quenching is more complicated, only three points were used for plotting.52 As seen in the graph, the data was found to fit a straight line. The value of the slope, i.e., , at excitation wavelengths of 258, 395, 466 and 536 nm are given for both the emission wavelengths 591 nm and 614 nm in Fig. 1. Therefore, from Table 4, it can be predicted that the value of θ is nearly equal to 8, and therefore dipole–quadrupole interaction is the dominant interaction responsible for the concentration quenching of Eu3+ emission in the Ca2(PO4)3:X mol% Eu3+ (x = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 mol%) phosphors.

3.4.3 PL emission of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors. 

Fig. 9(a–d) show the PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ powders when excited at 258, 395, 466 and 536 nm at room temperature. The PL emission spectra of the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ powders are dominated by 5D1,0 transitions and do not demonstrate any (5D2) transition, owing to the rapid occurrence of non-radiative relaxation.53 The PL emission spectra demonstrate transitions from the excited state 5D1,0 levels to the ground levels 7FJ for the Eu3+ ions of all the phosphors. Further alterations in the transitions can have a maximum of three (5D0 → 7F1), five (5D0 → 7F2), seven (5D0 → 7F3) and nine (5D0 → 7F4) constituents if the Eu3+ ion is situated with identical symmetry. It is conceivable to examine over and done with 5D0 → 7F0 transitions if the material retains dissimilar luminescent cores; i.e., depending on whether additional emissive sites present or not. In the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ materials, Ca2+ ions are moderately substituted by Eu3+ ions, which results in peak intensities related to the f–f transition at 614 nm, which are associated with Eu3+ ions situated in a site without a center of symmetry.54 The Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors exhibit principal PL emission in the red region (see Fig. 9), which represents the typical electronic transition 5D0 → 7F2 at approximately 614 nm. The overall emission characteristics reveal that Eu3+ ions are an outstanding structural probe to examine the chemical environment.

(a) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 395 nm. (b) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 466 nm. (c) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 536 nm. 

Fig. 9(a–d) demonstrate that all the transitions are characteristic of Eu3+ ions. The PL emission spectra displayed different emission intensities when excited at 258, 395, 466 and 536 nm. However, all the spectra retained identical peak positions for the strong PL emission in the red region at 614 nm, which is associated with the Eu 3+5D0 → 7F2 transition. The PL emission intensity increases significantly when the concentration of Eu ions is kept constant at 0.5 mol% and the concentration of (WO4) is increased to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mol%, with the maximum value being observed at 0.5 mol% followed by a decrease, revealing the occurrence of luminescence quenching, which is triggered by non-radiative transitions and the energy transfer process, independent of the excitation wavelength. Fig. 9(a–d) indicate that the maximum PL emission intensity is observed at a 466 nm excitation wavelength, which is a characteristic of a NUV-excited LED and can be utilized for solid-state lighting.37
3.4.3.1 Critical transfer distance (Rc) for Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+ and type of interaction. 
The intensity of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors decreased after replacing the PO4 ions with WO4 with an X value of 0.5 as shown in Fig. 9. The concentration quenching phenomenon observed here and the energy transfer critical distance calculated here were explained using the same formula and process as for the Ca2(PO4)3:Eu3+ series. The plots of log(x) vs. log(I/x) are displayed in Fig. 10. The slope values for all the excitations are given in Fig. 10. Notably, in this series, the emission peak observed at 614 nm is more intense than the 591 nm emission observed in Fig. 9. Therefore, only one emission, i.e., the emission at 614 nm, has been utilized for the evaluation of the linear plot of log(x) and log(I/x) in the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphor series. The values of θ determined from the linear plots are given in Table 5, and Fig. 10 shows the linear plots of log(x) vs. log(I/x) for the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors. Considering all these statistics, the type of interaction was also determined.

3.4.4 PL investigations of the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors. 
Crystalline phosphors are adequate host constituents for luminescent RE ions, since they present better heat-resistance and a range of luminescence centers compared to other glasses. Sulfate-based phosphors have acknowledged uses in display devices, solid-state lighting, thermoluminescence dosimetry and nanophosphors.55 In recent times, Dhoble–Gedam reported the combination of sulfate-based phosphors and their potential applications in the field of luminescence for solid-state lighting and thermoluminescence dosimetry.56 In the present work, we explore the PL study of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ co-doped phosphors. A series of compounds was synthesized by keeping the concentration of Eu constant at 0.5 mol% and varying the concentration of SO4 from 0.05–1 mol%.

Fig. 11(a–d) show the emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ at λex = 258 nm, 395 nm, 466 nm and 536 nm, respectively. The emission peak at 614 nm resembles the enforced electric dipole 5D0 → 7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions, and predominates over the emission peak at 591 nm that is allocated to the magnetic dipole 5D0 → 7 F1 transition of Eu3+. Both peaks indicate the splitting of Eu3+ ions in the site symmetry with the host materials. Consequently, the situation of the activator is permanent due to the splitting of the activator in the emission centers. The effect of the SO4 concentration on the emission intensity of the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors was correspondingly examined. The emission intensities of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ at different doping concentrations of Eu3+ are shown in Fig. 11(a–d); the (SO4) concentration is varied from 0.05 to 1 mol%. The shape of the emission spectra was similar, and the emission intensity was found to increase with increasing SO4 concentration up to 0.5 mol%. The maximum PL emission intensity was observed for 0.5 mol% of SO4 ions and excitation at 396 nm (see Fig. 11(b)). The excitation at 396 nm is due to intraconfigurational 4f–4f transitions of Eu3+, which is a characteristic of solid-state lighting and NUV-excited LEDs.57

In the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors, two different concentration quenching points were observed for different excitation wavelengths. The interaction responsible for each concentration quenching for the different excitation wavelengths are explained in Table 6. Fig. 12 shows the linear plots of logx vs. log(I/x) for the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors.

3.4.5 PL investigations of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors. 

Fig. 13(a–d) shows the emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ with a constant Eu3+ concentration of 0.5 mol% and varying concentrations of MoO4 (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 mol%) under λex = 258 nm, 395 nm, 466 nm and 536 nm, respectively. The strongest emission peak of Ca(PO4)X−1(MoO4)X:Eu3+ for all the excitation wavelengths is situated at 614 nm and is ascribed to 5D0 → 7F2. The other peaks at 525–550, 551–570, and 571–595 nm are allocated to the 5D1 → 7F1, 5D1 → 7F2, and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions of the Eu3+ ions, respectively. The position and shape of the emission spectra does not vary with the MoO4 ion concentration. Most of the valence electrons of the divalent (MoO4)2− elements are sheltered by the superficial 5s and 5p electrons, and consequently, the f–f transitions of divalent molybdates are weakly exaggerated by the ligand ions in the crystals.58 For this reason, the optical spectra of phosphors doped with divalent molybdates are comparable to those predicted for the permitted ions. Nevertheless, a small number of transitions are sensitive to the atmosphere of the crystal; these are known as hypersensitive transitions. The electric dipole transition 5D0 → 7F2 is hypersensitive. It has been observed that its emission intensity is intensely affected by the ligand ions in the crystals. When the (MoO4)2− ions are positioned at low-symmetry sites, the 5D0 → 7F2 emission transition regularly predominates in the emission spectrum. The 5D0 → 7F1 magnetic dipole transition is independent of the environment, according to Judd–Ofelt theory.59
 Fig. 13  PL emission spectra of Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors (X = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1) at various excitation wavelengths. (a) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 258 nm. (b) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 395 nm. (c) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 466 nm. (d) Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 536 nm. 
In the present study, when (MoO4)2− ions were doped into Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors, the 5D0 → 7F2 emission intensity was more profound than the emission intensity of 5D0 → 7F1, which indicated that the (MoO4)2− ions have no inversion center. Fig. 13(a–d) indicate that the emission ratio is independent of the Eu3+ concentration, which was kept constant at 0.5 mol% in the present study. The maximum emission is found for excitation at 258 and 536 nm for 0.5 mol% of (MoO4)2− ions. However, 258 nm is mercury excitation, which is not suitable for solid-state lighting; therefore, the 536 nm excitation wavelength should be chosen. Using 536 nm excitation, the emission intensity is enhanced 1.9-fold compared to that obtained using 395 nm excitation and 2.17-fold compared with that obtained using 466 nm excitation. Consequently, 536 nm is a suitable excitation wavelength for the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphor, which is characteristic of LED excitation. The excitation peak at 536 nm (see Fig. 5) is due to the 7F0 → 5D1 transition in the green light region; accordingly, the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphor is appropriate for use as a green-LED-excited red phosphor for white lighting devices.60

3.4.6 PL investigations of Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors. 
Molybdates doped with trivalent lanthanide ions (RE3+) are extensively recognized as practical materials having exceptional chemical and physical properties. The physical properties of these materials are strongly reliant on the lattice defects formed when they are activated by additional ions. The modification in the electronic density amongst the dopant and host cations, as well as the transformations in the electronic structures, has been established to be the most important aspect, which includes the manufacturing of luminescence centers. Therefore, the incorporation of trivalent activators within different structures has been studied.61,62 Molybdates retain the structural formula ABO4, where A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Cd, or Pb and B = Mo or W. These compounds crystallize in the (I41/a) space group and have a point symmetry corresponding to C4h6.63 The lattice parameters and unit cell volumes were estimated to be a = b = 0.54168 nm, c = 1.1951 nm and V = 0.35066 nm3, respectively, with four molecules in each crystallographic cell (Z = 4) at normal surroundings. In this structural group, the A2+ ions are bounded by eight neighboring (MoO4)2 tetrahedra in a dodecahedral arrangement, as estimated by the point group symmetry. Trivalent rare earth ions offer promise for the replacement of A-sites with impeccable isostructural conversation. Due to the differences in the valence states and sizes of the Eu3+ (0.107 nm) and (MoO4)2− (0.042 nm) ions, the Eu3+ ion is anticipated to reside in the Sr2+ (0.113 nm) sites.64 This is conceivable, since the electronic densities and coordination numbers of Eu3+ and Sr2+ ions are very comparable.65 When inorganic materials are activated using a certain amount of Eu3+ ions, the resulting product can be used as a prospective phosphor for white light by merging blue-green light with the O → (MoO4)2− charge transfer band (CTB) of the phosphors. Consequently, the main objective of this study was to synthesize calcium strontium molybdate (CaSrMoO4) powders activated with Eu3+ ions to obtain the optimum luminescence intensity.

Fig. 14(a–d) show the emission spectra of Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ with constant Eu3+ and (MoO4)2− concentrations of 0.5 mol% each and varying concentrations of Sr2+ (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mol%) under λex = 258, 395, 466, and 536 nm, respectively. The excitation spectra (see Fig. 5) of the Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ phosphors were monitored at 614 nm. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the PL excitation spectra were obtained over the range of 225 to 550 nm. The observation of excitation peaks from 250 to 350 nm for all the spectra is remarkable, and is ascribed to the O → Mo and O → Eu charge transfer bands (CTBs).66 Overall, these CTBs in Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ are ascribed to electron transitions from the oxygen 2p orbital to the vacant molybdenum 5d orbital or to a vacant Eu3+ 4f orbital.67 This performance is associated with a combination of the luminescent and lattice centers. These combinations are essentially influenced by the distance from the metal ions to the ligands.68 For the excitation peaks from 350 to 550 nm, there are f–f transition bands due to intra-configurational Eu3+ ion transfers in all the Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ spectra. In phosphors with tetragonal structures (e.g., CaSrMoO4), the Sr2+ ions are moderately substituted by Eu3+ ions. Consequently, the peak intensities related to the f–f transition at 614 nm are associated with the Eu3+ ions situated in the A-sites without a center of symmetry. The Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ phosphors demonstrate a principal red PL emission (see Fig. 14(a–d)), which is a characteristic of the 5D0 → 7F2 electronic transition at approximately 614 nm. These results indicate that the Eu3+ ions are positioned at a non-symmetric site in the Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):Eu3+ lattice. The PL emission spectra are identical for all the samples, and resemble the typical f–f transitions of Eu3+ ions. PL emission spectra with excitation at 258 nm (CTB) and 536 nm (5D2) obtained at room temperature have identical peak profiles, but with different intensities. Comparing the excitation of Eu3+ ions at 258 and 536 nm reveals that the PL emission intensity of the Eu3+ ion is strong under excitation in the CTB, which confirms proficient energy transfer from the tetrahedral [MoO4] clusters to the Eu3+ ions.

3.4.6.1 Critical transfer distance (Rc) for Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ and type of interaction. 
In the case of Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors, three different concentration quenching points were observed for different excitation wavelengths, i.e., under 258 nm excitation, the sample was quenched at Y = 0.1. Under 395 nm excitation, the concentration quenching was observed at Y = 0.5, and under 466 and 536 nm excitation, the sample was quenched at Y = 0.2. As observed in Fig. 14, the emission wavelength of 614 nm was more dominant than the other emission wavelengths. Therefore, only one emission wavelength was utilized for the determination of the type of interaction. A linear plot of logx vs. log(I/x) is displayed in Fig. 15. Table 8 shows the type of interaction for each excitation, along with its θ value.

3.4.7 PL investigation of Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors. 
It is known that rare earth ions have comparable coordination structures, ionic radii and chemical properties, which implies that the crystal structure should not show any significant modification. In the present case, the Eu3+ ion may enter the host lattice to substitute Ba2+, or it might be situated on the exterior of the crystal surface due to the absorbent structure.56 From Fig. 16(a–d), it is clear that in the Eu3+-activated Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 phosphors, energy transfer from the host to the Eu3+ activator ions occurs. When illuminated by a near-UV light excitation wavelength, the excitation energy is absorbed by the host and produces self-trapped excitation with broad-band emission; the absorbed energy is transported to the Eu3+ ion and generates characteristic Eu3+ emission. In terms of the actual ionic radii of the cations with different coordination numbers, Eu3+ (1.01 Å and 1.15 Å in seven-coordination, respectively) is similar to Ba2+ (1.38 Å in seven-coordination). It can be anticipated that Eu3+ will occupy the Ba2+ sites in the Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors. In this case, the exchange of Eu3+ ions could transport the positive charges in the lattices [EuBa]. The discrepancy in the charges of the cation sites could be well-compensated by the negative charges; for instance, the cation vacancies [VCa] and [VBa] or interstitial oxygen [Oi]. At this doping level, the host structure could tolerate this disturbance. Nevertheless, this charge compensation mechanism will require additional investigations to obtain supplementary evidence regarding the changes in the defects.69
 Fig. 16  PL emission spectra of the Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors (Y = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1) at various excitation wavelengths. (a) Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 258 nm. (b) Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 395 nm. (c) Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 466 nm. (d) Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):Eu3+ emission upon excitation at 536 nm. 

Fig. 16(a–d) show the emission spectra of Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+, in which the Ca, MoO4 and Eu3+ concentrations were kept constant and Ba2+ concentration was 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 mol%, upon excitation at 258, 395, 466, and 536 nm at room temperature. Except in the case of 258 nm excitation, the strongest emission peak of Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ is located at 614 nm, which is attributed to the 5D0 → 7F2 transition. The maximum emission intensity of the Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors is observed for the 258 nm and 536 nm excitation wavelengths. It is well known that 258 nm is mercury excitation; consequently, we chose 536 nm as the excitation wavelength to achieve mercury (Hg)-free excitation; this is a feature of solid-state lighting phosphors.70,71 Therefore, the overall characteristics indicate that the present phosphor is an excellent candidate for solid-state lighting devices (i.e., a mercury-free-excitation lamp phosphor). In the present study, the intensity of the emission of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition for Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ was 2.55 times higher than that of the Ca1−X−YSrY(MoO4):0.5 mol% Eu3+ phosphors. As the concentration of Sr2+ is increased, a greater number of luminescence centers are generated and the distance between the luminescence centers becomes insignificant, allowing resonant energy transfer such that the energy can be easily transported from one luminescence center to another.

Fig. 18 presents an energy level diagram showing the energy states involved in the luminescence process and the different transition probabilities for the Eu3+ ions for all the phosphor schemes discussed above.
 Fig. 18  Energy levels of the Eu3+ ion, showing the transition probabilities and the states involved in the luminescence process. 
The present energy level model (Fig. 18) indicates that the system is primarily first excited from the 5D3 ground state to the singlet state of the 5D3,2,1,0 configurations. Moreover, for symmetry reasons, the electrons ascend to the triplet state (level 4). The transition 5D0 is much more rapid and immediate in the luminescence process, which suggests that the luminescence process is not exaggerated by the singlet state. Among the triplet states, non-radiative transition may ensue between the three energy levels of the triplet state 5D3, 5D2, 5D1 and 5D0 with possible transitions from level 3–2, from level 2–1 and from level 2–0 i.e., 5D0. However, 5D0 → 7FJ radiative transitions occur from level 5D0 to level 7F0,1,2,3 to the ground state (level 1). The 591 and 614 nm emissions of the Eu3+ ion in the above phosphor make it potentially applicable as an orange/red phosphor for solid-state lighting.

3.5 Quantum efficiency from Judd–Ofelt analysis
Judd–Ofelt theory was developed by Brain R. Judd and George S. Ofelt with the purpose of investigating the intensities of transitions that take place in lanthanides and actinides. This theory is based on three models, namely, a static model, in which the central ion is considered to be affected by the static electric field (crystal or ligand field) of the surrounding host ions, a free ion model, in which the electric field arising from the host ions acts as a perturbation for the free ion Hamiltonian, and a single configuration model, in which interactions between electrons are neglected.72 With a view toward understanding the effect of the surrounding Eu3+ ions on the luminescence properties in greater detail, theoretical calculations based on the Judd–Ofelt (J–O) theory were conducted in order to calculate the optical transition parameters Ωλ (λ = 2, 4, 6) and quantum efficiency. According to the J–O theory, the probability of the MD transition (5D0 → 7F1) of Eu3+ can be expressed as follows:73 (4)here, kmd is the MD transition energy in cm−1, n is the refractive index of the host, which was calculated using the Sellmeier equation72 and found to have a value of approximately 1.98, h is Plank's constant, J′ is the total angular momentum of the initial state (J′ = 0 for 5D0 → 7FJ transitions), and Smd is the MD line strength, which has a fixed value of approximately 7.83 × 10−42 esu2 cm2, which is unaffected by the luminescent host. Notwithstanding, in accordance with the transition selection rule, ED transitions of 0D0 → 7FJ (J = 2, 4, 6) are permissible; thus, the possibility of spontaneous ED emission can be ascertained as: (5)where e represents the elementary charge with a value of 4.8 × 10−10 esu, and ked is the ED transition energy in cm−1. 〈φJ||Uλ||φ′J′〉2 represents the squared reduced matrix elements of the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 2, 4, 6) transitions of Eu3+.
As a consequence of the proportional relationship between the integrated intensity of the PL emission spectrum and the probability of transition for each energy level, the following expression can be developed: (6)
Based on eqn (6), the values of the optical transition parameters of Ω2 and Ω4 can be determined, and the lifetime of Eu3+ at the 5D0 level can also be given as:74 (7)where AR is the probability of the 5D0 radiative transition, which is equal to the sum of the rates of the radiative transitions 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–3); that is, ∑AJ (J = 0–3). AN is the possibility of 5D0 non-radiative transition. Subsequently, the quantum efficiency η of 5D0 can be determined using the following expression;74 (8)
The calculated results of Ω2 and Ω4 for the most intense phosphors, i.e., Ca1−X−YBaYMoO4, under excitations at 258, 395, 466 and 536 nm are listed in Table 10. It can be seen from Table 10 that Ω2 is larger than Ω4 for the various excited phosphors, and that all the parameters for excitation under 466 nm are higher than those for excitation under 395 nm. Certain earlier studies concluded that the parameter Ω2 depended on short-range effects, i.e., the covalency of the ligand field and/or structural changes in the vicinity of the lanthanide ion, while the parameter Ω4 was subject to long-range effects, and could be related to the bulk properties of the host. In the present study, the high value of Ω2 (Ω2 > Ω4) revealed the relatively high asymmetry at the Eu3+ site and the greater covalency of the Eu–O bond. Furthermore, the J–O parameters associated with the transition rate and quantum efficiency of Eu3+ in our samples were found to be different under different excitation wavelengths. This result indicated that the local environment of the Eu3+ ions was changed by the excitation light source.

 Fig. 19  Variation in the PL emission of Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2(1−X)AX:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors (M = Sr, Ba), (A = SO4, MoO4, VO4, WO4) at 614 nm upon excitation at 258 nm, 395 nm, 466 nm and 536 nm (X, Y, Z = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1). 
By co-doping the trivalent rare earth ions into the Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2AX:X host and adjusting their relative concentration ratios, multicolor tunable emissions were acquired by changing the ratio of Eu3+. The energy transfer from the rare earth ions to the host was investigated using PL. The influence of the substitution of W by Mo on the luminescence properties of Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2AX:X was also investigated. The emission intensities of the Eu3+ ions were found to reach a maximum when the molar ratio of Mo/W–O tetrahedra was varied. During the replacement, two Ca2+ lattice sites are substituted by 2Eu3+ ions with the formation of a vacancy at a Ca2+ site for the prerequisite charge compensation (i.e., 3Ca2+→ 2Eu3+ (vacancy)). This further contributes to a more asymmetric atmosphere near the Eu3+ ions. Thus, it might have again induced more deviation from the actual S4 site symmetry. Luminescence behavior has a linear influence on the luminescence quantum yield. Absolute quantum yields were not measured in this study, and are still under investigation. However, the effect of the concentration of rare earth ions and co-hosts at room temperature has been calibrated to absolute QY values. Determination of the absolute spectral power to better evaluate the decay of the emission peaks and normalized curves of each phosphor with increasing concentration are under investigation.
3.7 CIE color coordinates of Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2(1−X)AX:X mol% Eu3+ phosphors
The colour purity was compared to the 1931 CIE standard Source C (illuminant Cs (0.3101, 0.3162)). The chromatic coordinates x and y were calculated using the colour calculator program radiant imaging. The coordinates of the Ca3(1−X−Z)MZ(PO4)2(1−X)AX phosphor colors are shown in Fig. 20(a). Fig. 20(b) indicates the typical color coordinates for the different phosphors as A = Ca3(PO4)2:0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid circle), B = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid square), C = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1):0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid tilted square), D = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1):0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid upward triangle), E = Ca1−X−YSrYMoO4:0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid downward triangle), F = Ca1−X−YBaYMoO4:0.5 mol% Eu3+ (solid triangle tilted at left).

(b) Chromatic coordinate values, where A = Ca3(PO4)2:0.5 mol% Eu3+, B = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+, C = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+, D = Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:0.5 mol% Eu3+, E = Ca1−X−YSrYMoO4:0.5 mol% Eu3+, and F = Ca1−X−YBaYMoO4:0.5 mol% Eu3+. 
The dominant wavelength can be determined by drawing a straight line from one of the CIE white illuminants (Cs(0.3101, 0.3162)), from side to side using the (x, y) coordinates until the line connects with the external locus of the points along the spectral edge of the 1931 CIE chromatic diagram.48,75 These emission wavelength results also indicate that the obtained phosphors could potentially be applied in NUV and LED excited solid state lighting devices and can be used as red emitting phosphors.
The color purities of all the synthesized phosphors were calculated using the relationship (9)where (x, y) and (xi, yi) are the color-coordinates of the sample point and the CIE equal-energy illuminant, respectively; (xd, yd) is the chromaticity coordinate of the dominant wavelength of the light source. The color correlated temperature (CCT) has been calculated using the following equation:76 CCT = −499n3 + 3525n2 − 6823.3n + 5520.33(10) (11)where xe and ye = (0.332, 0.186).
The color purity and color correlated temperature of all the most intense samples of all the synthesized subseries are shown in Table 12. The color correlated temperatures suggest that the emission is warm red. Therefore, the phosphors are potential candidates for use in UV-LEDs as the red component of warm white light emission.

4. Conclusion
The present investigation reports the synthesis and characterizations of several series novel single-phase Eu3+-activated Ca1−X−ZMZ(PO4)1−XAX phosphors. The phases of the synthesized phosphors were investigated using XRD (X-ray diffraction), and their detailed crystal structure was also revealed. The morphological investigations using SEM suggested that the typical crystallite size was in the sub-micrometer range of 5 to 10 mm. The FTIR spectra recorded to investigate the molecular environment of the present phosphors indicated that the Ca1−X−ZMZ(PO4)1−XAX materials belong to the phosphate family. In this course of this study, the complete replacement of PO4 with MoO4 was carried out, and the PL emission intensity was found to be enhanced as compared to the primary series. The PL performance of the phosphors was examined via the photo-excitation mechanism. PL characterization and statistical analysis confirmed that the assimilation of small amounts of Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions (0.5 mol%) into the lattice increased the PL intensity of the Ca1−X−YBaY(MoO4):Eu3+ phosphors almost six-fold compared to that of the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1):Eu3+ phosphors due to the charge compensation. Additionally, this represented a four-fold increase compared to the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(WO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors, a thirteen-fold increase relative to the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(SO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors, a two-fold increase over the Ca3(PO4)2(X−1)(MoO4)X:Eu3+ phosphors, and a 2.5-fold increase compared to the Ca1−X−YSrYMoO4:Eu3+ phosphors. The structural investigations suggest that the Eu3+ ions are positioned at the Ca2+ cationic sites, and that the occupation of the sites by Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions did not generate any altered defects. The principal conclusion of the entire study is that the luminescence sensitivity of Ca1−X−ZMZ(PO4)1−XAX host matrices can be enhanced by suitable tuning of the host ions. In present study, the Ca3(PO4)2 host matrices were tuned using SO4, MoO4, VO4, and WO4 ions, and the luminescence intensity was enhanced to a great extent. The critical energy transfer distance was calculated theoretically for each subseries and verified via the experimental emission spectra. The theoretical and experimental critical transfer distances are analogous to one another, and confirm that multipolar interactions are responsible for concentration quenching in each subseries. The color purity and color correlated temperature of all the prepared materials were calculated, and it was observed that the color purity was enhanced for each series, with a color purity of 85.39% being found for the final series. The color correlated temperature of all the subseries suggested that the phosphors provide warm light emission. The quantum efficiency of the most intense samples were evaluated using Judd–Ofelt analysis. The present phosphor can be excited by not only near-UV light, but also by LEDs, and could be applicable as a high-color-purity and high-brightness red phosphor for solid-state lighting.
