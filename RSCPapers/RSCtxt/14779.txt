This Communication demonstrates its performance and characteristics using the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate as a test system.
Nicotinamide cofactors are Nature's hydrogen-transfer agents, analogous to BH4− or AlH4− but with exquisite selectivity incorporated via specific enzymes. A very large number of such enzymes for which NAD(P)(H) is a co-substrate feature in diverse metabolic pathways, and many are being exploited to develop synthetic cascades of importance for biocatalysis and sensing.1–6 In biology, the primary conversion of electrical (solar) energy into chemical reducing power occurs in the chloroplast, where electrons energized by sunlight are used to recycle NADPH from NADP+ through the flavoenzyme known as ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR): in a logical extension of the underlying concept, it was recently discovered that a porous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode modified by incorporation of FNR molecules yields stable, diffusion-controlled and quasi-reversible electrochemistry of NADP+.7 The resulting cyclic voltammetry is virtually classical, the oxidation and reduction peaks resembling that of small electron-transfer mediators at a planar electrode.
The electrode system, nicknamed the ‘electrochemical leaf’ and denoted as FNR@MO/support, where MO is a porous conducting metal oxide and the support is typically graphite, ITO glass or titanium foil, has potential applications in biocatalyst discovery, investigation, and exploitation. The discovery makes it possible (and in a direct way) to use an electron source to intercept, drive, control, and measure the progress and rates of any enzyme cascade that includes a nicotinamide cofactor recycling step, and to extend this capability to synthesis once strategies for scaling up have been established. There is substantial interest in clean and efficient cofactor regeneration systems capable of performing 103–105 recycles, since stoichiometric use of NAD(P)(H) is prohibited by its cost.8–16 In contrast to conventional organic electrosynthesis,17,18 which is usually carried out with organic solvents and driven by a large potential difference, the discovery opens up the possibility of electrochemically driving organic reactions in aqueous solution under mild conditions. The efficiency of enzymes and the exquisite fidelity they provide in terms of inherent regio- and stereo-selectivity, is thus exploitable for electrosynthesis of high-value products.
In this paper we describe an exciting new practical approach to cofactor recycling in which the electrochemical leaf is used as the cathode in a hydrogen fuel cell: it thereby becomes possible to carry out stereo- and regio-selective organic synthesis with continuous ‘real-time’ monitoring. The advantage over performing the same enzyme-based operation using standard electrolysis with potential control is that the whole system is simplified and compacted into a single pot: no reference electrode is needed and the electrode surface area, particularly using Ti support materials, can be very large. As one of an increasing number of enzymes that are now known to function as reversible electrocatalysts when attached to an electrode,19 FNR is so efficient that NADP+/NADPH interconversion requires only a minimal overpotential, so the reducing power of H2 is not wasted. This fact is clear from Fig. 1, which compares catalytic 2H+/H2 interconversion by platinised carbon paper (PCP) under 1 atm H2, and catalytic NADP+/NADPH interconversion by a FNR@ITO/ITO-glass electrode (see ESI† for details). The reference scales are: RHE = Reversible Hydrogen Electrode, SHE = Standard Hydrogen Electrode. These results were obtained using borate buffer at pH 8.0, for which the reaction NADP+ + H2 → NADPH + H+ has a driving force of 90 ± 5 mV: similar comparisons for pH 7.0 (MES buffer) and 9.0 (borate buffer) displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), show driving forces of 70 ± 5 mV and 110 ± 5 mV, respectively. Importantly, the reduction peak observed at −0.42 V vs. SHE shows that NADP+ is reduced so rapidly that it begins to be depleted at an electrode potential >50 mV positive of the 2H+/H2 potential. An FNR@ITO/ITO-glass electrode subjected to temperatures above 65 °C for 10 minutes or prepared with denatured FNR showed no cyclic voltammetry due to NADP+ electroactivity (see Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of NADP+/NADPH interconversion at an FNR@ITO/ITO-glass electrode (1.6 cm2) recorded at different [NADP+] concentrations, overlaid on the corresponding CV (note the insignificant capacitance) for 2H+/H2 interconversion at a PCP electrode (1.6 cm2). All the CVs were recorded at 25 °C (scan rate: 1 mV s−1 for FNR@ITO/ITO-glass and 5 mV s−1 for PCP) in 50 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0). The solution was bubbled with H2 during the CV (i.e. ρH2 = approx. 1 atm) for the PCP electrode and with Ar before measurements with the FNR@ITO/ITO-glass electrode. 
To confirm our ability to exploit fast, diffusion-controlled NADPH regeneration using H2 as a source, we designed a test system to scavenge the NADPH product and simultaneously synthesize sizeable quantities of an organic compound. In the fuel cell represented in Fig. 2 the current that flows (and hence the rate of the reaction) is recorded continuously.
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of the single pot fuel cell for enzyme-catalysed, reductive organic synthesis. The rate and progress of the overall reaction are monitored continuously by recording the current that flows (and charged passed) between the H2-oxidising Pt anode and the NADPH-recycling cathode (FNR@ITO/Ti-foil). 
The specificity of each electrode, i.e. the H2-oxidising anode and the NADP+-reducing cathode, meant that no separating barrier, such as a proton exchange membrane, was required. Typically, a large FNR@ITO/Ti electrode was constructed by combining several strips of Ti foil, electrophoretically depositing ITO on both sides, then treating with a solution of FNR.7 The PCP electrode was sufficiently large to ensure that H2 oxidation was not rate limiting. For our demonstration experiments we chose the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) to L-glutamate (L-Glu), catalysed by L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) (from bovine liver (EC Number: 1.4.1.3)). The reason for choosing this otherwise unimportant synthesis as a test system is that GLDH is commercially available, inexpensive, well characterised, and robust, thereby allowing the performance (rates and progress) of the coupling to the NADP+ recycling system to be measured conveniently and routinely in numerous experiments.
At concentrations less than 0.1 mg mL−1, GLDH exists as a hexamer with a molecular weight of 332 kDa (approximately 55.4 kDa per subunit): this is the lowest molecular weight form that is both stable in aqueous solution and active.20 At higher concentrations GLDH associates to higher molecular weight forms.20–22 The enzyme is active towards both NAD(H) and NAD(P)H20,23 with reported Km values of 2.4 ± 0.8 mM, 6.5 ± 1.8 mM and 0.022 ± 0.007 mM for 2-oxoglutarate, NH4+ and NADPH respectively.24 Substrate inhibition by 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH occurs at respective high concentrations.23

Fig. 3A shows an exemplary experiment, which was carried out using chronoamperometry (CA) as follows: a PCP electrode (1.6 cm2) and a ‘book’ (see Fig. S3, ESI†) of FNR@ITO/Ti-foil electrodes (total active area 14 cm2) was placed in a glass vial containing 2 mL of 50 mM MES buffer (pH 7.0) along with 40–50 mM 2-OG and 60 mM NH4Cl, then the vial was sealed with a rubber septum through which a gas cannula was inserted. Introduction of H2 to the cell by gentle bubbling, prior to adding NADP+ or GLDH, initially results in a large current that decays over several minutes to a constant value. This initial burst of H2 oxidation activity (see inset, Fig. 3A) was attributed to residual amounts of oxidising material trapped in the cell, (and most obviously associated with the FNR@ITO/Ti-foil electrode) which needed to be eliminated before commencing the coupled electrochemical synthesis. Subsequently, replacing H2 by Ar caused a sharp drop in current to virtually zero, following which re-introduction of H2 resulted in a small increase to a constant value, attributable to slow infusion of air through the piercing in the septum. Injection of NADP+ resulted in an immediate increase in current that decreased over several minutes, before GLDH was injected to initiate a large current increase due to reductive amination of 2-OG. The current (which is directly proportional to the rate of product formation) was monitored for over 13 hours, the essential features being (a) an initial biphasic increase (a virtually instantaneous increase followed by a slow increase), (b) a slow decrease over approximately 10 hours, (c) a steep drop in current to zero at the end of the reaction. Analysis by 1H NMR showed that complete conversion of 2-OG to L-Glu had taken place (Fig. S4, ESI†). The total charge passed during the synthesis (noting that consumption of reactant is proportional to the accumulated charge passed) was equivalent to a conversion factor of 98.6%.

The inset shows a close-up view of the initial 0.6 h during which H2 is ‘burned’ to remove traces of oxidizing material, then NADP+ is added. (B) Current (rate)–time profiles for the synthesis of L-glutamate. Numbers refer to NADP+ concentrations in μM. Experimental conditions correspond to entries B–E of Table 1. 
The detailed results of numerous experiments carried out over a range of pH and NADP+ concentration are provided in Table 1. The total FNR coverage in each case was determined from the peak areas under ‘non-turnover’ conditions (i.e. without NADP+ present). In all cases, the final solution was analysed by NMR to verify completion of the reaction and to compare product yield with that obtained from the charge that had passed. In most experiments, borate was used as the buffer in order to avoid convoluted NMR spectra (entries A–G), but some experiments were performed using TAPS or MES (entries H, J, and K) to check if borate complexation with NADP+ was detrimental, since borate is known to inhibit enzyme reactions with NAD+.25–27 Cyclic voltammetry indeed showed that borate causes a small negative shift in the reduction potential compared to the other buffers, and this shift is most noticeable at pH 9, where more borate is present as B(OH)4−.27 The reaction was also carried out with no additional buffer (entry I). Fig. 3B shows results obtained using different concentrations of NADP+ at pH 9.0 (borate), 40–50 mM 2-OG, in 2 mL of 60 mM NH4Cl solution. In all cases apart from the lowest NADP+ concentration, the reaction was complete within 35 h, the shortest time of 11 h being achieved with 100 μM NADP+. Comparison of the traces shows that the slow phase increase in current (effectively an activation process) and the subsequent slow decrease (an inactivation process) are both faster at higher NADP+ levels. This observation has a possible explanation that is highly significant but outside the scope of this Communication, namely that increasing levels of NADP+ accelerate release of FNR from the ITO pores, facilitating its replacement by GLDH which thus co-adsorbs in close proximity, thereby enhancing the coupled reaction by a microconfinement effect. This new direction is under further investigation.

One metric for evaluating the performance of a cofactor recycling system is the ‘total turnover number’ (TTN) defined as the number of moles of product formed divided by the number of moles of cofactor present.9 As seen in Table 1, TTN values vary from just over 400 with 100 μM NADP+ to more than 12000 using 2.5 μM NADP+. The effect of pH on the rate of product formation is generally not significant, despite the fact that FNR is adsorbed at much higher levels as the pH is increased.7 The reason for the lack of influence of FNR loading is that most enzyme molecules are too deeply buried in the ITO pores and although electroactive, are redundant with regard to NADP(H) recycling. Consequently, the FNR turnover number (TON) is lowest at pH 9 (11–24000) and highest at pH 7 (exceeding 160000) where the catalytic activity stems from fewer FNR molecules.
The average current flowing during the reaction (before it drops abruptly at the end) was divided by the total active cathode surface area to estimate empirical ‘operational’ rate constants (μmoles h−1 cm−2) for all the reactions carried out in this particular fuel cell (i.e. with a 2 mL volume). By plotting these rate constants (far right column of Table 1) against NADP+ concentration, a Michaelis–Menten type curve was generated (Fig. S5, ESI†) that was essentially independent of pH. The plot shows that >50% of the maximum rate is achieved with just 20 μM NADP+, thereby offering a good guide for future applications.
Such a clean and simple device may be the basis for many significant applications in enzyme-based catalysis using nicotinamide cofactors. Importantly, the one-pot fuel cell combines the use of H2 as a reductant with the very valuable and inherent ability to monitor the progress of the reaction continuously.
