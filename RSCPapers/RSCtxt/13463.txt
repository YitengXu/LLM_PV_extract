    , Accepted 13th May 2017First published on 15th May 2017AbstractA high quantum yield, tunable band gap, and high color purity of perovskite nanocrystals make this class of materials attractive for electronic and optoelectronic applications in devices including solar cells, photodetectors, and light emitting diodes. Herein, we report for the first time the facile synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals based on (CH3NH3)1−xCsxPbBr3. The emission properties, photoluminescence and stability of the mixed-cation perovskite nanocrystals have been intensively studied, which are significantly related to the content of cesium in the composition. The as-obtained (CH3NH3)1−xCsxPbBr3 nanocrystals were employed as the emission layer in perovskite light emitting diodes, and the device fabricated with the optimized perovskite nanocrystals (Cs doping x = 0.3) showed a maximum luminescence of 24500 cd m−2, nearly ten-fold higher than those for the previous reported perovskite devices based on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals. This study opens a new avenue for the fabrication of efficient perovskite nanocrystals and provides great potential of developing perovskite LEDs based on mixed-cation perovskite nanocrystals.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites with a structure of ABX3 (A = Cs, methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA); B = Pb or Sn; X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted great attention for electronic and optoelectronic applications in devices including photovoltaic systems,1–4 photodetectors5–7 and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).8–10 Taking the advantages of low temperature synthesis process,11 tunable band gaps and superior optoelectronic properties,12,13 organometal halide perovskite solar cells have achieved power conversion efficiencies over 20%.14 More recently, this class of material have also shown potential in LEDs, which exhibit potentially bright luminescence, high carrier mobility, broadband color tunability and high color purity with narrow peak emission.15–18 Similar to those on perovskite solar cells, numerous efforts have led to the rapid improvement on perovskite nanocrystal (NC) LEDs. Aditya et al.19 fabricated perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) comprising a blue-green color tunable organolead chloride–bromide mixed halide perovskite with an EQE of 0.1%. Huang et al.20 used an emulsion synthesis of size-tunable MAPbBr3 quantum dots, which were used as a light emitting layer, achieving a maximum luminance of 2503 cd m−2 and an EQE of 1.1%. However, compared to the achievements in OLEDs or QLEDs, there is still great potential for improvements in PeLEDs.
Nanosized perovskite materials can effectively minimize the exciton dissociation and enhance radiative recombination due to the quantum confinement effect. In near-infrared LEDs, Yuan et al.21 used quantum-size-tuned grains that funnel the photoexcitations to achieve a high EQE of 8.8%. Wang and her co-workers22 reported a self-organized multiple quantum wells perovskite LEDs with a record EQE of 11.7%. In addition, Zhang et al.23 reported a well-passivated perovskite nanocrystal film, which achieved an EQE of 6.3%. All these research reports indicated that nanosized perovskite materials are an effective way to improve the device performance of PeLEDs.
The optical and electronic properties of organolead halide perovskites have been studied by replacing the MA cation with other organic cations.24–26 A new type of perovskite has been synthesized by changing the halide anions. And the wavelength can be changed by varying the ratio of different halide anions. To date, there have been no investigations on the properties of PeLEDs by mixing the organic cation with an inorganic cation. It is still a considerable opportunity to improve the device performance by optimizing the optical and electronic properties by studying the component and composition ratios.
In this study we, for the first time, report the realization of Cs cation doping in MA-based perovskite NCs with varied concentration, which achieved bright and efficient perovskite LEDs based on the resulting mixed-cation perovskite MA1−xCsxPbBr3 NCs. The obtained perovskite NCs were facilely synthesized using a common precursor and organic solvents and exhibited a bright photoluminescence with a narrow full width at half maximum (<25 nm) and high quantum yield (80%). By examining the morphological, optical and structural properties of the as-synthesized perovskite nanocrystals, the perovskite MA1−xCsxPbBr3 was optimized by adjusting the Cs content in the mixed cation. Using the optimized perovskite nanocrystals MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3, the corresponding PeLED exhibits a maximum luminance of 24500 cd m−2, which is 10 times greater compared to that reported in the literature (Table S1, ESI†). Correspondingly, a current efficiency of 4.1 cd A−1 and EQE of 1.3% were obtained. We believe that this study will open up a new strategy for the further improvement of the photoelectronic properties of PeLEDs.
Experimental
Preparation of MACsPbBr3 NCs
First, MABr was synthesized by mixing the same molar ratio of methylamine (30% in methanol) and hydrobromic acid (48% in water) at 0 °C for 2 h under stirring. The precipitate was collected by evaporating the solvent at 60 °C for 1 h, and the crude product was purified by dissolving in ethanol, recrystallizing from diethyl ether (five times). The resulting pure product was dried in vacuum for 24 h.
For the MAPbBr3 synthesis, a 200 μL solution containing 0.1 mmol of PbBr2, 0.16 mmol of MABr, 20 μL of oleylamine and 500 μL of oleic acid in dimethylformamide were added to 10 mL acetone at room temperature to produce a colloidal solution. For the MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 synthesis, 0.16 mmol of MABr was replaced by 0.144 mmol of MABr and 0.016 mmol of CsBr. tert-Butanol was added as a demulsifier in the demulsion process. The green product was collected after centrifugation at 5500 rpm for 10 min, the precipitates were then dissolved into 1 mL of n-hexane, and a bright green supernatant was obtained after another centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glasses were cleaned by sonication in acetone, isopropyl alcohol and deionized water for 30 min and dried under a flow of Ar gas. After that the substrates were treated with O2 plasma for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO glasses at 3000 rpm for 45 s, followed by heating at 130 °C for 20 min in air. Then, the ITO glasses were transferred into a glove box for further use. TFB and perovskite were deposited layer by layer at 4000 rpm for 45 s and at 2000 rpm for 40 s, respectively. The TFB layer was baked at 120 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the perovskite layer is about 40 nm, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Finally, TPBi (40 nm), LiF (1 nm) and Al (150 nm) were deposited using thermal evaporation at rate of 1.0, 0.1 and 2.0 nm s−1, respectively, under a high vacuum (<1.5 × 10−6 Torr). The device area was 2 × 2 mm2.
Characterization
The EL spectra of the QLEDs were measured on a fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics USB2000). Measurement of the EQE was achieved using the method recommended by SR Forrest in which a large area PIN-25D silicon photodiode was placed in contact with the devices. The active area (2 × 2 mm2) of the device under test was much smaller than that of the photodiode area (613 mm2). Light emitted from the QLEDs was absorbed by the photodiode, which had a known responsivity and was measured as photodiode current (calibrated by the integrated emission spectrum of the device being tested), while the driving current through the devices was monitored simultaneously using a dual-channel Keithley 2614B source measure unit. These two quantities were then used to calculate the EQE (as photons per electron) by converting the photodiode current to emitted photons and the driving current to electrons. The photon flux can be converted into luminous flux by means of the eye-sensitivity (or standard luminosity) function V(λ). Then, the luminance can be determined as the luminous flux divided by the emission area and the emission solid angle of the devices. The emission solid angle is π by assuming Lambertian emission. The luminance acquired from this method was calibrated using PR670.
Results and discussion
Colloidal MA1−xCsxPbBr3 nanocrystals were synthesized via a similar method to the previously reported emulsion synthesis.20 Perovskite precursors PbBr2, MABr and CsBr were dissolved in dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). The precursors were mixed with n-octylamine and oleic acid under vigorous stirring. Furthermore, this solution was added dropwise to toluene, which formed a green colloidal nanocrystals solution. tert-Butanol was added as a demulsifier in the demulsion process. The suspension was precipitated by centrifugation and then partially redissolved into hexane.
The as-prepared MACsPbBr3 perovskite NCs are primarily single crystalline with the sizes varying from 8 nm to 12 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a. All the samples have a cubic shape with no significant change observed on incorporating Cs into the samples (Fig. S2, ESI†). To further investigate the effect of Cs doping on the crystal structure, high-resolution TEM was measured, as shown in Fig. 1b. The lattice fringe was calculated from the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and the HR-TEM analyses (Fig. 1c). Upon doping Cs into the MAPbBr3, the lattice fringe distance was reduced (Fig. 1d). The observed decrease in the lattice was due to the smaller ionic radius of the Cs atoms (1.81 Å) compared to the MA atoms (2.70 Å), resulting in a reduction of the cubo-octahedral volume for the A-site cation surrounded by the corner shared eight PbI6 octahedra in the unit cell.27

The crystallization of the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 perovskites was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with different values of x, which is shown in Fig. 2a. The as-synthesized perovskite NCs exhibit good crystallinity, as deduced from the XRD patterns. It can be observed that the (100) peak intensity gradually decreases and the (110) peak intensity increases by adding more Cs, which means (110) is the preferred crystal growth direction. In addition, the (100) peak displayed a shift from 14.9° to higher values, indicating the shrinkage of the crystal lattice, which was consistent with the TEM results (Fig. 2b). To further confirm the chemical bond configuration of the elements, the bonding states of Cs, Br and Pb were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The total XPS spectrum of MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3 is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and C, N, Cs, Pb and Br were detected. No Cs peak was observed from neat MAPbBr3, while it was detected in the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 (x > 0) samples (Fig. S4, ESI†). The observed results showed that the synthesized compounds were MA1−xCsxPbBr3.

In order to study the changes in the optical band gap of the mixed-cation perovskite materials, we performed UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The bandgap of semiconductor is the lowest energy that free electrons get rid of the bond of valance band. The valence bond intensity is related to the lattice constant because the smaller the atomic spacing, the stronger the force between the atoms. Therefore, the smaller the lattice constant of the semiconductor, the band gap should be greater. In our study, the decrease in lattice constant indicates the potential in the increased band gap. As confirmed by the absorption spectra (Fig. 3a), the absorption band was blue-shifted from 515 nm to 505 nm upon increasing x from 0 to 0.4. In addition, we can see from the normalized PL spectra (Fig. 3b) that the PL peaks gradually change from 539 nm to 533 nm with the different amounts of doped Cs.

The excellent optoelectronics properties of the developed MACsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals encouraged us to explore their application in LEDs. The device structure comprised patterned indium tin oxide (ITO), spin-coated layers of PEDOT:PSS, TFB and MA1−xCsxPbBr3 nanocrystals, and evaporated layers of TPBi and LiF/Al, as shown in Fig. 4a. A schematic of the flat-band energy-level is shown in Fig. 4b. The electrons are injected from the TPBi, while the holes are transported from the TFB into the conduction and valance bands of the perovskite NCs, followed by radiative recombination in the perovskite layer. The matching energy levels between the transporting layer and emitting layer in our devices are the main factors that affect the performance of the PeLEDs. The fabricated PeLEDs showed a bright and uniform emission (Fig. 4c), which was lightened under a bias of 4 V. The normalized EL spectra also showed a blue shift, which was consistent with the PL spectra.

To better understand the injection process in our devices, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed on the MA1−xCsxPbBr3 NCs. The onset energy and the high-binding energy secondary-electron cut-off are shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†). The valence band levels of MA1−xCsxPbBr3 were calculated using the equation VB = 21.2 − (Ecutoff − Eonset), which were determined to be −5.8 eV, −5.9 eV, −5.5 eV, −5.3 eV and −5.4 eV, with x increasing from 0 to 0.4, respectively. The decrease in the valence band reduces the hole injection barrier. In PeLEDs, this decrease can facilitate the hole injection from the TFB to the perovskite layer, which leads to an improved device performance.

Fig. 5a displays the current density vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PeLEDs based on the MACsPbBr3 nanocrystals. The current density has an exponential growth as the voltage is increased and shows little difference upon changing the Cs ratio. The turn-on voltage was almost the same for all the samples. In addition, the maximum luminance was enhanced upon increasing x from 0 to 0.3. For example, the neat MAPbBr3 PeLEDs showed a luminance of 10570 cd m−2, and the luminance of MACsPbBr3 PeLEDs was improved to 13730 cd m−2. The best performance was achieved by MACsPbBr3, with a maximum luminance of 24500 cd m−2, which was 2.3 fold higher compared to that of MAPbBr3. The maximum current efficiency and EQE in this study are acquired with an optimized Cs doping of x = 0.1, which were 4.56 cd A−1 and 1.4%, respectively. Even though, MA0.9Cs0.1PbBr3 PeLED shows the highest current efficiency peak, as the current increases, the current efficiency dramatically decreases to 0.95 cd A−1 at 1000 mA cm−2 and the EQE decreases to 0.4% at 900 mA cm−2, whereas with the MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3 PeLED, the maximum current efficiency remains as high as 2.2 cd A−1 at 1000 mA cm−2 and the EQE is 0.72% at 900 mA cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, the luminance of 24500 cd m−2 and the EQE of 1.3% are the highest reported for MA-based perovskite NCs LEDs to date. However, there was no further improvement as the Cs content was further increased; the maximum luminance dropped down to 23000 cd m−2. The detailed device performance is summarized in Table 1.

The prepared MA0.7Cs0.3PbBr3 PeLEDs exhibit high luminance, and hence we believe that the optimization of Cs doping is an important strategy to fabricate a high performance device. Three explanations can be ascribed as follows: (1) the smaller Cs atom can induce lattice shrinkage, which can form highly crystalline perovskite materials, (2) the size of the as-synthesized perovskite is about 10 nm, which behaves like quantum dots and exhibits a high quantum efficiency and (3) the energy levels match between the perovskite and hole transporting layer (TFB), which can facilitate hole injection.
Conclusions
We have synthesized MA/Cs mixed-cation perovskite nanocrystals. The high performance PeLEDs based on these NCs have been demonstrated, which show a maximum bright luminance and CE of 24500 cd m−2 and 4.1 cd A−1, respectively. This high performance can be attributed to the Cs doped in the MA, which affects the crystal lattice. This study reports for the first time the use of mixed-cation perovskite MA/Cs NCs as the light emitting layer in PeLEDs. Our study demonstrates a new pathway towards optoelectronic devices based on a mixed cation perovskite. More investigation is expected to be carried out to optimize the morphology of the perovskite layer and the structure of PeLEDs. We believe that by optimizing the morphology and the structure, we can further improve the device performance. Therefore, cation mixtures are a novel compositional strategy on the road to high-performance, all-solution processed PeLEDs.
