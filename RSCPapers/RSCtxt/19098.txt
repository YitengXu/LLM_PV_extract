    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 4th September 2017AbstractIn this work we demonstrate the use of the push–pull model system 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile (DMABN) as a convenient molecular probe to investigate the local solvation structure and dynamics by means of time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR). The photochemical features associated with this system provide several advantages due to the high charge separation between the ground and charge transfer states involving the characteristic nitrile bond, and an excited state lifetime that is long enough to observe the slow solvation dynamics in organic solvents and ionic liquids. The conversion from a locally excited state to an intramolecular charge transfer state (LE–ICT) in ionic liquids shows similar kinetic lifetimes in comparison to organic solvents. This similarity confirms that such conversion depends solely on the intramolecular reorganization of DMABN in the excited state, and not by the dynamics of solvation. In contrast, the relative shift of the ν(CN) vibration during the relaxation of the ICT state reveals two distinct lifetimes that are sensitive to the solvent environment. This study reveals a fast time component which is attributed to the dipolar relaxation of the solvent and a slower time component related to the rotation of the dimethylamino group of DMABN.
Introduction
Ionic liquids (IL) are defined as ionic compounds with melting points below 100 °C.1 They are generally formed by asymmetric organic cations and large inorganic anions, which prevents ion packing thus reducing their lattice energy.2 Because ionic liquids are mostly formed by organic cations with long carbonic chain lengths, the liquids organize by self-aggregation in polar and nonpolar domains.3,4 In contrast to organic solvents, the domains in ILs are interchangeable. This gives rise to structural and dynamic microheterogeneity that directly affects the solvation of a molecular or ionic species,5 giving a whole new direction for exploring the unique properties of species dissolved in IL systems. IL solvents have many advantages including their negligible volatility, great stability and large temperature and pressure ranges in the liquid state. Industrial and synthetic processes can substitute conventional organic solvents with versatile ILs to improve safety, environmental impact and overall efficiency.2,6 There is extensive research surrounding the use of ILs over organic solvents. IL solvent systems have been successfully demonstrated in many applications including catalysis,7–10 electrochemical devices,11,12 solar cell design,13,14 and cellulose dissolution.15–17
Due to the successful application of ILs, the microscopic understanding of the solvation structure and molecule behavior in ILs is necessary and has drawn interest over the last decades.18–22 The study of IL dynamics has been quite challenging due to the complexity of the many interactions that take place at distinct timescale domains in solution.23–25 In this work, the use of pump–probe time-resolved spectroscopic techniques is convenient because it can provide direct information about the real time dynamics of molecular species in solution through monitoring IR sensitive bonds.26–28 A large amount of literature exists regarding the behavior of chromophores dissolved in IL, and in particular, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) has been utilized to investigate the solvation dynamics over a broad range of timescales, especially using the molecular probe coumarin 153.29–32 Specifically, Maroncelli et al. investigated the complete solvation dynamics of coumarin 153 in a series of 21 ILs. The study claimed bimodal behavior, where a fast time component correlated with ion masses and a slower time component was related to the IL solvent viscosity.32
The molecule of interest 4-(dimethylamino)benzonitrile, DMABN (Scheme 1), is an archetypal push–pull chromophore presenting dual (or anomalous) fluorescence.33 Such a feature is quite interesting and can be used to extract information on solvent effects because the relative intensities of the two emission peaks are polarity dependent. In nonpolar solvents the expected Stokes shifted emission band is dominant, whereas in polar solvents a much lower energy band appears. The simplest and most accepted explanation to describe the DMABN dual fluorescence was first proposed by Grabowski et al.,33,34 where they attributed the higher energy emission peak to a planar locally excited (LE) and the lower energy emission peak to a highly polar twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state, where the dimethylamino group is perpendicular to the aromatic ring. Since then, different models for the ICT state, in addition to the TICT state, were proposed involving a planar (PICT),35 wagged (WICT),36 rehybridized (RICT)37 and even a distinct dark TICT state.38 Although the two-state equilibrium is sufficient to explain most of the experimental low time resolution results in the DMABN photocycle, the detailed interconversion mechanism between the LE and ICT states is still controversial. A detailed description of the different models proposed for the LE–ICT interconversion is available in the review of Grabowski et al.34 A more recent discussion can be found in the work of Rhinehart et al.39,40 Despite the controversies of the early stages of the complete photochemical cycle of DMABN, the ICT state of DMABN in this work was chosen to probe the solvation dynamics of ILs. Generally, solvent relaxation in ILs occurs orders of magnitude slower than in conventional organic solvents, such as acetonitrile. Therefore, the dynamics under investigation are not under the influence of the controversial very fast structural changes of the LE–ICT reaction path, but only with the solvation relaxation within the ICT state.

To the best of our knowledge there are only two papers available in the literature concerning the photophysics of DMABN in ILs. Samanta et al. investigated the dual fluorescence behavior of DMABN in hexafluorophosphate 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, BMIPF6.41,42 Their results show that a decrease in temperature causes a blue shift of the ICT emission from non-relaxed states as a consequence of the incomplete solvation. Another important result regards the dependence of the ICT emission intensity band with the excitation wavelength. This phenomenon was attributed to the microheterogeneity associated with the polar and nonpolar domains of the IL because different solvation states lead to distinct excitation energies.41 In another paper, Santhosh and Samanta used time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) to investigate the rate of the electron transfer reaction of DMABN in BMIPF6. Here they concluded that the LE–ICT transformation is controlled by the intramolecular structure reorganization, instead of the slow solvation dynamics.42
Time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy has been used to investigate DMABN excited states in conventional solvents since Hashimoto and Hamaguchi used nanosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to characterize the vibrational features from the ICT singlet state and triplet state.43 Since then, the development of higher time resolution techniques, including time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, has helped unravel several important features associated with the LE–ICT conversion mechanism.39,40,44–49 Kwok et al. proposed the presence of another species in alcoholic solutions which they attribute to a hydrogen bonded ICT state (HICT) adding to the knowledge of behaviors of DMABN in conventional organic solvents using time-resolved spectroscopy.50,51
In this work we investigate for the first time the solvation structure and dynamics of imidazolium ILs by time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) using DMABN as a probe. We discuss the ground state IR and the LE–ICT interconversion mechanism in imidazolic ILs formed by a series of different anions and compare the IL results to data obtained in tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a reference. It is important to mention that our objective is not to discuss the LE–ICT mechanism in detail, but to focus on the solvation relaxation process within the ICT state of DMABN in ionic liquids by monitoring the ν(CN) mode at different time delays. The results indicate that DMABN is probing the polar domains of the IL, the LE–ICT conversion in IL is similar to that observed in conventional solvents, and the ICT solvation relaxation is bimodal and directly dependent on the ionic liquid viscosities.
Experimental
Materials
4-(Dimethylamino)benzonitrile was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (>98%), BMIBF4, hexafluorophosphate, BMIPF6 and bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide, BMITFSI (Scheme 1) were purchased from Iolitec.
The ionic liquids were dried using an ultra-vacuum pump (Edwards – Tic Pumping Station – Model RV3) prior to use. The DMABN was added in order to have a final solution concentration of ca. 0.05 mol L−1.
Spectroscopic measurements
The dissolved DMABN samples were placed in a sealed semi-demountable cell that uses two CaF2 windows with a 100 micron Teflon spacer. The femtosecond TRIR experiment was performed using a Coherent Ti:sapphire oscillator and regenerative amplifier (1 KHz, 50 fs FWHM). Pump pulses (300 nm) are generated with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) with a tunable UV/vis attachment. Mid-IR probe pulses were generated with an OPA and difference frequency generation (DFG) attachment that allows the generation of probe energies ranging from 2500–800 cm−1. Pump and probe polarizations are set at the magic angle (54.7°) to eliminate rotational and reorientation effects. For all the samples a prompt bleach of the vibrational bands associated with the ground state of DMABN were observed. The spectra were recorded at different pump–probe delay times (up to 3 nanoseconds) using an optical delay line consisting of a computer-controlled, motorized translation stage mounted with a retroreflector. Pump pulse power was recorded ca. 1.8 mW at the sample position. The sample cell was translated on a motorized Z stage continuously during data collection to prevent degradation. Kinetic traces were analyzed using the Origin Pro 2016 program by fitting to a sum of exponential terms, , with independent amplitudes Ai, lifetimes τi and offset C. The instrument response FWHM (full width at half maximum) was approximately 300 fs. All experiments were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Ground state IR
The ground state IR spectra of DMABN dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and in the imidazolium (BMI) ionic liquids (BF4, PF6 and TFSI) are shown in Fig. 1a. The comparison between the spectra in THF and DMSO illustrates the polarity effect on the ν(CN) band, where a shift to lower wavenumbers and a broadening in more polar media can be observed (Table 1). The shift is a direct consequence of the more polar environment, which stabilizes the charge separation in the ground state, thereby decreasing the CN bond order. The broadening effect is not so straightforward but it can be attributed to two main contributions, the slow solvation dynamics in DMSO in comparison to THF, and to inhomogeneous broadening due to higher distribution of solvation states in polar media.52 It is worth mentioning we chose only aprotic solvents and ionic liquids to discard any contribution of hydrogen bonding associated species.

The ν(CN) band shift of DMABN observed in ionic liquids cannot be correlated with the polarity of the ionic liquids, but with the effective anion charge as pointed out by Deng et al., who demonstrated the use of benzonitrile as an IR probe of the local environment in ionic liquids.52 The wavenumber of the ν(CN) mode was linearly correlated with the reciprocal volume of the anion in imidazolium ionic liquids. This relationship was attributed to the electric field generated by the Coulombic forces between the ions, indicating DMABN mainly probes the polar domains of ionic liquids. Such interpretation was based on a vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy study, where the ν(CN) shift is linearly correlated to the electric field parallel to the CN bond.52,53Fig. 1b shows the ν(CN) band wavenumber values for DMABN as a function of the reciprocal anion volume, showing the exact same behavior of benzonitrile.52 The direct relation of the ν(CN) frequency with the effective anion charge in fact indicates that DMABN probes the charged domains of ionic liquids rather than the nonpolar domains.
In addition to the band shift, it is worth noting the analysis of the FWHM of the ν(CN) band (Table 1). The FWHM for the ionic liquids is larger in comparison to conventional solvents, and it increases as the anion size increases. This reflects the slow solvation dynamics in ionic liquids, which will be explored within the following section.
Time resolved IR

Fig. 2 shows the time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectra in 3D view for DMABN solutions in THF and in the three ionic liquids investigated within the region of the DMABN ground and TICT states. In all spectra the ground state ν(CN) bleach at ca. 2210–2215 cm−1 and the ICT state ν(CN) transient bond at ca. 2090–2100 cm−1 are clearly seen. As pointed by Kwok et al.51 the ν(CN) from the LE state (at ca. 2180 cm−1) does not appear in TRIR spectra being only observed by time-resolved Raman spectroscopy.48 Regardless of the solvent, the ground state bleach does not recover within 3 ns due to a well-characterized intersystem crossing (ISC) from the singlet ICT state to a long-lived triplet state before it decays to the ground state.47 As can be observed in Fig. 2, the ν(CN) band assigned to the singlet ICT state at ca. 2100 cm−1 is attained in few picoseconds in all solvents and persists into the nanosecond timescale.

The corresponding LE–ICT equilibration (τeq) and ICT (τICT) lifetime constants were obtained from the kinetic traces based on the integrated area of the ν(CN) band of the ICT state from Lorentzian fitting. The ν(CN) band growth and the decay were treated separately and followed monoexponential behaviors, whose constants are listed in Table 2. The value of the LE–ICT equilibration lifetime (τeq) in THF (13 ps) obtained in this work is the same as reported in the paper of Kwok et al.,51 but the lifetime of the ICT state (1.3 ns) is shorter than the reported (3.6 ns). It is not clear why these last values show a discrepancy, since the only difference between the experiments was pump wavelength (300 nm this work and 273 nm Kwok et al.51).

Since the ICT state is more polar than the LE state, it is expected that polar solvents shift the equilibrium towards the ICT state. In conventional solvents of similar viscosities but different polarities, for example, THF and acetonitrile, the τeq is ca. 13 ps and 6 ps, respectively.51
As given in Table 2, the LE–ICT τeq in imidazolic ionic liquids are found to have intermediate values in comparison to the molecular solvents and are nearly the same (τeq ∼ 10 ps) regardless of the anion. It is worth mentioning that Santhosh and Samanta, in a fluorescence investigation of DMABN in BMIPF6, could not determine the τeq directly from the rise of the ICT emission peak. Instead, they estimated the value from the decay of the LE emission and found a reaction time of 100 ps, which they attributed to a slow structural rearrangement of the molecule in more viscous media.42 In contrast, our TRIR results show the LE–TICT τeq has the same magnitude as the values determined in molecular solvents, and seems to be insensitive to viscosity. These findings are reasonable and confirm that the LE–ICT equilibrium is dependent almost exclusively on the intramolecular reorganization of DMABN.
The ICT lifetime (τeq) is >1 ns in all the solvents, and its value is essentially determined by the ISC rate to the triplet state. As such conversion occurs on the nanosecond scale, it is out of the scope of the experiments performed herein and the results will not be discussed in detail. The comparison between the τICT values in ionic liquids suggests a dependence on the viscosity but further experiments on longer timescales as well as with temperature variation would be required to infer about such dependency. The important point here is that the ICT state is long-lived and allows the solvation dynamics to a relaxed ICT state to be monitored, as discussed below.
ICT solvation dynamics
With DMABN photoexcitation, there is an effective charge transfer which produces a huge change in the DMABN dipole moment from the ground state to the ICT state (Δμ ∼ 10 D). This means that immediately after the molecule reaches the ICT state, it resides in a non-relaxed solvation cage. The solvent molecules will promptly reorganize to stabilize the new condition, decreasing the energy of the electronic state. This process is directly reflected in the dynamic-fluorescence Stokes shift of the ICT emission.34 In particular, as emphasized by Santhosh and Samanta,42 even though DMABN exhibits character from multiple excited states, it is an appropriate molecular probe to measure the solvation dynamics, even in viscous ionic liquids such as BMIPF6. Since the solvent relaxation directly affects the energy of the ICT state, it is expected that it will also affect the nitrile bond moiety. The detailed analysis of the ν(CN) frequency in all solvents shows a dynamic shift to lower wavenumbers with time.

Fig. 3 shows the respective ν(CN) frequency as a function of time in THF and in the imidazolium ionic liquids. The kinetic traces followed biexponential behavior, whose time constants are presented in Table 3 together with the relative amplitude (%) associated with each constant. Fig. 3 clearly shows the differences in the ν(CN) shift with time between ionic liquids and THF. As expected, in THF there is a sharp decrease showing much faster kinetics, since THF has a viscosity at least two orders of magnitude lower than the ionic liquids. The two estimated lifetimes obtained from biexponential fitting in THF were τ1 = 2.0 ps and τ2 = 23 ps. The value of τ1 is similar to the value for dielectric relaxation of THF (3.9 ps).55 Therefore, it suggests that τ1 can be related to the dipolar solvent reorganization of the first solvation shell that occurs within 2 ps in the case of THF. The second time constant (τ2 = 23 ps) is 10-fold longer than the solvent relaxation. In a recent paper, Park et al. revisited the early events of the ICT reaction dynamics of DMABN using ultrahigh resolution time-resolved fluorescence.56 The authors investigated DMABN in acetonitrile solution and proposed a model where a partially twisted ICT state is formed within a few hundred femtoseconds and this state undergoes further relaxation to the complete twisted ICT state with a time constant of 4.8 ps.56 This lifetime was obtained from the Stokes shift from the center of the fluorescence band and is much longer than the dielectric relaxation of acetonitrile (∼0.2 ps). Therefore, this process was assigned to the relaxation of the intramolecular coordinate, and it was suggested to be the rotation of the dimethylamino group to the perpendicular position.56 Using this concept here, the dynamic Stokes shift can be correlated directly with the dynamic ν(CN) shift, and the second lifetime of τ2 = 23 ps obtained in THF by TRIR can be attributed to the rotation of the dimethylamino group, in agreement with the model proposed by Park et al.56 The time constant associated with the rotation of the dimethylamino group is likely dependent on both polarity and the viscosity of the medium, which would explain the difference in the values obtained for acetonitrile (4.8 ps) and THF (23 ps). The higher polarity of acetonitrile in comparison to THF favors the partial twisted structure and its low viscosity allows a faster rotation of the dimethylamino group.

It is worth mentioning that Rhinehart et al. also observed the dynamic downshift of the ν(CN) band by femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy of DMABN in methanol, with a lifetime of ca. 7 ps, that could not be attributed to vibrational relaxation processes.40 Instead, based on observations of Kwok et al.50,51 the authors proposed the “shift” as a consequence of the partial superposition of distinct bands attributed to the free and hydrogen bonding DMABN.40 Our results show the dynamic downshift of the ν(CN) bond also occurs in solvents where there is no possibility of hydrogen bonding. Therefore, the lifetime of ca. 7 ps observed for the ν(CN) downshift in methanol by Rhinehart et al.40 is probably attributed to two simultaneous effects, the appearance of the hydrogen bonding species and the dynamic ν(CN) shift caused by the rotation of the dimethylamino group. For this reason, we decided to not consider protic solvents in this study, and further investigation is necessary in order to understand the contribution of each component over the lifetime associated to the ν(CN) downshift.
Regarding the ionic liquids, both the τ1 and τ2 values are much longer in comparison to THF. In fact, the analysis of the time constants for the ν(CN) shift with different anions clearly indicates a correlation with ionic liquid viscosity (Table 2). By analogy with THF, we can consider τ1 to represent the timescale involved in the dielectric relaxation associated with rearrangement of the first neighbor ions surrounding the ICT state, and assign τ2 to the rotation of the dimethylamino group to reach the twisted conformation.
As previously discussed for the ground state IR spectra of DMABN in ionic liquids (Fig. 1), the nitrile bond is sensitive to the electric field between the ions, i.e. it probes mostly the polar microdomains within the ILs. With photoexcitation to the ICT state the dipole moment increases dramatically. So, it is expected that as soon the ICT state is reached, in order to be stabilized there will be a tendency for the molecule to have a stronger interaction with the imidazolium cation considering the negative nitrile moiety, and with the anion considering the positive dimethylamino group. Therefore, we can suppose τ1 will be defined by the Coulombic forces between the ions and the liquid viscosity, whereas the τ2 values will only depend on the solvent friction probed by the rotation of the dimethylamino group from a partially to a totally twisted ICT state. This reasoning would explain why the values obtained for τ1 are similar in all three IL, while a more significant difference can be observed in the comparison of the τ2 values. This reinforces the model that considered the evolution from a partially twisted ICT to a totally twisted ICT during the solvation proposed by Park et al.56 It is interesting to note that the value estimated for the total solvation time of BMIPF6 by TRIR of ca. 875 ps (Table 3) is quite similar to the value obtained by Santhosh and Samanta by dynamic-fluorescence Stokes shift of the ICT emission (980 ps).42 Such results show how the direct analysis of a single parameter, i.e. the ν(CN) shift with time can reveal the solvation dynamics in both conventional solvents and ionic liquids.
Finally, from the biexponential fits of the kinetics it was possible to determine the ν(CN) frequency values in the ICT state at time zero (t = 0) and at infinite time (t = ∞), i.e. the frequency of nitrile stretching from the totally solvent unrelaxed and relaxed ICT state, respectively (Table 3). The plot of the ν(CN) values at both times as a function of the anion reciprocal volume (Fig. 4) again show a linear correlation for the ICT excited state, as was observed for DMABN in the ground state (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 4  Linear correlation between ν(CN) frequency and reciprocal volume of the anion obtained from the biexponential fits of the kinetics shown in Fig. 3 for (a) time zero (t = 0) and (b) infinite time (t = ∞). 
The linear relationship illustrates an important result since, aside from the fact that the dimethylamino group is twisted in the ICT state in relation to the aromatic ring, the only difference between the ground and excited ICT state is the magnitude of the dipole moment. Therefore, this could explain why the slopes from the ICT curves are practically twice those found for the ground state. Thus, the benzonitrile moiety probes the polar domains of the ionic liquids in both electronic states. This supports the use of DMABN as a molecular probe to measure the dipolar relaxation associated with ionic or molecular solvents by monitoring the shift of ν(CN) with time, as well as the solvent friction by determining the time constant of rotation of the dimethylamino group.
Conclusions
Ground state IR spectroscopy combined with time-resolved infrared spectroscopy (TRIR) of DMABN was successfully employed to obtain important information about the solvation structure and dynamics in imidazolium ionic liquids. The ν(CN) frequency values were linearly correlated with the inverse of the IL anion volume, revealing that DMABN is sensitive to the effective charge between the ions in both electronic ground and excited ICT states. The kinetics associated with the rise of the ν(CN) transient band assigned to the ICT state led to the conclusion that the lifetime kinetics of LE–ICT conversion in ionic liquids is similar to polar solvents, confirming that such process is quite dependent on the intramolecular reorganization of DMABN, instead of the solvation dynamics. On the other hand the ν(CN) frequency dependency with time revealed two distinct time constants, where the first could be assigned to the dipolar relaxation and the second to the rotation of the dimethylamino group, both dependent on solvent polarity and viscosity.
