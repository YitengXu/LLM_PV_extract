Compared with non-crosslinked corresponding heterojunctions and mono-crosslinked corresponding heterojunctions, inter-crosslinked heterojunctions with and without the addition of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) showed well-maintained and stable morphology after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 8 hours, in which the large-scale phase separation caused by the aggregation of fullerenes was dramatically suppressed. Although the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM blend efficiently improved the stability of device with respect to a non-crosslinked corresponding heterojunction device, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) still decreased to an half of its initial efficiency value after annealing at 150 °C for 8 h. On the contrary, a remarkably enhanced stability was obtained in inter-crosslinked devices with performance maintained at 60% for PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and at 79% for PBDTTT-V:PCBD. It is worthy to note that the device based on PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD showed comparable performance to the non-crosslinked one, indicating that the inter-crosslinking of both donor and acceptor with unsaturated bonds is a promising approach to ensure a device with long-term thermal stability, and maintain the good performance at the same time.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are a promising alternative for clean and renewable energy because of their potential application in flexible, light-weight, and low-cost large-area devices through roll-to-roll printing.1–4 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC, where the photoactive layer is composed of a blend of a p-type conjugated polymer and an n-type fullerene derivative, has become one of the most successful device structures for exciton dissociation to date.5–10 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stabilities of the device require further improvement before they can become truly competitive.11 Nanomorphology of the photoactive layer is one of the most important factors that heavily limits the efficiency and stability of the PSC. A key issue is that the lifetime of the exciton is short, its diffusion length in organic materials is only about 10–20 nm,12–17 which means that this is also the optimal physical dimension of the domains in the heterojunction. Besides the control of the nanoscale morphology of the blend, continuous percolation pathways are also required through each phase.18,19
Most BHJ systems show poor stability and often undergo macrophase segregation of the blend components. Thermal annealing of the films has been used to control this phase separation.20 During the thermal annealing, both the donor and acceptor crystallize to form a nanoscale interpenetrating network which drastically enhances the device performance.8 However, this morphology is not stable after prolonged exposure to heat and may gradually undergo changes since the donor and acceptor prefer to segregate from each other under long periods of thermal annealing,21–23 which drastically decreased the performance of the device.
The instability of the active layer hinders the application of organic solar cells greatly. Different strategies have been developed to improve the stability of the organic photovoltaic devices, such as developing thermo-cleavable polymers,24 elevating the Tg temperature of donor materials,21,22,25 and creating block-copolymers by combining the donor polymer with the acceptor part to form stable bi-continuous networks by supra-molecular forces.26–29 Another approach is to cross-link the active layer by using a crosslinkable donor,30–32 acceptor33–35 or interfacial materials.36,37 In our previous works, we have synthesized a photocrosslinkable polythiophene copolymer containing light-sensitive bromoalkyl substituents used as p-type materials in BHJ devices. Although the PCE was not high, the devices showed high stability undergo long time thermal annealing after crosslinking.38 However, most reported work relied on a mono-crosslinked system, that is, either a crosslinkable donor or crosslinkable acceptor was employed to improve the device stability, which could not enhance the whole active layer stability in a very real sense.
In this work, we further explore our work and develop a novel approach for thermally stable BHJ solar cells based on the inter-crosslinked active layer, where the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor are both functionalized with the unsaturated vinyl crosslinkable group to produce an inter-crosslinked network between donor and acceptor. A new crosslinkable low band-gap copolymer poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,6-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl-2-ethylhexan-1-one-alt-4,8-bis(oct-7-en-1-yloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene} (PBDTTT-V) with vinyl groups (Scheme 1), and a new crosslinkable fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid dec-9-en-1-yl ester (PCBD) containing vinyl group were thus synthesized (Scheme 2), and employed into BHJ photovoltaic devices. A non-crosslinkable polymer poly{4,8-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-4,6-thieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl-2-ethylhexan-1-one} (PBDTTT) without vinyl groups was also synthesized for the comparison. The effects of inter-crosslinking of the donor and acceptor on the morphology and the related thermal stability of BHJ solar cells have been evaluated systematically.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and molecular characterization
The synthetic route to the copolymers PBDTTT and PBDTTT-V is outlined in Scheme 1. 4,8-Dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,8-dion was reacted with 8-bromo-1-octene to yield compound 2. Compound 2 was lithiated using n-butyllithium, and then reacted with tributyl tin groups in order to conduct Stille coupling polymerization. PBDTTT was synthesized following the method given in literature.39 Monomer 3 and monomer 4 were reacted with monomer 5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 to afford polymer PBDTTT-V. The monomer feed ratio of 3 to 4 was chosen to be 1:5 which could provide sufficient crosslinkable groups per polymer chain for the high crosslinking efficiency.30 PCBD was synthesized from [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in two steps (Scheme 2). Further details of the synthesis and characterization of the molecules are given in the ESI.†
The thermal property of the polymers is determined by TGA under a nitrogen atmosphere in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The temperature of 5% weight loss is chosen as the onset point of decomposition (Td). Similar to the polymer PBDTTT, PBDTTT-V almost shows little weight loss when heated up to 322 °C, which shows that the thermal stability of the polymer is not affected by the introduction of vinyl groups as the side chains.
Optical and electrochemical properties
Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption of the pristine films and blend films with PCBM or PCBD. In Fig. 1A, despite a slight absorption enhancement in the long wavelength related to lamellar structure after the incorporation of vinyl groups into the polymer, the absorption bands of PBDTTT and PBDTTT-V are quite similar, indicating that the introduction of vinyl groups as the side chains had little effect on the conjugation length.32 Similar absorption profiles are also observed in the films of the polymers and fullerene blends (polymer:fullerene = 1:1.5) (Fig. 1B). Increasing the ratio of PCBD, but not changing the total weight of the fullerene derivatives, almost did not affect the absorption spectra of the blend films, except for a slight disruption in the lamellar structure of the polymer. Unchanged absorption spectra of polymers and polymer:fullerene blends before and after modification suggests that the vinyl groups hardly destroy intermolecular interactions and the molecular packing in the active layer.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to investigate the molecular energy levels of the materials (Fig. S5A in the ESI†).40 The two polymers possess almost identical electrochemical redox characteristics. For PBDTTT, the onset potential for oxidation is located around 0.22 V versus Ag/AgNO3, which corresponds to a highest occupied molecular orbital of −5.04 eV. The LUMO energy level of PBDTTT is calculated to be −3.25 eV based on the onset potential for reduction at around −1.57 V. In comparison with PBDTTT, both the oxidation and reduction potential of PBDTTT-V are only slightly reduced. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTTT-V are −5.07 and −3.29 eV, respectively. Using similar methods, the HOMO and LUMO levels of PCBD are calculated to be −6.09 and −4.21 eV, respectively. Also, the map of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals and the energy level of the materials are presented in Fig. 2. It is evident that the LUMO level of PCBD is higher than that of PCBM, which would render a higher value open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the photovoltaic devices.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
Fig. S6 (in the ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the bulk samples of PBDTTT and PBDTTT-V. Both samples show crystalline diffraction peaks at low angles, attributed to a lamellar structure. The crystalline diffraction peak of PBDTTT is slightly sharper than that of PBDTTT-V, meaning that PBDTTT has a more ordered molecular packing, which is consistent with the UV observation. When the PCBM was blended, then annealed at 150 °C for 2 h, diffraction peaks at high angles caused by PCBM crystallites are obvious in both the XRD patterns of the non-crosslinked PBDTTT:PCBM without a crosslinking network and the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM blends with a polymer-produced crosslinking system (Fig. 3). However, these peaks attributed to fullerene derivates are absent in the diffractograms of annealed inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD thin films. The results demonstrate that only heat induced inter-crosslinking of donor and acceptor can efficiently inhibit the big aggregation of fullerene derivates and increase the stability of the formation of nanometer-sized microphase separation, which is also supported by AFM (discussed later).

Evaluation of the crosslinkability of the molecules
We investigated the crosslinkability of PBDTTT-V upon thermal annealing by monitoring the insolubility of the film in organic solvents. Namely, the polymers and blend films were prepared by spin-coating on quartz substrates, annealed at 150 °C for 2 h under N2 atmosphere, and then measured by UV-vis spectroscopy. After that, the samples were immersed into DCB for 5 min and dried, and then the UV-vis spectra were measured again to check the amount of the polymers remaining on the substrates. Fig. 4A shows that no absorption in the PBDTTT film was observed after the immersion, indicating that PBDTTT was almost completely dissolved into DCB. On the contrary, PBDTTT-V still retained a strong absorption after undergoing the same treatment (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the polymer was crosslinked at the side chains by the thermal annealing and thus became insoluble in organic solvents.32

Similar insolubility of PBDTTT-V was also observed in the polymer:PCBM blend films (Fig. 4D). For the non-crosslinked PBDTTT:PCBM film on the substrate, the absorption of both PBDTTT and PCBM disappeared completely after immersion (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, after the immersion, the absorption of the polymer in the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM film still remained about three quarters of the intensity with respect to the untreated film. This suggests that PBDTTT-V was thermally crosslinkable even in the blend films coated with PCBM. Fig. 5 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of annealing blend films after washing from solvent. The results that depict the crosslinking of vinyl groups in PCBD occurred in the blend films after thermal annealing. The absorption of the fullerene derivatives existed in the inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD films after the immersion, while the absorption of PCBM in the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM film disappeared completely, as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, PCBM cannot be well kept in polymer-produced crosslinking blends, but can be stored in a donor and acceptor inter-crosslinking system.

Thermal stability of the PSC devices
Fig. 6 shows the current–voltage characteristics under illumination for polymer photovoltaic (PV) devices with PBDTTT:PCBM (1:1.5 w/w), PBDTTT-V:PCBM (1:1.5 w/w), PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD (4:5:1 w/w) and PBDTTT-V:PCBD (1:1.5 w/w). The parameters for these PV cells are summarized in Table 1. All of the devices showed similar Voc, except for the device based on PBDTTT-V:PCBD with a slightly increased Voc, which is consistent with the higher LUMO level of PCBD compared to that of PCBM. Seen from Table 1, introducing a crosslinkable group to the active layer reduced the device performance to some extent, probably due to the crosslinked network slightly disturbing the lamella structure of the polymer, which is evidenced by UV and XRD observation. Nevertheless, the performances of the devices with PBDTTT-V:PCBM, PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD were comparable to that with PBDTTT:PCBM.

In order to evaluate the device stability, bulk heterojunction devices with PBDTTT:PCBM, PBDTTT-V:PCBM, PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD were fabricated and were subsequently annealed at 150 °C for different times in a glovebox filled with N2 atmosphere. PBDTTT-V and PCBD were crosslinked in the bulk heterojunction films during this long-term thermal annealing process, which were confirmed by the insolubility of the films in DCB. Fig. 7 shows that the performance of the non-crosslinked PBDTTT:PCBM device rapidly decreased as the annealing time increased. Incorporation of the crosslinkable vinyl groups into the polymer efficiently improves the stability of a device with mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM, but the PCE still decreased to half of its initial efficiency value after annealing at 150 °C for 8 h. In sharp contrast, modification on both the donor and acceptor by crosslinkable groups led to a remarkable enhancement in device stability, with device performance maintained at 60% for PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and even 79% for PBDTTT-V:PCBD. The very stable device characteristics illustrate that the crosslinked network formed by the cooperation inter-crosslinking of PBDTTT-V and PCBD in the blend could sterically reduce the crystallinity of the fullerene materials and restrict them from fast immigration upon thermal heating,34,41 consequently preventing large-scale phase separation and maintaining the well-defined morphology of the active layer.

The maintained morphology under heating also can be elucidated by optical microscopy (OM) (Fig. 8). Thermal annealing of the non-crosslinked PBDTTT:PCBM blend at 150 °C for 8 h induced a big aggregated domain of many needle-like PCBM crystals shown in the optical micrograph, which should be responsible for the sharply decreased performance when annealed at high temperature.42–46 However, only a small amount of PCBM aggregation was observed in mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM film after 8 h of annealing. Delightfully, the morphology of the inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD blends remained almost unchanged before and after thermal annealing. Therefore, the inter-crosslinking of donor and acceptor simultaneously is a promising approach to suppress large phase segregation and maintain the well-ordered nanoscale morphology.

To gain a deeper insight into the morphologies of the active layers on the nanoscale, we also measured the images of the above-mentioned four blends after thermal heating by using AFM (Fig. 9). After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 8 h, the film for PBDTTT:PCBM revealed a rough surface morphology with the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.25 nm at 5 μm × 5 μm scan size, and with a lot of large pinholes and dark areas. This significant phase separation may produce poor contact between the active layer and the electrode, and yield unfavorable conditions for charge separation and transport as well. Comparatively, a finer morphology is observed for the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM film, and the RMS roughness is reduced to 0.89 nm. The decreased roughness of the composite film is because the crosslinked structure of the polymer can reduce the crystallinity of the fullerene materials and fix PCBM clusters in the polymer network with nano-scale dispersion. Obviously, the inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD films show much smoother surfaces after the thermal heating, and the RMS roughness is further lowered to 0.44 nm and 0.52 nm, respectively. The smooth surface would favor a better interfacial contact with electrodes, which is beneficial for charge abstraction and collection.

From these results we can see that the stability of PBDTTT has been improved greatly by the inter-crosslinked network formed between vinyl-functionalized donor and acceptor, however, the performance is also influenced by the quantity of crosslinkable groups, that is, crosslink density. Thus, the two aspects always seem to conflict. For instance, too many vinyl groups resulted in the efficiency falling from 3.6% for the non-crosslinked PBDTTT:PCBM device to 2.5% for the completely inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBD device. At the same time, the thermal stability of the devices has been remarkably improved with the amount of crosslinkable groups increasing. It is worthy to note that the device based on PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD showed comparable performance to the non-crosslinked one. Therefore, thermally stable BHJ solar cells with high performance can be achieved by carefully controlling the inter-crosslinked network.
Conclusions
In this study, we have first presented a novel approach for thermally stable BHJ solar cells based on the inter-crosslinking between the vinyl-functionalized low band-gap copolymer donor and vinyl-functionalized fullerene derivatives acceptor, namely PBDTTT-V and PCBD, respectively. Thermal annealing of the vinyl-functionalized PBDTTT-V and PCBD at 150 °C for 2 h can easily induce their crosslinking, confirmed by the insolubility of the films in organic solvents detected by UV-vis absorption spectra. In addition, in order to investigate the effect of inter-crosslinking of the donor and acceptor simultaneously on the device performance and stability, the PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD ternary blend and PBDTTT-V:PCBD binary blend have been constructed in BHJ solar cells compared with standard PBDTTT:PCBM blend and mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM blend. Obviously, for the standard devices with pristine-PBDTTT:PCBM, efficiency decreased rapidly as the annealing time increased. Although the mono-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM blend efficiently improved the stability of device compared with the pristine-PBDTTT:PCBM device, the PCE still decreased to an half of its initial efficiency value after annealing at 150 °C for 8 h. In contrast, the inter-crosslinked PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and PBDTTT-V:PCBD systems showed well-maintained and stable morphologies after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 8 hours by suppressing PCBM diffusion and phase separation, as confirmed with AFM and optical microscopy images. As a result, there was a significant improvement in device stability, retaining 60% of their initial device efficiency for PBDTTT-V:PCBM:PCBD and 79% of their initial device efficiency for PBDTTT-V:PCBD, even after long-term thermal annealing. This demonstrates that the inter-crosslinking system has allowed an optimal morphology of the active layer to mostly be preserved throughout the entire annealing process, thus leading to the remarkable long-term thermal stability of these devices. Too dense an inter-crosslinking morphology probably results in a slightly reduced performance of devices, thus carefully controlling the inter-crosslinking density should be taken into consideration to obtain stable BHJ solar cells with high performance.
