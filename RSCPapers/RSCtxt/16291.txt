    , Accepted 14th July 2020First published on 14th July 2020AbstractA triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a new energy harvester that converts small scale mechanical motions into electrical energy by a combination of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction through the periodic contact-separation and/or sliding movement between two tribo-materials with different abilities of gaining or losing electrical charges. This new approach to harvest mechanical energy can produce high power outputs capable of supplying equipment and sensors deployed in remote offshore locations and of supporting offshore activities whilst being able to be used in conjunction with traditional energy harvesting technologies. This review describes the fundamentals of TENGs and the existing energy harvesting modes, with focus on those more suitable for marine applications. Moreover, the equipment and offshore activities whose energy needs can be satisfied by TENGs are described and implementation schemes presented. We conclude that TENGs have high potential for numerous maritime applications, ranging from the demand of electronics used for metocean monitoring, signalling and surveillance, to activities such as offshore aquaculture or oil and gas exploration. The advantages of such systems as an alternative to currently existing solutions are also discussed, along with insights concerning applications that can take advantage of their high efficiency harvesting low amplitude and low frequency wave energy.
1. Introduction
For centuries, the oceans and rivers of the globe have served as vital, yet hazardous routes for trade, shipping and exploration of new land. With the advent of modern technologies, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS),1,2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)3 and high-resolution imaging,4–6 and the development of advanced sensor networks7 supported by advanced data analysis methodologies,8,9 new opportunities and challenges have opened up regarding monitoring, research, navigation and industry. One of the key paradigms that has emerged is the energy demand for fluvial and (remote) offshore activities, namely for underwater and surface metocean monitoring10–12 to support, e.g. weather forecasting,13 oceanography,14 aquaculture,15,16 maritime transportation and navigation,17 hydrodynamic studies,18 bathymetric surveying,19 monitoring of offshore structures,20 surveillance and security monitoring21,22 and exploration of deep-sea resources.23,24 Oceans and other inner water masses contain thousands of drifting and moored buoys, floaters and other platforms collecting data and supporting different activities, which need electrical power for the monitoring sensors, communication and telemetry equipment, control systems for ballast compensation and fishing feed, among many others functions. Nonetheless, that energy is difficult and more expensive to obtain in remote locations25 and an increased demand is expected in the near future, especially due to the increase of activities carried in the sea.26,27 Currently, most offshore systems have their own battery packs, each one charged by solar panels or, less frequently, by small-scale wind turbines. However, these traditional power generation alternatives have well-known drawbacks and may not be fully prepared for the future challenges of marine exploration.
The use of solar panels is nowadays a mature and relatively inexpensive option,28 although marine and fluvial applications may impose the use of non-standard and therefore more expensive solutions.29 Moreover, their power production is intermittent since it depends on the light conditions. On the other hand, due to the low energy density of solar energy (annual average of 170 W m−2)30 and the still low efficiencies of solar panels,31 large areas, not available in buoy and small floating platforms, may be needed to provide the required power output.
Small-scale wind energy harvesting technologies are also mature and can be used in autonomous offshore measurement stations and other platforms,32 but energy production is linked to the intermittency of the wind resource, which is, however, denser than the solar resource (around 500 W m−2).33 An important drawback is related to the fact that turbines themselves are a protrusion exposed to the harsh maritime environmental actions and the resulting loads may significantly impact the dynamics of the floating platform or buoy.
Therefore, innovative energy harvesting technologies that are low cost, non-intrusive, scalable and do not depend on day/night cycles should be preferably used to create truly self-powered and autonomous systems, able to survive in the ocean or other remote aquatic environments during long periods of time, to enhance the operation and applicability of buoys and other offshore platforms.
Marine energy resources are abundant, presenting an annual theoretical potential of approximately 151300 TW h.34 Among these, ocean wave energy stands out with a global potential resource of nearly 18500 TW h,35 being well distributed worldwide, persistent and presenting a high energy density of 2–3 kW m−2,33 and up to 6 kW m−2 during storms. It is worth mentioning that wind action over other limited masses of water (e.g., lakes, rivers) and/or ship navigation also generates waves,36 although far less energetic than ocean waves.
Several technologies are available to harvest wave energy,37,38 but not all are suitable to provide energy to autonomous offshore stations or platforms. Moreover, some relevant challenges still exist to the viable deployment of wave energy conversion technologies, mostly linked to the irregular nature of waves and the distribution of energy in both direction and frequency, alongside the seasonal variability of the resource that greatly influences the amount of energy that can effectively be harnessed.39 Furthermore, the marine environment itself is yet another obstacle to consider, due to the severe physical loads and bio-chemical degradation to which a device is subjected to during its life-cycle.40 Therefore, robust and low-maintenance systems are preferred for such application conditions.
The use of wave energy converts in self-powered sensor buoys has already been tested, namely by applying the well-known oscillating water column principle41 or other floating oscillating systems.42 However, the quest for exploring and understanding the ocean and its resources requires other solutions, eventually less limited in terms of power output and with performances less dependent on the resource characteristics, to satisfy these novel and demanding applications. In this regard, the harvesting of wave energy using triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is a very promising and also disruptive solution.43,44 TENGs have been developed considerably since their initial fabrication,45 with numerous potential applications, including particles matters removal,46 energy supply to footwear47 and self-powered active sensors,48 or even prevention of metal corrosion.49 A key characteristic of this innovative technology is its ability to harvest energy efficiently from low amplitude and frequency oscillations, which are typical of many ocean systems.50,51
This review paper presents the state-of-art of triboelectric nanotechnologies for wave energy conversion systems and also future perspectives in the scope of autonomous, self-powered sensor buoys and other offshore small-scale floating platforms. While other papers have focused on the more distant vision of using TENGs for large scale energy conversion,52,53 this review focus on the needs of the thousands of different wave buoys that are permanently deployed at sea and that carry a wide range of critical offshore activities. We provide a detailed description, analysis, and implementation schemes of the equipment and offshore activities whose energy needs can presently be satisfied by TENGs. We demonstrate that there is a demand for energy harvesting systems able to feed sensors and lighting equipment integrated in wave buoys that are essential to attain data (e.g., wave climate and water quality) or to assist vessels with their navigation courses, allowing for the continuous monitoring of large areas both nearshore and in deep waters. The review paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the fundamentals of TENGs, namely the commonly used triboelectric materials, their characteristics and improvement procedures. Particular attention is given to the TENG basic modes of operation and general applications. Section 3 focuses on the existing oceanic surface buoys and instrumentation associated with traditional offshore activities, comparing their design, materials, mooring and power systems and energetic needs, by application field. Next, Section 4 is centred on specific marine applications of TENGs, presenting an overview of the principles for wave energy harvesting, followed by the technical details of such applications. The last section presents and discusses the main conclusions regarding the introduction of TENGs onto oceanic surface buoys for offshore activities, with the scope of meeting the demand of electronics used for such activities as an alternative to the currently existing solutions on the market.
2. Triboelectric nanogenerators
2.1. Triboelectric materials
A triboelectric nanogenerator is a new electrical energy generation technology that appeared in 2012 as a novel approach to harvest ambient mechanical motions into electric power with high efficiency and producing high output powers.54–58 A basic TENG structure consists of two triboelectric layers with opposite tribo-polarities, an air gap between them and two metallic electrodes (Fig. 1). The periodical contact-separation or sliding motion of the two tribo-materials then leads to the generation of electrical energy through a combination of contact-induced electrification and electrostatic induction. In fact, when the two tribo-materials come into contact, surface transference of electron or ions occurs between them (contact electrification), creating an electrical potential difference upon separation. By cyclically contacting and separating these charged surfaces, electrons will flow through an external load, generating a large electrical output.59–62
 Fig. 1  Structure of a basic TENG composed by two materials with opposite tribo-polarities and two metallic electrodes. 
The contact electrification performance depends significantly on the materials chosen as triboelectric layers, as these affect the amount of surface charges generated. The triboelectric polarity refers to the ability of a material for losing/gaining electrons:63 materials with positive electrical charges [such as glass, wool, silica, aluminium or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)] tend to lose electrons when contacting materials of opposite tendency [such as PET (polyethylene terephthalate), Kapton, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) or PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)], which tend to gain electrons during the contact electrification process. In general, most materials have triboelectrification effects, including metals, polymers and wood. All these materials are potential candidates to fabricate new energy harvesting devices, but to maximize performance, materials selection for TENGs is based on the triboelectric series that orders materials according to the polarity and the amount of charge that is transferred when coming in contact with another object (Fig. 2). Typically, materials close to each other show insignificant charge transfer, while the most distant materials in the series have the highest charge transfer between them.63–65 It is from this latter category that TENG materials are usually chosen and properly modified.66,67
 Fig. 2  Triboelectric series for the most promising series of materials (adapted from ref. 56 and 63). 
Beside the choice of triboelectric materials based on the triboelectric series, there are several strategies and engineering protocols to improve the TENG performance, as shown in Fig. 3. The enhancement of triboelectrification can be obtained by modifying surface morphologies by physical or chemical techniques. For example, nanopatterns such as pyramid-, square, or hemisphere-based have been used to enhance the effective contact area between the surfaces of the materials.56,63,68–70 However, relatively bulky (micrometer scale) structures on the surfaces can lead to excessive and undesirable friction forces and consequently degrade the electrical outputs generated by the triboelectric nanogenerator.56 On the other hand, nanoscale surface morphologies can restrict material selection, limit controllability and exhibit weak mechanical properties.71 Therefore, it is important to note that there can be a reduction of the TENG performance when the structure created on the surface is irregular because it can increase the friction force.56 Typically, the improvement of the efficiency of the nanogenerator with structured films can be related with:72
 Fig. 3  Strategies to improve TENG performance. 
• The sophisticated structures on films surface increasing the effective contact electrification and the tribo-charges generated on the surfaces during contact;
• Micro air-voids in the films can improve the capacitance change during pressing/bending process and induce an additional dielectric constant enhancement;
• A larger dipole moment formed in the microstructured films between the electrodes because of increased distance between the tribo-charges.
To further improve the output performance of TENGs, triboelectric films can be chemically modified using molecules, nanotubes, nanowires or nanoparticles, which enhance the surface charge density of tribo-materials improving triboelectrification. Surface functionalization can lead to a change in the triboelectric sequence of a given material in the triboelectric series due to a change of the surface potential.66 The doping of nanostructures/nanoparticles onto triboelectric materials and/or on its surfaces can change the effective permittivity and the triboelectric film thickness can be optimized using micro/nanomaterials. This will increase surface charge density and the relative permittivity of the tribo-materials to be effective for electrostatic induction. To increase the relative permittivity, the triboelectric films can also be doped with dielectric nanoparticles with high relative permittivity, such as Fe2O3 (εr = 14) or SrTiO3 (εr = 300).
Polymer doping was shown to improve TENG performance by increasing the amount of surface charges and the relative permittivity of the tribo-materials. Graphite particles mixed into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) led to a rise of the power density by a factor of 3;73 integrating polystyrene (PS) and carbon nanotubes onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film increased the surface charge density by a factor of 11.74 Furthermore, the functional groups exposed on the surface of organic material can be changed to enhance the surface chemical potential.75–77 For example, amine (fluoro) has the lowest (highest) tendency to gain electrons. Thus, as perfluorinated materials (such as Teflon) are the most triboelectrically negative choices, and they are covered with the fluoro group, it is possible to tune the triboelectric charge density by surface functionalization with molecules of this head group (–F).76
2.2. Basic modes of operation and general applications
TENGs are classified by the different electrodes configurations and/or different relative motion of the triboelectric materials to perform their fundamental electrostatic induction. Four basic modes have so far been realized:48,55,56,78,81,82 vertical contact-separation, lateral sliding, single-electrode, and freestanding triboelectric-layer. Each mode presents different theoretical frameworks at allow to evaluate the performance of TENGs in terms of the expected short-circuit transferred charges (QSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and general V–Q–x (voltage–charge–position) relationship. Table 1 shows a summary of the main equations of the relevant quantities that characterize TENGs. These equations provide a general understanding and guidance to increase the electrical outputs of TENGs.

2.2.1. Vertical contact-separation mode (VCTENG). 
Triboelectric nanogenerators based on the vertical contact-separation mode work by an intermittent impact or shock and can harvest energy from water motion or walking, for example. This mode can be divided into two types: dielectric/dielectric and conductor/dielectric [Fig. 4(a and b), respectively].78,83
 Fig. 4  Basic vertical contact-separation working of a TENG (adapted from ref. 56, 78 and 81): (a) dielectric/dielectric; (b) conductor/dielectric. 

Fig. 4(a) shows an example of this working mechanism for a triboelectric nanogenerator in the dielectric/dielectric vertical contact-separation working mode, when using two similar dielectric films and two electrodes on the top and the bottom surfaces of the assembled device structure. Dielectrics 1 and 2 are defined as having thicknesses d1 and d2, respectively. In the initial state [Fig. 4(a)-I], the two materials have no triboelectric charges on their surfaces. Applying an external force (bending or pressing the device), the distance (x) between the two triboelectric materials will vary and they will come into contact with each other [Fig. 4(a)-II]. At that time, charges transfer from one tribo-material to the other due to triboelectric effect.56 This way, one material will have negative static charges (density −σ) and the other positive static charges (density +σ), assuming that triboelectric charges are evenly distributed on the surfaces of both insulators. Removing the applied force [Fig. 4(a)-III], the distance x starts to increase and the surfaces of the two insulators, now with opposite tribo-charges, are separated. Therefore, an electric potential difference is induced between the upper and lower electrodes and the total instantaneous charges on each electrode is +Q and −Q.78 Electrons then flow between the electrodes through the external circuit, generating a positive current. Thus, the top and bottom electrodes accumulate induced charges with negative and positive sign, respectively [Fig. 4(a)-IV]. Applying again an external force, the distance between the triboelectric surfaces decreases and, consequently, electrons flow from the top electrode back to the bottom electrode (negative current) and there is a decrease of the amount of induced charges [Fig. 4(a)-V]. When the two triboelectric materials return to the initial state, the power generation process restarts [Fig. 4(a)-II].56,84 In Fig. 4(b) the working mechanism is very similar but dielectric 1 is replaced by metal 1, which plays the roles of triboelectric layer and electrode.78
Triboelectric nanogenerators working on the contact-separation mode are characterized by simple designs and high power densities84 with several designs, such as arch-shaped, zigzag-structured or spring-supported, having been developed.


2.2.2. Lateral sliding mode (LSTENG). 
The lateral sliding-mode TENG has an identical structural design and types as the vertical contact-separation mode [Fig. 5(a)].78 This working mode has the bottom part fixed but the top part slides along the longitudinal direction, so that two basic triboelectrification processes can occur: contact and lateral sliding.56 When two triboelectric materials come in contact by a sliding motion parallel to the surfaces, opposite triboelectric charges are also created on their surfaces [+σ at dielectric 1 and −σ at dielectric 2; Fig. 5(a)-I]. Applying a lateral external force, a tribo-polarization occurs along the sliding direction by an alternative change in the effective contact area, which creates an electric potential difference between electrodes. Consequently, a current flows from the top to the bottom electrode [Fig. 5(a)-II] and continues until the two triboelectric materials are separated [Fig. 5(a)-III].56 Afterwards, dielectric 1 moves inwards relative to dielectric 2, which results in a current flow in the external circuit with the opposite sign of that of the sliding out process [Fig. 5(a)-IV]. When the two dielectrics return to the initial state, the charged triboelectric surfaces get in full contact, thereby again initiating the cycle [Fig. 5(a)-I].56 For the conductor/dielectric TENG, the basic structural design is illustrated in Fig. 5(b) and, in this case, electrode 1 is the triboelectric material and also one of the electrodes itself.78
 Fig. 5  Basic lateral sliding working mode of TENG (adapted from ref. 56 and 78): (a) dielectric/dielectric; (b) conductor/dielectric. 
The sliding mode was already demonstrated to generate energy from harvesting wind, hydropower and gas flows. It can be achieved using planar motions, disc or cylindrical rotations However, sliding-based TENGs can have a large frictional force between tribo-surfaces during the working process, which can limit the device durability and energy conversion efficiency.85 Nevertheless, this mode has several advantages, as the relative lateral-sliding between triboelectric materials is more effective to generate tribo-charges than pure contact, and consequently there is an enhanced output power.84


2.2.3. Single-electrode mode (SETENG). 
The TENG based on single-electrode can work using the vertical contact-separation and sliding modes.56,86 Its working principle is schematically shown in Fig. 6, from which it is perceivable that one electrode (primary electrode; with thickness dm, width w and length l) can work as the triboelectric material or be attached on the surface of a triboelectric material (with thicknesses d0), while the other electrode is an electric potential reference (reference electrode) located at a gap g underneath the primary electrode.78
 Fig. 6  Basic single-electrode working mode of TENG (adapted from ref. 78): (a) conductor/dielectric contact mode; (b) conductor/dielectric sliding mode. 
Considering the contact-mode type as reference [Fig. 6(a)], when an external force is applied, dielectric 1 moves along the vertical direction and the distance x with the primary electrode varies, while the position of the two electrodes (primary and reference) is maintained (fixed). When the triboelectric 1 and the primary electrode are in contact, negative (−σ) and positive (+σ) tribo-charges are respectively induced on their surfaces. The total transferred charges from the primary electrode to the reference electrode is Q and, under the minimum achievable charge reference state, the total amount of charges at the primary electrode is σwl–Q and at the reference electrode is Q.78
The sliding mode [Fig. 6(b)] is a hybridization between the lateral sliding mode described in the previous section and in the single-electrode contact-mode. A TENG based on single-electrode was reviewed as the most practical and feasible design because, for the previously discussed modes, both triboelectric layers need to be connected to an external circuit, which limits TENGs' versatility and applicability.84 In contrast, this energy harvesting strategy allows one of the triboelectric material to move freely without connection to an external circuit.78,84 However, the maximum transferred charge efficiency can be only 50% due the electrostatic shielding of the primary electrode that limits the SETENGs performance.


2.2.4. Freestanding triboelectric-layer mode (FTENG). 
A new triboelectric mode, called freestanding-triboelectric-layer based TENGs (Fig. 7) was recently created.55,78,80,84,87 This mode, with two typical configurations (contact and sliding), is constituted by the triboelectric material alternatively approaching two fixed electrodes. Freestanding TENGs show improved energy conversion efficiency, minimized surface wear and long-term stability.84
 Fig. 7  Contact-mode freestanding working mode of TENGs (adapted from ref. 78 and 83): (a) dielectric and (b) metal freestanding layer contact TENG. 
There are two typical subcategories for contact-mode freestanding TENGs with their working principles being very similar: dielectric and metal freestanding layer [Fig. 7(a and c), respectively].78 The first configuration has a dielectric layer with thickness d1 (relative dielectric constant εr1), two metal layers forming two triboelectric pairs (also serving as electrodes), and an air gap between these metallic layers (with spacing g). Applying an external force to the dielectric material, it is forced to come into alternating contact with the two metal layers, which induces tribo-charges on the top and bottom surfaces of the dielectric due to triboelectrification. The tribo-charge density of the top and bottom triboelectric surfaces is −σ and, due to charge conservation, electrodes 1 and 2 have the same amount of positive charges. Considering both electrodes much larger than the air gap, all the electric potential on electrodes 1 and 2, the top and bottom surfaces of dielectric 1 are constant. The change of the position of triboelectric material 1 then induces an electron flow between electrode 1 and 2 through an external circuit. Fig. 7(b) shows the metal freestanding layer TENG and corresponding working principle which is similar to the dielectric configuration previously analyzed. This new configuration allows to increase the TENGs’ versatility and applicability to generate electric power from any external mechanical motion.
The same two subcategories (dielectric and metal freestanding layers) apply for the sliding-mode,78,80 as shown in Fig. 7(a and b), respectively. In the dielectric case, the freestanding material only contains a dielectric, while in the metal case the dielectric freestanding material has a thin metal film deposited on top. These two structures are thus very similar, with the freestanding triboelectric material strongly influencing the electrical outputs of these nanogenerators. The sliding freestanding TENG has two electrodes placed as illustrated in Fig. 8 and a freestanding triboelectric material on top at a distance h, called the freestanding height.78 Otherwise, the main working principle of the contact and sliding freestanding TENGs are very similar.
 Fig. 8  Sliding-mode freestanding working mode of TENGs (adapted from ref. 56 and 78): (a) dielectric and (b) metal freestanding layer sliding TENG. 
The freestanding mode, compared to the lateral sliding-mode, can harvest energy without direct physical contact between the two tribo-surfaces and will decrease material wear and heat generation during the frictional process. This mode is characterized by its ultra-robustness and high-energy conversion efficiencies.84


2.2.5. Applications of TENGs. 
Based on the four basic modes previously reviewed, several TENGs have been developed to harvest different types of energy, depending on specific applications (Fig. 9).88 These nanogenerators can work, for example, as self-powered sensors48,49,54,56,89–91 or as power sources to feed low-power electronic devices.92–95 However, TENGs cannot feed directly commercial electronics because they are alternating current (AC) power sources. To feed commercial electronic devices, this current must be converted into a DC current using power management circuits to allow energy storage in a battery or a capacitor during electrical generation.96Table 2 compares the typical features of triboelectric nanogenerators and solar cells (multicrystalline and thin-film solar cells).

3. Offshore activities and ocean equipment
Buoys and other floating platforms are presently installed in the ocean and in other water bodies, integrating a wide variety of equipment and sensors, allowing for a continuous monitoring over great areas both nearshore and in deep waters. All this equipment provides important information for mariners, fishermen, weather forecasters, ocean and costal engineers, harbour authorities, marine scientists and the public-at-large planning, coordinating and conducting a variety of maritime activities.104 However, in remote locations, the amount of energy required for their operation is difficult and expensive to obtain. The use of TENG technologies could be the optimum solution for that purpose. This section describes the characteristics of present marine systems and the potentialities that could result from the use of TENGs, focusing on the four most important types of oceanic surface buoys: navigational, ocean data, drifter and aquaculture buoys.
3.1. Oceanic surface buoys
In the past, buoys were mostly used for navigational purposes. In 1976, the fabrication and installation of buoys started to be regulated, with the creation of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA).105 Others, with the advance in electronics and computer science, focused on applications that range from weather forecast106,107 to hurricane and cyclone prediction,108 or even environmental observations,109 alongside oceanographic studies assisted by drifting buoys.110 However, recent technological developments allowed for the opening of new prospects, being an example of such the use of buoys for aquaculture activities.111,112

3.1.1. Navigational buoys. 
The IALA buoyage system is divided into two main regions: Region A, which includes Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Africa and some countries of Asia; and Region B, which includes the Americas, Japan, the Korean Peninsula and the Philippines.113 Six types of marks currently exist: Hand Marks (the only ones that change from Region A to B), Cardinal Marks, Isolated Danger Marks, Safe Water Marks, Special Marks and New Hazard Marks.
Due to their constant operation worldwide, navigation is one of the most commonly found applications of buoy technology. There are several manufacturers worldwide with a significant market impact (many reaching into the range of the millions of USD net revenue),114 having the necessary financial capacity to introduce new technologies, such as TENGs, onto existing and new buoys. Moreover, the application of batteries and solar systems could be replaced with a TENG generating system, allowing for a weight reduction and greater power output.


3.1.2. Ocean data buoys. 
As part of the Data Buoy Cooperation Panel, responsible for maintaining an overlook and interconnection amongst ocean data buoys,115 little under 2000 buoys worldwide (Fig. 10) provide key information on weather forecasting and environmental observations, among others. In many ways, the techniques for building and deploying ocean data buoys are now at a more mature level, supported by micro-electromechanical sensor (MEMS) technology, flash memory units, hybrid battery-solar power systems, GPS and constellations of communications satellites in low earth orbit, such as Iridium® (Iridium Satellite LLC), Globalstar® (Globalstar, Inc.) and Argos™ (Collect Localisation Satellites C.L.S.), which have greatly advanced the state-of-the-art.116,117

Generally, ocean data buoys can be split into two categories: (1) real-time and (2) near-real time and archived data. In real-time data buoys, assistance to weather, seasonal, hurricane or cyclone forecasts and safety at sea to fisheries and environmental observations, is ascertained.104 In near-real time and archived data, climate predictions and meteorological and oceanographic research are performed. Every day, several measurements are attained with different variables taken into account, including: (1) atmospheric pressure (and tendency); (2) wind speed and direction; (3) air temperature; (4) sea-surface and sub-surface temperature; (5) sea-surface and sub-surface salinity; (6) rainfall; (7) wave period and height (and wave spectra); (8) relative humidity; (9) down-welling radiation; (10) currents from buoys; (11) other biogeochemistry elements (CO2, O2, fluorescence, etc.). Ocean data buoys are mainly custom made by research institutes, hydrographic and meteorological institutes for specific services. Nonetheless, the few commercially available buoys resemble navigational buoys and, in some cases, combined applications exist. This leads to similarity in terms of materials, power and moorings. Naturally, due to the high number of equipment installed on these buoys, the cost is also higher, when compared to navigational buoys.


3.1.3. Drifter buoys. 
Drifter buoys, the most common ocean data buoy, have been fundamental for the correct understanding of surface circulation and temporal variability of the oceans.9 A key moment in the development of drifters involved the deployment of large numbers of surface drifters and subsurface neutrally buoyant floats in the 1970s, which allowed for the construction of the first global surface and subsurface velocity maps of ocean currents, for limited depths. Following on this success, the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) prompted, in the early 1980s, the development of standardized, lightweight, cost-effective and easily deployable drifters aimed at improving the research on climate and oceanography, as well as mitigating the uncertainties attributed to the various drifter designs. This resulted in the Surface Velocity Program (SVP)118 (Fig. 11),119 allowing for the creation of other initiatives such as NOAA's Global Drifter Program (GDP)120 and the Argo floats global array.116 In turn, these programs allowed research fields, such as ocean currents, wind fields, temperature gradients121–125 and even bathymetric, current and wave surveys from rivers18,19 to be evolved even further.
 Fig. 11  Display of the GDP array data (adapted from ref. 119). 
Consisting of a surface buoy and a subsurface drogue (“holey-sock” centred at 15 m depth), or sea anchor, attached to it by a tether, drifters measure ocean trajectories by detailing water particle trajectory, velocity and mixing by eddy effects.8 In terms of technological design, modern drifters are outfitted with either a radio or satellite beacon, as well as GPS receivers, to accurately track their location and transmit information, while also measuring wind speed, salinity, ocean colour, barometric pressure and other gradients worthy of interest, such as temperature. The need to power these incorporated systems provides a large margin for TENG technology to be implemented, as opposed to solar and battery.
The original SVP design (Fig. 12), aimed at minimizing slip, the horizontal motion of a drifter that differs from the lateral motion of currents averaged over the drogue depth. Alternative drifter variants exist, such as CODE/DAVIS drifter,126 which is used to acquire coastal and estuarial water currents within a metre of the water surface, or the River drifter,119 capable of operating in the surf-zone or in areas of calm and shallow water.

3.1.4. Aquaculture buoys. 
The aquaculture industry has shown significant growth in the past decades due to the growth of marine products consumption127 and may be divided into fish and shellfish production. In fish farming, cages placed in lakes, ponds, rivers or oceans (offshore cultivation) contain and also protect the fish. For shellfish production, there are two main approaches: bottom (15%), commonly applied to mussels and oysters production, and suspended (85%) cultures, for mussel cultivation.128–130 In general, buoys used both in fish farming and shellfish production work as perimeter markings (polyethylene, PVC or polyurethane foam are the most common materials) with no lighting equipment, although some can accommodate LED lights to provide visualization and delimitation.
Despite the limited quantity of required electronics and sensors for aquaculture buoys, the size of the market may justify the incorporation of TENG technology onto these buoys. In fact, worldwide fish consumption has been increasing twice the population growth since 1961, having seen its peak in 2016 (171 million tonnes, from which aquaculture represents about 47%).127 Since buoys are ubiquitous in the aquaculture industry, the possibility of using them also as wave energy harvesters should not be overlooked. In addition, these buoys do not have to fulfil strict requirements, making them usually cheaper to manufacture. Aquaculture buoys generally come in round and cylindrical shapes, although beacon-like buoys have also been implemented for feeding purposes (Fig. 13), equipped with solar panels as well as wind generators, allowing for remote inspection and feeding, since on-site access is difficult.131

3.2. Characterization of shapes, materials, mooring systems and energetic needs and conventional power supply systems
Oceanic surface buoys typically consist of six components: (1) a central structure of cylindrical shape of aluminium or galvanized steel, with a diameter in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 m and a height from 0.9 to 4 m; (2) floats of cylindrical shape of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or a foam-like polyurethane (PUR), with a diameter in the range of 0.4 to 4 m; (3) ballast weights, with no specific geometry; (4) a tower of cylindrical, pyramidal or conical shape of PET or PUR, with a diameter in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 m and a height from 1 to 5 m; (5) lights with no specific geometry; and (6) top-marks of a conical, cylindrical shape with size varying from a few up to 80 cm, in case of need (Fig. 14).132
 Fig. 14  Atlantic 300 model from Sealite (adapted from ref. 132). 
Two types of power systems are prevalently used in ocean surfaces buoys: batteries or solar-powered with batteries. The battery capacity is directly proportional to the intensity provided to lamps or LED lighting, which must reach a value between 1 to 21 nautical miles. The most common potential is of 12 V, varying in capacity from 5 A h to about 110 A h. The most common type of batteries used are the sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries, one of the most common product types.133 For small lamps, of 1 to 2 nautical miles, nickel metal hydride batteries (NiMH) are preferred, due to their greater energy density (close to that of lithium-ion batteries).134 An alternative approach involves the use of solar panels onto the buoys. For navigational buoys, the most common application is multi-crystalline solar modules. Their difference when compared to mono-crystalline panels is mainly in their lower price and efficiency, but, given the relatively low energy requirements, their use is typically sufficient. The output of multi-crystalline modules can go from 0.45 W, for lights of 1 to 2 nautical miles, to 80 W, for 12 nautical mile lights.135
The selection of the mooring system involves two components: (1) a steel chain, wire or a synthetic fibre rope and (2) a sinker or block (Fig. 15). In traditional systems, the steel chain connects the block to the buoy through a set of interconnected shackles of galvanized steel, with maintenance, excessive weight and fatigue being the main issues.136 Wire mooring lines are known to provide higher elasticity than traditional steel chain systems, with a clear reduction in the catenary effect, which in turn creates fatigue, and in cost.137 The issues regarding weight, maintenance and fatigue drove the development of synthetic fibre ropes, allowing for weight savings of up to a factor of 10 (in the case of synthetic fibre), while maintaining a retention of elasticity at any water depth, since the synthetic fibre ropes allow the buoy movement to slow down gradually, thus reducing the maximum mooring forces.136 The block, on the other hand, is located at the sea floor, working as a weight, so that the buoy does not drift away. It is usually made of concrete or cast iron.

4. Maritime applications of TENG technology
4.1. Introduction
In spite of the massive wave energy potential worldwide, efficient, low-cost and environmentally friendly technologies to harvest this blue resource are still limited, particularly in terms of solutions able to support the long-term operation of maritime sensors in remote oceanic or coastal locations. Developing such cost-effective technologies would allow those systems to be deployed for months, or even years, without human intervention, with large benefits in terms of environmental monitoring, marine renewable energy production and basic scientific knowledge.
As shown above, buoys are traditionally equipped with sensors and electronic systems, which have their own battery packs that can be charged by solar panels. However, the power generated by the typically low efficiency solar panels is rather expensive and, most importantly, depends significantly on the light conditions. On the other hand, particularly in high latitudes, batteries must be replaced via expensive service cruises. Therefore, novel energy generation solutions that are scalable, of low cost and do not depend on the day/night cycle are required to enhance the operation and applicability of marine systems to obtain truly self-powered systems.
As with any other technology, the application of TENGs to provide energy to marine activities involves both advantages and drawbacks. For instance, Wang et al. denotes the low amount of wave energy currently being exploited due to restrictions associated with solutions based on electromagnetic generators (EMGs).52 This is justified by the negative influence of the irregular nature of ocean waves and low frequency operation of the technologies (below 5 Hz),50 an issue that is tackled by TENGs since they are capable of converting the irregular oscillatory wave energy into electricity, even considering slow motions of water wave particles.138 Also, TENGs can, in theory, be applied in numerous marine applications, making them a versatile technology and particularly suitable for powering electronic components.92,139 TENGs equally demonstrate a high energy conversion and storage efficiency,140 between 50% and over 90%, respectively, and a high area power density55 with a maximum of about 1200 W m−2 already achieved. The technology itself is also lightweight and has inherent low fabrication costs, giving it an important potential edge over alternative systems for wave energy conversion, as cost reduction is a vital challenge that needs to be addressed by the wave energy sector.141 The underlying concepts and possibilities are well-known, at this stage, both from a theoretical88,142 and practical48 perspective. In fact, TENGs are also being considered for harvesting wind energy,143 a far more mature sector than that of wave energy, thus reinforcing the importance of considering them for marine applications as well.144 Being a recent technology, TENGs are still maturing and hence require a considerable R&D effort before they can be fully deployed. This involves a thorough analysis of various optimization strategies and material selection, as described along this paper that will require considerable investment in terms of both capital, knowledge and equipment. Furthermore, TENGs will have to be protected adequately from the harsh sea environment, as both physical loads and biochemical agents may jeopardize their operational efficiency and, at worst, integrity.
4.2. Ocean wave energy harvesting using TENG
Ocean waves originate from the action of wind over a water mass and are therefore an indirect and concentrated form of solar energy. In deep waters, it can be considered that energy in a wave can be equally divided in two parts: the kinetic component, due to the motion of water particles in their circular orbits, and the potential component associated to the mechanical work performed when the flat ocean surface is deformed to a wavy (water lifted against the gravity force from wave troughs to wave crests). The averaged stored energy per unit area of ocean surface is given by: (1)where ρ represents the mass density of sea water, g the acceleration of gravity, Hm0 the spectral significant wave height for the actual sea state and S(f) the wave energy spectrum that defines quantitatively how the different wave frequencies f contribute to the wave energy.
A typical sea state characterized by a Hm0 = 2.0 m presents an energy density of approximately 2.5 kW m−2. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can be used to convert the two components of wave energy and thus generate electricity. As described in Section 2, TENGs work based on two fundamental effects: contact induced electrification and electrostatic induction. This principle allows for the conversion of energy from various frequencies, including low frequency agitation or vibration.
Since the ocean is a harsh environment, it is primarily envisaged to install the TENG units sheltered inside a hull. Fig. 16(a) shows, in a simplified form, the dynamics of a floating body (ocean buoy) in deep water, under the action of waves. As the wave passes by, the floating body has translatory (surge, sway, heave) and rotatory (roll, pitch, yaw) motions [Fig. 16(b)] that can excite the TENG, installed within, in different ways. In fact, the four main operation modes of TENGs allow a wide variety of applications in the ocean environment. Furthermore, the prototypes developed so far can rely only on the triboelectric effect or be combined with EMGs, thus building a hybrid and possibly more efficient generator.145,146 All these alternative options are described in Section 4.3. Table 3 summarizes some of the main results obtained in the harvesting of wave energy using triboelectric nanogenerators. Different triboelectric configurations have been presented in the literature, with the most common involving the use of rolling spheres and of the direct contact with water to generate electrical energy.

4.3. TENG technologies for marine applications

4.3.1. TENGs based on rolling spheres. 
Given the versatility of TENGs in harvesting all kinds of mechanical motion, numerous different prototypes have been assembled and reported. One straightforward method to take advantage of the motion of a floating body in the ocean is to use rolling spheres freely moving on top of a triboelectric surface. One of the initial prototypes based in this concept and published in 2015 also proposed the implementation of a TENG network (TENG-NW) with a large number of units connected to harvest large-scale water wave energy from the sea.138 The single TENG-NW unit consisted of four lateral triboelectric pair stacks within an acrylic box triggered by ball collisions driven by gravity [Fig. 17(a–d)]. Under an acceleration of 10 m s−2 and a displacement of 9 cm, the ball collision generated an VOC and short-circuit current (ISC) of 569.9 V and 0.93 mA, respectively, and a maximum power density of 0.26 mW cm−2. Furthermore, four units of the TENG-NW were produced, connected in parallel and tested in a home-made pool, being able to reach an average short-circuit current of 302 μA. Zhong Lin Wang and co-authors also developed a spherical TENG with 6 spring-assisted TENGs to collect multidirectional water energy [Fig. 17(e–h)].51 Each TENG unit is supported by 4 springs and uses a Kapton film in a zigzag structure as substrate, where copper electrodes and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) films are assembled. To ensure contact-separation between the triboelectric materials, six copper ball roll due to the water motions and collide with the 6 spring-assisted zigzag TENGs. A maximum output voltage, current and transferred charge of 280 V, 120 μA and 1.0 μC were generated at 1 Hz and a fixed orientation angle of 90° (angle between the water wave triggering direction and the middle plane of the spherical TENG). They showed an increase of the electrical outputs with increasing wave frequency because of the increased velocity of the spheres. However, the electrical outputs decrease for frequencies above 1 Hz due to the unstable oscillation of the balls. They also showed that the electrical outputs decreased with increasing angle from 0 to 45° and then increased up to 90°.

Fig. 18(a and b) displays the so-called sea snake-like triboelectric nanogenerator (SS-TENG).147 This prototype has an external and an internal acrylic box with a spring attached in the bottom, with 6 rectangular columns of 5.1 × 6.4 × 2.54 cm3 and 6 PTFE balls for each column acting as a dielectric layer. The spheres moved back and forth on a nylon film with an interdigital copper (Cu) electrode that in turn is on top of a soft spring. With 3 units of the SS-TENG connected in series by springs, this prototype achieved a maximum output voltage of 160 V, charging 2 V of a 100 μF capacitor in 10 min and lightning 152 LEDs connected in series. Another prototype making use of the same basic concept is shown in Fig. 18(e–g).148 This tower based triboelectric nanogenerator (T-TENG) is composed by an acrylic tubular block with a shell diameter of 94 mm, stacking 4 layers, each one combined with a nylon film, a metal electrode and 5 PTFE spheres. Under the excitation of the external waves, generated in a water tank by a linear motor at 1.6 Hz with an amplitude of 150 mm, the PTFE spheres roll back and forth on the arc surface giving a VOC of 105 V, a ISC of 1.3 μA and a charge of 51 nC. When 10 units of the T-TENGs are used, the maximum generated power density is 10.6 W m−3, being able to light 540 LEDs.

Cheng et al. also used a spherical buoy, having a soft core inside made of a liquid-filled silicon rubber [single area contact; Fig. 19(a–c)].149 When rolling inside the buoy, this soft silicon core largely increased the contact area with the Cu electrodes, increasing the amount of generated triboelectric charges. Compared to the (single point contact) PTFE-based TENGs, it shows improved outputs by 2 or 10 times at frequencies below 2 or 5 Hz. Testing was performed in a small water tank with waves being generated by a linear motor, reaching a VOC of 90 V, a ISC of 0.8 μA, and charging up to 3 V of a 2.2 μF capacitor in 40 s at a frequency of 2 Hz. It was able to power 56 LEDs in series. Fig. 19(d and e) shows a low-cost environment-friendly torus structured based on TENG (TS-TENG) consisting of an acrylic torus shell covered with 6 layers of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) films and Cu, each layer covering 21 cm2, and a nylon inner ball with 3.5 cm of diameter that moves in an in-plane/lateral sliding mode.150 Sixteen units of this TS-TENG were arranged into arrays of different sizes (connected in parallel) and were tested in a water tank with an oscillation angle of 5° at 1 Hz. Then, this TENG network generated a maximum current of 2.6 μA, a voltage of ∼160 V and reached a power of ∼20 μW.

4.3.2. Multilayered-stacked TENGs. 
To improve the volume density of the triboelectric contact and to generate higher power densities, multilayered devices have been developed to incorporate several TENG units in small spaces for wave energy harvesting. Taking advantage of the pitch motion of a buoy, a central weight swinging in a range of 180° was fabricated, pushing the layers of the triboelectric materials against each other in the contact-separation mode [Fig. 20(a–d)].151 In the first tests, the movement was driven by a linear motor, followed by tests in a water tank with wave agitation. A device composed by 50 stacked TENG units generated a transferred charge and a rectified ISC of 26 μC and 0.45 mA, respectively, at 1.15 Hz with an angle amplitude of 13.6°. The rectified VOC was 625 V with a high peak (average) power density of 7.45 W m−3 (0.335 W m−3) being obtained in water at 0.8 Hz. Also taking advantage of the contact-separation working mode, a wave energy converter was designed as a hollow sphere with a spring-assisted zig-zag-shaped multilayered TENG structure [Fig. 20(e–i)].152 A Kapton film shaped in a zig-zag structure was used as a substrate for TENG units, which allows the contact-separation mechanism e with the help of springs. Each TENG unit is composed by a FEP film as triboelectric material and an aluminum film as the other triboelectric material and electrode. Different types of waves were tested (transverse sinusoidal/impulse and longitudinal impulse waves) with the best results obtained for the longitudinal impulse waves case. At 1 Hz and with 7 spheres arranged in a hexagonal position linked by rigid strings, the obtained maximum voltage and current were 354 V and 270 μA, reaching a power of 12.2 mW (power density of 3.33 W m−3) for a resistance of 1.2 MΩ.

Fig. 21(a–d) shows a TENG designed in a tower with 6 layers assembled in a cylindrical shell with 15 × 7 cm2. Each layer has a mass with sponges working as a buffer and two springs fixed in the middle. FEP films were also fixed on both sides of each unit and 2 copper films were deposited on the top and the bottom as electrodes.154

It was tested in a water tank, attached to a floating body, with waves at 2 Hz, generating voltage of approximately 250 V in open-circuit and transferred charges of 3 μC in short-circuit. By plotting the U–Q curve after measurements, the theoretical maximum indicated 70.3% of energy transfer from the TENG with an average power density of 13.2 mW m−2.
L. Xu et al. produced a prototype that uses 4 springs in the upper corners of an acrylic box to hold a stack of 38 TENG units, using air pressure to move the units against each other in a vertical contact-separation mode, transferring and distributing harvested water wave energy [Fig. 22(a–d)].157 To simulate water waves motion at 2.9 Hz with an amplitude of 8 mm (near the resonant frequency), a vibration motor was used to perform a vertical movement, pushing the bottom of the shell of the multilayered TENG. Then, the rectified device generated a peak ISC of 187 μA, an accumulative charge of 15 μC per cycle, and an output power of 10 mW at a resistance of 8 MΩ. The device was also tested in a water tank generating enough energy to power 600 LEDs simultaneously with the stimulation of waves. In Fig. 22(e–g), a spherical whirling-folded TENG (WF-TENG) composed by an energy power generation component into a spherical shell was developed to harvest wave energy based on contact-separation mechanism.153 The energy power generation component is supported by a square acrylic frame and is composed by five TENG units in each face (20 basic TENG units in total) connected in parallel. Each basic TENG unit has a 3D-printed vortex skeleton of polylactic acid (PLA) as substrate. In one side of PLA substrate is attached a Kapton substrate with deposited copper electrodes (PCB strip). In other side is attached a PCB strip with a FEP film as electrode and triboelectric material, respectively. Under an external triggering, a mass block fixed in the center of PLA substrate will move the triboelectric material to contact and separate. Connecting the 4 faces of WF-TENG in parallel were generated a maximum voltage and current of 450 V and 85 μA, respectively, in water tank with waves at 1.4 Hz. The maximum average power and the peak power achieved were 0.28 mW and 6.5 mW at the load resistance of 10 MΩ, respectively.

4.3.3. TENGs based on direct water contact. 
All the structures described in the previous sections depend on movable structures within an encapsulated floating body. This puts strict requirements on the packing of the whole structure, as any water leakage would result in device failure. To counter this issue, a new set of triboelectric devices operating in the single electrode mode was put forward based on the direct contact of water with a solid triboelectric material. Given the position of water on the triboelectric series (on the positive polarity side), negative triboelectric materials such as PTFE or FEP are typically chosen as the tribo-pair. Li et al. used a FEP nanowires based TENG with enhanced contact area with water and thus extra generated charges [Fig. 23(a–d)].155 Submerging the FEP film in water leads to sharp positive peaks, while its removal leads to a smaller negative signal. The nanowire-based structure has a high output performance, generating an output current of 10 μA and a voltage of 200 V, with a maximum instantaneous power of 16 μW. In the demonstration, the prototype powered a system with a suitable capacitor and an infrared emitter. Fig. 23(e–g) shows a spherically-shaped TENG that generates electrical energy when its inner or outer surface become in contact with water.156 This configuration was tested in a small tank with water being driven below 0.15 Hz, with the outer and inner layers generating voltages of 3.1 and 7.5 V, currents of 0.07 and 0.12 μA and charges of 0.8 nC and 6 nC, respectively. The demonstration was performed with a capacitor of 4.7 μF being charged up to 2.2 V after 45 s.

4.3.4. Other TENG architectures. 
Other conventional TENGs architectures with waterproof layers have been also reported to harvest irregular and broadband water wave energy, isolating TENGs with waterproof layers. Based on a sphere shaped buoy, Lin et al. developed a prototype with a single-pendulum TENG (P-TENG) with the length of 62 mm operating in the freestanding mode [Fig. 24(a–d)].159 The copper pendulum swings over PTFE stripes due to the external excitation employed, first by a linear motor, and later with wave movements in a water tank, achieving a maximum ISC of 3.5 μA and a maximum voltage of 56 V for 6 units installed in parallel, taking 780 s to charge a 100 μF capacitor up to 3.1 V. In Fig. 24(e–g) a different prototype was designed to be attached to a floating buoy that would take advantage of wave movements.158 This prototype is composed by arrays of cylinder based TENGs where PTFE bars move inside a PS tube with four copper electrodes outside of the tube. Varying amplitude and frequency of water in a water tank, the device generated a maximum VOC, ISC and power of 30 V, 1.2 μA and 7 μW, respectively, at a frequency of 1.7 Hz and an amplitude of 15 cm.

Fig. 25 shows an oblate spheroidal triboelectric composed by an upper and lower TENG working in the contact-separation mode.160 The upper TENG harvests energy in rough seas and has three basic units composed by jointed spring steel plates, one with a coated FEP film. The lower TENG harvests small wave energy from halcyon seas. This unit consists of a radial FEP/Cu film fixed within the oblate spheroidal shell and a radial PET/Cu suspended above FEP, which come into contact due to the movement of a ball. The authors show that the VOC and ISC generated by the upper TENG increase with both amplitude and frequency, reaching a maximum of 281 V and 76 μA, respectively, at an amplitude of 12.5 mm and a frequency of 4 Hz. The voltage and charge generated by the lower TENG under different accelerations was also studied, showing a monotonously increase with increasing acceleration. The energy generated by the oblate spheroidal triboelectric was also used to charge different commercial capacitors, showing that a 2.2 μF capacitor charged 5 V in 35 s while a 10 μF capacitor needed 150 s.

4.3.5. Hybrid TENGs as a path to increase energy production. 
Hybridizing TENGs with electromagnetic concepts has become a recent trend to obtain higher output powers in wave energy harvesting. They are able to combine the large voltages and low-frequency efficiency of TENGs with the high currents generated by electromagnetic generators (EMGs). Fig. 26(a–c) shows a concept based on two main elements (a stator and a slider) operating for both EMG and TENG.162 Due to the oscillations of the buoy caused by the water waves, the slider moves up and down generating electricity. To demonstrate this experiment, numerical simulations were performed for 12 slider stacks, leading to a maximum ISC of 59 μA at 3 Hz. The power density is enhanced by the frequency and reaches a maximum of 271.1 W m−3. A hybrid rotational pendulum consisting of an acrylic cylindrical frame with an EMG module (pendulum rotor and coils), and TENG blades operating in contact-separation mode was also reported [Fig. 26(d–g)].163 The rotation of the pendulum rotor will allow the contact and separation of the Cu ring around the rotor magnets with the triboelectric blades to generate electric power. The device was tested in three ways: first, with the help of a linear motor, achieving a power density of 79.9 W m−2 at 2 Hz; second, attached to a person to scavenge energy from human motion; and third, on top of a buoy in a home-made water tank to harvest energy from waves. In the latter, for a wave frequency of approximately 1 Hz and a wave height of 20 cm, the hybrid pendulum generated an VOC of over 3 V (EMG) and 80 V (TENG).

Fig. 27 presents two floating bodies with different hybrid designs. Wang et al. developed a ship-shaped hybrid nanogenerator (SHNG) consisting of an acrylic device with one EMG module and two TENGs, one operating in the freestanding (FR) mode using rolling spheres and other operating in the contact-separation (CS) mode [Fig. 27(a–d)].165 At 2 Hz and with three rollers, the FR-TENG (CS-TENG) delivers a VOC of approximately 290 V (150 V), a ISC of 2.8 μA (15 μA) and a maximum power of 165 μW (850 μW). On the other hand, under the same excitation, the EMG produced a VOC, a ISC and a maximum power of 4.3 V, 15 mA and 9 mW, respectively. In the demonstration test in a small water tank, the hybrid generated was able to power 55 LEDs. The second design proposed a combination of TENG and EMG in a duck-shaped buoy with rolling spheres to harvest wave energy [Fig. 27(e–h)].166 Numerical simulations determined an optimal frequency of 2.5 Hz for the assembled prototype. For the TENG (EMG), the maximum VOC, ISC and power densities obtained were 390 V (180 mV), 7.2 μA (0.12 A), 213 W m−3 (144 W m−3) at a load resistance of 280 MΩ (1.5 Ω).

To capture the kinetic and potential energy of water waves, Feng et al. developed a hybridized device, with the TENG operating in two working modes: vertical contact-separation and lateral sliding [Fig. 28(a–d)].161 The TENG unit consists of an acrylic board with seven hexagonal electrodes covered (connected in three electrodes group) with PTFE film as triboelectric material, and a mobile magnet. In magnet was fixed a hexagonal acrylic plate covered with an aluminum film as triboelectric material and electrode. EMG unit is composed by seven Cu coils fixed on the backside of an acrylic substrate. Under waves oscillations, the hybridized device will move in a multiangle range due to the free movement of magnet. Increasing the sliding displacement from 0.5 to 3.5 cm at 4 Hz, the TENG unit generated an open-circuit voltage and charge that increased linearly, reaching a maximum of 550 V and 140 nC, respectively. A similar linear increase with sliding displacement was observed for ISC (up to 4.65 mA) and VOC (up to 3 V) of the EMG, for a maximum power of 8.23 μW. For frequencies varying from 1 to 5 Hz (and fixed displacements of 3.5 cm), the current generated by TENG showed a linear increase (up to 1.5 μA), while the transferred charge and open circuit voltage values remained constant (140 nC and 550 V). The authors further demonstrated that a capacitor charged up to 2 V in 23 s and that 180 green LEDs can be simultaneously lit. Finally, Fig. 28(e–h) shows a hybrid water wave energy harvester constituted by an acrylic hollow sphere with a TENG, an EMG and a power management circuit.164 The device was first tested manually in an experimental setup with a shaker, reaching 172.95 V at 30 rpm when swinging by 135°, being capable of lightning a white LED. Tests in a local lake, where the device was placed on top of a buoy to harvest wave energy, showed its capability to charge a capacitor to 1.84 V in 162 s.

Based on a chaotic pendulum, Chen et al. also developed a hybridized device, with the TENG operating based on the freestanding triboelectric-layer mode (Fig. 29).167 The TENG unit was composed by a PTFE film and gold electrodes and assembled onto the center of the pendulum, together with the EMG component. This device has three magnetic spheres fixed into a rotary system and three copper coils fixed on the inner acrylic. Under water waves, the PTFE film oscillates and slides over the interdigitated electrode, generating electrical energy. At same time, the magnetic spheres move triggering an electrical current in the coils. Varying the motion frequency from 0.5 to 2.5 Hz, the electrical outputs first rise and then saturates. The TENG (EMG) unit reached a maximum voltage and current of 97.03 V (1.08 V) and 3 μA (4 mA), respectively. The authors further demonstrated that the hybridized device charged a 10 μF capacitor up to 3 V in 10 s and lit up 100 LEDs under an excitation frequency of 2 Hz.

5. Conclusions and perspectives
Offshore activities and equipment deployed in the ocean require electrical power supplies, which are difficult and expensive to obtain, particularly in remote locations. Energy demand is expected to further increase in the future due to the growing trend of sea related activities. The wave resource is well distributed worldwide, abundant and persistent and presents a high energy density, being therefore a very promising option to provide the requested energy demand. However, most technologies available to harvest wave energy were developed for large-scale applications (e.g., wave farms) and are difficult to downscale to be integrated in autonomous equipment and platforms deployed offshore. In addition, even those concepts that are at an advanced development stage still lack economic viability, due to the high construction, operation and maintenance costs and the relatively low efficiencies,168 namely for low-frequency and small-amplitude irregular waves. Moreover, since ocean conditions are harsh and variable in time and space, technologies have to be designed to withstand the extreme environmental loadings, but also to operate efficiently and with low maintenance requirements under more frequent conditions.
TENGs, either as standalone systems or as part of hybrid technologies, are a promising alternative in comparison with traditional options, whose performance is usually limited by the irregular nature of ocean waves and the low frequency wave induced motions on equipment and systems deployed at sea (below 5 Hz). Indeed, TENGs are able to convert wave energy into electricity efficiently under such conditions, presenting a power output and performances supposed to be less dependent on the wave characteristics, hence more suitable to satisfy novel and more demanding applications. Past and current research has shown that TENGs can, in principle, be used in numerous marine applications, making them a very versatile technology, particularly suitable for powering autonomous and self-powered sensor buoys and other offshore small-scale floating platform and its electronic components.
In summary, in spite of being a relatively recent technology, TENGs demonstrated a considerable potential for marine applications, as shown by the wide range of studies conducted thus far using TENGs for blue energy harvesting, including heaving point absorbers. Although other applications present high potential, the present state of knowledge leads to conclude that, in the short term, the sector with higher potential for TENG integration is the one associated to the powering of small equipment for a wide range of applications, such as surface metocean monitoring, surveillance and security monitoring or the navigation buoys. In a more holistic perspective, TENG technology could provide energy for a broad range and integrated systems and sensors in operation in the ocean (Fig. 30).
 Fig. 30  Wave energy harvesting by TENGs: A holistic perspective. 
The most common buoy designs for those applications are based on the use of spherical geometric shapes or small cylindrical towers on top high-volume cylinders (Section 3). The interior of the buoy could have different components, such as balance weights, batteries, sensors and other instrumentation.
Besides all the gear needed for the operation of the buoy, there is also empty space that could be used for TENGs based on different operating methods. In this section are suggested further ways to use the triboelectrification effect to harvest energy in the interior of the floating marine buoy, without the need of direct contact with water. For these, the most suitable principles could be.
Inverted pendulum
As studied in ref. 169, the use of a pendulum has advantages for the conversion of the buoy pitch and roll movements into energy. A pendulum is characterized by its ultra-sensitivity and high oscillation of the mass, when a source of energy activates the system. Fig. 31(a) shows the basic working mechanism of the inverted pendulum. This system could be installed on the top vertical cylinder of the buoy with a hinge on the basis to extract most of the pitch and roll movements.
 Fig. 31  Possible implementations of triboelectric nanogenerators for blue energy: (a) inverted pendulum scheme; (b) heaving or sliding with springs; (c) unidirectional sphere system – (i) stationary case, (ii) under a rotation motion and (iii) planar array of 5 channels; (d) sliding spheres on a concave surface, promoting contact separation of triboelectric materials. 
Sliding or heaving with springs
This system would combine the sliding and contacting working principles of the TENG technology. The generator would be composed of springs connected to a cylindrical plate. The movement of the buoy will induce different behaviours on this plate. Mainly considering the heave movement of the buoy, the free plate hits another fixed plate [Fig. 31(b)-(i)]. As the movement of the buoy is not limited to one degree of freedom, it is necessary to consider and make use of the remaining dynamics of the floating body. The surge and pitch may be transferred to a relative sliding movement between the fixed and the free plate [Fig. 31(b)-(ii)]. Through high velocity impacts, the TENG will generate high spikes of voltage. Beyond the impacts, this nanogenerator also uses the top and bottom faces of the cylindrical plate to generate energy using the sliding friction principle. Springs are a good mechanical component to promote movement using the inertia of the oscillating mass, with the movement of the buoy. This device can generate energy with low frequency excitations, as is the case of many offshore wave energy conversion systems.
Track ball system
In order to take advantage of the buoy rolling and pitching oscillations, a one degree of freedom system aligning a row of metallic spheres to roll on a channel can be used. The spheres will act as a unique body that will impact on a triboelectric flap [Fig. 31(c)]. This structure could be stacked in multiple layers in order to maximize the production of energy.
Sliding spheres on concave surface
The rolling sphere in a confined channel may be applied to a wider area, with the concave surface TENG system making use of more movements of the buoy [Fig. 31(d)]. Not confined to only one channel, the nanogenerator becomes more versatile. This application considers two layers of triboelectric materials, nylon and PTFE films (for example) where the contact of the materials is provided by the weight of metallic sphere rolling on top of them. This makes this generator fall into the contact-separation mode.
In summary, the use of TENGs to power autonomous small-scale floating platforms deployed in remote offshore locations has high potential and is not directly affected by the main technical and economic risks faced by the traditional wave energy harvesting technologies. In fact, TENGs, which are the most critical component, are safely housed inside the hull of the floating platform and hence protected from the harsh marine environment. Hence, operation and maintenance costs are supposed to be low or even negligible. Since TENG systems are produced with easily accessible and low-cost materials, present high efficiencies and are reliable, the economic viability of such systems should be easily attained. The versatility of TENG technologies can unlock the path to the affordable exploration of the oceans and their resources.
