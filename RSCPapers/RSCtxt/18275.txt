    , Accepted 12th January 2018First published on 12th January 2018AbstractTiO2 has displayed potential for improved catalytic activity using a newly designed morphological system. Herein, a new catalytic system of SiO2/ITO/TiO2 nanocone array structures with unbalanced RF sputtering deposition was developed and demonstrated for photoelectrocatalytic activity. The array structures were fabricated using a soft nanolithography technique with a SiO2 sphere-patterned polydimethylsiloxane stamp. TiO2 films were coated on the ITO-coated SiO2 nanocones using unbalanced RF magnetron sputtering with various external magnetic fields applied by a solenoid. The nanostructures were examined using scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction crystallography, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocurrent response in water splitting was found to be increased by 400% for TiO2 films on nano-patterned arrays, compared with that on a flat surface. An additional increase in photocatalytic activity was achieved via TiO2 film deposition with an external magnetic field of 6 mT. This dramatic enhancement was attributed to the surface active sites created by the additional applied magnetic field and the increased surface area of the nanocone arrays.
1. Introduction
TiO2 has been a standard model material to understand the nature of photocatalytic activity through the design of new morphological systems.1–15 Many efforts have been invested in tailoring the morphology (e.g., as nanowires, nanorods, and nanocubes) for pure TiO2, hybridization with other materials, and constructing new morphological systems (e.g., core–shells and multi-shells). Such research has been increasing and more and more newly designed engineered TiO2-based photocatalysts have been reported, including 3D-printed TiO2 conical arrays.6,11,16–21 TiO2 nanotubes have been actively engineered for efficient photocatalyst applications such as hydrogen evolution and pollutant removal.6,10,22–26 Mi et al. constructed AZO/TiO2/Au nanocone arrays to increase the efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting.16 TiO2 nanocone array structures have been used as solar cell support materials for perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 and have shown an improved power conversion efficiency of ∼11% compared to that of a rectangular TiO2 nanorod-based device.17 Lei et al. prepared nanoconic SnO2–TiO2 hollow spheres and reported highly improved lithium storage capacity, rate performance, and cycle stability.18 Liang et al. prepared regular TiO2 nanotube arrays on various substrates and found the morphological geometry (such as tube height and diameter) to be controllable by varying experimental conditions.7 Among various wet-chemical and dry-physical sample preparation methods,8,27–35 the radiofrequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method has widely been used to fabricate TiO2 films.36–45 Zheng et al. showed that anatase TiO2 films with dominant {001} facets could be prepared using a DC magnetron sputtering method and that the crystalline film exhibited high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B.38 Highly ordered TiO2 NT arrays decorated with CdSe were prepared using RF magnetron sputtering and showed a 535-fold enhancement in photoelectrochemical current under visible light irradiation.39 Pandiyan et al. used the RF magnetron sputtering method to engineer the energy band of TiO2 films by doping and co-doping of nitrogen and tungsten for photoelectrocatalytic applications.41
In the present study, an unbalanced RF magnetron sputtering method was used to deposit a TiO2 thin film on a highly patterned ITO-coated SiO2 nanocone array. The resulting TiO2/ITO/SiO2 nanocone arrays showed much higher surface area and the additional external magnetic field generated by the unbalanced RF magnetron sputtering conditions could produce more surface active sites. The newly designed catalytic system and its application to water splitting have produced new insights into further improvement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
2. Experimental
A patterned surface was achieved through a soft lithography method using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), discussed in more detail below. An indium tin oxide (ITO) film with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited using a RF sputtering method at a working pressure of 3 mTorr and an RF power of 30 W for 40 min. The TiO2 film was post-annealed at 693 K for 180 min in an ambient condition. TiO2 films (95–100 nm thick) were deposited on the patterned surface using an RF sputtering method with additional solenoid coil currents of 0 A (0 mT), 0.1 A (3 mT), 0.2 A (6 mT), and 0.3 A (9 mT) at a working pressure of 2 mTorr and an RF power of 160 W for 120 min. The TiO2 film was post-annealed at 693 K for 2.5 h in an ambient condition. To uniformly coat the ITO and TiO2 films on the bead to the maximum extent, the substrate was deposited at various angles while rotating.
The crystallinity of the TiO2 films was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm). Images of the morphology of the nanostructures were taken using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The microstructures were examined using a JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The surface chemical oxidation states were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer and a monochromated Al Kα X-ray (E = 1486.6 eV) light source. The photoelectrochemical activity of the various materials (as a working electrode) was measured with a typical three-electrode setup, where the counter and reference electrodes were a Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl electrode, respectively, which were electrically connected using a CHI660D (CH Instruments) electrochemical work station. The electrolyte solution was a 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. A compact Mic-LED-365 (Prizmatix) was used to generate collimated light of 365 nm with ∼50 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
A soft lithography method was used to obtain monolayer nanoparticle arrays. All the details of the fabrication process for obtaining the patterned arrays are described elsewhere.45Fig. 1 shows selected SEM images of various patterned arrays, including a patterned PDMS stamp (Fig. 1(b)) obtained from a patterned Si substrate (Fig. 1(a)). After stamping by the patterned PDMS of a spin-coated NOA65 (Norland Co.) polymer on a substrate (Fig. 1(c)), a zigzag-patterned NOA65 substrate (Fig. 1(d)) was prepared using thermal annealing. The unpatterned NOA65 polymer was also used for efficient transfer of silica nanoparticles from the PDMS stamp to the substrate via UV light curing (Fig. 1(e)). The nanocone structures (Fig. 1(f)) were achieved by controlling the ion beam energy and time and the surface direction. The polymer could finally be removed with thermal annealing above 500 °C without impacting the nanoparticle array structure.

Fig. 2 shows the procedures for the preparation of TiO2 films on ITO-coated SiO2 nanocone arrays. Further details are described elsewhere.42–45 Heo and Gwag fabricated various non-spherical arrays (e.g., a mushroom-like-shape with different conical angles) from spherical nanoparticle arrays by varying the ion beam's exposure angle, beam current density, and time.42–45 Briefly, SiO2 nanocone arrays were first obtained through Ar+ ion beam sputtering of the patterned Si nanoparticle arrays followed by ITO film coating using an RF sputtering method. The ITO film was post-thermal annealed at 400 °C (673 K) for 1 h to obtain good crystallinity. The TiO2 film was then deposited using a (balanced or unbalanced) RF sputtering method on the crystalline ITO film and post-annealed at 420 °C (693 K) in air for 180 min. The balanced and unbalanced RF magnetron sputtering systems are depicted in the ESI,† Fig. S1. The resultant nanocone arrays were SiO2/ITO/TiO2 core–shell–skin structures.
 Fig. 2  Schematic procedures for the preparation of TiO2 films on ITO-coated SiO2 nanocone arrays. 
Various substrates were used to examine substrate effects on the TiO2 overlayer and their photoelectrocatalytic activity, as described below. TiO2 was sputter-deposited on flat glass, silicon, amorphous ITO, polycrystalline ITO, and crystalline ITO substrates. The XRD patterns of the substrates themselves are provided in the ESI,† Fig. S2. TiO2 was deposited on the various substrates and thermal-treated at 420 °C. The anatase TiO2 crystal phase was commonly observed upon thermal annealing for all the substrates except for the glass substrate. The XRD peaks for the anatase phase were observed at 2θ = 25.4°, 48.1°, and 55.2°, assigned to the corresponding (101), (200), and (211) planes, respectively.10,12,46 For the TiO2 upon deposition before thermal treatment, no sharp XRD patterns were observed, which indicates an amorphous state. However, an anatase TiO2 crystal phase was clearly observed after thermal annealing at 420 °C (ESI,† Fig. S3). For an Al substrate, the XRD peak of the (211) plane was found to be more dominant than other XRD peaks. Arias et al. deposited TiO2 thin films on Si and quartz substrates using DC reactive magnetron sputtering.40 They found that the anatase phase was only observed for the non-annealed films while mixed crystal phases of anatase and rutile were observed after thermal annealing at 700 °C, which is much higher than the temperature (420 °C) used here. The exposed crystal facets and the crystal phase mixture ratio were also reported to be dependent on the ratio of the Ar/O2 flow.
ITO was selected because the observed current density of TiO2 on ITO was observed to be higher than that of TiO2 on Al and Si substrates. ITO substrates with three different states (amorphous, polycrystalline, and crystalline) were selected, and TiO2 was deposited. The crystallinity of ITO was mainly dependent on the post-thermal treatment (ESI,† Fig. S4). Before thermal treatment of TiO2, no crystalline (or amorphous) phase was observed for TiO2 (ESI,† Fig. S5). Upon thermal treatment at 420 °C, the anatase TiO2 crystal phase was commonly observed for all the ITO substrates. No significant rutile phase was observed, due to a thermal annealing temperature lower than 600 °C.46
Because the TiO2 on crystalline ITO showed the highest photocatalytic current density (as will be discussed below), TiO2 was deposited by applying various external magnetic fields of 3, 6, and 9 mT generated by a solenoid to further improve photocatalytic activity. The prepared samples were post-thermal annealed at 420 °C. To examine only the effects of magnetic fields all the samples were prepared at the same post-growth thermal anneal process except for the external magnetic fields. Fig. 3 displays the XRD patterns from flat SiO2/ITO/TiO2 layers prepared with and without external magnetic fields. The XRD patterns common to all five samples are the typical peaks of ITO. The XRD peaks that newly appeared upon TiO2 deposition correspond to the crystal planes of anatase TiO2. No effect of the unbalanced RF sputtering deposition for crystalline structure can be observed. In addition, no critical linear relationship with the photocatalytic activity can be found using the bulk XRD technique. This indicates that the catalytic activity was mainly governed by the surface microstructures.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the flat SiO2/ITO/TiO2 structures prepared with and without external magnetic (3, 6, and 9 mT) fields. The XRD patterns of the SiO2/ITO structure are displayed for reference. 
HRTEM images were taken to examine the microstructures of the flat SiO2/ITO/TiO2 structures prepared at various additional external magnetic fields of 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding HRTEM images taken at three different layers (TiO2 top, TiO2 middle, and ITO/TiO2 interface) of the SiO2/ITO/TiO2. The images commonly show the crystallinities for ITO and TiO2. The lattice spacings of 0.19 nm and 0.35 nm correspond to the (200) and (101) planes of the anatase TiO2 crystal phase.10,28 Interestingly, the sample prepared at 6 mT appeared to contain more amorphous regions, which may act as active sites for photoelectrocatalytic reactions.

XPS spectra were obtained to examine the surface chemical states, which generally determine catalytic activity on a surface. Fig. 5 displays the Ti 2p3/2 and O 1s XPS spectra for the SiO2/ITO/TiO2 structures prepared at various additional external magnetic fields of 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT. The corresponding surveyed XPS spectra commonly show the elements of Ti, O, and impurities of carbon. A broad Ti 2p3/2 XPS peak was commonly observed at 458.7 eV, generally attributed to Ti4+ of TiO2.46–48 The Ti 2p3/2 XPS peak was observed to become narrower with increasing external magnetic fields. The Ti 2p peak was observed to be broadest for 0 mT and narrowest for 9 mT, with approximately equal widths for 3 mT and 6 mT. The XPS peak broadening has generally been explained by initial state electronic and/or final state charging effects.49 The O 1s XPS peaks exhibited more useful information about the surface chemical state. Two O 1s peaks were observed at 529.8 (major) and 531.7 eV (minor) and assigned to lattice TiO2 oxygen and Ti-vacancy related chemisorbed OH/O−/O2− species, respectively.43,46–48,50–52 The four O 1s peaks at the same baseline are provided in the ESI,† Fig. S6.
 Fig. 5  Normalized Ti 2p3/2 and O 1s XPS spectra for the SiO2/ITO/TiO2 structures prepared with various additional external magnetic fields of 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT. 
For the sample prepared with an additional external magnetic field of 6 mT, a dominant minor peak at 531.7 eV was seen, compared with the other samples. The relative intensity of the minor O 1s peak was observed to be lowest for 0 mT and 9 mT, followed by 3 mT, and highest for 6 mT. It appears that the minor peak was caused by surface active sites, which have been commonly reported in the literature.46 To further reveal surface information, Ti 2p and O 1s XPS peaks were obtained with increasing Ar+ ion sputtering time, as shown in the ESI,† Fig. S7. Ti3+ and Ti2+ oxidation species were clearly observed after the sputtering, which were attributed to Ar+ ion-induced reduction, as commonly reported in the literature.47,48 For O 1s XPS peaks upon sputtering, the minor peak at 531.7 eV was drastically diminished. This indicates that the surface OH/O−/O2− species were removed by the sputtering.
The photoelectrochemical activity was tested by measuring the photocurrent response to lights switched on and off for the prepared samples discussed above. For the TiO2 films at 0 mT (i.e., without additional magnetic fields) on various flat substrates after thermal annealing, the photocurrent densities were measured to be 0, 15, 29, 57, and 75 μA cm−2 for Al, Si, amorphous, polycrystalline, and crystalline ITO substrates, respectively, as shown in the red block of Fig. 6(a). The photocurrent density of the sample with crystalline ITO was larger than that of the other substrates. This indicates that a substrate is important for improving the photoelectrochemical activity of a TiO2 film. On the other hand, before thermal annealing of the TiO2 film, the photocurrent densities were much lower and were measured to be 2.5, 5, and 7 for flat amorphous, polycrystalline, and crystalline ITO substrates, respectively, as shown in the blue block of Fig. 6(a). This indicates that crystalline anatase TiO2 exhibited a greatly improved photocatalytic activity as expected. The photocatalytic current is dependent on many factors such as good interfacial contact and band energy level alignment (ESI† Fig. S8) between the TiO2 and the support substrates (Al, Si and ITO), the electrical mobility of the support substrate, and the surface state of TiO2. For the band energy level alignment,53 ITO is well matched the TiO2 for charge transfer, compared with Al and Si. Crystalline ITO has relatively lower resistivity and higher electrical mobility, compared with amorphous and polycrystalline ITO.42,44 The good electrical contact and the better energy level alignment of the crystalline ITO may increase the photocurrent with less charge accumulation at the interface.53
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent responses for TiO2 films (a) on various substrates before and after thermal annealing and (b) prepared at various additional magnetic fields with thermal annealing on crystalline ITO. The inset in (a) shows selected photocurrent responses to lights switched on and off. 
Because the flat crystalline ITO showed the highest photocurrent response, this substrate was selected and TiO2 films were deposited with various additional external magnetic fields of 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT in order to examine the effects of external magnetic fields. The resulting photocurrent responses for 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT were measured to be 75, 65, 110, and 55 μA cm−2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The sample prepared at 6 mT showed the highest photoelectrocatalytic response. This indicates that an additional field of 6 mT produces more abundant surface active sites50–52 on the TiO2 film, as discussed in the XPS results above. Additionally, it was reported that TiO2 film deposited under 6 mT showed relatively lower resistivity and higher electrical mobility, compared with the films under 0, 3 and 9 mT. This may be somewhat related with higher active surface sites and the measured photocurrent.42,44
To further examine the effects of surface area of a substrate, photocurrent responses (Fig. 7) were measured for TiO2 films at 6 mT on ITO-coated flat, nano-zigzag, nanobead, and nanocone substrates after thermal annealing. The photocurrent densities were found to be 110, 350, 390, and 430 μA cm−2, respectively. The photocurrent density dramatically increased as the surface area increased, and the nanocones showed the highest photocurrent response. This indicates that the water-splitting effect was increased by 400% for TiO2 films on nanocone arrays, as compared with that for a flat surface. The surface areas were approximately calculated to show that nano-zigzag, nanobead, and nanocone structures were 1.8, 2.8, and 2 times larger than the area of the flat surface. Although the calculated surface area of the nanobead was larger than that of the nanocone the photocurrent of the nanobead was smaller than that of the nanocone. This is plausibly due to a formation of discontinuous films on the nanobead. The TiO2 film deposited without an external magnetic field on ITO nanocone-patterned arrays showed a photocurrent density of 330 μA cm−2. This indicates that the external magnetic field could further increase the photocatalytic activity.

Consequently, from the obtained results, the substrate, the surface active sites, and the surface area are believed to be crucial factors in the photoelectrochemical activity of TiO2 films. Furthermore, a crystalline TiO2 film can create relatively many surface active sites compared with an amorphous phase, but surface active sites do not depend only on the crystallinity of a TiO2 film.
4. Conclusions
A new catalytic system of SiO2/ITO/TiO2 nanocone array structures was fabricated using a soft nanolithography technique. SiO2 nanocones were created using an Ar+ ion sputtering method. ITO was coated on the nanocone arrays using an RF sputtering method and the topmost TiO2 layer was deposited on the ITO-coated SiO2 nanocone arrays using an unbalanced RF magnetron sputtering method with various additional external magnetic fields of 0, 3, 6, and 9 mT. For application to photoelectrocatalytic water splitting, the photocurrent responses of the TiO2 films were found to be in the following order for substrates of Al, Si, amorphous ITO, polycrystalline ITO, and crystalline ITO. The activity was further improved by over tenfold by thermal annealing of as-deposited TiO2 films. The crystallinities of ITO and TiO2 were found to play a crucial role in photocatalytic activity. The photocurrent response was further increased by 400% for TiO2 films on patterned nanocone arrays, which was attributed to the increase in surface area. An additional increase in photocurrent response was achieved using TiO2 film deposition with an additional external magnetic field of 6 mT, which was attributed to additional surface active sites being created. Overall, the enhancement in photocatalytic activity was attributed to increased surface active sites and the high surface area of the nano-patterned arrays. This new catalytic system of nanocone arrays and RF sputtering with an additional external magnetic field was found to be a useful fabrication process for improving photocatalytic activity.
