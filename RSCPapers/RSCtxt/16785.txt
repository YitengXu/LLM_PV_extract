TNTs were prepared under various experimental conditions of applied potential, anodization time and the electrolyte water content. The morphology and crystalline structures of the prepared TNTs were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that the nanotube length, diameters and nanotube inter-distance were significantly affected by different anodization conditions. The photocatalytic activities of the prepared TNTs were evaluated via the degradation of rhodamine B in aqueous solution under mercury–xenon (Hg(Xe)) lamp irradiation monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy. The influence of TNT structural properties including tube length, inter-tube distance and crystallinity on their photocatalytic activity was evaluated. It was found that TNTs with shorter and larger nanotube inter-distances have better degradation rates of rhodamine B than long tubes. Moreover, the TNTs annealed at 650 °C to produce an anatase–rutile mixture (86.5 and 13.5% respectively) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than other TNTs annealed at 250 °C, 450 °C, and 850 °C.
1. Introduction
Water shortage has become one of the top challenges facing societies worldwide in this century. The possibility of reusing water or purification of contaminated water is an attractive option to address this problem. Conventional water treatment technologies including chlorination, filtration and membrane technologies have been widely used to reduce the level of pollutants in water. However, some drawbacks of using these methods include the potential to generate secondary toxic pollutants, inability to degrade a variety of pollutants and high operating cost.1,2 Hence the development of new advanced technologies based on new materials and purification processes is urgently needed.
The advanced oxidation process (AOP) has been shown to be a promising solution to reduce existing water pollution and solve water shortage problems.3,4 Photocatalysis is a process which uses light to activate a catalyst, usually a semiconductor, which can be activated by photons of appropriate energy to form an electron–hole pair allowing redox reactions to take place.4 This process based on nanocatalysts has been used successfully in the degradation of a wide variety of contaminants.5 It was found that the specific surface area plays a major role in the photocatalysis using nanocatalysts providing more adsorption and catalytic sites for photocatalytic reactions.
Among the various photocatalysts, nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2 or titania) has attracted considerable attention due to its unique properties including low cost fabrication, large specific surface area, chemical stability, non-toxicity and high photocatalytic activity. The titania nanostructures have been synthesized by various approaches including a template method,6 a sol–gel method,7 a hydrothermal treatment8 and electrochemical anodization.9–11 Electrochemical anodization of titanium based on self-ordering is demonstrated as one of most attractive approaches because it is a simple, inexpensive, self-driven and scalable process for creating a titania oxide film with characteristic vertically aligned and highly ordered nanotubular or nanoporous structures.12,13 Titania nanotube (TNT) arrays were extensively explored for broad applications as reported in thousands of papers; the most attractive and promising are solar cells, drug delivery and biosensing.9,11
Several studies have successfully demonstrated the application of TNTs as a photocatalyst for the removal of chemical pollutants in the environment.9,14,15 These studies confirmed that nanotubular geometry of TNTs has better photocatalytic activity compared with that of spherical forms of TiO2 powders or nanoparticles.16 In order to improve and manipulate photocatalytic properties of TNTs the influence of crystallinity and the geometry of nanotube structures (length, the pore size) was studied and shown to have an impact on their catalytic performance.17,18 TNTs have a unique structure with tightly and perpendicularly packed nanotubes and an inter-distance between nanotubes with additional exposure of an external nanotube surface that is expected to have impact on their photocatalytic performance.9–11 The chemical composition of the inner TNT surface due to the incorporation of ions from electrolyte may have a different composition from the outer TNT surface including different catalytic properties. This issue has not been explored yet, but it is important for many applications of TNTs where both surfaces can be used as active reaction areas.
Hence the aim of this study is to synthesize TNTs with different nanotube lengths, inter-tube distances and crystallinities under different anodization conditions and explore their influence on photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity decomposition of organic pollutants was investigated using rhodamine B as a model organic molecule. The degradation rate of rhodamine B using different TNT substrates under UV illumination was performed in aqueous solution using UV–Vis spectroscopy in order to determine key structural parameters which determine photocatalytic properties of TNTs.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials
The titanium foil (0.127 mm thickness, 99.7% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethylene glycol, ammonium fluoride (NH4F) and rhodamine B were also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Deionized water (DI) was used throughout the experiments.
2.2. Fabrication of TNTs on Ti
The Ti foil was cut into small pieces 15 mm × 15 mm and used as the substrate to prepare TNTs by an electrochemical anodization process. The Ti foil was mechanically polished by abrasive paper, and then degreased by sonicating in acetone, isopropanol and ethanol followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water and drying with a nitrogen stream. For electrochemical anodization, a special electrochemical cell with two electrodes and computer-controlled power supply (Agilent) was used as previously reported.19,20 Samples were brought into contact with a Cu back-plate in an electrode holder that permits only a circular area of the Ti metal with diameter of 1 cm to be exposed to the electrolyte. This Ti served as the anode while the platinum (Pt) foil was used as the cathode. TNTs were prepared through a two-step anodization process using electrolyte solution containing ethylene glycol with 0.3% NH4F and water content (1–3%). The first anodization step was performed under 100 V for 2 hours at room temperature. The resultant layer of TNTs was removed mechanically followed by sonicating in methanol. The second anodization step was performed under various voltages from 20 V to 100 V at different times from 20–80 minutes in order to investigate the influence of these parameters on the nanotube structure (diameters and length). After anodization, the samples were rinsed with DI water and dried in a nitrogen stream.
2.3. Characterization of TNTs samples
The surface morphology of the prepared TNTs samples was examined by a FEG Environmental SEM (Quanta 450). EDX spectra were obtained to determine the elemental composition of TNTs. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used for crystal phase identification and estimation of the crystallite size. The XRD measurements were carried out at room temperature using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 X-ray diffractometer operating with diffracted beam graphite monochromators (Cu Kα with λ = 0.15406 nm) at 40 kV and 15 mA. The crystalline size was calculated from the peak width using Debye Scherrer equation:21 D = Kλ/(β cosθ)(1)where K is a dimensionless constant (0.94), θ is the diffraction angle, λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54 Å), and β is the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) in the 2θ scan (radians). The weight fractions of the anatase and rutile phases of the nanotubes were estimated based on the corresponding most intense peaks using the following equations: WA = [1 + 1.26(IR/IA)]−1(2) WR = [1 + 0.8(IA/IR)]−1(3)where IA and IR are the X-ray integrated intensities of reflection of anatase and rutile, respectively.22
2.4. Photodegradation experiments
The photocatalytic activity of the TNTs was evaluated via the photodegradation of rhodamine B in aqueous solution. The photodegradation experiments were carried out in a glass beaker under a 1000 W mercury–xenon (Hg(Xe)) lamp irradiation. This type of lamp has spectral distribution that includes a continuous spectrum from the ultraviolet to infrared spectrum. The incident photon flux entering the photoreactor was 9.1 × 10−6 Einstein cm−2 s−1. The TNT sample with a diameter of 1 cm (8–10 mg) was placed in 10 ml of rhodamine B aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 1.6 mg L−1. Prior to the photoreaction, the TNT sample was immersed in the rhodamine B aqueous solution for 1 hour in a dark area to reach the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. After that, the reaction solution was irradiated vertically from the top by the Hg(Xe) lamp with a distance of 6 cm while slightly agitating the solution using a stirrer. After every 30 minutes of sample irradiation, a solution was taken and centrifuged for 3 minutes and the concentration of rhodamine B was measured at an absorbance of 554 nm. The degradation of rhodamine B was monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy to calculate degradation efficiency using the equation: Degradation efficiency (%) = Co − Ct/Co × 100(4)where, Co: initial concentration of rhodamine B; and Ct: rhodamine B concentration at time t (min).
As a control the irradiation of rhodamine B without TNTs was obtained. The photonic efficiency (ξ) was calculated as the ratio of the initial photocatalytic degradation rate (mol L−1 s−1) to the rate of incident photons entering the reactor (Einstein L−1 s−1).23
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization using SEM
A typical TNT structure produced through a two-step anodization process (at 100 V for 1 hour, 2nd anodization step) at 25 °C is shown in Fig. 1. The top view of the TNT surface shows pores with diameters of 120 ± 10 nm (Fig. 1a) with tight interconnection of nanotubes without interspace. A cross-sectional image of the TNT is presented in Fig. 1b, which illustrates the very well ordered tubes oriented perpendicularly to the top surface of the Ti substrate with an average tube length of 45 ± 5 μm. The closed ends of these tubes are shown in the bottom view (Fig. 1c). The EDX spectrum of TNTs is presented in Fig. 1d showing characteristic X-ray energy levels for titanium (K = 4.510 keV and K = 4.931 keV) and oxygen (K = 0.523 keV) as a major elements of TNTs with percentage weights of 64% and 27.2%, respectively. Carbon and nitrogen were presented with percentage weights of 4.3% and 4.5%, respectively, and their presence is related to the adsorption of ions from electrolyte (ethylene glycol with and NH4F).

3.1.1. Controlling TNT dimensions by anodization voltage and time. 
To study the influence of the anodization voltage on the TNT structures, five experiments were conducted at 25 °C using the same anodization time (1 hour) and different voltages 20 V, 40 V, 60 V, 80 V and 100 V all performed in the 2nd anodization step. Ti anodized at a low voltage of 20 V for 1 hour didn't show the growth of nanotubes. A partial porous structure was observed indicating that 20 V is not a sufficient voltage to grow nanotubes due to the weak electrochemical oxidation and oxide dissolution process. Previous studies showed that titanium (Ti) is oxidized to the Ti4+ ion by an electric field to form an oxide layer only under sufficient applied potential.9,11,24 The strong electric field is also required for the dissolution of the formed oxide at the electrolyte/oxide interface which is important for the formation and growth of the nanotube structure and their alignment on the Ti surface.24 This is confirmed by our results where by increasing the anodization voltage from 40 V to 100 V, well aligned nanotubes are formed. Fig. 2 summarises the influence of the TNT pore diameters prepared under different anodization voltages (20–100 V) for 60 min. The graph indicates a linear increase of the pore diameters from 50 nm to 120 nm with the anodization voltage (40–100 V). These results confirm that the diameters of TNTs can be controlled by the voltage which is in agreement with previous studies.9–11 However it is important to state that the anodization voltage also has influence on the growth rate of TNTs. The TNTs with different lengths of 5 ± 1.6 μm, 10 ± 2.5 μm, 20 ± 2.3 μm, and 45 ± 3.3 μm were obtained for 60 min using voltages 40 V, 60 V, 80 V and 100 V, respectively (Fig. 2). Therefore, to prepare TNTs with desired pore diameters and length it is necessary to consider the growth rate at different voltages and anodization times.
 Fig. 2  Controlling the inner diameters and length of TNTs using different anodization voltages (20 V–100 V, two step anodization, and electrolyte composition of 0.3% NH4F and 3% water) and constant anodization time (60 min). 
To study the influence of the anodization time on the TNT structures, four experiments were conducted at 100 V using anodization times of 20 min, 40 min, 60 min and 80 min. Results are summarized in Fig. 3 showing the changes of nanotube lengths and nanopore diameters. It was observed that the length of TNTs was increased with increasing anodization time showing a linear relationship with an average growth rate of 0.6 μm min−1. The lengths of the TNTs prepared for 20 min, 40 min, 60 min and 80 min were about 9 μm, 19 μm, 45 μm and 50 μm, respectively. The anodization time also has influence on pore diameters showing increased TNTs diameters from 50 nm to 120 nm. These results confirm that the anodization time can be used as a simple parameter for controlling the TNT length. By controlling the voltage both the length and pore diameters can be precisely tuned to values required for specific applications. The prepared TNTs with different dimensions with and without the thermal treatment were explored in the following study to determine their influence on catalytic performance.

3.1.2. Influence of electrolyte water content. 
To study the influence of the electrolyte water content on the structure of the nanotubes, an experiment was conducted by reducing the electrolyte water content from 3% to 1% under the same anodization conditions (100 V for 60 min for the 2nd anodization at 25 °C). The SEM images of the prepared TNTs showing the top, cross-section and bottom surface are presented in Fig. 4. These images show that the tube length and inner diameter were significantly influenced by decreasing the water content from 3% to 1%. It was found that the length and the inner diameter of the TNTs prepared in electrolyte solution containing 1% of water were decreased to 16.9 ± 5 μm and 46.2 ± 10 nm compared to 45 ± 1.1 μm and 120 ± 2.3 nm for those prepared using 3% of water in electrolyte. Furthermore, the inter-tube distance and voids between nanotubes were increased compared with those of TNTs prepared in 3% water (Fig. 1), as a result of reducing the water content, as shown in the top and bottom views in Fig. 4a and c, respectively. The scheme of TNTs with a larger inter-distance is presented in Fig. 4d. These results clearly indicate that the water content plays a major role in the nanotube growth rate and by controlling water contents it is possible to make TNTs with controllable inter-distances. Water is acting as a source of H+ and O2− ions required for the formation of an oxide layer, and hence, increasing the water content leads to the increase of the growth rate and tube length. This anodization condition, which provides TNTs with a characteristic large inter-space between nanotubes, is used to explore the influence of the external TNT surface and increased surface area on their catalytic properties.

3.1.3. XRD characterization of annealed TNTs. 
A crystalline structure of TiO2 is highly desired in photocatalytic applications since it eliminates defects of the amorphous nature and improves their catalytic properties.25 TNTs as produced are amorphous and to crystallize them requires annealing on TNTs at different temperatures. The XRD patterns obtained of TNTs after annealing at different temperatures (250 °C, 450 °C, 650 °C and 850 °C) in a dry oxygen atmosphere are shown in Fig. 5. These patterns were compared to the XRD data obtained from the database.26 The TNTs as produced (25 °C) showed a broad peak indicating the amorphous phase. The XRD peaks obtained at an annealing temperature of 250 °C correspond to the anatase phase of TiO2 (JCPDS CAS no. 21-1272). These peaks were observed at 2θ = 25.2° (101), 37.5° (004), 47.8° (200), 53.5° (105), 55° (201), 62.3° (213) and 75° (215). The intensity of these peaks increased with increasing annealing temperatures to 450 °C and 650 °C. The presence of these peaks and the absence of rutile phase peaks at 250 °C and 450 °C is an indication of the successful production of the anatase TiO2 phase. Rutile type TiO2 (13.5%) was clearly observed based on peaks appearing at 2θ = 27.5° (110), 36° (101) and 41.1° (111) in the sample that was annealed at 650 °C. When the annealing temperature was increased to 850 °C, these peaks became more pronounced and a further rutile peak appeared at 54.2° (211). These results clearly indicate that 450 °C is the optimal annealing temperature for obtaining exclusively the anatase phase of TiO2. Increasing the temperature over 450 °C leads to the conversion from the thermodynamically metastable anatase phase to the more stable rutile phase. Table 1 lists the calculated values of average crystalline sizes and phase composition of TNT samples annealed at different temperatures, using equations (1, 2 and 3 in experimental details section). TNT samples annealed at 250 and 450 °C have only the anatase phase of TiO2 (100%) while the TNT sample annealed at 650 °C has anatase–rutile mixtures (86.5% and 13.5%, respectively). The conversion from the anatase to rutile phase of TiO2 becomes more pronounced by increasing the temperature to 850 °C (12.1% anatase and 87.9% rutile).

3.2. Photodegradation study using TNTs with different nanotube dimensions
The photocatalytic activity of the prepared TNTs was evaluated via the degradation of rhodamine B in aqueous solution under mercury–xenon (Hg(Xe)) lamp irradiation. The notable decrease in the rhodamine B absorbance in the presence of TNTs prepared through a two-step anodization process (the length of 45 μm) is shown in Fig. 6. It confirms that TNTs can catalyze the degradation of rhodamine B in the presence of light. The decrease in the absorbance was accompanied by a shift in the absorbance peak position from 554 nm to 542 nm which is a result of the formation of intermediate products.27 The TNTs without annealing (as prepared at 25 °C) had degraded only about 44.2% of rhodamine B within 180 minutes (Table 2). This low degradation rate is due to the amorphous structure of as prepared TNTs. Although an amorphous phase of TNTs has a large surface area which plays a major role in the photocatalysis process, it has a low photoactivity because of the high number of surface defects, which act as recombination centres for the electrons and holes, and low crystallinity.12,28

3.2.1. Kinetic study. 
Previous studies have shown that the photodegradation of rhodamine B over illuminated TiO2 particles follows the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) kinetics model: r = dC/dt = kKC/(1 + KC)(5)where r is the oxidation rate of the reactant (mg l−1 min), C is the concentration of the reactant (mg l−1), t is the illumination time, k is the reaction rate constant (mg l−1 min), and K is the adsorption coefficient of the reactant (l mg−1). Eqn (5) can be simplified to the first-order equation when the initial concentration is small: ln(Co/C) = kt(6)where k is the rate constant, C is the concentration, and Co is the concentration at t = 0.29–31
In this study, the semi-log graph of the rhodamine B concentration versus irradiation time gave a straight line (Fig. 7) indicating a pseudo-first-order reaction. The slope of the linear regression equals the first order rate constant. The degradation reaction using 45 μm long TNTs has a rate constant (k) of 3 × 10−3 min−1. The correlation coefficient (R2) value is around 0.98 which indicates excellent linear reliability.

3.2.2. Influence of the TNT structure on photodegradation performance. 
The degradation results of rhodamine B solution in the presence of TNTs with two different lengths (45 μm and 10 μm) are presented in Fig. 8 to show the influence of the TNT length on their photocatalytic activity. It was found that the 10 μm long TNTs exhibited a considerable enhancement in the degradation rate of rhodamine B over the 45 μm long TNTs. The 10 μm long TNTs degraded 67.5% of rhodamine B within 180 minutes versus 44.2% of the 45 μm long TNTs (Table 2). It is generally known that long nanotubes have a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of dyes based on the fact that they provide more active sites for the adsorption of the dyes on their surfaces. However, the result here indicates that short tubes have higher photocatalytic activity than long tubes likely due to two factors. One is the diffusion of rhodamine B molecules and the second is the incidence of photons which are more efficient inside shorter nanotubes. On the other hand, long nanotubes have limited penetration depth of the photons which affects the diffusion of the reactant inside the tubes and in turn negatively affects the photocatalytic activity.32 The conclusion is that dimensions of TNTs need to be optimised with respect to these two parameters.
 Fig. 8  The influence of the length of TNTs (45 μm and 10 μm) on their photodegradation properties and removal of rhodamine B. 
To study the influence of the inter-tube distance, two photodegradation experiments were carried out using a TNT sample that does not have space between tubes, which was prepared with the standard water content of 3%, and a TNT sample that has a space between tubes, which was prepared by reducing the water content to 1%. Degradation results for rhodamine B using these two samples are presented in Fig. 9. TNTs prepared by 1% water showed a better degradation rate of rhodamine B compared to TNTs prepared with 3% water. TNT prepared using 1% water degraded about 75.9% of rhodamine B within 180 minutes versus 44.2% by TNTs prepared using 3% water (Table 2). This enhancement in the degradation rate is explained by the fact that the space between tubes provides more catalytic sites for the adsorption of the rhodamine B molecules using both the inner and the outer surface of TNTs. It should be mentioned that these two types of TNT samples are slightly different in lengths (45 μm for 3% water versus 16.9 μm 1% water). However, when comparing the rhodamine B degradation rate of 17 μm long TNTs with a space between tubes (75.9%) to the 10 μm long TNTs without space (67.5%) (Table 2), it is very obvious that the space between tubes (i.e. inter-tube distance) can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TNTs.

3.2.3. Influence of the TNT annealing temperature. 
To study the influence of the annealing temperature on photocatalytic activity and the degradation of rhodamine B, prepared TNT samples were annealed at 250 °C, 450 °C, 650 °C and 850 °C. Photocatalytic performance of TNTs with different dimensions and crystallinities is presented as the degradation rate, rate constant and photonic efficiency and summarized in Table 2. Table 2 and Fig. 10 present results showing complete degradation of rhodamine B on TNT samples annealed at 250 °C, 450 °C and 650 °C along with colour removal within less than 180 minutes compared with 44.2% degradation on the TNT control sample (as produced at 25 °C). This enhancement of photocatalytic activity can be explained by the significant influence on the crystal structure of TNTs by thermal annealing. These results are consistent with XRD results (Fig. 5) which confirmed that the crystal structure of TNTs was changed from amorphous to crystalline anatase, rutile phase and their mixtures by annealing. It has been previously reported that the TiO2 anatase phase has the highest photocatalytic activity compared with other phases. Interestingly, the results obtained in this study indicate that the anatase–rutile mixture of TiO2 has higher photocatalytic activity than the pure anatase phase. The TNTs annealed at 650 °C which have anatase–rutile mixtures (86.5% and 13.5%, respectively) showed the fastest degradation rate since they had completely degraded rhodamine B within 90 minutes followed by the TNTs annealed at 450 °C and 250 °C (100% anatase) (120 and 150 minutes respectively) (Table 2). The TNTs annealed at 850 °C which also have anatase–rutile mixtures (12.1 and 87.9% respectively) showed the slowest degradation rate (51.6%) among the annealed samples, which was similar to as produced amorphous TNTs (25 °C). This is explained by partial collapse of the TNT tubular structure by annealing at a temperature over 700 °C, which is in agreement with previous studies.33

The kinetic study of rhodamine B photodegradation reactions by TNTs is summarized in Fig. 11. These graphs indicate the pseudo-first order reaction confirmed by the straight line in the plot of the log of the rhodamine B concentration versus degradation time.

The slope of the linear regression equals the first order rate constant with an average coefficient value around 0.98. The rate constant (k) of each reaction is calculated and subsequently used to calculate the photonic efficiencies. Table 2 summarizes the reaction rate constant and photonic efficiency of TNTs with different dimensions, inter-tube distance and crystallinity. It is generally known that by increasing the light intensity, the photonic efficiency decreased.34,35 This is because at high light intensity the potential of electron–hole pair recombination is higher than electron–hole pair separation.29,36 Therefore, the photonic efficiencies in this study could be improved by utilizing a low photon flux in the photocatalytic process.

4. Conclusion
The TNTs were prepared successfully using an electrochemical anodization approach. The presented results show that nanotube length, diameter, inter-distance and crystallinity can be adjusted by controlling the applied potential, anodization time, electrolyte water content and annealing temperature. Based on the results of the photodegradation experiments using rhodamine B it is shown that the photocatalytic activity of TNTs is significantly affected by the structural and crystal properties of TNTs. Short tubes and larger inter-distance between nanotubes revealed higher photocatalytic activity than long and tightly packed TNTs. The annealing is shown to have the most significant influence on photocatalytic properties with the highest performance of TNTs with anatase–rutile mixtures (86.5% and 13.5% respectively) prepared by annealing at 650 °C. In conclusion for the application of TNTs involving their photocatalytic requirements it is important to consider their dimensions and crystallinity which are controllable and can be optimised for a specific application.
