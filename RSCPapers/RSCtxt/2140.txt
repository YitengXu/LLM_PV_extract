The dye series was strategically designed to elucidate structure–property relationships, concerning overall performance and compatibility with these two electrolytes. Selective fluorine incorporation improved I3−/I−-based DSC performance, while hindering performance with the positively charged cobalt-based redox shuttle. Incorporation of a pyridine heterocycle into the DPP chromophore increased spectral breadth, but decreased performance metrics for both electrolyte systems. These results are understood through detailed electrochemical, photophysical, and computational studies.1. IntroductionThe tolerance for device component interchange within a dye sensitized solar cell (DSC)1 mimics the diversity and robustness associated with natural photosynthesis.2 Choosing the appropriate nanostructured metal oxide, sensitizer, and redox shuttle offers control over aesthetic properties such as transparency and colour, as well as performance properties such as the attainable output voltage and current density.3 These advantages, and promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 12%,4 make such devices ideal for integration within modern infrastructure. One of the most critical components comprising a DSC is the sensitizer, greatly impacting overall light absorption and colour. Herein, we describe our recent efforts to understand how diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) can be best implemented in DSC sensitizers.A major development in DSC technology occurred with the advent of high-performance “metal”-free sensitizers (i.e. without the precious metal ruthenium), which typically rely on the donor–π–bridge-acceptor (D–π–A) motif,5 where the bridge serves primarily to extend π-conjugation, while efficiently relaying electron density from the donor to the acceptor. Here, the DPP core serves as an inherently coloured π-bridge – leading to the conceptualization of the donor–chromophore–anchor (D–C–A) sensitizer (Fig. 1). This dye class, although not called as such, is already under development in the field of DSC sensitizers. This approach has achieved light harvesting of 1000 nm with squaraine6 and holds the world-record PCE with the porphyrin chromophore.4 Understanding how to molecularly engineer the industrial pigment DPP into a high-performance D–C–A sensitizer represents underexplored potential within the field of DSC sensitizer research. Fig. 1  A graphical representation of how the donor–chromophore–anchor approach differs from the donor–π–acceptor approach. The DPP core is at the heart of many chemical structures for application in materials technology, from car-paint pigments7 to small molecule and polymeric organic photovoltaics.8 However, DPP-based sensitizers have thus far exhibited limited use in DSCs.9–16 The seminal work on DPP sensitizers was published in 2010,10 comparing the phenyl-DPP (PhDPP) and thienyl-DPP (ThDPP) bridge. This original study prompted us to investigate DPP within our laboratory, which led to the development of higher efficiency ThDPP-based sensitizers,17 as well as the discovery of an unexpectedly high performance asymmetric DPP bridge. A mixed thienyl- and phenyl-DPP unit (Th-DPP-Ph) provided enhanced incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), and the highest PCE of all DPP-based sensitizers, at that time (DPP07, Scheme 1).18 Meanwhile, S. Qu et al. showed an explicit red-shift in the absorption band owing to replacement of a strong donor such as indoline instead of triphenylamine (TPA) and achieved 7.4%.12 Another approach combining the DPP and porphyrin chromophores yielded panchromatic sensitizers,15,16 and achieved 7.7% (ref. 15) very recently. Furthermore, there exist very few sensitizers with a blue colour,19 largely because achieving absorption beyond 700 nm with organic sensitizers is a design and synthesis challenge that has not been effectively surmounted, while maintaining high-performance. Very recently, we demonstrated the design and synthesis of high performing blue coloured DPP-based sensitizers employing the indoline donor, widening the colour palette of this promising, aesthetically pleasing solar cell technology.20 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for DPP07, 10, and 12. Suzuki coupling performed with 2.5 equivalents of K3PO4 in toluene:water:t-amyl alcohol (10:0.1:0.05) and with 2.0 equivalents of (a) 4-formylphenylboronic acid, pinacol ester; (b) 3-fluoro-4-formylphenylboronic acid, pinacol ester; (c) toluene:methanol was used as a solvent with 5-formylfuran-2-boronic acid; (d) 1.1 equivalents of NBS in DCM; (e) Suzuki conditions for (a) and (b) with the coupling partner N,N-bis[4-(hexyloxy)phenyl]-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-benzamine. Herein, two new sensitizers based on the DPP pigment were designed and synthesized for use in DSC devices. The donor group was preserved throughout the series, while the anchor and chromophore were modulated. In order to improve upon the reference dye, DPP07,18 an attempt to balance aggregation, red light response, and electron withdrawing strength on the anchor was made. Single atom replacements within the DPP07 structure were performed to yield DPP10 and DPP12, where C → N and H → F substitutions were implemented, respectively (see Scheme 1). Spectroscopic, electrochemical, and quantum chemical investigations of this sensitizer series were employed to grasp how these structural modifications affect the colour and performance properties of the final DSC devices.2. Experimental2.1. Synthetic methods and materialsAll detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.†2.2. DSC fabricationDSCs were prepared using a previously reported procedure.17,18,20 In brief, the TiO2 transparent electrodes (trans) composed of ∼20 nm anatase on fluorine doped thin oxide (FTO, 4 mm thickness, 10 ohms per sq., Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) conducting glass were controlled to obtain a desired thickness. A 4–5 μm scattering layer (sc) with large particles (400 nm, CCIC, HPW-400) was printed on the top of the transparent layer to increase the light path length by scattering. The TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a 0.025 mM solution of a dye with 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholic acid (chenodeoxycholic acid) in a 4-tert-butanol–acetonitrile mixture (1:1 v/v) and kept for 15 h at room temperature. Two electrolytes were applied: EL_I (an iodine based electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.25 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a 15/85 (v/v) mixture of valeronitrile and acetonitrile) and EL_Co (a cobalt tris-bpy based electrolyte containing 0.22 M Co(II), 0.05 M Co(III), 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile). As for the counter electrode, a platinized counter electrode and carbonaceous catalyst FTO (TEC 15 ohms per sq., Pilkington) were used for EL_I and EL_Co electrolyte systems, respectively. The carbonaceous typed catalyst has been, in general, known to perform better than Pt owing to the low charge transfer resistance particularly for the cobalt redox system.21–23 The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and the counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich type cell with a gap of a hot-melt ionomer film, Surlyn (25 μm, Du-Pont).2.3. DSC characterizationA 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to characterize the solar cells. The spectral output of the lamp was matched in the region of 350–750 nm with the aid of a Schott K113 Tempax sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany) so as to reduce the mismatch between the simulated and true solar spectra to less than 4%. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by applying external potential bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). For IPCE measurement, a modulated light intensity data acquisition system was used to control the Incident Photon-to-Current conversion Efficiency (IPCE) measurement. The modulation frequency was about 1 Hz. Light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) was focused through a computer controlled Gemini-180 double monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) onto the photovoltaic cell under test. A white light bias was used to bring the total light intensity on the device under test closer to operating conditions. The devices were masked with a black metal aperture to attain an illuminated active area of 0.2 cm2.2.4. Photovoltage and photocurrent transientPhotovoltage transients were observed by using a pump pulse generated by 4 red light emitting diodes controlled by a fast solid-state switch with a white light bias. The pulse of red light with widths of 50 ms was incident on the photoanode side of the cell, and its intensity was controlled to keep a suitably low level to generate the exponential voltage decay where the charge recombination rate constants are obtained directly from the exponential decay rate.24 A white bias light, also incident on the same side of the device, was supplied by white diodes. Small perturbation transient photocurrent measurements were performed in a similar manner to the open-circuit voltage decay measurement.3. Results and discussionThe synthesis begins with construction of an asymmetric DPP chromophore (see Scheme 1). Two variants were targeted to scrutinize steric interactions between the DPP core and the requisite aryl groups. It is well known that the thienyl-DPP dihedral angle remains close to planar after N-alkylation, whereas the phenyl twists out of the DPP plane, hypsochromically shifting the absorption spectrum of the N-alkylated DPP product.25,26 This effect is evident when comparing the absorption spectra of DPP03 (Th-DPP-Th)17 and DPP07. Construction of the chromophore with 2-cyano-5-bromopyridine was expected to yield a more planar Th-DPP-Py chromophore, with broader spectral response and balanced aggregation effects (DPP07vs.DPP10). An industrial synthetic procedure27 was employed to realize large quantities of these DPP moieties.After the sensitizer core was fabricated, the anchoring groups were installed by Suzuki cross-coupling to lay the foundation for a structure–property relationship study. By attaching a 2-fluorobenzaldehyde unit, we could investigate the effect of additional electron-withdrawing strength on the anchoring group, compared to the reference benzaldehyde (DPP07vs.DPP12). The electron donating group, bis(hexyloxy)triphenylamine, was attached via one last Suzuki-coupling. And, finally, the aldehyde-terminated dyes were converted to functional sensitizers with cyanoacetic acid through the Knoevenagel reaction, which yields the cyanoacrylic acid functional group that binds to TiO2.First insights into how the structural modifications affected the electronic properties of these sensitizers came from simple visual observation. By the naked eye, it is apparent that DPP10 achieves a desirable blue colour in solution, while the extra withdrawing strength from the fluorine atom substitution on DPP12 did not significantly change the purple colour of DPP07. A more detailed investigation of opto-electronic response was performed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations (see Fig. 2). Electrochemical reactions were also performed to understand how these structural changes affected the energy levels, a critical parameter concerning charge injection and regeneration of the sensitizers on TiO2 in the DSC device (Table 1).3 Fig. 2  Absorbance of DPP dyes.

The charge-transfer absorption band is modeled extremely accurately, while the higher energy absorption band is slightly blue-shifted and slightly lower in intensity than established empirically. This is likely an outcome of the inability to perfectly match the correct functional (and corresponding Hartree–Fock percentage) for both excitation transitions. Beyond looking at the orbital contributions, the difference in electron density between the excited and ground states (i.e. ρs1 − ρs0) can give an idea of where the electron and hole reside in the excited state. The vectorial electron motion, from the donor to the acceptor, is clear in Fig. 3. Fig. 3  Response density for DPP07 (a), DPP10 (b), and DPP12 (c). Apropos the bathochromic shift observed on going from DPP07 to DPP10, calculations suggest that the Th-DPP-Py bridge red-shifts in absorption simply by increasing quinoidal character and extending the chromophore conjugation length through planarization, rather than the electron deficiency of the ring stabilizing the excited state. The experimental and calculated absorption spectra for DPP03 (Th-DPP-Th) and DPP10 are compared in the ESI,† and while thiophene is certainly not as electron deficient as pyridine, DPP03 provides the lower energy excitation. Additionally, there is a decrease of aromatic stabilization energies on going from benzene to pyridine, which lowers the required energy to attain the quinoidal/excited state structure. It is therefore unlikely that the stronger electron acceptor character of pyridine is the root cause for the extended red-light response of DPP10 compared to DPP07. This greater electron affinity of the pyridyl ring did, however, manifest itself in the electrochemical reduction potential (vide supra), and it could be the root cause for some unexpected behaviour within the final DSC device.Under identical experimental conditions, ∼6 + 5 μm (transparent + scattering) TiO2 films, I3−/I− electrolyte, and the same concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), DPP12 achieved 7.3% PCE, the same as the benchmark sensitizer DPP07 (see Table 2 and Fig. 4). DPP10 showed a decrease in performance, owing to a loss in photocurrent. This result might be associated with the electrochemical reduction potential as mentioned above. Utilizing the cobalt electrolyte provided the expected increase in open circuit voltage (Voc), owing to the higher oxidation potential of this redox shuttle compared to I3−/I−.30 It is noted that a transparent TiO2 film with a bigger pore size, ∼30 nm, leading to greater porosity, is used in order to minimize diffusion limitations with the cobalt electrolyte.31 Gratifyingly, there was no loss in the short circuit current (Jsc), which led to increased PCE for all sensitizers except for DPP12 – the case of DPP12 is more fully explained below. The IPCE of DPP12 was almost identical to the IPCE of DPP07, as shown in Fig. 4. It is apparent that the extended IPCEs of DPP10 observed at longer wavelength compared to DPP07 and DPP12 are in agreement with the optical properties mentioned above. DPP10 showed the lowest IPCE, as expected from the lowest photocurrent. All IPCEs with the cobalt electrolyte, except for DPP10, were slightly lower than those with the I3−/I− electrolyte, which is most likely ascribed to the low surface area of the TiO2 film, owing to its thinner thickness and bigger pores used for the cobalt redox system.

Solid lines represent the I3−/I− electrolyte and dashed lines represent the Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ electrolyte. Fine lines in (a) represent dark currents. All data were obtained with 1.25 mM CDCA in dye solution and a Pt counter electrode. A TiO2 film used for I3−/I− and Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ was 6 (trans) + 5 (sc) μm and 5 (trans, 30 nm size pore) + 5 (sc) μm TiO2 film, respectively. Average data of two cells are summarized in the ESI.†Photovoltage/photocurrent transient measurements were performed to investigate the potential origin of the variation in Voc among the sensitizers. All chemical capacitances of devices employing the same type of electrolyte overlap and the capacitances shifted down on replacing the I3−/I− electrolyte with the cobalt-based electrolyte (see Fig. 5a); the shift is reasonably ascribed to the higher oxidation potential of the cobalt-based redox couple. The increase in the Voc of DPP12 with the I3−/I− electrolyte compared to those of DPP07 and DPP10 is most likely due to an increase in electron lifetimes (see Fig. 5b). However, with the cobalt-based electrolyte, the electron lifetimes of DPP12 showed the opposite case; rather, slightly shorter electron lifetimes were observed for DPP12 than for DPP07, which explains the lower performance for DPP12 when utilizing the cobalt-based electrolyte (and the relatively smaller change in Voc on going from I3−/I− to Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ with this sensitizer compared to DPP07). We hypothesize that this inversion of electron lifetime, on switching from I3−/I− to Co[(bpy)]3+/2+, is a direct result of greater electrostatic repulsion and attraction, respectively, between the sensitizers and the redox shuttle.32–34 This is to say, the electronegative fluorine atom helps to bring the Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ redox shuttle into close proximity with the TiO2 surface, facilitating charge recombination, decreasing electron lifetime, and ultimately limiting the Voc enhancement with this electrolyte. The case is the opposite with I3−/I−, where the negatively charged iodide species are repelled and thus enhanced performance values are realized. The incorporation of pyridine turned out to hinder device performance with both I3−/I− and Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ redox shuttles; DPP10 showed the shortest electron lifetime, lowest Voc and least Jsc. This could be due to the basic properties of pyridine or the increase in electron affinity reflected in the electrochemical reduction potential measurement. We observed that all transient data are in good agreement with PV results, and that longer electron lifetime provides the physical basis for increased photovoltage with these sensitizers.

Closed markers represent the I3−/I− electrolyte and open markers represent the Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ electrolyte. With efforts to finely optimize device elements – CDCA implementation, fine-tuning the redox shuttle regeneration catalyst on the counter electrode, and controlling the TiO2 film thickness – enhancement in PV performances was achieved as shown in Tables 3 and 4 (and JV curves in the ESI†). The best result using the I3−/I− electrolyte was achieved with DPP12 (7.74%; 8.28% at 0.095 sun), followed by DPP07 (7.67%) and DPP10 (5.67%) at AM1.5 sunlight (see Table 3). All dyes were improved with the cobalt electrolyte: DPP07 (8.74%), DPP10 (6.70%) and DPP12 (8.01%). Particularly, the benchmark sensitizer DPP07 achieved a PCE of 8.74% (see Table 4).

ConclusionsA series of donor–chromophore–anchor (D–C–A) sensitizers comprising the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) chromophore were synthesized and tested in both I3−/I− and Co[(bpy)]3+/2+ liquid electrolyte DSC devices. This strategically designed dye series elucidated structure–property relationships impacting overall performance and compatibility with these two electrolyte systems. Selective fluorine incorporation on the benchmark sensitizer DPP07, to yield DPP12, improved the PCE with the formally negatively charged I3−/I−-based electrolyte, while hindering performance with the formally 3+/2+ cobalt-based redox shuttle. Incorporation of a pyridine heterocycle into the DPP chromophore (DPP10) increased spectral breadth, but decreased all output characteristics with both electrolyte systems. These results are understood through detailed electrochemical, photophysical, and computational studies. The benchmark DPP-based sensitizer, DPP07, yielded improved performance with the cobalt-based electrolyte (η = 8.74%), compared to our previously reported I3−/I−-based electrolyte;18 however, DPP12 employing the fluorophenylcyanoacrylic acid anchor achieved higher performance (η = 8.01%) than DPP07 (η = 7.67%) with the I3−/I−-based electrolyte and lower performance than DPP07 with the cobalt-based electrolyte. A preliminary stability test with DPP10 conducted under successive 1 sunlight soaking at 60 °C showed that the efficiency remained at 93% of the initial value without a drop of the photocurrent after 1000 h. Our further study is towards electrolyte development and dye design to gain a long-term stability and a high performance.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) under grant agreement no. 246124 of the SANS project for financial support, the joint development project funded by Dongjin Semichem Co., Ltd.
