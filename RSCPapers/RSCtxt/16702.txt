    , Accepted 7th December 2016First published on 7th December 2016AbstractTwo perylene dyes characteristic of electron-donors phenanthrocarbazole (PC) and carbazyl functionalized PC are selected to study the complicated dynamics of excited states and charge carriers, which underlie the photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). We have combined femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion and time-resolved single-photon counting techniques to probe the wavelength-dependent photoluminescence dynamics of dye molecules not only dissolved in THF but also grafted on the surface of oxide nanoparticles. Excited state relaxation and electron injection both occur on a similar timescale, resulting in a very distributive kinetics of electron injection. It is also found that the carbazyl ancillary electron-donor causes a faster electron injection, which over-compensates the adverse impact of a slightly shorter lifetime of the equilibrium excited state. Nanosecond transient absorption and transient photovoltage decay measurements have shown that conjugating carbazyl to PC can effectively slow down the kinetics of charge recombination of electrons in titania with both photo-oxidized dye molecules and triiodide anions, improving the cell photovoltage.
Introduction
Over the past 25 years, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 have attracted extensive attention due to their potential of converting optical energy into useful electrical power at a low cost. Continuous investigations on photosensitizing dyes,2–8 redox couples9–14 and functional interfaces15,16 have led to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) benchmark of 14.5%17 measured under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) conditions by a Japanese group in 2015. The PCE of a DSC is strongly related to the selection of photosensitizers, which can not only determine the capacity of light harvesting, but also control the charge recombination by forming a self-organized molecular layer on a titania surface to remove the adverse contact between the electron-transporting and hole-transporting materials, the latter of which plays a crucial role in photovoltage output at a certain flux of carrier generation.18–23 In this regard considerable efforts have been devoted to metal-free donor–acceptor (D–A) organic dyes on primary account of raw material abundance, molecular tailoring flexibility, and bright color.2–8
Since N-annulated perylene (1H-phenanthro[1,10,9,8-cdefg]carbazole, PC) characteristic of a coplanar electronic skeleton has been initially used by Luo et al.24 as an electron-rich unit of zinc-porphyrin dyes in DSCs, PC and its numerous derivatives have been actively exploited as central electron-releasing blocks of organic D–A chromophores,25–32 which brought forth some important performance progress in organic DSCs in recent years. In this context, at the beginning of 2015, we reported a structurally simple perylene dye with ethynylbenzothiadiazole-benzoic acid (EBTBA) as an electron-acceptor, achieving an encouraging PCE of over 10%.30 Subsequently some PAH segments characteristic of prolonged conjugation with non-photoactive auxiliary groups have been developed to construct narrow energy gap photosensitizers to harvest near-infrared solar photons, which have upgraded the PCEs of coadsorbate-free organic dye-sensitized solar cells, being 13% at the moment.31 Various PC-based blocks afford a flexible structural tailoring of photosensitizers, which could also arouse complicated dye structure related photovolatic behaviors originated from the energetic and kinetic interplays.18–23 However, very clear clues are still lacking to guide the rational design of photosensitizers, especially structure-dependent photophysical processes. To get a better knowledge basis for the future development of organic dyes involving the PC segment, in this paper, by selecting two perylene dyes (HW-1 and HW-3, Fig. 1)33 with the respective PC and carbazyl functionalized PC (C-PC) electron-donors, we will carefully take a closer look at the complicated dynamics of excited state relaxation and charge transfer occurring at the photochemical interface.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the herein studied two EBTBA (orange) dyes, HW-1 and HW-3 reported in ref. 33. EBTBA is used as an electron-acceptor of D–A dyes and R is the substituent of 2-hexyldecyl. HW-1 utilizes a single electron-releasing unit N-annulated perylene (PC, green), while HW-3 employs a binary electron-releasing moiety, carbazole-PC (C-PC, magenta). The bond in cyan can be imagined as formed via oxidative coupling of an electron-donor and an electron-acceptor by dehydrogenation. 
Results and discussion
The steady-state UV-Vis and PL spectroscopies of HW-1, HW-3, and their electron-donors in tetrahydrofuran (THF) are shown in Fig. 2a. Vibronic structures are clearly perceived for the electronic absorption spectra of all these PAH molecules, but are completely lost in PL spectra upon the conjugation of electron-donors to electron-acceptor EBTBA. In addition, the attachment of an alkylated carbazole to one end of PC gives rise to a red shifting of maximum absorption wavelengths for both the electron-donor and the D–A dye, mainly owing to a narrower HOMO/LUMO energy gap.33 It is also noted that with respect to electron-donors PC and P-PC, dyes HW-1 and HW-3 feature larger Stokes shifts, implying the occurrence of vibrational and torsional relaxations of photo-generated excited states to a larger extent. With the help of the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion34–38 and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)39–41 techniques, we further monitor time-resolved PL traces (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†) in a broad wavelength range. Interestingly, all the molecules exhibit wavelength-dependent PL kinetics, characteristic of a fast decay at a high-energy PL wavelength, and on a similar timescale a slow rise at a low-energy PL wavelength. As exemplified in Fig. 2b, the PL traces of HW-3 are obviously different at the three selected wavelengths of 560 nm, 700 nm and 900 nm. Moreover, a global fitting of curves at all PL wavelengths can be nicely performed using the Surface Xplorer software (version 2.3), using four time constants tabulated in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). On the basis of aforementioned time constants, each PL trace can be fitted via a four-exponential function convoluted with a Gaussian instrument response function IRF (eqn (1)) to acquire the corresponding fractional amplitudes Ai (1)where IPL, t, and τi are the time-dependent PL intensity, delay time, and time constant, respectively. The amplitude-averaged lifetimes () of PL decays derived using eqn (2) are listed in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†) (2)The values of  at various PL wavelengths are displayed in Fig. 2c. It is easy to perceive that each molecule features a gradually increased value of  along with the red-shifting of PL wavelengths, up to a constant value at a certain long wavelength. This non-changing value of  for each molecule is considered to be the corresponding de-excitation time constants of the first equilibrium excited singlet state (Seq1). It is noted that due to the narrowed HOMO/LUMO energy gap, the introduction of ancillary electron-donor carbazole and electron-acceptor EBTBA will engender a shorter lifetime of Seq1 (7.2 ns for PC, 5.0 ns for C-PC, 3.2 ns for HW-1, and 2.5 ns for HW-3).

In PL measurements, the excitation wavelength for electron donors and dyes was at 380 nm and 490 nm, respectively. (b) Normalized kinetic traces (scatter dots) of HW-3 in THF (50 μM) at the PL wavelengths of 560 nm (blue), 700 nm (green), and 900 nm (red). The solid fitting lines were obtained using the eqn (1). Excitation wavelength: 490 nm. (c) Scatter plots of average time constants () at a series PL wavelengths for PC, C-PC, HW-1, and HW-3 in THF. 
In essence, the integral of time-resolved PL trace at a given wavelength (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†) should be proportional to the counts of emitting photons at the corresponding wavelength in the stationary PL spectroscopies (Fig. 2a). Hence, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of these molecules were reconstructed as illustrated in Fig. 3a–d. Using the free Glotaran software42 we can derive the evolution associated PL (EAPL) spectra as depicted in Fig. 3e–h, which indicate the occurrence of dynamic Stokes shifts for all the molecules. An auxiliary experiment based on more diluted solutions has revealed an immobile normalized PL kinetics, which rules out the fact that the dynamic Stokes shift is related to the presence of excimers and high-level aggregates. This scenario could be elucidated by the following picture according to the Franck–Condon principle: in general, the photo-generated excited states (Svert1) of molecules are initially in their ground state conformation (S0). The molecular conformation of Svert1 will relax towards a new equilibrium state geometry (Seq1) by stepwise vibrational and torsional motions.43–46 These relaxations will enable significant conformational diversity between S0 and Seq1 as demonstrated by the theoretical simulation (Fig. S5, ESI†). As a result of the large energy losses, we can observe the slow rising of kinetic traces (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†) and negative amplitudes of the small time constants (Tables S1–S4, ESI†) at a low-energy PL wavelength. The challenge of retaining a long excited state lifetime and avoiding a large structure relaxation of the excited state needs to be well addressed in the future design of a narrow energy gap organic dye.

In panels e–h, the time constants of spectral evolution were included, and the solid lines were obtained via the log-normal function. 
Furthermore, we recorded the stationary UV-Vis and PL spectra (Fig. 4a) as well as dynamic PL traces (Fig. S6–S9, ESI†) of dye-grafted alumina and titania in contact with an ionic liquid electrolyte (for the detailed recipe, see the Experimental section). For both dyes, the adjustment of the oxide matrix from alumina to titania leads to a blue-shifted PL peak, which could be understood as the existence of partial electron injection from the non-equilibrium excited states to titania. In addition, HW-3 displays a red-shifted peak with respect to HW-1 either on the alumina or titania surface, in good agreement with the variation tendency of dye solutions (Fig. 2a). All the dye-coated oxide films show the wavelength-dependent PL kinetics similar to those in solutions. As Fig. 4b shows, PL traces of HW-3 grafted titania films at three selected wavelengths of 560 nm, 720 nm, and 900 nm are significantly contrasting. Using the aforementioned protocols for the solution samples, the PL traces of dye-grafted oxide films were globally fitted and the  values of PL decays were further calculated as depicted in Fig. 4c. It is noteworthy that the  values of all the dye-coated oxide films present a similar trend of variation to the dye solutions along with the red-shifting of PL wavelengths. The derived Seq1 lifetimes of HW-1 and HW-3 grafted alumina are 1.5 ns and 1.1 ns, respectively, which are shorter than the corresponding solution counterparts (3.2 ns for HW-1 and 2.5 ns for HW-3). One may argue that the shortened lifetime is caused by the intermolecular interaction of dye molecules grafted on alumina. From another point of view, the high dielectric environment endowed with alumina and ionic liquids could also result in a reduction of excited state lifetime. Dynamic Stokes shifts can be clearly observed for dye grafted oxide films from the reconstructed TRPL and EAPL depicted in Fig. 5, suggesting that intramolecular torsional relaxation, intermolecular energy transfer, and/or intermolecular exciton generation probably take place in the self-organized dye layers on the surfaces of oxide films.

All films were immersed in an ionic liquid electrolyte. The solid lines in panels e–h were obtained via the log-normal function. Time constants of spectral evolution were also included. 
The dynamic quenching yields (QYD) at a series of PL wavelengths can been obtained using the following equation: (3)where (T,λ) and (A,λ) stand for the wavelength dependent amplitude-averaged PL lifetimes of dyes on titania and alumina, respectively. Both these two dyes possess lower QYD values in high-energy excited states as depicted in Fig. 6a, which can be ascribed to the occurrence of competitive transformation from the high-energy excited states to the low-energy excited states during electron injection. When compared to HW-1 in the low-energy excited states, the relative higher PL quenching yield of HW-3 indicates a relative higher electron injection yield (ϕei). Furthermore, the time constant of electron injection (ei) can been obtained from the following expression: (4)
 Fig. 6  (a) Plots of dynamic PL quenching yields (QYD, symbols) as a function of PL wavelengths for HW-1 (blue) and HW-3 (red). (b) Plots of time constants of electron injection (ei) as a function of PL wavelengths. The solid lines are also displayed as a guide to the eyes. 
The exciton energy dependent ei values of HW-1 and HW-3 are collected in Fig. 6b. Over one order of magnitude augmentation of ei can be observed along with a decrease of PL energy from ∼2.1 eV to 1.5 eV. It is easy to discover that the ei values are very distributional, which originates from the wide energy profile of excited states. The values of ei in the Seq1 state are unalterable, being 52 ps and 23 ps for HW-1 and HW-3, respectively. Considering the higher HOMO energy level of HW-3 with respect to HW-1, the excited state free energy of HW-3 should be higher than that of HW-1 if it emits the same energy photons. Thus, it is reasonable to perceive a distinctly smaller value of ei for HW-3 at a certain PL energy, probably owing to the enlargement of driving force of electron injection.
Subsequently, we resorted to a nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectrometer47–49 to evaluate related interfacial charge transfer reactions of the photo-oxidized dye molecules (D+) with electrons in the titania and iodide anions in the ionic liquid electrolyte. The half lifetimes (1/2) of charge recombination between photo-injected electrons in TiO2 and D+ can be extracted by recording the nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) traces (Fig. 7a and b) of dye-coated TiO2 films in conjunction with an inert electrolyte made from 0.5 M N-butylbenzoimidazole (NBB) in EMITFSI. It is worth noting that the introduction of an ancillary electron-donor induces a twice longer 1/2 from 0.24 ms to 0.48 ms, which could be interpreted by a larger distance of positive charges on dyes relative to electrons in titania. On the other hand, the incorporation of the iodine based ionic liquid electrolyte results in a remarkable acceleration of absorption decays (Fig. 7c and d), indicating the occurrence of efficient hole injection from D+ to iodide anions. With respect to HW-1, an obvious elongation of 1/2 for HW-3 may result from a reduction of driving force owing to the destabilized HOMO energy level.

The excitation wavelength was selected according to a 0.5 optical density of dye-grafted titania films to yield an alike distribution profile of vertically excited states in our testing samples. Excitation wavelength: 591 nm for HW-1 and 629 nm for HW-3. Pulse fluence: 20 μJ cm−2. Probe wavelength: 785 nm. Multi-exponential fittings are shown as solid gray lines. 
A bilayer porous titania film deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass via screen printing and thermal heating was used to fabricate a DSC in conjunction with an iodine-based ionic liquid electrolyte. For electrolyte composition and manufacture details, see the Experimental section. With the irradiance of white light bias (∼10 mW cm−2), the EQEs in the short-circuit of DSCs based on these two dyes were measured by changing monochromatic light at a wavelength interval of 10 nm. As presented in Fig. 8a, the HW-3 based cell features a red-shifted EQE response in comparison with the HW-1 counterpart. This is closely associated with the narrower optical energy gap of HW-3, which brings forth an augmented light absorption at a desirable longer wavelength (Fig. 8b). In addition, the HW-3 cell exhibits a larger EQE peak value of 86% compared with 79% for HW-1, which can be attributed to the higher QYD (Fig. 6a) and the longer electron diffusion length (Fig. S10, ESI†). Furthermore, we carried out the measurement of photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight to inspect the performance of DSCs. The photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table 1. Dye HW-1 exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 10.60 mA cm−2, a VOC of 644 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 76.1%, yielding a PCE of 5.1%. Dye HW-3 with an alkylated carbazole ancillary electron-donor owns an enhanced JSC of 13.40 mA cm−2 concomitant with a significantly improved VOC of 736 mV, leading to a good PCE of 7.1% for DSCs made with an ionic liquid electrolyte. Furthermore, we further recorded J–V characteristics at different light intensities and plotted VOC as a logarithmic function of JSC as depicted in Fig. 8d, illustrating that the HW-3 dye has an ∼85 mV improved VOC at a certain JSC with respect to HW-1.

Note that when the same redox electrolyte is applied for DSCs with different dyes, the variation of VOC is intrinsically associated with the shift of the electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) of TiO2. EF,n can vary along with a movable conduction-band edge (Ec) and/or a differential electron density of TiO2.18,50 Therefore, the charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage decay (TPD) experiments51,52 were executed to elucidate the origins of the VOC difference for HW-1 and HW-3. As illustrated in Fig. 8e, the TiO2 layer of the HW-1 and HW-3 cells stores the same charges (QCE) at a fixed VOC, suggesting an unchanged Ec. Compared with HW-1, the aforesaid enhancement of VOC for HW-3 is primarily relevant to the reduction of interfacial charge recombination as presented in Fig. 8f, displaying over one order of magnitude longer half lifetime (τTPD1/2) at a certain QCE.
The stability tests of these two cells with HW-1 and HW-3 were performed by continuously irradiating at 60 °C under a Suntest CPS plus lamp (ATLAS GmbH, 100 mW cm−2). A 50 μm thick layer of the polyester film (Preservation Equipment Ltd, UK) was used as a UV cutoff filter (up to 400 nm). The photovoltaic parameters after aging are also listed in Table 1. Note that the measurements of photovoltaic parameters of these aged cells were performed at room temperature after equilibration, and the aged cells were soaked under visible light (AM1.5G) for half an hour before the test. As listed in Table 1, the cells with HW-1 and HW-3 both possess a good stability during 1000 h of aging under the dual pressure of visible light soaking and heating (Fig. S11, ESI†), preserving over 80% of their initial PCEs (91% for the HW-1 cell and 83% for the HW-3 cell). The PCE degradations of these two cells result from the drops of VOC and JSC, albeit an improved fill factor. The drops of VOC for these two cells can be ascribed to the downward shift of Ec of titania and accelerated interfacial charge recombination (Fig. S12, ESI†), the latter of which is related to the dye desorption as demonstrated by LHE measurements (Fig. S13, ESI†). The JSC drops of these two cells are mainly caused by the dye desorption and the shortened electron diffusion length (Fig. S10, ESI†), leading to lower EQEs in the whole spectral response region (Fig. S13, ESI†).
Conclusions
In summary, we have studied the influences of introducing an ancillary electron-donor (alkylated carbazole) on the dynamics of excited states and charge carriers on a wide time domain from femtoseconds to milliseconds. Time-resolved PL measurements have demonstrated that conjugating carbazyl to the free end of PC can bring forth a shorter lifetime of the equilibrium excited state in both the THF solution and the porous oxide matrix, without reducing the electron injection yield at the titania/dye interface because of faster electron injection kinetics. Moreover, non-equilibrium excited states present lower electron injection yields with respect to the equilibrium excited state, owing to the occurrence of competitive relaxation from the high-energy excited states to low-energy excited states. In addition, our time-resolved PL measurements have also disclosed the existence of dynamic Stokes shifts for these two dyes both dissolved in THF and grafted on the porous oxide film surface, indicating that there are stepwise intramolecular relaxations. Our work has underlined the crucial impact of excited state and charge carrier dynamics on the photovoltaic parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells, which should be seriously considered in the further dye design.
Experimental section
Materials
THF, ethanol, chloroform, EMITFSI, guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMITCB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 1,3-Dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII),53 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (EMII),53N-butylbenzimidazole (NBB),54 HW-1,33 and HW-333 were prepared according to the preceding literature procedures.
Theoretical calculations
We adopted the 6-311G(d,p) basis set in the Gaussian 09 software package for quantum calculations. We resorted to the conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM) for the modeling of solvent effects. We utilized the popular B3LYP exchange–correlation functional to optimize the ground-state geometries.55,56 For the vertical electron transitions and excited-state geometries, we employed the TD-MPW1K hybrid functional, which is characteristic of 42% of Hartree–Fock exchange.57,58
Photophysical measurements
UV-Vis spectroscopy was carried out using a G1103A spectrometer (Agilent). Steady-state PL spectra were recorded using a SpectraSuite Spectrometer (Ocean Optics). TCSPC experiments were carried out on a LifeSpec-II spectrometer, employing an EPL485 pulsed laser diode and a Hamamatsu H5773-04 photomultiplier. The particulars of ultrafast PL measurements were outlined in our preceding paper.59 In brief, the 130 fs, 800 nm pulses generated from a regenerative amplifier (Spitfire, Spectra Physics) were split into two beams with an energy ratio of 9/1. The major beam was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C, Light Conversion) to generate excitation light at 490 nm. Both the light transmitted from a rotatory sample and the minor beam from Spitfire were focused on a 0.3 mm-thick BBO crystal to afford a sum frequency light. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurements were carried out using an LP920 laser flash spectrometer. The probe light at 785 nm emitted from a LDM 785 laser diode module (Thorlabs Corp.) passed through the testing samples and was then recorded using a silicon detector (PDA10A-EC).
Cell fabrication and measurements
We deposited a bilayer titania film on FTO glass (NSG, Solar) via screen-printing and used it as a negative electrode of a DSC. The bilayer film owns a 5.0 μm-thick mesoporous layer composed of small anatase particles (25 nm), apart from a 5.0 μm-thick macroporous layer composed of large anatase particles (350–450 nm). The details of film preparation were described in a previous paper.60 Dye-loading was done by dipping a titania film in a dye solution overnight. The 150 μM dye solution was formulated by dissolving dye powder in a solvent mixture of chloroform and ethanol at a volume ratio of 1/1. We utilized a Surlyn O-ring (thickness, 25 μm) for the sticking of a dyed titania electrode to a platinized FTO electrode, at 125 °C under a small mechanical pressure. The ionic liquid electrolyte is composed of DMII, EMIII, EMITCB, iodine, NBB, and GNCS at a molar ratio of 12/12/16/1.67/3.33/0.67. Electrical measurements (EQE, J–V, CE, TPD, and impedance spectroscopy) were performed as reported in our previous papers.61,62

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the herein studied two EBTBA (orange) dyes, HW-1 and HW-3 reported in ref. 33. EBTBA is used as an electron-acceptor of D–A dyes and R is the substituent of 2-hexyldecyl. HW-1 utilizes a single electron-releasing unit N-annulated perylene (PC, green), while HW-3 employs a binary electron-releasing moiety, carbazole-PC (C-PC, magenta). The bond in cyan can be imagined as formed via oxidative coupling of an electron-donor and an electron-acceptor by dehydrogenation.
