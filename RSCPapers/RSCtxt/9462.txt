    , Accepted 28th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractHerein, we investigate the role of Eu3+ doping on CH3NH3PbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) in terms of their optoelectronic properties and photodetection application through a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The introduction of EuCl3 in the CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal structure by a facile solvothermal method enabled the tuning of the lateral and vertical dimensions of the NSs to form large-area NPLs and finally monolayer nanocrystals. The appearance of low-angle diffraction peaks with Eu doping, which are observed in layered perovskite structures, confirms the formation of quasi-2D NPLs. The bandgap of the Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite systematically increases from 2.39 eV to 2.94 eV with increasing doping concentration. Interestingly, 10 mol% EuCl3 doping in the pure CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal dramatically enhances its absorbance and photosensitivity, resulting in high-performance photodetection. Under 405 nm excitation, the CH3NH3Pb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector exhibits self-biased behavior with an on/off ratio >103, which is very significant. The planar device achieves a responsivity as high as 5.29 A W− and a detectivity of 1.06 × 1012 Jones under 405 nm with a power density of 0.14 mW cm−2 at 5 V. In addition, the device exhibits very fast response time with a rise/fall time of 17.5/38.5 μs, which is ∼4 times faster than the pristine CH3NH3PbBr3 counterpart. A linear relationship of photocurrent with light intensity in the CH3NH3Pb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector signifies low recombination or charge trapping loss. High-performance photodetection in the Eu-doped device is ascribed to the elimination of trap states and the fast charge transfer process. To obtain better insight into the doped system, DFT analysis of the electronic structure of EuCl3-doped CH3NH3PbBr3 was performed and the results are fully consistent with the experimental findings. It was revealed that EuCl3 doping increases the density of states near the conduction band along with a blue shift in the bandgap as compared to that of the pristine perovskite, which in turn increases the built-in potential of the fabricated device, resulting in self-biased photodetection. This work paves the way for deeper understanding of lanthanide doping in perovskites and self-biased photodetection applications of a new family of Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite nanostructures.
1. Introduction
Recently, metal halide perovskite nanomaterials have sprung to the forefront of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices due to their extraordinary characteristics that permit their use in diverse applications.1–14 Typically, their characteristics such as large absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, and high carrier mobility make them perfect candidates for photovoltaic application, whereas properties such as their high exciton binding energy, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), and wide color gamut are very appealing for light-emitting diodes and laser applications.15–24 Interestingly, the properties of perovskite materials can be tuned based on the application.
Despite possessing many appealing features, the commercialization of perovskite-based devices is facing many roadblocks due to their toxicity, low ambient stability, and low photo and temperature stability.25 This has triggered research into finding a suitable replacement of lead (Pb) while keeping all the interesting features of pure perovskite crystals. Doping is an effective method to introduce impurities in the pure perovskite crystal to tune and enhance its features. Although early research has mostly focused on replacing Pb with its neighboring elements in the periodic table, such as Bi, Sn, and Sb, these dopant elements destabilize the perovskite structure and reduce its stability and performance compared to those of pure perovskite crystals.26–30 In contrast, doping of lanthanide elements as the Pb substitution in the perovskite crystal is comparatively less explored and only in recent times, it is attracting a great deal of attention. Lanthanide materials can reportedly fine-tune the electronic, optical and chemical properties of the pristine perovskite and the 4f electrons of lanthanides enrich the band-edge states, which are the primary sources for the enhancement of luminescence properties of the host crystal.31,32 Although the emission property of lanthanide doped perovskite crystal is studied, the effect of lanthanide ions on the photovoltaic and photodetection properties of the perovskite crystal is less explored.33 A few groups have reported the impact of lanthanide elements on the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite. Lanthanide materials are reported to increase the grain size of the perovskite film, thereby increasing the carrier lifetime and efficiency of solar cells.34 In addition, the stability of the solar cell was significantly improved with the introduction of lanthanide materials.34 Wang et al. reported a Nd3+ doped CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3, MA = CH3NH3) planar heterojunction solar cell with improved charge carrier mobility, reduced trap states, and prolonged carrier lifetime.35 Eu3+/2+ ions were also reported to eliminate Pb0 and I0 defects in CsPbI3 perovskite devices, which in turn increased the solar cell efficiency.36 Zhou et al. improved the power conversion efficiency of a Si solar cell from 18.1% to 21.5% by coating the device with a Yb3+ and Ce3+ codoped CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 nanocrystal (NC) layer using the quantum cutting technique.37 Wu et al. achieved a power conversion efficiency of 16.7% by inserting a low doping ratio of 0.04% EuI2 as the dopant in MAPbI3.38 The power conversion efficiency of the CsPbBr3 solar cell was enhanced from 5.66% to 7.28% by optimizing the doping concentration of Eu ions.39 The Eu(Ac)3 doped CsPbI2Br perovskite is reported to give a high-quality inorganic perovskite film with a low defect density, long carrier lifetime and high efficiency of 15.25%.40 Xiang and coworkers demonstrated a maximum power-conversion efficiency of 13.71% for an inorganic perovskite solar cell with the CsPb0.95Eu0.05I2Br perovskite and a stable power output of 13.34%.41 Based on the above reports, europium appears to be an efficient sensitizer in the perovskite solar cells since it decreases the non-radiative recombination, which in turn increases the open-circuit voltage.
On the other hand, engineering of excitonic luminescence was achieved for Eu3+-doped CsPbCl3−xBrx NCs for the first time by Dai et al.42 Eu2+ recently served as a suitable replacement of Pb2+ in all-inorganic perovskite, and CsEuBr3 NCs were synthesized using a hot-injection method, exhibiting a narrow PL peak at 413 nm with a PLQY of 39%.43 Single-crystalline CsEuCl3 nanocrystals with a uniform size distribution centered around 15 nm were also synthesized, although the PL QY at room temperature was very low (∼2%).44 Rare-earth cation (Tb3+ and Eu3+)-doped CsPbBr3 quantum dot (QD) glass with tunable luminescence had been synthesized by conventional melt-quenching methods for the fabrication of white LED.45 Eu3+-doped lead-free Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite QDs were employed as a highly sensitive fluorescent probe for Cu2+ ion detection in water.46 Hence, europium doping in perovskite crystal not only tunes its optical properties but also improves the structural and photovoltaic performance. To the best of our knowledge, impact of lanthanide material on the photodetection performance of MAPbBr3-based devices is not studied yet, and most of the Eu doping studies were reported on all-inorganic perovskites.
Here, we have studied the effect of Eu3+ ions on the structural and optical properties of solvothermally synthesized MAPbBr3 nanosheets (NSs)/nanoplatelets (NPLs) and further fabricated an Eu-doped 2D mixed halide perovskite-based photodetector with high performance. Variation in thickness and size of the perovskite NPL with increasing Eu doping concentration is studied using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging. Interestingly, the bandgap is also tuned by varying the Eu concentration, which is analyzed using optical absorbance and PL analyses. Finally, we have performed a comparative study of the EuCl3 doped MAPbBr3 and pristine MAPbBr3 photodetectors and showed that Eu doping enables high performance photodetection in the hybrid perovskites. To unravel the mechanism of improved photodetection in Eu-doped perovskite, we performed DFT calculation of the electronic structure of the doped system and the conclusions from the DFT analysis are found to be fully consistent with the experimental data.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials
The materials, which were used to synthesize the undoped and doped perovskite, are methylamine solution (CH3NH3, 33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrobromic acid (HBr, 48 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99%, Sigma-Aldrich), diethyl ether (>99%, Merck), toluene (Merk), oleic acid (CH3(CH2)7CHCH(CH2)7COOH, Merk), oleylamine (OAm) (≥98% (primary amine), Sigma-Aldrich), and europium(III) chloride (EuCl3, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich). All the materials were used as received without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis procedures

2.2.1. Synthesis of CH3NH3Br. 
First, the organic part of the hybrid perovskite was synthesized by diluting the 8 mL of CH3NH3 solution with 20 mL of absolute ethanol with stirring in a round-bottom flask. Then, 3 mL HBr was slowly added to the previous solution in an ice bath with vigorous stirring at 1400 rpm for two hours. The solution was then heated at 70 °C for several hours to evaporate the solvents. The remaining CH3NH3Br (MABr) salt was washed several times with ethanol to remove the impurities from the dry salt. Then, the powder was washed with anhydrous diethyl ether to recrystallize and finally, the powder was dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 hours.


2.2.2. Synthesis of undoped and Eu-doped perovskite NPL. 
The undoped and doped MAPbBr3 NPL were synthesized by a solvothermal method.47 First, equal moles of MABr and PbBr2 were dry mixed, and then to make the solution, 1 ml DMF, oleic acid, and 60 μl OAm were added. Afterward the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave without any pretreatment and solvothermally treated at 120° C for 30 min. Post the solvothermal process, the autoclave was allowed to cool down naturally for 30 min. Then 80 μl of the product solution was added into 10 ml toluene during vigorous stirring. To wash the as-prepared NPL and separate it from the crude solution, the solution was centrifuged two times at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded each time, and the precipitate was redispersed in 6 ml toluene for further characterization. Note that all the synthesis procedures were carried out in an ambient environment without the use of a glove box to verify the environmental stability of the 2D NPL.
To synthesize the Eu-doped 2D mixed halide perovskite NPL, different amounts of PbBr2 were replaced by EuCl3 according to the desired doping concentrations. Typically, for 10 mol% doping concentration of EuCl3, 0.1 mM MABr, 0.01 mM EuCl3, and (0.1–0.01) = 0.09 mM PbBr2 were first mixed and afterward the same solvothermal procedure was followed, as discussed above. We varied the concentrations of EuCl3 from 0 to a maximum of 60 mol%. The 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mol% EuCl3 doped samples are named Eu0, Eu10, Eu20, Eu30, Eu40, and Eu60, respectively.


2.2.3. Fabrication of photodetectors. 
We fabricated planar type photodetectors using the undoped and doped NPLs. To fabricate the photodetector, first the Si/SiO2 substrate was cleaned by ultra-sonication using water, acetone and 2-propanol sequentially for 15 min each. It was cleaned with water again, followed by heating at 180 °C to remove the impurities. Further, to ensure complete removal of residue, the substrate was UV-ozone treated for 20 min. We have first deposited the gold (Au) contacts/electrodes on the substrate and then the perovskite solution to avoid the sample degradation while depositing the contacts. The Au electrodes were deposited on the wafers using the shadow masks using the vacuum thermal evaporation method. Then, the undoped and doped 2D NS were drop cast on each wafer and annealed at 60 °C.

2.3. Characterization techniques
The high magnification surface morphology and thickness of the undoped and Eu-doped perovskite NPLs have been characterized using a field-effect TEM (JEOL-JEM 2010) operated at 200 kV and AFM (Cypher, Oxford Instruments). X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku RINT 2500 TRAX-III, Cu-Kα radiation) patterns were recorded to determine the crystal structure of different samples. UV–Vis absorption spectra of the MAPbBr3 NSs were measured using a commercial spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Lamda 950). The room temperature steady-state PL spectra were recorded under 350 nm lamp excitation using a commercial fluorimeter (Fluoromax-4, Horiba Scientific). Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements were performed using 375 nm pulsed laser excitation for perovskite NSs, with an instrument response time of <50 ps (LifeSpecII, Edinburgh Instruments). The photodetector measurement was taken using an in house built setup consisting of a microprobe station (Ecopia, Korea), a 405 nm diode laser, a source meter (Keithley 2400, Germany), a pulse generator (Agilent), and a digital oscilloscope (Agilent). The spectral response was measured using a 150 W Xe lamp (Newport, USA), a monochromator (Newport, USA), and a power meter (Newport, USA).
2.4. Computational methodology
We investigated the effects of Eu and EuCl3 doping on the electronic structures of MAPbBr3 nanocrystals using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. To this end, we first optimized the pristine MAPbBr3 in its cubic phase. To see the impact of Eu3+ doping, we took a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of MAPbBr3 and replaced one Pb atom by one Eu atom and three Br atoms by three Cl atoms, which resulted in 12.5% doping. The optimized lattice parameters of the pristine and EuCl3 doped systems are 12.08 Å and 12.14 Å, respectively. We used the Density Functional Theory (DFT) based Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).48,49 A kinetic energy cut-off of 600 eV is used for all calculations. A Monkhorst–Pack grid of 8 × 8 × 8 and 4 × 4 × 4 k mesh is used for optimization of the unit-cell and 2 × 2 × 2 supercell. We considered spin–orbit coupling to calculate the electronic structure of the pristine 2 × 2 × 2 and doped 2 × 2 × 2 systems with a 6 × 6 × 6 k mesh.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structural analysis

3.1.1. FETEM analysis. 
To understand the effect of Eu doping on the morphology of the mixed halide perovskite, TEM images were recorded (see Fig. 1). A large area NS of dimension ∼361 × 334 nm is observed in the undoped pristine MAPbBr3 perovskite (Eu0), as shown in Fig. 1(a). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) lattice fringe pattern for Eu0 is shown in Fig. 1(b) and the corresponding inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) image is presented in the inset. The measured interplanar spacing for Eu0 is found to be ∼0.51 nm corresponding to the (001) plane (see Fig. 1(b)). For 10 mol% Eu doping in the MAPbBr3 perovskite (Eu10), the lateral size of the NS decreases from ∼361 × 334 nm to ∼207 nm × 218 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The interplanar spacing of Eu10 as seen in the HRTEM image is found to be ∼0.31 nm and the corresponding IFFT image is shown in the inset of Fig. 1(d). From the light contrast of the TEM image of Eu10, it can be understood that the thickness of the NS is decreased in Eu10 compared to the undoped one. The TEM image of Eu30 is shown in Fig. 1(e), revealing the nanocrystal (NC) decorated NPL of lateral size ∼189 nm × 188 nm. The HRTEM image of Eu30 with a lattice spacing of ∼0.31 nm is shown in Fig. 1(f) and the corresponding IFFT image is shown in the inset. A further increase in EuCl3 concentration to 40 mol% results in the complete transformation of the NS to NCs, as shown in Fig. 1(g). Fig. 1(h) and inset of Fig. 1(h) demonstrate the HRTEM and corresponding IFFT image of Eu40, showing a lattice spacing of ∼0.31 nm. The TEM image of Eu50 reveals the uniform distribution of NCs of average size ∼3.1 nm over a large area (see Fig. 1(i)). The inset of Fig. 1(i) shows the AFM image of NCs in Eu50, revealing the thickness of the NCs to be ∼0.65 nm corresponding to the monolayer thickness since the unit cell size of the MAPbBr3 is ∼5.93 Å. The HRTEM image of NCs in Eu50 is shown in Fig. 1(j), and the corresponding IFFT image is shown in the inset, revealing a lattice spacing of ∼0.31 nm. The decrease in lattice spacing with Eu3+ doping in the host MAPbBr3 lattice is attributed to lattice contraction due to the partial replacement of Pb2+ (1.33 Å) and Br by smaller size Eu3+ (0.107 Å) and Cl ions. Direct quantification of decrease in NPL thickness was understood using AFM topography images. Fig. S1(a) (ESI†) shows the AFM topography image of undoped NS (Eu0) and the thickness of the marked NPL is found to be ∼6.4 nm (10 layer) as represented in the height profile in Fig. S1(b) (ESI).† With EuCl3 doping, the thickness of the NPL decreases to 4.9 nm (8 layer) and 2.7 nm (5 layer) for Eu10 and Eu30, respectively. Fig. S2(a) (ESI)† shows the FESEM image of Eu10 and the area on which the elemental mapping was taken is marked with a square box. Fig. S2(b) (ESI)† shows the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum of Eu10, revealing the atomic ratio of Eu/Pb to be 0.0196 (1.96%), which confirms successful substitution of Pb2+ by Eu3+ to form mixed halide Eu-doped NPL. The elemental mapping of Eu10 is shown in Fig. S2(c–h) (ESI),† revealing uniform distribution of all the elements including the Eu in the sample. The EDX spectrum of 30 mol% EuCl3 doped MAPbBr3 NPL revealed an Eu/Pb atomic ratio of 5.6%, indicating an increase in Eu concentration (Fig. S3 (ESI)†). However, it can be observed that the experimentally observed dopant concentration is relatively low compared to the theoretical concentration, which is consistent with the previously reported values.11,50 During the solvothermal synthesis procedure, the dopant may also act as a solvent and increase the reactivity of the ligands, promoting the exfoliation of the NS/NPL layer along the vertical direction.47 This gives rise to thinner NPL with increasing doping concentration and finally the disintegration of NPL to NCs. Thus, most of the dopants may stay in interstitial sites rather than entering into the host crystal.

3.2. Structural analysis
XRD patterns for MAPbBr3 NPL doped with different concentrations of EuCl3 were studied to understand the doping effect in the perovskite crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 2(a). XRD patterns of undoped NS reveal the cubic structure of the perovskite with the diffraction peak at 14.78° assigned to (001). After the incorporation of Eu3+ ions in MAPbBr3, the characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the layered structure were observed below 14.78° which generally occurs in layered 2D samples due to the increase in the d-spacing as a result of decrease in the thickness of the NPL. The peaks at 6.77° and 9.02° corresponding to the (002l) (l = 1–6) plane become prominent in Eu-doped mixed halide 2D NPL due to the decrease in NPL thickness and the increase in the interplanar spacing owing to the presence of the dopant atoms in thinner NPLs.50,51 Jiang et al. ascribed the low-angle diffraction peaks to the typical (0k0) reflections from the layered structure associated with the d-spacing enhancement. It was stated that the low-angle peaks represent the unambiguous signatures of the layered structure, corresponding to the quasi-2D perovskites.52 Low angle diffraction peaks were also reported with Mn and lanthanide doping in low thickness CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 NPLs/NS.50,53 In the layered perovskite structure, the layer of corner sharing inorganic PbBr6 octahedra is arranged perfectly along the (100) direction in a 2D plane with organic cations in between.47,54 The peaks at 11.3° and 12.03° correspond to PbBr2 and it appears due to the layered structure since thin NPL comprises layers of corner-sharing PbBr6 octahedra. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak gradually decreases as the Eu doping concentration increases and finally disappears in Eu40, indicating exfoliation of the sheets from the cleavage (100) plane to form thinner NPLs. The diffraction peaks systematically shift towards higher angle with increasing Eu3+ concentration, indicating a slight decrease in interplanar spacing due to the replacement of Pb2+ by smaller size Eu3+ and decrease in radii of halide ions from Br to Cl in doped mixed halide NS. The absence of the (001) peak at higher doping concentration is ascribed to the formation of thinner NPLs.

3.3. Optical analysis
To understand the effect of doping on the optical properties of the perovskite NPL, first, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy was performed and the result is shown in Fig. 2(b). With increasing EuCl3 concentration, the first excitonic absorption peak is blue-shifted from 509 nm to 405 nm due to the thinning of the NPL that causes the quantum confinement effect (see Fig. 2(b)). Some excitonic features can be seen in the low wavelength region in low doping concentration samples due to the presence of NCs along with NPL. Fig. 2(c) shows the comparison of Tauc plot of Eu0, Eu10 and Eu40, revealing the respective bandgaps to be 2.39 eV, 2.42 eV and 2.89 eV, respectively. Similarly, the bandgap is calculated for all the samples and the bandgap is found to be tuned from 2.39 eV to 2.94 eV with Eu3+ doping in 2D perovskite NPL. Thus, Eu doping of MAPbBr3 NS makes the material more UV sensitized.
The steady state PL spectra are shown in Fig. 3(a), which reveal a marginal red shift in the peak wavelength with respect to the absorption edge for all the samples. This may be due to the Stokes shift caused by the presence of defects in the NPLs. Deconvolution of the PL spectrum (see Fig. S4(a)†) reveals three constituent peaks in the spectrum where peak 1, peak 2 and peak 3 correspond to NCs present along with NPLs, band-edge emission and defect states, respectively, which is consistent with the earlier report.47 Comparison of PL spectra for various doping concentrations is shown Fig. 3(a), revealing a systematic blue shift in excitonic PL peak from 515 nm to 412 nm with increasing EuCl3 doping concentration. A large blue shift for 40 mol% EuCl3 concentration is attributed to the strong quantum confinement effect due to the transformation of NPL to monolayer NCs. Replacement of Pb and Br by Eu and Cl, respectively, may also result in the lattice distortion, which gives rise to bandgap enlargement. Halide substitution of Br by Cl results in a change in valence state from 4p to 3p, giving rise to an increase in bandgap. The absence of characteristic Eu3+ (d–f) transition peaks in this system is attributed to the fact that Eu-5d does not contribute to the valence band of MAPbBr3 perovskite as it was observed in Eu-doped all-inorganic perovskite.42 Hence, the well-known 5d–4f rare-earth transition is not expected from Eu3+ in the MAPbBr3 host. The intensity of excitonic PL emission first increases with increasing Eu3+ doping concentration and then it approaches an optimum value for Eu30 and finally decreases at higher Eu3+ concentrations in Eu40, Eu50 and Eu60. An increase in PL intensity with Eu3+ doping is ascribed to improved crystallinity, suppression in defect states and non-radiative recombination. However, higher EuCl3 concentration leads to the substitution of the larger atomic radius Br by a smaller atomic radius Cl, and Eu ions may be trapped into the mixed halide perovskite lattice, inducing the decrease in Eu concentration in NCs.42 In addition, structural distortion due to higher doping concentration may also affect the emission properties due to the formation of mid-gap defect states. Higher doping concentration may introduce deep impurity levels which may increase the non-radiative recombination, resulting in the decrease in emission intensity. This kind of behavior was reported earlier in Eu3+ doped CsPbBr3 crystal.32

Time resolved PL spectra were examined to understand the charge recombination and extraction behavior of undoped and EuCl3 doped MAPbBr3 NPL, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The TRPL decay profiles of the samples were recorded by monitoring the emission at their respective PL peak positions. The TRPL spectra were fitted with the tri-exponential decay function given by , where Ai is the amplitude of the PL decay component corresponding to the lifetime τi. The average lifetimes (τavg) of the NSs are calculated using the following relation:  The details of the decay components are presented in Table S1 (ESI).† Based on the analysis of the steady state PL spectrum (Fig. S4†), the slower component of the decay function corresponds to radiative recombination i.e., band edge emission, while the faster components correspond to defect states and NCs which are present along with NPL. The average carrier lifetime is observed to be decreased from ∼124.03 ns to ∼9.77 ns with increasing Eu3+ doping concentration primarily due to the quantum confinement effect leading to efficient recombination. The contribution of faster components substantially increases with increasing doping concentration, which is attributed to the decrease in non-radiative recombination and defect states. Though PL emission intensity decreases at EuCl3 doping concentration higher than 30 mol%, the PL lifetime still gets faster owing to the substitution of the Br ion by the Cl ion.42 The lifetime becomes faster with the increase in bandgap, which is consistent with the literature.55 The decay time of several 100 ns is generally observed in MAPbI3 which is considered as a good candidate for photovoltaic applications. Hence, large lifetimes in Eu0 and Eu10 NS are attributed to long diffusion length.47,55 A slightly shorter carrier lifetime in Eu10 compared to that of the undoped MAPbBr3 NS is attributed to the faster charge transfer mechanism due to the increase in carrier mobility.56,57
The storage stability of the undoped and Eu-doped NPLs is studied by storing the samples under ambient conditions (∼65% humidity). The PL spectra of the undoped MAPbBr3 NPLs show ∼25% decay in the PL intensity in one month, as shown in Fig. 3(c). In contrast, the PL peak intensity of Eu10 is almost unchanged after storage for one month (Fig. 3(d)). However, higher doping concentration decreases the stability of the 2D NPL due to structural distortion. The PL intensity of Eu40 reduced to 15% within 15 days of storage as shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI).† Thus, the stability is increased in low doping concentration cases as it stabilizes the crystal structure. However, at high doping concentrations, very thin NPLs are formed which are vulnerable to ambient condition and more prone to join with each other to form thicker NPL. Therefore, the introduction of a small amount of EuCl3 (10 mol%) improves the structural stability of NPL, making it suitable for practical application. Higher stability in Eu10 is ascribed to an increase in tolerance factor and passivation of halide vacancy states.
3.4. Application of Eu-doped NS for photodetection
In order to characterize the effect of europium doping on the photophysical properties of perovskite, we have fabricated doped MAPb0.9Eu0.1Cl0.3Br2.7 and undoped perovskite-based photodetectors. Fig. 4(a) illustrates the schematic diagram of the perovskite photodetector where perovskite solution was deposited on top patterned Au contact with an inter electrode spacing of 70 μm, to avoid any degradation of perovskite during contact deposition and performance of the device was studied under 405 nm laser irradiation. The inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the optical microscope image of the Au patterned device. Fig. 4(b) shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the pristine MAPbBr3 NPL photodetector under dark and 405 nm excitation with a power density of 4.94 mW cm−2. The undoped MAPbBr3 photodetector does not show any measurable photocurrent under zero bias condition, even at high power density. The turn-on voltage of the undoped device is found to be −0.4 V. The I–V characteristics of the Eu0 photodetector exhibit nearly symmetric behavior, indicating the formation of back-to-back Schottky contact. Fig. S5 (ESI)† shows the comparison of I–V characteristics of Eu0, Eu10 and Eu40 photodetectors, revealing enhanced photocurrent in Eu-doped cases. Interestingly, the Eu10 photodetector shows much higher photocurrent than Eu0 and Eu40 due to better charge transfer/separation and fewer defects. Note that higher doping concentration results in the formation of monolayer NCs that gives rise to leakage in current due to the deep trap states and structural defect-related states. It was reported that low doping concentration improves the perovskite crystal tolerance-factor and reduces the electron trap density, which is consistent with our results.38,40Fig. 4(c) displays the I–V characteristics of Eu10 under dark and light conditions showing dramatic increases in photocurrent, especially under reverse bias due to superior charge separation and exceptional light–matter interaction in the crystal.58 The I–V curve of Eu10 exhibits asymmetric diode like rectifying behavior under illumination. Interestingly, high photocurrent under self-biased condition (zero bias) reveals a self-powered characteristic of Eu10, confirming stronger intrinsic charge separation in the Eu3+ doped mixed halide perovskite photodetector. Self-biased and asymmetric I–V behaviors, even under very low intensity, are responsible for the enhanced photodetection performance in the doped photodetector device.

Fig. 4(d) shows the temporal photoresponse of Eu0 and Eu10 under a bias voltage of −5 V and 405 nm laser excitation, exhibiting a dramatic enhancement (∼7 times) in photocurrent in the Eu-doped device compared to that of the undoped one. The presence of a small lead halide peak (∼12°) in the layered MAPb0.9Eu0.1Cl0.3Br2.7 structure is believed to be beneficial to passivate the defects and reduce the electron–hole recombination, resulting in high photocurrent.59 The Eu-doped mixed halide photodetector (Eu10) was illuminated with varying intensity of light at a fixed wavelength to understand the photosensitivity of the device at zero bias with the light on and off. The planar device without any heterojunction clearly shows intensity-dependent photocurrent even under self-biased condition, as shown in Fig. 5(a), which is significant. Increased photocurrent with increasing light intensity is produced by the amplified number of photogenerated carriers through the absorption of light. Even at a very low intensity, the Eu-doped device shows excellent sensitivity to the incident light and it swiftly changes from high to low resistance condition without much delay, demonstrating good photoconductive response. The photogenerated electron–hole pairs get sufficient energy under illumination to drift to the opposite contacts, leading to an increase in photocurrent. The self-biased behavior of the photodetector can be extremely beneficial for use in energy-efficient signal receiving devices since it can operate without any external power supply.60 The dependence of photocurrent of Eu10 on the intensity of the illuminated light is plotted on a logarithmic scale as shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a) and the data are fitted with the power law:47Iph = APθ, where Iph and P are the photocurrent and incident light power density, while A is the constant and θ determines the response of the photocurrent to light intensity. The fitting of the photocurrent vs. intensity graph of the doped MAPb0.9Eu0.1Cl0.3Br2.7 photodetector in the low power density region (0.11–0.24 mW cm−2) fits with exponent, θ = 1.4 indicating a highly linear relationship of photogenerated carriers and incident flux. Hence, in the low power density regions, most of the generated carriers are separated without any recombination loss.47 The linear fitting of the logarithmic plot of photocurrent of the undoped MAPbBr3 photodetector vs. intensity gives an exponent value of 0.7 (<1), implying that a large fraction of the photogenerated charge carriers is lost due to trapping and recombination (see Fig. S6(a) (ESI)†). Linear dynamic range (LDR) is calculated to quantitatively understand the sensitivity of the device with increasing intensity using the relation60, where  is the photocurrent measured at an intensity from which photocurrent starts to deviate from linearity. As the light intensity increases from 0 to 20.04 mW cm−2, the current in the Eu10 device increases from 1.12 × 10−10 A to 2.83 × 10−7 A under self-biased condition, resulting in a LDR of 68.05, which is significant.

The inset shows a logarithmic plot of the photocurrent vs. light intensity for Eu10 under zero bias. (b) Temporal photoresponse of Eu10 under various bias voltages with 405 nm laser irradiation; the inset shows the variation in photocurrent with bias voltage.

Fig. 5(b) shows the typical temporal response of the Eu10 based photodetector under light illumination (4.94 mW cm−2) and low bias voltages (−0.1 to −1 V). Note that the device exhibits excellent detectivity of light even at low bias voltage due to absence of trap states and efficient charge extraction. If a large number of trap states exist, the photogenerated electrons may get trapped in the defect states before they could reach the Au electrodes. When the defects are filled with doped ions, the electrons in the conduction band easily move towards electrodes without recombination, resulting in the enhancement of the photocurrent.58 The inset of Fig. 5(b) shows the variation in photocurrent with bias voltage, indicating a nearly exponential increase in photocurrent. The variation in the ratio of photo to dark current as a function of bias voltage is shown in Fig. S6(b) (ESI),† demonstrating a maximum value of ∼1.2 × 103 under the self-biased condition, which is comparable to other transport layer free devices under external bias.61,62 With increasing bias voltage, initially the photocurrent/dark current ratio decreases due to an increase in dark current; however, at higher bias voltage, it again increases since the device gets sufficient energy to extract the photogenerated charge carriers, giving rise to very high photocurrent (see Fig. S6(b) (ESI)†).
Note that the temporal response of the MAPb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector demonstrates a very fast sweep under dark to light condition, indicating rapid rise and fall time. Hence, to measure the ultrafast photoresponse of the device, a digital storage oscilloscope was used and the laser source was modulated up to 20 kHz using a function generator. High-resolution photoresponse curves of pristine MAPbBr3 and MAPb0.9Eu0.1Cl0.3Br2.7 photodetectors are shown in Fig. 5(c and d), respectively. To estimate the rise and fall times of the devices, the photoresponse curves are fitted with a single exponential function, given by Iph(t) = I0 + Aexp(−t)/τ, where Iph is the photocurrent, I0 and A are constants and τ is the time constant. From the fitted data, the rise and fall times of the undoped MAPbBr3 device are found to be 52.1 μs and 170.1 μs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(c). In contrast, the rise and fall times of the doped MAPb0.9Eu0.1Cl0.3Br2.7 photodetector are 17.5 μs and 38.5 μs, respectively, indicating high sensitivity of the device to detect high-frequency light signals (see Fig. 5(d)). Therefore, both the Eu-doped and undoped devices exhibit a sharp rise in photocurrent when light is switched on due to quick generation of light-induced carriers followed by the slow decay of photocurrent. However, photocurrent decay is much faster in the doped device. The rise and fall times are observed to be ∼3 times and ∼4.4 times faster in the doped device than in the undoped one due to efficient charge separation and passivation of trap states with the incorporation of lanthanide ions in the perovskite crystal.
It is well-known that the inclusion of moderate dopant concentration in the semiconductor increases the mobility of the carriers, space charge and electric field in the Schottky junction, allowing for efficient transfer of the charge carriers to the opposite electrodes.38 Here, the inclusion of 10 mol% of EuCl3 in the MAPbBr3 crystal increases the charge density and mobility of the carriers along with the reduction in the probability of trapping and de-trapping of photocarriers during their transfer, which is believed to contribute to the fast photoresponse of the device. However, at high Eu3+ doping concentration, the structural defect-related trap states contribute to the loss of the charge carriers. Also, at higher Eu3+ concentration, QD thickness was too thin to absorb sufficient photons to generate electron–hole pairs without any transport layers and most of the carriers are lost before they could reach the anodes. It is noteworthy that the present MAPb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector exhibits superior device performance without any charge-transporting layers compared to other p-i-n type perovskite devices reported earlier.63
The performance of the as-fabricated photodetector is analyzed by calculating the figures of merit of the device, such as responsivity and detectivity in the spectral range 300–800 nm under −5 V bias. The responsivity (R) of a device can be expressed by the following equation: R = ((Iph − Idark))/PA, where Iph and Idark are the photocurrent and dark current. P and A are the incident power density and the effective area of the device. Eu3+ doped mixed halide perovskite shows remarkable photosensitization in the wavelength range of UV to the visible region and shows relatively lower responsivity in the higher wavelength region similar to its absorption behavior, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Although responsivity decreases in the high wavelength region, it still shows a good sensitivity in this region. Hence, our doped device shows a typical flat response in the range of 300–540 nm. The MAPb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector shows a maximum responsivity of 5.02 A W−1 at 480 nm, whereas the responsivity of the undoped MAPbBr3 photodetector is found to be 1.13 A W−1 at 480 nm. Hence, the responsivity of the device is found to be increased by ∼4.4 times with the introduction of Eu3+ in the mixed halide perovskite lattice. The observed high responsivity in the UV-vis region of the Eu-doped device is associated with strong absorption by the sample. The detectivity (D) of the device is calculated using the following relation: D = R(A/(2qIdark))1/2, where q is the electronic charge. The variation of responsivity and detectivity of Eu10 with the intensity of 405 nm laser light is shown in Fig. 6(b). Interestingly, an extremely high responsivity of 5.29 A W−1 and detectivity of 1.06 × 1012 Jones are observed in Eu10 under 405 nm laser irradiation, at a low power density of 0.14 mW cm−2 and a bias voltage of −5 V. The responsivity and detectivity of the device are almost constant over the intensity range of 0.14–0.29 mW cm−2. A slight decrease in responsivity with increasing power density occurs due to a higher probability of scattering and recombination of photo-excited charge carriers under the influence of strong illumination.59 Based on the literature reports it is found that the present Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite photodetector exhibits superior performance in comparison to other perovskite-based devices of similar structure, as summarized in Table 1.

The operational stability and sustainability of the Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite photodetector are also studied to assess its efficacy in practical application. The photocurrent of the device is observed to be constant under zero bias condition even after continuous operation for 8 h, as shown in Fig. 6(c), demonstrating excellent photostability and long-term operational stability with good repeatability. Further, the storage stability of the device is also studied since ambient stability is a major issue for perovskite-based devices. The I–V characteristic curve of the Eu-doped device was almost unchanged after storing it for one month in a desiccator without any encapsulation, which may be due to passivation of Br vacancies by Cl and improved structural stability (see Fig. 6(d)). In contrast, a substantial decrease in photocurrent is observed in the I–V characteristic of the undoped MAPbBr3 photodetector after 7 days (see Fig. S7 (ESI)†). In general, interface degradation occurs fast in a perovskite device structure and intrinsic degradation of the active material affects the device slowly.3,59 Here, the enhanced structural stability by the inclusion of a small amount of Eu3+ in the 2D perovskite increases the overall structural stability of the doped device, which prevents the moisture ingress into the lattice. Thus, enhanced photo, operational and storage stability of the Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite photodetector signify its suitability for outdoor applications such as on windows, clothes and human skin.64
3.5. Electronic structure calculations
To develop a deeper understanding on the effect of doping on the structure and density of states of MAPbBr3 perovskite, we performed first principles electronic structure calculations of pristine and doped systems. The optimized crystal structures of the pristine MAPbBr3 perovskite and EuCl3 doped systems are shown in Fig. 7(a and b), respectively. Total energy calculations show that the doped system is energetically lower by 158 meV per atom, implying higher structural stability of the doped system, consistent with the experiment. Hence, only local lattice contraction is observed with Eu doping due to the comparable ionic radii of the Eu3+ (107 pm) and Pb2+ (119 pm). Thus, the doped system maintained a stable crystal structure similar to the undoped one. The total and partial densities of states of the systems are shown in Fig. 7(c and d), respectively. Analysis of the partial densities of states shows that for both pristine and doped systems, the organic units C, N, and H have substantial contributions in the energy regions far from the Fermi level, whereas Pb 6p and Br 4p electrons contribute to the states near the Fermi level in the doped system's conduction band (CB). Along with these two, Eu 4f, and Cl 4p electrons give rise to the states near the Fermi level in the CB for the doped system. We have not observed any contribution of well-known 4d–4f transition in the PL spectra of EuCl3 doped MAPbBr3 samples as Eu has almost negligible contribution in the valence band. Thus Eu 4f is hybridized with Pb 4p and Br 4p in the CB and substantially contributes to the enhancement of density of states and shifting of the CB towards the Fermi level.

In order to have a systematic understanding of the effects of doping, we also examined the effects of only Eu doping in MAPbBr3. In Fig. 8(a), the total densities of states for the pristine system, Eu-doped, and EuCl3 doped systems are compared. We found that the pristine system has a bandgap of 2.6 eV which is ∼0.21 eV larger than the experiment value. The bandgap of the EuCl3 doped system is increased to 2.9 eV without introducing extra dopant states which is ∼0.48 eV larger than the experimental values for Eu10. Minor disagreement in bandgap calculation is acceptable since DFT is known to under or overestimate the bandgap values of these systems.65 However, DFT analysis perfectly provides a qualitative understanding of the electronic structure of the doped and pristine systems. Experimentally, various factors such as lattice contraction and exciton binding energy contribute to the reduction in bandgap, which lower the increase in bandgap compared to the predicted theoretical value. The increase in bandgap (experimentally) is not only due to the doping, but also contributed by the quantum confinement effect due to the thinning of the NPL. To include all of these factors in DFT calculations is beyond the scope of this work. However, the increase in bandgap with Eu doping can be perfectly predicted from DFT calculations, matching well with the experimental findings. We found that the Eu 4f electrons gave rise to shallow transition bands near conduction band minima for the Eu-doped system (middle panel, Fig. 8(a)). These states in the bandgap region may act as new emissive channels similar to our previous work of Ce doping, which can be a good candidate for LED application but not appropriate for photodetector application.33 The densities of states of the EuCl3 doped system increase in the conduction band region (bottom panel, Fig. 8(a)) as compared to the pristine one. In Fig. 8(b), we show the variations of the function D(E)f(E) of the pristine and EuCl3 doped systems. The function D(E)f(E) provides a crude qualitative estimate of the carrier concentration. Fig. 8(b) provides the variations in D(E)f(E) for both systems at 0 K and 300 K. The inset of Fig. 8(b) shows that the pristine one has a small peak at Fermi energy at 0 K which broadens at 300 K. In addition to this, at 300 K, the doped system shows a broadened peak in the conduction band region, inferring easy charge transport and exciton dissociation compared to pristine perovskite where the electrons are more localized. From these, we can also infer that the total electron density increases in the conduction band region after EuCl3 doping in MAPbBr3, which supports the better photodetector performance in the Eu10 system. An increase in total density of states increases the carrier concentration, which in turn increases the built-in potential of the Schottky barrier in the case of the Eu-doped photodetector.

In the case of the semiconductor p–n junction, the built-in voltage (Vbi) is proportional to dopant concentration with the relation66  where k, T, q, NA, ND and ni are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, charge, acceptor impurities, donor impurities and intrinsic carrier concentration, respectively. The metal–semiconductor junction/Schottky diode is a kind of one-sided junction, where the depletion region extends mainly in the semiconductor side and band bending in the semiconductor decides the efficiency of charge separation. In the present case, i.e. doped perovskite layer, due to higher electron density the built-in potential/band bending is higher and this results in more efficient charge separation than the undoped case. Thus, the higher photocurrent and high responsivity of the Eu10 based photodetector are due to the higher built-in potential and improved charge separation. Thus, our DFT analysis is fully consistent with the experimental results as it could perfectly predict the increase in bandgap and improved photodetection performance of EuCl3 doped perovskite as compared to pristine MAPbBr3 perovskite NS.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully developed Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite NPLs using a solvothermal route and expanded the family of doped perovskites for high quality photodetection application. Inclusion of Eu3+ ions in the MAPbBr3 perovskite crystal tuned the lateral size and thickness of the NPL and at 60 mol% EuCl3 concentration monolayer mixed halide perovskite NCs are obtained. Post Eu doping, characteristic 2D diffraction peaks at low angles are observed due to the increase in interplanar spacing with the formation of a thin layered structure. Lattice contraction with increasing doping concentration indicates partial substitution of Pb and Br ions by Eu and Cl ions, respectively. The PL peak and excitonic absorption peak are systematically blue shifted with increasing Eu doping concentration partly due to the quantum confinement effect. Further, we have fabricated a photodetector using MAPb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 by taking advantage of high absorbance and improved optical properties. Interestingly, the Eu-doped mixed halide perovskite photodetector exhibits self-biased behavior with a photocurrent to dark current ratio of ∼103, while the turn on voltage of the undoped device is −0.4 V. Photo responsivity of the MAPb0.9Eu0.1Br2.7Cl0.3 photodetector is found to be 5.02 A W−1 at 480 nm light illumination which is ∼4.4 times higher than that of the undoped counterpart. From the temporal photoresponse, the rise and fall times of the Eu-doped device are calculated to be 17.5 and 38.5 μs, respectively, which places the device among the fastest mixed halide perovskite photodetectors reported to date. Enhanced performance of the Eu-doped perovskite photodetector is due to the decrease in trap density and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. Most importantly, the doped NPL based devices show excellent photo, operational and storage stability by keeping their photodetection ability unaltered due to increased intrinsic stability with the introduction of Eu3+ ions in the perovskite crystal. Our DFT analysis results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, particularly the improved photodetection performance of the doped perovskite photodetector as compared to the undoped one. In addition, the DFT calculation interestingly showed that EuCl3 doping is more effective than the elemental Eu doping in 2D perovskites in improving the photodetection performance. Our findings will stimulate further investigation and application of 2D Eu-doped perovskite NPL in the field of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.
