    , Accepted 22nd August 2014First published on 22nd August 2014AbstractA series of quinoidal thiophene based dye molecules were designed and their optoelectronic properties were studied for dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. The efficiency of the designed dye molecules was analyzed using various parameters such as the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, absorption spectra, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), exciton biding energy (Eb) and free energy change for electron injection (ΔGinject). The simulated absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene molecules show that the electron withdrawing group substituted molecules exhibit dual band characteristics. We found that the cyano-[5′-(4″-amino benzylidene)-5H-thiophen-2′-ylidene] acetic acid based molecules, QT2B, QT4B, QT5 and QT6, are good candidates for DSSC applications. Furthermore, the study on the polarizability and hyperpolarizability of the designed molecules showed that the electron withdrawing group substituted QT2B-X molecules (X = Cl, Br, CF3, CN and NO2) are good candidates for NLO applications.
1. Introduction
The current interest of many researchers worldwide is to find an alternative renewable energy source to meet demands due to the increased energy crisis in this century. In this scenario, the utilization of sunlight to produce electricity through the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has become the key solution to meet the energy demands.1–5 The dye molecule in DSSCs is responsible for harvesting the solar light and injection of electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The ruthenium (Ru) complexes such as N3, N719 and black dyes are the most promising dye sensitizers with the photoelectric conversion efficiency of about 11%.6–9 Recently, it has been reported that a porphyrin sensitizer, SM315, exhibits a power conversion efficiency of about 13%, and it has been shown in an earlier study that the porphyrin sensitizer has a photoelectric conversion efficiency greater than 10%.10,11 However, the DSSCs based on the above dyes are expensive, difficult to purify and are hazardous to the environment. Hence, the metal-free organic dyes have been studied as an alternative to inorganic dyes for solar cell applications. The advantages of organic sensitizers are low-cost production, easy availability, environmental friendliness and flexibility to structural modification. One typical design of an organic sensitizer is of the type D–π–A, i.e. a donor group is linked to an acceptor group through the π-spacer.3 The organic sensitizer of this type allows flexible structural modification through the substitution of different donors, acceptors and π-spacers. This strategy helps to tune the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and extends the absorption spectra of the dye molecule. Several organic molecules such as coumarin, indoline, squaraine, anthracene, merocyanine, carbazole, pyrene, etc. were used as sensitizers and extensive studies were performed both experimentally and theoretically to improve the efficiency of the DSSC.3,12–18 The theoretical studies on the dye sensitizer provide an insight into the photophysical properties and orbital energies and help to rationalize molecules with new functional groups.
Although a number of organic molecules were studied for DSSC applications, there is an urge to design new DSSCs with improved electronic properties. Recently, Komatsu et al.19 synthesized quinoidal thiophene based DSSCs and recorded a photoelectric conversion efficiency of about 5.2%. A simple strategy to improve the efficiency of DSSCs is to increase the π-conjugation of the molecule and the substitution of suitable donor and acceptor groups.3,20 The chemical structures of the designed cyano-[5′-(4″-amino benzylidene)-5H-thiophen-2′-ylidene] acetic acid based new molecules are shown in Fig. 1. The dye molecules, QT1–QT6, were constructed by the usual donor–π-spacer–acceptor strategy (D–π–A). Thiophene is an important π-conjugated organic molecule used for the applications in molecular electronics and solar cell fabrication, due to its high structural stability and π-conjugation.21–23 It has been reported that the thiophene ring in the quninoid form provides a more effective π-conjugation19 and the sensitizer with the minimum number of π-spacers was able to produce intense absorption spectra with moderate efficiency. In the present study, one or two thiophene rings in the quninoid form are used as the π-spacer and different donor groups such as dimethyl-phenylamine, triphenylamine and methoxy substituted triphenylamine groups were substituted to increase the π-conjugation of the molecule and cyanoacrylic acid is used as the acceptor group. Previous theoretical studies24,25 on DSSCs have reported that the substitution of suitable donor groups enhances the performance of the cell, hence, in the present work, dye molecules with different donor groups were also studied.

In the present study, the optoelectronic properties of the designed molecules were studied using density functional theory (DFT) methods. In addition to this, the effect of substitution of electron withdrawing groups such as Cl, Br, CF3, CN and NO2 at the thiophene ring on the spectral properties and on the efficiency of the dye molecules has been studied. The efficiency of the designed quinoidal thiophene dye molecules was studied through the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, absorption spectra, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), exciton binding energy (Eb) and the free energy change for electron injection. It has been reported in the previous studies,26–28 that the organic molecules with a donor–π-spacer–acceptor combination exhibit good nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Furthermore, it is reported that the NLO property of the molecule is sensitive to the conjugation length, donor and acceptor substitutions and to the symmetry of the molecule.26–29 The strategy followed here to design DSSC provides asymmetry in the molecule thereby favouring the NLO property. Hence, in the present work the NLO property of the designed quinoidal thiophene molecules was analyzed through the dipole moment, static polarizability and first hyperpolarizability.
2. Computational methodology
The ground state geometries of the dye molecules were optimized by the B3LYP30–32 method using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. Consequently, the frequency calculations at the same level of theory show that the designed quinoidal thiophene dyes are at stationary points without any imaginary frequency. To include the solvent effect, the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) calculation was performed using Tomasi's33 polarizable continuum model (PCM). In the PCM method, the solute molecule lies inside a cavity representing a solvent medium defined in terms of a structureless material characterized by its dielectric constant, radius, density and molecular volume. In the present study, a dielectric constant of 35.69 is used to represent the acetonitrile medium. The experimental absorption wavelength of the QT1 molecule in acetonitrile medium is observed at 548 nm.19 Based on the ground state optimized geometry, the absorption spectra of the QT1 molecule were calculated using the different DFT functionals within the framework of the time dependent DFT (TDDFT) method. Manzhos et al.34 have reported that the TDDFT method fails to predict excitation energy of organic dyes. However, a few benchmark studies35,36 on organic dyes have reported that the results obtained by the TDDFT method are comparable with those obtained by highly accurate ab initio methods. In the present work, the absorption energy and oscillator strength associated with HOMO → LUMO transition in the QT1 molecule calculated using B3LYP, PBE0,37,38 BHandHLYP,31,39 M06-2X,40 M06-HF,41 CAM-B3LYP42 and LC-BLYP43,44 functionals with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set are summarized in Table S1a (ESI†). Among the different functionals employed, the difference between the experimental and the calculated absorption wavelength of the QT1 molecule by the B3LYP method is less and is found to be 19 nm. Furthermore, the basis set effect on the absorption spectra of the QT1 molecule was studied and the results are summarized in Table S1b (ESI†). From Table S1b (ESI†), it can be observed that the B3LYP functional with the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set predicts the absorption spectra more closer to the experimental value. Hence, the absorption spectra of the designed quinoidal thiophene molecules in acetonitrile medium were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory. The B3LYP hybrid functional is one of the standard functionals and widely used to study the optoelectronic properties of the dye molecules.45–47 The SWizard program48,49 was used to simulate the absorption spectra of the molecules. The spectra were generated using the Gaussian function with a half-bandwidth of 3000 cm−1 as given in the following relation,  where ε(ω) is the molar extinction coefficient in M−1 cm−1, ω is the energy of the allowed transition in cm−1, fI is the oscillator strength and Δ1/2 is the half-bandwidth.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbitals
Extensive knowledge about the frontier molecular orbitals of organic molecules is important while studying the optoelectronic properties of the molecules. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies and the energy gap between them in the quinoidal thiophene dyes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium are illustrated in Fig. 2. An efficient sensitizer should have a small HOMO–LUMO (EH–L) gap, the LUMO energy level above the conduction band of the semiconductor and the HOMO energy level below the redox couple. From Fig. 2, it can be observed that except for QT2B-CF3, CN and NO2 substituted molecules, the LUMO energy of the dye molecules are above the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.0 eV)50 and the HOMO energies are below the redox couple of I−/I3− (−4.8 eV).51 The EH–L of the QT1 dye molecule is 2.41 eV and the EH–L of the other substituted dye molecules decreases significantly. When the π-conjugation of the QT1 molecule increased with the substitution of another thiophene ring, the EH–L decreased by 0.5 eV from that of QT1. It is interesting to note that when the thiophene rings are in the opposite direction (QT2B) the EH–L further decreased by 0.06 eV with respect to the QT2A molecule. When the dimethyl-phenylamine group was replaced by a triphenylamine group (QT3) in the donor part, the EH–L of the dye molecule decreased only by 0.08 eV with respect to QT1. Further, the QT4A and QT4B molecules were designed by extending the π-bridge of the QT3 molecule with the substitution of another thiophene ring. The inclusion of the second thiophene ring decreased the EH–L by 0.43 and 0.49 eV with respect to QT3 in QT4A and QT4B dye molecules. In QT5, the methoxy group was substituted at the para position of the phenyl rings and in QT6 one of the phenyl rings was replaced with a naphthyl ring. As shown in Fig. 2, the methoxy group has slightly higher influence on the orbital energies than the naphthyl ring and the calculated EH–L of the QT5 molecule is 1.78 eV. By comparing the EH–L of QT2B, QT4B, QT5 and QT6, it was found that the EH–L of the dye molecules does not show a significant difference upon the substitution of dimethyl-phenylamine, triphenylamine and the naphthalene group as donor groups in the dye molecule. The substitution of strong electron withdrawing groups Cl, Br, CF3, CN or NO2 at the 3rd and 4th positions of the thiophene ring of the QT2B molecule altered the HOMO and LUMO energies significantly. The CF3 substituted molecule exhibits the minimum EH–L of 1.53 eV. The EH–L of the designed molecules ranges between 1.53–2.41 eV, indicating the effect of π-conjugation and substitution of functional groups on the energy levels of the dye molecules. From Fig. 2–4, it can be observed that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group has a significant effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the designed dye molecules compared with that of the extension of the π-conjugation through quinoidal thiophene molecules.
 Fig. 2  The energies of the HOMO, LUMO and the HOMO–LUMO gap in (eV) of quinoidal thiophene dyes calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium. 
The ground state density plots of the HOMO and the LUMO of quinoidal thiophene molecules calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. From Fig. 3, it can be observed that the HOMO of QT1–QT6 is delocalized over the entire molecule and the LUMO of QT1, QT2A and QT2B is delocalized over the entire molecule, whereas the LUMO of QT3, QT4, QT5 and QT6 is delocalized on the π-bridge and on the acceptor group. Notably, the HOMO and LUMO delocalization on EWG substituted molecules, QT2B-X (X = Cl, Br, CF3, CN and NO2), is distinct from that of the other molecules. The HOMO of Cl and Br substituted molecules, (i.e. QT2B-Cl and QT2B-Br) is delocalized over the entire molecule but with strong delocalization on one of the thiophene rings and on the acceptor group, and their LUMO is delocalized over the entire molecule. In the case of CF3, CN and NO2 substituted molecules, the HOMO is delocalized on one of the thiophene rings and on the acceptor group, whereas the LUMO is delocalized on the donor group and on the nearby thiophene ring. This distinct feature of the molecules is due to the substitution of strong EWGs on the thiophene rings. But for a molecule to have high electron injection and improved efficiency, the LUMO should be delocalized on the acceptor group. This shows that the EWG CF3, CN and NO2 substituted molecules cannot be used for DSSC applications. These results clearly show that the absorption spectra of the designed dye molecule are associated with the intramolecular charge transfer and π → π* transition in the studied dye molecules.

3.2 Absorption spectra
The absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene molecules calculated at the TD-B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium are summarized in Table 1 and the simulated absorption spectra using the SWizard program are shown in Fig. 5. From Table 1 and Fig. 5, it can be observed that the absorption spectra of the designed molecules have significantly red shifted with respect to the QT1 dye molecule. When the π-bridge of the QT1 molecule is increased by substituting another thiophene ring, the absorption spectra of the dye molecule are red shifted by 122 nm. The dominant absorption band of QT2A is observed at 661 nm, and if the two thiophene rings are in the opposite direction (QT2B) the absorption spectra were further red shifted by about 20 nm. The above results clearly show that the extension of π-conjugation through the quinoidal thiophene ring provides an effective conjugation and red shifts the absorption spectra significantly. In all the studied molecules, the dominant band is associated with HOMO → LUMO transition. When the donor group dimethyl-phenylamine was replaced by a triphenylamine group (QT3) there was a red shift of 45 nm in the absorption spectra with respect to the QT1 molecule. The dominant absorption spectrum of the QT3 dye molecule is found at 584 nm and it corresponds to HOMO → LUMO transition and the small peaks observed at 408 and 327 nm are due to the electronic transition between HOMO − 1 → LUMO and HOMO − 4 → LUMO orbitals. The dominant absorption spectra of QT4A and QT4B molecules were observed at 693 and 713 nm. While comparing QT5 and QT6 molecules, the former exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 739 nm. As shown in Fig. 5, the dominant absorption spectra of the QT1–QT6 dye molecules lie in the visible region of the spectrum.

 Fig. 5  The absorption spectra of the quinoidal thiophene dyes computed at the TD-B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium. 
From Fig. 5, it can be observed that with substitution of the EWG, the absorption spectra of the dye molecules exhibit a dual band character i.e., one band lies in the visible region and the other band in the near IR region of the spectrum. This is in agreement with a previous study52 which has reported that the substitution of functional groups such as Se and Te, on the π-bridge provides a dual band character. Among the EWG substituted molecules, the CF3 substituted dye molecule (QT2B-CF3) exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength at 1043 nm and it corresponds to HOMO → LUMO transition. But the intensity of the spectrum observed in the near IR region is weak, whereas the other band of QT2B-CF3 observed at 451 nm is intense and it corresponds to HOMO − 1 → LUMO transition. In line with a previous study,52 it was observed that the absorption spectrum of the dye molecules red shifted significantly, due to the substitution of strong EWG on the QT2B molecule. The density plot of the orbitals involved in electronic transitions is shown in Fig. 3 and 4; and Fig. S1 (ESI†). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the dominant absorption bands of the dye molecule are either due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) or π → π* transition. The above results show that an increase in the π-conjugation and the substitution of EWGs on the π-spacer, significantly red shift the absorption spectra of the designed molecules.
The oscillator strength of the dye molecules increased with an increase in the π-conjugation. From Table 1, it can be observed that the oscillator strength corresponding to dominant absorption bands of QT2A (1.95) and QT2B (1.86) molecules have increased when compared with QT1 (1.38), showing that the substitution of the quinoidal ring enhances the intensity of the absorption spectrum. Similar to QT2 molecules, the oscillator strength of QT4, QT5 and QT6 molecules is also high. As discussed previously, the EWG substituted molecules exhibit a dual band character, but their oscillator strength is lesser than that of the other molecules. It has been observed that the oscillator strength of the NO2 substituted molecule is much lesser than that of the other molecules. The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) is one of the important parameters related with the intensity of the absorption spectra of the dye molecule and is calculated using the following equation LHE = 1–10−f(1)where f is the oscillator strength of the dye molecule. For an efficient photocurrent response, the LHE of the dye molecule should be high. The calculated LHE values for various bands of the designed dye molecules are summarized in Table 1. The LHE of the designed dye molecules increases with an increase in the π-conjugation and is nearer to unity for the absorption band associated with HOMO → LUMO transition in the designed molecules except for QT2B-X (X = Br, CF3, CN or NO2) molecules. The maximum value of around 0.988 is observed for QT2A, QT2B, QT4A, QT4B, QT5 and QT6 molecules. Notably, for the QT2B-CF3 molecule the LHE of the second absorption band appearing at 451 nm is 0.928, whereas for other EWG substituted dyes, the LHE is lesser than that of QT1–QT6 molecules.
3.3 Electron injection and the exciton binding energy
The knowledge of the electronic properties of the dye molecules in the excited state is important to improve the performance of the DSSC. The efficiency of the solar cell is highly dependent on the rate of electron injection from the excited state of the dye molecule to the conduction band of the semiconductor. Preat et al.53–55 theoretically proposed a method to quantify the electron injection from the excited state of the dye molecule to the conduction band of the semiconductor. According to this model, the free energy change (in eV) for the electron injection is expressed as (2)where  is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state and ESCCB is the conduction band edge of the semiconductor. ESCCB is sensitive to the experimental conditions, for TiO2 it is equal to 4.0 eV, which is the experimental value corresponding to the conditions where the semiconductor (TiO2) is in contact with the aqueous redox electrolyte of fixed pH 7.0.50,56 In general, two methods are commonly used to evaluate . In the first method, it is assumed that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state of the dye molecule, and the excited state oxidation potential is calculated from the redox potential of the ground state (EdyeOX) (i.e., −EdyeHOMO = EdyeOX) and the absorption energy associated with the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (λmax) (3)
In the second method, it is assumed that the electron injection occurs from the relaxed excited state of the dye molecule and  is calculated as (4)
The 0–0 transition energy (Edye0–0) is calculated using λmax, the total energy of the first excited state in the ground state geometry ES1(QS0) and the total energy of the first excited state in the excited state geometry ES1(QS1) as Edye0–0 = λmax − ES1(QS0) − ES1(QS1)(5)
The excited state geometry of the dye molecules is optimized at the TD-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory in acetonitrile medium. The calculated  and ΔGinject values through the two methods are summarized in Table 2. For the effective functioning of the solar cell, the rate of electron injection from the dye molecule to the conduction band of the semiconductor should be high. From Table 2, it can be observed that the QT1 molecule has high ΔGinject values of −0.80 eV and −0.75 eV calculated through the unrelaxed and relaxed models, respectively. By comparing the ΔGinject calculated with the relaxed and unrelaxed geometries, it is found that for the QT3 and EWG substituted Q2TB-X molecules the difference between ΔGinject values calculated from the two methods ranges between 0.1 and 0.35 eV, whereas for other molecules the difference is around 0.05 to 0.08 eV only. That is, the effect of relaxation on ΔGinject of QT3 and Q2TB-X molecules is high and the ΔGinject increases due to structural relaxation which is less favorable for photocurrent conversion efficiency. Except for EWG substituted QT2B-X (X = Cl, Br, CF3, CN and NO2) molecules, the calculated ΔGinject is negative implying that the injection reaction is exergonic which is favourable for electron transfer.57 Notably, the EWG substituted dye molecules have high ΔGinject and particularly the CF3, CN and NO2 substituted molecules have endoergic electron injection characteristics.

To attain high energy-conversion efficiency, the excited electron and hole pairs should dissociate into separate positive and negative charges to escape from recombination due to the coulombic attraction. To achieve this process, the binding energy has to be overcome. That is, the dye molecule should posses less exciton binding energy for high energy conversion. Here, the exciton binding energy was calculated using the formula58,59Eb = Eg − EX = EH–L − λmaxwhere Eg is the band gap and is approximated as the HOMO–LUMO energy difference and EX is the optical gap and is defined as the first singlet excitation energy, λmax. The calculated exciton binding energies of the designed molecules are summarized in Table 2. The exciton binding energy of QT1 molecule is 0.11 eV and those of the QT4, QT5 and QT6 molecules have nearly the same value. From Table 3, it can be observed that the exciton binding energy of QT2A and QT2B is the same and is equal to 0.04 eV which is lesser than that of the other molecules. Note that the substitution of the EWG on QT2B increases the exciton binding energy and the CF3 substituted molecule has the maximum value of 0.34 eV. The above results show that the QT2, QT4, QT5 and QT6 molecules are more suitable for DSSC applications and substitution of EWG on the π-spacer will not provide high photo-current conversion efficiency.

3.4 Dipole moment
The dipole moment is one of the important parameters which provides information about the electronic charge distribution in the molecule. The knowledge about the dipole moment of the organic molecules is important while designing the materials for optoelectronic applications. The calculated ground state dipole moments of the studied dye molecules in gas phase and in acetonitrile medium at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory are summarized in Table 3. The dipole moment of the QT1 molecule in gas phase is 13.58 Debye. Except for QT3, QT4B and QT6 molecules, the dipole moment of the designed molecules is higher than that of QT1. The EWG substituted derivatives possess higher dipole moment and notably the CF3 substituted derivative has a dipole moment of 25.42 Debye in gas phase. From Table 3, it can be observed that the dipole moment of the quinoidal thiophene dye molecules increases significantly in the acetonitrile medium. This is because of the additional dipole moment induced by the solvent reaction field. In the acetonitrile medium, the dipole moment of QT1 molecule is 21.49 Debye and among the designed molecules, the NO2 substituted dye molecules exhibit the maximum dipole moment of 55.68 Debye.
3.5 Static polarizability and first hyperpolarizability
The static polarizability (α) and first hyperpolarizability (β) of the quinoidal thiophene molecules were calculated using the formulas as described in a previous study29 and are summarized in Table 3. The static polarizability of QT1 is 571 a.u. The methoxy triphenylamine substituted QT molecule, QT5, has the maximum polarizability of 1364 a.u. The static polarizability is directly proportional to the dipole moment60 and according to this proportionality the EWG substituted quinoidal thiophene molecules must have larger polarizability. But from Table 3, it can be seen that the α values of Cl and Br substituted molecules are 1149 and 1088 a.u., whereas the α of other EWG substituted molecules is small due to the less contribution of the αxx component.
From Table 3, it can be seen that the first hyperpolarizability of the studied molecules increases with an increase in π-conjugation, except for the QT2B molecule. The first hyperpolarizability is inversely proportional to the transition energy.60 Accordingly, the CF3 substituted molecule with minimum transition energy (1.19 eV obtained from TDDFT calculation) exhibits the maximum β value of 74.64 × 10−28 esu. The strong electronegative fluorine atom in CF3 provides a significant contribution of the βyyy component on β. That is, the displacement of the charge cloud is higher in that particular direction. From Table 1, it can be noted that the transition energy of the EWG substituted molecules is lesser than that of other molecules and consequently the β of these molecules is higher than that of other molecules. The above results are in line with the previous studies that β depends on the donor, acceptor, π-bridge and functional group substitutions.26,27 A higher value of first hyperpolarizability and dipole moment is important for active NLO performance and the present results clearly inculcate that these quinoidal thiophene dye molecules particularly EWG substituted QT2B molecules can be used for NLO applications.
4. Conclusions
By analyzing the results obtained using different DFT functionals and basis sets, it has been observed that the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory predicts the experimental absorption wavelength for the cyano-[5′-(4″-(N,N-dimethylamino)benzylidene)-5H-thiophen-2′-ylidene] acetic acid (QT1) molecule. The calculated absorption spectra of the designed quinoidal thiophene (QT) molecules indicate that the extension of π-conjugation through the quinoidal thiophene ring and the substitution of electron withdrawing groups on the QT rings increase the absorption wavelength significantly. The results obtained from the frontier molecular orbital analysis, the free energy change for electron injection and the exciton binding energy of the designed dye molecules show that the designed QT molecules with dimethyl-phenylamine, triphenylamine, methoxy substituted triphenylamine and naphthalene substituted groups as donors are more suitable for DSSC applications. Hence, it is expected that the results obtained from this investigation will have substantial impact on the development of DSSCs based on quinoidal thiophene dye molecules. The calculated free energy change for electron injection on the dye molecules shows that the relaxation effect is more in EWG substituted QT2B molecules, that is, the EWG substitution on the QT2B molecule is not suitable for DSSC applications. The calculated dipole moment, static polarizability and first hyperpolarizability values show that the EWG substituted QT2B molecules possess good NLO properties.
