    , Accepted 7th November 2019First published on 7th November 2019AbstractRecently, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown a breakthrough in photovoltaic performance due to their constantly improving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) because of their admirable photoelectric properties and enhanced thermal stability. However, most fabrication processes take place inside a nitrogen glove box because CsPbI3 is notoriously sensitive to moisture. These tedious and rigorous operational conditions restrict CsPbI3 PSCs' commercialization. In our research, in order to solve the awkward situation of fabricating CsPbI3 PSCs without ambient moisture, we successfully developed an easy, one-step anti-solvent hot substrate (Anti-hot) spin-coating method to fabricate CsPbI3 film. Pre-heating the substrate could change the saturated vapor pressure of the mixed solvents and accelerate the precursor concentrations up to the supersaturation limit. Meanwhile, the anti-solvent method could induce heterogeneous nucleation. As a result, we could efficaciously control nucleation generation and grain growth under ambient moisture conditions and resist erosion and damage by molecular water. Finally, uniform and compact CsPbI3 film could be achieved and the corresponding PSCs reached up to 15.91% in a high humidity environment (RH, ∼50%). We hope that our exploration can provide a synthetic approach for producing high-quality CsPbI3 film for PSCs under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) since they were first reported.1–5 Therein, one of the inorganic cesium lead iodine perovskites CsPbI3 has become the emerging perovskite absorption layer because its black phase, with an appropriate band gap of 1.72 eV, shows the ideal electronic structure.6–10 It is predictable that the CsPbI3 PSCs will have tremendous potential and commercial applications due to their thermal stability.11–15 Recently, the PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs has exceeded 18%.16–20 However, the highest performing CsPbI3 PSCs are prepared in glove boxes filled with nitrogen (N2) because the CsPbI3 films are sensitive to moisture and water, which have a negative effect on the long-term stability and lifetime of PSCs in general.21,22 Such a manufacturing process increases the cost and restricts the operations that can be performed. Thus, it is a great challenge to develop PSCs for commercial applications that can be manufactured in the open air.23,24
In the open air, water in a humid atmosphere will influence the crystal growth and result in the creeping-in of grain boundaries. To gain high crystallinity and pin-hole-free perovskite films in a high humidity environment, it is essential to decrease the time for which the nucleation phase is exposed to high humidity, and accelerate the formation of the intermediate phase.25,26 Of course, one-step spin-coating deposition is the most convenient way to fabricate smooth and pin-hole-free perovskite films, and anti-solvents can be used for modifying and optimizing.27,28 Anti-solvents can control the morphology of the perovskite film, adjust the thickness of the perovskite layer and influence the grain boundary.29,30 Troughton et al. have demonstrated that moisture in the air reacts more readily with anti-solvents than with the perovskite intermediate phase.31 Yang et al. have fabricated high-quality MAPbI3 PSCs (PCEs ∼ 16.4%) in an ambient moisture environment of around 50% relative humidity (RH) with a one-step spin-coating method using diethyl ether-doped methanol as an anti-solvent.32
In addition, it has been shown that a small amount of water is beneficial for PSCs because water molecules have been applied to perovskite precursor solutions as an additive.33–35 Gong et al. demonstrated that CH3NH3PbI3−xClx·H2O hydrated perovskite could facilitate the controllable crystalline growth of perovskite due to the lower boiling point and higher saturated vapor pressure of water compared with those of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).36 Zhao et al. also found that adding a small amount of water to the CsPbI3 precursor solution affected the solution ionization and led to stable CsPbI3 phase formation.37 There is still an inevitable problem with annealing the perovskite film in an open, high humidity environment, and Snaith et al. have clearly explained that the annealing process in air promotes a modified crystalline structure compared with the process in nitrogen.38 However, it can be seen that it is feasible to fabricate the PSCs in the open air with one-step spin-coating.
Most research on the manufacture of PSCs in the open air is related to the organic halide MAPbX3. There is little systematic and accurate research dealing with the manufacture of CsPbI3 PSCs in an open moisture environment. Luo et al. attempted to develop sequential solvents to prepare a CsPbI3 device (PCE ∼ 4.13%) with hydroiodic acid (HI) and succedent isopropanol (IPA) treatment under full open-air conditions.39 Nevertheless, there are still many potential questions to be answered in further studies concerning the mechanism of nucleation and growth of CsPbI3 film in high humidity environments.
In this work, we carry out a convenient one-step hot spin-coating method to fabricate high performance CsPbI3 PSCs (substrate/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2/CsPbI3/poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA)/Au) under ambient conditions. Highly quality CsPbI3 films could be obtained in a high humidity environment without an N2 atmosphere by pre-warming the substrate and spraying the anti-solvent methyl acetate (MA) during the spinning-coating. The optimized device shows a champion PCE of 15.91% under high humidity conditions (RH, ∼50%). In addition, we aimed to clarify the nucleation mechanism and the influence on crystalline growth of external factors (moisture, thermodynamic factors, anti-solvents and so on) which alter the solvent saturated vapor pressure and control precursor concentrations up to supersaturation. We believe that our study will contribute to the development of manufacturing processes for CsPbI3 film in an ambient atmosphere and promote the commercialization of CsPbI3 PSCs.
Results and discussion
In our work, we fabricated CsPbI3 PSCs via four different kinds of methods, namely cold-substrate one-step spin-coating (Ref-cold), anti-solvent cold-substrate one-step spin-coating (Anti-cold), hot-substrate one-step spin-coating (Ref-hot) and anti-solvent hot-substrate one-step spin-coating (Anti-hot). All of the above approaches were carried out in the open air. Due to the high humidity in the open air, the water molecules would be expected to have a non-negligible influence on the crystalline structure and morphology of the CsPbI3 films during a series of thermodynamic and kinetic processes (atomic deposition, diffusion, nucleation and growth). These different processes are affected by moisture which could cause undesirable changes in the CsPbI3 grains.
Firstly, we contrasted the morphologies of the CsPbI3 layers fabricated under various humidity conditions, before and after annealing. As shown by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1a–d, the varying humidity has a significant influence on the surface morphology of the CsPbI3 layer prepared in open air on a TiO2 layer with the conventional method (Ref-cold). Gao et al. have pointed out that high quality, high density nucleation tends to occur in anhydrous circumstances, leading to crystallite growth and high surface coverage of perovskite films on the substrate.40 Compared with the higher humidity conditions, the surface morphologies of the CsPbI3 layers deposited at RH ∼ 0% and RH < 30% show more homogenous, intact and compact planar films. However, when the RH is in the range 30–60%, more cavities appear in the CsPbI3 layers, and the surface of the films is much more heterogeneous than that of the films formed in the low RH open environment. At RH > 60%, the CsPbI3 crystallites adopt larger individual sizes forming islands, and the surface coverage of the CsPbI3 film decreases apparently. These island-shaped crystallites are more distant from each other and fail to form continuous films. The above phenomenon indicates that a high ambient humidity results in large crystal islands of CsPbI3, large gaps and low surface coverage.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of CsPbI3 films prepared under different RH conditions (a–d) before annealing and (e–h) after annealing: (a and e) RH = 0%; (b and f) RH < 30%; (e and g) RH = 30–60%; (d and h) RH > 60%. 
In addition, SEM images Fig. 1e–h reveal the annealed surface morphologies of CsPbI3 films prepared with conventional one-step spin-coating under various RH conditions. Raga et al. have noted that ambient annealing offers an alternative to annealing in dry N2 but it changes the perovskite microcrystal size and the components of the film.41,42 In an N2 atmosphere, the annealed CsPbI3 layer prepared in a glove box is uniform and homogenous, exhibiting only a low number of small pin-holes in the grain boundary. In contrast, when the humidity reaches up to 30%, many distinct medium sized pin-holes emerge, and even some small cracks appear on the CsPbI3 film. With an RH of 30–60%, a large number of distinct relatively large cavities are seen on the annealed surfaces of the perovskite layer. In Fig. 1h, under the high humidity conditions (RH > 60%), the island-shaped crystallites are anomalous and heterogeneous, and the crystal grains separate from each other. The discrete CsPbI3 films in ambient moisture present cookie-shaped crystals and poor coverage which can be ascribed to the corrosion caused by the high humidity in the open environment.
To improve the morphology of the CsPbI3 film prepared under high humidity, the primary task is to overcome the grain nucleation and growth problems seen in open air. Anti-solvents have the tendency to impel the CsPbI3 precursor into the metastable zone rather than the supersaturation zone and accelerate both grain nucleation and growth rate.43 As shown in the SEM images and cross-section SEM images in Fig. 2a, e and i, we next prepared the CsPbI3 layer with the Ref-cold method with RH = 50%. Before annealing, the CsPbI3 layer shows irregular and small crystalline grains with poor coverage on the TiO2 substrate with the high humidity (RH ∼ 50%) in the open environment. After annealing, the growth grains are badly formed and feature pin-holes which suggest that the device will show current leakage. The island-shaped grains are heterogeneous and show poor layer to layer contact, moreover, some fault zones exist between the grains as seen in the cross-section SEM images.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of CsPbI3 films prepared with different methods in open air with RH = ∼50% (a–d) before annealing and (e–h) after annealing: (a and e) Ref-cold; (b and f) Anti-cold; (c and g) Ref-hot; (d and h) Anti-hot. Cross-sectional SEM images of devices fabricated with different methods in open air: (i) Ref-cold, (j) Anti-cold, (k) Ref-hot and (l) Anti-hot. 
Compared with the Ref-cold samples, the CsPbI3 layer shows obvious optimization when the Anti-cold method (incorporating MA treatment into the Ref-cold method) is adopted (Fig. 2b, f and j). Yang et al. have demonstrated that the relatively high vapor pressure and high water-solubility of MA will promote the formation of a higher quality MAPbI3 perovskite layer containing fewer pin-holes as required for the ideal PCEs.25 Notably, when the CsPbI3 layer is modified with the MA anti-solvent, the morphology of the surface is more homogeneous and has higher coverage than that of the Ref-cold samples. After annealing, the CsPbI3 film shows a few remnant pin-holes but its surface is more uniform and smoother compared with that of the Ref-cold samples. The cross-section SEM image of the Anti-cold layer shows that the contact between the layers is more favorable and successive fault-free CsPbI3 layers can be obtained via MA treatment.
In spite of the modification caused by the MA treatment, the CsPbI3 layer still features too many pin-holes. Hot casting processed CsPbI3 films should have higher quality morphologies due to frequent evaporation and a faster nucleation rate because the thermal motion speeds up at the high boiling points of DMF (153 °C) and DMSO (189 °C).44 As shown in Fig. 2c, g and k, the size of the crystal grains becomes bigger and these crystalline grains can easily form CsPbI3 layers which are free of pin-holes, when we prepare the CsPbI3 film by the Ref-hot method in which the TiO2 substrate is heated to 80 °C prior to spin-coating on the original basis of the Ref-cold method. Sveinbjörnsson et al. have reported that spin-coating a precursor solution onto a warm substrate in ambient air can lead to a suitable thickness of perovskite layer and that this thickness is dependent on the substrate temperature.45 Based on the above characteristics, we next combined the anti-solvent treatment with the warm substrate, and adopted this Anti-hot method to fabricate high performance CsPbI3 PSCs. Fig. 2d, h and l display images of the CsPbI3 film which was fabricated by the Anti-hot method; they show high coverage, full and bigger grains and a pin-hole-free surface morphology. The cross-section of the device demonstrates that the active layer has a suitable thickness of 550 nm and that the film is more compact and freer of cavities compared to that modified by MA anti-solvent alone. Moreover, Huang et al. have noted that a certain amount of moisture will slow the crystal growth because the moisture will control the solubility and supersaturation of the perovskite. Furthermore, the grain boundaries are very sensitive to moisture which is itself affected by surface effects; lattice distortion will passivate traps aiding conductivity and causing self-doping.21 Herein, the combination of antisolvents, warm substrate and water have a synergetic effect on perovskite nucleation and growth.
For the next investigation, we wanted to consider the theory of classical nucleation and growth by synchronous growth from precursors (one-step). Nucleation is the primary process of film formation which determines the later crystalline growth and property of the final device. In one-step spin-coating deposition, precursors (in which all the components of CsPbI3 are dissolved) are co-instantaneously evaporated and gather on a substrate. The removal of the solvent changes the concentration of the precursor solution, increasing it toward supersaturation by means of thermal evaporation, anti-solvent extraction and so on. In classical nucleation, the saturation of the precursor leads to the emergence of “monomers” containing atoms, ions or molecules which make up the crystal nucleus on the substrate or colloidal particle/precursor-solution surface/interface (heterogeneous nucleation) and/or within the precursor solution (homogeneous nucleation).46
In the case of classical homogeneous nucleation (Hom), the total free-energy change ΔG as a function of the nucleus radius, r, is given by:47,48 (1)where VM is the molar volume of the nucleus, R is the gas constant, T is absolute temperature, γCL is the energy of the liquid (L)–crystalline (C) bare interface, and S = C/CS expresses the supersaturation ratio, where C is the solute concentration in the precursor solution and CS is the equilibrium solubility limit. Accordingly, ΔG reaches a maximum  at a critical nucleus radius (r*).
In terms of classical heterogeneous nucleation (Het), when nuclei emerge on the external factor (such as the substrate, colloidal nanoparticles or microcrystals), the energy barrier,  is reduced obviously due to attachment and existent interface energy.
In classical nucleation theory, the rate of nucleation is given by:46,47 (2)where I = IHom for , I = IHet for , and QD is the activation energy for the transport of “monomers” to the nucleus/solution interface. As shown in Fig. 3a (plotting eqn (2) at constant T), we can speculate that there is a tendency for heterogeneous nucleation at low S, and inversely, a greater possibility of homogeneous nucleation at high S. Hence, in order to obtain high quality uniform film in the CsPbI3 precursor, it is vital to control the heterogenous nucleation at low S on the substrate rather than on colloidal nanoparticles and to boost the perovskite nucleation rate.

Dong et al. have indicated that poor quality nucleation can be ascribed to slow nucleation and crystallization rates caused by slow evaporation of the high boiling point solvents DMF and DMSO. In addition, they figured out that anti-solvents rapidly reduce the solubility of the precursor and accelerate the nucleation.49 It can be seen that the functions of the anti-solvents in the Anti-hot spin-coating method are to expedite the evaporation of the solvents, increase the concentration of precursor to attain supersaturation, and finally, promote the process of heterogeneous nucleation. At constant S, as expounded in Fig. 3b combined with eqn (2), the nucleation rate reaches a maximum with increasing temperature. When the CsPbI3 precursor is at a low temperature, the driving force for nucleation is high but diffusion is difficult. On the contrary, at high temperature, the critical nucleus radius decreases due to a decreased driving force but the diffusion speeds up.46 In the case of the Anti-hot method, the pre-heating of the substrate will increase the nucleation rate and the high temperature can accelerate the volatilization rate of the solvent to facilitate precursor supersaturation.
To illuminate the kinetics of classical homogeneous nucleation in the CsPbI3 precursor, we construct a LaMer diagram (Fig. 3c). According to the LaMer model, the “monomer” concentration (C) in the CsPbI3 precursor is a function of the reaction time. In stage I, with the constant evaporation of the solvents, the concentration of the precursor rises to CS which is a metastable condition in the precursor system; “monomers” are unable to transform into nuclei spontaneously. In stage II, after breaking through a supersaturation limit (CSS) due to the solvent volatilization, CsPbI3 nuclei appear in the supersaturated solution and the concentration of precursor starts to drop; this inhibits nucleation due to the reduction of “monomers”, thereby leading to a lower nucleation rate. In the final stage, there tends to be a balance between the chemical reaction rate, diffusion rate and nucleus generation rate.50,51
Besides, Wang et al. have stated that the exterior water will be assimilated into the precursor and lead to a reduced supersaturation concentration and so the nucleation rate will be suppressed in high humidity because the supersaturation concentration is the driving force of nucleation.52 It follows that the formation of high performance CsPbI3 film in high humidity conditions depends on rapid nucleation during a given time interval (t1 ∼ t2) by means of increasing supersaturation with pre-heating and anti-solvent extraction. The LaMer diagram can also be applied to heterogeneous nucleation with similar reaction processes according to Fig. 3d. Heterogeneous nucleation occurs at C ≫ CSS, in that the substrate and colloidal particles help the nucleus reunite, assist self-nucleation at low concentrations, and reduce the interface free energy and driving force due to the beneficial thermodynamic energy.
To confirm the homogeneity of the distribution of elements on the film surface, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 3e and f. We can figure out the elemental contents using quantitative analysis through contrasting the black and white regions associated with the SEM images of annealed perovskite films. The white regions gathering among the grain boundaries are rich in Cs content on the film surface, with a ratio of elements of Cs/Pb/I = 2/1/3. On the contrary, the black regions on the major film surface exhibit the expected elemental contents with a ratio of elements of Cs/Pb/I = 1/1/3, which is close to the theoretical value. Meng et al. have demonstrated that crystallites rich in Cs that induce spinodal decomposition of the perovskite provide high film coverage and decrease defects.53 In general, the CsPbI3 films formed by the Anti-hot method are distributed homogeneously and include the elements Cs, Pb, I but have negligible Br.
In conclusion, the following points are significant for the main process and mechanism of CsPbI3 grain nucleation and growth in the presence of ambient moisture with the Anti-hot method: a handful of water molecules both in the precursor and in the external environment significantly solve the moisture problems during the spin-coating and annealing time. The nucleation of perovskite is determined by the concentrations of the precursor and the evaporation of the solvents. The mixture of DMF/DMSO solvents has a high saturated vapor pressure (DMF ∼ 0.49 kPa, DMSO ∼ 0.68 kPa) which is beneficial for the formation of the CsPbI3 interphase.54 Meanwhile, DMF and DMSO have good dissolving capacity for CsI and PbI2 resulting in the formation of films with low trap densities. The DMSO adduct with its high boiling point has a tendency to slow down the nucleation rate in the precursor, leading to uniform films.55 The evaporation of solvent is limited by the thickness of the critical gas, and the liquid phase does not completely evaporate into the gas phase until the solvent mixture attains the saturated vapor pressure. The evaporation is influenced by two factors, namely the surface of the gas molecules, and gas diffusion which depends on the concentration gradient. A hot substrate and anti-solvents accelerate the gas flow, promoting solvent evaporation, the diffusion of molecules and the removal of remaining water. With the solvent evaporating constantly, the concentration of the precursor increases, and nucleation starts to occur when a supersaturation limit is exceeded. After initial nucleation, the CsPbI3 film growth redissolves and produces recrystallization by Ostwald ripening due to the environmental moisture.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbI3 produced by each of the four methods are shown in Fig. 4a to investigate crystallization. There are no obvious crystallographic shifts, with CsPbI3 diffraction peaks at 14.2° and 28.7° assigned to the (110) and (220) planes, respectively. The intensities of the CsPbI3 diffraction peaks in the sample prepared using the optimized method show distinct enhancements in comparison to those of the control samples. Photophysical characteristics of the CsPbI3 samples prepared with the four different methods were also examined. As shown in the absorption spectra (Fig. 4b), incremental light harvesting can be observed: the intensities of the films prepared by hot spin-coating are much stronger than those of the films prepared by the conventional spin-coating method because of the increased thickness of the hot spin-coated films (Fig. 2i–l) on the basis of the Beer–Lambert Law. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were obtained for the CsPbI3 films on quartz substrates to compare the quality of the films (Fig. 4c). We discovered that the PL intensities of the CsPbI3 films show the trend Anti-hot > Ref-hot > Anti-cold > Ref-cold, with negligible peak shift. The experimental results suggest that the film deposited by the Anti-hot method is of high quality and has a low defect state and non-radiative carrier recombination centers. This is also clearly shown in the time-resolved PL spectra (TRPL) and the fitted decay curves (Fig. 4d); the relevant key parameters are listed in Table 1. The average recombination lifetimes (τave) were estimated using the following formula: (3)

The charge carrier lifetime for the CsPbI3 films prepared by the Anti-hot method is increased from 35.36 ns (Ref-cold) to 292.84 ns which means that the film fabricated by the Anti-hot method is compact, has low numbers of defects and has high coverage with excellent crystallinity.
Furthermore, all the detailed photovoltaic parameters (short-circuit current (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE)) are provided in Fig. 4e and Table 2. Prochowicz et al. have proposed that changes in the perovskite film as a result of the nature of the perovskite film preparation conditions will have a significant influence on electric potential distributions, charge transport ability, band alignment at interfaces, doping concentration and recombination processes.56 Under high ambient moisture, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the device fabricated by the Ref-cold method yield a PCE of only 3.94% with an FF of 53.46%, JSC of 11.00 mA cm−2 and VOC of 0.67 V, due to the leakage of current which can be attributed to the poor quality sub-optimal CsPbI3 film. When the device is prepared using the Anti-hot method, the photoelectric property enhancement is evident: the champion PCE of the optimized device reaches a maximum of about 15.91%, corresponding to a VOC of 1.11 V, JSC of 18.31 mA cm−2 and FF of 77.79%. The optimized solar cells prepared using anti-solvents have favorable optoelectronic characteristics, profiting from the high quality CsPbI3 layer, high crystallinity and low non-radiative combination. As shown in Fig. 4f, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of devices fabricated by the four methods were also obtained by calculating the integrated JSC consistent with the J–V measurements within the margin of error. According to the EQE curves, the integrated JSC of the device fabricated by the Anti-hot method is also much higher than that of the Ref-cold device due to the lower current loss induced by the better film coverage and homogeneity.

As has been reported by Zhou et al.,21 a small amount of hydration water as an additive can improve the morphology and electronic properties of perovskite films, while superfluous hydration water damages the quality of perovskite films due to the poor coverage on the substrate found when the films are spin-coated directly under high ambient moisture conditions. Water is not necessary for the Anti-hot method while it is inevitable for spin-coating under the ambient moisture conditions. Therefore, it is desirable to control the hydration water effect during the film deposition in the open air. As shown in the Fig. S1 and Table S1,† the PCE (15.91%) of the device fabricated by the Anti-hot method in the open air is similar to the PCE (16.05%) of solar cells fabricated by the Anti-hot method in an N2 atmosphere. In addition, there is no obvious decline between the PCE (15.91%) of the device prepared in low humidity (RH ∼ 30%) and the PCE (15.39%) of a device fabricated in high humidity (RH ∼ 60%) as presented in Fig. S2 and Table S2.† To further confirm the reproducibility of the devices, 30 individual devices were fabricated, and their PCE statistics are shown in Fig. S3.†
As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S4,† the device shows an excellent PCE of ∼15.9% with a hot substrate temperature of 80 °C in the open air. When the CsPbI3 precursor is fabricated at low temperature, the driving force for nucleation is high but diffusion is difficult. On the contrary, at high temperature, the critical nucleus radius decreases due to the reduced driving force, but the diffusion speeds up. As shown in Fig. S5,† the device maintains 80% of its best PCE value after storage in air (relative humidity of 10–15% at about 25 °C) for almost 96 h without any encapsulation.
Conclusions
In summary, we have succeeded in fabricating high performance CsPbI3 PSCs in high humidity (RH 30–60%) environments using an anti-solvent hot-substrate one-step spin-coating method. As a result, the optimized device could obtain a champion PCE of up to 15.91% under ambient moisture conditions (RH ∼ 50%). We think that the anti-solvent and hot substrate can efficaciously control nucleation generation and grain growth in the presence of ambient moisture and resist molecular water erosion and damage. Using this method, we can conveniently manufacture high quality, compact CsPbI3 films containing few pin-holes in an open environment. Moreover, as shown from characterization experiments, we find that the devices fabricated using the Anti-hot method possess superexcellent photoelectric properties similar to those of devices fabricated in an N2 atmosphere. We hope that our method can enable the large-scale commercialization of devices in the future.
