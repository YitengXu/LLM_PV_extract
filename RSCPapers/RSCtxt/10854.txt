    , Accepted 1st March 2014First published on 10th March 2014AbstractUpconversion luminescence (UCL) detection based on rare-earth doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) as probes has been proved to exhibit a large anti-Stokes shift, no autofluorescence from biological samples, and no photobleaching. However, it is still a challenge to achieve a stable, reproducible solid-based UCL biosensor because of ineffective UCL of the UCNCs. In this work, we fabricated TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs)/NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ (Er3+) UCNC composite films, which can tremendously improve the overall UCL of Tm3+ as high as 43-fold. Based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the specific interaction between biotin and avidin, a novel solid-based UC biosensor is presented for sensing avidin. This solid-based detection system is convenient for detection, and also can offer two parameters for detecting trace amounts of avidin, namely, the emission intensity and the fluorescence decay time. The sensor has a high sensitivity of 34 pmol−1, a good linear relationship of 0.996 and a low detection limit of 48 pmol. It also exhibits excellent long-time photostability, and the absence of autofluorescence, and thus may have great potential for versatile applications in biodetection.
1. Introduction
In recent years, nanocrystals (NCs) doped with trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+) have attracted extensive attention because of their outstanding properties such as large Stokes shift, sharp emissions, and long luminescence lifetimes.1,2 Based on these outstanding properties, Ln3+ doped NCs play an important role in biomedical applications, display devices, optical communications, spectral conversion of solar cells, etc.3–6 Among all the Ln3+ doped NCs, UCNCs, which can convert a low frequency excitation photon into a high frequency emission photon through two-photon or multi-photon processes have demonstrated various applications in biological and medical fields.7 Compared to the organic fluorophores and quantum dots (QDs) commonly used in the biological field, UCNCs possess various advantages due to their unique anti-Stokes fluorescence properties, such as large penetration depth into tissues, low background noise, high chemical stability and low toxicity.8 Until now, UCNCs have been extensively applied in in vivo fluorescence labeling, photodynamic therapy of cancer, drug delivery, and optical sensors for biodetecting temperature, pH value, and various biological matters.9–11
FRET is a nonradiative process characterized by ET between an excited donor and an acceptor through long-range dipole–dipole interactions. It is widely used as a spectroscopic ruler in biological detection.12,13 The donor and acceptor fluorophores are linked in close proximity, typically less than a few nanometers, and the donor emission spectrum should overlap with the acceptor absorption spectrum. To achieve the detection function, the UCNCs were commonly combined with other chromophores, such as organic dyes, fluorescent proteins, and semiconductors.14,15 Nowadays, several sensors based on FRET have been developed to detect DNA, metal ions, and small molecules, where the UCNCs (donor) transfer energy to other chromophores (acceptor) resulting in changes in UC emission intensity. Recently, Liu developed a combination of UCNCs and MnO2 nanosheets for the selective detection of glutathione.16 Similarly, Li and coworkers demonstrated a highly sensitive water-soluble nanosystem based on cyanine dye-assembled NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+,Tm3+ UCNCs for UCL sensing and bioimaging of methylmercury.17 However, it should be highlighted that the above-mentioned UCNC system sensors were all detected in the solution. The liquid-based sensors are usually unstable, irreproducible and have low UCL due to the interaction of UCNCs with solutions, which will affect the detection limit and sensitivity unavoidably. Therefore, it is significant to develop novel solid state UCL biosensors, which permitted us to work easily, stably and repeatedly.
The low UCL quantum yield is one of the bottleneck problems for the application of biosensors based on UCNCs. For instance, it was reported that the luminescence quantum yield of the most efficient β-phase NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ microsized polycrystalline powders was only 3% under 980 nm excitation. The particles used for biodetection are usually of small size to ensure a large surface area to connect more biomolecules, but the UCL efficiency of NaLuF4:Tm3+,Yb3+ UCNCs with sizes ranging from 10–20 nm is less than 0.4%.18 So it is important to enhance the emission intensity of the UCNCs for biological applications. Until now, a number of methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of UCNCs, such as the selection of a suitable host and doping ions, surface modification, the device of core–shell structure, and surface plasmon enhancement based on the interaction of UCNCs with noble metal NPs, such as gold, silver, etc.19–23 Very recently, our group has explored novel strategies to improve the UCL of NaYF4:Yb,Er/Tm UCNCs by coupling of UCNCs with PMMA photonic crystals (PCs) or hybrids of silver plasmon nanostructures and PMMA opal photonic crystals.24,25 Using these designs, a maximum enhancement of ∼32 fold or ∼60-fold was obtained, respectively. It is expected that the modulation of PCs on UCL of NaYF4:Yb,Er/Tm UCNCs could be easily applied on the device of biosensing.
In this work, we developed a novel complex of NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs and TiO2 inverse opal photonic crystals (IOPCs) for responsive sensing of avidin. Note that nanocrystalline TiO2 has superior biological compatibility to biomolecules, since it is widely used in producing toothpaste and cosmetics. Besides it also exhibits optical transparency and the ability of selective interaction with some proteins.26 The porous inverse opal structure of TiO2 and its dispersion in NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/Tm3+ UCNCs not only could enhance the UCL, but also could ensure a large surface area to improve the effective connection of the UCNCs with avidin. An optimum UC enhancement factor (EF) of 43-fold was obtained for the overall UCL intensity of Tm3+ using this unique strategy. And also, this complex was used as a sensitive solid-based UC sensor for the detection of avidin, which was demonstrated to be more stable, convenient and applicable than the liquid-based UC biosensor.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Er
OA-coated NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Er NCs were synthesized according to a typical solvothermal method.27 The reaction temperature was controlled in the range of 285–330 °C to obtain different sizes of NaYF4 NCs. The as-prepared products were collected and washed with absolute ethanol–cyclohexane (1:1 v/v) three times, and the final products were dissolved in the cyclohexane solution for the following experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of water-soluble PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs
PEI-modified water-soluble NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs were synthesized via a solvothermal method following a procedure reported previously.28 NaCl (2.5 mmol), PEI (0.4 g), Y(NO3)3 (0.798 mmol), Yb(NO3)3 (0.20 mmol), and Tm(NO3)3 (0.002 mmol) were dissolved in EG (15 mL) under vigorous stirring. When the solution became transparent, NH4F (4 mmol) in EG (10 mL) was added to it. After being stirred for another 10 min, the whole mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 200 °C for 2 h. After the autoclave cooled down to room temperature naturally, NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs were harvested by centrifugation and washed with deionized water three times, and then redispersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The NaYF4:Ce,Tb NCs (PEI–NaYF4:5% Ce,5% Tb) were synthesized by using the same method.
2.3 Preparation of biotin-conjugated NaYF4
50 mg of PEI–NCs was diluted in 5 mL of PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4, 10 mM), and then 5 mg of activated biotin was added to the mixture under gentle shaking for 4 h at room temperature. Biotin was covalently conjugated with UCNCs by an amido bond. Then the mixture was harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS buffer solution to remove excess biotin. The bio-UCNCs were diluted in 5 mL of PBS and stored at 4 °C for further use.
2.4 Synthesis of FITC-labeled avidin
Prior to the detection, avidin was labeled with FITC following a well-established protocol. 10 mg avidin was dissolved in 5 mL of 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5). Meanwhile, 1.0 mg FITC was dissolved in 0.5 mL DMSO. After that, the two solutions were mixed gently and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C in the dark. The excess FITC was removed via dialysis for 48 h using a membrane of molecular weight cutoff of 14000 Da.
To investigate the fluorescence quenching degree, the as-prepared composite films were placed in 24-well plates, and subsequently, different amounts of avidin–FITC solutions were dropwise added on the films. The films were incubated in the dark for 30 min, and then were subject to fluorescence measurement.
2.5 Preparation of TiO2 IOPCs
The TiO2 IOPCs were prepared by using the sol–gel method with a PMMA latex sphere template technique. First, monodispersed PMMA latex spheres with controllable sizes were synthesized. Then, a thin-film template was self-assembled through the vertical deposition process. The colloid suspension (5% solid content) of PMMA microspheres was dropped onto a glass substrate and placed in a 32 °C oven for 24 h. The PMMA colloidal spheres slowly self-organized into highly ordered colloidal arrays on the glass substrate, driven by surface tension of the liquid in the evaporating process. Following deposition, the opals were sintered for 40 min at 120 °C to enhance their physical strength. In the preparation of a TiO2 precursor sol, 10 mL butyltitanate, 10 mL ethanol, and 1 mL nitric acid were mixed and stirred for 1 h to form a transparent solution. The prepared precursor solutions were used to infiltrate into the voids of the opal template through capillary force. After infiltration, the resulting products were dried in air at room temperature. Annealing was carried out by slowly elevating the temperature (1 °C min−1) up to 500 °C for 3 h. By controlling the diameters of PMMA latex spheres during polymerization in the previous step, the photonic stop band (PSB) of IOPCs was finely tuned. Moreover, the TiO2 powder used as a reference sample for XRD (in Fig. 2(d)) was grinding the sample of the IOPCs to destroy the 3D ordered structure.
2.6 Preparation of NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Er UCNC and TiO2 composite films
OA coated NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Er UCNCs were dissolved in cyclohexane with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1. After that the glass substrate with (or without) the TiO2 IOPCs was dropped vertically into the cyclohexane solution and placed in an oven at 25 °C for over 2 hours. With the slow volatilization of cyclohexane, the NaYF4:Yb,Er UCNCs were laxly self-organized into the void space of TiO2 IOPCs or deposited directly on the surface of the glass substrate, driven by the capillary force of the liquid in the evaporation process. Similarly, the water-soluble PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs dissolved in the PBS and TiO2 IOPC templates in the PBS were placed in an oven at 25 °C for over 8 hours.
2.7 Characterization
The surface morphology of the as-prepared products was examined with a JEOL JSM-7500 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy was carried out with a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The crystalline structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku D/max-rA power diffractometer using Cu KR radiation (λ) 1.54178 Å). Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer ranging 200–1100 nm.
2.8 Luminescence measurement
The emission and excitation spectra of FITC and the composite films were recorded with a SENS-9000 spectrometer. In the measurement of UCL spectra and dynamics of the composite films, a photomultiplier combined with a monochromator was used for signal collection from 300 nm to 750 nm. A continuous 980 nm diode laser was used to pump the samples to investigate the steady-state spectra. In the measurements of luminescence dynamics and excitation wavelength-dependent UC enhancement, the samples were pumped using a laser-system consisting of a Nd:YAG pumping laser (1064 nm), a third-order Harmonic-Generator (355 nm) and a tunable optical parameter oscillator (OPO, Continuum Precision II 8000) with a pulse duration of 10 ns, a repetition frequency of 10 Hz and a line width of 4–7 cm−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of NaYF4/TiO2 composite films
The NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs with different sizes were synthesized by using a solvothermal method referred in the Experimental section, and the TiO2 IOPCs were fabricated by using a simple PMMA template removal method. The solvent evaporation method was used to assemble NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs layer-by-layer on the TiO2 film on a glass substrate. The preparation process is shown in Scheme 1(a). Fig. 1(a)–(e) show the TEM images of the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs prepared at different temperatures (280 °C, 290 °C, 300 °C, 320 °C and 330 °C). It can be found that all the NCs are single-dispersed and homogeneous. The average sizes of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs increase with the increasing reaction temperature, and they are determined to be 5, 7, 25, 35 and 50 nm, respectively, for the samples prepared at 280, 290, 300, 320 and 330 °C. Fig. 1(f) shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared NCs and the standard cards of α-NaYF4 and β-NaYF4 as controls. As can be seen, the products prepared at 280 °C and 290 °C are cubic in phase, and when the temperature increases to 300 °C, the NCs transfer to the hexagonal phase. On further increasing the temperature, NaYF4 is still hexagonal in phase without other impurity peaks. Fig. 2(a) shows the SEM image of the TiO2 IOPCs. It can be seen that the sample is a long-range ordered hexagonal arrangement of inverse opal with the center-to-center distance of ∼420 nm. For the structure of the composite films, we used the 35 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NC/TiO2 IOPC composite films for example. From the top view of the composite film (seeing Fig. 2(b)), it can be seen that after loading the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs, the interspaces of TiO2 IOPCs are occupied by NCs, as well as the structure of the TiO2 IOPCs is not destroyed by cyclohexane. Fig. 2(c) indicates that continuous NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ films are formed on the glass substrate, consisting of closely packed NCs. To determine the relative thickness of the NCs on the film and the glass, we measured the transmission of NCs on the glass and the composite film as T1 and T2. In measurement of T1 and T2, the glass and the TiO2 IOPCs were used as reference samples, respectively. According to the Beer–Lambert law, the relationship of the transmission and the absorption can be written as Ai = log(1/Ti), i = 1, 2(1)where the Ai and Ti, respectively, stand for the value of absorbance and transmittance for the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/Er3+ film (i = 1) and the composite film (i = 2). Then we could get A1 and A2. The absorbance (Ai) is linearly related to the thickness of the film (Di), so by the measurement of Ti, the relative thickness of NaYF4 in different samples can be obtained, as listed in Table 1. It can be observed that with the increase of NaYF4 particle size, the relative thickness of the NaYF4 thin film and the NaYF4/TiO2 film hybrid gradually increases. In comparison to the NaYF4 thin film on the glass, the NaYF4 layer grown on the TiO2 IOPC becomes a little bit thicker. It should be noted that in the following experiments on the EF of UCL, the influence of the thickness of NaYF4 has been considered. Fig. 2(d) depicts the XRD patterns of the TiO2 IOPCs, the TiO2 powder and the composite film in contrast to the standard card, and it can be seen that the samples are exactly corresponding to the standard card (JPCDS: 84-1285). No impurity peak appears, indicating that the samples are anatase in phase; moreover, some of the peaks of the IOPCs are too weak to appear because of the diffraction of the glass substrate. The XRD pattern of the composite film exhibited the diffraction peaks of NaYF4 in the cubic phase (marked with asterisks*) besides the TiO2 diffraction peaks. According to the width of the XRD patterns and the Scherrer formula, the nanocrystalline size of TiO2 NCs consisting the layer can be determined to be ∼16.4 nm.

3.2 UCL enhancement of the NaYF4/TiO2 composite film and its mechanism
In this work, the UCL of the NCs was measured by the transmission method, and the optical circuit is shown in Scheme 1(b). All the samples were measured and compared under the excitation of a 980 nm laser diode with the same excitation power density (48 mW mm−2), and in the measurements the optical circuit remained unchanged. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of UCL spectra under 980 nm excitation between the 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs deposited directly on the glass substrate and the 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs deposited on the TiO2 IOPCs. A number of UC emission lines can be observed for both the samples, extending from the near ultraviolet to the near-infrared region. The two lines in the near ultraviolet region are assigned to 1I6–3F4 (354 nm) and 1D2–3H6 (367 nm) of Tm3+, the lines in the blue region are derived from 1D2–3F4 (457 nm) and 1G4–3H6 (484 nm) transitions, and the lines within the red to infrared region are attributed to the transitions of 1G4–3F4 (653 nm), 3F2–3H6 (703 nm), and 3F3–3H6 (731 nm). The inset of Fig. 3 shows the schematic of UC population and emission processes of NaYF4:Tm3+,Yb3+ under the excitation of the 980 nm laser diode.29 As can be seen from the inset of Fig. 3, the populations on 1I6, 1D2, and 1G4 originate from a five-photon process, a four-photon process, and a three-photon process, respectively, while the populations on 3F2 and 3F3 both are from a two-photon process. In contrast to the 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NC thin film on the glass, the overall UCL intensity of the composite film increases by more than 43-fold.

To determine the mechanism of UC enhancement, we first recorded the UCL spectra under the excitation of a 980 nm laser with different powers on the sample of 35 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NC/TiO2 IOPC composite films and the corresponding NC film. It should be noted that the EFs we mentioned in this paper are all corrected by the relative thickness, which can be expressed as, (2)where Ii and Di stand for the intensity and the thickness of the samples, respectively. Fig. 4(a) shows the dependence of EF on different UC transitions (1I6–3F4, 1D2–3H6 + 1D2–3F4, and 1G4–3H6 + 1G4–3F4) and excitation power. It can be seen that while the excitation power was fixed at a certain value, the higher the excited level was, the larger the EF under the same excitation power will be. This definitely reveals that the UC enhancement is probably associated with the enhancement of the excitation light due to the modulation of PCs. It can also be seen that for all the transitions, the EF gradually decreased with the increase of excitation power. The EF of the overall integrated intensity from 300 nm to 750 nm gradually decreased from 17-fold to 6-fold as the power of excitation increased from 0.09 W to 0.93 W. This phenomenon was also observed in the dense composite film of silver/NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ and was attributed to the local thermal effect induced by the irradiation of a laser diode.25 As is well known, the intensity ratio (RHS) of 3F2–3H6 to 3F3–3H6 is sensitive to temperature and is a critical parameter to determine the temperature change in UCL processes due to the energy gap of 3F3 and 3F2. According to the Boltzmann distribution and the value of RHS, the local temperature as a function of excitation power of the samples can be deduced, as shown in Fig. 4(b). It is obvious that while under the identical excitation power, the temperature of the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2 composite film increases much higher than that of the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ film. The improvement of the local thermal temperature of the composite film would induce thermal quenching of the UCL, resulting in the decrease of EF with the increasing excitation power.

The UCL integrated intensity of the transitions of 1G4–3H6, 1D2–3F4, and 1I6–3F4 as a function of excitation power was also recorded and the ln–ln plots are shown in Fig. 4(c)–(e), respectively. Generally, for UC, the UCL intensity (IUCL) is proportional to the infrared excitation power (IP): IUCL ∝ IPn where n is the number of IR photons absorbed per visible photon emitted.30 In Fig. 4(c)–(e) for the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ thin film the slopes n of the UCL are n = 1.79 for three-photon 1G4–3H6, n = 2.17 for four-photon 1D2–3F4, and n = 2.64 for five-photon 1I6–3F4. The slopes n for the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+/TiO2 IOPC composite film are slightly lower (n = 1.31 for 1G4–3H6, n = 1.44 for 1D2–3F4, and n = 1.77 for 1I6–3F4). For any multi-photon process, the slope n is approximately equal to the photon number in general case, nevertheless, the values of n are all much smaller than the required photon numbers to populate the corresponding excited levels, which can be attributed to saturation effects of the UC processes.31 The saturation effect, which causes n to deviate from the theoretical photon number, depends on the competition between linear decay and UC processes for the depletion of the intermediate excited states. If the linear decay is dominant, the slope will be close to the theoretical value, whereas if the UC is dominant, the slope will be lower than the theoretical value. Therefore, the decrease of slope n in the composite film indicates that the saturation effect occurs more easily than in the NaYF4 film due to the modulation of TiO2 IOPCs. It is suggested that the structure of the TiO2 IOPCs allows the enhanced scattering of the 980 nm laser, which equals to enhance the excitation power for the composite film and more conducive to the UC process, leading to the increased saturation effect.
Furthermore, we measured the size-dependence and photonic stop band (PSB)-dependence of the UCL intensity of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ thin films and NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NC/TiO2 IOPC composite films on the same conditions. The EF versus the particle size of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs in the composite film is shown in Fig. 5(a). Note that the UCNCs with different sizes were all composited on the TiO2 IOPCs with the PSB of 650 nm. As can be seen, the EF increases remarkably with the decreasing particle size of NaYF4 on the composite film. As the particle size decreases from 50 nm to 5 nm, the EF gradually increases from 3 fold to 43 fold. As described in the above section, the thickness of the NaYF4 layer for the 50 nm NaYF4/TiO2 composite film is 3.8 times that of the 50 nm NaYF4/TiO2 composite film (see Table 1). More excitation laser should be absorbed by the NaYF4 layer when it passes through the thicker film. As a consequence, the residual light being scattered by the IOPCs reduces, resulting in the decrease of EF with the increase of NaYF4 particle size. In our previous work, we fabricated the porous structure of the silver film/NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ composite and observed a similar size-dependent UC enhancement. It was mainly attributed to the decrease in the interaction distance between the surface plasmon of silver and the UCNCs.25
 Fig. 5  (a) The size-dependence of the UCL EF and (b) the dependence of the UC EF as a function of PSB of TiO2 IOPCs. 

Fig. 5(b) shows the dependence of the overall EF as a function of PSB location. The IOPCs with different PSBs were all composited with the 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs. The inset shows the transmittance spectra of various TiO2 IOPCs, which indicate that the PSB can be tuned in the range of 400–1000 nm, which is allowed to overlap with the emission and excitation lines of Tm3+. However, the depth of the PSB is shallow, ranging from only 2–3% in transmittance. It is apparent that as the PSB changes, the EF changes randomly in the range of 39 to 47, regardless of whether the PSB is overlapping with the emission field or the excitation field of Tm3+. In our previous work, we studied the coupling of PMMA opal PCs with deep PSB (more than 50% in transmittance) to the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ composite film and observed that the EF depends strongly on PSB. An optimum was obtained as its PSB was tuned to ∼980 nm, exactly overlapping with the excitation light.24 In the present case, because of the shallow PSB of the TiO2 IOPCs, the PSB effect is not obvious. The UC enhancement could be mainly attributed to random diffraction of the TiO2 multi-layer structure to the excitation light.
In order to further understand the mechanism of the UC enhancement, the UCL dynamic processes of the excited states 1G4–3H6 for Tm3+ ions in different samples were performed at room temperature. All the dynamic curves exhibit the same trends, namely, after an initial rise; the intensity of luminescence reaches a maximum and then decays following an exponential process. The curves can be well fitted by the following equation:32 (3)where τD and τR represent the exponential decay and rising time constants, respectively, and ID and IR are both the positive constants. It should be highlighted that τD is dominated by the depopulation of electrons at the emitting level, which mainly depends on the radiative and non-radiative transition rates of the 1G4 level for Tm3+ ions, while τR is dominated by the population complement on 1G4, which strongly depends on the ET rate from the Yb3+ to the 1G4 level.

Fig. 6 demonstrates the rising and the decay time constants of the 1G4–3H6 for Tm3+ ions under the excitation of the 980 nm laser in the thin film samples prepared with different NaYF4 NCs. It can be clearly distinguished that as the size of the NaYF4 NCs decreases from 50 nm to 5 nm, τD and τR both gradually decrease. This can be ascribed to the increase of large vibrational modes such as –OH involved on the surface of the NCs and their contribution to the nonradiative transitions.33Fig. 6 also demonstrates that τR and τD for the composite film rarely change in comparison to those for the pure NaYF4 film. This suggests that the existence of the TiO2 IOPC layer in the composites do not change the radiative and nonradiative transition rates of 1G4 and the other emission levels for Tm3+. Based on all the facts above, we can conclude that the UC enhancement in NaYF4/TiO2 composites is mainly due to the scattering of TiO2 IOPCs layer by layer under the incident excitation light of 980 nm.

Note that we also fabricated 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/TiO2 composite films and the EF of the overall UCL intensity (integrated from 300 to 750 nm) was 41-fold compared with the pure 5 nm-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ film, which was similar to the case of NaYF4:Yb,Tm. It is also important to point out that in the NaYF4/TiO2 composite the remarkable visible enhancement for Er3+ or Tm3+ can be obtained not only under the excitation of an infrared laser but also under the excitation of visible light, under the conditions of downconversion (DC) luminescence and photoluminescence. Fig. 7(a) shows the EF factor of Er3+ photoluminescence under the excitation of light with different wavelengths in the 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/TiO2 composite film (PSB ∼ 650 nm). The dependence of EF on the excitation wavelength ranging from 440–500 nm is for 4S3/2–4I15/2 transition, and ranging from 500–540 nm is for 4F9/2–4I15/2 transition. It can be observed that the average EF is 4.7 under the excitation wavelength of 440–450 nm, 7.5 of 480–490 nm and 14.3 of 500–540 nm. It is very interesting to observe that the EF depends strongly on the wavelength of excitation light. The longer the excitation wavelength is, the larger the EF will be. This fact can be well understood from the reflection spectra of the TiO2 IOPCs with different PSBs, as shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be observed that the narrower reflection of PSBs can be observed besides the sample with the PSB of 980 nm, and the reflection strength of PSB varies randomly. Besides the contribution of the PSB, totally to say, the reflectance gradually increases with the increasing wavelength, for all the samples. Because the UC enhancement is induced by the scattering of TiO2 IOPCs to the excitation light and roughly to say, the diffraction/reflection of the TiO2 IOPCs increases with the increasing wavelength, thus the EF increases with the increasing wavelength. It should be highlighted that the EFs under visible excitation are much smaller than those under 980 nm excitation, which can be attributed to the following two reasons. First, the diffraction/reflection increases with the increase of wavelength. Second, for visible excitation, the emissions for Er3+ originate from the one-photon process, while for 980 nm excitation, the emissions for the transitions of 4S3/2–4I15/2 and 4F9/2–4I15/2 both come from a two-photon process, in which UCL is generally proportional to the square of excitation power.34

3.3 Detection of avidin with NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+/TiO2 IOPC composite films
The solid-state biosensor based on UCNCs is desirable, which is very convenient for the detection and can be easily operated. However, it is difficult to be realized due to the confliction of a larger surface area and smaller particle size of UCNCs with stronger UCL. In the present work, the composite films consisting of smaller NaYF4 UCNCs and TiO2 IOPCs, which can largely enhance the UCL of smaller UCNCs, have promise to overcome the above problems.
For biodetection applications, the NCs must be hydrophilic; the NCs we prepared earlier were synthesised in OA and ODE, which were hydrophobic organic solvents and are not water-soluble due to the lack of hydrophilic functional groups on their surfaces. Typically, additional surface-modification steps are required to link appropriate functional groups (e.g. COOH, NH2, or SH) to obtain a hydrophilic surface for further conjugation of biomolecules.35,36 The complicated procedures may affect the morphology and PL intensity of NCs, and this is disadvantageous for potential biodetection applications.20 Considering these points, in the biodetection part we developed a one-step solvothermal route to prepare amine-functionalized NaYF4:Yb/Tm NCs with PEI as a surfactant that anchors on the surface of the NCs for subsequent conjugation with biomolecules.
Amine-functionalized NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs with PEI as a capping agent were used to control the growth of NCs and to render them water-soluble and surface-functionalized. The amine groups on the surface of PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs can link with the carboxyl group of biotin (Scheme 2(a)). In addition, biotin has highly specific interaction with avidin, which has been widely applied in modern biological and medical fields.37–39 The TEM images of the as-prepared water-soluble PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs and biotinylation PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm NCs are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen that the NCs displayed in Fig. 8(a) and (b) are both uniform in size and morphology and are well-dispersed, and the average sizes of the NCs are both ∼18 nm. This indicates that biotinylation of PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs has no obvious adverse effect on the morphology. Fig. 8(c) exhibits the XRD patterns of the water-soluble PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs and biotinylation PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs. It can be seen that the samples are in the cubic phase both before and after modification with biotin.

(c) XRD patterns of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs before and after modification with biotin in contrast to the standard card for α-NaYF4. (d) FTIR spectra of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs before and after modification with biotin. 
To verify the conjugation between PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs and biotin, the as-prepared UCNCs before and after reaction were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 8(d). It can be seen that both the PEI–UCNCs and biotinylation NaYF4:Yb,Tm samples exhibit a broad band around 3441 cm−1, corresponding to N–H stretching vibration. These amine groups can link with the carboxyl group of biotin to make an amido linkage. In the biotin–PEI–UCNCs, a strong transmission band in the region around 1543 cm−1 and 1409 cm−1 can be observed, which is assigned to the internal vibration of amide bonds, indicating that the UCNCs are coated with biotin. It is worth pointing out that the biotin–PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm on the TiO2 IOPCs can also be largely enhanced versus that on the glass, and the EF is determined to be 18.4 under the excitation of 48 mW mm−2 980 nm light.
The principle of FRET detection of avidin by employing biotinylated NCs as energy donors and FITC-labeled avidin as an energy acceptor is illustrated in Scheme 2(b). Excitation of biotinylated NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NCs triggers energy transfer (ET) from Tm3+ to FITC within a given proximity through specific binding between biotin and avidin, and results in emission from FITC at its characteristic wavelength. Here FITC was selected as an energy acceptor to couple with the NCs, because it has a broad excitation band centering at 490 nm which can overlap the 1G4–3H6 emission lines of Tm3+ peaking at 484 nm (see Fig. 9(a)).
 Fig. 9  (a) Emission (blue line) spectrum of biotinylated NCs; excitation (yellow dashed line) and emission (green solid line) spectra of FITC. (b) FRET spectra of bioassay experiments at different concentrations of avidin. (c) The red dots indicate the bioassay experiments in which FITC is FRET-sensitized by biotinylated NCs through the avidin–biotin interaction and the green dots show the control experiments with FITC and no amine-enriched NCs, for which no binding and hence no FRET occurs. (d) Calibration curve of FRET detection on the IOPC (left part) and in the solution (right part) for the integrated PL intensity ratio FITC520/Tm480versus the concentration of avidin. 
As shown in Fig. 9(b), upon excitation of NCs under the 980 nm laser diode, the emission band of FITC centered at 520 nm (referred to as FITC520 hereafter) gradually increases with the increasing amount of avidin, accompanied by the decrease of the 1G4–3H6 emission band of Tm3+ centered at 480 nm (referred to as Tm480 hereafter). In order to confirm the occurrence of FRET and the specific reaction between avidin and biotin, nonbinding control experiments were performed by employing the as-prepared NCs instead of the biotinylated NCs as bioprobes under otherwise identical conditions. No obvious enhancement of FITC emission with increasing the amount of FITC in the control group can be distinguished (see Fig. 9(c)). This means that non-biotinylated NCs and FITC are far apart, and thus no FRET occurs in the control experiments. So, we can confirm that the specific interaction between biotin and avidin plays a key role in ensuring proximity between the acceptor and the donor.
The left part of Fig. 9(d) shows the curve of FITC520/Tm480 as a function of the amount of avidin measured on the composite films. The signal of FITC520/Tm480 increases steadily with the increase of the avidin concentration. There has a good linear relationship and a high sensitivity between the fluorescence intensity ratio and the concentration of avidin, R, defined as the correlation coefficient of the linear fit, is 0.996, the sensitivity is 34 pmol−1, when the concentration range is of 0–4.5 nmol. The limit of detection (LOD) is 48 pmol, according to 3s/m, where m is the slope for the range of the linearity used and s is the standard deviation.40 Note that Chen reported the time-resolved DC-FRET biosensor based on amine-functionalized NaYF4:Ce,Tb nanocrystals with a detection limit of about 5 nM.41 Additionally, the LOD of the previous results based on UC-FRET employing Y2O2S:Er/Yb as a donor and phycobiliprotein as an acceptor is 0.7–9.0 nM.42
Another control experiment was implemented by using the PBS solution containing NCs instead of the composite films as the biosensor under otherwise identical conditions. The right part of Fig. 9(d) shows that the variation trend of the signal of FITC520/Tm480 is the same as that measured on the composite film, however, the linear relationship is not very good, when the range is 0–4.5 nmol, R is fitted to be 0.979, the sensitivity is 27 pmol−1, however, the LOD of the liquid sensor is 110 pmol. These facts indicate that the UCL of NCs on the composite film is more stable and sensitive than that in the solution; meanwhile, the sensitivity of the solid-sensor is much better than the liquid-based sensor.
To further confirm the FRET process, we measured the UCL dynamic process. Fig. 10(a) shows the UCL dynamic curves of transition of 1G4–3H6 of Tm3+ under 980 nm excitation with different amounts of avidin added, which can be well fitted to a double exponential function as described in eqn (3). The constants of the rising and decay time as a function of the amount of avidin are shown in Fig. 10(b). It can be clearly seen that the decay time reduces from 197 to 131 μs with the increasing concentration of avidin from 0 to 4.5 nmol. However, the rising time is almost unchanged with the variation of the concentration. This is another piece of unambiguous evidence for the occurrence of FRET from Tm3+ to FITC. The decay lifetime of the energy donor, which is hardly affected by environmental factors such as re-absorption and the concentration of NCs, may provide another important parameter to measure the ET efficiency in FRET bioassays.

For an excellent biosensor, high photostability is very important. Therefore, the photostability of the UC composite film under illumination of 980 nm light was investigated. Meanwhile, we used DC composite films (biotin–PEI–NaYF4:5% Ce,5% Tb) under illumination of 290 nm light for comparison. After adding the same amount of the avidin–FITC, the films excited under continuous illumination using a 980 nm laser or a 290 nm lamp for 1 h. From Fig. 11, it can be seen that the emission intensity of FITC of the DC composite film decreased to 73% after illumination for 1 h, while the intensity of FITC of the UC composite film was steady under 1 h excitation. The UC film exhibiting excellent photostability is more useful in practical applications. The inset of Fig. 11 shows the emission spectra of the films added with avidin–FITC under excitation of a 980 nm laser or a 290 nm lamp.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we fabricated some novel composite films NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+(Er3+)/TiO2 IOPCs by using the self-assembly technique. By the modulation of TiO2 IOPCs, highly enhanced emissions of Tm3+/Er3+ were observed in the composite films under anti-Stokes 980 nm excitation as well as visible Stokes excitation. It is interesting to observe that the EF depends strongly on excited energy levels of Tm3+/Er3+, the excitation power of the laser diode, the particle size of NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+(Er3+) NCs for anti-Stokes 980 nm excitation and the wavelength of excitation light for visible Stokes excitation, while the EF is nearly independent of PSB. An optimum EF of 43-fold was obtained for the UCL of 5 nm NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ NC composite films using this strategy. As to the enhancement mechanism, this was mainly attributed to the random diffraction of IOPCs multi-layers to the excitation light. Moreover, based on this unique structure, specific interaction between biotin and avidin, and FRET between Tm and FITC, the UC composite film was used for detecting avidin. The system offers two parameters for detection, namely, the emission intensity and the fluorescent decay time. As a FRET solid biosensor, the sensor can efficiently detect trace amounts of avidin with a lot of advantages such as convenient detection, good linear relationship (R = 0.996), low detection limit (48 pmol), high sensitivity (34 pmol−1), and photostability, and thus may have great potential for versatile applications in biodetection.

 	Scheme 2  (a) Biotinylation of PEI-capped NaYF4 and (b) FRET detection of avidin by employing biotinylated NCs as the donor and FITC as an acceptor.	 

 	Fig. 8  (a and b) TEM images of the as-prepared water-soluble PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs and biotinylation PEI–NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs. (c) XRD patterns of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNCs before and after modification with biotin in contrast to the standard card for α-NaYF4. (d) FTIR spectra of the NaYF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs before and after modification with biotin.	 

 	Fig. 9  (a) Emission (blue line) spectrum of biotinylated NCs; excitation (yellow dashed line) and emission (green solid line) spectra of FITC. (b) FRET spectra of bioassay experiments at different concentrations of avidin. (c) The red dots indicate the bioassay experiments in which FITC is FRET-sensitized by biotinylated NCs through the avidin–biotin interaction and the green dots show the control experiments with FITC and no amine-enriched NCs, for which no binding and hence no FRET occurs. (d) Calibration curve of FRET detection on the IOPC (left part) and in the solution (right part) for the integrated PL intensity ratio FITC520/Tm480versus the concentration of avidin.	 

 	Fig. 10  (a) The curves of 1G4 of Tm3+ at different concentrations of avidin. (b) Rising and decay lifetime constants of 1G4 of Tm3+ at different concentrations of avidin.	 

 	Fig. 11  Photostability of the NaYF4:20%Yb,0.2%Tm/TiO2 UC composite film under continuous illumination by a 980 nm laser and the NaYF4:5%Ce,5%Tb/TiO2 DC composite film under continuous illumination by a 290 nm lamp for 1 h; inset: the emission spectra of the films added with avidin–FITC under excitation of a 980 nm laser or a 290 nm lamp.
