    , Accepted 1st August 2014First published on 5th August 2014AbstractGraphene-based nanocomposites have been demonstrated to be promising high-capacity anodes for lithium ion batteries to satisfy the ever-growing demands for higher capacity, longer cycle life and better high-rate performance. Synergetic effects between graphene and the introduced second-phase component are generally observed. In this feature review article, we will focus on the recent work on four different categories of graphene-based nanocomposite anodes by us and others: graphene-transitional metal oxide, graphene–Sn/Si/Ge, graphene–metal sulfide, and graphene–carbon nanotubes. For the supported materials on graphene, we will emphasize the non-zero dimensional (non-particle) morphologies such as two dimensional nanosheet/nanoplate and one dimensional nanorod/nanofibre/nanotube morphologies. The synthesis strategies and lithium-ion storage properties of these highlighted electrode morphologies are distinct from those of the commonly obtained zero dimensional nanoparticles. We aim to stress the importance of structure matching in the composites and their morphology-dependent lithium-storage properties and mechanisms.Weiwei SunWeiwei Sun was born in 1982 and received her BS degree (2004) in chemistry from Shanxi Normal University and Ph.D. (2009) in chemistry from East China Normal University.

1 Introduction
With the increasing demand for ever-growing energy consumption, renewable energy sources and efficient energy conversion have attracted tremendous attention. Electrical energy storage systems have been regarded as a suitable solution for efficient electricity use in micro-grids or smart-grids. Among various devices, the lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been widely used as an attractive power source for popular mobile devices with many outstanding features including high energy density, no memory effect, long cycle life and environmental friendliness.1–5 However, the current LIB technology cannot satisfy the ever-growing demand for large-scale applications such as electric vehicles and scalable electricity storage. Advanced electrode materials with higher energy density and power density must be explored. Among the potential anode materials for LIBs, a variety of metals,6–15 metal oxides,13–37 and metal sulfides,38–44 have been proposed and have attracted more and more attention because their theoretical capacities are higher than those of commercial graphite anodes. Different categories of nanostructured electrode materials for LIBs have been reviewed.6,8,13,16–20 These high-capacity anodes often suffer from poor cycliability and high-rate performances. This is mainly due to the poor electrical conductivity and large volume change that occur during cycling, which leads to electrode pulverization and the loss of the electrical contact.
In the past decade, various carbonaceous materials including graphite, meso/micro-porous carbon and carbon nanotubes,45–49 have been used as the matrix to support high-capacity electrodes, and such carbon-supported composites usually exhibit improved cycle life and higher performance rates compared to their unsupported counterparts and enhanced capacity compared to carbons.6,17,18
Graphene, which was discovered in 2004,50 is a single atomic planar two dimensional (2D) sheet that possesses unique physical and chemical properties.51–53 The synthesis approaches and properties of graphene nanosheets (GNS) or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been reviewed in great detail in previous articles54–56 and will not be described here. Compared with other carbonaceous materials, graphene shows unique merits such as a large theoretical specific surface area of 2620 m2 g−1, which is much higher than that of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphite. Moreover, the high quality of the sp2 carbon lattice of the layer-by-layer graphene structure is very helpful for ballistic electron movement in the graphene layer even at ambient temperature.54–56 Due to its unique single-atom layered structure, excellent electronic conductivity, strong mechanical strength, high flexibility, and good optical transparency, graphene nanosheets (GNS) have been applied in the field of energy harvesting and storage in devices including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), solar cells, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.57–62 In particular, graphene was first reported as an anode for LIBs with a reversible capacity of 540 mA h g−1,57 and that study was followed by a number of reports using different synthesis strategies for graphene with Li-ion storage capacities of ∼400–1100 mA h g−1.58–61 Because some of the reported capacities are substantially larger than the theoretical capacity of single-layer graphene (744 mA h g−1 based on Li2C6), various mechanisms have been suggested for lithium ion storage such as the effects of both sides of graphene, micropores/defects, the expanded layer-spacing, layer edges, covalent sites, faradic capacitance, etc.60–63 Meanwhile graphene can function as an ideal single-atom thick substrate for the growth of functional nanomaterials,62,63 and it can also render them electrochemically more active. Unfortunately, easy restacking, large capacity loss in long cycles and poor dispersion in common solvents significantly restrict the use of graphene as the anode for LIBs. Thus, ongoing research efforts focus on converting graphene sheets into functionalized graphene structures with different dimensions and on the introduction of the second-phase component (usually active high-capacity compounds) to prevent the restacking of few-layer GNS. When graphene-based composites are used as electrode materials for LIBs, the following advantages are usually expected and demonstrated: (1) graphene nanosheets (GNS) can provide an elastic buffer space to accommodate the volume expansion/contraction of the supported materials during the Li insertion/extraction process; (2) the 2D GNS structure can act as the support to immobilize the supported materials upon repetitive cycling and prevent their agglomeration; (3) GNS can increase the electrical conductivity of the supported materials and shorten the diffusion distance for electrons and lithium ions; (4) the porosity and defects generated in the composite can increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area and provide more active sites for lithium reaction and storage; and (5) except for the beneficial effect of graphene on the supported high-capacity electrode materials, on the other hand, the latter can be regarded as a spacer to prevent the restacking of graphene into thick graphite platelets. Therefore, the promising properties associated with a few-layer graphene structure can be preserved during repetitive cycling.
In this feature article, we summarize and provide critical discussions on the recent developments of graphene-supported nanocomposites for lithium ion storage including their synthesis strategies, morphological tuning and electrochemical performance. Depending on the distinct lithium storage mechanisms, four different types of graphene-supported nanomaterials: graphene-supported transitional metal oxides, graphene-supported Sn/Si/Ge-based oxides/alloys, graphene-supported metal sulfides and graphene–carbon nanotube based composites are presented. The supported materials often display different morphologies such as zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticle, one-dimensional (1D) nanorod/nanofibre/nanotube, two dimensional (2D) nanosheet/nanoplate, and three dimensional (3D) morphologies such as a nanoflower. The 0D nanoparticle morphology is the most common product morphology for almost all kinds of electrodes due to its facile synthesis. In this review article, we place more emphasis on the graphene-supported 1D, 2D and 3D nanostructures due to their advantages regarding carefully-crafted morphological control, excellent structure affinity with graphene and generally good electrochemical properties.
2 Graphene-supported transitional metal oxides
Triggered by the report of Poizot et al.,14 transitional metal oxides have been extensively studied as anode materials for LIBs.27,28,32–37 A novel mechanism of “conversion reaction” has been identified, which is the reversible redox reaction between lithium and transitional metal oxides, as described below.MxOy + 2ye− + 2yLi+ ↔ x[M]0 + yLi2O
When M is a transitional metal such as Ni, Co, Cu, Fe or Mn, the final product would be a homogeneous distribution of metal nanoparticles embedded in a Li2O matrix. Catalyzed by the transitional metal, the reversible Li2O decomposition reaction provides outstanding lithium storage capability.14 Transitional metal oxides can offer intriguing gravimetric capacities, which are two to three times as large as that of commercial graphite (372 mA h g−1).28 The lithium insertion and extraction occur at a more positive voltage (∼0.5–2 V), which can reduce the safety concern of lithium plating, but the battery power is also reduced. The major drawback with this class of materials is an unsatisfactory cycling performance, which is ascribed to the volume expansion during lithium insertion and their poor electronic conductivity.32–37 Generally, nanostructured electrodes of transitional metal oxides can achieve significantly improved electrochemical properties compared with bulk transitional metal oxides. With the introduction of graphene as a perfect matrix to support transitional metal oxides, the graphene-supported composites show further improved cycling performances and high-rate performances.28
2.1 Nickel oxide
Nickel oxide (NiO), with a large theoretical capacity of 718 mA h g−1, high safety, and low cost, has been proposed as a promising anode material for LIBs among transitional metal oxides.27,28 In the past decade, there have been a number of reports concerning graphene-supported NiO composites with various structures, such as NiO nanoparticles,64–67 NiO nanosheet/nanoplates68–74 and 3D NiO carnations.75
NiO nanosheets were first prepared on graphene nanosheets (GNS) by a facile hydrothermal method, and NiO nanoparticles were obtained by a similar process by using graphene oxide (GO) instead of GNS.68 A schematic of the growth process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. It is believed that NiO crystal growth is significantly affected by abundant oxygen-containing groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl (confirmed by XPS) on GO, which hinders nuclei growth into nanosheet structure. In such NiO-graphene sheet-on-sheet composites, a few NiO nanosheets with the size of 0.5–2 μm and thickness of 30–50 nm can be uniformly dispersed on GNS (Fig. 1b) by a possible binding interaction between residual carboxyl and/or hydroxyl groups of GNS and hydrated NiO. Fig. 1c shows a uniform dispersion of 2–5 nm NiO nanoparticles on GNS. A synergetic effect between GNS and NiO nanosheets can be demonstrated for Li-ion storage applications. The NiO–graphene sheet-on-sheet structure shows large reversible capacities (1056–1031 mA h g−1 in 40 cycles at 71.8 mA g−1) and excellent rate capabilities [large capacities of 872, 657, and 492 mA h g−1 at large current rates of 718 mA g−1 (1 C), 1436 mA g−1 (2 C) and 3590 mA g−1 (5 C), respectively]. These electrochemical performances are much better than those of bare NiO nanosheets or NiO–graphene particle-on-sheet composites as shown in Fig. 1e. It is proposed that the NiO nanosheet is a better “separator” material than nanoparticles regarding the separation and stabilization of GNS due to a larger contact area between these two types of similar 2D structures in sheet-on-sheet composites. Moreover, nanoparticles are more inclined to be aggregated compared to nanosheets with micrometer sizes. The sheet-like NiO structure has been demonstrated to remain intact after cycling as indicated in Fig. 1d.

GNS-supported porous NiO nanosheets/nanoplates also deliver outstanding electrochemical performances, confirming the synergistic effect between the porous 2D structure and conductive graphene.72–74 As reported in the article of Huang et al.,72 a unique ultrathin porous NiO nanosheets–graphene composite can be successfully self-assembled (Fig. 2a and b). A large reversible capacity of 1098 mA h g−1 is retained after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 with a good rate capability (615 mA h g−1 at 4 A g−1) (Fig. 2c and d). Xie and co-workers also reported a porous NiO nanosheet-wrapped GNS composite, which delivers a first-cycle charge capacity of 1467 mA h g−1 and retains reversible capacity up to 705 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current of 200 mA g−1.74

The binding effect between NiO nanosheets and oxygenated graphene or graphene is very important for the stable sheet-on-sheet composite, which is explored by Zhou and co-workers.70 The calculated adsorption energies are 1.37 and 1.84 eV for a Ni atom on oxygenated graphene with hydroxyl and epoxy, and 1.26 eV on graphene. More importantly, the corresponding calculated diffusion barriers (2.23 and 1.69 eV) of the Ni adatom on the oxygenated graphene surface are substantially larger than that on the graphene (0.19 eV). This indicates the C–O–Ni bridge works as an effective medium to anchor NiO nanosheets strongly onto graphene, which leads to a high reversible capacity and excellent cycling performance. Therefore, by such a strong binding effect, the flexible and highly-conductive graphene can significantly improve the mechanical stability and electrical conductivity of the supported NiO materials.
A single 3D carnation-like NiO structure is grown on graphene by Tao and co-workers.75 The obtained 3D hierarchical NiO–graphene composite exhibits a high reversible lithium storage capacity of 1065 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1. The remarkable improvement in electrochemical performance has been attributed to the decrease in the volume expansion and contraction of NiO and the improvement in the electronic conductivity by the presence of graphene.
2.2 Cobalt oxide
For the GNS-supported cobalt oxides (Co3O4 and CoO), a variety of cobalt oxide morphologies including the GNS-0D structure (nanoparticle),76–83 GNS-1D structure (nanofibre84 and nanorod/nanowire85–87), and GNS-2D (nanosheet/nanoplate)88–92 can be obtained by different synthesis approaches. The physical contact area between these morphologies and GNS sheets can be regarded as point-to-point, line-to-line, and face-to-face, respectively. The face-to-face contact should be more stable for immobilizing the supported cobalt oxides on graphene by providing more contact area. Therefore, the GNS-2D structure (nanosheet/nanoplate) generally delivers a more pronounced synergetic effect. For example, better Li-ion storage performances are observed due to the strong interfacial interactions between the supported 2D materials and GNS.
By a microwave-assisted synthesis method (Fig. 3a), porous Co3O4 nanosheets can be fabricated on GNS to form a sheet-on-sheet nanostructure.88 As shown in SEM (Fig. 3b) and TEM images (Fig. 3c), the micrometer-sized porous Co3O4 nanosheet structure is observed with pore sizes of 60–100 nm and a thickness around 100 nm. From the cycling performance comparison among GO, GNS, and the Co3O4–GNS sheet-on-sheet composites indicated in Fig. 3d, the Co3O4–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite shows the most prominent performance with an initial charge capacity of 1235 mA h g−1 and a high charge capacity of 1065 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles. Meanwhile, a capacity of 931 mA h g−1 is observed at a large current rate of 5 C (4450 mA g−1) for the sheet-on-sheet structure. This capacity is still larger than the theoretical value of pristine Co3O4 (890 mA h g−1). The observed higher-than-theoretical reversible capacity has been attributed to the lithium storage in nanocavities/defects in porous Co3O4–GNS composites and a possible Faradic capacitance on the surface or edge planes.

The sheet-on-sheet structure can be fabricated as a free-standing cobalt oxide–GNS film through vacuum filtration and thermal treatment processes.89 This film is self-assembled via electrostatic interactions between cobalt oxide nanosheets and GNS.89 The cross-sectional SEM images shown in Fig. 4a and b show that cobalt oxide nanosheets and GNS are tightly aligned in parallel to form an ordered layer structure in both Co3O4–GNS and CoO–GNS composites. However, the relative loosely stacked layered structure with abundant open voids and the porous Co3O4 nanosheets with a pore size of several nanometers existing in the Co3O4–GNS film can deliver significantly increased surface area. Therefore, the binder-free composite film achieves significant enhancement in Li-ion storage performance (∼1400 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1) and cycling stability (∼1200 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles), which are better than those of the traditional cobalt oxide–GNS composite in the presence of binder and carbon black (Fig. 4c and d). As another type of 2D structure, very thin Co3O4 nanoplates with diameters of ∼20 nm and thicknesses of 1–2 nm are also prepared on graphene.92 These nanoplate-on-sheet composites can deliver a large reversible capacity of 880 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles at a current rate of 3 C.

1D cobalt oxide morphologies are also prepared on GNS to form nanofibre-on-sheet84 composites and nanowire/nanorod-on-sheet85–87 composites. GO is mixed with the electrospun Co3O4 nanofibers to form a Co3O4–GNS composite paper by vacuum filtering, followed by hydrazine reduction.84 In the absence of binder and carbon black, this film is directly used as an anode for LIB and shows a high reversible capacity of 840 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles and a good rate capability. A number of Co3O4 nanorods (∼500 nm in length and ∼50 nm in diameter) are grown on graphene by a hydrothermal method. The composite shows a reversible capacity of 907 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and a retained capacity of 844 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.85 Co3O4 nanorods with a large aspect ratio (30 nm in diameter and 1–2 μm in length) are obtained on GNS by a one-pot solvothermal method.87 Very large reversible capacities of 1310 mA h g−1 and 1090 mA h g−1 are retained after 40 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively.
2.3 Copper oxide
CuO material has been used as the active anode material mainly due to its high theoretical lithium storage capacity (670 mA h g−1), but its practical application is hindered by its fast capacity loss.33,34,93–101 Recently, GNS-supported CuO nanocomposites with various nano/microstructures (nanoparticle-on-sheet,94,95 nanorod-on-sheet,96 spindle97/shuttle98-on-sheet, sheet-on-sheet,97,99 flower-on-sheet,100 and urchin-on-sheet98,101) have been successfully synthesized. It is worth noting that GNS–CuO with 2D nanosheets,97,99 urchin/shuttle-like structures,98,101 and hollow nanoparticles93 show good lithium storage performances.
By similar solution-based synthesis approaches with different heating sources, reaction temperatures and solvents (Fig. 5a), three types of GNS-supported CuO composites with controlled morphologies (CuO–GNS sheet-on-sheet,97 CuO–GNS shuttle-on-sheet,98 and CuO–GNS urchin-on-sheet98) have been obtained. TEM and HRTEM images of a CuO–GNS shuttle-on-sheet composite as indicated in Fig. 5b–d illustrate that crystalline shuttle-like CuO nanostructures are uniformly distributed on GNS, forming a layer-by-layer structure, and this unique structure achieves highly-desired electrochemical performance with a very large capacity of 826 mA h g−1 that is retained after 100 cycles at a large current of 700 mA g−1. The TEM image in Fig. 5e shows that CuO nanosheets are surrounded by GNS in the CuO–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite, while the urchin-like CuO nanostructures composed of numerous CuO nanoparticle nanoribbons 20–30 nm in diameter in the urchin-on-sheet composite are shown in Fig. 5f. Under similar test conditions, the CuO–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite shows the best electrochemical performance97 and the shuttle-on-sheet displays better performance than the urchin-on-sheet structure.98 Therefore, the 2D CuO nanosheet is believed to be a perfect structure for use in composites with 2D GNS.

GNS-supported CuO nanosheets can be also fabricated into a hybrid lamellar paper through vacuum filtration and hydrothermal reduction.99 A large capacity of 737 mA h g−1 can be retained after 50 cycles, which is much larger than those of bare GNS film paper (60 mA h g−1) and pristine CuO nanosheets (219 mA h g−1) after same number of cycles. Moreover, a flower-like CuO–graphene composite100 has been obtained by a hydrothermal technique. These nanoflowers are composed of CuO nanosheets with an average diameter of 4.2 μm. The flower-on-sheet composite shows a reversible capacity of 603 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C and 382 mA h g−1 at 1 C.
An urchin-like CuO–graphene composite is also reported to be obtained by a simple solution method in the report by Wang et al.101 Urchin-like CuO clusters with an average diameter of 1.5 μm are uniformly wrapped by a thin graphene layer (Fig. 6a and b). The composite exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with very stable reversible capacities of ∼600 mA h g−1 at a current density of 65 mA g−1 over 100 cycles (Fig. 6c and d).101 The improvement in electrochemical properties has been mainly ascribed to the unique CuO urchin-like morphology and the electrically conductive graphene network, which can function as an elastic buffer.

2.4 Iron oxide
Fe2O3, a promising anode candidate for lithium ion batteries, possesses a high theoretical specific capacity of ∼1005 mA h g−1. However, it exhibits poor electronic conductivity and poor cycling performance upon long cycles.35–37 The involvement of GNS in Fe2O3 systems has been proven to be an effective strategy, which offers increased mechanical stability, improved electrical contact and facilitated lithium diffusion.102–118 Although a large number of studies have been reported on GNS-supported iron oxides composites, most reports focus on GNS-supported Fe2O3 nanoparticles102–109 or Fe3O4 nanoparticles.111–114 Non-particle iron oxide morphologies such as the nanosheet,115 nanorod116 or nanorice110/spindle117,118 morphologies have recently attracted more interest in the preparation of composites with GNS and showed improved structure-related Li-ion storage properties.
A fast microwave-assisted hydrothermal technique is used to fabricate a Fe2O3–GNS rice-on-sheet nanocomposite,110 in which Fe2O3 nanorice is observed with a length of 200 nm and diameters in a range of ∼40 nm in the middle part to only 3–5 nm in the tip (Fig. 7a). Large reversible charge capacities of 825, 762, and 633 mA h g−1 are observed at large currents of 1, 2, and 5 C (1 C = 1000 mA g−1), respectively. A high capacity of 582 mA h g−1 at 1 C can be retained after 100 cycles. Compared to the particle-on-sheet composite, the Fe2O3–GNS rice-on-sheet composite exhibits a more stable cycle life (Fig. 7b). A similar Fe2O3–GNS nanospindle-on-sheet composite is prepared by a facile solvothermal method.117 The obtained composite shows a large reversible capacity of 969 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1.117 A mixture of Fe2O3 1D nanorods and nanoparticles is prepared on graphene by a hydrothermal route.116 The composite can deliver an initial capacity of 771 mA h g−1, which is retained at 565 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles at a current rate of 0.1 C.116 The poor reversible capacity can be ascribed to the presence of a large amount of Fe2O3 nanoparticles.

As shown in Fig. 7c, we also fabricate a unique Fe2O3–GNS sheet-on-sheet nanostructure by a solvothermal technique.115 The obtained Fe2O3 nanosheets are surrounded by GNS, forming a sandwich-like nanocomposite. As confirmed by BET measurements, the sheet-on-sheet composite exhibits a large surface area of 174 m2 g−1, which is more than two times as large as that of the particle-on-sheet composite with the same Fe2O3 loading. It is indicated that GNS is separated better by Fe2O3 nanosheets than Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The Fe2O3–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite exhibits a high reversible capacity of 1075 mA h g−1 with good cycling performance at 0.1 C and high reversible capacities of 622, 456, and 323 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at high current rates of 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively. Notably, the corresponding particle-on-sheet composites can be easily obtained by adding a structure directing agent110 or varying the reaction solvent.115 These particle-on-sheet composites with the same weight ratio of Fe2O3 to GNS are benchmarked as rice-on-sheet and sheet-on-sheet composites. The latter two composites show much better Li-ion storage properties than the corresponding particle-on-sheet composites under exactly the same test conditions (Fig. 7b and d).
A flexible free-standing porous Fe3O4–GNS film paper is fabricated by a vacuum filtration technique,118 in which hollow Fe3O4 nanospindles are embedded into the GNS network to expand the interlayer space between the GNS layers, as shown in Fig. 8a and b. The special hollow structure allows the Fe3O4–GNS composite (39.6 wt% graphene) to deliver a high specific capacity of 1555 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and enhanced rate capabilities of 940 and 660 mA h g−1 at 200 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. The outstanding lithium-ion storage properties have been mainly attributed to the improved electrical contact of Fe3O4 by the three dimensional graphene network and the shortened pathway for both lithium ions and electrons in the porous electrode, in which volume change can be accommodated and electrolyte penetration can be facilitated. Notably, the electrochemical performance of the Fe3O4–graphene film paper without binder are much better than that of the traditional Fe3O4–GNS electrode with additional PVDF binder and carbon black as a conductive agent (Fig. 8c and d). This improved electrochemical property has been mainly ascribed to the reduced resistance and enhanced electrode reaction kinetics in the film electrode.118

2.5 Other transitional metal oxides
There are still a number of reports on other GNS-supported transitional metal oxides, such as manganese oxides,119–131 titanium oxides,132–146 vanadium oxides,147–163 molybdenum oxides,164–175 and zinc oxides,176–178 with applications as anode materials for LIBs. For GNS-based manganese oxides composites anodes, 0D nanoparticles,119–125 2D nanosheets126/nanoplates,127 and 1D nanoneedles128/nanorods129/nanotubes130 are all fabricated on GNS and explored for their Li-ion storage properties. Notably, crumpled graphene spheres with a 3D open structure are prepared by capillary force induced by fast solvent loss in an aerosolization process and used to support Mn3O4.123 Stable large reversible capacities of ∼900 mA h g−1 are achieved for Mn3O4–GNS sheet-on-sheet126 and particle-on-sheet119 composites. The most outstanding performance comes from the graphene supported ultrafine MnO nanoparticles.131 An extremely large reversible capacity as high as 2014 mA h g−1 can be observed after 150 cycles at 200 mA g−1. This reversible capacity should be the largest one among all transitional metal oxides and their derivatives reported so far. The interfacial lithium ion storage, reconstructed nanostructure and interconnected graphene composite framework have been suggested as main causes for the distinguished synergetic effect. The shortened transportation length for Li ions and electrons and the facilitated kinetics of the conversion reaction also result in excellent high-rate performances.
Different from other transitional metal oxides, TiO2 displays a lithium insertion/extraction mechanism with the advantage of negligible structure variation during lithium intercalation and deintercalation.18 In spite of its low theoretical capacity (337 mA h g−1), TiO2 has been proposed as a promising anode for electrical vehicles due to its stable structure, good safety and fast discharge and charge kinetics for modified TiO2 with improved electronic conductivity and more exposed energetic facets. The presence of graphene can improve the poor electronic conductivity of TiO2 anodes, thus enabling better high-rate performances. TiO2–GNS composites with various structures have been reported, including 0D TiO2 nanoparticles,132–138 2D TiO2 nanosheets,139–142 1D nanobelts143/nanorods144/nanotubes,145 and 3D TiO2 nanoflowers.146 It should be noted that a unique TiO2–GNS nanobelt-sheet hybrid nanostructure143 shows outstanding electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh reversible capacity (over 430 mA h g−1 at 0.15 A g−1) and a superior high-rate capability (210 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1) among various TiO2-based anodes.
3 Graphene–Sn/Si/Ge-based nanocomposites
Sn/Si/Ge-based anode materials such as Sn-based alloys, Sn/Si/Ge-based oxides and Sn/Si/Ge-based composites have been studied extensively in the literature.7,8,10–13,28–30 Tin (Sn) shows a high theoretical specific capacity of ∼990 mA h g−1, while that of silicon (Si) is 4200 mA h g−1 because each Sn/Si can alloy and de-alloy with a maximum 4.4 Li. In comparison, every six carbon atoms can only intercalate one lithium. Because Sn is easily oxidized in air, SnO2 is usually obtained and explored for Li-ion storage properties.10–13,28–30 During the first cycle of lithium insertion, tin oxide is reduced to Sn metal and Li2O. It is worth pointing out that the obtained Li2O is usually believed to be impossible to decompose reversibly, which is different from transitional metal oxides. A large irreversible capacity loss is associated with this irreversible reaction. Upon the following cycles, tin oxide follows a similar Li alloying and de-alloying storage mechanism indicated in the reversible reaction as described below:MxOy + 2ye− + 2yLi+ → x[M]0 + yLi2OM + ze− + zLi+ ↔LizM
The crucial problem with Sn/Si/Ge-based anodes is the huge volume change during the lithium insertion and extraction processes (for example, ∼300% volume expansion for Sn). This would lead to the electrode pulverization and subsequent fast capacity loss for this class of anode materials. The use of graphene to support Sn/Si/Ge has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to solve this problem. The large volume change can be accommodated by flexible and conductive graphene. The suitable dispersion of a Sn/Si/Ge-based anode among graphene nanosheets can also be helpful for keeping graphene nanosheet separated. Among various GNS supported Sn-based materials, as summarized with their lithium storage properties in Table 1, metallic tin tends to form a 0D nanoparticle179–185 or 1D nanorod/nanowire186–188 or nanopillar189 structure and a single example of 2D nanosheet morphology,190 but tin oxide can exhibit a variety of morphologies such as nanoparticles,191–219 nanosheets,220,221 nanorods/nanowires,222–224 and nanoflowers.225 The SnO2@C core–shell structure202,217,218 is also adopted to improve the electrical contact and accommodate the volume expansion of Sn core by a layer of disordered carbon shell. A large reversible capacity of 757 mA h g−1 is achieved for the core–shell electrode structure after 150 cycles at 200 mA g−1.218 Furthermore, there are a few Sn-based alloys reported on graphene226–231 and only Sn-based alloy-GNS nanoparticle-on-sheet morphology can be obtained due to the difficult control of the bimetallic crystal structure (Table 1). In general, among numerous GNS supported Sn-based nanocomposite anode materials, Sn/SnO2 tends to form nanoparticle-like morphologies, which are proposed to be supported/wrapped/encapsulated on/by/in GNS due to its flexible and curled characteristics.179–185,191–219 However, GNS-supported Sn/SnO2 materials with some special morphologies such as 1D nanorods/nanowires186–189,222–224 and 2D nanosheets190,220,221 show enhanced lithium storage properties due to strong interaction between the SnO2 nanostructure and GNS nanosheets. For example, a large reversible capacity of 1107 mA h g−1 is retained after 100 cycles for graphene-supported SnO2 nanorods at a current density of 200 mA g−1.223 It should be noted that some GNS-supported SnO2 composites with the involvement of modified graphene (such as, N-doped GNS,199,200,224,226 activated porous GNS,214 graphene aerogel,201 and graphene nanoribbons196) also exhibit wonderful electrochemical performances as the anode for lithium-ion batteries. A large capacity of 1346 mA h g−1 can be achieved for N-doped graphene supported SnO2 nanocrystals after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, and the composite also exhibits a large reversible capacity of ∼417 mA h g−1 at an extremely large current of 20 A g−1.200 Lastly, some examples of GNS-supported Sn/SnO2 nanoparticles with good control of the interaction between the two components in the composites can also achieve excellent lithium storage properties, which are also listed in Table 1.

The development of Sn-based materials with carefully crafted nanostructures is very useful to ensure good cycling performance. A unique hierarchical Sn@CNT nanostructure rooted in GNS is synthesized from the intermediate of SnS2 nanoparticles on GO sheets.186 The advantages of Sn@CNT–GNS composites can be illustrated in the growth process as indicated in Fig. 9a. The CNT overlayer around the filled Sn can offer a better electrical contact and is used to buffer and confine the volume change of Sn materials with the assistance of the GNS substrate, thus improving the structural stability of Sn during cycling. It is worth noting that the uniform CNT shells (thickness of 6–10 nm), which are filled with Sn nanorods as the filler cores and tightly integrated with GNS by the junction in such a composite. The unique morphology of the Sn@CNT–GNS nanostructure leads to an extremely larger initial reversible charge capacity of 1160 mA h g−1, which is larger than those of GNS, SnS2 particles, and GNS supported SnS2 nanoparticles. A large reversible capacity of 982 mA h g−1 can be retained after 100 cycles for the composite (Fig. 9b). The high-rate cycling performance as shown in Fig. 9c reveals that GNS–Sn@CNT is cycled very well with high initial reversible capacities of 828, 686, and 594 mA h g−1 at 1 C, 2 C, and 5 C (1 C = 1000 mA g−1), respectively.

According to a facile thermal reduction process, a 3D porous graphene-confined Sn nanosheet composite190 is reported, which consists of GNS/Sn nanosheet/GNS nano-units as shown in the SEM and TEM images of Fig. 10a and b. Two ultrathin Sn nanosheets can be observed on GNS in the TEM image of Fig. 10c. The cross-section of the sandwiched GNS/Sn nanosheets/GNS can be clearly identified in the TEM image of Fig. 10d, in which Sn nanosheets (∼10 nm in thickness) are sandwiched between two graphene nanosheets (∼5 nm in thickness). The closely-contacted GNS and Sn nanosheets may greatly facilitate the lithium alloying and de-alloying reactions with Sn and prevent GNS aggregation. These novel GNS supported Sn nanosheets exhibit a large reversible capacity and good cycling performances of above 800 mA h g−1 in the initial 10 cycles and ∼590 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g−1.

Chemical doping such as nitrogen doping is suggested as an effective way to improve the electrochemical properties of graphene and the supported Sn-based anodes.61,199,200,224,226 A composite of monodispersed ultrathin SnO2 nanorods (2.5–4 nm in diameter and 10–15 nm in length) on nitrogen-doped GNS224 is synthesized, as indicated in Fig. 11a–c. The initial discharge and charge capacities of 1996 and 1145 mA h g−1 are observed for such a SnO2/N-doped GNS composite at a current density of 100 mA g−1. It also shows large reversible capabilities of 803 and 774 mA h g−1 at current densities of 100 and 200 mA g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 11d) and good high-rate performances (506 mA h g−1 at a large current of 1000 mA g−1 after 50 cycles with a small capacity loss of ∼0.2% per cycle) due to the synergistic effect between SnO2, GNS and nitrogen-doping. Nitrogen-doping is suggested to decrease the energy barrier for lithium ion penetration, increase electrode/electrolyte wettability and generate more defects for lithium ion storage.61,199,200,224,226

For Si-based electrodes, coating of carbon–graphene on the surface of nanostructured Si electrodes8,232 has been proven to be an efficient method to stabilize the interface between Si-based materials and electrolytes for the purpose of achieving a stable cycle life. However, Si nanoparticle233–260 structures are easier to obtain in most of the graphene-supported Si-based anode reports. There are few reports dealing with GNS-supported Si nanowire261–264 and thin film265 structures.
Graphene layers are suggested to coat Si nanowires in the article by Yang et al.261 The active silicon nanowires (Si NW) consisting of silicon carbide nanocrystals (60–90 nm thickness of carbon layer) and surrounded by a uniform graphene shell, show an outstanding large reversible capacity of 1650 mA h g−1 after 500 charge–discharge cycles and extremely high Coulombic efficiencies of over 99% and 99.5% after 9 and 30 cycles, respectively. By the catalysis of gold, Si nanowires (20–50 nm in diameter) are formed in situ in a supercritical fluid–liquid–solid process as shown in Fig. 12.262 The graphene supported Si nanowires exhibit an initial very large reversible lithium-extraction capacity of 2009 mA h g−1, and a reversible capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 is still observed after 30 cycles at 420 mA g−1. Zhu and co-workers mix pre-formed silicon nanowires with graphene nanosheets by an electrostatic self-assembly technique.263 The nanowire-on-sheet composite exhibits a reduced initial reversible capacity but better cycling performances than previously reported.261 An initial reversible capacity of 1648 mA h g−1 can be delivered, which remains at 1335 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 200 mA g−1. More recently, graphene-supported Si nanowires are prepared by the catalysis of Au nanoparticles via a chemical vapor deposition route.264 The composite shows a large initial reversible charge capacity of 2428 mA h g−1 with a good capacity retention rate of 91.8% after 100 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g−1. Compared to the aforementioned graphene–Sn based anodes, these graphene–Si based anodes generally have larger reversible capacities due to the larger theoretical value of Si element, but poorer cycling performances.

Germanium (Ge), an element of the same group of Sn and Si, also possesses a high theoretical capacity of 1624 mA h g−1. Recently, more research efforts have been devoted to the GNS supported Ge/GeO2 composites with different Ge/GeO2 morphologies such as 0D Ge/GeO2 nanoparticles266–273 and 1D Ge nanowires.274,275
Among graphene-supported Ge/GeO2 nanoparticles, further morphological modification of Ge or graphene structure can deliver improved Li-storage properties. Graphene supported Ge@C core–shell nanoparticles270 exhibit excellent cycling performance (a reversible capacity of ∼940 mA h g−1 retained at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles) and a good rate capability (380 mA h g−1 retained at 3600 mA g−1 after 50 cycles). 3D graphene scaffold supported Ge nanoparticles also exhibit excellent electrochemical performances (a reversible capacity of 1140 mA h g−1 at 1/3 C over 100 cycles and 835 mA h g−1 at 8 C after 60 cycles).273
Graphene encapsulated 1D Ge nanowires are successfully synthesized via a one-step arc-discharge route by Wang and co-workers.274 Ge nanowires (Fig. 13a and b) with 20 to 30 nm diameter are encapsulated in graphene to form a Ge–graphene core–shell coaxial structure. The graphene-encapsulated Ge nanowire composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 (based on the contribution of Ge) after 50 cycles at a current density of 1600 mA g−1 (Fig. 13c). The composite also exhibits an excellent high-rate capability as shown in Fig. 13d. Another GNS/Ge nanowire composite is synthesized by growing graphene on the pre-synthesized individual Ge nanowires by a catalyst-free chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.275 The composite shows a high reversible capacity of 1059 mA h g−1 at a high C-rate (4.0 C) after 200 cycles. This capacity corresponds to 90% of the initial reversible charge capacity.

4 Graphene-supported metal sulfides
Metal sulfides exhibit different lithium-ion storage mechanisms depending on the type of metal. In general, transitional metal sulfides such as MoS2, CoS, NiS, CuS, and FeS have large theoretical capacities, because they are first reduced by lithium to a transitional metal and lithium sulfide. The resultant lithium sulfide can decompose and be reproduced by reversible redox reactions.38–40,43 In this regard, lithium sulfide exhibits a function similar to that to lithium oxide obtained from lithium reduction of a transitional metal oxide. However, the main group metal sulfides such as SnS2 and In2S3 exhibit a lithium-alloy mechanism.41,44 For example, tin sulfide is reduced to tin and lithium sulfide. Tin can alloy and de-alloy reversibly with a lithium ion to deliver a high capacity of 645 mA h g−1, but the resultant lithium sulfide has a similar inactive effect to lithium oxide obtained from lithium reduction of tin oxide. It should be noted that some metal sulfides such as Sb2S3 have been proposed to follow two types of lithium ion storage mechanisms induced by reversible decomposition of Li2S and Sb–Li alloying.42
4.1 Molybdenum sulfide
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a layered transitional metal dichalcogenide compound composed of atomic layers stacked together through van der Waals interactions.38–40 The layered structure is helpful to allow lithium ions to easily intercalate. Therefore, in the first stage of Li-ion storage (as described below), lithium ions intercalate into the S slab, leading to the breakage of the van der Waals S–S bonds and the formation of Li–S. Lithiated MoS2 can then decompose into Mo nanoparticles, which are embedded in a Li2S matrix.MoS2 + xLi+ + xe− → LixMoS2(4 − x)Li+ + LixMoS2 + (4 − x)e− ↔ Mo+ 2Li2S
Due to its graphene-like layered structure, MoS2 is inclined to form a 2D sheet-like structure in the MoS2–GNS nanocomposites.276–290 The morphological and structural similarities between MoS2 and GNS are the beneficial factors for property synergy. Therefore, the sheet-on-sheet structures have received great interest as a promising electrode structure for LIBs. Among them, several examples of single-layer MoS2–GNS composites have been obtained with commendable electrochemical properties.288–290
MoS2 nanosheet-graphene nanosheet hybrids were first prepared by Chen and co-workers by a hydrothermal technique.276,277 The layered MoS2 materials are tightly coupled with graphene nanosheets as shown in Fig. 14a and b. It is demonstrated that GNS can restrain the layered MoS2 from good stacking in the (002) plane, favoring the formation of MoS2–GNS composites with few layers instead. A strong synergetic effect is observed in the sheet-on-sheet composite anodes. MoS2–GNS (1:1), MoS2–GNS (1:2), and MoS2–GNS (1:4) composites exhibit charge capacities of 734, 1187, and 978 mA h g−1 respectively after 100 cycles, which are substantially larger than the observed capacity of 256 mA h g−1 for pristine MoS2 after the same number of cycles. The composite also exhibits good rate capability; for example, at a large current of 1000 mA g−1, a large reversible capacity of ∼900 mA h g−1 is maintained for MoS2–GNS (1:2). Recently, Chen and co-workers also reported a similar GNS-supported single-layered MoS2 structure288,290 obtained by the cationic surfactant assisted hydrothermal method (Fig. 14c and d). The single-layered MoS2–GNS-02 composite (prepared from 0.02 M graphene oxide) exhibits a large reversible capacity of 808 mA h g−1 at a small current of 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles with a small capacity loss of 1.04 mA h g−1 per cycle. This reversible capacity is larger than those of pristine MoS2 (446 mA h g−1) and the MoS2–GNS-05 composite (prepared from 0.05 M graphene oxide, 702 mA h g−1) after the same number of cycles (Fig. 14e). Excellent high-rate performances are also observed for the single-layered MoS2–GNS-02 composite (∼600 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. 14f).290 The microstructures and the electrochemical properties of graphene-like MoS2–GNS for reversible lithium storage are dependent on the structure of the cationic surfactants and their concentrations in the hydrothermal solution.290 Furthermore, the number of layers in graphene-like MoS2 nanosheets in the composites can also be controlled by using different cationic surfactants and their concentrations.288

Under the synergistic effect of a lithiation-assisted exfoliation process and a hydrazine monohydrate vapor reduction technique, a MoS2 nanosheet-graphene nanosheet hybrid is also fabricated.278 The obtained nanosheets are in the range from several hundred nanometers to a few micrometers (Fig. 15). The MoS2 nanosheet@GNS electrode achieves highly reversible large capacities. A reversible charge capacity of 915 mA h g−1 can be retained after repetitive 700 cycles, while those of MoS2 nanosheets and graphene are only 57 and 259 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, respectively. The high capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycle life delivered by the above-mentioned MoS2–GNS composite can be attributed to excellent structural affinity between MoS2 nanosheets and GNS, which can facilitate electron and lithium transport, increase the contact area with electrolyte and improve the mechanical stability of the electrode.

4.2 Tin sulfide
With a large theoretical capacity of 645 mA h g−1, tin disulfide (SnS2) is a promising anode for Li-ion batteries. Its lithium storage mechanism can be described as a Sn–Li alloying/de-alloying process after SnS2 reduction to Sn and Li2S.41 The formed Li2S intermediate cannot decompose reversibly, and the active Li-ion storage element is only Sn. The storage mechanism of SnS2 is very similar to that of SnO2 with inactive elements of S and O.SnS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− → Sn + 2Li2SSn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixSn
Similar to Sn or SnO2 anodes, the large volume change and electrode pulverization lead to poor cycliabilities of SnS2-based anodes, while the introduction of GNS to support tin sulfides has been proposed as an effective strategy to solve these problems. The reported SnS2–GNS composites usually display two types of SnS2 morphologies: nanoparticle-on-sheet291–297 and nanosheet/nanoplate-on-sheet.298–304
With the assistance of the fast microwave-assisted technique, a porous 3D SnS2–GNS sheet-on-sheet nanostructure299 has been synthesized recently, in which SnS2 nanosheets are unfolded compared to pristine SnS2 nanoflowers and distributed uniformly on the GNS surface (Fig. 16a and b). The cycling performance of the obtained graphene supported interconnected SnS2 nanosheets at 0.1 C and 1 C are shown in Fig. 16c and d. It is clear that the SnS2–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite achieves better electrochemical performances than bare graphene and pristine SnS2 nanoflowers. Large reversible capacities from 1077 to 896 mA h g−1 and 934 to 657 mA h g−1 are observed at 0.1 C and 1 C, respectively, over 40 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties have been largely ascribed to the closely-contacted sheet-on-sheet composite, enabling the synergetic effect for highly reversible lithium ion storage.

Luo et al. reported a simple chemical vapor deposition process, which is a facile approach to transform tin oxide nanoparticles into 2D SnS2 nanoplates with different lateral sizes directly on/between graphene nanosheets.301 The obtained 2D SnS2@GNS sheet-on-sheet nanocomposites with different SnS2 nanoplate sizes can be gained under different experimental conditions. High temperature pre-annealing of G–SnO2 intermediate tends to form SnS2 plates with small sizes (below 300 nm, Fig. 17b and c), while a lower H2S/Ar flow rate in the CVD process can lead to SnS2 plates with a larger size (Fig. 17d). A high reversible capacity of 668 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles at a current of 100 mA g−1 and excellent rate capability of 230 mA h g−1 at a large current of 6400 mA g−1 have been achieved for the GNS–SnS2–S anode with the smallest diameter (Fig. 17b).

4.3 Cobalt/nickel sulfide
Among various transitional metal sulfides, nickel sulfide has attracted a special interest for its abundance as a resource, low toxicity and high theoretical capacity (590 mA h g−1), while cobalt sulfides with different stoichiometric ratios, such as CoS and Co3S4, have also shown great potential for use in LIBs, due to their high thermal stability and electrical conductivity.305–309 The lithium storage mechanism of nickel sulfide and cobalt sulfide can be described by the following two-step reactions (1 and 2). The active Li-ion storage element is sulfur, which can store lithium basically based on the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2S. The effect of Li2S is very similar to that of Li2O in a previously reported Li-ion storage mechanism of transitional metal oxides. The overall reaction can be summarized by reaction (3). MxSy + nLi+ + ne− ↔ LinMxSy(1) (2y − n) Li+ + LinMxSy + (2y − n)e− ↔ x[M]0 + yLi2S(2) MxSy + 2ye− + 2yLi+ ↔ x[M]0 + yLi2S(3)
As discussed above, the Li2S products are the intermediate in the Li-ion storage reactions for cobalt/nickel sulfides. The amorphous nature of graphene is helpful for absorbing the polysulfide anions, which prevents them from dissolution in the electrolyte. There are few reports on the GNS-supported cobalt/nickel sulfides, especially regarding the structure of 1D nanotubes305 or 2D nanosheets306 embedded in GNS nanosheets. The outstanding lithium storage properties have been achieved in CoSx–GNS nanoparticle-on-sheet composites with high reversible capacities reaching ∼900 mA h g−1 even after 50 charge–discharge cycles.309 A NiS/GNS hybrid, which is synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, exhibits an ultrathin sheet-like NiS structure (below 5 nm) in the presence of graphene, forming a unique sheet-on-sheet nanostructure (Fig. 18a and b).306 The unique ultrathin sheet structure of NiS and the combined conducting, buffering and confining effects of GNS are beneficial for the rapid Li-ion transportation across the electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, such NiS/GNS hybrid exhibits remarkably improved Li-storage properties compared to pristine NiS, and a reversible capacity of 481 mA h g−1 can be retained after 100 cycles with a good rate capability (386 mA h g−1 at 800 mA g−1) as indicated in Fig. 18c and d. Mahmood and co-workers reported a novel GNS-supported Co3S4 nanotube305 consisting of Co3S4 nanotubes with an average diameter of 300 nm and lengths of a few micrometers on GNS. It shows a high discharge capacity of 720 mA h g−1 up to 100 cycles with ∼99.9% Columbic efficiencies.

4.4 Other metal sulfides
In addition, some efforts have been devoted to graphene supported by other main group metal sulfides (such as indium sulfide44,310,311 and antimony sulfide312) and transitional metal sulfides (such as copper sulfide,313 iron sulfide,314 tungsten sulfide315,316 and manganese sulfide317). The indium sulfides tend to form 2D nanosheet/plate morphologies with enhanced specific capacity and cycliability (the reversible capacities change from 1072 mA h g−1 to 1015 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles)310 when embedded in GNS, while only antimony sulfide nanoparticles are obtained on GNS,312 which can exhibit a reversible capacity of 720 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 250 mA g−1. It is worth noting that two similar GNS-supported few-layered WS2 nanosheet composites with different electrochemical properties are synthesized by hydrothermal reactions with315 and without316 a subsequent freeze-drying method. In addition, the GNS–MnS composite exhibits a novel α-MnS hollow structure with porous shells embedded in the GNS nanosheet and displays outstanding lithium storage properties.317
5 Graphene–carbon nanotube based composites
Recently, three dimensional graphene–carbon nanotube composites57,186,187,203–216,318–322 consisting of two dimensional graphene and one dimensional carbon nanotube (CNT) have attracted more research interest. The 3D carbon–carbon composites can show synergistic effects between two different graphitic components with graphene layers being stabilized by aligned CNTs between the graphene nanosheets and the electrical conductivity along the vertical direction of GNS being improved by the bridging of GNS vertically with CNTs. A physical mixture of GNS–CNT exhibits an increased reversible capacity of 730 mA h g−1 compared to that of bare GNS (540 mA h g−1).57 As shown in Fig. 19, a series of GNS–CNT composites,318 denoted as GNS–CNT-1, GNS–CNT-2 and GNS–CNT-3, are synthesized by chemical vapor reduction and deposition reactions performed at 500 °C for 2 min, 5 min and 1 h, respectively. The named “tip growth” mechanism is shown in Fig. 19a for the growth of CNTs on GNS. The corresponding HRTEM images of the products at different reaction stages are shown in Fig. 19b and confirm the growth mechanism of graphene–CNT nanocomposites. In such multilayered GNS–CNT composites, the tunable lengths of CNTs are achieved by adjusting the experimental conditions, which is a crucial factor for the electrochemical performance. The GNS–CNT-1 (Fig. 19c) with the shortest CNT length of 200–500 nm shows better electrochemical properties with a high reversible capacity above 500 mA h g−1 at both a small rate (0.2 C) and high rate (2 C) than the other GNS–CNT-2 (with the CNT length of 300–1500 nm, Fig. 19d) and GNS–CNT-3 (with the CNT length of 400–3000 nm, Fig. 19e) (Fig. 19f and g). This should be ascribed to the short length of CNTs in GNS–CNT-1, which can decrease the diffusion distance for lithium ions insertion and extraction. The improved properties of GNS–CNT compared to bare GNS (Fig. 19g) have been ascribed to the unique three dimensional conductive networks for efficient charge-transfer, increased electrical contact along both horizontal and vertical directions compared to bare graphene, and more active pores for Li ion storage.318

Another good example is a 3D graphene–carbon nanotube–nickel (GNS–CNT–Ni) composite, synthesized by a cost-effective microwave-assisted method.319 As shown in Fig. 20, well-packed CNTs are grown uniformly on the GNS sheets by tailing the movement of the nickel nanoparticles. It should be noted that CNTs grow with various sizes of up to several nanometers in length, and their diameter strongly depends on the size of nickel particles. These novel 3D GNS–CNT–Ni functional nanostructures show excellent performance (a reversible specific capacity of 648 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1) due to the ultrahigh surface area, large number of activation sites and efficient ion diffusion. In comparison, CNT–Ni shows a smaller reversible capacity of 282 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The high-rate cycling performances of GNS–CNT–Ni are also superior to those of CNT–Ni.

Carbon nanotube and graphene nanosheets are both intriguing carbonaceous materials with unique properties including large surface areas, fast electronic conductivities, and flexible and robust microstructures. The combination of GNS and CNT materials may offer more intriguing properties. The synthesis of GNS-CNT composites also provides a new substrate to support203,216,323–327 and even encapsulate186,187 other high-capacity anode materials with the aim of improving their Li-ion storage properties. For example, a microwave irradiation technique is used to fabricate a 3D GNS–CNT–Fe2O3 anode, which delivers a large reversible capacity of 1024 mA h g−1 after 40 cycles along with a Coulombic efficiency approaching 100%.325 The following merits are determined in these CNT-GNS composites: (1) the presence of GNS and CNTs can help each other to prevent the other one's aggregation, ensuring that the unique properties of GNS and CNTs can be preserved for a long time for various applications. (2) Fast electronic conductivity of GNS is limited in the graphene layer, and the presence of CNT can increase cross-plane conductivity by tightly coupled CNT with GNS. (3) Compared to bare GNS or CNT, the porous 3D GNS–CNT conductive network can further facilitate the electron and lithium transportation and electrolyte diffusion, and even store extra amounts of lithium ions in the pores.
6 Perspectives and challenges
In summary, GNS-supported nanocomposites, which exhibit different morphologies and outstanding electrochemical properties, can be a good choice as the anode material for lithium ion batteries. Good control of the morphology and dimensions of the GNS-based composite anodes is necessary since the electrochemical properties have been demonstrated to be highly dependent on the morphology, size, defect number and composition in the composites. CuO is used as a typical example to represent the morphology-dependent Li-ion storage properties in the presence of graphene. Table 2 compares the electrochemical performance of graphene-supported CuO composites with various 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D CuO morphologies. Based on similar experimental conditions such as test current and the weight percentage of graphene in the composites in our previous publicaitons,97,98 the CuO–GNS sheet-on-sheet composite97 shows the largest reversible capacity compared to graphene supported fusiform97/shuttle98/urchin98-like CuO composites. A large reversible capacity of 801 mA h g−1 is observed for the sheet-on-sheet composite after 40 cycles.97 This reversible capacity is also larger than those of other graphene-supported composites such as 0D CuO nanoparticles,94,95 1D nanorods96 and 3D nanoflowers100/urchins101 after the same number of cycles (such comparison can only be regarded as a rough estimation because the experimental conditions such as test currents and the composite composition are not same). Among the various CuO morphologies indicated in Table 2, graphene supported 0D CuO nanoparticles generally display the lowest reversible capacities (440–580 mA h g−1)94,95 compared to graphene supported 1D, 2D and 3D CuO morphologies.

In general, GNS supported 1D, 2D, and 3D electrode structures exhibit more attractive properties than 0D nanoparticles under similar experimental conditions. From the viewpoint of contact efficiency between graphene and the supported materials, the structure affinity of two components should be the most important. GNS substrate is a 2D nanosheet structure, and the introduced second-phase supported materials should be 2D as well to fit the GNS well. Such surface-to-surface contact is the best model for structural affinity between GNS and the introduced supported materials. In contrast, the contact between 2D GNS and 1D/0D supported materials is in a line-to-line or point-to-point mode, which has less contact area. Moreover, the supported 3D structure also has less contact area with graphene because usually only one face of the 3D structure is contacted by graphene. In this regard, the GNS-supported sheet-on-sheet structure is believed to be a perfect composite structure to achieve outstanding synergetic electrochemical performance, mainly attributed to the synergic effect of the supported nanosheet structure and GNS with the same dimensionality (Scheme 1). The 2D structure of the supported materials can be contacted tightly with 2D GNS materials according to a large surface contact area compared with 3D structures, 1D nanowires/nanorods/nanotubes and 0D nanoparticles. Therefore, the electrical conductivity and mechanical stability of 2D nanosheets can be improved by GNS upon repetitive cycling, and GNS can be better separated to prevent restacking into graphite platelets, which would lose the promising properties related to the unique few-layer structure. Moreover, 0D nanoparticles tend to be agglomerated due to a small particle size upon repetitive cycling despite the presence of GNS. The agglomerated big particle may be pulverized and lose the electrical contact with the current collector under inhomogeneous mechanical stress induced by the large volume change during lithium insertions (Scheme 1).

The choice and modification of graphene and its derivatives with different surface characteristics and microstructures are essential to the resultant graphene-supported composites and their Li-ion storage properties.328 Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) powders are often used as the starting materials in the current synthesis approaches for various GNS-based composites. The GO is prepared by chemical oxidation using strong oxidation agents. There are abundant surface groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy groups. The reduced GO still retains a small amount of these oxygen-functionalized groups. These surface groups have significant effects in the solution-based preparation of GNS-supported composites. Therefore, the product morphology can be tuned by using GO or RGO with various reduction extents and by varying the amount of RGO used,40,44,115 in addition to varying other experimental conditions such as the reaction solvent, temperature, and structure-directing agent. Moreover, the binding effect between graphene and the supported materials is largely affected by these surface groups/functionalities, which should be a crucial factor to the structural stability of the GNS-supported composites when used for repeated cycling with lithium ions. The possible linkages such as metal-O-, S- and H-, have been proposed in graphene-supported metal oxides and metal sulfides.28,70,88,96,276–278,290 Chemical doping with other elements such as nitrogen61,199,200,224,226,329 and boron329,330 has also been used to modify the graphene structure and achieve significantly improved electrochemical properties for graphene-based composites anodes. It was found that nitrogen-doping can greatly generate more defects for large capacity for lithium ion storage and decrease the energy barrier for lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation, and boron doped graphene can store more lithium ions in the resultant electron-deficient system.330 Porous activated graphene nanosheet by carbon dioxide or KOH activation is also a promising technique that can deliver a more open pore structure in the planar sheet with increased surface areas.214,331
Besides the use of powders in most reports, graphene or reduced graphene oxide nanosheets have been recently prepared in other macroscopical states with intriguing electrochemical properties. For example, the 3D graphene aerogels (GAS)332,333 and the crumpled 3D sphere by self-assembly of graphene123 developed recently have been proven to possess a high specific surface area and percolated network, which can transport and store charge with very low bulk density. Graphene aerogels are simple and intriguing matrices for combination with metal/metal oxide-based active anode materials,201,334 and GAS-involved nanocomposites exhibit enhanced electrical conductivity and facilitated lithium and electrolyte diffusion when used as high-surface-area electrodes for lithium ion batteries. Moreover, 2D graphene-based composite film prepared by vacuum infiltration of the graphene-based dispersion84,89,118,335–337 or CVD growth on catalytic metal substrate,338–341 as advanced electrode materials, have attracted more and more attention due to their improved mechanical stability, fast electron-transfer kinetics and excellent electrochemical activity without the need of binder and additional conducting agents. Lastly, 1D graphene nanoribbons derived from 1D CNT have been explored for Li-ion batteries.196,342 These 3D, 2D and 1D GNS-based composites can transfer the intrinsic features of the individual components and may attract more research interest in the near future.
Although promising results have been achieved for various GNS-supported nanocomposites as electrode materials for LIBs, there are still some existing challenges or drawbacks, which need to be conquered in the future: (1) the fundamental lithium storage mechanism in graphene-based composites is not yet fully understood especially with respect to their surface functionalities/defects and hierarchical electrode structures. (2) The voltage plateau of graphene-based composites is usually not flat because most graphene in the composites is largely disordered carbon for the purpose of large Li-ion storage capacity and fast and easy lithium intercalation. Some graphene-supported composites such as transitional metal oxides and metal sulfides have a comparatively high voltage range for lithium insertion and extraction. These issues would affect the stable output of the energy and reduce the power density of the battery. (3) The high cost of GNS-based electrode materials significantly restricts their scalable production and application. The high surface area of graphene and its composites may lead to the large irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle, and the porosity in the graphene-based composite exhibits a small tap density and subsequently an unfavorably low volumetric capacity.
It is believed that more effort should be focused on the control of morphology, porosity, size, defects, and alignment of the graphene-based composites and understanding the interfacial interactions between graphene and the introduced functional second-phase compounds to achieve better electrochemical performance. Graphene-based electrode materials for LIBs will realize more practical applications such as use in personal electronics, electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and scalable energy storage.
