    , Accepted 1st September 2022First published on 2nd September 2022AbstractDesigning new high-performance non-fullerene acceptors is the key driving force for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, a new acceptor, BOEH-4Cl, was designed based on the end-group chlorination of L8-BO. Theoretical calculations successfully predicted the expected experimental results based on the optoelectronic properties of BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO and intermolecular interaction of PM6/BOEH-4Cl or L8-BO. A high-boiling-point solvent (HBPS, chlorobenzene) was also introduced as a calculation factor, which is beneficial to future industrialization. In agreement with the calculated results, the optimized HBPS-processed BOEH-4Cl film exhibited tighter molecular packing, a more efficient interfacial hole transfer process and lower non-radiative energy loss, demonstrating necessary properties as a promising acceptor. The efficiency of optimized HBPS-processed PM6/BOEH-4Cl OSCs reached 17.4%, much higher than that of PM6/L8-BO (14.5%). Hence, this work demonstrates the great potential of utilizing theoretical chemical calculations to assist in the design of acceptor molecules to reduce time and cost.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), being low-cost, flexible, lightweight, solution processable, and semi-transparent and offering environmentally friendly clean energy harvesting,1–6 have attracted extensive research efforts. To date, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs have exceeded 19%,7–13 which is mainly due to the development of new NFAs with outstanding optoelectronic properties and low non-radiative energy loss.14,15 Typical OSCs consist of an active layer sandwiched between hole and electron transporting layers. In the active layer, the electron donor and electron acceptor materials are mixed to form a bicontinuous interpenetrating network structure–bulk heterojunction (BHJ). The bulk morphology is known to be crucial to the device performance, in terms of exciton diffusion, dissociation, charge transport and recombination.16,17 In addition, the bulk morphology is influenced by the donor/acceptor (D/A) ratio.18 For instance, the optimal D/A ratio is generally 1/1.2 for PM6/Y619 and its derivatives.20–22 Therefore, optimizing the molecular structures of NFAs is a feasible strategy to further improve the performance of OSCs,23 and an in-depth understanding of the structure–property relationship is essential to the efficient design of high-performance acceptors.
In 2019, Zou and co-workers reported a promising acceptor Y6, and the binary devices based on the PM6/Y6 exhibited a milestone PCE of 15.7%.19 After that, the OSC community focused on modifying the molecular structure of Y6 to improve the PCE of OSCs. Particularly, alkyl chain modification has shown a notable influence on the morphology and charge transport behaviours. Yan and co-workers reported N3 via modifying branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif of Y6.24 The device of the PM6:N3:PC71BM blend possessed a certified PCE of 16.42% due to the outstanding electronic and morphological properties. Yao et al. shortened the alkyl chain from n-undecyl (C11) to n-nonyl (C9) to get BTP-eC9.22 The BTP-eC9-based device reported a certified PCE of 17.3%. The high PCE was mainly due to the suitable solubility and enhanced intermolecular packing. Wang et al. further shortened the alkyl chains on bithiophene units in Y6 from n-octyl (C8) to n-pentyl (C5) and synthesized four new NFAs. BTP-4F-C5-16 with the shortest alkyl chains exhibited better molecular planarity and fast electron mobility and achieved the best PCE of 18.20%.25 Sun et al. reported a superior NFA named L8-BO by replacing the n-undecyl of Y6 with 2-butyloctyl side chains.21 They demonstrated for the first time that the alkyl chains have significant influences not only on the morphology and carrier transport properties but also on absorption and frontier molecular orbital energies. The L8-BO-based devices afforded a high PCE of 18.32%, with a high fill factor (FF) and low voltage loss. In addition, chlorination is also an effective strategy to improve the performance of NFAs via an enhanced intramolecular push–pull effect, improved molecular stacking and reduced energy loss of devices.13,22,26–28 The push–pull effect has an important impact on the absorption ability and molecular energy levels. Hou et al. designed and synthesized a chlorinated NFA, namely BTP-4Cl, by replacing four fluorine atoms with four chlorine atoms.29 Their results verified that the chlorinated acceptors effectively broaden the light absorption range, contributing to the increased short-circuit current density (JSC) of the OSCs. Besides, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the BTP-4Cl-based OSC was significantly improved as well, due to a lower non-radiative energy loss. Analogously, He et al. reported three chlorinated NFAs including BTIC-4Cl-T, BTIC-4Cl-TCl-γ, and BTIC-4Cl-TCl-β.30 As a result, a high PCE of 15.65% was achieved in the BTIC-4Cl-TCl-β-based device due to a high VOC of up to 0.86 V.
Besides, to promote the ultimate industrialization of organic solar cells, the boiling point of the solvent needs to be considered. The processing solvent for most of the reported high-performance devices fabricated in the laboratory is low-boiling-point chloroform (CF),20,31–38 which, however, is not suitable for large-scale industrialization because of the following three reasons: (1) CF is volatile and easily decomposed into highly corrosive gases, which can seriously deteriorate the equipment lifetime and is detrimental to personnel safety.39 (2) Large-area OSCs have the potential to be factory-made at a high speed (>40 m s−1)40 using printing techniques, which requires that the precursor solution has appropriate wettability, viscosity and evaporation speed to allow the formation of a homogeneous film with desired thickness. (3) The crystallization behaviour and bulk and surface morphology of printed films can be very different from those made by the spin-coating technique. Voigt et al. found that high-boiling-point solvents (HBPSs) not only have more suitable viscosity to form uniform films but also can effectively improve the morphology of the large-area active layers.41 Therefore, developing new high-performance NFAs, that are suitable for HBPS fabrication, is highly desirable for OSCs to advance towards mass production.42–46
When the chemical structure of an NFA is modified, concurrent changes in structural and optoelectronic properties will occur. Laborious experimental tests are required to characterize these changes. Fortunately, various computational chemistry methodologies have been developed to understand the working principle of OSCs and to access the structural and optoelectronic properties of donor and acceptor molecules.47 For example, the frontier molecular orbital energy levels and excited-state properties of organic semiconductor materials can be predicted through selecting an appropriate density functional method.48 Marcus electron transfer theory combined with density functional theory (DFT) can qualitatively evaluate the charge-transport properties by calculating electronic coupling and reorganization energies.49 Molecular dynamics simulations have been adopted to reveal the molecular packing model in blend systems.50 These important computational methodologies not only can help understand the correlation with device performance, but also can guide the rational design of organic semiconductor molecules to save experimental cost and time.
In this work, we designed a new NFA, named BOEH-4Cl, via end-group chlorination of L8-BO (Fig. 1a). In the first place, the structural and electronic properties of BOEH-4Cl were systematically calculated by DFT. The results predicted that BOEH-4Cl possesses smaller electron reorganization energy and lower exciton coulomb energy than L8-BO, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation and electron transport, and in turn to reduce the energy loss. Based on the promising properties predicted by calculation, BOEH-4Cl was then synthesized using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Remarkably, the experimental results matched well with the calculation results in terms of light absorption, energy levels and charge-transport properties. The HBPS-processed as-cast devices based on the mid-bandgap polymer PM6 as a donor and BOEH-4Cl as an acceptor exhibited a higher PCE of 16.5% compared with PM6/L8-BO as-cast OSCs (15.5%). To further optimize the morphology of blend films and improve the device performance, 0.3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a solvent additive was adopted. Remarkably, the optimized BOEH-4Cl-based devices presented the best efficiency of 17.4%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for HBPS-processed binary OSCs.39,42,43,46,51–53 In contrast, the VOC, JSC and FF were all reduced for the HBPS-processed L8-BO-based devices. It suggested that the morphology of BOEH-4Cl can be positively modulated by HBPS processing, demonstrating its great potential for mass production. Furthermore, this work demonstrated that theoretical chemical calculation is a feasible means to expediate the development of new high-performance NFAs at a low cost.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation-assisted molecular design
We designed a new acceptor (BOEH-4Cl) by replacing the four fluorine atoms of L8-BO with four chlorine atoms (Fig. 1a). Firstly, DFT was employed to investigate the structure and electronic properties of BOEH-4Cl. For comparison, the corresponding properties of L8-BO also were evaluated. The geometry optimization of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl molecules was carried out at the B3LYP/Def2SVP level.54 For the accuracy of the calculation results, the high-boiling-point solvent effect (in chlorobenzene) was included using the solvation model based on density (SMD) mode and the van der Waals correction (D3) method was also applied in our calculations.55 The optimized structures of BOEH-4Cl, L8-BO, and PM6 are shown in Fig. S1.† The calculations demonstrated that BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO exhibited a similar distribution of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were located on the whole molecular backbone (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the chlorination led to a slight reduction of the FMO energy levels of BOEH-4Cl compared to L8-BO. The result was consistent with previous reports.56 A calculated redshift of 10 nm in the absorption peak of BOEH-4Cl has been observed compared to that of L8-BO (Fig. 1c), which might be beneficial to the JSC of the device. Besides, the electron and hole reorganization energies have been calculated to assess the carrier transport properties of BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO. Considering that BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO have similar molecular structures and thus similar molecular stacking models and electron/hole transfer integral values in the aggregation state, the electron/hole mobility will be negatively correlated with the electron/hole reorganization energies according to Marcus electron transfer theory. Therefore, the calculated electron/hole reorganization energies (Fig. 1d) suggested that the electron mobility is higher than the hole mobility for both BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO, while the electron mobility of BOEH-4Cl should be relatively higher than that of L8-BO.
Next, we studied the binding models and intermolecular interaction of the acceptors (BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO) and the donor (PM6), where the choice of the donor was based on the energy level and absorption complementary to the acceptors. To reduce the computational cost, we calculated the distribution of the electrostatic potential surface (EPS) of BOEH-4Cl, L8-BO, and PM6 to verify the binding site. BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO showed similar EPS distributions (Fig. S2†). Specifically, the maximum negative and positive EPSs are located on the end groups and conjugated backbone, respectively. The hydrogen atoms of thiophene and the oxygen atoms of diketone in PM6 result in the maximum positive and negative EPS values, respectively. According to these EPS distributions, we optimized the BOEH-4Cl/PM6 and L8-BO/PM6 complexes in the ground state (Fig. S3†). Moreover, the molecular interactions of BOEH-4Cl and L8-BO/PM6, and PM6 were evaluated by the Interaction Region Indicator (IRI) method (Fig. 1e). We observed strong van der Waals interactions (green zone) in BOEH-4Cl/PM6 and L8-BO/PM6 complexes. Interestingly, the intermolecular interaction energy of BOEH-4Cl/PM6 (1.15 eV) is larger than that of L8-BO/PM6 (1.01 eV). The stronger intermolecular interaction leads to more efficient charge transfer (0.895 e) of BOEH-4Cl/PM6 upon photoexcitation compared to that (0.825 e) of L8-BO/PM6 (Fig. 2), which will play a vital role in improving the JSC of the device. In summary, all calculational results predicted the great potential of BOEH-4Cl as a good acceptor in OSCs.

Synthesis and optoelectronic properties
According to the positive results of theoretical calculations, we synthesized BOEH-4Cl through an efficient synthetic route presented in Scheme S1,† and fully characterized the product by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. BOEH-4Cl exhibited good solubility comparable to L8-BO in common organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform and dichlorobenzene. As shown in Fig. 3a, the absorption edge of BOEH-4Cl in CB is red-shifted by 14 nm compared to that of L8-BO, which suggests that replacing fluorine atoms with chlorine atoms increases the dipole moment of the carbon–halogen bond and thus enhances push–pull hybridization between donor and acceptor units.13 BOEH-4Cl in dilute solution (1 × 10−6 M) has a slightly higher molar attenuation coefficient (ε) of 2.3 × 105 M−1 cm−1 compared to L8-BO (2.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1) (Table 1). The absorption edges of both molecules show a further bathochromic shift when deposited as thin films, suggesting good aggregation ability in the solid-state. It should be noted that the absorption spectrum of BOEH-4Cl shows more clear vibronic progression and a reduced intensity ratio between 0–1 and 0–0 peaks. While the former results from lower static disorder, the latter indicates a lower reorganization energy (λre), which can be derived from the Huang–Rhys factor (S) obtained via the following equation:57  where I0–1 and I0–0 are the intensities of peaks corresponding to 0–0 and 0–1 transitions between ground and S1 states. hω is the phonon energy of the vibrational mode coupled with this optical transition, which can be estimated between the separation between 0–0 and 0–1 peaks. The BOEH-4Cl thin film has a reorganization energy of 90 meV, which is much smaller than that of the L8-BO thin film (107 meV). This means that there is less nuclei relaxation upon optical excitation, arising from either enhanced molecular backbone rigidity or stronger intermolecular packing,58 which has also been observed in other chlorinated NFAs.56,59 All those factors will benefit electron transport and extraction in the active layer of OSCs, as will be discussed in the subsequent sections. The HOMO energy levels of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl were estimated using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 3b, S4† and Table 1). Meanwhile, the LUMO energy levels are calculated from the Eoptg and HOMO. The calculated HOMO/LUMO values of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl are −5.66/−4.29 and −5.68/−4.31 eV respectively, indicating that replacing fluorine with chlorine atoms at the end groups can lower the energy levels, but does not significantly affect the band gap of the acceptors, which is consistent with previous reports.13 In addition, the difference between the DFT calculated HOMO energy levels and the UPS results for L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl may be due to the neglected film morphology. The electron mobilities (μe) of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl pure films were estimated to be 3.3 × 10−3 and 5.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively (Fig. S5 and Table S2†) based on space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements.60 The higher electron mobility of BOEH-4Cl will facilitate the electron transport in the active layer to reach the cathode.

Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the influence of the chlorinated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) end-group on the device performance, CB-processed OSCs were fabricated based on a conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-5,5′-bis(2,2′-thiophene)-2,6-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-di(2-ethylhexyl)imide] (PNDIT-F3N)/Ag. The mid-bandgap polymer PM661 is commonly selected as the donor for Y-series based systems due to the complementary absorption and matching energy levels with NFAs. The weight ratio of D/A is kept constant as 1/1.2 (w/w) in all active layers. More detailed information on device fabrication is documented in the ESI.† The L8-BO-based as-cast binary device shows a VOC of 0.861 V, a JSC of 24.4 mA cm−2, an FF of 73.8% and a PCE of 15.5%, whereas the best PCE of BOEH-4Cl-based as-cast OSCs is 16.5% with a VOC of 0.887 V, a JSC of 24.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.1% (Fig. S6a† and Table 2). It is noteworthy that BOEH-4Cl has a lower LUMO energy level but exhibits a higher VOC relative to L8-BO, which is caused by a lower voltage loss (see below). Liquid DIO was introduced into the PM6/BOEH-4Cl binary system as an additive to improve the active layer morphology. The OSCs yield a PCE of 16.9% with a VOC of 0.880 V, a JSC of 25.4 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.6% (Fig. S7†). Furthermore, a thermal annealing (100 °C for 10 min) strategy was employed to further optimize the device performance. Excitingly, the optimized BOEH-4Cl-based device promoted the best efficiency to 17.4% with a VOC of 0.882 V, a JSC of 25.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 77.0%, which is among the higher values of CB-processed OSCs, and this has a positive impact on future industrialization. Obviously, the continuous improvement of JSC and FF and the maintenance of VOC are the key to the ultimate efficiency increase, thanks to the continuous optimization of the morphology (see the Film morphology section). Conversely, the same optimization strategy does not work for L8-BO-based devices, but rather reduces the parameters of VOC, JSC and FF together, giving rise to efficiency reduction from 15.5% (as-cast) to 14.5% (Fig. 3c). In particular, the BOEH-4Cl-based devices showed negligible VOC changes before and after optimization; however, the L8-BO-based OSCs exhibited significant VOC reduction after additive addition and thermal annealing treatment. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of as-cast and optimized L8-BO- and BOEH-4Cl-based OSCs are displayed in Fig. S6b† and 3d respectively, and the calculated JSC values of all devices agree with the measured values from current density–voltage measurements (<5% mismatch).

The exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency of the as-cast and optimized devices based on L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl were studied respectively by using the plots of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff). Veff = V0 − VA, where V0 corresponds to the voltage when Jph = 0, and VA represents the applied bias voltage. Generally, the Jph of OSCs reaches saturation when Veff > 2 V, which is defined as the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat). The photocurrent density under short circuit and maximum power output conditions are defined as Jpha and Jphb, respectively. Thus, the exciton dissociation (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) were calculated using Jpha/Jsat and Jphb/Jsat, respectively. The ηdiss/ηcoll of the as-cast and optimized L8-BO-based OSCs is 98.8/89.5% and 97.6/87.4% respectively, and those values of the corresponding BOEH-4Cl-based devices are 96.5/86.8% and 95.2/87.4% (Fig. 3e, S6c and Table S1†). The results show that there are efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection behaviors for all OSCs. Furthermore, the JSC under different illumination light intensities (Plight) was plotted to investigate the strength of bimolecular charge recombination in the devices (Fig. S6d† and 3f). Both α values of the as-cast and optimized L8-BO-based OSCs were calculated to be 0.998 based on the function of JSC ∝ Plightα. Similarly, the α values are 0.998 and 0.999 for as-cast and optimized BOEH-4Cl-based devices respectively, suggesting ignorable bimolecular recombination for both of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl systems. On the other hand, the charge carrier transport properties of blend films with different systems and post-treatments were investigated (Fig. S8 and Table S2†). The μh and μe for the L8-BO-based as-cast film are 2.24 × 10−3 and 1.66 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the corresponding values for the optimized L8-BO-based film are 1.50 × 10−3 and 0.61 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Obviously, the charge transport properties were not improved for the L8-BO-based system using a post-treatment strategy, which may be caused by the disruption of the active layer morphology (see below). However, the optimized PM6/BOEH-4Cl film exhibits higher and more balanced hole and electron mobility relative to the as-cast film (μh: 2.48 × 10−3vs. 1.84 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1; μe: 2.03 × 10−3vs. 1.23 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), suggesting that end-group alteration significantly affects the interaction between the acceptor and additive, which is consistent with the calculated results.
Film morphology
The roughness of the active layer surface is closely related to the charge transport and collection. Therefore, atomic force microscope (AFM) characterization was then used here to reveal the surface morphology of the blend films (Fig. S9†). The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the as-cast and optimal PM6/L8-BO blend films is measured to be 3.72 and 3.11 nm, respectively, and the corresponding values for PM6/BOEH-4Cl are 3.50 and 2.80 nm. Obviously, both optimized blend films exhibit a smoother surface compared to the as-cast systems, and the smoothest surface belongs to the optimized BOEH-4Cl-based active layer, which is beneficial for better contact with the metal electrode.
It is known that end groups play a significant role in the molecular packing of NFAs, which will eventually determine the overall photovoltaic performances, e.g. absorption, charge transfer dynamics and charge transport efficiency. Here, the only difference between L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl is the halogenation of terminal groups. Thus, we use grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to investigate the influence of different terminal halogenation on the molecular ordering of the two NFA molecules. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the one-dimensional profiles are shown in Fig. 4a–e and S10.† Both L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl present a predominant face-on orientation. Along the in-plane (IP) direction, the neat film of L8-BO exhibits two characteristic diffraction peaks at 0.35 and 0.45 Å−1 with the major peak located at 0.35 Å−1 (d = 17.9 Å), similar to the packing motif of Y6.19 With the chlorinated end groups, BOEH-4Cl has only one strong peak located at 0.43 Å−1, indicating that the packing of BOEH-4Cl is not as ordered as that in L8-BO. Besides, we also measured the molecular packing of NFAs in their blend films with the donor polymer PM6. Both the optimized blend films of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl present a strong lamellar peak at 0.33 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, which should be attributed to the lamellar stacking of PM6. The characteristic lamellar peaks of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl all remain in their optimized blend films with the peak positions and relative intensity almost unchanged. It indicates that the packing motifs of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl in the acceptor domain of their blend films should be the same as that in their respective neat films. Meanwhile, the π–π staking positions of the two binary films are also nearly the same further confirming that the packing motifs are similar. Even though the π–π peak intensity of PM6/BOEH-4Cl is slightly larger than that of PM6/L8-BO, the crystalline coherent lengths (CCLs) are slightly smaller (Table S3†), indicating that the overall crystallinity of BOEH-4Cl- and L8-BO-based films is comparable.

Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were further adopted to study the nanoscale phase morphology of binary blend films of PM6/L8-BO and PM6/BOEH-4Cl before and after additive optimization. 2D GISAXS patterns and the corresponding intensity and best fitting profiles along the IP direction are shown in Fig. S11† and 4f, respectively. The correlation length (ξ) of the intermixing phase and the average domain size (2Rg) of the crystalline acceptor phases are summarized in Table S4,† which were obtained using the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) and fractal-like network model.62 The ξ and 2Rg for the PM6/L8-BO as-cast film are 29.3 and 14.6 nm respectively, while the corresponding sizes for the PM6/L8-BO film with additives are 31.9 and 10.8 nm. Clearly, the additive effectively modulates the size of different phases compared to the molecular stacking behavior, suggesting that a smaller intermixing phase and a larger domain size of the acceptor phase may be more favorable for charge transport. In contrast, the DIO-processed PM6/BOEH-4Cl film exhibits a smaller ξ (29.7 vs. 27.5 nm) and a similar 2Rg (7.2 vs. 6.4 nm) compared to the as-cast film. Comprehensively, the more suitable nanoscale morphology of the optimized PM6/BOEH-4Cl film resulted in improved JSC and FF.
Charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analysis
Femtosecond (fs) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to trace the photoinduced hole transfer dynamics in the blend films. The main absorption peaks for the PM6 and NFAs are well separated, and thus the clear characteristics of the hole transfer process can be determined. Here, a 750 nm wavelength fs pulse was applied to selectively excite NFAs without pumping PM6. For the TA spectra of L8-BO and BOEH-4Cl neat films shown in Fig. S12,† the bleach peaks mainly appear at 650–850 nm, corresponding to the ground state bleach (GSB) and stimulated emission (SE) signal of NFAs after photoexcitation. Since the intensity of the 0–1 vibration absorption peak is stronger in L8-BO than in BOEH-4Cl, the TA spectra of L8-BO present a higher secondary GSB peak at 700–750 nm, expectedly. Fig. 5a and b show the 2D color TA spectra and a few typical TA spectra at indicated delay times after 750 nm excitation for PM6/L8-BO as-cast, PM6/L8-BO, PM6/BOEH-4Cl as-cast and PM6/BOEH-4Cl, respectively. Compared with neat NFA films, the emergence of two bleach peaks at 570–640 nm matches well with the absorption features of PM6, suggesting the hole transfer process from NFAs to the donor.

As shown in Fig. 5c, the kinetics of the hole transfer are extracted from the represented GSB signals of PM6 (at 605–610 nm, where NFAs show no signal here), showing a typical biphasic charge transfer behaviour as we reported before.63,64 Furthermore, the biexponential (I = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)) fitting results are listed in Table S5,† with τ1 and τ2 represent the process of interfacial hole transfer and NFA exciton diffusion before dissociation, showing the transfer rates of PM6/L8-BO as-cast (τ1 = 0.163 ± 0.008 ps; τ2 = 11.087 ± 0.554 ps), PM6/L8-BO (τ1 = 0.158 ± 0.008 ps; τ2 = 11.632 ± 0.582 ps), PM6/BOEH-4Cl as-cast (τ1 = 0.159 ± 0.008 ps; τ2 = 5.697 ± 0.285 ps) and PM6/BOEH-4Cl (τ1 = 0.148 ± 0.007 ps; τ2 = 5.942 ± 0.297 ps). Ultrafast interfacial hole transfer (<200 fs) occurred in all blend films, indicating small but sufficient hole transfer driving force. In addition, L8-BO based blend systems have larger τ2 than BOEH-4Cl based blend systems, in good agreement with a longer bleach lifetime in the L8-BO neat film compared with that in BOEH-4Cl (Fig. S12c†), indicating that the different intrinsic excited state properties of NFAs due to the change of the end group are well preserved in the blend films. On the other hand, the optimized blends show little effect on the hole transfer process owing to the advanced morphologies. Thus, the fastest τ1 in PM6/BOEH-4Cl leads to the highest EQE and championship JSC in device performance.
Interestingly, both as-cast and optimized PM6/BOEH-4Cl blend films show faster interfacial hole-transfer compared to the PM6/L8-BO counterparts. This is expected as our DFT calculation mentioned above predicted a larger charge transfer integral due to stronger interaction between PM6 and BOEH-4Cl. Additionally, the slightly larger HOMO offset between BOECH-4Cl and PM6 due to end group chlorination (as shown in UPS measurements mentioned above) may provide larger energetic driving force for hole transfer. We also note that the PM6/BOEH-4Cl blend may have a smaller reorganization energy associated with charge transfer, which could be due to its more rigid molecular backbone as predicted by DFT or a larger dielectric constant as measured by capacitance spectroscopy (Fig. S13†).65–67 A higher dielectric constant will also lower the exciton binding energy, which would also facilitate the interfacial hole transfer process.
To further evaluate the effect on the halogenation of NFA terminal groups on the device Eloss, especially on the non-radiative energy loss (ΔEnon-rad), we investigated the electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies (EQEEL) of the devices and calculate the ΔEnon-rad using −kTln(EQEEL).68 As presented in Fig. 5d, both as-cast PM6/BOEH-4Cl and PM6/BOEH-4Cl exhibit a higher EQEEL of 7.68 × 10−5 and 7.48 × 10−5 than the L8-BO based device, yielding a smaller ΔEnon-rad of 0.245 and 0.244 eV, respectively, much lower compared to that of as-cast and optimized PM6/L8-BO (0.253 and 0.263 meV, respectively) (Fig. 5e). The lower ΔEnon-rad in the optimized PM6/BOEH-4Cl may arise from the higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of neat BOEH-4Cl compared to L8-BO (Fig. S14†), improving the emission efficiency of CT states via hybridization and re-population with S1 states.69 Additionally, we also measured the Urbach energy of the optimized blend films via differential charging. As shown in Fig. S15,† the Urbach energy of PM6/BOEH-4Cl (31.7 meV) is lower than that of PM6/L8-BO (36.6 meV). The lower static disorder will increase the effective electronic bandgap of the blend systems, which have been reported to reduce both ΔErad and ΔEnon-rad.70,71 Overall, BOEH-4Cl with an intrinsically high PLQY and low static disorder in blend films will effectively suppress voltage loss, pushing the PCE of the optimized device to 17.4%.
Conclusions
In summary, a new NFA BOEH-4Cl was synthesized employing the assistance of DFT calculations. Compared to L8-BO, the calculations show that BOEH-4Cl with the chlorinated end groups has a broader light absorption range and a smaller electron reorganization energy, both of which are necessary for a high-performance NFA. Furthermore, the binding models and intermolecular interaction were studied based PM6 and two NFAs. The stronger intermolecular interaction of PM6/BOEH-4Cl relative to PM6/L8-BO facilitates the charge transport in the active layer, which can ultimately improve the JSC of the devices. The experimental results agree well with the calculation results and show that chemical calculations can efficiently and inexpensively assist the design of NFA molecules, which can be widely applied in the future. Finally, the optimal HBPS-processed devices of PM6/BOEH-4Cl yield a higher efficiency of 17.4% compared with PM6/L8-BO (14.5%). HBPS-processed, low non-radiative energy loss and high efficiency BOEH-4Cl-based binary systems further enhance the possibility of industrialization of OSCs.
