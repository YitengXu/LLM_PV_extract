    , Accepted 20th July 2019First published on 22nd July 2019AbstractA series of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] {bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine; qdt = quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate} derivatives was chosen to study the effect of structural modifications on the optoelectronic and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the molecules. Here, this study examined eight bipyridine derivatives with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing anchoring groups using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The results indicated that the electronic character of the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex is sensitive to the type of anchoring groups connected to the bpy ligand. The considered electron-withdrawing anchors notably narrow the energy gap of the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex in comparison to the electron-donating anchors. Interestingly, replacement of a hydrogen atom by electron-donating anchors in the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex leads to high molar absorption coefficients, whilst complexes with electron-withdrawing anchors can be redshifted significantly. The values of light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) were also calculated and compared in both gas and solvent phases. Moreover, the results reveal that substituting H atoms of bpy ligand by electron-withdrawing anchors dramatically increases the static first hyperpolarizability (β0) value. We expect that the present study would deepen the understanding of electron-donating and -withdrawing anchoring groups in diimine–dithiolate complexes and may contribute to the development of potentially high performance NLO materials.
1. Introduction
The past thirty years have witnessed a great deal of interest in the photophysical properties of [Pt(N^N)(S^S)] compounds, where N^N is a bidentate N-heterocyclic ligand such as bipyridine or phenanthroline (or a derivative thereof), and S^S is a bidentate dithiolate ligand. This specific structure is dominated by the existence in the same molecule of two different unsaturated chelating ligands, one of which is more easily reduced and the other more easily oxidized.1–3 These complexes have an excited state that has been described as having both MLCT and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) character, and the HOMO is of mixed character, being composed of substantial amounts of both Pt-based and dithiolate-based wave functions, leading to the assignment of this excited state as mixed metal/ligand-to-ligand′ charge transfer (MMLL′CT).4–7 Due to the unique electronic structures of this class of complexes,8–13 which include solution luminescence, solvatochromism, large molecular hyperolarizabilities, and large excited-state oxidation potentials, the study of the PtN2S2 complexes as dyes for solar cells,14,15 for the sensitization of the excited states of oxygen,10,13,16 as cation sensors17 and as non-linear optical materials18–20 has been reported. Up to now, the assignments of their excited state are based mainly on the pioneering experimental work of Eisenberg, as complemented by elementary theoretical work on frontier orbitals.21–23 Variation of the metal ion, dithiolate donor ligand and diimine acceptor ligand has been used to tune the charge-transfer (CT) and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of ligands in this class of complexes, as well as using molecular design.24
The development of 3rd generation solar cells, such as heterojunction cells, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), quantum dot cells, polymer solar cells and hot carrier cells, has been extensively investigated in the last few decades because of their potential use in optoelectronic and photonic devices.25–27 DSSCs represent an effective alternative to provide clean energy from the Sun among the traditional power cells.28–33 The discovery of Gratzel's cell in 1991 confirmed that TiO2 was the ideal semiconductor for DSSCs.34 They achieved a 7.1% energy conversion efficiency (ECE) along with an incident photon to electrical current conversion efficiency of around 80%. Recently, Zhang and Cole reported the structural nature of DSSC anchors and a detailed discussion of structure–function relationships of dye molecules bearing different anchors, as well as their optoelectronic properties.35 On the other hand, density functional theory (DFT) is a technique that treats energies as functions of electron densities and has been widely applied to the study of a large number of diimine–dithiolate compounds. Moreover, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have been used to establish an interpretation of photophysical properties of metal complexes.36–40 To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the influence of electron-donating and -withdrawing anchors on the PtN2S2 chromophore. Therefore, we report herein a DFT and TD-DFT study of Pt(bpy)(qdt) derivatives with various electron-donating and -withdrawing anchoring groups (see Fig. 1), including a comparison of their calculated geometries and electronic spectra with the available experimental data and assignment of the optical transitions crucial to their performance as NLO-active materials.

2. Computational details
In this work, the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex is chosen as the starting point and the two hydrogen atoms of the bpy ligand are symmetrically replaced by electron-donating and -withdrawing groups (Fig. 1). All ground state geometries of all considered complexes are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT)41 method employing the Gaussian 09 software package.42 Initially, we considered six DFT methods including B3LYP,43 BLYP,44 BP86,45 PBE,46 M0647 and Cam-B3LYP48 for complex 2b and then the calculated structural data from these methods were compared with their corresponding experimental values obtained by X-ray structure analysis of the complex [Pt(dcbpy)(bdt)].23 Based on the obtained results, the B3LYP method was selected as the most appropriate function, the structural data of which show the most similarity with the corresponding experimental values (see Table 1). Thus, the geometries of all the studied systems have been fully optimized without symmetry constraints by using the B3LYP functional. The standard 6-31G(d) polarized double-ζ basis set was used for H, C, N, O and S atoms,49 and taking into account the relativistic effect, the effective core potential (ECP) double-ζ (DZ) basis set of LanL2DZ was used for Pt(II).50 All optimized geometries of the models have zero imaginary frequency, which is an indication that local minimum geometries of the compound's overall potential energy surface were obtained.

Natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses were also carried out employing the aforementioned functional with LanL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis sets for Pt/C, N, O, S and H atoms.51 On the basis of the optimized ground state structures, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) was used in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases to predict the optoelectronic properties of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] derivatives. Note that a series of different functions was performed to determine the proper function to be used in the evaluation of excitation energy of complex 2b (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Compared with the experimental data,14 the CAM-B3LYP method made the best predictions of the transition energies, with a relatively small underestimation. So, the spectroscopic absorptions of all studied complexes were calculated using the CAM-B3LYP functional with 6-311G(d) (LanL2DZ for Pt atom). The polarizable continuum model (PCM)52 was used to account for the solvent effect.
The characteristics of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) play a significant role in the properties of excited states and transition character of the absorption spectra. Moreover, FMO analysis is also helpful in deciding the application of a material in electronic and optical devices. The HOMO–LUMO gap (HLG = ELUMO − EHOMO), calculated in terms of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) energies, was applied to explore the electronic properties of the considered systems. The hardness (η), softness (S), electronic chemical potential (μ) and electrophilicity index (ω) are the indicators of chemical stability and reactivity. These quantities have the following operational equations:53 η = (ELUMO − EHOMO)/2(1) S = 1/2η(2) μ = −(EHOMO + ELUMO)/2(3) ω = μ2/2η(4)
As an indicator of incident sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency, light harvesting efficiency (LHE) correlates the ability of dyes to harvest light. Based on a simple and clear equation, the LHE at the given wavelength λ can be calculated as:54 LHE = 1 − 10−A = 1 − 10−f(5)where A(f) is the absorbance (oscillating strength) representing the absorption energy (λICTmax) of the complex under study. According to eqn (5), the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the studied complexes has to be as high as possible to maximize the photocurrent response.
The average polarizability (α0) and first hyperpolarizability (β0) are defined as: (6) β0 = [βx2 + βy2 + βz2]1/2(7)where βi is defined by the following formula: (8)β0 is first hyperpolarizability, which is a third rank tensor and is known as the second-order nonlinear optical response (NLO) coefficient.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Molecular and electronic structures
In the present work, the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex and its derivatives with simple structure and high efficiency were chosen as the theoretical model. Note that the considered complex 2b was experimentally synthesized and plays an important role in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).14 As shown in Fig. 1, the molecular structure of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] can be divided into two parts, that is, the quinoxaline-2,3-dithiolate (qdt) ligand and Pt metal as electron donors and the 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) ligand acting as an acceptor to attach to the semiconductor surface such as TiO2 or ZnO. Herein, the position of substitution is two hydrogen atoms of the diimine ring that connect to the semiconductor surface. It seems that studying the effect of symmetric modification of the bpy ring on the performance of the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex as a sensitizer is a challenging task. Finally, [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] and eight substituted complexes, which are labeled as series a and b complexes, were selected as models and were fully optimized using the B3LYP functional with LanL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis sets for Pt/C, N, O and H atoms. According to Fig. S2 (ESI†), the Pt atom is coordinated by two N atoms of the bipyridine ligand and two S atoms of the dithiolate ligand forming a slightly distorted square planar geometry so that two five-membered rings are lying on the same plane. It is expected that the electron-donating and -withdrawing anchors have no significant influence on the geometrical parameters. In all cases, the Pt–N bond distances of each complex are shorter than the Pt–S bond distances, and the bond angle N–Pt–N is smaller than the bond angle S–Pt–S (see Table S1, ESI†). This trend suggests an atomic radius effect on the structural parameters. Inspecting the data in Table S1 (ESI†), one can easily conclude that Pt–N bond lengths are longer than those observed in bis-diimine compounds, while Pt–S distances have contracted, as compared to those of the related bis-dithiolenes;55 this is a consequence of a significant trans-influence effect.
In order to get a further understanding of the structures of Pt(bpy)(qdt) derivatives, their electronic structures have been probed. It is noteworthy that a detailed analysis of the electronic structure of dye molecules is very meaningful because the intrinsic electronic structure of the dye determines the extrinsic properties. From this point of view, a number of electronic properties such as the calculated HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO (ELUMO) energies, HOMO–LUMO gap (HLG), hardness (η), softness (S) and electrophilicity (ω) are collected in Table 2. A schematic diagram of the comparative electronic structures of the studied complexes is depicted in Fig. 2. In this figure, the energies of the frontier orbitals of all considered systems were plotted according to their energies. The HOMO–LUMO gaps (HLGs) are shown with solid arrows and the destabilization of MOs is represented by dotted arrows. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the HLG values decrease in the order of 2a > 1a ≈ 4a > R = H > 3a > 3b > 2b > 4b > 1b, which implies that the gap energies of series b complexes are smaller than those of series a complexes. The HLG values of 1b, 4b, 2b and 3b decreased by 19%, 15%, 13% and 7%, respectively, with respect to R = H. According to the previous studies, a smaller energy gap means a lower energy can make the dye excited, so it can improve the ability to utilize long wavelength light and increase the efficiency in DSSCs. Thus, the absorption spectra of series b complexes are red-shifted through the variation of the phenyl ring of the bpy ligand with electron-withdrawing anchors. These results could suggest abundant absorption in the long-wavelength region. The global indices of reactivity are quite important parameters because they illustrate the reactivity and stability of a molecule or complex. These parameters including hardness (η), softness (S) and electrophilicity (ω) can be calculated from the HOMO and LUMO energies to predict their stability. The softness of inhibitor molecules is the inverse of absolute hardness. The chemical reactivity of complexes increases with the increasing softness value and decreasing hardness value. Also, hard molecules have a high Egap, whereas soft molecules have a small Egap. Moreover, the electrophilicity index expresses the ability of an electrophile to acquire an additional electronic charge. From Table 2, it can be concluded that the chemical reactivity of series b complexes is higher than that of series a complexes. That is to say, the chemical reactivity of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] can be increased in the presence of electron-withdrawing anchors, especially an aldehyde anchor; whilst the electron-donating anchors retained constant the chemical reactivity of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)]. In this regard, analysis of electrophilicity data reveals that the electrophilicity increases for all complexes of series b compared to that of the isolated complex (R = H).

 Fig. 2  Comparison of the energy levels of series a and b complexes. The solid arrows represent the HOMO–LUMO gaps and dotted arrows represent the destabilization due to anchor variations. 
It was reported that the energy levels of dye sensitizers should be matched with the energy of the conduction band of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. For promising dye molecules, the energy of the LUMO should be higher than that of the conduction band of TiO2 (−4.00 eV vs. in a vacuum),28 and the energy of the HOMO should be lower than that of the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3− (−4.60 eV vs. in a vacuum).56,57 This fact can enable the excited sensitizer to obtain an electron from the redox electrolyte as well as the injection of electrons from the excited sensitizer into the conduction band of the semiconductor electrode. The obtained results reveal that the LUMO energy levels of the considered complexes are higher than −4.0 eV, and their HOMO energy levels are lower than −4.6 eV (Table S2, ESI†). Thus, these complexes, satisfactory in terms of energy level matching in the solvent, are suitable for DSSC applications.
Moreover, it was observed that the energy levels of the LUMOs of all complexes are affected strongly by the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituents on the phenyl rings of the bipyridine ligand, while this significant change for the HOMO energy levels was not included. The locations of the calculated HOMO and LUMO densities for all complexes are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). According to this figure, the HOMO is predominately localized over the dithiolate moiety and the LUMO is mainly distributed on the diimine moiety, whereas a limited contribution of metal and dithiolate ligands still exists. Hence, these considered compounds belong to the push–pull type of complexes, which will favor charge injection from the excited sensitizer to the semiconductor.
3.2. Linear optical properties
In order to reveal and describe the optical properties of series a and b complexes, TD-DFT calculations were performed both in a vacuum and solvent (acetonitrile). Although energy gaps are important indices when estimating the optoelectronic properties, UV-vis absorption spectra are more reliable and provide direct data to evaluate how these dye complexes will perform in the solar cells. Thus, Fig. 3 and 4 show the calculated UV-vis absorption spectra of series a and b complexes, and their related transition data including absorption energies, oscillator strengths and transition assignments are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The obtained results show that the absorption spectra in the visible region with the highest oscillator strength are in good agreement with the acceptable range required for a DSSC sensitizer.4,14,23,38,39 In comparison, the molar extinction coefficient of the studied complex (2b) is higher than the analogous Ni(II) sensitizer observed experimentally.4

According to Fig. 3, there were two major absorption bands in the UV region with a higher oscillator strength at around 310 and 370 nm for 1a and 3a, while only one absorption band was seen for 2a and 4a complexes in the solvent. That is, with the variation of donor strength from strong to weak (2a > 4a > 3a > 1a), the absorption band characteristics are transformed from a mono- to dual band. The finding of this dual-band absorption characteristic is vital for the various applications in light harvesting and light-emitting devices. On the other hand, when the electron-donating ability of the anchor increased, as represented in the case of 2a, the absorption intensity of the main band is found to be increased largely in the solvent phase. In this regard, the calculated oscillator strengths increased in the order 2a > 4a > 3a > 1a. In addition, comparing the series a complexes and isolated complex (R = H) indicates that the absorbance (oscillator strength) increased substantially, i.e., a hyperchromic shift occurred with the inclusion of the electron donating anchors on the bpy ligand.
As can be seen in Fig. 4, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the series b complexes have dual band character in both vacuum and solvent. In these cases, one absorption band is located in the visible and another in the ultraviolet region. The appearance of the absorption band in both the UV and visible to near-IR region thus justifies the dual band absorption characteristics. In comparison, the energy of the main transition varies both in both vacuum and solvent as 3b > 2b > 1b > 4b, whilst the molar extinction coefficients of these complexes do not differ significantly. It is interesting to note that a considerable bathochromic shift around 50 and 100 nm in absorption was achieved for series b complexes relative to that of the isolated complex (R = H). The results indicate that the influence of electron-withdrawing anchors on the bpy ligand is more significant in determining the optoelectronic properties of the designed Pt(bpy)(qdt) derivatives and also that the overall spectra can be redshifted by increasing the strength of the electron-withdrawing anchors.
From the above results, comparing series a with b complexes, it was noticed that the substitution of an electron-withdrawing anchoring group can redshift the overall spectra. The calculated LHEs with the oscillator strength at each absorption wavelength are listed in the same table. The LHEs of series a and b complexes are increased by 19.22% and 4.95%, respectively, with respect to the isolated complex (R = H). These findings highlight the importance of using donating- and electron-withdrawing anchoring groups to boost the LHE of DSSCs. Note that the LHEs obtained in the solvent were approximately two times higher than those obtained in the vacuum.
3.3. Nonlinear optical properties
In order to study the second-order nonlinear optical response (NLO) coefficient, the first hyperpolarizability (β0), polarizability (α) and the difference of dipole moment between the ground state and the crucial excited state (Δμ) of the considered doped clusters were calculated and are shown in Table 5 and Fig. 5. According to Fig. 5, the obtained first hyperpolarizability for series b complexes is much higher than that of the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex, and changed in the order of 1b > 4b > 2b > 3b. Among all of the considered complexes, 1b has the greatest hyperpolarizability (β0 = 195 × 10−30 esu). Moreover, the calculated values of β0 of series a complexes is less than that of the [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complex, except for 3a. The order of the calculated values of β0 of series a complexes is 3a > 1a > 4a > 2a. Overall, the first hyperpolarizability is significantly greater in the series b complexes compared to the series a complexes, which means that using the electron-withdrawing anchors is better than using the electron-donating anchors for achieving considerable β0. It is noteworthy that urea is the reference molecule that is used in the study of the NLO properties of molecular systems.58–61 Therefore, it is used commonly as a threshold value for comparative purposes. The calculated β0 value for 1b (195 × 10−30 esu) is found to be 870 times greater than the β0 value of urea (0.224 × 10−30 esu). On the other hand, the NLO responses of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] derivatives are larger than those of similar chromophores.18,62–65 As expected, variation in molecular design of the complexes, via changes in the metal ion and diimine and dithiolate ligands, can be used to affect changes in the nonlinear optical properties.3,66

 Fig. 5  Comparison of NLO response of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] derivatives with electron-donating and -withdrawing anchors. 
The charge transfer (CT) in the crucial transition has played one of the most significant roles for determining the NLO properties.67,68 Note that the crucial excited states of these studied complexes can be estimated using the TD-DFT calculation results mentioned above. Based on the two-level expression proposed by Oudar and Chemla,69,70 the static first hyperpolarizability is computed using the following equation:  where the β0 value is proportional to the oscillator strength (f0), the difference of dipole moments between the ground state and the crucial excited state (Δμ), and inversely proportional to the third power of the transition energy (ΔE) of the crucial excited state, the excited state with the largest oscillator strength. To understand the origin of β0 values, we focused on analyzing the crucial excited states of these compounds. The crucial excited state is defined as the lowest excited state with relatively large oscillator strength among all excited states. The major contributions of the crucial excited states of all compounds are also listed in Table 5. For example, the TD-DFT calculations show that the crucial excited state of compound 1a is the tenth excited state, which is formed by H → L+3 (87%) and H−5 → L+3 (6%) transitions. According to this expression, the transition energy is the decisive factor in the static first hyperpolarizability, regardless of all other factors. From Table 5, it can be found that the aldehyde substitution enhances the degree of CT by decreasing the excited energy, which leads to a remarkable increment of the static first hyperpolarizability. Therefore, the obtained outcomes suggest that the NLO response of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] derivatives could be engineered by variation of the bpy ligand properties.
4. Conclusion
In summary, a theoretical investigation was carried out to gain deeper insights into the geometry, electronic structure, and linear and nonlinear optical properties of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complexes with electron-donating anchors (series a) and electron-withdrawing anchors (series b) using DFT and TD-DFT calculations. The performance of six DFT methods including B3LYP, BLYP, BP86, PBE, M06 and Cam-B3LYP was examined by comparing the obtained results from these methods and experimental values. The structural data of B3LYP showed the most similarity with the corresponding experimental values. Thereupon, the B3LYP functional was chosen to be the most appropriate function with LanL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis sets for Pt/C, N, O and H atoms. From a theoretical point of view, it can be concluded that the performance of [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] complexes may be improved after the two hydrogen atoms of the bipyridine ligand are modified by electron-donating and -withdrawing groups. The results reveal that attaching electron-withdrawing anchors to [Pt(bpy)(qdt)] dramatically decreases the gap energy (HLG) value, especially for aldehyde anchors. It should be noted that the LUMOs of all complexes are in energetically close proximity to bind to TiO2 and the HOMOs of all complexes are in line with the redox potential of I−/I3−, which means that they are satisfactory in terms of energy level matching. Further, it was found that the substitution of electron-donating anchors in the solvent phase enhances the intensity of the absorption significantly; whilst the considered complexes with electron-withdrawing anchors showed absorptions redshifted by almost 20 nm from those of the isolated sensitizers. Interestingly, the replacement of H atoms by aldehyde in the bpy ligand (complex 1b) leads to a large static first hyperpolarizability (β0) value of 22596.09 a.u., which is the largest among the considered structures.
