    , Accepted 17th September 2017First published on 18th September 2017AbstractHerein, hierarchical superstructures of MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO hybrid nanocomposites with controlled morphologies, such as cube, spherical, dumbbell, and oval, were synthesized via an environmentally friendly hydrothermal treatment using green tea extract (GTE) as a reducing agent as well as a shape controlling agent. During the hydrothermal treatment, the GTE produces carbonate species in the presence of a strong oxidising agent, such as KMnO4, and reduces graphene oxide to graphene. Different superstructures of MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO were obtained by controlling the reaction time. A tentative growth mechanism for the generation of MnCO3 superstructures is proposed based on the morphologies obtained at different intervals of time. Additionally, MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO have been used as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. Galvanostatic charge–discharge study shows intercalation/de-intercalation of lithium, which is a characteristic of a battery material. Based on this, it can be concluded that the as-synthesized MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO with controlled morphologies are important electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. At a current rate of 0.06C, the MnCO3–rGO electrode produces a specific discharge capacity of 340 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles of charge–discharge. MnCO3–rGO is also examined for dopamine (DA) detection using amperometric techniques. Linear current responses were obtained for the DA concentration in the range between 0.2 and 300 μM with 0.999 as the correlation coefficient. The limit of detection (LOD) for DA is found to be 20 nM. The response is not hindered by the presence of other bioanalytes and is reproducible, and the prepared electrodes are stable over a month when stored in a vacuum dessicator.
1. Introduction
Serious attempts are underway to synthesize inorganic nanomaterials with an ordered morphology, orientation, complex formation, organization, aggregation, hierarchy, and super structures. This type of inorganic nanomaterials are important for their potential applications in the fields of electronic devices, ceramics, Li-ion batteries (LIBs), sensors, cosmetics, dyes, pigments, and catalysis.1–6 Specifically, the synthesis of metal carbonates, such as manganese carbonate, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, and strontium carbonate, with controllable morphologies has gained significant attention in the past few years due to the abundance and significant applications of these metal carbonates in various industries such as battery, paper, plastic, rubber, and paint.7–11 Literature survey shows that the number of studies reported on other carbonates is quite high as compared to that reported on MnCO3 superstructures. Among all other carbonates, MnCO3 has gained attention for LIB due to its high capacity and stability.12 Several studies have been reported in literature where MnCO3 has been synthesized with different morphologies, such as hollow microstructure, microsphere, dumbbell, cube, and rod, using various approaches including ultrasonic and chemical precipitation methods and solvothermal and micelle methods.11,13 The desired properties of MnCO3 directly depend on its shape and size. The promising applications of electronic devices have encouraged scientist to develop economical, lightweight batteries with a competitive lifetime and high energy density. At present, rechargeable LIBs are considered better energy storage devices as they offer high energy and power density along with a good cycle life.
MnCO3 nano/microstructures have been synthesized by various methods and used as electrode material for LIBs. Among them, the hydrothermal method is facile and widely used to obtain materials with intercalation/de-intercalation properties.1,14–18 Hydrothermal treatment for the production of LIB electrode materials requires low temperature, which favours the weak van der Waals interaction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. These interactions support self-assembly of molecular precursors and play a vital role in the formation of superstructures.19 Despite energy, health is another important societal issue, and thus, sensing of bio-molecules such as dopamine (DA) is very important. DA is a catecholamine neurotransmitter present in the human brain. It plays a significant physiological role in the central nervous system (CNS) and hormonal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. It can be used as an intravenous medicine to increase heart rate and blood pressure (BP) and plays a vital role in finding pathogenic states and developing forthcoming diagnostic approaches. DA neurotransmitter deficiency is accompanied with many serious diseases and sicknesses such as Parkinson's disease, senile dementia, HIV, epilepsy, and schizophrenia.20 Electrochemical detection of DA is attractive21 because it is simple, easy, and highly sensitive; thus, a vital task is to develop a simple, consistent, and highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of DA.
In general, for the synthesis of metal carbonates, low-cost metal salts are used to precipitate carbonates under high pressure conditions. In these cases, it is difficult to control the morphology. Structures and morphologies of nanomaterials can be easily tailored by the use of solution-based synthesis methods. Amongst the existing solution-based techniques, hydrothermal method has several benefits in terms of controllable synthesis. Parameters, such as solvent concentration, reaction temperature, and pH, can be easily controlled via this method. By changing additives such as surfactants, capping agents etc., it is possible to obtain different structures and morphologies. In this regard, eco-friendly methods are now becoming very popular, and a large number of studies are available for the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles by the hydrothermal route.22,23 However, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported on the synthesis of hierarchical architectured MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO superstructures via a hydrothermal method using GTE at low temperatures. GTE contains 30–40% water-soluble polyphenols. Polyphenols present in GTE are epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epicatechin (EC), which are significant antioxidants as well as reducing agents (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Major chemical constituents of GTE: (a) epicatechin, (b) epigallocatechin, (c) epicatechin-3-gallate, and (d) epigallocatechin-3-gallate. 
Among them, EGCG is the most dense and potential molecule for biological studies.24 In this method, organic molecules present in GTE may selectively bind on the surface of the molecule to prevent rapid nucleation and construction of metal carbonates and control the morphology as desired. Therefore, it is a challenge for material scientists to consider this route over available chemical methods.
Introduction of a mixed conducting carbonaceous network is reported in literature to increase rate performances in LIBs. This network offers a pathway for lithium-ion diffusion in LIBs and electron transfer in electrochemical sensing. This conducting carbonaceous network leads to an improvement in electrochemical properties and conductivity.25 Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is a one-atom-thick layer of carbon with two-dimensional nanostructures. It has gained attention ever since it was experimentally discovered in 2004. These sheets of RGO exhibit a high surface area (2630 m2 g−1) and high conductivity (103 S m−1) comparable to those of carbon nanotubes (CNT). The abovementioned properties supplement the candidature of RGO for several applications such as in supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, solar cells, and hydrogen storage.18 In this study, we report the synthesis of MnCO3–rGO using a GTE-assisted hydrothermal method. The obtained materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, and TEM. The characterised material was studied as an anode material for LIBs and electrochemical detection of DA at the nanomolar level concentration.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
KMnO4 (analytical grade) and H2O2 were purchased from SD Fine Chemicals Ltd, Mumbai, India. DA and graphite powder were procured from Sigma Aldrich, Bengaluru, India. Green tea leaves were purchased from a local shop in Tumakuru, Karnataka, India.
2.2. Preparation of the GTE (green tea extract)
The purchased green tea leaves were washed several times with tap water, followed by distilled water, and finally dried in air. The dried green tea leaves were powdered using a mixer grinder. The resulting powder was refluxed in water. The obtained extract was used for the synthesis of MnCO3/MnCO3–rGO superstructures.
2.3. Preparation of graphene oxide
Herein, 10 g graphite and 5 g sodium nitrate were added to 240 mL of 95% sulfuric acid in a round-bottom (RB) flask. KMnO4 (30 g) was slowly added to the abovementioned RB flask for about an hour, and the reaction mixture was maintained at 0–5 °C. The mixture was continuously stirred for 12 hours. After this, 300 mL of distilled water was added dropwise through the inner edge of the RB flask. The temperature of the mixture was increased rapidly to 98 °C and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. Then, 100 mL of 30% H2O2 was added to the abovementioned solution. After this, 5% HCl was used to wash the product followed by deionized water, and the mixture was dried at room temperature.26,27
2.4. Synthesis of MnCO3 & MnCO3–rGO nanocomposites
Herein, 0.3 g of KMnO4 crystals were dissolved in 15 mL of water in a beaker, then 0.5 g of GTE was added to the KMnO4 solution, and the mixture was stirred. The resulting solution mixture was shifted to a 20 mL Teflon-lined hydrothermal bomb and heat treated for different time intervals (1, 2, and 3 days) at 180 °C in a hot air oven. After completion of the reaction, the hydrothermal bomb was allowed to naturally cool down. The acquired brown powder was washed several times with water and ethanol in sequence and dried. The MnCO3–rGO composite was also synthesized by the same method with the addition of 20 mg of graphene oxide and 2-day hydrothermal treatment. The plausible reaction expected for the development of MnCO3 during hydrothermal treatment is depicted as follows: KMnO4 + GTE + H2O → Mn2+ + CO32− + H2O(1) Mn2+ + CO32− → MnCO3↓(2)GTE contains carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Under hydrothermal conditions and in the presence of a strong oxidising agent such as KMnO4, the entire organic component present in GTE undergoes oxidation and forms carbonate ions. Furthermore, the GTE acts as a strong reducing agent; it reduces Mn7+ (KMnO4) to Mn2+ (MnCO3). The formed Mn2+ combines with CO32−; this leads to the formation of MnCO3. Moreover, it reduces graphene oxide to graphene. Only few studies have been reported on the synthesis of MnCO3 superstructures in which different surfactants and reducing agents have been used, as tabulated in the Table 1.

Present work




Experiments were carried out by taking different Mn2+ precursors (manganese chloride, manganese acetate, and manganese sulphate), but the formation of MnCO3 was not observed. This suggests that multi-step redox reaction occurs between KMnO4 (oxidizing agent) and GTE (reducing agent) to yield the final product MnCO3.
2.5. Characterization
The samples were characterized using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Vibrational frequencies of the material were analysed by a Bruker-alpha Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The external morphology and size of the materials were determined using the Hitachi-7000 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and JEOL 3010 transmission electron microscope (TEM). Electrochemical investigation of LIB performance was conducted using a Biologic science battery testing unit. Detection of DA was conducted using the CHI660D potentiostat (CH instrument, Austin, USA).
2.6. Electrochemical measurements
For the fabrication of electrodes, MnCO3–rGO (80 wt%), super conductive carbon black (15 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride binder (PVDF 5 wt%) were mixed in a mortar and ground well. A few drops of N-methyl pyrrolidinone were added to obtain an ink. The ink was applied on a pre-treated Cu foil of 16 mm diameter. The process of coating and drying the ink were repeated to obtain a loading level of the active material weight in the range of 2.0–3.0 mg cm−2. Finally, the electrodes were dried at 100 °C under reduced pressure for 12 h. The Cu foil was etched in dilute HNO3, washed several times with water, rinsed with acetone, and air dried before being used as a substrate. Coin-type cells (CR2032) were assembled in a glove box under an argon environment (MBraun Model Unilab). Lithium metal was used as both counter and reference electrode, and a commercial electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and dimethyl carbonate (2:1:2 v/v) was used as an electrolyte. A Celgard porous polypropylene membrane (2400) was used as a separator. The assembled coin cells were subjected to cyclic voltammetry at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling at various current states in the voltage range of 0.01–3.00 V using Bio-Logic potentiostat/galvanostat (BCS 805). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed at open circuit voltage. All measurements were carried out at 22 ± 2 °C.
2.7. Electrode modification for dopamine sensing
Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (3 mm diameter) were polished with alumina slurry (1, 0.3, and 0.05 microns) followed by rinsing with water prior to electrode modification. The electrodes were further sonicated in water–ethanol (1:1) for about 30 min and then dried in air. For modification of electrode, 2 mg of the MnCO3–rGO composite was dispersed in 1 mL of water–isopropanol mixture (7:3 ratio). Then, 10 μL of 5% solution of Nafion was added to it, and the mixture was sonicated for 30 min. After this, 10 μL of this suspension was drop cast on the surface of the GC electrode and dried at room temperature. The modification of GC with MnCO3 was carried out in the same way.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD studies
The phase and purity of the synthesized MnCO3 crystal were characterized by a powder X-ray diffractometer, as shown in Fig. 2. All diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern can be indexed to MnCO3 with a rhombohedral phase (JCPDS no. 44-1472).

The XRD patterns of the samples show narrow intense peaks, which indicate high crystallinity of the material. The FULLPROF software was used to find out the Rietveld refinement (Fig. 3(a)). This was obtained by speculating the Rc (167) space group for the cubic structure. Many parameters of the data points were fitted by the pseudo-Voigt function.

Fig. 3(b) shows the packing diagram obtained by the diamond software. The refined parameters such as occupancy and atomic functional positions are presented in Table 2. The parameters for fitting the data points (Rp, Rwp, and χ2) show good agreement between the observed and refined XRD patterns for the rhombohedral MnCO3 phase.

3.2. FTIR studies
The FTIR spectra (Fig. 4) of MnCO3 prepared at 180 °C for 1–3 days show a strong band between 1400 and 1460 cm−1, which is due to the carbonate peak. The peak at 2992 cm−1 confirms that MnCO3 is stabilized by the organic content (CH2) present in GTE. The sharp peaks at 791, 861, and 2502 cm−1 are due to different vibrations of carbonates in the Mn complex. A broad peak at 3408 cm−1 is assigned to water molecules. From FTIR spectra, it is confirmed that there is a dominant absorption band for carbonate ions present in the synthesized MnCO3.28

3.3. SEM and TEM studies
During the primary nucleation step, Mn2+ and CO32− form the nuclei of MnCO3; this leads to the formation of nanoblocks due to the crystal environment of rhombohedral assembly.29 At the stage of crystal growth, organic colloids are capped by nanoblocks and subsequently form structures depending on the strength and geometry of the organic colloids. As a result of this process, MnCO3 with hierarchical superstructures are produced.1Fig. 5 shows the SEM, TEM, and resemblance images of the synthesized MnCO3 superstructures. It is clear that MnCO3 synthesized at 180 °C for 1 day by hydrothermal treatment shows cube-like structures (Fig. 5(a1–a3)), and these cubes subsequently turn into spherical shapes. Moreover, the combination of two spheres initiates the formation of a dumbbell shape. When the reaction time increases from 1 day to 2 days, the morphology changes from combined spheres to dumbbells (Fig. 5(b1–b3)).
 Fig. 5  SEM, TEM, and resemblance images of MnCO3 hierarchicals synthesized for 1 day (a1, a2, and a3), 2 days (b1, b2, and b3) and (c) 3 days (c1, c2, and c3), respectively. 
The dumbbell shape changes to oval (Fig. 5(c1–c3)) when the time of hydrothermal treatment is increased to 3 days. The TEM images show that the size of the cubes is in the range from 0.2 to 0.4 μm, and the width and height of dumbbells are in the range from 0.2 to 0.3 μm and from 0.4 to 0.7 μm, respectively. The oval-shaped structures are also of the same size as dumbbells; the only difference is that the middle region of the dumbbells is completely filled by MnCO3 particles. This is due to aggregation of MnCO3 crystals to form a stable oval shape. Fig. 6 shows the schematic for the formation of MnCO3 hierarchical structures. It clearly shows that the MnCO3–rGO material has graphene sheets, which are freely present as well as wrapped on the MnCO3 structures prepared via 1-, 2-, and 3-day hydrothermal treatment, as shown in Fig. 7.

4. Li-ion battery performance
MnCO3 is one of the potential candidates for use as a Li-ion battery anode. The possible mechanism during galvanostatic charge–discharge and cyclic voltammetry is explained by Zhang et al. The electrochemical study shows that MnCO3 undergoes many sequential reactions. During the discharge process, MnCO3 decomposes into Mn and Li2CO3 (eqn (3)), followed by partial reduction of Li2CO3 to Li2O (eqn (4)). On the other hand, Mn undergoes oxidation to MnO (eqn (5)). This mechanism is similar to that of carbon-based electrodes, and the large capacity values during charge–discharge cycle are similar to those of many pure conversion materials. The reactions occurring during the discharge process are as follows: MnCO3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Mn + Li2CO3(3) MnO + 2Li+ + 2e− → Mn + Li2O(4) Mn + Li2O → MnO + 2Li+ + 2e−(5)
Li storage behaviour of the MnCO3 and rGO composite samples subjected to different durations of hydrothermal treatment is shown in Fig. 8.

The voltage vs. specific capacity profiles for the MnCO3 samples prepared by 1-, 2-, and 3-day hydrothermal treatments are shown in Fig. 9 (the tests were carried out at C/15 rate).
 Fig. 9  Discharge–charge curves of first cycle at a current rate of C/15 for MnCO3–rGO synthesized by hydrothermal treatments for three different durations. 
We found that all three samples provided a discharge plateau at 0.5 V vs. Li+/Li when half-cell studies were carried out. Fig. 10 shows the corresponding cycle life for over 10 cycles at the same C rate. We found that the sample with a dumbbell morphology (obtained via 2-day hydrothermal treatment) exhibits good performance. The first-cycle discharge capacity is about 1130 mA h g−1, whereas those for the samples treated for 1 day and 3 days are 413 and 418 mA h g−1, respectively. Even after 10 cycles, the discharge capacity obtained for the sample treated for 2 days is twice the value obtained for the sample treated for 1 day. Moreover, dumbbell morphologies are known to have smaller diffusion distances along the rod holding the spheres. Hence, further studies were carried out with the MnCO3 sample prepared by 2-day hydrothermal treatment, hereafter referred to as the dumbbell MnCO3–rGO composite.
 Fig. 10  Cycling performances of the MnCO3–rGO material synthesized via hydrothermal treatments for three different durations. 
Cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out by assembling the coin cells of the dumbbell MnCO3–rGO composite in the voltage range of 0.1–3.0 V with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  CV plots obtained between 0.01 and 3 V at the scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for MnCO3–rGO prepared by 2-day hydrothermal treatment. 
In the forward sweep, two oxidation peaks are observed at 1.7 and 2.5 V, resulting from the oxidation of Mn0 to Mn2+ and Mn2+ to higher oxidation state, respectively. During the reverse sweep, reduction peaks are centered at 0.6 V, which can be ascribed to the reduction of Mn2+, whereas the other peak at around 1.5 V is due to the reduction of higher oxidation states of Mn; moreover, there is a peak indicating impurity by lithium.12 The obtained cyclic voltammograms match well with those reported in literature with respect to the performance of MnCO3 as a Li-ion battery anode. The voltammograms are reproducible even after 25 cycles; this suggests that the material does not pulverise, and the redox chemistry is highly reversible.
The galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profile obtained at a current rate of C/15 is shown in Fig. 12. We found a broad plateau region around 0.5 V when the voltage was reduced galvanostatically to 0.01 V, which was also clearly visible even after 50 cycles. This is important to avoid lithium plating on the anode. The corresponding cycle life and coulombic efficiency are presented in Fig. 13; we have found that the primary discharge capacity is 1133 mA h g−1, and a discharge capacity of 340 mA h g−1 is retained after 50 charge–discharge cycles. Throughout the cycling test, a coulombic efficiency of about 90% is maintained.

 Fig. 13  Cycling performances of MnCO3–rGO prepared by 2-day hydrothermal treatment. 
It is interesting to note that the final discharge capacity is almost equal to the theoretical value of 467 mA h g−1; this can be attributed to the optimum utilization of material and other contributions arising from the pseudocapacitive nature of the electrode material, faradaic aids of the side reactions, and formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) by an irreversible reaction.30 The better performance of the dumbbell-shaped MnCO3–rGO composite can also be due to the unique micro-nano assembly along with inter-connections and wrapping of graphene sheets with MnCO3. Primarily, more number of interspaces and graphene assembly between nanoparticles in micro-dumbbell structures offer varied Li+ and electron passages and boost the diffusion of ions and electrons. Furthermore, the hierarchical structured MnCO3–rGO dumbbell composite can accommodate volume variations as compared to the bare MnCO3 material during the respective charge–discharge process.
Rate capacity study was carried out by subjecting a coin cell to a variety of currents. For this purpose, a cell was first cycled at a C/15 rate, and then, the current rates were increased to C/10, C/5, and 1C by maintaining 6 charge–discharge cycles at each current rate. Furthermore, the current rates were reduced to C/15 in a similar fashion. It can be seen from Fig. 14 that a discharge capacity of 340 mA h g−1 is obtained at a C/15 rate. As the current rate increases, there is a gradual decrease in the specific discharge capacity and vice versa. The ascending and descending specific discharge capacities match well at a particular current rate. This clearly shows that the 2-day hydrothermally synthesized MnCO3 dumbbells with the rGO composite are a good, stable, and potential anode material for Li-ion batteries.
 Fig. 14  Rate performances at different current densities of MnCO3–rGO prepared by 2-day hydrothermal treatment. 
AC impedance measurements were performed on both MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO composite, as shown in Fig. 15. The plot is a combination of semicircles and spikes; the spikes are attributed to the Warburg impedance of long-range Li-ion diffusion, whereas the semicircles indicate interface impedance between the metal current collector and electrode. The MnCO3–rGO composite shows semicircles at lower frequencies as compared to bare MnCO3; this indicates that lower resistance/improved conductivity in turn results in enhanced performance of the MnCO3–rGO composite.

5. Electrochemical sensing
We further evaluated the ability of electrochemical applicability of the synthesized materials, i.e., MnCO3–rGO composite and MnCO3, for electrochemical sensing of dopamine (DA).

Fig. 16 shows the CV of the MnCO3–rGO composite, MnCO3, and unmodified GC electrodes obtained in the presence and absence of 2.1 mM DA in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with pH 7.4 at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. Among the three electrodes, the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode shows excellent electrochemical response (Fig. 16(a)) as compared to the MnCO3-modified GC electrode (Fig. 16(b)) and unmodified GC electrodes (Fig. 16(c)).

We have also obtained cyclic voltammograms of all the abovementioned electrodes by increasing the concentration of DA while maintaining the same electrolyte and scan rate condition, as shown in Fig. 17(a)–(c). As the concentration of DA was increased, the current response increased, and maximum current response was obtained for the MnCO3–rGO-modified GC electrode (Fig. 17(a)). The complete results suggest that the MnCO3–rGO-modified GC electrode shows better electrochemical activity towards dopamine sensing than the MnCO3-modified GC electrode and unmodified GC electrode. We further used amperometric techniques for determining the lowest detectable concentration of DA using the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode. Fig. 16(d) displays the amperometric response of the MnCO3–rGO-modified GC electrode upon the addition of different concentrations of DA solution to 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) under continuous stirring with an applied potential of <0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The current response of the electrode increases linearly with the increasing DA concentrations. The calibration plot for the corresponding data is shown in inset of Fig. 16(d). For DA concentration in the range from 0.2 to 300 μM, linear responses towards current were obtained with a 0.999 correlation coefficient, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.02 μM (20 nM) based on the signal-to-noise ratio. These results are superior as compared to the previously reported literature, as listed in Table 3.31–37

5.1. Selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability
The study of selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability of MnCO3–rGO composite-modified glassy carbon electrode is important for the estimation of good performance of a sensor. Selectivity of the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode was checked by injecting a 10-fold higher concentration of bioanalytes such as ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), glucose (Glu), and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) under the experimental conditions with applied potential. From Fig. 18, it is clear that there is no change in DA current response after injection of other potential bio-interference analytes. This shows that the established sensor selectively detects DA even in the presence of other analytes.
 Fig. 18  Amperometric response of the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode upon injection of 30 μM DA and 300 μM other bioanalytes such as AA, UA, glucose, and NADH in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.4) at an applied potential of 0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl. 
Reproducibility of the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrodes was studied by establishing 5 electrodes, and reproducibility was measured by taking 20 μM of DA, as shown in Fig. 19. The established MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode was stored in a PBS solution (pH 7.4) containing freshly prepared 30 μM DA in a vacuum desiccator for electrochemical measurements. Amperometric measurements were performed at five-day intervals, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 20. The obtained response decreased about 5.3% for the MnCO3–rGO composite-modified GC electrode after one month.

6. Conclusion
We have reported the green synthesis of the MnCO3 and MnCO3–rGO superstructures using GTE. Organic molecules with many polyphenolic groups present in GTE control the growth of the MnCO3 crystals. XRD patterns show that the obtained MnCO3 is rhombohedral in nature. FTIR spectra show a strong peak due to the presence of carbonate ions. The SEM and TEM images clearly show that morphologies are extremely dependent on GTE and reaction time (cube, dumbbell, and oval). The synthesized material acts as a good anode material for LIBs, and it shows a specific discharge capacity of 340 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles of charge–discharge. These materials were used for sensing nanomolar concentrations of dopamine, and the limit of detection was found to be 20 nM. It was also found that the MnCO3–rGO composite gave a current signal for DA even in the presence of other bioanalytes such as AA, UA, Glu, and NADH, which was reproducible and stable over a month when the electrodes were stored in a vacuum dessicator. Based on the experiments, the proposed method is very simple, one pot, green, and cost effective for large-scale synthesis of MnCO3 with controlled morphology.
