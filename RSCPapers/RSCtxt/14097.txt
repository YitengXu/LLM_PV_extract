    , Accepted 12th May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractAs one of the most important chemicals for human beings, ammonia is produced by the well-known Haber–Bosch process, which consumes tremendous amounts of energy and simultaneously results in unwanted emissions. Very recently, the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) emerged as an intriguing technique for nitrogen fixation, which can be driven by sustainable power sources, such as solar and wind energy. Moreover, ammonia produced by e-NRR can be realized under mild conditions. Nevertheless, the electrochemical nitrogen fixation suffers from a low yield of ammonia due to the scaling relations of intermediates and competing hydrogen evolution. In addition, the progress in the e-NRR is also hindered by unreliable ammonia measurements. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recently reported e-NRR electrocatalysts, and highlight the e-NRR mechanisms and promising strategies for the rational design of e-NRR electrocatalysts. Importantly, the nitrogen contaminations, which resulted in false positive results, are also mentioned and a rigorous ammonia detection method is presented. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects for e-NRR catalysis are discussed. This review gives a fresh impetus to the rational design of high-performance e-NRR electrocatalysts.

1. Introduction
Ammonia is a key precursor for synthetic fertilizers, and has revolutionized the food supply for human beings.1,2 The ever-increasing population of the world in the past century is directly or indirectly related to the artificial synthesis of ammonia. In addition, ammonia also serves as a key component for some nonbiological uses, such as dyes, explosives and resins.3 Notably, anhydrous ammonia can be used as a very promising hydrogen carrier and renewable fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) owing to its high hydrogen density.4 Although N2 is very abundant in the atmosphere (78% by volume), the extremely high bond energy of NN (940.95 kJ mol−1) makes the fixation of N2 at ambient temperature and pressure very challenging. Currently, the synthesis of ammonia in industrial plants is mainly based on the well-known Haber–Bosch process, which was established in 1908. The annual ammonia production by the industrial Haber–Bosch process is 150 million metric tons.5 The main drawbacks of the Haber–Bosch process are high energy consumption and large amounts of emission, since the reaction requires both high temperature (300–500 °C) and pressure (150–300 atm), which roughly consumes ∼2% of the world's energy supply and generates 400 million metric tons of fossil fuel-derived CO2 annually.6–8
Therefore, it is highly desired to develop an alternative approach with friendly operating conditions, low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions. Many efforts have been devoted to the biological N2 fixation using nitrogenase, which is more energy efficient than the Haber–Bosch process. However, the biological N2 fixation is limited by the sluggish kinetics and instability of nitrogenase.9–11 Recently, an electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) under mild conditions emerged as a promising technology for nitrogen fixation.12–16 The electricity required for the e-NRR can be generated from sustainable solar and wind energy.17 However, it is worth noting that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) equilibrium potentials are very close to the e-NRR equilibrium potentials in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.18 Accordingly, the HER process strongly competes with the e-NRR on the cathode. Moreover, the e-NRR with multiple proton–electron coupling and transferring reactions exhibits a more sluggish kinetic than the HER with only two-electron transfer. In recent years, many efforts have been made to develop highly-efficient e-NRR electrocatalysts. However, the reported ammonia yield rates are still in the ppm scale. Moreover, many electrocatalysts with unreliable detection of ammonia may be misleading to the researchers for designing optimal catalysts for the e-NRR. Thus, developing strategies to fabricate e-NRR electrocatalysts with high-performance and reliable operation methods for accurate ammonia detection are definitely urgent in the e-NRR research community. In this review, we first present the well accepted e-NRR mechanisms, as well as experimental evidences, in order to provide an in-depth understanding of the e-NRR process at the atomistic level. In the second part, we summarize, classify and discuss the recently reported e-NRR electrocatalysts, and put emphasis on some promising strategies for improving e-NRR performance. Finally, we highlight some challenges and perspectives for the design of e-NRR electrocatalysts.
2. Possible mechanism of the e-NRR
In general, the reported e-NRR process can be classified into two pathways: (i) dissociative pathway, and (ii) associative pathway (Fig. 1a–c).19 In the dissociative pathway, the triple NN bond of dinitrogen is firstly cleaved, and subsequently a single N atom is adsorbed on the electrocatalyst surface. Hydrogenations of the N atom occur in the following steps to release an NH3 molecule. In contrast, in the associative pathway, dinitrogen is adsorbed on the catalyst in an end-on or side-on manner. In the end-on manner, one proton is adsorbed on the N atom far away from the surface, and simultaneously one electron is transferred to the N atom. After that, hydrogenations on the two N atoms follow two possible processes: distal process and alternating process. In the distal process, hydrogenation preferentially takes place on the N atom far away from the surface of catalyst, while in the alternating process the hydrogenation of end-on dinitrogen takes place alternately. In the side-on manner, the adsorbed dinitrogen is hydrogenated alternately to realize the splitting of a NN bond. This mechanism is the so-called enzymatic pathway. Nørskov and coworkers theoretically calculated the trends in catalytic activity over a range of transition metals based on an associative or dissociative pathway.20 The results revealed that the most active e-NRR metals are Mo, Fe, Rh and Ru. However, the competing HER on these metals greatly reduce their faradaic efficiency. In contrast, the early transition metals, including Sc, Y, Ti and Zr, exhibited stronger N-adatoms adsorption than H-adatoms. Recently, some advanced experimental techniques were employed to monitor the intermediates helping to reveal the possible e-NRR mechanism. For example, Yao et al. employed a powerful surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) technique to probe the e-NRR mechanism on the Au surface.21 The resulting spectra demonstrated the existence of N2Hy (2 ≤ y ≤ 4) adsorbate with bands of the H–N–H bending at 1453 cm−1, the –NH2 wagging at 1298 cm−1, and the N–N stretching at 1109 cm−1 at a potential below 0 V vs. RHE, suggesting an associative pathway of the e-NRR on the Au surface. The authors further used the SEIRAS technique combined with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) to investigate the e-NRR process on Rh.22 Based on the experimental evidence, they proposed that the e-NRR on Rh follows a novel pathway involving two steps: an electrochemical reduction of N2 to N2H2 on the Rh surface and a chemical-decomposition of N2H2 to NH3 and N2 in electrolyte (Fig. 2a). Likewise, Qiao and coworkers successfully probed the N2H2 intermediates on in situ fragmented bismuth nanoparticles by using online DEMS.23 In their study, no m/z signal at 27, 31, and 33 was detected, indicating the absence of N2H4 intermediate. But the presence of an m/z signal at 30 confirmed the formation of N2H2 during the e-NRR process. N2H2 intermediates together with the detected NH3 varying with the applied voltage suggested that the e-NRR might follow an associative pathway on the in situ fragmented bismuth nanoparticles.

Recently, the e-NRR process on transition metal nitrides was proposed to follow the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism (Fig. 2b).24 In this mechanism, a vacancy is firstly created on a lattice N atom after the protonation of the nitrogen atom on the surface of transition metal nitrides (TMNs). After that, dinitrogen from the electrolyte refills the N vacancy, and is further hydrogenated to release two NH3 molecules and regenerate the N vacancy. Nevertheless, the nitride catalyst itself could decompose to ammonia if the migration of the N-vacancy from the surface to the bulk rather than the regeneration of N-vacancy with dinitrogen.25 Importantly, the sustainable catalytic reaction may cease if the surface vacancy gets poisoned by O, H, or OH.
3. Noble metal-based e-NRR catalysts
3.1 Au-Based materials
Bao et al. reported that tetrahexahedral Au nanorods enclosed by {730} crystal planes possess excellent e-NRR catalytic performance, with a high NH3 production yield rate of 1.648 μg h−1 cm−2 and a N2H4·H2O production yield rate of 0.102 μg h−1 cm−2 at −0.2 V vs. RHE.27 The {730} is a stepped facet composed of the (210) and (310) sub-facets which are beneficial for the e-NRR process as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3a and b). To enhance the effective utilization of expensive Au, the authors further fabricated Au sub-nanoclusters on a TiO2 support for the e-NRR.28 As expected, the Au sub-nanoclusters exhibited an effective and stable e-NRR catalytic performance, with significant enhancement in NH3 production yield (21.4 μg h−1 mgcat−2) and faradaic efficiency (8.11%). Moreover, it is feasible to improve the adsorption of N2 and the first protonation of *N2 by exposing Au high-index facets. For example, Tian et al. reported high-index faceted Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) synthesized by a modified seed-mediated method.29 The AuNPs with multiple high-index facets, such as (553) and (551), exhibited a NH3 production rate of 9.22 μg h−1 cm−2 and a high faradaic efficiency of 73.32% at −0.3 V. The DFT calculations revealed that Au(551) and Au(553) possessed a lower energy barrier at the rate determining step (RDS) (*NN + H+ + e− → *NNH) than the Au(110) surface. On the other hand, the competing *H adsorption was suppressed on the Au(553) and Au(551), leaving more active sites for the e-NRR. In additional to exposing high-index facets of Au, tuning the electronic structure of Au is also an effective way to enhance the e-NRR activity. Zheng et al. employed a CoOx layer to modify the local electronic structure of Au nanoparticles.30 As revealed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the introduction of the CoOx layer resulted in the creation of Au1+ species on the Au nanoparticles due to the electron transfer from Au0 to Co3+ (Fig. 3c). DFT calculations show that, compared with Au0, Au1+ species has a stronger interaction with the N2 molecule, and is much more active in catalyzing the e-NRR process via reducing the uphill free energy of RDS (Fig. 3d). Besides improving the intrinsic Au catalytic activity, it is also effective to enhance the e-NRR performance by promoting the accessibility to N2. For instance, Liu et al. reported that Au nanoparticles chemically anchored on a two-dimensional Ti3C2 surface were highly active toward the e-NRR.31 The Ti3C2 served as an extractor for adsorbing N2 from air. The synergistic effect on the interface between Au particles and Ti3C2 weaken the NN bonds and lower the total energy barrier of the e-NRR. Zhang et al. reported that heterogeneous Au–Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively fix nitrogen to NH3 through the e-NRR.32 The high e-NNR activity of Au–Fe3O4 was attributed to the synergistic effect of the strong N2 adsorption ability of Fe3O4 and the intensive Au–O bonds that can improve the reaction energetics and kinetics. The synergistic effect between Au and supports are also found in MoS2 nanosheet supported Au,33 Au/TiO2 hybrid,34 and core@shell structured Au@SnO2.35 Nazemi et al. evaluated the e-NRR performance of hollow Au nanocages (AuHNCs) under ambient conditions.36 The AuHNCs exhibited great enhancement in ammonia yield rate and faradaic efficiency relative to solid Au nanoparticles of various morphologies (cubes, rods, or spheres), which was ascribed to the increased surface area and confinement effects.

3.2 Pd-Based materials
Wang et al. reported an efficient e-NRR catalyst of Pd nanoparticles supported on carbon black, which realized a NH3 yield rate of ∼4.5 μg mgPd−1 h−1 and a faradaic efficiency of 8.2% at 0.1 V vs. RHE.37 Based on DFT calculations, they proposed that the in situ generated Pd hydride could effectively facilitate the hydrogenation of N2 to N2H* via a Grotthuss-like hydride transfer pathway. In a further work, Deng et al. improved the e-NRR activity of Pd nanoparticles by surface modification using oxygen-rich tannic acid.38 Zhao et al. found that Pd cube nanocatalysts with an exposed (100) facet exhibited higher e-NRR activity than the Pd nanocatalyst with exposed (110) or (111) facets.39 DFT calculations revealed that the energy barrier for generating NH3 from *NH3 or N2 adsorption on the surface of (100) is lower than that on the (110) or (111) surface. Indeed, the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of N2 experiments indicated a strong N2 adsorption on the Pd(100) surface. Pd-Based alloys with a porous structure and desired electronic structure were also fabricated for efficient e-NRR catalysis.40–42 For example, Pang et al. synthesized a porous Pd3Cu1 alloy with the desired electronic structure for suppressing HER.40 Zhao et al. prepared PdPb nanosponges in which Pb served as an inhibitor for HER, facilitated the adsorption of dinitrogen and decreased the energy barrier of the *NNH intermediate.42 Ma et al. introduced vacancy defects in a PdZn nanocatalyst by an acid-etching strategy.43 The vacancy defects were proposed to play a vital role in N2 molecule adsorption and hydrogenation for the e-NRR and simultaneously suppressing the HER. Moreover, the e-NRR catalytic activity of the Pd alloy can be modified by crystal phase engineering.44 For example, the body-centered cubic (BCC) PdCu nanoparticles were demonstrated to be much more active and selective for ammonia synthesis than face-centered cubic PdCu. Theoretical calculations revealed that the efficient e-NRR catalysis originated from the enhanced Pd 4d electronic activity in BCC PdCu due to the strong orbital interactions between Pd and adjacent Cu atoms. Hydride treatment for Pd is another effective strategy to lower the Gibbs free-energy (ΔG) of the process of the first protonation step of *NN. Recently, Xu et al. reported nanoporous PdH0.43 (np-PdH0.43) synthesized by chemical dealloying of Pd–Al alloys and in situ hydrogen injection methods (Fig. 4a).45 The hydrogen atoms of PdH0.43 participated in activating and binding nitrogen atoms to form e-NRR intermediates, which was confirmed by the FTIR spectra collected in the electrolyte after the e-NRR test using nanoporous Pd deuteride (Fig. 4b and c). In addition, np-PdH0.43 has a much lower Gibbs free-energy of *NNH formation (0.65 eV) than np-Pd (0.91 eV) in an alternative enzymatic pathway. Furthermore, the hydrogen injection of np-Pd, leading to the positive shift of d-band center of Pd, also contributed to the stabilization of *NxHy intermediates and thus achieved an excellent e-NRR activity with an ammonia yield rate of 20.4 μg h−1 mg−1 and faradaic efficiency of 43.6% at −0.15 V vs. RHE (Fig. 4d).

3.3 Ru-based materials
Ru is located almost at the top of the volcano diagram of Skulasson, thus has become an intriguing electrocatalyst for the e-NRR.46–54 Yao et al. investigated the e-NRR process on Ru thin film by using SEIRAS.46 The N2Hx intermediate with the NN stretching band (∼1940 cm−1) was detected during the electroreduction of N2 in 0.4 M HClO4. It was revealed that the formation rate of N2Hx intermediate was faster than its consumption, suggesting an effective way to enhance the e-NRR activity by weakening the binding strength of the N2Hx intermediate on the Ru surface. Theoretically, the bottleneck of Ru metal is its low e-NRR selectivity. Active Ru stepped sites are easily occupied by a high coverage of *H.55 Such pre-adsorbed *H reduce the active sites available for the protonation of N2 and hinder the NRR process. Ding et al. fabricated Ru cluster-doped CeO2 nanorods with abundant oxygen vacancies as e-NRR electrocatalysts.54 The authors proposed that CeO2 promoted the N2 adsorption and low-valence Ru nanoclusters were catalytic sites for N2 activation. Geng et al. synthesized Ru single atoms distributed on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru SACs/NC) by pyrolyzing Ru-containing derivative of ZIF-8 (Fig. 5a), which exhibited a striking e-NRR performance with high ammonia yield rate (120.9 μg mgcat−1 h−1) and high faradaic efficiency (29.6%) at −0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.05 M H2SO4 electrolyte.50 As shown in Fig. 5b, the intense TPD peak at 340 °C indicated that dinitrogen was adsorbed strongly on Ru single atoms, which might facilitate the sequential e-NRR steps. DFT calculations demonstrated that Ru1-N3 and Ru1-N4 structures were favorable to the adsorption of N2 and the protonation of *N2 (Fig. 5c). Similarly, the high e-NRR catalytic activity of Ru single atoms supported on N-doped carbon was also observed by Tao et al.49 In addition, the authors showed that the presence of ZrO2 in Ru SACs/NC played a vital role in suppressing the competitive HER and thereby enhancing the faradaic efficiency.49 Peng et al. reported single-atomic Ru modified Mo2CTx MXene nanosheets as an efficient e-NRR electrocatalyst.48 DFT calculations combined with operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that the Ru single atoms served as the electron back-donation centers for N2 adsorption and activation, and decreased the energy barrier for *NNH formation. Liu et al. presented a Ru@Ti3C2MXene catalyst with uniform distribution of Ru for efficient E-NRR activity. However, the authors did not investigate whether Ru is atomically dispersed or not.56

4. Non-noble transition metals
4.1 Mo-Based catalysts
Mo is an important element for catalytic nitrogen fixation in biological systems.57 The occupied d orbitals of a Mo-based material can back donate electron into antibonding orbitals of N2 to weaken the triple NN bond, which initiate the nitrogen reduction reaction.58 By far, Mo2C,58 MoS2,59,60 1T-MoS2@Ti3C2,61 MoSe2,62 and Mo3Si63 have been explored for electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. For instance, Mo2C nanodots embedded in carbon nanosheets (Mo2C/C), fabricated by a molten salt synthesis method, delivered an NH3 yield rate of 11.3 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 at −0.3 V vs. RHE and faradaic efficiency (1.1%) after being coated on hydrophilic carbon cloth.58 Mo2C/C coated on hydrophobic cloth exhibited lower ammonia yield rate of 5.7 μg h−1 mg−1 but higher faradaic efficiency (7.8%) relative to that coated on hydrophilic carbon cloth, which was ascribed to the suppressed HER (Fig. 6a). DFT calculations revealed that Mo2C confined by oxygen-containing groups in carbon nanosheets showed a high N2 adsorption energy of −0.842 eV (Fig. 6b and c). In addition, oxygen-doped Mo carbide embedded in N-doped carbon also exhibited comparable e-NRR activity and faradaic efficiency.64 MoS2 was also employed to catalyze the e-NRR, which exhibited an intriguing e-NRR activity.59 DFT calculations suggested that the high e-NRR catalytic activity of MoS2 originated from the positively charged Mo-edge which played a key role to activate N2 molecules. Benefitting from the adjacent Mo atom pairs in the holes of the basal plane, Chen et al. prepared porous atomic layered MoS2 by one-step calcination.60 From DFT calculation results, N2 can be effectively activated by adjacent Mo atom pairs with a laying-down manner. Han et al. reported Mo single atoms dispersed on N-doped carbon (Mo SACs/NC) for an efficient e-NRR. The critical role of Mo–N sites in Mo SACs/NC was confirmed by control experiments. The catalyst with optimized Mo loading exhibited a NH3 yield rate of ∼34.0 μg h−1 mgcat.−1 and a faradaic efficiency of ∼14.6% in 0.1 M KOH.65 Ma et al. fabricated both the Mo single atoms and Mo carbide onto N-doped carbon nanotubes to achieve an integrated synergy for the e-NRR.66 DFT calculations suggested that the Mo single atoms in the catalyst provided large *H coverage for the N2 activation and facilitated hydrogenation on the e-NRR selective Mo2C sites.

4.2 Bi-Based materials
Bi is well-known for its low toxicity and environmental benignity.67 There are two major advantages for using a Bi atom to fix a nitrogen molecule into ammonia. First, the half-filled Bi 6p band electrons can be effectively back donated to the nitrogen empty π* antibonding orbitals, enhancing the adsorption of dinitrogen and thereby improving e-NRR activity.23 Second, semiconducting Bi can also sufficiently suppress the competitive HER process due to its poor hydrogen adsorption.68 Hao et al. presented a strategy to enhance both the e-NRR activity and selectivity using a Bi nanocrystal catalyst and electrolyte containing potassium cations.69 The prepared Bi nanocrystals supported on carbon black (BiNCs) exhibited an outstanding faradaic efficiency of 66% and a stable ammonia yield of 200 mmol g−1 h−1 (or 0.05 mmol cm−2 h−1) in 1 M K2SO4 (pH = 3.5). The projected density of states of *NNH showed that the Bi 6p bands and N 2p orbitals overlapped, suggesting the strong interaction between Bi 6p bands and N 2p orbitals which could stabilize the intermediates and reduce the energy barrier for RDS. The highest barriers of the first protonation step (ΔG*NNH) were reduced both on solvated Bi(012) (from 2.88 eV to 2.42 eV) and Bi(110) (from 2.80 eV to 2.42 eV) surfaces, which was consistent with the red-shift energies of Nads 2p orbitals. Li et al. fabricated a mosaic bismuth nanosheet (BiNS) by in situ electrochemically reducing the bismuth oxyiodide precursor.70 Compared with Bi nanoparticles, BiNS exhibited enhanced e-NRR activity, which was ascribed to the high density of edge sites and the p-orbital electron delocalization in the BiNS surface. Xia et al. also prepared a Bi nanosheet using a similar approach, and disclosed that N2 was more likely to adsorb on the surface of the edge plane (010) instead of the basal plane (001) based on DFT calculations.71 In addition, Yao et al. showed that the in situ formed fragmented Bi nanoparticles were able to efficiently catalyze N2 to ammonia in neutral and acidic electrolytes.23 The catalytic activity of Bi was also improved by introducing a porous carbon coat or support to improve the conductivity.72
To improve the intrinsic e-NRR activity of Bi, Wang et al. prepared defect-rich Bi nanoplates from Bi2O3 by bombardment using low-temperature plasma.73 The prepared defect-rich Bi nanoplates exhibited much higher e-NRR activity than the crystalline Bi. Fang et al. also showed that an amorphous BiNi alloy is much more e-NRR active than its crystalline and metal counterparts.74 Based on theoretical calculations and experimental analysis, it was proposed that the Ni substitution can modify the electronic structure of Bi and improve the electron transfer. On the other hand, the amorphization created a defect-rich surface and disordered atomic arrangement for effective N2 adsorption (Fig. 7). In addition, bismuth oxides were also reported as active and stable e-NRR catalysts.75,76

4.3 Other transition metal-based catalysts
Zhang et al. prepared V2O3 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on shuttle-like amorphous carbon (V2O3/C) and a VO2 hollow microsphere as e-NRR catalysts.77,78 The VO2 hollow microsphere achieved a high NH3 yield of 14.85 μg h−1 mg−1 at −0.7 V in 0.1 M Na2SO4. Fang et al. synthesized multivalent vanadium oxide nanosheets (mVOx) with oxygen vacancies.79 After physically mixing with reduced graphene oxide for improved conductivity, mVOx exhibited excellent e-NRR activity, which was attributed to the hydrophilicity and oxygen vacancies. Cao et al. fabricated bi-Ti3+ pairs on anatase TiO2 by introducing Zr4+ with a larger radius into the lattice to remove one oxygen between two adjacent Ti4+ sites.80 Based on DFT calculations and experimental evidence, the adjacent bi-Ti3+ pairs were identified as the active centers for efficient N2 chemisorption and activation. In addition, several individual studies showed that TiO2 with oxygen defects possessed enhanced e-NRR activity, demonstrating that introducing oxygen defects to the TiO2 surface is an effective way to improve its e-NRR activity.81–83 Some other transition metal oxides, such as Y2O3 doped zirconia, and Sb2S3 nanoparticles anchored on SnO2, have also been reported to be e-NRR active.84,85 Sufficient surface-terminated and low-coordinated Fe sites in FeTe2 in a recent report can also adsorb N2 molecules and activate the NRR process.86
5. Metal-free electrocatalysts
5.1 Black phosphorous
Owing to its unique electrochemical properties, black phosphorous (BP) emerged as a hot material in the frontier field of energy storage and conversion.87,88 Recently, BP was investigated for e-NRR catalysis. For example, Liu et al. prepared BP quantum dots (QDs) and dispersed them on black tin oxide (SnO2−x) nanotubes to avoid their agglomeration and improve their electric conductivity.89 The resulting BP@SnO2−x exhibited impressive e-NRR activity and stability, which was attributed to their synergistic superiority. Wang et al. assembled BP QDs on MnO2 nanosheets for e-NRR catalysts, delivering a high ammonia yield rate of 25.3 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and faradaic efficiency of 6.7% at −0.5 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.90 XPS characterization revealed the intimate electronic interactions between BP QDs and MnO2 nanosheets which were beneficial for the e-NRR process. Zhang et al. synthesized few-layer BP nanosheets (FL-BP NSs) from commercial bulk BP by using a liquid exfoliation method.91 Compared with bulk BP and powdery BP, FL-BPNSs exhibited a significantly higher performance with a NH3 yield rate of 31.37 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.7 V in 0.01 M HCl electrolyte (Fig. 8a). DFT calculations showed that the active orbitals at the zigzag and diff-zigzag edges of FL-BP NSs were favorable to adsorb N2 and activate the NN triple bond, which facilitate the electroreduction of N2 to NH3via an alternating pathway (Fig. 8b).

Boron atoms with sp2 or sp3 hybridization can effectively interact with N2via an end-on or side-on pattern, thus have shown great potential for N2 fixation.92–96 Specially, for B-doped graphitic carbon, the smaller electronegativity of boron than carbon results in the formation of positively charged B atoms, which possess enhanced N2 adsorption ability and thus result in the formation of a B–N bond. Yu et al. fabricated a series of B-doped graphene (BG) by thermal reduction of a mixture of HBO3 and graphene oxide.97 The BG with highest BC3 content exhibited the best performance, suggesting that BC3 serves as the major e-NRR electrocatalytic site. Recently, B4C was also reported to be highly e-NRR catalytically active. Qiu et al. prepared B4C nanosheets via liquid exfoliation of bulk B4C.98 They showed that the B4C nanosheet is one of the most active e-NRR catalysts reported by far. DFT calculations revealed that the protonation process on a B4C(110) surface in the *NH2–*NH2 → *NH2–*NH3 reaction needed to overcome an uphill barrier of 0.34 eV.


5.2.2 N and P doped carbon materials. 
N-Doped porous carbon with a tuned electronic structure has been extensively investigated in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO2 reduction.99–101 Recently, Liu et al. applied nitrogen doped porous carbons (NPCs) with tunable N species for e-NRR catalysis.102 The NPC with the highest pyridinic N content exhibited the best e-NRR activity, suggesting that pyridinic N plays a vital role in e-NRR catalysis (Fig. 9). Chen et al. showed that the appropriate incorporation of B–N pairs could improve the e-NRR catalytic activity of a carbon matrix.103 The edge carbon atoms near doped B–N bonds were identified as the active sites. The doping of B–N pairs modified the electronic structures of edge carbon atoms, which was beneficial for the e-NRR while suppressing the competing HER process. Besides N doping, P doping has also been reported to be an effective way to improve the e-NRR activity of carbon matrices.104,105 For instance, Yuan et al. showed that P-doped carbon nanotubes (P-CNTs) delivered ∼100 times higher NH3 yield rate than CNTs.105 DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption of N2 was much stronger on P atoms than on the C atom next to the P atom, suggesting that P sites with Lewis acidity should be the catalytic sites for e-NRR. It was further proposed that the e-NRR on P-CNTs followed the distal pathway.

6. Strategies for improving e-NRR efficiency
Currently, the major challenges of current e-NRR are the low NH3 yield rate and poor selectivity (low faradaic efficiency), which are associated with the catalysts. To improve the performance of an e-NRR catalyst, it is necessary to suppress the competing HER, and simultaneously enhance the intrinsic e-NRR activity. In this section, we will highlight and discuss some effective strategies for improving the e-NRR catalytic activity and selectivity, including vacancy engineering, alloy engineering, hydrophobic engineering and dispersing active sites at the atomic level.
6.1 Vacancy engineering

6.1.1 N-Vacancy. 
Lv et al. recently reported polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with abundant nitrogen vacancies (NVs) for e-NRR catalysis.106 The created NVs located at the two-coordinated N (N2c) sites as revealed by the XPS spectra. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments revealed that the NVs could increase the electron density of their adjacent carbon atoms (Fig. 10a and b). The electrons of the adjacent carbon can further transfer to the adsorbed dinitrogen for activating the NN bond and facilitating the reduction of N2 to NH3. The PCN with optimized NVs showed a high NH3 yield rate of 8.09 μg mgcat.−1 h−1, which was nearly ten times higher than that of pristine PCN without nitrogen vacancies (Fig. 10c). Jin et al. fabricated a 2D layered W2N3 nanosheet with surface N vacancies, and applied it to e-NRR catalysis.107 The 2D W2N3 was demonstrated to be e-NRR active with a high NH3 production rate and faradaic efficiency. DFT calculations showed that N vacancies on the W2N3 surface produced an electron deficient area, which can be accommodated by the unpaired electrons of dinitrogen. The adsorbed dinitrogen could be further activated by the electron donation of W to the empty antibonding orbitals of dinitrogen. Furthermore, the N vacancies on 2D W2N3 was proven to be stable under e-NRR conditions by the ex situ XAS experiments (Fig. 10d–f). In addition, for some metal nitrides, the in situ generated N-vacancy could also serve as the active sites following a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, which was confirmed by the isotope experiments.25,107–110

6.1.2 O-Vacancies. 
Theoretically, oxygen vacancies can generate available localized electrons, which can be donated to the antibonding orbitals of dinitrogen to enable the activation and following hydrogenation of N2 to NH3. The introduction of O vacancies can be tuned via several methods such as heteroatom dopant,54,81,83,111,112 thermal reduction,82,113 and electrochemical polarization.81 For example, Tong et al. prepared Fe-doped W18O49 nanowires with abundant oxygen vacancies on carbon fiber paper for efficient e-NRR catalysis.111 Fe doping increased the oxygen vacancies and simultaneously exposed more active W sites. Theoretical calculations showed that high level oxygen vacancies lead to a shift of W18O49 Fermi level toward the π* state of dinitrogen, which was beneficial for the electron back donation from W18O49 to dinitrogen for e-NRR. Sun et al. reported that the e-NRR activity of WO3 was positively correlated with the concentration of oxygen vacancies.113 DFT calculations suggested that the surface oxygen vacancies of WO3 improved the adsorption of N2 and lowered the e-NRR thermodynamic barrier. Ding et al. also showed that the oxygen vacancies on the Ru-doped CeO2 surface were beneficial for N2 adsorption.54 Nonmetallic dopants such as boron can also promote the generation of O vacancies in transition metal oxides (TMOs). Chu et al. reported that replacing the partial O in the MnO2 lattice with B could readily lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which was revealed by the XPS spectra.112 DFT computations showed that the oxygen vacancies were favorably generated at the B-adjacent sites rather than non-B-adjacent sites. The B dopants and oxygen vacancies synergistically induced asymmetric charge distribution, and thereby improved the catalytic activity of the neighboring Mn sites.

6.2 Alloy engineering
As aforementioned, an alloy engineering strategy is also an effective way to introduce second catalytic sites and/or alter the electronic structure of catalytic sites, and thereby enhances the e-NRR activity.40,41,44,47 For example, Jin et al. fabricated fusiform-like RuCu alloy nanosheets, which exhibited a much higher NH3 yield with 53.6 μg−1 h−1 mg−1 and faradaic efficiency of 7.2% than single Ru (15 μg−1 h−1 mg−1 and 1.7%).47 The enhancement was attributed to the synergistic catalysis of the Ru and Cu sites, which optimized the adsorptive activation of N2 and desorption of intermediates. Tong et al. investigated the e-NRR activity of nanoporous PdCu alloys with different Pd/Cu atom ratios.44 The average NH3 yield rates of the electrocatalysts increased in the following order: Pd3Cu1 > Pd6Cu1 > PdCu > Pd > Cu. The e-NRR activity of Pd3Cu1 electrocatalysts is nearly 4.2 and 4.6 times that of the nanoporous Pd and Cu. Hence, the author proposed that the introduced Cu modified the electron structure of Pd and suppressed the competing HER process. Wang et al. reported an efficient Pd3Bi electrocatalyst with a nanoporous ordered intermetallic structure.114 The operando XAS measurements and DFT calculations indicate that the adsorption and desorption of N species on Bi sites can be modulated by electronic interactions of Pd–Bi compounds. Benefitting from Bi introduced to Pd, the HER process can be effectively suppressed.
6.3 Hydrophobic engineering
Compared with N2 molecules with extremely low solubility in aqueous electrolyte, the abundant H3O+ species in the electrolyte are much more favorable for the mass transfer, resulting in the high coverage of catalytic sites by H+. An effective strategy to alleviate H+ migrating to the surface of the catalyst is the surface hydrophobic modification of substrates or electrocatalysts. Yu et al. fabricated a thin hydrophobic carbon layer on the SnS nanosheets surface to enhance its e-NRR activity.115 The hydrophobic carbon layer served as a protective shield to limit the proton availability at the SnS surface and simultaneously enhance the N2 adsorption and conductivity, thus greatly boosted the e-NRR activity of SnS. In addition, a hydrophobic zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF) was also employed to regulate water availability towards the electrocatalyst surface.116–118 For example, Yang et al. reported that ZIF-8 coated nanoporous gold exhibited excellent e-NRR catalytic activity with a NH3 yield rate of 28.7 μg h−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 44% (Fig. 11). The hydrophobic porous ZIF-8 shell on nanoporous gold was demonstrated to be significant for suppressing hydrogen evolution by hindering the diffusion of reactants.118 However, we speculate that the ZIF-8 structure cannot survive under the harsh electrochemical condition.119

6.4 Single-atom catalysts
Single-atom catalysts (SACs), a class of materials with atomically distributed active sites, have emerged as a hot research field in the catalytic community due to their maximum atomic efficiency and unique catalytic ability.120 In recent years, many highly dispersed single atoms such as Ni,121 Fe,122–124 Mo,65 Cu,125 Ru,49,50 and Co,126 have been applied for desirable electrocatalytic reactions for nitrogen fixation. The electronic structures of single-atom active centers can be effectively tuned by the surrounding coordination atoms. For example, the Fe–N4 species in Fe-SAC/NC, which was quantitatively analyzed by the EXAFS fitting, was demonstrated to be responsible for the excellent e-NRR performance of Fe-SAC/NC (Fig. 12).124 It was shown that the Fe 3d electrons were transferred to the N 2p, resulting in the activation of dinitrogen for the subsequent hydrogenation. Besides Fe–N4, Fe–N3 species and Cu–N2 species in Cu SAC/NC were also found to be able to enhance the e-NRR activity.122,125 Recently, it was reported that Fe–MoS2 with protrusion-shaped Fe single atoms exhibited strong interfacial polarization, thus efficiently activated NN triple bonds to boost electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis.127 Liu et al. employed DFT calculations to systematically study the e-NRR activity of dozens of SACs. They predicted that Ru and Rh single atoms supported on g-C3N4 are the most promising electrocatalysts for the e-NRR.128

7. Perspectives
Electrochemical nitrogen fixation under mild conditions is one sustainable alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process. In this review, we have briefly summarized recent efforts devoted to developing electrocatalysts, including noble-metal based materials, transition-metal based materials, and metal-free materials, for e-NRR catalysis. In addition, strategies such as vacancy engineering, and hydrophobic engineering have been proposed to boost e-NRR by enhancing N2 adsorption ability and hindering the competing HER process. To develop e-NRR catalysts applicable for practical application, substantial further efforts are still required. To accelerate the development, we need to understand the fundamental mechanism of e-NRR at an atomistic level by using a combination of theoretical calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. Theoretical calculation is a powerful tool to investigate e-NRR reactions on an electrocatalyst surface at an atomistic level. Various e-NRR mechanisms have been predicted based on the theoretical calculations. However, the computational methods usually overlooked the influence of electrolyte molecules and/or ions. The calculation results are pH-independent, and are not usually consistent with the experimental findings. Therefore, it is highly necessary to reveal the e-NRR intermediates and structural transformations of electrocatalyst by means of in situ experimental techniques, such as in situ XPS, in situ TEM and in situ XAS. In addition, some electrolytes or cations are found to be beneficial for the e-NRR catalysis. For example, lithium-mediated aqueous solutions are able to activate N2 and suppress the HER process.129 K+ cations in the electrolyte can be easily adsorbed on the surface of Bi nanoplates, and thereby modify the surface electronic structures of Bi to enhance the yield and selectivity of ammonia. Therefore, further research efforts should be also focused on understanding the influence of electrolytes on e-NRR catalysis. Furthermore, modulating the mass transfer at the interface of catalysts is another effective strategy to promote e-NRR. For example, exfoliated covalent organic frameworks (ECOF) prepared by Yan and coworkers can decrease the accessibility of H+ to the surface of boron-doped carbon paper (BCP) and promote the molecular collisions between N2 molecules and BCP.130
8. Challenges
It is worthwhile that current electrochemical N2 fixation still faces a grand challenge for its low ammonia yield rate. The majority of investigated materials exhibit more negative onset potentials for e-NRR than those for HER. The highest ammonia yield rates reported in the literature are only several dozens of micrograms per hour per square centimeter of electrode (or per milligram of catalyst), which is obviously far below the requirement for practical applications. On the other hand, due to the low ammonia yield rate of catalysts, the influence of ambient ammonia contamination on the results could be significant, which make it very difficult to accurately measure the e-NRR-generated NH3. It has been reported that the ammonia contaminations can be from various sources, such as the atmosphere (∼10 μg m−3), human respiration, reaction setups, nitrogen-containing chemicals, and impurity of N2 supply.131,132 In particular, even the highly pure N2 may contain NH3 and easily reduced NOx specie.133 For example, a highly pure N2 with only 0.006% of NO, can readily lead to the formation of NH3 under electroreduction conditions with a yield rate of 26.3 μg cm−2 h−1.134 Moreover, the decomposition of nitrogen-containing catalysts also causes a false positive result.135 Recently, Andersen et al. attempted to reproduce the e-NRR activities of the most promising materials reported in the literature via a rigorous experimental procedure using 15N2. However, the results showed that the majority of them are not reproducible. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a testing procedure for reliable ammonia measurements. In e-NRR experiments, spectrophotometric methods including an indophenol blue method and Nessler's reagent are widely used for the detection of ammonia. However, indophenol blue assay is not accurate when the NH3 concentration is up to 500 μg L−1. Compared with indophenol blue, Nessler's reagent is favorably used under both acidic and alkaline media.136 Ion chromatography is capable of quantifying extremely tiny amounts of ammonia with a low detection limit of 1 μg L−1.137 Therefore, to ensure accurate quantification of ammonia, a combined spectrophotometric and IC measurement is suggested. Moreover, to confirm the origin of ammonia, 15N isotopic labeling experiments should be performed. Herein, we presented a rigorous e-NRR experimental procedure as shown in Fig. 13. Although the accurate detection using the rigorous experimental measurement is highly required for the current electrocatalysts reported, it is not the case for an e-NRR electrocatalyst with desirable ammonia yield, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the possible contamination.
