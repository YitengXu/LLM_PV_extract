    , Accepted 12th February 2021First published on 15th February 2021AbstractKesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells fabricated from DMSO molecular solutions exhibit very different open circuit voltage (Voc) when the tin precursor has a different oxidation state (Sn2+vs. Sn4+). Here, the grain growth mechanism of the two absorbers was used as a platform to investigate the large voltage deficit issue that limits kesterite solar cell efficiency. The secondary sulfide composed Sn2+ precursor film took a multi-step phase fusion reaction path with secondary SnSe2 existing on the film surface during the whole grain growth, which forms in a very defective surface whereas a uniform kesterite structured Sn4+ precursor film took a direct transformation reaction path along with a top down and bottom up bi-direction grain growth that forms a uniform and less defective surface. Characterizations show that both absorber films exhibit similar bulk electronic properties with comparable band and potential fluctuations, Cu–Zn disorder level and tail states, and the much lower Voc of the Sn2+ device than the Sn4+ device primarily comes from the serious recombination near the junction as revealed by the large ideality factor and reverse saturation current. Our results demonstrate that the large Voc deficit of the kesterite solar cell mainly comes from surface deep defects that originated from the multi-phase fusion grain growth mechanism. The high efficiency (>12%) and low Voc deficit (<300 mV) of Sn4+ processed CZTSSe solar cells highlight that direct phase transformation grain growth is a new strategy to fabricate high quality kesterite absorbers, which can also be applied to other multi-element thin film semiconducting materials.

Broader context
With the fast growth of economics and decline of available fossil fuels, the worldwide demand for renewable energy has never been so strong. Photovoltaics is one of the most important areas of renewable energy. Compared to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and CdTe thin film solar cells, the kesterite (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) solar cell uses earth abundant and less toxic elements and thus has great potential for low cost and large area production. However, the efficiency of the kesterite solar cell (12.6%) is much lower than similar structured Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (23.35%). The main issue of kesterite solar cells is the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and improving Voc is a must for practical application. Many reasons including Cu–Zn disorder, secondary phases, band gap and potential fluctuations, and deep defects have been attributed to the large Voc deficit of kesterite; however, which of them is the critical limiting factor and how it is formed are yet to be identified. In this report, we have used two Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 absorbers that are similarly fabricated from DMSO solution using either Sn2+ or Sn4+ as a tin precursor but exhibiting very different device Voc as a platform to investigate the origin of the Voc deficit of kesterite solar cells. Our results show that the large Voc deficit of the Sn2+ solution processed device comes from the defective absorber surface that originated from the multi-step secondary phase fusion grain growth mechanism. On the contrary, direct phase transformation grain growth of the Sn4+ solution based absorber achieved a record low Voc deficit kesterite solar cell with an efficiency of 12.4%. Our results not only identified the origin of the large Voc deficit of kesterite but also demonstrate that the direct phase conversion grain growth mechanism is a new and effective strategy to further improve the kesterite solar cell efficiency.

1. Introduction
Kesterite (Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4, CZTSSe) semiconductors are promising photovoltaic materials due to their earth-abundant composition, excellent absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1), tunable band gap (1.0–1.5 eV, from pure selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 to pure sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4), and high theoretical efficiency.1–7 However, the world record efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cell is only 12.6%,3,5 much lower than that of its counterpart chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell, which is 23.35%.8 The limiting factor of the kesterite solar cells is the large open-circuit voltage deficit (Voc,def = VSQoc − Voc, VSQoc is the maximum achievable Voc based on the Shockley–Queisser limit9). Many reasons, including band gap and electrostatic potential fluctuations,10 tail states,11 Cu–Zn disorder,12 deep defects,13 recombination at interfaces,14 and secondary phases15 have been attributed to the Voc,def. Recently, there are reports showing that Cu–Zn disorder is not directly responsible for the large Voc deficit.11,12,16 Identifying the key reason for this critical issue and its origin is the first step to break the bottleneck of the kesterite solar cell and further boost its efficiency to the application level.
The challenge in achieving this goal is how to rationally control the electronic property of kesterite. As the sister photovoltaic absorber material of CIGS, the fabrication of CZTSSe is also learned from CIGS, which generally takes two steps. First, deposition of a precursor film, either by a solution3,17–22 or vacuum approach;2,8,23 second, annealing the precursor film in a chalcogenide atmosphere (S, H2S, Se, H2Se, or a mixture of them, so called sulfurization/selenization) at high temperature to facilitate kesterite formation and grain growth. For the vacuum approach, precursor films are generally deposited by sputtering or thermal evaporation from metal, sulfide or selenide targets.2,5,23 For the solution approach, except for metals24 and sulfides,3 oxides,21,25 metal salts18,26 and nanocrystals17,27 are also used as precursors. In both cases, the precursor films are mostly composed of a mixture of multi phases and the grain growth from the precursor to absorber films is more or less similar to that of CIGS,28 that is, the formation of a low melting point secondary phase, Cu2−x(S,Se), Sn(S,Se)2 or alkali selenides, followed by diffusion of metal ions into the liquid and formation of the kesterite32 or fusion of secondary phases into kesterite.5,29–31 For this grain growth mechanism, secondary phases are always involved in the grain growth. The Zhuang group32 recently reported the direct formation of the CZTSe phase from a precursor film deposited by sputtering a single target of Cu–Zn–Sn–Se quaternary compound, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 11.95% with a high fill factor (FF) of 76.2%.
Recently, we have reported that the oxidation states of tin precursors (SnCl2·2H2O vs. SnCl4) can control the composition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution processed precursor films due to different chemical reactions of Sn2+ and Sn4+ with thiourea (Tu, the S source) and solvent DMSO.4 The coordination of Sn2+ with Tu (which forms Sn(Tu)xCl2) leads to a high crystalline precursor film containing secondary phases including SnS whereas coordination of Sn4+ with DMSO (which forms Sn(DMSO)2Cl4) results in an amorphous film with a kesterite structure. The CZTSSe absorbers fabricated from the two precursor films have similar composition and crystallinity but exhibit a dramatic difference in photovoltaic performance. An efficiency of 8.84% with a large Voc,def of 0.391 V was obtained from the Sn2+ absorber, whereas the Sn4+ absorber achieved an efficiency of 12.4% with a record low Voc,def of 0.297 V. These results indicate the photovoltaic property of kesterite, in particular, the Voc strongly correlates with the grain growth mechanism, which provides an excellent platform to identify the origin of the open circuit voltage deficit issue of kesterite solar cells.
In this report, we have systematically investigated and compared the grain growth of Sn2+ and Sn4+ precursor films, the photovoltaic property of the two films at a different stage of the grain growth, the band tailing, the Cu–Zn disorder level, the Urbach energy, and the carrier concentration of the two absorbers. The results show that the Sn2+ film took the liquid-assisted grain growth mechanism with the conversion of sulfides to selenides happening first, followed by fusion of multi selenides into kesterite at different times and rates, whereas the Sn4+ film took a unique transformation mechanism with the sulfide kesterite converted to selenide kesterite along with a top-down and bottom-up bi-directional grain growth. Both absorber films exhibit similar bulk electronic properties with comparable band tailing, disorder level and tail states. The difference in device performance and Voc deficit mainly comes from different surface properties originated from the two grain growth mechanisms.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Composition of Sn2+ and Sn4+ precursor films
The Sn2+ and Sn4+ precursor solutions were, respectively, made by using Tu, CuCl, ZnCl2 and SnCl2·2H2O, and Tu, CuCl, Zn(OAc)2 and SnCl4 as sulfur, copper, zinc and tin precursors.4 The mole ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn were fixed at 0.72 and 1.05 for both solutions for a Cu-poor composition. The precursor films were fabricated by spin-coating the precursor solutions on Mo coated soda lime glass (Mo SLG) substrates and annealed at 340 °C. Films from Sn2+ and Sn4+ solutions are respectively named Sn2+RT and Sn4+RT for the convenience of description in later discussion.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of Sn2+RT and Sn4+RT films. Sn2+RT film is highly crystalline with sharp peaks from CZTS (JCPDS #026-0575) and SnS (JCPDS #039-0354) in both XRD and Raman whereas the Sn4+RT film is amorphous with only broad diffraction peaks from CZTS. Although no Cu2−xS was detected in Sn2+RT, a large amount of Cu2Se was formed at the early stage of the selenization with no obvious change of the CZTS phase, as will be shown in the next section, revealing the existence of Cu2−xS in this film. Raman spectra also show signals from ZnS in both films. The existence of ZnS is inevitable due to the Zn-rich composition. The multi-phase composition of the Sn2+RT film and the single phase (with trace ZnS) of Sn4+RT film come from the different reaction path from solution to the solid film due to the different coordination of the Sn precursor with Tu and DMSO. According to our previous report, the formation of Sn2+RT film involves reactions (1)–(4) whereas Sn4+RT film only involves reactions (5) and (6).4 For clarity, only metal chalcogenide products are listed and all volatile by-products are omitted in the reactions.

2.2 Reaction paths from precursor films to the absorber materials
To investigate the reaction paths and the grain growth mechanisms of the two films, Sn2+RT and Sn4+RT were annealed with Se (so called selenization) in a tube furnace to form kesterite absorbers and the process was stopped at different stages to monitor the progress. Fig. 2 illustrates the temperature profile of the whole process of the selenization, which is divided into three parts. Part I, the temperature of the furnace was heated to 350 °C from room temperature in 1 min and held at this temperature for 5 min; Part II, the temperature was further raised to 540 °C in 2 min; Part III, the temperature was kept at 540 °C for 25 min. The selenization was interrupted at 6, 8, 10.5, 13, 18, 23, 28, and 33 min, which respectively corresponds to selenization at 350 °C for 5 min, at 540 °C for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min. The samples at different stages were characterized by XRD, Raman, and SEM. For simplicity of description, samples at different stages are labelled as Snn+T–t, where n is the valence of Sn, T denotes the selenization temperature and t indicates the holding time at T. It is noted that “t” is different from the total selenization time. For example, Sn2+540-10 stands for a film that was fabricated from Sn2+ precursor solution and underwent selenization at 540 °C for 10 min.
 Fig. 2  The schematic temperature profile of the selenization process. The total time for optimal selenization is 28 min from room temperature, which corresponds to selenization at 540 °C for 20 min. 

Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the Sn2+ and Sn4+ films at different stages of selenization. For the Sn2+ film, dramatic phase changes were observed from Sn2+RT to Sn2+350–5. (1) A strong signal of Cu2Se (JCPDS#029-0575) is detected by XRD at 2-theta of 31.9° and by Raman spectra at a wavenumber of 267 cm−1;33 (2) XRD exhibits similarly strong diffractions of SnS for both films whereas the Raman spectra show the appearance of a SnSe2 (JCPDS#38-1055) peak, indicating that the transformation of SnS to SnSe2 started to happen at the film surface at this point; (3) the intensity of the Raman peak of ZnS significantly decreased in Sn2+350–5, revealing partial conversion of ZnS to ZnSe (ESI,† Fig. S1). In addition, both XRD and Raman spectra show that the intensity of the CZTS signals is almost intact in Sn2+350–5 as compared to Sn2+RT and no peaks for CZTSe are detected, revealing that transformation from CZTS to CZTSSe did not happen in Part I. Thus, the reactions of the Sn2+ film in Part I only involve the conversion of secondary sulfides to selenides. The reactions in Part I can be expressed by eqn (7)–(9). We note that the transition from sulphides to selenides involves sulfoselenide intermediates (ESI,† Fig. S4). The content of sulfur is high at the early stage of the selenization (S/(S + Se) > 29% in both Sn2+350–5 and Sn4+350–5) and quickly reduced to a low level (S/(S + Se) < 10% in Sn2+540-5 and Sn4+540-5). In order to clearly show the reaction paths, S is ignored in the intermediates of the secondary phases.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns (a and b) and Raman spectra (c and d) of Sn2+ (a and c) and Sn4+ (b and d) films at different selenization stages. The enlargement of the (112) diffraction of CZTSSe is also shown in (a) and (b). 
In Part II, with the temperature increased to 540 °C, the XRD patterns (Fig. 3a) show the appearance of two new groups of diffractions. (1) Strong diffraction peaks from SnSe2 along with disappearing of the SnS peaks, revealing complete conversion of SnS to SnSe2, which is also confirmed by Raman data (Fig. 3c); (2) sharp diffraction peaks that can be assigned to CZTSe (JCPDS#010-6295) or Cu2SnSe3 (CTSe) (JCPDS#16-0670). The very strong Raman shifts at 180, 205, and 236 cm−1 (Fig. 3c) confirm that this phase is CTSe.34 In addition, we also observed a decrease of diffraction intensity and blue shift of the Raman peaks of CZTS, indicating that substitution of S by Se started to occur at this point but the majority is still CZTS. We note that Sn2+540-0 is extremely inhomogeneous with large SnSe2 crystals clearly seen under a microscope (ESI,† Fig. S2). The reactions in Part II can be expressed by eqn (9)–(11).
As the selenization further proceeds at 540 °C, from sample Sn2+540-0 to Sn2+540-20, both XRD and Raman show a gradual increase of the CZTSSe signals accompanied by a decrease of the SnSe2, CTSe, and CZTS signals, revealing gradual fusion of the secondary phases to CZTSe and conversion of CZTS to CZTSSe. It is important to note that SnSe2 is still detected in Sn2+540-15 and sometimes even at the end of the selenization (data not shown), indicating that complete fusion of SnSe2 with CTSe or CZTSe is hard to achieve. We believe that this is due to the high crystallinity and large grain size of SnSe, making dissolution of SnSe into liquid Cu2Se dynamically unfavourable. From Fig. 3a, we also see that diffraction peaks from MoSe2 (JCPDS#20-0757) start to appear in Sn2+540-15 and their intensity gradually increases with the progress of selenization. Thus, the reactions in Part III can be expressed by eqn (10)–(14).  
Based on the above data, the reaction path from the Sn2+ precursor film to the final CZTSSe absorber involves: (1) direct conversion of CZTS to CZTSSe, (2) binaries (Cu2Se + SnSe2) to ternary (CTSe) and then to quaternary (CZTSe), and (3) direct conversion of three binaries (Cu2Se + SnSe2 + ZnSe) to quaternary CZTSe. Although we cannot exclude path 3 based on the data discussed above, the chance of this path is low because most Cu2Se and SnSe2 already converted to CTSe in Sn2+540–2.5. The complexity of the reaction paths from the multi phases to the final absorber is very well reflected by the irregular evolution of the kesterite phase as seen from the enlarged (112) diffraction in Fig. 3a.
For Sn4+ film, in Part I, no obvious change of CZTS phase was observed from both XRD and Raman spectra (Fig. 3b and d), revealing that the reaction of CZTS with Se is very limited at this temperature, consistent with the Sn2+ film. We note that the broad Raman peak in the range of 200–250 cm−1 was from Se,34 which was deposited on the film surface during sample cooling. Similar to the Sn2+ film, conversion of ZnS to ZnSe also happened in this part as revealed by Raman spectra (ESI,† Fig. S3). As the temperature increased to 540 °C, most of the CZTS converted to CZTSSe as clearly seen by the strong XRD and Raman peaks of CZTSe and almost complete disappearing of the CZTS peaks (Fig. 3b and d). We note that trace SnSe2 was detected in Sn4+540-0 (Fig. 3b); however, unlike Sn2+ film, for which SnSe2 was detected almost during the whole selenization time (from Sn4+540-0 to Sn4+540-20), SnSe2 was only detected in Sn4+540-0 and disappeared in Sn4+540–2.5. In considering the high sensitivity of SnSe2 to X-ray diffraction (Fig. 3a), the trace SnSe2 is very likely coming from residue Sn impurity on the film surface and its influence on the grain growth is negligible.
From Sn4+540-0 to Sn4+540-25, the (112) diffraction of CZTSSe gradually shifted to a smaller angle and became sharper (Fig. 3b), indicating continuous substitution of S by Se along with grain growth. Different from the Sn2+ film, in which the formation of CZTSSe includes the fusion of multi secondary phases and conversion of CZTS to CZTSSe, the Sn4+ film only involves the transformation of CZTS to CZTSSe, which is well reflected by the uniform shift of the (112) diffraction as shown in Fig. 3b. The direct phase transformation grain growth mechanism of this film can be understood by a more favorable substitution reaction than the decomposition reaction because there is no need to break the crystal structure.
We note that the diffraction peaks of MoSe2 were already detectable in Sn4+540-5, at a much earlier stage as compared to Sn2+ film (which was detected in Sn2+540-15) and their intensity became much stronger with the increase of selenization time, suggesting that the formation of MoSe2 is much easier in Sn4+ film than Sn2+ film. The reactions of Sn4+ film during the selenization are listed below.  
2.3 Grain growth of Sn2+ and Sn4+ films
To understand the morphology change of Sn2+ and Sn4+ films at different stages of the selenization, SEM was carried out in parallel to the XRD and Raman and the images are shown in Fig. 4. Top-view image of Sn2+RT shows a large amount of crystalline SnS with orthorhombic structure and the cross-sectional image exhibits high crystalline SnS and CZTS phases, which are highlighted by colour. No Cu2S crystals are seen from the image, indicating that this phase is amorphous. The morphology of Sn2+RT agrees well with both XRD and Raman results discussed earlier. From Sn2+RT to Sn2+350–5, film morphology changed dramatically. The film surface becomes very rough with a large number of Cu2(S,Se) crystals protruding out of the film surface. Identification of film components was performed by a combination of SEM and EDX and the results are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The low melting point phase of Cu2(S,Se) is generally formed at low temperature and dissolves other elements and facilitates grain growth.31 When the selenization temperature reached 540 °C, Cu2(S,Se) crystals disappeared and a large number of SnSe2 crystals (identified as elliptical crystal, Fig. S4, ESI†) emerge on the film surface. As discussed earlier, Cu2SnSe3 starts to form at this point. As selenization further proceeds, small CZTSSe grains of hundreds of nanometers are formed in Sn2+540-5 and the grain sizes gradually increase with the selenization time and large grains in a few micrometers are formed in Sn2+540-15. The cross-section images show that the CZTSSe grains are loosely connected in Sn2+540-5 and Sn2+540-10 and become well-packed in Sn2+540-15. However, SnSe2 crystals are seen on the film surface until Sn2+540-15, although their number and size decreased with time (Fig. 4a and c). From Sn2+540-15 to Sn2+540-20, the SnSe2 impurity disappeared and the grain size further increased (Fig. 4a). Further increasing the selenization time, the vapour pressure of Se becomes low due to the escape of Se from the semi-closed graphite box and CZTSSe starts to decompose,35 resulting in pin holes and ZnSe impurity in Sn2+540-25 (Fig. 4a and c).
 Fig. 4  The plane view (a and b) and cross-sectional (c and d) SEM images of Sn2+ (a and c) and Sn4+ (b and d) films at different stages of the selenization. 
The development of film morphology clearly demonstrates the complicated grain growth mechanism of Sn2+ film, which involves the transformation of sulfides to selenides at an early stage of the selenization, fusion of secondary phases to kesterite, and converge of small grains to large grains. The multi reaction paths and slow fusion of secondary phases inevitably results in compositional non-uniformity during grain growth as evidenced by the irregular XRD peaks (Fig. 3a) and the large difference of morphologies at different stages of the selenization. It is important to note that the secondary phase of SnSe2 mostly locates on the film surface. According to Chen et al., Sn rich composition leads to the formation of deep donor defect SnZn and defect clusters of CuZn + SnZn and 2CuZn + SnZn, which can cause serious recombination.13,16 For this grain growth path, the chemical potential of Sn4+ can be very high near the SnSe2 crystal which can increase the formation of the detrimental defects of SnZn and defect clusters of CuZn + SnZn and 2CuZn + SnZn and thus cause serious recombination near the surface. We note that complicated phase evolution is the most commonly observed phenomenon in CZTS materials, especially for vacuum based approaches when the precursors used to fabricate kesterites are metal or metal chalcogenides.5,30,36 For the solution approach, the multiphase fusion grain growth was also observed by Huang et al. with the precursor film fabricated from almost identical DMSO solution using SnCl2, CuCl, ZnCl2 and thiourea as precursors.37 For many other DMSO solutions, Cu2+ and Sn2+ are the commonly used Cu and Sn precursors,38,39 in which the redox reaction (2Cu2+ + Sn2+ = 2Cu+ + Sn4+)18 will greatly reduce the concentration of Sn2+ and thus a high crystalline SnS and similar grain growth may not be observed.
Very different from Sn2+RT, Sn4+RT film has a uniform composition and a very smooth surface. Small holes and cracks seen on the film surface can facilitate Se penetrating into the film. No significant morphology change was observed from Sn4+RT to Sn4+350–5. Although ZnSe was detected by Raman (Fig. S3, ESI†) in Sn4+350–5, no obvious ZnSe aggregates are seen on the film surface, indicating its amorphous nature. As the selenization temperature increases to 540 °C, well packed grains from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers can be clearly seen on the film surface. The cross-section image shows that a dense and uniform large grain layer also formed at the film bottom, resulting in a tri-layer structure with a middle small grain layer sandwiched by top and bottom large grain layers. The formation of the bottom layer can be understood by a large amount of Se penetrated into the film bottom in Part I (Fig. 4d), which facilitates fast selenization and grain growth. As selenization further proceeds, the top and bottom layers keep growing vertically until the middle small grain layer was completely consumed in Sn4+540-20, resulting in a large grain bilayer structure with some impurities in between. During the whole process, the bottom layer grows slower than the top layer, which can be attributed to the increased thickness of the dense top layer, which hinders the penetration of Se to the film bottom. XRD shows that the substitution of S by Se mainly happens at the beginning of the selenization (Sn4+540-0) but the substitution continues with the increase of selenization time as indicated by the blue-shift of the (112) diffraction peak (Fig. 3b). The bi-direction grain growth mechanism can potentially lead to the vertically un-uniform distribution of S and Se and thus bandgap fluctuation. Furthermore, with increase in selenization time, the film begins to decompose and voids and holes are formed on the surface of Sn4+540-25, similar to that of Sn2+540-25. Unlike Sn2+ film, the surface of Sn4+ is very clean and uniform during the selenization until it starts to decompose.

Fig. 4 also shows that a very thin layer of MoSe2 starts to appear in Sn2+540-5 but its thickness does not increase much until Sn2+540-15. After Sn2+540-15, the thickness of MoSe2 increases very fast, and more than doubled from Sn2+540-15 to Sn2+540-20 and Sn2+540-20 to Sn2+540-25. For the Sn4+ film, the MoSe2 layer starts to appear in Sn4+540-0 and its thickness increases faster as compared to Sn2+ films. It has been reported that the formation of MoSe2 is due to the redox reaction between CZTSSe and Mo (eqn (15)).40,41 Our results support this claim because the interface between the film and Mo truly becomes a CZTSSe/Mo interface until Sn2+540-15 for Sn2+ film but as early as Sn4+540-0 for Sn4+ film. A thin MoSe2 layer formed during selenization is believed to improve the ohmic contact at a reasonable thickness but may increase resistance if too thick.40 2Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 + Mo → 2Cu2S(e) + 2ZnS(e) + 2SnS(e) + MoS(e)2(15)
2.4 Photovoltaic property at different stages of the selenization
Solar cells using Sn2(4)+540-5, Sn2(4)+540-10, Sn2(4)+540-15, Sn2(4)+540-20 and Sn2(4)+540-25 as absorbers were fabricated under standard device fabrication conditions.4 The statistical photovoltaic parameters of the two series of devices are shown in Fig. 5. The average device parameters of the solar cells under each condition are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).

The average Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE are 31.69 mA cm−2, 0.399 V, 44.7%, and 5.69% for Sn2+540-20 and 33.5 mA cm−2, 0.435 V, 63.5%, and 9.27% for Sn4+540-20. The Jsc values of both devices are comparable, but the Voc and FF of the Sn4+540-20 device are respectively 36 mV and 18.8% higher than for the Sn2+540-20 device. Sn4+540-20 devices also exhibit much better reproducibility with an extremely small scattering in all device parameters. At a longer selenization time, device performance declines for both films. The striving difference between the two sets of films comes from devices with shorter selenization time. For Sn2+ film, decent devices are obtained with selenization time as short as 5 min at 540 °C and all device parameters gradually increase with the increase of selenization time until 20 min. For Sn4+ films, however, devices do not function well at short selenization time with an average PCE of only 0.05% for Sn4+540-15. The main limiting factor of Sn4+540-15 is the extremely low Jsc.
The difference in device performance at short selenization time can be understood by the grain growth mechanism discussed earlier. For Sn2+ films, the liquid assisted grain growth mechanism resulted in vertically connected crystalline CZTSSe grains at an early stage of selenization (Sn2+540-5, Fig. 4c) which form percolation for charge carrier transfer and help the device to function. At the same time, secondary phases, small grains, and low uniformity limit device efficiency. Increasing selenization time reduces secondary phases and improves film quality and thus device performance. For Sn4+ films, the top-down and bottom-up bi-directional grain growth mechanism results in a tri-layer structure and the vertical paths do not form at an early stage (Fig. 4d); in other words, the low crystallinity of the small grain middle layer creates high resistance and the impurities within the middle layer can serve as recombination centers and deteriorate device performance. At the optimal selenization time, the multi-phase fusion grain growth mechanism of the Sn2+ film facilitates defect formation whereas the uniform grain growth of Sn4+ film produces less defective high quality absorber materials. Further extending the selenization time leads to the decomposition of both films and thus decreases device performance.
From the grain growth mechanism and the device performance discussed above, there is still large room for further improvement of Sn4+ absorber quality. Top-down and bottom-up grain growth are inevitable leaving impurities in between the top and bottom layers; in fact, sometimes the middle small grain layer cannot be completely eliminated,4 which will act as recombination centers. The imperfect contact between the top and bottom layers will add resistance to the circuit and lower device performance. In addition, the very thick MoSe2 layer increases series resistance and the back contact barrier. Inserting an inert layer, such as TiN, MoO2 and MoO342 between Mo and CZTS to prevent direct contact of CZTSSe and Mo has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to reduce the thickness of MoSe2, which is expected to eliminate the double-layer structure, reduce MoSe2 thickness and thus further improve Sn4+ solar cell efficiency.
2.5 Characteristics of Sn2+ and Sn4+ devices with and without thermal annealing
Our previous results show that thermal annealing of CZTSSe/CdS improves the order level of both Sn2+ and Sn4+ absorbers but has a different effect on device Voc.4 In this part, solar cells of Sn2+540-20 and Sn4+540-20 films with and without thermal annealing are fabricated in parallel. The band gap fluctuation, electrostatic potential fluctuation, Urbach energy, and carrier concentration of the two sets of absorbers are investigated and their effect on device Voc are compared. For simplicity, the subscripts of 540–20 are omitted hereafter.

Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves and EQE spectra of the representative Sn2+ and Sn4+ devices with and without thermal annealing. The Jsc values of all curves are adjusted to the integrated current density from the EQE. The band gaps of the CZTSSe absorbers are extracted from the EQE (ESI,† Fig. S5). The ideality factor (n), the reverse saturation current density (J0), and the serial (Rs) and shunt (Rsh) resistance are calculated from the J–V data in Fig. 6 according to the method reported in the literature.43 The device parameters, the diode properties of the two pairs of solar cells, and the band gaps of the absorbers are summarized in Table 1. The band gaps of Sn2+ and Sn4+ absorbers are both 1.063 eV before thermal annealing, which respectively increased to 1.080 and 1.087 eV after thermal annealing due to the improvement of the Cu–Zn order level.44 The same annealing treatment but slightly different enhancement in Eg (24 meV for Sn4+ and 17 meV for Sn2+ absorbers) indicates that the Cu–Zn order level of the high-quality absorber is easier to improve. The device Voc increased after thermal annealing for both absorbers. For the Sn2+ device, the increment of the Voc (20 mV) agrees well with the increase of Eg (17 meV); however, for the Sn4+ device, the improvement (65 mV) is much larger than the increase of Eg (24 meV). Although the exact mechanism of the large enhancement of the Voc of the Sn4+ device is not clear at this point and certainly needs further investigation, it has to come from the different absorber property, especially the surface property due to different grain growth mechanisms as discussed earlier.

From Table 1, the n and J0 of Sn2+ devices are respectively 3.1 and 1.32 × 10−4 A cm−2. The high n (>2) and J0 reveal serious Shockley–Read–Hall recombination (depletion region) of this device, which has to come from the high concentration of defects on/near the absorber surface. After thermal annealing, the n and J0 respectively increased to 3.93 and 8.23 × 10−4 A cm−2. With the improvement in Cu–Zn order level and increase of Eg, which mainly reflect the bulk property of the absorber and should reduce the recombination in the bulk, the increase of n and J0 reveals that the recombination near the junction was not getting better but even getting worse after thermal annealing. For Sn4+ devices without thermal annealing, the n and J0 are only 1.73 and 1.56 × 10−6 A cm−2. The small n (<2) and J0 (two orders of magnitude lower than Sn2+ device) reveal much lower recombination in the Sn4+ device than the Sn2+ device in both the depletion range and absorber bulk. After thermal annealing, on the contrary to the Sn2+ device, the n and J0 further decreased to 1.41 and 2.53 × 10−8 A cm−2, indicating greatly reduced recombination near the junction and in the absorber bulk.
The band gap (σg) and electrostatic potential (γopt) fluctuations of the two absorbers are extracted from the EQE data by replotting the EQE at a long wavelength range as a function of energy according to the literature.45 The σg values of the two absorbers without thermal annealing are comparable, 56.6 meV for Sn2+ and 54.4 meV for Sn4+. The slightly higher band gap fluctuation of Sn2+ than Sn4+ is in agreement with its relatively low uniformity due to the multi-phase fusion grain growth mechanism. With thermal annealing, the σg values of the Sn2+ and Sn4+ absorbers are respectively reduced to 51.2 and 48.3 meV. Surprisingly, the γopt values of the two absorbers are very close to each other, 25.7 meV for Sn2+ and 25.9 meV for Sn4+ absorbers and respectively decreased to 23.3 meV and 23.9 meV with thermal annealing. The reduction of σg and γopt upon thermal annealing is comparable for Sn2+ (5.4 and 2.4 meV) and Sn4+ (6.3 and 2.0 meV) absorbers, revealing that they are from the same source, that is, the improvement of the Cu–Zn order level. The similar decrease in σg and γopt but dramatic difference in device Voc indicates that both σg and γopt are not directly related to the Voc,def of kesterite solar cells.
The tail states of the four absorbers are evaluated by the Urbach energy (EU) calculated from the EQE data measured by Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) (Fig. 6e). The EU is 22.0 meV and slightly reduced to 21.5 meV after thermal annealing for the Sn2+ absorber and 21.5 meV but slightly increased to 23.0 meV after thermal annealing for the Sn4+ absorber. With the decrease of both σg and γopt upon thermal annealing, the reason for the increase in the EU of the Sn4+ absorber is not clear and needs further investigation, however, it does indicate that the tail state is not directly related to the Voc,def of kesterite solar cells.
To further understand the defect property of the two absorbers, the capacitance–voltage (C–V) profile and drive level capacitance profiling (DLCP) were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 6f and Table S2 (ESI†). It can be clearly seen that the carrier density (both NCV and NDL) of the Sn4+ device is much lower than the Sn2+ device and exhibits a much wider depletion width (Xd). The free carriers in CZTSSe are usually provided by shallow defects (VCu, CuZn), which mainly depend on the stoichiometry of the absorber. Since both Sn2+ and Sn4+ absorbers have similar chemical compositions (Cu/(Zn + Sn) ≈ 0.75, Zn/Sn ≈ 1.1), they should have similar free carrier concentrations, therefore, the higher carrier concentration (NDL) of the Sn2+ film should come from the contribution of deep-level defects, such as SnZn and CuZn + SnZn. In general, DLCP is more accurate to assess the bulk carrier density of the absorber (NDL) while C–V (NCV) is also sensitive to the interface traps. Thence, the contribution of the interfacial defects (NIT) can be assessed by subtracting NDL from NCV, which is 2.76 × 1015 for the Sn2+ device and only 1.17 × 1015 for the Sn4+ device, confirming the much less defective surface of the Sn4+ absorber.
From the above results we can conclude that the Cu–Zn disorder level, the band and potential fluctuations, and band tailing are not the crucial reasons that limit the kesterite solar cell Voc; instead, the deep defect induced interface recombination is the key reason. The formation of the deep defects is directly related to the multiphase fusion grain growth mechanism which involves the SnSe2 secondary phase on the film surface and thus facilitates the formation of Sn-related deep defects such as SnZn and CuZn + SnZn (Sn2+ film). The direct phase transformation grain growth mechanism does not involve SnSe2 secondary phase (Sn4+ film) and thus can prevent the formation of serious deep defects on the film surface. To obtain a high quality kesterite absorber, engineering the reaction path and grain growth to avoid the appearance of SnSe2 on the film surface, in particular, near the end of the selenization, is critical to reducing surface deep defects and thus serious recombination near the junction. Among the CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from Sn4+ solution, a large number of devices achieved active area efficiency close to or above 13%. The J–V and EQE curves of two such devices are shown in Fig. 7 and their photovoltaic parameters and device characteristics are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). Device 1 has an active area efficiency of 12.8% (total area efficiency 12.1% without AR coating) with a high FF of 72.3% (FF/FFSQ = 84.1%) and device 2 exhibits an active area efficiency of 13.0% (total area efficiency 12.4% without AR coating) with a high Jsc of 38.3 mA cm−2 (Jsc/JSQsc = 82.1%). The n and J0 of device 1 are only 1.38 and 2.16 × 10−8 A cm−2.

Table 2 summarises device parameters of high performing kesterite solar cells in the literature including those employing doping and alloying strategies as well as a CIGS device for comparison. It can be clearly seen that all devices with Voc/VSQoc above 62% are achieved from either DMSO or DMF precursor solutions by using Sn4+ as the tin precursor. Our recent investigation shows that the reaction path from DMF solution to the CZTSSe absorber is very similar to DMSO solution, that is, an amorphous kesterite CZTS film was formed upon thermal annealing, which directly transformed to CZTSSe without forming secondary phases (this work will be published somewhere else), demonstrating the advantage of the direct phase transformation grain growth mechanism in achieving high quality kesterite absorber materials. If we consider the already achieved Shockley–Queisser limit (Jsc/JSQsc = 82.1%, Voc/VSQoc = 63.7%, and FF/FFSQ = 84.1%) of the CZTSSe solar cells fabricated from Sn4+ DMSO solution, for a CZTSSe absorber with an Eg of 1.13 eV (the bandgap of the two record devices), the achievable efficiency is 14.8%, a very encouraging value for kesterite solar cells.

3. Conclusions
The reaction path and grain growth of two types of precursor films fabricated from DMSO solutions respectively using Sn2+ and Sn4+ as tin precursors were systematically investigated and the photovoltaic property of the absorbers at different stages of the selenization and the effect of thermal annealing on the absorber and device properties were compared. XRD, Raman and SEM characterizations show that the secondary sulfide composed Sn2+ precursor film took a multi-step secondary phase fusion reaction path with the final reaction occurring on the film surface with the long existence of SnSe2, resulting in a very defective surface and low device efficiency and Voc. On the contrary, uniform kesterite structured Sn4+ precursor film took a direct transformation reaction with a top down and bottom up bi-direction grain growth which formed a uniform and less defective surface and thus high efficiency and Voc. Device characterization shows that both absorber films exhibit similar bulk electronic properties with comparable band (σg) and potential (γopt) fluctuations and tail states (EU), and the low Voc of the Sn2+ mainly comes from interface recombination as revealed by very large ideality factor (n > 3), high reverse saturation current density (>10−4 A cm−2), and high defect concentration. Furthermore, the Cu–Zn order levels of both absorbers are similarly improved upon low temperature thermal annealing of absorber/CdS as revealed by similar enhancement in band gap and reduction in σg and γopt, and the much higher improvement in the Voc of the Sn4+ than Sn2+ device further confirms that the interface recombination (not Cu–Zn disorder) is the limiting factor of kesterite solar cell Voc. Our results reveal that the Voc deficit of kesterite solar cells mainly comes from the deep defects on/near the absorber surface which originated from SnSe2 involving multi-phase grain growth. Direct phase transformation grain growth can avoid the secondary phases and thus greatly reduce detrimental defects, which is a new strategy for the fabrication of high quality kesterite and other multi-element thin film semiconducting materials. The Sn4+ absorbers fabricated by this approach have achieved high Shockley–Queisser limits with Jsc/JSQsc of 82.1%, Voc/VSQoc of 63.7%, and FF/FFSQ of 84.1%; based on these values, an efficiency of 14.8% is achievable for a CZTSSe absorber with a band gap of 1.13 eV (the bandgap of the two record devices), which is very encouraging for kesterite solar cells.

Broader context
With the fast growth of economics and decline of available fossil fuels, the worldwide demand for renewable energy has never been so strong. Photovoltaics is one of the most important areas of renewable energy. Compared to Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and CdTe thin film solar cells, the kesterite (Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4) solar cell uses earth abundant and less toxic elements and thus has great potential for low cost and large area production. However, the efficiency of the kesterite solar cell (12.6%) is much lower than similar structured Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (23.35%). The main issue of kesterite solar cells is the low open-circuit voltage (Voc) and improving Voc is a must for practical application. Many reasons including Cu–Zn disorder, secondary phases, band gap and potential fluctuations, and deep defects have been attributed to the large Voc deficit of kesterite; however, which of them is the critical limiting factor and how it is formed are yet to be identified. In this report, we have used two Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 absorbers that are similarly fabricated from DMSO solution using either Sn2+ or Sn4+ as a tin precursor but exhibiting very different device Voc as a platform to investigate the origin of the Voc deficit of kesterite solar cells. Our results show that the large Voc deficit of the Sn2+ solution processed device comes from the defective absorber surface that originated from the multi-step secondary phase fusion grain growth mechanism. On the contrary, direct phase transformation grain growth of the Sn4+ solution based absorber achieved a record low Voc deficit kesterite solar cell with an efficiency of 12.4%. Our results not only identified the origin of the large Voc deficit of kesterite but also demonstrate that the direct phase conversion grain growth mechanism is a new and effective strategy to further improve the kesterite solar cell efficiency.
