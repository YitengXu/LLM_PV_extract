E-mail: kedar@barc.gov.in; jainvk@barc.gov.inbMaterials Science Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, 400 085, IndiaReceived 6th April 2010, Accepted 10th June 2010First published on 12th August 2010AbstractReactions of SbCl3 and BiCl3 with M′Se–C5H3(R-3)N (M′ = Li or Na; R = H or Me) gave homoleptic selenolate complexes of the general formula [M{Se–C5H3(R-3)N}3] (M = Sb or Bi). The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, UV-vis and NMR (1H, 13C and 77Se) spectroscopy. The single crystal X-ray analysis of [M{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3]·nH2O (M/n = Sb/1.5 and Bi/0.5) revealed that the antimony complex adopts a trigonal pyramidal configuration with monodentate selenolate ligands while the bismuth analogue acquires a distorted square pyramidal configuration defined by two chelating and one monodentate selenolate groups. Pyrolysis of [M{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] either in a furnace or in hexadecylamine (HDA) at different temperatures gave a variety of M2Se3 nanostructures. Thin films of metal selenides have also been deposited on glass substrate by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD). Both nanostructures and thin films of metal selenides were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).IntroductionThe V–VI binary compound materials are direct bandgap semiconductors and have a highly anisotropic layered structure. These materials have attracted considerable interest because they possess desired thermo-electric and photovoltaic properties1 which find applications in a range of thermo-electric and optoelectronic devices,2 optical recording systems, television cameras3 and solar cells.4 Polymer coated Bi2S3 nanoparticles have been used as an imaging agent in X-ray computed tomography.5 To improve efficiency of thermoelectric devices, there has been persistent efforts to develop materials with improved figure of merit (ZT), although Bi2Te3 (ZT = 1) based materials still dominate for low temperature applications.6 Enhancement in ZT values has been reported in thermoelectric nanostructures (such as nanorods, nanowires, nanoribbons, etc.) because of reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity as compared to their bulk counterpart.7Among V–VI materials, metal sulfides8–13 have been studied in considerable detail whereas work on metal selenides (Eg = 1.3 (Sb2Se3); 0.3 (Bi2Se3) eV) is gaining momentum owing to their remarkable optical and thermoelectric properties.14 Traditionally the selenides are prepared by heating elements (Sb/Bi and Se) at elevated temperatures.15,16 Of late, other techniques, like solvothermal, hydrothermal, microwave assisted synthesis and chemical bath deposition, etc., have been employed to prepare metal selenide nanostructures and for deposition of thin films.17 A few single source precursors have also been developed for the preparation of M2Se3 (M = Sb or Bi).18,19 Liu and coworkers employed [Sb{Se2P(OiPr)2}3],18 while O'Brien's group employed diselenocarbamate and imino-bis(diisopropylphosphinoselenide) complexes of antimony and bismuth for metal selenide nanomaterials and thin films.2-Pyridylselenolate ligands (I) represent an interesting family of hemilabile ligands. Coordination chemistry of these ligands has been investigated by us20,21 and others.22–24 These ligands show a remarkably different coordination pattern from their sulfur analogues.25 Thus it was of interest to examine the chemistry of these ligands with antimony and bismuth with the aim of developing single source precursors for metal selenide nanostructures and thin films. The results of this work are described herein.  ExperimentalMaterials and methodsMetal chlorides, hexadecylamine (HDA), and other solvents were obtained from commercial sources. Bis(2-pyridyl)diselenide and bis(3-methyl-2-pyridyl)diselenide were prepared according to the literature method.26Elemental analyses were carried out on a Thermoscientific Flash EA1112 elemental analyzer. 1H, 13C{1H} and 77Se{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-II-300 NMR spectrometer operating at 300, 75.47 and 57.24 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are relative to the internal chloroform peak for 1H and 13C{1H} spectra and external Ph2Se2 (δ 463 ppm relative to Me2Se) in CDCl3 for 77Se{1H} spectra. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Chemito Spectroscan UV 2600 double beam UV-vis spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out on a Nitzsch STA 409 PC-Luxx TG-DTA instrument, which was calibrated with CaC2O4·H2O. The TG curves were recorded at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of nitrogen. X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Philips PW-1820 powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were carried out on MIRERO Inc. AIS2100 and Oxford INCA E350 instruments, respectively. A JEOL-2000FX and Tecnai G2 T20 transmission electron microscope operating at accelerating voltages up to 200 kV was used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The samples for TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were prepared by placing a drop of sample dispersed in acetone and toluene on a carbon coated copper grid.Intensity data for [M{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3]·nH2O (M = Sb or Bi) were measured at room temperature (298(2) K) on a Rigaku AFC7S diffractometer fitted with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71069 Å) so that θmax = 27.5°. The structures were solved by direct methods27 and refinement27 was on F2 using data that had been corrected for absorption effects with an empirical procedure,28 with non-hydrogen atoms modeled with anisotropic displacement parameters, with hydrogen atoms in their calculated positions. Molecular structures were drawn using ORTEP.29 Crystallographic and structural determination data are listed in Table 1.

The temperature dropped to 150 °C and was raised to and maintained at 200 °C for 25 min. The hot solution was cooled down rapidly to 70 °C and methanol (20 cm3) was added so as to get a grayish-black precipitate which was washed thoroughly with methanol, followed by centrifuging and drying under vacuum. Similarly, Bi2Se3 nanoparticles were prepared in HDA at 235 °C.Preparation of thin films by AACVDIn a typical experiment metal chalcogenolate precursor (2 or 4, ∼75 mg) was dissolved in 25 cm3 of toluene. Aerosol droplets of the solution were generated by an ultrasonic humidifier and were transported using argon as a carrier gas (flow rate of 200 sccm) to a hot glass substrate placed in a turbo furnace.Results and discussionSynthesis and spectroscopyReactions of MCl3 with M′{Se–C5H3(R-3)N} (M = Sb or Bi; R = H or Me; M′ = Li or Na) in a benzene–methanol mixture gave homoleptic selenolates, [M{Se–C5H3(R-3)N}3] (1–4), as yellow crystalline solids in 52%–87% yield (eqn (1)). (1)The electronic spectra of these complexes exhibited three bands in the region 250–409 nm which are red shifted with respect to the absorptions for the corresponding dipyridyldiselenides. These bands can be assigned to ligand-to-ligand charge transfer transitions.The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra displayed expected resonances and peak multiplicities. The ring proton resonances appeared at lower field for all the complexes from the corresponding signals for the diselenide. The 77Se{1H} NMR spectra exhibited a single resonance in the region 256–309 ppm, the resonances for bismuth complexes being more deshielded (∼34 ppm). The appearance of only one 77Se NMR resonance for bismuth complexes, which contain two chelating and one monodentate selenolate ligand in the solid state (see later), suggests that in solution either all the ligands are monodentate or there is a dynamic ligand scrambling (chelating ⇌ monodentate).X-Ray crystallographyThe molecular structures of [M{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3]·nH2O (M = Sb (2)·1.5H2O and Bi (4)·0.5H2O) have been established by single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses (Fig. 1 and 2). Selected interatomic parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Although both the complexes are discrete monomers, they differ in the coordination geometry around the central metal atom. The C–Se and various C–C and C–N distances of the pyridylselenolate ligands are as expected.21,26

The ellipsoids were drawn at the 50% probability. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. The distances between Sb/Bi and N are less than the sum of their van der Waals radii (3.55 Å) while they are greater than the sum of their covalent radii, hence may be considered as weak interactions between Sb/Bi and N.The antimony atom in 2 is bonded to three selenolates of monodentate Se–C5H3(Me-3)N ligands and acquires a trigonal pyramidal configuration with Se–Sb–Se angles lying between 82.73(3°) and 92.81(4°). There is a large void in the coordination sphere of antimony, which appears to be filled by a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. The Sb–Se distances (2.5843(13)–2.6643(12) Å) are well within the range reported in the literature.18,30 The structure of 2 differs markedly from thiolate derivatives, [Sb(S–C5H4N)3]31 and [Sb{S–C9H5(4-Ph)N}3],32 which have chelating thiolate (S∩N) ligands. The Sb–N distances in the former (four-membered chelate) are longer (2.830(7) Å) than that found in the latter (av. 2.63 Å) (five-membered chelate), whereas Sb–N distances in 2 are av. 2.76 Å. Besides chelation, the complex [Sb(S–C5H4N)3] has weak intermolecular interaction. The electron pairs of two molecules face each other with an Sb⋯Sb distance of 3.657(1) Å, which is less than the sum of van der Waals radii of antimony atoms.31In contrast to the structure of [Sb{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3]·1.5H2O (2·1.5H2O), the bismuth analog, [Bi{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3]·0.5H2O (4·0.5H2O), adopts a distorted square pyramidal configuration defined by two chelating and a monodentate selenolate ligands. The latter occupies the apical position while the donor atoms (Se and N) of the two chelating selenolates are at the corners of the square. There is a void opposite to the monodentate selenolate group, which seems to be filled by a stereochemically active lone pair of electrons. The Bi–Se distance for the monodentate selenolate ligand is shorter than those with chelating ligands. However, these distances are within the range reported in other complexes.19a,33 One of the Bi–N distances is shorter (∼0.1 Å) than the other of the chelating ligands, and the two distances are within the range reported for [Bi(SCH2CH2NR2)3−nCln] (R = H or Me; n = 0, 1 for H and n = 1, 2 for Me) (2.398(8)–2.83(2) Å).34 The molecular structure described here also differs from the structure of tris{2-(4,4-dimethyloxazolino)phenylselenolato}bismuth(III) which has a distorted octahedral configuration with Bi⋯N distances varying between 2.827(7) and 2.952(6) Å.35 It is interesting to note that in spite of significant difference in the ionic radii of nitrogen and selenium, the Bi–N and Bi–Se distances are similar. This can be ascribed to hemidirecting effect of a stereochemically active electron pair on bismuth and has been described earlier in lead and bismuth complexes.36,37The examination of packing diagram reveals the existence of weak interactions between Sb/Bi and Se atom of neighboring molecule (Sb1–Se2 = 3.665 Å; Bi1–Se3 = 3.523 Å). These interactions are larger than the sum of their covalent radii (Sb–Se = 2.61 Å; Bi–Se = 2.60 Å) and lesser than the sum of their van der Waal radii (Sb–Se = 3.90 Å; Bi–Se = 3.90 Å).The water molecules in both 2 and 4 are highly disordered and hydrogen atoms associated with them could not be located. It is observed that there are short interactions (2.52 Å) between O1 and O2 in 2.Thermal studiesTG analyses of two representative complexes (2 and 4) were carried out under a flowing argon atmosphere. The complexes underwent three step decomposition (Fig. 3). The first step is related to the removal of one molecule of water at 120 °C (found weight loss: 3.3% (2) and 1.8% (4), calcd. weight loss for one H2O: 2.8% (2) and 2.4% (4)). The second step in the case of 2 may be assigned to the loss of all organic fragments and one selenium atom (found weight loss: 53.1%, calcd. weight loss for 3C5H3(Me)N + Se: 55.9%) and in the final step, Sb2Se3 is formed after removal of selenium from the SbSe2 (found weight loss 4.6%, calcd. weight loss 7.0%). This suggests that Sb2Se3 is formed via a metastable product, SbSe2. The formation of Sb2Se3 from [Sb{Se2P(OiPr)2}3] has been reported to involve an intermediate species SbSe3.18 The second step of decomposition at 260 °C of complex 4 corresponds to the formation of Bi2Se3 (weight loss found 52.8%, calcd. weight loss for the formation of Bi2Se3: 54.6%). Further heating (320 °C) leads to elimination of selenium with the formation of BiSe (third step weight loss found 9.0%, calcd. for the formation of BiSe 12.0%).

Metal selenide nanocrystalsPyrolysis of [M{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] (M = Sb or Bi) in a furnace under an argon atmosphere at 400 and 450 °C for 1 h afforded a black residue which were characterized as orthorhombic Sb2Se3 (JCPDS File No.s 15-0861) and hexagonal phase of BiSe (JCPDS File No.s 29-0246) from XRD pattern and EDX analysis [Sb:Se atom ratio is 33.6:45.1 (Se/Sb = 1.34) and Bi:Se atom ratio is 25.1:21.0 (Se/Bi = 1.1), which are close to Se/Sb = 1.5 and Se/Bi = 1 corresponds to Sb2Se3 and BiSe] (supplementary information†). The average diameter of these particles estimated by Scherrer formula is 60 nm. SEM images of Sb2Se3 residue showed that the formation of monodispersed nano-rods with a width of 250 nm and length of few microns (Fig. 4) whereas BiSe residue displayed uniformly distributed flower like structures which might have formed due to self-assembly of petal like structures (Fig. 5). Fig. 4  a) SEM images of Sb2Se3 nanorods obtained by pyrolysis of [Sb{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] (2) in a furnace at 400 °C for 1 h.  Fig. 5  a), b), c) and d) SEM images of different magnifications of BiSe flowers obtained by pyrolysis of [Bi{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] (4) at 450 °C for 1 h, respectively. The thermolysis of 2 and 4 in HDA at 200 and 230 °C, respectively, yield a black flocculate characterized as M2Se3 (M = Sb or Bi) nanocrystals. XRD patterns of the black precipitate displayed slightly broad peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase of Sb2Se3 (JCPDS File No. 15-0861) (Fig. 6a) and rhombohedral Bi2Se3 (Fig. 6b). The average size of these nanoparticles is 47 and 13 nm, respectively, as estimated by the Scherrer formula.38,39 TEM image of Sb2Se3 revealed the presence of nano-rods of 40–60 nm width (diameter) and 0.6–1.4 μ in length (Fig. 7a). The particle size estimated from XRD pattern is close to the width of the rod determined by TEM, suggesting that it is the width of the rods that reflects in the FWHM of the XRD peak. A bright dot like pattern in the SAED pattern showed that they are single crystalline in nature. The SAED pattern of these rods (Fig. 7c) displayed (020), (220), (221) and (240) lattice planes of orthorhombic Sb2Se3, respectively, and is consistent with the phase determined by the XRD pattern.

TEM image (Fig. 7b) of Bi2Se3 showed flake like structures with width 30 nm and length ∼760 nm. The difference in the sizes estimated by TEM and the Scherrer formula is because particle size does not determine the line width directly in XRD.40 The discrete spots in the SAED pattern showed that they are single crystalline in nature. The SAED pattern (Fig. 7d) displayed (101), (0012) and (1013) lattice planes of rhombohedral Bi2Se3 and are consistent with the phase determined by the XRD pattern.The absorption spectra of HDA capped nanoparticles of Sb2Se3 and Bi2Se3 (supplementary information†) displayed a broad peak at 776 (λonset = 1094 nm) and 636 (λonset = 1100 nm) nm, respectively. From the λonset of these materials, band gaps can be estimated as 1.13 eV using the equation reported in literature.41 These band gap values are comparable to earlier reports.41,42 Since the Bohr radius of Sb2Se3 is small, quantum confinement is not observed in these rods with dimensions of 40–60 nm. However, the absorption maximum of HDA capped Bi2Se3 flakes is blue shifted with respect to the bulk Bi2Se3 (λmax = 4133 nm or Eg = 0.3 eV). This shift may be attributed to quantum confinement of nanostructure.Metal selenide thin films by AACVDBlack antimony selenide films were deposited on a glass substrate using [Sb{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] (2) at substrate temperatures ranging between 375 and 500 °C for different durations. Details of different experimental conditions employed for deposition of Sb2Se3 thin films are summarized in Table S1 (supplementary information†). XRD pattern and EDX measurements (Sb/Se atomic ratio is 16.6:27.0, which is close to 2:3) (supplementary information†) of these films revealed the deposition of the orthorhombic phase of Sb2Se3 (JCPDS File No. 15-0861). The films grew preferentially in (221) direction.SEM images of the Sb2Se3 films grown on the glass substrate showed nano-wire like structures with a diameter in the range of 240–500 nm and length of several microns (supplementary information†). The length of the wires increases with an increase in temperature and duration of deposition, whereas the width of the wires becomes saturated at higher temperatures. SEM micrographs also revealed that the films grown at substrate temperatures of 425 °C and a deposition time of 1 and 2 h (Fig. 8) were more uniform compared to the films deposited at higher temperatures. It was also observed that films were more uniformly deposited for 1 h at a particular temperature. A large amount of ribbons was observed in the films obtained at a substrate temperature of 475 °C and a deposition time of 2 h. This may be due to increase in the length and breadth (or diameter) of the wires at these conditions and appear as nanoribbons. Fig. 8  SEM image of uniformly coated antimony selenide film obtained by AACVD of [Sb{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] at 425 °C for a) 1 h and b) 2 h (inset displays the magnified image of the same). Black bismuth selenide films were deposited on glass substrate using [Bi{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] (4) at substrate temperatures ranging from 325 to 475 °C for different durations (Table S2, supplementary information†). XRD pattern and EDX of thin films deposited at 350 and 475 °C for 1 h corresponds to rhombohedral Bi3Se4 (JCPDS File No. 29-0245) and the hexagonal phase of Bi3Se2 (JCPDS File No. 40-0935), respectively. The XRD patterns of thin films deposited at 375, 400, 425 °C for 1 h closely matches with the hexagonal phase of BiSe (JCPDS File No. 29-0246), the composition of which was also supported by EDX measurements (Table S2, supplementary information†). Although there was no change either in phase or composition for the films deposited for a longer duration (2 h) at 375 °C, at higher temperatures (400 and 425 °C), films containing bismuth rich phase, rhombohedral Bi4Se3 (JCPDS File No. 28-0176) (from XRD and EDX), were formed. Films were becoming selenium deficient with increase in substrate temperature (Table S2, supplementary information†), which may be due to the volatile nature of selenium. Films deposited at 400–475 °C for 2 h and also at 475 °C for 1 h showed a new peak at 2θ = 17.2°, which may be due to selenium deficient films at high temperatures. Similar loss of selenium in Bi2Se3 thin films at higher temperatures and long annealing times has been reported earlier.43,44SEM images of the bismuth selenide films grown on the glass substrates at a substrate temperature of 350 °C for 1 h displayed boat/half hexagon shaped structures (Fig. 9a). These shapes orient themselves in such a fashion as to appear like hexagons that are cut diagonally. The boat-like structures grow at temperatures above 350 °C to appear as petals (375 °C, 1 h), sheets (400 and 425 °C, 1 h) or hazy wool-like (475 °C, 1 h) structures with dimensions in the nano regime (Fig. 9). SEM pictures of bismuth selenide films grown at 375–400 °C and a deposition time of 1 h revealed that they are uniform (supplementary information†) as compared to the films deposited at higher temperatures and longer durations. Fig. 9  a) SEM pictures of bismuth selenide boats (inset shows arrangement of boat like structures in a diagonally cleaved hexagon shape), b) petals, c) sheets and d) wool-like structures obtained by AACVD of [Bi{Se–C5H3(Me-3)N}3] at 350, 375, 400 and 475 °C, respectively, for 1 h. ConclusionPyridylselenolates of Sb(III) and Bi(III) have been conveniently synthesized and isolated as air stable monomeric complexes. They have been employed as single source precursors for facile synthesis of metal selenide nanomaterials and deposition of thin films by AACVD. Nanomaterials with different morphologies and phases have been prepared under different experimental conditions. The dimensions and orientations of nanomaterials can be controlled by changing the substrate temperature and deposition timing. These complexes have also been used as precursors for the preparation of metal selenide thin films.
