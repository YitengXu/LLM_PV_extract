We investigated the charge carrier dynamics in triple cation-based PSCs through temperature dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, thermal admittance spectroscopy, and space charge limited current (SCLC). The temperature dependent capacitance versus frequency (C–f) spectra reveal two kinds of activation process, one at low frequency and high temperature (>260 K), and the other at high frequency and low temperature (<260 K). The evaluated activation energy (EA) at a high temperature from all three experiments was found to be in the range of 0.255–0.266 eV, which corresponds to the activation of the migration of halide anions, while the low-temperature activation process stems from the trapping/de-trapping of electronic charges from shallow traps. The trap density of states in triple cation-based perovskites (1015 eV−1 cm−3) was evaluated to be over two to six orders of magnitude lower than that of typically used single cation-based perovskites, while the charge carrier mobility (5.76 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) evaluated from the SCLC technique was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of single cation perovskites.
1 Introduction
Mixed-cation and mixed-halide [FAyMAzCs1−y−zPb(IaBrbCl1−a−b)3] based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) delivered excellent device performance1,2 and showed improved stability against humidity and temperature as compared to single cation FA/MA/Cs perovskites.3,4 The mixing of cations allows tuning of the direct energy bandgap of the perovskite layer5–7 and improves the environmental stability of PSCs.8 The triple cation perovskites provide structural stability and retard the formation of the yellow phase which adversely impacts the photovoltaic (PV) performance. Further, higher reproducibility, and thermal and moisture stability were shown by triple cation-based PSCs as compared to single or double cation-based PSCs.9–12 Additionally, the incorporation of Cs into perovskites mitigates ion migration, subsequently reducing the halide segregation problem in mixed halide perovskites.13–16
In PSCs, besides electronic carriers (electrons and holes) several other charge species including halide anions (X− = I−, Cl−, Br−), halide vacancies (VX+), and monovalent (Cs+, MA+, and FA+) and divalent (Pb2+) cations also migrate under illumination and applied bias which causes electrical instability.17–19 The ionic and electronic charge transport features in PSCs can be distinguished by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).20–22 EIS is an effective and facile technique to distinguish the physical phenomena that occur at various time scales such as charge transfer at the interface or in bulk, charge recombination, electrical and ionic transport, dielectric relaxation, etc.23,24 Due to the low activation energy of halide ion (X−) migration in PSCs, X− accumulates at the electron selective layer (ESL) interface, while VX+ concentrates at the hole selective layer (HSL) interface, leading to electrode polarization. The electrode polarization induces an additional internal electric field originating from the ESL to the HSL which assists the charge carrier collection efficiency.25,26 To investigate these phenomena in a triple cation [Cs0.1FAPbI3(0.81)MAPbBr3(0.09)] PSC, we recorded EIS in the dark as well as under illumination by varying the applied bias. Further, to investigate the nature of charges accumulated at the perovskite/charge selective contact interface, we measured EIS spectra in both forward and reverse biases by changing the polarity of the device. The measured EIS were analyzed by fitting with an equivalent circuit (EC) and key electrical parameters were extracted.
It is common knowledge that halide perovskites are prone to defects due to their soft crystal lattice that causes lattice distortion and consequently have very low defect formation energies.18,27 The presence of impurities, local variation in polarization energy, and electrode polarization are other reasons for the formation of defects in PSCs.28–30 Moreover, due to the low activation energy for halide anion migration, cationic vacancies are also present in the perovskite absorbing layer.31 The charge carriers are captured by these defect states (created due to distortion in the perovskites lattice, grain boundaries, or impurity or halide vacancies) and are termed as traps that hinder the transport of photogenerated charge carriers to the respective electrodes, subsequently causing device performance deterioration. Further, the presence of traps causes Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) non-radiative recombination,32J–V hysteresis,33 charge scattering,34 a decrease in electron–hole diffusion length, and reduction in device open-circuit voltage (Voc).35 Moreover, defects also impact the device stability and accelerate the degradation. Once the charge carrier gets trapped in these trap states its fate is determined by the nature of the trap it gets captured in. A trap state that resides within the bandgap can capture charge carriers, while trap states residing above (below) the conduction band (valence band) edge have no adverse impact on the charge transport properties of free carriers.36 If carriers get trapped in shallow traps near the band edge, having a depth less than the thermal energy, i.e.ΔE ≤ kBT ≅ 25 meV,they can be detrapped again by thermal energy or optical excitation. These traps only restrict the efficient movement of free carriers through trapping and detrapping processes. On the other hand, deep trap states existing near the middle of the energy gap having depth ΔE > kBT act as SRH non-radiative recombination centers.
The elucidation of the nature of traps, trap distribution density, and trap activation energy is of paramount importance. Several theoretical models such as DFT calculation,37 first-principles calculation,38 and several experimental techniques including temperature-dependent photoluminescence,39 transient absorption spectroscopy,40 time-resolved fluorescence,39 thermally stimulated current (TSC) spectroscopy,41 deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS),42 space charge limited current (SCLC),43 thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS),44,45 and capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements46 have been employed to analyze the traps present in PSCs. TAS combined with Mott–Schottky analysis (C–V plot) provides complete, i.e. both quantitative and qualitative, information on traps in PSCs. It provides the trap density, distribution of traps, depth of traps present and trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers. Besides, TAS provides information on the device's underlying mechanism, which is difficult to unravel by other techniques. Moreover, the important electrical parameters such as dielectric constant, built-in voltage, depletion width at the perovskite/charge selective contact (CSC) junction, interfacial charge accumulation, electrode polarization, and dielectric relaxation, which impact the performance of PSCs, can also be extracted from this technique. In the present work, we investigated traps in triple-cation PSCs by measuring temperature-dependent capacitance–frequency (C–f) spectra, and the Mott–Schottky plot and aforementioned parameters have been evaluated. We noted two different kinds of activation process, one at low frequency (<1 kHz) and high temperature (>260 K), and the other at high frequency (>1 kHz) and low temperature (<260 K), attributed to halide anion migration and electron transport, respectively.
2 Results and discussion
The charge transport properties of PSCs were investigated in the normal n-i-p device configuration, viz. FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/Cs0.1(FAPbI3)0.81(MAPbBr3)0.09/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as depicted in Fig. 1a. The J–V characteristics under illumination (Fig. 1b) showed that the fabricated PSC exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.78% in the reverse scan (RS) and 18.12% in the forward scan (FS). The electrical response of the fabricated PSCs was investigated by measuring EIS as a function of applied bias and photovoltage (Fig. 2a–c). All spectra display two semicircles and are analyzed using an equivalent circuit (Fig. 2d). The resistance RS is the contact series resistance (e.g. electrodes, connecting wires, etc.). The resistance R1 together with the constant phase element (CPE1) analyzes the high-frequency (HF) semicircle, while the low-frequency (LF) part of the spectra was analyzed using a parallel R–C circuit containing R2 and CPE2.

The constant phase elements CPE1 and CPE2 were used for rational fitting of EIS spectra (attributed to the inhomogeneous perovskite layer and interface) rather than pure capacitance C1 and C2.44 The variation of fitting parameters as a function of applied bias and photovoltage is illustrated in Fig. S1 and S2.† The high-frequency capacitance C1 is associated with the geometrical capacitance and bulk dielectric relaxation of the perovskite layer.31 The value of C1 was evaluated to be ∼4.50 × 10−8 or 9.18 × 10−8 F cm−2 under short circuit (SC) conditions, slightly increased in the forward bias (FB) and decreased in the reverse bias (RB) (Fig. S1a†) but remaining in the order of 10−8 F cm−2. The relative permittivity (εr) of the perovskites was derived from the relation:Cg = εrε0A/Lwhere ε0 = 8.86 × 10−14 F cm−1 is the permittivity of free space, and A = 0.49 cm2 and L = 400 nm are the device active area and thickness of the perovskite layer, respectively. The evaluated value of dielectric constant from high-frequency capacitance was found to be 41.5 which is in agreement with the measured value of ∼44 from C–f spectra of the perovskite layer sandwiched between two gold electrodes (Fig. S3†).47 Moreover, a similar value of C1 dominates the capacitive response at room temperature in the frequency region of >1 kHz of the C–f spectra of the fabricated PSCs (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the dielectric constant of triple-cation perovskites is higher than that of single or double cation perovskites (Table S1†).

It can be deduced from Fig. S1a† that the high-frequency capacitance (C1) increases in the forward bias and decreases in the reverse bias. The increase in capacitance C1 can be explained in terms of the decrease of depletion width under the forward bias which enables the migration of electronic and ionic charges inside the perovskite layer. In contrast, the depletion width increases under the reverse bias; subsequently, the free carrier density decreases owing to the reduction in geometrical capacitance. Further, high-frequency resistance R1 (Fig. S1c†) is the charge transport resistance (Rct) in the bulk perovskite layer,48 observed to be decreased in the forward bias while it increases in the reverse bias. The applied forward bias enables charge transport into the perovskite layer, resulting in a decrease of charge transport resistance. However, under the reverse bias, the charge carriers are depleted in the perovskite layer owing to a depletion width increment, consequently increasing the charge transport resistance. Capacitance C2 responds to the prominent low-frequency mechanisms that govern the PSC operation and is attributed to the accumulation of charge carriers in the vicinity of the perovskite/charge selective layer interface.49 We noted (Fig. S2a and b†) that under an external forward bias or photovoltage (illumination), the low-frequency capacitance, C2, shows an increment of over four orders in magnitude i.e. 9.79 × 10−7 F at the short circuit and 1.29 × 10−2 F at VOC; however, under an external reverse bias, the value of C2 largely remains constant and slightly decreases for V > 0.8 V. Under the influence of forward bias or photovoltage, halide ions (X−) migrate towards the HTL and accumulate in the vicinity of the perovskite/HTL interface,50 causing an increase of C2. The evolution of low-frequency capacitance as a function of photovoltage (illumination) was fitted by the Guoy–Chapman model (Fig. S4†) given by:51,52  where nacc is the ionic concentration in bulk, mc is a capacitive exponent, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature. The interfacial accumulation region under equilibrium conditions (zero bias) is given by the ionic Debye length53  and the corresponding ionic accumulation capacitance is  .
The accumulation zone at zero bias was evaluated to be ∼5.5 nm with an ionic charge density of 1.98 × 1018 cm−3, similar to that reported for the ionic Debye length of MAPbI3.53 Furthermore, the forward bias facilitates the ionic migration in the perovskite layer, and consequently the low-frequency resistance, R2, decreases (Fig. S2c†). Resistance R2 is attributed to electronic charge transport at the perovskite/CSC interface. Under the reverse bias, the value of C2 remains the same up to 0.8 V, and then slightly decreases at higher biases. The decrease in C2 for V > 0.8 V is attributed to the depopulation of accumulated ionic charges at the interface. Under the influence of high reverse bias, halide anions migrate away from the interface and compensate for halide vacancies.54 This mitigates the ionic migration in the perovskite layer, also evident from the increase of the LF resistance, R2 (Fig. S2c†). Moreover, we noted (Fig. 2a) that at high reverse biases (>0.8 V) the two arcs merge into a single one, further confirming the mitigation of ionic migration at higher reverse biases.
We deduced (Fig. S1b and S2b†) that under illumination/photovoltage, both C1 and C2 exponentially increase with an increase of illumination intensity for photovoltage of above 600 mV. The increase in C1 is marginal and remains in the order of 10−8 F, while C2 increases around six orders of magnitude under photovoltage. The slight increase in C1 with illumination can be attributed to photogeneration of the charge carriers as evident from the decrease of resistance R1 (Fig. S1d†). The exponential evolution of C2 under illumination is attributed to the accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers at the interface and activation of ionic transport in the perovskite layer for photovoltage >600 mV, which further confirms that C2 is related to ionic migration in the perovskite layer. Resistance R2 and capacitance C2 both vary with illumination intensities due to photovoltage variation and we found that the resistance decreases and capacitance increases with an increase of illumination or increase of external bias, suggesting that both R2 and C2 have a common origin. The time constant for these processes was calculated by:τ1 = R1C1 andτ2 = R2C2.
It was noticed that the shorter lifetime τ1 decreases from 10−4–10−6 s, while the longer lifetime τ2 remains in the range of 101–10−2 s. The faster feature is usually ascribed to the recombination of free carriers,40 while the slower feature is usually ascribed to the response from defects and ionic migration.55,56
The temperature dependent capacitance vs. frequency (C–f–T) spectra (Fig. 3a) exhibit two distinct features viz. (i) a high-frequency region at low temperature (fH) and (ii) a low-frequency region at higher temperature (fL), similar to reports.57,58 The two features in C–f–T spectra indicate the existence of two distinctive activation processes in the fabricated PSCs. Almora et al. have assigned these two activation processes to the phase transition of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer from an orthorhombic structure (γ-phase) to a tetragonal structure (β-phase). To probe any possible effect induced in the perovskite layer structure that causes the variation in capacitance of the PSC, we measured the temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction spectra (Fig. S5†). In the measured temperature range, there is no structural or phase change observed in the perovskite layer. Warner et al. observed similar C–f–T spectra in CIGS-based solar cells and assigned the fH feature to a transport barrier or interfacial/buffer layer while the fL feature was assigned to tail states at the band edges or presence of slow defect states in the bulk or at the interface.59 To unravel the origin of these two different regions in the triple cation-based PSC, we plotted the temperature dependent evolution of capacitance at different frequencies (Fig. 3b). It suggests that at low frequency (up to 1 kHz), capacitance remains constant (∼90 nF cm−2–95 nF cm−2) until 260 K; thereafter, an exponential evolution is observed for higher temperature. The constant value of capacitance at low temperature corresponds to the geometric capacitance of the perovskite layer. The exponential evolution of capacitance at low frequency is attributed to the polarization of interfaces due to electronic and ionic charge accumulation at the perovskite/CSC interface.60–63 In contrast, the C–T graph at high frequency exhibits the opposite behavior i.e. an increase of capacitance at low temperature from 40 nF cm−2 to 90 nF cm−2, and a constant value at high temperature. It is established that the evolution of low-frequency capacitance corresponds to ion accumulation at the interface; however, the increase of HF capacitance at lower temperature is not frequently observed. Recently, Awni et al. have assigned the high-frequency capacitance to trapping/de-trapping of charge carriers in Spiro-OMeTAD doped with lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) salts, while the low-frequency signature corresponds to the defects in perovskite absorber layers or at the perovskite/CSC interfaces.57 An ionically gated interface-transistor model was built,64,65 in which the electronic energy barriers to injection and recombination are modulated by the accumulation/depletion of ionic charges at the interfaces. The applied ac voltage to PSCs introduces an out-of-phase capacitive ionic current which modulates the electronic recombination and injection across the interface that causes capacitive-like or inductive-like behavior without charge accumulation at the interface.65,66
To illustrate the mechanism responsible for the evolution of capacitance in the high-frequency and low-frequency regions, we evaluated the activation energy (EA) and trap density of states (NT) by plotting (−fdC/df) vs. f (Fig. 4a and b). The activation energy was evaluated by plotting the Arrhenius plot between peak frequency (fpeak) and 1000/T (Fig. 4c and d). The activation energy for the features fL and fH was calculated to be 254 meV and 91 meV, respectively.
This finding suggests that for temperatures above 260 K, halide anions start migrating in the perovskite layer in addition to electronic charges. The temperature range used to activate the halide anion migration in the perovskite layer is the same as that in previous reports.31,67,68 This finding suggests that the low-frequency arc in EIS and evolution of capacitance at low frequency at high temperature are due to activation of ionic migration and accumulation at the perovskite/CSC interface. The extracted charge transport resistance (R1) as a function of temperature (Fig. 5e) decreases from 1 × 107 Ω at 130 K to 596 Ω at 360 K.
 Fig. 5  Temperature dependent EIS spectra (a and b). Extracted values of capacitance C1 from the EC (c), Arrhenius plot of onset frequency of the LF arc (d), and resistances R1 (e) and R2 (f) as a function of temperature. 
The interfacial charge transport resistance R2 firstly decreases up to 260 K (Fig. 5f), and thereafter increases and achieves a saturation value of 1 × 1020 Ω at 310 K. At low temperature, R2 decreases with the increase of temperature because thermal energy assists the interfacial charge transfer at the perovskite/CSC interface. However, as temperature increases above 260 K, halide anions start migrating towards the ETL, leaving behind cationic vacancies near the HTL, resulting in the accumulation of halide anions at the perovskite/ETL interface, and develop an internal field from the HTL to the ETL. This internal field restricts the electronic charge transfer at the interface and as a result R2 increases beyond 260 K.
We measured the Mott–Schottky plot at an intermediate frequency (10 kHz) to suppress the effect of ionic migration; also in this frequency range, the depletion layer capacitance (Cdl) dominates the dielectric polarization capacitance (Fig. 3a). The measured Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 6a) exhibits three regions.58,69,70 In the reverse bias, the perovskite layer is fully depleted and the device capacitance corresponds to geometrical capacitance (Cg). In the forward bias, the depletion width (W) decreases which leads to an increase of capacitance following the law: C−2 ∝ V (blue line), corresponding to depletion layer capacitance Cdl. When the forward bias approaches Vbi, the depletion width shrinks and charge carriers accumulate at the interface and capacitance exponentially increases which corresponds to interfacial electronic/ionic charge accumulation capacitance Cs.57 Therefore, no overlapping of Cdl with Cs can be seen, although both regions are visible71 for the validation of the Mott–Schottky plot to extract the built-in voltage and dopant density (N) in the perovskite solar cells. The interfacial built-in voltage (Vbi) and depletion width (w) were calculated from the intercept on the voltage axis and slope of the blue region (Cdl region), respectively, from the Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 6a). The evaluated built-in voltage is 0.88 V, depletion width w = 43 nm, and doping density Nd ∼ 2.35 × 1021 cm−3. Fig. 6b shows the trap density profile as a function of demarcation energy (Eω). The peak trap density is observed at around 255 meV with a peak value of ∼2.05 × 1015 eV cm−3 at 360 K. Further, the peak of trap density (255 meV) is similar to the one calculated from C–F–T and EIS spectra (Fig. 4d and 5d), respectively. The density of the deep traps in mixed cation perovskites are lower than that of single cation-based perovskites: 1016–1021 eV−1 cm−3 for MAPbI3,43,70,72,73 3 × 1016 eV−1 cm−3 for MAPbIxCl3−x (ref. 74) and 1018 eV−1 cm−3 for MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 (ref. 57) (Table S1†). Arguably, the observed variation in capacitance at low frequency and high temperature corresponds to activation of halide ions and accumulation at the perovskite/CSC interface. The density of traps for high frequency at 130 K was evaluated to be ∼7.60 × 1013 eV−1 cm−3 with a peak value of around 90 meV (Fig. S6†) which is around two orders lower than that calculated for low frequency. With an increase of temperature, the depth of shallow traps slightly deepens (94 meV) and the density of states decreases to 6.22 × 1013 eV−1 cm−3 at 190 K, owing to the filling of shallow traps by thermally generated charge carriers. The peak of shallow traps (90 meV) follows Fig. 4c. The shallow traps are suggested to be associated with charging and discharging electronic charges in the perovskite and perovskite/CSC interface. The shallow traps have a higher charging/discharging rate and respond to external high-frequency signals while deep traps have a low trapping/detrapping rate and follow the low-frequency signal. With a decrease in the temperature of the PSC, shallow trap states freeze out resulting in a decrease in capacitance.

To further explore the mechanism of charge transport in PSCs, J–V characteristics of the triple cation perovskites in the electron-only device were measured in the temperature range 250 K–390 K (Fig. 7a). The measured J–V characteristics show three distinct regions, namely (i) ohmic with the log(J) vs. log(V) slope equal to 1, (ii) trap-filling region with slope >2, and (iii) trap-filled region. Under an applied bias, traps are being filled by free carriers in the TFL region, and at transition voltage (VTFL) all traps are filled and free carrier density becomes higher than trap density. Trap density (ntrap) was evaluated through the equation:ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/qL2and calculated to be 3.97 × 1016 cm−3 at room temperature. The trap filling region was fitted with the SCLC equation for exponentially distributed traps:75,76  where q is the total charge, Nc is the effective density of states at the edge of the conduction band, and Hb is the density of traps at the edge of the conduction band. The fitting parameters used are Hb = 3.97 × 1016 cm−3, N = 5.30 × 1016 cm−3, μ = 5.76 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and characteristic trap energyEt = kBTC = 292 meV and l = TC/T.

The SCLC derived charge carrier mobility in mixed cation-based PSCs (μ = 5.76 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of single cation-based PSCs in both n-i-p (1.11 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1)46 and p-i-n (5.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1)31 configurations. The higher carrier mobility in the mixed cation than in single cation PSCs is possibly due to the lower trap density in the former (2.05 × 1015 eV−1 cm−3) than latter (1016–1021 eV−1 cm−3) as illustrated in Table S1.† The Arrhenius plot of current density at 0.75 V vs. 1000/T (Fig. 7b) suggests that the calculated activation energy of 0.266 eV is in a similar range to that derived from capacitance and impedance spectroscopy discussed above.
3 Conclusions
We probed the charge carrier dynamics in triple cation-based perovskite solar cells by employing impedance and C–F–T spectroscopy, along with dark J–V characteristics. By measuring bias and polarity dependent impedance spectroscopy, we interpreted both geometrical and interfacial capacitance of the fabricated solar cells. The exponential increase in low-frequency capacitance in the forward bias is ascribed to the accumulation of ionic charge at the interface and this decreases slightly in the reverse bias due to the depopulation of accumulated charges at the perovskite/charge selective contact interface. Temperature dependent C–f spectra reveal two types of activation process, attributed to ionic migration and charging/discharging of shallow traps. The trap density of states in mixed cation-based solar cells (2.45 × 1015 eV cm−3) is lower than that of single or double cation-based perovskite solar cells, owing to the better structural stability. The dark J–V characteristics of electron-only devices display typical SCLC behavior with an exponential distribution of traps and carrier mobility evaluated to be nearly an order of magnitude higher than that of the single cation-based perovskite. Temperature-dependent diffractograms reveal no phase transition or structural changes in the investigated temperature range for the triple cation perovskite, suggesting that the temperature-dependent electrical property variation does not stem from phase transitions and is ascribed to the activation of ionic transport and interfacial effect. Our results quantify the merits of triple cation-based solar cells and attribute it to the added charge transport properties in terms of enhanced carrier mobility, lower trap density, and stable perovskite structure.
4 Experimental section
Materials
The chemicals for the perovskite were obtained from Dyesol except for PbI2 and CsI2 which were procured from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) and were utilized as such. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was acquired from Merck KGaA. Lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich. 30NRD TiO2 was obtained from Dyesol.
Device fabrication
The laser-etched FTO-coated glasses (NSG10) were thoroughly cleaned via ultrasonication with Hellmanex II solution, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol for 20 min per step. The dried substrates using compressed air were further treated by UV-ozone for 30 min before device fabrication. The TiO2 compact layer was deposited using spray pyrolysis at 500 °C employing 1 mL of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetyl acetonate) precursor solution (75% in 2-propanol) in 19 mL of pure ethanol using oxygen as a carrier gas, followed by annealing for another 30 min at 500 °C to acquire the anatase phase. Once the substrates were cooled down to room temperature, the TiO2 mesoporous layer (1:8 w/v in ethanol) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm (2000 rpm s−1 acceleration) for 30 s, followed by a progressive heating step up to 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down, the samples were transferred immediately to an argon-filled glovebox under controlled moisture and oxygen conditions (H2O level: <1 ppm and O2 level: <10 ppm) to prevent moisture absorption into the ETM layer. The triple-cation perovskite layers were deposited through a one-step method.77 The perovskite precursor solution was prepared with CsI (0.10 M), FAI (1.05 M), PbI2 (1.24 M), MABr (0.12 M), and PbBr2 (0.12 M) in an anhydrous solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in a 4:1 vol ratio. The precursor solution was spin-coated in a two-step spin-coating program (1000 rpm and 6000 rpm for 10 and 30 s, respectively) and 112 μL of chlorobenzene was dripped 10 s before ending the second spin step followed by annealing at 100 °C for 1 h for perovskite crystallization. Spiro-OMeTAD (70 mM) was prepared by dissolving the desired amount of material in 1 mL chlorobenzene together with 38.4 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 21.1 μL of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile). 35 μL of HTM solution was dropped on the perovskite layer and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Au electrode (80 nm) was thermally evaporated under a pressure of 2 × 10−6 Pa.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination from a 450 W AAA Oriel solar simulator (94023 A). An NREL certified monocrystalline silicon solar cell was used for calibration. The active area was defined by a laser-cut black metal mask (0.09 cm2). The J–V measurements under illumination conditions were performed at a scan rate of 500 mV s−1 with a 10 s pre-sweep delay (preconditioning) and scanning in the reverse direction starting at 1.2 V. IPCE measurements were performed using a 150 W xenon lamp attached to a Bentham PVE300 motorized 1/4 m monochromator. Impedance spectroscopy was performed in the frequency range of 2 MHz–100 mHz under the perturbation of a 20 mV ac signal using a Biologic SP300 potentiostat and a white LED (to provide illumination conditions) in a faradaic chamber. Temperature-dependent capacitance–frequency measurements were performed with an LCR meter model No. E4980A along with a Linkam (LTS420) sample heating control system filled with liquid nitrogen in a closed environment. The temperature was adjusted using LabVIEW (NI) software. The temperature-dependent dark J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter together with the Linkam system.
