    , Accepted 29th November 2016First published on 29th November 2016AbstractThe reactivity of gas-phase cluster anions Ta3N2− with C2H4 under thermal collision conditions was studied by mass spectrometry in conjunction with density functional theory calculations. The full dehydrogenation of the C2H4 molecule was observed, with the formation of two dihydrogen molecules. Interestingly, the two carbon atoms originating from the first C2H4 molecule are used to construct another cluster Ta3N2C2−, which can activate one more C2H4 releasing one H2 molecule. Therefore, three dihydrogen molecules are liberated from two ethene molecules in the overall reaction. The full dehydrogenation of C2H4 by gas-phase anions as well as the structure and reactivity of M–N–C (M: transition metal) cluster is reported for the first time. The properties of Ta3N2− and Ta3N2C2− elucidated herein are of use in providing fundamental information that is necessary to tailor the design of new and effective catalysts by applying the related materials.
1. Introduction
Dihydrogen molecules (H2), with the highest gravimetric energy density compared with other fuels and non-polluted H2O as the combustion product, are proposed as a potential candidate for future energy supply.1 H2 is also applied as a crucial chemical feedstock in the modern industry, such as in the synthesis of ammonia for fertilizers and in petroleum refining.2 Although several methods have been proposed for H2 production from renewable resources, such as water electrolysis using solar, wind, or hydroelectric power, the most advanced route for the large-scale production of H2 to date is still the steam reforming process. These reactions typically proceed using catalysts and high temperature (more energy) is required; the unwanted greenhouse gas CO2 is emitted in this route. In addition, the fuel cell, the device that makes use of hydrogen, is very sensitive to the CO content in hydrogen feedstocks, and even 100 ppm CO in H2 can deteriorate the proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance;3 therefore, multistep processes are needed to purify the hydrogen product. In this context, the exploration of novel approaches or the development of new catalysts to produce pure hydrogen efficiently, simply at low temperature or even at room temperature, is attracting more and more public attention.
Catalysts with high catalytic activity are indispensable in the above-mentioned reactions. Transition metal nitrides (hereinafter TMNs) are often applied as heterogeneous catalysts in hydroprocessing and numerous other H2-treatment reactions.4–7 For instance, Ta3N5 has been widely used for both photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting,8–12 including the H2 evolution reaction. Therefore, it may be possible that TMNs, such as tantalum nitride, could serve as efficient catalysts for the dihydrogen production process. Notably, on the surface of catalysts, the catalytic processes occur at some specific active sites, which may be anionic, cationic, or neutral. Designing a catalyst with good catalytic performance needs a profound knowledge about structure–property relationships of active sites and the reaction mechanisms on the atomic scale, but it is quite challenging to obtain this information directly and clearly from “real-life” experiments.
Gas-phase studies conducted under well-defined and reproducible conditions applying state-of-the-art mass spectrometry (MS) in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations are an alternative approach to obtain structure–activity relationships of interesting clusters at a strictly molecular level.13–22 Several types of ethene activation reactions mediated by clusters with ligands have been reported in the gas phase;23,24 among others, hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) with the liberation of H2 or C2H2 was generally reported, in which two C–H bonds were activated. In this study, we report interesting results that Ta3N2− cluster anions can cleave all of the four C–H bonds and one CC bond of an ethene molecule quite efficiently, leading to the formation of Ta3N2C2− and two hydrogen molecules; the generated Ta3N2C2− cluster can further activate two C–H bonds of another C2H4 molecule, releasing the third H2. The reactivity of Ta3N2− and the structure–reactivity relationship of the M–N–C (M: transition metal) cluster suggest that tantalum nitride may be a potential catalyst for hydrogen production.
2. Methods
2.1 Experimental methods
A reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS)25 equipped with a laser ablation ion source, a quadrupole mass filter (QMF),26 and a linear ion-trap (LIT) reactor27 was used to study the reactions of clusters with ethene molecules. The Ta3N2− anions were generated by laser ablation of a tantalum disk in the presence of about 0.1% NH3 seeded in a He carrier gas with a backing pressure of 5 atm. The ions of interest were mass-selected using the QMF and entered into the LIT reactor, where they were confined and thermalized by collisions with a pulse of He gas and then interacted with a pulse of ethene (C2H4) for a period of time. It has been proved that the ions are thermalized to (or close to) room temperature before reactions in our previous works.27,28 The ions ejected from the LIT were detected using a reflection TOF-MS. The method of deriving the rate constants is described in detail in ref. 29. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis was performed using NBO 3.130 implemented in Gaussian 09.
2.2 Theoretical methods
All DFT calculations were performed using the Gaussian 0931 program package employing the hybrid B3LYP exchange–correlation functional.32–34 For all the reaction pathways, 6-311+G(d) basis sets35 were selected for N, C, and H atoms; the Stuttgart relativistic small core basis set and an effective core potential36 augmented with two f-type and one g-type polarization functions for Ta [ζ(f) = 0.210, 0.697; ζ(g) = 0.472] as recommended by Martin and Sundermann.37 Among the 20 tested methods, B3LYP gives the best prediction of Ta–N, N–N, C–H, and N–H bonds, as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The reaction mechanism calculations involve geometry optimization of reaction intermediates and transition states (TSs). Vibrational frequency calculations were performed to ensure that the intermediates and TSs have zero and only one imaginary frequency, respectively. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations38,39 were carried out to make sure that a TS connects two appropriate minima. The reported energies (ΔH0K in eV) are corrected with zero-point vibrations.
3. Results
3.1 Experimental results
The Ta3N2− cluster (m/z = 571) was mass-selected (Fig. 1a) and interacted with C2H4 molecules in the ion trap reactor (Fig. 1b and c). Because the Ta3N2− mass range is close to the upper limit of mass selection by applying the current apparatus, a tiny peak (m/z = 572) corresponding to a mass increase of 1 amu with respect to Ta3N2− was always present in the spectrum. Upon the reactions with 1.7 mPa C2H4 for about 3.1 ms as shown in Fig. 1b, new intense peaks Ta3N2C2− and Ta3N2C4H2− were generated; a weak peak, assigned to Ta3N2C2H2−, was also observed. When more C2H4 molecules were introduced into the LIT (Fig. 1c), the newly formed Ta3N2C4H2− cluster could adsorb another C2H4 molecule, resulting in the formation of Ta3N2C4H2(C2H4)− (649 amu). As shown in Fig. 2, in the reactant-gas–pressure dependent experiments, the relative ion intensity of Ta3N2C2− does not increase significantly with respect to the increase of reactant gas pressures, indicating that this cluster is consumed rapidly by other reactions. On the basis of a least-squares fitting process, we can draw the conclusion that the formation of Ta3N2C4H2− is mainly due to a secondary reaction (reaction (1b)), and a small portion comes from the reaction of Ta3N2− with two C2H4 molecules (reaction (2)). The observed reactions are as follows: Ta3N2− + C2H4 → Ta3N2C2− + 2H2(1a) Ta3N2C2− + C2H4 → Ta3N2C4H2− + H2(1b) Ta3N2− + 2C2H4 → Ta3N2C4H2− + 3H2 (minor)(2)

The solid lines are fitted to the experimental data points derived with the approximation of the pseudo-first-order reaction mechanism. 
Another product peak of Ta3N2C2H2− (597 amu), generated from the reaction of Ta3N2C2− + C2H4 → Ta3N2C2H2− + C2H2, is very weak, and not the main topic of this study. The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k1) for the reaction of Ta3N2− with C2H4 amounts to 2.0 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, corresponding to the reaction efficiency (ϕ)40,41 of 21%.
3.2 Computational results

The reaction of Ta3N2− with C2H4. 
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the ground state of Ta3N2− is a 3A state with C1 symmetry featuring 3IS1. The isomer with singlet and quintuplet states is 0.35 and 0.64 eV higher in energy, respectively. The lowest energy reaction pathway for reaction (1a) is presented in Fig. 3. When the Ta3N2− cluster interacts with the first C2H4 molecule, two carbon atoms of ethene coordinate to the two Ta atoms (Ta1 and Ta2), forming the encounter complex I1 with a large energy release (−2.16 eV (ΔH0K) with respect to the separated reactants). As the Ta–H bond distance decreases, hydrogen atom transfer occurs, resulting in the formation of intermediate I2viaTS1. Through transition state TS2, the CC bond of intermediate I2 ruptures and yields intermediate I3 with a six-membered Ta1–C1–Ta2–N–Ta3–N ring. In the subsequent step, another Ta–C bond is formed (I3 → TS3 → I4), and then a second H atom in I4 transfers from the methylene group to the Ta1 atom (I4 → TS4 → I5), generating a Ta–H bond in the most stable structure (I5) on the potential energy surface (PES). From I5, dehydrogenation is brought about to form two H2 molecules continually (I5 → TS5 → Ta3N2C2H2− + H2 → TS6 → I6), and the product Ta3N2C2− (P1) with a cage-like structure of Cs symmetry is generated, in which Ta1 and Ta2 atoms are in the same chemical environments and different from the case of the Ta3 atom. Due to the lower electronegativity of a carbon atom (2.55) versus that of a nitrogen atom (3.04),42 Ta1 and Ta2 sites are less negatively charged compared to the Ta3 site in Ta3N2C2−. The Rice–Ramperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory43 calculations indicate that the rate of internal conversion (kconversion) of the most difficult step along the PES (Ta3N2C2H2− → TS6 → I6) is 9.7 × 108 s−1 (details are provided in the ESI†). The effective pressure of the cooling gas He is around 3.0 Pa in the ion trap, and the collisional rate (kcollision) of Ta3N2C2H2− with He atoms is 6.9 × 105 s−1, which is smaller than kconversion by about three orders of magnitude. As a result, the forward reaction step leading to the formation of P1 is more favorable than the one in which Ta3N2C2H2− clusters are stabilized through multiple collisions with He atoms, in line with the experimental results (see the ESI† for details). In addition, we also consider the possibility that N2 is liberated in the reaction of Ta3N2− with C2H4, due to the same masses of N2 and C2H4 molecules, and the DFT calculations show that this process is thermally unavailable (Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  DFT calculated potential-energy profile for the reactions of Ta3N2− with C2H4 in the triplet spin state. The insetted panel plots the structure of Ta3N2−, and Mulliken atomic spin densities over Ta atoms (in parentheses with a unit of μB) are given. The selected bond lengths are given in pm. The zero-point vibration corrected energies (ΔH0K in eV) of the reaction intermediates, transition states, and products with respect to the separated reactants are given. The superscripts indicate the spin states of species, and those without superscripts are triplet spin states. 
Much more effort has been devoted to find other possibilities of forming an H2 unit; however, the direct dissociation into Ta3N2C2− + 2H2 without CC bond cleavage is thermodynamically unfavourable (Fig. S3, ESI†). Other pathways to generate P1, which also involve CC bond cleavage (Fig. S4, ESI†), require more energy than the one shown in Fig. 3, suggesting that the hydrogen atom transfer step (I1 → TS1 → I2) proceeds before the CC bond cleavage step.


The reaction of Ta3N2C2− with C2H4. 
The computed PES for the reaction of Ta3N2C2− with C2H4, reaction (1b), is shown in Fig. 4. In the initial step, two C atoms of C2H4 coordinate to the Ta2 atom of the cluster to form intermediate I7, releasing an energy of −1.19 eV in this process. One C–Ta bond and one C–C bond are generated viaTS7, and the resulting intermediate I8 contains a four-membered Ta–C3–C4–C1 ring. After cleavage of the CC bond in the adsorbed C2H4 (I8 → TS8 → I9), the first hydrogen atom transfer from the CH2 unit to the C atom bonded with the Ta2 atomoccurs, thus generating a stable intermediate I10, the energy of which lies below that of the entrance channel by −3.09 eV. Subsequently, continuous HAT processes (I10 → TS10 → I11 → TS11 → I12) proceed, leading to the formation of a Ta3–H bond in I12. To form the dehydrogenation product Ta3N2C4H2−, intermediate I12 undergoes another HAT from the terminal CH2 unit to the C2 atom (I12 → TS12 → I13). Following structural adjustment via the transition state TS13, the second C–C bond forms in I14. Starting from I14, an H2 moiety finally generates (I14 → TS14 → I15), and is easily liberated. The overall process is exothermic by 0.71 eV.

The zero-point vibration corrected energies (ΔH0K in eV) of the reaction intermediates, transition states, and products with respect to the separated reactants are given. The superscripts indicate the spin states of species, and those without superscripts are triplet spin states. 
The reaction pathways of the singlet Ta3N2− and Ta3N2C2− with C2H4 have also been considered (Fig. S5, ESI†), and the singlet PESs are kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable than the triplet PESs. It is noteworthy that the mechanisms shown in this study are the most plausible pathways based on DFT calculations; however, there may exist other possibilities.

4. Discussion
4.1 Comparison with reported gas-phase cluster reactions
Ethene activation mediated with gas-phase species has been extensively studied, including a variety of transition metal atoms44–46 and transition metal oxide clusters24,26,47–53 which have been classified elsewhere,24 and a few other kinds of ions,23,54,55 such as YNH+,54 PtCH+, Pt2CH+,55 and Ni(NH2)+.23 Among these reported systems, liberation of one H2 molecule from one ethene molecule is common. The gas-phase trimerization of ethene is facilitated by atomic W+, U+ or the Fe4+ cluster accompanied by three dehydrogenation steps.45 It comes to be no surprise that due to the high oxidation state (VII), Re+ reacts with four C2H4 molecules, forming Re(C2H2)4+ and four H2.44 For YNH+ and Ni(NH2)+, both of the newly generated YC2H3N+54 and Ni(C2H4N)+23 from reactions with C2H4 molecules can react with another C2H4 to liberate one H2. Notably, in these reported systems, two C–H bonds of C2H4 are activated in each reaction, without the rupture of the CC bond. It is also worth mentioning that the total dehydrogenation of C6H6 mediated by Nbn− clusters was observed to be concomitant with the formation of carbides.56 In addition, the reactions of C2H4 with niobium neutral clusters larger than Nb3 lead to the formation of NbnC2.46 In this study we show that all of the bonds in a C2H4 molecule, that is four C–H bonds and one CC bond, can be broken efficiently by the Ta3N2− cluster anions resulting in the formation of the reactive Ta3N2C2− species and two dihydrogen molecules. In our model system Ta3N2−, the adsorbed carbon atoms originating from C2H4 are used to build another very reactive cluster Ta3N2C2−, in which the C atoms are bonded to the Ta atoms. The Ta3N2C2− cluster subsequently reacts with a second molecule of C2H4; as the tantalum centers achieve their full coordination numbers, the carbon atoms tend to aggregate by forming two C–C bonds in Ta3N2C4H2−. The neutral products are the dihydrogen molecules, and no free CO molecules are liberated. The reactions (1a) and (1b) not only show the high hydrogen production efficiency of Ta–N systems, but also exhibit, at a molecular level, how new active sites are produced in the course of reactions and then deactivated through the formation of carbon-containing species on clusters.
4.2 Properties of Ta3N2C2−
In the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), which is coupled with key clean energy systems like electrolytic/solar water splitting, transition metal-coordinating C/N materials57–59 are very promising catalysts. Although there is the debate about whether or not transition metal atoms (hereinafter M) are a part of the catalytic site, numerous studies indicate that catalytic sites with transition metal atoms could catalyze an OER.59–61 For instance, graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) with ultrahigh N content have been widely used as the host for metal species, and the outstanding electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activity originates from the interaction between the N-containing system and the M atoms.59,62 In addition, M–N–C molecules, for example, FeN2,4Cx63 and other Fe–N–C species,64 have been proposed to form active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Therefore, more attention should be paid to the nature of M–N–C species in order to have a clear picture of the structure–property relationship of this important reactive species. In gas-phase studies, such M–N–C species have not been identified before, to the best of our knowledge.
To explore more detailed properties of Ta3N2− and Ta3N2C2−, Wiberg bond order analysis, Table S2 (ESI†), has been performed. In Ta3N2−, the Wiberg bond indices between Ta1 and Ta2, Ta1 and Ta3, as well as Ta2 and Ta3 in Ta3N2− are 2.2, 1.6, and 0.8, respectively, implying the presence of two TaTa double bonds and one Ta–Ta single bond. These metal–metal bonds are broken during the reaction of Ta3N2− with C2H4, reflected by the small Wiberg bond indices in Ta3N2C2− (0.6, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively). All of the tantalum atoms in both Ta3N2− and Ta3N2C2− are with the highest possible valence state +5, and N and C atoms take −3 and −4 valence states, respectively. In the triplet Ta3N2C2−, the unpaired spin density is delocalized over three Ta atoms (0.53, 0.53, and 0.92 μB for Ta1, Ta2, and Ta3, respectively). The Ta2 and Ta3 atoms, with different chemical environments, are involved in the oxidation of C2H4. In detail, the Ta2 atom bonded with two C atoms and one N atom is the active site at the beginning of the reaction; then, the Ta3 atom bonded with two N atoms and one C atom acts as the reactive center for the formation of dihydrogen. As illustrated in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† the spin density plays an important role in the reaction of Ta3N2C2− with C2H4, and both of Ta2 and Ta3 atoms are with relatively low spin densities when they are adopted as active centers. The transition metal nitride ions investigated herein exhibit intriguing properties, suggesting that these kinds of clusters having received little attention are a potentially fruitful area for further research.
5. Conclusions
The reactions of Ta3N2− with C2H4 have been investigated by mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations. The Ta3N2− cluster can activate one ethene molecule efficiently, resulting in the formation of two dihydrogen molecules and Ta3N2C2−, and the newly formed Ta3N2C2− cluster is also reactive toward C2H4, releasing one H2 molecule. Therefore, three H2 molecules are liberated from two C2H4 molecules mediated by Ta3N2− at room temperature. The DFT calculations indicate that in addition to the activation of C–H bonds, the CC double bonds in ethene are also cleaved in these two reactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first to report the full dehydrogenation of C2H4 by gas-phase anions and the structure–reactivity relationship of M–N–C clusters, which may be one class of important reactive species for the catalysts applied in oxygen evolution/reduction reactions. This study not only extends our understanding of the properties of the rarely investigated tantalum nitride and M–N–C clusters in the gas phase, but also gives new insights into the design of active sites in related condensed-phase systems at a molecular level.

Table Content:
Ta3N2− + C2H4 → Ta3N2C2− + 2H2	(1a)
Ta3N2C2− + C2H4 → Ta3N2C4H2− + H2	(1b)
Ta3N2− + 2C2H4 → Ta3N2C4H2− + 3H2 (minor)	(2)

 	Fig. 1  TOF mass spectra for the reactions of mass-selected Ta3N2− (a), with C2H4 (b and c) for 3.1 ms. The effective reactant gas pressures are shown.	 

 	Fig. 2  Variations of the relative intensities of the reactant and product cluster ions in the reactions between Ta3N2− and C2H4 with respect to the C2H4 pressures. The solid lines are fitted to the experimental data points derived with the approximation of the pseudo-first-order reaction mechanism.	 

 	Fig. 3  DFT calculated potential-energy profile for the reactions of Ta3N2− with C2H4 in the triplet spin state. The insetted panel plots the structure of Ta3N2−, and Mulliken atomic spin densities over Ta atoms (in parentheses with a unit of μB) are given. The selected bond lengths are given in pm. The zero-point vibration corrected energies (ΔH0K in eV) of the reaction intermediates, transition states, and products with respect to the separated reactants are given. The superscripts indicate the spin states of species, and those without superscripts are triplet spin states.	 

 	Fig. 4  DFT calculated potential-energy profile for the reactions of Ta3N2C2− with C2H4. Selected bond lengths are given in pm. The zero-point vibration corrected energies (ΔH0K in eV) of the reaction intermediates, transition states, and products with respect to the separated reactants are given. The superscripts indicate the spin states of species, and those without superscripts are triplet spin states.
