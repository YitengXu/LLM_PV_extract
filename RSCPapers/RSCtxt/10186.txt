    , Accepted 30th May 2013First published on 31st May 2013AbstractMetal-free dyes (Ant1 to Ant4) containing a 2,6-conjugated anthracene unit in the spacer have been synthesized. The conversion efficiency (7.52%) of the dye-sensitized solar cell using Ant3 as the sensitizer reached ∼90% of the standard N719-based cell (8.41%). The co-sensitized DSSC using Ant3 and a near-IR dye (SQ2) exhibited an improved efficiency of 8.08%. With addition of a co-adsorbent, CDCA, the cell efficiency (9.11%) of the Ant3-based DSSC surpassed that of the N719-based standard cell. An even higher efficiency of 10.42% was achieved under weak light irradiation.

Broader context
Developing new energy sources is of paramount importance due to limited natural resources and serious global greenhouse effects. Solar energy has been deemed as a very promising sustainable alternative to fossil fuels among new energy resources. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention after Grätzel's seminal report. Development of more efficient sensitizers definitely will be beneficial to speed up the commercialization of DSSCs. The research presented in this paper introduces a simple design of 2,6-conjugated anthracene-based dipolar organic compounds which can be used as sensitizers for DSSCs. The best cell efficiency (7.52%) under one sun (AM 1.5) irradiation reached 90% of the N719-based cell (8.41%) fabricated and measured under similar conditions. With the use of CDCA as a co-adsorbent, the cell efficiency was improved to 9.11%, which surpassed the N719-based standard cell. An even higher efficiency (10.42%) was achieved under 0.25 sun irradiation. It is believed that better performance can be achieved with an appropriate choice of co-sensitizers/co-adsorbents.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received considerable attention in the past decade. The seminal report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 demonstrated that DSSCs could convert solar energy to electricity efficiently.1 Grätzel-type DSSCs comprise nano-crystalline anatase TiO2 porous film photoanodes adsorbed with a Ru-complex as the sensitizer, an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple as the electrolyte, and a conductive glass coated with platinum as the cathode. Until now, high light to power conversion efficiencies surpassing 10% have been achieved with polypyridyl Ru(II) complex-based DSSCs using an AM 1.5 solar simulator.2 However, the Ru-based dyes are expensive and environmentally hazardous. Compared to the Ru dyes, metal-free organic dyes have several advantages: (1) they have higher molar extinction coefficients; (2) they are of lower cost and more flexible in molecular design. As such, metal-free dyes are also deemed promising for applications in DSSCs, and various organic dyes have been used as the sensitizers of DSSCs.2c,3
Anthracene derivatives have been widely used in blue-emitting organic light-emitting diodes,4 thin film transistors5 and bulk heterojunction solar cells.6 However, DSSCs using anthracene-based sensitizers are rare. In 2009, Giribabu et al. synthesized anthracene-based dyes, 3-(anthracene-9-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid and 2-(anthracene-9-ylmethylene) malonic acid, and the cell efficiencies were lower than 0.1%.7a Sun et al. designed a series of sensitizers in which an anthracene entity was incorporated into the conjugated spacer between electron-donating triphenylamine and electron-accepting 2-cyanoacrylic acid. The best power conversion efficiency reached 7.03%. However, the efficiencies only reached ∼3% if no alkene or alkyne entity was inserted between the anthracene unit and the neighboring aromatic rings.7b Thomas et al. synthesized 2,6-di-tert-butylanthracene-based dyes which exhibited only moderate cell efficiencies.7c Grätzel et al. explored the dyes using a 10-(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)anthracene unit as the donor group and two cyanoacrylic acid units as the accepting/anchoring groups. The best cell efficiency was reported to be 3.7%.7d
All of the aforementioned anthracene-based sensitizers have the neighboring conjugated segments linked to the C9 and C10 sites. Compared to a 1,4-disubstituted benzene entity, the 9,10-disubsituted anthracene entity allows better charge transfer due to its higher tendency to form a quinoid structure.8 However, the four hydrogen atoms at the C1, C2, C5 and C8 sites will induce severe steric congestion between the anthracene core and the typical aromatic rings, which may hamper effective charge transfer. Therefore, we set out to develop dyes with a 2,6-conjugated anthracene segment as the conjugated spacer which incorporated 9,10-bishexyloxyanthracene-phenylamine as the donor and cyanoacrylic acid as the accepting/anchoring group based on the following reasons: (1) 2,6-disubsituted anthracene is less sterically congested compared to 9,10-disubstituted anthracene; (2) alkoxy chains can be introduced at C9 and C10 positions which potentially could not only improve the solubility of the dyes in common organic solvents but also suppress the dark current and/or avoid dye aggregation; and (3) the anthracene moiety is electron rich and may function as the second electron donor.
Experimental
Materials and instrumentation
All solvents used were purified by standard procedures, or purged with nitrogen before use. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 and AMX-400 spectrometer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Dynamica DB-20 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. All chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (60 M, 230–400 mesh). Mass spectra (FAB) were recorded on a VG70-250S mass spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer.
Cell fabrication of DSSCs
For the DSSCs, the TiO2 film consists of a transparent layer and a scattering layer with thicknesses of 15 and 5 μm, respectively, as measured by a profilometer (Dektak3, Veeco/Sloan Instruments Inc., USA). The TiO2 electrode with a 0.16 cm2 geometric area was immersed in a THF solution containing 3 × 10−4 M organic sensitizers or in an acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1 by vol.) solution containing cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719, Solaronix S.A., Switzerland) (3 × 10−4 M) overnight. For the co-sensitized solar cells, the TiO2 film was immersed in an acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1) solution of Ant3 (3 × 10−4 M) for 12 h, and then transferred to an acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1) solution of SQ2 (3 × 10−4 M) dye for 2 h. For the co-adsorbed solar cells, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was added into the dye solutions at a concentration of 10 mM. A platinized FTO was used as a counter electrode and was controlled to have an active area of 0.16 cm2 by adhered polyester tape with a thickness of 60 μm. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI), 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuSCN) dissolved in an acetonitrile (ACN)/3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) mixture (1:1 by vol.). The photoelectrochemical characterizations of the solar cells were carried out by using an Oriel Class A solar simulator (Oriel 91195A, Newport Corp.).
Characterization of DSSCs
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat–galvanostat (CHI650B, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) at a light intensity of 1.0 sun calibrated by an Oriel reference solar cell (Oriel 91150, Newport Corp.). Incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained under short-circuit conditions. The light source was a class A quality solar simulator (PEC–L11, AM 1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.); light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) on the photovoltaic cell and measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Quantum chemistry computation
The structures of the molecules were optimized using B3LYP/6-31G*. For each molecule, a number of possible conformations were examined and the one with the lowest energy was used. For the excited state, we employed the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the B3LYP functional. All of them were performed with Q-Chem 4.0 software.9 There exist a number of previous studies that employed TDDFT to characterize excited states with charge-transfer character.10 In some cases underestimation of the excitation energies was observed.10,11 Therefore, in the present work, we use TDDFT to characterize the extent of the charge-shift and avoid drawing conclusions from the excitation energy.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the materials
The structures of the new anthracene-based organic dyes are shown in Fig. 1, and the main synthetic pathways are depicted in Scheme 1.
 Fig. 1  Structure of the dyes. 
 Scheme 1  Synthetic pathways of the Ant dyes. 
Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared according to the published procedures.12Ant1 was synthesized from the reaction of the 2,2′-bithiophenestannyl reagent with an aromatic monohalide derived from anthracene via a palladium-catalyzed C–C cross-coupling reaction. A subsequent Vilsmeier–Haack reaction resulted in formation of the aldehyde intermediate, which was converted to the desired product by a Knoevenagel reaction with cyanoacetic acid. For the syntheses of Ant2 to Ant4, 2-dibromo-9,10-bis(hexyloxy)anthracene underwent sequential C–N coupling reactions with aniline and 2,6-dibromo-9,10-bis(hexyloxy)anthracene, respectively, to afford 8. Compound 8 can be converted to an aldehyde derivative by either a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction or transformation to boronic ester followed by Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with 5-bromo-2-thiophene carboxaldehyde or 5-bromo-2-furaldehyde. The final products were obtained via a Knoevenagel condensation of the aldehyde with cyanoacetic acid. The new organic dyes were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses, and mass spectrometry.
Optical properties
The absorption spectra of the dyes recorded in THF have two major absorption bands in the range of 330–600 nm (Fig. 2a). The band below 400 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated molecules. The band in the longer wavelength region (480–600 nm) is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition with π–π* transition character. The λabs values of the dyes in THF are in the order of Ant3 (490 nm) > Ant2 (480 nm) = Ant4 (480 nm) > Ant1 (455 nm). The shortest absorption wavelength of Ant1 among all can be attributed to the absence of a stronger electron-donating arylamine though the anthracene entity also functions as an electron donor (vide infra). The absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 extend beyond 650 nm, indicating significant J-aggregation of the dyes.13Ant3 exhibits the broadest and the most intense absorption spectra.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) methods were used to investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the dyes. The relevant electrochemical data are presented in Table 1 and the representative cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. S1.† All of the dyes exhibit two quasi-reversible oxidation waves except for Ant1 which has only one oxidation wave. The first oxidation wave in Ant2 to Ant4 is attributed to the removal of an electron from the arylamine segment, and is at a lower potential compared to the oxidation wave of Ant1 due to the oxidation of the anthracene entity. The oxidation of arylamine in Ant3 or Ant4 is at a lower potential compared to Ant2, which can be attributed to the presence of electron excessive thiophene or furan in the former. The excited state potential (E0–0*, −1.18 to −1.31 V vs. NHE), estimated from the difference of the first oxidation potential at the ground state and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) of the dyes, is more negative than the conduction-band-edge energy level of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs. NHE),2c ensuring that there is enough driving force for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. The first oxidation potential of the dyes is more positive than that of the I−/I3− redox couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that regeneration of the oxidized dyes (1.11 to 1.28 V vs. NHE) is energetically favorable.

Theoretical approach
In order to gain insight into the correlation between the geometrical and electronic properties of the Ant dyes, we performed quantum chemistry computation on the organic sensitizers. The results of the theoretical computation are summarized in Table S1.†
Selected frontier orbitals of the dyes are shown in Fig. S2.† In the optimized structure, the dihedral angle between the anthracene entity and the neighboring heteroaromatic ring (Fig. 3) ranges from 2.3 to 25.5°, which is significantly smaller than those in 9,10-substituted anthracene derivatives.7 Another interesting feature of the Ant dyes is that the bridged anthracene entity can serve as the second electron donor, which should be beneficial to electron injection. The Mulliken charges for the S1 and S2 states were calculated as a projection from the TDDFT results. Differences in the Mulliken charges between the excited state and the ground state were calculated and grouped into several segments (Fig. 3), diarylamino (AntN), anthracene (Ant), thiophene rings (T1, T2, and T), furan (F) and 2-cyanoacrylic acid (Ac), to estimate the extent of charge separation upon excitation (Fig. 4). Both S0 → S1 (mainly HOMO → LUMO transition) and S0 → S2 (mainly HOMO-1 → LUMO transition) transitions have moderate oscillator strength (f) and prominent charge transfer character from the arylamine or the conjugated spacer to the 2-cyanoacrylic acceptor. The potential of anthracene as an electron donor is evident from the S1 transition of Ant1 where the anthracene entity has a very high positive Mulliken charge. The peripheral anthracene makes an important contribution to the HOMO and thus to the electron-donating power of the arylamine in Ant2 to Ant4. It is interesting to note that the bridged anthracene entity functions as a prominent electron donor in the S2 transition as it was linked to a thiophene or furan (Ant3 or Ant4). In contrast, the bridged anthracene entity mainly functions as the electron acceptor in Ant2.

Photovoltaic devices
The photovoltaic performance statistics under one sun (AM 1.5) illumination are collected in Table 2. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the cells are plotted in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. All the devices exhibited good power conversion efficiencies ranging from 4.69 to 7.52%. The lower JSC of Ant1 compared to Ant2 to Ant4 can be attributed to several reasons: (1) the absorption cut-off of Ant1 appears at a shorter wavelength than those of the others; (2) Ant1 has a lower adsorbed dye density than the other dyes; (3) the cell of Ant1 is the least efficient in dark current suppression (vide infra). The cell of Ant3 has significantly higher VOC than that of Ant2 or Ant4, which is consistent with its more effective suppression of the dark current and more efficient electron transport based on electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements (vide infra). Interestingly, the more planar spacer of Ant4 (than Ant3) results in less effective dark current suppression. Similar behavior was also reported by other groups.14 The dark currents and the EIS of DSSCs in the dark are shown in Fig. 5a and 6a, respectively. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. The resistance towards the dark current (the size of the semicircle) decreases in the order of Ant3 > Ant4 > Ant2 > Ant1, which is opposite to the order of the dark current (Fig. 5a) and the observed VOC values (Table 2). Electrochemical impedance upon illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was also measured under open-circuit conditions, and the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with different dyes are shown in Fig. 6b. The radius of the intermediate frequency semicircle (10−2 to 105 Hz) in the Nyquist plot will reflect electron transport resistance, and a smaller radius means lower electron transport resistance. The electron transport resistance decreases in the order of Ant1 > Ant2 ≈ Ant4 > Ant3.

The electron injection rate will compete with the charge recombination rate under open-circuit conditions. VOC is therefore influenced by the electron injection rate, charge recombination, and conduction band edge (EC). Wang's approach was applied in this study for further insight.15Fig. 7 shows the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct) from EIS measurements as a function of potential bias. The EC of TiO2 in the cell was then calculated from the intercept of the linear fitting. The EC with Ant3 is moved downward by 73, 7, and 12 mV compared to that with Ant1, Ant2, and Ant4, respectively. A significant downward shift of EC with Ant1 likely stems from its different inherent structure from others. Both the slower charge recombination rate (Fig. 6a) and negative shift of the EC can contribute to the VOC increment of Ant3.

Co-sensitized and co-adsorbed DSSCs
Though the best cell efficiency of Ant3 dye reaches ∼90% of the N719-based DSSCs, the lack of absorption at wavelength >650 nm limits the overall performance. A co-sensitized approach with the use of a near-IR (NIR) dye, SQ2, was therefore tested. Co-sensitized DSSCs using dyes absorbing in complementary spectral regions are considered promising, as current density and hence cell efficiency can be increased significantly. For example, the record high performance (12.3%) of co-sensitized DSSCs was reported by Yella et al. using two metal-containing porphyrin dyes (YD2-o-C8 and Y123) and a Co(II/III)-based redox electrolyte.16a Nazeeruddin and Torres employed different NIR dyes (TT1 and SQ1) as the co-sensitizers of JK2.16b,c The IPCE spectra extended to 700 nm and an efficiency of over 7% was reached. A metal-free sensitizer containing a 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene unit in the spacer (BP-2) developed by us was also successfully fabricated as a co-sensitized DSSC with SQ2 as the co-sensitizer, and a high efficiency of 8.14% was achieved.16d
The J–V curves for Ant3/SQ2 co-sensitized cells under the AM 1.5 conditions are shown in Fig. 8a, and the performance parameters are collected in Table 2. The JSC was increased to 18.01 mA cm−2 due to the broadened absorption of Ant3/SQ2, as evidenced from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 8b), which extended to ∼800 nm. The efficiency of the co-sensitized DSSCs reached 8.08%, which was a ∼0.5% increment compared to the cell of Ant3, or a ∼5.3% increment compared to the cell of SQ2. As there has been significant dye aggregation on the surface of TiO2, a widely used antiaggregant co-adsorbent, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA),17 was also applied in the Ant3-based DSSCs. An impressively high cell performance surpassing that of N719 (8.41%) was achieved: η, 9.11%; JSC, 18.44 mA cm−2; VOC, 0.74 V; FF = 0.66 (Table 2). Dye aggregation normally results in quenching of the excited state and is known to jeopardize the electron injection. Obviously, addition of CDCA hampers dye aggregation and improves both JSC and VOC significantly. Suppression of dye aggregation was also supported by the blue shift of the absorption spectra of Ant3 on the TiO2 film when CDCA was added (inset of Fig. 8b). The cell efficiency can be further increased up to 10.42% at an illumination power of 25 mW cm−2. Cell performance parameters measured under different illumination powers are shown in Table 3, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 9.

J–V curves of Ant3/CDCA co-adsorbed cells under different light intensities. 
It is interesting to note that the efficiencies of the cells in this study are much higher than those using 9,10-conjugated sensitizers if no alkene or alkyne entity is inserted between the anthracene unit and the neighboring aromatic rings7b,c due to the better light harvesting efficiencies of the Ant dyes. The skeleton of Ant3 dyes is similar to the fluorene-based dye ((E)-2-cyano-3(5-(7-(diphenylamino)-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl) acrylic acid)18a we reported earlier, which exhibited similar cell efficiencies. However, addition of CDCA to the fluorene dye resulted in only marginal improvement of the cell efficiency (∼0.80% increment). This shows the delicate balance between the dye density and dye deaggregation when co-adsorbents are used. In addition to the 9,10-bishexyloxyanthracene entity in the conjugated spacer, the peripheral 9,10-bishexyloxyanthracene entity at the nitrogen atom is believed to also play an important role in the high performance of the cells. Replacement of the 9,10-bishexyloxyanthracene entity with a phenyl ring (An-1)18b leads to blue shift of the absorption. Removal of the hexyloxy chains (An-4)18b results in significant dye aggregation and charge recombination (dark current). The efficiencies of DSSCs based on An-1 and An-4 only reached <60% of the N719-based standard DSSC fabricated and measured under the same conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized metal-free organic dipolar sensitizers containing 2,6-conjugated 9,10-bishexyloxyanthracene between the donor and the acceptor. The anthracene entity also functions as the electron donor in addition to the arylamine. DSSCs using these sensitizers exhibited efficiencies of 4.69–7.52% under AM 1.5 illumination, and the best performance of the cells reached ∼90% of the N719-based cell (8.41%) fabricated and measured under similar conditions. The efficiency of the best cell can be improved to 8.08% in co-sensitized DSSCs using a NIR dye as the co-sensitizer. An impressively high efficiency (9.11%) surpassing the N719-based cell has also been achieved with the use of CDCA as a co-adsorbent. Under weak light irradiation, the efficiency can be further increased to 10.42%.

Broader context
Developing new energy sources is of paramount importance due to limited natural resources and serious global greenhouse effects. Solar energy has been deemed as a very promising sustainable alternative to fossil fuels among new energy resources. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention after Grätzel's seminal report. Development of more efficient sensitizers definitely will be beneficial to speed up the commercialization of DSSCs. The research presented in this paper introduces a simple design of 2,6-conjugated anthracene-based dipolar organic compounds which can be used as sensitizers for DSSCs. The best cell efficiency (7.52%) under one sun (AM 1.5) irradiation reached 90% of the N719-based cell (8.41%) fabricated and measured under similar conditions. With the use of CDCA as a co-adsorbent, the cell efficiency was improved to 9.11%, which surpassed the N719-based standard cell. An even higher efficiency (10.42%) was achieved under 0.25 sun irradiation. It is believed that better performance can be achieved with an appropriate choice of co-sensitizers/co-adsorbents.
