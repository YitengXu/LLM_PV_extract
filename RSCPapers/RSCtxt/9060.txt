    , Accepted 5th January 2016First published on 21st January 2016AbstractWe demonstrate low threshold lasing oscillation in a photonic crystal (PhC) laser by using tert-butyl Rhodamine B (t-Bu-RhB) doped gain media. Lactonic t-Bu-RhB is synthesized to improve doping concentration in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) films, and then isomerized to the zwitterion form to achieve highly fluorescent gain medium. The t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film is sandwiched by a pair of polystyrene colloidal crystals to construct a PhC resonating cavity. Single-mode laser oscillation at 592 nm is observed when the PhC resonating cavity is pumped by a Nd:YAG laser. The lasing threshold is 0.12 MW cm−2 utilizing 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films, which is only 1/60 of that with 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. The concentration-dependent lasing action is attributed to different gain factors of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. Furthermore, a spatially and spectrally coherent laser beam from the PhC resonating cavity is verified by exploring the far-field image and angular dependence of the lasing emission. The approach provides a facile and efficient strategy to reduce the lasing threshold for fabricating low threshold PhC lasers.
Introduction
Photonic crystals (PhCs) are periodic materials with refractive indices varying on the order of optical wavelength.1,2 Due to the Bragg diffraction of light in PhCs, photons with a specific range of energies cannot propagate along certain directions, resulting in the formation of a photonic bandgap (PBG).3 Considering the modulation of light owing to the PBG effects, PhCs hold promise for numerous applications, such as waveguides, displays, microchips, protein detection, solar cells, sensors and lasers.4–11 Among these applications, low-threshold lasers are especially attractive and versatile. The control of spontaneous emission by PhCs would facilitate more photons to be coupled into certain optical modes, resulting in the gain enhancement and lasing oscillation in PhC optical cavity devices. Recently, low threshold lasers have been successfully realized using one-, two- and three-dimensional (3D) PhCs.12–15
Compared to 1D and 2D PhCs, 3D PhCs are expected to control spontaneous emission in three directions, which renders them appropriate scaffolds to fabricate low threshold lasers. While 3D PhCs have been fabricated by various methods, colloidal crystals (CCs) are attractive to make 3D PhCs, since they can be easily prepared and their PBG can be tuned in the UV-Vis-IR range.16,17 Although only a pseudo-PBG exists in CCs, a distinct L-point gap in CCs can prevent light propagation in the (111) direction and manipulate the spontaneous emission of light emitters.18–21 It has been demonstrated that utilizing PBG effects of CCs to enhance the optical gain of light emitters could facilitate the fabrication of low-threshold lasers.22–27 Despite the fact that much effort has been devoted to optimizing the resonating cavity,28–30 few work has been directed towards improving the gain media in CC lasers.31
Gain media are of great importance in performing low threshold lasing oscillation. Many types of gain media, which exhibit high laser efficiency and good performance, have been reported over the past few decades.32–37 Among these gain media, dye-doped polymer films are appealing due to their low cost, non-toxic, broad and continuous tunability within the visible range, and highly efficient laser actions.38 To compensate for the inevitable and irreversible loss of dye molecules as a consequence of photo deconstruction, high dye doping concentration is of great value in realizing high-performance laser action and reducing lasing threshold. However, the dye concentration has to be kept at a low level of 1–2 wt% in the host/guest polymer system to achieve high optical gain due to the possible self-aggregation and photoluminescence (PL) quenching of dye molecules at higher concentration in polymers.25,39 Recently, intensive efforts have been devoted to increase the dye concentration in the matrix while restraining the dye molecules from concentration quenching. Takezoe and co-authors introduced long alkyl chains into dye molecules to improve the solubility of the dyes in liquid crystal polymers, and prevented the dye from concentration quenching by means of large steric hindrance.40 Duan and co-authors paid attention to employing dendrimers to encapsulating organic dyes into polymers to enhance the solubility and obtain lasing oscillation.23,41 Nevertheless, few studies have been focused on the development of novel dye molecules.
In this study, we demonstrate an approach to effectively increase Rhodamine B (RhB) derivative concentration in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) films, and significantly lower the lasing threshold of the RhB derivative doped film in the PhC resonating cavity. tert-Butyl modified RhB (t-Bu-RhB) has been synthesized by introducing a tert-butyl group into the lactone form (L-form) RhB. The t-Bu-RhB molecules (L-form) exhibit good solubility in PMMA and become nonplanar, which not only increases the dye concentration in PMMA, but also suppresses the aggregation of dye molecules. Using the isomerization effect, the L-form RhB doped in PMMA is transformed into the fluorescent zwitterion form (Z-form) RhB. Based on this method, we successfully improved the doping concentration of t-Bu-RhB in PMMA up to 6.9 wt% without evident fluorescence quenching. Subsequently, we fabricated the PhC resonating cavity using t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films and polystyrene (PS) CCs. Lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity was as low as 0.12 MW cm−2 with the gain medium doped with 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB, which was only 1/60 of that with 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB. Single-mode laser emission with a Gaussian intensity profile verified the high quality of the PhC resonating cavity. The strategy proposed here would provide a simple and effective methodology to develop highly efficient polymeric gain media for fabricating low-threshold PhC lasers.
Experimental
Materials
Benzil (Aldrich), deuterochloroform (CDCl3, J&K Chemical), 2-benzyl-2-(dimethylamino)-4′-morpholinobutyrophenono (Aldrich), pentaerythritoltriacrylate (PE-3A, Kyoeisha Chemical Co. Ltd), and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O), methyl methacrylate (MMA), Rhodamine B (RhB), methanol (CH3OH), anhydrous sodium sulfate (MgSO4), tert-butyl bromine (t-Bu-Br), silica (SiO2), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), petroleum ether, styrene (St), sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), potassium persulfate (K2S2O4), ethyl acetate (C4H8CO2), sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen dioxide (H2O2) were analytical reagents and purchased from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company. Styrene was purified by distillation under induced pressure and stored in a refrigerator. K2S2O4 was recrystallized twice and dried overnight in a vacuum oven. CH2Cl2 was dried over CaH2 and freshly distilled before use. All other reagents were used without purification.
Synthesis of the lactone form t-Bu-RhB
The lactone form tert-butyl RhB was synthesized by adding a sterically hindered tert-butyl group onto the L-form RhB via Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction (Scheme 1).42,43 Hydrazine hydrate (0.5 mL, 10 mmol) was added to a RhB (0.4000 g, 0.8 mmol) solution in methanol (15 mL). The resulting reaction solution was allowed to reflux until the pink color disappeared.

Subsequently, the cooled reaction solution was poured into deionized water and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL × 3). The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and then concentrated to give the crude product as RhB hydrazide. tert-Butyl bromine (2.28 mL, 20 mmol) was added to a suspension of RhB hydrazide (0.9132 g) and SiO2 (1.500 g) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 24 hours. After cooling down to room temperature, SiO2 was filtrated off and washed with CHCl3 (10 mL × 3). The organic phase was combined and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and petroleum ether (v/v = 1:5) as an eluent.

Preparation of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films
The t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films were prepared by UV irradiation of the t-Bu-RhB doped photoresist. The photoresist was obtained by doping the L-form t-Bu-RhB in the mixture of benzil, MMA, PE-3A, and 2-benzyl-2-(dimethylamino)-4′-morpholinobutyrophenono (ESI,† Fig. S2 and Table S1). To achieve an appropriate thickness, a parafilm was sandwiched by two glass slides to form a room, in which the photoresist containing t-Bu-RhB was injected. Then, light yellow-colour transparent films were obtained after irradiation of the photoresist using a high-voltage mercury lamp (power: 32.5 mW cm−2, wavelength: 300–400 nm) for 3 min. Finally, the films were kept in a glass container, which contained 5.0 mL HCl (12.4 mol L−1). One hour later, the films turned pink, and Z-form t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films were obtained.
Preparation of the PhC resonating cavity
The PhC resonating cavity was prepared by three steps: first, monodisperse PS microspheres with the size of 265 nm were synthesized following emulsion polymerization (ESI†).44 Second, PS CCs were grown on glass substrates by the vertical deposition technique (ESI†).45 Finally, the PhC resonating cavity was fabricated by sandwiching the t-Bu-RhB (Z form) doped PMMA film with a pair of PS CCs.
Measurements
The absorption and transmission spectra were performed on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. Reflectivity spectra were performed on a Hitachi Model U-4100 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was recorded using a Hitachi S-4300 scanning electron microscope. The 1H NMR spectra of t-Bu-RhB in CDCl3 were recorded on a Bruker Avance Π-400 instrument using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. A high-resolution mass spectrum was measured using a Waters GCT Premier Spectrometer.
Gain factors of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films were evaluated using a 532 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser as a pumping source. The incident intensity was controlled by a neutral-density filter and measured using an energy meter. An adjustable slit and a cylindrical lens were used to shape the beam into a stripe with a width of 1 mm and a length that could be varied. In order to ensure that the intensity of the stripe was uniform along its length, an adjustable slit is used to select the central portion of the laser beam and the stripe length is of 1 mm or less. The t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films were pumped at normal incidence with the long axis of the pump beam perpendicular to the edge of the sample. The emission spectra were detected using a fiber-coupled grating spectrometer (USB2000, Ocean Optics).
Lasing properties of the PhC resonating cavity were explored using an optical pump with a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (Quanta-Ray, Spectra Physics) operating at 532 nm. The pulse width and repetition rate were 8 ns and 10 Hz, respectively. The pumping laser beam was focused onto the sample with a lens of 15 cm focal length and at an incidence angle of 45° from the normal to the sample surface. The input beam intensity was controlled by using a set of circular variable attenuators, and measured using an energy meter (Newport Optical Power Meter, Model 1916-R). The emitted light was collected in a direction perpendicular to the sample surface, and detected by an optical fiber coupled to the spectrometer (USB2000, Ocean Optics). The image of the lasing emission from the PhC resonating cavity was recorded using an Apple iPhone 4S camera. Angle-resolved emission spectra were measured on a home-made experimental setup (ESI,† Fig. S3). The excitation light source was a 530 nm femtosecond laser beam produced by an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-C). The pulse duration and repetition rate were 140 fs and 4 Hz, respectively. The pump beam was focused on the sample surface at an incident angle of 30°. The PhC resonating cavity was mounted on a rotating stage, which allowed emission spectra to be measured at different detection angles. The emission spectra were collected using a Reflective Microscope objective lens (20×, NA0.35, SIGMA KOKI OBLR-20A) and sent through a bundled optical fiber connected to an Omni-λ 300 monochromator (Zolix, 0.01 nm resolution) and the spectra were then detected using a linear array CCD (AmesD7222, Series, Scientific, 200–1100 nm) mounted on the monochromator.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films
To achieve a polymeric gain medium doped with RhB at high concentration, the isomerization between different forms of RhB could give us some hints. In our previous study,46 we found that the isomeric structure of RhB molecules could be transformed with the increasing concentration of dendrimers even in dilute solution, which led to the colour fading of the pink solution. This phenomenon results from the isomerization of the two forms of RhB.47 The isomer with pink colour is the zwitterion form and the colourless one is the lactone structure. The two isomers show distinctly different solubility in various solvents, which encourages us to develop a new method to achieve RhB doped polymers with high RhB doping concentration. The strategy includes three important issues: (1) modify the RhB molecule with the bulky tert-butyl group to increase the solubility in the polymer, as well as suppress the aggregation of RhB molecules by making them nonplanar,48 (2) utilize the conformation conversion between the pink Z-form and the colourless L-form of t-Bu-RhB to increase the dye doping concentration in the polymer while retaining the fluorescent emission property of RhB,49 and (3) isolate t-Bu-RhB molecules in three-dimensional polymeric networks to control the dye molecular migration, reducing the possibility of self-aggregation and consequent fluorescence quenching.
The synthesized procedure of the L-form isomer of t-Bu-RhB is presented in Scheme 1, as described in the Experimental section. The resultant t-Bu-RhB was readily soluble in commonly used organic solvents such as chloroform because of the L-form and tert-butyl group. When hydrochloric acid was added, the t-Bu-RhB (L-form) chloroform solution changed from colourless to pink, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The absorption and PL spectra of t-Bu-RhB in CHCl3 showed that the t-Bu-RhB chloroform solution exhibited much higher absorbance and PL intensity after the acid treatment (Fig. 1(b)). The change in colour and spectra of the t-Bu-RhB solution was attributed to the conformation transfer of t-Bu-RhB from the L form to the Z form, which is illustrated in Fig. 1(c).

(c) Scheme of the conformation change of t-Bu-RhB from the L-form to the Z-form under acid conditions. 
Furthermore, t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films with different dye doping concentrations were prepared. The components of the photoresists are summarized in Table 1. The concentration of t-Bu-RhB doped in the photoresists is increased to 10 wt%, which is much higher than that of 1 wt% for traditional dye doped polymer systems.50 After solidification of the photoresists under the irradiation of a mercury lamp, we obtained transparent t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. The thicknesses of the films with different dye concentrations were about 11 μm (ESI,† Fig. S4). Fig. 2(a) shows that the emission light of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film under UV irradiation changed from blue to orange after acid treatment, indicating the isomerization of t-Bu-RhB molecules from the L-form to the Z-form.

(c) The dependence of absorbance and photoluminescence intensity on the concentration of t-Bu-RhB for t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. The lines are a guide to the eye. 
Finally, the optical properties of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films after acid treatment were investigated to explore the fluorescent performance of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. The UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra of 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films after isomerization are shown in Fig. 2(b). The t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film showed the absorption and PL peaks at 565 nm and 592 nm, respectively. With the increase of the t-Bu-RhB concentration from 1 wt% to 6.9 wt%, the absorbance and PL intensities of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films increased monotonously, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In addition, the PL spectrum feature of the 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film is almost identical to that of the 1 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film (ESI,† Fig. S5), indicating negligible aggregation effect for the t-Bu-RhB doped film at a dye concentration up to 6.9 wt%. However, self-aggregation of t-Bu-RhB in the PMMA film was observed for higher doping concentration of 10 wt%, which was proved by the dramatic decrease of PL intensity as well as the appearance of a red-shifted shoulder peak on the PL spectrum (Fig. 2(c), Table 1; ESI,† Fig. S5). The investigation on photoluminescence lifetimes of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films further corroborated that self-aggregation of dye molecules occurred in the 10 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film, since two lifetimes were only obtained in this sample (Table 1, ESI,† Fig. S6). It is known that the decay of RhB emission in homogeneous media is monoexponential, so the shorter lifetime could be attributed to the strong π–π molecular interaction of the t-Bu-RhB aggregates.51 The PL spectra and decay dynamics clearly demonstrated that the concentration of t-Bu-RhB in PMMA could be significantly improved, while the self-aggregation of t-Bu-RhB with concentration below 6.9 wt% could be effectively suppressed.
Optical gain of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films
The optical gain feature of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films was evaluated. The net optical gain of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA was measured using the variable stripe length method.52 ASE intensities of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films as a function of the excitation length at 32.3 MW cm−2 pump intensity are plotted in Fig. 3. The output intensity from the stripe could be described by eqn (1): (1)where g is the gain factor in cm−1, l is the stripe length in cm, IP is the ASE peak intensity, and A is the spontaneous emission efficient. Gain factors of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films could be extracted from the fit of the experimental data to eqn (1), as shown in the curves in Fig. 3. The gain factors were calculated to be 2.46, 6.63, 15.90, and 10.13 cm−1 for a t-Bu-RhB concentration of 3, 5, 6.9, and 10 wt%, respectively. The results are similar to gain factors measured for high concentration RhB solution by dienes.53 Note that the gain factor reached the highest at a t-Bu-RhB concentration of 6.9 wt% instead of 10 wt%, indicating that self-aggregation and fluorescence quenching reduced the gain factor of the 10 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film. The highly luminescent t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films with optimized gain factors were prospective for the development of low threshold PhC lasers.

Characterization of PS CCs and construction of the PhC resonating cavity
In order to investigate the effect of t-Bu-RhB concentration on lowering the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity, the PMMA films doped with different concentrations of t-Bu-RhB were selected as gain media to construct the resonating cavity, as described in our previous work.54 In the PhC resonating cavity, PS CCs act as mirrors and reflect the emission light of the gain medium, resulting in the feedback and lasing oscillation.22,27 The matching of the PL band of the gain medium and the PBG of the CC is necessary for the build-up of the lasing oscillation. The PBG of the PS CCs comes from the Bragg diffraction of the periodic arrangement of PS microparticles, which was confirmed by the SEM image shown in Fig. 4(a). The SEM image illustrated that monodisperse PS microparticles were about 265 nm and packed in a face-centered-cubic lattice. In Fig. 4(b), the PS CC displayed the reflection band at 592 nm with the maximum reflectivity of about 83%, and the transmission attenuation at 595 nm with the lowest transmission of 3.79%, indicating the emergence of the PBG of the CC at around 592 nm. It is obvious that the PBG of the PS CC overlaps with the PL band of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. As a result, it is predictable that lasing emission can be efficiently generated by the feedback effect of the PhC resonating cavity. We constructed the PhC resonating cavity by using t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films with different t-Bu-RhB concentrations to study the influence of the dye molecule concentration on the lasing performance of the PhC resonating cavity, which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 4(c). The PhC resonating cavity is characterized by evaluating the transmission spectrum, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).

Lasing action of the PhC resonating cavity
Lasing action of the PhC resonating cavity was characterized to investigate the dependence of the lasing performance on the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. The emission spectra of the PhC resonating cavity were collected under optical pumping by a focused laser beam operating at 532 nm from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Fig. 5(a) presents the emission spectra of the PhC resonating cavities constructed by the gain media with a t-Bu-RhB concentration of 1 and 3 wt%, respectively. For the PhC resonating cavity with 1 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films, there was an obvious drop at around 600 nm on the emission spectrum, which was attributed to the inhibition of the emitted light by the PBG filtering effect of the CCs.55 Upon further increasing the t-Bu-RhB concentration to 3 wt%, a narrow emission peak at 592 nm emerged and dominated the emission spectrum, which implied the appearance of lasing oscillation in the PhC resonating cavity. The emission spectrum of 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films without the PhC resonating cavity was also plotted as a control, in which lasing emission was not observed under identical pump intensity (Fig. 5(a)).
 Fig. 5  (a) Emission spectra of the PhC resonating cavities with 1 and 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films under optical pumping. The PL spectrum of 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA and the reflection spectrum of PS colloidal crystals were also plotted. The pump energy is 10.06 MW cm−2. Emission spectra of 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films in the PC resonating cavity with the PBG of (b) 444 nm, (c) 550 nm and (d) 592 nm under optical pumping. The dependence of the emission intensity and FWHM on the excitation intensity is showed in the inset. 
Both the drop of the emission spectrum and the lasing emission took place around the PBG of the PS CCs, which suggested that lasing oscillation occurred due to the feedback of emitted light in the PhC resonating cavity. The emergence of lasing emission at a higher t-Bu-RhB concentration of 3 wt% agreed well with recently reported simulation on an organic dye laser.56 In this case, a minimum dye concentration is needed to realize lasing action due to the intrinsic cavity losses. In addition, we investigated the laser excited emission spectra of the PhC resonating cavities with higher t-Bu-RhB concentrations. Narrow emission peaks can be obtained on the emission spectra, implying the emergence of the lasing oscillation in the PhC resonating cavities with higher t-Bu-RhB concentrations (ESI,† Fig. S8). Lasing emission was observed in 5, 6.9, and 10 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films in the PhC resonating cavity, while not in the bare polymer films without the PhC resonating cavity (ESI,† Fig. S9), indicating that the lasing oscillation could be ascribed to the PBG effect of PS CCs.
We further investigated the PBG effects on the gain enhancement of the dye by measuring the laser-pumped emission spectra of the PhC resonating cavities with different PBGs (ESI,† Fig. S10). Fig. 5(b)–(d) shows the emission spectra of the 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA in the PC resonating cavities with different PBGs. When the PBG is located at 444 nm, the emission intensity increases linearly with the excitation intensity, and the linewidth of the emission spectra keeps almost constant. The phenomena are similar to the bare dye-doped polymer without the PhC resonating cavity (ESI,† Fig. S11), implying no gain enhancement occurred when the PBG mismatched with the PL band of the dye. When the PBG was changed to 550 nm, a narrow peak of about 10 nm appears on the emission spectra when the excitation exceeded threshold, and the light-in vs. light-out (L–L) curve exhibited superlinearity, indicating the occurrence of amplified spontaneous emission. Because the bare dye doped polymer film did not exhibit an ASE phenomenon under identical excitation (ESI,† Fig. S9), the gain enhancement was attributed to the PBG edge effect resulting from the partial overlap of the PBG and the PL band of the dye.23,27 A strong increase of the fractional local density of the optical state occurred at the PBG edge, resulting in the amplified spontaneous emission due to the enhanced density of the optical state near the PBG edge.23,27,51 For the PBG of 592 nm, lasing oscillation was observed in the PhC resonating cavity, which was verified by the emergence of a very narrow emission peak, superlinearity of the L–L curve, and dramatical drop of the linewidth from 45 nm to 1 nm. It is obvious that an overlap of the PBG and the PL band is the necessary requirement to induce lasing action in the PhC resonating cavity, which is consistent with our previous report in the inverse opal resonating cavity.27
In addition, we studied the influence of dye concentration on the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity. The dependence of emission intensity and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) on the pump intensity was evaluated for the PhC resonating cavities with different t-Bu-RhB concentrations, as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(d). As plotted in Fig. 6(a), increase of the pump intensity resulted in dramatic drop of FWHM from 45 nm to 1.06 nm, indicating the lasing action in the PhC resonating cavity with 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB. Meanwhile, a clear threshold of lasing oscillation is observed in the L–L curve at an incident intensity of 6.80 MW cm−2 for the PhC resonating cavity. Upon further increasing the t-Bu-RhB concentration to 5, 6.9, and 10 wt%, the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavities are determined to be 2.65, 0.12, and 0.29 MW cm−2, respectively.

Threshold intensities and quality factor (Q) values of the lasing oscillation in each resonating cavity are summarized and listed in Table 1. The Q factor of the PhC resonating cavity is determined to be from 558 to 845, similar to the previous result in CC laser.29 It is worth noting that the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity with 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB is as low as 1/60 of that with 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB, illuminating the feasibility in effectively reducing lasing threshold by increasing the dye concentration. The optimized lasing threshold in this study is much lower than the previously reported values for CC lasers.24,57 Upon further increasing the t-Bu-RhB concentration from 6.9 wt% to 10 wt%, the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity increased again, which is mainly attributed to the molecular aggregation and concentration quenching of dye molecules. The phenomenon of the firstly dramatic drop and then increase of lasing threshold with the increase of the t-Bu-RhB concentration in gain media is of great interest, and the origin of the lasing threshold variation in the PhC resonating cavity is needed to be further investigated.
The lasing threshold dependence on the dye concentration could be attributed to the gain factor of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. In order to clearly clarify the relationship between the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity and the gain factor of the t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films, the gain factors and lasing thresholds of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films with different doping concentrations are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that the lasing threshold of the PhC resonating cavity depends strongly on the gain factors of t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. For dye concentration from 3 wt% to 6.9 wt%, lasing threshold dropped monotonously with the increase of the gain factors for t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA films. Nevertheless, at higher dye concentration of 10 wt%, lasing threshold increased almost three times, due to the decreased gain factor coming from the possible dye molecule aggregation and fluorescence quenching. The results presented here suggested that the lasing threshold decrease could be essentially attributed to the variation of the optical gain of the t-Bu RhB doped PMMA films. The strategy presented here provides an efficient and facile method to significantly lower lasing threshold, and will be prospective for practical application of PhC lasers.
To investigate the characteristics of the emitted lasing beam, a far-field image and an intensity profile of the lasing emission were recorded and analyzed. Fig. 7 shows a well-defined lasing emission from the PhC resonating cavity with 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB at pump intensity above the lasing threshold, and the angular dependence of the lasing emission as well. As shown in Fig. 7(a), an orange lasing beam emitted vertically from the PhC resonating cavity was observed on a white background screen. We can also see concentric rings with different radii around the lasing spot in the far-field image of the lasing beam, indicating good spatial coherence of the lasing light field. The laser oscillation was located at 592 nm, with the FWHM of 0.7 nm, as plotted in Fig. 7(b). The intensity profile indicates a good Gaussian fit to the output intensity distribution (ESI,† Fig. S12). Next, the angular dependence of the lasing action was measured. The pump intensity of the excitation fs laser beam was 11.2 nW. Fig. 7(c) plots the lasing intensity collected at different detection angles. The peak intensity is the highest at the detection angle of 0°, and decreases rapidly as the angle increases from 0° to 5°. When the detection angle increased to 6°, the lasing peak disappeared on the emission spectrum. The angular dependence of the lasing oscillation suggests the directional lasing action in the PhC resonating cavity, which is attributed to the pseudo gap of the PS CCs. The angular dependence of the lasing oscillation further corroborates the effect of the PBG on the lasing action, which is consistent with the previously reported results in the colloidal crystal laser.24 Single-mode lasing emission with low lasing threshold as well as highly directional feature is of significant importance for the construction of practical PhC lasers.

Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed an approach for preparing polymeric gain media doped with t-Bu-RhB at a high concentration, and demonstrated its application in a low lasing threshold PhC laser. The concentration of t-Bu-RhB in PMMA was improved as high as 6.9 wt% without evident fluorescence quenching. Lasing oscillation was obtained in the PhC resonating cavity due to the PBG effect of the PS CCs. The PhC resonating cavity constructed with 6.9 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film exhibited the lasing threshold as low as 0.12 MW cm−2, which is 1/60 of that with 3 wt% t-Bu-RhB doped PMMA film. The decrease of the lasing threshold is attributed to the gain factors of the gain media. Furthermore, high-quality surface emitting lasing action is verified by the far-field pattern and angular dependence of the single-mode lasing emission. This study provides a strategy to lower the lasing threshold of PhC lasers, and may open new avenues for the fabrication and application of PhC lasers in photonic devices, sensors, and biomedical systems.
