These materials usually exhibit conversion-type (and alloying-type) lithium, sodium, or potassium storage mechanisms, thereby delivering large specific capacities. However, the cycling performances of phosphide anodes require further enhancement to satisfy the requirements of practical applications. Further, the large-scale production of pure-phase, stable metal phosphides for commercialization are also limited.

To accommodate the diversified and rigid requirements in different secondary batteries, various nanostructures and architectures ranging from zero dimensions to three dimensions, such as nanoparticles, core–shells, nanowires, layered structures, and composite electrodes (formed with conductive carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene), have been used in metal phosphides to improve their rate and cycling performances. In the end, we conclude the current concerns and future development with respect to practical applications of metal phosphide anodes in rechargeable batteries.Zhifa LiZhifa Li is currently a master's student under the supervision of Prof. Quanyi Liu at the College of Civil Aviation Safety Engineering in Civil Aviation Flight University of China.

1. Introduction
With advances in science and technology, humans are gradually realizing the importance of efficiently utilizing natural resources, such as fossil fuels. This also raises concerns about excessive exploitation and exhausting energy. In this regard, scientists have developed numerous new energy resources that rely on solar, nuclear, wind, and water power. To facilitate the utilization and conversion of such sustainable power resources, rechargeable batteries are usually required, which can safely integrate these new energies to the home grid.1,2 As a representative of energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have received remarkable attention since the first commercial battery was invented by Sony in the early 1990s. LIBs have found widespread applications in our daily lives because of their considerable energy density and cost-effectiveness.3 With the increasing popularity of smart devices, portable computers, and electrical vehicles, the development of LIBs and their commercialization, in turn, have seen heightened promotion.4,5 Nevertheless, single LIBs and finite lithium resources cannot meet the increasing demands of the rapidly developing society.6
Inspired by the requirements for advanced rechargeable batteries with reduced costs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have been regarded as alternatives to LIBs.7 This is mainly due to the more earth abundance and wider availability of sodium and potassium than lithium, and the comparable redox potentials of Na+/Na (−2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) and K+/K (−2.93 V vs. SHE) to that of Li+/Li (−3.04 V vs. SHE).8,9 Compared with commercial LIBs, research on both SIBs and PIBs is still in its infancy because of their relatively poor energy density and inferior cycling performance.10 Therefore, SIBs and PIBs have attracted increasing attention, and significant progresses have been achieved in their research, rendering them to be promising substitutes for LIBs.11,12
The anode material is among the critical components of batteries, which—by integration with cathode materials—largely determines the battery performance, including the specific capacity, potential difference, and energy density. Despite the fact that graphite-type anode materials have stable electrochemical performances, they fail to cater to the ever-growing demands of high specific capacity and high rate capability; this can be attributed to their limited theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1 in LIBs.13 Consequently, transition metal oxides (TMOs; MxOy, where M = Ti, V, Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, etc.) have been developed as alternative anode materials for LIBs due to their good corrosion resistance, chemical stability, and attractive theoretical specific capacities (up to ∼1000 mA h g−1, which is ∼2–3 times higher than that of commercial graphite anodes) induced by a conversion-type reaction.14,15 However, conventional TMO anodes usually suffer from low electrical conductivity and large volume changes during electrochemical cycling, which can result in electrode pulverization and therefore rapid capacity decay. Hence, in order to find promising anode materials for use in rechargeable batteries toward practical applications, scientists have devoted permanent efforts toward designing new materials or novel structures in existing materials, which have large earth abundance and exhibit favorable electrochemical properties, such as silicon (Si)-, phosphorus (P)-, and tin (Sn)-based anode materials.16–18 For brevity, we compare four different anode materials in LIBs with respect to their costs, theoretical capacities, volume changes during the charge/discharge process, rate capabilities, and cycling performances (as shown in Fig. 1). Clearly, Si-based anodes possess the highest theoretical capacity of 4200 mA h g−1, poorest cycling performance, and largest volume change among all these anode materials. However, P-based anodes usually exhibit comparable rate capability and cycling performance to Si- and Sn-based materials, respectively. Among the numerous anode materials, P—mainly corresponding to red phosphorus and black phosphorus (BP)—has a worthwhile theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1, thereby raising extensive attention among the electrochemical research field. For instance, red phosphorus used as the anode for LIBs yields a high discharge capacity of 1692 mA h g−1 at the first cycle, but the charge capacity is only 67 mA h g−1; this poor cycling performance limits further applications.19,20 It should be noted that metal phosphide anodes derived from P-based materials often show improved stability and cycling performance upon a combination reaction of P and metal.21 This mainly benefits from the enhanced electrical conductivity, relatively easy breakage of bonding between the metal and P atoms, and increased structural stability.
 Fig. 1  Comparisons of different anode materials for LIBs in terms of cost, theoretical capacity, cycling performance, rate capability, and volume changes during charge/discharge processes. 
The electrochemical reactions between the metal phosphides and Li+ (Na+ or K+) ions usually involve the following three types (eqn (1)–(3)), i.e., intercalation, conversion, and alloying:
(a) Intercalation reaction:  MxPy + zLi+(K+,Na+) + ze− ⇌ Li(K,Na)zMxPy(1)
(b) Conversion reaction: MxPy + 3yLi+(K+,Na+) + 3ye− ⇌ yLi(K,Na)3P + xM(2)
(c) Alloying reaction:  xM + zLi+(K+,Na+) + ze− ⇌ Li(K,Na)zMx(3)
Metal phosphides with more than two types of reactions exhibit relatively large specific capacities. For example, the GeP5 anode in LIBs exhibits a high theoretical capacity of up to 1888 mA h g−1, which arises from both alloying- and conversion-type reaction mechanisms for lithium storage.22 In comparison to conventional TMO anodes, metal phosphides usually possess improved electrical conductivities, lower redox potentials, and relatively high theoretical specific capacities. However, some deficiencies still remain in metal phosphides, such as poor cycling stability and low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE). In brief, an ideal metal phosphide anode should exhibit the following traits: (1) relatively low electrochemical potential to induce a large potential difference when integrated with the cathode, (2) favorable specific capacity and cycling performance, (3) high ICE, (4) good electrical conductivity, and (5) excellent chemical and environmental stabilities.
Nowadays, various metal phosphide nanostructures have been developed with favorable electrochemical properties, which distinguish them as promising anode materials for rechargeable batteries. Because nanostructure architectures can generally facilitate the diffusion of ions (i.e., Li+/Na+/K+), since the ionic diffusion time (τ) is related to the ionic diffusion coefficient (D) and ionic diffusion length (L) via the equation τ = L2/D.23 According to the latest research on metal phosphide anodes for LIBs/SIBs/PIBs, this review classifies these new materials into zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures.24–27 A schematic diagram of the typical morphologies is shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, many electrically conductive additives, such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene, have been incorporated into metal phosphides to further enhance their rate capability and cycling performance. In this review, we first introduce conventional synthesis methods for metal phosphides and outline the advantages and limitations of each method. Then, we summarize the electrochemical performance of various metal phosphide anodes according to their dimensionalities (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) and discuss the corresponding lithium/sodium/potassium storage mechanisms. Moreover, further suggestions on improving the ICE are also provided. In the end, we discuss the current concerns and possible future developments with respect to the fuel-cell assembly and commercial applications of metal phosphide anodes for LIBs/SIBs/PIBs.

2. Synthesis methods of metal phosphides
In this section, we introduce conventional synthesis methods for metal phosphides, namely, mechanical alloying (mainly high-energy ball milling (HEBM)), high-temperature solid-state reaction, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and solution synthesis. They are important for understanding the fundamentals in fabricating promising anode materials via morphology control.
To begin with, HEBM or mechanochemical processing is a low-cost, highly effective, and scalable method to prepare superfine alloy materials or composites.28 It has been extensively employed to prepare a variety of nanostructured metal phosphide electrodes for LIBs/SIBs/PIBs. HEBM mainly exploits the rotation or vibration motion of the milling vials to grind, pulverize, and weld the raw materials with the aim of producing pure-phase alloy materials or achieving uniform composites. In general, the grain size of the as-milled products can be controlled by changing the ball-milling parameters, such as the ball-to-material ratio, rotation speed, and milling time. For example, Kim et al. utilized HEBM to prepare Sn4P3 nanolumps from Sn and red phosphorus powders under the protection of an Ar atmosphere.29 Many other metal phosphides have also been successfully prepared via this method, such as CuP2,30 V4P7,31 and GeP5.22 Despite the high efficiency and wider availability of HEBM for the preparation of metal phosphides, a subsequent annealing process may be necessary to promote crystallization and therefore improve the electrical conductivity. For instance, pure-phase GeP materials were obtained via HEBM and subsequent low-temperature annealing (at 370 °C).32 Moreover, extending the ball-milling time could introduce trace amounts of impurities that may have a detrimental impact on the electrochemical properties of the obtained compounds. HEBM also has other potential disadvantages, such as the generation of noise in the milling process, requirement of time-consuming cleaning processes to remove contaminants on the milling vials, and difficulty in obtaining products with regular shapes.
As another chemical technology, the CVD method uses gaseous substances to generate solid deposition via chemical reactions.33 For the preparation of inorganic materials, it mainly comprises the following procedures: producing volatilizable substances, transferring them onto the reaction region, and finally producing solid deposition. For the preparation of metal phosphides, the commonly adopted P sources are red phosphorus, NaH2PO2, and InP precursors.34 The Zn3P2 compound is considered to be a representative for analyzing the CVD method. Li's group utilized the thermal vapor of mixed Zn and InP powders to produce Zn3P2 whiskers and cover it on carbon fabrics in a high-purity N2 atmosphere at a temperature of 800 °C for 2 h.35 The as-synthesized whiskers formed above were directly adopted as integrated anodes with no binder or conductive additives for LIBs. Moreover, by controlling the experimental conditions in the CVD process, expected compositions, morphologies, and crystal structures could be ensured. Benefitting from its advantages in obtaining high-purity, high-compactness thin films that could be evenly coated on complex surfaces, this strategy could be effectively applied to prepare thin-film crystals on the surface of the desired substrates. However, certain thermal stresses were produced in between the substrate and the coated material that have different thermal expansion coefficients. These internal stresses could result in mechanical instability and possible peeling of the deposited films. Other potential drawbacks of CVD include the requirement of relatively high deposition temperatures and possible involvement of toxic, corrosive, and flammable precursors (which requires additional safety measures toward handling).
The hydrothermal method is a liquid-phase technique for handling the synthesis of particular inorganic materials; it uses water as the solvent or reactant.36 The reaction often happens by heating the vessel to create high temperatures (∼100–1000 °C) and high pressures (up to 100 MPa) in a sealed pressure reactor. In a large number of reaction types, crystallization is considered to be an important strategy. The reaction process of crystallization mainly includes solvation in water, producing a supersaturated solution, crystallization in the growth region of the seed, and low temperature. The solvothermal technique—the evolution of the hydrothermal technique with a few differences—uses organic or nonwater materials (such as ammonia or methanol) as the medium.37 For instance, via the solvothermal strategy, Liu's group were the first to use the raw materials of SnCl2·2H2O dissolved in the solvent of ethanol and N,N-dimethylformamide to prepare a composite solution; then, this solution was transferred onto a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and calculated amounts of NaBH4 and white phosphorus were added to this solution at 180 °C for 10 h.38 Finally, Sn4P3 nanoparticles with uniform shapes were successfully synthesized. Compared with the above methods, powders synthesized by the hydrothermal or solvothermal method show obvious advantages, such as facile shape control, small size distribution, high purity, and suppressed aggregations. However, they also suffer from certain disadvantages such as higher production cost arising from the long reaction time and expensive autoclaves, potential safety problems in the reaction process, and difficulty of the in situ observation of the reaction process.36,37
High-temperature solid-state synthesis is another traditional technology of powder processing.39 By definition, it usually refers to the reaction between the raw materials to produce the desired compounds, which involves solid surface contact, reaction, nucleation, and crystal growth at high temperatures. This method is generally limited to the preparation of thermodynamically stable compounds, and it is usually used in conjunction with muffle furnace, tube furnace, and vacuum sealing machine. For the synthesis of the ZnP2 compound, Haesuk's group undertook the vacuum sealing of red phosphorus and Zn metal (at a molar ratio of 1:2) in a quartz tube, which was maintained at 1000 °C for 5 h and annealed at 700 °C for 3 h.40 Finally, monoclinic ZnP2 with a layered shape was obtained. However, proper precautions were necessary to avoid the possible explosion of the enclosed ampoules because of the high P vapor pressure at elevated temperatures. It is good practice to perform slow heating near the temperature region of P vaporization (∼850–900 K), which can effectively reduce the inner vapor pressure. Moreover, red phosphorus may partially suffer from an incomplete reaction with the metal sources, resulting in an unfavorable transition to white phosphorus, which could raise flammability issues when exposed to air. It should be noted that the high-temperature solid-state synthesis also has other inherent disadvantages such as higher energy consumption (due to the higher temperature required for the reaction), low efficiency, and difficulties in achieving sufficiently fine powders. However, at present, this strategy is still commonly used to precisely control the stoichiometry and obtain high-purity compounds. It can be combined with the ball-milling process to obtain ultrafine nanostructured metal anodes for rechargeable batteries.
In addition, many other methods have proven to be effective in the synthesis of metal phosphides with unique structures or compositions, such as electrospinning,41 temperature-programmed reduction,42 organometallic synthesis,43 and gas–solid-phase methods.44 Here, we would like to skip these details. Interested readers can refer to the corresponding studies in the literature. According to the above comparisons of the different synthesis routes for metal phosphides and the concerns raised by the industry, it has been suggested that the ball-milling method should become compatible with industrial manufacturing, thereby facilitating the large-scale, low-cost production of metal phosphides. This method can also be implemented to incorporate a conductive layer (such as carbon black) onto the metal phosphides to improve their electrical conductivity and therefore the electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes.
3. Phosphide anode materials with different dimensions
An ideal anode for LIBs should possess the following features: (1) low and steady lithiation voltage; (2) ability to permit more lithium-ion reversible lithiation or delithiation; (3) small volume changes during the charge/discharge process; (4) long service life; (5) high ionic conductivity; (6) ability to form a stable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI); and (7) ability to produce a high discharge voltage with other cathode materials in the secondary batteries.45,46 These requirements also apply to PIBs and SIBs.
Until now, numerous metal phosphides have been synthesized by combining the P precursor with various metal sources (such as Fe, Cu, V, Zn, Si, Ni, Mo, Ti, Ge, Sn, Co, Mn, etc.) to form binary compounds, such as GeP5, CuP2, Cu3P, SiP2, Sn4P3, and TiP2, which serve as promising anodes for LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs. A comparison of the electrochemical performances of metal phosphide anodes for different LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs are listed in Table 1. The electrochemical performance of the anode materials is considerably improved by these new materials via the formation of different dimensions and modification.

3.1 0D metal phosphides
During the development process, extensive studies have been carried out on high-tap-density 0D metal phosphides as alternative anode materials for battery applications.47,64,65 Usually, 0D nanomaterials have a large specific surface area due to the quantum size and surface effects induced by the ultrafine particles, and they show promising performances due to their advanced electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties.36,66 According to reports in the literature, most 0D metal phosphide anode materials are fabricated by HEBM due to the requirement of larger quantities; however, smaller proportions are synthesized by other methods that cannot efficiently produce it, such as hydrothermal and high-temperature solid-phase methods.36,67 These 0D-type materials show basic performances with regard to specific capacity, cycling stability, rate capability, etc. Therefore, this has formed the foundation for subsequent research on anode materials. In the near future, 0D metal phosphides with excellent potential performances can become ideal commercial anode materials.
Benefiting from the high theoretical specific capacity of the constituent P, 0D metal phosphides exhibit higher initial discharge capacities.68,69 For instance, Woo mixed Ti and P at three molar ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 to form titanium phosphide composites via a mechanochemical method.70 The ratio with the best performance used as the anode material for LIBs was 1:4 for powders blended with Ti and P, and the formed TiP2–P composites exhibited a large specific capacity of 1645 mA h g−1 on the first discharge. However, anodes made from the TiP2–P composite exhibited a poor retention ability, i.e., the capacity was drastically degraded to 100 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles. Compared with the mechanochemical method, HEBM is an efficient way to produce 0D metal phosphides with better electrochemical performances.71,72 For example, V4P7 nanoparticles were synthesized via the HEBM method at 300 rpm for 60 h.31 A schematic illustration of the synthesis process is shown in Fig. 3a. The obtained V4P7 nanoparticles were distributed with a uniform shape and ∼100 nm in size (as shown in Fig. 3b). When used as the anodes for LIBs, V4P7 electrodes afforded capacities of 1035 and 882 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 in the first discharge and charge cycle, respectively. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity was maintained at 641 mA h g−1, with capacity retention of 73%. In the discharge process, the Li+ insertion reaction occurs in V4P7, that is, Li+ was inserted into the V4P7 matrix and the reversible ternary Li–V–P phase was formed. However, there was no evidence to confirm its formula due to its amorphous nature. The good cycling stability could be ascribed to the above reaction mechanism and the core–shell nanostructure that restricted the crushing and aggregation of the active particles. Besides, V4P7 nanoparticles delivered good rate capability because they could retain the structural integrity derived from the fine morphology during the lithiation/delithiation process.

It has been suggested that promising 0D anode materials can be obtained by employing a high-energy strategy that can facilitate the combination reaction process. Therefore, increasing the rotation speed may further expand the availability of 0D metal phosphides with fine nanostructures and diverse compositions.73,74 Recently, GeP5 and GeP5@C anode materials were synthesized via HEBM performed at 400–500 rpm, which was subsequently used as the anode for SIBs with a higher specific capacity.75 In addition to higher efficiency, a higher tap density is another important factor for the synthesis of commercial anode materials.76,77 In consideration of these two concerns, Kim utilized a highly efficient ball-milling system (SPEX 8000M apparatus) to fabricate CuP2 nanoparticles in 3 h, which was used as the anode for LIBs.30 The one-step HEBM process considerably shortened the time required for sample preparation because of the high rotation speed of 1725 rpm. Subsequently, CuP2 nanoparticles were encapsulated with carbon to form CuP2@C composite electrodes. As the content of well-dispersed carbon increases, the particle size generally becomes smaller and the morphologies seem to be more regular than those of pure CuP2 nanoparticles. The CuP2@C composites achieved tap densities of ∼1.1–1.27 g cm−3, while the coated carbon content ranged from 10% to 30%. Among these composite electrodes, CuP2 nanoparticles with 20% carbon content were the most promising anode materials, demonstrating stable cycling performance of >720 mA h g−1 beyond 100 cycles at 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 3d), which is superior to those of pure CuP2 and other composite electrodes.78,79
Clearly, metal phosphides usually tend to offer higher stability as well as specific capacity when mixed with Super P (carbon black) or graphite. The incorporated carbon matrix can help improve the electrical conductivity of the composite electrodes, promote the utilization of active substances, and buffer volume expansion.17,49,80 The FeP/graphite composite electrode used as the anode for SIBs was prepared by the ball-milling method by mixing FeP and commercial graphite.81 After 70 cycles, pure FeP delivered a specific capacity of 271 mA h g−1 with 47% discharge retention in the second cycle. In comparison, the FeP/graphite composite electrode delivered a discharge capacity of 175 mA h g−1, retaining a discharge capacity of 58% in the second cycle. Moreover, the FeP/graphite anode shows better rate performance than FeP at current densities of 500, 1000, and 2500 mA g−1. Hence, the presence of amorphous carbon derived from graphite after ball milling improved the electrical conductivity and prevented the pulverization of anode materials. In addition, GeP5/C composite electrode was synthesized using GeP5 and commercial graphite via HEBM.75 Using HEBM to introduce graphite, the primary GeP5/C composite particles were converted to smaller and denser particles with high electrical conductivity. The composite electrode possessed a large specific capacity of 1250 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency (CE) of 93% in the first cycle. Further, the capacity retention was up to 98% even after 60 cycles, indicative of the superior stability. Due to the fact that the graphite matrix could better buffer the sodiation/desodiation-induced volume expansion and the synergetic sodium storage by Ge and P, the GeP5/C composite electrodes delivered superior rate performance and cycling stability. In accordance with the experimental results, the following reaction processes could be theoretically concluded: GeP5 + 16Na+ + 16e− →5Na3P + NaGe(4) 5Na3P ⇌ 5P + 15Na+ + 15e−(5) NaGe ⇌ Ge + Na+ + e−(6)where 16 units of Na+ could be held together by the GeP5 matrix. The theoretical capacity of GeP5 was calculated to be 1888 mA h g−1, out of which 118 and 1770 mA h g−1 were contributed by elemental Ge and the 5 P atoms, respectively. In the initial discharge process, Na3P and NaGe intermediates were produced by the sodiation of GeP5 with Na+. However, in the subsequent cycle, the reaction processes involved alloying and dealloying. Therefore, Na storage mechanisms in GeP5 included conversion and reversible alloying processes.
Coating Super P (carbon black) is also a powerful way to improve the electrochemical properties and preserve the structural integrity of metal phosphides.72,82 To form well-constructed SiP2/C composite electrodes for SIBs, Saddique et al. uniformly dispersed SiP2 within the Super P framework via a facile HEBM method.48 The XRD results confirmed the phase composition and pyrite-type cubic structure of SiP2 (as shown in Fig. 4a and b). Because of the enhanced conductivity of the electrode and structural compatibility with the electrochemistry cycles, SiP2/C demonstrated excellent cyclability, i.e., a high capacity of 410 mA h g−1 was delivered after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 and over 80% of the initial capacity was retained after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 4c).

TiC, as an inert component, is a stable material; when it is used as an additive for anode materials, it can stabilize the material structure. Sn4P3/TiC composites were synthesized with TiC contents of 10, 20, and 30 wt% via the HEBM method and used as the anode for SIBs. The agglomeration of Sn was considered to be responsible for the decay in anode capacity. By adding TiC, Sn agglomeration is effectively suppressed and the cyclability of Sn4P3 is improved. Among the three TiC concentrations, Sn4P3/TiC-30% was confirmed to exhibit better performance with a stable reversible specific capacity of 300 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Simultaneously, the high-density TiC additive endowed the anode with a higher volume capacity, and the presence of TiC could alleviate any volume changes and increase the electrical conductivity.
3.2 1D metal phosphides
To obtain promising and excellent anode materials for use in rechargeable batteries, various metal phosphides with different structures and morphologies have been investigated. In addition to 0D anode materials, metal phosphide anode materials with 1D structures have also attracted wide attention, such as nanowires, nanotubes, nanorods, and peapod-like structures.54,83–85 These specific 1D structures can shorten the transmission path of ions and electrons, alleviate agglomeration, and accommodate volume changes.
A phosphidation method was employed to realize the in situ growth of Cu3P nanowires on a copper current collector.42 These nanowires had an average width of less than 200 nm and a length of about 5 μm. They offer abundant buffer space and facilitate the transmission of sodium ions, thereby serving as promising anodes for SIBs. Binder-free Cu3P nanowire electrodes demonstrate stable cycling performance and high rate capabilities. However, it should be noted that this sort of Cu3P nanowire arrays are disordered and dispersed, which may hinder further improvements in their electrochemical performance for applications in batteries. Such an assembled method derived from the inherent characteristics of nanowires simplifies the previously complicated electrode preparation processes, and it offers numerous available surface sites for sodium-/lithium-ion storage, too. To obtain uniform nanowires, Zn3P2 nanowires were grown on Ti foil via a facile CVD method.50 The nanowires turned out to be self-supported and bundled assemblies with a length of a few tens of microns and extremely small diameters could be obtained (Fig. 5a). When used as integrated anodes, Zn3P2 nanowires could be directly assembled on half cells without the need for conductive additives and conventional binders. Therefore, these nanowires could be simultaneously applied for both SIBs and LIBs. For SIBs, the as-synthesized hierarchical Zn3P2 anodes exhibited good electrochemical performances, i.e., the reversible specific capacity retained 600 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 85 cycles, and highly impressive rate performances could be obtained at 580, 320, 300, and 280 mA h g−1 when the current densities were 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 5b). For LIBs, they could deliver a reversible specific capacity of 1100 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 over 100 cycles, and high rate performance of 700 mA h g−1 could be obtained at a current density of 6.4 A g−1. The Zn3P2 nanowires experienced multiple conversions and alloy-type reactions for the storage of sodium ions, i.e., Zn3P2 + (6 + 3/13)Na+ + (6 + 3/13)e− ⇌ 3/13NaZn13 + 2 Na3P. Further, the excellent performances of Zn3P2 nanowire anodes for SIBs mainly benefit from the active surface areas and sufficient space between the neighboring nanowires that facilitates electrolyte diffusion.

CNTs—typical 1D materials—mainly comprise multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which afford unique and superior mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties.86,87 CNT-decorated metal phosphides afford improved electrochemical performances in rechargeable batteries.43,88 SiP2 can deliver—in theory—a high specific capacity of 1788 mA h g−1 for SIBs and 2902 mA h g−1 for LIBs, but it has very poor cycling stability in practice. To address this issue, MWCNT-wrapped SiP2 was successfully prepared via HEBM,53 as evident from the morphologies shown in the inset of Fig. 5c. MWCNT-wrapped SiP2 delivered good cycling performances with a reversible capacity of 925 mA h g−1 in SIBs and 1622 mA h g−1 in LIBs after 200 and 100 cycles, respectively, which is partially shown in Fig. 5d. In comparison with the evidently disintegrated and collapsed pure SiP2 anodes upon cycling, the surface integrity of MWCNT-wrapped SiP2 was effectively retained, which can be attributed to the fact that particle cracking could be prevented by a considerable degree and SiP2 fragments could be captured by MWCNTs during cycling. The contributions of MWCNTs are as follows: (a) improving the electrical conductivity of SiP2 (about five times that of pure SiP2), as shown in Fig. 5c; (b) offering strong and interlaced networks with good mechanical resilience to the treated SiP2 material.
In addition, carbon fibers have also emerged as a candidate additive for batteries due to their high temperature resistance, strong interaction with the matrix, and lower cost compared with CNTs.89–91 MoP@N,P-codoped carbon nanofibers (NPCNFs) were synthesized by an electrospinning strategy followed by subsequent carbonization and phosphorization treatments, forming a free-standing and flexible membrane directly used as anodes for PIBs.55 The as-synthesized MoP@NPCNFs nanocomposites demonstrated an average diameter of ∼200 nm (Fig. 6a). After treatment with nitric acid, the fiber surface turned porous, which facilitated the successful loading of high-capacity electroactive MoP particles. Based on the high electroactivity of metal phosphides, doping P further increased the electronic and ionic conductivities. The nanoscale, porous network produced by NPCNFs provided a free-standing transfer pathway, which not only afforded a strong link and therefore buffering electrode pulverization and material aggregation, but also shortened the K+ diffusion path that contributed toward superior rate performance and cycling stability (Fig. 6b). The flexible electrode permitted a large bending angle and long-term usage, which is expected for wearable electronics.92,93

Moreover, nanorods are also attractive structures and have been designed as an alternative for battery anodes.95–97 For example, FeP nanorod arrays on Ti supports (denoted as FeP NRs/Ti) were synthesized via a solvothermal process and used as the anode for SIBs.98 FeP NRs grown in situ on Ti substrates can induce chemical contact, thereby forming an intense contact between the FeP NRs and Ti substrate during cycling. These binder-free and highly orientated 1D electrodes can effectively alleviate volume expansion during (dis)charge processes and afford excellent cycling performance with a capacity of 207.7 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The Na storage mechanism in FeP NRs/Ti is associated with Na+ insertion (FeP + xNa+ → NaxFeP) and the subsequent conversion process (FeP + 3Na+ + 3e− → Na3P + Fe). The superior rate and cycling performances could be ascribed to the acceleration of sodium-ion diffusion and excellent dimensional stability induced by the nanorod arrays. Importantly, the enhanced sodium-ion diffusion capability could shorten the transition time for ions. Nanorod arrays possess high morphological stability that contributed toward good rate performance.
When some pores appear on the 1D nanorods, this morphology could provide efficient space to alleviate volume expansion, more active sites, and facilitate interactions between the active material and electrolyte, which can afford enhanced electrochemical performance.97,99 Further, 1D mesoporous CoP nanorods (Fig. 6c) were prepared by a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent thermal phosphorization treatment at low temperatures.94 The 1D mesoporous CoP could provide additional active sites for lithium storage, as well as extra space to buffer volume changes and restrain electrode pulverization. Furthermore, the CoP electrode with 1D nanosized architecture afforded a shortened diffusion path and accelerated the transport of both electrons and Li ions. Benefitting from the activation of the mesoporous structures, the capacity increased after 40 charge/discharge cycles. Therefore, a high reversible specific capacity of 894 mA h g−1 could be obtained after 300 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g−1 in addition to good rate performance of 467 mA h g−1 at a current density of 4000 mA g−1 (Fig. 6d).
3.3 2D metal phosphides
2D materials usually have large specific surface areas and conductive networks that can form more complete contact with the electrolytes, as well as allow a large number of ions to be intercalated. When the structure is stably and orderly arranged, a relatively short solid-state diffusion time can be obtained for ions in 2D materials, which provides the possibility for rapid charge and discharge processes. In this regard, metal phosphides with 2D architectures have aroused great interest and have been developed into promising anode materials for rechargeable batteries.100–103
Recently, monoclinic ZnP2 compounds synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state reaction have been used as anodes for LIBs.40 The obtained ZnP2 powder materials consist of stacked layers with an interlayer distance of about 10 nm. The layered ZnP2 anode delivered an initial discharge capacity of up to 1490 mA h g−1, but only 30% was retained after the first three cycles. The poor capacity retention could be mainly ascribed to the decomposition reaction that may occur between ZnP2, resultant Li–P clusters, and electrolytes. In contrast, a layered P-like GeP5/C composite anode (Fig. 7a) for LIBs fabricated via the HEBM method showed superior cycling stability and rate performance.22 In comparison to the relatively low yield of layered BP obtained via the chemical vapor transport growth, it is facile to harvest large-scale GeP5 compounds via the above method. Based on the analysis of electrical conductivity, GeP5 could achieve conductivity of 1.0 × 106 S m−1, which is up to 10000 times that of BP and 10 times that of graphite.104 Combined with the loose flexibility of the carbon matrix, GeP5/C anodes showed better layered morphologies, which could considerably facilitate the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions, effectively buffer the volume expansion, and enhance contact with the electrolyte to form the transfer architecture. As shown in Fig. 7b, the discharge/charge capacity of the GeP5/C anode could be retained at nearly 2300 mA h g−1 in the initial 40 cycles. The CE of the GeP5/C anode in the first cycle was as high as 95%, which gradually increased to 100% and was maintained in the subsequent 40 cycles. Based on the ex situ XRD results, both Li22Ge5 (or Li4.4Ge) and Li3P were observed after the initial discharge process, indicative of the conversion and alloying reactions in GeP electrodes, which were expressed as GeP5 + 19.4Li+ + 19.4e− → 5Li3P + Li4.4Ge. This resulted in a large theoretical capacity of ∼2289 mA h g−1 contributed by both P and Ge.

On some occasions, the electrode may suffer from irreversible changes in the structure after charge/discharge cycles, thereby degrading the battery performance. Therefore, strategies should be developed to improve this situation, e.g., designing novel anodes with stable 2D structures that can be recovered during the charge/discharge process. Recently, a self-healing GeP anode (for LIBs) with layered structures was synthesized by the mechanical milling method followed by a low-temperature annealing process.32 During the charge process, the crystal structure of GeP could be restored to the initial layered morphology due to the low formation energies of the Ge–P and Ge–Ge bonds in GeP. Therefore, the self-healing ability of the GeP anode alleviated the collapse of its structure after several cycles, facilitating the insertion of an increasing amount of Li ions between the GeP interlayers and therefore affording faster reaction kinetics. These features contribute toward enhanced cyclability and rate performance in GeP electrodes, rendering them as a favorable anode material for LIBs.
In addition to the above 2D metal phosphides obtained via single solid-state synthesis, well-dispersed, porous FeP@C nanoplates (Fig. 7c) were prepared by hydrothermal growth, carbonization, and chemical conversion via a low-temperature phosphidation strategy.105 Due to sufficient space between the neighboring plates, the FeP@C electrode used as the anode for LIBs could not only relieve the mechanical tension from volume changes during the insertion/extraction of Li ions, but also accelerate the transport of ions and electrons. This plate-like structure endowed FeP@C anodes with extraordinary durability under conditions of long cycling and high discharge/charge rates (Fig. 7d). According to the CV results, the FeP electrode underwent intercalation reaction (FeP + xLi+ + xe− → LixFeP) and conversion reaction (LixFeP + (3 − x)Li+ + (3 − x)e− → Fe + Li3P) during the discharge process. Furthermore, the nanoplates could dramatically inhibit the aggregation of metal phosphides, and the abundant small pores in the nanoplates contributed toward the enhanced surface area and reversible capacity of the anode materials.
As a typical 2D nanomaterial with good mechanical elasticity, high structural toughness,106 superior electrical conductivity, and excellent stability, graphene has been incorporated as an important additive or substrate in metal phosphides. For example, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets have been introduced in small Sn4P3 nanoparticles to form Sn4P3/RGO composite anodes (Fig. 8a) for PIBs via the HEBM process.58 The composite anode demonstrated numerous mesopores that could supply ample and extensive pathways for potassium ions. Meanwhile, the surface area of the composite was about two times larger than that of pure Sn4P3, which could accelerate the insertion/extraction process for potassium ions, facilitate electrolyte diffusion, and afford more active sites to store potassium ions. In contrast to the rapid capacity decay of bare Sn4P3 electrodes, the Sn4P3/RGO composite anodes delivered more stable capacity (Fig. 8b), indicative of the beneficial addition of RGO in enhancing the electrochemical properties of Sn4P3.

BP, an analog of graphene, possesses puckered lamellar structures that can provide sufficient interlayer spaces for ion storage, high specific capacity of 2596 mA h g−1 for LIBs, and ultrafast diffusion of ions; its disadvantages are low success rate of preparation and relatively high cost.108,109 Further, the poor electrical conductivity and stability of BP inhibit its wide applications. Recently, researchers have synthesized Ni2P/BP heterostructures and utilized them as anodes for LIBs.107 A schematic illustration of the synthesis procedure is shown in Fig. 8c. The highly conductive Ni2P nanoparticles were embedded in situ onto BP nanosheets exfoliated from high-quality BP crystals. The 2D morphologies of the BP nanosheets could be effectively maintained and many tiny Ni2P nanocrystals (average diameter: ∼5 nm) were found to be evenly deposited on these BP nanosheets (Fig. 8d). The charge carrier concentration of the Ni2P/BP heterostructures was significantly improved by three orders of magnitude (from 1.25 × 1017 to 1.37 × 1020 cm−3). Moreover, BP nanosheets could provide a longer diffusion pathway for charge carriers, thereby improving their transfer kinetics. The agglomeration of Ni2P particles and the stacking of BP could be effectively prevented by such a heterostructure after their anchoring with each other. The surface area of the Ni2P BP material was further increased to 41 m2 g−1, which effectively enhanced the interaction between the electrolyte and electrode and therefore improved the lithium-ion storage (Fig. 8e).
3.4 3D metal phosphides
0D materials commonly assume the form of particles or lumps; most of them have a single morphology or structure. Further, a large amount of space in their interior remains unused, resulting in low surface area, poor cycling stability, and no other special functionality to enhance the performance. Based on earlier research and inspired by 1D and 2D materials, 3D composite materials have been synthesized via facile technologies and novel structures have been obtained. These materials usually possess favorable merits, such as large surface area, more active storage sites, faster transport paths, controllable sizes, suppression of volume expansion, and long cycling stability, and they may serve as promising battery anodes that can deliver excellent electrochemical performances.110–113
The core–shell morphology is an orderly, assembled structure consisting of a nanomaterial core covered by another shell via chemical bonds or other connection modalities.27,114,115 Due to the special characteristics of the structure, the core–shell morphology can integrate the characteristics of the inner and outer materials, as well as complement each other's deficiencies. Recently, a series of core–shell Sn4P3–C composite nanospheres with different sizes were prepared via consecutive procedures, namely, carbonization, reduction, and solvothermal phosphorization (Fig. 9a and b).60 These materials afforded different sizes ranging from 30 to 300 nm. When used as anodes for LIBs or SIBs, 30 nm-sized nanospheres tended to highly agglomerate. With regard to the maximum thickness of the 300 nm-sized nanospheres, they delivered a lower reversible capacity, probably due to the fact that the active spheres could not be easily penetrated by the ions. In contrast, 140 nm is the optimum size for the core–shell structure that could deliver the best performance and did not show higher aggregation (Fig. 9c). After charge/discharge cycling, the control samples of Sn4P3 and Sn–C electrodes exhibited structural collapse or severe aggregation, while the Sn4P3–C nanosphere electrode maintained a stable structure with nearly unchanged spherical morphology. The electrode with 140 nm-sized nanospheres could deliver long-term performance with a high specific capacity of 420 mA h g−1 for SIBs and 440 mA h g−1 for LIBs after 2000 and 500 cycles, respectively, at a high current density of 2000 mA g−1. By means of a detailed analysis, the reaction mechanism in the charge/discharge processes (for SIBs) was shown to comprise the conversion and reversible alloying processes, as shown in eqn (7)–(9): Sn4P3 + 24Na+ +24e− → Na15Sn4 + 3Na3P(7) Na15Sn4 ⇌ 4Sn + 15Na+ + 15e−(8) Na3P ⇌ P + 3Na+ + 3e−(9)

Therefore, these studies reveal the important role played by morphological control in tuning the electrochemical performance of the metal phosphides, which has a broad prospect for battery applications.
Based on the configuration of the core–shell structure, yolk shell with core, space, and shell is a new structural configuration for fabricating multiphase nanocomposites formed by introducing a void portion between the inner core and outer shell via certain technical means.117,118 Fe2P/graphitized carbon (GC) anodes for LIBs were synthesized by the hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination treatment.119 The Fe2P particles were encapsulated by hollow octahedral GC to form a yolk–shell structure, where the optimal morphology was obtained at the calcination temperature of 800 °C. The large void space between the core and shell not only retained the core–shell structure's ability to prevent particle aggregation, but also largely coordinated the expansion of Fe2P during the discharge/charge processes, which could effectively relieve capacity fading during cycling. Yolk–shell Fe2P/GC particles have a large specific surface area of 243.3 m2 g−1, favoring intimate contact between the electrode and electrolyte, providing a large number of storage sites for Li ions and reducing the diffusion distance between the ions and electrons. Therefore, the Fe2P/GC composite anodes with yolk–shell structures could deliver excellent electrochemical properties, i.e., considerable rate capabilities of 627, 592, 554, 493, and 392 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively. After the initial cycle with CE of 71.6%, the subsequent CE in the following 200 cycles were nearly 100% with a steady capacity of 627 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1.
Similar to the yolk–shell and core–shell structures discussed above, a non-core, porous wall structure is fantastic architecture where the shell is composed of the required material, and it can afford improved electrochemical performance.39,120,121 For instance, 3D porous MoP@C hybrid materials developed as anodes for LIBs were fabricated via a template sol–gel strategy using SiO2 nanospheres.116 The schematic diagram of the synthesis route is briefly shown in Fig. 9d. The 3D interconnected supports composed of adjacent successive holes can effectively accelerate the diffusion of both lithium ions and electrons, thereby promoting the permeation and diffusion of the electrolyte between the pores. Upon cycling, the electrons could easily transfer between the hybrid electrodes with high kinetics and low-resistance pathways, as revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectra. As a comparison, the nanoparticles of MoP@C and MoP were obtained in the absence of SiO2 nanospheres. According to the evaluated results, 3D porous MoP@C could potentially deliver excellent cycling performances with a reversible capacity of 1028 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles, while the other two control samples without porous structures exhibited severe capacity fading (Fig. 9d).
When a specific material contains more than two dimensions (like hierarchical structures), it may deliver a special function or beneficial performance.122,123 For instance, some materials followed by certain treatments afford 3D hierarchical structures, thereby affording unusual performance. 3D FeP@nitrogen-doped porous carbon (N,C) flowerlike hybrid materials, composed of self-assembled 2D nanosheets, were synthesized via a solvothermal method and phosphating process under low temperature and used as anodes for LIBs.37 On one hand, these 2D nanosheets could significantly relieve volume expansion along the horizontal direction during the charge/discharge process and shorten the transport pathway of lithium ions. On the other hand, 3D flowerlike architectures could remarkably prevent sheets from both aggregation and stacking. Benefiting from these unique structures and wrapped N-doped carbon, the electrodes exhibited persistently unchanged morphologies without obviously smashed sheets even after cycling. Moreover, long-term cycling performance with excellent stability and a high reversible capacity of 569 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 500 mA g−1 could be achieved in 3D FeP@N,C flowerlike hybrid materials. During the first cycle, LixFeP was formed by the insertion of Li+ into the FeP matrix, and LixFeP changed to Fe and Li3P, which was confirmed by the observed reduction peaks. The observed oxidation peaks demonstrated that the above reactions were reversible. In the subsequent cycles, the curves were highly overlapping, indicating that this hybrid material possessed good reversibility. The following intercalation and conversion reaction processes (eqn (10) and (11)) were responsible for the good performance during the discharge process. Intercalation: FeP + xLi+ + xe− → LixFeP(10) Conversion: LixFeP + (3 − x)Li+ + (3 − x)e− ⇌ Li3P + Fe(11)
Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are a type of metal–organic framework (MOF), which possess the typical advantages of MOFs, such as large specific surface areas, porous structures, and numerous carbon-containing organic ligands, as well as higher stability.124–126 As an anode material for PIBs, NC@CoP/NC polyhedron was fabricated via a high-temperature solid-phase method using NC derived from ZIF-8 (Zn nodes) and ZIF-67 (Co nodes) crystals.63 The synthesis route is shown in Fig. 10a. The SEM image shown in Fig. 10b confirms the formation of polyhedral nanostructures. The nonrigid surface of CoP endows the electrode with a low diffusion barrier that can intensify the interaction between K and P atoms, as well as help K ions diffuse more smoothly. A large number of mesopores (about 2–50 nm in size) that were well distributed on the polyhedron composite could provide massive sites for the large storage and facile kinetics of K ions. Due to these advantages, the NC@CoP/NC anode material exhibited high rate of storage for potassium of 200 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 (Fig. 10c) and stability performance of 110 mA h g−1 in 800 cycles at 500 mA g−1 (Fig. 10d).

4. Improvement strategies for metal phosphide anodes
To date, great progresses have been achieved in the syntheses and applications of nanostructured metal phosphides as promising anodes for rechargeable LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs. However, when it comes to practical applications, phosphide anodes generally suffer from the following issues: rapid capacity decay, short cycling life, and low ICE. The previous sections have outlined some commonly used methods to improve the cycling performances, such as composition control, nanostructure engineering, and incorporation of conductive networks. In this section, we mainly extend those strategies from the viewpoint of improving the ICE values.
ICE refers to the ratio of the discharge capacity over the charge capacity in the first cycle, which indicates the reversibility and available energy density of rechargeable LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs. In comparison to the high ICE of over 95% for commercial graphite anodes (in the carbonaceous electrolyte), the ICE values of most metal phosphide anodes for LIBs (Table 1) show large-range variations of ∼55–80%, suggesting considerable losses in the irreversible capacities during the first cycle. The relatively low ICE values of metal phosphides can be mainly ascribed to the following aspects: (1) irreversible electrolyte decomposition and consequent formation of the SEI layer on the electrode and (2) side reactions between the surface defects and alkali metal ions. These low ICE values are far below the ideal level for commercial LIBs, leaving a considerable room for further improvements in the ICE values in order to advance the practical applications of metal phosphide anodes. Moreover, these metal phosphides exhibit even lower ICE values (∼26–75%) when used as anodes for SIBs and PIBs. For instance, the ZIF-CoP/NC anode for PIBs exhibits ICE of 26%.63 Evidently, the relatively low ICE values of metal phosphide anodes restrain their commercial applications, and therefore, further efforts are required to improve the ICE values. In general, the main reasons for the low ICE values of anodes include the following: (1) the formation of the SEI layer accompanied by electrolyte decomposition and irreversible consumption of Li+/Na+/K+; (2) unstable morphology or structure of the active material; and (3) unidentified side reactions.127,128 It is worth noting that nanostructured anodes usually exhibit a higher decrease in the irreversible capacities over their micron-sized counterparts due to the larger contact surfaces between the electrodes and electrolytes.
To the best of our knowledge, only a few reports have focused on improving the ICE values of metal phosphide anodes. With reference to the commonly adopted strategies in addressing the low ICE values for other types of anode materials, the following strategies, namely, anode composition design, anode pretreatment, surface modification of anodes, and electrolyte optimization, would be the most efficient and promising strategies for increasing the ICE values of metal phosphide anodes.
4.1 Anode composition design
Composition design, via vacancy engineering and searching for optimized anodes with specific compositions,129 is an effective way to enhance the ICE values of metal phosphide anodes. Considering the example of Ge–P binary compounds, both GeP and GeP5 anodes in LIBs exhibit high ICE values in the range of ∼90–95%.22,32 The superior ICE values for GeP and GeP5 anodes could benefit from their intrinsic nature of metallic conduction and 2D layered structure that facilitate faster diffusion of electrons and Li ions. The layered GeP/C composite anodes exhibited self-healing behavior in the charge process, allowing the structure to reconstruct and maintain its integrity.32 Moreover, high ICE of 93% could be attained in the GeP5/C composite anodes for SIBs, which is among the highest ICE values for sodium storage anodes.75 It should be noted that another analog of 2D Ge–P binary, i.e., GeP3, demonstrated ICE of ∼70% as the anode for SIBs.130 Despite its lower ICE compared with those of GeP and GeP5, GeP3 anodes show highly reversible sodium storage capacity (1274 mA h g−1 for discharging after 150 cycles) due to the soft and tunable bonding of Ge–P.
In addition, carefully designing the anode composition to realize vacancy engineering is another important method for optimizing the electrochemical performance of anode materials. Since the creation of vacancies in anode materials can result in tunable electronic structures and abundant active sites for the storage of alkali metal ions, the band structure and electrical conductivity of SnO2 can be effectively tuned by the oxygen vacancies. An average ICE value of 77% and long cycling life could be achieved in the SnO2–Mn-graphite composite anodes for LIBs due to the beneficial role of Mn incorporation, which could suppress grain coarsening and introduce oxygen vacancies.131 Furthermore, vacancy engineering has also been applied in transition metal dichalcogenides (such as MoS2(1−2x)Se2x alloys132) to improve their energy storage properties.133 The MoSSe anode for PIBs delivered the highest ICE of 77.9% among all the MoS2(1−2x)Se2x-based anodes (MoS2, 58.9%; MoSe2, 68.5%; MoS1.5Se0.5, 72.4%).132 The MoSSe anode also demonstrated a highly reversible capacity of 220.5 mA h g−1 after cycling at 2 A g−1 for 1000 times. These appealing performances of MoSSe anodes are mainly associated with enhanced electrical conductivity, favorable K+ adsorption by active sites, and improved structural stability due to the incorporation of abundant anion vacancies and composition optimization. Therefore, it is feasible to implement vacancy engineering in metal phosphide anodes for improving their ICE values and cycling performances.
4.2 Anode pretreatment
As the initial capacity loss in LIBs/SIBs/PIBs is caused by the irreversible consumption of alkali metal ions, it is feasible to supplement additional sources of Li, Na, or K. The pretreatment process in LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs can be termed as prelithiation, presodiation, and prepotassiation, respectively. Prelithiation treatment often involves the direct reaction of anodes with prelithiation agents, such as lithium metal and lithium organic molecules. This strategy has been successfully implemented in enhancing the ICE values of C- and Si-based anodes.134–137 For example, prelithiated SiO monoxide anodes with stabilized lithium metal powder (i.e., micron-sized lithium metal powder coated with ∼2 wt% lithium carbonate) showed significant improvement in the ICE (from ∼48% to ∼90%) in a full-cell configuration.138 Moreover, lithium-biphenyl (Li-Bp)/tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution was used as the prelithiation reagent for P/C electrodes, which afforded large ICE of ∼94%—much higher than that of the pristine electrode (∼74%).134 With regard to SIBs, presodiation is also essential to supply additional sodium sources for anode materials with enhanced ICE values.139 Recently, a facile electrode-level presodiation process performed by spraying a solution of sodium naphthaline (Naph-Na) was conducted on a hard carbon anode that could significantly improve the ICE from 67% to 87%.140 This presodiation method could also be applied to other alloy- and metal–oxide-based anodes with reduced losses in the initial irreversible capacities, indicative of its broader applicability. In addition, upon the prepotassiation treatment, the P/C composite anodes for PIBs exhibited a remarkable increase in the ICE from 50.3% to 91.2%, benefitting from the complete formation of the SEI film during the prepotassiation process.141
Moreover, anode pretreatment is conducive for full-cell assembly, which can extend the cycling life and CE of the full cells. For example, prelithiation treatment was performed on porous Si–C composite anodes via precycling against a Li-foil counter electrode or direct contact with Li metal.142 Precycling the anode for 5.5 cycles in a full-cell battery could compensate for the irreversible Li loss and contribute toward improved cycling life for the full-cell configuration. In combination with these pretreatments, metal phosphide anodes are expected to deliver improved ICE values and extended cycling performances.
4.3 Surface modification of anodes
As discussed in Section 3.3, particle surface modification, such as coating carbon-based materials, has proven beneficial in improving the rate capability and cycling performance of metal phosphide anodes. This strategy could also be implemented to maintain the structural integrity and to reduce the side reactions occurring at the electrode–electrolyte interface, thereby enhancing the reversibility during cycling and improving the ICE values of the anode materials. For example, a novel 3D porous graphene aerogel was introduced as a conductive and flexible network in the CoP anode to maintain its structural integrity and to promote the transfer of electrons and ions.143 The porous CoP nanocubes encapsulated with the graphene aerogel skeleton serve as promising anode materials for LIBs, which demonstrate high ICE of 88.6% and an excellent reversible capacity (805 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1). The modified CoP anode material exhibited significant improvement in ICE over those of pristine CoP electrodes (∼65.2%) and colloidal carbon-coated CoP. In addition, FeP nanoparticles coated with P-doped onion-like carbon layers show ICE of ∼80% and long cycling life (915 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 100 mA g−1) when applied as anodes for LIBs.144 The conductive shell is supposed to provide multiple beneficial effects, including the suppression of nanoparticle aggregation, provision of a diffusion path for electrons and Li ions, and buffering of volume changes. Moreover, coating other protective layers (such as Al2O3,145 TiN,146 and TiO2 (ref. 147)) on metal phosphide nanostructures may also improve their ICE values by alleviating the surface reaction between the electrode and electrolyte.
4.4 Electrolyte optimization
Besides, electrolyte optimization is another effective strategy to improve the ICE values and cycling life of anode materials by suppressing the decomposition of electrolyte and consumption of alkali metal ions.80 This strategy has been widely applied in many promising anode materials, such as commercial graphite148 and Si anode.149,150 For example, by adding SEI-formation additives, namely, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and lithium bis(oxalate)borate (LiBOB), in the lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide-triethyl phosphate (LiFSI-TEP) electrolyte, the ICE of the graphite electrode could be further increased from 74% to 85%.148 The enhanced ICE mainly benefits from the coordination of Li+ cations by phosphate and the inhibition of unfavorable reaction between the electrode and electrolyte. However, research on electrode optimization for metal phosphide anodes is in its infancy. V4P7/5P composite anodes for SIBs demonstrate high ICE of ∼86% at 363 K in the presence of an ionic liquid electrolyte, namely, Na[FSA]–[C3C1pyrr][FSA], where FSA refers to bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide anion and C3C1pyrr refers to N-methyl-N-propyl pyrrolidinium cation.80 This is due to the appealing advantages of the ionic liquid, including its contribution to the formation of a relatively thin SEI film and the advanced compatibility with high-temperature operations.
In addition, binder optimization and microstructure design are also effective measures for boosting the ICE values of metal phosphide anodes.151,152 For instance, FeP@foam-like graphenic carbon scaffolds for PIBs exhibit increased ICE of 58.8% (from 37.2%) using the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCNa) binder to replace polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).152 Mesoporous GePx microspheres (pore size: ∼4 nm) were synthesized as potential anodes for SIBs, which afford a high reversible capacity of 1400 mA h g−1 and large ICE of ∼83%.151 In combination with these strategies, metal phosphide anodes are supposed to exhibit improved CE in the first cycle and extended life cycles, thereby serving as promising candidates for practical applications.
5. Conclusions and outlook
Herein, we provide a summary of various metal phosphides as promising anode materials for LIBs/SIBs/PIBs and we provide a timely overview of their applications in rechargeable batteries. As discussed above, plentiful metal phosphides with typical microstructures ranging from 0D to 3D have been prepared via numerous synthesis methods and strategies. These anode materials with different dimensions exhibited improved electrochemical performances, such as enhanced specific capacity, rate capability, or cycling performance, which are mainly implemented via shortened ion transport paths, fast reaction kinetics, and/or increased accommodation of volume changes. However, the same anode materials usually exhibited notably different electrochemical performances for LIBs, SIBs, and PIBs. For example, MWCNT-wrapped SiP2,49 Zn3P2 nanowires,46 and Sn4P3/C nanospheres56 have been investigated as anodes in both LIBs and SIBs, where the LIB anodes always exhibited better cycling and rate performances than the corresponding SIB anodes. As evident from Table 1, the PIB anodes usually exhibit lower specific capacities (<400 mA h g−1) than SIB anodes. Further, the cycling performance of CoP/C nanosphere anodes for PIBs is worse than that of SIBs.62 The inferior electrochemical performance of SIBs/PIBs compared with that of LIBs is mainly ascribed to the much heavier atomic mass and larger ionic radius of Na+ (or K+) over Li+ (1.02 Å/1.38 Å vs. 0.76 Å),153 which results in severer volume changes during the insertion/extraction of Na+/K+. On account of the abundant resources and reduced costs of Na and K,154 continuous efforts have been devoted toward developing suitable metal phosphide anodes for SIBs and PIBs with comparable energy densities to that for LIBs.
The main advantages of metal phosphide anodes with different dimensions are summarized as follows. Among 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D metal phosphides, 0D materials have the largest tap density, which is an important indicator in the commercial field, but their cycling stabilities and specific capacities need to be further enhanced to satisfy the rigorous requirements of practical applications. 1D materials have better potential with respect to ductility and flexibility, which are expected in wearable devices. With regard to 2D materials, the layered structures considerably facilitate the intercalation/deintercalation process of ions and ensure a relatively short time for solid-state diffusion, which can facilitate faster storage devices. Materials with novel 3D structures usually show better utilization of the internal spaces and have more active sites for storage. Under the precondition of high theoretical capacity of the constituent P, the search of new metal phosphides is in progress. In spite of these achievements in metal phosphide anode materials, there is still a considerable room for further improvements with respect to specific capacities, cycling stabilities, rate capabilities, ICE values, and other practical problems (such as cost-effective synthesis, mass production, and ambient stability). Meanwhile, the following issues have been raised, which require careful attention and tremendous research efforts: (1) precise control over the P composition should be considered (via the manipulation of defect types and concentrations), which directly affects the electrical conductivity of the as-synthesized phosphides; (2) use of specially designed binders to enhance the combination between Cu foil and certain phosphides; (3) develop suitable or exclusive electrolytes for metal phosphides to further enhance the ionic conductivity, ion migration number, and ICE values.
However, it should be noted that the appealing electrochemical performance of some metal phosphide anodes is mainly based on half coin cells. Many new challenges will arise when considering full-cell assembly in order to maximize the energy density and service life. In consideration of a full-cell design, it is critical to match the metal phosphide anodes with suitable cathodes, electrolytes, and separators to achieve excellent electrochemical performance and maximize the potential difference. The matching issues could significantly differ in different rechargeable LIBs, SIBs, or PIBs. Moreover, the potential volume changes in the metal phosphide anodes during the cycling process should also be taken into account as it could result in battery swelling and invite safety issues. The interface between the electrolyte and electrodes may suffer from passivation or the formation of the SEI layer that could prevent the diffusion of alkaline ions or reduce the ICE values. Another challenge for the development of full cells is the relatively low ICE values of nanostructured metal phosphide anodes due to their considerable contact areas that enable more surface side reactions with the electrolyte. Therefore, it is important to create a trade-off between the ICE values and other electrochemical properties, including cycling and rate performances. Moreover, a more detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms during ion insertion/extraction is necessary, which can be realized by using advanced characterization tools such as in situ XRD, in situ HRTEM, in situ Raman, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).
In consideration of the practical requirements for anode materials, the most critical objectives include high energy density, enhanced safety, and improved cycling life. To the best of our knowledge, research on metal phosphide anodes still remains at the laboratory stage, and there is a long way to go for their commercial applications. One of the main obstacles is the large-scale, cost-effective production of metal phosphides with favorable electrochemical performances. Another concern is the safety issue of metal phosphides in the full-cell configuration, which necessitates sufficient safety tests, including long cycling, overcharge/overdischarge, thermal runaway tests, and indentation tests. Therefore, with the continuous and tremendous efforts devoted in the optimization of synthesis routes, fuel-cell assembly, and in-depth understanding of alkaline metal storage for metal phosphides, we believe a few phosphide candidates could be developed and commercialized for wider applications in the near future.
