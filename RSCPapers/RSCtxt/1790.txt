    , Accepted 18th October 2021First published on 22nd October 2021AbstractPolythiophene derivatives synthesized by Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation (KCTP) have been intensively studied as potential candidates for low-cost organic solar cells (OSCs) due to their capability of scalable production. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still unsatisfactory so far. In this work, two regioregular polythiophene derivatives, P3SHT and PTST with thioalkyl chains, were prepared by KCTP. Compared to the analogue P3HT with alkyl chains, the new polymers show stronger absorption and downshifted energy levels due to the role of sulfur as a π-acceptor. The non-covalent interaction induced by sulfur also improves the crystallinity of the relevant polymers. However, the photovoltaic properties of P3SHT with thioalkyl chains are inferior to those of P3HT due to the severe phase separation in OSCs. PTST with alternating alkyl and thioalkyl chains exhibits the strongest crystallinity among these polymers since it mitigates the steric hindrance of sulfur atoms while retaining the merit of thioalkyl chains. More importantly, PTST is able to hierarchically pre-aggregate in solution, and then form a favorable morphology in OSCs, consequently yielding a superior PCE to P3HT.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their unique merits such as light weight, flexibility and high-throughput fabrication.1–4 Owing to the development of photovoltaic materials and device engineering,5–10 the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been boosted to approach the threshold of commercial application. Nevertheless, the cost of OSCs, in particular of the photovoltaic materials, is also vitally important to acquire access into the consumer market.11,12 As for state-of-the-art photovoltaic materials based on conjugated polymers, it is still a great challenge to realize manufacturing production due to the complicated synthetic processes, tedious purification and batch-to-batch variation. Among existing photoactive polymers, the family of polythiophene derivatives has been extensively investigated due to their capability of scalable production.13–16 For example, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the most widely used polythiophene can be prepared in kilogram quantities even in a research laboratory.17,18 More importantly, P3HT is synthesized by a Grignard reagent with a nickel catalyst through Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation (KCTP),19–22 which avoids the utilization of noble metal catalysts to settle the possibility of low material cost. Moreover, unlike commonly used coupling reactions (Suzuki and Stille coupling) following the step-growth polycondensation mechanism, KCTP operating through chain-growth polymerization can afford polymers with controllable molecular weight, well-defined terminal groups and excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility.23,24 Despite tremendous efforts are devoted to the meticulous optimization of P3HT-based OSCs, PCEs still lag behind OSCs based on donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating polymers.9,25–27 The trouble results from the intrinsic drawbacks of P3HT, e.g. the mismatched energy levels.7,12 Due to the strongly electron-rich characteristics of the thiophene backbone, P3HT possesses a relatively narrow absorption band limited in the visible range and the high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, while P3HT film without processing additives or post-treatment usually appears to have a relatively amorphous topography.28,29 Fortunately, the issues of absorption and energy levels in P3HT-based OSCs can be solved by incorporating new kinds of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) which have strong absorption and a high-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), eventually enhancing the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) in OSCs.30–32 Besides the innovation of NFAs, another important strategy is to modify P3HT itself. Hou et al. employed carboxylate groups as substituents on thiophene rings to obtain a polythiophene derivative, namely PDCBT. Attributed to the electron-withdrawing side chains, PDCBT shows strong and bathochromic absorption, and lower-lying HOMO and LUMO, consequently yielding a high PCE of over 10% in OSCs.33–35 Other electron-withdrawing units, e.g. fluorine and chlorine atoms, are also able to regulate the polythiophenes in a similar way.36–39 Recently, Yip and coworkers took advantage of fluorinated polythiophene incorporated with NFAs, realizing a PCE of 13.65%, which is believed to be the efficiency record for polythiophene-based OSCs.40 It is worth noting that the modified polythiophene derivatives with electron-withdrawing units also improve the fill factor (FF) of the relevant devices which is mainly determined by the morphology, including the molecular aggregation and the donor/acceptor miscibility, suggesting that the non-covalent interaction induced by the polar groups might ameliorate the disordered stacking of polythiophenes. However, another issue emerges accompanying the employment of polar groups, that the KCTP methodology is less applicable since these groups are chemically unstable in the presence of a Grignard reagent. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new polythiophene derivatives which can be prepared by Kumada coupling to synergistically ensure their low cost and high performance in OSCs.
In past decades, side chain engineering of donor polymers, as a successful molecular design strategy, has played an important role in tuning solubility, energy levels, absorption and aggregation to improve photovoltaic performance.41,42 Among varying side chains, the effectiveness of the thioalkyl chain has been well documented. When a sulfur atom is connected with the conjugated backbone, the sulfur atom has a weak electron-donating ability through 3p π-orbital overlap, but the empty 3d-orbital or the low-lying Sigma antibonding orbital of the sulfur atom facilitates the formation of pπ(C)–dπ(S) orbital overlap to make the sulfur atom perform as a π-acceptor, synergistically leading to bathochromic shifting of absorption and the downshifting of HOMO, which are conducive to absorbing more solar radiation and building a large energy difference between the donor's HOMO and the acceptor's LUMO to simultaneously enhance the Jsc and Voc. Moreover, the potential non-covalent interactions induced by sulfur might be able to improve the molecular stacking.43,44 In 2009, Li et al. studied the effect of the thioalkyl side chain on the optoelectronic properties of polythiophene derivatives.45 With the thioalkyl side chains, the absorption of random poly(3-thioalkyl)thiophene shows a slight red-shift and the HOMO energy level downshifts by 0.1 eV compared to P3HT. However, the poly(3-thioalkyl)thiophene derivatives or the di-block copolymers with (3-thioalkyl)thiophene units show inferior photovoltaic performance, even worse than the devices based on P3HT.46,47 In these cases, the decline in regioregularity of the poly(3-thioalkyl)thiophene derivatives is detrimental to their optoelectronic properties, while the sulfur atom with a large atomic radius somehow adversely affects the morphology.48 Therefore, we speculate that tuning the regioregularity and the sulfur content might be a feasible way to develop new polythiophene derivatives that preserve the merits of thioalkyl chains but avoid the adverse effects of the steric hindrance of sulfur atoms.
Herein, a regioregular polythiophene derivative, namely PTST which consists of 3-thiohexylthiophene and 3-hexylthiophene in an alternating sequence, is prepared by the KCTP methodology. Meanwhile, the analogue denoted as P3SHT, in which all of the hexyl groups are completely replaced by thiohexyl groups, is also prepared as a counterpart. The introduction of a thioalkyl chain acquires intensive and red-shifted absorption as well as downshifted energy levels, as expected. Compared to P3HT, P3SHT possesses stronger crystallinity due to the non-covalent interaction induced by sulfur. However, the enhanced crystallinity of P3SHT causes severe phase separation when blended with a non-fullerene acceptor, delivering an inferior PCE of 1.90%. Owing to the alternating side chains, PTST shows the strongest crystallinity demonstrated by the absorption spectra and X-ray scattering characterization. More importantly, PTST can pre-aggregate in solution to form a hierarchical structure which is preserved in the solid state, leading to its favorable morphology in OSCs. Based on the merits of alternate thioalkyl and alkyl chains, the PTST-based devices enhance carrier mobility and suppress charge recombination, yielding a superior PCE of 6.77% compared to that of P3HT (6.05%).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for PTST and P3SHT are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme S1.† Compounds 1 and 2 were prepared according to the literature.48 Intermediate 3 was prepared by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. To ensure the regioregularity of the polymers, selective bromination at the 5′ position of compound 3 proceeded at low temperature to yield monomer 4, followed by deprotonation to afford the active precursor. Then, the final polymer PTST was obtained by nickel-catalyzed Kumada coupling following the previous procedure.49,50 The polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, THF and chloroform. The fraction in chloroform was precipitated in methanol and recovered as a dark purple solid. The chemical structures of the related products were confirmed by 1H NMR. PTST can be dissolved in hot chloroform and chlorobenzene. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (Đ) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), wherein PTST showed a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 17.5 kDa and Đ of 1.75 (Fig. S1†). Notably, the molecular weight of PTST is carefully controlled to ensure its solubility, while the strong intermolecular interaction of polythiophene causes the overestimated Đ even when measured with a high-temperature (80 °C) GPC. In addition, P3HT and P3SHT were synthesized by a similar procedure to be utilized as counterparts. The GPC characterization illustrates that the molecular weight and Đ of P3HT and P3SHT are comparable to those of PTST (Fig. S2 and S3† and Table 1). From the 1H NMR spectra (details in the NMR Characterization Section of ESI†), all of these polymers show decent head-to-tail regioregularity, in particular P3HT and PTST.

To unravel the effect of thioalkyl chains on the molecular geometry, a theoretical simulation based on density functional theory was performed. As shown in Fig. S4,† the model of P3HT with eight thiophene rings appears to have a coplanar geometry wherein the alkyl chains are located in the same plane as the backbone. Dramatically, the introduction of thioalkyl chains negligibly affects the coplanarity of the backbone but the thioalkyl chains exhibit different spatial orientation, i.e. out of the plane of the backbone, which might result from the steric hindrance of the sulfur atoms. Such side chains might form multi-dimensional lamellar packing to build up pathways for exciton dissociation and carrier transportation.51,52 The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO were also evaluated, as shown in Fig. S5.† Apparently, both HOMO and LUMO were downshifted with the introduction of thioalkyl chains.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of these polymers were characterized by UV-vis absorption. The spectra of these polymers in chlorobenzene solution and in solid state are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S6,† and the detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. Compared to P3HT (Fig. 1b), polymers with thioalkyl side chains (Fig. 1a and c) show bathochromic and intensive absorbance, which can be ascribed to the relatively strong electron-donating ability of the thioalkyl side chains. In dilute solution, the absorption maxima of P3SHT are located at 514 nm ascribed to the absorption by the conjugated backbone, which is red-shifted by 61 nm compared to that of P3HT. Meanwhile, a weak shoulder peak at around 610 nm, attributed to aggregation, is observed in the absorption spectra of P3SHT (Fig. 1c). The solution of PTST exhibits a peak at 514 nm, the same as P3SHT although the former has only half the thioalkyl chains compared to the latter. Dramatically, two intensive peaks at 557 nm and 610 nm are present in the absorption spectra of PTST solution. Considering the peak at 610 nm is also evident in P3SHT, these two peaks are speculated to be the result of the aggregation of PTST. To confirm this, dynamic UV-vis absorption measurement was performed by changing the temperature of the PTST solution (Fig. 1a). The absorption of PTST in solution shows strong temperature dependence. By increasing the temperature from 20 to 80 °C, the peaks at 557 and 610 nm gradually weaken and eventually disappear, which confirms that these two peaks originate from the aggregation of PTST. The existence of two aggregation peaks implies the formation of hierarchical aggregation in dilute solution, which is attributed to the two-dimensional side chains demonstrated by theoretical calculation. Such a structure has been well documented to be beneficial for optimizing the morphology of the bulk-heterojunction in OSCs.53,54 In addition, the peak derived from the absorption by the conjugated backbone hypochromatically shifts from 514 nm to 488 nm with elevated temperature, which is visualized as the S⋯S interactions between thioalkyl chains and thiophene rings being broken at high temperature to increase the distortion of the backbone. In contrast, the absorption spectra of P3HT and P3SHT solutions are only slightly blue-shifted at higher temperature, indicating their negligible aggregation in solution. Notably, the absorption maxima of P3SHT remain at around 514 nm at high temperature, suggesting stronger S⋯S interactions due to the existence of more thioalkyl chains. The diversity of aggregation among these polymers produces the differences in the viscosity and the light-harvesting ability among these polymer solutions (Fig. S7†). As for the thin films (Fig. 1d), P3HT and P3SHT show obviously red-shifted absorption compared to their solutions, while the shoulder peaks at around 610 nm are raised, synergistically indicating the enhancement in aggregation in the solid state. Notably, P3SHT in this case exhibits a stronger aggregation peak compared to polymers with the same repeat unit in previous reports,45–47 since the polymers in the literature are regiorandom, which demonstrates the crucial role of regioregularity in determining the molecular packing. However, the absorption of PTST in film retains the features of that in solution, suggesting PTST has already pre-aggregated in solution and the hierarchical structure is preserved in the solid state. This merit of PTST is attributed to the thiohexyl groups enhancing the intramolecular interaction (compared to P3HT) while the limited amount of thiohexyl groups mitigates the steric hindrance from the sulfur atoms (compared to P3SHT). The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) estimated from the absorption band edge of the polymer films are listed in Table 1, as 1.92 eV (P3HT), 1.89 eV (P3SHT) and 1.89 eV (PTST), respectively. Polymers containing thioalkyl side chains have slightly narrow bandgaps compared to P3HT due to the electron-donating nature of the thioalkyl side chains.

To further unravel the effect of thioalkyl chains on energy levels, the electrochemical characteristics were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The corresponding energy level diagram and data are listed in Fig. S8† and Table 1. The values of the HOMO are estimated from the onset oxidation potentials and the LUMOs are calculated from the disparity between the HOMOs and optical bandgaps, as −5.17/−3.25 eV (P3HT), −5.20/−3.31 eV (P3SHT) and −5.19/−3.30 eV (PTST), respectively. According to previous reports,45–47 the replacement of alkyl chains with thioalkyl chains can obviously downshift the HOMO, which is attributed to the π-acceptor capability of sulfur atoms.44 Compared to P3HT, P3SHT and PTST in this case show a very slight lowering of the HOMO, which might be related to the microstructure and morphology of solid samples and the different conditions of cyclic voltammetry measurement. The tendency of the energy levels is very consistent with the results from theoretical calculations.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of these three polymers, bulk-heterojunction OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device architecture of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS/donor:O-IDTBR/PDINO/Ag. O-IDTBR (Fig. S9†) is employed as an acceptor due to its matchable absorption and energy levels with P3HT. After meticulous optimization of the fabrication conditions, the detailed photovoltaic properties of the optimal devices are summarized in Table 2 and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2a. Under the optimized conditions, the P3HT-based device exhibits a PCE of 6.05% with a Voc of 0.74 V, a Jsc of 12.11 mA cm−2 and an FF of 67.5%, which are in good agreement with the values in previous reports.31 However, the P3SHT-based device shows an extremely low PCE of 1.90% owing to the inferior Jsc (5.24 mA cm−2) and FF (48.9%). As expected, the PTST:O-IDTBR device displays the best PCE of 6.77% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 14.13 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.6%. In comparison with the P3HT-based device, the improved PCE in the PTST-based device mainly originates from the enhancement in Jsc. Thus, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these OSCs were characterized as shown in Fig. 2b. Compared to the P3HT-based device, the EQE response of the PTST-based device is obviously higher in the range from 540 to 800 nm, covering the absorption of PTST and O-IDTBR, which indicates that the photon-to-electron conversion process is operating more effectively in both donor and acceptor parts. However, the P3SHT-based device shows a very low response over the entire EQE spectra, although the absorption of the blended film is similar to those of the P3HT and PTST-based devices (Fig. S10†), suggesting the different exciton dissociation and charge transport in these devices, which will be investigated in the next section. The Jsc values calculated from the EQE spectra of the optimal devices are approximately 11.93 mA cm−2 (P3HT:O-IDTBR), 5.03 mA cm−2 (P3SHT:O-IDTBR) and 14.05 mA cm−2 (PTST:O-IDTBR), respectively, which are within the 5% error range compared to the J–V curves.

Exciton and charge behaviors
In order to reveal the mechanism of exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the devices, the variation in photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) was evaluated, as shown in Fig. 3a. Herein, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) and collection probability (Pcoll) for these devices were estimated by the ratios of Jph/Jsat in which Jph was obtained under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively. The Pdiss/Pcoll values are 95.0%/86.1%, 75.3%/64.5% and 94.5%/90.1% for the P3HT, P3SHT and PTST based devices, respectively. These results indicate that the PTST-based device has efficient exciton dissociation and charge collection, which contribute to the enhancements in Jsc and FF.

It is well known that the carrier transportation behavior greatly affects the photovoltaic properties. Thus, the charge mobilities of the optimized blended films are evaluated by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with the hole-only devices ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:O-IDTBR/MoO3/Al and electron-only devices ITO/PDINO/donor:O-IDTBR/ZnO/Al (Fig. S6†). The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the donor:O-IDTBR blend films are summarized in Table 2. The μh and μe of the P3HT:O-IDTBR blend film are 4.07 × 10−4 and 4.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, providing relatively balanced carrier transport with a μh/μe ratio of 0.86. When the hexyl side chains are completely replaced by thiohexyl groups, the P3SHT-based device exhibits an appreciable decline in charge mobility, 8.95 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh) and 1.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μe), respectively, leading to its relatively low Jsc. Compared to P3SHT, the alternating hexyl and thiohexyl side chains significantly improve the charge transport of PTST, exhibiting μh of 6.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 6.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The more balanced (μh/μe ratio: 0.96) and higher carrier mobilities in the PTST-based device rationalize the highest Jsc among these devices.
After the exciton has dissociated to form an electron and a hole, the free carriers may be quenched by charge recombination, which has an adverse effect on the Jsc and FF. The charge recombination was investigated by measuring the correlations between Voc or Jsc and light intensity (Plight). Fig. 3b shows the curves of Vocversus Plight, where the slope n (nkT/q) represents the situation of trap-assisted recombination. The devices based on P3HT, P3SHT and PTST exhibit slopes of 1.27kT/q, 1.51kT/q and 1.25kT/q, respectively. These results illustrate that the trap-assisted recombination in the PTST and P3HT based devices is effectively suppressed compared to the P3SHT-based device. The relationship between Jsc and Plight was further characterized to investigate the bimolecular recombination. This relationship is defined as Jsc ∝ (Plight)α. When the index α is close to unity, the bimolecular recombination can be neglected, suggesting all free carriers can be collected by the electrodes. As shown in Fig. 3c, the index α values of the optimal devices based on P3HT, P3SHT and PTST are about 0.95, 0.78 and 0.97, respectively. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the charge recombination, including trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination, is mitigated in the PTST-based device but has deteriorated in the P3SHT-based device compared to the P3HT-based device.
Morphological characterization
To visualize the influence of the thioalkyl chain on the microstructure and morphology, grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted. As shown in the two-dimensional (2D) patterns and corresponding 1D cutline profiles (Fig. 4), the as-cast neat film of P3HT seems to be semi-crystalline with an indistinct signal at 0.3–0.5 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, corresponding to the lamellar packing of hexyl chains. With the introduction of thiohexyl chains, the intensities of lamellar packing (q = 0.38 Å−1, d = 16.53 Å) in P3SHT and PTST neat films are greatly enhanced, attributed to the non-covalent interaction induced by sulfur atoms. Compared to P3SHT, PTST has more ordered packing, verified by the shape and intensive peak (Fig. 4g) corresponding to the lamellar packing of the side chains. The crystal coherence lengths (CCL) of PTST and P3SHT are calculated from the Scherrer equation (Table S1†), as 99.7 Å and 15.7 Å, respectively, further demonstrating the stronger crystallinity of PTST. These results are consistent with the aggregation feature in the absorption spectra. The blended films were also studied by GIWAXS (Fig. 4). The blended films present more features of O-IDTBR. The lamellar packing of P3SHT is retained in the P3SHT:O-IDTBR blend film, but the q value is 0.36 Å−1 corresponding to a large d-space of 17.45 Å, suggesting a decline in the packing order in the blended film. As for the PTST:O-IDTBR blended film, more fine peaks are evident, e.g. the lamellar packing of PTST (OOP, q = 0.39 Å−1, d = 16.10 Å) and the suborder peak of O-IDTBR (OOP, q = 0.61 Å−1), indicating that both PTST and O-IDTBR have more ordered stacking in the blended film.

As shown in the AFM images (Fig. 5), the P3HT:O-IDTBR blend film exhibits a relatively smooth topography with a small root-mean square roughness (RMS) of 1.64 nm and trivial nanowires are observed in the phase image. In contrast, the blended film of P3SHT and O-IDTBR is much rougher with a large RMS of 3.41 nm, indicating the severe phase separation which might lead to the lack of the bicontinuous network of donor and acceptor. The unfavorable phase separation in the P3SHT:O-IDTBR film might be related to the steric hindrance of sulfur atoms inhibiting the π–π stacking between donor and acceptor. Compared to P3HT:O-IDTBR, the PTST-based blended film shows more evident phase separation with an elevated RMS of 2.89 nm. Meanwhile, the different phases interpenetrate throughout the entire region of the PTST:O-IDTBR blend film. These features of PTST-based blended film are conducive to facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport, which are in perfect accordance with the photovoltaic properties.

Conclusion
In conclusion, regioregular polythiophene derivatives, P3SHT and PTST with thioalkyl side chains, were prepared by Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation. Given the electron-donating ability of thioalkyl chains, P3SHT and PTST have bathochromic and intensive absorbance compared to their analogue P3HT with alkyl side chains. Meanwhile, the effect of sulfur as a π-acceptor leads to the downshifting of the HOMO and LUMO. More importantly, the non-covalent interaction induced by sulfur atoms is able to enhance the molecular stacking demonstrated by the aggregation peaks in the absorption spectra of P3SHT and PTST. Dramatically, PTST with alternating alkyl and thioalkyl chains shows the most intensive aggregation peaks and the strongest crystallinity among these polymers. Notably, the dynamic UV-vis absorption spectrum illustrates the existence of two aggregation peaks in diluted PTST solution, indicating that PTST can pre-aggregate in solution to form a hierarchical structure which is retained in the solid state. In bulk-heterojunction OSCs wherein O-IDTBR is used as an acceptor, the enhanced crystallinity of P3SHT renders severe phase separation, and then causes poor exciton dissociation and increased charge recombination, eventually providing an inferior PCE of 1.90%. Despite PTST having the strongest crystallinity, the feature of its hierarchical structure helps the PTST:O-IDTBR blend film to achieve a relatively favorable morphology, leading to fast and balanced carrier transport, and suppressing trap-assisted and bimolecular recombination. Therefore, the PTST-based device achieves a PCE of 6.77% which is higher than its analogue P3HT (6.05%). This work provides a thorough understanding of thioalkyl chains in polythiophene derivatives, and demonstrates a fruitful way to develop polythiophene derivatives with alternating side chains by Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation to synergistically enable low-cost and high-performance OSCs.
