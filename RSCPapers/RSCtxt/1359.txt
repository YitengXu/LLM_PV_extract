    , Accepted 23rd September 2010First published on 30th November 2010AbstractPhotoinduced electron transfer in self-assembled via ion-pairing porphyrin–SWCNT nanohybrids has been reported. To accomplish this, two kinds of semiconducting SWCNTs of different diameters, and free-base or zinc porphyrin bearing peripheral positive or negative charges serving as light absorbing photo-active materials are utilized. The donor–acceptor hybrids are held by ion-pairing with the help of oppositely charged pyrene derivatives adhered to the side walls of SWCNTs. Higher charge-separation efficiency is established for thick SWCNT(7,6) with narrower band gap compared with the thin SWCNT(6,5) with wider band gap. Photoelectrochemical studies using FTO/SnO2 electrodes modified with these donor–acceptor nanohybrids unanimously demonstrated the ability of these nanohybrids to harvest light energy into electricity. Importantly, the photocurrent generation followed the trend observed for charge-separation, that is, incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency of a maximum of 8% is achieved for photocells with SWCNT(7,6), while such conversion efficiencies are smaller for the cells derived from SWCNT(6,5). These results indicate that higher light energy conversion efficiencies are possible to achieve by the selection of the appropriate SWCNTs with right band gap on combination of appropriate porphyrins.

Broader context
The study describes research aiming at solar energy conversion devices based on nanocarbons. Here, non-covalent double-decker strategy is employed to construct functional supramolecular SWCNT composites by attaching positively or negatively functionalized terminal group on pyrene ring for generating charged SWCNT composites, to which oppositely charged porphyrins are stacked with ion-pairing interactions in polar solvents. SWCNTs of different diameter, viz., enriched (6,5)- and (7,6)-SWCNTs are utilized having different band gaps. Higher charge-separation efficiency is established for donor-acceptor nanohybrids with larger diameter SWCNT(7,6) compared with smaller diameter SWCNT(6,5). Photoelectrochemical studies using these nanohybrids unanimously demonstrated the ability of these nanohybrids to harvest light energy into electricity. Importantly, the photocurrent generation followed the trend observed for charge-separation, that is, efficiency achieved for photocells with SWCNT(7,6) is higher than those with SWCNT(6,5). The results of the present study suggest the possibility of achieving higher light energy conversion efficiencies by the selection of nanotubes of appropriate diameter with right band gap on combination of suitable light-harvesting molecules such as porphyrins.

1. Introduction
Chemically functionalized single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)1–4 with molecules useful for medicinal, electronic, sensing and light-energy harvesting applications are a topic of current research interests.5–11 To functionalize without damaging the π-electronic structures of SWCNTs, non-covalent attachments seem to be promising, since they do not cause severe chemical, thermal and sonication damages to the SWCNTs.12 Among the available non-covalent functionalization approaches, the π–π stacking of appropriately sized aromatic compounds such as pyrene (Pyr)11,12 on the SWCNTs surface is found to be a viable approach. For further improvements to afford a wide variety of visible-light active functional materials, additional receptor groups on the π-interacting aromatic compounds are often introduced to induce self-assembly with the desired host compounds in order to create nanohybrids. Self-assembly mechanisms including metal–ligand axial coordination, dipole-ion pairing, ion-pairing, and hydrogen bonding have been often utilized.12c
In this context, we previously proposed a non-covalent double-decker strategy to construct functional supramolecular SWCNT composites by attaching positively or negatively functionalized group on a Pyr ring for generating charged SWCNT composites, to which molecules with opposite charges were stacked with ion-pairing interactions in relatively polar solvents.13 As photosensitizing research aiming at solar energy conversion devices, we employed the charged porphyrins (MP; M = Zn, H2) as light-energy harvesting photo-sensitizers. However, at the time, we employed a mixture with metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs with variety of diameters, making it difficult to derive any structure–reactivity relations.13
In the present study, we have utilized semiconducting SWCNT (SWCNT(n,m)) with two different diameters, enriched (6,5)- and (7,6)SWCNTs, whose characterizations are well established by various methods.14,15 As typical properties; SWCNT(7,6) has larger radius, narrower band gap, better electron-conductivity than SWCNT(6,5); thus, relevant studies on diameter-dependent photoinduced electron transfer of SWCNT with electron-donor or electron-acceptor entities in self-assembled nanohybrids have recently been reported.16 For double-decker constructions, we employed two types of porphyrin derivatives bearing either positive or negative peripheral changes, viz., (TMPyP+)M and (TPPS−)M (M = H2 and Zn), where TPPS− = sodium salt of tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin and TMPyP+ = tetrakis(N-methylpyridyl)porphyrin chloride. To link the non-charged SWCNT(n,m) to these charged porphyrins, we adhered charged Pyr derivatives on the surface of SWCNT(n,m) as shown in Scheme 1, in which PyrCOO− (pyrene butyrate) is employed for (TMPyP+)M ion-pairing, and PyrNH3+ (alkyl ammonium functionalized pyrene) for (TPPS−)M ion-pairing. Thus, we expect the formation of the SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M double-decker nanohybrids in polar solvent. This approach is expected to limit short-range excited state energy transfer due to the lack of direct contact between the donor and acceptor entities and improve charge separation within the nanohybrids instead. Photochemical and photoelectrochemical studies are performed on the donor–acceptor nanohybrids of differently charged porphyrins and the diameter selective SWCNTs to probe structure–activity aspects.

2. Results and discussion
The diameter-enriched SWCNT(6,5) and SWCNT(7,6) samples employed in the present study have average diameters of 8 and 9 Å, respectively, with an average length of 800 nm.14 The longest absorption peak of SWCNT(6,5) in solution is located at 976 nm (and 566 nm) resulting in a band gap of 1.35 eV, while for SWCNT(7,6), this absorption peak is located at 1024 nm (and 645 nm) giving a band gap of 1.21 eV.14,15 The preparation of the single-decker SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO− and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+ was performed by adding excess PyrCOO− and PyrNH3+ to SWCNT(n,m) dispersed in DMF, resulting homogeneous solution after sonication.16 Then, the double-decker supramolecules, SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M, were obtained by adding (TMPyP+)M and (TPPS−)M in DMF, respectively. Details are given in the Experimental section. From the feeds (see ESI†), one porphyrin molecule on every ca. 75 nm of SWCNT, which corresponds to 15 porphyrins per SWCNT of 800 nm length (see ESI†) is roughly estimated.
2.1 
          TEM images
        

          TEM images for the dried samples of functionalized SWCNT(n,m)s with PyrNH3+ and PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M are shown in Fig. 1. On addition of excess PyrNH3+, bundles of SWCNT(n,m) are raveled and become soluble in DMF by forming a single-decker supramolecular SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+ (Fig. 1A and B). Further addition of (TPPS−)M to produce SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M (Fig. 1C–F) caused further revealing of the wrinkled SWCNTs, corresponding to stable homogeneous DMF solution, although some entanglements appear during evaporation of DMF to make dried samples on the TEM sample grid. Furthermore, it is confirmed that large-size aggregates of the PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M are not formed. Similar TEM images were obtained for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M (see ESI, Fig. S1†).

2.2 Steady-state absorption spectral studies
One of the advantages of obtaining a homogenous dispersion of the nanohybrids is to record their optical spectroscopic properties by different techniques, which provide fundamental features of the SWCNT(n,m) nanohybrids in solution. Steady-state absorption spectra of SWCNT(n,m) nanohybrids with PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn in the UV-visible-NIR region in DMF are shown in Fig. 2 (spectrum-i) with their individual components (spectra-ii and iii). On complexing with PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn (spectrum-i), absorption bands of the pristine semi-conducting SWCNT(6,5) at 976 nm and SWCNT(7,6) at 1024 nm experienced red shift to 1020 nm and 1170 nm, respectively, thereby narrowing the band gaps by 0.1–0.2 eV. These shifts are almost the same with spectrum-ii for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−, suggesting the shifts are caused by the interaction between SWCNT(n,m)s and PyrCOO−, although the absorptions of PyrCOO− exhibiting sharp UV bands appear as absorption tails in Fig. 2 (spectra-i and -ii). The sharp peak at 420 nm in the spectrum-i is the same as the spectrum-iii of (TMPyP+)Zn, showing the Soret band and Q bands in the 420 and 550 nm range, respectively. It is important to note that no appreciable shifts of these peaks were observed upon complex formation with the SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO− supporting little or no direct π–π interactions of porphyrin with the surface of SWCNT(n,m) in the double-decker architectures shown in Scheme 1. Similar phenomena were observed for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M (see Fig. S2 in ESI†).

2.3 Energy diagrams
An energy level diagram depicting different photochemical events of the nanohybrids has been constructed using the reported electrochemical data and optical data.17–19 The oxidation potential (EOX) and reduction potential (ERED) of the porphyrin derivatives correspond to their HOMO and LUMO levels, respectively.20 In the case of SWCNT(n,m), the observed EOX and ERED correspond to the highest level of the valence-band and the lowest level of the conduction-band, in which each band width is narrow as presumed from the sharp absorption and fluorescence peaks of SWCNT(n,m) in Fig. 2.17,18 After photo-excitation of the MP moiety, an electron elevated to the LUMO transfers to the conduction-level, giving a trapped electron in SWCNT(n,m) and the MP radical cation, when the LUMO of the MP moiety is higher in energy than the conduction-band level. Such a charge-separation process is defined as CS-1 process, which results in the formation of radical ion pair (RIP) ([SWCNT]˙−,[MP]˙+). The RIP energy (ERIP(SWCNT˙−)/(MP˙+)) can be evaluated as the difference between EOX of MP and ERED of SWCNT(6,5) as listed in Table 1. Then, the free-energy change for the CS-1 (ΔGCS(SWCNT˙−)/(MP˙+))21via the lowest singlet excited state of MP (1MP*) can be evaluated to be negative (−0.45 to −0.6 eV), predicting an exothermic CS process. Although the CS-1 process is possible for nanohybrids derived from both porphyrins, the more negative ΔGCS(SWCNT˙−)/(MP˙+) values were obtained for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M (primarily due to the peripheral negative charges resulting in easier oxidation of (TPPS−)M) favoring the CS-1 process.

For (TPPS−)H2 and (TMPyP+)H2, similar values were estimated.

On the other hand, after photo-excitation of the MPs, an electron of the valence-band level of SWCNT(n,m) is possible to transfer to the vacant HOMO of the MP (CS-2), giving a hole in the valence-band level of SWCNT(n,m) and the MP radical anion ([SWCNT]˙+,[MP]˙−); thus, ERIP(NT˙+)/(MP˙−) can be evaluated as the difference between ERED of MP and EOX of SWCNT(6,5). Then, ΔGCS(SWCNT˙+)/(MP˙−) values via the 1MP* are sufficiently negative for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M, predicting an exothermic CS-2 process for these nanohybrids. In Fig. 3, as typical examples, SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M for the CS-1 process and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M for the CS-2 process are illustrated. That is, the two types of porphyrins employed here have different redox potentials as a result of peripheral negative or positive charges;20 consequently, different CS processes are envisioned; for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M, the CS-1 process tends to take place, whereas for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M, the CS-2 process is favored as illustrated in Fig. 3. Since these ΔGCS values are less than −1.0 eV, both CS processes belong to the normal region of the Marcus parabola,22 on assuming the reorganization energy is less than ca. 1.0 eV similar to the well studied fullerene–porphyrin systems.11g,f Therefore, the rate constants of both CS processes (kCS) would be anticipated to increase with the exothermicity. As for the charge-recombination (CR) processes, the ERIP values are larger than ca. 1 eV, predicting it to be in the inverted region of the Marcus parabola.22 Higher ERIP values decelerate the CR rate constants (kCR) and prolong the lifetime of the RIP (τRIP).

2.4 Fluorescence measurements
The formation of SWCNT(n,m) nanohybrids with PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M was also confirmed by the MP-fluorescence measurements, which also gives information about the excited state events in the hybrids. The steady-state fluorescence spectra of (TMPyP+)H2 along with the SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)H2 hybrid in DMF observed with excitation wavelength (λex) of 425 nm, predominantly exciting the H2P moiety, are shown in Fig. 4. The (TMPyP+)H2 (blue line) exhibits fluorescence peaks at 650 and 720 nm due to the H2P moiety. In the hybrids with SWCNT(n,m), the (TMPyP+)H2-fluorescence intensity was found to be quenched by over 90% of its original intensity, suggesting occurrence of excited state events such as electron transfer or energy transfer via1(TMPyP+)H2*.13,23 Also, the hybrids with SWCNT(7,6) quenched the H2P-fluorescence intensity more than the hybrid of SWCNT(6,5). Efficient fluorescence quenching was also observed for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn hybrid exhibiting fluorescence bands at shorter wavelengths (635 nm main peak with 675 nm shoulder; see Fig. S3 in ESI†). Similar emission trends were observed for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M hybrids (see Fig. S3 in ESI†).

In order to obtain kinetic data of the singlet excited state of the H2P moiety (1H2P*), picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements were performed with streak-scope method. The time profiles collected for the (TMPyP+)H2-fluorescence in the nanohybrids with SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO− are shown in Fig. 5 in comparison with pristine (TMPyP+)H2. The H2P-fluorescence intensity followed a mono-exponential decay with a lifetime of 4010 ps (=(τF)ref). Addition of SWCNT(6,5) and SWCNT(7,6) to form the hybrids accelerated the H2P-fluorescence decay; at a glance, the latter accelerated decay much faster than the former, in agreement with the degree of steady-state fluorescence quenching in Fig. 4. These fluorescence time profiles could be curve-fitted to a bi-exponential decay function; the shorter components ((τF)nanohybrid) are evaluated as 480 ps (fraction (Fr) = 88%) for SWCNT(6,5) and 260 ps (Fr = 94%) for SWCNT(7,6), and the remaining longer components are attributed to the non-interacting porphyrin entities. The (τF)nanohybrid evaluated under similar conditions are summarized in Table 2, in which the Fr values of the shorter components are in the range of 68–94% (see Fig. S4 in ESI† for additional fluorescence decay curves). For M = H2, the (τF)nanohybrid values were found to be 260–580 ps with Fr = 68–94%. For M = Zn, the (τF)nanohybrid values were found to be 110–290 ps with Fr =78–94%. These fast decaying components serve as an additional evidence for the formation of nanohybrids with SWCNTs. Compared with SWCNT(6,5), the (τF)nanohybrid values for SWCNT(7,6) are short in each porphyrin composite in DMF.

As proved in our previous study,13 the shortening of the fluorescence lifetimes is ascribed to the CS process via1MP*. The kCS and ΦCS were calculated from the differences between (τF)nanohybrid and (τF)ref as summarized in Table 2. The evaluated kCS values are in the range of (2.0–8.1) × 109s−1, which are reasonable values as the CS proceeds via1MP* to the SWCNT through or over the ion pairs. The overall ΦCS values are larger than 0.85; by considering the Fr of the short (τF)nanohybrid alone representing the fraction of the complexes, the ΦCS values are larger than 0.64. For each porphyrin, the kCS and ΦCS values for SWCNT(7,6) with larger diameter are higher than those for SWCNT(6,5) with smaller diameter. Usually, the kCS and ΦCS values increase with the −ΔGCS values listed in Table 1. Instead, the ΔGCS(SWCNT˙+)/(MP˙−) values for SWCNT(7,6) are more negative (more exothermic) than those for SWCNT(6,5), suggesting a faster CS process under the normal region of the Marcus parabola.22 However, the ΔGCS(SWCNT˙−)/(MP˙+) values for SWCNT(7,6) are almost the same as the corresponding value for SWCNT(6,5), which could not explain the observed small differences in the kCS and ΦCS values. Comparison between SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M gives the tendency that the latter CS process is faster than the former CS process, which is also along the order of −ΔGCS(SWCNT˙+)/(MP˙−) values.
For other factors to determine the CS rates, the geometrical factor needs to be considered; for example, larger diameter SWCNT(7,6) has a chance to approach the large porphyrin molecules directly with wider π–π interaction.
2.5 Nanosecond transient absorption studies
Evidence for CS can be obtained from the transient absorption spectral studies by the observation of the radical ions, of which decays can afford the kCR values. The nanosecond transient absorption spectra of the SWCNT(7,6)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)Zn nanohybrids observed by the 532 nm laser light, which predominantly excites the ZnP moiety are shown in Fig. 6. Importantly, a transient absorption peak corresponding to the formation of the ZnP radical cation ([(TPPS−)Zn]˙+) was evident around 680 nm.11 As a pair of the ZnP˙+ unit in the photoinduced CS process in the supramolecular nanohybrid, the trapped electron on the SWCNT (expressed as [SWCNT]˙−) would be anticipated. In the NIR region, broad absorption bands were observed around 1400 nm, which can be assigned to [SWCNT(n,m)]˙−, although further studies are needed to confirm this assignment.24 The rise of the [(TPPS−)Zn]˙+ around 680 nm was found to be fast within the nanosecond laser pulse (6 ns) (see the time profile in Fig. 6 inset), which corresponds to the CS process within 140 ps as estimated from the ZnP-fluorescence lifetime. After reaching a maximum just after the laser pulse (6 ns), the absorption of [(TPPS−)Zn]˙+ around 680 nm begins to decay within 500–1000 ns. From the first-order fitting to the decay curve, the kCR value of [SWCNT(7,6)]˙−/PyrNH3+/[(TPPS−)Zn]˙+ was evaluated to be 6.1 × 106s−1 in DMF. Using the kCR value, the RIP-lifetime, τRIP (=1/kCR) was evaluated to be ca. 160 ns, indicating that the RIPs persist for some extent in the supramolecular nanohybrid in DMF.

On assuming the occurrence of the CS-2 process for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M, the observation of [SWCNT]˙+ and [(TMPyP+)M]˙− would be anticipated. Expectedly, slightly broader transient absorption bands were observed (see Fig. S5 in ESI†). As for [(TMPyP+)M]˙−, the absorption band has been reported in a few studies,25 to show weak absorptions in the visible region. As for [SWCNT(n,m)]˙+, the broad absorption band in the NIR region is identified.26 This implies that this type of the CS process cannot be denied from the transient absorption spectra in Fig. 6.
For SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M, the first-order decay time profiles were observed at 680 nm and 1400 nm, giving the kCR and τRIP as listed in Table 3, to which the ratios of kCS/kCR are added. The kCS/kCR values can be used as a kinetic measure of the charge accumulation for utilization of the electron-hole pair in the nanohybrids under light illumination. For each porphyrin, the kCR values for SWCNT(7,6) are slightly larger than those for SWCNT(6,5) by about 1.5 times; vide infra for τRIP values. Since the kCS values for SWCNT(7,6) are larger than those for SWCNT(6,5) by about 2–3 times, the kCS/kCR values are large for SWCNT(7,6) than those for SWNT(6,5).

At this stage, these kCS/kCR values for SWCNT(n,m) can be compared with the previously studied mixture containing metallic and semi-conducting SWCNTs; the mixture of SWCNTs has quite small kCS/kCR values in the 100–300 region for the same set of porphyrins,13 indicating semi-conducting SWCNTs are favorable for long charge accumulation.
2.6 Electron-pooling measurements
In order to further confirm the occurrence of CS process leading to the formations of [SWCNT(m,n)]˙−/PyrCOO−/[(TMPyP+)Zn]˙+ and [SWCNT(m,n)]˙−/PyrNH3+/[(TPPS−)Zn]˙+, additional electron-mediation experiments are performed by the addition of the second electron acceptor, hexyl viologen dication (HV2+) and a sacrificial electron donor, 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) to the hybrid solution.27 By the steady-state absorption spectral measurements after the repeated laser-light irradiation with 532 nm laser light, which predominantly excites the ZnP moiety in the nanohybrids but not the additives (HV2+ and BNAH), the accumulation of HV˙+ is observed at 620 nm as shown in Fig. 7. The concentration of the accumulated HV˙+ increased with the BNAH concentration, supporting the role of BNAH as a sacrificial hole shifting reagent.27 This observation implies that the electron pooling is induced by the light illumination of the ZnP moiety in SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn. The overall maximal absorbance of HV˙+ was observed in the presence of 0.5 mM of HV2+ and 4.0 mM of BNAH; thus, maximal concentration of HV˙+ was evaluated to be 0.21 mM, which amounts to 42% conversion of added HV2+ for SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn. For other systems (see Fig. S6 in ESI†), the maximal conversions (ΦHV˙+) are listed in Table 3, from which the ΦHV˙+ values for SWCNT(7,6) are higher than those for SWCNT(6,5) for each porphyrin. For each SWCNT(n,m), the ΦHV˙+ values proportionally increase with the kCS/kCR values.
 Fig. 7  Steady-state absorption spectra of SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)Zn in Ar-saturated DMF solution measured after five laser-shots (6 ns pulse width and 3 mJ per pulse) at 532 nm in the presence of HV2+ (0.5 mM) and BNAH (i) 0, (ii) 0.5, (iii) 1.0, (iv) 1.5, (v) 2.0, (vi) 2.5, (vii) 3.0, (viii) 3.5, and (ix) 4.0 mM. 
The mechanism for this electron-pooling process can be understood on combining the above porphyrin-fluorescence quenching and transient absorption spectral measurements, showing the generation of [MP]˙+ and probable [SWCNT]˙− within the nanohybrids. The electron trapped in SWCNT upon light-induced CS process transfers to HV2+, generating HV˙+ as the electron pooling product. The BNAH neutralizes irreversibly MP˙+ in the nanohybrids, giving BNAH˙+, which is further converted to BNA+.27 These mechanisms of the efficient photosensitized CS/electron-migration/hole-shift processes of the SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M nanohybrids are illustrated in Scheme 2.

2.7 Photoelectrochemical studies
Encouraged by the observed photoinduced charge-accumulation ability of the investigated nanohybrids, photoelectrochemical studies were performed to visualize their ability to convert light into electricity. For this study, the nanohybrids were drop-coated on SnO2-modified FTO electrode surface.28 The photocurrent action spectra of FTO/SnO2/nanohybrid in a mediator solution of 0.5 M LI and 0.1 mM I2 in acetonitrile with Pt gauze electrode as a counter electrode are shown in Fig. 8. The spectra of monochromatic incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE)29vs. wavelength show a main peak at 420 nm and a weak one at 550–650 nm, which closely resembles the porphyrin peak of the nanohybrids absorption spectrum in Fig. 2, indicating that these nanohybrids on the electrode surface are indeed responsible for photocurrent generation.

The figure insets show photo-switching curves for the indicated electrodes. 
At the wavelength of the maximum current, the IPCE is found to be nearly 8% for the photocell with SWCNT(7,6)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)Zn modified electrode. For the photocells having electrodes modified with other nanohybrids, the IPCE values are smaller. Importantly, the IPCE values are much higher for the electrodes derived from (7,6)SWCNT compared to those derived from (6,5)SWCNT,16 except for SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)H2, showing similar values for both SWCNT(n,m)s. Additionally, as shown in the figure inset, the light-switching experiments yielded reproducible values suggesting high stability of the nanohybrids in the photocell.
Although proportional relations were found for ΦHV˙+vs. the kCS/kCR values, such clear relation was not found for maximal IPCE at 420 nm, suggesting that other important factors governing the IPCE must be also considered; viz., the morphology on the electrode surface, electron-injection rates from [SWCNT(m,n)]˙−,[MP]˙+ (or [SWCNT(m,n)]˙+,[MP]˙−) to SnO2/FTO, role of the electron mediator, etc.
3 Summary
We have successfully prepared self-assembled SWCNT(n,m)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(n,m)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M nanohybrids in DMF. Photoinduced CS process via the excited singlet state of porphyrin moiety vs. SWCNTs was confirmed by the fluorescence quenching and transient absorption measurements, in addition to the electron-mediating experiments. Photoelectrochemical studies performed on FTO/SnO2 modified electrodes unanimously demonstrated the ability of these nanohybrids to harvest the light energy into the electricity.
In these measurements, appreciable differences are recognized between the two semi-conductive SWCNT(n,m)s with different diameters; that is, efficiency of the CS process, electron pooling and photocurrent generation efficiencies are higher for SWCNT(7,6) with a larger diameter and narrower band gap compared with SWCNT(6,5) with a wider band gap. This trend is in good agreement with the efficiency of the photoinduced CS efficiencies measured with the HV˙+-accumulation conversion and kCS/kCR in the present study. These results indicate a prospective to achieve higher efficiency of photoinduced processes by the selection of the appropriate SWNTs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Chemicals
The (6,5) and (7,6) enriched SWCNTs were produced by CoMoCAT®, SouthWest Nano Technologies, Inc. (Norman, OK) marketed by Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, WI). The bulk solvents utilized in the syntheses were from Fischer Chemicals, while all of the water soluble porphyrins were from Midwest Chemicals, Chicago (IL) and were purified over Sephadex LH20 column prior using.
4.2. Preparation of SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO− and SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO− nanohybrids
Nanohybrids were synthesized by a slight modification of our previous method.30 In a typical synthesis, 2 mg each of SWCNT(6,5) and SWCNT(7,6) were taken in round bottom flask. To this 4 mg of pyrene butyric acid were added and dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture was sonicated (Misonix ultrasonicator, XL-2000, 10 W) for 1 h at 20 °C followed by centrifugation (Fisher Scientific, 50/60 CY) for 2 h. Unbound pyrene butyric acid was removed by separating the supernatant from black precipitate. Further purification was carried out by dissolving the black mixture in fresh DMF (5 mL), sonicating for 30 min at 20 °C, followed by centrifugation for 1 h. This process was repeated until the solution in the centrifuge tube turned colorless. Finally, fresh solvent (10 mL) was added to the resulting deposit and then the suspension was sonicated for 5–10 min at 20 °C. This homogenous black dispersion was stable at room temperature and used in the studies.
4.3. Preparation of SWCNT(6,5)/PyrNH3+ and SWCNT(7,6)/PyrNH3+ nanohybrids
About 2 mg of SWCNT(6,5) or SWCNT(7,6) were taken in round bottom flask and 4 mg of pyrene ammonium cation were added and dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL) followed by stirring the reaction mixture for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture was sonicated for 1 h at 20 °C followed by centrifugation for 2 h. Free pyrene ammonium cation was removed by separating the supernatant from black precipitate. Further purification was carried out by dissolving the black mixture in fresh DMF (5 mL), sonicating for 30 min at 20 °C, followed by centrifugation for 1 h. This process was repeated until the solution in the centrifuge tube turned colorless. Finally, fresh solvent (10 mL) was added to the resulting deposit and then the suspension was sonicated for 5–10 min at 20 °C. This homogenous black dispersion was stable at room temperature and used for the studies.
4.4 Preparation of SWCNT(6,5)/and SWCNT(7,6)/Pyr/porphyrin ion-paired nanohybrids
Based on the primary electric charge on the nanohybrid surface, two types of SWCNT/Pyr functionalized nanohybrids were prepared. In the first preparation, positively charged SWCNT/Pyr functionalized nanohybrids (such as SWCNT(6,5)/PyrNH3+ and SWCNT(7,6)/PyrNH3+) were treated with (TPPS−)Zn and (TPPS−)H2. In a typical synthesis, SWCNT(6,5)/PyrNH3+ and SWCNT(7,6)/PyrNH3+ were treated with negatively charged porphyrin (TPPS−)Zn and (TPPS−)H2 in 10 mL dry DMF and were sonicated for 30 min at 20 °C followed by centrifugation for 2 h. Unbound porphyrins were removed by separating the supernatant from black precipitate. In this way we have the following pairs of nanohybrids: SWCNT(6,5)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M and SWCNT(6,5)/PyrNH3+/(TPPS−)M, M = Zn or H2.
In the second preparation, negatively charged SWCNT/Pyr functionalized nanohybrids (such as SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO− and SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO−) were treated with (TMPyP+)Zn and (TMPyP+)H2. In a typical synthesis, SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO− or SWCNT(7,6)/PyrCOO− were treated with positively charged porphyrin (TMPyP+)Zn and (TMPyP+)H2 in 10 mL dry DMF and were sonicated for 30 min at 20 °C followed by centrifugation for 2 h. Unbound porphyrins were removed by separating the supernatant from black precipitate. In this way we have the following pairs of nanohybrids: SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M and SWCNT(6,5)/PyrCOO−/(TMPyP+)M, M = Zn or H2.
4.5 Preparation of nanocrystalline SnO2 electrodes
These were prepared according to the literature procedure with a few modifications.31 A 10 µL of SnO2 colloidal solution (Alfa Aesar, 15%) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol; a 500 µL of NH4OH was added to this solution for stability. About 0.5 mL of colloidal solution was placed on an optically transparent electrode, fluorine doped indium tin oxide (FTO) (Pilkington TEC-8, 6–9 Ω per square) and dried in air. The electrodes were annealed in an oven for an hour in air at 673 K. The estimated thickness of the electrode was around 1–2 µm.
4.6. Instrumentation
The UV-visible-NIR spectral measurements were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer (Lamda 750) or Jasco V-670 spectrophotometers. The steady-state fluorescence emission was monitored by using a Perkin-Elmer (LS-55) or a Horiba Jobin Yvon Nanolog UV-visible-NIR spectrofluorometer equipped with PMT (for UV-visible) and InGaAs (for NIR) detectors. All the solutions were purged prior to spectral measurements using nitrogen gas.

Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) measurements were recorded by applying a drop of the sample to a copper grid after drying. Images were recorded on a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV for imaging.
The time-resolved fluorescence spectra were measured by a single photon counting method using a streak-scope (Hamamatsu Photonics, C5680) as a detector and a laser light (Hamamatsu Photonics M10306, laser diode head, 408 nm) as an excitation source. Lifetimes were evaluated with software attached to the equipment.
Nanosecond transient absorption measurements were carried out using THG (532 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, Quanta-Ray GCR-130, 5 ns fwhm) as an excitation source. For transient absorption spectra in the NIR region (600–1200 nm) and the time-profiles, monitoring light from a pulsed Xe lamp was detected with a Ge-APD (Hamamatsu Photonics, B2834). For the measurements in the visible region (400–1000 nm), a Si-PIN photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, S1722-02) was used as a detector.
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed in a two-electrode configuration using desired nanohybrids drop coated FTO/SnO2 electrode and a platinized FTO electrode as counter electrode. A mixture of I−/I3− in acetonitrile was used as redox mediator. The photocurrent–photovoltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Model 2400 Current/Voltage Source Meter of Keithley Instruments, Inc. (Cleveland, OH) under illumination with an AM 1.5 simulated light source using a Model 9600 of 150 W Solar Simulator of Newport Corp. (Irvine, CA). A 340 nm filter was introduced in the light path to eliminate UV radiation. The light intensity was monitored by using an Optical Model 1916-C Power Meter of Newport. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under ∼2.5 mW cm−2 monochromatic light illumination conditions using a setup comprising 150 W Xe lamp with a monochromator (Newport Corp., Irvine, CA).

Broader context
The study describes research aiming at solar energy conversion devices based on nanocarbons. Here, non-covalent double-decker strategy is employed to construct functional supramolecular SWCNT composites by attaching positively or negatively functionalized terminal group on pyrene ring for generating charged SWCNT composites, to which oppositely charged porphyrins are stacked with ion-pairing interactions in polar solvents. SWCNTs of different diameter, viz., enriched (6,5)- and (7,6)-SWCNTs are utilized having different band gaps. Higher charge-separation efficiency is established for donor-acceptor nanohybrids with larger diameter SWCNT(7,6) compared with smaller diameter SWCNT(6,5). Photoelectrochemical studies using these nanohybrids unanimously demonstrated the ability of these nanohybrids to harvest light energy into electricity. Importantly, the photocurrent generation followed the trend observed for charge-separation, that is, efficiency achieved for photocells with SWCNT(7,6) is higher than those with SWCNT(6,5). The results of the present study suggest the possibility of achieving higher light energy conversion efficiencies by the selection of nanotubes of appropriate diameter with right band gap on combination of suitable light-harvesting molecules such as porphyrins.
