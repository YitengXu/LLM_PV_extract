    , Accepted 28th January 2022First published on 29th January 2022AbstractConsidering the increasing demand for fertilizers to support the global food supply, as well as the high-energy consumption and environmental concerns caused by industrial nitrogen fixation (i.e., Haber–Bosch process), there is a critical need to develop and integrate more sustainable, green-chemistry-based processes of nitrogen fixation. As a prominently electrified Power-to-X (where X stands for chemicals, fuels, and other high-value products) approach, non-thermal plasmas generated by the spark and gliding arc discharges are highly promising to meet the required criteria, especially when the power and the electrified chemical reactions are precisely dosed and timed using nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasmas. However, the underlying mechanism for NOx formation in plasmas is a stumbling block for further green chemistry process developments. Here, a nanosecond pulsed spark discharge based on a plate-to-plate configuration was developed for sustainable nitrogen fixation at ambient conditions. Outstanding energy efficiency of 4–11 g kW h−1 and a concentration of 960–10900 ppm for NOx formation were obtained with the varied airflow rates ranging from 40 to 340 mL min−1. Using the optical emission spectroscopy and the chemical kinetics model, we found that the key intermediate species involved in NOx reaction pathways strongly depend on the plasma parameters and species residence time in spark discharges. It is revealed that more than 50% of the generated NO originate from the chain reactions of O and N radicals with vibrationally excited N2 and O2 molecules (O + N2(υ) → NO + N and N + O2(υ) → NO + O). Most NO2 molecules are formed by further oxidation of NO species (NO + O → NO2). The presence of O and N spectral lines at the post-discharge stage further confirmed the important role of free-radical-chain reactions. These results provide new insights into sustainable and decentralized NOx production, and deeper understanding of the plasma-based green chemistry will guide the optimization and practical applications of the plasma-based power-to-chemical nitrogen fixation.
Introduction
Over the past century, the Haber–Bosch (H–B) process has been developed to support the ever-increasing food supplies for nearly half of the world population. The H–B process is used to synthesize ammonia (NH3) over iron or ruthenium-based catalysts under high pressures (150 to 300 atm) and temperatures (400 to 500 °C). However, the process consumes 1.4% of the world's total energy output and contributes to the generation of 300 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.1 Further improvement of the H–B process, in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, is hindered by the unavoidable constraints in the process conditions dictated by fundamental thermo-kinetic considerations.2,3 Hence, energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternatives for NH3 synthesis are urgently needed, especially the green-chemistry, light- or electricity-driven processes (i.e., photo-catalysis, electro-catalysis and non-thermal plasma) using renewable energy (i.e., solar and wind), to near the ultimate goal of zero carbon emissions.4–7
As an electrically driven process, non-thermal plasmas (NTPs) have been extensively investigated as an alternative for decentralized NOx or ammonia production powered by renewable clean energy sources.8 Emerging NTP-enabled nitrogen fixation processes are used to convert N2/H29–12 or N2/H2O13,14 directly to NH3. The N2/H2 reaction pathway is the most widely investigated approach, which usually relies on a dielectric barrier discharge reactor packed with catalysts. However, the hydrogen species in the process come from high-purity H2, which is obtained from energy and carbon-intensive reforming processes.5 The N2/H2O reaction pathway faces the constraint of energy efficiency, though it avoids the problem of H2 production and may be free of catalysts using a plasma electrolytic system.13 On the other hand, the indirect approach involving the plasma nitrogen oxidation (N2 → NOx) and further catalytic reduction to ammonia (NOx → NH3) have been proposed, with the obtained energy efficiency of 4.6 MJ mol−1 NH3, which is more than four times lower than the state-of-the-art plasma-enabled NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2 with reasonable yields (>1%).6,15,16
Prior to the H–B process, a plasma-based nitrogen fixation approach, namely the Birkeland–Eyde process, was commercialized to convert N2 and O2 to nitrates (NOx) by forming an electrical arc in air.17 In recent years, various plasma discharge modes have been studied for NH3 synthesis, including transient spark discharge18–25 and gliding arc discharge26–28 plasmas, which are attractive for their reasonable energy efficiency (the best energy efficiency reported to be ∼32 kW h kg−1) and the ability to be used along with the common electrocatalytic processes,6,15,16 though the energy efficiency is still inferior to the H–B process.2,18
The transient spark discharge is usually triggered by a nanosecond repetitive pulse (NRP) power source29–40 to effectively restrain the spark-to-arc transition by the short pulse voltage. From an economic point of view, the transient spark discharge device is compact in size, low in cost, and easy to scale up. During the discharge, the spark channels can be quickly formed and maintained for a long time, and the active species (i.e., electrons, vibrational-state molecules and free radicals)29 and the gas temperature (Tg, ∼3000 K)21 in these discharge channels have been found suitable for nitrogen oxidation reactions (1) and (2).41,42 N2 + O2 → 2NO, ΔH = 180 kJ mol−1(1) 2NO + O2 → 2NO2, ΔH = −114 kJ mol−1(2)
Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism for NOX production in an NRP spark discharge is still unclear, hindering further process optimizations and developments. The Zeldovich thermal mechanism have been proposed43 in fuel combustion research to control the NO production, as shown in reactions (3) and (4).22 O + N2 → NO + N(3) N + O2 → NO + O(4)
N and O free radicals initiated by the thermal decomposition of N2 and O2 at high temperatures (∼1500 K), act as initiators of NO production.44 The first Zeldovich reaction (3) plays a major role in NO formation in high-temperature environments.45,46 Recently, using a zero-dimensional chemical kinetics model, Wang et al. proposed that vibrational excitation of N2 can overcome the reaction energy barrier of the non-thermal Zeldovich reaction and can thus significantly enhance the production of NO in the gliding arc discharge in air.28 Moreover, the Tg of the typical gliding arc discharge is not high. It is thus likely that its energy efficiency is far away from the theoretical limit.28
Previously, a two-step N2-to-NH3 fixation through the serial integration of plasma-driven N2 oxidation with electrocatalytic nitrogen oxyanions reduction to NH3 was demonstrated, with an NRP air spark discharge used for N2 oxidation.47 However, the issue of decoupling the challenges of molecular activation and product selectivity still remains.47 Here we address the above issues and provide new insights and guiding principles for renewable chemicals production. This work reveals the underlying reaction mechanisms for sustainable nitrogen fixation in NRP plasmas in spark discharges in air by the combinatorial experiments, process diagnostics and modeling investigations.
Experimental
Experimental details
A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1(a), which consists of three parts: the gas distribution system (blue arrow), the electrical system (red lines) and the signal measurement system (green lines). The gas distribution system is comprised of air generator (with the max yield of 500 mL cm−1 and the pressure of 0.4 MPa), plasma reactor, and gas component analysis system. Two mass flow controller (MFC, SEVEN STAR-D07), and a soap film flow meter were employed to measure the gas flow rate. In the plate-to-plate plasma reactor, two stainless-steel plates (diameter 12 mm, thickness 5 mm) with the fixed gas gap (3 mm) were placed inside the quartz tube and used as ground and high voltage electrodes, respectively. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Thermo-Fisher Nicolet IS50) with a Herriott cell (optical path length of 2.4 m and volume of 100 mL) was employed to detect and measure the gaseous products. The electrical system consists of an NRP power supply and an electrical signal measurement system. The NRP power source (HV-2015), which can generate stable repetition frequency pulses, is triggered by a pulse modulator. It provides an applied voltage peak of 15 kV, and the rising and falling edges can be adjusted within the range of 50–500 ns. The applied voltage and discharge current were measured by a high voltage probe (Tektronix P6015, 75 MHz, 1000/1) and a Rogowski coil (Pearson 6585, 1 V A−1) through an attenuator (−20 dB), respectively, and recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 2024). A grating spectrograph (Zolix, Omni-λ500i) coupled with a high frame rate enhanced sCMOS camera (Andor, iStar-sCMOS-18U-73) was used to capture the optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The signal measurement system is comprised of the trigger TTL signal from the NRP power and the feedback TTL signal from the sCMOS camera. The signals are also recorded by the oscilloscope. A photograph of the reactor can be seen in our previous article47 and the discharge image is shown in Fig. 1(a), taken by a Canon EOS 500D camera with an exposure time of 0.5 s and an ISO of 400.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus; (b) typical discharge voltage and current waveform of the NRP discharge, with an inset of input energy and instantaneous power. 
The energy efficiency of the products was investigated. The input energy E is defined as follows: (5)where U(t) and I(t) are the discharge voltage and current, f is the pulse repetition frequency. The energy efficiency (EE) in g kW h−1 was defined as follows: (6)where C and M are the concentration and molar mass of the products, respectively, Qafter is the total gas velocity after the reaction, and P is the discharge power.

Fig. 1(b) shows typical voltage and current waveforms of the NRP spark discharge within one discharge period. The inset shows the time evolution of the energy input and instantaneous power consumption. The pre-set pulse parameters are the pulse voltage of 7.5 kV, pulse rise time of 100 ns, pulse peak width of 100 ns, the pulse fall time of 100 ns, repetition frequency of 1 kHz. After the air gap breakdown occurs at 6.7 kV, the applied voltage drops instantly, and the discharge current rises to its peak amplitude of ∼80 A at ∼300 ns. Subsequently, the reverse and forward current pulses appear alternately, with lower current amplitudes and larger current pulse widths. The negative current that appeared in the typical U–I waveforms may be due to the underdamped oscillation of the RLC series circuit. Accordingly, the energy input is dominated by the first forward current pulse (∼8 mJ) and the second reverse current pulse (∼3 mJ) and reaches a constant value at 11.56 mJ. The average energy input for five measurements is 11.62 mJ, with the corresponding power consumption of 11.62 W for a repetition frequency of 1 kHz.
Zero-dimensional plasma kinetics model
We developed a zero-dimensional plasma kinetics model to investigate the key intermediate species and chemical pathways for its advantages in data reliability and the ability to resolve time evolution of the main plasma parameters, while keeping the computational simplicity. The plasma kinetics solver ZDPlasKin36,48–50 was used to obtain the time evolution of steady-state or time-dependent species densities and the generation or consumption rates (the species densities of the reactants and the corresponding reaction rate coefficients) of the various reactions in the plasma. The time evolution of various species density in the model was based on the particle conservation equation: (7)where ni is the density of species i, aRightij and aLeftij represent the stoichiometric coefficients of the right, and left sides of specie i in reaction j, kj is the reaction rate coefficient and nLeftl is the density of the l-th reactants in reaction j.
52 species are accounted for in the kinetics model which are listed in Table 1, including charged species and neutral, predominantly excited species. The model's 688 reactions contain electron impact (ionization, recombination, excitation, de-excitation, dissociation, attachment, and detachment) reactions, as well as account for ions and neutral species that react with each other as well as VT and VV transitions based on the plasma kinetics of nitrogen–oxygen mixtures.51 The rate coefficients of the electron impact reactions based on the collision cross sections calculated by the BOLSIG+ solver (solution for Boltzmann equation51,52) and corresponding reaction rate coefficients of electron impact de-excitation are calculated using the principle of detailed balance. For reactions between the ground and first excited levels in VT and VV transitions (listed in Table 2), we calculate these rate coefficients based on Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) theory. Here, the Tg is set as 3000 K (estimated using the Gibbs free energy equation adopted from Li et al.21) at the maximum current and drops to room temperature rapidly after 2400 ns. The parameter setting of reduced electric field, electron temperature and density are validated by experimental data, including the time-resolved U–I curve and OES diagnosis. The diameter of the spark channel was assumed sufficiently large for the reactions to occur within it (e.g., much larger than the diffusion length during the reaction and much smaller than the “diameter” of the “density-uniform” gas flow).

Results and discussion
Plasma nitrogen fixation performance
The FT-IR detected various gaseous products (i.e., NO2, NO, N2O, N2O4, HNO3) after the NRP spark discharge.21,42,53Fig. 2(a) shows the presence of NO2 vibrational bands at 1630 cm−1 and 2916 cm−1, with relatively weak NO at 1900 cm−1, N2O at 2250 cm−1, N2O4 at 1261 cm−1, 1763 cm−1, and 2976 cm−1 and HNO3 at 1325 cm−1 and 1718 cm−1. O3 vibrational bands at 1055 cm−1 are not found under our experimental conditions. The experiment adopted the standard method to obtain the concentration of gaseous products. A standard gas of 1 vol% NO/Ar and 1 vol% NO2/Ar were mixed with high-purity nitrogen in various proportions to obtain the mixed gas with a concentration in the range of 0.18–1 vol%. The characteristic spectral peaks of NO and NO2 in the range of 1880 cm−1–1950 cm−1 and 2850 cm−1–2940 cm−1 were integrated, respectively, and the corresponding gas ratio and characteristic peak area were linearly fitted. The standard curve of NO2 and NO by FT-IR was pre-calibrated.

Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the concentration and energy efficiencies of NO2 and NO as a function of air flow rate and water vapor concentration, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows that NO2 concentration increases continually while NO concentration increases at first and then decreases with reducing air flow rate from 340 mL min−1 to 40 mL min−1. The energy efficiencies of NO and NO2 show a similar trend, with the highest energy efficiency of NO and NO2 of 4.87 g kW h−1 and 6.44 g kW h−1 obtained at an air flow rate of 203 mL min−1 and 140 mL min−1, respectively. Fig. 2(c) shows that the concentration and energy efficiencies of NO2 and NO reach their lowest values with the addition of 0.36% water vapor into the reactor. We also list NOx production based on other reported works using spark discharges in Table 3. It can be seen that the NOx energy efficiency and yield can reach tens of g kW h−1 and thousands of ppm with spark discharges in our work, which is in the higher level. However, the highest energy consumption (5.46 MJ mol N−1) in this work for the plasma-based NOX synthesis process should be further decreased to make it competitive with the electrolysis-based H–B process.

Evolution of electron density and temperature
The combination of diagnostic and simulation methods is employed to provide insights into the mechanisms of NOx formation in the NRP spark discharge. As shown in Fig. 3(a), within the time range of 0–90 ns, the electron density increases insignificantly due to the low reduced electric field, with the electron temperature within 1–2 eV. At 90 ns, the discharge channel is formed within the air gap and the gas temperature rapidly increases to 3000 K. At 110 ns, the spark channel begins to expand due to the high temperature. Meanwhile, the electron temperature reaches a peak value of 3.7 eV. Subsequently, the electron density rises to ∼1016 cm−3. After 135 ns, the ionization of the background gas weakens on account of the low air gap voltage and recombination of the electrons with ions, which leads to the reduction of the electron density. The air gap voltage drops to zero at 150 ns, as a result, the electron temperature drops rapidly. However, the electron density can be as high as 1014–1015 cm−3 at the moment may due to that some electrons have a somewhat longer lifetime or can still be created in the afterglow by heavy-particle reactions. In spark discharges, the plasma reaction process is initiated by the collision of electrons with the background gas. Under the influence of the electric field, the electrons are heated and lead to electron impact excitation, ionization, electron attachment, and dissociation, which generate the excited species, positive and negative ions and free radicals, which further react to form new molecules.51 Therefore, the evolution of the average electron density and electron temperature over time in a spark discharge cycle is calculated in this section.
 Fig. 3  (a) Calculated electron density and electron temperature, as a function of time during spark discharge period and spark extinguishment period. (b) Calculated molar fraction of the important species, as a function of time during spark discharge period and spark extinguishment period. 
The evolution of the molar fraction of key species over time in a spark discharge cycle is shown in Fig. 3(b). The molar fraction of these species rises sharply as the air gap breaks down and the spark channel expands. The trends of the N and O radicals are similar to the electrons, meaning the role of collision-induced dissociation between the background gas molecules and electrons. Due to the highly stable NN bond and the consumption of NOx formation reactions, the N radical content is always lower than 0.01. The O radical content can reach 0.1, which is attributed to the lower dissociation energy threshold. When the spark channel fades, and the Tg drops to room temperature, the molar fraction of NO2 increases rapidly, indicating that the high temperature accelerates the decomposition of NO2 into NO and O, thus inhibiting the synthesis of NO2. At the end of the plasma-on period, the molar fraction of N2O remains almost unchanged, meaning that N2O is synthesized primarily when the plasma is turned on. In addition, N2O has only a minor concentration of the order of 10−5, which has been tested experimentally.
NOx formation and loss pathways
Using the plasma kinetics model, we found that NO and NO2 were the important gaseous products. The time-averaged production and consumption rates of the related reactions of NO and NO2 were calculated and extracted from the most critical reaction processes, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). About 51% of NO is produced by the reaction O + N2(v) → NO + N, followed by N + O2(v) → NO + O. Recent research28,54 proposed the vibrational excitation of the N2 molecules combined with O radicals as the most energy-efficient and dominant mechanism of NOx synthesis in NTPs. The reaction NO + O → NO2 is the main consumption path of NO, and also the main production route of NO2 (∼72.7%). A large portion of NO is destroyed by N + NO → O + N2 and most NO2 will react with O returning to NO by O + NO2 → NO + O2. In addition, the total yield of NO is about 4.6 times that of NO2, so NO is the dominant product in NOx. The plasma kinetics modeling results showed that the vibrationally excited N2 and O2 molecules can reduce the energy barrier of the non-thermal Zeldovich mechanism, providing an energy-efficient way for NO production.
 Fig. 4  The dominant formation reactions and loss reactions of (a) NO and (b) NO2; (c) the main reaction paths for the nitrogen fixation process. The thickness of the arrow lines is proportional to the reaction rates. The solid red line indicates the path of formation of NOx while the dashed blue line indicates the path of formation of free radicals. 
To better explain the synthesis route of NOx, we discuss the dominant reaction pathways. Note that the thickness of the arrow lines are proportional to the rates of production, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The process is initiated by the electron impact-induced dissociation with background gas molecules N2 and O2, and the abundant production of N and O radicals. The vibrationally excited state of the background gas molecules is generated by electronic excitation and excited to the higher level through rapid VV relaxation processes (the rates are on the order of 1017 cm−3 s−1). It is also worth noting that the electron impact dissociated reaction of N2(v) into N atoms is not included in the plasma kinetic model based on some evidence that these reactions do not contribute significantly to produce N atoms because of low density of N2(v) and small collision probability with electrons (Compared with the ground state of N2), as well as the prominent consumption of N2(v) by VV energy relaxations and free-radical chain reactions. In the process of de-excitation, about 95% of the vibrationally excited molecules are de-excited to the low energy level through the VT process, and the proportion of electron de-excitation is minimal. The combination of N and O radicals produced by electron impact-induced dissociation with N2(v) and O2(v) is the most crucial formation mechanism to form NO, which is also the first essential step in the process of NOx generation. Meanwhile, this approach produces abundant N and O radicals. Thus, the formation of NO species is accelerated by this positive feedback mechanism.
The OES diagnosis of excited species
The wide-scan time-integrated OES of the NRP air spark discharge from 200 nm to 900 nm are shown in Fig. 5(a). The exposure time was 0.1 s and the OES of hundreds of discharges was recorded. The O triplet (3p 5P → 3s 5S°) near 777 nm is the strongest atomic line observed in the UV-visible spectra, while the O triplet (3p 3P → 3s 3S°) near 844 nm is relatively weak. The N triplet (3p 4S° → 3s 4P) at 742.3 nm, 744.2 nm, and 746.8 nm, as well as other atomic N spectral lines around 818.4–824.2 nm, and 856.7–874.7 nm, are also dominant. The ionic N+ spectral lines can also be found at different wavelengths, i.e. (3d 3S° → 3s 3P) around 592.7–595.2 nm, (3p 3D → 3s 3P°) around 566.6–574.7 nm, (3d 3F° → 3p 3D) and (3p 3S → 3s 3P°) around 478.8–504.5 nm.55 The Hα (n = 3 → n = 2, 656.3 nm) is also detected.39 Typical atomic Fe spectral lines (4p 5D° → 4s 5F) and many Fe+ spectral lines can also be found,56 even though the Fe+ spectral lines are feeble. The spectra of the diatomic molecule are detected, including the N2 second positive system (SPS) N2 (C3Πμ → B3Πg, ν′–ν′′) and the N2+ first negative systems (FNS) N2+ (B2Σμ+ → X2Σg+, 0–0, 391.4 nm),57,58 but the γ bands of NO (A2Σ+ → X2Π, ν′–ν′′) are not observed.58 In summary, the atomic spectral lines of N, O, Fe, H, and ionic spectral lines of N+ are dominant, along with the weak molecular bands of N2 and N2+. It is believed that there are abundant N and O atoms from molecular N2 and O2 dissociation, Fe atoms from the metal electrodes, and limited H atoms from the dissociation of impurity molecule H2O. It should be pointed out that the Fe atoms or ions may not significantly influence the production of NO or NO2 during the discharge process because that the NOx formation and the optical emission spectra do not change when the electrode material is changed.
 Fig. 5  (a) The wide-scan OES of the NRP spark discharge in air from 200 nm to 900 nm, with replacement of the stainless steel electrodes with Fe electrodes to reduce the interference of metal spectral lines; (b) time-resolved OES of excited O, N, N+, H in the NRP air spark discharge; (c) the typical line fitting for estimating the electron density by OES. 
We also explore the time-resolved OES intensities of excited O, N, H, and N+ species for the indirect understanding of the species in transient states. The triggering time was set 200 ns before the applied voltage until near 3 μs and the time-resolved OES was recorded every 5 ns. Time evolution of their typical spectral lines are shown in Fig. 5(b), i.e., O (3p 5P → 3s 5S°, 777.2 nm), N (3p 4S° → 3s 4P, 821.5 nm), Hα (n = 3 → n = 2, 656.3 nm) and N+ (3p 3S → 3s 3P°, 500.1 nm). The evolution of N+ (500.1 nm) intensity is consistent with the absolute value of the current amplitude in Fig. 1(b). Clearly, there is a time delay caused by the time required for electron-impact excitation and the radiative lifetime of the upper excited state. It is reasonable to assume that the number of positive ions is about the same as the number of electrons to ensure the charge neutrality of NTPs. However, the evolution of emissions from O (777.2 nm) and N (821.5 nm) species are different, especially during the post-discharge stage. At this stage, there are obvious peaks of OES intensities (near 1500 ns) for O (777.2 nm) and N (821.5 nm), while there is almost none for N+ (500.1 nm). The phenomenon indicates the abundant O and N atoms from chemical reactions, other than electron-impact reactions. This provides convincing evidence for the occurrence of chain reactions (i.e., O + N2(v) → NO + N and N + O2(v) → NO + O).
The electron density of the plasma can be determined from the line broadening of the spectral emission lines if we can distinguish the stark broadening by subtracting the Lorentzian (natural, resonance, van der Waals) and Gaussian (Doppler and instrumental) broadening from the total broadening of the emission line.58 We measured the instrumental broadening of ∼0.09 nm for our experiments by an Argon-mercury lamp (HG-1, 253–1700 nm) while natural (1.1 × 10−4 nm) and resonance broadening can be ignored under our conditions. The Doppler broadening and van der Waals broadening for N (746.8 nm) are 0.029 nm and 0.0074 nm at Tg = 3000 K and gas pressure of 1 atm. We can fit the spectral line of N (746.8 nm) in Fig. 5(c) with Voigt broadening of 0.273 nm for the case of panoramic OES in Fig. 5(a), and then obtain the Lorentz broadening of 0.195 nm by deconvolution of the Gauss line (broadening of 0.12 nm) from the Voigt line. The electron number density will be 1.99 × 1016 cm−3 with the assumption of electron temperature of 10000 K while 1.52 × 1016 cm−3 with the assumption of electron temperature of 20000 K.59,60 The result shows that the electron number density calculated by the OES of N atom is consistent with the electron number density calculated using the plasma kinetics model.
The energy transfer processes

Fig. 6(a) shows the vibrational temperature of N2 and O2 as a function of time during a single spark discharge period, which is calculated by eqn (8): (8)where Nv and Ev are the density and corresponding vibrational energy of the vth (N2 (v = 0–8), O2 (v = 0–4)) vibrationally excited molecules, Nv-sum is the sum density of Nv. The calculated vibrational temperature of N2 and O2 can reach up to 5750 K and 1670 K during the spark discharge period.

In NTPs, VV exchange collisions can result in an intense deviation from the Boltzmann distribution61 as shown in Fig. 6(a). Before the expansion of the spark channel, the lower vibrational energy level is mainly populated by electron excitation on account of the lower temperature and reduced field. Later on, fast VV relaxation between N2 with other molecules and atoms can rapidly transfer energy from the lower vibrational states to the higher vibrational states. Therefore, the higher vibrational state of N2 increases since the rate coefficient of the VT relaxation increases following the increase of the vibration energy level and Tg, the vibrational distribution function shows a downward trend. After 150 ns, as the reduced electric field reduces to zero, the vibrational molecules’ density decreases gradually with the falling electron density. When some water vapour is added into the reactor, the distribution of N2(v) may be affected and the NOx production varies as increasing of water vapour content as shown in Fig. 2(c). On the other hand, the O2 vibrational temperature is much lower and there is a delay in its time evolution compared with Tv of N2. It indicates that the electron energy is firstly delivered into the N2 vibrational states and is then released into the O2 vibrational states.
The energy relaxation pathways, as well as time variation of the energy transfer from the discharge pulse to different species, are shown in Fig. 6(b) and (c). Fig. 6(b) shows that part of the energy stored in the vibrationally excited N2 and O2 can be transferred to NO by the non-equilibrium Zeldovich mechanism. N(2D) and N(4S) generated by electron collision dissociation may break the oxygen molecule through reactions R108 and R149, with partial energy released to NO. The energy stored in electronic excited N2 reacts with oxygen molecules by dissociating them to produce O(3P), which is consistent with the recent results.62 Then O(3P) combines with NO to form NO2through reaction R152 accompanied by the energy release.

Fig. 6(c) shows that some discharge energy is first stored in vibrationally excited N2 molecules and electronically excited O2 molecules and is then transferred to N (4S) atoms, NO molecules and vibrationally excited O2 molecules. Owing to the rapid quenching process, the energy stored in the electronic excitation N2 and O2 is dissipated within 0.2 μs. However, the energy in the vibrationally excited O2 is still present at 10 μs. The selected important reactions are summarized in Table 4.

We also compared the results of nitrogen fixation in a thermodynamics process with the same N2/O2 ratio as a function of Tg under atmospheric pressure. The normalized equilibrium species composition, NOx yield, specific energy input, and energy efficiency as a function of Tg are calculated and shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively. Fig. 7(a) indicates that the remarkable production of reactive atoms (O and N) and oxynitrides (N2O, NO and NO2) needs an extremely high Tg.28Fig. 7(b) shows that we can obtain the highest NOx yield and energy efficiency when the Tg is within the range of 2500–3500 K, which is the typical Tg range of the NRP spark discharge.21 These results indicate that the NRP spark discharge is very suitable for the oxidation of nitrogen from a thermodynamic point of view.
 Fig. 7  (a) The calculated equilibrium species composition of a 79% N2/21% O2 mixture, as a function of the Tg at atmospheric pressure, considering 11 species (N2, O2, NO, NO2, N2O, N2O3, N2O4, N2O5, NO3, N, O); (b) calculated thermal NOx yield and corresponding energy efficiency, as well as the specific energy input, as a function of Tg at atmospheric pressure; (c) fraction of electron energy transferred to different channels of excitation, ionization and dissociation of N2 and O2 as a function of the reduced electric field (E/N) and electron energy. 
To further explore the deposition of electron energy, we investigate the fraction of electron energy transferred to different channels for excitation, ionization, and dissociation of N2 and O2 as a function of the reduced electric field as shown in Fig. 7(c),28,52 which proves the importance of the vibrational excited N2. It shows that before the discharge channel expansion, more than 80% of the electron energy is transferred through the channel of vibrational excitation of N2 and less than 15% of the electron energy is transferred to the channel of vibrational excitation of O2. In other words, most of the pumping power in the spark discharge can be selectively focused on the channel of vibrational excitation at a reduced electric field range. During the discharge channel expansion, the electron excitation of N2 gradually dominates with about 40–60% of electron energy delivered to this channel, followed by vibrational excitation of N2 (energy loss fraction of 10–40%) and dissociation of O2 (energy loss fraction of ∼10%).
Conclusion
The paper addresses the issues of sustainable and scalable plasma-enabled nitrogen oxidation in an NRP air spark discharge at ambient conditions. The underlying mechanism of the plasma-enabled nitrogen fixation process is elucidated through experiment, diagnosis, and simulation results. Here, NO2 and NO were formed from dry air with 10900 ppm the highest concentration achieved along with an energy efficiency of ∼11 g kW h−1, respectively. The simulation results suggest that the chain reactions of O + N2(v) → NO + N and N + O2(v) → NO + O produce more than half NO, while the oxidation reaction of NO + O → NO2 contributes 72.7% of NO2. It indicates that the free-radical-chain reactions can provide an energy-efficient way for NO production. The spectral line peaks of N and O atoms during the post-discharge stage confirm that abundant N and O atoms are derived from the aforementioned chain reactions. On the other hand, it is suggested that most of the electron energy is firstly stored in vibrationally excited N2 molecules and electronically excited O2 molecules. Then the energy is transferred to N (4S) atoms, NO molecules, and vibrationally excited O2 molecules. Further studies should be focused on the accurate measurements of channel expansion and Tg, which will ultimately lead to better control of plasma-enabled nitrogen fixation in diverse Power-to-X applications in the future. The work provides the more sustainable, green-chemistry-based process of nitrogen fixation, avoiding consumption of fossil fuels and hydrogen as the reactant.
