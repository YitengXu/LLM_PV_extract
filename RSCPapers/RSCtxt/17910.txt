Recently, ferroelectric materials have also attracted attention for photocatalysis due to the piezo-photo effect. Here we report the synthesis of ferroelectric calcium bismuth oxide (CBO) nanoflakes and demonstrate the influence of the piezo-photo impact on the improved photoreduction of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), under visible light irradiation. The structure, morphological, optical, and ferroelectric characteristics of the CBO nanoflakes were investigated using various characterization techniques. The remanent polarization obtained from the P–E loop is 0.02 μC cm−2 with a coercive field of 3.7 kV cm−1. The CBO nanoflakes showed an 80% photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) after 120 minutes of light exposure. This photoreduction is enhanced to 94% when exposed to ultrasonic vibrations and visible light. A possible mechanism of Cr(VI) photoreduction under visible light irradiation was also proposed. The current research presents a novel and simple method for creating effective nanoflakes for environmental remediation.
1. Introduction
In the current situation, the growing population puts enormous pressure on the scientific community to find solutions to various environmental problems.1 In this context, the scientific community has difficulty developing multifunctional materials for environmental remediation. Because of its high solubility, carcinogenic chromium Cr(VI) is a well-known pollutant in wastewater among the many dangerous heavy metals.2 Cr(VI), a heavy metal ion found in wastewater, has adaptability and enters cells rapidly, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that destroy cell tissue.3,4 According to World Health Organization regulations, the highest permitted concentration of residential sewage is 0.05 mg L−1.5 Because its reduced product, Cr(III), is an essential nutrient for a living being, the conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is critical in terms of remediation.6 As a result, extensive research is underway to develop an effective technique for converting potentially dangerous Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in wastewater.7 Semiconductor photocatalysis, which converts solar energy directly into chemical energy, is seen as one of the most promising solutions to the present issues of environmental remediation and photocatalytic hydrogen production.8–11 Photocatalysis is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy to deal with heavy metals arising from industrial waste.12 The conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by photocatalysis is a promising alternative for wastewater treatment due to the inherent environmental friendliness of Cr(III).13 Ghosh et al. developed an efficient visible light-active poly(diphenylbutadiyne) (PDPB)-ZnO nanohybrid and demonstrated an enhancement in the photoreduction of Cr(VI) at different pH values.14 Environmental remediation using ferroelectric materials has been a hot research area.15–17 Ferroelectrics, which are materials that can switch polarization in response to external stimuli, are thought to be potential photocatalysts for controlling chemical applications.18 In ferroelectric and piezoelectric semiconductor materials, the ferroelectric polarization effect is principally concerned with the connection of optical, electrical, and mechanical characteristics.19 When the piezoelectric materials are subjected to external mechanical stress, such as ultrasonic vibration, polarization charges with opposite polarities will be generated and subsequently separate and migrate to the polar surfaces and form an internal electric field.18,20 The electric field can promote the separation of free electrons and holes in the materials and generate active species for redox reactions.21 Ferroelectric polarization is caused by the offset negative and positive charge centers in asymmetric materials, and the ferroelectric switch is produced by relative charge center position displacement.22–24 As a result, ferroelectricity allows for the creation of switchable surfaces that can be used to improve photocatalytic properties. Specific responses can be switched on/off or sped up/slowed down using the polarization flip.22,25,26 Current research has proven that ferroelectric materials can be used to achieve controlled catalysis. Bismuth-based semiconductor photocatalysts are identified as promising candidates for addressing emerging environmental challenges due to their excellent chemical,27 electrical,28 optical,29 and catalytic activities.30 He et al. proposed a theoretical study on Bi-based oxides (CdBiO3, ZnBiO3, CaBiO3, and MgBiO3) and described their density of states and energy band gap values based on density functional theory (DFT).31 These oxides have suitable band edge positions for the oxidation and reduction processes; therefore, they can be used in photocatalytic processes. Tang et al. synthesized BaBiO3 by a simple chemical method and demonstrated a 100% photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye in 120 min under visible light irradiation.32 Solarska et al. synthesized a calcium bismuth mixed oxide using a novel flame spray synthesis method. They showed an enhancement in the photocatalytic performance of MB degradation by precisely controlling the particle size and creating oxygen vacancies.33 Calcium bismuth oxide (CaBiO3) is a ferroelectric compound with visible light sensitivity and a narrow band gap. (∼1.9 eV).34 We were inspired by these findings to consider how we may enhance photo-induced charge separation in semiconductors, combining traditional modification methods with ferroelectric polarization effects to improve total charge separation. We chose CaBiO3 (CBO) as the candidate material for photocatalysis of Cr(VI) reduction into Cr(III) to verify this hypothesis.
Herein, we report the synthesis of a CaBiO3 nanostructure by a sol–gel method and show that the piezo-photocatalytic effect significantly improves the photocatalytic activity. To our knowledge, the piezo-photocatalytic impact of CBO nanoflakes for photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) is yet to be studied. The dielectric and ferroelectric properties of the synthesized CBO nanoflakes are also studied. The current research presents a novel and simple method for creating effective nanoflakes for environmental remediation.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of calcium bismuth oxide nanoflakes
Calcium bismuth oxide nanoflakes were synthesized by the sol–gel method.35 A typical synthesis procedure was as follows. 500 mg of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and 2.42 mg of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi (NO3)3·5H2O) were added to 50 ml of deionized (DI) water and stirred for 3 h to make the solution homogeneous. Afterward, 900 mg of glycine and 300 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were added to the above mixture and stirred for 2 h. After that 6 ml of ammonia solution was added dropwise to maintain pH ∼8 and the temperature set at 200 °C. After 5–6 h, a gel was formed and continued to dry at the same temperature to obtain a solid product. The final product was ground using a mortar and pestle and calcined at 460 °C temperature to get the desired phase. Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of various steps in synthesizing CBO nanoflakes.

3. Characterization
The XRD patterns of the CaBiO3 (CBO) nanoflakes were investigated by using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with a copper Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation source at a scanning speed of 4° per minute in the 2θ range of 20–80°.36 The morphological studies were carried out using a FEI Quanta 200 Field FESEM and the compositional analysis was studied using XRD and elemental mapping.37 HRTEM (FEI-Tecnai) was used to analyze the morphology of the CBO nanoflakes.38 A 1050 PerkinElmer Lambda spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-visible absorption spectra. The FTIR spectra of the CBO nanoflakes were analyzed by using a spectrometer (Hitachi).39 The polarization–electric field (P–E) loops of the CBO nanoflakes were studied using a Radiant Precision Premier-II Ferroelectric Tester. Using an LCR meter, we measured the dielectric properties of the synthesized CBO nanoflakes. A Quantachrome autosorb TRX was used to analyze the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume of CBO. A PEC workstation (Zahner Zennium, PP 211) was used for the Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurements.
3.1 Photocatalytic and piezo-photoreduction performance of CBO nanoflakes
A solution of 7 mM Cr(VI) was prepared by dissolving 1.43 g of potassium dichromate in 250 ml of DI water. The CBO nanoflakes (90 mg) were added to 100 ml of the Cr(VI) aqueous solution. To confirm the adsorption-desorption equilibrium, the suspension was agitated for 45 mins in the dark before being exposed to light. The piezo-photocatalytic performance of Cr(VI) photoreduction was investigated using visible light irradiation (150 W, incident power 20 mW cm−2 in the wavelength range of 300–1200 nm) and ultrasonic vibration (40 kHz, 100 W). The lamp was situated above 15 cm from the solution. The solution was collected using a syringe during the reaction and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm to remove CBO nanoflakes before being tested. A UV-spectrophotometer was used to analyze the photocatalytic efficiency of the CBO nanoflakes. The maximum absorption intensity of Cr(VI) at 368 nm was used to monitor the degradation of pollutants using the formula below: η = (C0 − C)/C0,(1)where C0 and C are the initial concentration and final concentration at time T, respectively.
The kinetics of photoreduction of the Cr(VI) ion can be described as follows: ln(C0/C) = kt,(2)where the photoreduction rate constant is k (min−1).
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Structural analysis
The crystal structures and phase composition of the synthesized CBO nanoflakes were investigated using XRD measurements. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD pattern of the CBO nanoflakes. The peak positions at 2θ values of 27.94°, 30.54°, 31.61°, 32.80°, 46.17°, 46.89°, 54.46°, 55.65°, 58.02° 68.9° and 74.72° correspond to the (005), (104), (111), (112), (205), (116), (300), (207), (303), (219) and (315) crystallographic planes. The lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ are estimated as 5.81 Å and 15.50 Å, respectively. The XRD spectrum agrees with previous results corresponding to the trigonal phase of CBO's Rm (146) space group.34,40
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD pattern of the CBO nanoflakes, (b) FTIR spectrum of the CBO nanoflakes, (c) UV-visible spectrum of the CBO nanoflakes, and (d) Tauc plot of the CBO nanoflakes. 
The crystallite size of the CBO nanoflakes was calculated by following Scherrer's formula:41,42 D = kλ/βcos(θ),(3)where D is the crystallite size, k = 0.9 (constant), λ = 1.54 Å (the wavelength of the incident X-ray), β = FWHM (full width half maxima), and θ = the angle of diffraction. The calculated value of the crystallite size for the CBO nanoflakes was ∼2.9 nm. In order to confirm the formation of CBO nanoflakes, FTIR spectroscopy was used in the wavelength range of 400–4000 cm−1. The observed bands at 475, 592, 843, 1034, 1298, 1377, 1464, and 1740 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 2(b). The perovskite structure is confirmed by the band at 475 cm−1 ascribed to the metal–oxygen bond.43 The absorption bands at 1464, 1034, and 843 cm−1 are assigned to different vibration C–O modes of the carbonate group CO32−,44 and the band around 1377 cm−1 may be due to trapped nitrates.43 The peaks at 1298 cm−1 and 1740 cm−1 resulted from the −COOH and CO ester functional group.45 UV-visible spectra were obtained to evaluate the optical properties and band gaps of the CBO nanoflakes. The UV-vis absorbance spectrum and Tauc plots of the CBO nanoflakes are shown in Fig. 2(c and d), respectively. An absorption edge at 550 nm is observed in the absorbance spectrum. The band gap was estimated using the Tauc equation: (αhν)n = (hν − Eg),(4)where Eg, α, and hν are the energy band gap of the nanoflakes, absorption coefficient, and energy of the incident photon, respectively, and n = 1/2 is used for an indirect band gap and n = 2 for a direct band gap. CBO is an indirect band gap material.31 Thus, we have taken n = 1/2 to fit the experimental data. Extrapolating the linear region of the plot (αhν)1/2 on the y-axis versus the photon energy (hν) on the x-axis yields the Eg value. The band gap energy of the CBO nanoflakes was estimated using eqn (4) and found to be 1.9 eV, confirming that the synthesized CBO is a visible active semiconductor. This is similar to the report earlier in the literature.31
4.2. Morphological analysis
The morphology and chemical composition of the CBO nanoflakes were analyzed by FESEM and EDX analysis. The SEM image of the CBO nanoflakes shows the aggregated nanoflake morphology (Fig. 3(a)). The chemical compositions of the CBO nanoflakes were examined by EDX (Fig. 3(b)), which shows that calcium (Ca), bismuth (Bi), and oxygen (O) elements are present in a stoichiometric ratio. It was found that calcium and bismuth are in a ratio of 1:1, and there is an increment in oxygen content due to the environment. The mapping images (Fig. 3(c–f)) of the selected SEM image area represent the distribution of the ‘Ca’ (green), ‘Bi’ (red), and ‘O’ (blue) and a mixed image of the elements existing in the CBO nanoflakes. It is observed that the density distribution of ‘Ca’ correlates well with ‘Bi’ and the simultaneous appearance of ‘O’ confirms the uniform distribution of each element.

Fig. 4(a) exhibits a typical TEM image of the CBO nanoflakes showing flake-like structures of ∼50 to 60 nm in size. Fig. 4(b) shows the HRTEM image of the CBO nanoflakes. The HRTEM image confirms the flake-like structures. Clear lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 3.1 nm can be seen in the HRTEM picture of the CBO nanoflakes, which corresponds to the (005) plane of CBO (Fig. 4(b)). The results are in good agreement with the XRD analysis. We also analyzed the BET measurements of the CBO nanoflakes and observed that the BET surface area and pore volume are 7.588 m2 g−1 and 0.039 cm3 g−1, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†).

4.3. Dielectric and ferroelectric properties of the CBO nanoflakes
We also measured the dielectric constant of the CBO nanoflakes. Using an LCR meter, we measured the changes in capacitance value of the pallet with different frequency ranges. We calculated the dielectric constant from the capacitor value using the formula: (5)where C, A, D, and ε0 are the capacitance, effective area, pallet thickness, and permittivity in free space, respectively. The obtained dielectric constant value vs. frequency is shown in Fig. 5(a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Variation of the dielectric constant of the CBO nanoflakes with frequency and (b) P–E loop of the CBO nanoflakes. 
The dielectric constant decreases with an increase in the frequency, because of dielectric relaxation. The dipoles can align their axes at low frequency and follow the frequency, while at high frequency, the dipoles cannot align themselves in the direction of the applied field, so the dielectric constant decreases as frequency increases, as seen in Fig. 5(a). In addition, P–E measurements were performed to confirm the ferroelectric properties of the CBO nanoflakes. For the P–E loop measurements, a pallet of area ∼0.82 cm2 and thickness ∼1.7 mm was prepared of CBO nanoflakes. Silver electrodes on both sides of the pallet were made for P–E measurements. An alternating electric field of maximum applied field of 15 kV cm−1 at a frequency of 10 Hz is applied across the thickness of the pallet. Fig. 5(b) shows the results of P–E measurements; hysteresis in the P–E loop indicates the ferroelectric characteristics of CBO. The remanent polarization obtained from the P–E loop is 0.02 μC cm−2 with a coercive field of 3.7 kV cm−1.
5. Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI)
The photocatalytic activity of the CBO nanoflakes was examined towards photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) under visible light illumination and ultrasonic vibration. The Cr(VI) reduction during piezo-photocatalysis was supervised using UV-visible spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Direct photolysis of the aforesaid contaminants was shown to be minimal in the blank/control trials. The CBO nanoflakes showed considerable Cr(VI) reduction (∼94%) within 120 min under visible and ultrasonic vibrations. We took readings after intervals of 15 min and during these intervals the temperature changes by ±2 °C. After that, we switched off the ultra-sonicator for a few minutes to collect the sample and change the water of the ultra-sonicator on each reading, so that we are able to control the temperature of our solution. Photoreduction profiles of Cr(VI) ion solutions by CBO nanoflakes are shown in Fig. 6(b) under visible light irradiation and visible light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration. The results clearly show that the photoreduction of Cr(VI) was faster in visible light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration as compared to only visible light irradiation, which is attributed to the piezo-phototronic effect of the CBO nanoflakes. We have also performed the piezo-photoreduction of Cr(VI) by varying the pH value from 3 to 11. It is observed that with the increase of the pH from 3 up to pH 11, the piezo-photoreduction rate of Cr(VI) decreases. The results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

The kinetic analysis of pollutant degradation is crucial in determining the efficiency viability of wastewater treatment. Because there is an excess of water in the current context, the reaction rate is consequently dependent on Cr(VI) ion concentration. It will remain constant. The piezo-photoreduction rate constant (kt) was determined using the equation:36,46 lnC/C0 = −kt(6)where C0 is the initial concentration, C is the concentration at a specific time, and kt is the photodegradation rate constant (min−1). A plot of lnC/C0vs. photodegradation time (Fig. 6(c)) exhibits a linear trend and from the slopes of the lines the apparent rate constant kt was obtained and found to be 0.0106 and 0.0147 min−1 for CBO nanoflakes in photoreduction and piezo-photoreduction, respectively. Table 1 illustrates a comparative study of the photocatalytic performance of the CBO nanoflakes with the other reported photocatalyst materials.

5.1. Photostability and reusability of the photocatalyst
To test the stability of the catalyst, the material's photostability is a key factor in its practical application. CBO nanoflakes were examined for reusability in the photoreduction of Cr(VI) under the same reaction situations. 5 cycles of piezo-photoreduction were performed using CBO nanoflakes and Cr(VI) solution. After each cycle, CBO nanoflakes were removed from the reaction solution, washed with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 90 °C for 70 min. The CBO nanoflakes were then used in a new cycle. Fig. 7(a) shows the results of photoreduction of Cr(VI) for five runs. The CBO nanoflakes exhibit a high level of photostability as the Cr(VI) photoreduction values after 120 min of light exposure are 94, 90, 89, 87, and 84% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th runs, respectively. On increasing the number of cycles, the photocatalytic activity was found to reduce due to the absorption of Cr(VI) molecules onto the CBO nanoflake's surface, reducing the active sites of the CBO nanoflakes. Fig. 7(b) shows the XRD analysis of the CBO nanoflakes before and after the photoreduction of Cr(VI) ions. There is no noticeable change in the XRD patterns except for the suppression of a few peaks. This variation could be due to the adsorption of Cr ions during the photoreduction process. Fig. 7(c) shows the SEM image of the CBO nanoflakes after (five cycles) the piezo-photoreduction reaction. The morphology looks similar to the one before the photocatalysis reaction.

5.2. Enhanced piezo-photoreduction mechanism of Cr(VI) on CBO nanoflakes
Based on the above results, a descriptive photocatalytic mechanism for the piezo-photoreduction of Cr(VI) over CBO nanoflakes is proposed and illustrated in Fig. 8. Under visible light illumination, photogeneration of electron–hole pairs occurs. Some of these photogenerated electrons and holes will reach the surface of CBO and participate in the reduction process, whereas some will recombine. Fig. 8(a) shows that in the absence of ultrasonic vibrations, photogenerated electrons and holes recombine easily, so their photocatalytic activity will not be high. However, being a ferroelectric material, in CBO, the presence of ultrasonic vibrations generates a built-in electric field that significantly enhances photogenerated charge separation. Fig. 8(b) describes the overall reduction mechanism of Cr(VI) ions under the combined effect of visible light and ultrasonic vibrations. The CB of CBO is found to be −0.23 eV (vs. NHE) by using the Mott–Schottky measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†) and from UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, the band gap of CBO is observed to be 1.9 eV. So, the VB position of CBO is +1.67 eV (vs. NHE). The holes in the VB with a potential of +1.65 eV, which is more negative than the standard reduction potential of OH−/OH˙ (+1.99 eV vs. NHE), were not able to generate hydroxyl radicals. So, the holes in the VB could possibly combine with H2O to produce O2 and hydrogen ions (H+), since the VB potential of CBO is more positive than the standard oxidation potential of O2/H2O (+1.23 eV vs. NHE). Also, the CB of CBO is favorable with the redox potential for conversion of O2 into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (+0.69 eV vs. NHE). In addition, the CB potential of CBO is also favorable for the formation of superoxide anion radicals  due to a more negative CB position as compared to the standard redox potential of (−0.046 eV vs. NHE), indicating that the transferred electron in the CB of CBO can oxidize O2 and  radicals. Under the combined effect of visible light and ultrasonic vibrations, separation of electrons and holes is enhanced by the piezo potential, resulting in the generation of active species for redox reaction.23,51–53 Finally, these generated OH˙ radicals and  radicals would further participate in the photoreduction of Cr(VI) ions. In order to confirm the participation of  and OH˙ in the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), we have performed scavenging experiments (Fig. S4, ESI†). We have studied this using ammonium oxalate as a hole scavenger and silver nitrate as an electron scavenger. The availability of more free radicals under the effect of piezo-potential enhances the reduction rate of Cr(VI) ions. The piezo-photoreduction mechanism of Cr(VI) ions in the presence of CBO nanoflakes under visible light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration is given below: (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12)

Conclusions
A sol–gel process was used to successfully synthesize visible light-active CaBiO3 (CBO) nanoflakes with ferroelectric properties. Their excellent photocatalytic properties are demonstrated by combining the piezoelectric effect and photocatalytic activity. XRD and HRTEM studies confirmed the synthesis of CBO in a single phase. The obtained remanent polarization of the CBO nanoflakes is 0.02 μC cm−2 with a coercive field of 3.7 kV cm−1 and the dielectric constant of the CBO nanoflakes is 45 at a frequency of 100 kHz. The CBO nanoflakes can effectively utilize visible light for photoreduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) sources. The application of ultrasonic vibration promotes the separation and migration of photo-induced carriers and enhances the photocatalysis efficiency. In conclusion, it is a promising method to obtain excellent piezo-photocatalytic activity by combining the conventional piezoelectric effect and photocatalyst activity to prepare nanoflakes.
