    , Accepted 7th May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractSevere bacterial infections have brought an urgent threat to our daily life, and photothermal therapy (PTT) has acted as an effective method to kill bacteria. Herein we decorated Ag on the surface of SnS2 (Ag@SnS2), which has outstanding photothermal conversion capability and good biocompatibility. The decoration of Ag on SnS2 improved the absorption of near-infrared (NIR) light in comparison to SnS2, resulting in a temperature increase of 50 °C after 5 min of NIR light irradiation (1.9 W cm−2) and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 31.3%. Ag@SnS2 exhibits almost 100% growth inhibition of E. coli and S. aureus bacteria due to hyperthermia, with a concentration larger than 0.5 mg mL−1 and 5 min of NIR irradiation. Meanwhile, SEM images of treated bacterial cells showed the attachment of Ag@SnS2 on the cell surface and obvious cellular membrane destruction. Ag@SnS2 can also accelerate in vivo wound healing through PTT-induced bacterial disinfection. Therefore, Ag@SnS2 exhibits great potential for photothermal antibacterial application and wound disinfection.
Introduction
Bacterial infections are one of the greatest threats to global human health.1,2 It is reported that bacterial infections have about 17 billion victims every year.3 The rapid growth of bacterial infections has made the study of antibacterial methods and materials urgent. Promoted by nanotechnology, versatile antibacterial strategies have been proposed for defeating bacterial infection, including chemotherapies using metal nanoparticles (e.g., silver-based antibacterial materials,4–6 copper-based antibacterial materials,7 and Zn-based antibacterial agents8), photodynamic therapy,9,10 photothermal therapy (PTT),11,12 and synergistic antibacterial therapy.13
PTT is a method inhibiting bacterial growth2,14 or destroying tumor,15–18 which relies on hyperthermia from photothermal agents (PTAs) when exposed to light. Particularly, near-infrared (NIR) PTT has attracted our attention due to deep tissue penetration of NIR light and high therapeutic efficiency. Recently, various PTAs have been developed, including organic dyes and polymers,19 noble metal materials,20,21 carbon-based nanomaterials,22,23 and semiconductor nanomaterials.24–26 Among them, metal oxides and chalcogenides have been considered as one of the most attractive PTAs in recent years due to their unique features including good photothermal stability, high NIR photothermal conversion efficiency, low-cost and rapid facile synthesis.27 Tin(IV) sulfide (SnS2) is a typical metal chalcogenide semiconductor with a hexagonal CdI2-type structure of the crystal and a band gap of about 2.2 eV.28–30 In recent studies, SnS2 has been applied in photoconductors,31 solar cells,32 and sensors.33 Particularly, SnS2 can be used as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst, because it shows a superior visible light absorption ability.34 However, SnS2 shows slight absorption in the NIR region, resulting in few applications in the NIR-responsive semiconductor photothermal therapy.
Most efforts have been devoted to improving the semiconductor's NIR light response, including the construction of specific morphology,35,36 integration with photothermal agents,24,37 and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modulation.38,39 LSPR is a phenomenon where optical excitation induces cooperative oscillations of free axisymmetric electric charges limited in novel metals or semiconductor materials.40 LSPR properties of semiconductor materials can be precisely modulated from the visible spectral range to the far-infrared spectral range via doping or chemical post-synthesis reactions.41 To maximize the LSPR in the NIR window, novel metals have been integrated into the semiconductors to form heterojunction nanostructures that have higher extinction cross-sections compared to the single-ingredient ones. The semiconductor/metal plasmonic heterostructures have exhibited promising results for photothermal therapy. For example, Cao et al. found that the Au@Cu2−xS heterogeneous nanomaterials had a photothermal conversion efficiency of 35.2% and an improvement of 11.3% over Cu2−xS, for the reason that the LSPR effect was formed between Au and Cu2−xS.38 Similarly, Lin's group demonstrated that the CeVO4/Ag nanohybrids have improved photothermal conversion capability compared to single CeVO4, due to the LSPR property of Ag.39
Herein, plasmonic Ag was decorated on the surface of SnS2 nanoflowers (Ag@SnS2) to enhance their absorption of NIR light and further improve their photothermal transduction capability. The in vitro bactericidal activity of Ag@SnS2 was studied against Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus bacteria, and the in vivo bactericidal activity was verified in the mice model with S. aureus infection (Scheme 1). Our results suggested that Ag@SnS2 exhibited enhanced photothermal conversion activities and safe skin wound disinfection effects.

Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Stannic chloride (SnCl4·5H2O) was obtained from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai, China). L-Cysteine was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Silver nitrate and hydrogen peroxide were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. Luria–Bertani (LB) broth medium and LB nutrient agar were obtained from Qingdao Haibo Biotechnology. A LIVE/DEAD™ BacLight™ bacterial viability kit (L13152) was purchased from the Invitrogen company.
Synthesis of Ag@SnS2 nanocomposites
First, SnS2 was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method.42 SnCl4·5H2O (1 mmol) and L-cysteine (5 mmol) were respectively dissolved in 30 mL of deionized (DI) water, and then they were put in the hydrothermal reactor and heated at 180 °C for 24 h in an oven. The products were centrifuged and washed with DI water and ethanol three times. A dark yellow SnS2 powder was obtained by oven drying at 60 °C. Then Ag@SnS2 was obtained by adding [Ag(NH3)2]+ and H2O2. Briefly, AgNO3 (2 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL of DI water, and NH4OH was added dropwise to make an [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution. Then a mixture of 26.9 mL of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ solution and 0.1 mL of H2O2 was added to a SnS2 suspension (0.182 g SnS2 dispersed in 40 mL of DI water), followed by stirring for 24 h with the color changing from dark yellow to black. Finally, Ag-functionalized SnS2 nanocomposites were washed and dried for further use.
Characterization
Microscopy images were obtained using a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) of JEOL JEM-1200EX. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization was performed using a JEOL JEM-1200EX. The surface morphologies of the Ag@SnS2 materials and bacteria were observed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) of JSM-6700F. Element composition and mapping were analyzed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). The UV/Vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. The crystalline phase of the synthesized materials was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D-Max 2500 diffractometer. The oxidation states of elements were recorded using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum. Fluorescence images of bacteria were obtained by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX53.
Photothermal performance
500 μL of the nanomaterial suspension at a certain concentration was irradiated with 808 nm laser at 1.9 W cm−2 and the temperature was monitored for 5 min. The infrared thermal images of Ag@SnS2 at various concentrations with irradiation for 5 min were recorded every minute using a Fluke Ti10 Infrared Camera. For the photo-stability test, Ag@SnS2 dispersions were irradiated for 5 min and then cooled down naturally, and the laser was switched on and off 5 times. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of Ag@SnS2 was studied by Roper's method.43

In vitro photothermal antibacterial assay

E. coli and S. aureus were used as model bacteria to study the in vitro photothermal bactericidal effects of Ag@SnS2 by the plate counting method. The bacteria were incubated in LB broth medium for 12 h at 37 °C with stirring, and then the bacteria were dispersed in PBS. 250 μL of the Ag@SnS2 suspension in PBS (2.0, 1, 0.5, and 0.3 mg mL−1) was added to 250 μL of the bacterial solution at 2.0 × 106 CFU mL−1. The mixture was illuminated using an 808 nm laser for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively. As a control, 250 μL of SnS2 solutions at 0.5 mg mL−1 was mixed with 250 μL of the bacterial solution and then illuminated for 20 min. After equal incubation time, the treated bacteria were transferred to the agar plates and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacterial colonies were imaged and counted. The bacterial cell viability was calculated using untreated cells as the control.
Fluorescence microscopic imaging of bacteria
Fluorescence microscopic imaging was used to distinguish between live and dead cells stained with a live/dead viability kit. 250 μL of the bacterial solution (2.0 × 108 CFU mL−1) was added to 250 μL of PBS or Ag@SnS2 (0.5 mg mL−1) with or without NIR irradiation (1.9 W cm−2, 20 min). The treated bacterial cells were incubated with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) in the dark for 10 min. After staining, the free dye was removed by centrifugation and the cell precipitate was placed on the slides for imaging under a fluorescence microscope.
SEM observation of bacteria
The in vitro antibacterial mechanism was observed by SEM. 250 μL of the bacterial solution (2.0 × 108 CFU mL−1) in PBS was added to 250 μL of PBS or Ag@SnS2 (0.5 mg mL−1) with or without NIR irradiation (1.9 W cm−2, 20 min). The treated bacteria were fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and then dehydrated with gradient alcohol in turn. After centrifugation and washing, the concentrated bacteria were dripped onto the silicon chip and observed by SEM.

In vivo mice wound disinfection
6–8 weeks old female BALB/c mice were obtained from the experimental animal center of Bethune Medical College (Changchun, China). An abscess on each mouse model was created by injection of 100 μL of S. aureus bacteria at 109 CFU mL−1 under the epidermis and cultured for 1 day. The infected mice were randomly divided into four groups with three mice in one group. Then, 50 μL of PBS or Ag@SnS2 (1.0 mg mL−1) was injected into the infected abscess with or without NIR irradiation (0.9 W cm−2 for 10 min). A thermal imaging camera recorded photos of treated mice. For 2 weeks, the size of the abscess and mouse weight were measured every day. At the end of the test, the epidermal tissue of abscesses and major organs of treated mice were collected and detected by H&E staining.
Results and discussion
Structure and morphology of Ag@SnS2
SnS2 was prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method, where SnCl4·5H2O was the Sn source and L-cysteine was the S source. SnS2 exhibited a three-dimensional flower-like structure with a size of ∼500 nm in width, which was assembled by numerous thin nanosheets (Fig. S1†). Ag nanoparticles were then decorated on the surface of SnS2 to form Ag@SnS2 due to the affinity of Ag and SH on the surface of SnS2. In comparison with SnS2, the morphology of Ag@SnS2 did not show obvious changes and maintained a flower-like structure (Fig. 1a and b). HRTEM images of Ag@SnS2 showed that the lattice spacing distances of 0.28 nm and 0.24 nm belong to the (101) plane of SnS2 and (200) plane of Ag, respectively (Fig. 1c). The decorated Ag nanoparticles were visualized under HRTEM and their size was ∼5 nm (Fig. S2†). EDS results also showed that elements Ag, S, and Sn were the main components of Ag@SnS2 and Ag was distributed evenly on the surface of Ag@SnS2 (Fig. S3†). Additionally, the successful decoration of Ag was also confirmed by XRD. The sharp diffraction peaks of SnS2 can be indexed to the (001), (100), (101), (102), (110), (111), and (201) planes, and other sets of diffraction peaks were assigned to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) crystal planes of cubic Ag (Fig. 1d). No other peaks were detected, which confirms the phase purity.

XPS studies were performed to study the chemical state and elemental distribution. The elements of Ag, Sn, and S can be found in the XPS spectrum of Ag@SnS2 as shown in Fig. 2a–d. The peaks located near 368.0 eV and 374.0 eV could be assigned to Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 respectively with the energy difference of 6.0 eV, which is characteristic of Ag (Fig. 2a).44,45 Two peaks of 486.7 eV and 495.1 eV correspond to two spin orbits of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively, which confirmed the presence of Sn4+ (Fig. 2b).46,47 The XPS spectrum of S 2p is shown in Fig. 2c, where the two orbits (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) corresponding to the S2− in SnS2 appeared at 161.3 eV and 162.6 eV. These results further proved the successful synthesis of Ag@SnS2.

Photothermal effect of Ag@SnS2
UV/Vis spectroscopy was applied to examine the optical behavior of Ag@SnS2 and SnS2. As shown in Fig. 3a, SnS2 showed a broad absorption range of 400–800 nm, while Ag@SnS2 showed obviously enhanced absorption intensity with a red shift due to the LSPR of Ag, especially the high NIR absorption. The results were favorable for the NIR-responsive photothermal conversion effect. The photothermal performance of Ag@SnS2 was evaluated and their temperature changes under 808 nm laser irradiation are presented in Fig. 3b–f. After 5 min of laser irradiation, the temperature raise of Ag@SnS2 at 1 mg mL−1 was 50.0 °C, while the SnS2 solution could only increase 24.1 °C (Fig. 3b). The results suggested that the decoration of Ag on SnS2 can extensively enhance their light-to-heat conversion due to the LSPR absorption of Ag. A similar phenomenon was found in the literature where Ag decorated CeVO4 semiconductors exhibited improved visible and NIR light absorption and resulted in a good photothermal effect due to the LSPR properties of Ag nanoparticles.39 Additionally, the temperature rise of Ag@SnS2 with different feeding mass ratios of SnS2 and Ag was investigated under 808 nm laser irradiation (Fig. S4†). In order to maximize their photothermal conversion capability, the optimal feeding mass ratio of 1:0.8 (SnS2:Ag) was chosen to synthesize Ag@SnS2 for the following experiments.

(e) Temperature changes of Ag@SnS2 (1 mg mL−1) over five cycles using the 808 nm laser. (f) Linear regression curve of the cooling part from Ag@SnS2. 
Encouraged by the good photothermal activity of Ag@SnS2, the concentration and laser power density-dependent photothermal effects were investigated. As expected, the temperature of Ag@SnS2 elevated with the increase of materials concentration or laser power density (Fig. 3c and S5†). The corresponding thermal images of Ag@SnS2 with 5 min of 808 nm NIR irradiation were captured, which was consistent with the temperature increase curve (Fig. 3c and d). The photo-stability of Ag@SnS2 was also evaluated, where the samples were irradiated for 5 min and then cooled down naturally. As shown in Fig. 3e, no appreciable continuous reduction of temprature raise can be found after five cycles of laser switch on and off, indicating that the Ag@SnS2 samples had excellent photothermal stability. The linear regression curve of Ag@SnS2 (Fig. 3f) was obtained from cooling curves (Fig. S6†) according to Roper's report. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) and the time constant for heat transfer (τ) of Ag@SnS2 were calculated to be 31.3% and 163.0 s, respectively.

In vitro antibacterial effect of Ag@SnS2
To investigate the photothermal effect of Ag@SnS2 against E. coli and S. aureus, bacteria were treated with different concentrations of Ag@SnS2 (0–1.0 mg mL−1) at different laser irradiation times (0–30 min) and then cultured in agar plates at 37 °C. After 24 h of incubation, bacterial colonies grown on the agar plates were imaged and counted (Fig. 4). It was obvious that the bacterial viability decreased along with the increase of sample dosage and laser irradiation time. At 1.0 mg mL−1 and 0.5 mg mL−1 of Ag@SnS2, a 100% killing rate of both E. coli and S. aureus was observed when irradiated using an 808 nm laser for 5 min. At 0.25 mg mL−1, the killing rate can reach 99.2% for E. coli and 98.8% for S. aureus after 30 min of irradiation. When the concentration was further reduced to 0.15 mg mL−1, the killing rate was 76.9% for E. coli and 91.6% for S. aureus even after 30 min of irradiation. The results indicated that antibacterial agents at relatively low concentrations required a longer irradiation time to maintain almost complete inactivation of bacterial growth. The antibacterial effect of the SnS2 control group was also analyzed using the plate counting method. We found that neither SnS2 with NIR irradiation nor SnS2 without NIR irradiation have antibacterial activities (Fig. S7†). Based on the results, a suitable dosage of Ag@SnS2 and an irradiation time could be selected to achieve the suitable bacterial killing rate. Additionally, there was no obvious death for Ag@SnS2 treated bacterial cells without NIR irradiation, suggesting that the bactericidal activity of Ag@SnS2 was not from their inherent chemical toxicity. The release of Ag from Ag@SnS2 (1 mg mL−1) after NIR irradiation for 30 min was 0.49 μg mL−1 analyzed by ICP-MS. The concentration of released Ag was too low to inhibit the bacterial growth, also demonstrating that the released Ag has a negligible antibacterial activity. The decoration of Ag nanoparticles mainly enhanced the photothermal effect of SnS2, but not the chemical toxicity. The inhibition of bacteria resulted from the NIR-induced hyperthermia from Ag@SnS2. Furthermore, hemolysis results showed that Ag@SnS2 shows negligible hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) even at 1 mg mL−1 (Fig. S8†), indicating the safety and practicability of the samples for further study in vivo.

We further investigated the in vitro photothermal antibacterial effect of Ag@SnS2 using a fluorescent microscope. Based on the previous results, 0.25 mg mL−1 of Ag@SnS2 and 20 min of NIR irradiation time were chosen for the following experiments. After treatment, both E. coli and S. aureus bacteria were stained using a live/dead BacLight assay kit, where SYTO-9 stained the live bacteria (green fluorescence) and PI stained the dead bacteria (red fluorescence). As shown in Fig. 5, bacterial cells treated with Ag@SnS2 under NIR irradiation exhibited a lot of red spots, while bacterial cells treated with PBS, NIR, and Ag@SnS2 showed a lot of green spots and only a few red spots. The results were in agreement with the bacterial cell viability results, which further confirmed the photothermal antibacterial effects of Ag@SnS2.

To better assess the photothermal antibacterial effect, the morphology of E. coli and S. aureus exposed to Ag@SnS2 plus 808 nm laser irradiation was investigated by SEM. When treated with PBS or NIR, E. coli cells were rod-shaped with the intact cell membrane (Fig. 6a and b), and similarly, S. aureus cells were sphere-shaped with a smooth surface (Fig. 6e and f). When incubated with Ag@SnS2 without NIR irradiation, bacterial cells had obvious interaction with nanocomposites, and their cell membrane still maintained integrity, suggesting that Ag@SnS2 alone had barely bactericidal activity (Fig. 6c and g). However, when exposed to Ag@SnS2 plus NIR irradiation, the bacterial cells were collapsed obviously, indicating that NIR-induced hyperthermia can violently destroy the bacteria (Fig. 6d and h). It can be concluded that Ag@SnS2 as a photothermal agent induced intensive antibacterial effect on the E. coli and S. aureus cells by the damage of cell membrane integrity.

In vivo wound disinfection
Inspired by the excellent in vitro antibacterial effect of Ag@SnS2, their PTT-induced in vivo wound disinfection was further investigated. S. aureus is one of the leading pathogens responsible for healthcare-associated infection, and thus a mouse model was established by injecting S. aureus under its epidermis tissues to create the abscess infection. After 1 day, PBS or Ag@SnS2 solution was injected into the infected abscess and the wound healing was monitored for 14 days. As shown in Fig. 7a, an obvious swelling with a certain degree of redness developed after 1 day of bacterial infection. For PBS, NIR, and Ag@SnS2 control groups, an obvious subepidermal abscess formed at the first few days, and then a local ulcer progressively formed from the abscess. At the end of 14 days, the red scar protruded after the wound healing and the surrounding skin was red and swollen. By contrast, the wound treated with Ag@SnS2 plus NIR irradiation group healed much more quickly than that of control groups without the formation of obvious ulcers and scars. The sizes of abscesses or wound in the Ag@SnS2 with NIR group were clearly less than those in control groups (Fig. 7b). During 10 min of NIR irradiation, the Ag@SnS2 plus NIR group exhibited excellent photothermal conversion efficiency and the temperature increased to 50.5 °C rapidly, while the temperature of the NIR group only reached 43.4 °C (Fig. 7c). The results indicated that Ag@SnS2 with 808 nm laser irradiation underwent strong in vivo light-to-heat conversion, and the resulting hyperthermia successfully exerted wound disinfection. In addition, the mice bearing bacterial infection after various treatments exhibited no obvious bodyweight drop, which suggested the good biocompatibility of Ag@SnS2 (Fig. 7d).

(c) Photographs and infrared thermal images of the wound area irradiated with an NIR laser for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min and (d) changes in the weight of mice for 14 days. 
To further demonstrate the therapeutic status at the tissue level, the epidermal tissue was isolated and histologically analyzed at the end of 2 weeks. Regenerating epidermis in the Ag@SnS2 with NIR group completely covered the wound, while the epithelial regeneration was delayed in the other three groups (Fig. 8a). These demonstrated that Ag@SnS2 could effectively prevent the bacterial infection via PTT under NIR irradiation and further accelerate the wound healing in the mouse model. In addition, the organs of mice treated with Ag@SnS2 alone and Ag@SnS2 plus NIR were studied by H&E staining to analyze in vivo biocompatibility of Ag@SnS2. Fig. 8b shows no obvious difference with normal organs, demonstrating that Ag@SnS2 has low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility.

Conclusion
In summary, we established an excellent bactericidal nanocomposite based on novel metals integrated semiconductors. The decoration of Ag on SnS2 maximized the LSPR of SnS2 in the NIR window, improving their photothermal conversion capability. We demonstrated that Ag@SnS2 exhibited a robust in vitro bactericidal activity, where both E. coli and S. aureus can be completely killed by Ag@SnS2 under 808 nm laser irradiation. Furthermore, the in vivo wound disinfection tests in bacteria-infected mice proved that Ag@SnS2 can efficiently cure the bacterial infection and expedite wound healing with the assistance of NIR irradiation. Therefore, the semiconductor/metal heterostructures have potential antibacterial applications, particularly suitable for clinical wound healing treatments.
