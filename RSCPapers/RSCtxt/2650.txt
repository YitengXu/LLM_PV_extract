    , Accepted 9th April 2018First published on 9th April 2018AbstractResearch on the combination of low and high-bandgap energy materials through an ion-mediated chemical transformation of the nanostructure of one material into another, especially metal chalcogenide quantum dot (QD) solar cells plays a very important role in the fast charge transformation process with high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) by reducing surface charge recombinations. Based on a coordination chemistry approach, the present study demonstrates the importance of cation-exchange process in developing bandgap engineering of tin oxide–cadmium selenide (SnO2–CdSe) with zinc selenide (ZnSe) and tin selenide (SnSe) to form SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrodes, respectively. Experimental conditions are optimized from optical and photovoltaic performances. Our best performing cation-exchange interface-modified photoelectrochemical devices, i.e., SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe have achieved improvements of 21% and 28%, respectively, in their PEC values, i.e., 3.78% and 4.41% with remarkable current densities of 19.82 and 28.40 mA cm−2 when compared with SnO2–CdSe (1.63% and 9.74 mA cm−2). This is due to (a) the fast transfer of photo-generated electrons from the CdSe QD sensitizer to SnO2 photoanode by engineering a synergistically favourable band gap and (b) mitigation of a reverse photogenerated electron flow in the presence of a high band gap buffer ZnSe/SnSe layer, which would otherwise cause excessive recombinations. A simple cation-exchange interface modification process can, in general, pave the way for improving the performance of QD-based solar cells.
1. Introduction
Developing low-cost and high-performance solar cells for light harvesting and converting photon energy into electricity is one of the most promising technologies to meet the imperative societal needs for sustainable clean energy with minimal or no detrimental environmental impacts.1 Everyday, the sun provides tremendous amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation and thus, it is a free and limitless source of energy.2 Sunlight can be directly harvested into solar energy with the use of small photovoltaic solar cells, which is the major benefit of solar energy over other conventional power generating technologies.3 Synthesis of quantum dots for solar cells is a subject of intense research activity targeting a wide range of potential applications, which are not limited to light-emitting diodes,4 photovoltaics,5 single-electron transistors,6 and fluorescent tags for biological imaging.7 The utility of nanocrystals lies in their unique size-dependent optical and electronic properties, briefly, their size-tunable optical absorption and emission spectra.8 According to these unique properties, the recent interest in utilizing QDs for harvesting light energy has drawn great attention; of particular interest are inorganic semiconductor QD-based systems, i.e., MX, where M is the metal and X is S/Se/Te as they have relatively smaller band gaps than their respective bulk counterparts, enabling them to harvest photons found in the visible and infrared regions.9,10 The inorganic semiconductor QDs, as a new kind of light harvesting materials, offer several advantages, such as high molar extinction coefficient, size-dependent bandgap, and photo-stability in addition to the availability of eco-friendly and economical synthesis methods.11 The core part of QD-based solar cells (QDSCs) is a nanocrystalline wide bandgap semiconductor photoanode, which not only provides a high surface area framework for QD deposition but also acts as a photo-generated electron diffusion pathway for the conducting substrate. In recent years, nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanodes have attracted wide interest, and they have been used in QDSCs. The highest efficiencies reported in the past few years are ∼7%.12,13 However, the low electron mobility of TiO2 causes higher charge recombination rate, which affects PCE of solar cells.14 In addition to TiO2, several studies have addressed the merits and demerits of other metal oxides such as ZnO and SnO2 in QDSCs.15–18 Among these semiconducting metal oxides, SnO2 is an n-type semiconductor with several advantageous features such as (a) two orders of magnitude greater electron mobility (SnO2: ∼100–250 cm2 V−1 s−1 and TiO2: ∼0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1),19 enabling a faster diffusion transportation of the photo-induced electrons, (b) a higher band gap (3.4 eV), which creates fewer oxidative holes in the valence band (fewer oxidative holes facilitate long-term stability and lower sensitizer degradation rate under long-term UV irradiation), and (c) several anisotropic structures, such as nanorods, nano-wires and nano-flowers of different surface-to-volume ratios, which effectively reduce the kinetic barrier for diffusion so as to obtain unique electronic and optical properties20 over TiO2 as a photoanode material. Among the various metal chalcogenide QDs reported so far, CdSe is one of the most intensively studied low-band gap semiconductors, since it has 1–3 × 105 cm−1 absorption coefficient.21 Also, its band gap can be tuned because its particle size can be varied by employing different synthesis approaches.22 However, the chemical and environmental stabilities of the CdSe semiconductors are size-dependent, as they normally possess a much higher density of surface defects in the form of dangling bonds. Under light illumination, free radicals are generated, and they can interact with species such as oxygen, resulting in an oxidization of CdSe QDs.23 To address the above-mentioned discrepancies, researchers have developed a strategy of surface coating CdS on CdSe to form CdS@CdSe with interface modification through the bandgap variation; alternatively, it can be coated with ZnS to give ZnS@CdSe to protect QDs from photo-degradation by reducing the charge recombination process in QDSCs.23,24 Chang et al. reported the benefits of ZnSe as a shell-layer in CuInS2/CdSe QDSCs.25 In addition, Yan et al. demonstrated accelerated charge separation and more efficient charge collection in solar cells sensitized with ZnSe/CdSe/ZnSe QDs.26 Moreover, Boldt et al. reported a strong charge transportation/separation process in CdS/ZnSe core/shell nanoparticles.27 Wang et al. revealed a better electron–hole pair separation in CdSe/CdS with ZnSe as CdSe/CdS/ZnSe due to proper energy band alignment.28 Despite these studies, research on QDSCs based on CdS/CdSe QDs using ZnSe as a shell-layer is not reported much, in particular the impact of ZnSe coating on charge transportation and recombination kinetics. The chemical solution-based ion-exchange transformation process (both cation–cation and anion–anion) is a conventional process used in the fabrication of various inorganic nanostructures, and this process in fact is a facile and cost-effective approach. This allows one to easily and independently control the shape, composition, structure and morphology of the product nanostructures in a simple and straightforward chemical cation/anion transformation fashion.29–34 In this approach, a solid film consisting of nanostructured materials can be immersed in a solution containing cations/anions to be exchanged with the solid film.35 The nature of the solutions can be selected depending upon the size and type of the ions to be exchanged.36 For example, silver selenide can be obtained from cadmium selenide at room temperature thorough a cation exchange process in a very short time. The kinetics of ion-exchange are limited by the diffusion barrier of the ions to be exchanged in and out of the bulk solids and thereby, complete chemical transformation of the bulk solids by the ion-exchange reaction can be hindered. In contrast to the bulk solid transformation, the high aspect ratio of nanostructured materials can effectively reduce the kinetic barrier for diffusion of ions to be exchanged, thereby lowering the activation energy for the ion-exchange reaction. Consequently, a complete chemical transformation of the nanostructure from one material into another by the ion-exchange process is well-known.37–39 The ion-exchange reactions can be qualitatively understood in terms of the hard–soft acid–base theory (i.e., soft acids react faster with soft bases and form stronger bonds, whereas hard acids react faster with hard bases and form stronger bonds).39 In the cation exchange reaction, the cations undergo replacement during the exchange reaction, whereas the anions of the species such as S/Se/Te remain the same and thereby, the shape of the nanostructured materials before and after the ion-exchange reaction can be conserved.40 The same is the case for anion exchange, where the cation remains identical before and after chemical transformation; for example, transformation of CdSe from CdO.41
In this paper, we present a simple, cost-effective and low-temperature (≤100 °C) chemical methods, i.e., chemical bath deposition and electrodeposition for synthesizing SnO2 and CdSe QDs, respectively, for obtaining SnO2/CdSe as a base electrode. Through a cationic-exchange process, the CdSe surface has been modified for ZnSe and SnSe so as to form SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrodes, respectively. These transformations are obtained through exchanging Cd with Zn and Sn through a chemical transformation process in ZnCl2 and SnCl4 precursor solutions, respectively, in alcoholic solvents. We believe that the ZnSe and SnSe ion-exchange interfacial modification layer not only provides better electron transport properties by reducing the charge carrier losses but also alleviates the interface recombination as a result of engineering perfectly matching band gap levels; SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe also exhibit enhancements in power conversion efficiencies (PECs) of 21% and 28%, respectively, over SnO2–CdSe QDSC devices.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Synthesis of SnO2
All chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade and obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further purification. All other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, including tin(IV) chloride (SnCl4, 98%), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, 98%), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4, >98%), selenium dioxide (SeO2, >99.9%), zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 99.9%), and they were used as received. The DQSC devices were fabricated on a transparent and conducting as well as charge collecting fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) glass-substrate (TEC15, Pilkington, 15 Ω cm−2). The synthesis of SnO2 on FTO was carried out using a chemical bath deposition method, as reported previously.42 In short, the FTO plates used for deposition had dimensions of 8 × 2.5 cm2. They were cleaned sequentially with detergent, acetone, ethyl alcohol, and deionized water (Milli-Q water; 18.2 MΩ cm) in an ultrasonic bath. UV irradiation was used to remove organic residues present on the FTO surface. Two pieces of substrate were inserted and kept vertically into a falcon tube containing a deposition solution of 0.2 M SnCl4 and 0.4 M CH3CSNH2 in 50 ml ethanol solvent. The chemical bath deposition, carried out at 80 °C, was terminated after a deposition time of 3 h to obtain SnS2 with considerable thickness. The brown coating of SnS2 thus obtained was washed with ethanol, naturally dried in air, and annealed at 450 °C for 1 h before its use for further experiments. Thus, whitish and transparent films of SnO2 were obtained by this process.
2.2 Electrodeposition of CdSe
Electrodeposition of CdSe was carried out at room-temperature (27 °C). Initially, aqueous solutions of 0.05 M CdSO4, a source of cations, and 0.01 M SeO2, a source of anions, were mixed in an appropriate quantity of distilled water. Electrodeposition was conducted in a three-electrode system for 30 min to control the monolayer coverage of the CdSe over SnO2. While doing this, SnO2 with 1 × 1 cm2 surface area was used as a working electrode for the electrodeposition process. A constant current density of 2 mA cm−2 was applied for 30 min in the presence of a platinum (Pt) plate as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. For a uniform coverage, the distance between the working and the counter electrodes was kept at 0.5 cm, and the electrodes were arranged parallel to each other. The obtained SnO2–CdSe electrodes were dark brown and shiny in appearance.
2.3 Cation-exchange process
The cation-exchange reaction can be qualitatively understood in terms of the hard–soft acid–base theory as discussed earlier, and it is also known as the cation–cation or anion–anion exchange process. The cation-exchange reaction in the present study was performed at room temperature (27 °C), where the prepared SnO2–CdSe electrode sample was soaked in 0.1 M ZnCl2 and 0.1 M SnCl4 solutions (prepared in ethanol solvent) for different time intervals. The resultant electrodes, i.e., SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe were washed with ethanol, dried under nitrogen air flow, and re-annealed at 250 °C for 30 min, before using them for their physical, chemical and electrochemical characterizations.
2.4 Characterizations
The surface morphologies of all the electrodes were confirmed with images recorded on a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova-SEM200-FEI). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was performed using a FEI TECNAI G2 20 STWIN equipped with a LaB6 cathode and GATAN MS794 PCCD camera. The micrographs were obtained at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. All three-electrodes were removed from the supporting substrate with a sharp-edged scalpel blade, and the powders suspended in ethanol separately were pipetted onto Formvar/carbon, 200 mesh TH, and copper grids before HR-TEM measurements. Crystal structures of these electrodes were determined using a X-ray diffractometer (XRD), and the spectra were obtained with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) (Rigaku, Miniflex 600, The Woodlands, TX, USA). For X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra, a PHI 5000 Versa Probe (Ulvac-PHI) with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV) was preferred. The data were collected from a spot-size of 100 × 100 μm2. The carbon 1s peak (284.6 eV) was used as a reference for internal calibration. The optical properties of the three electrodes were measured at room temperature using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (V-530, Jasco, Japan). Photo-electrochemical power conversion efficiencies were measured by incorporating individual cells with an active area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm, and these cells were sealed using a spacer film (50 μm thick polyester film) with polysulphide electrolyte composed of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl (for enhancing electrolyte conductivity) in a solution of methanol/water (7:3). A Pt-coated FTO used as the counter electrode was prepared by a drop-casting method. For the preparation of the counter electrode, a 0.04 M isopropanol solution of chloroplatinic acid was drop-casted onto FTO followed by air-annealing at 450 °C for 20 min. The current density–applied voltage (J–V) plots were measured on a solar simulator (Sol3A Class AAA, Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT, USA) using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit (Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) under air mass (AM) 1.5G and 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) conditions. One sun light intensity level was calibrated using the standard Si-reference cell certified by the Newport Corporation. External quantum efficiency (EQE) plots were obtained using the quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurements, Inc.) as a function of wavelength from 400 to 850 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded with an impedance analyzer (COMPACTSTATe: IVIUM Technologies, Netherland) in a frequency range of 0.01 Hz–1.5 MHz. The measurements of EIS were performed at their respective open circuit potentials under 1 sun AM 1.5G light illumination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Growth mechanism

Scheme 1 presents SnO2 growth using the CBD method on the FTO substrate. On dissociation, SnCl4 forms Sn4+ ions. Thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2) was the source of S2− ions. The concentrations of Sn4+ and S2− ions were controlled carefully so as to avoid immediate precipitation in alcoholic solution.42 The SnS2 nanoparticles were initially formed by the reaction between Sn4+ and S2− produced by hydrolysis of thioacetamide. SnS2 was converted to SnO2 on air-annealing at 450 °C for 1 h (step I). After that, CdSe QDs were grown onto SnO2 by using the electrodeposition method (step II). CdSO4 and SeO2 were the precursors for Cd2+ and Se2− ions, respectively. SnO2 was used as the working electrode in the presence of Pt and Ag/AgCl. The Cd2+ and Se2− ions could deposit on the SnO2 working electrode, resulting in dark brown and shiny SnO2–CdSe. Furthermore, the cation-exchange between Cd+2 and Zn2+ could form SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe on dipping in ZnCl2 solution. On a similar line, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe was obtained on dipping SnO2–CdSe in SnCl4 solution (step III).

3.2 Surface morphology and composition studies
For SnO2, SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrode surface analyses FESEM images at different magnifications were obtained for 30 min electrodeposited CdSe, 120 min of Zn cation-exchanged SnO2–CdSe, and 45 min Sn cation-exchanged SnO2–CdSe electrodes. The FE-SEM images demonstrated dense and uniformly distributed interconnected upright standing nanosheets of SnO2, similar to a spider-web network (Fig. 1a). Fig. S1 (ESI†) represents a cross-sectional view of SnO2 with a thickness of ∼6 μm. This type of interconnected architecture can be more beneficial over nanosphere-type as during transportation from one particle to another, the charges do not have to clear grain boundaries. The surface morphology of SnO2 shown in Fig. 1b reveals a rougher surface with CdSe than without CdSe. The formation of smaller densely packed CdSe QDs was noticed on the walls of SnO2 nanosheets. However, when these films were exposed to a cation-exchange reaction, the large surface-to-volume ratio of the obtained nanostructured materials effectively reduced the kinetic barrier for diffusion of foreign elements to penetrate through the inward diffusion force. In ESI† (Fig. S2a–f), scanning FESEM images of the Zn cation-exchanged SnO2–CdSe electrodes at various time intervals are provided, where the cation-exchange performed for a 10 min time interval revealed a transition from nanoparticles to hollow spheres. The dominant outward diffusion of Cd atoms could lead to an accumulation of vacancies at the metal/selenide interfaces in contrast to the slower inward diffusion of Zn atoms, resulting in a large void in the core.43

The ZnSe buds, with time, were newly grown on the initially formed CdSe hollow nanospheres. The thermodynamic feasibility for a cation-exchange reaction depends on the solubility product and concentration of the reactant. Ethanol, as medium, provides sufficient solvation energy for the reactants. As the morphological changes are inevitable when the size of the nanocrystals is smaller than the width of the reaction zone,44 a longer time interval is essential for complete modification of the structure and thus, the chains on the sites of SnO2–CdSe nanocrystallites were obtained (Fig. 1c). The interconnected chains were obtained through a room-temperature cation-exchange reaction. High magnification FESEM images (inset of each figure) corroborated a close change in the surface appearance of the pristine electrode with a cation-exchanged process. Furthermore, as observed in the cation-exchanged SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrode, within the first 15 min, etching of the outer CdSe nanocrystals was dominant, whereas with time the chemical transformation processed faster compared to that of Zn, which was accompanied by the higher reactivity of Sn than that of Zn ions. These chains started to grow in all directions by forming a branched-type network architecture. The high magnification images of Sn-cation-exchanged electrode for 45 min exhibit completely interconnected chain-type morphology (Fig. 1d). These chains were grown on SnO2–CdSe, which confirmed the formation of branches, i.e., a hierarchical type network at a specific time interval. However, on increasing the time interval further to 60 min, these networks of self-assembled nanocrystallite chains disrupted (Fig. S3a–d, ESI†) and due to inadequate mechanical strength,45 the whole structure collapsed. The pristine SnO2 nanosheets were still present and only CdSe nanocrystallites covering them were taking part in the cation-exchange reaction process. Hence, substantial air-voids found in-between these nanosheets could connect to these chains in the process of chemical transformation. To analyse the crystallinity change, optimized SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes were scanned using HR-TEM. SnO2 nanosheets of irregular dimensions can be seen in the low-magnification HR-TEM image (Fig. 1e). No obvious difference in the surface appearance was noticed from the HRTEM images of SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe (Fig. 1f–h). However, the selected area electron diffraction patterns of all the photoanodes, shown as insets of Fig. 1e–h, demonstrated considerable change in rings on surface modifications. Instead of spots or cloudy patterns, well-defined rings were obtained, supporting the idea of a nanocrystalline nature. The SnO2–CdSe and SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe electrodes were defect-free and more nanocrystalline than SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrodes, as previous SAED patterns were continuous and sharp, whereas the latter patterns were with an additional spots, supporting the theory of a surface modification effect with ZnSe and SnSe. Fig. S4a–c (ESI†) confirms the EDX spectrums scanned on 1 × 1 cm2 SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanode surfaces with Sn, O, Cd, Zn and Se elements mappings. The existence of Zn and Sn peaks supported the concept of an effective process of cation-exchange on the SnO2–CdSe electrode surface, evidencing the formation of ZnSe and SnSe by replacing Cd ions from CdSe with Zn and Sn ions, respectively, to form SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe electrodes.
3.3 Structural elucidation
The XRD spectra corroborated intense and distinct peaks of SnO2, CdSe, ZnSe and SnSe (Fig. 2). The observed reflection peaks were compared with the peaks reported in JCPDS files (SnO2-41-1445, CdSe-08-0459, ZnSe-15-0105, and SnSe-32-1382). The observed (110), (101), (200), (211), (220), (310), and (112) reflection peaks indexed well to the characteristic diffraction peaks of phase pure SnO2. The reflection positions of (100), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (112) peaks corresponded to CdSe, whereas the peaks at 27.89° (101) and 45.41° (110) were assigned to ZnSe. From the JCPDS data card for SnSe, i.e., 32-1382 and appearance of (201), (311), (102), (511), (212), (122), (800) and (901) planes in XRD spectrum, the formation of SnSe was evidenced.

As peaks of SnSe and SnO2 were close to each other, the peaks appearing at various intervals were from both SnO2 and SnSe, i.e., the peaks at 37.76° and 37.95° for SnSe and SnO2 were (311) and (200), respectively. As few peaks of SnSe were very close to those of CdSe, for example, SnSe-41.28° (102) and CdSe-41.44° (110), it was tedious to draw a conclusion for the presence of SnSe using XRD analysis, which therefore was confirmed qualitatively from the morphology change and from the XPS analysis as there was a distinct peak for Sn from SnSe on SnO2–CdSe. XPS measurements were performed to investigate the chemical states of SnO2, SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes. The peaks for Sn, O, C and Sn, O, Cd, Se, C were noticed in the XPS survey spectra of SnO2 and SnO2–CdSe, respectively (Fig. S5a and b, ESI†). The XPS survey spectra recorded after the cation-exchange process for SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe configurations (Fig. S5c and d, ESI†) demonstrated presence of respective Sn, O, Cd, Zn, Se, C and Sn, O, Cd, Sn, Se, C elemental peaks. To be more specific, the high-resolution XPS spectrum for Sn3d (Fig. 3a) revealed the spin–orbital splitting of the Sn3d5/2 and Sn3d3/2 states centred at 486.1 eV and 495.2 eV, respectively, which were close to the values for SnO2.

Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of the O1s region. The peak at 530.1 eV was assigned to the lattice oxygen in SnO2.43 The peak at a higher binding energy located at 532.3 eV was considered to be due to presence of oxygen impurities other than the lattice oxygen such as O2−, O− or O2−.46 The XPS spectra in Fig. 3c and d confirmed that the binding energies of 404 eV and 409.8 eV for Cd3d5/2 and Cd3d3/2, respectively, and the peaks at 53.9 eV and 57.2 eV for Se3d5/2 and Se3d3/2, respectively, supporting CdSe formation. Two symmetric peaks at 1021.7 eV and 1045.3 eV for the binding energies of Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2, respectively, were observed for the Zn2p region, and they were in accordance with the existence of Zn2+ in SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe photoanode (Fig. 3e).47 The Sn3d5/2 (494.3 eV) and Sn3d3/2 (486.2 eV) doublets, consistent with values reported for stoichiometric SnSe deposits, were deconvoluted into contributions from low binding energy components due to Sn in SnSe.48
3.4 Optical and PEC measurements
To understand the efficiency enhancement in QDSCs, we measured the absorption spectra of all the photoanodes (Fig. 4a). Three photoanodes showed a wide range absorbance from 350 to 700 nm in the visible region spectra. However, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photo-anodes had higher absorbance area than SnO2–CdSe. The absorption edge shift qualitatively demonstrated an increase in overall electrode thickness and/or change of density due to the formation of ZnSe and SnSe layers by the cation-exchange reaction, leading to near IR region absorption of the solar spectrum. We believed that this increase in absorption could be one of the major reasons for an improved PEC performance in the cation-exchange process. Fig. 4b shows the J–V measurements for three electrodes, viz., SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe as QDSCs, and the recorded electronic parameters for these electrodes are summarized in Table 1.

The SnO2–CdSe photoanode exhibited relatively poor QDSC performance with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.46 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.74 mA cm−2, fill factor (ff) of 0.36%, and PEC (η%) of 1.63. Through a controlled cation-exchange reaction time, PEC improvements of about 3.78 (21%) and 4.41 (28%) for SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes compared to 1.63% PEC for SnO2–CdSe were noted. The main reason to carry out the cation-exchange reaction of CdSe nanocrystallites with Zn and Sn ions was ∼2.8 and ∼1.1 eV band gap energies of ZnSe and SnSe, respectively. It was believed that ZnSe/SnSe could (a) block the reverse flow of photo-generated electrons and also (b) promote an additional photosensitive layer by extending the solar spectrum absorption thus helping in generating more photo-electrons for a high current density. To optimize the cation-exchange time duration, the cell performances of the SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes for various cation-exchange time durations, i.e., 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 min and 15, 30, 45, 60 min, respectively, were also measured and reported (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†). The SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes obtained at 10 and 15 min cation-exchange time durations exhibited poor PCE performances of 1.94% and 2.37%, respectively, which could be due to the formation of extremely thin ZnSe and SnSe layers on account of a low cation-exchange time. The increase in the cation-exchange time duration led to a slight improvement in the PCE performance, and the best performances, i.e., 3.78% and 4.41% were obtained at 120 min and 45 min cation-exchange reaction time durations for ZnSe and SnSe layers, respectively. This indicated that the 150 min and 60 min cation-exchange reaction deposition times resulted in higher thicknesses of ZnSe and SnSe layers, which could hinder the charge transfer process by increasing the recombination centres. For the rest of the measurements, 120 min and 45 min cation-exchange reaction times were fixed for SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes, respectively. To understand the influence of the ZnSe and SnSe cation-exchange reaction times on SnO2–CdSe PEC performances, EQE spectra were also obtained (Fig. 4c), where SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes demonstrated higher EQEs in the visible region (∼70% and ∼80%, respectively) than the SnO2–CdSe photo-anode (∼40%). The enhancement in EQE after ZnSe and SnSe cation-exchange layering was an indication of the efficient and fast photon-to-current conversion process kinetics, enhanced light scattering ability, and effective suppression of recombination centers. The results of the EQE spectrums were in close agreement to those approved by optical studies for the respective photoanodes. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements provide evidence for the existence of photo-induced charge transfer and charge recombination loss processes, if there are any. Fig. 4d presents the PL spectra of FTO-free SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes. The significant PL quenching in SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanode layers compared to that in the SnO2–CdSe photoanode layer indicated an effective charge transfer process well-before the carrier recombination at the interface by improving the electron extraction rate from the CdSe QD sensitizer layer due to formation of favourable energy band positions compared to that observed for SnO2–CdSe through the cation-exchange process.
The typical structure and principle of QD-based solar cells is similar to those of dye sensitized solar cells in which the dye molecules are replaced with the QD sensitizer.49,50 QDSCs consist of a photoanode (SnO2), a sensitizer (CdSe), an electrolyte (polysulfide) and a counter electrode (Pt).51,52 Under illumination, photons captured by the sensitizer inject electrons into the conduction band of the photo-anode, followed by releasing the holes regenerated at the counter electrode by the polysulfide electrolyte.53,54 To obtain a clear understanding of the charge transfer pathways through the photoanode, energy band diagrams of FTO/SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe/Pt and FTO/SnO2–CdSe/SnSe/Pt were depicted based on their appropriate band levels (Fig. 5). A favorable match in the conduction band positions of SnO2 and CdSe sensitizer facilitates fast charge collection/transfer, influencing advanced PCE in QDSCs.55,56 Photo-generated electrons (e−, green dots and arrow) and holes (h+, white dots and arrow) in the conduction band and the valence band of the CdSe QD sensitizer layer are expected to be captured by SnO2 and Pt-metal counter electrode, respectively. When there is no ZnSe interfacial layer (Fig. 5a), the electrons in the conduction band of SnO2 can be extracted from the CdSe QD sensitizer layer and may flow back to the interface of CdSe for recombination with the holes in its valence band of or redox polysulfide electrolyte species. In presence of ZnSe/SnSe interfacial layer, the electrons in the conduction band of CdSe absorber transfer to SnO2 (3.6 eV) by a tunneling effect, rather than moving back to either the valence band or redox electrolyte species. Therefore, the ZnSe/SnSe layer acts as a physical barrier between SnO2–CdSe and polysulfide electrolyte to hinder the charge recombinations occurring mainly at the interface, which increases the PCE value. The conduction band levels of ZnSe and SnSe are higher than those of SnO2, which plays a crucial role as an energy barrier so that electrons mostly relax into the conduction band of SnO2 and transfer to the charge collecting electrode, i.e., FTO instead to the valence band of CdSe and/or polysulfide electrolyte (indicated by white dots and arrows).

3.5 Charge transport kinetics
EIS is a simple but useful method to investigate the charge recombination resistance and various interfacial properties involved in QDSCs. Fig. 5 presents the Nyquist plots of SnO2–CdSe, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe, and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes under 1 sun illumination where two distinct semicircles (one in the high frequency range and another in the low-frequency range) measured over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz are noticed. The series resistance (Rs), related to the wirings and contacts from the transparent and conducting FTO substrate used, was measured in the high-frequency region. The interface resistance between counter electrode and electrolyte (R1) and that in the low frequency range corresponding to charge transfer resistance (R2) across electrolyte/sensitizer/photoanode and chemical capacitance (CPE1)57 were fitted. In the Nyquist plots, the length of the second semicircle (R2) was a parameter affecting the performance of QDSCs greatly, as other factors were nearly the same. A moderate difference was noted for R2 recorded for different photoanodes. The SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photo anodes confirmed ∼81.3 Ω and ∼68.2 Ω R2 values, whereas, the R2 value for SnO2–CdSe photo-anode was ∼110.1 Ω (see Table S2, ESI† for more details). The lower R2 values in former electrodes were assigned to an easy transportation and collection of photo-generated electrons with fewer chances of recombination58 when compared with those in latter electrode (Fig. 6).

4. Conclusion
A controlled, cost-effective cation exchange chemical transformation process was applied at room-temperature for improving the PEC performances of SnO2–CdSe QDSCs. On exchanging Zn2+ with Cd2+ ions and Sn4+ with Cd2+, SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes with PEC performances of 3.78 and 4.41, respectively, were obtained. These PEC values were nearly 21% and 28% higher than that of the PEC value of SnO2–CdSe, which was 1.63%, and this was due to an increase in the current densities, i.e., 190% and 270% on forming the ZnSe and SnSe layers, respectively. Both SnO2–CdSe/ZnSe and SnO2–CdSe/SnSe photoanodes showed a four-fold enhancement in PCE of SnO2–CdSe/SnSe compared to SnO2–CdSe. This was due to (a) smaller band gap energies of product photoanodes, which could absorb light in the IR region, (b) the formation of the favorable band gap between material/materials and/or material/electrolyte interfaces, which could enhance the scattering effect by suppressing the recombination centers for higher charge collection efficiency and faster electron transportation, and (c) the formation of an unknown novel phase such as CdSnSe2 (which in fact was not evidenced).
