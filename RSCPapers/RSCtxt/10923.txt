    , Accepted 11th May 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen evolution, as an environmental-friendly, energy-saving and simple process, has been widely reported. However, there are some important factors that prohibit practical application of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the low efficiency of solar energy utilization, and the lack of response in the dark. Temperature fluctuation is a very common phenomenon in our daily life, which is rarely reported for use for hydrogen production. Here we demonstrate direct hydrogen evolution through the harvesting of cold–hot 298–323 K (25–50 °C) alternation energy by using pyroelectric nanomaterial Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 (BST). The yield of hydrogen achieved was 46.89 μmol per gram of catalyst after 36 thermal cycles and the rate of hydrogen generation was up to 1.30 μmol g−1 per thermal cycle. The minimum of the conduction band of BST is more negative than the conduction band level of H+/H2, enabling the reduction of water to form hydrogen. This efficient and eco-friendly pyro-catalytic method provides a promising future for hydrogen evolution utilizing natural cold–hot temperature fluctuation energy.

Broader context
Temperature fluctuation, such as day-and-night temperature variation, is a common phenomenon that should be regarded as one of the Earth's sustainable energy sources. In a typical photocatalytic process, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs can promote the splitting of water for hydrogen evolution. Similarly, thermoelectric or pyroelectric materials can generate positive and negative electric charges under thermal excitation which can convert thermal energy directly to electrical or chemical energy, which can then be used for hydrogen evolution. Thermoelectric materials need to have a temperature difference between both ends of the material to transport charge based on the Seebeck effect, while pyroelectric materials only require time-dependent temperature fluctuations. Pyroelectric materials can be repeatedly heated and cooled to generate usable electrical power with a high energy conversion efficiency. It would be very desirable to utilize natural temperature fluctuations such as the day/night cycle for hydrogen production. Up to now, there has rarely been a report on hydrogen generation by pyroelectric nanomaterials through the harvesting of room-temperature cold–hot alternation energy. Here, the direct generation of hydrogen by the pyroelectric nanomaterial barium strontium titanate is realized under room-temperature cold–hot fluctuations.

1. Introduction
Energy plays a crucial role in the development of human society. As the main energy source, fossil fuels are quickly being depleted on the one hand and bringing about global warming through the emission of greenhouse gases on the other, leading to serious global environmental issues.1,2 There is an urgent need to search for a new renewable clean energy.3 Hydrogen, coming from the abundant water resource and producing water again after being used, is not only environmentally friendly, but also reusable, becoming the new welcome energy in human society. Photocatalytic hydrogen production, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through photo-induced electron–hole pairs, is an environmental friendly, energy-saving and simple process that has been widely reported.4,5 However, there are some important factors that prohibit practical application of photocatalytic hydrogen production, including the low efficiency of solar energy utilization, and the lack of response in the dark.6
Temperature fluctuation, a very common phenomenon in our living environment, can be considered as a clean natural energy source.7 In a typical photocatalytic process, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs can promote the splitting of water for hydrogen evolution.4,5 Similarly, thermoelectric and pyroelectric materials can generate positive and negative electric charges under thermal excitation to convert thermal energy to electrical energy,8,9 which has the potential to be utilized for hydrogen evolution. Thermoelectric materials need to have a temperature difference between both ends of the material to transport charge relying on the Seebeck effect, while pyroelectric materials only require time-dependent temperature fluctuations.8 Pyroelectric materials can generate usable electrical power with a high energy conversion efficiency under repeated heating and cooling. Fang et al. performed numerical simulations on a 0.9PbMg1/3Nb2/3–0.1PbTiO3 thin film pyroelectric converter that harvests nanoscale thermal radiation.10 The simulations showed that an efficiency of 1.35% and an electrical power output of 6.5 mW cm−2 were achieved for cold and hot sources at 283 and 383 K, respectively.10 Huang et al. reported an energy density of 128 mJ cm−3 harvested in pyroelectric Ba1−xSrxTiO3 (x = 0.35) film under thermal cycling between 77 and 2 °C.11 A pyroelectric heat engine working in a thermal cycle can, in theory, generate usable electrical power reaching 84–92% Carnot efficiency.12,13 Olsen et al. reported that the practical efficiency of a pyroelectric engine based on Pb0.99[Nb0.02(Zr0.68Sn0.25Ti0.07)0.98]O3 may reach 10–20%.14 Therefore, pyroelectric materials could deliver a higher energy conversion efficiency than photocatalytic materials do based on the photovoltaic effect. Xie et al. reported pyro-driven control of an electrochemical process and its application to water-splitting by using an external pyroelectrically-induced charge source with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thin films.15 Belitz et al. investigated a BaTiO3-based pyroelectric powder coated container combined with a thermal cycle system to drive hydrogen generation.16 Kakekhani et al. theoretically proved the feasibility of water splitting via a pyroelectric process.17–20 Nanomaterials with small size and high surface area often have high catalytic activity. Experimental reports on hydrogen generation using pyroelectric nanomaterials to directly harvest room-temperature cold–hot alternation energy are still limited up to now.21
Barium strontium titanate (Ba1−xSrxTiO3), a kind of ABO3-type perovskite,11 is a superior pyroelectric material because of the non-centrosymmetrical lattice.22 For different Sr content (x value from 0 to 0.30), the best pyroelectric signal appears at x = 0.30.23 The pyroelectric coefficient of Ba0.70Sr0.30TiO3 (BST) can reach 8 nC cm−2 K−1.24 In theory, nanomaterials with small size and high surface area can speed up the electric charge migration between water and the pyroelectric materials, which may increase the rate and efficiency of hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the outdoor surface temperature under direct sunshine in summer can be as high as 340 K, which is beneficial for hydrogen evolution by pyrocatalytic water splitting using day-and-night temperature alternations in the future.
In this work, pyroelectric BST nanomaterials were synthesized via a hydrothermal assisted sol–gel method. The performance of the pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution of BST was tested under room-temperature cold–hot cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Barium acetate (Ba(CH3COO)2, ≧99.0%), strontium acetate (Sr(CH3COO)2, ≧99.0%), acetic acid (CH3COOH, ≧98.0%), tetrabutyl titanate (Ti(C4H9O)4, ≧98.5%), ethylene glycol monomethylether (CH3OCH2CH2OH, ≧99.0%), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16H33(CH3)3NBr, ≧99.0%), and ethanol (C2H6O, 99.7%) used in the reaction were all of analytical grade. Nafion and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, ≧99.0%) were used during the process of pyro-electrochemical measurements. Methanol (≧99.9%) was applied in the process of pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution measurement. All of the chemicals were used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the whole experiment.
2.2 Synthesis of BST
BST was prepared through a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel method. Briefly, 1.788 g of barium acetate Ba(CH3COO)2 and 0.725 g of strontium acetate Sr(CH3COO)2 with a molar ratio of 7:3 were dissolved in 20 mL of acetic acid at 80 °C, respectively. After these powders dissolved, colorless solutions were obtained which were then mixed together with continuous stirring at a speed of 400 rpm for 15 min. This mixture was marked as Solution A. Meanwhile, 3.52 mL of tetrabutyl titanate Ti(C4H9O)4 was added into 16 mL of ethylene glycol monomethylether, producing a yellowish-brown solution, which was added into Solution A dropwise. Then, 0.1 g of C16H33(CH3)3NBr was added into the solution, which was then transferred to a Teflon cup with 80% capacity. Thereafter, the Teflon cup was sealed tightly in a stainless steel autoclave with continuous stirring at a speed of 500 rpm at 120 °C for 6 h until the solution changed from yellowish to milky white. After that, the solution was continuously stirred at 60 °C for 3 h in a beaker. The final sample was annealed at 500 °C for 1 h and 800 °C for 3 h (SG-XL1100, China) and ball-milled into powder before characterization.
2.3 Characterization
The crystalline structure of the synthesized BST powder was characterized at room temperature with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, MiniFlex600, Japan) using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 2θ = 10°–80°). The elemental analysis and elemental mapping of BST nanoparticles were carried out via energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Phenom proX, the Netherlands). The morphologies and microstructures of the BST particles were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Phenom proX, the Netherlands), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL2100F, Japan) with the acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The particle size distribution of BST was characterized with a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments ZS90, UK). The elemental composition of the as-prepared BST was measured with an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi, USA) with the Al Kα X-ray as the excitation source. The piezoelectric performance was characterized with piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM, MFP-3D, USA). The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant was measured with an LCR analyzer (HP4194A USA) connected to a temperature control stage (HFS600E-PB2, Linkam, UK). The ferroelectric hysteresis loop (P–E hysteresis loop) of BST was measured via a ferroelectric analyzer (Precision Multiferroic, USA).
2.4 Pyro-electrochemical measurements
The preparation for the sample measurements was as follows: 5.0 mg of as-prepared BST sample was uniformly mixed firstly with 10 μL of Nafion, then 10 μL of ethanol. The paste was then uniformly coated onto one side of an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass. The BST-coated electrode area is 1 cm2. Subsequently, the coated ITO glass was dried at 60 °C for 1 h in vacuum. The pyro-electrochemical analysis of the as-prepared BST electrode was conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China) in an electrochemical cell with a flat quartz window to allow infrared heating of the front side of the anode. Pt was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The pyroelectric current of BST was detected under the stimulation of different temperature gradients. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of BST was carried out in the frequency range from 1 to 105 Hz. The Mott–Schottky plot of BST was taken at a frequency of 1 kHz. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of BST was recorded with an UV-vis-near-IR spectrophotometer (CARY 5000, USA).
2.5 Pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution measurement
To investigate the pyro-catalytic hydrogen yield performance of the as-prepared sample, 10 mg of BST powder was dispersed in 10 mL of a DI water/methanol mixture (20 vol% methanol). Methanol was used as a sacrificial agent for pyro-induced positive charges. The pyro-catalytic activity for hydrogen production was evaluated offline. Thermal cycles between 298 and 323 K were run in a water bath. In a typical experiment, the mixture was sonicated to form a uniform suspension in a 35 mL borosilicate tube, followed by purging the tube with N2 to eliminate air. The tube was properly sealed during the pyro-catalytic process. To confirm the hydrogen evolution, 1.5 mL of the generated gas was sampled and analyzed by a gas chromatograph (7890B, USA) through manual injections using a thermal conductivity detector with N2 as the carrier gas.25,26 Hydrogen evolution was estimated by a standard calibration curve. The pyro-catalytic reaction was conducted for 36 thermal cycles (10 min per thermal cycle). All glassware was carefully rinsed with distilled water prior to use.
3. Results and discussion
A typical XRD pattern of the BST powder is shown in Fig. 1a. The characteristic peaks at 22.3°, 31.7°, 39.2°, 45.4°, 56.6°, 66.3° and 75.5° correspond to the (100), (101), (111), (002), (211), (202) and (310) planes, respectively, showing a tetragonal perovskite phase with high crystallinity (JCPDS card No. 44-0093, space group: P4mm). No other impurity peaks can be detected in the diffractogram. EDX characterization shows the existence of Ba, O, Ti, and Sr in the BST sample (Fig. 1b). The Al detected comes from the sample carrier. Fig. 1c shows that the BST nanoparticles are cube-shaped with a uniform size of 200 nm, in agreement with the particle size distribution map (Fig. 1d).

Fig. 2a represents the wide-scan XPS of BST nanoparticles in the binding energy range of 1000–0 eV. All the binding energies of Ba, O, Ti, and Sr elements were calibrated using the binding energy of C 1s. The detailed XPS patterns from high to low binding energies are given in Fig. 2b–e. Gaussian fittings were used to separate the overlapping peaks into different parts. Fig. 2b shows that the Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2 peaks can be fitted by two peaks, marked as 1 and 2. Peak number 1 corresponds to Ba atoms in the ABO3 perovskite structure and peak number 2 corresponds to Ba atoms in the nonperovskite structure.15Fig. 2c shows the non-symmetric O 1s peak being fitted by two peaks, numbered as 1 and 2, which might be due to the existence of an OH group on the surface.16 The spectra of the Ti 2p3/2 peak and the Ti 2p1/2 peak are shown in Fig. 2d, which can be fitted by two separated peaks. It can be found that all the peaks are well symmetric and the intensities of the Ti3+ peaks are negligible. Both Sr 3d5/2 and Sr 3d5/2 shown in Fig. 2e can be fitted by two peaks, marked as line 1 and 2, respectively. Peak number 1 corresponds to Sr atoms in the ABO3 perovskite structure and peak number 2 corresponds to Sr atoms in the nonperovskite structure, similar to Ba 3d.27 The results in Fig. 2b–e confirm the existence of Ba2+, O2−, Ti4+ and Sr2+ in the BST nanoparticles, respectively.28

Fig. 3a shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the BST nanoparticles. The average size of the BST nanoparticles is approximately 200 nm and the overlapped shadows in the TEM image show the cubic shape. The HRTEM shows that the BST nanoparticle is single crystalline with a lattice spacing of 0.282 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane of BST. Moreover, the high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Fig. 3b) as well as the corresponding EDX mapping images (Fig. 3c–f) show that the Ba, Sr, Ti and O elements are all dispersed uniformly in the BST sample.

Studies found that all ferroelectric materials have pyroelectric properties.29,30 The crystallographic symmetry is closely related to the piezo-/pyroelectric effect. Due to the isotropic symmetry of ferroelectric bulk materials, poling is necessary to align the randomly oriented domains in order to obtain a macroscopic piezo-/pyroelectric effect. However, chemically-synthesized piezo-/pyroelectric micro/nanomaterial particles often grow along a certain crystallographic direction and can possess crystal anisotropy and spontaneous ferroelectric polarization.21,31,32 Therefore, unlike the bulk material, ferroelectric nano-particles show pyro-/piezoelectric performance without undergoing the poling process.33–35 Yu et al. reported that the piezoelectric constant d33 of BaTiO3-based nanomaterials can be up to 13 pC N−1.33 Wang et al. reported that the d33 of BaTiO3 nanowires reaches 45 pC N−1.36 Hence, the synthesized BST nanocrystal is able to show pyro-/piezoelectric performance without poling.
PFM was used to explore the local piezoelectric response of the BST nanoparticle. The dual AC resonance tracking (DART) PFM modes were utilized, which could enhance the contrast of the amplitude and phase images and reduce the topographical crosstalk while mapping the local electromechanical properties. Conductive cantilevers (ASYELEC-01) with tip coatings of Ti/Ir (5/20) were used. The nominal spring constants were 2 N m−1 with a fundamental resonance frequency of the free tip-vibration (non-contact resonance) of approximately 70 kHz. The PFM probe was applied to the BST nanoparticle and an alternate voltage of 2 V was applied under different DC bias fields. The deformation of the fiber was detected by the laser interferometer and processed with a lock-in amplifier. A representative AFM morphology, PFM amplitude and phase image are shown in Fig. 4a–d, with a scanning area of 500 × 500 nm2. A slow scanning frequency of 1 Hz was adopted. A clear contrast can be observed from the phase image (Fig. 4c), indicating different polarization directions. The local piezoelectric hysteresis loops of the BST are shown in Fig. 4d and e. Both the “on” state (under this condition, the electrostatic interaction may also contribute greatly to the displacement in addition to the piezoelectric displacement contribution) and “off” state (generally regarded as the piezoelectric contribution) were characterized. The phase angle exhibits a 180° change under a 40 V DC bias field, confirming the occurrence of a polarization switching process. The butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop also verifies the excellent local ferro-/piezoelectric response. Thereby good pyroelectric properties of BST are expected.

To better demonstrate the pyroelectric properties of BST, the pyroelectric current of BST under different temperature changes was measured. These data are shown in Fig. 5a–c. The measured pyroelectric current was 2.8, 3.0 and 4.0 nA under the temperature variation (ΔT) of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.45 K, respectively. The pyroelectric coefficient can be described as8 I = p·A(dT/dt)(1)where I and p are the pyroelectric current and the pyroelectric coefficient of BST, respectively. A is the BST-coated electrode area (1 cm2). dT/dt is the rate of temperature fluctuation. According to eqn (1), the average pyroelectric coefficient p can be calculated as 156 nC cm−2 K−1, which is roughly an order of magnitude higher than previously reported.23,24 Two factors may contribute to the significantly enhanced pyroelectric coefficient. One is that the large surface area of the BST nanoparticle is helpful to enhance thermal exchange, resulting in a larger pyroelectric current output.11,37 The other is the size effect of nanoparticles, which normally results in an enhanced pyroelectric coefficient due to a lower defect density than the bulk counterpart.38 Some nanowires have already demonstrated enhanced piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties compared with their bulk counterparts.39,40

It can be seen that the pyroelectric current I can be increased by enhancing the rate of temperature change, which is consistent with the experimental results. According to eqn (1), the pyro-induced electric charge Q can be given by Q = I·dt = p·A·ΔT(2)where Q is the pyro-induced electric charge. dt is the time taken for the temperature change (ΔT). The pyroelectric coefficient p is the proportionality constant of the polarization intensity (Q/A) versus the temperature change (ΔT).8 Electrochemical impedance measurements were done under several very small temperature changes of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.45 K, where the pyroelectric coefficient p was essentially a constant. With the slight increase of temperature, the induced electric charges on the BST particle surface increase, resulting in a small decrease of the resistance R of the solution in the electrochemical measurement. Fig. 5d shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots for different temperature fluctuations of 0.1 K, 0.2 K and 0.45 K, in which the radius of the semicircles denotes the resistance originating from the pyro-induced electric charge transferring into solution.41 The smaller radius of the semicircular Nyquist plot shown in Fig. 5d means more pyro-induced electric charges under the wider temperature fluctuation.
The Curie temperature TC is a temperature at which ferroelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarization and the materials become paraelectric.20 Large pyroelectric current can be obtained near the ferroelectric–paraelectric phase transition temperature TC,17,20 due to the quick decrease of polarization charges in a narrow temperature range. Bhardwaj et al. reported an ultrahigh reactivity of Ba1−xSrxTiO3 (x = 0.26) at the Curie temperature.42 Huang et al. reported a significant polarization variation of 5.2 μC cm−2 near room temperature in Ba1−xSrxTiO3 (x = 0.35) and a high pyroelectric energy harvesting density of 128 mJ cm−3, which was calculated based on the polarization variation due to thermal cycling between 77 °C and 2 °C.11 When a pyroelectric material is subjected to cyclic temperature change near TC, the pyroelectric charges will dissociate H2O molecules to form atomic hydrogen on the negatively polarized surface below TC. The hydrogen atoms then combine to form weakly bound H2 and escape, leaving a clean surface for the next thermal cycle.17 To maximize the pyroelectric effect of Ba1−xSrxTiO3 at room-temperature, the molar fraction of Sr (x) was chosen to be 0.3 in our pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution experiment.

Fig. 6a shows the dielectric constant of the Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 as a function of temperature measured at different frequencies. The dielectric constant peak at 305 K corresponds to the Curie temperature: the transition from a ferroelectric phase to a paraelectric one.43 Considering the Curie temperature of Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 and the temperature fluctuation of our living environment, cold–hot thermal cycles between 298 K and 323 K (simulating the diurnal temperature change range) were chosen in our pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution experiment (Fig. 6b). The whole experiment was conducted in a water bath in darkness to avoid photocatalysis.

To demonstrate the pyro-catalytic performance of BST, hydrogen evolution was measured during the pyro-catalytic water-splitting process under room-temperature fluctuations, with/without the addition of methanol (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7b, the hydrogen yield increases with thermal cycle number and achieves 46.89 μmol g−1 after 36 thermal cycles with the addition of methanol. The rate of hydrogen evolution for BST with the addition of sacrificial methanol is around 1.3 μmol g−1 per thermal cycle (298–323 K, 10 min), comparable with the reported photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of 3.0 μmol g−1.44 In contrast, the yield of pyrocatalytic hydrogen only reaches a negligibly small value of 0.75 μmol g−1 after 36 thermal cycles without the addition of methanol (Fig. 7d).

An enormous number of studies have demonstrated that photocatalysts suffer from rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and severe photocorrosion, which adversely affect the photocatalytic efficiency.45,46 To solve these problems, sacrificial electron donors have been frequently added into the reaction system to consume the photogenerated holes.25,45,46 The mechanism of the pyrocatalytic effect is quite similar to that of the photocatalytic one. It includes two steps: (1) pyroelectric charge carriers are generated under thermal fluctuation, and (2) the generated charge carriers then participate in redox reactions to generate hydrogen. This second step is almost the same as in the photocatalytic case.47 The low yield of pyro-catalytic hydrogen with BST without the addition of methanol may result from the rapid recombination of pyro-generated positive and negative charges. Due to the rich hydrogen source in methanol, the addition of methanol may also contribute to the measured hydrogen yield of the catalytic product.48 However, as demonstrated in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by pure titanium dioxide or heterogeneous palladium–cadmium sulfide with alcohol as a sacrificial electron donor, the majority of hydrogen originates from water instead of alcohol, based on isotopic water splitting measurements using D2O.49,50 This new and effective method of pyro-driven hydrogen production using cold–hot temperature fluctuations could significantly impact the field of renewable energy.
To analyze the mechanism of hydrogen evolution, the band structures of BST were taken into consideration. Fig. 8a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra converted from diffuse reflectance spectra of BST. Kubelka–Munk function extracted information from the absorption spectra data is presented in Fig. 8b, revealing a direct band gap (Eg) value of 3.08 eV for BST. The Mott–Schottky plot of BST recorded at 1 kHz is presented in Fig. 8c, which can yield the flat band energy (Ef) of BST through the intercept of the horizontal coordinate. The Ef of BST measured is −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which can be converted into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential via the Nernst equation.51 ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 pH + 0.1976 V(3)where the pH value of the Na2SO4 electrolyte is 6.8. Thus, the calculated Ef of BST is −0.2012 V vs. RHE (pH = 6.8). The positive slope indicates that BST is a n-type semiconductor.51 The Ef is about 0.3 V below the minimum of the conduction band (CB) for undoped n-type semiconductors.52 Hence, the minimum of the CB of BST is −0.5012 V vs. RHE (pH = 6.8). The energy band level of BST was drawn accordingly in Fig. 8d. The conduction band level of H+/H2 (pH = 7.0) is about −0.0118 V vs. RHE (pH = 6.8), which is more positive than the minimum of the CB of BST, leading to the reduction of water to form hydrogen.53

The ferroelectric performance of BST was analyzed and the P–E hysteresis loop of BST was traced at a frequency of 50 Hz (Fig. 8e). When the applied electric field increases to 600 kV cm−1, the polarization reaches a saturation value of 38 μC cm−2, indicating good ferroelectric properties of BST. The inset of Fig. 8e is a schematic diagram displaying the circuit of the P–E hysteresis loop measurement, where the BST nanoparticle film was laid on a mica substrate and Au acts as the two electrodes.
The mechanism of pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution through BST is illustrated in Fig. 8f. When the temperature is changed by ΔT, the pyroelectric BST generates positive and negative charges on the surface of the material, as shown in eqn (4). The pyro-induced positive charge (q+) can oxidize water molecules H2O adsorbed on the surface of BST, producing the hydrogen ion (H+) and oxygen O2. The H+ can further react with the pyro-induced negative charge (q−) to form hydrogen, as shown in eqn (5),54 (4) 2H+ + 2q− → H2(g)(5)
The sacrificial agent methanol has been proposed to react with the pyro-induced q+ positive charges, producing H+ and a hydroxyalkyl radical intermediate (˙CH2OH).55
Recently, photocatalytic water splitting without the use of a sacrificial agent has been reported for some phosphorus-doped photocatalysts.46,56 Hong et al. reported piezo-catalytic water splitting by piezoelectric BaTiO3 microdendrites under vibration. In their paper they reported that pure water was split into hydrogen and oxygen gases with a stoichiometric ratio of H2/O2 (2:1).57 Visible light photocatalytic water splitting by BaTiO3-based materials was also achieved.58 Kakekhani et al. theoretically proved that the pyro-catalytic products of water splitting should include not only H2, but also O2.17 Therefore, it is expected that the full reaction of water splitting by pyro-catalytic means will be realized in the near future. Moreover, the pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution from BST demonstrated in this work may be further enhanced by doping the nanoparticle catalysts with a single metal atom.59 The pyro-catalytic effect of BST also has potential for wastewater treatment or energy harvesting devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a new and efficient method of hydrogen evolution by pyroelectric BST was found which exhibited a high yield of hydrogen gas (46.89 μmol g−1) after experiencing 36 thermal cycles between 298 K and 323 K. The rate of hydrogen generation was up to 1.30 μmol g−1 per thermal cycle. This new efficient and eco-friendly pyro-catalytic hydrogen evolution technique based on the pyroelectric nanomaterial BST provides great potential in utilizing environmental cold–hot energy near room-temperature.

Broader context
Temperature fluctuation, such as day-and-night temperature variation, is a common phenomenon that should be regarded as one of the Earth's sustainable energy sources. In a typical photocatalytic process, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs can promote the splitting of water for hydrogen evolution. Similarly, thermoelectric or pyroelectric materials can generate positive and negative electric charges under thermal excitation which can convert thermal energy directly to electrical or chemical energy, which can then be used for hydrogen evolution. Thermoelectric materials need to have a temperature difference between both ends of the material to transport charge based on the Seebeck effect, while pyroelectric materials only require time-dependent temperature fluctuations. Pyroelectric materials can be repeatedly heated and cooled to generate usable electrical power with a high energy conversion efficiency. It would be very desirable to utilize natural temperature fluctuations such as the day/night cycle for hydrogen production. Up to now, there has rarely been a report on hydrogen generation by pyroelectric nanomaterials through the harvesting of room-temperature cold–hot alternation energy. Here, the direct generation of hydrogen by the pyroelectric nanomaterial barium strontium titanate is realized under room-temperature cold–hot fluctuations.
