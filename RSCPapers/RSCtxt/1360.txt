    , Accepted 19th December 2022First published on 19th December 2022AbstractThe first examples of Bi(III) and Sb(III) halide compounds combined with a photoswitchable ruthenium nitrosyl unit are reported. The structures of [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) and (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) were determined by X-ray diffraction, and exhibit three different structural types of group 15 halometalates. Low-temperature IR-spectroscopy measurements reveal that the irradiation of 1 at 365 nm switches a stable Ru–NO (GS) unit to a metastable Ru–ON (MS1) linkage. Moreover, the light excitation of 2 at 365 or 405 nm induces the additional formation of a side-bond isomer Ru-η2-(NO) (MS2). The reverse reactions MS1/MS2 → GS can be induced by red–infrared light irradiation or by heating at temperatures >200 K. The obtained synthetic and spectroscopic data open the way for the preparation of hybrid halide complexes with a variety of photoswitchable complexes (NO2, SO2, N2, etc.), and give an insight into the behavior of light-induced species embedded in polynuclear halides.
Introduction
There is an intensive ongoing search for novel hybrid materials for the preparation of photovoltaic devices.1–3 Among the prominent perovskite-like materials are antimony and bismuth halide complexes.4–8 Compared to known Pb-based perovskites, these lead-free halide compounds offer potentially interesting environment-friendly alternatives. However, the devices based thereupon show significantly lower power conversion efficiency than Pb-based ones (∼4% vs. up to 25%6,9), but this area is still developing so it can be expected that higher performances can be achieved.
Despite the outstanding photovoltaic performance of perovskite or perovskite-like compounds, there are obstacles that prevent their wide practical usage, such as moisture-sensitivity and decreased durability with respect to heat or light. One of the possible ways to ensure the sustainability of the photovoltaic device is the introduction of other molecules to the structure of the perovskite. For example, the combination of perovskites with porphyrin metal complexes can increase the moisture and thermal stability of a solar cell,10,11 while combination with an azobenzene photoswitch can increase the stability against UV light.12,13
Other types of molecular photoswitches, such as those based on a metal nitrosyl compound, might have similar potential for the design of perovskite-like materials. It was shown for ruthenium nitrosyl complexes that the linear Ru–NO (GS) configuration can be converted by light to the linear Ru–ON (MS1) and side-on Ru-η2-(NO) (MS2) linkage configurations.14,15 Moreover, by wise choice of the excitation wavelength, the system can be switched between all these linkage isomers.16,17 Another feature of MS1 and MS2 is their absorption properties. Usually both isomers show much higher absorption in the UV and infrared range with respect to GS.18 Thus, the application of nitrosyl photoisomerization is potentially interesting regarding combination with perovskite-like compounds for modulated protection against incident light. However, to date there are no known structures of ruthenium nitrosyl complexes combined with antimony or bismuth halide compounds. At least two fundamental questions arise immediately: (i) is it possible to synthesize the compound containing the structure of both halide pnictogen and ruthenium nitrosyl building blocks; and (ii) given that the desired compound is obtained, do the photoswitching properties of the Ru–NO group persist in the obtained hybrid compound?
In order to answer these questions, we report for the first time the synthesis of Bi and Sb halide complexes containing the trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ cation. The photoswitching properties were investigated using infrared spectroscopy. The complex trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ is especially interesting since its photoswitching properties were described recently for the trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2 salt,19,20 where high populations of MS1 and MS2 were observed (about 40 and 20%, respectively).
Experimental
Synthesis
The ruthenium complexes trans-[RuNOPy4OH](PF6)2 and trans-[RuNOPy4F](ClO4)2 were synthesized according to methods reported earlier.19,21

[RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1). 
66.3 mg (0.1 mmol) of trans-[RuNOPy4OH](PF6)2 and 29.2 mg (0.1 mmol) of Sb2O3 were dissolved in 2 ml of concentrated HBr at 70 °C. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to 5 °C, and in one week orange crystals of 1 were formed. The crystals were washed with H2O on a glass filter and dried with air. The yield was 60%. The powder XRD patterns of the bulk sample correspond to the theoretical patterns calculated from the crystal structure determined by single-crystal XRD (Fig. S1†). Elemental analysis for C80H80N20O4Br36Sb8Ru4 calculated/found, mass%: C 17.0/16.3, H 1.4/1.4, N 5.0/4.7.


(H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2). 
66.3 mg (0.1 mmol) of trans-[RuNOPy4OH](PF6)2 and 134 mg (0.3 mmol) of BiBr3 were dissolved in 2 ml of concentrated HBr at 70 °C. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to 5 °C, and in one week the red-orange crystals of 2 were formed. The crystals were washed with H2O on a glass filter and dried with air. The yield was 60%. The method can be reproduced using the trans-[RuNOPy4F](ClO4)2 precursor instead of trans-[RuNOPy4OH](PF6)2. The powder XRD patterns of the bulk sample correspond to the theoretical patterns calculated from the crystal structure determined by single-crystal XRD (Fig. S2†). Elemental analysis for C80H89N20O8Br31Bi6Ru4 calculated/found mass%: C 17.2/17.9; H 1.6/2.3; N 5.0/4.7.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data of the complexes [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) and (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) were collected on a Bruker Apex Duo diffractometer with CCDs using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) via 0.5° ω- and φ-scan techniques. Reduction of the experimental data was performed using the APEX2 suite. The structures were solved using SHELXT and refined by the full-matrix least-squares technique SHELXL22 assisted by Olex2 GUI.23 The atomic displacement parameters of the ordered non-H atoms were refined using an anisotropic approximation. The hydrogen atoms of the pyridine ligands and water molecules were located geometrically and refined using the riding model with AFIX parameters 1.2 and 1.5, respectively. All water molecules were refined as neutral H2O, and the H3O+ model was excluded due to the absence of evident residual peaks. The crystallographic characteristics, experimental data, and structure refinements are listed in Table S1.† The structures of [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) and (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) have been deposited with the CCDC with deposition numbers 2202258 and 2202257,† respectively.
Hirshfeld surface analysis
The Hirshfeld surfaces were calculated using Crystal Explorer.24,25 This program allows the normalized contact distance dnorm to be mapped onto the generated Hirshfeld surface. It is customary to map dnorm using a red–white–blue scheme, where red denotes close intermolecular contacts (negative dnorm), blue denotes longer contacts (positive dnorm) and white denotes intermolecular contacts equal to the van der Waals radii of atoms in contact (dnorm = 0). It is possible to obtain two-dimensional plots (fingerprint plots) from the surfaces mapped with dnorm values. Derived from the Hirshfeld surface, these 2D-fingerprint plots provide a visual summary of the frequency of each combination of de (radius of external atom) and di (radius of internal atom) across the surface of a molecule; so they not only indicate which intermolecular interactions are present, but also reveal the relative area of the surface corresponding to each kind of interaction. Points on the plot with no contribution on the surface are left uncoloured, and points with a contribution to the surface are coloured blue for a small contribution through green to red for points with the largest contribution.
Spectroscopy
IR-spectroscopy measurements with irradiation were performed using a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 2 cm−1 in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The sample (around 1–2 mg) was mixed with KBr (around 100 mg) and pressed into common pellets for IR measurements. The pellets were bonded onto the cold finger of a closed-cycle cryostat (Oxford Optistat), allowing one to control the temperature in the range of 10–300 K. The irradiation procedures were performed using Thorlabs LEDs (light emitting diodes) through KBr windows perpendicular to the samples with light of different wavelengths (365–1050 nm) with 50–200 mW optical power. To investigate the isothermal kinetics of MS1 and MS2 decays in (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) the following protocol was applied: at the first stage the sample was irradiated at 100 K by a 405 nm LED in order to generate sufficient amounts of MS1 and MS2 isomers; at the second stage the temperature was increased up to the chosen value and then repeated measurements (the delay between the spectra was 60, 80 or 120 s) were performed in isothermal mode. Furthermore, activation energy and frequency factors were determined with Arrhenius coordinates (Fig. 6). UV-vis spectra were recorded on a PG Instruments T60 UV-vis single-beam spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Structures of [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) and (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2)
Both 1 and 2 can be synthesized from trans-[RuNOPy4OH](PF6)2 and the corresponding pnictogen precursor (Sb2O3 or BiBr3, respectively) in concentrated HBr. According to the composition of the final product, the hydroxyl ligand OH− of the initial ruthenium complex is substituted during the reaction by Br−. This behavior is well known for the ruthenium hydroxyl complexes.19,21,26 The precursor trans-[RuNOPy4F](ClO4)2 was tested as well for the preparation of 2. The fluoride ligand F− can also be substituted by Br− in the ruthenium complex, leading to the precipitation of the same product, (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O, as confirmed by PXRD. Both compounds are stable at room temperature under ambient conditions.
The structure of [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) belongs to the monoclinic crystal system, with the space group P21/c with unit cell parameters a = 12.022 Å, b = 22.454 Å, and c = 26.372 Å, and a unit cell volume of 7112.2 Å3. The asymmetric unit contains several different molecular ions. Specifically, the presence of two chemically equivalent but structurally different trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ cations might result in a different photochemical behavior for each photoswitchable molecule.27,28 The asymmetric unit of 1 comprises the octahedra trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+, pyramidal dimers [Sb2Br8]2− and trinuclear anions [Sb3Br12]3−. The asymmetric unit of the structure of 1 is shown in Fig. 1. According to the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) there is only one structure containing the [Sb3Br12]3− unit, (Et(n-Pr)3N)3[Sb3Br12].29 The binuclear pyramidal anion [Sb2Br8]2− is more common, and there are 6 types in the CCDC.30–33 The chosen intramolecular bond lengths are listed in Table 1. The average bond length Sb–Brterminal of the [Sb2Br8]2− anion is slightly longer than that in [Sb3Br12]3− (2.69 vs. 2.59 Å), whereas the average bond length Sb–Brbridge is shorter (2.87 vs. 3.12 Å). A similar trend was found in bismuth clusters.34 In the case of [Sb2Br8]2− the intramolecular contact Sb⋯Sb is 4.36 Å, which is longer than the sum of van der Waals radii (rwSb = 2.06 Å).35 The trinuclear anion [Sb3Br12]3− is distorted, the intramolecular distances Sb⋯Sb are 4.02, 4.18 and 4.68 Å, and thus one short contact Sb⋯Sb (4.02 Å) is within the sum of rw.29 Two crystallographically non-equivalent ruthenium cations trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ are present in the structure of 1. The average bond lengths of the Ru–NO, N–O, Ru–Br and Ru–NPy groups are 1.78, 1.10, 2.47 and 2.11 Å, respectively, which are similar to those reported for trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2.20

The intermolecular contacts are mostly represented by the hydrogen bonds Br⋯H–C with the average distance Br⋯C of 3.63 Å, which are formed by the bromine atoms of [Sb2Br8]2− and [Sb3Br12]3− anions with the hydrogen atoms of pyridine ligands of the ruthenium cation. The nitrosyl ligands NO also form several contacts Br⋯O with an average distance of 3.31 Å.
In order to get a better insight into the intermolecular contact distribution, the two-dimensional fingerprints of the Hirshfeld surfaces of trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ were plotted (see Fig. 2). The biggest contribution to the whole Hirshfeld surface is made by the hydrogen atoms of pyridine ligands, representing 75% of the surface (panels a and b of Fig. 2). Among these contacts the strongest and the most frequent intermolecular interactions are represented by the H⋯Br contacts, which occupy 42% of the surface. The second biggest contribution to the whole Hirshfeld surface is constituted by the weak H⋯H contacts holding 25% of the surface. At the level of structural packing, the ruthenium cations and Sb clusters form chains connected by means of weak Br⋯H–C contacts.

The complex (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system, with the space group (P), and also a quite big unit cell volume (6790.4 Å, see Table S1†), providing an even greater number of structurally different molecules (see the asymmetric unit in Fig. S3†). The fragment of the structure of 2 is shown in Fig. 3. The structure comprises four structurally non-equivalent trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ cations with slightly different intramolecular bond lengths (see Table 2), three non-equivalent [Bi2Br9]3− anions,36–38 three solvate water molecules and one H3O+. In the [Bi2Br9]3− anions the average bond length Bi–Brterminal is 2.76 Å, which is shorter than the Bi–Brbridge distance (3.02 Å), similar to 1. On average, the intramolecular contacts Bi⋯Bi are 4.03 Å, which is shorter than the sum of rw of Bi atoms (2.54 Å)35 and common for these compounds.39 The average bond distances within the trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ cation are also similar to those in 1 and reach 1.77, 1.11, 2.46 and 2.11 Å for Ru–NO, N–O, Ru–Br and Ru–NPy, respectively.

Similar to the previous structure, the bromine atoms of the [Bi2Br9]3− anions form intermolecular contacts Br⋯H–C, and the average length of the Br⋯C distance is 3.65 Å. Additionally, there are contacts Br⋯H–O between [Bi2Br9]3− and the water molecules with an average Br⋯O distance of 3.31 Å. The nitrosyl ligands form several types of contacts O⋯X with the bromine atoms of [Bi2Br9]3− anions, hydrogen atoms of pyridine rings and hydrogen atoms of solvate water molecules with average distances of 3.21, 3.32 and 3.27 Å, respectively.
According to the 2D fingerprints of the Hirshfeld surface of trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ in 2 (see Fig. 4), the biggest contribution to the entire surface is made by the intermolecular contacts of the hydrogen atoms of pyridine ligands (75%). Analogous to 1, the majority of those contacts are represented by the H⋯Br interactions (34%), and they are relatively strong, which can be observed as a bright blue spike in Fig. 4. The rest of the contacts are mainly represented by the H⋯H interactions (33%). Similar to the crystal packing of 1, the [Bi2Br9]3− anions and ruthenium cations form chains organized by the Br⋯H–C and Br⋯H–O interactions.
 Fig. 4  The two-dimensional fingerprints of the Hirshfeld surface of trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ in 2 for the All⋯All, (a), H⋯All (b) and H⋯Br (c) contacts. 
Comparing the structures of 1 and 2, the change of the pnictogen leads to a drastic change in the structural type of the pnictogen cluster. In 1 the structure comprises two types of clusters with different nuclearities ([Sb2Br8]2− and [Sb3Br12]3−), whilst in 2 only one but different type of anion is formed ([Bi2Br9]3−). The average bond lengths in the trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ cation remain similar for both compounds. Based on the Hirshfeld surface analysis, in both 1 and 2 the intermolecular interactions are mainly represented by the Br⋯H–C contacts, reaching about 40% of the whole Hirshfeld surfaces. By means of these contacts (and also Br⋯H–O in 2) the structures are packed as chains of ruthenium cations and pnictogen clusters.
Photogeneration of linkage isomers
The photoinduced linkage isomers in 1 and 2 were investigated using IR spectroscopy in the temperature range 100–300 K. In the spectrum of 1 at 100 K the band of ν(NO) vibration shows a maximum at 1890 cm−1. Further intense bands are assigned to the pyridine vibrations at 1610, 1451, 1298, 1067, 1017, 752 and 689 cm−1 (see Fig. S4†). The irradiation of the sample at 100 K using light of 365 nm wavelength induces the appearance of the band at 1738 cm−1 and the corresponding decrease of the ν(NO) band of GS (see Fig. 5a). The maximum at 1738 cm−1 is assigned to the ν(NO) band of the MS1 linkage isomer (Ru–ON), based on the corresponding observations in the earlier reported related compounds.19,20 Different photoexcitation wavelengths (405, 420, 455, 470, 505, 530, and 590 nm) were tested for the photogeneration of MS1; however, the highest population of MS1 was observed in the case of 365 nm. The population of MS1 was calculated from the decrease in the ν(NO) band of GS using the equation P = 100 − (I(ν(NO))GSafter/I(ν(NO))GSbefore) × 100, which reaches 2% in the case of 1. The irradiation of MS1 with 660 or 1050 nm light induced the transfer of MS1 back to GS.
 Fig. 5  IR-spectra of 1 (panel a) and 2 (panel b) before (GS) and after irradiation at 365 or 405 nm (MS1) measured at 100 K. 
The thermal stability of MS1 was estimated by the gradual heating of the sample; as a result, an efficient thermal decay of MS1 to GS occurred at T > 200 K. Since the MS1 band was broadened significantly at higher temperatures, it was not possible to precisely determine the kinetic parameters of the MS1 → GS decay process.
The IR spectrum of 2 is similar to that of 1 (see Fig. S5†). The ν(NO) band in GS at 100 K is observed at 1885 cm−1 with a shoulder at 1899 cm−1, and the most intense pyridine bands are observed at 1610, 1451, 1298, 1067, 1017, 752 and 689 cm−1. Interestingly, the irradiation of the sample by 365 or 405 nm light induces the formation of two isomers – MS1 and MS2 (Ru-η2-(NO)) with ν(NO) bands at 1725 and 1589 cm−1, respectively (see Fig. 5b) – whereas irradiation at 405 nm generates a slightly bigger amount of MS2, and that at 365 nm generates more MS1. The total population is 3%. Additionally, a band with a maximum at 572 cm−1 appears, and is tentatively assigned to the ν(Ru–NO)/δ(Ru–N–O) vibration of MS2. The corresponding low-intensity band of GS is observed at 592 cm−1. It is important to mention that irradiation at 455 nm decreases the population of both metastable states, and excitation at 650 (660) or 980 (1050) nm completely transfers both MS1 and MS2 back to GS.
The thermal stability of MS1 and MS2 was measured by IR spectroscopy in isothermal mode. Once the rate constants of the MS1/MS2 → GS reactions were measured at certain temperatures, the activation energy (Ea) and frequency factor (lgk0) were determined from the Arrhenius plot (see Fig. 6). The parameter Td (decay temperature) was calculated using the Arrhenius equation from the obtained Ea and lgk0 values at k = 10−3 s−1.40 This parameter is very useful for comparison of the thermal stability between different compounds. The kinetic parameters are gathered in Table 3. Thus, MS1 efficiently decays to GS at temperatures higher than 200 K, similar to 1. Roughly, the lifetime of MS1 at Td, which equals 199 K, is around 17 min. The thermal stability of MS2 is lower than that of MS1, with a Td value of 139 K (see Table 3). Commonly, MS2 has lower thermal stability than MS1, as described for the related compounds.19 Comparing the thermal stability of 2 with that of the related complex trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2, for which the Td values of MS1 and MS2 are 201 and 131 K, respectively, little thermal stabilization of MS2 in 2 is observed. Indeed, the change in the counterion can lead to a change in the thermal stability of the linkage isomer.41,42

Another interesting feature of the linkage isomers in 1 and 2 is that the highest population of metastable states is observed after 365 nm irradiation in both compounds. For example, in the related complex trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2 the population of MS1 reaches about 40% after 505 nm irradiation and gets lower in the case of 365 nm excitation.19,20 Thus, there are significant differences in the population and wavelength for the efficient generation of MS1/MS2 (λtop). Earlier it was reported that shorter intermolecular contacts between the NO ligand and the atoms of the second coordination sphere lead to a higher population of MS1.20 Indeed, in trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2 the shortest contacts between NO and the PF6− anions are 2.680 and 2.696 Å, which are shorter than the intermolecular contacts NO⋯X in 1 and 2 (about 3.3 Å). Apparently, the large difference in λtop (505 vs. 365 nm) is related to the difference in the absorption spectra of all linkage isomers GS, MS1 and MS2.16,41 Assuming that the mechanism of NO isomerization is the two-step process GS → MS2 → MS1, the absorption of each isomer section at the excitation wavelength plays a crucial role.43–45 Earlier it was shown that the counterion can significantly change the absorption spectrum of any isomer.41 In the cases of 1 and 2 we assume that the spectra of MS1 and MS2 are significantly different from those reported for trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2.19 Unfortunately, the low population of metastable states prevents the detection of MS1/MS2 signatures using UV-vis spectroscopy (GS spectra of 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. S6†). Generally, to reach a high population of MS1, a high absorption of both GS and MS2 and a low absorption of MS1 at a certain excitation wavelength are necessary.16 For example, in the related complex trans-[RuNOPy4Cl](PF6)2 the maximum population of MS1 (76%) was found after excitation at 476.5 nm, where the absorption coefficient of MS1 was minimal.46 A similar situation was found in trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6), where the absorption minimum of MS1 was observed at 490 nm, giving the best population (40%) after 505 nm exposure.19 Such photochemical behavior is explained by the two-step mechanism of the MS1 formation (GS → MS2 → MS1).43–45 According to this mechanism, the first photon absorbed by GS drives the system to the MS2 configuration, whereas the following absorption of the photon by MS2 may drive the system forward to MS1, or back to GS, depending on the available relaxation paths after this second photoexcitation.16 Furthermore, a high absorption coefficient of MS1 at the excitation wavelength results in a higher probability of backward reactions MS1 → GS/MS2. Thus, the achievable population of a given isomer is governed by the photochemical equilibrium during GS ↔ MS2 ↔ MS1 transformations, where lower MS1 deexcitation probability results in its higher population. Based on this, we assume that the relative minimum of the MS1 absorption band lies at 365 nm. Another possible reason for the low population of metastable states might be hidden in the properties of halometalate anions. According to the literature data, bismuth and antimony compounds might exhibit light emission in the green–red spectral range after UV exposure.47–51 Since the light irradiation by red light (650–660 nm) of MS1,2 leads to the depopulation of both states back to GS, a possible emission by the halometalate in the red spectral range might decrease the population of both states. Although the embedding of a photoswitchable compound in a matrix results in a higher photoconversion fraction,52,53 the light absorption by the bismuth or antimony complex might also decrease the probability of excitation of the nitrosyl compound.41,54
Conclusions
Using a simple synthetic approach, compounds [RuNOPy4Br]4[Sb2Br8][Sb3Br12]2 (1) and (H3O)[RuNOPy4Br]4[Bi2Br9]3·3H2O (2) were obtained by mixing the ruthenium nitrosyl species and the corresponding Sb2O3 or BiBr3 precursor in HBr. The XRD analysis of the structures of 1 and 2 shows that the type of pnictogen affects the structural type by forming binuclear bismuth and bi- and tri-nuclear antimony halide anions. The Hirshfeld surface analysis for both 1 and 2 reveals that the intermolecular interactions are mainly represented by Br⋯H–C contacts, reaching about 40% of the whole Hirshfeld surfaces. The light irradiation of 1 and 2 at 365 or 405 nm leads to the isomerization of the Ru–NO (GS) group of the ruthenium cation trans-[RuNOPy4Br]2+ to the metastable isomer Ru–ON (MS1). In 2, the side-bond isomer Ru-η2-(NO) (MS2) can be photoinduced as well. Based on the IR-spectroscopy data the total population of linkage isomers in both compounds does not exceed 3%. Importantly, the backward reaction MS1/MS2 → GS can be induced by red–infrared light. The thermal stability of both metastable states was investigated by IR spectroscopy in isothermal mode. It was found that MS1 decays efficiently at T > 200 K and MS2 is less stable, decaying at T > 140 K. For compound 2 the activation energies (Ea) and frequency factors (lgk0) of the MS1 → GS and MS2 → GS reactions were determined to be 38.00 ± 1.24 kJ mol−1 and 7.00 ± 0.31 and 17.15 ± 1.77 kJ mol−1 and 3.45 ± 0.62, respectively. The obtained results were compared with the corresponding photochemical properties of the related trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2 complex. It was shown that the ruthenium complex combined with the pnictogen cluster exhibits quite different behavior, namely the population of the metastable states drops down significantly (from 40 to 3%), and the wavelength for efficient metastable state generation shifts to the UV range (from 505 to 365 nm). We assume that both differences are related to the difference in the absorption spectra of all linkage isomers GS, MS1 and MS2 in 1 and 2. In 2 the advantage of the [Bi2Br9]3− cluster introduction is the increase in the MS2 isomer decay temperature (Td) with respect to that in trans-[RuNOPy4Br](PF6)2 by about 10 K (139 vs. 131 K). Thus, the properties of the light-induced linkage isomers can be drastically changed by the introduction of the pnictogen cluster. Based on the obtained results we can expect that other photoswitchable compounds (containing NO2 or SO2-like ligands)55,56 can be embedded in pnictogen halide structures, which will provide further opportunities for the design of Bi and Sb clusters coupled to photosensitive complexes.
