    , Accepted 8th October 2018First published on 9th October 2018AbstractPost-fabrication defect passivation of organometal halide perovskites has become an efficient way to improve their photophysical properties, but the underlying mechanisms are still in debate. In this work, we used p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) to generate surface defects on methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (MAPbI3), and found that a Usanovich acid–base (O2, acetone or acetonitrile) treatment can effectively passivate those defects and lead to photoluminescence (PL) enhancement. The passivation effect arose from partial neutralization of defect charges via electron transfer between passivation reagents and relevant defects. O2 accepted photo-generated electrons, formed negatively charged oxygen species and attached to the I vacancy site to reduce its PL quenching efficiency by neutralising the defects positive charge. Likewise, acetone accepted photo-generated holes, formed positively charged species and partially neutralised the defects negative charge. The reduced trapping ability of defects caused PL enhancement. In addition, the observed photo-catalysed oxidation of acetone by O2 on the crystal surface supported the single electron transfer mechanism, and showed the potential of MAPbI3 as a photo-catalyst.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (OMHPs) have become one of the most potent materials for harvesting solar energy1 and for light emitting devices2,3 due to their superb photo-physical properties, such as long carrier lifetime,4 long carrier diffusion length,5 high absorption coefficients6 and low-cost fabrication methods.7 The research progress in perovskite fabrication and device architecture8–13 has led to the increase of their power conversion efficiency up to 22.1%.14 However, problems such as instability of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite15–18 and hysteresis in perovskite solar cells19,20 are still far from being thoroughly understood and have limited its development in photovoltaic applications. One important factor which significantly affects its performance is crystal defects (also called traps for their ability to trap free charge carriers). Different preparation routes and conditions will yield MAPbI3 crystals with defects of different chemical composition and eventually result in the material's complicated photophysical properties.21–28 Therefore, defect's chemical origin, their influence on perovskite photophysics and effective passivation methods are central topics towards understanding perovskite materials and improving their photovoltaic performance.
Crystal defects have already attracted broad interest, and many groups have used one- and two-photon excitation to unravel defect distribution and recombination dynamics of the surface and the bulk of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.29–33 Wu et al. studied surface and bulk recombination kinetics and estimated surface trap density to be two orders larger than that of the bulk.30 Fang et al. reported passivation of surface traps by O2 and H2O physically adsorbed on the MAPbI3 crystal surface.34 In addition, Galisteo-Lopez et al. attributed the photo-brightening effect of O2 on MAPbI3's photoluminescence (PL) to formation of lead oxide with non-fully coordinated Pb2+ at surface and grain boundaries.35 Furthermore, Tian et al. suggested that upon excitation, oxygen-related species would dissolve into the crystal, migrate from the surface into the interior region and finally cure surface and bulk defects.24 Besides oxygen, Lewis bases are also a class of passivating reagents for OMHP.36–38 Noel et al. used pyridine and thiophene to passivate surface traps which they proposed as under-coordinated Pb atoms, and obtained increased PL lifetime (2 μs) and better solar cell performance.37 DeQuilettes et al. observed a similar increased lifetime for MAPbI3 upon phosphine oxide treatment, and suggested that the phosphine oxide was localized on the crystal surface and acted as a Lewis base donating electron pairs to passivate surface traps.38 Despite the great number of passivation methods developed, the chemical composition of relevant defects and passivation mechanisms have not been completely understood.
In this work, we used p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) as a surface defect inducer to prepare MAPbI3 crystals with abundant crystal defects. We observed significant photo-induced PL enhancement for p-BQ treated MAPbI3 crystals under O2, acetone and acetonitrile atmospheres. These results largely extended the range of reagents that could cause PL enhancement of perovskite materials. A novel mechanism was proposed based on these results. In addition, we found that simultaneously introducing O2 and acetone/acetonitrile into p-BQ treated MAPbI3 would cause its degradation rather than the expected PL enhancement. We discussed the PL enhancement and degradation mechanism and showed the potential of p-BQ treated MAPbI3 in photo-catalysis.
Results and discussion
Formation of surface defects
The variation of defect types and the low concentration in crystals have hindered detailed investigation, despite their crucial influence on the OMHP material's properties. Thus, a higher concentration of a specific type of defect would help better understand its influence on the material's photophysics. We discovered that p-BQ could react with the MAPbI3 crystal surface and induce abundant surface defects. After p-BQ treatment, the resulted crystals exhibited low PL quantum yield and shortened PL lifetime (Fig. 1, see Fig. S1 in ESI† for original data).
 Fig. 1  (a) PL images of the MAPbI3 film before (left) and after (right) p-BQ treatment. (b) The average PL lifetime measured from 6 different locations on the same film before and after p-BQ treatment. 
As shown in Fig. 1a, PL of p-BQ treated MAPbI3 crystals was significantly lower than that of pristine ones, and the PL quantum yield decreased by at least one order of magnitude. We thus deduced that abundant defects had been successfully created by p-BQ treatment and had acted as non-radiative recombination sites to strongly quench the sample's PL. Lifetime measurements also supported defect formation and its PL quenching role: the PL lifetime of p-BQ treated MAPbI3 in N2 (∼4 ns) was on average one order of magnitude shorter than that of pristine crystals (∼40 ns) (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the PL spectrum of p-BQ treated MAPbI3 did not show any change compared to pristine crystals (in Fig. S2, ESI†). The unchanged spectra suggested that p-BQ did not completely destroy MAPbI3's crystal structure and only reacted with the crystal surface to form surface defects.
Although we could not directly measure the change of surface elemental composition of p-BQ treated MAPbI3, we suggested that the chemical composition of surface defects induced by p-BQ treatment was probably MA–I double vacancy based on the following discussion. Qin et al. reported that p-BQ could oxidize methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) into volatile methylamine and iodine.39 It is possible that p-BQ could react with the MAPbI3 crystal surface in a similar way and create MA–I double vacancies on the crystal surface. Moreover, according to Liu's calculations of MAPbBr3,40 MA–Br double vacancy has the lowest formation energy of 1.96 eV among different charged and neutral surface defects. In Walsh's work, MA–I Schottky disorder (nil → VMA + VI + MAI) was found to have the lowest reaction enthalpy of 0.08 eV per defect among MAPbI3, MAI and PbI2 Schottky disorders.41 Based on the above reports, we proposed that the MA–I double vacancy defect might have formed on the surface of MAPbI3 after p-BQ treatment. We are still working on direct identification of its chemical nature.
PL enhancement by O2 and acetone via trap passivation
The well-reported PL enhancement effect of MAPbI3 has been observed in the presence of O2 and molecules previously thought of as Lewis bases.24,38 For example, Tian et al. showed oxygen's role in PL enhancement, which could be via photo-induced chemical passivation.24 DeQuilettes et al. correlated the enhanced PL and longer PL lifetime of MAPbI3 after phosphine oxide treatment with the decreased electron density on phosphine oxide's Lewis base moiety.38 In this work, we also observed a similar PL enhancement effect of O2 and organic molecules in line with previous reports. O2 (Fig. 2a), acetone (Fig. 2b) and acetonitrile (Fig. S3, ESI†) vapour exhibited a similar PL enhancement effect on p-BQ treated MAPbI3. The PL enhancement in O2 and acetone atmospheres was attributed to their passivation of surface defects created by p-BQ treatment because the sample's PL lifetime in both O2 and acetone was longer than that in N2 (Fig. 3). The unshifted PL spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the quick and reversible response of PL intensity to a gaseous atmosphere allowed us to conclude that O2 and acetone interacted only with surface defects and did not migrate into the crystal. More importantly, the passivation was not a simple result of physisorption but was a photo-induced process: PL enhancement only happened in the light-illuminated area. When we moved the sample to a new position after PL saturation of the illuminated area, only the illuminated area showed PL enhancement, although O2 and acetone could also adsorb on the unilluminated area (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Usanovich acid–base passivation mechanism
Different models have been proposed to explain the PL enhancement effect of O2, such as defect curing by dissolved oxygen species inside the crystals or formation of lead oxide with non-fully coordinated Pb at the surface.24,35 Meanwhile, enhanced PL after Lewis base treatment was attributed to passivation of surface under-coordinated Pb or charge neutralization of surface defects by the reagent's Lewis base moiety (lone pair).37,38 In this work, we would show that the passivation reagents might not always function as Lewis bases. The range of passivation reagents could be broader and the passivation mechanism could be different.
As discussed above, the fast and reversible PL intensity response to a gaseous atmosphere suggested that the passivation effect originated from a photo-induced process where molecules from the gaseous atmosphere interacted with surface defects. The charged defects would attract oppositely charged photo-carriers and would thus act as PL quenchers via non-radiative recombination. However, the interaction between passivation reagents and defects must have affected the charge carrier density or recombination dynamics under irradiation so as to increase the PL quantum yield, probably by reducing the defects trapping ability.
We attributed the PL enhancement effect of O2 to the decreased electron-trapping ability of the I vacant position of MA–I double vacancy in an O2 atmosphere (Fig. 4). The positively charged I vacancy could function as a non-radiative recombination site by trapping photo-generated electrons. Its electron trapping ability would lead to an increased photo-electron concentration at this position under light irradiation. This could lead to facile transfer of trapped photo-generated electrons at I vacancy to adsorbed O2 and formation of partially negatively charged oxygen species. The partially negatively charged oxygen species attached at I vacancy could function as an I− substitute to partially neutralize defect's positive charge. In this way, the I vacancy was passivated due to its reduced electron-trapping ability and PL enhancement resulted.
 Fig. 4  Mechanisms of the trapping defect passivation by Usanovich acid–base. 
O2 was known to accept photo-generated electrons to form superoxide species on semiconductor surfaces42–46 and Aristidou et al. detected superoxide species on the MAPbI3 surface in an oxygen atmosphere under light irradiation.47 Furthermore, the energy barrier of superoxide formation from O2 is 0.45 eV,48 which is far below the band gap of MAPbI3. Theoretical calculation of the MAPbI3 crystal surface also supported the I vacancy defect to be the energetically favourable site for superoxide formation.49 All these published results could support that the negatively charged oxygen species could be generated under our experimental conditions and cause PL enhancement via the proposed mechanism.
PL enhancement induced by acetone or acetonitrile could proceed through similar mechanisms. Negatively charged MA vacancy would trap photo-generated holes and would cause an increased concentration of holes at this position. Acetone/acetonitrile adsorbed at MA vacancy could become partially positively charged due to partial charge transfer from the photo-generated holes trapped here. The positively charged acetone/acetonitrile species attached to the MA vacancy could act as an MA+ substitute to partially neutralize the defects negative charge (Fig. 4). Therefore, the MA vacancy was passivated and PL enhancement was observed due to reduced hole-trapping of MA vacancy.
Note that in this work, acetone and acetonitrile did not function as Lewis bases which donated a pair of electrons to a positively charged surface defect as stated by previous researchers.37,38 They partially donated electrons to passivate a negatively charged surface defect by serving as MA+ substitute on the crystal surface. The mechanism was fundamentally different from the Lewis base passivation mechanism.
Usanovich acid–base theory defines compounds that accept electron(s) as acids and those that donate electron(s) as bases, which can be used to appropriately describe all the passivation reagents (O2, acetone and acetonitrile) in this work. Therefore, we used the terminology Usanovich acid–base to describe the electron transfer processes above: O2 functioned as a Usanovich acid to receive electron(s) from p-BQ treated MAPbI3, and acetone/acetonitrile functioned as Usanovich bases to accept hole(s) from (or equivalently, donate electron(s) to) MAPbI3. The general condition for a molecule to be a Usanovich acid or base to passivate the MA–I double vacancy was not clear but molecular polarity might be one condition, because acetone and acetonitrile could cause PL enhancement while petroleum ether could not (Fig. S5, ESI†).
Photocatalytic properties of MAPbI3
The electron transfer process described above could also be explained in the framework of redox reactions: species accepting electrons are reduced and species donating electrons are oxidised. More precisely, O2 accepted electrons and was reduced; acetone donated electrons and was oxidised. Our proposed electron transfer mechanism was further supported by the redox reaction between acetone and O2 we observed on the surface of p-BQ treated MAPbI3.
When both O2 and acetone/acetonitrile were introduced to passivate p-BQ treated MAPbI3, significant PL decay down to zero following an initial PL enhancement was observed (Fig. 5a). We attributed the PL decay to complete degradation of p-BQ treated MAPbI3 under that condition because the crystal's colour turned from dark brown to yellow (Fig. S6, ESI†), which was consistent with previous reports on the yellowish colour of degraded MAPbI3.50–52 This degradation was also light-induced: if the sample was moved to an unilluminated area after total degradation of the illuminated area, the unilluminated area would show neither PL enhancement nor degradation (Fig. 5b).
 Fig. 5  (a) PL intensity traces in N2, O2 and acetone–O2 mixed (denoted as AC–O2) atmospheres; (b) PL image of the illuminated and unilluminated area in the same excitation spot showed that only the illuminated area degraded. 
The surprising degradation observed when two passivation reagents were simultaneously introduced could also be satisfactorily explained by the electron transfer model we proposed. The degradation was caused by the water-related product from a trap assisted photo-catalysed redox reaction between the two reagents. The MA–I double vacancy catalysed the reaction by separating electrons and holes to different defect sites: O2 received electrons (and was thus reduced) at the I vacancy position and acetone received holes (and was thus oxidised) at the MA vacancy position. Water-related species produced from the oxidation of acetone caused material's degradation. Acetonitrile with O2 could also lead to degradation while petroleum with O2 could not, which was in line with our argument that the degradation mechanism involved electron transfer similar to the case of PL enhancement (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we studied the mechanism of the reversible photo-induced PL enhancement effect of O2 and acetone/acetonitrile on MAPbI3 crystals with MA–I double vacancy induced by p-BQ treatment. O2 attached at the I vacancy accepted photo-generated electrons to form negatively charged oxygen species and acted as a substitute of I−, while acetone (or acetonitrile) attached at the MA vacancy accepted photo-generated holes to form partially positively charged species and acted as a substitute of MA+. The two defect sites were passivated via partial neutralisation of defect charges and their decreased trapping ability caused PL enhancement. The above mechanism was further supported by a photo-catalysed redox reaction between adsorbed acetone and O2. When both O2 and acetone were introduced, concurrent charge transfer involving O2 accepting electrons and acetone or acetonitrile donating electrons resulted in a redox reaction between them. In this work, a new mechanism of defect passivation was proposed which would allow us to better understand these materials and would provide guidelines for their improved fabrication.
Experimental
MAPbI3 solution was prepared by stirring an equimolar mixture of methylammonium iodide (MAI, synthesized in the laboratory) and lead iodide (PbI2, Sigma-Aldrich) in γ-butyrolactone (Aladdin) at 80 °C for 12 hours. MAPbI3 crystals were fabricated by spin-coating 25 μL of MAPbI3 solution on a glass substrate (20 mm × 20 mm) under 4000 rpm and then annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes. All preparation procedures were carried out in air. The prepared MAPbI3 crystals were translucent when observed under a microscope under room light, so the upper surface of the crystals could be reached by a 532 nm laser.
150 μL of ethyl acetate solution of p-BQ was spin-coated onto the MAPbI3 film under 4000 rpm. The treated sample was annealed for 1 minute at 80 °C to accelerate the reaction between p-BQ and MAPbI3 crystal surface and to evaporate possible remaining p-BQ and solvent molecules.
The p-BQ treated MAPbI3 sample was excited by a 532 nm diode laser, with its PL collected by a dry objective lens (Olympus LUCPlanFI 40×, NA = 0.6) and detected by an EM-CCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor) after passing through a 550 nm long-pass filter (ET550lp, Chroma). The environmental atmosphere was switched between nitrogen and oxygen (all dry) in a home-made chamber. The acetone, acetonitrile and petroleum ether atmosphere was created by bubbling dry nitrogen through a bottle of relevant liquid solvent. The acetone, acetonitrile and petroleum ether–O2 hybrid atmosphere was created similarly by bubbling dry O2 through a bottle of relevant liquid solvent.
For lifetime measurements, we used a pulsed supercontinuum white laser (Fianium, WL-SC400) with dual AOTFs to obtain monochromatic light of selected wavelength. A fast avalanche photo-diode (APD, Micro Photon Devices) coupled with the PicoHarp 300 (PicoQuant) counting module was used for time-correlated single photon counting.
