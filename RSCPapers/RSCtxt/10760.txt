    , Accepted 21st March 2022First published on 23rd March 2022AbstractSide-chain engineering has been acknowledged as an ingenious method to regulate material crystallinity, miscibility and microstructure to achieve favorable photovoltaic performance. Subtle changes of the side chains would have a significant impact on the intermolecular interactions and molecular stacking. In this work, two conjugated polymers were synthesized based on BDT (D) and TT (A) units with different side chain substituents, thiophene sulfur, benzene sulfur and methyl, on the π-bridge. The PPSBTz-Me (with benzene sulfur side chains) exhibits a deeper HOMO energy level, and PTSBTz-Me (with thiophene sulfur side chains) exhibits strong intermolecular interactions, ordered stacking, and appropriate miscibility with fullerene materials, thus achieving an excellent photovoltaic performance in fullerene organic solar cells, with a high PCE of 10.36%, a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 17.34 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.39%. Therefore, the subtle structure change has an important impact on the performance of organic photovoltaics, and the underlying mechanism needs to be carefully studied in depth.
Introduction
Currently, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been recognized as a promising technology in the future energy marketplace because of their semitransparency, light weight, flexibility, and low-cost devices through solution processing.1–3 The past few years have witnessed great achievements of OPVs in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the progress in molecular strategies and device engineering.4–12 Nowadays, the device PCEs have surpassed 10% based on polymer/fullerene and 18% based on the non-fullerene small molecule binary structure.13,14 Recently, a PCE of 19% was achieved for single-junction OPV cells with a ternary strategy.15 Such high efficiency satisfied the requirements of commercial applications.16,17
Among reported high performance polymers, donor–acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers hold an extremely important position.18–20 In the developed electron-donating (D) units, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit was recognized as the most promising one since it used in polymers for OPVs.21 Furthermore, in the electron-accepting units, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) was also widely used due to its extensive absorption with a high extinction coefficient.22–25 For example, PTB7-Th (also named PCE10), the most classical polymer of D–A systems based on BDT and TT units, was widely used in both fullerene and non-fullerene OPVs.26–29 In addition, a π bridge has an indispensable effect on the energy level, intermolecular interactions, and photovoltaic performance for D–A polymers. As in our previous studies, with the introduction of the thiazole unit as a π bridge with a deep HOMO energy level, much more desirable polymers were obtained,30–32 and a PTBTz-2/PC71BM based device exhibited a high photovoltaic performance of 9.72%. Normally, the PCE is determined by three vital factors: open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), and the fill factor (FF).16,33 These factors are influenced by the absorption spectrum, energy level and morphology of the BHJ layer, respectively. Furthermore, in order to achieve high performance solar cells, the donors need to satisfy the following conditions of appropriate crystallinity and moderate interactions with the acceptors. These properties are closely related to the molecular configuration, conformation and planarity, which can be regulated by tuning the molecular structures.34 Side chain engineering is an effective tuning method to adjust the absorption spectra, HOMO energy level and the morphology of the BHJ layer, thus improving the photovoltaic performance.35–37 For example, some side chain groups could optimize the degree of mixing between polymers and fullerene,38 afford two-channel π–π charge transport (TCCT),39 improve the performance and capacity of conjugated-polymer-based electrodes,37 and increase the π-stacking overlap of the polymer backbones.40 Meanwhile, long flexible side chains are indispensable to increase solubility for conjugated polymers for low-cost solution processing.41 However, the effects of the introduction of small side chains and/or the variation of two-dimensional conjugate side chains on photovoltaic performance still need to be continuously studied.
Hence, we designed and synthesized two polymers named PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me in this work. In order to further broaden the absorption spectra through the hyperconjugation effect of methyl, we introduced methyl in the fourth position of thiazole. Then we substituted thiophene alkyl side chains for thiophene sulfur and benzene sulfur side chains, respectively, to investigate in depth the impact of the side chain substitution on the photovoltaic performance. PPSBTz-Me (with benzene sulfur side chains) exhibited a deeper HOMO energy level. Moreover, PTSBTz-Me exhibited a higher surface energy (closer to PC71BM) due to the introduction of thiophene sulfur side chains. Therefore, PTSBTz-Me exhibited good miscibility and strong interaction with fullerene materials, which is in favor of forming appropriate phase separation with the interpenetrating network. In addition, thiophene sulfur substitution endowed the polymer with a more flat molecular conformation and enhanced the molecular interactions. Also PTSBTz-Me demonstrated higher crystallinity and more ordered stacking, which are beneficial for charge transport. These properties further determined the excellent photovoltaic performance of the polymers. Based on PTSBTz-Me:PC71BM, the device achieved a high PCE of 10.36%, with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 17.34 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.39%. The results indicate that a subtle difference of the side chain would have a significant impact on the photovoltaic performance. This provides a reference for the investigation of aryl-type side chain introduction.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the synthetic details are collected in the ESI.† The structures of the target polymers are shown in Fig. 1(a). We employed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to investigate the stability of the two polymers. The results show that PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTZ-Me demonstrate good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 316.2 °C and 322.5 °C, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). The excellent thermal stability could ensure that the polymers remain active during the process of device fabrication.

The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the polymers PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTZ-Me as thin films and in dilute chloroform solution are collected in Fig. 1(b), and the corresponding optical parameters are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that both of the polymers show similar absorption spectra in the range from 300 to 750 nm. Compared with PPSBTz-Me, the absorption edge of PTSBTz-Me in solution redshifts by 9 nm. This is attributed to the higher electronegativity of thiophene than that of benzene, thus increasing the density of the electron cloud and making it easier to undergo electron leaps. In thin film state, PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTZ-Me display absorption edges at 750 and 734 nm, corresponding to the optical band gap (Eg) values of 1.65 and 1.69 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with PPSBTZ-Me, PTSBTz-Me exhibits a sharp and strong absorption shoulder at around 690 nm, which is characteristic of orderly stacking. The distinct difference in shoulder absorption suggests that the PTSBTz-Me film shows a relatively ordered structure compared to PPSBTZ-Me, which implies a stronger inter-chain aggregation. To further investigate the diverse aggregation behaviors of the two polymers, the temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra in solution were collected in the range from 30 to 110 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†). During the heating process, the polymers show a clear spectral blue shift and an obvious decline in absorption intensity, which is the process of polymer deaggregation. The 0–0 peak of PPSBTz-Me disappears at 50 °C, while PTSBTz-Me existed until 90 °C. The diverse heat-resistant temperature range could also explain the different behavior of aggregation.42 It is further confirmed that PTSBTz-Me exhibits stronger intermolecular stacking even in solution. The enhanced intermolecular interaction is induced by thiophene sulfur side chains. As is well known, polymers with relatively strong aggregation are beneficial to charge transport.

In addition, we employed electrochemical cyclic voltammetry to measure the electronic energy levels of the two polymers with ferrocene (−4.8 eV) as a standard reference. The electrochemical curves and energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 1(c), and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. It can be observed that the onset oxidation potentials of PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTZ-Me are 1.20 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively. According to the empirical equation: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − E(Fc/Fc+)1/2) V, the HOMO energy levels of PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me are estimated to be −5.57 eV and −5.68 eV, respectively. In some cases, a well-defined reduction process could not be detected, so the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level could not be derived directly. In this case, the LUMO energy level could be calculated using the equation: ELOMO = EHOMO + Eoptg, and the values were −3.91 eV and −3.99 eV, respectively. From Fig. 1(d), we can see that the HOMO energy level of PPSBTz-Me is 0.11 eV deeper than that of PTSBTz-Me, which is due to the relatively weak electronegativity of benzene compared with thiophene, and will make it harder to lose electrons during oxidation. The VOC is determined by the deviation of the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the fullerene acceptor. Hence, a relatively deep HOMO energy level means a higher VOC, which is a premise for obtaining a high performance device.43
Two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was carried out to clarify the molecular packing characteristics of the two polymers (Fig. 2). Compared with the PPSBTz-Me neat film, the PTSBTz-Me film exhibits an enhanced out-of-plane π–π stacking peak (010) at 18.12 nm−1 and an enhanced in-plane π–π stacking peak (100) at 2.68 nm−1. Furthermore, the results suggest that PTSBTz-Me has a favorable face-on orientation, which is a desirable orientation for OSCs to build vertical channels for charge transport. By contrast, the PPSBTz-Me film shows a mixture of relatively weak face-on and edge-on orientations. In addition, PPSBTz-Me presents a π–π stacking peak (100) in-plane at 2.59 nm−1. According to the Bragg equation, we can calculate the spacing of the stacked layer using the equation: d = 2π/q and obtain d100 = 2.42 nm (PPSBTz-Me) and d100 = 2.34 nm (PTSBTz-Me). Furthermore, compared with PPSBTz-Me, PTSBTz-Me exhibits a smaller full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the out-of-plane direction. According to Scherrer's equation: Lc = 2π/FWHM, the (010) crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) of PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me are 0.9835 nm and 0.6424 nm, respectively. The larger CCL and shorter stacked layer distance in the face-on orientation led to higher crystallinity and more ordered stacking of PTSBTz-Me. Hence, the prominent absorption shoulder and the GIWAXS diffraction peak demonstrate that the substitution of thiophene sulfur side chains is in favor of intermolecular interactions and high crystallinity of the polymer.

In order to further explore the regulation effects of different two-dimensional side chains on the delocalization and molecular configuration, we employed the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method to implement density functional theory (DFT) calculations on PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, ESI†). It can be seen that the twisting angles of the main backbone part are all below 6°, implying that the polymers possess an almost planar backbone conformation. In addition, on a closer comparison, the angles between the side chains and skeleton of PTSBTz-Me are slightly smaller than those of PPSBTZ-Me, which suggest that thiophene sulfur substitution enables a more flat molecular conformation and enhances the molecular interactions. The lighter twist of the side chains would not damage polymer aggregation. Besides, the estimated HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PPSBTZ-Me are lower than those of PTSBTz-Me, and the calculated bandgap (2.03 eV) is also lower than that of PTSBTz-Me (2.07 eV). All the results are consistent with the experimental data discussed above.

To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the polymers, devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/PDINO/Al were prepared, where PEDOT:PSS and PDINO were applied as the buffer layers for hole and electron extraction, respectively. The devices were fabricated under different conditions (D/A ratio, additive, annealing, and concentration) and measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination, and the detailed process and device parameters are given in ESI† Tables S1 and S2. The optimal current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and photovoltaic parameters of the polymers are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively. The device based on PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM exhibits a VOC of 0.89 V, JSC of 17.34 mA cm−2, and FF of 67.39%, achieving a PCE of 10.36%. Simultaneously, the device based on PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM achieves a PCE of 8.95%, with a VOC of 0.90 V, JSC of 15.38 mA cm−2, and FF of 64.71%. In addition, we also introduced other solvent additives, such as 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and diphenyl ether (DPE), which displayed a similar improvement, but the effect was not as prominent as that of DIO. The higher PCE of the PTSBTz-Me based device than that of PPSBTz-Me is mainly due to the striking JSC (17.34 vs. 15.38 mA cm−2) and FF (67.39% vs. 64.71%), which are beneficial to the enhanced light absorption of the blend film (Fig. S4, ESI†) and favorable morphology (discussed later). Moreover, both devices display a high VOC due to the deep HOMO energy level of the polymers with the thiazole unit. Meanwhile, the PPSBTz-Me based device exhibits a slightly higher VOC than the PTSBTz-Me based one (0.90 V vs. 0.89 V), which is consistent with the HOMO energy level.

Fig. 4(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on the two polymers. The curves exhibit a broad photoresponse ranging from 300 nm to 760 nm, which is slightly broader than that of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the blend films as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The absorption spectra of the blend films were measured without any post-treatment; however, the EQE spectra were measured under optimal conditions with DIO additive treatment. Normally, the absorption edge of the active layers will be broadened by optimizing molecular aggregation via post-treatment.44,45
According to the equation:  where EQE(λ) is the integral spectra, S is the AM 1.5G spectra, and λ is the wavelength. The JEQESC values of PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me calculated from the EQE curves are 16.49 mA cm−2 and 14.77 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in accordance with the JSC obtained from the J–V curves within a 5% error. Moreover, the highest value for PTSBTz-Me surpassed 70% in the range of 440 nm to 690 nm, which could further verify the higher JSC and PCE of PTSBTz-Me based devices.
As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM and PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM were measured by space charge limited current (SCLC) methods. It can be clearly seen that the μh of the PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM blend film is 2.57 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, twice as much as that of PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM (1.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the μe values of the two blend films are 6.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. A significant increase of μh is related to the high crystallinity and ordered structure of PTSBTz-Me. Such a high mobility is conducive to efficient charge transport and extraction, which could account for the higher JSC and larger FF of PTSBTz-Me.
Furthermore, photo energy loss (Eloss) is another significant factor to evaluate the performance of PSCs in the conversion from photons to electrons. Moreover, it could be obtained through the equation: Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor or acceptor component. Generally, Eloss below 0.6 eV would lead to inefficient charge generation, thus resulting in a low photocurrent and PCE. Using this equation, the Eloss values of PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me are calculated to be 0.76 eV and 0.79 eV, respectively.
In addition to charge transport, the recombination degree also plays an important role in obtaining high performance photovoltaic devices. The J–V curves under different light intensities were measured to study the charge recombination of the blend films. Commonly, the VOC and Plight follow the equation of VOC ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge.46 The PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM reveals a smaller n value (1.06) than PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM (1.10), as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The more close the n values are to 1, the more the trap recombination is inhibited. Synchronously, the correlation of JSC and Plight could be summarized by JSC ∝ Pαlight, where the α value is close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is restrained.47 The α values of PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM and PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM are 0.993 and 0.967, respectively. In conclusion, PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM has deeper inhibition traps and bimolecular recombination than PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM, which is in favor of effective charge transport. These results could be mainly attributed to the desirable morphology of the blend film and its good miscibility.
In order to figure out the relationship between the morphology of the BHJ layer and the photovoltaic performance, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to observe the morphology of the blend films (Fig. 5). From the TEM and AFM phase images (5 μm × 5 μm), the blend film of PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM exhibits a more uniform and orderly morphology, and distinct interpenetrating networks, which is in favor of exciton separation and charge transport. It can be seen from the AFM height images that the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM and PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM blend films without an additive are 3.58 and 4.34 nm, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). After addition of DIO, the RMS value of the PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM film decreases to 1.22 nm, and the film morphology becomes more homogeneous and uniform. In contrast, the RMS value of PPSBTz-Me/PC71BM increases to 6.04 nm. The difference in the RMS values of the two blend films may have resulted from the differences in DIO concentration and surface energy. During film formation, the fullerene derivative will usually aggregate into clusters and enrich at the bottom of the film due to its high surface energy. After DIO treatment, the fullerene molecules could be extracted to the surface and blended with polymers,48 thus resulting in smaller and continuous regions on the surface. Moreover, the degree of extraction of fullerene is related to DIO concentration, and the optimal DIO concentration for PPSBTz-Me is more than that for PTSBTz-Me. Therefore, the surface of the PPSBTz-Me blend film may be enriched with more fullerene. In addition, the larger difference of the surface energy of PPSBTz-Me with fullerene could lead to poor miscibility, which would be discussed later. This may eventually lead to the formation of larger domains on the surface, resulting an increase in roughness instead. Overall, the PTSBTz-Me/PC71BM blend film shows more desirable phase separation with a fibril-like structure due to the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor, which is associated with the surface energy. For fullerene materials, PC71BM, for example, has a roughly spherical structure and is more likely to blend well with highly ordered polymers with strong aggregation properties.49 This desirable morphology is a significant reason for the better performance of PTSBTz–Me than that of PPSBTz-Me in terms of JSC and FF.

It is known that the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor is not only the basis of emerging finely dispersed phase separation, but also the premise of exhibiting excellent photovoltaic performance.50 Hence, the contact angle measurement was performed to evaluate the surface energies (γ) of the net film to investigate the compatibilities. The images of water and diiodomethane droplets on the net films are presented in Fig. 6, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 3. The contact angles of PTSBTz-Me, PPSBTz-Me and PC71BM on water droplets and diiodomethane droplets are 102.53°, 100.36°, 75.02° and 42.82°, 45.17°, 19.74°, respectively. The Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ) was used to evaluate the miscibility of donors and acceptors, according to the equation: , where γ is the surface energy and K is a constant.51 The γ values of PTSBTz-Me, PPSBTz-Me and PC71BM are calculated to be 41.88, 39.40 and 47.94 mN m−1, and the χPTSBTz-Me–PC71BM and χPPSBTz-Me–PC71BM values are calculated to be 0.20 K and 0.41 K, respectively. In order to rule out experimental uncertainty, we carried out five independent repeated tests (Table S3, ESI†). The results show that the average surface energy of PTSBTz-Me is more close to that of PC71BM, thus getting a smaller χ value. A relatively low χ value means good miscibility and a strong interaction between the donor and acceptor. From the obtained χ values, we could draw the conclusion that PTSBTz-Me and PC71BM have strong interactions, which are in favor of forming appropriate phase separation with an interpenetrating network. The surface energy results are well consistent with the morphology. PTSBTz-Me with high crystallinity has better miscibility with the spherical PC71BM.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized two polymers based on BDT (D) and TT (A) units with different side chain substituents, thiophene sulfur and benzene sulfur, named PTSBTz-Me and PPSBTz-Me, respectively. The two-dimensional aryl-type side chains with different electron donating abilities have diverse impacts on polymers. PPSBTz-Me exhibits a deeper HOMO energy level, while PTSBTz-Me shows stronger intermolecular interactions, higher crystallinity and good miscibility with fullerene materials. PTSBTz-Me with the introduction of the thiophene substituent made the molecular conformation more flat, which could promote the ordered stacking and provide higher crystallinity. Meanwhile, polymers with strong aggregation and high crystallinity could blend better with fullerene materials of PC71BM. Finally, the PTSBTz-Me:PC71BM based device displays a favorable morphology with appropriate phase separation and a high PCE of 10.36%. This study shows that different substituents have significant impacts on the physicochemical properties of polymers, and the structure–property relationship needs to be further studied in depth.
