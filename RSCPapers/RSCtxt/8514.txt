    AbstractDescribed is the synthesis of TiO2 nanotube array films by anodization of Ti foil in HCl electrolytes containing different H2O2 concentrations. Highly ordered nanotube arrays up to 860 nm in length, 15 nm inner pore diameter, and 10 nm wall thickness were obtained for one hour anodizations using a 0.5 M HCl aqueous electrolyte containing 0.1–0.5 M H2O2 concentrations for anodization potentials between 10–23 V. The use of ethylene glycol as the electrolyte medium significantly alters the anodization kinetics and resulting film morphologies; nanotube bundles several microns in length achieved for anodization potentials between 8 V and 18 V in only a few minutes. The nanotube arrays obtained from the ethylene glycol electrolytes show relatively higher photocurrents, ≈0.8 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination a 500 °C annealed 1 cm2 nanotube array sample, obtained by anodization of a Ti foil sample in ethylene glycol + 0.5 M HCl + 0.4 M H2O2 electrolyte, demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of approximately 391 μL h−1 by water photoelectrolysis, time-power normalized evolution rate of 3.9 mL W−1 h−1, with water splitting confirmed by the 2 : 1 ratio of evolved hydrogen to oxygen.
1. Introduction
Titanium behaves as a typical valve metal for which anodic oxide growth involves field-assisted migration of ions through the oxide film. It is generally assumed that the electrochemical dynamics between oxide film formation and dissolution, given by the nature of electrolyte and anodization voltage, are key factors controlling the film growth and its properties. Depending on the anodic conditions, including electrolyte concentration and temperature, different types of anodic behavior have been observed for titanium such as uniform corrosion, localized corrosion (e.g. micro-pitting), self-passivation and film formation.
Highly ordered arrays of TiO2 nanotubes fabricated by anodization of Ti metal are of considerable current interest due to promising applications in many fields including gas sensing,1–3 solar cells,4–6 and in particular solar generation of hydrogen by water photoelectrolysis;6–11 review articles on the material architecture and its applications are available.12–14 The great utility of the nanotube arrays has motivated subsequent studies to further refine and extend the synthesis techniques. Recently we reported the fabrication of ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays by Ti anodization in a fluoride-free 3 M HCl electrolyte.15 The reported fabrication process suffered from a limited processing window (3 M HCl at 13 V), attributed to the complexity of the reaction of Ti in HCl as it includes six rate determining steps with three possible reaction pathways.16
Herein we present the fabrication of TiO2 nanotube arrays using a mixed electrolyte of HCl and H2O2 in both aqueous and non-aqueous media17,18 as well as evaluation of its photoelectrochemical properties. The use of the mixed HCl + H2O2 electrolyte enables more facile fabrication of the TiO2 nanotube arrays, with longer tube lengths being achieved.
2. Experimental
Pure titanium foil (0.25 mm thick) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Prior to anodization samples were cleaned with acetone followed by a deionized (D.I.) water rinse. The anodization was performed using a two-electrode cell with titanium foil as the working electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode at room temperature (approximately 22 °C). Ti-foil sample sizes were 1 cm × 2 cm, with 1 cm × 1 cm immersed in the electrolyte. Measurements were carried out in three sets of electrolytes: (1) 10 M H2O2 aqueous electrolyte under two applied voltages: 60 and 80 V, (2) 0.5 M HCl + 0.1–0.5 M H2O2 aqueous electrolytes under applied voltage in the range 5–25 V and (3) 0.5 M HCl + 0.1–0.5 M H2O2 in ethylene glycol electrolytes containing 2 vol.% H2O under applied voltage in the range 5–20 V. The time-dependent anodization currents were recorded using a computer controlled Keithley 2000 multimeter. The as-anodized samples were ultrasonically cleaned in D.I. water for 30 s to remove any surface debris. Sample morphology was examined using a JEOL JSM-6300 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The as-anodized samples were crystallized by oxygen annealing at 500 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 1 °C min−1.
Optical characterization of the nanotube arrays was performed using a Cary UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The photoelectrochemical properties were investigated using a three-electrode configuration, 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with a TiO2 nanotube-array sample as the working electrode (photoanode), saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil counter electrode. A scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments, model CHI 600B) was used to measure dark and illuminated currents at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Sunlight was simulated with a 300 W xenon lamp (Spectra Physics) and AM 1.5 filter (Oriel). The light intensity was set using a NREL calibrated crystalline silicon solar cell, equivalent to AM 1.5 light at 100 mW cm−2.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed on the TiO2 films using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer with an Al anode (Al KR: 1486.6 eV). The anode voltage and current were 14 keV and 20 mA, respectively. Photoelectrons were collected in hybrid mode over an analysis area of about 1.5 mm2, with the plane of the sample surface normal to the analyzer entrance. Spectra were referenced to C 1s at 285 eV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Behavior of Ti in pure H2O2 aqueous electrolytes
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a powerful oxidant (E° = 1.77 V) which increases the oxidation reaction rate and consequently produces a thicker oxide layer where the formation potential (Uf) mainly determines the film thickness (L):19 L = d0 + k(Uf − Uox)(1)where d0 is the initial or native oxide thickness, k is the film formation constant = dL/dU, Uox is the potential of the formed oxide which is −0.86 V for TiO2. Hydrogen peroxide initially produces an intense yellow color with acidic Ti(IV) solution, which changes with time to green and then purple, see Fig. 1. Samuni suggested that the reaction mechanism of Ti with H2O2 involves reaction between more than one H2O2 molecule with one Ti(IV) ion.20 Activation energy analysis suggests that at the metal/titania interface two H2O2 molecules react with a Ti(IV) ion resulting in titania layer growth. Recent theoretical work by Sever and Root postulated that the energy required to bind one H2O2 molecule to a Ti(IV) ion is about 0.17 eV.21

Fig. 2a and b show FESEM micrographs of Ti samples anodized in 10 M H2O2 aqueous solutions for 4 h at 60 V and 80 V, respectively. The results parallel those of Wu who reported the formation of a porous, amorphous titania layer on a Ti surface within 4 h of reaction with H2O2,22 while Arabatzis and Falaras reported the fabrication of porous TiO2 foam using H2O2.23 Luiz and Costa reported that the main effect of the oxidant occurs on the barrier layer and it is attributed to the generation of defects in this layer24 that can be explained as the result of strain energy from a combination effect of electrostatic, electrostriction, and re-crystallization stresses.25

Fig. 2c shows the current–time anodization behavior of the Fig. 2b 80 V sample. The small fluctuations in current after the current increase are similar to those observed for pitting initiation.26 Haber suggests a two-electron model to describe oxide dissolution and reformation at the Ti/TiO2 surface that may explain the porous-like structure seen in Fig. 2b:27 2 TiO2 + H2O2 + 2e− → Ti2O3 + H2O + O2(2) Ti2O3 + H2O2 → 2 TiO2 + H2O + 2e−(3)
3.2 Behavior of Ti in HCl–H2O2 aqueous electrolytes
Our previous investigation into the use of HCl as an electrolyte for Ti anodization to achieve titania nanotube arrays showed that we were unable to achieve nanotube architectures at anodization potentials other than 13 V or with HCl concentrations below 3 M.15 Herein we present our efforts in establishing a wider processing window for achieving nanotube arrays in HCl electrolytes with the aid of H2O2. Ti foil samples were anodized in aqueous solutions containing 0.5 M HCl with different H2O2 concentrations in the range 0.1–0.5 M over the voltage range 5–25 V. For a single anodization step we were unable to obtain either porous structures or nanotube arrays below 8 V; a nanoporous structures started to form at 8 V and nanotube arrays at 10 V. However using a series of anodizations of the same sample in new (i.e. fresh) electrolytes we were able to obtain nanotube arrays at 5 V.

Fig. 3a,b are FESEM images showing illustrative morphologies of the nanotube arrays achieved by anodization using an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 M HCl + xM H2O2 at 10 V for a one hour anodization: (a) x = 0.1 M, (b) x = 0.4 M. The nanotubular morphology is starting to form in Fig. 3a, while Fig. 3b shows a nanotube array architecture having the morphology commonly obtained using fluoride-based electrolytes.28,29 We note the ‘fuzzy’ layer atop the tubes is due to precipitation of a chloride layer on the sample surface.30,31Fig. 3c shows the corresponding anodization current–time response at 10 V, for 0.5 M HCl aqueous electrolytes containing variable H2O2 content; the current–time behavior is essentially identical to that seen when nanotube arrays are achieved via anodization of Ti in aqueous HF solutions.28,29Fig. 4 is an illustrative FESEM image of nanotube arrays fabricated at 20 V, one hour anodization, in the presence of 0.5 M HCl and 0.4 M H2O2; the nanotube array architecture is clearly evident. H2O2 concentrations above 0.4 M, or anodization voltages of 30 V or more, resulted in sample corrosion.

Fig. 5 summarizes the increase in nanotube length for one hour anodizations as a function of H2O2 concentration and voltage (10 V, 20 V; 0.5 HCl). The dissociation of H2O2 to HO2− and H+ ions is a pH dependent acid–base equilibrium: H2O2 ↔ HO2− + H+(4)It has been proposed that HO2− ions form a peroxide complex with titanium:32 Ti + HO2− + 3OH− ↔ Ti(OH)2O2 + H2O + 4e−(5)The Ti(OH)2O2 complex hydrolyses to form H2O2 and Ti(OH)4 which detach from the metal surface. The Ti(OH)2O2 complex may also react with HO2− ions to form soluble HTiO3− ions. Thus, the concentration32 of HO2− is critical during Ti oxidation in H2O2-containing electrolytes.

While we are unable to obtain a nanotubular structure in 10 M H2O2, nanotubular architectures are formed using low H2O2 concentrations with the aid of chloride ions. This result is in agreement with Richter and co-workers who studied the formation of small diameter (≈30 nm outer diameter) nanotube bundles in a mixture of oxalic acid and chloride-containing electrolytes and reported that chloride was the essential component for nanotube formation.30 However H2O2 has an active role that should not be neglected. Hahn and co-workers studied the formation of TiO2 nanotube arrays in chloride containing electrolytes (HClO4 and NaClO4), in the absence of H2O2, and reported that the breakdown of TiO2 in chloride containing electrolytes requires potentials of several tens of volts to occur.31 In contrast, with HCl + H2O2 electrolytes we are able to form TiO2 nanotube arrays at 10 V suggesting a possible synergism between the H2O2 and chloride ions that enhances the nanotube formation process.
3.3 Behavior of Ti in HCl–H2O2–ethylene glycol electrolytes
We investigated nanotube formation by anodization in ethylene glycol (EG) electrolytes17,18 containing 0.5 M HCl + 0.1–0.5 M H2O2 and 2 vol.% H2O under applied voltages in the range 5 V to 20 V. We found that various nanotube ‘-ish’ architectures could be obtained over the voltage range 8–18 V while the Ti sample starts to corrode above 18 V. We say tube-ish in that some pore openings could be seen under FESEM imaging, however they may well be a mix of wires and tubes. Fig. 6a and b show FESEM micrographs of the architectures formed upon anodizing Ti foil at 10 V in EG-containing electrolytes composed of 0.5 M HCl with 0.1 M and 0.4 M H2O2, respectively. The nanotube bundles, individual nanotube outer diameter ≈30 nm, start to form after only ≈90 s of anodization, with similar surfaces seen for anodization durations up to ten minutes, after which the sample tends to corrode. The nanotube bundles formed in solutions containing 0.1 M (Fig. 6a) and 0.2 M H2O2 (not shown) were irregular agglomerates in nature, however, these bundles start to show orientation in the presence of 0.3 M H2O2 or higher (Fig. 6b). It is also clear that the surface coverage increases as the H2O2 concentration increases since the nanotube growth starts randomly at certain points on the surface and then spreads out to cover almost the whole surface, in agreement with the results reported by Richter30 and Hahn31 who showed the formation of similar nanotube bundles in chloride-containing electrolytes. Note that nanotube bundles of ≈6 μm in length and 600 nm in width are formed upon the use of 0.4 M H2O2. Plots of current versus time as a function of H2O2 concentration (10 V, 0.5 M HCl) are shown in Fig. 6c. Depending upon H2O2 concentration we see a variety of time–current behaviors, including the classic dip–rise–gradual fall seen using fluoride ion containing electrolytes, as well as ones similar to those associated with nanoscale ‘pitting’ (e.g.Fig. 2c).
 Fig. 6  Illustrative FESEM images of a TiO2 nanotube bundles achieved by anodization of Ti foil for 120 s in ethylene glycol electrolytes containing 0.5 M HCl + xM H2O2 at 10 V: (a) x = 0.1 M, (b) x = 0.4 M; (c) the corresponding anodization current–time response of the samples as a function of H2O2 concentration. 

Fig. 7a is a FESEM image of baleen-looking structure from a mechanically fractured sample fabricated at 18 V, 0.5 M HCl + 0.4 M H2O2 for 80 s. The use of low concentrations of H2O2, namely 0.1 and 0.2 M, result in the formation of flower-like structures while the use of higher concentrations leads to the formation of well-aligned bundles. Nanotube bundles of up to approximately 6.5 μm in length can be formed upon the use of 0.4 M H2O2 however, as was the case in aqueous media, the addition of 0.5 M H2O2 leads to sample corrosion. Fig. 7b shows the current–time relations recorded for samples anodized at 18 V as a function of H2O2 concentration. The plots are similar to those obtained in aqueous media except for the electrolyte solution containing 0.5 M H2O2 which shows a sharp increase in current after its initial drop leading to sample corrosion.

It is well known that H2O2 can oxidize ethylene glycol. The following was shown to be a possible reaction pathway for the oxidation of EG with H2O2 (Scheme 1).33 While oxalic acid is oxidized to formic acid the rate is less than that for other intermediates, 7.7 × 106 mol s−1 for oxalic acid compared to 8.6 × 108 mol s−1 for glycolic acid.33
 Scheme 1 
The above reaction scheme indicates the possibility of EG oxidation by H2O2 to form a mixture of organic acids of lower viscosity. Richter and co-workers report the fabrication of TiO2 nanotube bundles in chloride-containing electrolytes with a combination with either oxalic or formic acid electrolytes.30 They were able to get these nanotube bundles over an applied voltage range of 11–20 V, behavior in close agreement with our present findings suggesting that EG is partially oxidized to a mixture of oxalic and formic acids. The transport number of 0.1–1.0 M HCl (tH+) in ethylene glycol at 298.15 K is almost constant (0.830)34 indicating that EG will not significantly alter the etching properties of HCl in our electrolyte system.
3.4 Photoelectrochemical and optical properties of the TiO2 architectures

Fig. 8 shows illuminated-less-dark photocurrent versus voltage values for the 500 °C annealed nanotubular TiO2 electrodes prepared at 10 V or 20 V anodization potentials in aqueous or EG solutions containing 0.5 HCl and 0.4 M H2O2, under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight in 1.0 M KOH. Also shown, for the 18 V EG fabricated sample, is the photocurrent generated by only the visible portion of the AM 1.5 spectrum. The dark current was less than 5 μA cm−2 for all samples over the displayed potential range. The electrodes show n-type behavior, i.e., positive photocurrents at anodic potentials.35,36 The AM 1.5 photocurrent values obtained are in close proximity with, or even slightly better than, those reported for TiO2 nanotubes fabricated in fluoride-containing media with the longer tubes obtained at 20 V giving higher values.

Also shown is the response of the 18 V EG sample to only the visible light portion of the AM 1.5 spectrum. 

Fig. 9 shows the squared AM 1.5 photocurrent as a function of applied voltage. The current gradually increases, becoming linear with applied bias indicating that the photogenerated charges are being efficiently separated by the electric field of the depletion layer.37 At higher potentials the squared photocurrent–potential plot deviates from linearity due to saturation resulting from the near complete collection of photogenerated charge carriers.

The corresponding light energy to chemical energy conversion (photoconversion) efficiencies for AM 1.5 illumination are shown in Fig. 10. The photoconversion efficiency η was calculated:14,38 η (%) = [(total power output − electrical power input)/light power input] × 100 = jp[(E0rev − |Eappl|)/I0] × 100(6)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA/cm2), JpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eappl| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of incident light (mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential which is 1.23 VNHE and the applied potential Eappl = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is electrode potential (versus Ag/AgCl) of the working electrode at which photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential (versus Ag/AgCl) of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions under same illumination and in the same electrolyte.

Fig. 11 is an illustrative drawing of the experimental setup for the water photoelectrolysis measurements with the nanotube arrays used as the photoanodes from which oxygen is evolved.14,39 We note that the oxygen bubbles evolving from the nanotube-array photoanode do not remain on the sample, hence the output remains stable with time irrespective of the duration of hydrogen production. The nanotube array photoanodes were held at constant voltage bias, determined by the peak position in the photoconversion efficiency curve with respect to the Ag/AgCl electrode. The highest AM 1.5 spectrum efficiency, due almost entirely to the UV portion of the AM 1.5 spectrum, of 0.42% was recorded for 18 V samples prepared in EG-containing electrolyte in the presence of 0.5 M HCl and 0.4 M H2O2. Fig. 12 shows the hydrogen generated as a function of time, in μL, under AM 1.5 illumination using a 1 cm2 ethylene glycol anodized sample, 18 V, 0.5 M HCl, 0.4 M H2O2, anodization duration 2 minutes, 500 °C annealed. The samples were mounted on a glass base and the electrical contacts were taken from the titanium substrate using copper leads and silver epoxy after removing the oxide layer at the titanium surface. All the regions except a 1 cm2 sample where covered using an insulating epoxy. The hydrogen evolution rate is approximately 391 μL h−1 (1 cm2 electrode under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination), with a time-power normalized evolution rate of 3.9 mL W−1 h−1. The water-splitting reaction was confirmed by the 2 : 1 ratio of evolved hydrogen to oxygen (GC; SRI, model 8610C); no performance degradation was observed during a 24 h continuous test.

Based on the observed extraordinary rapid formation of TiO2 architectures in the EG–HCl–H2O2 electrolyte, an oxide layer approximately 6 μm long grown in ≈80 s, and the possibility that this will lead to impurity incorporation in the TiO, which, in the case of an organic electrolyte will mainly be carbon,40 XPS analyses was performed. Fig. 13a and b show the C 1s XPS spectra for samples anodized in ethylene glycol containing 0.5 M HCl and 0.4 M H2O2 at 10 V and 18 V, respectively. In both cases the C 1s spectrum shows a strong peak at 285.7 eV, arising from adventitious carbon, and a weak peak at 281.4 eV that can be assigned to carbon associated with Ti–C bonds in the TiO2 architectures.41 Irie and co-workers observed a similar peak, around 281.8 eV, in C-doped TiO2 prepared by oxidizing TiC42 that they assigned to the C 1s peak of the Ti–C bond. Fig. 13b shows another peak at about 289 eV. Ren and co-workers observed a similar peak at 288.6 eV and assigned it to the presence of C–O bonds.43 The data indicate that carbon may substitute for some of the lattice titanium atoms forming a Ti–O–C structure. A slight inflection can be seen at 287.6 eV that could be assigned to interstitial carbon atoms.43

Fig. 14a shows the diffuse reflection spectra for nanotube arrays prepared in an aqueous solution containing 0.5 M HCl and 0.4 M H2O2 at 10 V and 20 V. One absorption peak appears at about 300 nm due to the intrinsic band gap absorption of TiO2. Other absorption peaks appear at ∼450 nm (10 V sample) and 660 nm (20 V sample). These findings are in close agreement with the results reported by Zhuang and co-workers who explained that trapped holes exhibit absorption at wavelengths less than 400 nm, while electrons trapped at the Ti4+ centre show the other absorption peak in the visible region.44Fig. 14b shows the diffuse reflection spectra for the TiO2 architectures fabricated in the ethylene glycol electrolyte containing 0.5 M HCl and 0.4 M H2O2 at 10 V and 18 V. Shankar and co-workers observed similar behavior in the spectra of flame annealed carbon-doped TiO2 nanotubes fabricated in fluorine-based electrolytes.45 The chlorine chemistry may facilitate the incorporation of carbon derived from the organic medium into the fabricated architectures. We note Richter and co-workers suggested that chlorine can act as a catalyst enhancing the formation of a ternary TiO2–C–Cl complex.40

Conclusions
The effect of 0.1–0.5 M H2O2 addition to aqueous and ethylene glycol (EG) solutions containing 0.5 M HCl on the formation of TiO2 nanotubes was investigated. Our results demonstrate that chloride ions can successfully be used to replace fluoride ions in the fabrication of TiO2 nanotube arrays by Ti anodization using aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore the presence of H2O2 expands the processing window for fabricating TiO2 nanotube arrays in the HCl + aqueous electrolytes. Nanotube arrays of up to 860 nm are formed in aqueous HCl + H2O2 electrolytes over an anodization potential window of 10 V to 23 V (one hour anodization), while we note nanotube arrays of ≈650 nm length could be achieved at 5 V using multiple anodization steps of shorter duration in fresh electrolyte solution. It appears the H2O2 + HCl combination in ethylene glycol electrolytes drives modest amounts of carbon incorporation within the resulting TiO2 structures. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination a 500 °C annealed 1 cm2 ethylene glycol anodized sample, 18 V, 0.5 M HCl + 0.4 M H2O2, demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of approximately 391 μL h−1, with a time-power normalized evolution rate of 3.9 mL W−1 h−1. The water-splitting reaction was confirmed by the 2 : 1 ratio of evolved hydrogen to oxygen with no sample degradation observed during a continuous 24 hour test, nor in samples periodically tested over several weeks.
