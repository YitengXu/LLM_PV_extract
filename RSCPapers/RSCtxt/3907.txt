    , Accepted 20th November 2009First published on 23rd December 2009AbstractWe report on the laser and sunlight driven, fast and large oscillation of cantilevers composed of photoresponsive liquid crystal polymer materials. The oscillation frequency, driven with a focused 100 mW laser of multiple wavelengths (457, 488, 514 nm), is as high as 270 Hz and is shown to be strongly correlated to the physical dimensions of the cantilever. The experimental frequency response is accurately described by the calculated natural resonant frequency for a non-damped cantilever. To further understand the conversion efficiency of light energy to mechanical work in the system, the oscillatory behavior of a 2.7 mm × 0.7 mm × 0.04 mm cantilever was examined at pressures ranging from 1 atm to 0.03 atm. A large increase in amplitude from 110° at STP to 250° at low pressure was observed. A first approximation of the system efficiency was calculated at 0.1%. The large increase in amplitude at low pressure indicates strong hydrodynamic loss and thus, the material efficiency is potentially much greater. Using a simple optical setup, oscillatory behavior was also demonstrated using sunlight. This work indicates the potential for remotely triggered photoactuation of photoresponsive polymer cantilevers from long distances with lasers or focused sunlight.
Introduction
The generation of mechanical output from an input energy stimulus in soft materials such as polymers continues to be a topic of great technological and academic interest.1 A classic example of such stimuli-responsive materials are shape memorypolymers, which commonly utilize thermal energy and convert it into mechanical output for use in robotics, sportswear, and numerous biomedical applications including the burgeoning area of artificial muscles.2,3 Similarly, liquid crystal polymer networks (LCN) are well-known to possess anisotropic and elastic properties that can be accessed by a number of methods.4 Previous research has shown that a variety of mechanical outputs can be generated in LCN materials stimulated by thermal, magnetic,5,6 chemical (pH, polarity, or humidity),7–9 or optical10–14 energy forms. This ever-growing field continues to demonstrate novel methods to harness the generated work on both macroscopic and increasingly microscopic size scales.
Of particular interest is the ability to remotely trigger a mechanical response over long distances at potentially microscopic scales. Towards this end, the use of light to generate mechanical work relies heavily on the advantages of optical exposure—the tremendous ease of remote, spatial, and temporal control of the nascent light beam. The idea of photogenerating mechanical responses in polymeric materials was first drawn out by Lovrien in 1967.15 Since the original work, a number of groups have examined chromophore-based soft materials with an eye towards converting the microscopic structural changes induced by photoisomerization into mechanical stimuli. Due to a number of contributing factors, most of the early work focused on the synthesis of azobenzene-based polymeric materials. Despite the considerable effort, the maximum photogenerated contractile strain was relatively limited (∼1%). This changed in 2001 when Finkelmann et al. synthesized a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) with an azobenzene based molecule as the mesogenic unit which lead to substantial photogenerated contractile strains (∼20%)10 arising from a decrease in the order of the LC phase. Since this original demonstration, this research area has seen a number of seminal contributions reported in a number of recent reviews.16–18
More recently, the examination of photoresponsive LCN materials has primarily focused on the synthesis of new chemistries11,13,19–21 and/or different LC domain22,23 orientations in addition to the fundamental physics24–26 that underlay the processes. A consistent theme amongst the examinations of azobenzene-based LCN (azo-LCN) materials has been their wavelength and polarization sensitivity. Ikeda and coworkers demonstrated that the bending direction of thin polydomain azo-LCN films (heated above its Tg but below Tni) can be controlled by the polarization direction of a linearly-polarized UV light source.13 This work is a great example of the most common means of actuating azo-LCN samples, UV light exposure that drives trans to cisisomerization. This change in conformation drives a local change in the order of the LCpolymer network causing directional contraction that is correlated to the polarization direction of the light source. Higher wavelength light exposure can be used to drive the reverse cis to transisomerization to return the thin film to its original position. A related exposure technique has been recently demonstrated using light in the range of 440–514 nm to induce trans–cis–trans reorientation, also known as the Weigert effect27 in the surface relief grating community. Light in this regime is absorbed nearly equivalently by both the trans and cis isomers, such that the dichroism of the azobenzene material dictates reorientation of the chromophore orthogonal to the polarization direction of the light source. This exposure technique has been used to drive polarization-angle controlled unidirectional bending in monodomain azo-LCN cantilevers28 and bidirectional bending in polydomain azo-LCN cantilevers.29 More recently, light in this regime has been used to drive oscillations in monodomain azo-LCN cantilevers.30 The large amplitude and high frequency oscillations (up to 30 Hz) resulted from a novel exposure geometry of a focused 100 mW laser source (0.3–0.9 W/cm2) that drove at the cantilevers resonance frequency by sequentially exposing the front and back surface of the cantilever as it inertially passed through the beam.
This work examines the oscillation of cantilevers composed of monodomain azo-LCNs as a function of laser power, cantilever aspect ratio, and atmospheric pressure. The experimental results from these examinations are compared to the theoretical dependences for resonant, non-damped cantilever oscillations. Simple estimations of the input energy and output work are used to calculate overall system efficiency. The data suggests approaches to achieve much faster and more efficient oscillatory behavior. These high speed, remotely accessed, oscillatory photodriven transducers have potential application in a variety of areas including microfluidics and remotely accessed optical elements. Notably, these fast and large amplitude oscillations are demonstrated for the first time using sunlight,31 the cheapest and most readily available actinic source.
Results and discussion
The phenomenon of light-induced oscillations is particularly efficient for monodomain azobenzene liquid crystal polymer network (azo-LCN) materials where oscillations of 28 Hz frequency and nearly 170 degrees amplitude were observed for a cantilever of geometry 5 mm (height) × 1 mm (width) × 50 μm (thickness).30 Shown in Fig. 1 is the alignment of the cantilever with respect to the incident Ar+ laser. If the cantilever base is exposed to laser intensity above a threshold power density, the cantilever tip has a sufficient moment of inertia to deflect through the focused (3 mm diameter) laser beam. The back surface of the cantilever, now exposed, reverses the direction of the surface contraction, starting a feedback loop between the upstroke and downstroke. Of critical importance to the effect is the generation of a photoelastic response (e.g. surface contractile strain only generated in the presence of the actinic light).
 Fig. 1  The polymer film is mounted vertically (start position shown with dashed lines) and oscillates around the horizontal plane of incidence of the laser beam with full oscillation angle φ. 
The frequency and amplitude of oscillations (the deflection angle of the cantilever tip) as a function of laser beam power density for an azo-LCN cantilever of 2.7 mm × 0.8 mm × 50 μm size are shown in the images of Fig. 2a and plotted in Fig. 2b, as well as in MOVIE1 (ESI‡). Increasing the laser power density increases the amplitude of the oscillations but does not increase the frequency. Since such behavior is typical to second order phase transitions, we expect the oscillation angle (see Fig. 1) to increase with power density as φ ∼ (I − Ith)1/2. Indeed, such a fit holds well for power density values exceeding the threshold by up to 50% (Fig. 2c). Thereafter, nonlinear processes are highly evident in the plot of azo-LCN cantilever deformation as a function of I1/2. The nonlinearity is related not only with the large amplitude of the oscillations, but also by the changing material parameters due to local temperature increases. Estimates and measures of the local heating confirm there is some rise depending on the power density although the increase is still below the glass transition point (∼65 °C).

(c) The amplitude of cantilever deflection as a function of power (u = tan(φ/2)). 
As observed in Fig. 2b, the frequency of oscillation is independent of the power density of the Ar+ exposure. However, reducing the cantilever length by half from 5 mm (examined previously) to 2.7 mm examined in this work, results in an increase of oscillation frequency by a factor of four, from 32 Hz to 120 Hz. The resonant frequency equation for a cantilever (non-damped)32 is given in eqn (1): (1)
Assuming that the material density and modulus are constant during photoactuation, the frequency becomes: (2)
In eqn (1) and (2), it is clear that the cantilever frequency f is related inversely to its length as f ∼ l−2 and linearly to thickness as f ∼ t. To determine the validity of these relationships in this photodriven oscillator, Fig. 3a and 3b plot the frequency as a function of length and thickness. In both cases, the expected dependence of frequency on these geometrical considerations is met to a high degree of accuracy. Notably, as the cantilever length is reduced from 6 mm to 1.5 mm, the frequency increases from 23 Hz to 271 Hz. The oscillating azo-LCP cantilever of 1.5 mm × 0.8 mm × 50 μm size completes 7 cycles in just 26 ms (inset Fig. 3a). As predicted by eqn (2), the dependence of oscillation frequency on cantilever length is well fit by the function f = At/l2. Assuming a density of 1 g cm−3, the constant A yields an estimate of ∼1.0 GPa for the Young's modulus E of the material, close to that experimentally measured at 0.6–0.8 GPa.
 Fig. 3  (a) Oscillation frequency of 0.8 mm-wide and 50 μm-thick azo-LCN film as a function of the film length measured at 90 mW (1.27 W cm−2) laser beam power density. The inset shows the photodetector signal registered for oscillations of 1.5 mm-long azo-LCN film at 271 Hz. (b) Oscillation frequency of a 5 mm (long) × 1 mm (wide) as a function of cantilever thickness. 
The mechanical energy of cantilever oscillations can be evaluated proceeding from the expression UM = meffvm2/2 where meff is the effective mass related to the actual mass of a rectangular cantilever, meff ≈ 0.24m, and vm ∼ ωl is the maximum speed reached in the process of oscillations of a cantilever of length l at the frequency f = ω/2π. Given the mass of the cantilever, a l ∼ 0.15 cm, and a f ∼ 270 Hz, we obtain UM ∼ 5 × 10−8 J. The energy provided by a light beam of 1 W cm−2 power density within the time period 1/f into a surface area equal to that of the film is of the order of E ∼ 5 × 10−5 J. Hence, the direct energy conversion efficiency from light to mechanical motion is η ∼ 0.1%. However, these calculations are an overall system efficiency and do not estimate a material efficiency.
Similar to a beating hummingbird wing, the oscillating polymer cantilever is accomplishing significant work on the surrounding environment. The amount of loss attributed to hydrodynamic effects is examined in Fig. 4, through observation of the oscillation of an azo-LCN cantilever (2.7 mm × 0.8 mm × 50 μm) in a vacuum chamber with pressure ranging from 1 to 0.03 atm. Interestingly, the amplitude of oscillation of this azo-LCN cantilever at 87 mW (1.23 W cm−2) power density level increases from 110° at 1 atm to 252° at 0.03 atm air pressure. Also notable is the consistency of the oscillation frequency over the examined range of pressure. The results presented in Fig. 4 confirm that the oscillating cantilever is doing a significant amount of work on the atmosphere around it. This also suggests that the material conversion efficiency of input light energy to output mechanical energy is in fact much greater than the 0.1% estimated for the system. Experiments are in progress to ascertain a material efficiency. From a system level perspective, consider that f ∼ l−2, m ∼ l and E ∼ l/f. Thus, we may expect that the efficiency of energy conversion increases strongly with decreasing length of the film, η ∼ l−4, since a smaller cantilever area is acting on the surroundings. This dependence indicates that greater conversion of optical energy into cantilever motion will occur by decreasing the cantilever length. The oscillation frequency calculated for 100 μm cantilevers would be 7 MHz.

(Bottom) Snapshots of the oscillating azo-LCN at different air pressure levels: (1) 0.03 atm, (2) 0.17 atm, (3) 0.33 atm, (4) 0.5 atm, (5) 0.67 atm, (6) 0.84 atm, (7) 1 atm. 
The potential for higher frequency is even more stirring given results presented in Fig. 5 which demonstrates for the first time that focused sunlight can drive oscillations of these azo-LCN polymer cantilevers. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 and MOVIE2 (ESI‡), a 5 mm × 0.8 mm × 0.05 mm cantilever oscillates at an estimated 28 Hz. The amplitude of the oscillation is approximately 110°. We speculate that the cause of the oscillation is primarily photochemical in nature, as the spectral emission of the sun peaks around 500 nm, similar to the laser sources used heretofore. The sunlight-driven oscillation opens up an even broader range of possibilities, including energy harvesting and new considerations as light-work transducers that utilize the cheapest of energy sources.

Experimental
The azobenzene liquid crystal polymer network (modulus 0.6–0.8 GPa //to domain, Tg ∼ 65 °C, TNI 147 °C) used in this study was obtained by copolymerization of azobenzene liquid crystal monomer 4-(6-acryloxy)hexyloxy-4′-ethoxyazobenzene (90 wt%) with 4,4′-di(6-acryloxyalkyloxy)azobenzene (9 wt%) using 1,1′-azobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile) (1 wt%) as thermal initiator. Polymerization was performed in a cell with planar aligning boundary conditions in the nematic phase of the mixture at the constant temperature of 89 °C. Samples were extracted from the alignment cell and cut into cantilevers of various aspect ratios.
Oscillations were induced, as previously reported,30 with the combined 457, 488, and 514 nm lines of an Argon-ion (Ar+) laser. The multiwavelength beam of the Ar+ laser was expanded to 3 mm diameter transmitted through a polarization rotator before sample exposure. Oscillations actuated with sunlight were undertaken in a simple optical setup consisting of a focusing lens and a polarization rotator. The azo-LCN cantilevers were aligned so that the exposed area was maximum during oscillations. Oscillations were observed with the sample mounted vertically up, vertically down, as well as sideways although all the reported results here were obtained for films mounted vertically up. The oscillation frequency was measured with a photodiode and an oscilloscope. The amplitude of the oscillation was measured by imaging with a photocamera followed by subsequent analysis of the frames.
Conclusions
Experimental observation of the photodriven oscillation of cantilevers composed of monodomain azobenzene-containing liquid crystal polymer networks (azo-LCN) is shown to agree with the expected mechanics, confirmed by direct correlation of the frequency response to the physical dimensions of the sample. Simplified estimates of work output for a given light energy input indicate a system-level efficiency of 0.1%. However, the increased amplitude of the oscillations of azo-LCN cantilevers in low pressure environments indicates that loss is influenced by hydrodynamics, e.g., the cantilever is accomplishing work on the atmosphere surrounding it. Notably, for the first time, oscillation of azo-LCN cantilevers are driven with sunlight—opening up new possibilities in energy harvesting in addition to the potential applications in remote, laser-directed actuation.
