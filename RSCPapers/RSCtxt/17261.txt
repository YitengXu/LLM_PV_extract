    , Accepted 23rd July 2019First published on 29th July 2019AbstractFullerene-free organic solar cells (OSCs) were fabricated using a blend of wide bandgap donor PBDB-T and ultranarrow bandgap acceptor IEICO-4F as binary photoactive layers. The ultranarrow bandgap acceptor 4TIC was selected as the third component due to the shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, the good compatibility compared to that of IEICO-4F and the wide energy levels offset between the donor and acceptor. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ternary OSCs increased from 10.02% to 11.63% when 40% IEICO-4F was replaced with 4TIC, with an enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.82 V and without sacrificing the short-circuit current (JSC) or fill factor (FF). The main contribution of 4TIC can be summarized as the elevated LUMO level of the acceptor blended and enhanced exciton utilization of the ternary photoactive layer due to the second light absorption of 4TIC and efficient energy transfer from PBDB-T to the blended acceptor. Simultaneously, 4TIC can also act as a regulator to adjust the PBDB-T molecular arrangement for weak charge carrier recombination and optimizing charge carrier transport resulting in the lack of any decrease in the JSC and FF values of ternary OSCs even when the absorption spectrum of the ternary photoactive layer does not match the AM 1.5G solar simulator spectrum. Thus, approximately 15% PCE improvement was achieved by adopting the ternary strategy based on PBDB-T–IEICO-4F binary OSCs with a PCE of 10.02%.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on solution processable p-type polymer semiconductors as a donor and n-type small molecules as an acceptor have attracted considerable interest in recent years.1–3 The traditional photoactive layer of OSCs consists of p-type polymer donor and n-type fullerene derivative acceptor materials.4–6 However, there are also certain disadvantages of fullerene derivatives that need to be addressed, such as the absorption peak in the short wavelength region (the absorption peaks are located at 240 nm and 380 nm for PCBM and PC71BM, respectively) and the deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (the LUMO energy levels are 4.1 eV and 3.9 eV for PCBM and PC71BM, respectively).7,8 However, a significant challenge must be overcome in order to match the light spectrum of the AM 1.5G solar simulator and the LUMO energy levels of donor materials. Fullerene-free acceptors have recently been vigorously developed and have replaced the common fullerene derivative small molecule acceptor materials for high-performance OSCs, which play an important role in the broad absorption windows, particularly in the long wavelength and near infrared region, and adjusting the LUMO energy levels according to the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor materials.9–11
Thus, new fullerene-free acceptors were designed and synthesised with thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–thiophene as the central donor unit and electron-deficient 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one as the terminal acceptor unit to construct a new low-bandgap fullerene-free acceptor, thiophene-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene–thiophene-3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (4TIC), which exhibits a near infrared light absorption window (the absorption peak is located at approximately 796 nm) and a shallow LUMO energy level (the LUMO is −3.78 eV).9,12 The other fullerene-free acceptor is 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F), with a shallow LUMO energy level (the LUMO is −4.05 eV) and a redshifted absorption peak (the absorption peak is approximately 835 nm).
To further improve the photovoltaic performance, the ternary strategy (the donor or acceptor materials as third component materials) has also been used to broaden the absorption windows and adjust the LUMO and HOMO of the photoactive layer.13–15 If the advantages in the photovoltaic performance of fullerene-free OSCs and ternary OSCs are recombined into one OSC by employing fullerene-free ternary OSCs, efficient fullerene-free ternary OSCs can be obtained with balanced photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE).
Inverted ternary OSCs were fabricated with PBDB-T as the donor and a blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC as the acceptor. The PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 10.02% with a JSC of 20.45 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.72 V and a FF of 64.9%. The PBDB-T:4TIC-based binary OSCs exhibit a PCE of 8.45% with a JSC of 16.45 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.84 V and a FF of 61.2%. For the blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC as the electron acceptor, the ternary PSCs are apparently complementary photovoltaic parameters of the two binary OSCs. The PCE of the optimized ternary PSCs (the ratio of IEICO-4F:4TIC is 6:4) reaches 11.63% with a JSC of 21.52 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.82 V and a FF of 65.9%. Over 15% PCE improvement can be achieved in comparison to the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based binary OSCs owing to the simultaneously significantly enhanced VOC and slightly increased JSC and FF. According to the alloyed model based on the good compatibility of the used materials, the VOC values of ternary PSCs are monotonously increased along with the increasing 4TIC content. However, through alloyed model calculations, the enhancement of the VOC value is beyond the increase in the energy level offset between the donor and the blended acceptor (Eg), which is attributed to the decrease of the energy losses (Eloss) of the photoactive layer. It should be a smart strategy to recombine the advantages of binary PSCs into one ternary cell by selecting a third component with appropriate energy levels and good compatibility with the host system.16,17
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the binary OSCs with pristine IEICO-4F and pristine 4TIC as the electron acceptor and the optimized ternary OSCs (the ratio of IEICO-4F:4TIC is 6:4). Detailed photovoltaic parameters of all the OSCs are given in Table 1. Fig. 1(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the OSCs in Fig. 1(a). The calculated JSC values from the EQE spectrum are 20.95, 21.04 and 15.84 mA cm−2, which correspond to the IEICO-4F:4TIC ratios of 100:0, 60:40 and 0:100, respectively; the average errors of both the measured and calculated JSC values are less than 5%.18–20

Fig. 2a shows the normalized absorption spectrum of the pristine donor and the pristine acceptor; the IEICO-4F films exhibit long wavelength absorption windows (the absorption peak of IEICO-4F is located at 835 nm) and the absorption peaks are redshifted approximately 35 nm compared to that of the 4TIC films (the absorption peak of 4TIC is located at 800 nm). When the blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC replaced pristine IEICO-4F (as shown in Fig. 2b), the normalized absorption spectra of both the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films and the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary films exhibit similar main absorption peaks at 615 nm (corresponding to PBDB-T) and slightly blueshifted acceptor absorption peaks (blueshifted from 830 nm to 810 nm). Thus, the near infrared light absorption window of IEICO-4F plays an important role in efficiently harvesting long wavelength and near infrared photons of the photoactive layer.21 In contrast to the AM 1.5G solar simulator spectrum, the maximum light energy focusing on the long wavelength and near infrared regions, the blueshift absorption spectrum of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films is not beneficial for efficiently harvesting long wavelength and near infrared photons compared with the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary films. Fig. 2c (the absorption spectral difference (ΔAbsorption) between ternary films and binary films) further confirms this result.22 To intuitively observe the effect of the ternary photoactive layer on the EQE spectra of OSC, the EQE spectral differences (ΔEQEs) between the ternary OSC and the binary OSC were employed to investigate the influence of the binary photoactive layer and the ternary photoactive layer on the photocurrent response. As shown in Fig. 2d, when the blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC replaced pristine IEICO-4F as the electron acceptor, the ΔEQE curve of the ternary OSC showed positive values and better photocurrent response in the whole visible light region, which is attributed to the improved utilization of exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.23 Thus, the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC exhibits efficient photocurrent response in the whole visible light region even when inefficiently harvesting long wavelength and near infrared photons compared with the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary OSCs. Next, we will investigate the work mechanisms of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC by exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport and collection as well as charge carrier recombination.

For a traditional binary OSC, the VOC values are determined by the difference in the energy level offset (Eg, between the LUMO of the acceptor, EAcceptorLUMO, and the HOMO of the donor, EDonorHOMO) and photon energy loss (Eloss) as given by the following empirical relation:24,25  However, while introducing a third component material, the LUMO or HOMO levels of the donor or acceptor were changed considerably with the third component material energy level and concentration. The energy level of the ternary photoactive layer is influenced by the quasi-frontier orbital density (Ne) of these acceptor and donor materials according to the empirical relation:26,27  where VOC Binary1, VOC Binary2, and VOC Ternary are the VOC values of the binary OSC and ternary OSCs, respectively; and Ne1 and Ne2 are the quasi-frontier orbital densities of pristine donor 1 (or pristine acceptor 1) and pristine donor 2 (or pristine acceptor 2) in the mixed donor (or mixed acceptor), respectively. Ne can be calculated according to the following formula:28Ne = nlwhere n and l are the molecular number of unit mass and the number of quasi-degenerate LUMOs per molecule (<0.1 eV), respectively.29 Additionally, f1 and f2 are the weight-composition fractions of donors 1 and 2 (or acceptors 1 and 2) in the mixed donor (or mixed acceptor), respectively. The molecular weight, n, l, and Ne values for 4TIC and IEICO-4F are listed in Table S1 (ESI†).30–32 According to the above formula, the Eg and Eloss dependence on the ratio of IEICO-4F:4TIC were calculated and are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). After the blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC replaced pristine IEICO-4F, the ternary OSC exhibited a shallower LUMO energy level and a wider energy level offset between the EAcceptorLUMO and EDonorHOMO than those of the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based binary OSC, which is beneficial for enhanced VOC values.33,34 The significantly higher PCE of the ternary OSC is due to its higher VOC, which should be ascribed to the simultaneously wide energy level offset (from 1.16 to 1.23 eV) and reduced energy loss (from 0.44 to 0.41 eV). The nature of the wide energy level offset can be determined by the alloyed model. Generally, the Eloss of OSC is determined by the competition between charge transport/extraction and recombination as well as the driving force of exciton dissociation. We investigated the exciton dissociation, charge carrier mobility and recombination.
Photoluminescence quenching and photoluminescence emission lifetime measurements provide a straightforward approach to estimate the exciton dissociation efficiency. Fig. 3a shows the photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra of pristine PBDB-T, IEICO-4F, PBDB-T:IEICO-4F and IEICO-4F:4TIC binary films and PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films. After incorporating the pristine electron acceptor or blended electron acceptor into PBDB-T, significant PL quenching was observed for the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary films, and much more PL quenching occurred for the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary film. Furthermore, there was remarkable PL quenching for the IEICO-4F:4TIC binary films. In the blended films, identical molecules are closely packed, potentially leading to strong photoluminescence self-quenching. Fig. 3b shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. The emission lifetimes (η) decreased from 11.8 ns (for pristine PBDB-T) to 3.85 ns (for PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary films) and further decreased to 3.46 nm (for PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary film). In addition, for the IEICO-4F:4TIC films, the η value significantly decreased to 1.13 nm (the η value of pristine IEICO-4F is 1.87 ns). This finding together with the more efficient PL quenching and the significant decrease in emission lifetimes for the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary film could be collectively responsible for the more sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation from the donor to blended acceptor phases and the fast rate of charge transfer in the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films.35,36

We have calculated the charge transfer rate constant (kct) by the η value of different films and according to the below formula:37–39  The estimated kct values were 2.649 × 108 and 2.042 × 108 corresponding to the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC and PBDB-T:IEICO-4F films, respectively. Notably remarkably higher kct values of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC films relative to PBDB-T:IEICO-4F films were seen, which further indicates more efficient exciton dissociation when tripling the PBDB-T/IEICO-4F, PBDB-T/4TIC and IEICO-4F/4TIC interface compared to a single PBDB-T/IEICO-4F interface.40,41 The approximately 0.3 eV of the LUMO energy level offset between the donor and acceptor interface is often cited as the threshold energy level offset needed for efficient exciton dissociation.42,43 There is a small LUMO–LUMO offset between IEICO-4F and 4TIC (only 0.27 eV); it is not clear whether or not a smaller LUMO–LUMO offset between IEICO-4F and 4TIC (lower than 0.3 eV) negatively affects exciton dissociation. The sandwich configuration of OSCs was fabricated with the “ITO/photoactive layer/Al” configuration (the pristine IEICO-4F, pristine 4TIC and blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC as the photoactive layers). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3c. With the blended films of IEICO-4F and 4TIC as the photoactive layer, a higher JSC value was obtained (the JSC was 0.96 mA cm−2) compared to the pristine IEICO-4F-based OSC (the JSC was 0.61 mA cm−2) and the pristine 4TIC-based OSC (the JSC was 0.55 mA cm−2), which indicates that excitons can be dissociated into free charge carriers at the IEICO-4F/4TIC interface and produce a higher photocurrent.44,45
As shown in Fig. 3d, the PL peaks of IEICO-4F and PBDB-T exhibited an apparent overlap with the absorption region of 4TIC, which leads to the second light absorption of 4TIC from the PL of IEICO-4F and causes energy transfer from the binary photoactive layer (the blend of IEICO-4F and PBDB-T) to 4TIC according to FRET theory.46–48 According to the energy transfer efficiency (E) formula (ηpristine is the emission lifetime of the pristine PBDB-T films and ηblend is the emission lifetime of the blended films):46–48  The energy transfer efficiencies of the ternary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC and binary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F films are 70.67% and 67.37%, respectively. The PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films exhibit the highest fluorescence quenching efficiency and energy transfer efficiency. PL quenching and TRPL characteristics could be collectively responsible for more efficient exciton dissociation, which could occur at the interface of PBDB-T/IEICO-4F, PBDB-T/4TIC and IEICO-4F/4TIC. Thus, 4TIC as the third component material is beneficial for light absorption of binary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F films, which could exhibit more efficient exciton dissociation at the interface of PBDB-T/IEICO-4F, PBDB-T/4TIC and IEICO-4F/4TIC.
The SCLC measurements were employed to evaluate the charge-carrier mobility (the SCLC curve and all the values are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively). Ternary SCLC devices (for which the ratio of IEICO-4F:4TIC is 6:4) exhibit the highest electron mobility (μe), with a large gain in the μe value from 2.58 × 10−4 to 4.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the binary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based SCLC device, while μh slightly decreased from 7.84 × 10−4 to 7.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is known that excitons can be dissociated at the donor/acceptor interface (D/A), and the electrons will transport along the acceptor channels as well as holes transporting along the donor channels.13,49 Thus, the introduction of a third component material at the binary photoactive layer can strongly affect the μe and slightly affect the μh. Simultaneously, the ternary photoactive layer enhances the μe value and balances the charge carrier transport between the anode and the cathode (the μe/μh values are 0.33, 0.57 and 0.31 corresponding to the IEICO-4F:4TIC ratios of 100:0, 60:40 and 0:100, respectively), which reduces the electron accumulation at the cathode interface.50,51

Surface energy analysis was employed to investigate the role of 4TIC in the ternary photoactive layer, and the detailed calculation method and relevant parameters are described in the ESI.† The third component material 4TIC has a different surface energy (γ) compared to pristine PBDB-T and IEICO-4F, which might offer driving forces for the rough interface of PBDB-T:4TIC binary films and will reflect the role of 4TIC in the ternary photoactive layer.52,53 The surface energies of pristine PBDB-T, IEICO-4F and 4TIC are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). The related interfacial surface energies between two materials were estimated and are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). There are similar γ values for both PBDB-T and IEICO-4F (25.25 and 27.75 mJ cm−2 respectively), and a significant enhancement in the γ value for 4TIC (32.24 mJ cm−2) was seen. These similar surface energy values are collectively responsible for good miscibility in blend films, while the high interfacial surface energy difference between PBDB-T and 4TIC is collectively responsible for poorer miscibility.53 If the wetting coefficient (ω) > 1, the 4TIC molecule will locate in the PBDB-T domain. If ω < −1, the 4TIC molecule will locate in the IEICO-4F domain. If −1 < ω < 1, the 4TIC molecule will locate at the interface between PBDB-T and IEICO-4F. From Table S5 (ESI†), the ω value of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films was −1.56, indicating that 4TIC is located within IEICO-4F domains.9,54,55
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to study the effect of blended electron acceptors on the roughness and crystallinity. For binary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F and PBDB-T:4TIC, and ternary PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC films, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are approximately 2.16 nm, 3.45 nm and 2.19 nm respectively (as shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). The minor roughness variation in PBDB-T:IEICO-4F and PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC films indicates good compatibility between a large amount of PBDB-T and IEICO-4F and a small amount of 4TIC. The large RMS value of the PBDB-T:4TIC binary film indicates poor compatibility between PBDB-T and 4TIC, which is unfavourable for exciton dissociation at the interfaces and might provide charge carrier recombination centres.56,57 Based on the aforementioned interfacial surface energy results, we find that a small interfacial surface energy should be favorable for good compatibility and smooth morphology for the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary film and the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary film. However, the PBDB-T:4TIC blend film possessed a large interfacial surface energy, which is attributed to the poor compatibility between PBDB-T and 4TIC and causes a rough surface in PBDB-T:4TIC films.
For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary films, the laminar diffraction peaks located at 5.53° correspond to the PBDB-T molecule and a lamellar distance of 8.0334 Å. For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films, the laminar diffraction peak shifts to 5.72° (the lamellar distance is 7.7528 Å) and the intensities of the diffraction peaks significantly increase, which indicates quite strong structure order and π–π stacking. However, for pristine 4TIC as the electron acceptor, the PBDB-T:4TIC binary films show strongly decreased diffraction peak intensities and a small laminar diffraction angle (5.35°), which indicates sharp reduction in crystallinity and a large lamellar distance of 8.2618 Å. The presence of the blend of IEICO-4F and 4TIC could improve the ternary photoactive layer crystallization, indicating good material mixing.
The photocurrent density (Jph) dependence on the applied voltage (Veff) was measured (Jph–Veff) (as shown in Fig. 5), and the saturation current density (Jsat, the applied voltage is 2.5 V), maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), and Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power-point conditions (as shown in Table 3) were calculated according to the following formulas:58,59  where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an AM 1.5G solar simulator and under dark conditions, respectively, and Va and V0 are the changing applied voltage and the applied voltage at Jph = 0, respectively. Jph/Jsat under short-circuit and maximum power output conditions gives the exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and the charge carrier collection efficiency (ηcoll).58,60,61 For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSCs, a slightly increased Jph value and a slightly decreased Jsat value were obtained compared to the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based ternary OSCs, which correspond to more efficient photocurrent response and a sharply saturated state. For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSCs, the slight decrease in the Gmax value is attributed to the reduced photon harvesting ability and is consistent with Fig. 2b and c.62,63 When the applied voltage is 2.5 V, maximum photogenerated excitons can be dissociated to free electrons and holes as well as transported to the individual electrodes.64,65 The PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC shows the highest ηdiss and ηcoll values, which indicates the efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor tripling interface as well as charge carrier transport and collection between the photoactive layer and the electrode, which is consistent with the highest FF and JSC value of the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC, even if the absorption spectrum of the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary photoactive layer does not match the AM 1.5G solar simulator spectrum.28,66

The J–V curve dependence on the light intensity (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†) was measured to investigate the charge carrier recombination. From Fig. 6a, under the open circuit condition, the photogenerated charge carriers will recombine by bimolecular recombination or the combination of bimolecular recombination and monomolecular recombination within the photoactive layers which is evaluated using the formula:67,68  where n is the slope of the plot of VOCversus the light intensity (I). The n value of 1 for the OSC indicates that bimolecular recombination is the exclusive recombination form and the suppression of monomolecular recombination.69 For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC, the n value very close to kT/q indicates that almost no other recombination occurs in the OSC except bimolecular recombination.70,71

Under the short-circuit condition, the charge carrier recombination exponential factor (β) should be 1 when bimolecular recombination does not occur in donor/acceptor blended films. In addition, the maximum number of charge carriers can be transported and collected by the electrode and produce the photocurrent, and there is some bimolecular recombination if the β value is smaller than 1.29,72 The photogenerated charge carrier recombination intensity can be determined by the JSC value dependence on the light intensity using the following equation:69,73JSC ∝ IβFig. 6b displays the plots of logJSCversus the log of light intensity (I), and the β values are 0.952, 0.958, and 0.934 for the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary OSCs, the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC and the PBDB-T:4TIC-based binary OSCs, respectively. The gradually increased β values indicate the reduced bimolecular recombination with the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC ternary films as the photoactive layer.74,75 For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based ternary OSC, another plausible reason for the deviation of the β values from unity can be understood in terms of the build-up of the space-charge in the device due to the unbalanced electron–hole mobility. For the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F and PBDB-T:4TIC-based binary OSCs, the build-up of space-charge in the device is due to the unbalanced electron–hole mobility. The results of the VOC and JSC dependence on light intensity indicate that weak monomolecular recombination and bimolecular recombination occur under open circuit and short circuit conditions in the optimized ternary OSCs.
Under maximum power point condition, all three OSCs exhibit different trends between FF and light intensity. High FF values of OSCs indicate efficient charge carrier transport and collection capability and avoid charge recombination. The PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC-based OSCs exhibited the highest FF value at different light intensities (from 100 mW cm−2 to 5 mW cm−2) compared to the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F and PBDB-T:4TIC-based OSCs (as shown in Fig. 6c), which indicates suppressed charge recombination and more efficient charge collection.35,74
3. Conclusion
In summary, ternary OSC performance parameters were optimized by regulating the ratio of IEICO-4F:4TIC, resulting in a wide energy level offset between the donor and the acceptor and reduced energy losses. A PCE of 11.63% is achieved in the optimized ternary PSCs with enhanced VOC and synergistically without sacrificing the JSC and FF values. Approximately 15% PCE improvement was achieved by employing the ternary strategy in comparison to the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary OSC with a PCE of 10.02%, which primarily benefits from the third component materials having enhanced LUMO energy levels, good compatibility and suppressed charge carrier recombination. Simultaneously, a synergistic improvement without sacrificing the JSC and FF values was achieved even though the absorption spectrum of the ternary photoactive layer did not match the AM 1.5G solar simulator spectrum. This work also provides guidance to select 4TIC as the third component material with good compatibility and shallow LUMO energy levels compared to those of the PBDB-T:IEICO-4F binary photoactive layer for obtaining highly efficient ternary PSCs.
4. Experimental methods
The chemical structures of PBDB-T, IEICO-4F and 4TIC and the energy levels of the OSCs are shown in Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), respectively.9,55 The OSC devices have an inverted configuration: ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:IEICO-4F:4TIC/MoO3/Ag. All average values with standard deviations were calculated from ten parallel devices. The charge carrier mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, and the hole-only and electron-only devices had the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Au and Al/photoactive layer/Al structures, respectively. The experimental details are shown in the ESI.†
