    , Accepted 18th November 2013First published on 19th November 2013AbstractA photoanode-driven photoelectrochemical system consisting of a WO3 photoanode under bias potential and Cu or Sn/SnOx as the cathode for the reduction of CO2 has been studied under visible light irradiation. The bias potentials typically required for the onset of oxygen evolution current at the photoanode were sufficient for the efficient reduction of CO2 at the metallic/composite counter electrodes. Using Cu as a cathode electrocatalyst, faradaic efficiencies of 67% for CH4 and 71.6% for all carbon-containing products were achieved. With Sn/SnOx, a combined faradaic efficiency (CO + HCOOH) of 44.3% was obtained at +0.8 V. The 2-electrode potential between the counter electrode and working electrode for the WO3 driven system was less than the lowest bias potential reported so far for conventional photocathode-driven systems. The results demonstrate for the first time that the intrinsically more stable photoanode-driven systems could accomplish the reduction of CO2 with higher efficiencies relative to the conventional photocathode-driven systems.
Introduction
Mankind is in urgent need of solutions to two major problems it is facing today, namely global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. Converting CO2 to fuels using a renewable energy source is an ideal and practical solution as these fuels can be used in existing internal combustion engines with minimal changes. The best available option is the photoelectrochemical (PEC) or photocatalytic method as it utilizes the largely available solar energy and water for the reduction of CO2 in a similar manner as photosynthesis.1–5 Thus the technology is called artificial photosynthesis or solar fuel production.
An ideal CO2 reduction photocatalyst should have its band positions suitable for reducing CO2 and oxidizing water simultaneously, while having a suitable band gap to absorb ample visible light. However, the efficiency of the photocatalytic materials is limited by the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers and/or the unfavourable band positions for the reduction of CO2 or oxidation of H2O. The PEC system with a bias voltage has the advantages of decreased charge recombination and supply of the additional energy needed for the reduction of CO2 or oxidation of H2O.6–8 It could be an energy-efficient system if the bias voltage is supplied by a solar cell in a PEC–PV tandem cell utilizing the remaining photons that have passed the photoelectrode unused.
The PEC system could have different configurations depending on which electrode would become the light-absorbing semiconductor photoelectrode, i.e. anode, cathode, or both. Considering their high conduction band energies suitable for the reduction of CO2, p-type photocathode-driven PEC systems have been widely studied with an O2-evolving anode catalyst in the dark. However, reduction of CO2 using the p-type semiconductors requires a large bias potential since their valence band potentials are not positive enough to oxidize water.9–12 Use of bare p-type photocatalysts as cathodes mostly results in high selectivity for H2 evolution and a small amount of 2-electron reduced products such as CO and HCOOH.9 In addition, most of the attempts have focussed on single crystals of p-GaP, p-CdTe, p-InP, and p-Si, or p-Cu2O/p-CuO, which are either expensive or unstable in aqueous solutions and/or toxic.10–13
On the other hand, many earth-abundant n-type oxide semiconductors are intrinsically stable in aqueous solutions and still active in visible light photocatalysis such as WO3, BiVO4 and Fe2O3. Using them as photoanodes, we can utilize metallic and composite electrocatalysts as cathodes, which are capable of reducing CO2 at high faradaic efficiencies especially to highly reduced products such as CH4 and C2H4.14–17 The system could be called the photoanode-driven PEC cell for CO2 reduction (Scheme 1). The O2 evolving ability of the n-type semiconductors by water oxidation under visible light has been improved greatly recently. They have their conduction bands (+0.1 to 0.3 V vs. RHE) just below the standard reduction potentials (−0.3 V to +0.2 V vs. RHE) of the CO2 reduction reactions (eqn (1)–(4)).18–20 This situation is similar to the difference between the O2 evolution potential and valence band positions of many p-type semiconductors such as Si (0.6 V), GaAs (0.25 V), InP (0.15 V).9,20 2CO2 + 12H+ + 12e− → C2H4 + 4H2O; E0 = 0.079 V vs. RHE(1) CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O; E0 = 0.169 V vs. RHE(2) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → CO + H2O ;E0 = −0.103 V vs. RHE(3) CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → HCOOH + H2O; E0 = −0.225 V vs. RHE(4)

In the PEC oxygen evolution studies, bias potentials are applied to the photoanode primarily to facilitate the reduction of H2O to H2 at the counter electrode (cathode) since the conduction band of most n-type photoanodes does not have sufficient energy to reduce H2O. As some of the CO2 reduction reactions require lower potentials (eqn (1) and (2)) than the H2O reduction (0.0 V vs. RHE), the reduction of CO2 instead of H2O at the counter electrode of the photoanode is possible if an appropriate CO2 reduction catalyst is used as the cathode. This effectively means that CO2 can be reduced at the counter electrode instead of H2O even at the onset potential of oxygen evolution current (around +0.5 V vs. RHE) for many common oxygen evolution photocatalysts such as WO3, Fe2O3, BiVO4, etc. As mentioned, the n-type oxide semiconductors are highly stable in aqueous media, exhibit low toxicity and are made of earth-abundant elements. The magnitude of the bias potentials (and hence the energy added internally or externally) that will be required for the reduction of CO2 using both n-type and p-type photocatalysts seems similar in scale. However, the photoanode-driven PEC CO2 reduction systems have received little attention in spite of their many potential advantages.21–23
In the photocathode-driven systems, the overall efficiency of CO2 reduction as well as the product selectivity depends on the photocathode itself. On the other hand, the overall efficiency of photoanode-driven systems depends on the two components, i.e. the photoanode and the CO2 reduction cathode electrocatalysts. Here in this report, we demonstrate the feasibility of a photoanode-driven PEC system for CO2 reduction at the counter electrode in a highly efficient way. We provide only a small bias voltage usually needed for the onset of the oxygen evolution at the photoanode site. Even though there were a few earlier reports of reducing CO2 at the counter electrode of photoanode-driven systems, extremely high bias potentials were employed (2.7 V vs. RHE for example).21–23
Since the objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of an efficient photoanode-driven PEC system, we employed well-known good materials for the semiconductor photoanode and metallic cathodes. Thus, n-WO3 was selected as a photoanode because of its high activity and stability as demonstrated in PEC water splitting reactions.25,26 Among CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, some of the most active are copper and tin, which are coincidentally very abundant elements as well. With its high hydrogen overvoltage and negligible CO adsorption, Sn favours the formation of CO and HCOOH. Copper is the best known for producing high calorific-value fuels such as CH4/C2H4 due to its medium hydrogen overvoltage and weak CO adsorption leading to breaking of C–O bonds.14 Tin-containing amorphous tin oxide (Sn/SnOx) is highly selective towards CO and HCOOH compared to pure Sn.16
Results and discussion
Traditionally, CO2 reduction has been studied in batch reactors utilizing a solution saturated with CO2 before the start of the reaction. But here activity measurements for long durations were not possible due to the low solubility of CO2 (20 mM at 25 °C).24 In a continuous flow system, on the other hand, the amount of products was too low for detection using a typical TC detector of gas chromatograph (GC). These factors led us to the closed-circulation system, in which the CO2 gets continuously dissolved throughout the reaction and the evolved gaseous products accumulate inside the system leading to high concentrations suitable for detection by GC at as low as 0.2 mA current (Fig. S1†). Product detection at a small current was in turn helpful for studying the small bias potentials where the generated current is usually very low.
The WO3 films were prepared by a polymer assisted deposition method by multiple cycles of precursor coating and annealing as per our earlier reported method.25,26 Optimization of the number of coatings of WO3 showed that six WO3 coatings provided the highest photocurrent (Fig. 1a). The crystalline phase of WO3 was found to be monoclinic (JCPDS No. 431035) by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1b). The diffuse reflectance UV-vis showed an absorption onset of around 470 nm and the Tauc plot shows a band gap of 2.55 eV (Fig. 1c and inset). The flat band potential of the WO3 was found to be +0.27 V vs. RHE (Fig. 1d). From the SEM images, films were found to be of uniform 300 nm thickness containing WO3 crystallites of approximately 100 nm (Fig. S2†).

A ‘glassy carbon type’ copper electrode (0.071 cm2) surrounded by poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) was used as the cathode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the WO3–Cu system measured before the CO2 reduction reaction is given in Fig. 2a. Using the WO3–Cu system, CO2 reduction products such as CH4, C2H4, and CO were obtained. In addition, H2 was also obtained as a result of the water splitting reaction. The quantities of CH4, C2H4, CO and H2 evolved at different bias potentials are given in Fig. 2b–d and S3a† respectively. The results of the reaction carried out under potentiostatic conditions at +0.55, +0.65 and +0.75 V showed that CH4 was the major CO2 reduction product followed by C2H4 and CO. The amounts of all the products increased with increasing bias potentials.

Amounts of products evolved vs. time: (b) CH4, (c) C2H4 and (d) CO for the WO3–Cu system at different bias potentials. 
The calculated faradaic efficiencies (FE) for the various products at different bias potentials are presented in Table 1. In the WO3–Cu system, as the potential increased from +0.55 V to +0.75 V, FE for CH4 increased from 42.3% to 67.0%. The FEs for CO and C2H4 were 5.1 and 4.0% respectively at +0.55 V, which came down to 0.6 and 2.7% at +0.75 V. The FE of H2 however showed a decrease from 32.8% to 17.3% when moving from +0.55 V to +0.65 V and then increased to 28.6% at +0.75 V. The trends in the faradaic efficiencies are in agreement with the earlier reports.27,28 At +0.65 V, a maximum total faradaic efficiency of 71.6% for carbon-containing products was attained. The faradaic efficiency of 67% for CH4 in the present work is among the highest in the literature for electrochemical CO2 reduction and the highest ever in PEC CO2 reduction (Table 2).23,29

We also studied the WO3–Sn/SnOx system, where the Sn-containing amorphous SnOx was reported to be more efficient in reducing CO2 compared to pure Sn.16 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the electrode showed Sn in Sn0 (484.0 eV) and Sn4+/2+ (486.2 eV) states with peak areas of 23% and 77% (Fig. S4b†). The XRD pattern showed Sn peaks whereas no peaks for tin oxides were found because they were amorphous (Fig. S4c†). With SEM and EDAX mapping, Sn containing films on Ti substrate were observed and the oxygen signal on the films was higher than on Ti (Fig. S5 & S6†). These results confirm the formation of a discontinuous film of Sn and amorphous tin oxide (SnOx). The amounts of Sn, Ti, and oxygen were found to be 38.8, 37.6 and 23.5 atom%, respectively, by EDAX analysis. The cyclic voltammetry of the Sn/SnOx electrocatalyst under CO2 purging showed higher reduction currents compared to Sn or Ti foil signifying a higher CO2 reduction activity (Fig. S4d†).
The linear sweep voltammetry of the WO3–Sn/SnOx system in 0.5 M KCl before the reaction is given in Fig. 3a. The amounts of CO2 reduction products and their FE values are listed in Fig. 3b and Table 1, respectively. The products of the PEC CO2/H2O reduction carried out at +0.6, +0.7 and +0.8 V were CO, HCOOH and H2 (Table 1) and the quantities of CO and H2 improved with increased bias potentials (Fig. 3b and S3b†). The FE for CO increased from 8.4% to 17.5% upon increasing the applied potential from +0.5 to +0.7 V, whereas that of HCOOH remained unchanged at around 27%. However, the FE of H2 decreased from 52.4% to 43.5% upon increase of potential from +0.5 to +0.7 V.

Two types of control reactions were carried out using similar applied bias potentials either without irradiation in a CO2 purged reactor or in an Ar purged reactor under irradiation. Both blank reactions did not yield any CO2 reduction products. This confirms that the observed products were only from the reduction of the supplied CO2, and their formation was not possible with only bias potential in the absence of photoelectrons generated at the WO3 photoanode by harvesting visible light.
Let us now compare the current n-type photoanode-driven PEC CO2 reduction system with the other reported systems. Table 2 lists the lowest reported bias potentials and the faradaic efficiencies for the various PEC CO2 reduction systems. The only report of CO2 reduction using a visible light active photoanode is that of Peng et al. who used an N-doped TiO2–Cu system with a faradaic efficiency of 7.83% for CH4 at 2.65 V.23 Compared to this, our system utilized a staggering 2.1 V lower potential, yet showed a 5.4 times higher faradaic efficiency for CH4. Among common p-type photocathode-driven PEC systems, +0.55 V utilized in our system is comparable in scale (and energy requirement) to −0.52 V in the case of Cu/p-Si12 with a faradaic efficiency of 25% for CH4 compared to 42.3% in our result. The lowest bias potential reported without metal or molecular co-catalysts is for a p-Cu2O/CuO composite utilizing +0.07 V vs. RHE with a faradaic efficiency for methanol of 95%.13 However, direct comparison of the 3-electrode potentials of the photoanode-driven systems with those of photocathode systems in Table 2 is not appropriate.
The bias potentials for both n-type anode and p-type cathode driven devices are supplied from external power sources. The extent of such bias potential is determined by the potential difference between the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE) denoted as EWE − ECE. Hence it is more relevant to practice if we compare the EWE − ECE values of n-type and p-type driven systems to assess their relative energy requirements. Since EWE − ECE data for the p-Cu2O/CuO system (the best photocathode-driven PEC system reported in the literature so far) were not available, we prepared a similar Cu2O/CuO composite as a reference photocathode-driven system according to the reported procedure by oxidation of copper foil.13,30 The X-ray diffraction and photocurrent data of the Cu2O/CuO composite are given in Fig. S8a and S8b,† respectively. Cu2O and CuO were formed on the Cu foil. The photocurrent onset potential of the prepared Cu2O/CuO composite was also similar to that of p-Cu2O/CuO in the literature.13 The EWE − ECE values in 3-electrode systems were measured using a potentiostat capable of simultaneously measuring both EWE and ECEvs. reference electrode. The EWE − ECE data were monitored together with currents for 600 seconds, whose values were stabilized within 60 seconds and stayed steady for the remaining period in the WO3-driven systems (Fig. 4a–c). The data also show anodic responses (downward spikes) to light on-and-off cycles. The Cu2O/CuO–Pt system showed cathodic responses in Fig. 4d, but their stability was not as good. The EWE − ECE and ECE values in the 3-electrode configuration for the WO3–Cu and Cu2O/CuO–Pt systems are listed in Table 3.

The EWE − ECE of the Cu2O/CuO driven system at +0.07 V is 0.79 V higher than WO3 driven system at +0.55 V. Even at +0.75 V, the EWE − ECE of the WO3 driven system is lower than the Cu2O/CuO driven system by 0.03 V. At +0.27 V (Fig. 4d), EWE − ECE of the Cu2O/CuO–Pt system is 1.65 V which is higher than that of the WO3–Cu system at +0.55 and +0.65 V. These values suggest that the n-WO3-driven systems are similar or more energy efficient compared to the reported best p-type photocathode-driven PEC systems.
The potential of the CE in an electrochemical cell under bias varies during the reaction. In order to determine the stability of CE potential, the EWE − ECE of the WO3–Cu system at +0.55 V was monitored for about 3 h (Fig. 5). In agreement with the initial indication in Fig. 4a, the EWE − ECE value of the WO3–Cu system remained stable during the 3 h period. The CE potentials (Table 3), CE potential stability data (Fig. 5) and the products obtained show that the potentials at the cathode of the WO3-driven system are suitable and stable enough for sustained reduction of CO2.

Conclusions
A PEC system using WO3 as photoanode and Cu or Sn/SnOx as a cathode electrocatalyst has been shown to achieve reduction of CO2 at low bias potentials under visible light irradiation. A highly calorific product such as methane requiring 8 electrons was obtained at a faradaic efficiency of 67%, whereas a total CO2 reduction faradaic efficiency of 71.6% was achieved. This work demonstrates for the first time the reduction of CO2 at the counter electrode of a n-type photoanode even at the typical onset potential of oxygen evolution current. The two-electrode bias potentials between the anode and the cathode of the WO3-driven system were similar or less than that of the best photocathode-driven systems. Thus, it has been demonstrated that judicious combination of a light absorbing photoanode and a cathode electrocatalyst can make an efficient CO2 reduction system with high selectivity toward desired fuels. Compared with the common p-type cathode-driven system, the superior stability of the photoanodes as well as the versatility attained by using a variety of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts with different product selectivities at high faradaic efficiency is promising. In addition to the highly active photoanode and efficient electrocathodes, the optimization of reaction conditions to allow a high CO2 solubility seems to lead to these results. We believe that with the improved new photoanodes, CO2 reduction electrocatalysts, and co-catalysts at both electrodes, the bias potentials can be brought down further or possibly a bias-free system could be achieved, which is the goal of the worldwide research programs on artificial photosynthesis or solar fuel production.
