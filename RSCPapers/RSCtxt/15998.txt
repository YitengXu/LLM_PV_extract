    , Accepted 21st September 2021First published on 21st September 2021AbstractTwo indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based small-molecule analogues (IDBT and IDBT-Cl) are designed as donor materials for organic solar cells. Relative to the amorphous IDBT-Cl, the IDBT with strong crystallinity shows overall better photovoltaic performance when blended with a Y6 acceptor. The results demonstrate the great potential of IDT units in designing efficient small-molecule donors.
Photovoltaic material innovation is one of the most effective strategies to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs).1–5 As compared to their polymeric counterparts with unmanageable molecular weight distributions, small-molecule photovoltaic materials have attractive characteristics of well-defined chemical structures, high purity, and outstanding batch-to-batch repeatability.6–11 Currently, the PCEs of all small-molecule-based OSCs lags behind the devices based on polymer donors.12–15 Thus, it is critical to rationally construct and optimize molecular architectures to develop highly efficient small-molecule donor materials. Currently, A–D–A (A = electron accepting unit, D = electron donating unit) π-conjugated backbones are widely recognized as a kind of classic architecture to design high-performance small-molecule donor materials.9,16 On the premise of this molecular framework, the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of photovoltaic materials can be manipulated via incorporation of specific D- and A-units. Generally, the incorporated D-units should meet the requirement of a large and coplanar conjugated architecture. For instance, due to its symmetric and planar conjugated structure, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit is widely used as a central core in designing small-molecule donors.9,17 Additionally, extending the conjugated length of BDT units to reach its derivative dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) unit favors improvements in the photovoltaic performance of the resulting small-molecule donor.18
During the past few years, the indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit has shown great potential in designing fused-ring acceptors that significantly elevated the PCEs of OSCs.19–21 The IDT unit can form effective interchain π–π overlap and enhance the rigidity and conjugation of organic semiconductors that are favorable for photovoltaic materials. In spite of the encouraging achievements in n-type semiconductors, the potential of the IDT unit in designing high-performance p-type semiconductors is still under exploitation. In particular, the PCEs of IDT-based small-molecule donors are still restricted to below 10%,22–25 leaving the challenge of utilizing the features of IDT moieties in molecular architectures of small-molecule donors towards high photovoltaic performance.
In this work, we employed IDT as the central D-unit, a thienyl-substituted BDT unit as the conjugated extension, and rhodanine as an end-capped A-group to develop a small-molecule donor IDBT (Scheme 1). By using Y6 (Scheme S1 in the ESI†) as an acceptor to blend with IDBT, a PCE of 11.04% was achieved in the device, which is the highest efficiency for IDT-based small-molecule donors. Considering the fact that the engineering of chlorination on the BDT unit is a widely used approach to optimize photovoltaic properties,26,27 a chlorine-substituted analogue IDBT-Cl (Scheme 1) was developed. Conversely, we noted that the chlorination on the thienyl-substituted BDT unit strategy in this case led to different crystallinity properties, resulting in much poorer photovoltaic performance.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routines and chemical structures of IDBT and IDBT-Cl. 
The synthetic routes toward IDBT and IDBT-Cl are shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic details and characterization are described in the ESI.† The intermediate compound 5a/b was synthesized using a Stille coupling reaction between compound 3a/b and compound 4 with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The target molecules of IDBT and IDBT-Cl were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation of compound 5a and 5b with rhodanine (Scheme 1), respectively. The two molecules show good solubility in common organic solvents. IDBT and IDBT-Cl exhibit good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 338 °C and 406 °C, respectively, as revealed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement (as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Fig. S2 in the ESI† displays the absorption spectra of IDBT and IDBT-Cl in a dilute chloroform solution, in which IDBT-Cl shows a slightly higher extinction coefficient (1.14 × 105 M−1 cm−1) than that of IDBT (1.04 × 105 M−1 cm−1), which is consistent with that observed in other chlorine-substituted small-molecule systems.28 Additionally, a slightly higher maximum absorption coefficient of 6.67 × 104 cm−1 was observed in the IDBT-Cl film compared with that of the IDBT film (5.85 × 104 cm−1, Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Similar absorption spectra are observed for the IDBT and IDBT-Cl pristine thin films, covering the wavelength of 450–650 nm, with clear shoulder peaks at 544 and 549 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a). The absorption spectra of IDBT and IDBT-Cl are complementary with the Y6 acceptor (Fig. 1a). Then cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to determine the electronic energy levels of IDBT and IDBT-Cl (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO levels of IDBT were calculated to be −5.48 and −3.52 eV respectively, while both a slightly lower HOMO level of −5.54 eV and a LUMO level of −3.54 eV were determined for the chlorine-substituted IDBT-Cl. The similar absorption spectra and energy levels of IDBT-Cl to that of IDBT could be ascribed to the synergistic effect of chlorination and the twisted main-chain. Apparently, IDBT and IDBT-Cl as donor material match with the Y6 acceptor in terms of absorption and energy levels.

Then differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed to investigate the crystallinity of IDBT and IDBT-Cl (as shown in Fig. 2a). The first endothermic peak of IDBT at 86 °C could be assigned to the secondary crystalline phase transition, and a melting temperature of 177 °C was observed. During the cooling process, the first peak of IDBT at 157 °C was attributed to the crystalline point, and the second peak at 73 °C was attributed to a second phase transition. In contrast, IDBT-Cl exhibits an endothermic peak at 100 °C without any distinct peak during the cooling process. Therefore, IDBT is regarded as a highly crystalline small molecule, while IDBT-Cl is an amorphous molecule. To clarify the crystallinity difference between the two molecules for the aspect of molecular conformation, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed (as shown in Fig. 2b). Due to the large atomic radius resulting from the chlorine substitution, the dihedral angle between the BDT unit and the conjugated thiophene side chain of IDBT-Cl (56.44°) is larger that of IDBT (55.73°). On the other hand, a larger dihedral angle of 6.72° between the BDT and IDT units of IDBT-Cl was determined as compared to that of 1.07° for IDBT. The smaller dihedral angles observed in the molecular structure of IDBT resulted in a better conjugated planarity as compared to IDBT-Cl (Fig. 2b), which could contribute to its stronger crystallinity.

Benefitting from the matched energy levels and complementary absorption with the Y6 acceptor, the IDBT:Y6-based device yielded an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.861 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.22 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 63.7%, enabling a notable PCE of 11.04% (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). To the best of our knowledge, this could be the highest efficiency recorded for IDT-based small-molecule donors,23 demonstrating the great potential of IDT units in designing efficient small-molecule donor materials. It should be noted that the thermal annealing treatment at 80 °C for the IDBT:Y6-based device led to a moderate PCE of 10.41% (Table S2 and Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Relative to the devices based on IDBT, the IDBT-Cl-based devices exhibited a slightly higher Voc of 0.87 V, with a much lower Jsc of 7.34 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.9%, resulting in a significantly lower PCE of 3.12%. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements reveal that the IDBT-based device showed an obviously higher photon-to-current response in the wavelength range of 400 to 850 nm than that of the device based on IDBT-Cl (Fig. 3b), corresponding to the higher Jsc value obtained in the device. The Jsc value integrated from the EQE spectrum is calculated to be 19.60 mA cm−2 for the IDBT:Y6-based device and 7.04 mA cm−2 for the IDBT-Cl:Y6-based device, which are consistent with the values obtained from the J–V measurement within a 5% error.
To clarify the factors correlating to the different photovoltaic performance between the two devices, we investigated the charge-carrier mobility and dynamics in the devices using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method, as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The pristine IDBT film exhibited a higher hole mobility (μh) of 1.71 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 than that of IDBT-Cl with a μh of 9.88 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The IDBT:Y6-based device showed a μh of 1.01 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron (μe) mobility of 8.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.16), both of which are higher than that of the IDBT-Cl:Y6-based device with a μh of 6.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an μe of 4.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μh/μe ratio of 1.50 (Fig. 4a). Relative to the devices based on IDBT-Cl:Y6, the higher charge mobilities and more balanced μh/μe of the IDBT:Y6-based devices are in favor of realizing higher Jsc and FF values. Meanwhile, a substantially different exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) was observed in the two devices, which was fitted using the curves of photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective applied voltage (Veff).29 As displayed in Fig. 4b, the Pdiss (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat, where Jsat represents the value at which Jph reached saturation at a large reverse bias, detailed descriptions are provided in the ESI†) of the IDBT-based device was fitted to be 92.9%, while a lower Pdiss of 77.8% was obtained in the device based on IDBT-Cl, implying a more efficient charge dissociation in the IDBT-based devices that have higher Jsc values.

We then investigated the charge recombination kinetics in the two devices by measuring the dependence of Jsc and Voc as a function of the light intensity (Plight), respectively. The degree of bimolecular recombination in an OSC can be evaluated by the exponential factor α (Jsc ∝ Pαlight), where α should be equal to 1 if the bimolecular recombination is negligible.30 As shown in Fig. 4c, a slightly higher α of 0.957 was fitted for the IDBT-based device compared to that of the device based on IDBT-Cl (α = 0.920), suggesting a lower extent of bimolecular recombination in the IDBT-based device. Afterwards, we plotted the slope of Vocversus the logarithmic dependence of Plight (Voc ∝ lnPlight) to determine the trap-assisted recombination in the two devices.31 In an OSC, a slope of 1 × kT/q (k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and q is the elementary charge) indicates the dominating free carrier bimolecular recombination, while a slope of 2 × kT/q implies trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination in the device.32,33 As shown in Fig. 4d, a similar slope of 1.18 kT/q and 1.13 kT/q was fitted for the IDBT:Y6 and IDBT-Cl:Y6-based devices, respectively, implying that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism in the two devices. As a result, the higher charge-carrier mobilities, the more efficient charge dissociation, and the weaker bimolecular recombination in the IDBT:Y6-based device effectively delivered higher Jsc and FF values compared to the IDBT-Cl:Y6-based device.
The molecular packing and morphology of the active layer are critical in determining the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. To gain in-depth knowledge of the molecular packing of the active layer, we performed grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S7 in the ESI,† strong lamellar packing diffraction (100) peaks at qxy = 0.29 Å−1 were observed in the in-plane (IP) direction for the IDBT and IDBT-Cl neat films, suggesting their ordered packing. Both the IDBT:Y6 and IDBT-Cl:Y6 blend films show a preferential face-on orientation with clear π–π stacking (010) peaks at qz = 1.52 Å−1 (d-spacing = 4.13 Å) and qz = 1.66 Å−1 (d-spacing = 3.79 Å) along the out-of-plane (OOP) directions, respectively. It can be concluded that IDBT and IDBT-Cl show similar molecular packing properties with ordered face-on orientation, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in an OSC. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed to investigate the morphology of the two blend films. As shown in Fig. 5, clear phase separations were observed in the IDBT:Y6 (1:1, w/w) and IDBT-Cl:Y6 (1:1, w/w) blend films, while the IDBT-Cl:Y6 blend showed obviously oversized aggregation with larger domain sizes compared to that of the IDBT:Y6 blend film. We speculate that the stronger crystallinity of IDBT compared to IDBT-Cl favors restriction of the over self-assembly of Y6 molecules towards a more uniform phase separation. Apparently, such an appropriate phase separation realized in the IDBT:Y6 blend is in favor of efficient charge dissociation and transport, enabling better photovoltaic performance.

In summary, we applied IDT units to design two analogue donor materials IDBT and IDBT-Cl for OSCs. IDBT and IDBT-Cl possess similar absorption spectra and energy levels, while having obviously different crystallinity properties that results in a significantly different photovoltaic performance. In comparison with IDBT-Cl, the stronger crystallinity of IDBT is beneficial to restrict the over self-assembly of the Y6 acceptor with strong crystallinity to form a more uniform phase separation, facilitating a more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation, and weaker bimolecular recombination in the IDBT:Y6-based device. As a result, the IDBT:Y6-based device achieved a notable PCE of 11.04%, with a Jsc of 20.22 mA cm−2 and an FF of 63.7%, while a much lower PCE of 3.12% along with a Jsc of 7.34 mA cm−2 and an FF of 48.9% was shown in the device based on IDBT-Cl:Y6. The results demonstrate the potential of IDT units in designing small-molecule donor materials for efficient all-small-molecule OSCs. Our study also demonstrates a feasible approach to achieve a well-developed morphology for all-small-molecule systems towards enhanced efficiency via crystallinity property manipulation of the donor materials.
