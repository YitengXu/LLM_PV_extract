    , Accepted 13th July 2011First published on 8th August 2011AbstractA rechargeable lithium/iodine battery using commercial organic electrolyte, composed of iodine–conductive carbon black composite as cathode and metallic lithium as anode, is first proposed in this work. The fabricated lithium/iodine battery presents superior high-rate capability and good reversibility based on the contributions from both the capacitive characteristics of conductive carbon black, and the redox capacity of active iodine in the composite.

Broader context
Traditional electrochemical batteries are facing the huge challenges for high power density to match the requirement of the electric tools, and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Compared to traditional secondary batteries, the ultra battery, which combines the supercapacitor and battery in a single unit cell, has the advantage of adjustable power density and energy density. Meanwhile, active materials in supercapacitors and batteries are usually made of insoluble solid compounds, elements or alloys in electrolytes. It is difficult to use soluble active materials in electrolytes for rechargeable energy conversion and storage. In this work, the soluble active iodine and LiI are fixed on porous carbon materials based on strong adsorption of micropores or mesopores. Correspondingly, the hybrid battery system is fabricated by the combination of both contributions of the capacitive characteristic of porous carbon substrate and redox capacity of active iodine. In the fabricated lithium/iodine secondary battery, high power density and energy density can be realized with good reversibility. This strategy show possible approaches for future batteries with soluble active materials, not limited by heavy metals, metallic compounds, or oxides.

As a key technology for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), high power rechargeable batteries have attracted increasing attention because of the modern mobile life and growing worldwide crisis in energy.1 Traditional rechargeable batteries are based on a redox couple of a chemical element and compounds in aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes.2 To achieve high power performance, these batteries can be usually updated with nanostructured electrode materials, as well as new engineering constructions based on fast kinetic reaction and good electrical conductivity.3–5 The ultra battery, which combines an asymmetric supercapacitor and a lead–acid battery in single unit cells, has been recently developed to address the high power requirement for HEV application.6,7 Actually, this concept of the ultra battery can be expanded to many rechargeable battery systems.
The primary lithium/iodine battery, with high reliability and low self-discharge rate, is an important power source for implantable cardiac pacemaker applications.8,9 The low rate capability of the lithium/iodine battery is related to the large internal impedance due to the gradual formation of a lithium iodide (LiI) layer with a poor lithium ion conductivity during discharging. Recently, an all solid-state rechargeable lithium/iodine battery is presented, which shows a realizable rechargeability at a low current density (about 20 μA cm−2).10 It is well known that the iodine/triiodide redox pair has a rapid electrochemical reaction with good reversibility as a charge carrier in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and supercapacitors.11–13 Therefore, a rechargeable lithium/iodine battery of reliable rate capability may be fabricated in liquid electrolyte with a fast ion diffusion. Moreover, active iodine can be readily loaded into the pores of porous carbon, similar to sulfur-porous carbon composites.2,14–17 Correspondingly, the electrochemical reaction is constrained inside the pores of porous carbon due to strong adsorption, ensuring good cycle stability, reversibility, and utilization by decreasing the solubility of active iodine and lithium iodide in the organic electrolyte. In particular, the capacitive characteristic of porous carbon and redox capacity of active iodine would be integrated to provide high energy and power performance for the rechargeable lithium/iodine battery.
Herein, the iodine-conductive carbon black (CCB) composite is prepared via a thermal treatment method. The mass fraction of active iodine in the composite is 24%, measured by thermo-gravimetryvia a thermal treatment at 800 °C for 1h with heating rate 5 °C min−1 in a tubular furnace under argon atmosphere. The cathode plate (∼3 mg, 0.5 cm2) is prepared by mixing of the iodine–CCB composite, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and acetylene-black (AB) with the weight ratio of 80:10:10. The rechargeable lithium/iodine battery is assembled with the iodine–CCB composite as cathode, metallic lithium as anode, a microporous polypropylene membrane (Celgard 2400) as separator and 1 M LiPF6/EC + EMC + DMC (1:1:1, v/v/v) as electrolyte.

        TEM images and elemental analysis of the as-prepared iodine–CCB composite are shown in Fig. 1. A developed porous structure of the composite is observed in the TEM image, which is beneficial for electrolyte penetration throughout the porous structure. The presence of iodine in the composite is confirmed in the EDX spectrum (Fig. 1c), as well as pore size distribution analysis (Fig. S1 of the ESI†). Moreover, the composition change of carbon and iodine elements is also detected across a selected area of the composite by local chemical analysis performed by STEM-EDX (Fig. 1b and 1d), indicating a highly dispersed iodine in the composite. The intensity of iodine element is much lower than the low fraction of iodine (2.9% mol) and the sublimation loss of iodine in a vacuum chamber.

Fig. 2 shows the initial two discharge and charge profiles of cell voltage vs. the lithium content in the iodine–CCB composite after deducting the capacity contribution of the blank CCB electrode (Fig. S2 and Fig. S3 of the ESI‡). It is shown that there are two voltage plateaus with a slope in the initial discharge process. The voltage plateaus are attributed to the redox reaction of active iodine, while the slope in the discharge end below 2.4 V is mainly related to the capacitive contribution of pure CCB. In addition, a large irreversible charge capacity at 3.7 V, caused by the oxidation of the tri-iodide ion, indicating the presence of the shuttle reaction of highly dissolved lithium triiodide in organic electrolyte, similar to that of sulfur cathode.18 It means that the cell has a low efficiency of 73% and 80% in the initial two cycles. In the case of supercapacitor and lithium ion battery with insoluble active material, the efficiency is usually close to 100%.19

To gain insight into electrochemical reaction mechanism, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the iodine–CCB composite are measured and illustrated in Fig. 3. Clearly, two pairs of electrochemical redox peaks with good reversibility, and a wide horizontal region of obvious capacitive characteristic are observed for the as-prepared composite. The electrode reactions are described in the following:20

The redox peak potentials of LiI3/LiI redox pair occur at low potentials of 3.02 and 2.87 V, respectively, while the other I2/LiI3 redox pair appears at high potentials of 3.38 and 3.33 V. The almost identical integral area of redox peaks impliess a good reversibility for two pairs of redox reactions. The linear relationship of peak currents of LiI3/LiI redox and the square root of scan rates (the inset of Fig. S4 of the ESI‡), demonstrates that the oxidation reaction of the LiI3/LiI redox pair is diffusion-controlled, as well as the reduction reaction.
The redox current of I2/LiI3 redox pair of single electron transfer reaction at high potentials is weak, compared with that of LiI3/LiI redox pair with 2 electron transfer reaction at low potentials. Simultaneously, a shoulder peak, close to the reduction of the tri-iodide ion, can be observed from the CVs at higher scan rates of 2 and 5 mV s−1 (Fig. S4 of the ESI‡). The shoulder peak can be ascribed to the reduction of absorbed tri-iodide ion, which is much more negative than the reduction potential of the dissolved tri-iodide ion.21 Moreover, the reduction current of the absorbed ion is directly proportional to the v value of the scan rates, rather than v1/2. Therefore, with increasing the scan rate, the reduction current of the tri-iodide ion increases more rapidly, compared with the case of the reduction of iodine. The weak redox peaks of the I2/LiI3 redox pair are related to the short charge/discharge plateau at 3.3 V, as shown in Fig. 2. The redox potentials is more negative than that of the previous report,20 attributed to the redox reaction of absorbed iodine.21 The charge plateau at 3.7 V in Fig. 2 is related to the generation of dissolved iodine, in agreement with the redox potential in reaction (4).

Fig. 4 presents the cycle performance of the lithium/iodine battery with various charge–discharge rates. In the case of relatively low charge/discharge rate (2 C, 101 mA g−1), the charge discharge efficiency is obviously low (∼80%) and gradually increases to over 92% after 10 cycles due to the slow penetration of the electrolyte. Moreover, active iodine and LiI are partially dissolved in the organic electrolyte, resulting in a capacity loss of about 50 mAh g−1 in the initial 10 cycles. In the following cycles of 5 C (253 mA g−1), 10 C (506 mA g−1), 20 C (1012 mA g−1) and 50 C (2532 mA g−1) rates, almost no obvious capacity loss is observed. It can be also seen that the rechargeable lithium/iodine prototype battery exhibits an excellent high-rate performance. In particular, at 100 C discharge–charge rate, the capacity retention is 71.4% after 1000 cycles (Fig. S5 of the ESI‡), indicating excellent cycle stability. It means that the electrochemical reaction process of active iodine or LiI can be constrained inside the pores of the CCB substrate by strong absorption, contributing to the good cycle stability. This strategy is widely adapted in sulfur–porous carbon composites for Li/S batteries.2,13–16

Fig. 5 shows the scheme of the discharge process of the iodine–CCB composite, including the electrochemical reduction and capacitive discharge. In particular, the movement of absorbed PF6− ions is involved in the latter process of the initial discharge stage and the subsequent adsorption of Li+ ions within the Helmholtz layer from the electrolye.22 The enrichment of Li+ ions on the surface of the CCB substrate, caused by the capacitive discharge, can accelerate the kinetics of iodine reduction and act a buffer of high current density for the relatively slow electrochemical reaction of active iodine. Therefore, the fabricated lithium/iodine battery presents a superior high-rate capability based on both contributions of the capacitive characteristic of conductive carbon black, and of the redox capacity of active iodine in the composite.

In summary, we fabricate the iodine-conductive carbon black (CCB) composite by integrating the capacitive characteristics of the CCB substrate and the redox capacity contribution of active iodine. The fabricated prototypical battery exhibits a high discharge voltage plateau, excellent cycle performance, and high rate capability. The electrochemical reaction process of active iodine or LiI can be constrained inside the pores of CCB substrate by strong absorption, leading to good cycle stability. The superior high rate capability is attributed to the combination on both contributions of the capacitive characteristic of CCB substrate and redox capacity of active iodine in the composite. The average specific energy density and power density of the composite reach to 91.4 Wh kg−1 and 11.9 kW kg−1 with an average discharge voltage of 2.9 V, based on the cathode mass. Compared to supercapacitors, the lithium/iodine battery has an approximate power density, but a larger energy density.2,23–25 The fixation of active iodine on CCB substrate is the key to the success of the rechargeable lithium/iodine battery using the traditional organic electrolyte. Further exploration, focusing on the composite cathode with high loading of active iodine in microporous carbon, is necessary to meet the practical application of HEVs in the future.
