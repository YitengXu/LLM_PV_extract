    , Accepted 5th February 2014First published on 14th February 2014AbstractWe developed a facile way to enhance electron injection efficiency in CdSe based quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) by introducing a potential-tuning interlayer composed of ternary CdS1−xSex quantum dots (QDs) between TiO2 film and CdSe QDs. A suitable band structure for electron injection was obtained when the composition of Se was 0.43 in the CdS1−xSex interlayer. The TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs achieved a photocurrent density 17.8% higher than conventional TiO2/CdS/CdSe QDSCs. The enhanced performance is owing to the tuned energetic driving force simultaneously adequate for both exciton dissociation at CdS1−xSex/CdSe interface and electron injection at TiO2/CdS1−xSex interface. The electron injection also benefited probably from reducing the lattice mismatch between TiO2 film and CdSe QDs by inserting a crystalline CdS1−xSex interlayer. Our findings indicate that introducing a ternary crystalline potential-tuning interlayer with specifically designed band alignment is a promising strategy to enable efficient electron injection in QDSCs.
1. Introduction
QDs sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have been widely investigated in past few years. Compared with traditional dyes, semiconductor QDs (QDs) possess a high molar extinction coefficient1,2 and size tunable optical absorptions,3 making them a promising candidate for novel light harvesters. Moreover, QDs may open up new ways to utilize hot electrons4 or generate multiple charge carriers with a single photon,5,6 to break up the Shockley–Queisser limit (32%) and improve efficiencies. However, the power conversion efficiencies reported for QDSCs are still much lower than the dye sensitized solar cells (>10%), which attributes to the relatively low electron injection rate and high charge recombination in QDSCs.7,8
To improve the performance of QDSCs, introducing an interlayer between the metal oxide electrode and quantum dot sensitizers has been developed in recent years. For example, semiconducting CdS was used as an interlayer to form a TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode. By changing the growth cycle/crystal size of the interlayer, the band structure was tuned and the energy conversion efficiency of the cell was improved.9 Similar methods were reported in ZnO/CdS/CdSe and TiO2/PbS/CdS photoanodes, in which the band structures of QDs were modified and the electron injection was expected to be maximized with reduced recombination.10,11 In addition, interlayers with matched lattice parameters could increase the loading quality of QDs and enhance optical absorption,12 while some interlayers having favorable band structures benefited from electrons injection from QDs to TiO2 nanoparticles.13,14 Herein the band alignments by the introduced interlayer, especially at the new generated interfaces on its both sides, are crucial for the electron injection efficiency, charge recombination, and the performance of QDSCs. However, there are rarely any studies demonstrating how the band alignments at both interfaces of the interlayer affect the performance of QDSCs.
Using a ternary crystalline potential-tuning interlayer is an efficient way to optimal band alignments and has been successfully applied in many optoelectronic devices, such as light emitting diode (LEDs)15,16 and laser diode (LDs),17,18 but it is still rarely reported in QDSCs. By modulating the constituent stoichiometries of a ternary QDs interlayer, the potential of the conduction band can be changed more easily than that of a binary QDs interlayer, so that the band offset at both interfaces can be finely adjusted. In addition, homogenous ternary QDs may have fewer defects than doped QDs in which more trap states could increase the non-radioactive recombination and demonstrate a relatively low FF (<50%).19–21 Therefore, homogenous ternary QDs are promising candidates for a potential-tuning interlayer to improve QDSCs performance.
In this work, we employed a surface ion transfer method to synthesize ternary alloy CdS1−xSex (0 < x < 1) QDs as an interlayer in CdSe QDs sensitized solar cells. We controllably changed the band offset at the interfaces of TiO2/CdS1−xSex and CdS1−xSex/CdSe by modulating the constituent stoichiometries of the CdS1−xSex QDs interlayer, so that the electrons injection was tuned. Besides, the TiO2/CdS1−xSex and CdS1−xSex/CdSe interfaces possessed less lattice mismatch than TiO2/CdSe interface, which facilitated the deposition of CdSe QDs and electron injection. Compared with a conventional binary CdS QDs interlayer, the developed CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs interlayer enabled 15% higher electron injection efficiency and 17.8% larger photocurrent density, and the carrier lifetime was also increased by 58% in corresponding QDSCs. The improved performance was attributed to the tuned energetic driving force simultaneously adequate for both the exciton dissociation at the CdS1−xSex/CdSe interface and the electron injection at the TiO2/CdS1−xSex interface. Hence introducing a ternary crystalline potential-tuning interlayer is a promising way for band alignment to achieve efficient electron injection in QDSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 TiO2 mesoporous film preparation and treatment
Highly crystalline TiO2 paste was synthesized by hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol via a sol–gel route.22 The porosity of the paste was controlled by the addition of various amounts of ethyl cellulose. A dense, transparent film (∼6 μm in thickness) of TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm in diameter) and a scattering layer (∼5 μm thick, 400 nm-diameter nanoparticles) were screen-printed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide glass in that order. The substrate was sintered at 500 °C for 1 h to generate anatase nanocrystals. After sintering, the TiO2 electrode was immersed in 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min. The film was then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. In the following step, the TiO2 photoanode was dipped into ethanol containing 0.02 M magnesium acetate for 2 min and annealed at 450 °C for another 30 min to form an ultrathin MgO layer on the TiO2 surfaces.
2.2 Preparation of double-layer CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs
The TiO2 electrodes were first treated by dipping drops of thioglycolic acid, allowed to stand for 1 min, and completely dried in a nitrogen flow. The electrodes were immersed in ethanol containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.1 M) and then in methanol containing Na2S·5H2O (0.1 M). Following each immersion, the electrodes were rinsed for 30 s to remove excess precursor. This dipping cycle was repeated three more times to deposit the binary CdS QDs onto the TiO2 films. The interfacial ternary CdS1−xSex QDs were obtained by surface selenization of the CdS QD-decorated TiO2 substrate. A Se2− source solution was prepared by dissolving Se (2.5 mM) in a solution of NaBH4 (5 mM) in distilled water. Ion transfer between Se and S was performed on CdS QD surfaces at 50 °C under Ar, with reaction times of 1, 10, and 30 min. The samples were then washed with distilled water and dried in a nitrogen flow. We annealed the samples at 230 °C for 15 min under Ar to convert the gradient CdS1−xSex QDs into homogeneous ternary alloys. The outer layer CdSe QDs were deposited by immersion of the electrode into ethanol containing Cd(NO3)2·4H2O (0.03 M) and transparent oxygen-free Se2− (0.03 M) solution, respectively. Seven cycles of CdSe QD deposition were performed.
2.3 Characterization of nanocrystals
The morphology and phase structure were determined with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6500F, JEOL) and a transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100F, JEOL). The atomic ratio of each element in the interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs were obtained by Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, which is integrated in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The semiconductor QDs were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera SXM, Japan) using Al Kα radiation. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Lambda-750 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer). LHE measurement was carried out on a thin cover glass (0.14 mm). TiO2 was deposited onto the cover glass plate and covered with a drop of an aqueous solution and another thin glass plate. The aqueous solution was used because water is used as the electrolyte solvent in QDSCs. The transmittance and absorbance spectra of bare and QD-sensitized TiO2 films were measured by means of the integrating sphere detector in the spectrophotometer. LHE was obtained by adding the absorbed photon ratios on the front side and the back side. Photoelectron spectroscopy (AC-3, Riken) was used to determine the ionization potentials of the semiconductor QDs; the analysis was performed under a 0.2 L min−1 N2 flow.
2.4 Solar cell assembly and performance
The TiO2 photoanodes decorated with CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs were coated with a thin ZnS layer before device construction, to passivate the charge carrier traps induced by dangling orbitals and surface defects. The ZnS coating was applied by dipping the QD-decorated TiO2 substrates alternately into Zn(NO3)2 (0.1 M) and Na2S (0.1 M) aqueous solutions. The dipping procedure was repeated once. For the counter electrode, we employed a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass coated with a thin film of Cu2S, which was prepared by a chemical bath deposition process. The reaction was conducted at 70 °C for 1 h with a mixture of 25 mM Cu(SO4)2·5H2O and 25 mM Na2S2O3·5H2O in an oxygen-free aqueous solution. The photovoltaic cells were assembled by hot pressuring the TiO2/CdS1−xSex electrode, a Cu2S-coated counter electrode, and a 25 μm-thick sealing spacer (Surlyn, Solaronix). We used a polysulfide electrolyte with a S2−/Sx2− redox pair, which was prepared with the following composition: Na2S (1 M), S (1 M), and NaOH (0.1 M).
The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were measured by using a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 under standard air mass 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2, WXS-90S-L2, Wacom Denso Co., Japan). The scan mode was conducted from short circuit to open circuit. IPCE values were measured with monochromatic incident light (1016 photon per cm2) under 100 mW cm−2 white bias light in DC mode (CEP-2000, Bunko-Keiki).23
2.5 Analysis of solar cell devices
IMPS and IMVS were carried out with a frequency response analyzer (Solartron-1255B) and a potentiostat/galvanostat (Solartron-SI1287) combined with a laser source (excitation wavelength, 446 nm). The light intensity was varied using a controller (DPS3002, Neoark). The electrochemical impedance spectra were obtained on an electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1287 and 1255B) with a two-electrode system under 1 sun illumination. For the open-circuit voltage decay study, the cell was illuminated until Voc was stable. The illumination was turned off with a shutter. The open-circuit voltage decay was recorded with an Ecochemie potentiostat equipped with a short-interval sampling module. The decay analysis refers only to values measured after closing of the shutter for full darkness.
3. Results and discussion
Ternary CdS1−xSex (0 < x < 1) QDs, in which Cd, S, and Se atoms were homogenously distributed, were grown on MgO-coated TiO2 film. The strategy for synthesis of ternary CdS1−xSex QDs is based on a surface ion exchange method.24,25 The solubility product constant (Ksp) of CdSe (1.4 × 10−35) is much smaller (8 orders of magnitude) than that of CdS (8 × 10−27). This implies that the CdS QDs can be used as sacrificial templates to synthesize more stable CdSe by an anion exchange process. Firstly, the CdS QDs were in situ decorated onto MgO-coated TiO2 using a SILAR method. After surface selenization of the CdS QDs with Se2− ions in aqueous solution, some of the S2− ions were replaced by Se2− from the surface to center of the QDs; this process was controlled by adjusting the ion exchange time and temperature. The Se concentration decreases from the surface to center in these CdS1−xSex QDs, while the concentration of S increases correspondingly. The anions would start to cross the crystal grain boundary of the QDs after annealing at 230 °C in an Ar atmosphere, producing the homogeneous alloy structure for ternary CdS1−xSex QDs (0 ≤ x ≤ 1).
Herein, the purpose of involving the thin MgO layer was to reduce the number of surface traps and defective states on TiO2 nanocrystals. An atomic model of a ternary CdS1−xSex QD, in which the Cd, S, and Se atoms are homogenously distributed, is shown in Fig. 1a. CdSe QDs were deposited as a light-absorption layer by means of the SILAR process, in seven cycles; these conditions were previously shown to provide co-sensitized QDSCs with the best performance.26 The photoanode structure is illustrated in Fig. 1b. In this structure, the interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs play two important roles. First, the energy band of the ternary nanocrystals can be tuned by changing the Se content. The CBM of annealed CdS1−xSex nanocrystals is shifted downward relative to the CBM of CdS buffer layers, to produce a staircase band alignment with CdSe QDs; and this shift facilitates charge injection from the QDs into the TiO2 nanoparticles. Second, the lattice mismatch between CdS1−xSex and CdSe is less than 4%,24 which promotes deposition of CdSe QDs and enhances light harvesting at long wavelengths.

There are three main pathways for recombination between excited electrons in different semiconductor nanocrystal layers and holes in the polysulfide electrolyte (Fig. 1b, red arrows). The presence of interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs with favorable band energy is the key to maximizing electron injection and reducing charge recombination. An overhigh interlayer CBM will introduce a potential barrier at the CdS1−xSex/CdSe interface, blocking charge transfer and increasing recombination between electrons in the CdSe QDs and holes in the electrolyte (recombination 1). In contrast, an extremely low interlayer CBM will not drive electrons toward TiO2 and will thus increase the probability of recombination (recombination 2).
The morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs was examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Fig. 2a–c). The fringe spacing of 0.35 nm matched the interplanar distance of the (100) planes in cubic anatase TiO2 (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b reveals a decorated CdS1−xSex (x = 0.43) QD with diameter ∼5 nm. In the HRTEM image obtained after CdSe QD deposition (Fig. 2c), another layer of CdSe QDs with obviously different lattice fringes can be observed. These HRTEM results confirm that the QDs adsorbed controllably onto the TiO2 nanoparticles are bi-layer structure.

The elemental compositions of representative CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs and the double-layer CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The appearance of Cd3d5/2 at 412.5 eV and Cd3d5/2 at 405.3 eV (Fig. 2d); S2p at 163 eV and Se3p at 160.7 eV (Fig. 2e); and Se3d at 55 eV (Fig. 2e) in CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs confirmed the coexistence of Cd, Se, and S (black lines). After deposition of the CdSe QDs, the electrons originating from S atoms in the CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs were quenched by the outer layer CdSe QDs, so the probability of penetration of these electrons was low. Coincident with this quenching, the S2p peak of the CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs (red curve in Fig. 2e) disappeared (black curve in Fig. 2e). These results confirm that the CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs were absorbed on the TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces in a double-layer structure.
To determine the band structure at the TiO2/CdS1−xSex/CdSe interfaces, we first evaluated the bandgap of the QDs layer-by-layer. We characterized ∼6 μm-thick transparent film of TiO2 nanoparticles (20 nm in diameter) sensitized with CdS QDs or with CdS1−xSex QDs of three different compositions (x = 0.26, 0.43 and 0.58). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the atomic ratio of each element in the QDs (Fig. S1a†). The optical absorption of the interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs was measured before and after CdSe QD deposition by means of UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The characteristic absorption region in the spectrum of the CdS QDs was between 350 and 450 nm, which was attributed to the bandgap of these QDs. The absorption spectral range of the CdS1−xSex QDs was broadened relative to that of the CdS QDs. A red shift of the absorbance band-edge was achieved in the spectral range of 490–600 nm by controlled incorporation of Se into the CdS QDs. The absorption edge after deposition of the outer layer CdSe QDs was further red shifted to 675 nm, which made the spectrum broad enough that the outer layer could act as the light-harvesting layer. Interestingly, after seven cycles of CdSe QD deposition on various TiO2/CdS1−xSex photoanodes, the tail of the optical absorption spectrum became coherent. We estimated the optical bandgaps of the CdS1−xSex QDs and CdSe QDs by applying Tauc's law for direct bandgap semiconductors, plotting (αhν)2 against the photon energy (inset of Fig. 3a), where α is the absorption coefficient, and hν is the photon energy.27 For pristine CdS QDs and CdS1−xSex QDs with Se ratios of 0.26, 0.43, and 0.58, the optical bandgaps were determined to be 2.85, 2.68, 2.5, and 2.35 eV, respectively. After deposition of the CdSe QDs, the bandgap was 1.93 ± 0.02 eV.

(c) Band diagram at the TiO2/CdS1−xSex/CdSe interfaces; VBM, valence band maximum. 
Next we analyzed the QD ionization potentials, which correspond to their valence band maxima, by means of photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). The bottom spectrum in Fig. 3b was obtained from pristine CdS QDs. The secondary electron cutoffs for the CdS1−xSex QDs were shifted toward a lower ionization potential relative to the cutoffs for the CdS QDs. The positions of the valence band maxima with respect to the vacuum levels of pristine CdS, CdS0.74Se0.26, CdS0.57Se0.43, and CdS0.42Se0.58 QDs were −6.46, −6.41, −6.29, and −6.23 eV, respectively.
We had determined the bandgaps for the QDs based on Tauc's plots (inset in Fig. 3a), so we could obtain the positions of the CBM with respect to the vacuum levels obtained by adding both the valence band maxima and the bandgaps. The obtained CBM were −3.61, −3.73, −3.79, and −3.88 eV versus vacuum levels for interlayer CdS, CdS0.74Se0.26, CdS0.57Se0.43, and CdS0.42Se0.58 QDs. Employing the same approach, we determined the CBM of the QD samples to be 3.76 ± 0.02 eV after seven cycles of CdSe QD deposition.
As reported elsewhere, the VBM of TiO2 is −7.5 eV with respect to vacuum level.13,28 We investigated the absorbance and reflectance spectrum of MgO passivated TiO2 nanoparticles, both of which confirmed its bandgap value is 3.5 eV (Fig. S2†). We can determine the CBM of surface treated TiO2 nanoparticles, which is −4.0 eV versus vacuum levels, agreed with some reported values.29
The band diagram for the TiO2/CdS1−xSex/CdSe interfaces is illustrated in Fig. 3b. Herein, the conduction band potential of CdSSe locates lower than those of CdSe QDs, which is attributed to their size increases during the annealing process. The CdS and CdS0.74Se0.26 nanocrystals generated type I nanoheterojunctions with CdSe QDs, whereas the CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe and CdS0.42Se0.58/CdSe generated type II nanoheterojunctions at the TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces.
Herein, our TiO2/CdS/CdSe structure demonstrated a type I band alignment, which is contrary to some reported CdS/CdSe co-sensitized photoanodes.13,30–32 This is due to the CdS QDs buffer layer we use being quite thin with a small diameter, resulting in a large bandgap and high CBM value. This type I TiO2/CdS/CdSe structure is in accordance with another report.33
It was noticed that the band energy of CdSe QDs on CdS1−xSex QDs interlayer and on TiO2 is different due to the Fermi level alignment. The CBM of CdSe QDs on interlayer is −3.76 eV, while it is −3.91 eV on TiO2. The CdSe QDs are shifted up, which is agree with the previously report.13 As well, the band energy of interlayer CdS1−xSex may be shift down by outlayer CdSe deposition due to Fermi level pinning. From Fig. 3b, the shift of CdSe conduction band energy is 0.09 eV in different interlayer CdS1−xSex (x = 0.43 and 0.58), while their interlayer CBM shifting is lower than 0.02 eV. Therefore, the band energy of annealed FTO/TiO2/CdS1−xSex photoanode has slight effect by outlayer CdSe QDs, we did not count the down shift value.
A mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle film, consisting of a ∼6 μm-thick, dense, transparent layer and a ∼5 μm-thick scattering layer, was sensitized by CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs and used as the photoanode in QDSCs. Fig. S3a† shows scanning electron micrographs of bare TiO2 nanoparticles (upper part) and TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs (lower part). Tian et al. reported that the porosity of TiO2 nanoparticles affects the performance of QDSCs.34 Therefore, we determined the pore size of the nanoparticles before and after coverage with the QDs. The transparent TiO2 nanoparticles we prepared had an average diameter of 25 nm with a pore size of 25.0 ± 4 nm, as determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. After coverage with the CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs, the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles was rough and the pore size became smaller. The double-layer CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs were effectively loaded onto the TiO2 film, as demonstrated in the cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph shown in Fig. S3b.† Cross-sectional mapping of Cd, S, and Se indicates that these elements were uniformly distributed throughout the photoanode.
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of CdS/CdSe QDs and CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs were measured under 1 sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) in the presence of a S2−/Sx2− redox couple and a Cu2S counter electrode. The interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs with a lower conduction band resulted in easier electron injection from the CdSe QDs to the TiO2 nanoparticles. Consequently, larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) values were obtained for cells sensitized with CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs than for cells sensitized with CdS/CdSe QDs (Fig. 4a). Cells sensitized with the CdS0.74Se0.26/CdSe, CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe, and CdS0.42Se0.58/CdSe QDs exhibited Jsc values of 13.42, 14.22, and 12.66 mA cm−2, which were 1.35, 2.15, and 0.59 mA cm−2 higher than the value obtained with the CdS/CdSe QDs (12.07 mA cm−2). The performance characteristics obtained with the four types of QDs are summarized in Table 1. Note that the Jsc value obtained with CdS0.42Se0.58 QDs as the interlayer was 1.57 mA cm−2 less than that obtained with the CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs, which have a lower Se content. The reason is that the difference between the CBM of the CdS0.42Se0.58 QDs and the TiO2 nanoparticles (0.12 eV, Fig. 3c) was so close that the driving force for electron passing through the TiO2/QD interfaces was not large enough. This result is in agreement with our explanation of charge recombination (Fig. 1b).

Compared with bare CdSe QDs (7 cycles) decorated TiO2 nanoparticles, the improvement of Jsc in TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe and TiO2/CdS0.42Se0.58/CdSe based QDSCs can be contributed to the formation of type II heterojunction, which benefit the electron injection from CdSe QDs to TiO2 photoanode. Besides, the interlayer CdS1−xSex has matched lattice parameters with CdSe, which could increase the loading quality of CdSe QDs and enhance the optical absorption, increasing the Jsc.
The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra confirmed the superiority of CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs as sensitizers (Fig. 4b). In principle, the IPCE of QDSCs depends on the LHE of the QDs, the efficiency of charge injection (Φinj) from the QDs into the TiO2 nanocrystals, and the efficiency of charge collection by the glass-supported electrode (ηcoll):35 IPCE = LHE × ϕinj × ηcoll(1)
The IPCEs of the four QDSCs showed obvious differences in the visible range but identical tails at 710 nm. The identical tails imply that the different Jsc values of the double-layer QDs should be attributed not to differences in light absorption but rather to differences in charge injection efficiency.
We determined the LHEs of the CdS/CdSe QDs and three types of CdS1−xSex QDs/CdSe QDs (x = 0.26, 0.43, and 0.58) on a thin cover glass (0.14 mm) to avoid scattered light leaks from the glass substrate side (see the Experimental section). Both transmittance (R%) and absorbance (T%) of bare and QDs sensitized TiO2 films were measured by the integrating sphere detector. The LHE of QDs can be obtained from the difference in the spectra between the sensitized and unsensitized films (eqn (2)).A1% = 1 − R1% (TiO2) − T1% (TiO2)A2% = 1 − R2% (TiO2/QDs) − T2% (TiO2/QDs) LHE = A2% − A1%(2)
The transmittance and reflectance spectra of bare TiO2 film are shown in Fig. S4a.† The light collection obtained by adding the transmittance and reflectance spectra approached 100% above 400 nm. Fig. S4b† shows the LHE of QD-sensitized films; light harvesting below 400 nm was assigned to absorption by the TiO2 film.
We knew the LHEs of the QDs from the difference in absorptivity (%) between the sensitized and unsensitized films as determined with an integrating sphere detector. The band edge of the LHE spectra in Fig. 4b was kept at 710 nm for the different double-layer QDs. The LHEs of the QDs approached 90% at 550 nm owing to the high extinction coefficient of semiconductor QDs, the concentration of QDs, and the thickness of the absorbing layer we used. The nearly identical LHE spectra for the different CdS1−xSex QDs/CdSe QDs confirm that the differences in the IPCE spectra could not be attributed to the optical absorptions of the QDs.
Improving the charge collection efficiency of QDSCs requires optimization of both electron transport time (τsc) and electron recombination lifetime (τoc), which can be evaluated by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). Typical IMPS and IMVS plots for representative solar cells based on CdS1−xSex/CdSe (x = 0.43) QDs are shown in Fig. S5a and b.† The τsc values can be calculated as τsc = 1/ωmin,sc = 1/2πfmin,sc, where fmin,sc is the frequency of the lowest imaginary number in the IMPS plot.36 The τoc values can be calculated as τoc = 1/ωmin,oc = 1/2πfmin,oc, where fmin,oc is the frequency of the lowest imaginary number in the IMVS plot.37 The calculated τsc and τoc values are presented in Table S1† for laser intensities from 20 to 50 W m−2 (λ = 446 nm).
Knowing the values of τsc and τoc allows us to calculate the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons: ηcoll = 1/(1+ τsc/τoc). Because τoc was generally at least ∼9 times τsc, ηcoll values of >90% were achieved. The calculated ηcoll values for CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs and CdS/CdSe QDSCs under various illumination levels are shown in Table S1.† The calculated ηcoll values did not change markedly with light intensity, because the electron transport time and recombination lifetime have the same dependence on light intensity. The ηcoll of the QDSCs was estimated at laser intensity (46.6 W m−2) because the recorded Voc at this intensity was close to that obtained at 1 sun illumination.
The dependence of electronic injection efficiency on wavelength was determined by dividing the IPCE by both the LHEs of QD-sensitized films (Fig. S4b†) and the ηcoll values (eqn (1)). The wavelength dependences of the electronic injection efficiencies of photoanodes sensitized with CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs and CdS/CdSe QDs are given in Fig. 5a. The staircase CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs enhanced the electron injection efficiency of the QDSCs; specifically, QDSCs with CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs as the interlayer showed 15% higher charge injection efficiency than that observed with CdS QDs. As a result, the photocurrent of CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe-based QDSCs was substantially improved.
 Fig. 5  (a) Plots of injection efficiency versus wavelength calculated for CdS/CdSe and CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDSCs (x = 0.26, 0.43, 0.58). (b) Plots of Jsc and potential difference of CdS1−xSex/CdSe heterojunctions versus Se content in the CdS1−xSex QD layer (x = 0, 0.26, 0.43, and 0.58). 
We also evaluated the dependence of Jsc and the CBM potential difference of CdS1−xSex/CdSe heterojunctions on Se content, Se/(S + Se), in the ternary QDs. The CBM potential difference between CdS1−xSex and CdSe QDs depended linearly on Se content, whereas Jsc was highest when CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs were used as the interlayer, and then decreased as the Se content was increased further. The photocurrent density depended on the electron injection efficiency, which is determined by the band alignment of the CBM of the two layers of semiconductor QDs and TiO2. When the Se fraction was increased to 0.58, the difference between the CBM of CdS1−xSex and TiO2 was <0.2 eV. This small potential difference could not sufficiently drive electrons toward TiO2, and thus the charge injection efficiency and the Jsc were reduced.
To demonstrate the advantage of our developed CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDSCs, we compared the charge transport and recombination in a representative TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe photoanode with that in a typical TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoanode (Fig. 6a). The logarithm of τsc was linearly related to Jsc, and electron transport in a TiO2 film decorated with CdS1−xSex/CdSe QDs was obviously faster than that in CdS/CdSe QDs in the low Jsc region (low laser intensity, ∼20 W m−2), whereas the difference was small in the high Jsc range (large laser intensity, ∼50 W m−2). The value of τsc is known to be affected by the thickness and the presence of electron traps distributed in the bandgap of nanocrystalline TiO2. During the formation of the interlayer CdS1−xSex nanocrystals on the MgO-passivated TiO2 surfaces, the annealing process may improve the crystallinity of the ternary QDs and reduce the number of surface states at the TiO2/QDs interfaces, decreasing the charge transfer time. At higher illumination, the surface traps on the TiO2 nanocrystals would be filled up by dense injected electrons, so the charge transport time would not be markedly affected by such trap states, and thus the difference in electron transfer time would be reduced. The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) in TiO2 can be calculated by the expression Dn = d2/τsc, where d is film thickness. Plots of Dn as a function of Jsc showed the same trend as plots of τsc (Fig. 6a).

IMVS was performed under a laser source (λ = 446 nm) at various light intensities to gauge the dynamics of charge recombination in the QDSCs. The logarithm of τoc was linearly related to Voc (Fig. 6b). The results indicates that the carrier lifetime of a representative device sensitized with CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs (x = 0.43) was larger than that of a device sensitized with CdS/CdSe QDs. The J–V characteristics of QDSCs based on CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs and CdS/CdSe QDs both in the dark and under illumination (100 mW cm−2) were extracted (Fig. 7a). A solar cell with CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs as the interlayer exhibited higher Jsc, Voc, and η values than a cell sensitized with CdS/CdSe QDs. The CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSC achieved the following performance characteristics: Jsc = 14.22 mA cm−2, Voc = 566.8 mV, and η = 4.46%. The performance characteristics of the CdS/CdSe QDSC were as follows: Jsc = 12.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 552.9 mV, and η = 4.09%. Whereas the Jsc and Voc values were improved by replacement of the CdS QD with CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs, the opposite trend was observed for FF, which decreased from 61.3% to 55.3%.

The inset in (c) is a schematic diagram of the equivalent circuit used to model the experimental data. 
The inset of Fig. 7a illustrates the proposed heterojunction structure at the TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces. Because a type I junction existed at the CdS/CdSe interface, electron injection from the CBM of CdSe into the TiO2 nanocrystals was impeded by the CdS nanocrystal layer, as has previously been reported.37 Excited electrons located at the CdS/CdSe interface and surface traps from CdSe QDs had a large probability of recombining with the holes in electrolyte, resulting in decreased cell performance. In contrast, a CdS0.57Se0.43 QD layer with a relatively low CBM formed a type II staircase heterojunction, which resulted in increased electron injection yield from the CdSe QDs into TiO2 and reduced charge recombination. The transition from a type I CdS/CdSe heterojunction to a type II staircase CdS1−xSex/CdSe heterojunction depended on the diameter of the QDs, their Fermi levels, and the Se fraction in the CdS1−xSex QDs.
Two attractive notations should pay attention in the developed staircase TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe photoanode. First, the optimized potential barrier of two interfaces: TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43 and CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe are obviously different. Second, the CBM of CdSe QDs are raised after introducing of CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs as interlayer. It is known that the difference of CBM should over 0.2 eV for effective electrons injection from donors to TiO2, as the driven force would be large enough to compete with the relaxation and recombination processes.38 The potential barrier of TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43 (0.21 eV) is agree with the theoretical speculation. In contrast, the barrier difference between CdS0.57Se0.43 and CdSe can be reduced as low as 0.03 eV while the electrons injection is still promising. One explanation is that the electrons injection is dependent on the crystal lattice parameters of contact semiconductors.39 The lattice mismatch between TiO2 and Cd chalcogenide is large than 15%, while it is less than 4% for (001) planes between CdS1−xSex and CdSe.24,40 The matched crystal structure between CdS1−xSex and CdSe will facilitate the effective charge injection. Another reason is attributed to the different exciton binding energy of the semiconductors (TiO2 ∼ 60 meV,41 CdS ∼ 28 meV,42 CdSe ∼ 13 meV (ref. 43) in bulk materials). “In principle, the exciton binding energy in QDs is larger than bulk materials due to the quantum confinement effect, which is accounted in condition that an infinite barrier height exists.44,45 As the barrier height between CdSe and interlayer CdS1−xSex is quite closed (e.g. 0.03 eV between CdS0.57Se0.43 and CdSe), their binding energy tends to similar as bulk nanocrystals.” The lowest exciton binding energy of CdSe indicated their smallest Coulomb force to confine the excited electrons, resulting in their effective electrons injection across the CdS1−xSex/CdSe interfaces.
Compared with bare CdSe QDs deposited on TiO2, the conduction band of CdSe QDs is lifted up modestly by the interlayer CdS1−xSex QDs. This phenomenon can be easy explained by the situation of Fermi level alignment which is dependent on the conductivity of semiconductors.46 Herein, we firstly show the quantificationally change of the potential difference in two interfaces, TiO2/CdS1−xSex and CdS1−xSex/CdSe in co-sensitized QDSCs. The method of introducing the ternary QDs as interlayer can effectively tune the potential of both interfaces, which is a general way to facilitate the electrons injection and improve efficiency in all kind of co-sensitized QDSCs.
Next, we carried out open-circuit voltage decay analysis to evaluate the charge recombination process. Fig. 7b shows the variation of time dependent Voc decay for cells with the decay starting at the moment of interruption of light power. The electron lifetime can be determined from the voltage decay with time according to (3)where τoc is the recombination lifetime, kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10−23 J K−1), T is the absolute temperature (300 K), and e is the electronic charge (1.602 × 10−19 C).32
The correlation of lifetime with Voc is plotted in the inset of Fig. 7b. At a given Voc, the recombination lifetime of cells sensitized with CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe was greater than that of cells sensitized with CdS/CdSe. The longer recombination lifetime of the former confirms that the ample coverage of the staircase CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe heterostructure increased charge injection and resulted in low probability of back electron transfer. The reduced recombination lifetime in the CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSC compared to that in the CdS/CdSe QDSC led to the higher Voc of the former.
We measured the electrochemical impedance spectra of the two kinds of QDSCs by applying a potential of 0.55 V by modeling with an equivalent circuit (Fig. 7c). The two semicircular curves, a small one at 1–100 kHz and a large one at 0.1–1 kHz, were ascribed to charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1) and the recombination resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface (R2), respectively.47 The recombination resistance of a QDSC based on CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe (18 ohm) was larger than that of a CdS/CdSe QDSC (12.5 ohm). The electron lifetime (1/2πfmax) can be derived from the Bode phase plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra (Fig. 7d), which display the frequency peaks of the charge transfer process at different interfaces for these two QDSCs. The electron lifetime was 25.2 ms for CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs and 15.9 ms for CdS/CdSe QDSCs. The longer lifetime for the former confirms that the type II staircase heterojunction at the TiO2 nanoparticle surface effectively reduced back electron transfer.
To demonstrate the charge injection and recombination processes of ternary CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe and doped-CdS/CdSe QDSCs, a schematic for photogenerated electrons and holes in doped QDSCs photoanode are demonstrated in Fig. 8a. Excited electrons can be injected from the conduction band of CdSe QDs to CdS QDs (I1) and wide band gap TiO2 nanoparticles (I2). Injected electrons in the conduction band of wide band gap semiconductor can be transported (T1) to conductive FTO glass or back injected in the traps of CdS QDs (I3). Processes I1, I2, and T1 are required for solar cell operation which is necessarily to compete with recombination processes. For the doped CdS QDs with dopent introduced traps, electrons in conduction band of CdS QDs can be trapped (Tr1) into its trap states, depending on the band alignment, while the holes are fast trapped in band gap states (Tr2). Inside of the semiconductor, the direct recombination is induced by the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, R1 and R2, or through trap states, R3 and R4. On the other hand, electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2 and CdS traps would recombine with trapped holes in the CdS QDs (R5) and CdSe valence band (R6).
 Fig. 8  (a) Charge injection and recombination processes for photogenerated electrons (green arrows) and holes (blue arrow) in photoanode in QDSCs. Each arrow could denote more than one process. Injection (red dashed arrow), trapping and recombination (blue dashed arrow), and transport (black dashed arrow) are indicated. (b) J–V characteristics of solar cells sensitized with Zn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs, Se-doped CdS/CdSe QDs and CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs. 
Our surface ion transfer method of tailoring the bandgap of nanostructured semiconductors is to make an alloy of two semiconductors, CdS and CdSe, with different energy gaps. Composition dependent bandgap engineering arises from a dependence of a homogenously crystal lattice change, without introducing the dopants and traps states. The recombination of R3–R6 can be avoided in the alloyed system.

J–V characteristics of solar cells sensitized with Zn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs and Se-doped CdS/CdSe QDs and CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs are demonstrated in Fig. 8b. The interlayer CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs without traps resulted in lower recombination compared with the doped ones. Consequently, larger Voc values were obtained for cells sensitized with CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDs than for cells sensitized with Zn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs and Se-doped CdS/CdSe QDs (Fig. 8b). Cells sensitized with the CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe, Zn-doped CdS/CdSe QDs and Se-doped CdS/CdSe QDs exhibited Voc values of 566.8, 517.7, and 548.5 mV. The performance characteristics obtained with the types of QDs are summarized in Table S2.† The highest shunt resistance of CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs indicates its lowest leakage current, which further confirm the less traps in our ternary CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs than the doped CdS QDs. Besides, the low series resistance of ternary CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs contributes its relatively higher FF (0.55). This result indicates the designed ternary CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe QDSCs not only enhance the charge injection, but also keep a fairly high FF as well as not introduce the traps states inside the QDs.
3. Conclusions
We introduced a series of annealed CdS1−xSex QDs as potential-tuning interlayer to realign the band structures of the CdSe based QDSCs. By controlling the Se content in the CdS1−xSex QDs, we tuned their conduction band minimum to generate suitable potential driving force at the interfaces on its both sides, TiO2/CdS1−xSex and CdS1−xSex/CdSe, which resulted in an optimized staircase band structure. The CdS1−xSex QDs interlayer reduced the lattace mismatch between TiO2 and CdSe QDs as well. Compared with the TiO2/CdS/CdSe heterojunction, the TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe heterojunction with finely tuned type II staircase provided energetic driving force simultaneously adequate for both the exciton dissociation at the CdS0.57Se0.43/CdSe interface and the electron injection at the TiO2/CdS0.57Se0.43 interface. It resulted in a ∼15% improvement in electron injection efficiency with reduced charge recombination. A solar cell with CdS0.57Se0.43 QDs interlayer achieved an 17.8% enhancement in photocurrent density and the maximum power conversion efficiency as high as 4.46% under 1 sun illumination. It strongly suggested that using ternary QDs as potential tuning layer represent a promising method for efficient electron injection in QDSCs.
