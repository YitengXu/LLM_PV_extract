    , Accepted 20th October 2013First published on 23rd October 2013AbstractIn this paper, ligand free vertically aligned Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoplates were directly synthesized on a fluorine doped tin oxide substrate using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, forming a nanoplate array. The array follows a two-step growth by first forming a Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film (∼100 nm), followed by vertical nanoplate formation. The nanoplates are about 20 nm thick and 300 nm high with a petal-like shape. Furthermore, the nanoplate array was integrated in a dye sensitized solar cell as a counter electrode with a power conversion efficiency of 3.65%, which is comparable to that of a conventional sputtered Pt counter electrode (3.33%) and higher than that fabricated with a “classical” Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film (2.83%). The Cu2ZnSnS4 nanoplate array is proved to be suitable for counter electrode fabrication to achieve Pt-free dye sensitized solar cells, which could significantly cut down the cell cost and provide environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have developed into one of the most attractive third generation photovoltaic devices, with easy fabrication and relatively high conversion efficiency.1 A typical DSSC is composed of three parts: a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, an electrolyte, and a counter-electrode. So far, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructured photoanodes are the most promising semiconductor materials in DSSCs to promote electrons from the ground state to an excited state, in the dyes,2–4 and then transfer them to the conduction band of the photoanodes. Different dyes have been investigated to absorb broader bands to improve the light absorption.5–8 High electrocatalytic activity for efficient reduction of the charge carriers in the electrolyte is also indispensable,9,10 which requires a high quality counter electrode with good electronic conduction. Generally, platinum (Pt) is used as a counter electrode, where electrons from the external circuit are collected and catalyse the reduction of the redox electrolyte.11 However, catalytic materials with low cost, low toxicity and environmental abundance are always highly favoured to replace Pt (scarce and expensive) despite their high conductivity and good electrocatalytic activity.
In the past several years, considerable efforts have been made to replace this precious metal by using abundant and low cost materials.12 Previous studies have reported the use of various materials as possible candidates for non-platinum-based counter-electrodes. For instance, carbon materials (graphene, graphite, carbon nanotubes, active carbon, etc.)13–18 were chosen for their high surface area and low cost. Conductive polymers (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), etc.)19–23 were studied for their stability and high catalytic activity. Other inorganic materials (nitrides, carbides, oxides, Cu2S, PbS, CuInS2, etc.)22,24–30 were also investigated for their abundance and diversity, including quaternary chalcogenide Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS).
CZTS was first found as a p-type semiconductor with suitable properties for solar cell applications.31–34 The advantages of this quaternary semiconductor are its earth-abundance and ideal direct band gap of ∼1.5 eV and its high absorption coefficient (>1 × 10−4 cm−1),35 enabling a wide range of applications, such as light absorbing materials for thin film photovoltaics,32,33 thermoelectric materials,34etc. Recently, Xin et al. spin-coated CZTS nanocrystal ink to form a thin film directly on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass36 as an efficient counter-electrode for DSSC photocathodes and the thin film exhibited both high electrocatalytic activity comparable to Pt and efficient reduction of I3− in the electrolyte. Following this work, porous CZTS thin films37 and porous38 and hierarchical39 CZTS microspheres were also employed to fabricate efficient counter-electrodes, further confirming the high catalytic activity of CZTS as a counter electrode fabricated by Xin et al. However, most of the above materials rely on wet chemistry syntheses and inevitable post-treatments, such as washing, annealing, etc., to remove the excessive ligands, which are time consuming and may affect the final performance of the CZTS DSSC counter-electrodes. In this paper, we report a ligand free, one step synthesis of a vertically oriented CZTS nanoplate array directly on a FTO glass substrate by a simple pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. The two-dimensional (2D) vertical nanoplates with uniform morphology provide a larger interfacial contact area between the electrolyte and the counter-electrode so that the charge transfer to the electrolyte is greatly enhanced. The DSSC device fabricated using this nanoplate array shows comparable efficiency to that made of the sputtered Pt counter-electrode.
2. Methods
2.1. Synthesis of CZTS nanoplate arrays
Vertically aligned CZTS nanoplate arrays were directly grown on a clean FTO glass substrate by ablating a CZTS target with a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser in a horizontal tube furnace.40 The CZTS target was fabricated by the solid-state reaction41 of Cu2S, ZnS, SnS2 and S powders mixed at a mole ratio of 0.95:1.05:1:0.02. The laser wavelength, energy density, and pulse frequency were 1064 nm, 31.5 mJ cm−2, and 10 Hz, respectively. Prior to the laser deposition, the tube was pumped down to 600 mTorr, and flushed with formic gas three times to remove residual oxygen. The FTO substrate was placed in front of the target (Fig. S1, ESI†), heated and maintained at 285 °C. After about a 17 min deposition, the furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature.
2.2. Fabrication of DSSCs
For a fair comparison, all the DSSCs were fabricated with TiO2 photoanode materials relying on a standardized fabrication process. A commercial solution of TiO2 (Solaronix) was spin-coated on a clean FTO glass, baked for 10 min at 150 °C and immediately annealed for 30 min at 500 °C. The photoanodes were then sensitized in a 0.3 mM cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)bis(tetrabutylammonium) ethanolic solution (N 719, Solaronix) for 24 h at room temperature. The cell was assembled with a 75 μm spacer (Surlyn) and backfilled with an iodine electrolyte (acetonitrile, DMPII (1 mM), LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.12 M), and tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M)).
2.3. Material characterizations
The crystallinity and purity of the samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Philips X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Cu Kα radiation at λ = 1.541 Å, and a confocal Raman microscope (DXR Thermo Scientific). A Carl Zeiss 1530 VP field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the synthesized nanostructures. The detailed nanostructures were investigated using a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The elemental mapping of the nanoplates and high resolution imaging were carried out using a FEI Tecnai F30 TEM equipped with an Oxford electron dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The elemental composition was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Perkin-Elmer Phi 560 XPS/Auger System). A Newport solar cell simulator (Model 9119X) equipped with a 150 W Xenon lamp (light irradiation of 100 mW cm−2) was employed to measure the J–V curves of the devices. The electrochemical impedance was measured on a Gamry potentiostat (Series G™ 300), at a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Nanoplate array characterization
The nanoplate array grown by PLD is shown in the FESEM image in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a presents a large area of vertically aligned nanoplates, uniformly distributed over an area of 1 cm × 1 cm FTO glass substrate. Nanoplates with a petal-like shape and about 20 nm thickness are clearly seen in a zoom-in image, as shown in Fig. 1b. In our experiment, it was found that nanoplates were always grown from a seed layer formed during the first 5 min of ablation of the target, on the surface of the FTO glass (Fig. 1c). The seed layer consists of CZTS nanocrystalline clustered grains with inhomogeneous sizes ranging from 300–700 nm, as shown in the inset in Fig. 1c, in which the nanocrystal size varies from 20 to 50 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) and (b) show FESEM images of vertically aligned CZTS nanoplate arrays at low and high magnifications, and (c) FESEM image of the granular CZTS thin film acting as a seed layer for the growth of the nanoplates; the inset shows a zoom-in image of the film. 
The structure of the nanoplates was further investigated by TEM (Fig. 2). A top view image of a cluster of CZTS nanoplates, peeled off from the seed layer, can be clearly seen in Fig. 2a, confirming that the thickness (∼20 nm) of the nanoplates is the same as observed by FESEM. A side view of two nanoplates lying on the top of a carbon TEM grid (Fig. 2b) reveals that the height of the nanoplates is about 300 nm. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the nanoplates, corresponding to the polycrystalline CZTS kesterite structure (simulated with the PCED2.0 program)42 with the presence of the major diffraction rings (112), (200), (220), and (312), is shown in Fig. 2c, which is in good agreement with those reported in the literature.43 No apparent additional phases were observed, which will be further confirmed by XRD and Raman data later on. A high resolution electron microscopy image (HREM) (Fig. 2d) of the nanoplate also shows the features of polycrystalline nanocrystals, where the (112) lattice fringes can be clearly observed. The CZTS nanocrystals present inhomogeneous size distributions with diameters ranging from several to tens of nanometers. Fig. 2e shows a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of an additional cross-sectional view of a cluster of CZTS nanoplates grown from the seed film. EDS mappings were performed in the rectangular area highlighted in Fig. 2e, revealing the coexistence of copper, zinc, tin and sulfur in the nanoplates, as shown in Fig. 2f–i, respectively. It appears that all the elements are homogeneously distributed over the whole area of the nanoplates. By quantitatively analysing the EDS data collected from different locations on the nanoplates, the elemental composition of CZTS nanoplates was calculated to be Cu1.62Zn1.33Sn1.31S3.74, showing a Cu deficient and Zn rich CZTS kesterite phase.

XRD was also employed in structural analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a, the XRD data of a pure FTO substrate (lower) and the CZTS nanoplate array, prepared on a FTO glass substrate (upper), are presented. Besides the FTO peaks from the substrate, other peaks, denoted by stars, can be clearly indexed to (112), (220), (312), and (008) planes of the CZTS kesterite pure phase (JCPDS no. 26-0575), which correspond to those reported by others.44 The Raman spectrum in Fig. 3b further authenticates the nature of the kesterite phase with a single peak at 331 cm−1, consistent with previously published results (331–338 cm−1).39,45–47 No impurity peaks were observed both in XRD and Raman spectra, confirming the high purity of the CZTS nanoplates.

Moreover, XPS was used to verify the oxidation states of the four elements in the CZTS nanoplate sample by characterizing the Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d, and S 2p core levels. In the Cu 2p spectrum (Fig. 4a), there are two peaks located at 952.02 and 932.28 eV, respectively, with a separation of 19.74 eV, indicating the presence of Cu+. The Zn 2p core level spectrum clearly shows that two peaks appear at 1045.12 and 1022.11 eV with a characteristic peak separation of 23.01 eV (Fig. 4b), revealing the formation of Zn2+. In the Sn 3d core level (Fig. 4c), two peaks are found at 494.51 and 486.15 eV, respectively, corresponding to the Sn4+ oxidation state with a characteristic binding energy of 8.36 eV. Finally, two peaks at 162.60 eV and 161.42 eV with a peak separation of 1.14 eV, in the S 2p spectrum (Fig. 4d), are also seen, which are in good agreement with the values reported for S.39

3.2. Discussion of the growth process
In our study, a two-step growth, namely seed layer growth and vertically aligned nanoplate formation, was observed. During the first 5 min of PLD ablation, a thin seed layer of CZTS nanocrystalline clustered grains with sizes between 300 and 700 nm was formed. The granular thin film, composed of 20–50 nm nanocrystals (Fig. S2†), acts as a seed layer for initiating perpendicular nanoplate growth. In our experiments, several synthesis parameters were changed to study the nanoplate formation. First, when the temperature was varied from 150 °C to 350 °C, no dramatic change of the vertically aligned nanoplate growth was observed. The pressure of the growth was also tuned from 600 mTorr to 1400 mTorr and proved to be a critical parameter for the vertical alignment and growth of the nanoplate array. At 600 mTorr, the nanoplates exhibit a vertical and uniform growth from the seed layer over a large area (Fig. 5a); however, when the pressure is changed to 1000 mTorr the nanoplates have a tendency to lose their alignment and growth in a coral-like shape at random positions in the array (Fig. 5b). Further changing the pressure to 1400 mTorr resulted in sparse and irregular growth of the nanoplates. As observed in Fig. 5c, only a few nanoplates are able to grow on the substrate and present a random orientation. Additionally, it was found that the laser beam energy was a very sensitive parameter for the nanoplate growth and the nanoplates were only formed in the energy range between 30 and 32 mJ cm−2. Thus far, we have not fully understood why the perpendicular nanoplate formation was initiated after the CZTS granular seed layer thickness reached a certain value (∼100 nm). However, we believe that, first, the CZTS seed layer thickness and morphology are critical for the nanoplate formation, and, second, the beam energy associated with producing the ablation plume to a specific partial pressure inside the tube determines if the beam can initiate this vertical nanoplate growth.

The nanoplates tend to lose their alignment and growth in a coral-like shape at random positions in the array, and (c) FESEM image of the nanoplate synthesized at 1400 mTorr, in which the growth of the nanoplates is irregular and suppressed. 
3.3. Device characterization
To estimate the photovoltaic performance and electrocatalytic activity of the CZTS nanoplate films versus Pt counter electrodes, DSSC devices were fabricated. For comparison purposes, a CZTS film (∼0.5 μm) similar to the height of the nanoplate array was also prepared by increasing the laser energy to 34 mJ cm−2 and temperature to 450 °C. The FESEM images of top and plane views of the CZTS thin film (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†) reveal a uniform surface and homogeneous thickness of the thin film with inhomogeneous grain sizes. No cracks or voids are visible on the top view and cross-sectional images. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) performances of three DSSCs, and their characteristic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The cell based on the CZTS nanoplate array counter electrode presents the best efficiency (3.65%) with a short current density of 10.27 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 0.55, which is slightly higher than those of the cell fabricated with a standard Pt counter electrode, with an efficiency and short circuit density of 3.33% and 8.72 mA cm−2, respectively. When the CZTS film (0.5 μm) was employed and measured, the efficiency of the cell only reached 2.83%. The higher efficiency using the CZTS nanoplate film might be attributed to the ligand free PLD synthesis as well as the large surface area of vertically aligned nanoplates, which provides more catalytic cycles for the reduction of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The effect of the photo-activity of CZTS is not believed to influence the short-circuit current of the device for the reason mentioned above, further the sensitized TiO2 and the electrolyte absorb most of the incident light, and only a very small portion could potentially reach CZTS and contribute to the reduction of the electrolyte, which would not be reflected by such a large increase in the efficiency of the DSSCs. However its effect cannot be totally ruled out, and more work is under investigation. As for the CZTS thin film solar cell, the lower efficiency might result from the lower surface area compared to the nanoplate array, which did not significantly improve the efficiency as the thickness increased.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out to further characterize the electrocatalytic activity of the various counter electrodes. A dummy cell with a symmetric sandwich-like (CE/electrolyte/CE) configuration for each type of counter-electrode was adopted in order to acquire Nyquist plots. An impedance measurement was obtained by applying a fixed DC current to a device while scanning the frequency at a multitude of values over several decades (from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz). Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit (Fig. 7) where Rs represents the series resistance, Rct is the charge transfer resistance, Zw is the Nernst diffusion impedance, and CPE is the constant phase angle element at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface. Rs is defined by the high frequency intercept on the real axis (Z′ axis). The semi-circle in the high and low frequencies represents the Rct value and the CPE at the electrolyte/counter electrode interface, and Nernst diffusion impedance of the triiodide/iodide couple in the electrolyte, respectively. All the electrochemical impedance data were extracted using Gamry Echem Analyst software and are summarized in Table 1. The large and similar Rs value for the CZTS thin film (18.27 Ω) and CZTS nanoplate array (18.01 Ω) counter electrodes can be attributed to the poorer conductivity of CZTS compared to metallic Pt (15.70 Ω). The higher Rct value for the CZTS thin film cell (14.44 Ω) might be caused by less catalytic sites compared to the nanoplate array. The Rct for the CZTS nanoplate array (3.96 Ω) is in the same range as that for Pt (5.38 Ω), but smaller, implying that the reduction of the electrolyte at the interface is faster than that for Pt, further proving that this three-dimensional nanoplate array is a good candidate for Pt free counter electrode fabrication in DSSCs.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized ligand free and vertically aligned CZTS nanoplates directly on a FTO glass substrate by a one-step PLD method. The formation process of the nanoplates was controlled by a two-step growth, where a seed layer was first formed directly on the surface of the substrate, followed by the nanoplate array growth. The nanoplate arrays were used as counter electrodes in DSSCs, demonstrating higher electrocatalytic activity and efficiency comparable to those of Pt counter electrodes, which opens up the possibilities of developing low cost and environmentally friendly counter electrodes for DSSCs.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) and (b) show FESEM images of vertically aligned CZTS nanoplate arrays at low and high magnifications, and (c) FESEM image of the granular CZTS thin film acting as a seed layer for the growth of the nanoplates; the inset shows a zoom-in image of the film.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Top view TEM image of a cluster of CZTS nanoplate array, (b) side view TEM image of two single CZTS nanoplates lying on the carbon film of the TEM grid, (c) selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) of the CZTS nanoplate with a polycrystalline structure, (d) high resolution TEM image of a nanoplate showing different grain sizes and orientations, and (e) STEM image of nanoplates, (f) Cu, (g) Zn, (h) Sn, and (i) S elemental EDS mappings of CZTS nanoplates highlighted in the rectangular area in (e).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Powder XRD pattern and (b) Raman scattering analysis of the nanoplates.	 

 	Fig. 4  High-resolution XPS analysis of the four constituent elements of the vertically oriented CZTS nanoplates: copper 2p, zinc 2p, tin 3d, and sulfur 2p in good agreement with the literature.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) FESEM image of the vertically aligned CZTS nanoplate array synthesized by PLD at 600 mTorr and (b) FESEM image of the nanoplate array synthesised at 1000 mTorr. The nanoplates tend to lose their alignment and growth in a coral-like shape at random positions in the array, and (c) FESEM image of the nanoplate synthesized at 1400 mTorr, in which the growth of the nanoplates is irregular and suppressed.	 

 	Fig. 6  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSSCs containing the same photoanode of TiO2 nanospheres and various counter electrodes of Pt/FTO, CZTS nanoplate/FTO, and CZTS thin film/FTO.	 

CZTS thin film	6.66	0.65	0.53	2.83	18.27	14.44
CZTS nanoplate array	10.27	0.68	0.55	3.65	18.01	3.96
Sputtered Pt	8.72	0.69	0.54	3.33	15.70	5.38

 	Fig. 7  Nyquist plots of solar cells containing symmetric cells of Pt/FTO, CZTS nanoplate/FTO, and CZTS thin film/FTO.
