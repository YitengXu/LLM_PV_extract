    , Accepted 31st December 2018First published on 23rd January 2019AbstractThe journey of smart textile-based wearable technologies first started with the attachment of sensors to fabrics, followed by embedding sensors in apparels. Presently, garments themselves can be transformed into sensors, which demonstrates the tremendous growth in the field of smart textiles. Wearable applications demand flexible materials that can withstand deformation for their practical use on par with conventional textiles. To address this, we explore the potential reasons for the enhanced performance of wearable devices realized from the fabrication of carbon nanostructured fibers with the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes and other two-dimensional materials. This review presents a brief introduction on the fabrication strategies to form carbon-based fibers and the relationship between their properties and characteristics of the resulting materials. The likely mechanisms of fiber-based electronic and storage devices, focusing mainly on transistors, nano-generators, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, sensors and therapeutic devices are also presented. Finally, the future perspectives of this research field of flexible and wearable electronics are discussed. The present study supplements novel ideas not only for beginners aiming to work in this booming area, but also for researchers actively engaged in the field of fiber-based electronics, dealing with advanced electronics and wide range of functionalities integrated into textile fibers.
1 Introduction
Textile electronics are revolutionary fabrics with novel technologies based on innovative materials that enable computing, digital components and electronics for advanced functionalities of communicating with other devices, eco-friendly energy conversion, generation and storage of energy, and monitoring and recording various human activities to protect the wearer from environmental hazards.1–3 Recently, stretchable wearable devices have been successfully demonstrated in different fields such as health monitoring, wearable gadgets, and therapeutic devices with demanding properties such as light-weight, flexible, bendable, washable, large-area with excellent electrical conductivity, and electrochemical and mechanical properties, which can be easily woven into conventional textiles.4–7 However, more consideration is necessary for the fabrication of flexible devices since they are in touch with the human body and act as a part of their outfit, which is unquestionably incredible.
The recent advancements in materials science has resulted in abundant breakthroughs in the development of polymer fibers, where due to their properties such as light weight and high flexibility with low cost they have been used as structured materials in the field of textiles with the advancements in weaving technology.8,9 On the other hand, high conductivity is required for fibers used in wearable electronics, which cannot be attained through polymer fibers. Furthermore, metal wires do not have the required properties to be woven effectively for their application in textile structures.10,11 Electrically conductive textiles can be realized from carbon, aluminium, copper, gold and silver coated fibers of cotton, polyester and nylon.2 Due to the inflexibility of gold and other metals, they cannot be utilized in wearable devices. Thus, recent research has focused on the synthesis of new nanostructured fibers to enter into the new era of textiles.
The main aim of weaving carbon fibers into electronic textiles is for them to breathe easily and have enhanced adaptability with electronics embedded in them. Interestingly, carbon nanostructures such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other two-dimensional materials show enhanced electrical and electronic properties, which can be a great compliment in conductive fibers.12–14 Graphene, a monolayer of carbon packed in a honeycomb structure, has found application in flexible electronics and wearable devices with the formation of novel conducting composites, which is attributed to its remarkable properties such as excellent electronic properties, high stiffness together with elastic nature, and high electrical and thermal conductivity.15–19 Graphene-based fibers are more beneficial than its thin film form or nanosheet form when used as electrodes in supercapacitors due to their lower weight and compactness in real-time electronics.20 Special care should be taken in the adsorption and reduction of graphene oxide (GO) since they involve crucial steps that influence the overall properties of the final material or device composed of reduced GO (rGO).21 Moreover, the conductivity of the obtained composite is determined by the homogeneity and thickness of the coating.17 The low density, high conductivity and high tensile strength of CNTs make them interesting for flexible electronic devices.8,22,23 In the literature, there are only a few review articles related to fibers from carbon nanostructures, which have many limitations such as complicated synthetic processes.24–26 Therefore, we tried to organize this review in a systematic way to bring together the synthesis of different carbon-based nanostructured fibers in one report with recent publications and suggestions for the future fibers resulting from new two-dimensional materials for enhanced properties.
The present review details the study of hybrid carbon nanostructured fiber-based materials including different two dimensional (2D) materials and their applications in wearable electronic devices. This review organized as follows: (i) fabrication of fibers, (ii) properties and (iii) wearable device applications. The Fabrication section explains the various techniques adopted in producing composite fibers, including electro-assisted deposition, biscrolling method, chemical vapor deposition, wet chemical process, spinning methods, coating methods, and printing. The demanding applications of composite carbon fibers in electronic textiles, medical applications, wearable energy harvesting, storage, sensors and actuators form the major scope of the present review. Finally, we concluded with perspectives for future research in the field of flexible and wearable electronics. Fig. 1 presents a schematic demonstrating the structure of the present review. The present study is aimed to supplement novel ideas not only for beginners who are aiming to work in this booming area, but also for researchers actively engaged in the field of fiber electronics, dealing with advanced electronics and a wide range of functionalities integrated into textile fibers.

2.1 Electro-assisted deposition
Electro-assisted deposition including different methods such as electrospinning,28,29 electrochemical reduction,30–32 electropolymerization,33–36 electroless deposition,37 electrophoretic deposition,38 electrophoretic self-assembly39 and electrostatic self-assembly40 will be detailed in this section.

2.1.1. Electrospinning method. 
The electrospinning process is an interesting method for the fabrication of continuous thin fibers since it is simple and versatile to achieve fibers of a few nanometers to few tens of micrometers via the electrohydrodynamic phenomenon.28,41,42 Electrospinning involves applying an electric field/high voltage to the tip of a syringe needle containing a polymeric solution.43 The presence of electrostatic forces causes deformation in the polymer solution droplet with an increase in the electric field, which changes the shape of the droplet from hemispherical to conical (also known as Taylor cone). The charge accumulation on the droplet surface resulting from the electric field reduces the surface tension as the critical voltage is attained, thereby resulting in the movement of the elongated fiber towards the grounded target.44 The solvent evaporates during the course of the fiber travelling to the target and the drying process happens at the target. This can supplement the directional shear force with the external electric field for the proper flow of the spinning solution.45 The electric potential applied in the electrospinning process plays a significant role in the twisting or alignment of CNTs in the polymer matrix, and nanofibers of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) can be attained via polymer-based electrospinning.28,29 Hybrid CNT/graphene yarn (5% weight graphene) was continuously synthesized from a CNT web and graphene via electrospinning, as reported by Foroughi et al.,46 which is detailed in Fig. 2A–E. The significance of their work is that different feeding rates of graphene and electro-spraying duration positively influenced the quantity of graphene integrated in the hybrid yarn. The figure shows uniformly oriented nanotubes with the yarn axis and graphene sheets are seen on the surface of the CNT/graphene yarn, resulting in a furrowed surface texture with a porous structure. In our group, we reported the fabrication of a graphene–polymer nanofiber membrane using the electrospinning process toward the realization of ultrafast photonics.47

Matsumoto et al.48 prepared yarns containing graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon from graphene oxide nanoribbon (GONR)/poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) composite nanofibers by electrospinning. PAN and GONR were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) and the polymer solution was taken in a syringe with a stainless steel nozzle (0.2 mm internal diameter) connected to a high-voltage regulated DC power supply. The collector for the electrospun fibers was a rotating disk (diameter of 250 mm, width of 10 mm) with the spinning duration of 20 min. The distance between the nozzle tip and the collector was maintained as 100 mm, the applied voltage as 30 kV, the flow rate as 5 μL min−1 and the rotating speed of the collector as 1000 rpm. The yarns were obtained by twisting the electrospun aligned fibers and the resultant twisted yarns had a diameter of around 50 μm. Furthermore, to improve the mechanical and electrical properties of the composites, a low fraction of GNRs (less than 5 wt%) was added. The prepared nanocarbon composite nanofiber yarns consisted of GONRs with high length-width ratios, average length of about 3 μm and average width of 140 nm, which were synthesized via a nanotube unzipping process.48 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Fig. 2F and G show electrospun fibers with a high orientation of well-dispersed nanoribbons (bead-free and smooth) along the fiber axis owing to the electrified thin liquid jet attained from the electrospinning method. Therefore, the oriented GONRs in PAN nanofibers not only played the role of 1-D nanofillers, but also as a nanoplatelet stabilization promoter and template agent for carbonization. The low weight fraction in the GONRs significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of the composite nanofiber yarns, whereas carbonization significantly enhanced their mechanical and electrical properties.
Unidirectional polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon fiber yarns having different alignments were obtained by electrospinning with different take-up velocities, where the draw ratio, heating rate, temperature and exposure time influenced the ideal oxidation and carbonization of the precursor PAN yarn.49 The electrospinning of TiO2–graphene composite nanofibers using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was also reported.50 Pico et al.51 demonstrated electrospun ruthenium oxide–carbon nanofiber composites as electrode materials for capacitor applications. Carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper fabricated via the electrospinning of PAN diluted in DMF was realized for supercapacitor application.52,53 The resulting PAN-based CNF film was stabilized in air and carbonized in argon for maintaining the flexibility of the film. The thickness of the CNF film could be controlled by tuning the volume of PAN precursor, thereby controlling the volume of CNF during electrospinning. Moreover, a random orientation could be obtained by increasing the content of carbon nanofiber, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and hardness.54


2.1.2. Electrochemical deposition. 
Electrochemical deposition or reduction is adopted in the synthesis of high-performance flexible fibers since it is cheap, simple and allows large-scale production.30,31,55–57 The speed of the motor plays a crucial roles in governing the electrochemical deposition time.30 This method is widely used for the synthesis of flexible supercapacitor electrodes based on graphene and its composites, which are employed in wearable electronics and energy storage applications.58 The synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets aligned vertically on gold substrates via the electrochemical reduction of GO for the realization of electrochemical capacitors (EC) to be used in ac line-filtering was also reported in the literature.56 Graphene fibers (GFs) were also synthesized by electrochemically electrolyzing a GO suspension in lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) to realize stretchable supercapacitors based on GFs, where GFs were adopted as the working electrode with Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.59
Cao et al.30 demonstrated hybrid electrochemically reduced GO (ErGO) coated carbon fibers (ErGO@CFs) attained by electrochemical reduction and deposition method as supercapacitor electrodes (Fig. 2H–K). Fig. 2H depicts the step by step synthesis of ErGO@CFs, where electrochemical deposition of CF in a GO aqueous dispersion occurs with simultaneous GO coating and reduction. The SEM images presented in Fig. 2J and K confirmed the folded, wrinkled structure of the ErGO coating and gully-like porous structure of ErGO on the CF surface. Li et al.55 reported the reduction of GO sheets to conductive ErGO for use as fiber-shaped electrodes in EC, where their performance could be altered by tuning the electrochemical deposition conditions. The obtained ErGO sheets were further deposited onto Au wire that was assembled into three dimensional (3D) interpenetrating networks (30 mm thick), as seen in Fig. 2L and M. Liu et al.31 realized 3D polypyrrole (PPy)-MnO2-SWCNT coated cotton thread multi-grade nanostructures, in which MnO2 nanostructures and PPy film were grown on SWCNT-coated cotton threads via an electrochemical deposition process. Hierarchical nanostructures based on graphene sheets and carbon spheres were also prepared via electrochemical deposition.58 Xie et al.32 reported the homogenous electrochemical deposition of ErGO on conductive nickel nanocone arrays (NCAs), which acted as current collectors for enhancing the performance of the supercapacitor. Interestingly, the self-assembly and reduction of GO resulting in ErGO was achieved using a constant electric field.


2.1.3. Electropolymerization. 
Electropolymerization is one of the synthesis processes used in the fabrication of wearable fabrics. In this method, polymerization occurs on the surface of the fibers, which helps in attaining a homogeneous coating by controlling the weight gain, coating thickness, chemical composition and surface functionalities.60 This method was also used for the synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) to wrap chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene woven fabric (GWF) on copper meshes as an electrode material to enhance the electrochemical properties of the solid-state supercapacitor electrode.33,36 Xu et al.34 reported high-performance electrode CNF/GO/PANI hybrid films via in situ polymerization with different aniline (AN) concentrations. Moreover, the polymerization was performed in an ice-water bath with a temperature of 0 °C to 5 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Flexible graphene/polyaniline composite paper (GPCP) was produced by Wang et al.35via the in situ anodic electropolymerization of AN monomer in PANI on graphene paper (G-paper), where PANI improved the flexibility of the supercapacitor based on a graphene electrode. AN monomer adsorbed on the graphene sheet surface was electropolymerized, resulting in the formation of PANI between the layers of nearby graphene sheets, and the obtained GPCP had a similar layered structure morphology as that of G-paper. The electropolymerization of pyrrole (Py) on GF to achieve GF/PPy asymmetric structures for electrochemical fiber actuators was also demonstrated in the literature.61 The free end of GF fixed onto a nickel rod by means of conducting resins was allowed to float on the surface of Py monomer and NaClO4 solution leading to the partial deposition of PPy on GF by electropolymerizing Py.


2.1.4. Other electro-assisted methods. 
Electroless deposition (ELD),37 electrophoretic deposition (EPD),38 electrophoretic self-assembly,39 and electrostatic self-assembly62 are also utilized in the fabrication of carbon based fibers. ELD is an inexpensive technique since the experimental set-up is simple and the process can be performed in ambient conditions to obtain a large scale yield.37,63 Liu et al.37 realized rGO/Ni cotton yarn composite electrodes via the electroless deposition of Ni and electrochemical deposition of graphene on commercial cotton yarns, and a detailed schematic of the fabrication process is given in Fig. 2N and O. EPD is also an inexpensive fabrication technique for the deposition of various coatings, exhibiting surface homogeneity, high packing density, film thickness control, good deposition rate, absence of binders and easy scaling up.64–67 The EPD method was utilized for the preparation of porous graphene on carbon cloth (PG/CC), which was applied as flexible and binder-free electrodes in flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors (FASSSs).38 The key point for achieving highly porous graphene on CC is the mandatory use of fine-sized graphene. On the other hand, the use of large-sized graphene in the EPD process will lead to a non-porous surface, which is attributed to the graphene covering the carbon cloth (G/CC). Reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (rGONR) fibers derived from the electrophoretic self-assembly method are attractive since this process does not involve any polymer or surfactant.39 The process involved the transformation of gel-phase rGONR fiber into a solid fiber due to solvent evaporation, where a copper plate and graphitic tip separated by 5 mm were used as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Yun et al.62 demonstrated wearable gas sensors based on rGO-decorated yarn (rGOY) from GO wrapping by electrostatic self-assembly with the aid of biomolecule bovine serum albumin (BSA) and low-temperature reduction. The templates of cotton yarn (CY) and polyester yarn (PY) coated with BSA yarn wrapped in GO sheets were further reduced via a low-temperature chemical reduction method.

2.2 Biscrolling method
Nanofibers are well-known additives to introduce new functionalities into yarns, which can be achieved using the biscrolling method. The problems associated with the current methods that use additives incorporated in a fiber matrix or on fiber surfaces are: (i) low loading levels of nanofibers, (ii) the decrease in accessible surface area caused by processing can significantly affect the functionality of nanoparticles (NP) and nanofibers, and (iii) the durability of nanofibers on yarn surfaces may be low.68,69 Without changing their basic structure, nanofibers are difficult to be spun into yarns except solution70,71 and solid-state spun CNTs.72–74 In the biscrolling approach, twist-based spinning of the host material is overlaid with one or more functional guest material (up to 99 weight percent (wt%)), which can be scrolled into a biscrolled yarn.68
Sun et al.8 developed graphene oxide/CNT composite fibers through biscrolling technology by arranging the CNT sheets in a lengthwise direction and adding graphene oxide solution of about 0.025 wt% in water and ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:20, which was scrolled into fibers at a rotating rate of 2000 rpm. To synthesize graphene/CNT fibers, graphene oxide/CNT fibers were immersed in an aqueous solution of 40% hydroiodic acid (HI) at 80 °C for 6 h and subsequently dipped into methanol and dried under vacuum for 12 h. To endow the graphene/CNT fibers with catalytic activity, small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of ∼10 nm were deposited uniformly via a double potential step method with the first step at −0.5 V for 5 s and the second step at 0 V for 30 s at room temperature (RT) (Fig. 3). Kwon et al.75 reported biscrolled highly flexible, easily woven, separator-free CNT yarn-based biofuel cells (BFC), in which the hydrophilic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was responsible for the high loading of enzyme and redox mediator deposited together with poly(ethylene glycol) (400) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) cross-linker, which is illustrated schematically in Fig. 3a. The morphological properties of the as-developed yarn were studied via SEM analysis, as depicted in Fig. 3b–e. As seen from Fig. 3f and g, the anodic catalyst was composed of cross-linked glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme, mediator I and PEGDGE, while the cathodic catalyst contained bilirubin oxidase (BOD), mediator II and PEGDGE. The output current density and stability of the BFC electrodes had a major impact on the optimal cross-linker concentration of the anode and cathode. The biscrolling process involved immersing the host in anodic and cathodic guest solutions, which was further twisted using a low-speed motor to obtain the yarn electrode. The resulting biscrolled yarn electrodes with guest were highly oriented with porous structures, exhibiting vascular-like corridors, which resulted from the guests trapped within the yarn in the scrolled PEDOT/MWCNT sheets, enabling the fast mass transport of glucose and oxygen towards oxidation and reduction inside the yarn electrodes.

Lee et al.76 utilized the gradient biscrolling method to produce fast-ion-transport yarn having hundreds of layers of conducting-polymer-infiltrated CNT sheets, which were made into yarn of 20 μm diameter. The biscrolled yarn was fabricated by twist-based spinning of CNT sheets as the host and one or more other functional materials as the guest of up to 99 wt% in the layer form to scroll the same.68,77 The CVD method was adopted to draw the host material from the carbon MWCNT forest with an outer diameter of ∼9 nm and density of about 1.5 mg cm−3. The biscrolled yarn was fabricated by depositing the guest material onto the host either directly by twist-based spinning from the forest or forest drawn CNT sheets. The guest material can be deposited onto the host using several methods. Among them, the use of an electrostatic powder coating gun is fast and controllable. The other methods include electron beam evaporation, sputtering, aerosol filtration, liquid-dispersed, CVD synthesized boron nitride (BN) NT filters, electrophoretic deposition, and ink-jet printing. The developed bilayer was twisted to form a biscrolled yarn (Fig. 2). The fabrication of the biscrolled yarn was completed by twisting a bilayer guest/sheet stack, resulting in the final yarn. The inserted twisting amount can be determined by the yarn bias angle (30° and 45°), which is described as the angle between the yarn direction and orientation direction of the helically wrapped CNT to the outer yarn surface.68 Cruz-Silva et al.78 synthesized robust and flexible fibers by mechanical/manual scrolling, where free-standing GO films rubbed with tungsten sulfide (WS2) were twisted to yield WS2/GO films and fibers.
2.3 Chemical vapor deposition
Compared to other fabrication methods, CVD is impressive in producing large-area and uniform mono-, bi- and multilayer graphene sheets at the wafer scale, GWF and CNTs.79–88 It involves growth using solid and liquid precursors on a substrate, which can be copper foil, copper mesh, nickel, platinum, iridium, ruthenium, sapphire, mica, silicon and silicon dioxide.84,89–98 CVD grown graphene is highly advantageous in comparison with chemical or mechanically exfoliated graphene or GO sheets since it has a high-quality sp2 structure without any defects and continuous graphene architecture.99 GF was obtained via the self-assembly of CVD-grown graphene films in ethanol, which has a low boiling point and low surface tension.100 Graphene films grown on copper foil by APCVD could be detached from the copper substrate by etching it using FeCl3 solution followed by rinsing in deionized (DI) water. Consequently, the film freely floating on water surface was collected using a planar glass and transferred to ethanol, leading to rolling up of the film edges. The graphene film was then taken out from the ethanol solution and dried to attain a fiber-like structure after the ethanol evaporated, in which the size of GF was significantly controlled by the initial size of the graphene film, drawing rate, etc. An interesting report detailed the CVD synthesis of multi-layer graphene (MLG) and porous carbon (PC) woven composite films on Ni gauze templates.91 The woven copper mesh substrate acted as the template for GWF by mimicking the network configuration of copper mesh and the GWF embedded in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix improved the flexibility and strength on par with CVD grown graphene films.90 PDMS formed a platform to protect the graphene networks from collapsing during the process of dissolving copper to achieve a free-standing GWF composite film. The growth process of GWF can be explained in three steps, as presented in Fig. 3h: (i) graphene growth on copper mesh by CVD, (ii) etching away copper wires using FeCl3/HCl (1:1, mol L−1) aqueous solution and (iii) formation of double-layered GMR by unifying graphene. The morphology of the copper meshes with and without graphene was studied via SEM and TEM analysis, as depicted in Fig. 3i and k, respectively. Fig. 3j demonstrates floating GWF on water and its further transfer to glass and PET. The use of nickel meshes in a similar process instead of copper meshes had some disadvantages, leaving behind residual nickel–carbon compound cores inside the GMRs due to the delayed etching process.89
The characteristics of Ni such as relatively inexpensive, significant solubility of carbon in Ni and high diffusion of C in Ni make it a potential substrate for the CVD growth of graphene. MLG formation, graphene layer thickness and PC capacity can be well controlled with the feeding rates and reaction times of methane. The overall growth process involves various steps including the growth of MLG on nickel mesh, etching nickel wires to form an MLG/PC hybrid and oxidizing the hybrid with acids, leading to the final tree-like structure. The optical image of as-grown composite film and SEM images after it was treated with various acids are presented in Fig. 3l and m. Chen et al.84 established core–sheath composite fibers from a core of aligned undoped CNTs with a sheath of nitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs). The CNT arrays on Fe/Al2O3 coated over a silicon wafer were grown by CVD, where Fe/Al2O3 acted as the catalyst, ethylene as the carbon source, ethylenediamine (EDA) as the carbon–nitrogen source and mixture of Ar and H2 gases as the carrier gas. CNT/PANI composite fiber-based textiles were realized for the application of thin, lightweight, flexible and transparent supercapacitor textiles, in which a spinnable CNT array was grown by CVD.83 In the literature, MWCNT arrays were successfully synthesized via CVD and wound on rubber fibers using a precisely motorized translation stage for photovoltaic textiles.86
Template-based CVD may be a better choice for the synthesis of planar interconnected GWFs. GWF prepared by CVD on copper mesh was realized as a smart self-sensing element in the assembly of a piezoresistor by transferring it to a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate with Ti/Au as electrodes.82 Li et al.89,98 demonstrated atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD)-grown GWF by interlacing two sets of graphene micron-ribbons (GMR), in which the ribbons passed each other at right angles. During CVD growth, carbon was obtained by decomposing methane, and graphene was grown on interconnecting copper wires to form a copper mesh with different line widths and spacings. Yang et al.101 reported the fabrication of a graphene-based electromechanical sensor from GWF on copper mesh using APCVD templated growth. The increase in concentration of CH4 from 30 mL min−1 to 50–200 mL min−1 yielded a thicker GWF of more than 10 layers compared to that of the GWF having 2–8 layers at the CH4 concentration of 30 mL min−1. Owing to its ultra-high sensitivity, the CVD-grown GWF on copper mesh also found application in strain sensors for sound signal acquisition/recognition and human motion monitoring.102,103 Liu et al.85 prepared GF/PDMS composites via CVD on Ni foam towards the fabrication of GWFs on Ni woven fabrics composited with the help of infiltrating epoxy into graphene/Ni woven fabrics. The Ni templates were etched off using a 0.5 M FeCl3/1 M HCl mixture at 80 °C for 2 h, resulting in freestanding GWFs, which were collected by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) thin films. The number of graphene layers in the GWFs was tuned by the feed rates of CH4 from 0.5 to 3.0 vol%.85
2.4 Wet chemical processes
The present section presents the different wet chemical processes adopted for the fabrication of fibers.

2.4.1. Hydro-/solvothermal methods. 
Hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches are simple wet chemical methods having advantages such as cost-effectiveness, simplicity and large-scale production, which are widely exploited for growing materials in high-temperature aqueous solutions at high vapour pressures.104 Autoclaves and pressure vessels are most commonly used in hydrothermal synthesis and few studies also reported the use of fused silica capillary columns having better high-temperature and pressure tolerance to replace autoclaves.105,106 In 2015,107 the synthesis of RuO2·xH2O@CF electrodes via the vapor-phase hydrothermal method was reported for the fabrication of a wearable fiber power system that could harvest and store energy out of human motion. The synthetic process involved cleaning carbon fibers by ultrasonication in acetone, ethanol and DI water, which were further coated with an RuCl3 slurry and dried at 60 °C. The obtained product in NaOH solution was placed in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave to obtain RuO2·xH2O@CF. Hydrothermally synthesized activated carbon (AC) fibers tow and MoS2 nanosheet (ACFTs/MoS2) yarns were used to form coaxial yarn electrodes in the literature.108 The hydrothermal method was also adopted for obtaining an MnO2/graphene/polyester composite electrode, and tuning the reaction time controlled the morphology of MnO2.109 A VO2/graphene composite synthesized via an in situ hydrothermal process from graphene oxide and V2O5 was reported by Shi et al.110 Recently, an interesting work was demonstrated by the synthesis of hydrothermal graphene for in situ coverage of a non-planar substrate, i.e., copper wire towards the successful formation of rGO aerogel around Cu wire (rGO@Cu wire).111 The direct hydrothermal reaction of the Ni-coated yarn in GO aqueous solution for obtaining rGO film was also reported.112 Our group synthesized wall-like hierarchical metal oxide MMoO4 (M = Ni and Co) nanosheet arrays on flexible carbon cloth using the hydrothermal method, which were used as advanced binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors.113
Yu et al.104 established an interesting approach for the constant generation of SWNT/rGO fibers by employing a silica capillary column operating similarly to a hydrothermal microreactor, as depicted in Fig. 4A. A similar hydrothermal method was also used to obtain undoped rGO/SWCNT all-carbon fibers and in situ nitrogen doping using the urea precursor for attaining capacitive-type fibers.114 Moreover, GO is also a good surfactant for dispersing SWCNTs; whereas, SWCNTs prevent the restacking of GO sheets to easily obtain a homogenous aqueous suspension. The prepared suspension of GO and SWCNT was placed in a silicon column with the ends sealed and allowed to react at 220 °C for 6 h. Finally, the pulling of continuous fibers into a water reservoir was performed with the aid of a pressurized nitrogen flow. Fig. 4B and C shows photographs of the 0.5 m long fiber having a diameter of 50 mm. From Fig. 4D and E, it can be seen that stacking between the rGO layers together with excellent porosity was achieved by the introduction of aligned SWCNTs. Graphene fibers from GO were obtained via a dimensionally confined hydrothermal strategy in a glass pipeline (0.4 mm in inner diameter), where the produced GF matched the geometry of the pipe.115 Interestingly, the glass pipeline with predesigned length and inner diameter together with the initial GO concentration played an important role in tuning the diameter and length of the fiber. Cai et al.116 reported a solvothermal method for synthesizing GFs coated by NiCo2S4 NPs (GF/NiCo2S4), where the NiCo2S4 NPs were anchored on the GFs surface.

2.4.2. Other wet chemical methods. 
Experimental studies have demonstrated various simple wet chemical methods for the synthesis of carbon-based fibers. The modified Hummers’ method is usually utilized for the synthesis of graphene sheets by reducing GO with hydrazine from graphite powder and also to produce graphene oxide.117 Chemical unzipping is the opening of nanotubes along a line, i.e., unzipping leading to straight-edged ribbons, which can be performed in either a linear longitudinal cut or a spiraling manner based on two parameters such as initial site of attack and chiral angle of the nanotube, as clearly demonstrated in Fig. 4F.118 The fabrication of carbon nanofiber yarn (CNFY) using precursor PAN was achieved via a modified solution blowing process with a pair of parallel rods at a distance of 40 cm from the top rod and the spinning die, which played the role of collector and kept parallel to the spinning line for collecting the nanofiber, as schematically shown in Fig. 4G.119 The different steps are as follows: formation of manganate ester, buttressing ketones to distort the b,c-alkenes for them to easily undergo the next permanganate attack, bond-angle strain induced by enlarging the hole causes the b,c-alkenes to be more reactive, initiation of tube opening, conversion of ketones to carboxylic acid to line the edges of the nanoribbons and relieve the bond-angle strain for opening the nanotube to graphene ribbon. Fig. 4H portrays the morphology of the as-fabricated CNFY. González et al.120 reported graphene nanoribbon sheets via chemical unzipping of the aligned nanotubes.
Lu et al.121 presented a repeated coating-reduction approach for immobilizing graphene nanosheets on silk. The process involved the following steps, as given in Fig. 4I: (i) self-assembly of negatively charged GO nanosheets on the silk surface, (ii) removal of loosely attached graphene nanosheets by washing with DI water and (iii) adsorption and reduction of GO, as confirmed by the color change of the silk fabric from white-brown-black. The coating-reduction procedure can be repeated to increase the number of graphene nanosheets immobilized on the silk fabric. In the communication by Peng et al.,122 CNT/silica composite fibers were obtained by chemical modification of pure CNT fibers and two silica precursors, (i) (EtO)3Si(CH2)3NCO and (ii) (EtO)3Si(CH2)3NH2via two different approaches. The approach involved the direct casting of the precursor ((i) or (ii)) over the CNT surface via spinning and evaporation of the solvents. The second method involved hydrogen bonding of the precursor (ii) to CNTs by chemically modifying the outer surface of the CNTs. The spinnable CNT arrays were produced in quartz tube with ethylene as the carbon source and Ar in 6% H2 as the carrier gas, where sputtering/ion-beam deposited Fe (0.3–1.0 nm)/Al2O3 (10 nm) on SiO2 (thickness of 1 μm)/Si wafers acted as the catalyst. Li et al.123 synthesized G/MnO2 composites via a facile chemical method using a graphene film self-assembled in ethanol, resulting in a film-to-fiber transformation. The four-step process presented in Fig. 4J–N, which can be described as follows: (a) free-standing CVD-grown graphene film drifts on the surface of water, (b) grasping the graphene film to position it on the ethanol surface results in curling of the graphene film edges so that it sinks into the solvent, (c) graphene film is taken out of ethanol using tweezers, which that converts into a fiber-like structure after the ethanol evaporated and (d) drying of graphene fiber to secure a monolithic structure. The SEM image of the resulting fiber is displayed in Fig. 4N.
Cai et al.116 employed a chemical reduction-induced self-assembly (CRS) method to grow GFs from GO and ascorbic acid (AA) placed in a sealed silicone tubing reactor at a low temperature of 80 °C in a water bath. AA acted both as a reducing agent and gelating agent. Furthermore, the amount of raw materials and length of the silicone tubing determined the quantity of synthesized GFs. A low-temperature (LT) hydriodic (HI) acid reduction method was reported for the reduction of rGOCY from GOCY.40 Additionally, the solution blowing method has been emerged as a reasonable method in nanofiber fabrication technology due to its easy handling and high productivity, in which a polymer solution can be blown by gas flowing in high speed, acting as the driving force to yield ultrathin jets and nanofibers.124,125 The capillary containing the spinning solution accompanied by a high speed air-flow was directed to the surrounded annular nozzle. The PAN solution was accelerated, stretched and substantially bent by the air-flow, resulting in the high yield of nanofibers and subsequent formation of yarns having an average diameter of 280 nm and width of about 600 μm.

2.5 Spinning processes
Graphene and carbon nanotubes have been used as base materials to spin continuous conducting fibers with diameters of micrometers and hundreds of meters of length either by dry or wet spinning processes for the fabrication of promising electrode materials.126 The studies on wet spinning, dry spinning and other spinning processes will be discussed in detail in the present section.

2.5.1. Wet spinning process. 
Wet spinning is an excellent method for realizing graphene-based fibers (GBFs), CNTs, and GO from graphene-based liquid crystals or dispersions, which yields materials with excellent flexibility, good electrical conductivity, and ultra-strong and improved mechanical properties.17,20,115,127–139 The principle behind the wet spinning process is that the doping solution present in the stainless steel dope pot is forced by nitrogen gas to flow through the spinneret dipped in coagulation solvent.140 Subsequently, the fiber spun into the coagulation bath is removed. However, there are a few constraints in the performance of this method since it requires good control over the formulation in the spinning dope dispersions and coagulation bath conditions to attain the desired fiber morphology.17 The diameter of GBFs can be tuned with the spinning nozzle and continuous long fibers can be extracted at RT using the wet spinning process, which is simple and green without the use of toxic and corrosive solvents.141 The different processing parameters involved in wet spinning include viscosity of spinning solution, its composition, concentration and injection rate, drawing applied during spinning, width of the syringe outlet, rotation speed of the coagulation bath, and concentration and temperature of the coagulation bath, and hence, optimization plays a crucial role in this process.142,143
Wet spinning has been demonstrated to be a good candidate for the fabrication of graphene fibers,135,144–147 porous aerogel fibers,128 hollow graphene fibers,148 montmorillonite (MMT)-graphene fibers,149 GO fibers,150 and nacre-mimetic graphene/polymer composite fibers135,151–154 that are flexible, strong, lightweight, electrically conductive and chemically resistive with widespread applications in flexible multifunctional textiles, supercapacitors and wearable electronics. Wet spinning of PVA-coated chemically reduced graphene (CRG) (CRG@PVA) by Kou and Gao151 yielded continuous nacre-mimicking fibers up to kilometers in length having well-aligned brick and mortar microstructures with CRG as hard bricks and PVA as the sticky mortar, which is detailed schematically in Fig. 5A–D. Fig. 5E demonstrates the flexibility of the as-spun fiber, which was used to make a knot. Wet spun sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-wrapped GO coaxial fibers (GO@CMC) were fabricated using aqueous GO as the inner spinning dope and CMC as the outer spinning dope, which were injected into the coagulating bath of ethanol/water with CaCl2, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 5F.155 Photographs of the as-spun fiber before and after the chemical reduction are presented in Fig. 5G and H, respectively. Further, its polarized-light optical microscopy image is shown in Fig. 5I.

To enhance the conductivity of GFs, highly conductive CNTs were incorporated in them to prepare composite fibers. Ma et al.156 prepared wet-spun CNT-GO composite fibers employing a chitosan/acetic acid coagulation bath. Wet spinning of CNTs/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) involved the use of a coagulant bath consisting of 17% sodium sulfate aqueous solution.142 Behabtu et al.136 demonstrated wet spun high-quality CNT fibers using a chlorosulfonic acid coagulation bath. In the communication by Meng et al.,157 an SWCNT and chitosan (CHI) composite yarn (SWNT@CHI) was prepared via the wet spinning method. Wet spinning employs an acid as the solvent and standard coagulants such as water.158 Most reports utilized a coagulation bath of CaCl2-aqueous ethanol solution for wet spinning.17,20,141,147,159 Cellulose/graphene composite fibers were attained via wet spinning using a coagulation bath solution of H2SO4, Na2SO4 and ZnSO4.160Fig. 5J depicts the studies showing the synthesis of electroconductive cellulose-CNTs fibers spun from a common and cheap NaOH/urea solution.138 The SEM images of the as-spun fibers are presented in Fig. 5K and L. Sun et al.161 achieved rGO–MoS2 hybrid fibers using a saturated ethanolic KOH solution as the coagulation bath. Coagulation baths of manganese acetate (Mn(Ac)2) in ethanol–water and CaCl2 in ethanol–water were engaged in the wet spinning synthesis of graphene fibers and graphene–CNT hybrid fibers (GCF), respectively.147 GO fibers spun with CaCl2 were found to have better mechanical properties (Young's modulus, Y = ∼5.4 GPa, tensile strength, σ = ∼62.9 MPa, breaking strain, ε = ∼6.1%, and toughness, T = ∼2.9 MJ m−3) than that using KOH (Y = ∼2.9 GPa, σ = ∼41.2 MPa, ε = ∼3.6%, and T = ∼1.0 MJ m−3).162 The wet spinning process was used for the synthesis of NaAlg/GO fibers, where calcium chloride solution was adopted as the coagulation bath.163 Different concentrations of ultrasonicated GO suspensions and NaAlg solution were stirred for 3 h, resulting in different NaAlg/GO ratios. Subsequently, the obtained solution was squeezed through a needle and drawn to the coagulation bath at RT for spinning fibers.
Gopalsamy et al.20 demonstrated wet spun Bi2O3 NTs loaded giant graphene fibers (Bi2O3 NT-GGO) using a liquid crystal self-templating approach. GGO fibers were also prepared by wet spinning using hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and ethyl acetate as coagulation systems.135,143 Xu et al.129 used GGO spinning dopes injected into rotating coagulation baths with ethanol/water solutions of KOH, CaCl2 and CuSO4 to obtain ultra-strong fibers. Gao et al. reported the wet spinning of graphene fibers from GO liquid crystals.127,129,141,155 Coaxial wet-spinning assembly provides the opportunity to form polyelectrolyte-wrapped graphene fibers that can overcome the risk of short circuiting, giving rise to safe wearable electronic devices. Hundreds of meters of continuous macroscopic fibers were spun from liquid crystal solutions of GONRs and chemically reduced GNRs (CGNRs) in chloro-sulfonic acid with ether as the coagulation bath.164 Wet-spinning of GO fibers by maintaining a large sheet size with high interlayer spacing between graphene sheets using acetone, CaCl2 and NaOH as coagulation baths with the use of single-filament fiber-spinning and multi-filament spinning adopting a multiorifice spinneret was also demonstrated in the literature.130 Xiang et al.165 attained efficient and stable drawings of GO fibers via continuous wet spinning from high concentrations of viscous dope together with an appropriate coagulation solvent for overcoming the issue of low tensile modulus. They presented two types of GO flakes, namely large flake GO (LFGO) 22 μm in average diameter and small flake GO (SFGO) 9 μm in diameter, which were extruded at a rate of 0.1 mL min−1. Wet spun GO/chitosan fibers were prepared from chitosan powder and GO with a coagulation bath of 2 M aqueous solution of NaOH.166 Ding et al.167 demonstrated the continuous spinning of graphene/polypyrrole (G/PPy) composite fibers. The wet spinning process allows CNTs with good compatibility to be spun with other functional materials for better performance, and therefore, SWCNTs/PANI nanowires (NWs) composite yarns were attained for supercapacitors.168
The difference between the two spinning methods of wet spinning and dry-jet wet spinning can be explained as follows:162 (i) spinning concentration: wet-spinning functions well with GO concentrations below 10 mg mL−1; whereas, dry-jet wet spinning gives good results at and above a concentration of 10 mg mL−1, (ii) spinnability with spinneret nozzle diameter: wet spinning uses spinneret sizes ranging from 34 to 21 gauge for nozzle diameters of 0.08 to 0.51 mm, and dry-jet wet spinning employs very fine spinnerets (>30 gauge and nozzle diameter <0.16 mm) to overcome droplet formation issues, as clearly shown in Fig. 5M–S. Seyedin et al.162 produced GO fibers using a dry-jet wet spinning method, which enabled the synthesis of densely packed fibers having near-circular cross-sections and highly ordered GO domains. Their experiments compared different concentrations of GO dispersions, and various coagulation bath formulations with KOH or CaCl2 in either pure or mixed solvents (water, ethanol, and isopropanol) for understanding the spinnability in diverse fiber spinning configurations. Non-liquid-crystal spinning is a simple, scalable wet spinning-based method to produce continuous graphene fibers. Based on the jet stretch ratio during spinning, the resultant fibers have a bark-like fine microstructure and divergent-shaped cross-sections with locally aligned dense pores.169 A schematic of this spinning process is given in Fig. 5T. The jet stretch ratio, R, is the ratio of the stretching velocity to the injection velocity of the flow. A GO dispersion is first injected into glacial acetic acid placed in a rotating Petri dish using a spinneret 27 G hollow needle having an internal diameter of 210 μm at a velocity of 1.5 m min−1. The rotation speed can be tuned to 0.8, 1.6 and 2.4 rpm according to the R values of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. Finally, the wet fibers drawn vertically along the long infrared heater are wound onto a polytetrafluoroethylene pipe. Fig. 5U and V present photographs of the fabrics woven using the as-spun fibers in the flat and bent forms, respectively.


2.5.2. Dry spinning process. 
The dry spinning process is mainly employed in the synthesis of CNT fibers from CVD-grown CNT arrays.170–177 The strong van der Waals interaction between CNTs play a crucial role in the formation of yarn, and the clean surfaces of the CNTs during CVD growth form the foundation for the controlled synthesis of super-aligned CNT arrays.176 With the optimized interactions, these fibers can be made to withstand strain by overcoming the necking and stress concentration around the defects in the fibers. Ryu et al.171 reported an ultra-high stretchable and wearable device from dry spun CNT fibers attached to the surfaces of Ecoflex substrates due to van der Waals interactions. Atkinson et al.178 demonstrated an automated continuous CNT yarn spinning machine that functioned based on the principle of flyer spinning proposed by Leonardo da Vinci.179 This involves twisting and winding operations using two coaxial shafts rotating at differential speeds so that the yarns become wound onto the yarn bobbin attached to the twisting spindle.180 Wearable electronic textiles from core/sheath-structured CNT yarn were produced on a flyer spinner, where the platinum monofilament (25 μm diameter) core drawn out from the supply bobbin was combined with a CNT web.181 Core/sheath structured yarn was obtained by wrapping a CNT web around the filament resulting from the twisting action of the spindle, making the Pt filament and CNT web rotate together, as detailed in Fig. 6F and G. The SEM images of the Pt/CNT/PANI yarn core/sheath regions after polish-milling and as-produced core-spun Pt/CNT yarn are shown in Fig. 6H and I.

CNT dry-spun yarn from the up-spinning method based on the principle of spinning the feedstock showed an extremely high Poisson's ratio.173,182 A CNT forest attached to the spindle was rotated at high speeds for spreading it on the bobbin. Zhang et al.74 introduced twist during spinning of MWCNT fibers from CNT forests to realize torque-stabilized yarns with strength greater than 460 MPa. The interesting point is that these MWCNT single yarns retained the twist even after the yarn ends were released, with enhanced locking of the twist owing to their high interfiber contact area per yarn volume as a consequence of the high surface-to-volume ratio of MWCNTs. Studies also demonstrated CNT fibers drawn from MWCNT forests with the help of tweezers to contact the sidewall, which were further hand-drawn at a speed of ∼50 cm min−1.177 The obtained fibers were physically twisted by a motorized drive at 500 rpm and passed through ethanol to achieve permanent twisting. Zheng et al.183 spun continuous fibers (10 cm long) from CNT cotton using a speed-adjustable drill having a metal tip coated with a layer of glue for initial attachment to a CNT sliver. Subsequently, the drill, rotating at a speed of 1000–2000 rpm, was pulled from the CNT cotton at the rate of 10 mm min−1. Foroughi et al.184 performed post-spinning of conductive MWCNT/PEDOT nanocomposite fibers over wet-spun fibers, in which liquid crystallite graphene oxide was formed on pre-formed MWCNT sheets and/or PEDOT-coated fibers coagulated with CaCl2.


2.5.3. Other spinning processes. 
The coagulation spinning technique is a simple method for assembling SWCNT into extremely long ribbons and fibers. This process involves three steps, including dispersing the nanotubes in surfactant, construction of nanotube mesh by recondensing them in a flow of a polymer solution and formation of nanotube fibers by collating the obtained mesh.70 The significant factor is the flow-induced alignment, which causes the nanotubes in the mesh to be oriented in the form of ribbons. Vigolo et al.70 obtained rigid fibers and ribbons of preferentially oriented SWCNTs with an elastic modulus 10 times greater than that of high-quality bucky paper. A report on the growth of fibrous nanocomposites of CNTs, GO and graphene via PVA-based coagulation spinning technique used acid to assist the coagulation.185 A coaxial two-capillary spinning strategy using a coaxial two-capillary spinneret was employed for the mass production of morphology-defined graphene-based hollow fibers (HFs) and necklace-like HFs of graphene oxide with desirable functionalities (see Fig. 6A).148 The spinneret was formed by introducing a stainless-steel needle into a branched glass tube with a capillary tip. A glass tube filled with a high concentration of GO suspension through the branch was used for effective coagulation during continuous spinning into the bath of KCl/methanol solution.127,129 The stainless-steel needle was attached to the syringe-containing coagulation bath and the application of air pressure to the branch propelled GO from the spinneret into the bath solution. Simultaneously, the flow of the coagulation solution from the core capillary was governed at an appropriate rate with the help of an injection pump to ensure the continuous synthesis of 1 meter GO-HFs within 30 s at a production rate of 3.3 cm s−1, as presented in Fig. 6B–E.148
Huang et al.186 synthesized graphene fibers via a hydrogel-assisted spinning method, in which GO suspensions were mixed with sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) to give NaDC-functionalized GO sheets dispersed well in an NaDC-hydrated matrix, resulting in the formation of a spinnable supramolecular hydrogel. The GO hydrogel was loaded into a plastic syringe and injected into ethanol for dissolving NaDC, and GO sheets were assembled to yield GO fibers due to van der Waals interactions. Jiang et al.187 followed a new approach called gel-desiccation (heat-aided spinning process) for the preparation of GO/polyacrylic acid (PAA) fibers via an esterification reaction. A homogenous solution of acrylic acid and initiator was prepared by dissolving them in GO aqueous solution under ultrasonication. The resultant fibers with situ cross-linking of GO with PAA were obtained via the esterification reaction between the hydroxyl groups of GO and carboxyl groups of PAA. Spinning by a spindle having a microprobe at the top was also used to attain CNT fibers from CNT arrays. The significant step is to retrieve the CNT ribbons from the substrate, which will be contacted by the microprobe for further pulling out of CNT fibers. The spinning process carried out under an optical microscope since tuning the initial ribbon width could possibly control the diameter of the fiber.

2.6 Wet and dry coating processes

2.6.1. Dipping and drying method. 
The dipping and drying process is a simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method used on the industrial scale for the large-area formation of conductive carbon-based fibers, which is a convenient process with several advantages.112,188–192 This process was adopted for the coating of GO on Kelkar supercapacitor electrodes, GO on cotton fabric, GO on non-woven fabric, GO on mica, GO on nylon, GO on nylon Lycra, GO on aramid fibers/polyester/wool/glass fibers, GO on PPy–rGO coated fabric composite, GO on PET, graphene nanoribbon on cotton fabric, graphene on carbon fiber, MnO2 paste on carbon fibers, CNT on cotton thread, SWCNT on cotton sheet/woven polyester fabric and GWF on PDMS15,98,112,191,193–210 The deposition of rGO flakes onto the fiber then drying on the substrate is due to the fact that the fiber surface is more hydrophilic than the substrate, thereby acting as the preferential deposition site in which rGO flakes settle and stack in a layer-by-layer fashion. This process was also used for the fabrication of aramid fibers, polyester, cotton, nylon, wool, and glass fibers to show its adaptability for different material systems and to induce electrical conductivity.203 The preparation of graphene oxide/cotton fabric (GO/CF) by dipping and drying started with dipping a clean CF substrate into a GO suspension, followed by drying at 90 °C for the removal of redundant water.211 Specifically, an increase in the dipping number resulted in a higher mass loading of GO sheets. The studies by Hu et al.207 showed the fabrication of flexible conductive textiles from aqueous SWCNT ink on cellulose cotton textile substrates. The increase in conductivity could be controlled by factors such as the SWCNT ink concentration and dipping number. The mechanical flexibility and large binding energy of SWCNT with textile fibers provoked their conformal coating.
Immobilizing GO on cotton fabric was carried out via the dip and dry method, where the conductivity of the fabrics was influenced by different parameters, such as reducing agent (NaBH4, N2H4, C6H8O6, Na2S2O4 and NaOH), its concentration, reduction time and number of coating cycles.212 A GO dispersion having a concentration of 0.05% was bath-sonicated for 60 min, where the cotton fabric was soaked for 30 min at RT followed by drying at 90 °C for 30 min. Since the pad-dry technique is a simple, scalable and cost-effective method, it was adopted for realizing graphene-based wearable e-textiles by chemically reducing GO to form stable rGO.213 Zhong et al.189 used dipping and drying for the fabrication of CNT-coated cotton thread (CCT), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and PTFE with CNT-coated cotton thread (PCCT). CCT was obtained by coating CNT ink on cotton threads dried at 80 °C in an oven, which was later immersed in a PTFE solution for 30 s and subsequent drying at 60 °C for 5 min. Reports showed that the attachment of an SWCNT dispersion in water to nylon fabric could be achieved via a simple immersing–drying process.214 A dip and dry-coated textile structured counter electrode from low cost, lightweight, Pt and metal-free, flexible rGO-coated cotton fabric was reported in the literature.195 With an increase in dip and dry cycles, the surface resistance value decreased to 114 Ω sq−1. Zhao et al.159 formed a PVA gel layer dip-coated onto axial graphene fiber (AGF), and PVA-coated AGF was further dipped into CaCl2-GO solution to obtain a GO gel layer. Supercapacitor electrodes such as PANI-coated carbon fiber thread and functionalized carbon fiber thread electrodes were coated by PVA-H3PO4 gel with subsequent drying at RT.215 Yu et al.216 reported the fabrication of a solid-state supercapacitor using two chemically converted graphene-coated stainless steel fabric electrodes dipped in hot H2SO4/PVA solution for 15 minutes followed by drying at RT for 12 h. Cheng et al.217 demonstrated etched polyurethane (PU) core fiber and polyester fibers (PDCY) after air plasma treatment, which resulted in a ripple-like texture on polyester fibers due to the formation of oxygen-containing polar groups. The above-mentioned PDCY dip-coated with GO (PDCY–GO) was soaked in hydroiodic acid to obtain rGO-coated fiber (PDCY–rGO).


2.6.2. Other coating methods. 
GO-coated cotton cloth (CC) textile was realized from GO ink painted on carbon cloth via the brush-coating technique and was subjected to drying in an oven at 150 °C for 10 min.218 The evaporation of water caused the GO sheets to create an entangled random network on the textile fibers. Xiang et al.219 reported the fabrication of conductive carbon material-coated Kevlar fibers via layer-by-layer spray coating of PU and CNTs/GNRs onto Kevlar fibers, where PU acted as the interlayer between the Kevlar fibers and carbon materials for the purpose of binding. The steps involved in the process are as follows: (i) sonication of SWCNTs and O-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous dispersion, (ii) pouring SWCNT/ODCB solution into an airbrush cup connected to a nitrogen tank to regulate the gas pressure for spraying, (iii) controlling the spray rate by tuning the nitrogen flow rate, (iv) heating the fibers on a hot plate to 200 °C, (v) spraying SWCNT/ODCB solution on fibers, resulting in coating of SWCNTs on the surface of fibers upon the evaporation of ODCB and (vi) removal of coated fibers from the hot plate and cooling for 1 h. The coating process was the same for both MWCNTs and GNRs. Interestingly, uniform coatings were achieved by maintaining the spray rate, and the spraying process should be performed inside a well-ventilated fume hood.219
Spray coating was also adopted for coating MWCNTs onto carbon microfiber (CMF) bundles owing to the resulting homogeneous deposition and high mechanical adhesion compared to that from the dipping method.52 CMF was spread on paper in a solution of DI water and isopropyl alcohol to improve the uniform coating of MWCNTs and the paper was slowly removed from the solution to overcome the aggregation of CMF. The MWCNTs dispersed in sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDDBs) solution coated on the CMF surface were dipped in HNO3 for the removal of NaDDBs and washed several times with deionized water. Fabric electrode-based supercapacitors from low-cost carbon materials, such as carbon powder and poly-cotton fabric (polyester cotton) substrates, were demonstrated via the spray coating process.220 Wu et al.221 realized a polyester/Ag NW/graphene core–shell structure using commercial textiles blade-coated with Ag NW/graphene sheets. Xue et al.142 demonstrated electrically conductive yarns from CNTs and PVA on 100% cotton yarn, silk yarn, wool/nylon mixed yarn, polyester yarn and polypropylene yarn via coating processes. The substrate yarns were first immersed in PVA/CNTs solution and dried under ambient conditions. The bar coating and drying method can be used to prepare large-area GO thin films from water/GO dispersions, where the GO aqueous slurry spread by bar coating using a Teflon bar is dried and lifted off carefully to form free-standing thin GO films.78

2.7 Printing processes
The binder-free printing technique is an excellent candidate not only due to its compatibility with heat-sensitive substrates such as papers and textiles, but also due to the resulting high conductivity and mechanical flexibility.222 This technique is also scalable as an industrial-scale screen printing process. To achieve a continuous film, binders such as polymeric, epoxy, siloxane, and resin should be present in conductive ink for a regular process since it is difficult to form granular powders without the linkages of binders.222 Moreover, high-temperature thermal annealing is necessary for the proper decomposition or evaporation of the binders. However, currently, the major problem of utilizing graphene ink printing on flexible substrates (paper/textiles) is that it is very sensitive to high-temperature processing. Moreover, the insulating binders also degrade the conductivity of the ink. Huang et al.222,223 produced light-weight, cost-effective printed graphene with excellent conductivity and enhanced flexibility using a binder-free printing technique combined with rolling compression to overcome the limitations of the conventional process of high-temperature processing and low conductivity. The conducting ink, which was composed of graphene nanoflakes, dispersants and solvents coated onto a substrate, was dried at 100 °C for 10 minutes to volatize the solvents. The robust and flexible free-standing graphene coating formed an effective adhesive coating on the substrate although binders were not used.224 The highly porous graphene coating was subjected to rolling compression for further improvement of its conductivity and adhesion to make it highly dense. Furthermore, the graphene nanoflakes dispersed in the surfactant N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) formed a uniform 10 wt% graphene ink, where NMP enhanced the dispersion of graphene flakes and viscosity, resulting in a uniform film. By adjusting the space between two rollers, the compression ratio and thickness of the samples could be controlled, where a fixed roller distance guaranteed high reproducibility.
Screen printing is another traditional printmaking technique, which is material efficient for the fast coating of large surface areas with small varying carbon mass impregnated into the fabrics.225,226 In contrast, the conventional dip coating process does not allow the impregnation of a significant amount of carbon into the fabric structure, resulting in non-uniform coating. Jost et al.225 impregnated porous carbon materials into woven cotton and polyester fabrics (2 × 2 cm2 swatches) aligned on a PTFE plate via screen printing. The thermally controlled transfer printing technique is a “heating and cooling” process that can perform multiple patterned-graphene transfers with high transfer yields at desired locations or substrates such as graphene prepatterns, hydrophilic surfaces and superhydrophobic surfaces by making use of the thermal-expansion mismatch between the viscoelastic sacrificial layer and the elastic stamp.227 The high-fidelity multiple transfer printing technique was proposed by Choi et al.227 towards realizing transparent and wearable all-graphene multifunctional electronic systems by adopting thermal treatment sequences and viscoelastic sacrificial polymers with elastomeric stamps. The resistance-controlled multi-stacked graphene consisting of non-patterned graphene monolayers stacked over the graphene grown on the Cu foil was patterned by photolithography to obtain the desired features/designs. The viscoelastic sacrificial layer of polyisobutylene (PIB) was coated on patterned graphene, where the conformal contact was obtained by PDMS stamp. FeCl3 solution etched the Cu foil leaving behind the graphene/PDMS stamp. Fig. 6N depicts the transfer process by heating the stamp/patterned-graphene/substrate to 100 °C followed by subsequent cooling to −20 °C and returning to room temperature.
2.8 Other methods of fabrication
The dyeing approach is a novel method towards the mass production of graphene-based networks over the surface of fabric.228 Due to its simplicity, the dyeing technique has been adopted by humans over decades to decorate clothing by immersing fabrics in liquid dyes. It has an interesting ability to incorporate nanopowder into porous, light and flexible embroidered layers, which it very difficult to achieve via spin coating or vacuum coating.229 Fugetsu et al.228 used GO as dyestuffs by immobilizing it on the surfaces of acrylic yarns at ambient temperature of about 296 K and relative humidity of 53% for 15 min. To convert GO to graphene, the GO-dyed yarns were treated with aqueous sodium hydrosulfite solution at ∼363 K for 30 min. The obtained graphene exhibited a graphite colour with an electrically conductive thin layer on each yarn of the fabric and excellent wash fastness. An interesting piece of work presented graphene and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanopowder-based embroidered patch antennas with improved conductivity using a simple dyeing process.229 The dyeing solution containing graphene and ZnO nanopowder was bath-sonicated for 2 h, which was used for dipping the embroidered patch layers for 30 seconds. The resistance effect was imparted to graphene and ZnO by repeating the dyeing process 5 times and 11 times, respectively. Di et al.230 established an incandescent tension annealing process for stabilizing both twisted and coiled CNT yarns with an improved yarn modulus and yarn strength. This process involved heating twist-spun MWCNT yarn (20 cm long) wrapped around two molybdenum electrodes (500 μm diameter) to ∼2000 °C under vacuum at 5.5 × 10−6 bar with applied tensile stress at the yarn end using various sized weights. The significance of this method is the high stress applied to the yarn, resulting in rupturing of the yarn.
The scalable and cost-effective interface trapping method described by Woltornist et al.231,232 was useful for realizing fabric from pristine few-layer graphene (FLG)/graphite from natural bulk graphite with enhanced electrical conductivity (EC) and without the need for any additives or surfactants or chemical modification of graphite. Furthermore, sonication of graphite in a water/heptane mixture was carried out to attain continuous films (one to four layers thick) at the interface between two immiscible liquids by reducing the high interfacial energy of the two solvent phases. FLG climbs the hydrophilic surfaces in contact with heptane vapor. The basic mechanism behind this method is that the created system consists of graphite in a thermodynamically unstable arrangement and a high-energy system made of oil and water interfaces. The graphene sheets positioned at these interfaces reduce the energy of the system, which drives exfoliation and coating of hydrophilic surfaces having thin water layers. Electromagnetic shielding (EM) fabrics were synthesized via knife-over-roll coating from CNTs, conductive polymer and metal NPs, in which the conductive fillers were exerted on nonwoven and knitted fabrics.233 Homogenous coating dispersions of polyacrylate binders, thickeners, non-ionic surfactants and PVP were achieved by stirring and ultrasonication. The coating paste was coated along the fabric using a knife/blade, where the height and velocity of the knife controlled the quantity and thickness of the applied coating on the fabric. Jost et al.234 reported knitted carbon fibers and activated carbon ink-based textile supercapacitors. Zhang et al.235 developed an intrinsically conductive knitted fabric using a 12-needle hand circular knitting machine for electrical resistive strain gauge with continuous stainless steel and short carbon fibers as candidate materials. PAN or other material-based carbon fibers were subjected to low heat treatment (200 °C to 300 °C) under tension in an oxidative atmosphere to make it thermally stable for the high temperature carbonization process at 1000 °C in an inert N2 atmosphere. Laser-assisted reduction of GO into graphene is an effective method to achieve region-specific reduction in a well-controlled way.236,237 A laser beam is scanned along the GO fiber so that the scanned region is reduced to G without causing any change to the unexposed area. A color change from yellow-brown (GO) to black in the scanned surface of GO fiber is also observed.
The layer by layer assembly (LBL) or Langmuir–Blodgett self-assembling method can be a good choice without the use of binders for the synthesis of a thin layer of GO of controllable thickness owing to its advantages such as simplicity, low-cost, scalability and solution-processability.228,238–240 This process begins with the immersion of yarns in PVA, and drying followed by graphene dispersion. These two steps were repeated to deposit a graphene nanoplatelet layer on yarns with a controlled thickness.240 Shakir et al.241 developed a method for the insertion of a graphene layer between V2O5 (3 nm)-coated MWCNT films to provide additional electron transport pathways. Firstly, transfer of a graphene layer on the textile fiber fabric substrate was performed and the alternating deposition of graphene and V2O5-coated MWCNTs resulted in a desirable multilayer supercapacitor electrode, as portrayed in Fig. 6J. The FE-SEM micrographs of the functionalized and V2O5-coated MWCNTs are presented in Fig. 6K and L. Furthermore, Fig. 6M depicts the HRTEM images of 20 nm and 3 nm thick V2O5 layer-coated MWCNTs together with the TEM-EDX elemental mapping of carbon, oxygen and vanadium. The LBL technique was also used for the realization of an intumescent flame retardant-polyacrylamide (IFR-PAM)/GO coating system for cotton fabric via the copolymerization of N1-(5,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphinyl-2-yl)-acrylamide (DPAA) and acrylamide.242 Wang et al.243 demonstrated a polymerization process to produce CNT@PANI composite yarn via the in situ deposition of PANI nanowire arrays on the surface of CNT yarn. Studies have demonstrated the use of the in situ polymerization process for the coating of polypyrrole on rGO.244 Xu et al.245 fabricated stretchable wire-shaped supercapacitors (WSS) from PDMS-coated spandex fiber as the substrate and H2SO4-PVA gel as the solid electrolyte via a prestraining-buckling process. This process was carried out in three steps: (i) prestraining of PDMS-coated spandex fiber to 100%, and application of a thin layer of H2SO4–PVA gel onto the PDMS/spandex fiber, (ii) gluing of straight WSS onto the spandex fiber, and solidification of the liquid electrolyte by keeping the resulting assembly in a fume hood for at least 24 h and (iii) release of prestrain on the spandex fiber to yield sinusoidal buckling of the supercapacitor.
Subsequently, we will discuss the other methods engaged for the fabrication of carbon nanostructured fibers. The major techniques involved in the process of making a yarn can be classified as follows:27 (i) the doubling method, in which yarn can be formed by arranging the fibers parallel to each other and bonding with mutual friction forces. The tensile stress applied to the yarn causes the fibers to overcome the friction force, leading to the occurrence of mutual slippage. (ii) The entangling approach employs pressurized air to entangle fibers during the fabrication of the yarn (with an irregular structure). (iii) The wrapping process is concerned with the helical wrapping of one or two fibers on the core yarn, which can be either a single wrapping or double wrapping process. Single wrapping is the process of wrapping one fiber on a core yarn; whereas, double wrapping involves wrapping one fiber in a clockwise direction and the other fiber in a counter-clockwise direction. The twist density of the wrapping is determined by the parameter “twist per meter”. Huang et al.27 reported the fabrication of yarn-based sensors from piezo-resistive fibers, elastic, and regular polyester fibers via single and double wrapping methods to enhance their sensing characteristics. Their studies showed that the double wrapping method resulted in higher linearity than the single wrapping approach.
The braiding process is a fast, continuous method of fabrication that intertwines three or more sets of yarns over and under each other by interlacing yarns or strips of fabric.246,247 Zhao et al.246 braided stainless steel (SS) wires and polyester fibers into 3D yarn using a Trenz-Export braiding machine. Polypyrrole, conducting polymers and metal oxides/hydroxides such as γ-MnO2 and Ni(OH)2 were electroplated onto SS wires to realize active electrodes. Besides SS/polyester, commercially available metal wires such as nickel, copper, titanium and platinum can also be suitable for the braiding fabrication process.
The industrial twist-bundle-drawing technique was demonstrated for the continuous synthesis of pristine soft conductive yarns that were mechanically robust and suitable for easy knitting of cloth via a commercial cloth knitting machine.248 The wax patterning method is an inexpensive method without the use of sophisticated equipment and techniques, which can make hydrophilic channels on cotton fabric to realize low-cost flexible circuits exhibiting excellent mechanical stability upon folding, bending and washing.249,250 Lam et al.249 fabricated wax-impregnated paper by soaking A4 paper in a melted wax mixture of Candelilla wax and beeswax (1:1), and the wax from the wax-impregnated paper was transferred to cotton fabric by heat treatment. The weaving process is a simple and scalable method adopted for obtaining industrial-scale and functional self-powered wearable devices.251,252 Kim et al.251 obtained highly stretchable 2D fabrics consisting of Al wires and PDMS tubes with vertically aligned nanowires towards realizing a fabric-structured triboelectric nanogenerator. Yun et al.252 formed a textile solar cell, where dye-sensitized solar cell electrodes such as photoanodes and counter electrodes were incorporated into the textile during the weaving process using the textile warp as a spacer. Wang et al.253 fabricated ultra-stretchable and highly sensitive strain sensors from carbonized silk fabrics (CSFs), in which pristine silk fabric was carbonized by thermal treatment in an inert atmosphere (mixture of argon and hydrogen) and CSFs were encapsulated in an elastic silicone “Ecoflex”. There are many interesting methods reported in the literature for the synthesis of carbon-based fibers. However, the commercialization of devices and their large-scale production are still challenging since these methods need to be standardized and customized to meet the industrial requirements by overcoming the existing technical difficulties.
There are different fabrication methods reported in the literature for the construction of carbon-based nanostructured fibers, where the dip and dry method and wet-chemical methods are simple and cost-effective. CVD is a powerful technique in the fiber making process owing to its reproducibility and large-scale production. Spinning processes such as electrospinning, wet spinning and dry spinning have different parameters to manipulate and are noteworthy for the formation of well-aligned and reproducible fibers. The biscrolling technique is also an effective method, but expertise in the process is required to attain high-quality fibers.
3. Properties of carbon-based fibers
To understand the applications of carbon nanostructured fibers, knowledge of their properties is essential. Moreover, the properties of carbon-based fibers play a vital role in for their use in smart textile applications. GWFs show interesting properties including89 (i) high structural integrity and enhanced mechanical performance on par with polycrystalline graphene films, (ii) good gas/liquid permeability compared to monolayer graphene and (iii) high sensitivity strain sensing due to their exponential resistive response upon external loading.
CNTs have high tensile strength up to 103 MPa with a specific strength 5.3 times that of the strongest commercial fiber (T1000) and specific stiffness 4.3 times that of the stiffest commercial fiber (M70J).254 Fibers made up of bare graphene, bare CNT, graphene oxide/CNT and graphene/CNT hybrids were subjected stress–strain tests under the same experimental conditions. The graphene oxide/CNT composite fiber developed by Sun et al.8 was flexible and could be made into a knot and other various morphologies without any degradation in its structure. The π–π interactions in graphene/CNT composite help graphene sheets to interact effectively with CNTs to transfer the load, which further enhances the tensile strength to ∼630 MPa compared to the tensile strength of bare graphene (∼320 MPa), bare CNT (∼500 MPa) and graphene oxide/CNT fiber (∼610 MPa).127,152Table 2 gives detailed information on the properties of carbon-based materials towards realizing fibers.

The ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break of hybrid CNT/graphene yarn were found to be 140 ± 10 MPa, 2.58 ± 0.3 GPa and 6 ± 2%, respectively.46 This elongation at break value was 100% greater than that of pristine CNT yarn (3% ± 2%); whereas, its elastic modulus was relatively less than that of pristine CNT due to its porosity.74 The reported maximum values for the tensile strength and Young's modulus of GONR were 179 MPa and 5.5 GPa, respectively, which are higher than that of pristine PAN nanofiber yarns (69.7 MPa and 3.34 GPa) and functionalized-MWNT/PAN composite nanofibers (80 MPa and 3.1 GPa).48,255 Furthermore, it was reported that 10% PAN carbon yarn exhibited the ultimate strength of ∼1 GPa, which increased to ∼1.7 GPa upon the impregnation of an adhesive to achieve a unidirectional composite.49 The increased strength was attributed to the increase in molecular orientation within the filaments and filament to filament orientation. Moreover, carbonized yarns with respect to stabilized yarns showed increased ultimate strength due to their stable and strong cross-linked structure, giving rise to a ladder structure.
In novel composite fibers, the charge transport can be improved via strong π–π interaction between the graphene sheets and CNT to achieve high electrical conductivity and electro-catalytic activity.8 The electrical conductivities of bare graphene, bare CNT, graphene oxide/CNT composite and graphene/CNT composite were compared at RT by Sun et al.8 The bare CNT and graphene oxide/CNT had almost the same EC of 370 ± 15 S cm−1 and 368 ± 22 S cm−1, respectively. The graphene/CNT composite fiber gave the highest EC of 450 ± 20 S cm−1; whereas, the bare graphene fibers showed EC values of 195 ± 40 S cm−1 (ref. 127 and 152) and ∼400 S cm−1(ref. 129 and 256) The average EC values for CNT, CNT/graphene yarns and graphene paper were 220 ± 20 S cm−1, 900 ± 50 S cm−1 and 72 S cm−1, respectively.46,132 The EC value of carbonized composite yarns (0.5 wt% GONR) was 165 S cm−1, which was larger than that of PAN-based pristine CNF yarns (77 S cm−1) and monolayer GNRs (54 S cm−1).48
The optical properties of electrospun TiO2–graphene composite nanofibers were well-explained based on the stepwise structure of their energy levels.50 The conduction band and valence band of TiO2 are −4.2 eV and −7.4 eV, respectively; whereas, graphene has a zero band gap.257,258 The photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to graphene was responsible for effective photo-induced electron separation; thereby, prohibiting charge recombination during the electron-transfer process, which has application in photovoltaics.
Carbon nanostructured fibers have attracted widespread attention owing to their excellent flexibility, strength and multi-functionality; thereby, opening a new window for the study of other competent two-dimensional materials with layered structures similar to them in the field of electronic fiber-based devices. CNTs have superior properties than conventional fibers with a low density of 1 g cm−3 or 10 μg m−1 compared to the density values of 10 mg m−1 and 20–100 mg m−1 for cotton and wool yarns, respectively.172 The EC of CNTs has been reported to be 103 S cm−1;254 whereas, graphene fibers are limited by their low EC of 10–102 S cm−1.115,127 However, CNT fibers have the limitation of low electro-catalytic activity, which is a prime factor for electronic applications, compared to graphene fibers, exhibiting a higher loading capability with high electro-catalytic ability.115,127 To achieve both these characteristics in addition to the efficiencies needed for electrodes such as photoelectric conversion and energy storage efficiency, a composite fiber family consisting of graphene and CNTs was synthesized.
4. Applications
Carbon-based fibers with striking properties have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their cost-effectiveness, interesting properties and reliability in devices. Interestingly, detailed studies of their applications will pave the way for the use of emerging two-dimensional materials in this field of research to achieve more efficient and cost-effective devices.
4.1 Electronic textiles
Recently, the widespread use of electronic gadgets has increased tremendously since everyone desires compact, flexible and wearable electronic devices.59,259,260 The present section is dedicated to the discussion of different electronic textiles reported in the literature, which will provide deeper insight into emerging devices from other 2D materials besides graphene.

4.1.1 Fiber transistors. 
The transistor is the basic component required for complex circuitry in both conventional electronics and wearable electronic devices. Thus, flexible fiber-type field-effect transistors (FETs) as components in wearable devices such as biomedical sensors, wearable displays and computers have attracted the attention of researchers due to their high mechanical flexibility, electrical conductivity, huge specific surface area and processing possibilities.261,262 Yoon et al.143 reported flexible organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and fiber-type FETs using graphene/Ag hybrid fibers as electrodes. The fabrication of OTFT is demonstrated in Fig. 7A. Firstly, PU was dissolved in DMF at a concentration of 100 mg mL−1 to create a PU substrate. A slide glass was used to cast the dissolved solution and source–drain electrodes were implanted by placing the graphene/Ag hybrid fibers 200 to 300 μm away from each other on a PU substrate before drying. The introduction of a hydrophilic surface was attained by treating a silicon (Si) wafer with oxygen plasma and organic contamination was removed by cleaning the Si wafer with piranha solution. Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene), P(VDF-HFP), and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([EMI][TFSA]) were co-dissolved in acetone with a weight ratio of 1:4:7 (polymer, ionic liquid, and solvent) to prepare the ion gel layer. The as-prepared gel was placed under vacuum at 70 °C for 24 h after spin coating on the cleaned Si wafer at 1000 rpm for 1 min to remove the residual solvent. The ion gel layer was further spin coated with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) at 2000 rpm for 60 s from chloroform solution (10 mg mL−1). The direct contact between the P3HT layer and the hybrid fiber electrodes was made by inversely transferring the double layer of ion gel and P3HT onto the PU substrate. The top gate electrode was formed by simply placing a third graphene/Ag hybrid fiber on the ion gel layer and finally the new ion gel layer was applied above the gate to fabricate a complete planar-structured transistor device.

(A) Steps involved in fabrication process with cross-sectional view of device, (B) schematic demonstration together with its optical image (inset), (C) photograph with the inset showing bent hybrid fiber and (D) drain current vs. drain voltage curves for different gate voltages. These figures were reproduced from ref. 413 with permission from Nature Publishing Group. 
The fabrication of the fiber-type transistor device143 above began with settling the flexible polyurethane monofilament on the glass slide after washing the filament with ethanol. The hybrid fiber-based source–drain was aligned by placing two graphene/Ag hybrid fibers on top of the dissolved PU wire with tetrahydrofuran solvent. Direct contact between the P3HT layer and the hybrid fiber electrodes was attained by inversely transferring the double layer of ion gel and P3HT from the Si wafer onto the PU filament. The final step to fabricate a complete fiber-type transistor device, as seen in Fig. 7B, was achieved by positioning a third graphene/Ag hybrid fiber on the ion gel layer to form a top gate electrode and applying the new ion gel layer above the gate. Fig. 7C shows the rolling up of the as-prepared fiber-type transistor on the glass rod, which validates its flexibility and robustness. Fig. 7D illustrates the response of ID against VD for various VG values. The average field-effect mobility can be calculated from the slope of the VGvs. |ID| curves using the following expression in the linear regime (VD = −1 V). (1)where, ID, μ, Ci, VD, VG, VT, W and L represent the drain current, field-effect mobility, specific capacitance of the dielectric, drain voltage, gate voltage, threshold voltage, channel width and length, respectively. The electrical characteristics such as carrier mobility (μh), on/off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) and VT were reported to be 20.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.0 × 105, −2.5 V at 0.6 drawing ratio of the fiber electrode and 4.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.0 × 104, −2.6 V at 1.2 drawing ratio of the fiber electrode for the planar-structured transistor device and 15.6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.4 × 104, −1.2 V at 0.6 drawing ratio of the fiber electrode and 3.4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 8.0 × 103, −2.3 V at 1.2 drawing ratio of the fiber electrode for the fiber-type transistor device, respectively, while sweeping VG from 0 V to −4 V at a rate of 33 mV s−1 and a constant VD value of −1 V.143


4.1.2 Flexible circuit board. 
Wearable electronics will be a successful field of study if and only when the fabrication of flexible circuit boards is possible to replace the conventional rigid printed circuit boards (PCB) owing to the need of greater flexibility.2 Thus, researchers have turned their attention towards the development of circuits using flexible substrate materials to facilitate the realization of electrically conductive circuits on flexible substrate materials, such as paper and textile, for various applications.263,264 Lam et al.249 paved a path towards the possibility of developing flexible circuit boards on cotton fabric scoured with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) using a simple wax patterning method.250 The patterns of electrically conducting hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions were created by adopting the pipetting method, where graphene-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (graphene-PEDOT:PSS) ink was deposited on the hydrophilic region. To form the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions on the fabric, a wax-impregnated paper made by dipping A4 paper into melted wax (equal ratio of Candelilla wax and beeswax) transferred the wax to the scoured cotton fabric by heat treatment. Higher conductance was achieved by using a pipette to fill the hydrophilic region with graphene-PEDOT:PSS ink (2 μL per 20 mm2) 10 times. A linear pattern of resistance was observed in the conductive lines fabricated using graphene-PEDOT:PSS ink on cotton fabric for different line distances.

4.2 Environmental fabrics
Environmental fabrics are demanded not only in everyday life in other fields such as security, emergency, monitoring, and the health sector.

4.2.1 Fiber-based effluent treatment. 
Effluents have become a challenge for the textile industry since they cause severe environmental pollution.265 The dyes present in effluents cause significant harm to the environment, which cannot be degraded under light, heat and with oxidizing agents. There are many techniques available to treat effluents such as flocculation, reverse osmosis, photo-degradation processes and ion-exchange. However, these methods have disadvantages including high energy consumption, complicated design, multiple operations and generation of harmful substances, which make them ineffective at low dye concentration to be efficiently employed in the textile industry.166 Owing to its low cost, simplicity of operation and availability of a wide range of adsorbents, the adsorption method has attracted the attention of industrialists for the treatment of dye effluent.266–268 Li et al.166 investigated a fiber made of graphene oxide and chitosan as an adsorbent to remove fuchsin acid. Chitosan has the inherent ability to remove dyes and metal ions from aqueous solutions due to its high content of amino and hydroxyl functional groups. The addition of graphene to chitosan improved the adsorption capacity of the fiber due to its specific magnetism,269 high carrier concentration and mobility,270 high mechanical strength271 and thermal conductivity.261 The as-prepared fibers (10 mg) were used to remove fuchsin acid dye from aqueous solution (20 mL) in a 50 mL conical flask for 3 days in a water bath shaker at a controlled temperature. The adsorption capacity at equilibrium, qe, and dye removal percentage, Q (%), at time ‘t’ were calculated using the following expressions.166 (2) (3)where, c0, ce and ct represent the initial concentration, equilibrium concentration and concentration at time ‘t’ of fuchsin acid (mg L−1), respectively, m denotes the mass of adsorbent (in g) and V denotes the volume of solution (in L). The adsorbent property of an adsorbent is influenced by the pH of the adsorption medium. Higher dye adsorption capacity by the fibers was observed in an acidic pH range; whereas, a decrease in adsorption capacity was noted in a basic pH range, as shown in Fig. 8E. An increase in the adsorbent dosage from 0.2 g to 1.5 g L−1 resulted in an increase in the removal of fuchsin acid from 54.9% to 91.3% (adsorption capacity decreased from 197.6 to 54.8 mg g−1), as depicted in Fig. 8F.166Fig. 8G reveals that the maximum adsorption of GO/chitosan fibers decreased from 220.0 to 69.9 mg g−1 when the temperature increased from 273 to 313 K, which resulted in an exothermic process.

4.2.2 Fire-resistant fabrics. 
Fire-resistant conducting fibers are in demand for many applications in wearable electronics. Fang et al.149 fabricated fire-resistant conducting fibers based on a montmorillonite (MMT) nanoplatelet and graphene oxide liquid crystal (LC) template. Further, MMT-GO was reduced to MMT-graphene fibers through high-temperature treatment and were able to withstand a temperature in the range of about 600–700 °C in air, with conductivity of up to 1.04 × 104 S m−1 and density (ρ) of about 1.62 g cm−3. The decomposition temperature of the MMT-graphene fibers was compared with different fire-retardant conductors in an Ashby plot, which is presented in Fig. 8A. An electrical circuit with a light emitting diode (LED) chip was constructed after twisting several MMT-graphene fibers together and directly heating them using an alcohol lamp, as shown in Fig. 8B. The LED chip continued to glow even after the fibers turned glowing red, which exhibited the fire resisting capability of the as-prepared fibers. The fire-resistant performance further validated by the combustion test performed for both graphene films and MMT-graphene films. When the graphene films were exhausted in seconds (Fig. 8C), the MMT-graphene films survived even after 15 min under combustion, as shown in Fig. 8D. On the other hand, Huang et al.,242 improved the thermal stability and fire resistance properties of cotton fabric by coating it with intumescent flame retardant-polyacrylamide (IFR-PAM)/graphene oxide (GO) thin films via layer-by-layer assembly. N-(5,5-Dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphinyl-2-yl)-acrylamide (DPAA) and acrylamide were copolymerized to prepare the IFR-PAM. A glass substrate was used to grow IFR-PAM/GO multilayer films, where a concentrated sulfuric acid solution containing potassium dichromate was applied to clean the glass surface for 2 h and it was dipped in a dispersion of GO for 30 s to be coated on the cotton fabric. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) (temperature at the maximum weight loss rate) of the cotton was reported to be 240–360 °C (Td = 324 °C) and the residue at 600 °C under an air atmosphere. The cotton fabric coated with 20 bilayers exhibited a Td of about 15–27 °C higher than that of the cotton fabric without coating. The peak heat release rate (PHRR) of the cotton fabric was around 153 kW m−2; whereas, that for the coated fabric was reduced to about 14%. The coated fabrics showed time to ignition (TTI) of 11 s longer than that of the control fabric.242


4.2.3 Fiber-based filters. 
Applications such as self-cleaning systems based on nanowire, nanorod and nanotube arrays have attracted researchers to explore flexible, lightweight and biocompatible substrates for realizing self-cleaning systems.272 Chen et al.273 reported a textile fabric for the purification of contaminated water and air by growing TiO2 NT arrays on flexible carbon fiber sheet (CFS), as shown in Fig. 8H. TiO2 has interesting properties such as superior charge transport properties, large surface area and distinct photochemical activities, which enable its application in self-cleaning systems. CFSs were used as a base instead of polymer or cotton textiles due to their high strength, high conductivity, and temperature and corrosion resistance properties. The growth of TiO2 NT arrays on CFSs was achieved by pre-coating TiO2 on CFSs and further reaction with NaOH. Organic pollutants (Rhodamine B (RhB)) in water were absorbed by immersing the developed textile material into contaminated water, where the organic pollutants were decomposed upon exposure to sunlight or UV light, yielding purified water, as detailed in Fig. 8I. Fig. 8J shows the diffusion reflection spectra depicting the absorption of RhB before (black curve) and after (red curve) immersion of the textile material into the polluted water, and the textile regained its original form (blue curve) once irradiated under UV light for 30 min. RhB pollutant was completely photodegraded within 7 h when the textile was soaked in the solution under continuous photocatalysis, as seen in Fig. 8K. However, the textile with more TiO2 NT reduced the RhB degradation time by up to 5 h.

4.3 Wearable energy harvesting and storage
In modern electronics, the mainstream direction has continuously driven industries towards flexible, lightweight, portable electronic devices that harvest electrical energy from the environment and store it to operate the devices incorporated in smart garments.274,275 The fabrication of wearable electronic devices has created a significant breakthrough in the present textile industry.276,277 In addition, nanogenerators (NGs), wire-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells, lithium ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors based on graphene and CNT fibers have also been realized recently.256,278

4.3.1 Fiber-based nano generators. 
Flexible fiber nanogenerators (FNGs) have potential applications in smart textiles, wearable electronics and medical textiles as a nano power source that extracts energy from human body motions for various electronic devices embedded in them. Zetang Li and Zhong Lin Wang279 designed air/liquid-pressure and heartbeat-driven FNG by utilizing the pressure changes induced through air and liquid flow. Conventional technologies cannot be used to generate electricity using air/liquid pressure since it is an isotropic scalar quantity in nature. FNGs composed of carbon fibers and a ZnO thin film may be a solution for this problem. The fabrication of nanogenerators was accomplished by growing a radially textured ZnO thin film around a carbon fiber, which was used as a flexible soft substrate and charge support electrode, as shown in Fig. 9A. The physical vapor deposition method was used to grow a radially textured, cylindrical and shell structured ZnO film (250 nm thick) with densely packed nanowires on the surface of carbon fiber. Electrons flowed through an external load after applying an external air/liquid pressure using the electrodes placed on the surface of the ZnO film and carbon fiber.279 The piezoelectric potential was developed between the Zn–O units after the application of an external pressure. The developed potential diminished once the external force was removed, thereby releasing the strain. The as-fabricated FNG showed a peak output voltage of 3.2 V with an average current density of 0.15 μA cm−2 when it was driven by air pressure higher than that of the output resulting by applying force using a mechanical motor in a synchronized way (output voltage was 2.0 to 2.2 V and the output current was 60 to 120 nA). Additionally, FNGs were also demonstrated as an ultrasensitive sensor for monitoring the blood pressure and behavior of the human heart, as detailed in Fig. 9B. The corresponding electrical current output driven by heart pulses is presented in Fig. 9C. FNGs also have potential applications such as quantitative diagnostic tools for healthcare, 3D sensors in rotating tires, flowing air/liquids, blood vessels, gas pipes, oil pipes and fluid and gas monitoring systems.279

Zhong et al.189 realized a fiber-based generator (FBG) using cotton threads, polytetrafluoroethylene aqueous suspension and CNTs, which generated electrical energy by human body motions and vibrations such as walking, arm swinging, finger motion, and breathing. Fabrication of the FBG began with treating cotton threads with an ethanol flame and a nitric acid solution to eliminate redundant fibers and to increase their hydrophilicity, respectively. The as-treated cotton threads were dipped into MWCNTs ink and then dried to prepare conductive and flexible CCTs with a constant resistance of ∼0.644 kΩ cm−1. The CCTs were then coated with PTFE to fabricate PCCTs via the dipping and drying method as an electret material. The PCCTs were further annealed to improve the attraction between CCTs and PTFE. Subsequently, plasma treatment was carried out on the PCCTs to polarize the fibers. A complete FBG was designed by entangling the as-prepared CCTs with PCCTs, which generated electrical energy when it was stretched and released, causing changes in the interfiber gap distance (d) between CCTs and PCCTs, as shown schematically in Fig. 9F. The change in ‘d’ induced positive and negative charges in the CNT layer of CCTs due to the respective stretching and releasing, thereby generating alternating current (ac) to flow through the load. According to the connection of FBG with the load, the output polarities were switched. The forward connected system produced positive charges during stretching and negative charges during releasing (Fig. 9G); whereas, the reverse connected system showed the opposite results (Fig. 9H). The peak output current of FBG (length of ∼9.0 cm and eight helix turns) was observed in the range of 3.98 nA to 11.22 nA at 0.54% to 2.15% of applied strain. The total charges transferred between the electrodes were attained via integration of each current peak. On the other hand, the stimulation frequencies varied the output current of FBG. It was demonstrated that the peak output current was sensitive to both the stimulation frequency and magnitude of strain; whereas, the applied strain alone affected the amount of transferred charges. At 2.15% applied strain with a frequency of 5 Hz, the FBG produced an instantaneous output peak power value of 11.08 nW with an optimal external load of 100 MΩ and average output power density of ∼0.1 μW cm−2. They also realized FBG as a self-powered active sensor to quantitatively detect human motion by connecting the as-prepared FBG to the index finger, where the corresponding electrical responses are depicted in Fig. 9I for different bending and releasing actions. Fig. 9J shows that the rise in amplitude of finger motion increased the total amount of transferred charges, validating the ability of the FBG to detect even tiny muscle actions, which has potential applications in patient monitoring.
A fiber-based self-powering nanosystem was devised by Bae et al.280 using ZnO NWs and graphene as the basic materials to harvest energy from the environment, where a nanogenerator was fabricated by covering a layer of Au over polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) fiber followed by chemically growing ZnO NWs on the fiber to act as one electrode. Thermal CVD grown graphene on copper mesh wrapped around the fiber was employed as the cylindrical electrode due to its high electrical conductivity and transparency. Fig. 9O demonstrates the characteristics of the prepared graphene. High quality and defect free graphene was justified through the Raman spectrum with distinct G- and 2D-peaks at ∼1600 cm−1 and 2700 cm−1, respectively. They integrated NG, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and supercapacitor on a single plastic fiber, as depicted in Fig. 9P. Fig. 9Q displays the SEM image of the plastic wire after it was coated with Au and radially grown ZnO NW arrays. The as-prepared NG produced a maximum output current of 2 nA and maximum open-circuit voltage of about 7 mV when it was driven manually by applying a pushing force. A high on/off ratio for the NG was attained due to the high carrier mobility (1760 cm2 W−1 S−1) of graphene.280
Another type of NG reported by Wu et al.221 involved silver nanowire and graphene sheets on a polyester substrate to generate electricity through mechanical energy induced by the human body motion. Initially, Ag NWs were coated on a polyester fabric using the blade-coating method owing to their good performance including high conductivity under various mechanical deformation of the fabric, high optical transmittances and stabilization on the fabric to form desired shapes. Interestingly, thin graphene films were introduced into the coated textile to overcome the limitations of the instability of the Ag NWs coated textile fabric with sulfide in the air due to the high reactivity of Ag, low attraction between Ag NWs and polyester fibers and increased roughness on the fabric surface. Complimented by the improved electrical conductivity of graphene in the fabric, the attachment of Ag NWs to the polyester yarn was enhanced by inducing a strong van der Waals force together with improved electrical stability of textile material. Furthermore, the hydrophilic fabric was converted to a hydrophobic one to protect the coating from the water wash. The obtained fabric acted as a good candidate as a conducting substrate in wearable electricity generators, in which PMMA and polyimide (PI) layers were coated on the as-prepared textile to create an insulating layer. The triboelectric generator fabricated by the authors generated electricity by rubbing the two textiles together continuously.221 The rubbing process carried out for 13 s demonstrated the maximum output voltage of 14.5 V; whereas, the output voltage of 8 V was attained for 6 s. For the output current, the PMMA-PI generator yielded 100 μA at the applied friction frequency of 1.5 Hz, but 30 μA at 5 Hz. Nanogenerators fabricated using a PDMS insulating layer resulted in a higher performance on par with the PI layers since they had stronger ability to gain more electrons. The PMMA-PDMS generator showed an output current of about 400 μA at 1.5 Hz to about 50 μA. Wu et al.221 assembled smart textiles on a glove to harvest energy with the action of finger movement, as shown in Fig. 9K and L. The instantaneous output current and voltage generated by the glove were larger than 2 μA and 4 mV, respectively, with an output power of 7 nW cm−2 (Fig. 9M and N). Accordingly, these generators can be integrated into smart clothing for supplying power to wearable electronic devices.


4.3.2 Flexible solar cells. 
Wire-shaped photovoltaic devices have been extensively studied with the advancements in the field of materials science.8,11,170,281,282Table 3 shows the different carbon fiber-based solar cells and their characteristics. Due to the outstanding properties of carbon-based nanomaterials, they can be used as electrode materials for the realization of high performance DSSCs with high energy conversion efficiencies and stability. In general, DSSCs consist of a photoanode, dyesensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode.283 Indium tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass is usually employed to prepare both the photoanode and counter electrode. The excellent electro-catalytic activity of platinized FTO glass makes it a promising counter electrode in most DSSCs.284 However, the high cost of Pt and its high activation energy requirement285 have driven researchers towards alternatives such as conducting polymers,286,287 carbon materials288–290 and transition metal-based inorganic materials.291,292

DSSCs based on CNTs and GNRs have been reported with high energy conversion efficiency (6.83%), where a highly flexible CNT-GNR core–sheath fiber was twisted around the working electrode by soaking modified Ti wire in the dehydrated acetonitrile and tert-butanol-based N719 dye (0.3 mM ruthenium(II)).170 The J–V curves shown in Fig. 10C further confirm the higher efficiency yield for the devices based on the CNT–GNR hybrid fibers compared to that based on bare CNTs coated with Pt. Madhavan and co-workers50 reported that an electrospun TiO2–graphene composite as photoanodes in DSSCs achieved an efficiency of 7.6% since semiconductor oxides such as TiO2 and graphene composites exhibit excellent electron-accepting ability, high surface area and absorb incident white light. They fabricated DSSCs by immersing FTO glass with an TiO2–graphene layer and platinized FTO counter electrode into N719 dye. To prevent the occurrence of a short-circuit between the electrodes, a paraffin spacer was employed, and an electrolyte based on 0.01 M lithium iodide, 0.001 M iodine, 0.6 M butyl methyl imadizolium iodide and 0.5 M tertiary butyl pyridine was introduced for the physical clamping of the electrodes. The reported DSSC demonstrated an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.71 V, short-circuit photo-current density (Jsc) of 16.2 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 66%.50

The high surface area,293 superior electrical properties,294 efficient transportation of photoelectrons and excellent mechanical properties295 of CNTs make them a potential competitor in the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells. Highly aligned CNT fibers combined with N719 on FTO were reported to for organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies ranging from 2.1% to 2.6%.172 The photocurrent in the CNT–N719 hybrid was produced by the excited N719 molecules, which inject electrons into the CNT conduction band. Subsequently, the electrons reach the counter electrode by moving through the nanotubes, charge collector and external circuit. A schematic illustration of the photoelectron generation and transportation in the nanotube fiber is shown in Fig. 10T. As can be seen in Fig. 10U, an increase in the length of the fibers linearly increased the photocurrent. Graphene-coated cotton fabric (GCCF) on a transparent PET sheet was used as a counter electrode in the fabrication of Pt and FTO glass-free DSSCs by Sahito et al.195 A DSSC with a conversion efficiency of 2.52% was prepared by sandwiching the GCCF and photoanode with a Surlyn spacer and polymer gel electrolyte, as detailed in Fig. 10A. The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated cell and the conventional Pt counter electrode-based DSSCs are shown in Fig. 10B. Further, the CNT fiber-based textile counter electrodes and metal textile working electrodes were arranged together to fabricate textile-based wearable DSSCs (refer to Fig. 10R) with energy conversion efficiencies up to 3.67%.296 From Fig. 10Q, it is evident that the maximum energy conversion efficiency was attained at the fiber length of about 30 μm. The output parameters could be tuned by interconnecting the textiles in series or in parallel. As a proof of concept, an LED was powered by connecting the textiles in series, as seen in Fig. 10S.
Better light absorption and improved charge collection from the active layer can be attained through the application of semiconductor nanowire arrays in solar cells. Grynko et al.297 reported a novel approach to obtain solar cells using CdS NWs around a single carbon fiber in the form of a flexible hybrid core–shell nanobrush (electron acceptor). The electron acceptor was covered by the donor organic material of zinc 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H,31H-phthalocyanine (ZnPc-4R), poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) or P3HT-PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) mixture to form different types of bulk heterojunction micron-sized solar cells, such as solid-state DSSC, electrochemical DSSC, solid-state polymer-sensitized solar cell and inverted solar cell. A new technique has been demonstrated for the fabrication of textile-based DSSCs in the form of weft or wraps using a common weaving process with a loom without degrading the performance, which is illustrated in Fig. 10N.252 The photoanode was prepared using a porous, dye-loaded TiO2-coated holed metal ribbon and counter electrode from Pt nanoparticle-loaded carbon yarn, which were woven into the textiles as the weft and the textile warps were used as spacers. Finally, the woven DSSC soaked in 0.3 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye and sealed with a PET-based laminated pouch film could be sewn onto common cloths. The current density and power response curves of the textiles integrated with DSSCs are shown in Fig. 10O. Fig. 10P illustrates the flexibility of the as-prepared energy textile on the surface of a curved rod.
A wire-shaped DSSC using a CNT–graphene–Pt composite fiber reported by Sun et al.8 was realized by twisting N719 dye-absorbed TiO2 NT modified Ti wire with a composite fiber as working and counter electrode, which was then sealed in a transparent flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene tube with redox electrolyte. A textile electrode based on MWCNT and PANI composite fiber was also realized for the photoconversion function in wearable solar cells.83 The photographs of the MWCNT–PANI hybrid fiber-based multilayered textile electrode on the fabric is shown in Fig. 10J. Further, Fig. 10K displays a schematic and working mechanism of the energy textile integrated with the supercapacitor. The photocharge and galvanostatic discharge curves of the bare CNT fiber-based and MWCNT–PANI composite fiber-based integrated energy textiles are given in Fig. 10L and M, respectively. Owing to the higher specific capacitance in the CNT–PANI composite fiber-based integrated textile, 0.70 V was reached in around 25 s and the discharge time was about 100 s; whereas, in the integrated textile based on bare CNT fibers the voltage of 0.70 V was attained in around 0.5 s and the discharge time was about 3 s. CNT flexible yarns with Pt NPs were demonstrated as potential counter electrode materials for application in fiber solar cells.139 The presented device exhibited a power conversion efficiency of around 4.85%. Graphene is a thermally and chemically stable material presented as an alternative for conventional metal oxide window materials to fabricate high performance DSSCs.298 Bae and co-workers280 reported a DSSC with ZnO NWs-graphene sheet with Jsc, Voc, FF and energy conversion efficiency of 0.35 mA cm−2, 0.17 V, 0.39 and 0.02%, respectively. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 8.45% was attained by Yang et al. in DSSCs based on counter electrodes prepared299 through electrodepositing Pt NPs on graphene fiber, which captured the incident light coming from any direction effectively. The device structure and SEM micrograph are portrayed in Fig. 10D and E, respectively. Fig. 10F and G show the use of a capillary glass tube and flexible fluorinated ethylene propylene tube in sealing the photovoltaic wires. The electrical characteristics of the fiber with various Pt contents and increasing fiber lengths were analyzed, as shown in Fig. 10H and I, respectively, where the following conclusions were derived: the Pt loading of about 7.1% resulted in the maximum energy conversion efficiency and the optimum length of the fiber was determined to be 30 μm.


4.3.3 Wearable capacitors. 
Light-weight, low-cost, high efficiency, small hysteresis and low power dissipation wearable capacitors are essential in the field of wearable electronics to power portable electronic devices.214,300 Zhang et al.214 reported a wearable capacitor using modified nylon fabric due to its elasticity, toughness, resistance to abrasion, light weight, wrinkle resistance, excellent absorbency rate and comfort to wear. However, the application of nylon fabrics is limited in certain applications such as protective clothing in military and civilian use since it melts and adheres to the skin at higher temperatures. To address these limitations, nylon fabric was functionalized using SWCNTs via a simple immersing and drying technique. Subsequently, a wearable capacitor was fabricated using two functionalized nylon fabrics as the electrodes and pristine nylon fabric as the dielectric layer, which were mechanically pressed together to enhance the inter-coupling between them. The as-prepared capacitor showed a sheet resistance of around 5 kΩ sq−1 and could store ∼40–50 nF of total charge or power of 10 nW.214


4.3.4 Flexible supercapacitors. 
Energy storage devices have been extensively studied by researches in the field of wearable electronics.31,155,301,302 Supercapacitors (SCs) are widely used in smart garments as a replacement for batteries due to their high power density with moderate energy density, fast charge–discharge, extended cycle life, better reversibility and pollution-free operation.211,303,304 The above characteristics are achieved with the help of reversible ion adsorption–desorption at electrolyte–electrode interfaces in electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), while through fast surface redox reactions in pseudocapacitors.305–308 To utilize the advantages of SCs in the wearable electronics, they should be flexible enough to integrate them into fabrics. The applications of carbon nanostructures in the field of supercapacitors are tabulated in Table 4.

Fiber-based SCs are fabricated in different architectures including planar structure, wire-shaped or yarn structure, coaxial or cable structure and sandwich-interdigital structure. The advantages of cylindrically shaped fiber SCs have been reported previously due to their direct use in wearable electronics as threads/fabrics.301,302,309–311 An SC basically consists of two electrodes, in which one functions as a current collector and the other as an active charge storage electrode. The ion source for the SCs is provided by electrolytes, which are coated on the surface of the electrodes. In most cases, the electrolytes play the role of separator by preventing the electrodes from short circuit. Symmetrical SCs use fibers as both the current collector and charge storage material; whereas, two different fibers are used for asymmetrical SC configurations. A widened operating potential, larger current density, longer charge–discharge time and enhanced electrochemical performance can be achieved using the asymmetrical SC configuration.114,147,182,200,215 Generally, SCs can be fabricated either by intertwining two fiber electrodes together and subsequently coating with electrolyte or by assembling the fiber electrodes, separator and electrolyte in a layer by layer structure.
The well-known fiber materials for various flexible energy storage device electrodes are carbonaceous fibers including CFs, activated carbon, graphene, CNTs, ordered mesoporous carbon and metal oxides due to their high mechanical strength, light weight, high conductivity, flexibility and inertness under ambient conditions.12,114,119,127,157,312–316 Due to their good ability to be woven into textile fabrics, CFs are used in many wearable clothes.190,194,317 Recently, researchers in the field of energy storage devices have been focused on graphene fibers due to their exceptional electrical and thermal conductivities, high specific surface area and mechanical strength.115,127 CNTs are also used as electrode materials to utilize their high charge transport capability and high electrolyte accessibility.52,182,311,313,318,319 The performance of SCs can be enhanced by the selection of proper electrode materials. Composite electrode materials have created space for the researchers to improve the performance of fiber-based SCs.182,211,320–322 The polymer based gel electrolyte PVA-H2SO4 is frequently used as both electrolyte and separator in the fabrication of high performance SCs due to its advantages such as no leakage of electrolyte, ease of device integration and environmentally stable. The soakage and solidification technique is usually employed to coat the electrolyte in SC electrodes.52,59,88,90,108,117,157,182,245,320,323–325 Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used to characterize the electrochemical properties of SCs. The specific capacitance of SCs is calculated by integrating the full CV curve and from the slope (dV/dt) of GCD curves. Electrodes charge propagation and capacitance characteristics can be determined by the shape of the CV curves (rectangular shape indicates good charge propagation) and GCD curves (triangular curve signifies distinct capacitance characteristics). The Nyquist plot is a plot of the real and imaginary component of impedance, which is used to analyze the EIS data exhibiting the frequency response. A nearly straight vertical response curve at the low frequency region characterizes an ideal capacitor. The power capability of SCs is determined by the internal or equivalent series resistance (ESR), which is obtained from the intersection of the frequency response curve with the x-axis. The Warburg impedance, which is denoted by the slope of the curve in the low frequency range, is the frequency dependence of the electrolyte ion diffusion process. The energy density and power density of the device can be obtained from Ragone plots.305,310,326
CNT composite fiber-based electrode materials enhance the charge separation and transport; thereby, increasing the specific capacitance, energy and power density of a device.31,52,88,155,181,182,207,245,323 The core electrode was covered with a separator and electrospun CNF film to fabricate a coaxial SC;52 whereas, a flexible wire-shaped electric double-layer capacitor was fabricated by twisting two composite fibers together.88 Since manganese(IV) oxide (MnO2),327 ruthenium(IV) oxide (RuO2)107 and conducting polymers such as PANI and PPy have high theoretical pseudocapacitance, they are combined with carbon materials to improve the performance of SCs.35,36,87,141,167,168,182,200,202,204,207,209,215,248,310,328,329 The SC developed using GWF with PANI resulted in an enhanced electrochemical performance compared to GWF without PANI.36 The fabrication process for the GWF-PANI SC is illustrated schematically in Fig. 11L. The output performance of the device in single and series combination can be observed from the GCD curves and the demonstration of the SC powering an LED is depicted in Fig. 11M. An SWCNT-based conductive cotton fabric was produced to fabricate an organic SC.207 The as-produced SC exhibited excellent performance and flexibility (Fig. 11R). The device performance was further enhanced by the introduction of pseudocapacitive materials. Huang et al.248 designed an energy storage textile using rGO–MnO2–PPy conducting yarns, which was used directly to power a bunch of LEDs on a teddy bear and knitted wrist band (Fig. 12T and U, respectively). Liu and co-workers31 reported a three-dimensional cotton thread, which was prepared using CNTs, MnO2 and PPy by fabricating a cable-type capacitor with pristine cotton textile as the separator and 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte on a transparent silicone pipeline package shell, as shown in Fig. 12C. From Fig. 12D, the corresponding CV curves showed no significant changes for different bent states of the device. The CNTs endowed high conductivity and high porosity to the cotton thread and MnO2 combined with PPy enhanced its electrochemical performance. A large surface area with enhanced electrical conductivity was realized by combining activated carbon (chitosan as the precursor) with the CNTs.157 The as-realized device connected in parallel and series configurations on a PTFE substrate and the corresponding CV curves are presented in Fig. 12M–P. As seen from Fig. 12O and P, the series configuration enhanced the voltage output and the parallel configuration improved the current output by a factor of the number of units connected. CF with RuO2·xH2O on its surface was synthesized to fabricate a wearable self-charging power system consisting of FNG and fiber SC by Wang et al.107 A schematic demonstration of the as-integrated power system is exhibited in Fig. 13A. The corresponding SEM images of fibers used in the system are shown in Fig. 13B and C. A wearable pseudocapacitor fabricated using an MnO2–CNT–polyester composite textile resulted in an enhanced specific capacitance; thereby, increasing the energy and power density.209 The fabricated pseudocapacitor also showed excellent cyclic stability, as seen from Fig. 13R and S. The capacitor maintained its initial capacity by almost 80% after the first 200 cycle, 60% after 10000 cycles and 50% after 50000 cycles. Fig. 13T presents the SEM images of the MnO2–CNT–polyester textile fiber after 50000 charge–discharge cycles (right image shows a magnified view). A stretchable SC was reported using carbon fibers as the electrode and highly elastic fiber as the substrate.33,204,215,245 Xu and co-workers245 fabricated a stretchable wire-shaped SC using CNT and spandex fiber. Also, a GWF and polymer substrate was used by Zang et al.,33 to realize solid-state stretchable SCs. Cellulose nanofibers such as bleached sulfite wood pulp, cotton, linen, bamboo, viscose, tunicin and bacterial cellulose were also combined with CFs to realize high performance SC configurations.323,330 A knitted fabric sample using the modified cellulose nanofibers is portrayed in Fig. 12S. Zhang et al.181 fabricated a linear SC by twisting two identical core/sheath structured yarns prepared using CNT on a highly conductive metal filament core. Knitted carbon fiber cloth (CFC) coated with activated carbon, carbon coated cotton fabric and polyester microfiber were reported as electrode materials for the fabrication of flexible and lightweight fabric SCs.192,220,225,234 Jost and co-workers234 reported an energy textile using knitted CFC and activated carbon ink, as illustrated in Fig. 11A, which was fabricated in a systematic manner to simultaneously integrate several e-textile components with feel, drape and thickness comparable to conventional fabrics. From Fig. 11B, the electrochemical test demonstrated its excellent flexibility with a capacitance of about 0.51 F cm−2. Furthermore, Lihong Bao and Xiaodong Li192 fabricated an asymmetric SC using two different electrodes, MnO2-activated carbon composite cotton fabric (working electrode) and activated carbon cotton fabric (counter electrode). The device structure is detailed in Fig. 11J. The electrochemical performance was investigated through CV, which resulted in ideal capacitive behavior, as depicted in Fig. 11K. Conventional poly-cotton fabric was modified by spray coating it with carbon ink prepared using a mixture of carbon powder with binder (poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene)), solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) and surfactant. The two as-functionalized fabrics were utilized to fabricate SCs with ammonium salt and PVA-based gel electrolyte (inset of Fig. 13Q). A Swagelok PFA tube was employed to load the stainless steel current collectors with the conductive fabric, which is demonstrated in Fig. (13Q).

A planar SC was reported for the first time by Peng et al.117 using two dimensional MnO2/graphene hybrid nanostructures with a specific capacitance of 267 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 current density, capacitance retention of 92% after 7000 charge/discharge cycles, energy density of 17 W h kg−1 (maximum of 18.64 W h kg−1) and power density of 2520 W kg−1 (maximum of 12.6 kW kg−1). The MnO2 nanosheets improved the absorption and desorption of electrolyte ions and charge transport during the charging and discharging processes. The large surface area together with the fast diffusion of ions in MoS2326,331 helped the SCs to exhibit remarkable capacitive properties. Gao et al.108 realized activated carbon fiber tows (ACFTs) and MoS2 nanosheet-based SC for the application of wearable electronics in both the planar and cable forms. ACFTs with defects and oxygen groups created during the activation process induced excellent adhesion between the ACFTs and MoS2 nanosheets. The cable-type device was fabricated by twisting two as-prepared electrodes and H3PO4-PVA gel was employed as both electrolyte and separator, as can be seen in Fig. 12G. Fig. 12H displays the CV curves observed for different bent angles of the device, which were almost similar with overlaps. Fig. 12I confirms that the as-fabricated device maintained 97.6% of its initial capacitance after recovery.
Graphene, GO and electrochemically reduced GO in bare and hybrid fiber forms have been reported as electrode materials for the fabrication of fiber-shaped SCs.20,30,59,130,141,155,156,159,169,211,216,237,280,320,332 GFs perform differently according to their composition, structure, sheet properties and electrode nanostructures. High rate SCs can be achieved with the vertically grown ErGO sheets on Au (gold) substrates.56 Graphene and graphene nanosheets (GNSs) coated on various substrates such as pure cotton, polyester, poly-cotton, filter paper, polishing cloth, poly(ethylene) (PE) cling film, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), carbon cloth, copper wire and nickel nanocone arrays were used as electrodes to fabricate symmetric and asymmetric SCs.32,90,111,112,191,199,218,325,333 Xie et al.32 reported a gel-based tailorable SC using nickel nanocone arrays deposited with rGO. The developed SC could continuously power an LED when being cut during working, as demonstrated in Fig. 11S. Three cut pieces of SC in series connection were able to energize a minimotor effectively (Fig. 11T). The potential application of tailored SCs was demonstrated further through connecting the SC on the arm part of a jacket, as detailed in Fig. 11U. A carbon cloth coated with thermally reduced GO was demonstrated as a potential candidate for fabricating flexible, high performance SCs.191 As seen from Fig. 11V, no significant changes in the CV curves were observed for the normal and bent SCs, which proved the good electrochemical performance of the device. Fig. 11W and X demonstrate green and red LEDs driven by the as-developed SC as a proof of concept. Pure cotton cloth was also used as a separator for the SC configuration.218 The sandwich-interdigital structure (Fig. 11C) was adopted by Zhou et al.,211 which increased the accessibility of the electrolyte ions by providing more electrolyte-accessible surface area, and consequently enriched the charges stored in the electrode and electrolyte interface. Two identical polyester yarns functionalized with rGO and an electroless deposited Ni coating were employed as electrodes to fabricate a symmetric yarn SC.112Fig. 12E and F show the self-charging energy textile integrated with FNG and SC with the corresponding equivalent circuits. In addition, Liu et al.333 modified cotton yarn using low-cost graphene sheets and Ni through electrochemical deposition and electroless deposition techniques, respectively. The structure of the SC yarn is presented in Fig. 12J. The energy density and power density of the device were remarkably observed to be about 6.1 mW h cm−3 and 1400 mW cm−3, respectively. The Ragone plot presented in Fig. 12K validates the highest energy and power density of the as-proposed device compared with other related works. A fabric woven with functionalized cotton threads is illustrated in Fig. 12L. The electronic conduction and exposed surface areas of graphene sheets can be improved by 3D porous network-like graphene framework; thereby, enhancing the electrochemical performance of SCs.59,130 Aboutalebi and co-workers130 reported multifunctional rGO yarns to fabricate cost-effective high performance SCs with the structure depicted in Fig. 11N. A laser positioning reduction system236 was introduced to reduce the GO fiber in the upper and lower region, which created the rGO/GO/rGO fiber configuration-based SC.150,237 The rGO layers acted as both the electrode and current collector; whereas, the intermediate GO fiber layer in the configuration acted as the separator and electrolyte reservoir. Gopalsamy et al.20 reported bismuth oxide NTs–graphene hybrid fibers as an electrode material for a cost-effective and high performance SC due to their inherent properties such as good electrical transport, excellent capacitance and environmental friendliness.334,335 The hybrid fibers were synthesized with the aid of a wet spinning process, as detailed in Fig. 13K, and their corresponding CV curves for different scan rates are given in Fig. 13L. GFs were also incorporated in CFs to improve the performance of SCs.30,91 Li and co-workers91 synthesized MLG-PC films to fabricate a highly functional SC by wrapping the film on platinum wire, as presented in Fig. 12B. The CNTs combined with GFs reduced the linear resistance due to the increase in the conductivity of GFs.8,104,114,155,156,336 Graphene-based fibers functionalized with CNTs were reported336 for the fabrication of a flexible SC on an Au-coated PET substrate with filter paper soaked in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte as the separator (Fig. 11D). The as-prepared SC resulted in a better performance in both the bent and flat state by continuously powering an LED, which is well exhibited in Fig. 11E and F. The electrochemical performance of the device was justified from the nearly rectangular shape of the CV curves from an extensive range of scan rates, as shown in Fig. 11G. The large specific capacitance of about 180.4 mF cm−2 was achieved by Yu et al.,216 who fabricated an SC using stainless steel fabrics as the current collector and chemically converted graphene as the active material, as presented in Fig. 11O. Ma et al.156 developed a wire-shaped SC (Fig. 12A) using two identical CNT–rGO composite fiber electrodes and PVA-H3PO4 electrolyte, which exhibited a volume capacitance of about 38.8 F cm−3, energy density of about 3.4 mW h cm−3 and excellent cyclic performance. A micro-SC was reported with nitrogen-doped rGO, acid-oxidized SWCNTs and PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte to address the limitation of lower volumetric energy density than batteries.104 The reported micro-SC was connected in series and parallel configurations to meet the demands of specific energy and power. A schematic and equivalent circuit of three devices connected in series and parallel configuration are shown in Fig. 13H. Fig. 13I and J depict the GCD curves of the three devices connected in series and parallel, which confirm the voltage and current were multiplied to the factor of three.
For the first time, Kou and co-workers155 developed a cloth SC using rGO–CNT–carboxymethyl cellulose coaxial fiber with high flexibility and excellent electrochemical properties. A cotton cloth woven with a reported coaxial SC is demonstrated in Fig. 12Q. Fig. 12R shows the ability of the device for applications demanding high flexibility. Furthermore, the SC performance was enhanced when 1 M H2SO4 liquid electrolyte was used (capacitance increased from 177 mF cm−2 to 269 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2). An asymmetric micro-SC was designed by employing rGO and SWCNT fibers.114 The positive electrode was prepared by depositing MnO2 on the rGO–SWCNT fibers and the negative electrode was functionalized by doping nitrogen on the composite fibers since nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials exhibit maximum electrochemical capacitive performances and wide operating voltages. Fig. 13D presents a schematic of the as-prepared asymmetric micro-SC. From Fig. 13E, the flexibility of the device was validated through CV curves from different bending angles of the device, which resulted in no change in the CV curve. A self-powered nanosystem was designed using the as-reported SC in series combination to power a UV photodetector based on ZnO film, as illustrated in Fig. 13F. The corresponding current response is displayed in Fig. 13G. CNF and GO based composite fibers are the best candidates for high-performance SCs.34 GO can also be incorporated on Kevlar fibers to enhance the energy capability of SCs.193 Electrodes comprised of graphene with transition metal sulfides (TMSs) such as NiCo2S4, and transition metal oxides (TMOs) including vanadium oxides (V2O5) and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2, TiS2, TaS2 and NbSe2 have been reported for application in SCs.116,241,324,326 The introduction of TMSs, TMOs and TMDs on the electrode materials increased the SC performance due to their inherent properties. Interestingly, Wang et al.332 designed an integrated energy storage and optoelectronic detector nanodevice on a single fiber using graphene-coated CFs. Zhang and co-workers58 introduced the carbon spheres between graphene sheets to enhance the mesoporous volume and surface area utilization of the graphene sheets, and reported a high performance SC using the as-prepared electrode.58 Oxide NPs (MnO2) deposited on the surface of GF were demonstrated to be a good electrode material for flexible all-solid-state SCs due to their high pseudocapacitive properties.100,109,190,337 Yu et al.190 reported an SC based on graphene/MnO2-textile and CNT-textile as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, which is detailed in Fig. 11H. The as-prepared asymmetric SC resulted in exceptional energy and power density compared to other works, as displayed in Fig. 11I (black points). On the other hand, Guo and co-workers109 demonstrated the fabrication of an SC using graphene/polyester composite fabric deposited with MnO2 sheets via the hydrothermal method, which exhibited exceptional specific capacitance and cycling stability, as seen in Fig. 11P and Q. High capacitance can be achieved over flexible SCs with the introduction of MnO2 NPs on GF, as suggested by Xinming Li's research group.100 The step by step fabrication process is schematically presented in Fig. 13M. The CV curves of the MnO2 NPs-coated GF-based flexible SC exhibited in Fig. 13N confirm the higher current density and greater pseudocapacitance feature. Two different graphene fiber-based electrodes, GF coated with MnO2 and graphene–CNT composite fiber, were utilized to assemble fiber-based asymmetric micro-SCs with excellent electrochemical results.147 The as-realized SC demonstrated a total cell capacitance of 23.6 mF cm−2, operating voltage window of 1.6 V, energy density of 11.9 mW h cm−2 and retained 92.7% of its initial capacitance after 8000 charge–discharge cycles. Chemically modified graphene (CMG) with a very large accessible surface area and outstanding electrical conductivity was reported to produce promising SC electrodes.305 The structure of the device is detailed in Fig. 13O. The CMG-based SCs showed specific capacitance values of 135 and 99 F g−1 in aqueous KOH and organic electrolyte (1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEA BF4)/propylene carbonate (PC) and TEABF4/acetonitrile (AN)), respectively. The internal resistance of the cell calculated from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 13P) was about 0.65 Ω (500 kHz) for the device based on organic electrolyte. Furthermore, the properties of GFs can be altered according to the end application through chemical doping and etching.338,339 Nitrogen (N) atoms are always employed as a dopant since they can form strong valence bonds with carbon atoms and are of comparable atomic size.340 Chang and co-workers341 reported the preparation of an SC using N-doped GFs mats, with exceptional rate capability, cycling stability, energy density (2.24 W h kg−1) and power density (48.7 kW kg−1). Moreover, Liu et al.339 used N-doped CMF composed of natural silk and GO in aqueous solution to fabricate high performance all-solid-state SCs.
Capacitance (C), area-specific capacitance (CA), mass-specific capacitance (Cm), length-specific capacitance (CL), energy density (E) and power density (P) can be calculated using the following expressions:59 (4) (5) (6) (7) E = 0.5CAV2 (in W h cm−2)(8) P = E/tdischarge (in W cm−2)(9)where, ‘I’ denotes discharge current, dV/dt is the slope of the discharge curve, A is the surface area of the fiber electrode, m is the mass of one electrode, L denotes the length of the fiber supercapacitor, V represents the operating voltage and tdischarge is the discharge time.


4.3.5 Fiber battery. 
Studies on flexible and portable electronics have explored various innovative devices including environmental monitoring systems, wearable sensors and medical devices that can be incorporated into textiles, glasses, watches and skin.189,342–350 However, flexible power sources such as NGs,278,351–354 thermoelectric generators,355–362 solar cells,11,276,363–367 SCs55,301,302,368–378 and integrated power fibers107,112,280,379–382 are required to operate these devices because conventional sources are heavy, bulky, rigid and unsuitable for wearable electronics.383,384 Fiber batteries are the best alternative to SCs as a flexible power source due to their higher energy storage density and excellent cycling performance.110,256 Batteries developed from zinc-silver composites317 and lithium ions384 are used in limited applications because their raw materials are costly despite their higher energy density and voltage. On the other hand, the zinc–carbon batteries proposed by Li et al.194 eradicated the above limitations by adopting them as the primary power source, making use of their low internal resistance and high energy density. To fabricate the as-proposed battery, two electrodes of Zn powder on CF as the negative electrode and MnO2 on CF as the positive electrode were placed parallel to each other with NH4Cl–ZnCl2 liquid electrolyte and insulated enameled wire as the separator on a flexible and transparent plastic tube (Fig. 13U). The performance results of the developed battery194 were given as: open circuit voltage of 1.5 V, discharge capacity of (i) 166, (ii) 158, (iii) 141 and (iv) 137 mA h g−1 at the discharge density of 70 mA g−1 or 1.3 mA cm−2, length-capacity of (i) 8.3 × 10−2, (ii) 0.17, (iii) 0.21 and (iv) 0.29 mA h cm−1, area-capacity of (i) 0.88, (ii) 1.50, (iii) 1.56 and (iv) 1.85 mA h cm−2, length of 5.0 cm, discharge current of 0.4 mA, discharge capacity of (i) 0.15, (ii) 0.14, (iii) 9.3 × 10−2 and (iv) 7.2 × 10−2 mA h cm−1, energy density of 0.20, 0.15, 0.093, and 0.065 mW h cm−1 at the discharge current of 0.15, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.5 mA, respectively, no loss reported on discharge capacity when the length of the battery increased from 2.0 cm to 8.0 cm and bending radius of 3.0, 1.5 and 0.7 cm. The numbers (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) denote the MnO2 load of 0.5, 1.1, 1.5 and 2.1 mg cm−1, respectively. The digital photographs of the device in the straight and bent states are presented in Fig. 13V, and a glowing LED driven by two series connected fiber batteries is also illustrated in the same figure. It is evident from the discharge curves observed for the two different negative electrode (Zn wire and Zn powder/carbon fiber)-based devices (Fig. 13W) that the Zn powder/carbon fiber-based device yielded the better performance. Fig. 13X presents the efficient use of MnO2 in the lower discharge current. Interesting CNT-based battery materials such as wire-shaped lithium-ion battery derived from two aligned MWCNT/lithium oxide composite yarns as the anode and cathode, spring-like fiber electrodes made up of twisted aligned MWCNT combined with LiMn2O4 and Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticles as the positive and negative electrodes and twisted MWCNT/Si composite fiber anodes were reported in the literature.385–387

4.4 Sensors and actuators
The advancements in flexible and stretchable electronics have helped researchers realize wearable sensors to observe various human activities including speech recognition, sleep quality evaluation, respiration monitoring, pulse monitoring, body motion detection and recording.350,388–390Table 5 depicts the mechanical sensors based on carbon nanostructured fibers. CNTs,6 graphene98 and metallic nanowires391 have potential application in mechanical sensors since they are flexible with enhanced electrical properties. Sensors are developed with the focus on high sensitivity to detect even small deformations with a wide sensing range and to sense multiple forms of mechanical activities. Hierarchically arranged helical actuating fibers from MWCNTs demonstrated light weight, flexibility and good mechanical strength.392 The interesting fact is that the large number of nanometre- and micrometre-sized gaps created in the fibers is attributed to their fast responsiveness and considerable actuation outputs. Therefore, the compactly arranged coils formed inside the fibers provide a stable structure, which can effectively prevent excessive untwisting giving rise to a fiber with rotational reversibility. Cheng et al.217 developed a strain sensor based on a graphene composite fiber with the properties of sensing tensile strain, bending and torsion, which was feasible to meet the above objectives. The fiber strain sensor was fabricated by coating rGO on the surface of an elastic substrate developed using plasma-treated polyurethane and polyester fiber-based double-covered yarn. The prepared composite fiber was integrated into a PDMS slab to realize bending detection. Furthermore, a torsion sensor was demonstrated by utilizing the twisting microstructure of the polyester fiber, which detected abundant mechanical deformations. CNTs were attached to a stretchable substrate for the fabrication of a strain sensor that precisely monitored large-scale and rapid human motions including movement, typing, breathing and phonation.6,171 Yamada et al.6 used PDMS as a stretchable substrate and a droplet of isopropyl alcohol was introduced into the structure to pack SWCNTs densely without additional mechanical pressure. The as-fabricated sensor was placed in a stocking and a data glove to validate its possible applications, as shown in Fig. 14Q and R. The data glove sent signals related to the movements of each finger separately and precisely for assessing the hand configuration, which is demonstrated in Fig. 14S. Accordingly, Ryu and coworkers171 used Ecoflex (platinum-catalyzed, highly elastic silicone material) as a flexible substrate to fabricate an ultra-high stretchable and wearable strain sensor. The resistance response to strain of the free-standing and Ecoflex-supported CNT fiber-based devices with and without strain is depicted in Fig. 14J. Furthermore, the hand glove with the strain sensor was demonstrated to detect human finger movements and placed on the elbow to monitor biaxial movements, as illustrated in Fig. 14K. The aligned CNTs deformed when the sensor was stretched and the change in the resistance was recorded to measure the acceleration, pressure, tension and strain.

A silk fabric was functionalized to fabricate a highly sensitive strain sensor by Wang and co-workers.253 The advantages of carbon-based natural biomaterials such as good electrical conductivity, environmental friendliness and large-scale production with low-cost make them good candidates for the wearable electronic applications. High sensitivity in the strain sensors was achieved through carbonized silk fibers. A schematic illustration of the fabrication of the device is detailed in Fig. 14D. The strain sensor fabricated using carbonized silk fabric resulted in a gauge factor of about 9.6 for strain in the range of 0 to 250%, 37.5 for 250% to 500% and 5.8 for even 0 to 1% strain. A knitted fabric produced using continuous stainless steel and short carbon fibers was introduced to fabricate a textile-based electrical strain gauge, which measured large strains under high temperature.235 This sensor worked based on the principle of the variations in the electrical resistance between the overlapping yarns in the knitted structure due to the change in the number of contacting surface fibers during structure deformation, as seen in Fig. 14G. A fabric was knitted using steel and carbon in a tubular form, as depicted in Fig. 14H. The temperature dependence of the resistance was evaluated for various strain percentages, where consistent resistance results were observed at higher temperature, which are detailed in Fig. 14I. Carbon-loaded silicon rubber was laser treated by Hui Zhang et al.393 to fabricate a strain sensor that monitored the physiological or biomechanical parameters of the human body by recording the variations in contact resistances. Du et al.196 reported a wearable sensor based on graphene nonwoven fabric, which sensed mechanical movements and monitor human motions, pulses (Fig. 14T) and respiration (Fig. 14U). This sensor was prepared using the graphene coated non-woven fabric with the highest gauge factor of −7.1 at 1% strain. Graphene fibers have been reported for the fabrication of highly stretchable and sensitive strain sensors based on their inherent electrical and mechanical properties.240 Park et al.240 proposed a wearable strain sensor, which was prepared using graphene nanoplatelets and stretchable yarns (rubber, nylon covered rubber and wool) via the layer-by-layer assembly technique. The structural variations of the rubber, nylon-covered rubber and wool yarns under strain can be visualized in Fig. 14L. The resistance change response of the sensor glove with wool yarn in the index finger and nylon-covered rubber yarn in the middle finger for the finger movements is displayed in Fig. 14M and N, respectively. The opposite sensing responses were observed for the index and middle finger movements. The sensor prepared using the rubber yarns showed a gauge factor of about 1800 with a maximum strain of up to 100%. The conducting composite material synthesized by Boland and co-workers5 using natural rubber and liquid-exfoliated graphene was used to fabricate a low-cost, light weight strain sensor with high sensitivity (gauge factor of up to 35) and high strain range (800%). The potential application of the as-fabricated strain sensor was demonstrated by attaching the sensor to the index finger knuckle to monitor high-strain and repeated bending motions of the finger, as presented in Fig. 14O and P. The polycrystalline structure of GWFs makes it the best candidate for strain sensor applications.98,101–103 GWF was developed via atmospheric pressure CVD, where the carbon source was methane and the template was woven copper mesh. A strain sensor was fabricated by embedding the GWFs into a polymer (PDMS) substrate, and the resistance response related to the applied strain was measured for monitoring various activities and recognizing sound signals. The fabrication process for growing GWFs on a PDMS substrate is illustrated in Fig. 14A. Fig. 14B shows a sample sensor with a wire connected to it. The calculated gauge factor for various strain (∼103 for 2–6% strain, 106 for >7% strain) is given in Fig. 14C.98 The GWF-based strain sensor positioned around human skin, as shown in Fig. 14E, exhibited variations in resistance for different tensile strain, as seen in Fig. 14F.103
Generally, the gauge factor can be calculated using the following expression:393 (10)where, R denotes the resistance and L represents the length.
A textile-based piezo resistive sensor394,395 was formed conventionally by coating a thin layer of piezo-resistive materials on fabrics to measure the strain for the application of biomedical signal measurements such as respiration detection.396,397 However, a limitation of the conventional sensor design is that the structure of the fabric affects the performance of the sensor, such as reduced performance after washing and folding, poor repeatability and low dynamic range. To overcome these problems, Huang et al.27 arrived at the solution of fabricating a piezo-resistive sensor with improved sensing characteristics. Yarns comprised of piezo-resistive fibers, elastics and regular polyester fibers were used as a base element for the sensor instead of fabrics. Carbon-coated fiber (CCF) with a resistivity of 3 × 105 Ω cm−1 was used as the piezo-resistive fiber and wrapped on the core yarn together with elastic and polyester fibers. The linear density and strength capability can be improvised by the addition of polyester filament and the sensor can be stretched by means of elastic fibers (Lycra). The as-prepared yarn was used in a respiration monitoring system as a piezo-resistive sensor to measure the variations in the resistance when the air pressure changed in an artificial lung. The experimental results revealed that the relationship between the resistance and the strain has linear function for both the single- and double-wrapped yarns.27 However, the double-wrapped yarn showed higher linearity due to its symmetric structure and lower sensitivity because of its lateral force on par with the single-wrapped yarn. The resistance and force curves revealed that the yarns could sustain forces about 0.3 and 0.4 kg (single-wrapped and double-wrapped) under strain (ΔL/L) of about 23%. Furthermore, the potential of the sensor was demonstrated by designing two different sized garments with an elastic band stitched on it for kids and adults, as portrayed in Fig. 15E. The length of the elastic band was same in both cases, even though the sample for kid was smaller than that for the adult. A higher breath per minute (BPM) (normal: 10–20) is observed for adults in the case of tachypnea and lower BPM (normal: >30) for kids in the case of apnea. From Fig. 15F and G, 10 and 30 BPM were measured precisely using the as-prepared samples since this BPM range is important for a healthy heart in both adults and children, respectively. The excellent electrical and mechanical properties of the GWFs drove Lee et al.82 to realize a piezo-resistor for flexible touch sensing applications. The sensor was fabricated by transferring the fabric onto flexible PDMS with deposited Ti/Au electrodes as the substrate (Fig. 15A and B). The resistance of the GWFs was highly sensitive to even small deformations, which is a prerequisite for touching sensors. When pressure was applied to the prepared piezo-resistor, the higher sensitivity of GWF caused a change in the area of the touching pressure resistance, forming the foundation to realize the piezo-resistor as a flexible touch sensor. An experimental setup was designed to test the touching response of the electrodes (represented by letters) with four divided touching areas, including ODAB, OBCE, OGFD, and OEHG, as detailed in Fig. 15C. The test results of the force touching point in the OBCE area were also obtained. The variation in the resistance was observed for the related touching force on four pairs of electrodes namely OA, OB, OC and OD (base point was O). As shown in Fig. 15D, the electrode pair OC resulted in continuous variations in resistance; whereas, the other pairs of electrodes did not show significant changes.

Wang et al.61 reported a fiber actuator using graphene and PPy composite fibers. The composite fiber was prepared by depositing PPy on the surface of graphene fibers fixed on Ni rods with electrolyte, as schematically presented in Fig. 15P. When the composite fiber was subjected to applied potentials, the fiber displaced towards the right and left directions according to the polarity of the potential, which realized the actuation principle. Fig. 15Q and R depict the corresponding CV curves, value of bending angles to the applied potential and the durability test over 100 cycles. Taking advantage of this principle, a micro-tweezer was fabricated using two composite fibers connected with one Ni wire electrode. For the applied voltages in the range of −0.8 V to 0.8 V, the tweezer opened and closed the open ends of the composite fiber in order to grab small objects. Tri-armed tweezers were also demonstrated by connecting three prepared GF-PPy fibers on a Cu tube for lifting slightly heavy objects. On the other hand, a moisture-triggered actuator was designed by Cheng et al.236 from region-asymmetric graphene/GO fibers prepared with the aid of the positioned laser reduction technique, as seen in Fig. 15S. The SEM image and photograph of the reported fiber are portrayed in Fig. 15T and U. From Fig. 15V, the I–V characteristics of the fiber after the laser treatment showed excellent results compared to the fiber before the treatment. The synthesized fiber was actuated when subjected to moist air of 80% relative humidity (RH) and returned to its original state once the atmospheric condition (RH = 25%) was restored. The fiber bent in the opposite direction when the RH was reduced below ambient conditions, which is depicted in Fig. 15W. The corresponding change in the bending degree related to the RH is indicated in Fig. 15X. In addition, a microfiber walking device was demonstrated using the prepared fiber, which moved along a channel experiencing a variation in atmospheric conditions. Fibers that could change their colour with respect to the electrical current, which is observable with the naked eye, are great candidates for sensing. Such current-induced colour changing fibers were realized from CNT/PDA, which vary its colour from blue to red when subjected to mechanical abrasion in seconds. This was caused by the interactions between the nanotubes and polymers and the unique electrical properties of the nanotubes.398
Safety is an important parameter for any field of research. Accordingly, fiber-based temperature sensors incorporated on textile materials can protect users from any increase in body temperature. The protective wear especially demand these types of sensors to be introduced in their structure. Sibinski and co-workers399 reported a temperature sensor on a single yarn using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and MWCNTs composite fibers, as seen in Fig. 15M, which addressed the limitations of previously reported graphite–polymer based sensors400 and could be directly integrated into conventional textiles due to its excellent flexibility. The electric contact on the composite fiber was made through conductive polymer paste with silver metallic filler. Finally, the sensor was encapsulated using silicon paste as an isolating material to protect the sensor from environmental dangers. They prepared a fiber temperature sensor for measuring the temperature range of 30 °C to 45 °C with a temperature coefficient of 0.13% K−1. The variation in the resistivity in the sensors fabricated using graphite–polymer paste and CNT paste under dynamic mechanical stress is presented in Fig. 15N and O, respectively. Commercially available textile yarns such as cotton, polyester and nylon were functionalized using carbon materials to fabricate wearable sensors for gas sensing applications. Yun et al.40 realized a washable and flexible gas sensor by coating graphene on cotton and polyester yarns with bovine serum albumin (Fig. 15H). The functionalized yarns were wound on a plastic bobbin to validate its flexibility, as shown in Fig. 15(I). From Fig. 15K and L, the above-mentioned gas sensor responded well for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas even under different bending states of the yarns. When the yarn was exposed to gas, the resistance of the yarn changed, which in turn triggered the LED to glow, as demonstrated in Fig. 15J. Our group recently published an interesting work based on a flexible wrist strap sensor, which can be a great compliment in the field of smart wearable gadgets.7 This device was fabricated using a polydiacetylene/MoS2 nanocomposite (PDA/MoS2) film, which served as an excellent candidate in sensing DMF with a visible blue to red color change detected by the naked eye. We also studied flexible films from nanocomposite networks of polyaniline and CNTs aimed at high-performance gas sensing.401 Interestingly, they will be great additions to the current research if they can be woven into fabrics.402
4.5 Medical application electrocardiography electrode
In the medical field, the electrocardiography (ECG) test is carried out to understand and monitor the electrical activity of the heart by means of capturing the biopotential differences on the body by positioning electrodes on the skin around the chest and limbs.403 The electrodes consist of a sensing region (Ag/AgCl), conductive gel and an adhesive backing pad as three main parts that may cause skin irritation and discomfort due to drying of the conductive gel.404 Thus, to suppress this discomfort, dry ECG electrodes were studied as an alternative. There are many reports demonstrating dry ECG electrodes including contact-type electrodes, non-contact-type electrodes,405,406 and textile-based ECG electrodes fabricated by electroplating and deposition,407 screen printing of conductive pastes408 and sewing or embroidery of metallic threads.409 These techniques are limited due to their disadvantages of requiring initial conductive seed layer on the textile (electroplating), dedicated equipment and constrained conductivity (deposition and screen printing) together with unreliable textile texture and feel (metal embroidery). Yapici et al.15 proposed durable, flexible, comfortable and straightforward dry ECG electrodes based on a graphene-clad textile, as described in Fig. 16A. The graphene-clad textile ECG electrodes were made by dipping a nylon fiber-based textile material into a graphene oxide suspension, which was further heated and dried to clad the fabric. The resulting fabric was used as an ECG electrode and performance tests were conducted. As seen from Fig. 16B and C, the as-produced electrode showed impedance ranging from 87.5 kΩ (at 10 Hz) to 11.6 kΩ (at 1 kHz) and the recorded ECG signals had 97% overlap, except for a slight variation in the baseline compared with the recorded ECG signals of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes.

4.6 Other applications
To explore the full potential of graphene fibers, an attempt to develop unconventional fiber devices has been reported.137 A moisture-driven rotational motor was developed using twisted GO fibers by utilizing the expansion/contraction property of GO layers when they were subjected to humidity due to their oxygen-rich functional groups (Fig. 16D–F). The variations in humidity resulted in a reversible torsional rotation due to the helical geometry of the twisted GO fibers. The adsorption of water molecules by the twisted GO fibers (TGF) caused volumetric expansion, and thus reverse rotation (due to the decrease in the twist degree) of the fiber; whereas, the absence of moisture recovered the fiber to its original state. The SEM images of the TGF after exposure to different RH are portrayed in Fig. 16H. At a relative humidity (RH) of about 85% and 4.7% expansion along the axis, the fiber actuated the paddle (mass of 60 times and diameter of 50 times the actuating fiber) to rotate with a maximum torsional rotation rate of up to 5190 revolutions per minute with 327 full turns, as depicted in Fig. 16G. Furthermore, the fiber maintained stable forward and backward rotation during 500 reversible rotation cycles (Fig. 16I). The observed maximum start-up torque (t = Ia) was 14.8 nNm with the moment of inertia of the paddle (I) of ∼8.78 × 10−11 kg m−2 and initial paddle acceleration (‘a’) of 169 rad s−1. Further, a new type of humidity switch and a promising moisture-triggered electric generator, as exhibited in Fig. 16J, were developed by taking advantage of the moisture-responsive actuation behavior of the twisted GO fibers. From Fig. 16K and L, an open-circuit voltage of up to 1 mV and short-circuit current of up to 40 μA were produced by the proposed generator configuration. The various applications are tabulated in Table 6.

Wearable wireless communication is attracting researchers towards the development of communication devices due to the advancements in the synthesis of carbon materials and fabrication techniques. The information in wireless communication systems is generally transferred through radio frequency signals. Active and passive components such as power amplifier, low-noise amplifier, frequency mixer, local oscillator, antennas, transmission lines and impedance matching networks are integrated into wireless networks to transmit and receive signals effectively. A low cost, highly flexible and conductive printed graphene, as seen in Fig. 16M, was reported by Huang and co-workers222 for wireless wearable communication applications. The conductivity and surface resistance of the printed graphene could be controlled by compressing it to a certain percentage. It was demonstrated that an 81% compression ratio (6.0 μm thickness) resulted in increased conductivity of about 4.3 × 104 S m−1 (uncompressed: 8.3 × 102 S m−1) and the corresponding surface resistance decreased to a value of about 3.8 Ω sq−1 from 38.0 Ω sq−1, as presented in Fig. 16N. The corresponding SEM images of the printed graphene samples under different compression ratios are given in Fig. 16O–R. Flexible transmission lines and antennas were developed on a paper substrate using the printed graphene for transmitting, radiating and receiving RF signals. Fig. 16S confirms that the attenuation of the transmission lines was controlled by the gap between the lines. When the gap was large, the attenuation was low and vice versa. Further, a linear propagation constant (β) was observed for the related frequency, which resulted in slight phase distortion in the lines, as shown in Fig. 16T. The proposed work demonstrated its potential application in the field of wearable wireless communications by fixing two wearable antennas on the wrist of a mannequin with a distance of about 0.5 m to transmit and receive RF signals, as shown in Fig. 16U. The effective transmission of the signals between the two attached antennas was validated through the transmission against frequency response curve, as given in Fig. 16V.
A colour-tunable, weavable fiber-shaped polymer light-emitting electrochemical cell (PLEC) was devised, exhibiting a coaxial structure made up of a modified metal wire cathode and a conducting aligned CNT sheet anode with an electroluminescent polymer layer sandwiched between them. The excellent fiber design made the luminance process independent of the observation angle and the CNT alignment played a major role in reducing the light loss on par with indium tin oxide used in traditional organic LEDs.410 ZnO nanoparticles were employed as an electron transfer layer to aid in preventing fluorescence quenching in the electroluminescent polymer by the metal matrix, reducing the leakage current for a significant increase in current efficiency and creating an equal injection of electrons and holes. Additionally, one can also aim to attain a spectrum of colors with the combination of two fiber-shaped PLECs to emit various colours along with current-tunable continuous luminance.
5. Future perspectives
E-textiles will conquer the future society in day-to-day products of sports, medical monitoring devices, accessories, fashion, etc. Weavable multifunctional yarns based on nanostructures can be well-integrated into smart clothing to make them more flexible and durable, supplementing great improvement in their advantages compared to that of thin film and bulk composites. The demanding study of interfaces in devices based on these materials is another interesting area that needs to be explored. The diverse 2D materials such as TMDs, black phosphorus and topological insulators certainly hold great promise in the field of wearable electronics since they possess astonishing properties that can be tuned by the number of layers. These materials have great capability owing to their self-limiting character, which make them emerging candidates to form a major research area expanding from nanoscale towards two-dimensionality; thereby, opening new doors to understand their properties in potential wearable electronics. This will have a great impact on the translation of properties of layered materials for the advancement of textiles with respect to manufacturing, cost and device fabrication.
Quantum dots based on TMDs are free-standing and can be easily integrated in any fiber fabrication process via easy techniques such as electrospinning and wet spinning, making them advantageous. However, there are only a few reports in the field of TMD-based wearable devices, and thus, this area should be studied more to utilize their striking properties towards wearable sensors and actuators. TMD-based nanostructured materials can be easily synthesized using mechanical exfoliation, chemical exfoliation and simple wet chemical methods, which forms the precursors for the subsequent fiber making process. Fibers from TMDs can be easily obtained from modified fabrication techniques that combines both the process of liquid exfoliation and fiber formation. This can be possible with the aid of a novel table-top electrospinning instrument, where the precursors taken in the syringe must be derived from the output of the probe sonicator. Sonicated 2D nanosheets can be made to flow directly through the syringe, thereby minimizing the impurities and impact from external influences such as humidity and oxidation. A similar type of process can also be extended to the wet-spinning of TMD fibers.
Wearable electronics in the medical field based on carbon nanostructured fibers is another essential field of research, which needs to be studied in detail. We have come across an interesting research work in the field of patient monitoring systems to help doctors manipulate parameters such as patient blood pressure, temperature and pulse rate by means of a glove with E-ink and electronic circuitry, which incorporates a display, sensors, camera, and wireless technology.411 The glove was fabricated using conductive fabrics developed through weaving metal strands for the construction of the textile, which acted as the medium for the electronic circuits without the assistance of patient monitors or devices. The monitoring glove with a camera can be utilized during surgery for seeing organs or for telemedicine. Thus, more detailed studies are encouraged to focus on the technical point of view, which will be a great aid for the advancement of this field of research. The internal properties required for a surgical or non-surgical glove such as protection against germs, touching blood, bodily fluids, bodily tissues, mucous membranes, broken skin, contamination of materials during handling and other issues such as flexibility, ease to adjust with skin, easy to put on the hands must be addressed by the conductive fabric.
As the current research is moving towards wearable devices, we suggest the powerful candidates of TMDs and elemental materials for these applications; thereby, opening a new gateway in realizing fibers. The main aim of this review is to shed light on the unexplored areas in the development of flexible and wearable devices based on fibers from two-dimensional materials that are not explored much.
