    , Accepted 30th March 2014First published on 31st March 2014AbstractDSSCs have been extensively investigated in the past decade, and the search for more efficient dyes for DSSCs remains challenging. In this work we discuss the influences of elongating π-spacers and rigidifying dithiophene on the performance of dithiafulvenyl (DTF)-based organic dyes using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT methods. We show that systematically elongating the π-spacer of the DTF-2P dye by increasing the number of thiophene groups tends to red-shift the absorption peak and broaden the absorption range, thus improving the light-harvesting efficiency of DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T. Furthermore, among the three dyes, DTF-2P-T would have the best performance because it performs nicely on the key parameters including the electron injection driving force (D), the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), and the shift of the TiO2 conduction band (ΔEcb). In particular, DTF-2P-2T has a larger LHE despite the smaller D and ΔEcb compared with DTF-2P-T. Having realized the great merits of modification on π-spacers, afterwards, we designed a novel dye by rigidifying the dithiophene moiety of DTF-2P-2T. The resulting dye is proven to be very promising to challenge the conversion efficiency 8.29% of DTF-2P-T due to the improved ΔEcb and LHE. Our theoretical studies are expected to provide valuable insights into the molecular design of novel DTF-based dyes for the optimization of DSSC.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the emerging solar technologies that provide a promising alternative to lower the cost and improve the conversion efficiency of sunlight-to-electricity devices. Extensive interest has been focused on this technology since it was initiated by the report by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991.1 In this type of device, a dye absorbs the infrared–visible light and transfers the photoexcited electron to a wide band-gap semiconductor electrode consisting of a mesoporous oxide layer composed of nanometer-sized particles in the presence of an iodide/iodine redox electrolyte.
To date, the Ru complex photo-sensitizers such as N3 and N719 compounds have shown a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 11% on average.2,3 As a matter of fact, on the one hand, this efficiency is far away from the efficiency of conventional silicon-based solar cells (about 15–25%).4 On the other hand, the performance is leveling out. Snaith5 pointed out that the N719 family based cells have almost reached their maximum efficiency. On account of these, more recently, metal-free organic dyes have been increasingly studied as alternative dyes to Ru complex photo-sensitizers, due to their lower cost, higher molar absorption coefficients, simple synthesis routes, and various structures as well as unlimited resources. At present, the impressive performance of these organic sensitizers has yielded an efficiency over 12% for the record C259 dye in 2013.6 The higher performance of metal-free organic dyes is expected to be achieved as long as the molecular modifications are carefully considered.
Generally, the overall conversion efficiency (η) of DSSC can be expressed as follows: η = JscVoc(ff)/Is(1)where Jsc is the photocurrent density measured at short circuit, Voc is the open circuit photovoltage, (ff) is the fill factor of the cell, and Is is the intensity of the incident light. The value of fill factor can be assumed to be between 0 and 1 and is defined by the ratio of the maximum power (Jmax × Vmax) of the solar cell divided by Voc and Jsc. Therefore, according to eqn (1), the product of Voc and Jsc should be optimized to improve the efficiency.
The metal-free organic dye sensitizers all almost have electron-donating and electron-accepting groups connected by a π-conjugated (D–π–A) structure. In this case, the excited state responsible for the electron injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor is generated by a charge transfer (CT) transition from the donor to the acceptor group through the π-spacer. In addition to the general requirements for obtaining a better performance, commonly, the dye should have the following properties: a good conjugation across the dye molecule to promote the intramolecular charge transfer; strong absorption band which could cover almost all visible and near-infrared light region to maximize the light-harvesting efficiency; appropriate positions of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels to facilitate electron injection and dye generation; strong electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dye and the semiconductor conduction band (CB) for the sake of efficient electron injection from the dye onto the semiconductor surface.7
Although remarkable advance has been made in the use of organic dyes as sensitizers for DSSCs, there are still enormous incentives in the design of novel and more efficient sensitizers. Nowadays, key developments on D–π–A dyes have involved (1) decreasing the HOMO–LUMO energy gap to extend (red-shift) the optical absorption wavelength region and enhance the molar extinction coefficients for a high photocurrent performance and (2) tuning steric geometries and/or electronic structures of a dye to regulate the electronic structure characters of the dye/titania/electrolyte interface for a reasonable open-circuit photovoltage performance. As we know laboratory studies of dye sensitizer design often involve a trial-and-error approach which is time consuming and expensive. In this regard, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) methods can be of great help in the design of novel dyes with improved performance, providing a deep understanding of the character of the excited states involved in the absorption and injection processes. In light of these, we are not surprised that rational designs of organic dyes together with state-of-the-art theoretical calculation have been successfully employed in some cases.8–12
Recently, two dithiafulvenyl (DTF)-based organic dyes (DTF-2P and DTF-2P-T as shown in Fig. 1), with the DTF derivatives and the cyanoacrylic acid moiety as the electron donor and electron acceptor, respectively, have been investigated by Guo and co-workers13 due to their excellent electron-donating capability and out-of-plane butterfly shape which can provide steric hindrance, preventing self-aggregation of the sensitizer. Both the two dyes have the same donor and acceptor but differing in the biphenyl (DTF-2P) and phenyl-thiophene-phenyl (DTF-2P-T) π-spacers. In comparison with DTF-2P, the efficiency of the DTF-2P-based device is significantly improved by introducing a thiophene unit (from merely 4.18% for DTF-2P to 8.29% for DTF-2P-T). However, what is the origin of such high efficiency of the DTF-2P-T-based cell in comparison with the DTF-2P-based cell? Furthermore, it is also unclear whether the efficiency can be improved by further elongating the π-spacer of DTF-2P-T? Motivated by this, an all-sided apprehension about the issues involved on the basis of theoretical methods is desired.
 Fig. 1  Sketches of the investigated dyes. 
In this work, for the purpose of discussion, we designed a novel dye (DTF-2P-2T, Fig. 1) by introducing another thiophene group into the π-spacer based on DTF-2P-T. Our strategy is to test systematically the influence of the extended π-spacer on the performance of these dyes (DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T, and DTF-2P-2T). The calculated results suggested that the absorption properties and electronic structures of these dyes can be gradually tuned by elongating the π-spacers. For instance, the absorption peaks red-shift from DTF-2P to DTF-2P-2T due to the decreased HOMO–LUMO gap. The electronic coupling strength between the LUMO of the dye and TiO2 CB was first increased for DTF-2P-T and then decreased for DTF-2P-2T compared with that of DTF-2P. From the theoretical examination of some key parameters which have been applied successfully in our previous work14 and other publications8,15 including the electron injection driving force (D), the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), and the shift of the semiconductor conduction band (ΔEcb), we demonstrated that DTF-2P-T would have the best photocurrent and photovoltage performance among the three dyes. Our investigated results are also in excellent agreement with the experimentally observed efficiency difference between DTF-2P and DTF-2P-T. In particular, we further considered the following two types of modifications based upon DTF-2P-2T: (1) covalent immobilization of two thiophene rings with the fastening C atom (DTF-2P-2T-C, Fig. 1) or unfastening S atom (DTF-2P-2T-S, Fig. 1) and (2) replacement of the dithiophene moiety with a thienothiophene moiety (DTF-2P-Bi, Fig. 1). Both strategies are expected to enhance the rigidity of dithiophene, and through this way, the rotational disorder of molecules can be efficiently suppressed. Furthermore, we found that with these modifications, the corresponding photocurrent and photovoltage performance can be gradually tuned, and as a consequence, the candidates for achieving improved efficiency compared with DTF-2P-T can be screened.
2. Computation details
In the present work, the ground state geometries of the isolated dyes have been fully optimized using the Gaussian 09 program package16 with the three-parameter functional of Becke and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (B3LYP)17,18 using a standard 6-31G(d)19 basis set on all atoms. Frequency calculations at the same level were performed to confirm each stationary point to be a true energy minimum. For the sake of computation convenience, the long alkyl chain of the dyes was replaced by a methyl group. The polarizable continuum model (PCM)20 including the solvent effect of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was adopted for evaluating bulk solvent effects on the UV-vis absorption spectrum.
It is well-known that the charge transfer excitation, Rydberg states, and multiple excitations cannot be adequately modeled by commonly employed approximate density functional for the exchange–correlation (XC) energy that tends to severely underestimate the transition energies of these states. This is due to the lack of asymptotic 1/r long-range behavior of Coulomb interaction.21 In order to solve this difficulty, the range-separated hybrid functionals, which incorporate a given fraction of nonlocal Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange, are methods of choice. For the sake of checking the reliability, we use four XC functionals including B3LYP, PBE0,22 LC-wPBE,23,24 and BHandH25 to investigate the excitation energy of dyes on the basis of the optimized ground state geometries. The detailed discussion is provided in Section 3.1.
In order to investigate the dye–TiO2 interactions, we prepared a stoichiometric cluster of anatase titania (TiO2)38, exposing its (101) surface. The (TiO2)38 cluster model has been developed and successfully applied for investigations of sensitization of nano-TiO2 in earlier studies.26 As the cluster structure was very large and thus requires relatively much computation cost, we used the plane-wave DFT code VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package)27–30 to optimize the ground-state geometry of the (TiO2)38 cluster and dye–(TiO2)38 complex. The Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)31,32 were used to account for the exchange–correlation effects. An energy cutoff of 400 eV and Γ point k-sampling were used, and the optimization will stop when the force on each atom is smaller than 0.05 eV Å−1 in magnitude. Each dye–titania complex was separated from its images by addition of vacuum layers (9 Å thick) in the x-, y- and z-directions. Subsequently, the VASP optimized geometries were used for single point TDDFT calculation to determine the HOMO, LUMO, and lowest excitation energy using the Gaussian 09 software suit.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The structures and properties of free dyes
The optimized structures of the investigated dyes, along with the selected values of dihedral angle, are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Compared with DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T has an additional thiophene group inserted as a π-spacer. The π-spacer in DTF-2P-2T is further elongated by introducing another thiophene group. For all dyes considered here, the cyanoacrylic acid group is found to be coplanar with the adjacent phenyl ring, indicating a facile extension of conjugation between the π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid groups. Due to the steric repulsion between the two phenyl rings, the nonplanarity exists at the π-spacer of DTF-2P with a phenyl–phenyl dihedral angle of 34°. As illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†), compared with DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T, DTF-2P would have the larger deviation from the planarity. This fact suggests that inserting one or two thiophene units between the two phenyl rings of DTF-2P tends to improve the π-conjugation extent, and this may also contribute to the high absorption coefficients and red-shifted absorption spectra for DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T dyes.

Table 1 presents the calculated energy levels of the three dyes obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, which might be involved in the photoexcitation process. We can see from Table 1 that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the three dyes become more and more stabilized as the π-spacer elongates. Herein, the negative shifts of the LUMO (0.08 and 0.12 eV) and the positive shifts of the HOMO (0.10 and 0.21 eV) were observed for DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T versus DTF-2P, respectively, leading to the decrease of their energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO compared with DTF-2P. That could be attributed to the extension of the π-spacer improving the conjugation length. Since the donor and acceptor moiety are the same in all dyes, the HOMO and LUMO energies do not show substantial variations along the series.

Table 2 presents the calculated excitation energy of DTF-2P and DTF-2P-T using different XC functional in the TDDFT method with respect to the experimental results. The TDDFT excitation energies are generally conceded to be within a 0.40 eV deviation from experimental data when common functionals were used, and the average errors of λmax for organic dyes are often smaller than this upper limit. For instance, Guillaumont and Nakamura33 simulated the maximum absorption wavelength for a set of organic dyes with an average deviation close to 0.20 eV. As presented in Table 2, the lowest lying excitation energy of DTF-2P was predicted to be 397, 513, 552, and 341 nm (3.13, 2.42, 2.25, and 3.63 eV), respectively, when BHandH, PBE0, B3LYP, and LC-wPBE functionals were employed. For the BHandH functional, it seems to produce the most stable and reliable results, providing the absolute variation of 0.08 eV with respect to experimental data, in agreement with the level of accuracy expected at this level of theory. The long range-corrected hybrid functional, LC-wPBE, overestimating the λmax values with absolute deviations of 0.58 eV, is probably inappropriate to investigate the charge transfer properties of dyes in the present work. Particularly, in the case of the B3LYP functional, a much larger error was computed (0.8 eV). This discrepancy can be ascribed to the following reasons: although B3LYP is an improvement over the conventional functionals in predicting the energies for charge transfer transitions, the 1/r long-range asymptotic behavior of the CT states is not fully corrected (it is still not perfect with its 0.2 1/r dependence instead of 1/r), for this reason, the excitation energies for the charge transfer interactions are underestimated within B3LYP. A previous publication points out that this error increases with increasing distance between the electron donor and electron acceptor.34 As expected, we also observed a similar trend for DTF-2P-T. Therefore, judging from the results listed in Table 2, it is obvious that BHandH is the functional of choice for the UV-vis spectra simulation.

The simulated absorption spectra of DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T, and DTF-2P-2T obtained at the PCM/TD-BHandH/6-31G(d) level of theory are shown in Fig. 2, and the features for the main peaks of the spectra are presented in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, for the experimentally synthesized dye, the maximum absorption, λmax, is predicted to be shifted from 397 nm for DTF-2P to 434 nm for DTF-2P-T due to the introduction of a thiophene group. Evidently, experimental data revealed that the efficiency of DTF-2P-T-based cells has reached 8.29% with the maximum absorption located at 427 nm, while the efficiency of DTF-2P-based cells is mere 4.18% with the maximum absorption located in a relatively blue region at 406 nm. The calculated oscillator strength of absorption peaks increases from 1.6615 in DTF-2P to 2.1608 in DTF-2P-T which is also in coincidence with relative intensities of absorption peaks of experimental observation.13 Overall, our calculations reproduce the experimental absorption spectrum nicely. The red-shifted and broadened absorption spectrum matches better the solar spectrum which probably induces the improved performance of DTF-2P-T in comparison with DTF-2P. Additionally, in the case of DTF-2P-2T, augment in the length of the π-spacer moiety further shifts the absorption peak towards the red part of the spectrum (466 nm). The red-shifts in absorption spectra can be attributed to the increase in the conjugation length of the π-spacer. Readers may wonder whether DTF-2P-2T with a more prolonged π-spacer would be promising to challenge the current photoelectric conversion efficiency 8.29% of DTF-2P-T, as we shall discuss in the next section.

For all dyes, the charge transfer excitation from HOMO to LUMO plays a critical role in the first transition. We present the orbital distribution and the variation of the total electronic density (Δρ) between the ground state and the first excited state calculated by the PCM/TD-BHandH/6-31G(d) level of theory as shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, in all cases, the HOMO is a π orbital predominantly delocalized over the donor group with a sizable contribution from the π-spacer, while the LUMO is a π* orbital centered on the acceptor group, with an increasing delocalization as the bridging moiety is extended from DTF-2P to DTF-2P-2T. Thus, the efficient photo-excited electron transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO of the dyes, and then to the conduction band of TiO2, will occur though the close position of the LUMO to the anchoring group in the excited state is expected. It is apparent that increasing the length of π-conjugation leads to a more and more delocalized electron distributions of HOMO and LUMO in the π-spacer, which is also consistent with the stability of HOMO and LUMO, leading to a decreased HOMO–LUMO gap.

The red (blue) color indicates an increase (decrease) of the electron density in a given molecular region. 
A strong through-space charge transfer (CT) character is altitudinal desired for the sake of efficient CT from the electron-donating group to the electron-accepting group in the rod-like D–π–A molecules. Table 3 also shows that in all dyes the main contribution to the first absorption peak is assigned to a CT from HOMO to LUMO. In order to establish the nature and quantify the extent of CT character of the computed electronic transition, several indices, such as DCT, q, and H as well as t recently proposed by Le Bahers et al.,35 were used. The core of this method is completely general and requires only the ground state and excited state total electronic densities. Herein,
• DCT defines the spatial distance between the two barycentres of the density depletion (ρ−(r) = Δρ(r), if Δρ < 0) and density enhancement (ρ+(r) = Δρ(r), if Δρ > 0) distribution upon excitation, which can give a quantitative estimation of the charge transfer length.
• q is the transferred charge which can be obtained by integrating over all space ρ+(r) or ρ−(r). For one electron excitation, q can be assumed to be between 0 and 1.
• H is the half of the sum of the centroid axis along the electron transfer direction.
• t represents the difference between DCT and H: t = DCT − H, for H ≥ DCT, which can be used to characterize the extent of orbital overlap between the regions of density depletion and increment, and further to quantify the through-space character associated to a computed CT excitation.
For more details please refer to ref. 35–37. All of the above-mentioned parameters are listed in Table 3. First of all, it should be noted that the calculated t values are well below the diagnostic threshold of 1.6 Å previously defined in the literature,35 indicating that no dyes have a transition with through-space character. Interestingly, we found that the length of CT (DCT) does not correspond to the length of the π-spacer. In addition, the calculated t values are DTF-2P (1.142 Å), DTF-2P-T (0.188 Å), and DTF-2P-2T (−0.613 Å), respectively, indicating that the extent of orbital overlap is increased following the sequence: DTF-2P < DTF-2P-T < DTF-2P-2T. Among the three dyes, DTF-2P has a stronger q, longer DCT, and larger t compared with DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T. Both the DCT and q decrease with the extending of π-spacer. Thus we concluded that the CT extent was decreased from DTF-2P to DTF-2P-2T. This can be explained by the following: increasing the length of π-spacer results in more delocalization of the HOMO and LUMO distribution. As a consequence, the distance between the two barycenters of the density depletion and density enhancement become closer and more centered on the π-spacer. This phenomenon is well illustrated in the charge density difference between the ground state and excited state, as shown in Fig. 3. It is quite obvious that there is a left-to-right CT for all the three dyes but that the zones of positive/negative variations are closely entangled. For DTF-2P-2T, the majority of the density variations are located on the π-spacer, whereas the donor and acceptor groups play a small role. In contrast, for DTF-2P, both the donor and acceptor groups have a sizable contribution to the region of negative/positive charge density variations.
3.2 The dye/TiO2 interface
To gain insights into the interaction of dyes with the TiO2 surface, the effective simulation of the electronic properties of TiO2 nanoparticles is thus required. In this work, a (TiO2)38 cluster was used to model the TiO2 nanoparticles. The considered cluster represents a good balance between accuracy and computational convenience and nicely reproduces the main electronic characteristics of TiO2 nanoparticles. We carried out the TDDFT calculation for isolated (TiO2)38 clusters using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, and obtained a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.83 eV, with a lowest excitation energy of 3.54 eV. The calculated lowest excitation energy of the (TiO2)38 cluster is in agreement with the experimental band gaps of typical of TiO2 nanoparticles.38
As for the dye–TiO2 complexes, the dye is adsorbed on TiO2via its carboxylate group in a bidentate bridging manner, with one proton transferred to a nearby surface oxygen, which has been proved to be the most stable adsorption mode for this anchoring group.39 Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared experiments also indicated that the carboxylic acid group usually adsorbed on TiO2 through bidentate bridging mode.40 On the basis of these reports, we only consider the bidentate bridging mode for dye adsorption on the TiO2 nanoparticle in this study.
The representative geometry of DTF-2P/TiO2 after optimization and the bond distances as well as adsorption energies for dye–titania complexes at the interface are provided in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, all dyes show a rather strong adsorption onto the TiO2 surface, with binding distances of 2.01–2.18, 2.00–2.19, and 2.02–2.18 Å for DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T, respectively. Due to the proton transfer to surface oxygen, the Ti–O lengths of the dye–(TiO2)38 complex are different: the Ti atom, which is directly bound to the protonated surface oxygen, is more acidic than another Ti atom, thus giving rise to a stronger interaction (shorter bond) with the carboxylic oxygen.39 The adsorption energies (Eads) of dyes on the (TiO2)38 cluster can be defined as Eads = Edye+TiO2 − (Edye + ETiO2), where Edye, ETiO2, and Edye+TiO2 denote the total energy of isolated dye, (TiO2)38 cluster, and dye–(TiO2)38 complex, respectively. A negative value of Eads indicates stable adsorption. As shown in Fig. 4, the adsorption energy (Eads) of each dye–TiO2 complex was calculated to be −1.06, −1.01, and −1.02 eV for DTF-2P/TiO2, DTF-2P-T/TiO2, and DTF-2P-2T/TiO2, respectively, which are sufficiently large to allow the assumption that the dye molecules are chemisorbed on the surface of the semiconductor.

The efficient excited state electron transfer into the TiO2 CB depends on the electronic coupling between the LUMO of the dye and the CB of TiO2. The calculated MO levels of the sensitized TiO2 that have nonnegligible contributions from the free dye LUMO are collectively referred to as LUMO(ads) which usually involve a photoinduced electron transfer process. In the current contribution, a quantitative analysis of this different dye–semiconductor coupling for DTF-2P/TiO2, DTF-2P-T/TiO2, and DTF-2P-2T/TiO2 systems is shown in Fig. 5 and 6 as well as Fig. S2 (ESI†), where an energy level alignment diagram and a comparison between the density of state (DOS) profiles as well as the plots of the representative molecular orbitals are, respectively, reported.

 Fig. 6  Plots of density of states (DOS) for the DTF-2P (black lines), DTF-2P-T (red lines), and DTF-2P-2T (blue lines) dyes: (a) dyes contribution, (b) (TiO2)38 cluster contribution, and (c) total DOS. 
As expected from the general understanding of the level alignment in these systems, Fig. 5 shows that there are occupied dye levels above the TiO2 valence band, besides, there are no unoccupied dye levels below the TiO2 conduction band edge. We also obtained the expected behavior for dye-sensitized TiO2: the HOMO of dye–TiO2 corresponds to a free dye state, which are well separated from TiO2 states, while the LUMO corresponds to a state of the TiO2 cluster, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). After adsorption to the TiO2 cluster, the dye LUMO decreases due to the interaction with TiO2, in agreement with previous investigations.41–43
As can be noticed from Fig. 6a, there are nonnegligible contributions from the dye to the DOS at the bottom of the TiO2 conduction band in the range from −3.8 to −2.5 eV. In DSSC, the small contribution indicates strong electronic couplings of the molecular orbitals of the dye with the cluster conduction band, which plays an important role in accelerating charge transfer.44–46Fig. 6a also shows that all the three systems show a small degree of difference in the dye projected DOS plot which has been magnified in the range −3.8 to −2.5 eV, whereas no appreciable shift in the TiO2 and total DOS plot is observed (Fig. 6b and c). The details about the dye projected DOS are also listed in Table 4. Further analysis of the nature of dye projected DOS reveals that it is entirely due to significant mixing of a dye LUMO with TiO2 CB through strong electron orbital delocalization across the dye–TiO2 interface. This points to an adsorption-induced selective lowering of a dye LUMO, as confirmed by the MO picture (LUMO(ads)), shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The dye LUMO is calculated to be 0.38, 0.39, and 0.36 eV lower after binding to the TiO2 surface for DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T, and DTF-2P-2T, respectively, allowing us to conclude that the coupling interaction between the LUMO of the dye and TiO2 CB should be stronger for DTF-2P-T.

3.3 Theoretical parameters to evaluate Jsc and Voc of DTF-2P, DTF-2P-T, and DTF-2P-2T
As for Voc in DSSCs, it represents the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor (EF,n) and the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox):47 (2)EF,n is directly related to the conduction band edge position (Ecb): (3)where q is the unit charge, nC is the number of electrons in the conduction band, kT is the thermal energy, and NC is the accessible density of conduction band states. Among these parameters Voc, kT, and q are constants, Eredox and NC are always assumed as constants, too. It is apparent that Ecb exerts a crucial influence on Voc. Plenty of investigations have pointed out that the adsorption of polar molecules on the TiO2 surface could shift the TiO2 CB toward the vacuum level (i.e., away from the redox potential of the electrolyte), thus resulting in a higher photovoltage.48–50 In terms of the energy shift of Ecb (ΔEcb), Ruhle et al.50 reported that the larger dipole moment normal to the TiO2 surface could lead to the more shift of potential at the interface. A similar relationship has been reported by Grätzel et al.51 in solid DSSCs. However, this relationship would be more difficult to be observed in liquid DSSCs.52 As investigated by De Angelis et al.,48 it is reasonable to assume that the shift of TiO2 CB is only related to the adsorbed sensitizers for the similar DSSCs with only different dyes. Bearing these points in mind, in this work, we believe it is perhaps more appropriate to evaluate the Voc order of dyes with ΔEcb. In order to get the energetic position of the CB edge of the semiconductor, we evaluated the partial density of state (PDOS) profiles on TiO2 calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory in the gas phase. A linear fitting of the low energies profile in a range from 20 to 80% of the maximum height was performed and the intercept of this line with the energy axis was taken as the CB edge.
The short circuit current density, Jsc, is related to the interaction between TiO2 and the dye sensitizer, as well as the absorption coefficient of the dye, which can be expressed as follows (4)in this equation, LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency, Φinject is the electron injection efficiency, and ηcollect is the electron collection efficiency. For the DSSCs which are based on analogous dyes, we assume that the ηcollect is a constant. According to eqn (4), in order to obtain a high Jsc, LHE and Φinject should be as large as possible.
As for the determination of LHE, Sanchez-de-Armas et al.53,54 proposed that the light-harvesting efficiency is related to the position and the width of the main band of the absorption spectrum, namely, the light-harvesting would be more efficient for the dye with a red-shifted absorption peak and a wider absorption band in the electronic absorption spectrum. In this work, we followed this strategy on the whole, and the only alteration is that the LHE is quantified by integrating the main absorption band of the absorption spectrum, which is expected to exhibit a more qualitative and comprehensive LHE. In terms of Φinject, it is closely related to the thermodynamic driving force (D) of the electron injection from the photoinduced excited states of the sensitizer to the CB of the semiconductor. Generally speaking, if the thermodynamic driving force is larger (more positive), an improved electron injection efficiency can be seen. We can calculate the driving force (D) as follows, assuming that the electron injection occurs from the unrelaxed excited state: D = E* − Esccb(5)where E* is the oxidation potential of the dye in the excited state and Esccb is the reduction potential of the conduction band of TiO2 (estimated as the TiO2 conduction band edge). In order to calculate E*, we can use the follow expression: E* = E0 + ΔE(6)where E0 is the redox potential of the ground state and ΔE is the vertical excitation energy which could be obtained from TDDFT calculation. The redox potential is determined by the follow equation: (7)F denotes the Faraday constant with 23.06 kcal mol−1 V−1. n is the number of electrons involved in the redox couple [Dye]/[Dye]+, here, n = 1. The value of ΔGsol is Gibbs free energy change due to the oxidation of the dye in solution, we can calculate it according to the Born–Haber cycle (as shown in Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  The thermodynamic cycle used to calculate the redox potentials. 
All the calculated theoretical parameters are listed in Table 5. As we can see from Table 5, we found that DTF-2P-T would have the largest ΔEcb compared with DTF-2P and DTF-2P-2T. Therefore, DTF-2P-T should have the largest Voc as a result of the largest shift of the conduction band edge of TiO2 toward the vacuum energy level. These results clearly account for the experimentally observed different tendency of Voc for DTF-2P and DTF-2P-T (730 mV for DTF-2P and 830 mV for DTF-2P-T).13 For Jsc, the calculated LHE, redox potential, and D are also shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, from DTF-2P to DTF-2P-T, the E0 decreases so the absolute value of D and thus Φinject decrease. At the same time, the LHE increases with the length of the π-spacer. Thus, we need to find a balance between D and LHE to reach a large Jsc. As can be noticed from Table 4, although DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T have a smaller D, they exhibit a larger oscillator strength, leading to a larger LHE in turn. In addition, the energy difference between the excited state oxidization potential of DTF-2P-T or DTF-2P-2T and the conduction band edge of TiO2 is about 1.95 eV which is large enough for efficient electron injection. What's more, too large D may introduce energy redundancy, resulting in large thermalization losses.55 Based on the above discussion, we may conclude that DTF-2P-T is the most efficient dye because it performs nicely on the three key parameters (D, LHE, and ΔEcb).

3.4 Effect of chemical modification
First of all, we want to address the necessity of choosing DTF-2P-2T as the prototype dye. The exploration and design of more efficient dyes are of prime importance for the development of DSSCs. From what has been discussed above, we know that an inferior performance of DTF-2P-2T may be induced through incorporating an additional thiophene group based on DTF-2P-T in virtue of the slightly smaller TiO2 CB shift as well as electron injection driving force. Nevertheless, considering the more red-shifted absorption spectrum (466 nm) and relatively large oscillator strength (2.5934) which are necessary to obtain good overlap with the solar spectrum in order to produce a large photocurrent response, we assume that it is feasible to modify DTF-2P-2T with the purpose of yielding an efficiency superior to DTF-2P-T. In this regard, the molecular modification of DTF-2P-2T should be performed from two aspects: (1) not only the light-harvesting efficiency should be as large as possible, but also the electron injection driving force ought to be improved so as to enlarge Jsc; (2) raise the TiO2 conduction band edge to increase Voc. As known the rigidification of the π-spacer represents a feasible tactic towards the molecular engineering of D–π–A organic dyes.56 Here we first use C and S atoms to rigidify the dithiophene moiety, and then the dithiophene moiety is substituted by a thienothiophene moiety. The structures of the designed dyes (DTF-2P-2T-C, DTF-2P-2T-S, and DTF-2P-Bi) are shown in Fig. 1.
Let us discuss the difference in optical properties between DTF-2P-2T and the designed dyes. Electronic energy levels and optical absorption spectra for the designed dyes are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. We noted that the exploitation of different tactics for modification can exert different impacts on the calculated results. Notably, DTF-2P-2T-C, with the utilization of a fastening C atom to improve the rigidity of dithiophene, has the maximum absorption which is significantly red-shifted to 498 nm along with a considerable oscillator strength of 2.5955 which indicates that DTF-2P-2T-C is probably an excellent broad-spectrum organic dye. The red-shift of the absorption peak for DTF-2P-2T-C is mainly owing to the decreased HOMO–LUMO gap in comparison with DTF-2P-2T. Moreover, alteration of the bridging atom from C to S elevates the oscillator strength from 2.5955 to 2.7152 despite the slightly blue-shifted maximum absorption for DTF-2P-2T-S. To the best of our knowledge, the oscillator strength of DTF-2P-2T-S (2.7152) is one of the largest obtained for a single transition among all-organic dyes so far even though different levels of theory can cause different outcomes.12 The above instances fully indicated that the employing of a fastening or unfastening atom to enhance the rigidity of dithiophene linkers is an efficient way to tune molecular energy levels and absorption properties. In general, all the designed dyes have more red-shifted absorption peaks and higher oscillator strength with respect to DTF-2P-T, as illustrated in Table 5.
Finally, in order to qualitatively evaluate the photocurrent and photovoltage performance of DTF-2P-2T-C, DTF-2P-2T-S, and DTF-2P-Bi compared with DTF-2P-T, the next three criteria are used to set up a possible efficiency ranking: (1) the driving force of electron injection of the three dyes should be more positive than DTF-2P-T (1.95 eV); (2) the LHE of the dye has to be as large as possible with a red-shift of the absorption spectrum in order to maximize the photocurrent response; (3) the ΔEcb of the dye should be no less than that of DTF-2P-T (0.21 eV). All the absorption data and relevant theoretical parameters are reported in Table 5.
Before ranking these dyes, it should be noted that, according to the data listed in Table 5, all ground state redox potentials and excited state oxidation potentials of the designed dyes agree well with the requirement as an efficient photosensitizer: the ground state redox potential of these dyes were beneath the I−/I3− redox potential (−4.6 eV vs. vacuum),57 and thus the oxidized dyes could be regenerated by the reduced part (I−) in the electrolyte to guarantee an efficient charge separation; in the meanwhile, the excited state oxidized potential places above the conduction band edge, thus ensuring that there is enough driving force for a fast and efficient electron injection from the excited state dye to the TiO2 conduction band.
We known that it is impossible to isolate one dye shows the most desirable values of D, LHE, and ΔEcb, therefore, the balance of these processes might be essential to achieve high performance. As shown in Table 5, all the designed dyes have a LHE superior to DTF-2P, whereas DTF-2P-2T-S shows significant deterioration of the electron injection driving force. As far as DTF-2P-2T-C is concerned, although it has a smaller D with respect to DTF-2P-T (basically the values are not prominently discrepant), the higher LHE and improved ΔEcb suggest that DTF-2P-2T-C is a promising candidate to achieve higher sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency than DTF-2P-T.
We further analyze the frontier molecular orbital of the DTF-2P-2T-C–(TiO2)38 system, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The HOMO level of the interacting system corresponds to the HOMO of the free dyes, and it is entirely localized on the adsorbate DTF-2P-2T-C, while the LUMO is located at the (TiO2)38 surface. The LUMO(ads) shows strong mixing of adsorbate π* and TiO2 3d orbitals, which is an ideal case for electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 CB. More importantly, the LUMO of DTF-2P-2T-C is calculated to be 0.61 eV lower after binding to the TiO2 surface, which is almost 1.5 times larger than that of DTF-2P-T. This implies a stronger electronic coupling between the LUMO of DTF-2P-2T-C and the CB of TiO2. All of the above further demonstrate that enhancing the rigidity of the π-spacer is an efficient way to tune the electronic structures of isolated and adsorbed systems, and thus the performance of DSSCs. We want to underline the recent experimental work by the Wang et al.,6 who demonstrated that the use of a rigid π-spacer in which two thiophene groups are connected with a fastening C atom shows a prominent solar energy conversion efficiency up to 12.8%.
4. Conclusions
The molecular geometries, electronic structures, and absorption properties of a series of DTF-based organic dyes before and after binding to the TiO2 surface have been investigated by DFT and TDDFT methods. The main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows:
• Systematically extending the π-spacer of DTF-2P tends to enhance π-conjugation which can red-shift the absorption peak and broaden the absorption range, thus improving the light-harvesting efficiency of DTF-2P-T and DTF-2P-2T.
• Upon inspecting the electronic structure of the dye–TiO2 system, we found that the electronic coupling strength between the LUMO of the dye and the TiO2 CB was first increased for DTF-2P-T and then decreased for DTF-2P-2T compared to that of DTF-2P. This can be ascribed to the lowest relative LUMO(ads) energy of the DTF-2P-T/TiO2 complex with respect to the LUMO energy of DTF-2P-T.
• DTF-2P-T would be the most efficient dye from DTF-2P to DTF-2P-2T because it performs nicely on the three key parameters (D, LHE, and ΔEcb). Our results also perfectly explain the difference in the experimentally observed efficiency.
• Among the designed dyes, DTF-2P-2T-C would be promising to challenge the current photoelectric conversion efficiency 8.29% of DTF-2P-T due to the higher LHE and improved ΔEcb regardless of the slightly smaller D.
• Further investigation of the frontier molecular orbital of DTF-2P-2T-C/TiO2 indicates that the electronic coupling strength should be larger than DTF-2P-T. During light excitation, electrons can be transferred from the donor through the π-spacer to the anchoring group, thus facilitating strong coupling of the excited state wavefunction with the titanium 3d orbitals, and subsequently favoring electron injection to the TiO2 CB.
Overall, our investigated results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate π-spacer length and employing a fastening C atom to enhance the rigidity of the π-spacer in achieving more efficient dyes for DSSC application. This work is expected to open a way for material design of novel dyes with target properties to improve the performance of organic dyes for solar cells.
