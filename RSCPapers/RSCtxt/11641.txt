    , Accepted 3rd February 2015First published on 3rd February 2015AbstractA novel polydentate Schiff base ligand N1,N3-bis[(6-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methylene]benzene-1,3-diamine (L) and its two dinuclear sandwich-like complexes {[CdL(NO3)(H2O)]·NO3}2 (1) and {[CdL(CH3CN)(H2O)]·(ClO4)2·(CH3CN)2}2 (2) were synthesized. Both C–H⋯O, C–H⋯N and π–π non-covalent interactions had essential roles in constructing the resulting three-dimensional supramolecular networks. L emits a more intense blue-green fluorescence emission around 493 nm than in dilute solution, exhibiting stacking-induced emission properties. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibited the dual properties of exceptional solvatochromism and fluorescence quenching towards CH3OH molecules. As these compounds could overcome the absent absorption of ruthenium complex N719 in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum, offset the competitive visible light absorption of I3− and reduce the charge recombination of injected electrons, the Schiff base ligand L and complexes 1 and 2 were used as co-sensitizers in combination with N719 to investigate their effect on enhancing the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. A short circuit current density of 14.37 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.71 V and a fill factor of 0.61 corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.17% under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation were achieved when 1 was used as a co-sensitizer, which are much higher than the results obtained for dye-sensitized solar cells sensitized by N719 alone (5.06%).
Introduction
Optoelectronic devices, including organic/metal organic hybrid photoluminescent materials and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), are potential candidates for emerging technologies in lighting, displays, optical devices and green energy applications.1 There is much interest in developing complexes with tunable luminescence for application in light-emitting devices or multifunctional complexes combining luminescence with photovoltaic performance.2 The main difficulty in improving the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion lies in the spectral mismatch between the energy distribution of photons in the incident solar spectrum and the band gap of semiconductor materials.3 Co-sensitization is an effective approach to enhancing device performance through a combination of two or more dyes sensitized together on the same semiconductor film, extending the light-harvesting spectrum to increase the photocurrent of the device.4 Nitrogen heterocyclic metal complexes have been extensively studied as luminescent or photoelectric materials, such as sensitizers in DSSCs, and show excellent thermal, chemical and photochemical stability.5 Cd(II) Schiff base complexes are of interest because Cd(II) has a versatile mode of coordination (coordination number 4–8) and could change the light-absorbing/fluorescence properties of the Schiff base ligand.6 This system has a low cost compared with rhenium(I),7 platinum(II)8 and ruthenium(II).9
We have explored different light-management strategies in relation to tunable luminescent complexes and co-sensitizers for DSSCs with improved light trapping in the high-energy bands.10 Our aim is to develop devices that absorb solar energy in the wavelength range 300–400 nm and to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSC devices using N719. We report here the synthesis of the polydentate Schiff base ligand N1,N3-bis[(6-methoxypyridin-2-yl)methylene] benzene-1,3-diamine (L) and its complexes with a dinuclear sandwich-type structure {[CdL(NO3)(H2O)]·NO3}2 (1) and {[CdL(CH3CN)(H2O)]·(ClO4)2·(CH3CN)2}2 (2). Their solvatochromism and fluorescence response to the methanol molecule were studied. As a result of their strong absorption in the wavelength range 300–400 nm, Schiff base L and complexes 1 and 2 were selected as co-sensitizers and were applied in the DSSC system sensitized by N719. They could overcome the lack of absorption by N719 in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum and offset the competitive visible light absorption of I3−. All these co-sensitized devices showed an enhancement of the photovoltaic performance in terms of both Jsc and Voc.
Experimental section
Materials and general methods
All solvents and chemicals used in the synthesis and analyses were commercially available and were used as received without further purification. The IR spectra as KBr pellets were recorded on a Nicolet Impact 410 FTIR spectrometer in the range 4000–400 cm−1. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ACF spectrometer at 400 MHz in DMSO-d6 solvent. The chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to an internal standard of TMS. Electrospray ionization (ESI) MS spectra were recorded with a Finnigan MATLCQTM mass spectrometer (USA) with a dual ESI source. Elemental analyses for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen were carried out on a PerkinElmer 240C element analyzer. UV–visible spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer Lambda 20 spectrometer.
The photoluminescence measurements were obtained with an Edinburgh FLS920 spectrometer equipped with a peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. An Edinburgh Xe900 450 W xenon arc lamp was used as the exciting light source. The emission decays were analyzed by the sum of the exponential functions. The decay curve was well-fitted by a double exponential function I = I0 + A1exp (−t/τ1) + A2exp (−t/τ2), where I and I0 are the luminescent intensities at time t = t and t = 0, respectively; τ1 and τ2 were defined as the luminescent lifetimes. The average lifetime <τ> was calculated according to the following equation: (1)
The luminescence quantum yields of the complexes were measured in the solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (CH3CN), methanol (CH3OH), acetone (CH3COCH3), trichlormethane (CHCl3) and tetramethylene oxide (THF) at room temperature and are cited relative to a reference solution of quinine sulfate (Φ = 0.546 in 0.5 mol dm−3 H2SO4) as a standard; they were calculated according to the well-known equation11: (2)
In eqn (2), n, A and I denote the refractive index of the solvent, the area of the emission spectrum and the absorbance at the excitation wavelength, respectively, and φref represents the quantum yield of the standard quinine sulfate solution. The subscript ‘ref’ denotes the reference and the absence of a subscript implies an unknown sample. For the determination of the quantum yield, the excitation wavelength was chosen so that A < 0.05.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with an electrochemical workstation (CHI660d, Chenhua, Shanghai) using a three-electrode cell with a Pt working electrode, a Pt wire auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode in saturated KCl solution. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, Fluka, electrochemical grade) in acetonitrile as the solvent. Photocurrent–photovoltage (I–V) curves were recorded on a Keithley Model 2400 digital source meter using a mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm−2. The irradiance of AM 1.5 global sunlight from a filtered 500 W xenon lamp light source was set at 100 mW cm−2 and was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (no. NIMMS1123, calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, China). Based on the I–V curve, the fill factor (FF) was defined as:FF = (Jmax × Vmax)/(Jsc × Voc)where Jmax and Vmax were the photocurrent density and photovoltage for the maximum power output and Jsc and Voc were the short circuit photocurrent density and open circuit photovoltage, respectively. The overall energy conversion efficiency η was defined as:η = (FF × Jsc × Voc)/Pinwhere Pin was the power of the incident light.
Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded using a CHI660D electrochemical analyzer (Chenhua, China) and the measurements were taken over the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation, or in the dark by applying a forward bias of −0.75 V.

Synthesis of complex {[CdL(CH3CN)(H2O)]·(ClO4)2·(CH3CN)2}2 (2). 
A 5 mL volume of a dichloromethane solution of L (0.052 g, 0.15 mmol) was slowly added to a 20 mL acetonitrile solution of Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.063 g, 0.15 mmol) with stirring. The solution was refluxed for 4 h, cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was allowed to stand at room temperature in air.

X-ray diffraction analysis
Suitable crystals of the Schiff base ligand L and complexes 1 and 2 were coated with hydrocarbon oil and attached to the tip of a glass fiber, which was then transferred to a Siemens SMART 1000 CCD diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) and operated at 298 ± 2 K. Table S1† gives details of the crystal parameters, data collection and refinement for the structure. An empirical absorption correction was applied after data collection. The structure was solved by a conventional direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using the SHELXTL 5.1 software package.12 The hydrogen atoms were placed at the calculated positions and refined as riding atoms with isotropic displacement parameters. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. CCDC 1006546, 1006547 and 1006548 contain the crystallographic data for L and complexes 1 and 2.
Assembly of DSSCs
The FTO conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, sheet resistance 15 Ω per square, transmission 90% in the visible region) was purchased from NSG (Japan) and cleaned by a standard procedure. N719 [cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium] was purchased from Solaronix Co. (Switzerland). DSSCs were fabricated using the following procedure. The TiO2 paste was cast onto the FTO substrate by a screen-printing method, followed by drying at 100 °C for 5 min. This process was repeated six times, followed by sintering at 500 °C for 15 min in air to obtain a transparent TiO2 photoelectrode with a thickness of about 10 μm.
The co-sensitized electrodes were prepared by immersing the obtained mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode in 0.3 mM solutions of 1, 2 and L in absolute ethanol for 2 h, washing with ethanol and drying with a blower, then further immersing the electrodes in a 0.3 mM N719 solution in absolute ethanol for 12 h, followed by washing with ethanol and drying again with a blower. Electrodes sensitized with N719 alone were prepared by immersing the TiO2 photoelectrode in a 0.3 mM solution of N719 in absolute ethanol for 14 h. The electrolyte used in this work was 0.5 M LiI + 0.05 M I2 + 0.1 M tert-butyl pyridine in a 1:1 volume ratio of acetonitrile–propylene carbonate.
The platinum counter electrode was prepared by depositing H2PtCl6 paste onto the FTO glass substrates and then sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. The cells were assembled by sandwiching the electrolyte between the dye-sensitized photoanode and the counter electrode and the assembly was held together using minibinder clips.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The Schiff base ligand L was obtained by condensation of 1,3-diaminobenzene and 6-methoxy-2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde in a 1:2 molar ratio (Scheme 1). The identities of ligand L and complexes 1 and 2 were established by 1H-NMR, ESI-MS and FTIR spectrometry and satisfactory elemental analysis data. X-ray quality crystals of L and complexes 1 and 2 were obtained by evaporation of the filtrate. The FTIR spectra (Fig. S1†) revealed the presence of C–H (CH3) asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations in L (2985 and 2940 cm−1), 1 (3448 and 3362 cm−1) and 2 (3055 and 3003 cm−1). The shift in the vibrations in the complexes compared with L is the result of distortion of the spatial structure by coordination. The presence of CN moieties in L (1630 cm−1) and complexes 1 and 2 (1599 and 1573 cm−1) were revealed. The coordination of L to Cd(II) through the imine and pyridine nitrogen atoms was proved. Extensive studies showed that the absorption bands of 1 near 1479 (ν1), 1309 (ν4), 1089 (ν2) and 806 (ν3) cm−1 could be assigned to vibrations of the coordinated nitrate groups.13 The interval between the ν4 and ν1 peak positions was approximately 170 cm−1, which is typical of the η2-chelation of nitrate groups in 1.14 The weak bands at about 1025 and 617 cm−1 belong to the ClO4− ions, suggesting that there is no coordination with the metal ion is in 2.15 The 1H-NMR spectra of the ligand and complexes were recorded to probe the solution structure (Fig. S2–S4†). For L and the corresponding complexes 1 and 2, the appearance of peaks for the pyridine ring and benzene ring protons unambiguously testified that the ligands and complexes were magnetically equivalent (6H Py-H 7.00–7.89 δ, 4H Ph-H 7.40 δ for L; 6H Py-H 7.02–7.92 δ, 4H Ph-H 7.40 δ for 1; 6H Py-H 6.98–7.89 δ, 4H Ph-H 7.40 δ for 2). The obvious signal at about 3.96 ppm is assigned to the –OCH3 group protons. The two protons on the imine –CHN– moieties of ligand L appear at 8.59 δ. This signal also displays a downfield shift, which appears at 8.69 δ for 1 and 8.64 δ for 2 as a result of coordination by the imine–N and pyridine–N. This behavior causes a characteristic change in the chemical shift of the proton resonances compared with those in the free ligand, which is fully consistent with crystal structure. The 1H-NMR and ESI-MS data (Fig. S5–S7†) indicate that ligand L was still coordinated to the metal center and that the structures of compounds L, 1 and 2 in solution were identical to their crystal structure.

Description of crystal structures

Schiff base ligand L. 
The Schiff base L crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group in an asymmetric unit (Table S1†). Table S2† lists selected bond distances and angles. The methoxy moieties are located in the corresponding pyridine ring plane (Fig. 1a). The dihedral angles between the benzene and the two flexible planar pyridine rings are 35.02° and 53.28° to reduce the stereospecific blockade. The bond lengths of C7N2 (1.272 Å) and C14N3 (1.273 Å) are shorter than the typical length (a typical CN bond length is 1.279 Å) as a result of the conjugated effect.16 The two methoxy-pyridyl moieties could rotate freely around the C–C single bond of –C–CN to form a chelating coordination site. A pair of centrosymmetric related molecules, the methoxy pyridine rings and –CN–, are almost coplanar (Fig. 1b). The Schiff base L molecule contains an aromatic nucleus, a methoxyl group and –CN–, which has a significant advantage for the formation of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Fig. 1c shows that the methoxy O atom is involved in forming hydrogen bonds as an acceptor to give C13–H13A⋯O1, which connects two adjacent L molecules, yielding helical chains along the b axis. Facilitated by the hydrogen bond interactions of C18–H18A⋯N3, these supramolecular chains linked with each other into a two-dimensional (2D) structure including a quadrilateral grid in the ab plane. In the crystal, molecules are further packed into a three-dimensional (3D) network via strong π–π linker stacking (centroid–centroid distances 3.442 Å) (Fig. 1d).

Complex 1. 
Complex 1 is a dinuclear structure belonging to the triclinic space group P. Fig. 2a shows the molecular structure and selected bond distances and angles are listed in Table S3.† The geometry of this dinuclear configuration can best be described by a sandwich-like construction with a thickness of 2.87 Å between the two parallel benzene ring planes of the outer Schiff base ligand L; the Cd⋯Cd distance is 7.753 Å. For the cationic [Cd2(L)2(NO3)2(H2O)2]2+ lying about an inversion center, two equivalent Cd(NO3)(H2O) moieties are bridged by two tetradentate symmetrical Schiff base L moieties with two pyridyl and imino nitrogen atoms (N1, N2, N3, N4), resulting in the formation of an L-bridged CdII2 system with a [Cd2(L)2(NO3)2(H2O)2]2+ dinuclear moiety. The dipositive cationic charge is balanced by two uncoordinated nitrates. In each of two equivalent [Cd(L)2(NO3)(H2O)]+ moieties, the unique inner Cd2+ ion is seven-coordinated and bound by the N4 core of the two L Schiff base ligands in addition to two oxygen atoms (O4 and O6) from the terminal nitrate ion. It saturates its pentagonal bipyramid geometry with one oxygen atom (O3) from the coordinated water molecule (Fig. S8a†). In this structure, the dihedral angle of the pyridine ring to the benzene plane is 42.54° and 48.84°, respectively, which is a little different from the free Schiff base L (53.28° and 30.02°). The Cd–N (imine) bond length (2.370–2.454 Å) is significantly longer than the Cd–N (pyridyl) bond length (2.322–2.402 Å), which is consistent with the previously reported structural data. The distances for Cd–O (2.276–2.685 Å) are comparable with those previously reported results.17 The cationic [Cd2(L)2(NO3)2(H2O)2]2+ part should be charge-balanced by two free nitrate ions and serves as the acceptor in the hydrogen bond. It further recognizes H atoms from the adjacent coordinated water molecule via two strong intermolecular O3–H3C⋯O7 (H3C⋯O7 1.899 Å, ∠OHO 145.6°) and O3–H3D⋯O8 (H3D⋯O8 2.072 Å, ∠OHO 149.4°) hydrogen bond interactions. The formation of dimeric associations denoted as R42(12) motifs is promoted. Further stabilized by C1–H1A⋯O7 (H1A⋯O7 2.678 Å, ∠CHO 154.4°) and C13–H13B⋯O9 (H13B⋯O9 2.582 Å, ∠CHO 129.2°), this results in the formation of a 1D ribboned chain (Fig. 2b). Coupled with this, the spreading of 1 building units is oriented in bc plane through self-complementary C7–H7A⋯O8 (H7A⋯O8 2.653 Å, ∠CHO 174.8°) and C18–H18A⋯O4 (H18A⋯O4 2.501 Å, ∠CHO 142.6°) interactions giving rise to a 2D layered structure (Fig. 2c). C10–H10A⋯O5 (H10A⋯O5 2.695 Å, ∠CHO 127.5°) and C11–H11A⋯O6 (H11A⋯O6 2.511 Å, ∠CHO 148.9°) with the consequential involvement of π–π stacking interactions (3.428 Å) between the pyridine rings take the modular units of 1 into a 3D ∞-like supramolecular architecture. The chelating coordinated nitrate ions are immobilized exterior to the 3D framework surfaces (Fig. 2d).

Complex 2. 
The structure shows that 2 is also a Schiff base L-bridged CdII2 system that can be described by a sandwich-like construction with an upper and lower distribution of the chelating L. The main differences between the structures of 1 and 2 arise from the Cd(II) coordination polyhedron and counter anion. Fig. 3a shows the perspective view of the asymmetric unit of 2 and the required bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S4.† The dinuclear centrosymmetric unit of 2 is composed of one cation [Cd2(L)2(CH3CN)2(H2O)2]4+, four free ClO4− counter anions and free CH3CN molecules. Each Cd(II) ion locates in the N4 pocket (N1, N2, N3, N4) of two Schiff base L ligands. The coordination sphere of the Cd(II) ion is completed with CH3CN and a water molecule by a terminal coordination mode, making a six-coordinate slightly distorted octahedron geometry (Fig. S8b†). The Cd–N/O distances are in the range 2.279(2)–2.401(2) Å and 2.354(2) Å, which are somewhat shorter than those in 1. The adjacent pyridyl group and benzene plane are twisted by dihedral angles of 50.54° and 40.32°, respectively. The torsional amplitude of the aromatic ring plane is greater than that of 1 and leads to the weakened coplanarity, with a closer Cd⋯Cd separation of 7.732 Å (7.753 Å in 1). For the sandwich-like construction geometry of this dinuclear configuration, the thickness between the two parallel benzene ring planes of the outer Schiff base ligand L is 2.89 Å. The widespread presence of O/C–H⋯O/N from uncoordinated ClO4− anions extends the array into a 3D pattern, which is completely different from 1. Dinuclear units of 2 are spread out by O3–H3B⋯O8 (H3B⋯O8 2.688 Å, ∠OHO 125.47°), C7–H7B⋯O10 (H7B⋯O10 2.548 Å, ∠CHO 149.57°), C7–H7B⋯O8 (H7B⋯O8 2.688 Å, ∠CHO 152.85°), O18–H18B⋯O9 (H18B⋯O9 2.558 Å, ∠CHO 168.56°), and C17–H17A⋯N7 (H17A⋯N7 2.727 Å, ∠CHO 163.01°) along the c axis, self-assembling into a linear dimeric chain (Fig. 3b). This type of linkage is accompanied by strong π stacking interactions between adjacent pyridine rings (π–π 3.422 Å). This dimeric association is propagated through C14–H14A⋯O5 (H14A⋯O5 2.718 Å, ∠CHO 147.92°), C16–H16A⋯O5 (H16A⋯O5 2.678 Å, ∠CHO 149.21°) and C21–H21B⋯O5 (H21B⋯O5 2.734 Å, ∠CHO 171.02°) into a 2D layer with a tetrahedral lattice (3.327 × 2.89 Å) (Fig. 3c). With the consequential involvement of C3–H3C⋯O4 (H3C⋯O4 2.527 Å, ∠CHO 152.61°) and C23–H23C⋯N7 (H23C⋯N7 2.657 Å, ∠CHN 157.44°), it forms the 3D skeleton of 2, which may be considered as a combination of the 2D fragments (Fig. 3d, Table S5†).

Photophysical properties
The absorption and emission spectral data along with the lifetimes and emission quantum yields for the Schiff base ligand L and complexes 1 and 2, both in solution and in the solid state, are summarized in Tables S6–S8.† Minor changes in the absorption spectra were observed in different solvents (Fig. S9†). L and complexes 1 and 2 displayed an intense absorption band with absorption maxima at about 349, 375 and 365 nm, respectively, which can be attributed to the π→π* electronic transition of the aromatic moieties in these compounds.18
Aggregation-induced emission of Schiff base L
Schiff base L emits extremely weak fluorescence in dilute CH3CN solution, although its crystal displays bright blue-green emission around 493 nm. To examine whether L undergoes induced aggregation, the emission spectra of L in different concentrations of CH3CN were recorded (Fig. 4b). It can be clearly seen that the CH3CN solution with a low concentration (c = 10−6 M) was almost non-emissive and the fluorescence spectrum was nearly parallel to the abscissa. However, the fluorescence intensities abruptly increased when the concentration was >10−3 M. As the concentration reached 10−2 M, the emission intensity was approximately 20-fold higher than the molecularly dispersed species in CH3CN for L. The emission maxima were red-shifted (from 450 to 480 nm) and the emission colors changed from blue to greenish blue. These results indicate that L is indeed a weak emitter in dilute solution, which is close to the properties described by the aggregation-induced emission concept.19 In general, aggregation-induced behavior is attributed to the impedence of intramolecular rotations and planarization.20 Given the nature of L, it is possible that both π–π stacking between the pyridine ring and C–H⋯O/N hydrogen bonding contribute to the planarization in crystal aggregation. Some notable structural features in the crystal of L can be summarized as follows. (1) The pyridine rings of two adjacent molecules, along with the methoxy group and –CN–, are nearly coplanar (Fig. 4a). Such a configuration greatly restricts intramolecular rotations and extends the π-conjugation and therefore might influence the intensity of fluorescence. (2) The intrinsic intermolecular C–H⋯O/N hydrogen bonds lead to the generation of a 2D layer with a more extended plane. This structural feature was further steadied by restricting the vibration and rotation of the aromatic ring by strong π–π stacking interactions. The formation of the aggregated state subsequently impeded intramolecular pyridine rotations, giving the aggregates intense emission properties. Aggregation caused the molecules to be located in an apolar environment and partially prevented the intramolecular charge transfer process,21 which is helpful for the emission of light.

The inset shows how the coordinates vary: the coordinates are based on the blue region and the arrow shows the direction of change as the concentration increases. 
Solcatochromism
The Cd(II) chelation process probably induces more conjugated and rigid geometries by the formation of two five-membered chelate rings with the coordination of Cd(II) (Fig. 2a and 3a). Therefore aggregation-induced emission does not occur and there is an increase in the intensity in dilute CH3CN solution compared with that in the solid state. The emission spectrum of 1 (Fig. 5a) was largely unchanged in aprotic solvents (THF, CHCl3, CH3COCH3, CH3CN and DMSO) (λmax = 419–429 nm) and all the studied moieties generated a bright blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of 0.16, 0.12–0.14 (Table S7†). As the emission of 1 does not shift greatly in aprotic solvents, there may be no significant stabilization and influence from the solvent or little charge separation within 1. The supramolecular formation of the rectangular grid R42(12) adopted by NO3− is a more important effect.
 Fig. 5  (a) Emission spectra of 1 in different solvents (excited at 350 nm). (b) Fluorescence spectra of 1 introduced into mixed CH3CN–CH3OH systems of different proportions with excitation at 350 nm (inset, graph of CIE coordinates for 1 as a function of CH3OH content). 
Cd(II) is much more tightly wrapped with a seven coordination mode [CdN4O3] with a distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination geometry and the solvent molecule could not easily lead to realignment and influence the energy of emission from the solute. A significant bathochromic shift (107 nm) was seen in the CH3OH solvent of complex 1 (λmax = 526 nm). The emission component was in the green region, giving light with CIE coordinates of 0.38, 0.60. The selective response of 1 to CH3OH should arise from the presence of H-bonding between the coordinated nitrate ions serving as multiple hydrogen bond acceptors with CH3OH, which is a hydrogen bond donor. The hydrogen bond donor nature of CH3OH could stabilize the excited state of the electronic transitions through solute–solvent interactions with the chelating coordinated nitrate ions, which are exterior to the 3D supermolecular structure surfaces of 1 (Fig. 2d). Under UV irradiation, the emission of the mixed CH3CN–CH3OH solution system could be finely tuned from blue to green to yellow as the volume fraction of CH3OH in the solvent mixture increased (Fig. 5b). At the same time, a pronounced reduction in the fluorescence intensity was observed. The fluorescence quenching rate reached 88% in pure CH3OH, as estimated using the formula (I0 − I)/I0 × 100%.22 Part of this is a result of the known increase in the non-radiative transition rate with the formation of H-bond interactions. The H-bonds contribute to solvent-induced aggregation quenching and the mobile emission spectra, which alters the molecular energy levels and non-radiative transition rate.23
By comparison, 2 showed bright emitter and positive solvatochromic behavior in aprotic solutions. Complex 2 exhibits a blue emission at 454 nm in THF, 474 nm in CHCl3, 484 nm in CH3COCH3, a blue-green emission centered at 490 nm in CH3CN and a further red-shift to green emission at 501 nm in DMSO (polarity THF < CHCl3 < CH3COCH3 < CH3CN < DMSO) (Fig. 6a). The solvent-dependent emission of 2 in aprotic solvents demonstrates the presence of a highly polarized excited state of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, whereas the polarization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is weaker. Compared with 1, the central metal Cd(II) ion in 2 has only a six coordinated geometrical configuration [CdN5O] with a linear monodentate ligand CH3CN molecule, which is easily influenced by the solvent molecule. The emission spectrum of 2 becomes broader and weaker in the CH3OH protic solvent (459–552 nm), with CIE coordinates of 0.30, 0.35, generally close to white emission (0.33, 0.33). Fig. 6b shows that the addition of CH3OH to a CH3CN solution of 2 led to a significant decrease in its fluorescence intensity, accompanied by a broad spectrum. The fluorescence quenching rate almost reached 87% in pure CH3OH solvent. It is assumed that the binding interactions of the OH groups played an important role in such quenching effects of the CH3OH molecule.24 The lifetimes and quantum yield of 1 and 2 (τ = 17.24 μs, φ = 0.085 for 1; τ = 17.25 μs, φ = 0.093 for 2) decreased conspicuously in CH3OH compared with those in the aprotic solvents (Table S8, Fig. S10 and S11†). This effect further validates the H-bond interactions that enhanced the rate contants for the two non-radiative processes (internal conversion and intersystem crossing).25

The solid state luminescence of 1, 2 and the Schiff base ligand L was investigated at 298 and 77 K (Fig. 7). Compared with L (λmax = 493 nm), complexes 1 and 2 exhibited a stronger fluorescence with emission maxima at 555 and 558 nm, respectively, which may be assigned to the intraligand π*→π transitions.26 The enhancement and red-shift in complexes 1 and 2 is a result of the unique coordination of L to the Cd(II) center, which increases the conjugated system and reduces the non-radiative decay of the excited state. Complex 1 produces the same yellow emission as 2 (CIE coordinates 0.43, 0.51 for 1 and 0.41, 0.50 for 2). The differences observed in the fluorescence emission peaks of 1 and 2 probably have their origins in the coordination environment, the steric proximity of the ligands and the supramolecular network structure. The solid state average lifetime at 298 K is in the range of microseconds (τ = 13.68, 6.75, 7.67 μs for L, 1 and 2, respectively) (Table S6†). When frozen at 77 K, the emissions of 1, 2 and the Schiff base ligand L shift to shorter wavelengths with broader peaks (at about 485, 528 and 520 nm for L, 1 and 2, respectively) and the lifetime (τ = 20.86, 20.75 and 20.65 μs for L, 1 and 2, respectively) is much longer than that at 298 K (Fig. 8). This is a result of the cold conditions favoring the rigidity of the ligands with a reduction in the non-radiative decay and collisional quenching.27L gives a bluish green light with CIE coordinates of 0.23, 0.34. 1 and 2 generate yellow light with CIE coordinates of 0.41, 0.53 and 0.38, 0.56 at 77 K.

Application in DSSCs

Electrochemical properties of complexes 1 and 2 and Schiff base ligand L. 
Energy-level matching is crucial in selecting the sensitizer in DSSCs. The redox properties of 1, 2 and L were investigated by CV measurements in a three-electrode cell using an electrochemical workstation to evaluate whether there were any favorable energy offsets with respect to the TiO2 film and electrolyte. Table 1 summarizes the experimental data for electrochemical properties of the compounds. As estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra, the excitation transition energy values (E0–0) of 1, 2 and L were 2.93, 2.92 and 2.64 eV, respectively. Consequently, the HOMO values of 1, 2 and L were calculated based on their first redox potentials as −5.11, −5.21 and −5.09 eV, respectively, and the LUMO levels of 1, 2 and L were calculated from EHOMO + E0–0 as −2.18, −2.29 and −2.45 eV, respectively.28Scheme 2 shows the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 1, 2 and L. The energy levels of 1, 2 and L are appropriate for the DSSC system containing TiO2. The LUMO levels were above the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.40 eV vs. vacuum), indicating efficient electron injection. The HOMO energy levels were below that of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum); this was further improved by about 0.3 V negatively by the addition of additives such as 4-tert-butyl pyridine to the I−/I3− redox electrolyte,29 providing a sufficient driving force for dye regeneration.30 There is sufficient thermodynamic force for electron injection and regeneration of the photo-oxidized dyes.

Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. 

Fig. 9 shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSC devices based on the N719, L/N719, 1/N719 and 2/N719 photoanodes and Table 2 summarizes the corresponding cell performances. The values of Jsc, Voc and η were improved in the order: 1/N719 > 2/N719 > L/N719. The 1/N719 device yielded values of Jsc = 14.37 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.71 V, FF = 0.61 and η = 6.17%. All the parameters were higher than those of the device sensitized by only N719 (Jsc = 12.11 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.68 V, FF = 0.61 and η = 5.06%). Therefore when complex 1, 2 and the Schiff base ligand L were used as a co-sensitizers, the Jsc and Voc values were both enhanced, which led to an improvement in η.

Compared with the absorption spectra of N719, complexes 1 and 2 and ligand L could compensate for that of N719 in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum (Fig. 10). The molar extinction coefficients in the visible region are 39103 M−1 cm−1 for L, 39457 M−1 cm−1 for 1 and 38371 M−1 cm−1 for 2. The higher molar extinction coefficient around 300–400 nm indicates that the 1, 2 and L have a higher light-harvesting ability in this wavelength region compared with N719 and I3− (25000 M−1 cm−1).31 It can be predicted that the photon lost as a result of light absorption by I3− will be suppressed by the use of 1, 2 or L as a co-sensitizer. All of 1, 2 and L show strong luminescence in the wavelength region 430–490 nm in CH3CN solution and overlap with the excitation spectra of N719. This indicates that N719 could synchronously accept the energy from incident light and the excited 1, 2 and L, which will broaden the spectral response of N719 in the region 300–700 nm. These all contributed to the improvement in Jsc. The dark current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs based on the 1/N719, 2/N719, L/N719 and N719 dyes are shown in Fig. 9b, which indicates the recombination of the injected electrons with I3−. The dark current is lower for the co-sensitized system than for the DSSCs sensitized with N719 alone. A lower dark current means more efficient suppression of the recombination of injected electrons with I3− and this efficient suppression causes the increase in Voc.

Electrochemical impedance spectrometry studies of DSSCs
To investigate the kinetics of the electron transport and recombination processes in the solar cells with the complexes 1 and 2, Schiff base L and N719 co-sensitized photoanodes, electrochemical impedance spectra were utilized to analyze the charge transfer dynamics in the interfacial regions of the solid–liquid layers. Fig. 11 shows the Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation and in the dark by applying a forward bias of −0.75 V. Under illumination conditions (Fig. 11a), the three semicircles located in the high, middle and low frequency regions are attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt/electrolyte interface, charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and charge transfer in the electrolyte (Nernst diffusion).32 The radius of the large semicircle located in the middle frequency regions in the Nyquist plots decreases after co-sensitization and the values are in the order 1/N719 < 2/N719 < L/N719 < N719, which indicates a decrease in the electron transfer impedance (Rct) and an increase in the charge transfer rate at this interface after co-sensitization, which both improve the performance of DSSCs.
 Fig. 11  Nyquist plots for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured (a) under standard AM 1.5 G solar irradiation or (b) in the dark at a forward bias of −0.75 V. 
Under dark conditions (Fig. 11b), the three semicircles located in the high, middle and low frequency regions of the Nyquist plots are attributed to the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode, electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and charge transfer in the electrolyte.33 Therefore the larger semicircle observed in the middle frequency region represents the resistance of charge transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte (back recombination resistance, Rrec). The radius of this semicircle increases after co-sensitization with complexes 1 and 2 and Schiff base L, indicating an increase in Rrec. The increased value of Rrec for co-sensitized DSSCs implies a retardation of charge recombination between the injected electrons and the I3− ions in the electrolyte. This is consistent with the larger Voc value of the co-sensitized DSSCs than that of cells sensitized by N719 alone. According to the EIS analysis, the charge recombination resistance is larger and the charge transport resistance is smaller for the DSSCs based on co-sensitization than for the DSSCs based on N719 alone, indicating that co-sensitization has effectively modified the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and increased the Jsc and the Voc values. In the co-sensitized system, better dye coverage helps to passivate the TiO2 surface or forms an insulating molecular layer composed of complexes 1 and 2 and ligand L with the N719 molecule, thus reducing the recombination resulting from electron back-transfer between TiO2 and I3−; this ultimately increases Voc compared with that of devices sensitized with only one sensitizer.
Conclusion
We have successfully developed a novel polydentate symmetrical Schiff base L with stacking-induced emission behavior. The emission wavelengths of its two dinuclear complexes with a sandwich-type configuration (complexes 1 and 2) are clearly red-shifted in the solid state at 298 and 77 K and the fluorescence intensity is significantly enhanced on chelation with Cd. Complexes 1 and 2 showed remarkable dual properties of tunable luminescence and exceptional fluorescence quenching behavior for the CH3OH molecule. The combination of the intermolecular associations and solute–solvent interactions gave both complexes a prominent solvatochromic effect. As a co-sensitizer, not only is the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency enhanced, but the dark current is also reduced for Schiff base L and complexes 1 and 2. A short circuit current density of 14.37 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.71 V and a FF of 0.61, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 6.17% under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation, were achieved when complex 1 was used as a co-sensitizer. This conversion efficiency is higher than that for DSSCs sensitized by N719 (5.06%), 2/N719 (6.09%) and L/N719 (5.91%) under the same conditions. The improvement in efficiency is attributed to the fact that these compounds overcome the deficiency of N719 absorption in the low wavelength region of the visible spectrum, prevent its aggregation, offset the competitive visible light absorption of I3− and reduce charge recombination as a result of the formation of an effective cover layer of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface. As a result, the synthesized complexes 1 and 2 and Schiff base L are promising candidates for potential luminescent materials and co-sensitizers for DSSCs.
