CdSe QDs were synthesized using ClpP, a bacterial protease, as protein shells to control the size and stability of QD and to facilitate the mounting of QDs on SiNWs. The photocurrent of SiNW-FETs in response to light at a wavelength of 480 nm was enhanced by a factor of 6.5 after integrating CdSe QDs because of the coupling of the optical properties of SiNWs and QDs. As a result, the photoresponsivity to 480 nm light reached up to 3.1 × 106, the highest value compared to other SiNW-based devices in the visible light range.
Semiconducting nanowire (SNW) field-effect transistors (FETs)1–3 are considered among the most promising sensing devices to recognize a wide range of chemical and physical properties,4,5 since the electron transport properties of SNWs can be greatly affected by the binding of charged analytes or by exposure to light. In addition, SNWs have received attention as a candidate material for optoelectric devices such as solar cells due to their high-energy conversion efficiency.6 For practical application of SNW-FETs as sensors or electric devices, it is necessary to increase their input sensitivity and output responsivity. In this study, we propose a new strategy to enhance the photoresponsivity of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) by integrating SiNW-FETs with protein-shelled CdSe quantum dots, where the photoreactivity of the QDs is coupled with that of the SiNWs to provide a new platform for the development of photodetectors with enhanced photoresponsivity and further applications to other optoelectric devices.
Generally, SiNWs have not been explored as an optically active material because of their indirect band gap. However, advances in state-of-the-art silicon CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology enabled a decrease in the size of SiNWs to the nanometer level close to the physical limit of beneficial scaling, which changes the optoelectric properties of SiNWs. For these reasons, SiNWs have received much attention as a building block for sensors7 and photodetectors.8,9 For the practical application of SiNWs to these devices, it is necessary to understand the electrical and optical properties of SiNWs and to control their properties. More recently, the light scattering and optical absorption of SiNWs have been found to vary with the diameter of the SiNWs.10,11 These findings indicate that SiNWs are ideal candidates for sensitive tuning of photonic devices by varying certain parameters of the SiNWs such as the diameter.
Quantum dots (QDs) also have superior properties as photodetectors because of their three-dimensional quantum confinement effect and tunable size, shape, and material composition.12 The optical properties of QDs vary depending upon their size. For example, the optical properties of CdSe QDs can be tuned within the visible spectrum from 450 to 650 nm by controlling their size.13 This versatility opens up numerous potential applications of CdSe QDs in optoelectronic devices and sensors.12,13 Thus, a combination of SiNWs with QDs is expected to lead to high performance photodevices that respond to specific wavelengths and integrate on-chip with various materials including biomolecules.
The combination of biological bottom-up assembly and semiconductor top-down fabrication has been the theme of numerous studies on the design of advanced nanodevices and sensors.14 Since biomolecules have unique functionalities, they can be combined with semiconducting nanomaterials to fabricate electronic and optoelectronic devices.15–20 In addition, they can be combined with various nanomaterials to synthesize functional nanomaterials for the purpose of cell imaging, protein harvesting and drug delivery.21–23 Protein shells (PSs), self-assembled multi-subunit protein complexes in hollow spheres, have been used as bio-templates for the synthesis and stabilization of metallic and semiconductor nanoparticles. By using PSs, it is possible to synthesize nanoparticles with a confined size under ambient conditions, as demonstrated by the synthesis of platinum nanoparticles using a bacterial protease PepA.24–27 The combination of PSs and nanoparticles (NPs) can create novel bioinorganic nanomaterials with various functionalities and high biocompatibility, and thus they can be applied not only for building nanodevices but also for biomedical purposes. Thus, the applications of NPs can be expanded by combining them with PSs in various compositions.17,27,28 In this study, we took advantage of the size-controlled synthesis of CdSe QDs by PSs and the compatibility between protein and silicon when integrating CdSe QDs with SiNWs.
ClpP, the protein shell employed in this study, is a proteolytic subunit of ATP-dependent Clp protease from Helicobacter pylori. It consists of 14 subunits that form a cylindrical structure with a single, wide channel along the 7-fold axis.29 The overall dimensions of the internal cavities and the pocket volume of ClpP are 5.8 nm × 9.5 nm and 92500 Å3, respectively. CdSe QDs with diameters of 3.6 nm ± 0.7 nm were synthesized by in situ precipitation of Cd2+ and Se2+ precursors inside purified recombinant ClpP without a capping agent, as reported previously.30 The size and shape of the ClpP–CdSe QDs were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with uranyl acetate staining (Fig. 1a). The negative staining with uranyl acetate revealed the spherical shapes of NPs, which could be easily distinguished from the images of ClpP. As a result, we could confirm that the round CdSe QDs filled the empty space of the hollow tetradecameric ClpP complexes (Fig. 1a). CdSe QDs confined in ClpP were further characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy. ClpP–CdSe QDs showed a maximum fluorescence peak in the visible wavelength range at 480–495 nm when excited at 365 nm (Fig. 1b). Since the reported UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra of CdSe QDs are very similar to those of the protein shelled QDs,30 it is clear that ClpP did not affect the optical properties of CdSe QDs.

The inset (top right) displays a magnified TEM image with a scale bar of 5 nm. (b) The fluorescence emission spectra of ClpP–CdSe in a wavelength range from 460 to 650 nm. The excitation wavelength was 365 nm. The inset in the left bottom shows the colors of ClpP–CdSe after illumination by white light and 365 nm light. The inset in the right top is the ribbon diagram of the crystal structure of ClpP (PDB ID: 2ZL0) with a CdSe model inside. Fourteen subunits are drawn in different colors. The internal and external diameters of ClpP are 5.8 nm and 9.5 nm, respectively. The CdSe QDs are represented as blue balls with a diameter of 3.6 nm. 
The SiNWs were fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates by employing the thinning concept introduced in a previous study.31 The width of the fabricated nanowires was controlled to be approximately 150 nm by optimizing the wet oxidation time. Two hundred and fifty nanowires with a length of 20 μm were equally spaced at intervals of 3.2 μm (Fig. 2a). Then, the SiNW array was used to fabricate a FET device (SiNW-FET) by employing the Si substrate as a back gate and using Ti/Au metal as the source and drain contact to the SiNWs (Fig. 2b). The photocurrent between the drain and the source (IDS) of the device at a gate voltage of VG = +3.0 V was measured using a Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer (SPA 4200, Keithley, USA) in response to illuminating light from a monochromator (Newport, USA) over a wavelength range from 300 to 1000 nm with an optical power of 10 nW cm−2 (Fig. 2c). The SiNW-FET device showed a photocurrent response against light over a wide range of wavelengths, but the maximum current was observed at 480 nm (Fig. 2c). When the photocurrent response was monitored by illuminating light at 254 nm, 365 nm and 480 nm by increasing the gate bias voltage (VG), the photocurrent increased exponentially in proportion to the gate voltage, while no detectable current change was found under the dark conditions (Fig. 2d). However, IDS at VG = +3.0 V for 480 nm illumination was much higher (1500 nA) than that for 254 nm illumination (800 nA). This observation was also confirmed by monitoring the current change under a controlled VG from −3.0 to +3.0 V at Vd = 0.0–1.0 V in response to the dark (Light OFF) and 480 nm light (Light ON) (Fig. 2e and f). The response of SiNW-FET increased significantly from a few tens of nA (IDS = 16.0 nA) to thousands of nA (IDS = 1550 nA) by illumination. These results demonstrated that the electric properties of SiNW-FETs were greatly enhanced by light exposure, and the photocurrent value could be increased by a factor of 97 upon illumination with light at 480 nm.

(c) A representative IDS response of a SiNW-FET device measured at a gate voltage (VG) of 3.0 V with an illumination range from 300 to 1000 nm. (d) Photocurrent response of the SiNW-FET to the dark (no light) and 254 nm, 365 nm and 480 nm illumination. (e) IDS–VD of the SiNW-FET under the dark conditions (Light OFF) at VG values from +3.0 V to −3.0 V. The observed IDS was 15 nA at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V. (f) IDS–VD of a SiNW FET in response to blue light (480 nm, Light ON) at VG values from +3.0 V to −3.0 V. The observed IDS was 1500 nA at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V. 
We further investigated the photoelectric properties of the SiNW-FET by loading ClpP–CdSe QDs with and without illumination at 480 nm (henceforth referenced in the text as SPQ-FET, for silicon-nanowire protein-shell quantum-dot field-effect transistor). To fabricate the SPQ-FET, 1 μL of aqueous solution containing ClpP–CdSe QDs was placed on the SiNWs. After complete drying of the ClpP–CdSe QD solution in the desiccator, the SPQ-FET was used for characterization and further evaluation. The drain-source currents (IDS) of the SPQ-FETs were measured by sweeping the drain source voltage (VDS) from 0 to 1 V at a gate voltage (VG) in the range from −3.0 V to +3.0 V upon illumination at 480 nm (Fig. 3a), which was compared to the dark conditions (data not shown). Upon illumination at 480 nm, IDS of the SPQ-FET increased up to 10.09 μA from 26.40 nA at VG = +3.0 V. As a result, the light-induced current enhancement in the SPQ-FET reached up to a factor of 382 while that in the SiNW-FET was only a factor of 97 (Table 1). However, when ClpP alone was loaded on the SiNW-FET under the same conditions, the photocurrent was decreased from 15 nA to 1.96 nA under the dark conditions (no illumination) and from 1500 nA to 23.92 nA at 480 nm illumination. Interestingly, the photocurrent of the SiNW-FET showed a logarithmic relationship with the drain voltage and nearly reached a maximum at 0.7 V (Fig. 2e and f). However, the photocurrent of the SPQ-FET was directly proportional to the drain voltage (Fig. 3a), which seems to have partially contributed to the higher photocurrent enhancing effect. A comparison of the photocurrent of the SPQ-FET with that of the SiNW-FET (Fig. 3b) revealed that the photocurrent was enhanced up to 6.5 times with the loading of ClpP–CdSe QDs on the SiNW-FET (Fig. S1†). Since the typical “enhancement factor” of other similar SiNW devices is less than 2:1.2 (SiNW with Au),32 1.35 (SiNW with Pt),33 and 2 (SiNW with Au),34 the photocurrent enhancement with ClpP–CdSe mounting is much higher than those of other known devices. In general, the performance of a photodetector is quantified in terms of the responsivity, which is described as R = Iph/Plight, where Iph is the photocurrent and Plight is the incident light power at a specific wavelength. Thus, the photocurrent responsivity of the SPQ-FET device was 3.1 × 106 A W−1 at VDS = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V, which is the highest responsivity among the reported values to date for photodetectors fabricated using SiNW-FETs.35–38 To further investigate the relationship between the photoresponsivity and QDs, the effect of an increase in the amount of ClpP–CdSe QDs on the photocurrent was investigated (Fig. 3c) by measuring IDS of the SPQ-FETs harboring different amounts of QDs (Fig. 3c) at VDS = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V. This study showed that the photocurrent increased linearly in proportion to the concentration of ClpP–CdSe regardless of light illumination. When 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μM of ClpP–CdSe were loaded, the IDS values of the SPG-FET were 4.80 nA, 10.06 nA, 17.69 nA, and 26.40 nA, respectively, under the dark conditions. However, under illumination with 480 nm light, the photocurrent was enhanced to 8.50 μA, 8.94 μA, 9.48 μA, and 10.09 μA, respectively, with the same concentration of ClpP–CdSe.

In the present study, the top-down-fabricated SiNWs with diameters of 150 nm showed a maximum absorbance at 480 nm. Since the 3.6 nm CdSe QDs encompassed by ClpP displayed the highest emission fluorescence in the range of 480 nm to 495 nm, the emitted fluorescence from QDs could possibly induce photocurrent in the SiNWs, which could be the main cause of the photocurrent enhancement upon ClpP–CdSe loading. Therefore, integration of ClpP-QDs with SiNWs has the benefit of improving the photoresponsivity. Hence, the optical properties of SiNWs and QDs should be synchronized to enhance the photocurrent and improve the photoresponsivity of SiNWs or to optimize the performance of the FET photodetector devices, which can be accomplished by tuning the sizes of the SiNWs and QDs. It was reported that the photocurrent in silicon nanowire charge transport channels can be enhanced by a factor of three by nonradiative resonance energy transfer (NERT) from lead sulfide (PbS) nanocrystal quantum dots when they are in close contact.39 In a similar manner, the photoresponse of CdSe–TiO2 films can be optimized by the control of the size and shape of the CdSe–TiO2 architecture.40 We believe that NERT also occurred in our system since CdSe QDs had a close contact with SiNWs. However, since the photocurrent enhancement was up to 6.5 times in the present study, it seems that the radioactive energy transfer from CdSe to SiNWs is the key mechanism of the enhanced photocurrent in our system.
QDs are a key component in nanoscale opto-electronic devices. Since the electronic energy levels of QDs are radically affected by their sizes, there is a great demand for reproducible methods to fabricate and handle quantum dots of the same size. To achieve this challenging target, we employed protein shells as a size-restraining chemical reaction chamber to synthesize uniform CdSe QDs. When PSs are employed as a template for nanoparticle synthesis, the diameters of nanoparticles inside the PSs depend largely on the geometry and size of the inner chamber of the PSs. In this study, ClpP is particularly useful since 3.6 nm QDs can be grown inside ClpP, and their optical performance overlaps with that of top-down fabricated SiNW-FET devices. In addition, protein coating is useful for the dispersion of NPs on inorganic material such as silicon, as demonstrated in constructing bionanohybrid capacitors.41 Apart from the usage of ClpP for the synthesis of controlled 3.6 nm QDs, SiNW-FETs coated with ClpP protein could serve as a versatile platform for building bio-nano interfaces that could be used to fabricate a biosensor by direct conversion of biological signals into electronic impulses.42
Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated SiNW-FETs using a top-down approach and confirmed that the device current was enhanced by a factor of 97 under illumination at 480 nm, the wavelength at which the SiNWs showed the highest photosensitivity. In addition, we synthesized CdSe QDs with a controlled diameter of 3.6 nm using ClpP shells and observed that the maximum emission of ClpP–CdSe was 480–495 nm. Furthermore, the fabrication of a SPQ-FET by integration of CdSe QD–ClpP and a SiNW-FET resulted in a photocurrent enhancement up to a factor of 382. As a result, the photoresponsivity to 480 nm light illumination reached up to 3.1 × 106, which is the highest value compared to other SiNW-based devices in the visible light range. These results demonstrate that the photocurrent of SiNW-FETs can be enhanced by integrating QDs when the emission light overlaps with the photo-absorption spectrum of the SiNWs. We believe that this study would be beneficial to develop SiNWs as optoelectric devices or sensors with an enhanced photosensitivity.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Characterization of ClpP–CdSe. (a) Transmission electron microscopy images of ClpP–CdSe with 2% uranyl acetate staining (the scale bar is 10 nm). The inset (top right) displays a magnified TEM image with a scale bar of 5 nm. (b) The fluorescence emission spectra of ClpP–CdSe in a wavelength range from 460 to 650 nm. The excitation wavelength was 365 nm. The inset in the left bottom shows the colors of ClpP–CdSe after illumination by white light and 365 nm light. The inset in the right top is the ribbon diagram of the crystal structure of ClpP (PDB ID: 2ZL0) with a CdSe model inside. Fourteen subunits are drawn in different colors. The internal and external diameters of ClpP are 5.8 nm and 9.5 nm, respectively. The CdSe QDs are represented as blue balls with a diameter of 3.6 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Schematic diagram of a SiNW-FET device chip with an enlarged view of the SiNW array in the inset. (b) Schematic representation of a SiNW-FET device with light illumination. (c) A representative IDS response of a SiNW-FET device measured at a gate voltage (VG) of 3.0 V with an illumination range from 300 to 1000 nm. (d) Photocurrent response of the SiNW-FET to the dark (no light) and 254 nm, 365 nm and 480 nm illumination. (e) IDS–VD of the SiNW-FET under the dark conditions (Light OFF) at VG values from +3.0 V to −3.0 V. The observed IDS was 15 nA at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V. (f) IDS–VD of a SiNW FET in response to blue light (480 nm, Light ON) at VG values from +3.0 V to −3.0 V. The observed IDS was 1500 nA at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photoelectrical properties of a SiNW-FET device and a SPQ-FET device with ClpP–CdSe. (a) IDS–VD at VG values from +3.0 V to −3.0 V (from top to bottom) with illumination at 480 nm. The observed IDS was 10.09 μA at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V. (b) Comparison of the photocurrent response in the SiNW-FET and SPQ-FET at VG = 3. 0 V with illumination at 480 nm. (c) Concentration dependency of the photocurrent response. The IDS values were monitored at VD = 1.0 V and VG = 3.0 V in the dark (Light OFF) and under light illumination (480 nm, Light ON).	 

SiNW-FET	16.0 nA	1.55 μA	4.8 × 105 A W−1
SPQ-FET	26.40 nA	10.09 μA	3.1 × 106 A W−1
