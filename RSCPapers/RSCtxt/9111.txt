    , Accepted 25th January 2017First published on 26th January 2017AbstractA recently reported triphenylamine (TPA) group in conjugation with a benzothiadiazole (BTD) moiety opens up the possibility for designing new organic sensitizers for solar cell applications that are amenable for structural tuning. Hence, seven new TPA molecules were designed from two experimentally reported molecules. The optoelectronic properties, including the absorption and emission spectra of the TPA derivatives, were studied via density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods. Different π-linkers were screened to understand the role of π-linkers in altering the optoelectronic properties of these molecules. Our results show that furan moieties bring planarity to the molecule and show reduced HOMO–LUMO gaps. All these molecules show excellent delocalization of π-electrons. TDDFT calculations show that furan-substituted TPA (TPA9) has the highest absorption maxima. Interestingly, the thiophene-substituted TPA (TPA7) was found to have a high emission maxima as it achieved planarity in the excited state. There is an excellent correlation observed between the computed optoelectronic properties and calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps. Overall, this study throws light on the role of π-linkers in the photophysical properties of TPA derivatives and provides useful clues in designing new molecules for optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
The global energy crisis and depletion of fossil fuels have laid the foundation for the search of alternate energy resources in recent years.1,2 Considering aspects, such as pollution free, cheap energy generation, and high performance, solar energy and harnessing solar cells have been identified as a promising clean alternate renewable energy source.3,4 Solar cells constructed using metal complexes, such as ruthenium(Ru)polypyridyl,5 cobalt(II/III)tris-bipyridyl,6 and zinc-phorphyrin7 complexes, have shown power conversion efficiencies of only 11–13% under global air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5G).8,9 However, the scarcity of metals and poor purification techniques hamper their effective usage.10 Therefore, significant attention has been devoted to the development of metal-free organic dye sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications.11 The main advantages associated with these organic sensitizers are (i) cost effectiveness, (ii) easy fabrication, (iii) tuneable absorption wavelength, and (iv) possibility for designing and engineering different sensitizers with suitable substituents.12,13 Hence, many research groups are actively involved in designing perfect organic sensitizers that can show better photon to current efficiency.14 Literature is flooded with various organic sensitizers with different architectures including D–A, D–π–A, D–π–π–A, D–A–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, D–π–A–π–D, and D–D–π–A.15–18 Among these, the most commonly studied organic sensitizer is of D–π–A type.19a,b Over the years, many organic core moieties have been used to produce various D–π–A type sensitizers. Some of the popular core dye moieties are coumarin, phenothiazine, carbazole dyes, perylene, squaraine, thiophene, indoline, cyanine, triphenylamine, pyrene, phenoxazine, arylamine, and thiadiazole(3,4-c)pyridine-based systems.20–24 In view of designing new organic sensitizers, the recently introduced benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit was considered for the present study.25 One of the highlights of organic sensitizers is their tunable frontier molecular orbital energy levels.26 For instance, the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be altered by choosing a suitable acceptor, whereas donor groups are used to alter the HOMO level.27 However, the major challenge is optimizing their photovoltaic performance with a suitable structure for practical usage in DSSCs. This requires a complete understanding of the structure–property relationship of organic sensitizers. Therefore, a systematic investigation is necessary to gain information about various groups present in organic sensitizers. Recent reports show that the energy levels along with other optoelectronic properties can be further tuned when an additional unit of the electron withdrawing conjugated component (auxiliary acceptor) is introduced into the traditional D–π–A structure.28 Especially, an inclusion of the BTD unit features a benzoheterocyclic structure containing the electron deficient CN bonds. Moreover, the BTD group promotes spatial charge separation effectively and leads to improvement in the solar cell performances.29a This triggers a great deal of interest in designing new organic sensitizers for DSSC applications with the BTD unit. In this context, a series of triphenylamine (TPA) based organic molecules with an auxiliary acceptor benzothiadiazole (BTD) has been designed, and their ground state structural properties have been evaluated through DFT calculations. Excited state properties and other optoelectronic properties have been studied using TD-DFT methods.29b Here, TPA is used as a donor, cyanoacrylic acid is used as an acceptor, and different π-linkers have been used (Scheme 1). Our aim is to tune the structure of TPA–BTD based organic sensitizers using various π-linkers in search of better candidates for DSSC applications. Though the literature is flooded with many theoretical studies on tuning π-linkers for optoelectronic applications, we looked in to the role of π-linkers in the presence of an auxiliary acceptor (BTD unit).29c

In this present work, we started with a conformational search to identify the most stable conformation followed by calculations of various optoelectronic properties including FMOs, absorption and emission spectra, light harvesting efficiency (LHE), ionization potentials (IPs), electronic affinities (EAs) and reorganization energy (λhole/electron). The results are discussed below.
2. Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed for optimization of these molecules at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level using the G09 program.30 As these molecules show multiple conformations, a conformational search was done to identify the most stable structure. Optimization followed by frequency calculations have been performed to confirm that the optimized structure corresponds to the minimum on the potential energy surface (PES). Among the nine molecules (Scheme 1), two (TPA1 and TPA2) have been reported earlier.31,32 One of the attractive features of these molecules is the presence of weak intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. This has been extensively studied through quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis using the AIM 2000 package.33 The necessary wave functions for QTAIM calculations have been generated at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level using the G09 program. TDDFT calculations have been carried out to calculate the absorption spectra using the optimized ground state geometries for the 20 lowest singlet vertical excitations.34 Earlier studies revealed that many functionals are capable of producing good results in predicting the absorption spectra of organic molecules.23,35–37 However, the tough task is to find the suitable functional for a particular class of organic molecules that can give reasonable results in comparison with experiments. Therefore, different functionals [B3LYP, B3P86, M06, LC-ωPBE, M06-2X, PBEPBE, PBE1PBE, ωB97x-D3, BP86 and MPW1PW91] have been screened for the calculation of the absorption spectra of TPA1 and TPA2 molecules in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol solvents, respectively (as the absorption spectra of TPA1 and TPA2 are reported in these solvents experimentally).32,33 The obtained results are depicted in Fig. 1. From the figure, it is clear that the M06-2X functional performs well to give a closer λmax to the experimental values. Hence, the M06-2X functional was used in conjugation with the 6-311++G(d,p) for TDDFT calculations in the present work. The self-consistent reaction field-polarisable continuum model (SCRF-PCM)38 was used to account for the effect of solvation on the absorption and emission spectra. In addition to these, other electronic properties, such as light harvesting efficiency (LHE), ionization potentials (IPs), electronic affinities (EAs), reorganization energy (λhole/electron), singlet excited state radiative lifetime (τ) and NLO properties, were calculated to shed light on the photophysical properties of these organic sensitizers.

3. Result and discussion

Scheme 1 represents the TPA molecules with different π-linkers considered for this present study. Among the nine molecules, TPA1 and TPA2 have been reported by K. C. Ho et al. and M. G. Park et al., respectively.37,38 Our aim is to understand the nature of the π-linkers within the TPA–BTD framework for better optoelectronic properties. In all the molecules, the cyanoacrylic acid coupled with the benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is constant and only the π-linkers are varied. Therefore, TPA3 was designed by extending the π-conjugation of TPA2 by adding one more –CHCH– group. Then, to understand how aromaticity alters the electronic properties of these molecules, TPA4 and TPA5 were designed using one and two benzene rings, respectively. TPA5 is an extension of TPA4 by adding one more benzene ring. It would be interesting to see how heterocycles alter the structure and electronic properties of these TPA derivatives; therefore, TPA6-9 molecules were designed. Among the heterocycles, the effect of the hetero atom (S and O) has been studied through thiophene (TPA6 and 7) and furan (TPA8 and 9) moieties, respectively. By taking TPA1 as a reference molecule, the other eight molecules were evaluated for their optoelectronic properties for solar cell applications where only the π-linkers are varied. The excellent flexible nature of the organic molecules leads to different conformers. Therefore, a conformational search has to be carried out to locate the most stable conformer of an organic molecule. Hence, the geometry optimization is carried out with different starting geometries, and the most stable geometries were considered for the present investigation after confirming their stability through frequency calculations [detailed conformational analysis is given ESI‡ 1.2].
3.1 Geometry optimization
All these calculated bond parameters suggest that these molecules are found to have an excellent delocalization of π-electrons throughout the molecules39 [Fig. S3 and S4, ESI‡]. Remember, delocalization is one of the key aspects for a molecule to exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties. Upon introduction of alkenyl π-linkers into TPA1, the molecule gains planarity. For example, TPA1 has a dihedral angle of 144.88°, which gains planarity and shifted to −169.52° in TPA2 when the –CC– group is introduced. Further, this becomes 179.80° (∼180°) upon the addition of another –CC– group in TPA3. This shows that the addition of alkenyl π-linkers influences the planarity of these TPA–BTD dye sensitizers. In TPA4 and TPA5, the aromatic benzene ring units are introduced. It is interesting to note that the benzene rings and BTD unit are not in one plane because of the steric hindrance. However, when the heterocycle is introduced (TPA6–TPA9), the molecule achieves planarity. In TPA6, the dihedral angle of Φ2(C–C–C–S) is 150.37°, which is nearly 10° higher than the C–C–C–C dihedral angle (Φ2) observed in TPA5. The same C–C–C–C dihedral angle becomes ∼176° in TPA8 (Fig. 2). This indicates that the insertion of heterocycles as π-linkers favours planarity. Moving from TPA8 to TPA9, the dihedral angle C–C–C–C becomes more planar at −177.43° (Φ2). Thus, the extension of π-linkers through two furan units brings planarity to these molecules. Now the question arises, how can the heterocycles bring planarity while the benzene rings do not? The answer is the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the case of heterocycles. For instance, TPA9 shows CH–N hydrogen bonding while the benzene substituted TPA molecule (TPA4 and TPA5) does not show this intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Thus, the hydrogen bond plays a vital role in bringing planarity to these molecules. To ascertain the nature of the hydrogen bonding present in these molecules, QTAIM calculations were done on TPA9 and are given in Fig. 3. The right hand side panel represents the laplacian of the rho graph, while the left hand side gives a zero flux surface graph of the identified hydrogen bonds. From the figure, it is clear that the valence shell charge concentration of hydrogen (which is involved in hydrogen bonding) is slightly deformed from its position and orients towards the axis of the most electronegative nitrogen atom. This leads to the formation of strong hydrogen bonding interactions. This has been confirmed by drawing the zero flux surface of the N–H interaction (left panel in Fig. 3) where the trajectories originating from the hydrogen atom are marching towards the nitrogen atom. This is excellent evidence for the presence of strong N–H interactions in this molecule. The π-linkers affect the planarity of the molecules and are responsible for the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in these molecules. Overall, the calculated geometric parameters imply that planarity and delocalization can be tuned by varying the π-linkers and are very important for their optoelectronic properties.

3.2 Frontier molecular orbitals
Over the years, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) have been used to obtain useful information on the excitation properties of organic molecules.27a,b The FMO energy levels along with the HOMO–LUMO gaps are depicted in Fig. 4. Among the nine molecules, TPA1 was found to have the highest HOMO–LUMO gap of 4.02 eV. Upon introduction of alkenyl π-linkers (ethene and butadiene in to the TPA–BTD frame works in TPA2 and TPA3, respectively), the HOMO–LUMO gap starts diminishing. TPA2 shows a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.81 eV, which is further reduced to 3.67 eV in TPA3. As discussed earlier, upon the insertion of the –CHCH– group to the TPA1, TPA2 gains planarity. This is reflected in the HOMO–LUMO gap as well. Further increasing the conjugation, TPA3 shows a reduced HOMO–LUMO gap (0.35 eV) from TPA1. This reveals that the planarity and extended conjugation play a synergic role in TPA3 having a reduced HOMO–LUMO gap. Introduction of benzene rings to the system does not reduce the HOMO–LUMO gap. For instance, TPA4 shows only a 0.11 eV reduction in the HOMO–LUMO gap from TPA1. The addition of another benzene ring to TPA4 further increases the HOMO–LUMO gap of TPA5 to 3.91 eV from 3.87 eV. Thus, TPA5 was found to have a wide HOMO–LUMO gap compared to TPA2 and TPA3. The reason behind the poor reduction in the HOMO–LUMO gap in TPA4 and TPA5 is their non-planar structure. However, this planarity issue is solved when heterocycles are introduced. TPA8 with a furan moiety was found to have a HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.71 eV, which is lower than TPA6 (3.77 eV). However, when two thiophene rings are inserted (TPA7), the HOMO–LUMO gap is further reduced to 3.66 eV. Comparing TPA9 and TPA7, TPA9 has a 3.58 eV HOMO–LUMO gap, which is the lowest among the studied nine molecules. The energy levels reveal that TPA9 and TPA3 have reduced HOMO–LUMO gaps. This indicates that these molecules can have higher absorption and emission wavelengths suitable for various optoelectronic applications. In order to understand the nature of the FMOs, HOMO−1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 were analysed and are given in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 clearly indicates that the LUMO is predominantly stabilized by BTD and cyanoacrylic acid groups. The TPA unit is mainly involved in the stabilization of the HOMO along with the π-linkers.

 Fig. 5  The FMOs (HOMO−1 to LUMO+1) of the TPA derivatives. 
To gain more insights into the FMOs, the energetics of FMOs and their corresponding compositions were calculated using the QMForge program.40 Here, the molecule was segmented into 4 units: the donor (triphenylamine), π-linker, BTD (benzothiadiazole) and acceptor (cyanoacrylic acid), and the results are given in Fig. 6. In all molecules, the donor unit contributes significantly (58–92%) towards the stabilization of the HOMO. In all molecules, the BTD unit largely stabilizes the LUMO, and its contribution to the LUMO varies from 57% to 65%. The HOMO is also stabilized by π-linkers to a certain extent (7 to 36%). Especially when the molecules attain planarity, the contribution of π-linkers to the HOMO level increases. This information is very handy in designing molecules with the desired HOMO and LUMO levels for various solar cell applications.

3.3 Absorption spectra
Over the years, time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have been used extensively for the prediction of absorption and emission spectra.27a,41 Therefore, the TDDFT gas phase calculations have been performed at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level on the optimized ground state geometries. The choice of the functional is discussed in the Computational details section. The resultant vertical transition energies (E in eV), oscillator strength (f0) and the compositions and percentage contributions of the various configurations are summarised in Table 1. These TPA derivatives show a series of bands (ranges from 350 to 550 nm), and the most intense bands along with their transitions are given in Table 1. In all the molecules, the S0 → S1 electronic transitions are predominant with high oscillator strengths. As expected, the TPA9 is found to have the highest λmax with 535 nm, which has an oscillator strength of 1.264. This transition is due to 97% contributions from the HOMO → LUMO and arises mainly due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) along with π → π* transitions. The second best molecule in terms of λmax is TPA3 (526 nm) with an excitation energy of 1.692 eV, while TPA8 shows a λmax of 525 nm with an oscillator strength of 1.050. In TPA3 and TPA9, apart from the HOMO → LUMO transitions, the HOMO−1 to LUMO transition contributes nearly 15% towards the λmax. Among all, TPA5 has the highest excitation energy (3.04 eV), while TPA9 has the lowest excitation energy of 2.31 eV. It is important to note that the HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions predominantly contribute (54%) more than the HOMO → LUMO (32%) for the λmax in TPA5. Further, the HOMO−2 → LUMO also contributes (8%) towards the λmax of TPA5. It was noted that the addition of one more furan ring to TPA8 increases the λmax of TPA9 by 10 nm. Similarly, the addition of one more thiophene ring to TPA6 leads to 504 nm in TPA7 from 498 nm. Surprisingly, TPA4 and TPA5 show lower wavelengths of absorption, 428 nm and 409 nm, respectively. It is interesting to note that the addition of one more benzene ring to TPA4 brings down the λmax by 19 nm. It is usually expected that wide HOMO–LUMO gap molecules show much lower λmax. However, here, TPA4 and TPA5 show much lower absorption maxima than TPA1 (472 nm). This is due to the non-planar structure of the TPA4 and TPA5 molecules. As discussed earlier, the addition of one more benzene ring to TPA4 makes TPA5 deviate from planarity. This largely affects the absorption spectra of TPA4 and TPA5. This study shows that TPA1 is tuned through various π-linkers, and their absorption wavelengths are increased up to ∼65 nm.

3.4 Emission spectra
TDDFT calculations have been used to determine the emission spectra of TPA–BTD based solar sensitizers.23 The excited state optimized geometries were considered for calculations of the emission spectra, and the corresponding oscillator strength, excitation energies and transition configuration are given in Table 2. As expected, the S1 → S0 transitions were found to have a high oscillator strength, which indicates that these molecules will have large fluorescence intensities.42 It is clear that the emission spectra appear at higher wavelengths (∼100 nm) than their absorption maxima. TPA7 was found to have a λmax at 643 nm, which is 139 nm higher than its absorption maxima. This transition is due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) along with the π → π* transitions. As observed in the absorption spectra, TPA5 was found to have the lowest λmax at 517 nm. The increasing order of λmax in the emission spectra of these TPA derivatives is TPA5 < TPA4 < TPA1 < TPA2 < TPA6 < TPA8 < TPA9 < TPA3 < TPA7. All these transitions come from the HOMO → LUMO and HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions, respectively. However, the HOMO → LUMO transitions predominate with 70–90% contributions, while the HOMO−1 → LUMO transition contributes only 10–30%. Increasing the π-conjugation from TPA2 to TPA3 shows a 35 nm increase in the emission maxima. However, this emission maximum was only 17 nm higher than its absorption maxima. Similarly, increasing the π-conjugation with an additional thiophene and furan ring in TPA6 & TPA7 and TPA8 & TPA9 increased the λmax by 27 nm and 22 nm, respectively. Only a 3 nm difference was observed in the emission maxima when a single atom was replaced in TPA6 by the oxygen in TPA8. The same trend was observed for TPA7 and TPA9 where the emission maxima were found to be at 643 nm and 641 nm, respectively. It was expected that TPA9 will show a better emission maximum than the rest of the TPA derivatives. However, TPA7 was found to have a higher λmax in emission. This is due to the planarity achieved by TPA7 in its excited state. This can be clearly understood from the structural parameters calculated at the excited state. For example, the dihedral angles (Φ2, Φ3 and Φ4) of TPA7 at the ground state were 149.44°, −157.3° and 168°, respectively. In the excited state, TPA7 gains planarity, and Φ2, Φ3 and Φ4 were found to be 168.3°, −178.1° and 179.2°, respectively (Fig. S5, ESI‡). This is the reason why TPA7 possesses a better emission than that of the expected TPA9. In optoelectronics, it is important to know that the shorter the radiative life time, the better the light emitting efficiency.43 This is extremely important in solar cell applications. The radiative life time (τ) can be calculated using the following formula:44τ = 1.499/f0E2where E is the excitation energy in cm−1 and f0 is the oscillator strength of electronic excited state. Using the above formula, the radiative life times were calculated for all TPA derivatives and are listed in Table 3. From the table, it is clear that TPA5 was found to have a better light emitting efficiency with 2.62 ns compared to the rest of the TPA molecules. This shows that all other TPA molecules are expected to have better electron transport properties. This illustrates that π-linkers do not have great control over the light emitting and electron transport properties.

3.5 Optoelectronic properties

3.5.1 Light harvesting efficiency (LHE). 
The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) is a very important factor for organic dyes, considering the role of dyes in the DSSC, i.e., absorbing photons and injecting photoexcited electrons to the conduction band of the semi-conductor (TiO2). The LHE can be calculated using the oscillator strength obtained from TDDFT calculations.45a,b It is well known that LHE can be calculated using the following formula:46 LHE(λ) = 1–10−f(1)where f is the oscillator strength of the organic molecule at a given wavelength. The calculated LHE of these sensitizers are collected in Table 3. From the table, it is clear that all the designed molecules show improved LHE compared to the reference molecule TPA1. The lower HOMO–LUMO gap of TPA3 shows a higher LHE with 0.98, while the higher HOMO–LUMO gap molecule TPA1 has a lower LHE with 0.87. This shows that TPA derivatives can be tuned through the proper substitution of auxiliary π-linkers for better LHE.


3.5.2 Ionization potential and electron affinity. 
Investigating the ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EAs) of organic molecules gives information about the charge-injection and charge transport character of a molecule.47 The balance between charge injection and transport is very important in deciding the electronic properties of DSSC molecules.48 Therefore, the ionization potential (IPs), electron affinities (EAs), hole extraction potential (HEP), and electron extraction potential (EEP) of these nine TPA molecules were calculated as reported earlier using the following equation:49 λhole = [E+(M0) − E+(M+)] + [E(M+) − E(M0)] = IP(v) – HEP(2) λelectron = [E−(M0) − E−(M−)] + [E(M−) − E(M0)] = EEP − EA(v)(3)Where, E+, E− and E represent the energies of a cation, anion and neutral species based on their lowest energy geometries, respectively. While (M+) and (M0) denote their optimized structures at charged and neutral states, E+(M0) and E−(M0) are the energy of a cation/anion calculated with the optimized structure of a neutral molecule M0. The computed IP and EA values are collected in Table 3. It is well known that the higher the EA, the higher the electron transport ability will be. Thus, it is clear that TPA1 has a lower EA value and was found to show a higher hole transport property and poor electron transport ability. This was also reflected in its λhole value (discussed later). It is interesting to note that the lower HOMO–LUMO gap TPA9 shows a lower IP value with 6.62 eV and a higher EA value with 2.13 eV. This indicates that this TPA9 can act as both a hole transport material as well as an electron transport material. Thus, this study shows that the introduction of π-linkers tune the charge transport nature of these TPA derivatives.


3.5.3 Reorganization energy. 
The rate of the charge transport of DSSC molecule is essential for DSSC applications. This can be studied by calculating the reorganization energy of organic molecules. It is important to note that the lower the hole transport reorganization energy (λhole), the better the hole transport material. Similarly, the lower the electron transport reorganization energy (λelectron), the faster the electron transport will be. Table 3 shows that TPA1 is the best hole transport material, which has the lowest λhole value of 0.13 eV. This has also been inferred from its low EA value. As the π-linkers are introduced into TPA1, the λhole started increasing, and the λelectron decreased. As observed in IP and EA calculations, TPA9 can act as an ambipolar material. TPA9 shows equal λhole and λelectron values (0.39 eV). The largest HOMO–LUMO gap attributed to the TPA4 molecule was found to have a better hole transport material than the rest of the designed molecules. Similar to TPA4, TPA5 also shows a minimum λhole value of 0.21 eV and a higher λelectron value of 0.47 eV. This implies that the hole transport rate is higher than the electron transport rate. TPA7 shows a λelectron of 0.40 eV, which is lower than its λhole value, and tells that the hole transport rate is slower in TPA7. Overall, these molecules are good hole transport and electron transport materials and can be tuned upon suitable substitution.


3.5.4 Non-linear optical (NLO) properties. 
The donor–π–acceptor types of organic molecules are usually found to show non-linear optical (NLO) activity. This NLO activity is characterized by calculating the first order hyperpolarizability (β0), which is a third rank tensor. β0 is described by a 3 × 3 × 3 matrix, and these 27 components are reduced to 10 components according to Kleinman symmetry.50 The first order hyperpolarizability of these 9 molecules was calculated from x, y and z components of β using the following formula:27  where βx2 = (βxxx + βxyy + βxzz)2, βy2 = (βyyy + βyzz + βyxx)2 and βz2 = (βzzz + βzxx + βzyy)2.
The calculated βtot values are given in Table 3, and the detailed calculations are given in the ESI‡ (Table S12). As expected, there is an excellent correlation between the HOMO–LUMO gap and the computed NLO response in terms of β values. The higher HOMO–LUMO gap molecules, TPA 4 and TPA 5, show poor NLO responses of 1.99 × 10−28 esu and 1.77 × 10−28 esu, respectively. The perfect planar molecule TPA3 has the highest NLO response with 5.63 × 10−28 esu, and TPA9 and TPA7 follow with 4.81 × 10−28 esu and 4.46 × 10−28 esu, respectively. The addition of one –CC– group increases the βtot by 1.66 × 10−28 esu, while the addition of one more furan unit to TPA8 increases the βtot by 1.40 × 10−28 esu. Thus, planarity achieved by the addition of different π-linkers is important in altering the NLO activity of these TPA derivatives.
Overall, our study came up with the following guidelines for the design of better DSSC candidates. (i) When introducing π-linkers, the planarity of the molecule should not be affected. (ii) Alkenyl π-linkers are better than aromatic π-linkers in reducing the HOMO–LUMO gap. (iii) Varying the π-linkers will help to tune the HOMO level, while the suitable substitution on the acceptor will help to alter the LUMO level. (vi) Heterocycle moieties are found to play a crucial role in not only extending the π-conjugation but also maintaining the planarity of the molecule.

4. Conclusion
A comprehensive electronic structure characterization has been done on TPA derivatives with a view to understand their optoelectronic properties at the molecular level for solar cell applications using DFT/TDDFT calculations. Seven out of the nine molecules investigated here were designed using various π-linkers, and their properties are compared with experimentally reported molecules (TPA1 and TPA2). Our results revealed that five out of the seven designed candidates had a lower HOMO–LUMO gap than their reference molecules. Our calculations show that the alkenyl π-linkers have better planarity and reduced the HOMO–LUMO gap more than the aromatic π-linkers. Furan based TPAs were found to have better planarity than the thiophene based TPAs. The FMO analysis shows that the donor unit largely stabilizes the HOMO along with the π-linkers, whereas, the LUMO is localized on the benzothiadiazole (BTD) and acceptor units, respectively. The TDDFT calculations show that the lower HOMO–LUMO gap molecules (TPA9 and TPA3) show the highest λmax in the absorption spectrum. To our surprise, TPA7 has a high emission wavelength compared to the expected TPA9. This is due to the geometric changes that take place in the excited state of TPA7 where it gains planarity. In these molecules, the solvent plays a role in altering their absorption and emission spectra. The calculated reorganization energies imply that these molecules can act as both electron transport and hole transport materials. The designed molecules show improved light harvesting efficiency (LHE) and increased non-linear optical (NLO) activities. In summary, these TPA derivatives can be suitably tuned through various π-linkers for solar cell applications. The role of BTD in these derivatives is under investigation in our laboratories and will be reported soon.
