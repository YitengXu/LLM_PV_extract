With the continuous development of the energy sector, researchers are constantly exploring and developing new high-performance, inexpensive catalysts to meet the demand. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) as ever-evolving catalytic materials have received more and more attention. Many studies have suggested that transition metal phosphides could be ideal catalysts due to their low cost, abundance, and high efficiency. In many areas, TMPs can be applied as stable and efficient catalytic materials. Therefore, many kinds of TMPs are designed and synthesized by different methods. This article has summarized the recent research progress of TMPs, including their preparation methods and morphologies. Moreover, the application and catalytic performance of TMPs in different catalytic fields are further elaborated, and views on the opportunities and challenges faced by phosphide catalysts are presented.
1 Introduction
With recent economic and social development, the demand for energy dramatically increases as well.1–4 Currently, exploring new forms of energy conversion to improve energy efficiency is a research hotspot around the world. There are many forms of energy conversion, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the water splitting process, oxidation reduction reaction (ORR), methanol oxidation, etc.5–7 For instance, in the water splitting reaction (including the HER and OER), the required voltage is theoretically 1.23 V. However, due to the existence of reactive energy barriers, the voltage required in the actual electrochemical reaction is much larger than the theoretical value.8–14 In many energy conversions, the catalyst is indispensable in the reaction. The use of catalysts in the conversion can significantly reduce the energy consumption in the conversion process and increase the energy conversion rate.15
In order to reduce the energy required for electrochemical reactions, researchers have begun to explore catalyst materials. Precious metal-based catalysts exhibit very good catalytic performance in many energy conversion fields. It is well known that Pt and its composites have excellent HER catalytic properties, as it has a very low overpotential in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In addition to the HER direction, Pt based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performance in other fields, such as the ORR, photocatalysis, etc. Although noble metal-based catalysts possess good catalytic performance, their high cost and other disadvantages limit their potential for large-scale applications. Therefore, many studies have focused on the development of new, low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts to replace noble metal based catalysts.16–25
With advances in characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, researchers have gained a deeper understanding of catalytic materials and can also design catalysts with excellent performance. For instance, the catalyst is essential in the HER process. Hydrogen adsorption and desorption on the surface of the catalytic material determine the catalytic performance. Therefore, the ideal catalyst should have a relatively balanced ability.26,27 The Sabatier principle pointed out that the catalyst surface which has intermediate bonding energies with reactive intermediates can achieve optimal catalytic performance.28 Parsons et al. indicated that the maximum exchange current density could be reached when the hydrogen adsorption free energy was close to thermoneutral (ΔGH ∼ 0).29 Nørskov et al. calculated ΔGH on different transition metals via density functional theory (DFT) calculation. They suggested that ΔGH is a useful descriptor in the selection of new electrocatalysts for the HER.26
Recently, a variety of catalysts have been developed, mainly based on metal-based catalysts. Among these catalysts, transition metal based catalysts exhibit impressive electrochemical performance as electrode materials.30,31 The commonly used transition metal elements are mainly Co, Fe, Ni, Mn, etc. Non-metallic elements generally used in electrode materials are C, N, O, S and P32,33 Catalytic materials composed of these transition metal elements and non-metallic elements exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in many fields. For example, transition metal sulfides (NiS2, NiCo2S4, CoNi2S4, NiMoS, etc.) can not only be applied in the supercapacitor area, but also have the ability to photolyze water or electrolyze water.34–39 Transition metal oxides, such as NiCo2O4, can be used not only in the direction of energy storage (supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries), but also as electrocatalytic materials (OER and photocatalysis).40,41 Among the transition metal-based catalysts, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are currently representative catalytic materials.
TMPs have been synthesized and applied for a long time. In the early days, they were mainly employed in hydrodesulfurization (HDS).42 In 2005, Ping Liu et al. used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and DFT calculations to investigate the Ni2P catalyst in the desulfurization process of thiophene (a typical test molecule in HDS studies) and found the complex and important role that P sites play in the phosphide. Firstly, the authors suggested that the formation of Ni–P bonds produces a weak “ligand effect” (minor stabilization of the Ni 3d levels and a small Ni → P charge transfer) that allows a high activity for the dissociation of thiophene and molecular hydrogen. Secondly, because of an “ensemble effect” of P, the number of active Ni sites present in the surface decreases a lot, which prevents the system from deactivation induced by the high coverage of strongly bound S. The authors also suggested that the P sites in Ni2P are not simple spectators, and they provide moderate bonding to the products of the decomposition of thiophene and the H adatoms necessary for hydrogenation.43 Inspired by HDS, the authors connected a similar mechanism of HER, which also involved reversible association and dissociation of hydrogen atoms in the process like HDO. Later, the authors employed DFT-GGA calculations to investigate the HER activity of Ni2P (001) and compared it with those of other materials. The article reported that the good behavior of Ni2P in the HER is associated with an ensemble effect, where the concentration of highly active Ni sites in the surface is decreased by the presence of P. Besides, the P sites are not simple spectators and provide moderate bonding to the reaction intermediates, due to these factors the surface has proton-acceptor and hydride-acceptor centers that work to facilitate the HER.44
The recent development of transition metal nitrides as another promising family of transition metal-based catalysts enlightened us about the application of TMPs in energy conversion. The metal–N4 chelate bond in the macrocycles (M–N4-macrocycles), possessed from Fe or Co polyaniline, porphyrin, and phthalocyanine compounds are generally recognized as an active site for the efficient reduction of oxygen, even outperforming the well-known Pt/C.45 The reason from the perspective of molecular orbital theory is that the M–N4 structure complexes with the conjugated π-electron system, which serves as the center of oxygen activation. This causes an increase of the O–O bond distance, and thus, stimulates the ORR on the surface of the catalysts.46 Given this, phosphorous (P), belonging to the same nitrogen group, is likely to possess superior chemical properties compared to the N atom due to the existence of multi-electron orbitals. Even though the relevant theoretical explanation has not been suggested, the wide application of TMPs in various energy conversion fields has proved it worth searching.
Recently, TMPs have received more and more attention due to their unique electrochemical properties. TMPs have demonstrated good catalytic performance in many fields. For example, in the HER direction, TMPs have proven to be high-performance catalysts which have high activity, high stability, and close to 100% faradaic efficiency in a strong acid, a strong base and a neutral medium while also having high catalytic efficiency. Besides the HER, TMPs also show great potential for applications in other areas.47,48 In this review, we investigate and survey the recent progress of cost-effective and high-performance transition metal phosphides as catalysts for energy conversion, such as HDO, HER, ORR and photocatalysis. For the convenience of discussion, we mainly focus on the preparation methods, morphologies and applications of TMPs in the field of catalysis. This work aims to provide insights on the advances of transition metal phosphides. Finally, the prospects for the development of TMPs as catalysts in the future will also be discussed.
2 Category of transition metal phosphides
Among the TMPs, the elements for transition metals mainly include Co, Ni, Fe, and Mo. Some transitional metal elements that are also getting more and more research attention are W, Mn, Cu, etc. These transition metal elements are used to synthesize a wide variety of phosphides. For example, transition metal phosphides can be divided into single transition metal phosphides and multiple transition metal phosphides. Typical single transition metal phosphides mainly include CoP, Co2P, Ni2P, Ni5P4, FeP, Fe2P, etc. Multiple TMPs are mainly NiCo2Px, Co–Fe–P, NiFe–P, etc. There are some other element doped TMPs, such as Fe-doped CoP, Fe-doped Ni2P, etc. In this part, we mainly introduce the synthesis of TMPs and their special morphologies according to this classification (Table 1).

2.1 Single transition metal phosphides
Single TMPs are the most common class of phosphides. Researchers have prepared a variety of phosphides via different synthetic methods. The morphologies of these phosphides are also different. Cobalt and nickel phosphides are the most common phosphides. Many interesting morphologies for Co- or Ni-based phosphides have been reported. Chua et al. fabricated nanostructured CoP particles via a two-step process. They first prepared Co3O4 nanocubes via a facile hydrothermal method. This process can be performed at 120 °C. In the next step, they converted the crystalline Co3O4 to CoP particles by chemical vapor deposition. This structured CoP exhibited good performance for the HER.49 Similarly, Li et al. also prepared CoP compounds with a similar morphology. The synthesis process is shown in Fig. 1a. They first prepared carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and then adopted metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates to synthesize ZIF-67-CNTs. This process mainly utilizes the self-assembly growth of Co-based MOFs with the CNTs. They obtained a special morphology; Co-based MOFs were connected together by CNTs. Finally, CoP-CNTs were obtained by annealing and phosphating processes. The CoP-CNT hybrids exhibited excellent electrochemical performance.50

In addition to such nanostructures, Wang et al. fabricated porous CoP nanosheets on carbon paper (p-CoP/CP). As shown in Fig. 1b, they first prepared CoAl-layered double hydroxide (CoAl-LDH), and then used NaOH solution to remove the Al element to obtain a porous structure. Followed by the phosphating process, the target p-CoP/CP with rich edge sites was synthesized.51 Sun et al. also reported a strategy to synthesize hierarchical CoP nanosheet@microwire arrays on nickel foam. Co(H2PO4)2·2H3PO4, Co(OH)F, Co(OH)CO3 and Co(OH)2 were synthesized as precursors. The nanosheet and microwire structure of the precursors were basically retained after phosphating. This structure of CoP also possessed excellent electrochemical performance. This method also provides a common approach for the preparation of catalysts with a similar morphology.52
Co2P is also an important catalytic material in cobalt-based phosphides. Researchers also synthesized a variety of morphologies of Co2P materials through different methods. Zhang et al. synthesized a hollow nanoflower structured Co2P by one-step thermal decomposition. Organic phosphorus and triphenylphosphine were used as phosphorus sources. It was then thermally decomposed at 280 °C. This hollow nanoflower structure was actually self-assembled from Co2P nanorods.54 Li et al. reported a novel method to fabricate a carbon wrapped Co2P nanohybrid catalyst on carbon cloth (Co2P@C/CC). Co2P was successfully synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reduction for the first time. Fig. 1c displays the diagram of the synthesis process in which Co3(PO4)2 is used as a precursor instead of hypophosphite. This approach is more environmentally friendly and the resulting product is also more pure.55
Nickel-based phosphides are also important catalytic materials at present. There are also many methods to prepare different morphologies of phosphides. Zheng et al. reported a simple method to synthesize 3D Ni2P nanoparticles from scrap nickel on carbon cloth (Ni2P NPs/CC). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, they first dissolved waste nickel in formic acid solution by a simple ultrasonic method. Then NiO nanoparticles were fabricated by photochemical vapor generation and CVD. Finally, the target product is obtained by phosphating.60 Wang et al. synthesized a flower-like Ni2P which was assembled from the nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, this structured Ni2P was prepared via two steps. They first synthesized a nanosheet structure of a nickel compound as a precursor, and then Ni2P was fabricated via phosphidation treatment. They prepared Ni2P samples with different nanosheet structures by controlling the reaction time.61 Cao et al. reported another different structure of Ni2P. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, they synthesized a hollow microsphere structure of Ni2P. The hollow microspheres are self-assembled from ultrathin nanosheets. The Ni2P hollow microspheres were synthesized via a facile two-step process, including hydrothermal synthesis of Ni(OH)2 followed by phosphorization with NaH2PO2 under argon.62

FeP is also a kind of catalytic material that is currently widely used. Jin et al. provided an effective approach for fabricating porous FeP microspheres which were formed from ultrafine FeP. They first made urchin-like FeOOH microspheres as precursors under mild reaction conditions (70 °C, 3 h). The porous FeP microspheres were prepared by the gas–solid phosphorization reaction. The FeOOH precursor can be converted into FeP while the microsphere structure remains unchanged.66 Lei et al. also prepared a hollow microsphere structure of FeP. The FeP hollow microspheres were assembled from nanosheets instead of nanoparticles. As shown in Fig. 3a, they used a straightforward approach to fabricate FeP hollow microspheres. This process mainly included two steps, hydrothermal synthesis of Fe precursor hollow microspheres and the direct phosphating process. They prepared different morphologies of phosphides by controlling the amount of ethylenediamine.67 Wang et al. fabricated a novel three-dimensional FeP/VAGN (vertically aligned graphene nanosheets) hybrid nanostructure. The FeP nanorods can be prepared by a simple two-step process as shown in Fig. 3b. The FeOOH precursors were fabricated via a facile electrodeposition method. Compared to other methods, the experimental conditions required for this preparation method are much simpler. By controlling the deposition voltage, they prepared target products with different morphologies. This approach provides a new idea for the future preparation of phosphides with a similar morphology.68

Cu is also a common transition metal element, and its related compounds are also widely used today. Cu3P is a typical catalytic material; people have prepared a variety of morphologies for Cu3P. The more common morphology of Cu3P is nanowires, or nanorods. Sun et al. fabricated Cu3P nanoarrays on copper foam. They first treated the Cu foil with ammonium persulfate to oxidize it and then reacted it with alkali to prepare Cu(OH)2 as a precursor. The morphology of Cu(OH)2 is nanowire-like, and this morphology is retained after phosphating.69 Yan et al. also prepared Cu3P nanowires on the Cu foil (Cu3P/CF) by the same method as shown in Fig. 4a and b. This also proves the high repeatability of the method.70 Cu3P not only possesses a nanowire morphology, but also can be fabricated into other nanostructures. Shen et al. synthesized a three-dimensional (3D) superstructure of carbon-wrapped, single-crystalline Cu3P porous nanosheets (Cu3P@C) via a self-assembly method as shown in Fig. 4c and d. They covered the phosphorus-containing resin in a quartz boat with copper foam. Then the boat was heated to 900 °C for 60 min to prepare Cu3P. Cu3P can also be prepared into nanocubes.71 Kong et al. synthesized Cu3P nanocubes via a simple two-step strategy. As shown in Fig. 4e and f, they first mixed CuCl2·2H2O and NaOH together, and then ascorbic acid solution was added to prepare Cu2O nanocubes as the precursor. Then after phosphating, these nanocubes still retained the original structure.72

The Mo element is also a kind of transition metal element that has been widely used. Although its chalcogenide is more common than the phosphides, the phosphides have also begun attracting more and more attention. The phosphides of Mo also exhibit very good catalytic properties in many fields. Shen et al. successfully synthesized a MoP nanoflake array on Ni foam via a facile two-step process. As shown in Fig. 5a, they used Ni foam as the reductant and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O as the Mo source directly to fabricate the Mo precursor by a hydrothermal method. In the preparation process, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) plays a very important role in regulating the structure.74 Compared to the nanoflake array structure, the MoP nanoparticle structure is more common. Li et al. presented a strategy to fabricate ultrafine MoP nanoparticles via a simple solid–state reaction as shown in Fig. 5b. They mixed (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, glucose, urea and H3PO4 into a homogeneous solution, and after the solution was dried it was calcined directly at a high temperature to prepare the target product.75 Li et al. fabricated porous molybdenum phosphide nano-octahedrons. As shown in Fig. 5c, they first synthesized nano-octahedron UIO-66 as the initial MOF via a solvothermal reaction. Then they prepared MoO2/ZrO2@C with the UIO-66 MOF as the host and mixed with MoO3. After treatment with hydrofluoric acid, MoP@PC (MoP@Porous carbon) was obtained by a phosphide reaction ((NH4)2HPO4 as the phosphorus source). This research suggests a new way to synthesize MOF-based composites.76

In addition to these single transition metal phosphides, there are many other phosphides, such as WP,78 RuP,79 Zn3P2,80etc. These phosphides are currently getting more and more research attention in the field of energy conversion. Many of them have been fabricated and have many types of morphologies. We will not exemplify these phosphides one by one, instead we will make a summary in the following table.
2.2 Bimetallic phosphides
In addition to single transition metal phosphides, bimetallic phosphides currently occupy a very important position. Compared with single TMPs, many bimetallic phosphides are more prominent in the field of catalysis. Recently, varieties of bimetallic phosphides have been prepared by different methods. Some of these phosphides exhibit excellent catalytic performance that is comparable to those of precious metal-based catalysts. In this part, we will focus on the preparation of some excellent phosphides and their special morphologies.
Hu et al. fabricated a novel bimetallic-structured NiCo2Px electrocatalyst via a facile strategy. As shown in Fig. 6a, they first synthesized NiCo2O4 nanowires as the precursor on carbon felt by a hydrothermal method and calcination treatment. After the phosphating reaction, NiCo2Px was prepared while retaining the original nanowire morphology.81 Liu et al. also prepared oxygen-doped porous NiCoP nanowire arrays by a similar method. But the specific method is still slightly different, and they also added ammonium fluoride during the preparation of the precursor. At the same time, during the phosphating reaction, the atmosphere they used was a mixture of hydrogen and argon. The catalytic performance of these oxygen-doped porous NiCoP nanowire arrays has been further improved.82 Luo et al. fabricated an interesting nest-like NiCoP structure. This nested structure is composed of NiCoP nanowires as shown in Fig. 6b. They fabricated nest-like NiCo2O4/CC precursors with the carbon cloth that was used as a substrate using similar materials and synthetic methods. Finally, the nest-like NiCoP was obtained by a phosphating treatment.83 Other than the nanowire morphology, NiCoP can also be fabricated into other structures. Yu et al. reported a novel way to prepare mixed-transition-metal (MTM)-based electrocatalysts. As shown in Fig. 6c, they first synthesized a NiCo(OH)x/rGO hybrid intermediate via a reflux method. Then NCO (Ni–Co–O) holey nanosheets were fabricated by annealing the hybrid intermediate. Finally, the target product was prepared by a common solid–gas phosphating reaction.84 Chai et al. presented another structure of NiCoP. They prepared a nanocage structure of NiCoP by a template method as shown in Fig. 6d. The Cu2O cubes were used as templates which were prepared under mild conditions. Then they fabricated Ni0.6Co1.4(OH)2 nanocages by adding sodium hyposulfite to convert Cu2O to Ni3Co7(OH)x according to Pearson's HSAB (hard and soft acid–base) principle. The final phosphating reaction used a typical solid–gas reaction. This study illustrates a new strategy to fabricate phosphides with different structures via a similar template method.85 At present, NiCoP has been prepared with other structures (Table 2).

As mentioned before, Fe is also an element often found in catalytic materials. Catalytic materials composed of Fe and many other transition metal elements exhibit excellent catalytic performance. Sun et al. reported a simple way to synthesize Co–Fe–P bimetallic phosphides. They used Fe(acac)3 and Co(acac)2 as the iron source and cobalt source respectively. The Co–Fe–O nanocubes were prepared by a high temperature oil bath reaction. Co–Fe–P nanoparticles with different Co:Fe:O ratios can be prepared by controlling the components of the added materials. Different from the previous phosphating reactions, they used an organophosphorus compound, triphenylphosphine (TOP), as a phosphorus source to prepare Co–Fe–P. They synthesized Co–Fe–O nanoparticles as a precursor and fabricated different nanostructured Co–Fe–P via an oil bath reaction. The prepared phosphide structure is related to the ratio of Co, Fe, and O in the precursor. Through this organic phosphating reaction, they fabricated (Co0.47Fe0.53)2P nanorods and (Co0.54Fe0.46)2P sea-urchins.87 Zhao et al. used a different method to prepare Co0.4Fe0.28P nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 7a, CoFe-based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe-PBA) were applied as framework structures to prepare phosphides. The CoFe-PBA precursors were fabricated via a facile chemical precipitation method. Then the Co0.4Fe0.28P nanocubes can be obtained through a typical phosphating process. This method is also suitable for the preparation of other bimetallic phosphides.88 Chen et al. used a novel method to fabricate a highly active nanoporous (Co1−xFex)2P alloy catalytic material. As shown in Fig. 7b, they first prepared Co–Fe–P ribbons as a precursor via melting Co2P, pure Co and pure Fe under an argon atmosphere. Then, the nanoporous (Co1−xFex)2P catalysts were prepared by electrochemical etching in an acidic solution. The Co:Fe:P atomic ratios were designed in a wide composition range to fabricate np-(Co1−xFex)2P. This method provides a new approach for fabricating nanoporous bimetallic phosphides with controlled composition.89 Zhu et al. reported another approach for synthesizing a bimetallic phosphide, hollow Fe–Co–P. As shown in Fig. 7c, they first prepared a Fe–Co metal–organic complex (MOC) by a hydrothermal method. The Fe–Co MOC was formed by a self-assembly process. Then the metal (Fe/Co) oxides were formed by an annealing treatment. The final Fe–Co–P was obtained by a typical solid-phase phosphating reaction.90 Wu et al. prepared another morphology of Co–Fe–P, amorphous Co–Fe–P nanospheres. They utilized cobalt acetate and iron acetylacetonate as the iron source and cobalt source, respectively. Red phosphorus and trioctylphosphine oxide were employed as the phosphorus source. Co0.63Fe0.21P0.16 nanospheres were fabricated via a facile solvothermal method. They prepared a series of phosphides through a similar approach.91

Similar to CoFe-based phosphides, NiFe-based bimetallic phosphides are also a kind of catalytic material which has been widely studied. Researchers have prepared NiFe-based phosphides with various structures via different approaches. Chen et al. reported a method to prepare hierarchically structured 3D integrated NiFe-based nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 8a, the NiFeOx nanosheets were first fabricated via a facile spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. They immersed the 3D iron foam, which acted both as a substrate and a reactive material, in a solution containing Ni(II) cations to prepare NiFeOx nanosheets. The NiFeOx can be used as a precursor, and NiFe–P can be obtained after the phosphating reaction. They used this method to prepare not only NiFeO, but also CoFeOx nanosheets. This study demonstrates a novel simple way to prepare bimetallic phosphides.93 Hu et al. used a more common approach to prepare bimetallic (FexNi1−x)2P nanoarrays. They first prepared the FeNi-precursor by typical hydrothermal methods. Briefly, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were employed as the nickel source and iron source, mixed with NH4F and urea. Then the FeNi based nanosheets could be prepared under mild reaction conditions. The (FexNi1−x)2P nanosheet arrays were obtained after the typical phosphating treatment. This method can be used to fabricate nanosheet structures with uniform morphology.94 Hu et al. prepared hierarchical FeNiP@ultrathin carbon nanoflakes (FeNiP@C) via the same method. Fig. 8b exhibits the fabrication process of FeNiP@C. The difference is that they mixed the FeNiP and glucose solutions together to prepare carbon coated FeNiP nanosheets by conventional hydrothermal methods.95 In addition to this nanosheet structure, Wang et al. fabricated porous structured Ni–Fe–P nanocubes. As shown in Fig. 8c, they first synthesized the Ni–Fe Prussian blue analogue as a precursor via the same coprecipitation method as the previous preparation of CoFe nanocubes. Then the Ni–Fe–P nanocubes were prepared through the same phosphating process.96 Jiang et al. reported a different structured Fe–Ni–P, porphyrinic metal–organic framework-templated Fe–Ni–P/rGO-T composite. Fig. 8d displays the preparation process of the Fe–Ni–P/rGO-T composite. The Ni-TCPP (tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) ligand was synthesized as the metal frame via a reported procedure. Briefly, they first refluxed the solution of methyl p-formylbenzoate and pyrrole. The precipitate and NiCl2·6H2O were dissolved in dimethylformamide, followed by a reflux process. The obtained crimson crystals were mixed with tetrahydrofuran and methanol. The Ni-TCPP was fabricated after the KOH and HCl treatment. This method can also be used to prepare Fe-TCPP. Then they used Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Na(OOCCH3)·3H2O to prepare [Fe3O-(OOCCH3)6OH]·2H2O. They synthesized PCN-600-Ni/GO with the obtained Ni-TCPP and [Fe3O-(OOCCH3)6OH]·2H2O in a solution of dimethylformamide and trifluoroacetic acid by a heating and drying process. After the high temperature carbonization reaction to obtain Fe–Ni–O, the Fe–Ni–P was fabricated after a typical phosphating reaction.97 Simon Ng et al. fabricated a 3D porous hierarchical NiFe–P catalyst via a facile one-step electrodeposition route. They used cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the electrodeposition process. This method is relatively simple and has been used widely recently.98

Molybdenum-related bimetallic phosphides have also shown excellent catalytic performance in recent years. Researchers have recently fabricated a number of materials related to molybdenum-related bimetallic phosphides through different approaches. Li et al. reported a new CoMoP@C (cobalt molybdenum phosphide nanocrystal with a few-layer N-doped carbon shell) electrocatalyst with highly efficient catalytic activity that is superior to that of Pt/C. They used a phosphorus-rich polyoxometalate, [Co(H2O)6]{[C3H4N2]2[C5NH5]14[H15(Mo2O4)8Co16(PO4)14(HPO3)10(OH)3]}5H2O (Co16Mo16P24), as a new precursor. As shown in Fig. 9a, the CoMoP@C was prepared by one-step pyrolysis of Co16Mo16P24 and dicyandiamide. The pyrolysis process was divided into two parts: 500 °C for 30 min and 800 °C for 6 h. The final CoMoP nanocrystal coated with a few-layer N-doped carbon shell was obtained after hydrochloric acid treatment. This research may provide new options for the design and fabrication of promising transition metal phosphides.99 Huang et al. prepared another morphological CoMoP material. As shown in Fig. 9b, the CoMoP nanosheets on nickel foam (CoMoP NSs@NF) were fabricated via a facile two-step process. They first employed CoCl2·6H2O and MoCl5 as the cobalt source and molybdenum source respectively to synthesize Co5MoxO nanosheets by a typical hydrothermal method. Similar to CoMoP, NiMo-related phosphides have also been prepared.100 Su et al. fabricated self-supported NiMoP2 nanowires on carbon cloth. Fig. 9c shows the fabrication processes of NiMoP2 nanowires on carbon cloth. NiMoO4 nanowires on carbon cloth were synthesized as a precursor. In a typical synthesis process, they used Na2MoO4 and Ni(NO3)2 as a nickel source and molybdenum source. The mixed solution was subjected to a hydrothermal reaction after annealing four times, and then the obtained sample was annealed again. The NiMoO4 nanowires can be successfully prepared after the phosphating process.101

At present, in addition to these common bimetallic phosphides, some other phosphides have also been prepared, for example, CoMnP nanoparticles,102 NiCu–P,103 PtAuP alloy,104etc. The summary of the related work is listed in Table 2.
2.3 Element-doped phosphides
In TMPs, the catalytic performance of the material can be improved by doping with other elements as a common approach at present. Many researchers have reported phosphides doped with metallic (Fe, Mn, Co, etc.) or non-metallic (O, S, N, etc.) elements. We will briefly introduce the latest developments in this type of phosphide, including preparation methods and morphologies, in this section (Table 3).

Iron is a commonly used doping element, which can significantly improve the catalytic performance of materials. Fe is also added to many phosphides to further enhance performance. Hu et al. fabricated Fe-doped CoP hollow triangle plate arrays (Fe–CoP HTPAs) with unique mesoporous shells. As shown in Fig. 10a, they first synthesized a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) by a facile post-synthetic ligand exchange reaction. Then the obtained ZIF-67 TPAs was immersed in the K4[Fe(CN)6] aqueous solution to prepare mesoporous CoFe(II)–PBA (Prussian blue analogue) HTPAs. The Fe–CoP HTPAs were successfully fabricated with a typical phosphating treatment.105 Sun et al. fabricated Fe-doped CoP nanowires via a facile approach. They first prepared Fe–Co-hydroxide nanowire arrays by a common hydrothermal method. Then the Fe-doped CoP nanowires were obtained through a simple phosphating reaction.106 They also prepared Fe-doped CoP nanosheet arrays by a similar method. The only difference is that the materials used in the hydrothermal process are different; they used hexamethylenetetramine instead of NH4F and urea.107 Sun et al. also prepared Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays via the same method as shown in Fig. 10b. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)2·9H2O were employed as the nickel source and iron source mixed with Co(NH2)2 to synthesize the NiFe precursor by hydrothermal treatment. The Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays were obtained after the phosphating reaction.108 Mu et al. fabricated Fe-doped NiP in a similar way except for replacing Fe2+ with Fe3+.109

Among the transition metal elements, Mn can also be used for doping to improve the performance of phosphides. Chen et al. fabricated Mn-doped NiP2 nanosheets by the same method as in Fig. 10c. There were some differences in the phosphating process. For example, the phosphorus source they used was red phosphorus instead of the commonly used sodium hypophosphite. The phosphating temperature was also relatively high.110 Sun et al. also prepared the same structure of Mn-doped Ni2P nanosheet arrays through a similar method.111
Apart from Fe, doping with molybdenum can also improve the electrochemical properties of the material. Wang et al. fabricated hollow Mo-doped CoP (Mo–CoP) nanoarrays. They first mixed 2-methylimidazole and Co(NO3)2·6H2O to prepare the cobalt-based MOF nanowall arrays as shown in Fig. 10d. Then Mo–Co layered double hydroxide (Mo–Co LDH) arrays were prepared through a hydrothermal reaction of Co-MOF/CC and Na2MoO4 in the solution of ethanol/water. The final hollow Mo–CoP arrays were prepared via the typical phosphating reaction.112
In addition to doping metal elements in phosphides, the doping of some non-metallic elements can also improve the properties of the materials while also making the materials cost-effective. For example, the doping of chalcogen elements can improve the catalytic performance of the materials. By modifying the synthesis method of previous NiCo2Px, Liu et al. prepared an oxygen-doped NiCoP. An oxygen doping free NiCoP nanowire sample was fabricated through intensifying the phosphating extent in a H2 atmosphere.82 Wang et al. reported an efficient sulfurization strategy to fabricate sulfur-doped CoP nanotube arrays. As shown in Fig. 10e, Co–OH precursors were first synthesized by a common hydrothermal reaction. Then they used the Co–OH precursors to prepare CoP/CC by direct phosphating. The final Co(P,S)/CC was prepared via a sulfurization process similar to phosphating.115 Nitrogen doping can also improve the performance of catalytic materials. Zhang et al. presented an N-doped CoP electrocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 10f, they first prepared Co(OH)F as a precursor through a common hydrothermal method. The CC@N–CoP was fabricated via a phosphating reaction under an Ar/NH3 atmosphere.118
3 Applications of phosphides in energy conversion
Phosphides have a very wide range of applications, and many phosphides exhibit impressive electrochemical performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrodeoxygenation, oxygen reduction reaction, etc. In this section, we will give a brief introduction to the latest developments of transition metal phosphides in the direction of energy conversion.
3.1 Hydrodeoxygenation
Fossil fuels are still the main source of energy worldwide, but the high dependence on this single form of energy is not a long-term solution for the sustainable development of mankind. Thus, researchers from all over the world have been focusing on the study of new energy to alleviate the current severe energy problems. Under this condition, researchers found that bio-oils, mainly produced from the liquefaction or pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, with the advantages of the wide range and ready availability of raw materials have been regarded as promising alternative sources of fuels. Although, compared with conventional fuels, bio-oils have limitations. The greatest limitation is a much higher oxygen content (45–50 wt%).119 This will lead to many undesired properties like low heating value, low thermostability, high viscosity, and poor miscibility with other petroleum components. To reduce oxygen content is an indispensable part to make the conversion of bio-oils to fuels possible. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) plays a very important role in the process to upgrade pyrolysis bio-oils to produce suitable biofuels or blends to be added into existing fuels.120
The conversion of oxygenated groups in bio-fuels to upgrade these oils aims to improve their properties including increasing their thermal and chemical stability, heating value, and volatility. The total or partial removal of oxygenates from pyrolysis liquids is mainly performed by HDO (eqn (1)). The idealized stoichiometric equation is as follows: C6H8O4 + 7H2 → C6H14 + 4H2O (HDO)(1)
Although H2 consumption is needed in the HDO of pyrolysis oils, the high heat value of the product and non-emission of waste gas still make its practical application meaningful. To improve the efficiency, the HDO reaction is usually performed at high temperatures and high pressures in the presence of a catalyst. As we can see in the equation above, water will be generated during the HDO reaction, which coupled with the water present in the pyrolysis oil may cause an adverse effect on the lifetime of the catalyst. Even worse, many compounds produced in the thermal degradation of lignin, like guaiacol (GUA, 2-methoxyphenol) and substituted guaiacols, tend to form heavy hydrocarbons and coke which will reduce the activity of the catalyst and even make it poisoned. Thus, the focus of recent research remains to be finding efficient and steady catalysts.121
In modern refineries, the industrial hydrotreating catalysts are mainly based on molybdenum or tungsten sulfides, like NiMoS, CoMoS, etc. which also show great activity in removing oxygenated groups from bio-oils.122,123 Although sulfide catalysts show pretty high selectivity and activity in HDO of bio-oils, because of the loss of sulfur in the catalytic process, these metal sulfide catalysts will suffer from progressive deactivation, and finally become inactive, and besides, the lost sulfur species will contaminate the cleaned products.124 Noble metal catalysts, as the most satisfactory choice, can almost avoid all the problems above while still exhibiting high activity, but the expensive prices dramatically limit their large-scale commercial applications. In recent decades, non-noble metal catalysts have been well studied, and non-noble metal phosphide catalysts with the advantages of acceptable catalytic activity and cost effectiveness, provide new aspiration for the studies of potential bio-oil HDO catalysts.
Among numerous potential HDO catalysts, easily prepared Ni- or Co-based phosphide catalysts with impressive catalytic activity have attracted many researchers' attention. Xu et al., using activated carbon (AC) as the support, successfully synthesized nickel phosphide and cobalt phosphide catalysts with different metal/P molar ratios. Their study focused on the effect of different phosphorus content on the catalytic activity, and the result showed that the catalyst at a M/P molar ratio of about 3/2 shows the best performance (Fig. 11a and b).125

Reproduced with permission from ref. 126, copyright 2016, Elsevier Ltd. 
Chen et al., utilizing the excellent water resistance and hydrophobic properties of the TiO2 shell in HDO, successfully prepared a highly active Ni2P catalyst supported on core–shell structured Al2O3@TiO2 (Ni2P/A@T) for HDO of benzofuran (BF), and studied the catalyst's properties. They found that, with the incorporation of the TiO2 shell, the catalyst was modified a lot, including the increase of catalytic specific surface area, water resistance, HDO stability and selectivity to O-free products, which intensively exhibits the great catalytic performance of Ni2P. The result shows the highest HDO activity of 95% with an O-free product yield of 87% (Fig. 11c and d).126
Lercher et al. studied the catalytic performance of an unsupported Ni2P in the aqueous phase HDO of phenol. They found that the unsupported Ni2P was not stable and very sensitive to water. Firstly, it will be transformed to an amorphous phase and then to Ni5P2 and Ni12P5, and finally to Ni3P in the presence of water at high temperatures. The Ni3P phase, the final product, exhibited extraordinary hydrogenation activity at low temperatures and high HDO activity at high temperatures and it even performed better than Pd/SiO2 (1.0 wt%) in the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring in the phenol molecule (Fig. 12a and b). The result shows that the unsupported Ni3P was more catalytically active and stable for phenol HDO in both the aqueous phase and the organic phase than Ni2P. In addition to phenol, they also investigated the activity of unsupported Ni3P in catechol and o-cresol HDO in both aqueous solution and decalin solution and found that the reactivity of phenols decreased in the order: phenol > catechol > o-cresol in the aqueous, and in decalin solvent, phenol was also much more active than o-cresol on the unsupported Ni3P.127

Song et al. reported an Al-doped Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 catalyst with high activity toward HDO of benzofuran (BF). The result indicates that the original catalyst Ni2P was modified a lot by the incorporation of Al into the SBA-15 support, which promoted the formation of much uniform, smaller, highly dispersed Ni2P particles on the catalyst, and enhanced its acid strength and besides, the Al can also help to inhibit the enrichment of P and promote more exposed Ni sites on the surface. The total deoxygenated product yield over Ni2P/Al-SBA-15 reached 90.3% (Fig. 12c and d).128
For HDO, the most widely used phosphide catalysts are nickel-based phosphides, such as Ni2P, Ni3P, etc. These nickel-based phosphides exhibited extraordinary hydrogenation activity at low temperatures and high HDO activity at high temperatures. Moreover, these nickel-based phosphides also have excellent stability. Although some other phosphides also have been used as catalysts for HDO, such as FexMo2−xP129 and CoMoP,130 research on other types of phosphides for HDO is still rare.
3.2 Photocatalysis
Energy crisis has become a worldwide issue as the consumption of fossil fuels, as well as a series of consequential environmental problems. Hydrogen, a promising energy carrier with little pollution, has attracted a lot of attention in human society. Besides electrochemical hydrogen production by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the solar driven generation of hydrogen (or artificial photosynthesis hydrogen) is another environmentally friendly way that deserves research.131,132 Generally, there are three main types of artificial photosynthesis system. Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs), as one of the most promising and environmental technologies for clean energy, are the firstly studied system.133 In principle, PECs are made up of two sides: an n-type semiconductor as the photo-anode and a p-type semiconductor as the photo-cathode. Under light irradiation, the electrons and holes are generated in the semiconductor photoelectrode. The electrons on the surface of the cathode can reduce protons to hydrogen, while the holes on the photoanode surface oxidizes water to oxygen.134 However, a power supply is needed to provide a large external bias, which leads to unnecessary energy consumption. In order to overcome this shortcoming, semiconductor powder systems have been proposed, which generate photovoltage by itself to build the “micro-PEC” system. The typical “micro-PEC” involves three steps: (1) generation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs under light irradiation in the bulk, (2) migration of the photoexcited electrons and holes to the surface of the “micro-PEC” without recombination, and (3) reactions towards hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. In theory, the process of water splitting involves an energy barrier presented in the forms of Gibbs energy (ΔG0 = 237.13 kJ mol−1), equaling 1.23 eV photon energy. However, the photon energy to drive the water splitting reaction is usually larger than the bandgap of the semiconductor because of the existence of an activation barrier in the charge transfer process between the photocatalyst and H2O molecules.135 Besides, the backward reaction of the formation of H2O from H2 and O2 has also diminished the catalytic efficiency. As a more advanced device, the Z-scheme water splitting system, inspired by natural proceeds in green plants, has been developed during the last two years.136 A Z-scheme type photocatalyst is a kind of system imitating the natural photosynthesis process. With the help of shuttle redox mediators (electron shuttles, often working as ionic type redox pairs, conductor-like metal nanoparticles or reduced graphene oxide), the excited electron of photosystem I is transferred to photosystem II to combine with the hole. And the left hole and excited electron in photosystems I and II can be used for reduction–oxidation reactions. Therefore, the Z-scheme system possesses superiority in this respect. Besides, the Z-scheme system can not only separate the excited electrons and holes, but also retain stronger redox ability, which is more beneficial to involve in related reactions.137 Unlike semiconductor powder systems, except for the two half reactions hydrogen reduction and oxygen oxidation, there is an appropriate shuttle redox mediator that could avoid the backward reactions. However, the obstacles of the Z-scheme are also the backward reactions, which are the reduction and oxidation of redox couples on the hydrogen photocatalyst and oxygen photocatalyst, respectively.138 In addition, complicated interfacial situations like a low transfer rate of carriers would result in energy loss. Consequently, the efficiency of the artificial Z-scheme system is far below the theoretical value.139 Therefore, photon utilization is not as high as the other two systems, and the selection of the oxidation–reduction reaction is limited. All these problems restrict its improvement of water splitting activity. Generally, co-catalysts are usually utilized to enhance the abilities of hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The most common strategy is to employ co-catalysts on the surface of semiconductors, particularly for hydrogen reduction sites. The improvement of hydrogen evolution by HER co-catalysts would be higher than that of oxygen evolution by OER co-catalysts.140
Recently, noble metals such as Pt and their metal-based catalysts remain the benchmark HER photocatalysts, but the fatal weakness of noble metals themselves limits their scalable application, such as the side reaction of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) because of the lower Fermi level and good electron trapping abilities and the limited reserves.141 Thus, alternative co-catalysts based on non-precious metals and metal-free materials are necessary for the investigation of suitable catalysts. In the overall photocatalytic water splitting system, non-Pt metals or metal oxides are always employed in the co-catalysts for HER sites, as well as in the non-cocatalyst photo harvesters.
The photoreduction deposition method is an efficient strategy for the preparation of a stable, environment-friendly and robust HER co-catalyst. Recently, many non-noble metal photocatalysts prepared by the photoreduction deposition method have been reported. Among them, transition metal phosphides exhibit a superior catalytic activity. Since 2014, transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) phosphides have been proposed as co-catalysts with CdS or g-C3N4 for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and their performance were good. These all studies indicate that transition metal phosphides possess promising applications as photocatalytic HER cocatalysts.
Tang et al. fabricated NixP as a highly efficient cocatalyst with g-C3N4. As shown in Fig. 13a and b, the NixP/g-C3N4 composite exhibits excellent performance for hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, the NixP/g-C3N4 composite demonstrated excellent acid-stable photocatalytic activity because of the intrinsic acid-resistant properties of NixP and g-C3N4.142

Li et al. fabricated bifunctional g-C3N4 nanosheets–Cu3P nanoheterojunctions by the grinding method. Both the Cu3P cocatalyst and semiconductor could evidently boost visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2 production over graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets. The heterojunction effects between p-type Cu3P and n-type g-C3N4 are speculated to play a more prominent role in dramatically boosting photocatalytic H2 production than the electron-sink roles of surface Cu3P cocatalysts (Fig. 13c and d). What's more, it was further proved that the earth-abundant dual-functional Cu3P nanoparticles could substantially facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs and accelerate H2-evolution kinetics, thus achieving distinctly boosted photocatalytic H2 generation.143
Kumar et al. prepared CoP nanowires (CoP NWs) through an organic solvent-free low-temperature phosphidation reaction as a highly efficient co-catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen production. After rational integration with the Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution semiconductor, metallic 1D CoP NWs exhibited an improved photocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution, which was 22 times higher than that of the pristine Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The superior activity originated from the synergetic effects between the excellent metallic conductivity and the rigid 1D nanostructure of CoP NWs (Fig. 14a and b). Moreover, investigations of the mechanism demonstrate that the excellent activity benefited from the strong electronic coupling, favorable band structure, and highly efficient charge separation and migration.144

Xie et al. synthesized NiCoP/g-C3N4 by a simple one-pot method. The g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by directly heating melamine. NiCoP/g-C3N4 exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate, which is 21 times higher than that of bare g-C3N4 (Fig. 14c and d). The excellent performance is due to a combination of improved separation efficiency and effective charge transfer efficiency. This study provides a strategy for the synthesis of bimetallic phosphides as cocatalysts.146
For photocatalysis, single transition metal phosphides are a kind of co-catalyst with more research attention paid compared with bimetallic phosphides and element-doped phosphides. Among the transition metal phosphides, the catalytic activity of Co based and Ni based phosphides is more prominent. Moreover, bimetallic phosphides and element-doped phosphides as co-catalysts can also significantly enhance the catalytic activity of the system. However, studies on bimetallic phosphides and element-doped phosphides as co-catalysts are still rare, and their catalytic activity needs to be further improved (Table 4).

3.3 Hydrogen evolution reaction
With the development of human society and the surge of global population, people's demand for energy is growing dramatically. The uncontrolled exploitation and use of fossil fuels is intensifying global warming and accelerating the energy crisis. Under this condition, studies to find a new alternative energy have become urgent. Hydrogen, having many advantages like the highest gravimetric energy density, environmental friendliness, and a wide range of resources, is the most ideal candidate for alternative energy.149 The HER, namely the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction from the electrolysis of water, is the main approach to produce H2. Currently, the most efficient catalyst for the HER in alkaline media is Pt, but its scarcity and whopping price make its practical use on a large scale impossible, and thus, finding an efficient and easily obtainable catalyst for the HER is the focus of research.
The overall process of water electrolysis has two half reactions: HER (2H+(aq) + 2e− → H2(g)) on cathodes, and OER (2H2O(l) → 4e− + 4H+(aq) + O2(g)) on anodes.150 There are generally two steps for the HER in acidic media, the first is the absorption of H+(aq), and the other is the desorption of hydrogen from the catalyst.151
The first step is a discharge process, namely a Volmer reaction. In this step, H+ in the electrolyte is transformed into an intermediate state on the active site of the catalyst by capturing an electron:H+(aq) + e− + Cat ↔ Hads (Volmer reaction);
From the first step, it is observed that different catalysts with various absorption ability toward H+ will cause the Hads coverage on that catalyst to be low or high, which will lead to two different mechanisms for hydrogen generation. Therefore, the second step can be done in two different ways.
When Hads coverage on the surface of this catalyst is low, the Hads tends to combine with another electron and proton on the original active site to form H2 and then desorb from that site, which is named a Heyrovsky reaction:Hads + H+(aq) + e− ↔ H2(g) (Heyrovsky reaction);
When combined with high Hads coverage, the Hads on different active sites is inclined to couple with each other to evolve H2, which is called a Tafel reaction:Hads + Hads ↔ H2(g) (Tafel reaction);
From the reactions above, the overall process could be described thermodynamically as the repeated adsorption and desorption of Hads from active sites. Depending on the Sabatier principle, a good HER catalyst should be able to combine with Hads easily to form a strong bond but the bond should also be weak enough for improving the process of hydrogen generation.152,153 There is no way to directly measure the values of the surface-intermediate bonding energy, and therefore the quantitative relationship between the energetics of the Hads intermediate and the HER electrochemical reaction rate is difficult to determine. From the aspect of physical chemistry, Gibbs free energy (ΔGHads) can be used to evaluate both Hads adsorption and H2 desorption, which can be obtained through DFT on certain lattice planes of catalysts:ΔGHads = ΔEZPE + ΔEHads − TΔSHwhere ΔEZPE is the difference of the zero-point energy between the adsorbed H (Hads) and isolated H, ΔEHads is the differential hydrogen chemisorption energy, T is the temperature, and ΔSH is the entropy changes between the process of adsorption and desorption of H. According to Sabatier's principle, a catalyst with ΔGHads = 0 is the most ideal one, under which condition the overall reaction has the maximum rate.154 And the reaction rate could be evaluated by HER exchange current density (j0), and thus Nørskov et al. studied the HER performance of a series of metal materials, and introduced a “volcano plot” which revealed the hierarchical kinetics among metals and the close correlation between exchange current density (j0) and the free energy change for Hads adsorption ΔGHads.155
In typical and well-known volcano plots, nearly thermoneutral Pt in the middle is the most efficient catalyst for the HER, while Au and Ag located in the bottom-right are poor catalysts. The reason is that Au and Ag metals could hardly form a strong bond with Hads, making the ad/desorption process impossible. However, because of the whopping price and scarcity, it is impracticable for Pt to be used as a HER catalyst on a large scale. Thus, the development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts is the emphasis of research. Over past years, a series of transition metal selenides,156 chalcogenides,157 borides,158 nitrides,159 carbides,160 and phosphides161 as the potential candidates for catalyzing the HER have been well studied.
Among these noble metal-free catalysts, TMPs show great advantages. Firstly, phosphorus, as one of the most earth-abundant non-metallic elements, is low cost and easy to obtain; secondly, compared with other transition metal-non-metal materials, TMPs are much easier to synthesize; thirdly, and most importantly, the moderate bonding strength to hydrogen by the P ligand (namely “ensemble effect”) in phosphides plays a significant role in generating molecular H2 and reducing the H-poisoning effect.162
Zhiwei Fang et al., using graphene oxide as the removable template, successfully synthesized a holey Ni/Co-based phosphide material. It shows great HER performance in alkaline media, with a very low onset overpotential toward nearly zero, reaching 58 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2, and exhibiting long-term durability as well. Besides, the material also performs well in acid and neutral solutions. The electrical conductivity measurements, coupled with DFT calculations on that material, reveal that the substitution of phosphide can modulate the electron configuration, lower the hydrogen adsorption energy, and facilitate the desorption of hydrogen on the active sites in Ni–Co–P (NCP) holey nanostructures, resulting in superior HER catalytic activity, which can also be shown via comparing the HER performances of different NCA (A = O, P, S) catalysts (Fig. 15a).163

Based on the principle that enhancing interfacial interactions by rationally designing multicomponent material structures can improve electrocatalysis, Xiaolin Li and his co-workers reported a novel metal-phosphide with core–shell nanostructures as an efficient HER catalyst. They successfully synthesized iron–iron phosphide (Fe@FeP) core–shell nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which exhibit satisfactory catalytic performance with only 53–110 mV overpotentials to reach current densities of 10–100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 15b). And the hydrogen adsorption energy (Eads) obtained by DFT calculations shows that the Eads on Fe@FeP is almost identical to that on Pt(111) which reveals the positive effect of the Fe@FeP core–shell structure.164
Ali Han et al. synthesized novel ternary metal phosphide nanosheets on nickel foam as the cathode for the HER, which combine the advantages of both one-dimensional nanowires and two-dimensional nanosheet materials. They show exceptional catalytic activity in a wide pH range from 0–14, requiring quite low overpotentials of only 60 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 (Fig. 15c), 120 mV in 1.0 M KPi, and 155 mV in 1.0 M KOH to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2.165
Aiming at designing an efficient HER catalyst for commercial water electrolysis, Ishwar Kumar Mishra et al. used earth-abundant resources of Co, Ni and P to synthesize a sandwich-like structure with hierarchical CoP nanoparticles as thin skins covering both sides of Ni5P4 nanosheet arrays, forming a CoP/Ni5P4/CoP sandwich-like structure with lots of mesopores and macropores (Fig. 15d). This electrocatalyst is very active under both acidic and alkaline conditions, with overpotentials of only 33 mV and 71 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M NaOH solution, respectively, smoothing a new way for the design of robust non-noble electrocatalysts to enhance hydrogen production.166
Rui Zhang et al. first synthesized NiCo2Ox bimetallic oxide nanowires on carbon felt, and then transformed them into NiCo2Px without changing their morphology. They show great performance under multi-pH conditions, with overpotentials of 58 mV, 63 mV and 104 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under alkaline, acidic and neutral conditions, respectively (Fig. 16a). And their low Tafel slope and excellent long-term stability under all pH conditions indicate their promising future.81

Xing Zhang and co-workers reported a new design strategy to construct well-defined MoP nanostructures with a high density of active sites and excellent catalytic activity. They successfully synthesized a MoP/CNTs hybrid with nano-sized and well-crystallized MoP nanoparticles decorated on each side wall of the porous CNTs. The electrocatalyst shows impressive HER activity in a wide scale of pH electrolytes, with overpotentials only 83, 102, and 86 mV to reach a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS, and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively (Fig. 16b). The catalyst also shows much better HER performance compared with MoOx/CNTs, MoS2/CNTs, and MoNx/CNTs, showing the great catalytic effect of phosphide introduction.167
Taek-Seung Kim et al. successfully synthesized a 3D flower-like CoxP/carbon (C–CoxP) structure (Fig. 16c) with silk fibroin acting as the CoxP nanosheet interconnector as well as the 3D architecture supporter and carbon source. The flower-like 3D structure combined with the carbon substrate exhibits impressive HER electrocatalytic activity with overpotentials as low as 109 and 121 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and Tafel slopes of 55 and 62 mV dec−1 under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The general reasons are that the mixture of carbon, on the one hand, ensures efficient charge transport; the catalyst surface, on the other hand, exposes much more active sites.168
For the HER, transition metal phosphides exhibit excellent catalytic performance. Compared with single transition metal phosphides, the catalytic performance of bimetallic phosphides, such as CoNiP, is usually more prominent. Moreover, doping with elements, including metallic and non-metallic elements, is also a very effective method to enhance the catalytic activity of the system (Table 5).

3.4 Methanol oxidation reaction
In the 21st century, with lithium ion batteries becoming more widely used, it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet the urgent demand due to its limited resource reserves and lack of convenience. Under this condition, fuel cells, holding the advantage of great adaptability concerning the electrolytes, electrodes, fuel types, membranes, and operating temperatures, have been regarded as promising candidates for dominant energy conversion devices in various future applications.
Comparing all the potential fuels that could be used in fuel cells as shown in Table 6,169 we could find that many fuels can be ignored for their low energy densities compared to that of hydrogen, and in terms of the energy density methanol is the second-best fuel just after hydrogen. Apart from that, methanol itself possesses many advantages that hydrogen can't match: (1) methanol has a wide range of resources and is much easier to obtain which means its low cost. (2) At room temperature, being a liquid it is safer and more convenient to store, transport and distribute. Thus, to use methanol directly in a fuel cell, namely Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), tremendously decreases the difficulty in designing an energy conversion system, paving the avenue for DMFCs in commercial large-scale applications.

There are two parts of the overall reaction in DMFCs: the oxidation of methanol in the anode chamber and reduction of oxygen on the cathode surface. The reaction processes differ in different media:
In acidic media:
The overall reaction: 2CH4O + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 4H2O
Anode: CH4O − 6e− + H2O → 6H+ + CO2
Cathode: O2 + 4e− + 4H+ → 2H2O
In alkaline media:
Overall reaction: 2CH4 + 3O2 + 4OH− → 2CO2−3 + 6H2O
Anode: CH4 − 6e− + 8OH− → CO2−3 + 6H2O
Cathode: O2 + 4e− + 2H2O → 4OH−
There are two main barriers tremendously hindering the further development of DMFCs, one is the expensive manufacturing prices, and the other is the slow electro-oxidation kinetics.170 The electrochemical oxidation of methanol on an anode surface will produce a variety of intermediate products like COHads, HCHOads, and COads which can lower the oxidation efficiency, and even worse, will bind on the active sites to prevent the subsequent oxidation of methanol, thus poisoning the anode catalysts. Most electrolytes are acidic because, in alkaline media, the anode reaction product, namely bicarbonate ions, will exist in solution, which is unfavorable for the reaction proceeding in a forward direction. However, the acidic media also have their drawbacks. We can see from the above equation that the overall reaction under acidic conditions involves a six-electron transfer which will produce lots of surface intermediates. Therefore, to exploit efficient catalyst materials to surmount these surface resistance problems, like the inhibition effect triggered by reaction intermediates on the electrode surface and the sluggish oxidation kinetics rate as well as to promote the complete oxidation of methanol into CO2 is the focus of this research. Pt is the best catalyst for electro-oxidation of methanol, but its whopping price and scarcity, and the fact that partial oxidation products of methanol will get the pure Pt catalyst poisoned, make its widespread use unrealistic.171 Over recent decades, electrode materials used as anodes for DMFCs, operating in acidic media have been well studied.172–174 Apart from materials based on Pt, other catalysts like multi-metal nanoparticles,175–177 materials based on metal oxide supports178–180 and conducting polymer catalyst supports,181–183 and catalysts with core–shell nanostructures184 and other architectures also displayed impressive activity and durability.
TMPs, with advantages of being easy to synthesize and earth-abundant resources, provide us a new alternative for efficient and stable methanol electro-oxidation reactions. Wei Xing's group has systematically studied the catalytic activity of TMPs and found that the modification of NiP would tremendously enhance the activity and durability of Pt or Pd based materials. In a report, Guoqiang Li et al. from Wei Xing's group first prepared Ni2P/C support hybrids with the solid-phase reaction method, and then deposited Pt and Pd (20% mass loading), respectively, to synthesize a Pt(Pd)–Ni2P/C structure. The researchers prepared Pt(Pd)–Ni2P/C samples with different loadings of Ni2P on carbon by changing the mass ratio of Ni2P and C. The result is that samples with 30% loading of Ni2P on carbon exhibit the best activity with a maximum power density of 21 mW cm−2 for Pt–Ni2P/C-30%, and 90 mW cm−2 for Pd–Ni2P/C-30%, with much better activity than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts (Fig. 17a and b), and both still perform well after 12 h discharge operation.185

Not just promoting the catalytic activity of such monometallic materials as Pt and Pb, the loading of Ni2P can also improve bimetallic supports. Jinfa Chang and his co-workers developed a PtRu–Ni2P/C material by loading Ni2P/C on the PtRu catalyst to remarkably reduce the usage of precious metals, Pt and Ru, thus improving catalytic performance, as well as cutting the cost. Both electrochemical measurements and practical fuel cell tests prove the excellent performance of this PtRu–Ni2P/C material, and the CV test results show that this material has a much higher peak current than commercial PtRu/C-JM and other homemade reference DMFC anode materials. In practical direct methanol fuel cell tests, the maximum energy density of this sample can reach 69.9 mW cm−2 at 30 °C (Fig. 17c and d) and it maintains highly stable discharge ability even after operating for 12 h.186
Another work reported by this author presented a CoP-promoted Pt anode catalyst for DMFCs, and his work shows CoP has a similar function to Ni2P. In this study, CoP acts as a support with nano-particular scale Pt loading on it, which comprehensively modifies the pure Pt anode and greatly reduces the manufacturing costs. The test results prove the impressive activity of this material, obtaining a highest power density of 88.5 m W cm−2 with just 1.2 mg cm−2 of Pt loading (Fig. 18a and b), which displays promising prospects.187

Jinliang Zhu and his co-workers developed a novel MoP nanocrystal material by an ion-exchange method and then anchored it on carbon to act as the Pt support. The strong synergistic effect between MoP and Pt endows the material, namely Pt–MoP/C, with excellent catalytic activity and stability. The strong electronic effect between MoP and Pt can reduce the chemisorption overpotential of methanol and the conductivity of MoP, the carbon network can boost electron transport, and MoP as a good water splitting catalyst can produce oxygen-containing species which would react with intermediate products of methanol oxidation to avoid catalyst poisoning. The result of the CV test exhibits its impressive performance with the highest pre-peak mass activity of 1860.7 mA mgPt−1, and long-term stability with a retention of 81.4% after 1000 cycles of chronoamperometry (CA) tests carried out in 0.6 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 1.0 M CH3OH solution (Fig. 18c and d).188
In the area of the MOR, phosphides are often used as alternative catalytic materials to some precious metals. The most commonly used phosphides are still cobalt-based and nickel-based single metal phosphides, such as CoP, Ni2P, etc. The electrochemical performance of these phosphides that are used as alternative catalytic materials is superior to those of commercial PtRu/C or Pt/C catalysts. However, there is still a lack of research on other phosphides, bimetallic phosphides and element-doped phosphides, as catalysts toward the MOR.
3.5 Oxygen reduction reaction
Due to the unacceptable long-term pollution and the inadequate supply of fossil fuels, there has been a great demand for sustainable and clean energy conversion and storage systems.189 Metal–air batteries, as one of the energy conversion and storage device catalogues, have drawn more and more attention for their high theoretical power and energy density.190 The one bottleneck restricting the development of metal–air batteries is the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the discharge process.191,192 Generally, there are two possible pathways accepted by the academic circle for the ORR in alkaline electrolytes as follows:193
(1) Direct four-electron pathway:O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−
(2) Peroxide (indirect) two-electron pathway:O2 + H2O + 2e− → OH− + HO−2and the following reduction step or decomposition step:HO−2 + H2O + 2e− → 3OH− or 2HO−2 → 2OH− + O2
Similar to other electrochemical reactions, the ORR at the cathode can be improved by some catalysts through accelerating the kinetics of the reaction and lowering the electric energy cost. At present, Pt and Pt-based materials still remain the most efficient catalysts to drive the ORR at the cathode despite its scarcity, high-cost and self-poisoning.194 For industrial and large-scale application, there is an urgent demand for developing appropriate electrocatalysts. Recently, a series of novel catalysts towards the ORR have been reported, such as heteroatom doped-carbon materials,195,196 carbon-based materials composited with metals,197,198 metal oxides,199 metal nitrides,200 alloys201 and so on with distinctive nanostructures. Among these catalysts, TMPs and their composites have gained growing interest due to their superior catalytic activity.202–217 The most famous paradigm among them is cobalt phosphide. It can be traced back to 2015 that cobalt phosphide (Co2P and CoP) was firstly used as a catalyst for the ORR and exhibited a comparable activity to conventional Pt catalysts. Furthermore, the Co2P nanorods were more stable for the ORR in alkaline environments.202,203 It was reported in the same period that the composite of Co2P nanoparticles and heteroatom-doped carbon materials possessed good ORR catalytic activity as well.204,205 Liu and co-workers put forward a strategy to synthesis a composite of heteroatom-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Co2P nanoparticles (NPs) as shown in Fig. 19a. Heteroatoms of O, N, P, S inheriting from the polymeric nanotubes (PNTs) were confined into CNTs and acted as active sites for the ORR process. The electronic interaction between Co2P NPs and CNTs could improve the ORR catalytic performance.205 Subsequently, there was a study reporting that Co2P-CoxN on N-rich carbon was used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the ORR and OER. The interfaces between the robust conjugated Co2P and CoxN could also elevate the performance. The integrated structure (Fig. 19b) of Co–P–N NPs and N-doped graphene (NG) boosted the electron transfer and resulted in excellent conductivity which could influence the catalytic activity.206

Inspired by these studies, research on cobalt phosphides and their composites with heteroatom-doped carbon for the ORR has been on a continuous rise.207–215 As demonstrated in Fig. 19c, with the solution-phase strategy, Geyer and co-workers synthesized highly monodisperse CoP and Co2P nanocrystals (NCs).207 Furthermore, the CoP NCs show a more decent catalytic activity towards the ORR with an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE, a higher diffusion-limiting current density of 4.64 mA cm−2 and a half-potential of 0.858 V vs. RHE. These activity performances were all close to those of commercial Pt/C. The average electron transfer number obtained from Koutechy–Levich plots was 3.89, indicating that the mechanism of the ORR on the CoP electrode was a direct four-electron pathway. In order to unveil the actual active sites of CoP and Co2P, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted. The results showed that the abundant P sites on the catalysts could reduce the reaction barrier of the OH* desorption step which is the rate-determining step in the overall ORR. In addition, the CoP nanosheets loaded on carbon cloth exhibited a stable ORR activity as well.208
On the other hand, cobalt phosphide composites with heteroatom-doped carbon were also hot catalysts for the ORR. For example, Li's group obtained a new type of hybrid of CoP and defective carbon (CoP-DC) by simple phosphorization of a Co2+-containing polymer hydrogel. The diagrammatic sketch of the structure of CoP-DC is displayed in Fig. 19d. Defective carbon sites were circled by dotted lines. From the results of work function (Φ) calculated by secondary electron cut-off (SECO) regions of ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS), it was found that the interfacial charge between CoP and DC is redistributed. The lower the Φ value was, the faster the rate of extracting electrons was. What's more, the DFT calculation results approved a differential charge density of CoP-DC hybrids. This would result in the migration of electrons from CoP to the DC layer due to the strong polarization effect. With the advantages of the interfacial charge redistribution, the catalyst possessed a superior catalytic activity towards the ORR. In 0.1 M KOH solution, CoP-DC showed an ultra-low half-wave potential of 0.81 V vs. RHE which was even lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.85 V vs. RHE). It was similar that the CoP-DC also followed a direct four-electron pathway.209 Another novel method for the synthesis of cobalt phosphides composited with heteroatom-doped carbon was transforming the metal organic framework (MOF) precursor to target products, which could effectively avoid self-aggregation.213,214 Besides, in addition to cobalt phosphides, bimetallic phosphides with heteroatom-doped carbon and the composites of iron phosphide and heteroatom-doped carbon were also efficient catalysts for enhancing the catalytic activity towards the ORR.216,217
In summary, many of the transition metal phosphides have exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the ORR. Among them, the catalytic activity of Co based phosphides is more prominent than those of other phosphides. The catalytic activity of these Co based phosphides can be comparable to that of Pt/C, and some even superior to precious metal-based catalysts. However, research on other phosphides, such as bimetallic phosphides and element-doped phosphides, as catalysts for the ORR is still rare.
In addition to these application directions, phosphides exhibit excellent catalytic activity in other fields of energy conversion. For example, as to electrocatalytic water splitting, phosphides not only have excellent HER catalytic performance, but also their OER performance is outstanding. Recently, there have been many reports on the application of phosphides as OER catalysts. Wang et al. synthesized thin Co2P nanosheets for the OER by using LiCl as a template.218 Kim et al. introduced electrodeposited nickel–copper–phosphorous (NiCuP) as an efficient OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium.219 Zou et al. presented a facile synthetic method that yields Ag@CoxP core–shell-type heterogeneous nanostructures with excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.220 Mu et al. adopted a facile solid–liquid-phase chemical method to yield hollow Ru-RuPx-CoxP polyhedra with remarkably high OER catalytic activity and stability.221 Li et al. fabricated oxygen-doped nickel iron phosphide nanocube arrays from PBAs on Ni foam with superior electrocatalytic performance and stability toward the OER.222
4 Conclusions
Recently, TMPs as cost-effective materials have shown excellent catalytic properties in many directions, such as the HER, ORR, MOR, etc. Some of these phosphides even show performance comparable to those of noble metal catalysts. Therefore, TMPs have attracted more and more researchers. In this article, we mainly introduced and summarized the recent progress of TMPs in the direction of energy conversion. We focused on the current common phosphides and introduced their synthesis methods and special morphologies. Some TMPs with outstanding performances in the direction of energy conversion have also been reviewed. Although a variety of phosphides have been prepared in recent years, these phosphides have already been widely used more in the energy conversion area. Though many related research results have been obtained, TMPs still have great development potential and application prospects. Herein, we will highlight some of the insights into their current challenges and future directions.
(1) Although many phosphides have been prepared, the main transition metals used are still Co, Fe, Ni, etc. To further improve the catalytic performance and development of TMPs, researchers could try to explore other TMPs to prepare phosphides, such as Cu, Mn, Zn, etc. This might be able to further enhance their catalytic performance and improve their practical performance.
(2) In the preparation of phosphides, the most commonly used method is still the gas–solid reaction. This method is relatively simple compared to many other phosphating procedures, such as high temperature organic phosphating. The source of phosphorus used is sodium hypophosphite. The reaction conditions required are also relatively mild. However, because of this, explorations to prepare new phosphides are limited. Although this method is relatively simple, there are also some drawbacks. The most obvious point is that the amount of phosphorus required for this process is large. In order to solve this problem, we can adopt different phosphating ideas, such as changing the form of the gas–solid reaction, or directly using a phosphorus-containing compound to prepare phosphides.
(3) Researchers have demonstrated that many phosphides have excellent catalytic properties through various test characterization methods. It is well known that the addition of phosphorus does improve their performance. Some tests and simulation calculations, such as EIS, ECSA, DFT, etc., have also been employed to explain their excellent electrochemical performance. However, in some systems, the mechanism of action of phosphorus atoms in the reaction cannot be fully explained. Moreover, there are still very few studies on how to use theory and calculations to predict which phosphides have excellent electrochemical performance. Putting more effort into the mechanism of action and simulation calculations will be very beneficial. This may help us to make a more efficient phosphide catalyst, while also saving more energy.
(4) As a variety of phosphides are prepared, they are also applied in some areas, such as HDO, HER, ORR, methanol oxidation, etc. Phosphides also show impressive catalytic performance in these areas. However, the applications of phosphides in the catalytic direction are not comprehensive. For example, some TMPs do exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the HER field, but this also prevents them from being used in other directions. In the HDO direction, the most widely used phosphide is still Ni2P. We should try to apply various kinds of phosphides in different fields and investigate their performance in different directions. This facilitates the rapid expansion of phosphides in the development of catalytic materials and catalytic applications.
(5) For TMPs, the P sites often play the role of spectators and moderate bonding providers for the products. Therefore, we can generally adjust the distribution density of metal and non-metal sites on the catalyst surface to moderate the desorption and adsorption capacity of protons and other involved ions, making the catalysts most efficient for various catalytic reactions. Moreover, the active site is also critical for the catalysts. It is also an important direction to improve the activity of the catalyst by increasing the number of active sites. The number of active sites can be increased, for example, by constructing a three-dimensional structure or by using the catalytic material itself as the porous electrode.
Although the current development of phosphides has encountered some challenges, they are still very promising catalytic materials. We believe that with the development of synthesis methods and the deep understanding of the mechanism, TMPs will occupy a very important position in many practical applications.
