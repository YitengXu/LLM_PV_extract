Operating at room temperature, these PDs show a low dark current density of 3.44 nA cm−2, a broad spectral response from 380 to 960 nm with high external quantum efficiencies around 20% in the NIR region at a bias of 0 V. Detectivities over 1012 cm H1/2 W−1 in the whole range from 380 to 930 nm are achieved, which rank as one of the best performances among previously reported NIR PDs.
1 Introduction
Organic photodetectors (PDs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their advantages such as potential flexibility, large-area detection, high performance at room temperature and so forth over their inorganic counterparts.1–5 The detectivity (D*) of a solution processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PD based on a π-conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative has reached 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm H1/2 W−1) with spectral response extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region,6 implying huge potential for industrial and scientific applications of organic PDs. As competitive alternatives to conjugated polymers, small molecules (SMs) do not suffer from the adverse impacts of polydispersity and batch-to-batch variation of polymers, and are also easier to be purified via standard techniques.7,8 Taking into account that several classes of SMs have been successfully utilized in BHJ solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) comparable to their polymer counterparts,9,10 it is quite promising for the applications of SMs on PDs. However, only very limited examples have been reported on the solution processed organic BHJ PDs based on SMs so far. Furthermore, although a few NIR sensitive detectors with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) more than 10% in the NIR region have been demonstrated,11,12 other solution processed SM PDs and even high performance SM solar cells usually showed very poor absorbance and EQEs at wavelength longer than 800 nm.5,9,10,13–15
The undesirable performance of SM-based NIR PDs generally results from inefficient exciton separation and charge transportation, or week absorbance in the NIR region. We designed a conjugated donor–acceptor porphyrin SM 5,15-bis-(7-(4-hexyl-thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl)-porphyrin zinc (DHTBTEZP, Scheme 1) to facilitate the intramolecular charge transportation, and this material showed very strong and broad absorption in the NIR region up to 960 nm and a high PCE with a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor in the BHJ solar cell was achieved.16 In this study, we report solution-processed NIR PDs based on DHTBTEZP and PC61BM ((6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) as the donor and the acceptor, respectively. The optimized PD device shows an optical response in the NIR region with a high EQE of around 20% at a bias of 0 V, a low dark current density in the nA cm−2 range and high detectivities over 1012 Jones from 380 to 930 nm.

2 Experimental section
DHTBTEZP was synthesized according to the procedures previously reported16 and PC61BM was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. The SM-PD devices were fabricated using the same preparation procedures with BHJ solar cells as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and isopropyl alcohol. After treated with an oxygen plasma for 5 min, a 40 nm thick poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, the substrates were subsequently dried at 130 °C for 20 min in air and then transferred to a N2-glovebox. The active layers, composed of DHTBTEZP and PC61BM (1:3 w/w, 32 mg ml−1), were deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer (40 nm) from a chlorobenzene solution with 1.0 vol% pyridine as additive to improve the qualities of the films, followed by drying under an inert atmosphere overnight to drive off the residual solvent. The blend layers with different thicknesses ranging from about 50 to 110 nm were obtained by changing the speed of spin casting and measured using a profilometer. The ultra-thin poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFN) layer was deposited by spin casting from a 0.02% (w/v) solution in methanol (2000 rpm for 30 s). Finally, Al (∼80 nm) was evaporated with a shadow mask as the top electrode. The effective area was measured to be 0.16 cm2.
UV-visible-NIR absorption spectra of the films on quartz substrates were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. The J–V characteristics of the PD devices were recorded in the dark and under illumination of 800 nm NIR light. The light source was a calibrated solar simulator, a band-pass filter was used to obtain the light at 800 nm, and data were collected using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The spectral response was measured with a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a SR830 lock-in amplifier. A calibrated Si photodiode was used as a reference before each measurement.
3 Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, the pristine DHTBTEZP in the film exhibits a broad absorption in the range from 300 to 960 nm with two strong peaks centered at 511 and 801 nm. The much stronger absorption from 600 to 960 nm compared with normal tetraphenylporphyrin analogues is ascribed to the facilitated intramolecular charge transportation induced by the conjugated donor–acceptor molecular structure. Comparing the absorbance in the NIR region, the absorption intensity increased in the short wavelength region (below 550 nm) after the incorporation of PC61BM into DHTBTEZP, which can be mostly ascribed to the absorption from PC61BM.17

The operation principles of PDs are the conversion of light into electrical power, which are similar to those of solar cells. The photocurrent density (Jph) of a photodetector depends on the intensity of light illuminated and the magnitude of EQE. Therefore, a high EQE is a prerequisite to guarantee a sufficient PD performance. The EQEs measured under zero bias with different thicknesses of the active layers are shown and summarized in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively. These PD devices show a wide photocurrent spectral response covering from 380 nm to 960 nm, matching well with the absorption spectra of the DHTBTEZP:PC61BM blend film, and an EQE of 9.86% is obtained at the operating wavelength (λ = 800 nm) of the NIR laser diode when the active layer thickness is about 50 nm. It was noted that the EQE at λ = 800 nm keeps increasing as the thickness increases, and reaches to 23.47% with a peak efficiency of 24.60% at 865 nm when the thickness is up to 110 nm, which is higher than those of the previously reported high performance BHJ SM NIR-PDs3,13 and comparable to polymeric counterparts.18

Different from the case in the NIR region, the EQE values below 550 nm reduce with the increasing thickness of the active layer though the EQE curves are quite similar between the 50 and 60 nm thick devices, which can be explained as follows: the dependence of photo-response on blend film thickness is the result of the trade-off between absorption efficiency of incident photos and free charge carrier recombination. The absorption efficiency and free carrier recombination, which show positive and negative effects to the photo-response, respectively, both increase as the active layer is thickened. It is possible that the free carriers lost in a thicker active layer due to the carrier recombination are more than those additionally generated since the absorption below 550 nm of the very thin film is already very strong (the inset of Fig. 2). In contrast, due to the much weaker absorption above 700 nm, the increase of the absorption efficiency triumphs over the additional carrier recombination, resulting in a higher EQE in this region with an increasing active layer thickness.
Being a fundamental source of electronic noise, a high dark current (Jd) can negatively affect the sensitivity of the device by increasing the recombination losses mainly arose from charge injection from the metal contacts. For this reason, an ultra-thin PFN layer was introduced as the electron extraction layer to suppress the leakage current.19 The J–V characteristics of the SM-PDs in the dark and under illumination of λ = 800 nm are shown in Fig. 3. Consistent with the enhancement of EQEs, increasing thickness of the active layer is also found to be beneficial to reduce the reversed dark leakage current.20,21 For example, a good rectification ratio of 105 (±2 V biases) in the dark is exhibited for the 110 nm thick device. This value is much higher than 104 (±2 V biases) observed from the 50 nm thick device, suggesting a better diode performance with a thicker active layer. Moreover, the Jd of the 110 nm thick device at a bias of 0 V is 3.44 nA cm−2, whereas it remains to be 1.50 μA cm−2 at −2 V, which is much smaller than that observed from the 50 nm thick PD device (10.52 nA cm−2 at 0 V, 24.70 μA cm−2 at −2 V). The level of the obtained Jd at 0 bias is in the nA cm−2 range, which is also comparable to those of the well mature standard inorganic PDs.22 Furthermore, this value is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than the Jph measured under illumination of 800 nm light with an intensity of 1.52 mW cm−2, which enables the SM-PDs to detect a weak NIR light even in strong noise background.

Detectivity is another important parameter for evaluating the performance of a PD, and a higher D* indicates the ability to detect lower level radiant power. If the shot noise from the dark current is the major contribution to the noise, the detectivity (D*) can be expressed as D* = R/(2qJd)1/2, where q is the absolute value of electron charge Coulombs (1.602 × 10−19 C), R is the photocurrent response (A W−1) and calculated from R = λ × EQE/1240, and λ is the wavelength of light.23,24 Based on the observed EQEs and dark currents, we calculated the detectivities of the PDs over the entire spectral response range (Fig. 4). At the operating wavelength of 800 nm and at a bias of 0 V, the detectivity is calculated to be 1.10 × 1012 Jones for the 50 nm device, and further increased to 4.56 × 1012 Jones for the 110 nm device, indicating that the performance of the SM-PDs is active layer thickness dependent.25 Moreover, the SM-PDs exhibit good response to the visible and NIR light with the detectivities greater than 1012 Jones from 380 nm to 930 nm for the 110 nm device, which is desirable in PD applications and comparable to previously reported high detectivity NIR-PDs.19,26

4 Conclusions
Solution processed organic near-infrared photodetectors based on a porphyrin small molecule as the donor material were fabricated. The reversed dark current was significantly reduced with enhanced EQE in the range from 600 to 960 nm when the thickness of the active layer was increased. Operating at room temperature and at a bias of 0 V, the optimized SM-PD device shows a broad spectral response from 380 to 960 nm, a low dark current density of 3.44 nA cm−2, a high photo-to-dark current ratio of about 105, a high EQE around 20% in the NIR region and detectivities over 1012 Jones from 380 to 930 nm. These high performance parameters are among the best of the previously reported SM-PDs, and comparable to their polymeric counterparts, suggesting the potentials of small molecules on NIR photodetectors.
