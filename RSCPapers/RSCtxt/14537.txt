    , Accepted 18th February 2016First published on 19th February 2016AbstractWe have designed three dimensional conjugated three- and four-armed molecules for organic solar cells, featuring a bithiophene donor (DF) fragment connected to a pyridine-thiadiazole acceptor fragment (AF) via an ethyne π-spacer (Ps) as the arms, which are linked to different central core atoms (N, B, C and Si atoms) based on two topologies, “core-D–π–A” (molecules are named N3-Mol, B3-Mol, Si4-Mol and C4-Mol) and “core-A–π–D” (molecules are named N3-RMol, B3-RMol, Si4-RMol and C4-RMol). A combination of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) approaches is applied to understand the effect of different central cores on the optical, electronic and charge transport properties of the two topologies. The “core-A–π–D” type molecules display smaller Eg values than those of the “core-D–π–A” type molecules. Therefore, the “core-A–π–D” type molecules show a significant red shift in λmax compared to the “core-D–π–A” type molecules. The molecules C4-RMol, Si4-RMol, B3-RMol and N3-RMol show red shifts of 59, 14, 28 and 39 nm in λmax as compared to C4-Mol, Si4-Mol, B3-Mol and N3-Mol, respectively. Three-armed N3-Mol and N3-RMol display the largest λmax of the designed molecules. Interestingly, B3-RMol and C4-RMol show more or less same λmax values. However, B and Si cores also show more intense absorption bands than N and C cores, respectively. Both the reorganization energy and mobility results reveal that the four-armed molecules show higher charge transport rates than the three-armed molecules because of their better dimensionality. N3-RMol exhibits μe and μh mobilities of up to 2.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively while C4-RMol shows higher μe and μh mobilities of up to 0.163 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.14 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively in the crystalline state, which have been predicted using the P21/c space group. Thus, the comparative analysis of the designed molecules reveals that the “core-A–π–D” topology with the substitution of N and C cores results in molecules which exhibit a narrow Eg, broad and intense absorptions and an anisotropic high charge carrier mobility in the crystalline phase, which is associated with low reorganization energies for organic solar cells.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are one of the most favorable alternatives for renewable energy. In the past two decades, many efforts have been devoted to polymers and small molecules because of their attractive features such as low cost, light weight and large area for fabrication on flexible substrates.1–4 Although polymer based solar cell devices show higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–10%, other organic materials such as “small molecules” have also proved to be promising because of their easy fabrication and improved efficiencies. The efficiency improvement has demonstrated that organic small molecules have the potential to compete with polymers.5–7 Among the small molecular materials for OSCs, a novel class of X or star shaped donor π-conjugated bridge–acceptor molecules are receiving more attention because of their high purity and chemically well-defined structures.8–12 The percentage PCE (or η) of a solar cell device is simply the ratio of the power output (Pout) vs. the power input (Pin), the latter being dependent upon the incident light flux (l0) and the former on the implicit properties of the device itself (eqn (1)), namely the short-circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill-factor (FF).13 (1)The design principles for enhancing the absorption properties in conjugated semiconducting materials are linking the electron donating (D) and electron accepting (A) moieties via a conjugated bridge and adjusting the ability of the pull–push electrons of the acceptor and donor moieties to control the electronic energy levels of the molecules.14–17 Previous studies have shown device Voc scales with the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the acceptor. The donor–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) composition is very favorable for improving the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in OSCs. Besides possessing a lower HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg) to absorb more visible light, a lower HOMO level is another key factor, as star shaped molecules possess a lower HOMO level than linear molecules, resulting in a higher Voc.18,19 Moreover, Vandewal et al. found that the experimental Voc is directly related to the energy of the charge transfer state, then indicated the origin of the dependence of Voc on the effective Eg of the solar cells.20 As in organic blends, the charge separation and further transport occurs under the influence of the external electric field generated via the difference of the work-functions of the electrodes. Also the strength of the external electric field affects the energies of the molecular orbitals for the donor and the acceptor. Following this classical Voc of the solar-cell model, a qualitative discussion on the relationship between the HOMO–LUMO energy gap of the whole conjugated materials and the finite external electric field, associated with those of the donor and acceptor units, can provide information about the fundamental physics for improving the performances and the rational design of OSCs.21
In the present paper,22–26 to explore a structure–property relationship, we have designed and investigated three dimensional (3D) three- and four-armed star shaped molecules with different central core atoms in two topologies, i.e., “core-D–π–A” and “core-A–π–D”, for applications in the field of photovoltaics. N and B atoms act as the cores for three-armed molecules while C and Si are the cores for four-armed molecules. The molecules where the arms’ backbone design is based on a “core-D–π–A” pattern are named N3-Mol, B3-Mol, Si4-Mol and C4-Mol while those with the arm backbone pattern “core-A–π–D” are named N3-RMol, B3-RMol, Si4-RMol and C4-RMol. In the designed molecules, 2,2′-bithiophene is acting as the donor fragment (DF), as conjugated thiophenes are an active family for developing organic p-type semiconductors which have potential applications in optoelectronic fields.27 Ethyne is acting as the active π-spacer (Ps), which is very helpful for lowering the steric hindrance between the arms and the core.28,29 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole is an efficient electron accepting moiety which gives well organized molecular structures due to significant polarizability and also leads to intermolecular interactions. The substitution of the benzene of the benzothiadiazole with pyridine results in the stronger electron accepting unit, pyridine-thiadiazole, which is acting as the acceptor fragment (AF).30–33 The schematic diagram for the designed donor molecules is shown in Scheme 1. The main objective of this study is to investigate the affect of the substitution of different cores on the optical, electronic and charge transport properties of the designed donor molecules. In addition, this analysis is also carried out to explore the relationship between the different topological structures and their optical as well as their electronic properties, with an aim of providing an in-depth understanding of the structures with regards to their properties for designing new molecules.

2 Computational methods
All the calculations were carried out with the aid of the Gaussian 09 package.34 The geometric structures of all the designed molecules in the neutral and ionic states were fully optimized at the PBE0 level with the 6-31G* basis set based on DFT.35–38C3 and C2 symmetry was imposed for the geometries of the three- and four-armed molecules respectively. The geometry optimizations of the cationic and anionic radical species were carried out at the restricted open shell level. A large number of previous works have suggested that the PBE0 method is notably adapted to sulfur-bearing molecules.30,39–44 Frequency calculations were performed with same method used for geometry optimization to confirm that the true energy minima were obtained. The density of states (DOS) was calculated and convoluted using the Pymolyze 2.0 program. The absorption properties of the designed molecules were calculated by mean of TD-DFT at the PBE0/6-31G* level of theory. GaussSum 2.2.0 was applied to yield simulated spectra for the investigated molecules. Commonly, the charge transport can be measured as a hopping process in the organic solid, which can be estimated by the Marcus model.45 For self-exchange transfer reactions, the driving force, i.e., the free energy difference (ΔG0), is approximately taken as zero in the charge transfer, and the charge transfer rate can be expressed as: (2)where kB represents the Boltzmann constant while T is the temperature. Similarly, V is the intermolecular transfer integral while λ is the reorganization energy. Eqn (2) indicates that efficient charge transport depends on these two factors, i.e., V and λ. For an effective charge transport λ should be small and V should be maximal. λ was predicted from the single point energy at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level based on the PBE0/6-31G(d) optimized neutral, cationic, and anionic geometries.46 Herein, the reorganization energy was just the internal reorganization energy (λint) of the isolated active organic π-conjugated systems, ignoring any environmental relaxation and changes.47 The external reorganization (λext) is ignored as the predicted values are much smaller than their internal parts in pure organic condensed phases.48λint for an electronic structure is presented as following: λ± = [E±0 − E±] + [E0± − E0](3)where E+0(E−0) represents the energy of the cation (anion) calculated with the optimized structure of the neutral molecule while E0+(E0−) is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated with the cationic (anionic) structure. Similarly, E0 and E± are the energies of the optimized neutral and charged molecules, respectively. To determine the transfer integrals, single-crystal structures have been used. The module polymorph embedded in Materials Studio, was used to predict the molecular crystal structures of the donor. Then all the nearest possible neighboring intermolecular hopping pathways were generated. The pw91pw91 functional was used to calculate the transfer integrals. The drift mobility (μ) from the Einstein relation is given as:49 (4)If charge motion is assumed to be a homogeneous random walk, then the diffusion constant (D) can be obtained as: (5)where D is the center-to-center distance between adjacent molecules while n = 3 is the spatial dimension of the crystal. The hopping time between two adjacent molecules is the inverse of the rate constant 1/k in eqn (5). ki is the hopping rate of a charge carrier to the ith neighbor, di is the distance to neighbor i, pi is the relative probability for the ith pathway and is given as: (6)It is also known as a 3-D averaged diffusion process. From eqn (5) it is clear that the mobility has a direct relation to the electron transfer rate. In this mechanism, it has been supposed that the localized electron can only hop between adjacent molecules, in sharp contrast to the band-like picture, where the electron is delocalized in several molecules. Yang et al. have proposed that it offers more accurate results in computations;50 thus, we used this direct method, which has been proven to yield accurate and satisfactory results. The electronic coupling for electron/hole transfer in this scheme can be written as: Vij = 〈Φ01|F0|Φ02〉(7)where Vij is the transfer integral, and Φ01 and Φ02 represent the unperturbed frontier orbitals of molecules 1 and 2 respectively in the dimer. F0 is the Kohn–Sham–Fock operator of the dimer obtained with the unperturbed density matrix, which is calculated from the molecular orbitals and density matrix of the two individual molecules and can be evaluated separately using the standard self-consistent field procedure.51 The calculations are carried out at the pw91pw91/6-31G(d) level, which gave a reasonable description for the intermolecular coupling term.52 The module polymorph of the software package Materials Studio is used to predict the molecular crystal structure. Then all the nearest possible neighboring intermolecular hopping pathways were generated.53
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs)
The optimized geometries of the three- and four-armed donor molecules, based on C3 and C2 symmetries, are displayed in the ESI† (Fig. S1). It is well known that the HOMO and LUMO energies and Eg are strongly related to the optical and electronic properties. We have focused specifically on the nature of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of all the molecules and their distribution patterns to obtain an understanding of the difference in the way that the HOMO and LUMO levels change. Furthermore, we have investigated distribution patterns by performing a percentage contribution analysis for each molecule (based on Mulliken population analysis) in terms of the total density of states (TDOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS).
The energy level diagram (Fig. 1) indicates that B3-Mol shows the lowest LUMO energy level among the “core-D–π–A” topology molecules. This is related to the electron withdrawing nature of the B core. Interestingly, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the three-armed N3-Mol (in spite of strong electron withdrawing nature of N core) increase as compared to C or Si. It can be argued that the electron pair on the N-core also acts as an electron donor center. In the case of C4-Mol and Si4-Mol, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were lower than those of N3-Mol but their LUMO energies were higher than that of B3-Mol. The decrease in the HOMO energy levels for the four-armed molecules as compared to the three-armed molecules is due to the more extended conjugation of the four arms than that of the three arms. However, the electron donating nature of the C and Si cores also caused a similar effect as both four-armed molecules displayed increased LUMO energy levels compared to that of the three-armed B3-Mol. The order of Eg for the “core-D–π–A” topology molecules is: N3-Mol < B3-Mol < C4-Mol < Si4-Mol. The FMO energy level results reveal that the electron withdrawing cores (N and B) assist in reducing Eg strongly due to their electron withdrawing behavior. It is also very interesting to note that the three-armed molecules exhibit a smaller Eg than the four-armed molecules in spite of the four extended anisotropic arms.

It is worth noting that the “core-A–π–D” topology molecules also show similar trend orders for the LUMO energy levels and Eg to those of the “core-D–π–A” topology molecules. However, the trend of the HOMO energy levels changes slightly, as the HOMO energy levels of C4-RMol and Si4-RMol are downshifted compared to that of B3-RMol. Unlike Si4-Mol, Si4-RMol showed higher HOMO and LUMO energies than those of N3-RMol. This indicates that the electron donating effect of the C and Si cores is more prominent in “core-A–π–D” type molecules. The order of Eg for the “core-A–π–D” type molecules is N3-RMol < B3-RMol < C4-RMol < Si4-RMol. This implies that molecules with electron withdrawing core atoms (N and B) exhibit smaller Eg values than those with electron donating core atoms (C and Si).
An overall comparative analysis of both topologies with respect to each other reveals more fascinating facts about the energy levels. The “core-D–π–A” type molecules showed lower HOMO energy levels relative to those of the “core-A–π–D” type molecules. Additionally, the LUMO levels of N3-RMol, B3-RMol and C4-RMol were lower than those of N3-Mol, B3-Mol and C4-Mol, respectively, except the LUMO of Si4-RMol which moved up relative to Si4-Mol. Likely due to the “core-A–π–D” topology, the HOMO levels of B3-RMol, C4-RMol and Si4-RMol were higher than those of B3-Mol, C4-Mol and Si4-Mol while the HOMO of N3-RMol was lower than that of N3-Mol. Exactly the same trend order is observed in the case of Eg, i.e., the Eg values of the “core-A–π–D” type molecules were smaller than those of the “core-D–π–A” type molecules, except for the N-core molecules. For both topologies, the Eg values of the three-armed molecules were smaller than those of the four-armed molecules. This can be attributed to the electron withdrawing strength of the N and B core atoms.
As shown in Fig. 2, for three-armed B3-Mol and B3-RMol molecules, the electronic density contours of the HOMOs and LUMOs are delocalized throughout the molecule while for N3-Mol, the electronic density contours of the HOMO and LUMO are delocalized on the donor and acceptor fragments respectively. The electronic density contours of the HOMOs and LUMOs of four-armed C4-Mol and Si4-Mol also displayed similar delocalization patterns to those of N3-Mol (Fig. 2). For N3-RMol, C4-RMol and Si4-RMol, the molecular orbitals of the HOMOs are of a π nature, with electronic density contours mainly spread over the whole molecule. On the other hand, the electronic density contours of the LUMOs are concentrated mainly on the acceptor unit. In addition, the HOMOs and LUMOs of the three-armed molecules are also centralized on the core while the core of four-armed molecules does not contribute to the HOMO and LUMO at all (Fig. 3). Such HOMO–LUMO electronic density contours are helpful for effective ICT between the donor and acceptor fragments on the arms. For both B3-Mol and N3-Mol, their H−1 to H−4 and L+3 and L+4 are delocalized over the whole molecules while L+1 and L+2 are localized over the acceptor fragments (H stands for HOMO and L stands for LUMO). The molecules C4-Mol and Si-Mol also show the same behavior in terms of the FMO distribution patterns with respect to each other. The broad distribution patterns of the FMOs result in efficient charge transport through the molecules when these are used as donor materials in OSCs. The four- and three-armed molecules also show more degenerate orbitals (Fig. S2, ESI†). These results imply that different cores and topologies significantly influence the distribution patterns of the FMOs of the corresponding molecules. They also reveal that both three-armed N3-Mol and N3-RMol showed the lowest Eg among the designed molecules in both “core-D–π–A” and “core-A–π–D” topologies, respectively. Hence, both N3-Mol and N3-RMol should lead to the longest wavelength of the absorption spectra.

The PDOS and TDOS on each fragment of each investigated molecule around the HOMO–LUMO gap were calculated at the current level of theory. The PDOS and TDOS of the molecules presented in Fig. 4 provide the percentage contribution in terms of density for the HOMOs and LUMOs from individual components (“core-D–π–A” type molecules). Table 1 predicts the percentage contribution from core (B, N, C, and Si) and non-core (NC) atoms. As predicted in Table 1, the N-core has a larger percentage contribution for the HOMO while that of the B-core is smaller for the LUMO orbital and the C and Si cores have a negligible contribution towards the HOMO and LUMO. This is true for both topologies based on three- and four-armed molecules (the molecular orbital composition in terms of percentage from the building units Ps, DF and AF of the designed donor molecules is given in Table S2, ESI†).

3.2 Absorption properties
It is known that a broad absorption covering the whole visible and some of the near-infrared region is essential to achieve good overlap with the solar spectrum to produce a large photo-current response. The simulated absorption spectra of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 5. The values of the longest wavelength of the absorption spectrum (λmax), corresponding oscillator strength (f), vertical excitation energy (Ex), and absorption region of the designed molecules are listed in Table 2. For all the designed molecules the ground state (S0) → first singlet excited state (S1) excitation process involves a HOMO → LUMO (H → L) transition with the exception of C4-Mol and Si4-Mol where the LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals are involved in addition to the HOMO orbital. This first excitation is of the π–π* type for all the designed molecules.

The Eg values of the “core-A–π–D” type three- and four-armed molecules (C4-RMol, Si4-RMol and B3-RMol) are smaller than those of the “core-D–π–A” type (C4-Mol, Si4-Mol and B3-Mol) molecules except for N3-RMol. Hence, the absorption spectra of C4-RMol, Si4-RMol and RB3-Mol are markedly red-shifted. Although Eg of N3-RMol is larger than that of N3-Mol by 0.05 eV, N3-RMol shows a red shift of 39 nm as compared to the λmax of N3-Mol. Fig. 5 shows that the three-armed N3-Mol and B3-Mol exhibit more broad absorption bands than those of C4-Mol and Si4-Mol – that of N3-Mol is red-shifted by 76 nm compared to B3-Mol – while both C4-Mol and Si4-Mol displayed almost the same λmax. The red shift in N3-Mol was more obvious than those of the four-armed analogs, implying a better planarization of the conjugated backbone in the three-armed structure. N3-Mol showed a red shift of more than 100 nm compared to the four-armed C4-Mol and Si4-Mol molecules. The molecules C4-RMol, Si4-RMol and B3-RMol showed red shifts of 59, 14 and 28 nm compared to the λmax values of C4-Mol, Si4-Mol and B3-Mol, respectively. This implies that “core-A–π–D” type molecules exhibit a more pronounced conjugation than those of “core-D–π–A” type molecules. Surprisingly, C4-RMol and B3-RMol displayed similar λmax values but the absorption band of C4-RMol was more intense than that of B3-RMol, while the λmax value of B3-RMol was red-shifted by 49 nm compared to that of Si4-RMol. Likewise, for the “core-D–π–A” type molecules, the absorption spectra of the three-armed molecules were broader than those of the four-armed “core-A–π–D” molecules. N3-RMol showed extensive red shifts of 86 and 136 nm as compared to four-armed C4-RMol and Si4-RMol respectively. Interestingly, both Si4-Mol and C4-Mol displayed almost the same λmax and also similar intensity absorption bands. Although, N3-Mol was red-shifted by 76 nm compared to B3-Mol, the maximum intensity of absorption for B3-Mol was higher than that of N3-Mol (by 0.80 a.u.).
Apparently, the N-core molecules featured three major absorption bands while the rest of the molecules displayed two major absorption bands. The comparison of the three- and four-armed molecules has revealed more interesting facts. The broadest absorption of N3-Mol and N3-RMol among the four molecules in both topologies is due to the presence of the N core, which also corresponds to the smallest Eg of the molecules. The electrons of the N-core are also involved in some of the frontier orbital hybridization, which leads to longer absorptions. The edges of the absorption spectra for the three-armed molecules are extended more as compared to the four-armed molecules. Thus, it is established that electron withdrawing cores strongly influence the absorption properties compared to electron donating cores along with the “core-A–π–D” composition (Fig. 5).
The absorption spectrum of N3-Mol covers a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm. It features four major absorptions at 610 (0.62), 471 (0.63), 447 (0.41) and 356 (0.47) nm which correspond to H → L, H → L+1, H → L+3 and H−1 → L+4 transitions, respectively (the value given in the brackets represents the intensity of the absorption). The absorption spectrum of B3-Mol covers a range from 320 to 650 nm. Three main absorptions have been observed at 534 (1.43), 437 (0.30) and 357 (0.51) nm, which are ascribed to H → L, H → L+3 and H−1 → L+5 transitions, respectively. Both four-armed C4-Mol and Si4-Mol exhibit a number of absorptions with strong intensity. C4-Mol covers an absorption range from 300 to 600 nm. In this region strong absorptions are observed at 504 (0.52), 503 (0.97), 502 (0.97), 370 (0.59), 368 (1.46) and 350 (0.12) nm. These absorptions are associated to H → L, H → L+2, H−1 → L, H−2 → L+4, H → L+4 and H−2 → L+5 transitions, respectively. Finally, the major absorptions of Si4-Mol are observed at 499 (0.61), 498 (1.00), 373 (0.68) and 370 (1.51) nm which correspond to H → L+1, H → L, H−1 → L+4 and H → L+4 transitions respectively. The designed star-shaped molecules exhibit degenerate excited states because of the C3 and C2 symmetries of the three- and four-armed molecules.
For N3-RMol there are five major absorptions at 649 (0.80), 504 (0.39), 387 (0.83), 337 (0.14) and 331 (0.23) nm which correspond to H → L, H−1 → L+1, H → L+3, H−1 → L+3 and H−2 → L+5 transitions respectively. Five main absorptions for B3-RMol are observed at 562 (1.07), 561 (1.11), 481 (0.44), 463 (0.12) and 348 (0.43) nm which are ascribed to H → L, H−1 → L, H → L+2, H−1 → L+1 and H−1 → L+4 transitions, respectively. The major absorptions for C4-RMol are observed at 563 (0.35), 551 (1.21), 521 (0.78), 453 (0.34) and 358 (0.37) nm; these absorptions are associated to H → L, H−1 → L, H−2 → L, H−2 → L+3 and H → L+4 transitions, respectively. Finally, the major absorptions of the Si4-RMol are observed at 513 (1.56), 497 (1.24), 462 (0.30), 357 (0.68), 351 (0.71) and 341 (0.58) nm which correspond to H → L, H−2 → L, H−2 → L+2, H−4 → L+1, H−3 → L+4 and H → L+5 transitions, respectively.
The electron density difference map (EDDM) of the transition states were generated for a deep understanding of the nature of the states (Fig. 6 and 7). These transition density plots also provide significant information about the locations of excitations and the absorption contribution of the individual moieties in the transition states. For example, the S1 and S5 states of N3-Mol demonstrate that positive and negative density coefficients were located on the opposite fragments which characterize the efficient charge transfer (CT) for these states. S16 indicates that both positive and negative density coefficients are evenly distributed over the whole molecular structure which is an indication of a π–π* transition. Similar behavior has been observed for other molecules. The deep examination of these orbitals involved in the excited transitions also reveals that in three-armed molecules both N and B core atoms actively participate in the excited state transitions, as density coefficients are distributed all over the arms and core while C and Si core atoms have no contribution at all in terms of density coefficients. It might be one reason for the broadened absorption of the three-armed molecules compared to the four-armed molecules as involvement of the core further reduces the Eg of the molecules. Thus, the overall analysis of the optical and electronic properties confirms that the C and N core substitutions along the “core-A–π–D” topology can result in promising donor materials for organic solar cells, likely due to their low excitation energies and broad absorption over the visible region of the solar spectrum with intense and strong peaks. This analysis also provides guidelines for building three- and four-armed donor molecules with higher performances for organic solar cells.

3.3 Match of optoelectronic properties between donors and acceptors
The Eg value of a conjugated molecule is tunable using the donor–acceptor approach to generate a higher Jsc, appropriate energy levels for a higher Voc and good charge transport.13Voc is directly related to the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor molecule. In other words, a smaller HOMO–LUMO gap is essential to harvest more sunlight, which in turn enhances Jsc.17 For practical applications, we present a scheme for an exact match between the newly designed donors with suitable acceptor molecules with the aim of evaluating the match between the designed donors and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, a classic acceptor material in OSCs) molecules. It is well known that PCBM is a frequently used electron acceptor molecule in OSCs. Formerly, in our group, PCBM and its derivatives have been analyzed using the current method.44 For efficient electron transfer, the LUMO of the donor must be positioned above that of the acceptor molecule by at least 0.23–0.54 eV. For our designed N3-Mol and N3-RMol the difference ranges from 0.26–0.27 eV which ensures efficient electron transfer from donor to acceptor molecules. Low-lying HOMO levels are essential for achieving large Voc values in photovoltaic devices, as the Voc value is closely related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the electron donor and the LUMO of the electron-acceptor. In addition, a lot of theoretical and experimental research studies corroborate the fact that the Eg value between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO has a prominent contribution to Voc.54–56 The effective expression for theoretically determining the Voc could be given as: Voc = 1/e[EHOMO(D) − ELUMO(A)] − 0.3 V(8)where e is the elementary charge, 0.3 is an empirical factor, and EHOMO and ELUMO are the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the donor and acceptor.57,58 Thus, the maximum Voc values predicted for devices based on N3-Mol and N3-RMol with PCBM are 1.79 and 1.85 V, respectively. These results indicate that N3-Mol and N3-RMol provide the best match in terms of FMOs to those of PCBM (Fig. S3, ESI†).
3.4 Reorganization energy
The charge transport properties are one of the very important parameters effecting the efficient performance of molecular donors for OSCs. λ is an important parameter for charge transfer, as it is one of the major factors controlling the rate of charge hopping and is related to the mobility (μ) values. Generally, a lower reorganization energy corresponds to a higher charge transfer rate.59 The λ values of the hole (λh) and electron (λe) have been calculated for all the designed molecules (Table 3). The computed λe and λh values are smaller than the typical electron transport material Alq3 (λe = 0.276 eV) and the typical hole transport material TPD (λh = 0.29 eV), respectively.60,61 Interestingly, the four-armed molecules showed lower λ values than those of the three-armed molecules. This is likely due to the increased dimensionality of the four-armed molecules which leads to higher anisotropic charge transport.

Table 3 reveals that the four-armed molecules gave lower reorganization values than those of the three-armed molecules, which is in agreement with experimental results.23,62 For the “core-A–π–D” topology molecules, the λe and λh values are smaller than those of the “core-D–π–A” topology molecules. For four-armed molecules, the λe values are lower than the λh values; therefore, these are better electron transport materials for OSCs. In fact, the λe and λh values of the three-armed molecules are more or less comparable; therefore, these can act as better hole and electron transport materials under the proper operating conditions for photovoltaic devices. The reorganization energy values indicate that the four-armed molecules exhibited higher charge transfer rates than the three-armed molecules.
3.5 Stability
One of the most important criteria to determine the nature of devices for charge transport and luminescent materials is stability. The absolute hardness ‘η’ predicts the stability of designed molecules based on molecular orbital theory. This was calculated using operational definitions given as:63,64 (9)where η is defined as the resistance of the chemical potential to the change in the number of electrons.
In eqn (9), μ indicates the chemical potential and N represents the total electron number. The adiabatic ionization potential (IP) and adiabatic electron affinity (EA) values were determined according to the equations IP = Ecr − Ep and EA = Ep − Ear, where p, cr, and ar represent the parent molecule and the corresponding cation and anion radicals generated after electron transfer, respectively.
The stability results indicate that the η values of four-armed molecules are slightly larger than those for three-armed molecules for both topologies, i.e., “core-D–π–A” and “core-A–π–D”, indicating that the C and Si core substituted molecules are more stable than the N and B core substituted molecules. These results reveal that the different core atom substitutions may significantly affect the stability of the final molecules (Table S4, ESI†).
3.6 Mobility
For charge carrier mobility, V is an important parameter, as μ is linearly proportional to the electron transfer rate. V is also dependent on the relative position of interacting molecules.65 The single-crystal structures are used to calculate V and generate all the possible nearest-neighbor intermolecular hopping pathways.
Based on the suitable optical and electronic characteristics, we chose N3-RMol and C4-RMol as representatives of the three- and four-armed molecules, respectively, to study their charge transport properties in the solid state. Due to the possible structural resemblance with previously studied structures, the crystal structures of N3-Mol and C4-RMol were simulated by lattice energy minimization with the P21/c space group. The structural parameters of the simulated crystal structures for the investigated molecules showed comparable results with P21/c.66–68 It is a triclinic system. Interestingly, the four-armed C4-RMol displayed higher mobility values as compared to N3-RMol, which is because of the increased dimensionality of the four-armed C4-RMol, resulting in enhanced carrier transport. These findings are in agreement with experimental results.62 The mobility results are also consistent with the reorganization energy values. The crystal structures of N3-Rmol and C4-RMol predicted by Material Studio are shown in Fig. 9 and 10.

Fig. 8 presents the crystal structure of N3-RMol. One of the molecules was arbitrarily chosen as the center to diffuse the charge and then 10 distinct nearest-neighbor hopping pathways were recognized. The crystal structure parameters are: a = 16.80 Å, b = 68.61 Å, c = 30.46 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 91°. The calculated transfer integrals for the electron (Ve) and hole (Vh) demonstrate that pathways 7 and 10 possessed larger values for Ve while pathways 7, 10 and 5 showed larger values for Vh (Table 4). Moreover, pathway 2 exhibited larger values for both Ve and Vh. This reveals that the orientation of the interacting molecules is the key factor of hole or electron coupling because the cofacial stacking structure is expected to provide more efficient orbital overlap leading to the most efficient charge transfer route. The transfer integral calculations for N3-Mol showed that the electron mobility (μe) is higher than the hole mobility (μh).

The crystal structure of C4-RMol is shown in Fig. 8. On the basis of the crystal structure the lattice parameters are a = 23.23 Å, b = 36.67 Å, c = 56.30 Å, α = γ = 90° and β = 103°. 10 distinct nearest-neighbor hopping pathways were recognized for C4-RMol. Table 5 indicates that C4-RMol exhibited larger Ve values along pathways 2, 3 and 5 and larger Vh values along pathways 1, 3 and 4. The crystal structure calculations for C4-Mol suggests that μe is higher than μh which is also in agreement with the reorganization energy calculations.

The calculated data demonstrates that the electronic coupling is determined by the relative distance and orientations of the interacting molecules. It also reveals that the stacking structure is the most important factor for the molecular mobility properties.69 Finally, both the reorganization and transfer integral calculations have proved that the four-armed donor materials exhibited a higher charge transfer rate than the three-armed materials.
4 Conclusion
In this article, we have designed and investigated a series of three- and four-armed conjugated molecules as OPV donor materials based on DFT, with a molecular architecture consisting of a bithiophene donor unit connected to a pyridine-thiadiazole acceptor unit via an ethyne π-spacer as the arms, which are linked to different cores (N, B, C and Si). The effect of different central cores (N and B for three- and C and Si for four-armed molecules) on the optical, electronic and charge transport properties has been explored for two different topologies, i.e., “core-D–π–A” and “core-A–π–D”. The “core-D–π–A” type molecules displayed lower HOMO energy levels than those of the “core-A–π–D” type molecules. The absorption spectra of the “core-A–π–D” topology molecules are significantly red-shifted compared to those of the “core-D–π–A” type molecules. The three-armed molecules cover a wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm while the four-armed molecules cover the 300 nm to 600 nm region of the solar spectrum. Three-armed N3-Mol and N3-RMol displayed the largest λmax of the respective designed molecules. Interestingly, B3-RMol and C4-RMol exhibited more or less the same λmax. However, for three- and four-armed molecules, the absorption bands of the B and Si core-containing molecules are of strong intensity as compared to those containing N and C cores respectively. Both the reorganization energy and mobility results have revealed that the four-armed molecules are better electron transport materials while the three-armed molecules can act as ambipolar materials. Finally, on the basis of the investigated results, we predict that the “core-A–π–D” topology with N or C core substitutions results in molecules which exhibit a narrow Eg, broad and intense absorptions and an anisotropic high charge carrier mobility in the crystalline phase, which is associated with low reorganization energies for OSCs. Thus, the optical, electronic and charge transport properties can be enhanced by designing “core-A–π–D” type molecules, particularly with N and C cores, as promising donor materials for organic solar cells. We believe that the present detailed investigation can provide potential guidelines to develop small molecule donors for highly efficient organic photovoltaics.
