    , Accepted 26th September 2012First published on 26th September 2012AbstractIn the current study, the nanocomposite of molybdenum disulfide and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT@MoS2) was proposed for the first time as a counter electrode (CE) catalyst in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) to speed up the reduction of triiodide (I3−) to iodide (I−). This novel catalyst was synthesized by simply mixing MWCNTs and MoS2 in an acidic solution and then converting the solid intermediate into the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite in a H2 flow at 650 °C. X-ray powder diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy confirmed the composition and the structure of the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite. The microstructure details of the nanocomposite were studied by transmission electron microscopy, showing that only a few-layers of the MoS2 nanosheets were formed on the MWCNT surface. This unique structure is beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity of MWCNT@MoS2 towards the reduction of I3−. The extensive cyclic voltammograms (CV) showed that the cathodic current density of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE was higher than those of MoS2, MWCNT and sputtered Pt CEs due to the increased active surface area of the former. Moreover, the peak current densities of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE showed no sign of degradation after consecutive 100 CV tests, suggesting the great electrochemical stability of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE. Furthermore, the MWCNT@MoS2 CE demonstrated an impressive low charge-transfer resistance (1.69 Ω cm2) for I3− reduction. Finally, the DSSC assembled with the MWCNT@MoS2 CE showed a high power conversion efficiency of 6.45%, which is comparable to the DSSC with Pt CE (6.41%).
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are emerging as one of the next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their low cost, simple fabrication procedure, and significant performance efficiency.1 In a DSSC, the electrons radiatively excited from dye molecules are rapidly injected into the conduction band of a TiO2 photoanode, and then transported to the counter electrode (CE) with electrocatalytic activity through an external electric circuit. The main function of a CE is to speed up the reduction of I3− to I− which then regenerates the dye molecules. Therefore, a CE must possess the characteristics of both high electrical conductivity for electron transport and good electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction.2 In general, a thin layer of platinum (Pt) has been employed as the CE material in a DSSC; however, due to the limited resource of noble metals, it is necessary to find the new catalysts to replace Pt CE in DSSCs. Up to date, numerous attempts have been made to find the potential alternatives to Pt CE, including carbon materials,3–5 conducting polymers,6,7 transition metal sulfides,8–10 nitrides,11 and carbides.12
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely used as the material for catalyst supports due to their excellent properties such as large surface area, high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical strength and good chemical stability.13 Furthermore, CNTs can be tailored through surface functionalization, and thus the decoration of CNTs with electrocatalytically active materials can be made. In addition, CNTs possess electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction to a certain extent.14 In the previous study reported by Li et al.,15 DSSCs with a composite CE composed of TiN nanoparticles with superior electrocatalytic activity and conductive multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) show an improved photovoltaic performance. Lin et al.16 further demonstrate the enhanced photovoltaic performance of DSSCs assembled with a composite CE prepared by electrophoretic deposition of MWCNTs onto a conducting glass substrate followed by CoS electrodeposition.
Recently, Wu et al.17 use molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as a CE in DSSCs which shows a photovoltaic efficiency of 7.59%. However, a MoS2 thin film with a thickness of ∼20 μm is required for the CE to demonstrate its electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized the nanocomposite of MWCNTs and MoS2 (MWCNT@MoS2), and applied this novel composite catalyst as a CE in DSSCs for the first time. It is envisaged that only a few layers of the MoS2 nanosheets anchored onto the MWCNT surface should result in improvements in the electrical conductivity as well as electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. According to a series of electrochemical analyses, the MWCNT@MoS2 CE shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction and great electrochemical stability. The DSSC assembled with the MWCNT@MoS2 CE exhibits an impressive photovoltaic performance of 6.45%, which is comparable to the DSSC with the sputtered Pt CE.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite
The synthesis of the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite was based on the previous study reported by Shubin and Bulusheva18 In brief, acid-treated MWCNTs (20 mg) and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (80 mg) were added to 5 ml of 20% aqueous ethanol. The mixed solution was sonicated for 20 min to make a homogeneous dispersion and then 2 ml of concentrated HCl was added to the mixed solution. Upon the addition of HCl, the precipitation was observed due to the reaction: (NH4)2MoS4 + 2HCl → MoS3↓ + 2NH4Cl + H2S. After a 2 h reaction time, the precipitate was filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air. Finally, the MoS3/MWCNT intermediate was annealed in a H2 (10%) flow at 650 °C for 1 h. The loading amount of MoS2 on the MWCNTs is approximately 50 wt%.
2.2 Preparation of CEs
The active materials, such as MoS2, MWCNTs and MWCNT@MoS2 powders, were mixed with acetylene black (99.99%, Strem Chemicals Inc.) and polyvinyldifluoride (Kynar 740, ELF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The paste of the aforementioned mixtures was prepared using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (ultra, ISP Technologies Inc.) as the solvent and subsequently drop-casted over a drilled fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate with an area of 0.64 cm2 (Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd., 13 Ω sq−1) to form the film with a thickness of ∼4 μm. The coated FTO glass was dried at 120 °C for 24 h under vacuum. For comparison, ∼100 nm thick Pt film was sputtered onto a FTO glass substrate as a CE by a DC sputtering instrument (ULVAC).
2.3 Assembly of DSSCs
According to our previous studies,19,20 bi-layer TiO2 photoanodes (0.28 cm2) composed of the transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 layer (∼12 μm) and the light-scattering TiO2 layer (∼2 μm) were prepared using a screen-printing approach. After the screen printing, the as-prepared TiO2 photoanodes were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 80 °C. Then, the TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in an ethanol solution containing 0.3 mM N719 dye (Everlight Chemical Industry Co.) and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode was further assembled with a CE into a sandwich-type configuration and then sealed with a thermoplastic hot-melt surlyn (30 μm thick, Dupont). After that, the redox electrolyte was injected into the space between two electrodes through the pre-drilled holes on the CE. The redox electrolyte was composed of 1 M 1.3-dimethylimidazolium iodine (Merck), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%, Aldrich), 0.15 M iodine (J. T. Baker), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (Aldrich) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (Acros). Finally, the holes on the CE were sealed after the electrolyte injection.
2.4 Characterizations and measurements
Raman spectra were obtained by a confocal Raman microscopic system (NT-MDT). Wavelength and spot size of the laser are 473 nm and 0.4 μm, respectively. The Si peak at 520 cm−1 was used for calibration in the experiments. Chemical configurations were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Phi V5000). XPS measurements were performed with an Al Kα X-ray source on the samples. The energy calibrations were made against the C 1s peak to eliminate the charging of the sample during analysis. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of the nanocomposite was obtained from Philips X'Pert Pro MPD. Field-emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, operated at 200 kV with a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used to obtain the information of the microstructures and the chemical compositions.
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and Tafel polarization curves were conducted using a computer-controlled electrochemical analyzer (CHI 6081D, CH Instrument). Electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) analysis was performed by means of an IM-6 impedance analyzer (Zahner). The symmetric dummy cells were employed for both EIS and Tafel measurements. EIS analysis was conducted at an open-circuit potential condition. The frequency of applied sinusoidal AC voltage signal was varied from 0.1 Hz to 1 M Hz and the corresponding amplitude was kept at 5 mV. The resultant impedance spectra were fitted by means of the software, ZSimpWin version 3.1. The photocurrent density–voltage characteristics of DSSCs were obtained under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (Yamashita Denso YSS-100A) and a Keithley 2400 digital source meter.
3. Results and discussion
In this study, MWCNTs serve as the template where MoS3 is anchored. Fig. 1a shows some amorphous MoS3 nanoparticles are precipitated on the MWCNT surface after mixing MWCNTs and (NH4)2MoS4 in an acidic environment. After annealing the nanocomposite in H2 at 650 °C, it is found that the amorphous MoS3 nanoparticles are converted into a nanosheet-like coating on the MWCNT surface (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1†). The EDS analysis of the annealed nanocomposite (see Fig. S1†) reveals the presence of C, O, Mo and S elements. To further characterize the identity and structure of the composite sample, XRD measurements were carried out. The bottom of Fig. 1c shows the typical XRD pattern of the nanocomposite before annealing treatment. The peaks at 25.8° and 44.6° were indexed to (002) and (100) reflections of MWCNTs, respectively.18 Due to the fact that only MWCNT diffraction peaks are observed in the spectrum, it is confirmed that MoS3 is noncrystalline, which is consistent with the previous report.21 For the nanocomposite sample annealed at 650 °C in H2, with the exception of the broad peak originated from MWCNTs, several new diffraction peaks are observed in the XRD spectrum. These broad diffraction peaks (the upper in Fig. 1c) are derived from MoS2 nanocrystal with a hexagonal structure [powder diffraction file (PDF) no. 771716]. Fig. 1d shows the typical Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite. The nanocomposite exhibits two MoS2 Raman characteristic bands at 403 and 377 cm−1, corresponding to the A1g and E2g modes respectively.22

Fig. 2 shows the XPS spectra of the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite. The C1s core level shown in Fig. 2b can be deconvoluted into four peaks. The main peak at 284.6 eV is assigned to sp2-hybridized graphite-like carbon atoms. The peak at 285.3 eV is attributed to sp3-hybridized carbon atoms whereas the peaks at 286.2 and 287.6 eV are typical of carbon atoms bound to one oxygen atom by a single bond and by a double bond, respectively.21,23 As shown in Fig. 2c, the Mo3d signal consists of two doublets. The doublet (Mo3d5/2 = 229.4 eV; Mo3d3/2 = 232.6 eV) at a relatively low binding energy can be assigned to the Mo ion in the +4 oxidation state whereas the other doublet (Mo3d5/2 = 232.6 eV; Mo3d3/2 = 235.8 eV) is attributed to the Mo ion in MoO3 which was possibly formed in the process of the catalyst preparation.24 Furthermore, the binding energy at 162.2 eV and 163.4 eV in Fig. 2d can be assigned to spin-orbit S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, respectively. These binding energies are all consistent with the reported values for MoS2 crystal.25 Based on TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS data, it is concluded that sheet-like MoS2 is formed on the MWCNT surface.

In the current study, the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite is proposed for the first time as the CE material in DSSCs. To estimate the electrocatalytic performance of the MWCNT@MoS2 toward I3− reduction, its CV studies are compared with various CE materials. Fig. 3 shows the CVs of the I2/I− system for Pt, MoS2, MWCNT and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs in the potential interval of −0.8 to 0.8 V vs. Pt taken at scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Two pairs of redox peaks are expected according to the previous studies.26 The relatively positive pair (ox (i) and red (i)) corresponds to the redox of I2/I3−, as presented in eqn (1). The other pair (ox (ii) and red (ii)) is associated with the redox of I3−/I−, as given by eqn (2). 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(1) I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(2)From Fig. 3, it can be observed that the Pt, MoS2 and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs exhibit two redox pairs whereas no significant peak is observed for the MWCNT CE. This suggests that MoS2 and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs have similar electrocatalytic activity to the Pt CE, and MWCNT CE has a poor electrocatalytic activity. Notably, the red (ii) peak for the MWCNT@MoS2 CE is shifted towards a positive potential compared to those for Pt and MoS2 CEs, suggesting that there are lower overpotential losses in the MWCNT@MoS2 CE. Furthermore, the current densities of the redox peaks for MWCNT@MoS2 CE are much higher than those of MoS2 CE. Since MWCNT CE does not demonstrate any electrocatalytic activity, the high current densities of MWCNT@MoS2 CE are mainly derived from the MoS2 nanosheets deposited on the surface of MWCNTs.

More CV tests of MoS2 and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs for the I−/I3− redox reaction were carried out by changing the scan rates as shown in Fig. 4a and b. It can be observed for both CEs that the peak current densities increase with increasing scan rate. Moreover, the cathodic peaks shift negatively, and the corresponding anodic peaks shift positively with increasing scan rate. Fig. 4c depicts the variation of the peak current densities for the redox pair (ii) vs. the square root of the scan rate (v). The nearly linear relationship can be found for both CEs, revealing that the reaction of the I−/I3− redox couple at both CEs is dominated by the diffusion-controlled transport and there is no specific interaction between the I−/I3− redox couple and MoS2 or MWCNT@MoS2 CEs.27 The diffusion coefficient (D) of I3− can be further estimated by means of the Randles–Sevcik equation:28 Ip = Kn3/2AC(D)1/2υ1/2(3)where Ip represents the peak current density, K is the constant of 2.69 × 105, n represents the number of electrons transferred in the redox event, A is the electrode area and C represents the bulk concentration of I3− species. The diffusivity of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE is 2.32 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1, which is larger than that of the MoS2 CE (1.13 × 10−6 cm−2 s−1).

(c) The correlation between redox current densities and the scan rate for the MoS2 (solid line) and MWCNT@MoS2 (dashed line) CEs. ipa and ipc represent the anodic and cathodic current densities for the I−/I3− redox reaction. 
To investigate the electrochemical stability of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE, 100 consecutive CV cycles are performed in the potential region from −0.4 to 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as presented in Fig. 5. After 100 consecutive scans, the CV shape of MWCNT@MoS2 do not change and the current densities of its redox peaks remain stable, suggesting that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE possesses the characteristics of reversible redox activity, excellent electrochemical and chemical stability and strong adhesiveness on the FTO glass substrate.

A symmetric sandwich-like cell consisting of two identical CEs was utilized to further examine the electrocatalytic activities of the aforementioned CEs in the same electrolyte used for DSSCs. Fig. 6a shows Nyquist plots for the cells made with Pt, MoS2, MWCNT and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs. According to EIS theory, the ideal Nyquist plot includes a series resistance (Rs), which can generally be estimated from the intercept on the real axis in the high-frequency region. The left-hand semicircle at high frequency represents the charge–transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cμ) in the charge–transfer process for I3− reduction at the electrolyte/CE interface.29,30 The semicircle at low frequency corresponds to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) of the I−/I3− redox couple transport in the electrolyte. The inset in Fig. 6a also gives the equivalent circuits used to model the impedance behavior in these CEs and the simulated data from the EIS spectra at high-frequency region are summarized in Table 1. It is noted that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE demonstrates the largest Cμ value among all CEs and thus possesses the largest active surface area which can promote its electrocatalytic activity. This is in accordance with the observation from the CV tests. Furthermore, the Rct value of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE is decreased to 1.69 Ω cm2, which is lower than those of the Pt CE (1.91 Ω cm2), MoS2 CE (2.43 Ω cm2) and MWCNT CE (8.59 Ω cm2). This indicates that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE shows superior electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction compared with other CEs including the sputtered Pt CE. The MWCNT@MoS2 CE has rapid electron-transfer kinetics due to the synergistic effect from the conductive network of MWCNTs and the increased surface area of the MoS2 nanosheets. The stability of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE is further investigated by testing the freshly prepared dummy cells and the two-week aged ones. Fig. 6b shows a slight decrease in the Rct value for the MWCNT@MoS2 CE after being aged for two weeks, which is possibly ascribed to the better contact or the enhanced I3− reduction at the electrolyte/CE interface.10 This result indicates that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE is electrochemically stable in the electrolyte containing the corrosive I−/I3− redox couple, which is also in accordance with the consecutive CV tests.

To further test the electrocatalytic activities of the CEs, Tafel-polarization analyses are conducted using the same symmetric cells used in the EIS measurements. Fig. S2† shows the Tafel polarization curves for the symmetric cells assembled with Pt, MoS2, MWCNT, and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs. The tangent slope of Tafel curves provides the information about the exchange current density (J0). The J0 values for the individual CEs are also summarized in Table 1. Compared to the Pt, MoS2 and MWCNT CEs, the MWCNT@MoS2 CE demonstrates a higher J0 (5.89 mA cm−2), indicating that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE can catalyze the I3− reduction more effectively. Meanwhile, according to eqn (4), the Rct value varies inversely with J0 value.28 The variance tendency of the Rct value calculated from the J0 value for the Pt, MoS2, MWCNT and MWCNT@MoS2 CEs is in accordance with that obtained in the EIS measurements. (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction at the electrolyte/CE interface.
The photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on the aforementioned CEs are measured under full sunlight illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5 G). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters, such as the open circuit voltage (Voc), the short circuit current density (Jsc), the fill factor (FF), and the cell efficiency (η) are also summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 7a, the DSSC with the MWCNT CE exhibits a poor conversion efficiency of 3.53% due to its poor electrocatalytic activity. Among all DSSCs, the one assembled with MWCNT@MoS2 exhibits a Voc of 0.73 V, Jsc of 13.69 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.65, thus resulting in an impressive cell efficiency of 6.45%. This photovoltaic performance is comparable to that of the DSSC using a Pt CE (6.41%). As shown in Table 1, the DSSC assembled with MoS2 has a lower Jsc (11.25 mA cm−2) and FF (0.61) values than the DSSC based on the MWCNT@MoS2 CE, and thus the former has an inferior photovoltaic efficiency (4.99%). The enhancement in FF value for the DSSC based on the MWCNT@MoS2 CE can be attributed to its low Rs and Rct value.31,32 Furthermore, the increase in the contact area of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE/electrolyte is responsible for improving its Jsc value, which increases the total current of the I−/I3− redox reaction.27,30

Fig. 7b shows the possible electrocatalytic mechanism of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE toward I3− reduction in the operation of DSSCs. MWCNTs can be recognized as not only the support for MoS2 nanosheets but also the conductive pathway through which the electrons are easily shuttled to the intrinsically electrocatalytic MoS2 nanosheets. As evidenced by our TEM image (Fig. 1b), only a few-layers of MoS2 nanosheets are formed on the MWCNT surface. This unique structure is beneficial to the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity of MWCNT@MoS2 towards the reduction of I3−. For example, the intimate contact between the MoS2 layers and the MWCNT walls causes electrons to be easily delivered from conductive MWCNTs to MoS2 nanosheets. Furthermore, MoS2 nanosheets with a few layers should avoid a major loss of the electrons when electrons are transferred between the sandwich sheets in MoS2. These effects cause the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite to have a smaller Rs value than MoS2 particles. On the other hand, the CV and EIS measurements suggest that MoS2 nanosheets on the MWCNT surface should have a larger active surface area than MoS2 particles, which causes the former to have a smaller Rct value.33 Furthermore, the large active surface of the MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite allows the I3− species to have a high probability of diffusing on the MoS2 surface. This is also supported by the fact that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE shows a larger diffusion coefficient of I3− compared to the MoS2 CE. Due to its excellent electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability, it is anticipated that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE has a great potential as a low cost alternative to Pt in DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
In this work, a nanocomposite of MoS2 and MWCNTs has been successfully synthesized by simply mixing MWCNTs and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in an acidic solution and then converting the solid intermediate into a MWCNT@MoS2 nanocomposite in a H2 flow at 650 °C. Raman, XRD and XPS experiments have verified the composition and structure of the nanocomposite. As evidenced by our TEM image, a few-layers of MoS2 nanosheets are coated on the MWCNT surface. This unique structure is beneficial to the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity of MWCNT@MoS2 towards the reduction of I3−. The extensive CV measurements show that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE with a high active surface area possesses a higher cathodic current density than MWCNT, MoS2 and sputtered Pt CEs. The small Rct value (1.69 Ω cm2) of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE estimated from Nyquist plot also demonstrates its superior electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the peak current densities of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE show no sign of degradation after 100 CV cycles, suggesting the great electrochemical stability of the MWCNT@MoS2 CE. Finally, the DSSC assembled with a MWCNT@MoS2 CE shows the comparable power conversion efficiency (6.45%) to the DSSC with sputtered Pt CE (6.41%). The present work suggests that the MWCNT@MoS2 CE shows a great potential as a low cost alternative to Pt in DSSCs.
