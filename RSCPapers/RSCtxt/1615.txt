    , Accepted 29th April 2013First published on 1st May 2013AbstractThe absorption spectra and excited states of four triphenylamine-based organic dye molecules (TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4) for dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been theoretically investigated with density function theory (DFT) and time-dependent density function theory (TDDFT). In order to simulate the optical properties of the real DSSCs, sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster interface systems TC4-(TiO2)n (n = 1–8) are also modeled. It is found that different adsorption sites and sizes of the clusters will exert critical effects on the molecular orbital energy levels of the complexes, and ultimately on their light-harvesting capabilities. In all the tested sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster interface systems, the binding of the organic dye molecule to the 3-fold-coordinated titanium of the cluster (TiO2)6 could most benefit the widening of the spectrum response region and the interactions between the sensitizer and the cluster. From the intuitive physical pictures given by the three-dimensional (3D) real-space analysis methods of transition and charge difference densities, one reveals the photo-induced charge transfer microcosmic process of the sampled organic sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster system TC4-(TiO2)6.
Introduction
One of the exciting applications of solar energy resources is the solar cell. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with great superiorities of low cost, environmental protection and production technology, has become a current hot topic. The study of DSSCs can be traced back to the 1960s, and the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency was quite low because of the small specific surface area of the single crystal semiconductor electrode at that time. Until the 1990s, after the Gratzel group attempted the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode, the performance of DSSCs had been greatly improved.1 The working principle of the photo-electricity conversion for DSSCs is essentially the light-induced interfacial electron transfer from the excited molecular sensitizer to the semiconductor nanoparticle.2–10 A very important and prerequisite chemical step before the interfacial electron-transferring behavior is the photo-excitation of the dye molecule from its ground state to the excited state.4,11–14 The range and strength of the light absorption of the dye sensitizer are two important factors in elevating the performance of DSSCs. Hence, to study the absorption spectra and the excited-state properties of the dye molecules or the complex system in which the sensitizers covalently attach onto the titanium dioxide surface are meaningful for the deep understanding of the photoelectric transformation mechanism of DSSCs.
Dye sensitizers, including metal complexes and pure organic molecules,15–25 serve a vital function in DSSCs.26–30 It extends the region of the visible absorption spectra of DSSCs, influencing directly the photoelectric conversion efficiency. An ideal sensitizer should be provided with good chemical stability, desired oxidation–reduction potential, strong absorption in the visible light region and long lifetime of the excited states. Over the years, great efforts have been done for the exploitation of different sensitizers. Ru-based complexes achieving the high power conversion efficiency at about 11%31,32 have become the most famous photosensitizers. However, the popularization and application of these metal complexes are limited, because of the quantity constraints and the strong toxicity for the Ru element. Therefore, metal-free dyes are now receiving more attentions.
Triphenylamine (TPA) and its derivatives, with the electron-donating and charge-transporting advantages, have been extensively investigated as the electroluminescent material and organic sensitizer for DSSCs.28,33–39 TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4 sensitizers based on the triphenylamine unit are four typical conjugated metal-free dyes containing the –COOH anchoring groups. The experimental and computational studies about the structural, electronic and optical properties of the four molecules have been accomplished in ref. 34. TC4 sensitizer, with its narrow HOMO–LUMO gap and the exciting electricity conversion efficiency (4.82%),34 could be a better choice for further computational investigations.
Furthermore, the dye/semiconductor surface systems have been studied both in experimental and theoretical methods,9,40–48 but the detailed discussion about the interfacial charge transfer mechanism of the systems may be insufficient. In this work, the theoretical investigations of the ground and excited-state properties of TC1, TC2, TC3, and TC4 dye molecules are conducted. In order to simulate the light-induced excitation of the photosensitizer and the micro mechanism of the electron injection from the excited dye molecule to the semiconductor film in the real DSSCs, titanium dioxide clusters (TiO2)n (n = 1–8) are employed to approximately modify the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide semiconductor electrode. We build up TC4-(TiO2)n (n = 1–8) complex systems and choose typically two of them, TC4-(TiO2)6 and TC4-(TiO2)8, to investigate in detail their ground and excited-state properties by quantum chemistry calculations. Three-dimensional (3D) real space analysis methods of transition density (TD) and charge difference density (CDD) are used to visualize the charge transfer process in the dye/titanium dioxide cluster interface systems. This may help to further understand the micro dynamic behaviors of the interfacial electron transfer between the molecular sensitizer and the nanocrystalline TiO2 thin-film electrode in DSSCs.
Computational model and method
Optimization of the ground-state structures are carried out based on the density function theory (DFT),49 and the normalized absorption spectra are investigated with time-dependent density function theory (TDDFT).50 For the organic sensitizers (TC1, TC2, TC3 and TC4) and the TC4-(TiO2)n (n = 1–8) systems, Cam-Becke3 Lee Yang Parr (CAM-B3LYP) functional51 is employed together with the 6–31 g(d,p)52,53 basis set on C, H, O, N elements and the Los Alamos effective core potential Lanl2dz54 on the transition element Ti. Referring to the references regarding the titanium dioxide clusters,55–57 we set up the clusters (TiO2)n (n = 1–8) (Fig. S1, ESI,† (A)), and optimized the geometrical structures at DFT/CAM-B3LYP/lanl2dz theory level. The influences of the solvent environment on the geometry configurations and absorption spectra are considered in our calculations. Integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEFPCM)58–61 is adopted throughout, and methanol is considered as the solvent in the calculations according to the experimental settings. Three-dimensional (3D) real-space analysis methods62–67 are used to describe the charge transfer process of the TC4-(TiO2)n (n = 1–8) systems. All the calculations are employed with Gaussian 09 program suite.68
Results and discussion
For TC1, TC2, TC3, and TC4 dye sensitizers, Chen and coworkers had conducted experimental and theoretical investigations at the B3LYP/6–31 g(d,p) theory level. In their calculations, TC4 possesses the maximum absorption wavelength at 530 nm, which is far from the experimental data 425 nm.34 Hereafter, Preat and coworkers performed quantum chemistry calculations on a series of triphenylamine derivatives including TC1, TC2, and TC3 dye molecules. The effects of different functional, basis set and solvent effects on the excited-state properties of the molecules were examined. They concluded that BHandH functional was an available method in spite of the photo-induced charge-transfer properties,39 with the error values between the theoretical calculations and the experimental data less than 10 nm. However, to give attention to both the simulation of the charge transfer process and the desired calculation accuracy, we adopt the hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP that contains the long-range correction (0.65 HF plus 0.35 B88 at long range). Because it performs well at the description of the charge-transfer excited states, which had been tested on a dipeptide model by Takeshi Yanai and coworkers.51 Besides, the non-planar spatial structure of the triphenylamine unit, which could be affected by the solvent environment, effectively reduces the aggregation of the dye sensitizers on the semiconductor film.38 Furthermore, the liquid or gel electrolytic solution environment significantly improves the conversion efficiency of the DSSC by influencing the electron transport and transfer process, time of the dye ground state regeneration and so on.69–72 Therefore, another important calculation parameter that we should consider is the solvent effect. Chart S1, ESI† gives the ground-state geometric parameters of the four dye molecules in a vacuum and methanol solvent (IEFPCM) for comparison, including some important bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles. The change of the same bond length or bond angles in vacuum and solvent is inconspicuous, while the difference of the dihedral angle is quite obvious. For example, the solvent shift of the dihedral angle D(8,7,9,15) of TC1 is more than 4 degrees. Table 1 gives the calculated transition energies (E) and oscillator strengths (f) for the four sensitizers in vacuum and methanol solvent for comparison, also including the experimental data. From Table 1, the absorption spectra in the solvent phase are red-shifted and are much closer to the experimental value. According to the analysis above, to study the ground-state configurations and absorption spectra of the D-π-A dyes, solvent model should be a considerable factor during the DFT and TDDFT calculations. In all four dye molecules, TC4 possesses the longest absorption wavelength 412 nm (425 nm in experiment) for the first excited state S1, corresponding to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) excitation between the triphenylamine unit and the cyanoacrylic group (the frontier molecular orbitals of TC4 are listed in the Chart S2 in the ESI†). Also, the oscillator strength (f = 1.6009) of TC4 is the largest in the four dyes, which means the strongest light absorption. The weak absorption band of TC4 at 292 nm (303 nm in experiment) comes from the S2 excited state, corresponding to the π–π* electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO + 1. The calculated absorption peaks agree well with the experimental data (the difference is less than 30 nm). TC4 possesses the best optical properties of the four organic dyes and could be a better choice for the further theoretical studies.

In order to interpret the microscopic chemical mechanisms for the photoelectric conversion of the DSSC, a lot of theoretical calculations about the dye/semiconductor complex systems had been done using quantum chemistry methods. Generally, titanium dioxide surfaces or clusters are adopted to model the semiconductor thin film electrode of DSSCs. For example, Chen and coworkers had investigated the ground and excited-state properties of the triarylamine-based dyes (TC1 and TPAR1) before and after binding to Ti atom.41 Preat et al. also established the interface systems that TPA derivatives binding to one or two titanium atoms.73,74 Alternatively, the titanium dioxide cluster was adopted by Deng and coworkers to model the semiconductor titanium dioxide thin film electrode,40 and the ground geometries, electronic structures and optical features of the TPA-based organic dyes/titanium dioxide cluster complex systems had been theoretically studied. They considered the bidentate adsorption mode.75,76 Herein, we focus on the single O–Ti monodentate binding mode77 and the detailed charge transfer process of the sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster system. TC4-(TiO2)n (n = 1–8) sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster models are established (Fig. S1, ESI† (B)) and the effects of different binding modes on the optical properties of the systems are tested.
TC4-(TiO2)6, which is the binding of the TC4 dye to the 3-fold-coordinated titanium (Ti3f), possesses the widest spectral response region (Chart S3, ESI†). Besides, 5-fold-coordinated titanium (Ti5f) from (TiO2)8 is one of the main forms existing for Ti in the titanium dioxide surface. Therefore, two typical models TC4-(TiO2)6 and TC4-(TiO2)8 are chosen for the future investigations regarding the excited-state properties and the detailed charge transfer features of the interface systems. Notice that the wavelengths of the tested two TC4-(TiO2)6 complexes in Chart S3, ESI† are equivalent in terms of the light harvesting. Herein, we just chose the one with a slightly shorter O–Ti junction bond length (1.96 Å vs. 1.97 Å). Fig. 1 gives the optimized structures of the selected two sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster systems TC4-(TiO2)6 and TC4-(TiO2)8. All the two interface systems belong to the non-dissociative adsorptions. One hydrogen atom binds to an oxygen atom of the cluster, forming the hydrogen bond. Fig. 2 is the absorption spectra of the two complexes, and the orbital energy levels are shown in Fig. 3. The maximum absorption wavelength of each complex system is red-shifted compared with that of the isolated TC4 dye molecule, which may be caused by the narrowed HOMO–LUMO gap of the sensitizer after being adsorbed onto the cluster. The narrowed energy gap is beneficial for the absorption spectra shifting to the longer wavelength direction. Accordingly, the largest center absorption wavelength at 481 nm in all established interface systems comes from TC4-(TiO2)6. For this complex, the dye molecule connects to the cluster through the O–Ti3f bond, forming a tetrahedral configuration with the other three coordinated oxygen atoms. And the length of its bridging O–Ti3f bond (1.95 Å) is shorter than that of TC4-(TiO2)8 (2.08 Å), which partly reflects a stronger intensity of the interaction between sensitizer and cluster. This can be sustained by the LUMO of the system in Fig. 4, where a clear electron density overlapping happens across the bridging O–Ti bond, contributing to the electron injection from the sensitizer to the cluster direction. Besides, the oscillator strength of TC4-(TiO2)6 (f = 2.1594) is larger than that of TC4-(TiO2)8 (f = 1.9597), indicating a better ability of light harvesting. Table 2 gives the excitation energy and oscillator strength of TC4-(TiO2)6. The first strong absorption band coming from S1 excited state corresponds to the charge transfer excitation from the HOMO to LUMO, which is from the triphenylamine unit to the π-conjugate bridge and cluster direction in Fig. 4. And this is beneficial for the electron injection from the organic sensitizer to the cluster. As for the TC4-(TiO2)8 complex, after the adsorption step, at its joining unit, the oxygen atom of the sensitizer competes with the inner coordinated oxygen atoms and draws the Ti5f atom far from the cluster. Because the Ti5f tends to form the approximate stable regular tetrahedral configuration with the oxygen of the carboxyl unit rather than forming the irregular pentahedron structure with the inner oxygen atoms of the cluster. This spatial change happened at the joining part of the system and may be one possible reason for the widening of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (see Fig. 3), leading to the blue-shift (maximum absorption wavelength 449 nm) of the absorption spectrum compared with that of TC4-(TiO2)6, and reducing the utilization of the solar energy. Thus it might be deduced that the low-coordinated Ti will avail the light absorption and the chemical adsorption for the dye molecule on the cluster. TC4-(TiO2)6 complex system exhibits better optical characteristics.

Transition density (TD) and charge density difference (CDD) methods help to understand the charge-transfer properties of the excited-state complex models. Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of TC4-(TiO2)6, and its visualized TD and CDD are shown in Fig. 5. From the TD distributions, the electron–hole pairs for the S1 excited state mainly exist on the dye molecule, indicating that the contribution for this strong absorption band mainly comes from the organic molecule. The general direction for the transition dipole moment is from the triphenylamine unit to the cyanoacrylate unit, which suggests the electron transfer direction for the S1 excited state. Concerned with the corresponding CDD distributions in Fig. 5, the hole density locates mainly on the triphenylamine unit, and the electron density locates mainly on cyanoacrylate and the top or even some inner atoms of the cluster after the electronic transition. This may imply the promotion effect of the cluster to the charge separation of the dye/titanium dioxide cluster interface system. Nevertheless, the S1 excited state, corresponding to the most intensive absorption peak in the UV-vis spectra, is a localized charge-transfer excited state, and the mixed hole–electron pairs spread on the π-conjugated bridge unit, which is in a certain extent unfavorable for the total hole–electron separation and electron transport from the sensitizer to the cluster. It is worth noticing that the S3, S4, S7 and S10 excited states of TC4-(TiO2)6 are all total charge-transfer excited states in spite of their weaker oscillator strengths. That means the hole density and the electron density spreads separately, without any mixture on the junction unit. This type of excited state might benefit the electron transferring to the cluster direction and then for the improvement of the DSSC efficiency. Taking S4 excited state as an example, whose oscillator strength (f = 0.0155) is the largest one during the four excited states. The electron density of S4 locates totally on the cluster after the light excitation, while the hole density is left only on the organic sensitizer (see Fig. 5), which is the desired situation that we expect. The configuration interaction (CI) expansion coefficient (with its weight percentage in the parenthesis) is also presented in Table 2, since each excited state is not a pure quantum state and can be expressed as a linear combination of several one-electron transition configurations. CI coefficients imply the leading HOMO–LUMO transition that is responsible for an excited state. Hence, only the dominant configuration for each excited state is given. With respect to the four excited states (S3, S4, S7 and S10), the leading transition configurations are H− > L + 1, H− > L + 2, H− > L + 3 and H− > L + 6, respectively. All the LUMOs (see Fig. 4) involved in the four total charge-transfer excitations are located on the titanium dioxide cluster. It could be rationally conjectured that the titanium dioxide cluster with a proper size or adsorption site (low-coordinated Ti) may help to increase the number of the total charge-transfer excited states, which is probably another subsidiary reason for the charge separation and transfer on the sensitizer/titanium dioxide cluster system TC4-(TiO2)6. Therefore, under the conditions of the presently known best dye sensitizers, one may improve the photo-electricity conversion efficiency of the DSSCs by modifying the semiconductor titanium dioxide electrode surface.

Conclusions
In this work, the optical properties of four organic dye molecules TC1–TC4 are theoretically studied. Solvent effect is proved to be an essential factor for the prediction of the absorption spectrum and the electron transfer process. TC4 molecule, with the largest absorption wavelength at 412 nm and the largest oscillator strength among the four sensitizers, shows a desirable photo-chemical property. In order to further understand the micro mechanisms of photoelectric conversion of a real DSSC, the systems of the organic sensitizer TC4 adsorbing onto titanium dioxide clusters are established, and the properties of the absorption spectra and the excited states are simulated. TC4-(TiO2)6 possesses the widest spectral response and the strongest light-harvesting intensity during all the dye/titanium dioxide cluster interface systems. This indicates that the binding of the sensitizer to the Ti3f of the cluster may lead to a stronger sensitizer–cluster interaction and a relatively narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gap, compared with the case of Ti5f. From the frontier molecular orbital and the 3D real-space analysis (TD & CDD) of the sample complex TC4-(TiO2)6, the importance of the titanium dioxide cluster in aspects of the absorption spectra band extension and the interfacial electron separation and injection is revealed. All the four total charge-transfer excited states of the sample complex TC4-(TiO2)6 mainly correspond to the unoccupied molecular orbitals located merely on the clusters. These may inspire us towards a certain direction on the future improvement of the performance of DSSCs. For example, decreasing the size of the titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the thin film electrode suitably enough by sol–gel coating, doping modification methods or other technical measures, to gain as many as possible low-coordinated Ti active sites.
