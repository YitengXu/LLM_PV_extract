1. Introduction
Developing renewable clean energy technologies is the focus of the 21st century. Solar energy, which is inexhaustible and environmentally friendly, is a good candidate. Especially, organic solar cells (OSCs) present some advantages, such as simple preparation, light weight, low cost, flexibility and large-area fabrication, and have attracted much attention in recent years.1–11
Many strategies have been employed to achieve higher power conversion efficiency (PCE), for example, designing and synthesizing new electron donor and electron acceptor materials with broad photon absorption and high mobility;12–17 employing versatile third components in the active layer to fabricate ternary blend OSCs;18–24 controlling the morphology of the active layer;25–31 using buffer layers between the active layer and electrodes;32–36 and designing and fabricating new device structures.37–42 As a result, OSCs exhibit PCEs of up to 11%43 for single junctions and 12%44 for tandem junctions in a small device area (<0.1 cm2).
Economic assessment of OSCs and silicon solar cells demonstrates that a competitive power output from OSCs can be reached if efficiencies of ca. 7% can be achieved in large area modules and if lifetimes of at least 5 years can be attained.45 Despite PCEs of ca. 7% (4 cm2)46 and ca. 5% (114.5 cm2)47 being achieved in a large device area, the insufficient stability will be the limiting factor for future industrial production.48–55 For example, Heeger et al.56 fabricated a conventional OSC with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer/aluminium (Al), but this device died after being stored in air for 25 h. Garcia-Belmonte et al.57 tested the stability of OSCs for over 8000 h (ca. 1 year) in a glove box and found a gradual reduction in efficiency from about 3% to 1.5%. Krebs et al.58 studied the stability of OSCs under continuous illumination (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) at 72 °C; after a 13000 h (ca. 1.5 year) test, the device preserved only 2% of its initial PCE. To achieve the goal of more than 5 year lifetime still remains a great challenge.
In this review, we focus our discussion on the factors limiting the stability of OSCs and recent developments in strategies to increase the stability of OSCs, especially on those accomplished in the last two years. Firstly, we summarize the factors that limit stability, such as metastable morphology, diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers, oxygen and water, irradiation, heating and mechanical stress. Then, we survey and analyze strategies to increase stability, such as material design, device engineering of active layers, employing inverted geometry, optimizing buffer layers, using stable electrodes and encapsulation. Finally, we propose the strategies to overcome the challenges in achieving high stability and the possible research directions in the near future.
2. Factors limiting the stability of OSCs
Different from the research environment in labs, there are a lot of factors that can limit the stability of OSCs in the real world. In this part, we discuss the factors that limit the stability of OSCs during their whole lives in terms of metastable morphology, diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers, oxygen and water, irradiation, heating and mechanical stress (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the factors limiting the stability of OSCs. 
2.1. Metastable morphology and diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers
An active layer is the key component of OSCs, in which there are generally two or three phases (the donor phase, the acceptor phase and the donor/acceptor mixed phase). Phase separation is always metastable due to the strong mobility of organic materials. Müller-Buschbaum et al.59 used micro-focused grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (μGISAXS) to probe the metastable morphology of a polymer/fullerene blend. They proposed a model of morphological degradation (Fig. 2): the donor domains drift apart from each other (smaller domains vanish whereas larger ones grow).

Employing high boiling point (BP) solvent additives in the active layer has been one of the main approaches in the last decade of OSC research. Although these solvent additives increase PCE, they decrease the device stability by forming a more unstable morphology of the active layer.60–64 Park et al.63 fabricated OSCs based on poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)-carbonyl]-thieno-[3,4-b]thiophene-diyl]] (PTB7)/[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC71BM) without or with 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (BP: 332 °C). After being stored in air for 300 h, devices without or with 3% DIO preserved 61% and 39% of the original PCEs, respectively. The excessively aggregated PC71BM in the DIO-assisted degraded film would block the formation of a suitable morphology which had enough donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces and bi-continuous networks.
Like the donor and acceptor materials, the electrodes and buffer layers also show mobility. As shown in Fig. 3, the indium (In) of ITO can diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS layer65 and the active layer;66 the Al can diffuse into the PEDOT:PSS layer67 and the active layer;68 and the PEDOT:PSS layer can also diffuse into the active layer.69 Such diffusion of metals and buffer layers will reduce the stability of OSCs by changing the energy levels of buffer layers and acting as the traps for charge recombination.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers. 
2.2. Oxygen and water
Oxygen can reduce the stability of OSCs (Fig. 4). Firstly, the metal electrodes (e.g. Al and calcium (Ca)) with a low work function (WF) can be oxidized by oxygen permeation. The electrically insulating metal oxide layer, which is formed between the electrode and the buffer layer or the electrode and the active layer, will create a transport barrier and eventually induce an S-shaped I–V curve and degrade the performance of the device.70 Secondly, the penetrative oxygen in the active layer takes part in the various photo-oxidation reactions of donor71 and acceptor materials.72 The changed structures of donor and acceptor materials will change their photon absorption, energy levels and charge carrier mobilities. Thirdly, the oxygen doping in the active layer can enhance hole concentration, which results in an increase of the density of deeper traps for electrons and a decrease of the fill factor (FF) and the open circuit voltage (VOC).73,74
 Fig. 4  Schematic diagram of the diffusion of oxygen and water. 
The ingress of water in the device is another important factor limiting the stability (Fig. 4). Water can diffuse into the device via the hygroscopic PEDOT:PSS buffer layer and metal electrodes with an activation energy of 42 kJ mol−1 (measured and calculated by Arrhenius relation).75 Firstly, water can damage the low WF metal electrodes as an oxidation agent.76 It was observed that large defects were appeared on the Al electrode after the exposure of water.77,78 These defects can act as pinholes to allow more ingress of water.79 Secondly, the ingress of water into the interface of the active layer and the electrode can form a insulating metal oxide interlayer, leading to a decrease of effective active layer/electrode interface area which is harmful to charge extraction.80 Thirdly, water diffusing into the active layer can move PC61BM and thus induce excessive aggregation of fullerenes. The larger scale of phase separation decreases the D/A interfaces, which is harmful to exciton dissociation and causes a huge reduction in device performance.81
In the real world, oxygen and water always simultaneously diffuse into the device and limit the stability.82–85 For example, Durrant et al.82 tested the stability of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3′,7′-dimethyl-octyloxy)]-1,4-phenylene vinylene (MDMO-PPV)/PC61BM solar cells in air. The device preserved only 20% and 60% of its original PCE after being stored in the dark for 8 h or irradiated for 3 h, respectively. In addition to MDMO-PPV/PC61BM solar cells, OSCs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/PC61BM are more widely used. Krebs et al.83 compared the stability of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells tested under different atmospheric conditions: dry nitrogen (water < 1 ppm, oxygen < 1 ppm), dry oxygen (water < 1 ppm, oxygen 100%), humid nitrogen (90 ± 5% relative humidity, oxygen < 1 ppm) and an ambient atmosphere (20 ± 5% relative humidity, 20% oxygen). After continuous illumination for 200 h, the devices with all structures (normal geometry, inverted geometry, roll-to-roll (R2R) processed inverted devices without or with simple encapsulation) tested in an ambient atmosphere (with water and oxygen) were always unstable (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Curves showing the degradation as a function of illumination time under different atmospheric conditions for device models with normal geometry (A) and inverted geometry (B) and R2R processed inverted devices without encapsulation (C) and with simple encapsulation (D).83 
2.3. Irradiation
A solar cell is a device that can convert light into electricity, but most of the representative OSCs are unstable upon irradiation. For example, MDMO-PPV/PC61BM-based solar cells maintained half PCE after continuous illumination for 22 h.86 Rand et al.87 investigated the photodegradation of devices with another two prototypical material systems, P3HT/PC61BM and poly(N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′ benzothiadiazole)) (PCDTBT)/PC71BM. After continuous illumination for 500 h, both of them showed insufficient stability, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM decreased from 3.4% to 1.9% while the PCE of PCDTBT/PC71BM decreased from 5.7% to 3.8%. In addition to different materials, the solar cells also showed poor stability during irradiation with different wavelengths of spectrum88 or different light intensities.89
The original reasons for the instability of the device upon irradiation are photochemical degradation and photophysical degradation in the active layer, the buffer layer and the active layer/electrode interface. The main photochemical degradation is photo-oxidation reaction in the active layer. Researchers proposed some possible photo-oxidation reactions of donors and acceptors.90–96 The reactions of three prototypical materials (MDMO-PPV,91 P3HT92 and polyfluorenes (PFs)96) are shown in Chart 1. These reactions in the active layer can induce some negative effects on device performance. Firstly, the changed structures of donor or acceptor materials decrease the photoabsorption, which is harmful to exciton generation.97 Secondly, these reactions will lead to the formation of sub-bandgap states of materials, which can increase the energetic disorder in the active layer and may reduce device performance by including Shockley–Reed–Hall recombination, reduced hole mobility and the build-up of space-charge in traps.98,99 Thirdly, these reactions can change the energy levels of donors and acceptors. Since the donor and acceptor components are not equally affected by these photo-oxidation reactions, a change in the alignment of the energy levels of the donor and the acceptor due to degradation is observed.100 Finally, these reactions lead to the formation of persistent radical cations on the polymer chain, leading to a ‘relaxed’ charge transfer state (polymer+–O2−) and thus affecting the performance of devices.101 In addition to photo-oxidation reactions in the active layer, photo-oligomerization of fullerene acceptors102 and photolysis of polymer donors91 are observed in the active layer, which are also responsible for the instability of OSCs upon irradiation. Photo-oxidation reactions can also occur in the buffer layer103 and the active layer/electrode interface.104

Besides photochemical degradation, which changes the structures of materials, photophysical degradation is another important type of photodegradation. Yang et al.105 and Adachi et al.106 concluded that photoinduced charge accumulation could be a severe problem resulting in photophysical degradation of solar cell performance. The energy diagram of OSCs and two trap sites in the interfacial region of the active layer are shown in Fig. 6a and b. The VOC was dependent on the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor when ohmic contacts were formed on both interfaces of the active layer/anode or cathode.107 After 8 h of illumination, photoinduced charge carriers (holes and electrons) accumulated in the two trap sites, inducing the alleviation of the energy band slope and resulting in a decrease of VOC (Fig. 6c).

The carriers, i.e., holes (open circle) and electrons (filled circle), are accumulated in two trap sites (dashed line). Alleviation of the energy band slope occurs, resulting in a decrease of VOC (ΔVOC).106 Reprinted with permission from ref. 106. Copyright 2009, Wiley. 
2.4. Heating
In the real world, the working temperature of solar cells is usually relatively high due to heating by continuous illumination. In the active layer, attributed to the highly conjugated structures of most donor and acceptor materials, the relative high working temperature is still far below the decomposition temperatures of most active materials.108–110 Thus, physical degradation is the main type of heating induced degradation in the active layer.
Heating induced physical degradation of polymer donor/fullerene acceptor blend is investigated as a model system. Polymers have been proved to show mobility to some extent, especially when the environmental temperature is higher than their glass transition temperature (Tg).111,112 For example, Lidzey et al.113 investigated the relationship between morphology and heating temperatures. The effect of different heating temperatures on the PCDTBT/PC71BM blend films was investigated and the optical microscopy images of these films are shown in Fig. 7. Below the Tg of PCDTBT (ranging from 100 °C to 145 °C under different conditions), the morphology barely changed (Fig. 7a and b), while coarse phase separation occurred in films when they were annealed at a temperature above 155 °C (Fig. 7c and d). The relationship between morphology and heating temperatures of other representative D/A blends of P3HT/PC61BM,114–116 poly[2,3-bis-(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline-5,8-diyl-alt-thiophene-2,5-diyl] (TQ1)/PC61BM117 and MDMO-PPV/PC61BM116 was also investigated, and similar results were obtained: the morphology of active layers became more unstable when the environmental temperature was higher than the Tg of polymers.

The scale bar in all images represents 20 μm.113 Reprinted with permission from ref. 113. Copyright 2012, Wiley. 
The enhanced mobility of polymers above Tg not only influences the aggregation states of polymers, but also can assist the heating induced fullerene aggregation and crystallization, which is another issue of physical degradation upon heating.118–121 Müller et al.119 studied the nucleation and growth of PC61BM crystals in the TQ1/PC61BM blend films. As shown in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 8a–c), both nucleation and growth were strongly diffusion limited at lower temperatures (approaching the Tg of the polymer). The growth rate exponentially increased with temperature and the nucleation rate displayed a maximum at around 150–170 °C, resulting in the highest rate of PC61BM crystallisation at these temperatures. In addition to the different heating temperatures, Kim et al.120 also investigated the relationship between fullerene aggregation/crystallization and different heating times. As shown in Fig. 8d–f, micrometer-sized PC61BM clusters began to appear after 5 min of thermal annealing at a high temperature of 150 °C. The number and the size of clusters gradually increased in the images as the annealing time increased. Heating induced many big size clusters (fullerene aggregation/crystallization) in the active layer which can sharply decrease the performance of OSCs due to inefficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer by decreased D/A interfaces. Besides the active layer, heating induced degradation can also occur at the active layer/electrode interface122 and the buffer layer.123

2.5. Mechanical stress
During the life cycle of OSCs, mechanical stress always exists. Stretchability and flexibility of the active components in OSCs are crucial for devices fabricated in a large-scale R2R manner.124 But unfortunately, major OSCs are unstable with mechanical stress.125–127
As shown in Fig. 9, mechanical stress can induce degradation in the active layer, the buffer layer and active layer/buffer layer interfaces. Firstly, the linear application of tension can induce strain of organic materials. After the linear application of tension (ε = 20%), devices based on P3HT/PC61BM preserved only ca. 50% of the original PCEs.128 Secondly, the decohesion process occurs when mechanical stress is not enough to fracture a layer, which can degrade the active layer and the buffer layer. These defects are likely to suffer from the ingress of water and become the centres of fracture. Dauskardt et al. found that the higher content of moisture128 and higher temperature129 could accelerate the decohesion rate. Thirdly, fracture of the active layer, the buffer layer and the interface between the active layer and the buffer layer is another mechanism of mechanical degradation.130,131 The fracture can happen under relatively low mechanical stress due to the low cohesion energy of the active layer and the buffer layer and the low adhesion energy of the interface between the active layer and the buffer layer.
 Fig. 9  Schematic diagram of the device under mechanical stress. 
In addition to the degradation of the active layer and the buffer layer under mechanical stress, mechanical stress induced degradation of electrodes will be another big problem when changing the substrates from glass to flexible materials.
3. Strategies to increase the stability of OSCs
In this section, we focus our discussion on the recent developments in strategies to increase the stability of OSCs, especially on those accomplished in the last two years. Mainly six types of strategies are included: material design of the active layer (molecular skeletons and side chains of donors, and fullerene/non-fullerene acceptors), device engineering of the active layer (ternary blends and processing methods), employing inverted geometry, optimizing buffer layers (hole/electron transport layers), using stable electrodes (new transparent/back electrodes) and encapsulation. To study the stability of OSCs, stress (such as air, light, heat and mechanical) is usually employed. In the real world, OSCs actually suffer from several types of stresses at the same time. To chart the stability of OSCs working in the real world, the international summit on OPV stability (ISOS) protocols were developed.132–141 There are three main ISOS protocols for OSCs: ISOS-1 in 2008 (Denver, USA), ISOS-2 in 2009 (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and ISOS-3 in 2010 (Roskilde, Denmark). Each ISOS protocol is composed of some more specific protocols (different combinations of test conditions: light source, temperature, humidity, etc.). In addition, each specific ISOS protocol has three different levels to meet the capabilities of a wider range of laboratories/groups. Furthermore, the reporting of device lifetime is also addressed in the ISOS protocols. The ISOS protocols are very important for OSCs' research and future industrial production. But so far, almost all literature studies related to the stability research of OSCs were published without ISOS protocols due to the insufficient promotion of these useful ISOS protocols. In this review, the photovoltaic properties of devices without and with the strategies before and after the stability tests are listed in Tables 1–10. In these tables, various test conditions are employed; “w” means “with”; “w/o” means “without”; “—” means “no data are available directly”; “modulus” is the modulus of the active layer; the photovoltaic parameters after stability tests are shown in brackets; “η/η0” is defined as the ratio of PCE after and before the stability test. In some literature studies, we can find PCE before the stability test and the ratio of PCE after and before the stability test or a figure of PCE vs. aging time but without PCE after the stability test. Thus, we provide the PCE before the stability test and η/η0 in tables without PCE after the stability test. The molecular structures of materials used in this review are shown in Charts 2–6.

3.1. Material design of the active layer

3.1.1. Molecular skeletons of donors. 
Rational design of the molecular skeletons of donor materials is an effective strategy to increase the stability of OSCs, such as substituting the oxidizable units with photo-oxidation stable units, controlling the crystallinity of polymers, adjusting the rigidity/flexibility of polymer chains, inducing the self-assembly of polymer chains and increasing the degree of polymerization of polymers (Fig. 10). The photovoltaic properties of devices with different molecular skeletons of donor materials before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 1, and the molecular structures of donor materials with different molecular skeletons are shown in Chart 2.

Substitution of the oxidizable units by photo-oxidation stable units can improve photo/air stability.142–147 For example, Krebs et al.143 tested and mapped the photo/air stability in air for a wide range of donor polymers. The rule-of-thumb photostability ranking of donor and acceptor units for donor polymers used in OSCs was mapped (Fig. 11). Based on this study, abandoning the exocyclic double bonds, quaternary carbon atoms and readily cleavable bonds (such as C–N or C–O) and using the aromatic polycyclic units in the molecular skeleton were recommended for enhancing the photo/air stability. Son et al.145 substituted the readily cleavable bonds (C–O) with aromatic polycyclic units. With the substitution of benzodithiophene (BDT) units by dithienothiophene (DTT) units in a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based donor polymer, the OSCs showed much better photo/air stability. After the stability test, the PCE of PDPPDTT/PC71BM solar cells preserved 80% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of PDPPBDT/PC71BM solar cells preserved only 50% of its original value.

Enhancing the crystallinity of donor polymers provides another approach to increased photochemistry stability.148–151 McGehee et al.148 tested the stability of OSCs based on the amorphous PCDTBT donor polymer and the crystalline KP115 donor polymer. The PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cell lost 16% efficiency after aging for 60 h, while the solar cell based on KP115/PC71BM lost only 5% efficiency. This work proposed that the spatial separation of electrons and holes in crystalline polymers may reduce a possibly trap-assisted recombination, while in amorphous polymers consisting of mostly mixed phases, the close spatial distance of electrons and holes may lead to increased non-geminate recombination. Unlike the crystalline donor polymer, which can enhance the photochemistry stability of OSCs, the amorphous polymer donor is a good choice for mechanical robustness of OSCs. Lipomi et al.152 demonstrated that decreasing the crystallinity of the donor polymer could increase the mechanical compliance of donor polymers without deleteriously affecting their optoelectronic properties. Random copolymerization of the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit flanked by two furan rings (DPP2F), thiophene (T) and bithiophene (2T) could create a new polymer donor PDPP2FT-seg-2T, which showed lower crystallinity compared with PDPP2FT. As a result, the tensile moduli of active layers were decreased from 2.76 to 1.60 GPa after changing the polymer donor from PDPP2FT to PDPP2FT-seg-2T which showed better stretchability.
In addition to decreasing the crystallinity of the donor polymer, increasing the flexibility of molecular skeletons also benefits the mechanical robustness. Bao et al.153 concluded that the fused rings in the molecular skeleton could decrease the flexibility of polymer chains, which was harmful to mechanical compliance. As shown in Fig. 12, after the infliction of a large strain of 20%, DPPT-TT/PC61BM blend film exhibited worse mechanical compliance compared with P3HT/PC61BM blend film due to the fused rings on its molecular skeleton. As a result, the PCE of DPPT-TT/PC61BM solar cells preserved only 20% of its original value after the large strain. Rigidity/flexibility of polymer chains not only affects the mechanical robustness, but also shows an obvious influence on thermal stability. Changing the relatively flexible units to relative rigid units of donor polymers can increase the rigidity of molecular skeletons, resulting in higher Tg of polymers (reduced mobility of polymers) which benefits the thermal stability.154 For example, PFs and F82T have relatively low Tgs of 72 °C155 and 80 °C,156 respectively. Insertion of rigid benzothiadiazole (BT) units into the molecular skeletons of PFs and F82T can significantly increase the Tgs to 135 °C (F8BT)157 and 123 °C (F8TBT),158 respectively. As a result, solar cells based on F8TBT/PC61BM exhibited good stability under heating.159

Block copolymerization which can induce the self-assembly of polymer chains is a valid strategy to increase thermal stability.160–162 For example, Dai et al.160 fabricated OSCs based on block copolymer (PPP-P3HT)/PC61BM blend which could form a well-defined double-channel-like structure. As shown in Fig. 13, due to the good miscibility between the amorphous PPP and PC61BM molecules (strong interaction between alkoxy side chains of PPP and PC61BM), the PPP-P3HT block copolymer could act as an effective structure-directing template for geometrical manipulation of PC61BM location. After continuous heating at 150 °C for 5 h, the PCE of PPP-P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved 88% of its original value due to the slower formation of PC61BM aggregations. By contrast, the short-circuit current density (JSC), FF and PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells decreased from 6.8 mA cm−2, 0.66 and 2.8% to 3.9 mA cm−2, 0.44 and 1.1%, respectively, after the stability test.

Unlike the strategies we discussed above (one strategy could only improve one type of stability), increasing the degree of polymerization of the donor polymer can simultaneously improve the photochemistry, thermal and mechanical stabilities.163–165 For example, Lee et al.163 improved the photochemistry stability of PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells by increasing the molecular weight (MW) of PCDTBT. Higher MW of PCDTBT could eliminate the trap-embedded fractions which significantly suppressed the photoactivated trap-width broadening and led to the almost absence of burn-in loss. As a result, the solar cells based on higher MW L-PCDTBT (59 kDa)/PC71BM blend exhibited much better photochemistry stability compared with the solar cells based on PCDTBT (21 kDa)/PC71BM blend. Wegner et al.164 investigated the relationship between Tg and the degree of polymerization. In line with the classical Fox-Flory equation, their results demonstrated that Tg could be increased by increasing the degree of polymerization, which was beneficial to achieving better thermal stability of OSCs. Dauskardt et al.165 investigated the relationship between mechanical robustness and the degree of polymerization. Increasing the MW of P3HT could increase intermolecular bonding and the probability of chain entanglement, leading to a greater degree of plastic deformation before cohesive failure occurred. As a result, the active layer cohesion values were as high as ∼ 17 J m−2 with a high MW P3HT (100 kDa)/PC61BM blend, which exhibited much better mechanical stability compared with that (1 to 2 J m−2) of a low MW P3HT (28 kDa)/PC61BM blend.


3.1.2. Molecular side chains of donors. 
Rational design of the molecular side chains of donor materials (employing cleavable side chains, regioregular (RR)/regiorandom (RRa) side chains, cross-linkable side chains, longer side chains, etc.) is also an effective strategy to increase the stability of OSCs (Fig. 14). The photovoltaic properties of devices with different molecular side chains of donor materials before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 2, and the molecular structures of donor materials with different side chains are also shown in Chart 2.
 Fig. 14  Schematic diagram of the strategies to design the molecule side chains of donor materials. 
Alkyl side chains facilitate the dissolution and assembly of the donor polymer, but once the devices have been fabricated, these alkyl side chains are actually useless and will limit the stability. Thus, modification of alkyl side chains to thermally cleavable side chains can simultaneously increase the thermal and photo/air stabilities.166–169 For example, Krebs et al.167 synthesized a donor polymer with thermally cleavable side chains (PhxSDT-DTZ). The solubilising side chains (ester groups with alkyl chains) on the dithienylthiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (DTZ) unit were thermally removable through ester elimination at around 200 °C which significantly decreased the mobility of the polymer donor. As shown in Fig. 15, the optical microscopic images of PhxSDT-DTZ/PC61BM films before and after thermal annealing at 150 °C indicated a high thermal stability. PhxSDT-DTZ/PC61BM films showed a homogeneous nature after heating for 96 h. In stark contrast, heating of a P3HT/PC61BM film induced a morphological change even after only 4 h. The same group168 also investigated the relationship between the photo/air stability and thermally cleavable side chains. Because the side chains were often attacked by reactive oxygen species, thermally cleaved side chains could avoid these photo-oxidation reactions and therefore increase the photo/air stability. By this strategy, the photo/air stability of P3HT was significantly increased.

Reducing the polymer regioregularity is another effective strategy to increase thermal stability.170–172 Fréchet et al.171 fabricated solar cells based on 96% RR P3HT/PC61BM and 90% RR P3HT/PC61BM, respectively. They concluded that the stronger driving force for crystallization of high-RR P3HT induced a larger extent of phase segregation, which could develop many large PC61BM crystals to the detriment of device performance. As a result, after the stability test, the PCE of 90% RR P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved 85% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of 96% RR P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved only 54% of its original value. However, reducing the polymer regioregularity is not a good choice for increasing the photochemistry stability.148,150 McGehee et al.148 compared the photochemistry stability of RRa P3HT/PC61BM and RR P3HT/PC61BM. The RRa P3HT/PC61BM solar cell lost 13% efficiency after aging for 60 h, while the solar cell based on RR P3HT/PC61BM lost only 5% efficiency. The better photochemistry stability of RR P3HT/PC61BM solar cells was attributed to higher crystallinity of RR P3HT which may reduce a possibly trap-assisted recombination.
Employing cross-linkable side chains, which can freeze the morphology of the active layer, to replace the alkyl side chains is a widely used strategy to increase the thermal stability. Notably, alkyl bromide (Br) functionalized side chains are most popular.173–178 There is a radical-based mechanism in this Br involved cross-linking reaction: homolytic cleavage of the carbon–bromine covalent bonds happens with direct exposure to 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) light,179 then cross-linking occurs with abstraction of a proton by the bromine radical from the side chains of adjacent polymers, followed by coupling of the alkyl radicals.178 For example, Fréchet et al.173 fabricated solar cells based on P3HT-Br10/PC61BM blend (P3HT-Br10 is a copolymer containing 10% of the cross-linkable brominated unit), which showed much better thermal stability compared to conventional devices utilizing a P3HT/PC61BM blend. As shown in the optical microscopy and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) (Fig. 16), no PC61BM crystallite was found in the cross-linked P3HT-Br10/PC61BM blend film after 24 h of annealing at 150 °C. As a result, the PCE of P3HT-Br10/PC61BM solar cells preserved 76% of its original value after the stability test. In contrast, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved only 28% of its original value. In addition to P3HT/PC61BM solar cells, this strategy can also be used in low-bandgap polymer/fullerene solar cells.178 Besides Br, other groups such as alkenyl,180,181 azide175 and oxetanes178 can also be used as reactive groups in cross-linkable side chains.

In addition to employing thermally cleavable side chains, controlling the polymer regioregularity and using cross-linkable side chains, employing other side chains can also increase thermal stability by introduction of non-covalent conformational locking,182,183 suppression of fullerene diffusion184,185 and optimization of the interface between active layer/electrodes.186,187 Woo et al.183 synthesized a polymer donor with non-covalent conformational locking to enhance thermal stability. Fluorine (F) side chains were introduced in the polymer (PPDT2FBT) to interact with sulfur (S) atoms and hydrogen (H) atoms. This interaction could lock the molecular conformation and decrease the mobility of the polymer. As a result, after continuous heating at 130 °C for 200 h, the PCE of PPDT2FBT/PC71BM solar cells preserved 89% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of PPDTBT/PC71BM solar cells preserved only 41% of its original value. Tierney et al.185 investigated the relationship between the side chains and PC61BM diffusion. As shown in Fig. 17, the aggregates of the polymer with linear alkyl side chains (PBDTDPP-2) were densely packed, which was likely to reduce the PC61BM diffusion rate by the increased diffused path. In contrast, aggregates of the polymer with linear alkoxy side chains (PBDTDPP-1) were not densely packed due to the rotational freedom and steric hindrance of the alkoxy side chains, which increased the PC61BM diffusion rates. Because the excessively aggregation of fullerene caused by continuous heating would decrease the efficiency, the PCE of PBDTDPP-2/PC61BM solar cells preserved 80% of its original value after heating, while the PCE of PBDTDPP-1/PC61BM solar cells preserved 65% of its original value. Maes et al.187 reported that the stability of OSCs under thermal stress was enhanced by the insertion of alcohol moieties on the side chains (PCPDTBT-2). A relative PCE of PCPDTBT-2/PC71BM up to 55% of its starting value could be maintained after 650 h at 85 °C due to the optimized interface of the active layer/top electrode, whereas the reference PCPDTBT-1/PC71BM device exhibited a relative PCE of only 26%.
 Fig. 17  Illustration of different formations of polymer aggregates based on backbone side chain distribution. In the BHJ these aggregates mediate the transport of PC61BM which can either pass through the aggregates or around them in a circuitous path.185 
Mechanical stability can be controlled by the side chain engineering of the donor polymer.188,189 Lipomi et al.188 investigated the relationship between the mechanical stability and the length of the alkyl side chains. As shown in Fig. 18, when the strain of 10% was applied, major cracks on the surface of the P3HT (C6 side chains)/PC61BM blend film could be observed (Fig. 18a); no cracks were observed for P3DDT (C12 side chains)/PC61BM (Fig. 18b). As a result, the P3DDT/PC61BM solar cell exhibited a similar PCE to its original value after the stability test. In contrast, the PCE of the P3HT/PC61BM solar cell preserved only 2% of its original value. Similar to the results of the strain test, the tensile modulus (0.47 GPa) of P3DDT/PC61BM was much lower than that of P3HT/PC61BM (2.02 GPa), which demonstrated that better stretchability of active layers could be achieved by increasing the length of the alkyl side chains of the polymer donor.

3.1.3. Fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors. 
Fullerene (C60, C70) and fullerene derivatives (PC61BM, PC71BM, indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA)) are widely used as electron acceptors in OSCs due to their ultrafast charge transfer at D/A interfaces, high electron mobility and good ability to form a favorable nanoscale network with donor polymers.190–193 However, the spheroidal structure of fullerenes not only improves the efficiency, but also reduces the stability. Under irradiation, the 2+2 cycloaddition between two fullerene moieties leads to the formation of dimers. Under heating, the dimers disappear, and the fullerenes easily diffuse and excessively aggregate to big clusters (crystallization). Dimerization can lead to very rapid losses in PCE over a short timeframe, and crystallization drives ultimate device failure.185 Thus, the main strategy of the design of photo/thermal stable acceptors is to avoid the dimerization and crystallization, including employing bigger side chains of fullerene, using bisadduct fullerene derivatives and introducing nonspherical structures (Fig. 19). The photovoltaic properties of devices with different acceptor materials before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 3, the molecular structures of acceptor materials are shown in Chart 3, and the molecular structures of donor materials are shown in Charts 2 and 4.
 Fig. 19  Schematic diagram of the strategies to design acceptors. 
 Chart 3  The molecular structures of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptor materials. 
Changing side chains of fullerene provides an opportunity to enhance the thermal stability of OSCs.194–196 For example, Jen et al.195 synthesized a triphenylamine (TPA)-substituted PC61BM as the acceptor material in OSCs. This alteration of the side chain from small size to big size broke the high symmetry degree of PC61BM and therefore decreased its crystallinity. As a result, no degradation in morphology and efficiency was found in the P3HT/TPA-PC61BM blend even after 10 h of heating at 150 °C.
In addition to change the side chains of fullerene, employing bisadduct fullerene derivatives as acceptors in OSCs is a more widely used strategy for increasing the stability.197–202 This strategy can simultaneously avoid the dimerization and crystallization of fullerene-based acceptors. For example, Guldi et al.197 investigated the photostability of PDTSTzTz/PC61BM and PDTSTzTz/bisadduct PC61BM (bisPC61BM) solar cells. After continuous illumination for 27 h, PDTSTzTz/PC61BM solar cells degraded rapidly due to the dimerization of PC61BM, which reduced charge carrier mobility (the PCE preserved 74% of its original value); while devices based on bisPC61BM, which was not prone to dimerization, exhibited almost no degradation (the PCE preserved 95% of its original value). The authors concluded that the steric hindrance from the two substituents was the most probable reason for the higher photostability of bisPC61BM compared to PC61BM. Wang et al.200 employed a dihydronaphthyl-based [60]fullerene bisadduct derivative NC60BA as an acceptor to increase the thermal stability of OSCs. As shown in Fig. 20, the well-proportioned morphology was maintained for the P3HT/NC60BA blend after heating at 150 °C for 20 h due to the amorphous nature of NC60BA. In contrast, uneven PC61BM crystals appeared in the P3HT/PC61BM case indicating that thermal-driven crystallization for PC61BM did exist. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/NC60BA solar cells preserved 85% of its original value after the stability test, while the PCE of reference P3HT/PC61BM solar cells decreased from 4.2% to 1.9%.

Using non-fullerene materials203–206 as acceptors in OSCs is a new strategy to increase photo- and thermal stabilities due to the nonspherical structure of these molecules.207–210 Zhan et al.207 reported OSCs based on polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T and non-fullerene small molecule acceptor DC-IDT2T. The stability of PBDTTT-C-T/DC-IDT2T and PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM devices was measured under continuous illumination and heating (75 °C), as shown in Fig. 21a. The PBDTTT-C-T/DC-IDT2T device showed much better stability (maintained 85% PCE after 180 h) relative to the PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM device (maintained only 50% PCE after 180 h). After the 180 h stability test, the light beam-induced current (LBIC) images of PBDTTT-C-T/DC-IDT2T films changed a little (Fig. 21b and c), suggesting little loss of current during the stability test. In contrast, the colour of LBIC images of PBDTTT-C-T/PC71BM films after the 180 h stability test became darker (Fig. 21d and e), which meant significant loss of current.

In addition to increasing photo/thermal stability, non-fullerene acceptors also show talent in increasing mechanical stability. Kim et al.211 fabricated OSCs based on polymer donor PBDTTTPD and polymer acceptor P(NDI2HD-T). As shown in Fig. 22a, the PBDTTTPD/P(NDI2HD-T) film showed much higher toughness relative to PBDTTTPD/PC61BM film due to its lower tensile moduli (0.43 GPa vs. 1.76 GPa) and much higher elongation (7.16% vs. 0.12%). Besides the tension test, the bending test also announced better mechanical stability of polymer/polymer film compared to polymer/fullerene film. As shown in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 22b and c), the apparent degradation was attributed to the crack propagation in the PBDTTTPD/PC61BM film by the mechanical deformation (Fig. 22b). In stark contrast, there was no change in the morphology of the PBDTTTPD/P(NDI2HD-T) film (Fig. 22c). The reason for better mechanical stability of polymer/polymer solar cells compared to polymer/fullerene solar cells was concluded: the polymer acceptor was intrinsically more ductile than fullerene and could better entangle with other polymer chains with strengthened interfaces.

3.2. Device engineering of the active layer

3.2.1. Ternary blend of a donor, an acceptor and a third component. 
Ternary blend OSCs consisting of a donor material, an acceptor material and a third component have received increasing attention in recent five years. Compared with binary blend, OSCs with a third component usually have higher PCE.212–216 In addition to PCE, employing a third component (such as a cross-linker, a modified fullerene derivative, a compatibilizer, an insulating polymer, nanoparticles and buffer layer materials) in the active layer can also increase the thermal/mechanical/photo/air stability of OSCs (Fig. 23). The photovoltaic properties of devices with different third components before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 4. The ratio of the third component described below is the weight ratio of third component in total weight of the donor, acceptor and third component in OSCs. The molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are shown in Chart 4 and the molecular structures of third components are shown in Chart 5.
 Chart 4  The molecular structures of other donor and acceptor materials used in this review. 
 Fig. 23  Schematic diagram of the strategies to add third components. 
 Chart 5  The molecular structures of third components used in the active layer. 
Cross-linkers can be used as the third components in the active layer to increase the thermal stability.217–219 For example, Wantz et al.218 introduced a bis-azide cross-linking reagent (BABP) as the third component in PTB7/PC61BM solar cells. BABP could react with PTB7 or PC61BM through two pathways: (1) upon heating or irradiation, BABP decomposed into nitrogen gas and a highly reactive nitrene, which could react randomly with both PTB7 and PC61BM; (2) upon heating at a lower temperature, BABP reacted with PC61BM through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to give triazolino(4′,5′:1,2) fullerenes, and subsequent heating at a higher temperature would result in a three-membered ring-functionalized fullerene. The cross-linking reaction between polymer/fullerene or fullerene/fullerene could stabilize the morphology of the active layer by preventing the fullerenes from diffusing and forming large crystallites (Fig. 24). After addition of 2% BABP, the PTB7/BABP/PC61BM device yielded a PCE of 4.60% after 16 h of heating at 150 °C, preserving 79% of its original value. In sharp contrast, the PCE of the device using PTB7/PC61BM blend decayed drastically to 16% after the stability test.

Fullerene derivatives also can be modified as cross-linkers and used as third components in the active layer to increase the thermal stability.220–223 Hsu et al.220 employed fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid styryl ester (PCBS) in P3HT/PC61BM blend as the third component. Cross-linking could happen between PCBS molecules by rapid polymerization (polyaddition of styrene moieties), thus suppressing the severe immigration of PC61BM. As shown in SEM cross-sectional images (Fig. 25), P3HT/PC61BM blend suffered severe phase segregation after heating at 150 °C for 25 h. In contrast, the P3HT/PCBS/PC61BM blend maintained well-defined nanomorphologies, which demonstrated that polymerization in the blends was capable of freezing the initially formed morphologies. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PCBS/PC61BM solar cells preserved 95% of its original value after the stability test, while the PCE of reference P3HT/PC61BM solar cells decreased from 4.1% to 0.7%. In addition to fullerene-based cross-linkers, fullerene derivatives also can be modified and used as the third components in the active layer to control the crystallization process of fullerene acceptors.224–229 McCulloch et al.226 concluded that the addition of modified fullerene dimer (PCB)2C2 to the PCDTBT/PC61BM active layer could lead to enhanced thermal stability. The dimer could suppress the nucleation of PC61BM, which was an effective route to suppress the excessive aggregation and crystallization of fullerene. As a result, the PCE of PCDTBT/(PCB)2C2/PC61BM solar cells preserved 90% of its original value after the stability test. In contrast, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC61BM solar cells preserved 75% of its original value. On the other hand, Müller et al.228 used C60 as the third component in TQ1/PC61BM blend. C60 was able to efficiently help the formation of large numbers of small fullerene crystal nuclei which could block the growth of crystal nucleus to harmful micrometer-sized fullerene crystals. Therefore, solar cells based on C60-nucleated active layers displayed significantly enhanced thermal stability. In addition to thermal stability, fullerene derivatives also can be modified and used as third components in the active layer to increase the mechanical stability. For example, Lipomi et al.230 employed PC71BM in P3HT/PC61BM blend as the third component to increase the mechanical stability of OSCs. They proposed that the mixing of PC61BM and PC71BM could change the aggregate states of P3HT and decrease the crystallinity of P3HT, which would increase the stretchability of the active layer and thus increase the mechanical stability of OSCs. As a result, the tensile moduli of active layers were decreased from 4.37 to 1.53 GPa after the addition of PC71BM as the third component.

Employing compatibilizers as third components in the active layer is an effective strategy to simultaneously increase the thermal and mechanical stabilities of OSCs.231–235 For example, Kim et al.233 employed a compatibilizer P3HT-g-P2VP in P3HT/o-xylenyl C60 bis-adduct (OXCBA) blend as the third component. The addition of P3HT-g-P2VP effectively modified the sharp interface between P3HT and OXCBA and decreased the surface energy of D/A interfaces. As a result, the P3HT/OXCBA device with 3% P3HT-g-P2VP exhibited a PCE of 4.7% even after 72 h of heating at 150 °C, which showed much better thermal stability than that of the control device. In addition, the solar cells with 3% P3HT-g-P2VP exhibited higher fracture energy and lower tensile modulus, showing enhanced mechanical stability than that of the control device. Using an insulating polymer as the third component in the active layer is another strategy to simultaneously increase the thermal and mechanical stabilities of OSCs. Stingelin et al.236 demonstrated that up to 50 wt% of the insulating polymer (high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or isotactic polystyrene (PS)) could be used as third components in P3HT/PC61BM solar cells. The addition of an insulating polymer could increase the thermal stability and mechanical stability by impeding diffusion of the lower molecular weight species (fullerene acceptor) and increasing the toughness of the active layer.
In addition to thermal stability and mechanical stability, air stability237–239 and photo/air stability240,241 can also be increased by employing third components in the active layer. For example, Jo et al.237 added fullerene-end-capped poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-C60) in the P3HT/PC61BM blend. As shown in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles (Fig. 26a and b), near the interface between Al and the active layer, the intensity of the oxygen (O) signal was weaker than that of the S signal (Fig. 26a), whereas in the sample with PEG-C60 added, the intensity of the O signal was stronger than that of the S signal (Fig. 26b). Considering that the O signal arose from PEG and PC61BM while the S signal arises only from P3HT, the results of XPS depth profiles demonstrated that PEG-C60 molecules migrated to the top surface of the P3HT/PC61BM active layer and induced segregation of PC61BM near the top surface (Fig. 26c). Since the PEG-C60 layer could protect the active layer from oxygen penetration, the air stability of OSCs was improved. Stratakis et al.241 employed Al nanoparticles (NPs) in PCDTBT/PC71BM blend as the third component. Energy from the polymer triplet excitons excited singlet oxygen, which reacted with the polymer chains to form exciton trap states. The Al NPs embedded into the blend acted as quenchers of the triplet excitons, and in this way, the photo-oxidation process could be impeded (Fig. 27). This quenching was possibly due to the overlap of the excitonic levels with the plasmon resonance of the embedded Al NPs. As a result, the PCE of PCDTBT/Al NPs/PC71BM OSCs preserved 50% of its original value after irradiation in air (45 h). In contrast, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC71BM OSCs preserved 35% of its original value.

3.2.2. Processing methods. 
Optimization of processing methods of the active layer can increase the air stability, photostability and thermal stability of OSCs. As shown in Fig. 28, strategies can be employed in all processing steps including solution preparation, film forming and post treatment to increase the stability. The photovoltaic properties of devices using different processing methods before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 5, and the molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
 Fig. 28  Schematic diagram of the strategies of processing methods. 
Solution preparation is the first step in the fabrication of the active layer, and some strategies can be employed in this step to increase the photo/air stability and thermal stability.242–246 For example, Park et al.242 investigated the photo/air stability of OSCs with different D/A ratios of 1:0.6 and 1:1 (P3HT/PC61BM by weight), respectively. As a result, the OSCs with the 1:1 P3HT/PC61BM showed better photo/air stability due to the lower donor content in OSCs which could reduce the photochemical degradation from the formation of oxidized species in the donor polymer. Jeong et al.244 fabricated nanofibril-based OSCs by subjecting P3HT/PC61BM solution to cyclical cooling and heating processes (Fig. 29a). As shown in SEM and TEM images (Fig. 29b and c), P3HT nanofibrils showed dense networks which were much less permeable to oxygen, and hence the photochemical degradation of P3HT by photo-oxidation in air could be delayed considerably as compared with P3HT in the control device. After exposing the photoactive layer to sunlight for 10 h in air, the PCE of nanofibril-based P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved 56% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of control P3HT/PC61BM solar cells decreased from 3.0% to 0.5% after the stability test. Yang et al.245 fabricated P3HT/PC61BM OSCs using 1,8-octanedithiol (OT) and chlorobenzene (CB) as processing solvent, respectively. The PCEs of these two devices were similar, but photo/air degradation in OT processed films was much more severe than CB processed films. The PCE of CB processed OSCs preserved 35% of its original value after irradiation in air (0.5 h). In contrast, the PCE of OT processed OSCs decreased to 0%. The films made from OT started with a higher concentration of defects, making them more susceptible to photo/air degradation. The increased energetic disorder suppressed the carrier hopping, which enhanced the charge recombination. In addition to photo/air stability, the change of solvent is also a good strategy for achieving better thermal stability. Moulé et al.246 showed that the choice of processing solvent had a significant effect on the thermal stability of OSCs. Since o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) had a higher BP compared to CB, the presence of trapped solvent (residual ODCB) in the OSCs would increase the diffusive mobility of PC61BM within the polymer matrix, and promote the growth of larger PC61BM crystals. Thus, OSCs processed by CB exhibited better thermal stability than that of ODCB processed OSCs.

(b) SEM and (c) TEM images show the nanofibril-based photoactive film with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network of well-dispersed P3HT nanofibrils and PC61BM molecules.244 Reprinted with permission from ref. 244.

The second fabrication step of the active layer is film formation. Cabral et al.247 fabricated PCDTBT/PC61BM blend films by wire bar coating, instead of spin coating. Both wire bar coating and spin coating solar cells yielded similar initial performance. However, the wire bar coated solar cells exhibited improved device thermal stability than spin coated solar cells (measured over 1000 h of heating at 80 °C). The increased thermal stability of wire bar coated solar cells stemmed from enhanced PC61BM segregation towards the top interface during deposition, which was likely due to the longer film drying timescale.
Post treatment is the last step in the fabrication of the active layer, and thermal stability as well as photo/air stability can be increased by some strategies employed in this step.248–253 For example, Durrant et al.249 employed modest illumination on the active layer to induce the oligomerization of PC61BM. The oligomerization of PC61BM (dimer) could suppress the nucleation of PC61BM, and thus significantly suppressed the excessive aggregation and crystallization of PC61BM. As shown in Fig. 30, illumination was employed to PS/PC61BM, PCDTBT/PC61BM, PTB7/PC61BM, P3HT/PC61BM and DPP-TT-T/PC61BM blends, respectively. After continuous heating, a lot of fullerene crystals appeared on the samples without modest illumination, but on the samples with modest illumination, no obvious fullerene crystals appeared. As a result, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC61BM solar cells with modest illumination preserved 85% of its original value after the stability test. In contrast, the PCE of the control device preserved only 64% of its original value. Tsai et al.251 employed the post treatment of low temperature drying to increase the thermal stability of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells. The low drying temperature (−5 °C) could enhance the nucleation of P3HT crystallites as well as minimize separation of the P3HT and PC61BM phases. The enhanced P3HT crystal network served as an immobile frame upon heating. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells upon low temperature drying preserved 50% of its original value after the stability test (long period of 1368 h). In contrast, the PCE of the control device preserved only 16% of its original value. McNeill et al.252 used alcohol treatment to improve the photo/air stability of high-efficiency poly[[2,6′-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]dithiophene]3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7-TH)/PC71BM solar cells. The introduction of alcohol treatment after the spin coating of the active layer induced the fast deposition of the active layer, and prompted removal of residual DIO from the active layer. Removal of the residual DIO inhibited ingress of oxygen into the active layer, leading to enhanced photo/air stability compared to that of the control device.

3.3. Employing inverted geometry
For OSCs with conventional geometry, a low WF cathode, which is easily attacked by oxygen and water, is always located at the exposed surface (no ITO protection) of the active layer. To overcome the bad air stability of conventional OSCs, inverted geometry that the positions of the anode and the cathode are changed was developed. The photovoltaic properties of devices with conventional and inverted geometries before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 6, and the molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
Employing inverted geometry is an efficient strategy to significantly increase the air stability of OSCs.254–273 For example, Choulis et al.260 fabricated inverted OSCs based on ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO)/P3HT/PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/silver (Ag). Compared with the conventional OSCs based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/PC61BM/ZnO/Al, the inverted OSCs exhibited much better air stability. The PCE of inverted P3HT/PC61BM solar cells preserved 95% of its original value after storage in air for 1 h. In contrast, the PCE of the conventional OSCs preserved only 20% of its original value. Also based on the P3HT/PC61BM active layer, Yang et al.261 compared the air stability of inverted geometry and conventional geometry. The structures of inverted and conventional OSCs were ITO/titanium oxide (TiOx) /P3HT/PC61BM/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/Ag and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT/PC61BM/Ca/Ag, respectively. As a result, the conventional P3HT/PC61BM solar cell lost 100% efficiency after aging for 48 h, while the solar cell based on inverted geometry lost only 5% efficiency. In addition to P3HT/PC61BM solar cells, employing inverted geometry also enhances air stability in high-efficiency low band-gap donor/PCBM solar cells and small molecule OSCs. Chang et al.263 fabricated inverted and conventional OSCs based on PTB7/PC71BM which was one of the most widely used active layers. After being stored in air for 48 h, the PCE of inverted PTB7/PC71BM solar cells preserved 95% of its original value, while the PCE of the conventional OSCs preserved only 30% of its original value. Brabec et al.265 synthesized a new star-shaped small molecule donor N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3, and compared the air stability of inverted and conventional OSCs based on N(Ph-2T-DCN-Et)3:PC71BM. As a result, the PCE of inverted OSCs preserved 70% of its original value after storage in air for 360 h. In contrast, the PCE of the conventional OSCs preserved only 5% of its original value. These studies changed the positions of the anode and the cathode and substituted the low WF electrode with a high WF electrode on the top surface of the active layer. This inverted geometry is more stable than conventional geometry due to less reactivity of the top electrode with oxygen and water.
In-depth research for the much better air stability of inverted geometry compared to conventional geometry was also carried out. Akimoto et al.266 investigated the charge dynamics of SubPc/C60 planar solar cells with conventional and inverted geometries during the degradation in ambient air. As shown in Fig. 31, the features of transient photocurrent of the conventional device were ascribed to the aggravation of trap (deteriorated bathocuproine (BCP)) mediated recombination with increasing aging time. In contrast, for inverted structure, the trap mediated recombination was significantly suppressed, indicated by the absence of the transient peak after turn-on and pulse intensity dependent turn-off traces in the transient photocurrent. The active layer and the BCP layer were well protected from penetration of oxygen and water by the air stable MoO3 layer. As a result, for the conventional devices, it only took 44 h for the PCE to decay to 16% of its initial value. In contrast, the PCE of the inverted devices preserved 89% of its original value after storage in air for 96 h. Yoo et al.267 carried out a separate experiment to investigate the air degradation of OSCs. The microscopy images of ITO/MoOx/PCDTBT/PC71BM/TiOx/Al, ITO/TiOx/PCDTBT/PC71BM/MoOx/Al, TiOx/Al and MoOx/Al after aging of 100 h are shown in Fig. 32. It was found that the formation of the bubble-like features, which reduced the charge collection at the Al electrode, was linked to the presence of hydroxyl groups in the TiOx layer (electron buffer layer). In contrast, the inverted OSCs with MoOx did not exhibit bubble-like features, attributed to the much better air stability than that of the conventional OSCs.

3.4. Optimizing buffer layers

3.4.1. Hole transport layers. 
PEDOT:PSS is the most widely used hole transport layer, while it is seriously unstable with air or mechanical stress. In addition, PEDOT:PSS suffers from its strong acidity (pH = 1–2), which will etch the ITO electrode increasing the movability of In. Employing modified PEDOT:PSS, metal oxide, graphene oxide (GO) and organic/polymer materials to replace PEDOT:PSS can significantly increase the stability (Fig. 33).274–276 The photovoltaic properties of devices with different hole transport layers before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 7. The molecular structures of hole transport layers are shown in Chart 6, and the molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
 Fig. 33  Schematic diagram of the strategies to optimize the hole transport layers. 
 Chart 6  The molecular structures of buffer layers. 
Modification of the PEDOT:PSS layer with the addition of various components (such as polymer additives, solvent additives, metal oxides and nanoparticles) is an effective strategy to increase the air stability.277–283 For example, Kim et al.282 added PS NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a three-dimensionally continuous minor phase via the formation of a monolayer self-assembled from 60 nm PS NPs. After the addition of PS, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer was maintained indicating that a continuous PEDOT:PSS film was successfully formed with PS NPs. As a result, the P3HT/OXCBA solar cells with the PEDOT:PSS layer lost 45% efficiency after aging for 120 h, while the solar cells based on the PEDOT:PSS layer with PS NPs lost only 14% efficiency. Zhang et al.283 developed a hole transport layer by in situ formation of MoO3 in PEDOT:PSS solution (MoO3–PEDOT:PSS). As shown in the LBIC images (Fig. 34), the device with the MoO3–PEDOT:PSS layer exhibited much better air stability than the device with the PEDOT:PSS layer, due to the less hydroscopicity of MoO3. After storage in air for 240 h, the PCE of TQ1/PC71BM solar cells with the MoO3–PEDOT:PSS layer preserved 80% of its original value. In contrast, the reference solar cells with the PEDOT:PSS layer almost died.

In addition to the modification of the PEDOT:PSS layer, employing other materials to replace the PEDOT:PSS layer is another effective strategy to increase the air stability. Metal oxides such as MoOx,284–286 nickel oxide (NiOx),287,288 vanadium pentoxide (V2O5),289 tungsten oxide (WOx),290 copper oxide (CuO)291 and ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4)292 are promising candidates. Heeger et al.285 fabricated PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells with MoOx as the hole transport layer. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, MoOx exhibited superior long-term air stability, due to its less hydroscopicity and better inoxidizability. As a result, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells with the MoO3 layer preserved 50% of its original value after storage in air for 860 h. In contrast, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells with the PEDOT:PSS layer preserved only 5% of its original value. So et al.287 employed NiOx as the hole transport layer in pDTG-TPD/PC71BM solar cells. Similar to MoOx, NiOx also showed low hydroscopicity and good inoxidizability as the nature of metal oxides. Therefore, the NiOx based devices degraded much slower than the PEDOT:PSS based devices. In addition to metal oxides, metal sulfides293 and polyoxometalates (POMs)294,295 can also be used to substitute the PEDOT:PSS layer to increase air stability.
GO is also introduced as the hole transport layer for better air stability.296–300 Ouyang et al.298 used GO to substitute PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells. GO exhibited stable structure (less diffused ability) and low hydroscopicity, which were beneficial to achieving good air stability. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the GO layer preserved 75% of its original value after the stability test. In contrast, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the PEDOT:PSS layer preserved only 5% of its original value. In addition to inorganic materials, organic materials also can be used to substitute the PEDOT:PSS layer for increasing air stability.301,302 Lee et al.301 introduced an organic small molecule 4-phenothiazin-10-yl-anisole (APS) as the hole transport layer of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells. APS was highly air stable compared with PEDOT:PSS, due to its neutral PH and low hydroscopicity. The OSCs fabricated with APS maintained a PCE of 2.8% (preserved 76% of its original value) after 2400 h of stability tests in air, while the reference device based on PEDOT:PSS almost lost its efficiency after 2400 h of ambient exposure.
Mechanical stability is another challenge for the PEDOT:PSS layer, and some strategies have been introduced to optimize the hole transport layer for better mechanical stability.303–306 For example, Kim et al.304 added PS NPs to the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells. The PS NPs acted as the binders in the PEDOT:PSS domains which can increase the fracture toughness of the hole transport layer. As a result, the adhesion energy of the PEDOT:PSS layer was increased from 2.2 J m−2 to 3.4 J m−2 with the addition of PS NPs, indicating that the addition of PS NPs to PEDOT:PSS can increase the mechanical stability. Lipomi et al.305 discovered that the addition of zonyl fluorosurfactant and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) into the PEDOT:PSS layer can significantly improve the mechanical compliance without decreasing PCE. As shown in Fig. 35, the PEDOT:PSS layer with zonyl and DMSO can suffer large strain (≈20%) and exhibit good mechanical robust during cyclic bending.

3.4.2. Electron transport layers. 
Lithium fluoride (LiF) or Ca and ZnO are the most widely used electron transport layers in conventional geometry and inverted geometry, respectively. LiF or Ca is unstable in air due to their reactivity with oxygen and water. On the other hand, ZnO is unstable with air and light. In order to significantly increase the stability, metal oxide, stable metal, electron transport polymers and modified ZnO can be employed instead of LiF, Ca and ZnO (Fig. 36).307,308 The photovoltaic properties of devices with different electron transport layers before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 8. The molecular structures of electron transport layers are shown in Chart 6, and the molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
 Fig. 36  Schematic diagram of the strategies to optimize the electron transport layers. 
Employing metal oxide, stable metal and electron transport polymers to replace LiF and Ca can increase the air stability.309–313 For example, Xu et al.309 fabricated OSCs with chromium oxide (CrOx) as the electron transport layer. The CrOx layer was much more air-stable than LiF, and could function as a protective layer to significantly enhance the device stability by blocking the diffusion of oxygen and water. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the CrOx layer preserved 69% of its original value after storage in air for 48 h. In contrast, the reference solar cells with the LiF layer almost died. Yang et al.313 used an anionic surfactant SDS to modify the cationic PTMAHT polyelectrolyte and employed the PTMAHT:SDS blend as the electron transport layer of OSCs. After storage in air for 12 h, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the PTMAHT:SDS layer preserved 75% of its original value, while the PCE of the reference solar cells with the Ca layer only preserved 30% of its original value. The results suggested that the electrostatic complexion between PTMAHT and SDS provided an effective method to achieve the moisture/water-resistant electron transport layer, which could increase the air stability.
In addition to LiF and Ca used in conventional geometry, ZnO used in inverted geometry can also be modified to achieve better air stability. Firstly, the chemical composition of ZnO can be modified.314,315 Zheng et al.314 employed Zn1−xMgxO (ZMO) as the electron transport layer of PTB7-TH/PC71BM solar cells. Compared with the control device with the ZnO electron transport layer, the ZMO-based OSCs exhibited better air stability, which could be attributed to the fact that the wide bandgap ZMO could serve as a good moisture/oxygen scavenger to protect the device against degradation in air over a long period (1 year). Secondly, the fabrication method of ZnO film can be modified.316–318 Zhang et al.317 employed ethanedithiol (EDT) to treat the surface of ZnO film. Solar cells with EDT ZnO (E-ZnO) exhibited better air stability due to the passivated surface defects. The EDT molecule could remove various surface groups (–COO and –OH) and form a covalent bond with ZnO film. The excellent passivation made the ZnO films less susceptible to oxygen and water molecules. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the E-ZnO layer preserved 96% of its original value after being stored in air for 720 h. In contrast, the reference solar cells preserved only 68% of its original value. Thirdly, ZnO film can be modified by various buffer layers.319–324 Qiao et al.319 modified the ZnO layer by inserting a poly-ethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) layer. After half a year of ambient exposure, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the ZnO/PEIE layer preserved 88% of its original value. In contrast, the PCE of reference OSCs with the ZnO layer decreased from 4.0% to 2.3% after the stability test. As shown in Fig. 37, the ZnO device exhibited higher current density than the fresh sample at low bias, due to the oxygen-induced trapped states which could increase the probability of trap-assisted recombination. Contrastively, the ZnO/PEIE device maintained small current density at low bias after the stability test. The PEIE layer could passivate the ZnO layer and suppress the oxidation of the ZnO layer which was the reason for the increased air stability. In addition to the modification of ZnO, the substitution of ZnO by the electron transport polymer (such as PEI and DPP-based polymers) is another strategy to increase the air stability.325–327

Insufficient photostability is another shortcoming of OSCs with the ZnO layer.328–333 Olson et al.329 employed phosphonic acids (PAs) to modify the interface of the ZnO layer. The chemical nature of the ZnO surface exhibited the influence on device photostability, specifically the presence of interstitial zinc (Zni) defects at the surface which can absorb oxygen and induce the photo-oxidation reaction of the adjacent organic active layer. PA modification of the ZnO layer could eliminate or passivate these defects. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/ICBA solar cells with the PA-modified ZnO layer preserved 73% of its original value after illumination for 640 h, whereas the reference solar cells preserved only 38% of its original value. Wu et al.330 modified the surface of the ZnO layer with an ultrathin layer of Al. The diode parameters suggested that the reference solar cells with the ZnO layer experienced a dramatic increase in their reverse saturation current upon illumination due to a decrease in the barrier height. The device with the Al modified ZnO layer experienced a much less change in its diode parameters before and after photoaging, due to its lower surface WF and deeper valence band maximum. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with the ZnO/Al layer preserved 82% of its original value after illumination for 8 h. In contrast, the reference solar cell preserved 69% of its original value.

3.5. Using stable electrodes
ITO and Al are the most widely used transparent electrode (TCE) and back electrode in OSCs, respectively. However, they are seriously unstable with mechanical stress, irradiation and air. Employing transparent materials (such as metal and alloy, metal nanowire, graphene, polymer and modified ITO) instead of ITO and stable metals (such as Ag, gold (Au) and Cu) instead of Al can significantly increase the stability (Fig. 38).334,335 The photovoltaic properties of devices with different transparent/back electrodes before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 9, in which the ΔR/R0 is defined as the change in the sheet resistance after the stability test/resistance before the stability test. The molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
 Fig. 38  Schematic diagram of the strategies to use stable electrodes. 
Employing stable metal and alloy,336–339 metal nanowire (NW)340–342 and modified metal NW343–350 as the transparent electrode is an effective strategy to increase the mechanical stability. For example, Yun et al.339 fabricated flexible PTB7-F20/PC71BM solar cells with the ZnO/AgOx TCE on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. As shown in Fig. 39a, the ΔR/R0 of the electrodes was measured as a function of the bending radius when the electrodes were exposed to high compressive stresses induced by mechanical bending of the PET substrates. The ZnO/AgOx electrode exhibited small resistance changes of 1.33% even after being bent with a bending radius of 2.8 mm. However, ΔR/R0 of the reference ITO electrode dramatically increased to 35% at the same bending radius, as a result of the formation and propagation of microscopic cracks in a direction perpendicular to the compressive load (Fig. 39b). Thus, employing the ZnO/AgOx electrode instead of the reference ITO electrode could increase the mechanical stability of flexible OSCs. Kang et al.341 used more soft Ag NWs as the transparent electrode to replace ITO. After being bent 1000 times with a bending strain of ∼2.0%, the Ag NW electrode showed only a slight increase in the ΔR/R0 (3.3%), whereas that of the reference ITO electrode dramatically increased (68.8%). As a result, the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM solar cells with the Ag NW electrode preserved 98% of its original value after 1000 bending cycles. In contrast, the reference solar cells with the ITO electrode preserved only 22% of its original value. In addition to directly using Ag NWs as the electrode, modified Ag NWs as the electrode are also used. Kim et al.345 created a flexible electrode based on the conductive polymer (CP)–AgNW composite which was fully embedded in colorless polyimide (cPI). Fig. 40 shows the ΔR/R0 in response to outward (tensile stress) or inward (compressive stress) bending as a function of the bending radius. The (CP)-AgNW/cPI electrode exhibited good mechanical stability (only a small increase (<10%) in resistance when it was bent to a radius of 40 μm). PTB7-TH/PC71BM solar cells based on this composite electrode therefore offered a very stable performance, with a PCE loss of not more than 5% when it was folded at a radius of 40 μm. This high mechanical flexibility originated from the enlarged interfacial area between AgNWs and cPI, and good adhesion of cPI to the CP and AgNWs. Lee et al.350 fabricated a AgNW–graphene hybrid TCE by dry-transferring a CVD-grown monolayer graphene onto a AgNW TCE. Within the first few bending cycles with a bending radius of 30 mm, the ITO TCE began to crack, resulting in a sharp increase in sheet resistance. In contrast, the sheet resistance of the AgNW–graphene–polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) TCE remained unchanged after more than 10000 bending cycles with the same bending radius, indicating that the AgNW–graphene hybrid TCE exhibited excellent mechanical flexibility.

Besides stable metal based materials, graphene351,352 and PEDOT:PSS353,354 also can be used as transparent electrodes to increase the mechanical stability. For example, Zheng et al.352 fabricated a graphene-based composite transparent electrode to replace ITO and used in OSCs. After 1000 bending cycles, only ca. 5% increase in the resistance of the graphene-based TCE was observed, and no cracks appeared. In contrast, the resistance of the traditional ITO TCE increased rapidly under bending due to crack formation.
In addition to mechanical stability, photostability355,356 and air stability357–360 also can be increased by using a stable transparent electrode. For example, Katz et al.355 used Ag as the transparent electrode instead of ITO. The efficiency of the devices with the Ag electrode remained almost unchanged for 1000 h with illumination (preserved 96% of its original value). In contrast, the reference solar cells with the ITO electrode preserved only 28% of its original value. The solar cells with the Ag electrode exhibited much better photostability due to the avoiding unstable ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface. Curran et al.360 investigated the degradation mechanism of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface and the Ag/PEDOT:PSS interface under ambient conditions. As shown in Fig. 41, the rapid and continuous degradation of ITO based devices was a result of obvious and continuous migration of In into the PEDOT:PSS layer. However, for the Ag/PEDOT:PSS interface, no more Ag migrated into the PEDOT:PSS layer except the small amount of initial oxidized Ag, since Ag was very difficult to oxidize (the electrochemical potential of Ag: ). Thus it was convinced that Ag was more stable than ITO under ambient conditions.

Similar to the substitution of transparent electrodes, using stable metals (such as Ag, Au and Cu) instead of Al as back electrodes is an effective strategy to increase the air stability.35,361–365 For example, Kim et al.362 replaced the back electrode Al with air stable Ag. The PTB7/PC71BM solar cells with Ag exhibited higher PCE than the reference solar cells with Al (8.0% vs. 7.1%). More importantly, Ag based devices exhibited better air stability due to the low reactivity of Ag with water or oxygen. As a result, the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM solar cells with the Ag back electrode preserved 96% of its original value after being stored in air for 170 h. In contrast, the reference solar cells with the Al back electrode preserved 75% of its original value. Emrick et al.35 employed Au as the back electrode of PTB7-TH/PC71BM solar cells. Thanks to the new and effective electron buffer layer which could lower down the WF of the Au/active layer interface, the device exhibited a high PCE of 8.6% which was the highest report for OSCs with the Au back electrode. After being stored in air for 24 h, the Au covered OSCs showed outstanding air stability (preserved 99% of its original value).
3.6. Encapsulation
Employing organic, inorganic and organic–inorganic complex materials to encapsulate OSCs is an effective strategy to increase the air stability. The photovoltaic properties of devices with different encapsulation materials before and after the stability tests are listed in Table 10. The molecular structures of donor and acceptor materials are also shown in Chart 4.
Organic materials can be used for encapsulation of OSCs.366–369 Würfel et al.366 employed epoxy resin to encapsulate OSCs. Completely flexible devices maintained >90% of their initial device performance after 1000 h. The good air stability of the encapsulated flexible OSCs was attributed to the similar coefficient of thermal expansion of these organic materials, which was beneficial for good adhesion between different layers. In addition to organic materials, inorganic materials also can be used as the encapsulation layer.370–374 For example, Martorell et al.370 designed a transparent multilayered MoO3/MgF2 (ML-ST) to encapsulate the OSCs (Fig. 42). The thick inorganic multilayer could provide efficient isolation from oxygen and water, which contributed to good air stability. As a result, the PCE of PTB7/PC71BM solar cells with multilayered MoO3/MgF2 preserved 60% of its original value after being stored in air for a long period of 3500 h. In contrast, the reference solar cells almost died. Park et al.372 used the reduced GO (rGO) to encapsulate PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells. The rGO encapsulation layer could act as an efficient gas barrier with a very low permeability of 3.65 × 10−4 g mm m−2 day−1. After being stored in air for 24 h, the PCE of PCDTBT/PC71BM solar cells with rGO encapsulation preserved 95% of its original value, while the reference solar cells preserved only 7% of its original value.

In this particular case instead on a glass substrate, the structure was grown on a doped-silicon substrate to avoid charging effects during the SEM scanning.370 Reprinted with permission from ref. 370.

Organic–inorganic complex materials can be used as the encapsulation layers of OSCs. Epoxy resin and glass is the most popular partner.375–378 Watkins et al.375 encapsulated the OSCs by using epoxy and glass. Epoxy resin was an effective and widely used UV photocuring resin, and glass was cheap. After the simple encapsulation, the air stability of OSCs was obviously increased. However, the process of glass/UV resin encapsulation usually brought additional mechanical stress to OSCs, and the solvent of resin would damage the active layer. In order to avoid this additional mechanical stress and the adverse solvent effect, other organic–inorganic complex encapsulation layers were employed.379–381 For example, Jang et al.381 developed a solution process encapsulation method: coating the ZnO layer on top of the back electrode and subsequently drop coating UV resin (Fig. 43). The ZnO buffer layer was used to minimize the damage from acetone in UV resin film and the thermosetting properties of UV resin. As a result, the PCE of P3HT/PC61BM solar cells with ZnO/UV resin encapsulation preserved 80% of its original value after being stored in air for 636 h, while the reference solar cells almost died.

4. Summary and outlook
This review discussed the factors that limit the stability of OSCs during their whole lives in terms of metastable morphology, diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers, oxygen and water, irradiation, heating and mechanical stress. More importantly, this review highlighted the recent developments in strategies to increase stability of organic solar cells (a polymer donor/fullerene acceptor is used as the model system and shown in Fig. 44):
 Fig. 44  Schematic diagram of the strategies to increase stability. 
(I) Strategies to increase photo- or photo/air stability: employing cleavable side chains and photo/air stable units on the polymer; increasing polymer crystallinity and decreasing fullerene crystallinity; decreasing defects/traps in the active layer; and decreasing oxygen permeation to the active layer.
(II) Strategies to increase air stability: decreasing oxygen permeation and water ingress into the active layer; using electrodes which exhibit low reactivity with oxygen and water; employing charge transport layers with good inoxidizability, low hydroscopicity and neutral PH; and changing the device geometry.
(III) Strategies to increase thermal stability: decreasing fullerene crystallinity; increasing Tg of the polymer; employing a cross-linkable polymer/fullerene or adding a cross-linker; removing residual solvents in the active layer; and forming a stable D/A interface and an active layer/electrode interface.
(IV) Strategies to increase mechanical stability: increasing polymer flexibility and entanglement but decreasing polymer crystallinity; forming a stable D/A interface; increasing layer/layer adhesion; and increasing the flexibility of encapsulated materials.
In order to achieve high-efficiency and high-stability OSCs for future industrial manufacture, some research areas of device stability may deserve further attention in the future: (a) in-depth investigation of the device degradation mechanisms with oxygen, water, irradiation, heating and mechanical stress; (b) setup and promotion of uniform standards of stability tests, e.g. ISOS protocols; (c) design of a polymer donor with balanced crystallinity/amorphism and rigidity/flexibility to simultaneously increase photo/air, thermal and mechanical stabilities; (d) increasing the PCE of OSCs based on the polymer with cleavable side chains and photo/air stable units; (e) using non-fullerene acceptors instead of PCBM for better photo/air, thermal and mechanical stabilities; (f) increasing the PCE of OSCs without high BP solvent additives and thermal or solvent annealing; (g) employing advanced encapsulation technologies in OSCs. So far, OSCs have already exhibited the PCEs of exceeding 10%, and increasing the stability of OSCs will provide a great opportunity to realize future industrial manufacture.

 	Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the factors limiting the stability of OSCs.	 

 	Fig. 2  Simulated and measured short-circuit current. Black squares represent the relative short-circuit current as theoretically expected from the time-dependent morphology probed by μGISAXS. The red line indicates the measured normalized short-circuit current density. Error bars are estimated from the error in the structure parameters. (a–c) Visualisation of the inner film morphology at the different times stated above as generated during the Monte-Carlo simulation. The images represent an excerpt of 2.5 μm × 2.5 μm. The red circles represent the domains of a pure material. The green cylinder walls represent, together with the red core, the active area of the solar cell where absorbed photons contribute to charge carrier generation. Photons absorbed in the blue phase do not contribute. (d) Unit cell of a square lattice as assumed for predicting the theoretical values of the normalized short-circuit current density.59 Reprinted with permission from ref. 59. Copyright 2013, Wiley.
