    , Accepted 3rd January 2017First published on 3rd January 2017AbstractThe utilization of a metal cocatalyst is a promising route to improve the solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of semiconductor-based photocatalysts. The efficiency of the improvement is greatly dependent on the architectural structure of the metal cocatalysts, especially the catalytically active sites on the surface of the cocatalysts. In this article, Pd nanosheets with different sizes have been hybridized with TiO2 nanosheets to disclose how the edge of Pd cocatalysts influences the photocatalytic performance of TiO2–Pd hybrid structures in the reduction of CO2 to fuels. It was found that the highest photocatalytic activity was realized by small Pd nanosheets with the highest edge density on the TiO2 nanosheets. The reason is that the edges of the nanosheets act as the highly active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction. To further verify the edge-dependent photocatalytic performance, Pd nanorings were also deposited on the TiO2 nanosheets, which further improve the photocatalytic activity as compared with original nanosheets resulting from the additional edge sites exposed on the side of the hollow interior in the rings. This work underlines the importance in the edge engineering on the surface of cocatalysts in realizing high-performance photocatalytic applications.
Introduction
Under the current situation of the depletion of fossil resources and global warming caused by the emissions of CO2, the sustainable conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals has attracted much attention.1,2 Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 using solar energy represents the most attractive route through mimicking natural photosynthesis.3,4 So far, semiconductor-based photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to fuels has been widely studied, in which the photogenerated electrons drive the transformation of CO2 and H2O to CO, CH4, HCOOH, etc.5,6 Various semiconductors, such as TiO2,7 ZnGa2O4,8 ZnGe2O4,9 CeO2,10 W18O49,11 and C3N4 (ref. 12), have been developed as photocatalysts in the CO2 reduction reaction. However, their photocatalytic performance is greatly limited by the serious electron–hole recombination in the semiconductor as well as low activation ability of the reactants on the semiconductor surface.13,14 The combination of cocatalysts with semiconductors is a promising approach to enhance the photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction.15 The cocatalysts not only trap the photogenerated electrons from the semiconductor in promoting the electron–hole separation, but also serve as the catalytically active sites in the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules.16,17 Recently, metal cocatalysts such as Pt,18 Pd,19 Au,20 and Ag21 have been used to enhance the photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction.
In spite of the efforts, the activity of the semiconductor–cocatalyst hybrid photocatalysts is still limited by the low adsorption and activation ability of the stable CO2 molecules, while the side or back reactions greatly decrease the selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction.22 For instance, resulting from the high H2O molecule activation ability of the metal cocatalyst, the reduction of H2O to H2 is a preferential or competitive process during the CO2 reduction process.23 Optimizing the architectural structure of the cocatalyst and increasing the density of reaction active sites on the surface is an effective approach to maximize the activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction and increase the solar-to-chemical energy conversion efficiency for practical applications.15,24 For instance, in our previous report, a tetrahedral Pd cocatalyst with (111) facets exhibited higher photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction in comparison with the cubic one with (100) facets.18 Owing to the different chemical environments, a large number of low-coordinated atoms on the edge sites are more active than atoms on the other parts of the surface in catalytic reactions.25 For example, the edges of MoS2 nanosheets are high catalytically active sites for H2 evolution reaction,26,27 and the edges of Pt3Ni nanoframes greatly boost the catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction.28 Thus the optimization of edge structures of cocatalysts is a promising method to enhance the photocatalytic performance.
Herein, we demonstrate that photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction can be promoted through increasing the density of edge sites on the Pd cocatalysts. In this work, Pd nanosheets in different sizes were deposited on the TiO2 nanosheets to form TiO2–Pd hybrid structures. It was found that the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of the hybrid structures in the CO2 reduction reaction increased with the decrease in the size of Pd nanosheets. With the same loading amount of Pd nanosheets, the reduction in the size of Pd nanosheets increases the edge density and boosts the number of catalytically active sites. The edge-dependent photocatalytic mechanism was further verified by the enhanced photocatalytic performance on the Pd nanoring cocatalyst with further incremental edge density in comparison with Pd nanosheets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example highlighting the importance of edge design on the cocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic performance.
Experimental
Chemicals
Palladium(II)acetylacetonate (Pd(acac)2, Aladdin, P101065), tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)6, Alfa Aesar, 43205) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, MW ≈ 29000, Aldrich, 234257) were used in the synthesis. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The water used in all experiments was de-ionized (DI). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of TiO2 nanosheets
The TiO2 nanosheets were synthesized by modifying a method in the literature with hydrofluoric acid as a capping agent.29Caution! Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and toxic, and should be handled with extreme care.
Synthesis of TiO2–Pd nanosheets
The TiO2–Pd nanosheets (TiO2–Pd NSs) were synthesized with the self-assembly of presynthesized Pd nanosheets onto the TiO2 nanosheets. The Pd nanosheets were synthesized according to a previous protocol.30 In a typical synthesis of Pd nanosheets in middle size (average edge length of 19.9 nm), 16 mg of Pd(acac)2, 30 mg of PVP, 60 mg of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and 10 mg of citric acid were dissolved in 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and stirred for 1 h. The resulting solution was then transferred to a 50 mL three-neck flask, and subsequently 100 mg of W(CO)6 were then added into the flask under an Ar atmosphere. Then the reaction was allowed to proceed at 80 °C for 1 h. The product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with acetone and ethanol several times to remove excessive PVP. The as-obtained Pd nanosheets were re-dispersed in ethanol with determined Pd concentration. The Pd nanosheets in small size (average edge length of 10.2 nm) were synthesized under the same experimental conditions as the Pd nanosheets with middle size except using 100 mg of citric acid instead of 10 mg of citric acid. The Pd nanosheets in large size (average edge length of 39.6 nm) were synthesized with Pd nanosheets in middle size as seeds. In a typical synthesis, a quarter of the as-synthesized middle Pd nanosheets, 8 mg of Pd (acac)2, and 50 mg of PVP in 10 mL of DMF were mixed in a 50 mL flask. Subsequently, 50 mg of W(CO)6 were added into the flask under an Ar atmosphere. The flask was capped and heated at 60 °C for 4 h. The deposition of Pd nanosheets on TiO2 nanosheets was achieved by ultrasonic treatment of the mixed aqueous suspension of Pd nanosheets and TiO2 nanosheets, followed by a hydrothermal treatment. In a typical process, 20 mg TiO2 nanosheets were dispersed in 20 mL water through sonication. Subsequently, 100 μL suspension of Pd nanosheets (10 mg mL−1 in water) was added into the dispersion. The mixture was further sonicated for 10 min, which was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 80 °C for 1 h. After the autoclave had cooled down to room temperature, the resultant product was separated by centrifugation, washed with acetone once and water three times, and dried at 45 °C in a vacuum.
Synthesis of TiO2–Pd nanorings
The TiO2–Pd nanorings (TiO2–Pd NRs) were also synthesized with the self-assembly of presynthesized Pd nanorings onto the TiO2 nanosheets. The Pd nanorings were prepared according to a previous protocol with Pd nanosheets as precursors.31 The Pd nanorings in small size (average edge length of 9.9 nm) were synthesized by mixing a quarter of the as-synthesized small Pd nanosheets, 2 mg of Pd(acac)2, 50 mg of ascorbic acid (AA), 50 mg of CTAB, and 50 mg of PVP into 10 mL of DMF in a 50 mL flask. Subsequently, the flask was capped and heated at 80 °C for 6 h. After the reaction, the product was collected by centrifugation, and washed with acetone and ethanol several times, and then redispersed in ethanol with determined Pd concentration. The Pd nanorings in middle size (average edge length of 19.7 nm) were also synthesized under the same experimental conditions as small Pd nanorings except using the as-synthesized middle Pd nanosheets as the seeds in the presence of 100 mg CTAB. The deposition of Pd nanorings on TiO2 nanosheets was achieved by the same method except the use of Pd nanorings (10 mg mL−1 in water) instead of Pd nanosheets.
Sample characterization
Prior to electron microscopy characterization, a drop of the aqueous suspension of particles was placed on a piece of carbon-coated copper grid and dried under ambient conditions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken on a JEOL JEM-2100F field-emission high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed with a Veeco DI Nanoscope MultiMode V system. Powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Philips X'Pert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an ESCALab 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, using nonmonochromatized Al-Kα X-ray as the excitation source. UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance data were recorded in the spectral region of 200–800 nm with a Cary-7000 Series UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a HITACHI F-7000 spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm. The molar ratios of Pd to TiO2 were measured as follows: the TiO2–Pd samples were dissolved in a mixture of HCl and HNO3 (3:1, volume ratio), which was then diluted with 1% HNO3. The concentrations of Pd were then measured with a Thermo Scientific PlasmaQuad 3 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). The weight ratios of Pd to TiO2 were determined by sample weighing prior to the dissolution of Pd for the ICP-MS measurements. The carbon dioxide sorption isotherms were measured by using an automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Micromeritics ASAP 2020).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
3.0 mg as-synthesized products were dispersed in a mixture of 10 μL ethanol and 10 μL Nafion, which were then uniformly spin-dropped onto a 1 cm × 1 cm indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass. Subsequently, the ITO-coated glass was heated at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h. The photocurrents were measured on a CHI 660D electrochemical station (Shanghai Chenhua, China) under ambient conditions under irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (Solaredge 700, China). UV light was used as the illumination source, which was realized in the presence of a short-wave-pass 400 nm cutoff filter. The power density of UV light was measured to be 2.7 mW cm−2. A standard three-electrode setup was used with the ITO coated glass as the photoelectrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The three electrodes were inserted into a quartz cell filled with 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Na2SO4 electrolyte was purged with Ar for 30 min prior to the measurements. The photoresponse of the prepared photoelectrodes (i.e., I–t) was operated by measuring the photocurrent densities under chopped light irradiation (light on/off cycles: 60 s) at a bias potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 400 s. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the 10−1 to 105 Hz frequency range with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV at an applied potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction measurements
CO2 photocatalytic reduction was typically conducted in a 100 mL reactor purchased from Perfect Light Company (China, Beijing). To remove possible trace organic contaminants, all the samples were treated at 160 °C for 3 h in air. In a typical process, 15 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed on a flat glass plate on the bottom of the reactor. And 2 mL of H2O was added and surrounded the plate. The reactor loaded with catalysts was first purged with high purity CO2 for 30 min. The pressure of CO2 was regulated to 0.15 MPa. Then the light-irradiation experiment was performed by using a 300 W Xe lamp with UV light as the illumination source. The power density of UV light (λ < 400 nm) was measured to be 2.7 mW cm−2. The photocatalytic reaction was typically performed for 4 h. During the irradiation, 1 mL gas was sampled from the glass chamber at given time intervals (1 h). The amount of products evolved was determined using gas chromatography (GC-2014, Ar carrier, Shimadzu). The H2 and O2 were determined using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The CH4 was measured by using a flame ionization detector (FID). The CO was converted to CH4 by using a methanation reactor and then analyzed by using the FID. During the stability test, the photocatalysts were collected after each run and then reused for the reduction of CO2. The catalyst was heat-treated at 160 °C for 3 h after the runs before its reuse. The photocatalytic measurement under visible light irradiation was performed by following the same procedure under UV light irradiation except using both a 400 nm long-wave-pass cutoff filter and a 780 nm short-wave-pass cutoff filter with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 instead of a short-wave-pass 400 nm cutoff filter.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of TiO2–Pd NSs samples
The engineering begins with the choice of monocrystalline TiO2 nanosheets as a semiconductor model, which was prepared through a hydrothermal method according to the previous literature.29 The edge length of the as-prepared TiO2 nanosheets is larger than 100 nm, and the average thickness is below 10 nm (Fig. S1a and b†). According to the size, the area percentage of the top and bottom flat surface is over 90%. The large flat surface of the TiO2 nanosheets facilitates the loading of cocatalysts in various dimensions, and the low thickness shortens the distance of photo-induced electron transfer to the cocatalyst in reducing the electron–hole recombination in TiO2.32,33 According to the XRD pattern (Fig. S2†), the as-obtained TiO2 nanosheets are in the anatase phase (JCPDS 21-1272). As revealed by the HRTEM images (Fig. S1c and d†), the flat surface of TiO2 nanosheets is exposed with (001) facets.
In the second step, Pd nanosheets in different sizes were presynthesized and deposited on the flat surface of TiO2 nanosheets, followed by an annealing treatment through a hydrothermal process (Fig. S3† and 1a, e and i). The work function of anatase TiO2 (≈4.9 eV) is smaller than that of Pd (≈5.1 eV), ensuring the photogenerated electron transfer from TiO2 to Pd.34 As indicated by TEM images (Fig. 1b, c, f, g, j and k), hexagonal Pd nanosheets in large, middle and small sizes are uniformly distributed over the TiO2 nanosheets to form different TiO2–Pd NS hybrid structures, which were named as TiO2–Pd NSs-L, TiO2–Pd NSs-M and TiO2–Pd NSs-S, respectively. The Pd nanosheets in TiO2–Pd NSs-L, TiO2–Pd NSs-M and TiO2–Pd NSs-S have a relatively narrow size distribution with an average edge length of approximately 39.6, 19.9 and 10.2 nm, respectively (Fig. S4†). From the TEM images of TiO2–Pd NSs samples with a standing-up TiO2 nanosheet (Fig. 1d, h and l), it could be clearly seen that the TiO2 and Pd nanosheets are combined through face-to-face contact. The large TiO2–Pd interfacial area guarantees the smooth electron flow from TiO2 to Pd.35 Moreover, in spite of the different sizes, the thickness of the deposited Pd nanosheets is 1.1 nm for all the TiO2–Pd NSs samples (Fig. 1d, h and l and S3†), which was also confirmed by the AFM images (Fig. S5†). The HRTEM image of TiO2–Pd NSs-M in Fig. 2a confirms that the Pd nanosheets are single crystals with (111) facets exposed on the top and bottom surface, revealing the formation of the TiO2(001)–Pd(111) interface. Also illustrated by the HRTEM image in Fig. 2b, the side faces of the Pd nanosheets are (111) stacking faults (or twin planes) along the vertical direction.36 The loading amounts of Pd nanosheets on the TiO2 nanosheets were kept the same for the three samples, which were confirmed by the ICP-MS (Table S1†).

The phase and composition of the as-obtained TiO2–Pd NS sample were characterized by the XRD pattern and XPS spectra, respectively. As shown in the XRD pattern of TiO2–Pd NSs-M (Fig. S2†), besides the peaks of anatase TiO2, the additional peaks are assigned to the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pd (JCPDS 65-2867). The survey XPS spectrum indicates the Ti, O and Pd elements in the TiO2–Pd NSs-M sample (Fig. 3a). In the high-resolution Ti 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b), the peaks with binding energies of 459.0 eV and 464.7 eV are attributed to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for Ti(IV) of the titania, respectively. The peaks located at 530.0 eV and 531.6 eV in the high resolution spectrum of O 1s (Fig. 3c) are assigned to O–Ti of TiO2 and O–H of adsorbed OH groups on the TiO2 surface, while the binding energies of 335.0 eV (Pd 3d5/2) and 340.3 eV (Pd 3d3/2) are in good agreement with the zero-valent Pd in the Pd 3d spectrum (Fig. 3d).37

Charge kinetics, photocatalytic performance and related mechanism of TiO2–Pd NSs samples
The light absorption ability of the TiO2–Pd NSs samples was investigated by UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra with bare TiO2 nanosheets as a reference sample. As shown in Fig. 4a, TiO2–Pd NSs samples exhibit comparable light absorption with TiO2 in the UV light range (λ < 400 nm), revealing that the intrinsic bandgap of TiO2 is not changed during the formation of TiO2–Pd NS hybrid structures. Furthermore, the TiO2–Pd NSs samples exhibit apparently stronger light absorption in the visible light range in comparison with bare TiO2, which results from the plasmonic band of the Pd nanosheets.38 Given the comparable UV light absorption capability of the TiO2-based samples in generating photo-induced electron–hole pairs, the electron–hole separation ability can be reflected by the photocurrent.39Fig. 4b shows that the photocurrents of TiO2–Pd NSs samples are much larger than that of bare TiO2 under UV light irradiation, suggesting that Pd nanosheets can trap the electrons from TiO2 to promote the electron–hole separation. Moreover, the TiO2–Pd NSs samples display a nearly equivalent photocurrent response, indicating the approximate electron capture ability of Pd nanosheets in different sizes in realizing the equivalent electron–hole separation efficiency. This statement is also supported by the EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 4c). The TiO2–Pd NSs samples show an approximate arc radius, indicating the comparable efficiency of interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 nanosheets to Pd nanosheets.40 The PL spectra are also consistent with the observation in photoelectrochemical measurements. As depicted in Fig. 4d, after the decoration of Pd nanosheets, the PL intensity of TiO2 is substantially quenched for the TiO2–Pd NSs samples, indicating that the radiative electron–hole recombination in TiO2 has been suppressed resulting from the electron extraction by Pd nanosheets. In addition, the quenching degree of the PL intensity is the same for the TiO2–Pd samples, corresponding to the similar electron trapping ability of the Pd nanosheets in different sizes.

Having confirmed the charge kinetics of the TiO2–Pd NSs samples, we further investigated their photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction under UV light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity was measured in a gas-closed quartz reactor with high purity CO2 and H2O reactants for 4 h. The gas products were continually taken from the reactor for quantitative analysis at a given interval (1 h). H2, CO and CH4 were found to be the products for CO2 reduction, while O2 was also detected as the product of H2O oxidation. Control photocatalytic experiments under the same conditions but in the absence of a CO2 atmosphere or photocatalysts were also performed, in which no carbonaceous product was detected. The yields of H2, CO and CH4 as functions of irradiation time are shown in Fig. 5. For all the tested samples, the product yield increases upon the prolonged light irradiation. Compared with bare TiO2, the yields of H2, CO and CH4 for all the TiO2–Pd NSs samples are increased, revealing the cocatalyst role of Pd nanosheets in the photocatalytic reaction. Furthermore, different yields of products were obtained for Pd nanosheets in different sizes. Although there are minute differences in H2 production (Fig. 5a), the CO and CH4 yields were found to be in the order of TiO2–Pd NSs-L < TiO2–Pd NSs-M < TiO2–Pd NSs-S (Fig. 5b and c). The TiO2–Pd NSs-S achieves the highest average production rate of CO (12.6 μmol g−1 h−1) and CH4 (3.0 μmol g−1 h−1) during the 4 h reaction. As a result, the photocatalytic selectivity of TiO2–Pd NSs-S (ca. 54.6%) for CO2 reduction is significantly higher than those of TiO2–Pd NSs-L (ca. 35.1%) and TiO2–Pd NSs-M (ca. 40.4%), which is calculated through the equation according to the numbers of electrons required to produce CO, CH4, and H2:Selectivity (%) = [2ν(CO) + 8ν(CH4)]/[2ν(CO) + 8ν(CH4) + 2ν(H2)] × 100%where ν(H2), ν(CO) and ν(CH4) stand for the average formation rates for H2, CO and CH4, respectively. It should be noted that the TiO2–Pd NSs samples exhibit higher photocatalytic activity in the first hour. This stagnation effect may be attributed to the lack of oxidation cocatalysts or sacrificial agent to consume the holes. Owing to the lower O2 evolution ability on the surface of TiO2, with the prolonged reaction time, the accumulated holes in the TiO2 could preclude the further transfer of electrons to Pd cocatalysts through charge recombination.41–43

To further analyze the photocatalytic mechanism of the above experimental results, the surface and interface structures the TiO2–Pd NSs samples were studied, which maneuver the charge kinetics as well as the photocatalytic performance.44,45 Considering the identical thickness of Pd nanosheets as well as their same loading amount on the TiO2 nanosheets, the TiO2–Pd NSs samples with different sizes of Pd nanosheets have the same TiO2–Pd interfacial contact area for charge transfer. As shown in Table 1, the ratio of the TiO2–Pd interfacial area to Pd volume (Sinterface/VPd) was calculated to be 0.91 nm−1 for the three samples, which provides a good explanation for the comparable efficacy of interfacial electron transfer from TiO2 to Pd. With the approximative light absorption and electron transfer ability, the different adsorption and activation abilities of CO2 molecules on the different Pd nanosheets may contribute to the distinct photocatalytic performance. However, for the Pd nanosheets in different sizes, the exposed area of the flat surface on the top and bottom is nearly the same. For the three samples, the exposed flat surface area-to-volume ratios of Pd nanosheets (Sflat surface/VPd) are also 0.91 nm−1 (Table 1). Also the same Pd(111) facet is exposed on the flat surface of Pd nanosheets. The only difference between the Pd nanosheets is the density of edge. As one larger Pd nanosheet can be cut into several smaller Pd nanosheets through forming more edges, with the same loading amount of Pd on the TiO2 nanosheets, the edge density of smaller nanosheets is much higher than that of larger ones. As shown in Table 1, the edge area-to-volume ratio (Sedge/VPd) of Pd nanosheets increases from 0.06 nm−1 for TiO2–Pd NSs-L to 0.12 nm−1 for TiO2–Pd NSs-M, and then to 0.23 nm−1 for TiO2–Pd NSs-S. The different edge densities of Pd nanosheets may contribute to the different photocatalytic performance with the reason that the edges of the nanosheets act as the highly active sites for the CO2 reduction reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 6, from TiO2–Pd NSs-L to TiO2–Pd NSs-M, and then to TiO2–Pd NSs-S, the edge density of Pd nanosheets increases doubly; thus the number of catalytically active sites on the edges of Pd cocatalysts is boosted for improved photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction. The result was further confirmed by the CO2-adsorption behaviors of the TiO2–Pd NSs samples at 298 K. The TiO2–Pd NSs-L, TiO2–Pd NSs-M and TiO2–Pd NSs-S exhibit CO2 uptakes of 0.81, 0.93 and 1.07 cm3 g−1 at pressures of 1.0 bar, respectively (Fig. S6†). The enhanced adsorption amount of CO2 with the increased edge density confirms that the edges of the Pd nanosheets are beneficial for the adsorption of CO2 molecules. On the other hand, considering the same exposed area and facet of Pd nanosheets as well as the approximate H2 yield in different TiO2–Pd NSs samples, the flat surface of Pd nanosheets may be the reactive sites for H2O reduction.

 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic mechanism of TiO2–Pd NSs samples in the CO2 reduction reaction. 
Considering the plasmonic absorption of Pd nanosheets in the visible region, the “hot” electron generated in Pd nanosheets may also be injected into the conduction band of TiO2 in driving the CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation (Fig. S7a†).46,47 As shown in Fig. S7b,† CO and H2 can also be produced by TiO2–Pd NSs samples under visible light irradiation, but the yields are much lower as compared with those under UV light irradiation, which was also observed in other reports with UV excitable semiconductor supported plasmonic metal as the photocatalyst.48,49 The reason is that the “hot” electron generation ability of plasmonic Pd under visible light irradiation is much lower than the electron production capability of TiO2 excited by UV light. Moreover, the surface of TiO2 provides lower active sites for CO2 reduction in comparison with that of the Pd cocatalyst. As shown in Fig. S7b,† there is a slight difference in the average production rate of CO and H2 between the three samples with the reason that the same catalytically active sites were provided by the TiO2 surface for the CO2 reduction reaction.
Photocatalytic mechanism verification with TiO2–Pd NRs samples
To further verify the edge-dependent photocatalytic performance in the CO2 reduction reaction, Pd nanorings in small size were prepared through an epitaxial growth/oxidative etching method with small Pd nanosheets as precursors, which were then loaded on the flat surface of TiO2 nanosheets with the same method of fabricating the TiO2–Pd NSs samples (Fig. S8† and 7a). The TEM images of the TiO2 nanosheet supported small Pd nanorings (namely TiO2–Pd NRs-S) in Fig. 7b and c show that hexagonal Pd nanorings with hollow interiors in the middle are well dispersed on the flat surface of TiO2 nanosheets. The edge length of the as-obtained Pd nanorings is around 9.9 nm, while the average size of the hollow interior is 3.6 nm. As revealed by the HRTEM image (Fig. 7d), the Pd nanorings are also in a monocrystal structure, whose flat surface is covered by (111) facets. Similar to TiO2–Pd NSs samples, the TiO2(001)–Pd(111) interface is also formed in the TiO2–Pd NRs-S through face-to-face contact, which can be clearly seen in the TEM image with a standing-up TiO2 nanosheet (Fig. 7e). However, the difference is the thickness of the Pd nanorings is in the range of 4 to 5 nm, much larger than that of Pd nanosheets in the TiO2–Pd NSs. The further amplified HRTEM image (Fig. 7f) of the region indicated by the red rectangle in Fig. 7e also indicates the (111) stacking faults exposed on the side surface of the Pd nanorings.

The charge kinetics of the TiO2–Pd NRs-S were studied with TiO2–Pd NSs-S and bare TiO2 nanosheets as reference samples. The loading amounts of Pd in the TiO2–Pd NRs-S and TiO2–Pd NSs-S samples were also kept the same (Table S1†). According to the UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra in Fig. S9a,† the UV light absorption ability of TiO2–Pd NRs-S is comparable to that of TiO2–Pd NSs-S. However, the photocurrent response of TiO2–Pd NRs-S is smaller than that of TiO2–Pd NSs-S, indicating the weaker electron trapping ability of Pd nanorings in comparison with that of Pd nanosheets (Fig. S9b†). This statement is also confirmed by the EIS and PL spectra (Fig. S9c and d†), in which TiO2–Pd NRs-S exhibits a larger arc radius in the EIS spectra as well as a smaller quench degree in the PL spectra as compared with TiO2–Pd NSs-S. The photocatalytic performance of the TiO2–Pd NRs-S in the CO2 reduction reaction was further investigated under UV light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8a, the TiO2–Pd NRs-S exhibits a higher average production rate of CO (15.5 vs. 12.6 μmol gcat−1 h−1) and CH4 (4.1 vs. 3.0 μmol gcat−1 h−1), but a lower H2 evolution rate (13.7 vs. 20.7 μmol gcat−1 h−1) in comparison with TiO2–Pd NSs-S. As a result, the selectivity for CO2 reduction further increases to 70.0% for TiO2–Pd NRs-S.

The contradiction between the enhanced selectivity for CO2 reduction and the decreased interfacial electron transfer ability was further analyzed through investigating the architecture of the photocatalysts. From the viewpoint of the surface and interface structure, the TiO2–Pd NRs-S and TiO2–Pd NSs-S possess the same TiO2(001)–Pd(111) interface for electron transfer as well as the same Pd(111) planes exposed for the surface reaction, which precludes the impact of the facet on the photocatalytic performance.50 However, in contrast to Pd nanosheets, the increased thickness greatly reduces the surface-to-volume ratio of Pd nanorings; thus the contact area between TiO2 and Pd is decreased for interfacial charge transfer with the same loading amount of Pd. As calculated in Table 2, the ratio of TiO2–Pd interfacial area-to-Pd volume (Sinterface/VPd) in TiO2–Pd NRs-S is 0.23 nm−1, lower than that of TiO2–Pd NSs-S (0.91 nm−1). This result gives a good explanation to the lower electron transfer ability on the TiO2–Pd interface of TiO2–Pd NRs-S. Similar to Sinterface/VPd, the exposed flat surface area-to-volume ratio of Pd nanosheets (Sflat surface/VPd) in TiO2–Pd NRs-S (0.23 nm−1) is also lower than that of TiO2–Pd NSs-S (0.91 nm−1). As a result, the reduction of reactive sites on the flat surface leads to a significant decrease in the H2 evolution rate of TiO2–Pd NRs-S. More importantly, in spite of the approximate edge length between Pd nanorings and nanosheets, the edge density of the Pd nanorings is larger than that of Pd nanosheets owing to the additional edges on the wall of the hollow interiors (Fig. 8b). The edge area-to-volume ratio (Sedge/VPd) of Pd nanorings (0.29 nm−1) is larger than that of nanosheets (0.23 nm−1) (Table 2). Accordingly, Pd nanorings offer more catalytically active sites for improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO and CH4, which further confirms the positive correlation between the edge density of Pd cocatalysts and the selectivity for CO2 reduction. Similar results were also obtained when the small Pd nanorings and nanosheets were changed into middle ones. With middle Pd nanosheets as precursors, the sample of TiO2 nanosheet supported middle Pd nanorings (TiO2–Pd NRs-M) was also synthesized (Fig. S10 and 11†), which also exhibits higher photocatalytic selectivity for CO2 reduction in comparison with that of TiO2–Pd NSs-M (Fig. S12†).

The above results highlight the importance of edge engineered cocatalysts in improving the photocatalytic activity in the CO2 reduction reaction, which was further confirmed by the superior CO and CH4 production rate of TiO2–Pd NSs-S and TiO2–Pd NRs-S as well as higher selectivity for CO2 reduction in comparison with the previously reported TiO2–Pd structures with Pd nanoparticles without edges as cocatalysts (Table 3).51–54 As another important parameter, the photocatalytic stability of the TiO2–Pd NSs and TiO2–Pd NRs was also investigated to confirm the practical application of the edge engineering in photocatalysis. As shown in Fig. S13,† there is no obvious decline in the CO and CH4 average evolution rates for both TiO2–Pd NSs-S and TiO2–Pd NRs-S samples during the photocatalytic cyclic process. As a result, in the fourth run, the photocatalytic selectivity for CO2 reduction of TiO2–Pd NSs-S and TiO2–Pd NRs-S maintains 98.0% and 95.0%, respectively. The high photocatalytic stability may be attributed to the outstanding structural stability of the designed TiO2 based samples. As shown in Fig. S14a and b,† there is no obvious change in the morphology of the TiO2–Pd NSs-S and TiO2–Pd NRs-S after the photocatalytic cyclic process.

Conclusions
In summary, edge engineering was performed on the metal cocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic performance in CO2 reduction. Pd nanosheets in different sizes were deposited onto TiO2 nanosheets to fundamentally elucidate the edge dependent photocatalytic performance in reduction of CO2 to fuels. The photocatalytic results suggest that the edges of the Pd nanosheets are highly active sites for the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules, thereby resulting in the superior photocatalytic activity of TiO2–Pd NSs-S with the highest density of edges. Additionally, the edge-sensitive photocatalytic performance has been further identified by the further improved photocatalytic activity of TiO2–Pd NRs-S over that of TiO2–Pd NSs-S, which is predominantly ascribed to the more edge sites exposed on the wall of hollow interiors in the Pd nanorings for the surface catalytic reaction. The practical application of the edge engineering was further confirmed by the high photocatalytic stability of the TiO2–Pd NSs-S and TiO2–Pd NRs-S during the cyclic process as well as their superior photocatalytic performance in comparison with those of previously reported TiO2–Pd structures with Pd nanoparticles without edges as cocatalysts. This work not only reveals the relationship between the edge density of the metal cocatalyst and the activity of the cocatalyst loaded semiconductor photocatalyst, but also supplies an edge engineering route to steer the surface reaction process on the surface of the cocatalyst for enhanced photocatalytic performance.
