Issues which require further research will also be presented.
Introduction
A dye-sensitized solar cell, DSSC, consists of a molecular dye attached to the surface of a wide bandgap semiconductor. The semiconductor is typically composed of high surface area TiO2 nanoparticles sintered together to make a transparent mesoporous film.1 The molecular dye absorbs visible light to produce an exciton, which is quickly split via charge injection into the TiO2 conduction band. A plethora of dyes have been employed which achieve good visible light absorption and efficient charge separation.2–4 This charge separated state represents a photovoltage. In order to achieve a photocurrent, however, the electron in the semiconductor needs to be collected, as does the hole which is immobilized on the oxidized dye attached to the semiconductor surface. The electron is driven towards the back collecting electrodevia diffusion. A redox shuttle in solution is employed to scavenge the hole from the oxidized dye, thereby regenerating it (see Fig. 1). Ideally, neither form of the redox shuttle would absorb visible light as that would compete with light absorption by the photocurrent generating dye molecules. Diffusion of the oxidized redox shuttle to the counter electrode completes the circuit. Since these processes push the cell away from equilibrium, recombination reactions compete to drive the cell back to equilibrium. In the case of DSSCs (assuming efficient electron injection), back-electron transfer from the TiO2 particle to the oxidized dye or the oxidized form of the redox shuttle are the only two recombination pathways. A good redox shuttle can kinetically prevent recombination to the oxidized dye by regenerating it on a faster timescale. In this case (which is a criteria of an efficient cell), only back electron transfer to the redox shuttle is relevant.

The dual kinetic constraints of fast dye regeneration and slow recombination make it very challenging to identify effective redox shuttles. This is primarily the reason virtually all research on DSSCs for the past 20 years has relied on the I3−/I−redox shuttle. Despite the ubiquitous use of I3−/I−, however, this redox shuttle has some well-established drawbacks.5,6Importantly, use of a single redox couple prevents systematic studies or the global optimization of cell efficiency.7 Thus, identifying redox shuttles to replace I3−/I− is one of the most important problems in advancing DSSCs.8

        Cobalt complex redox shuttles
Progress
The most promising alternative redox shuttles consist of substituted cobalt(III/II) polypyridyl complexes. The first report of a cobalt complex redox shuttle was in 2001 by Nusbaumer et al.9 In that work, a 2.2% power conversion efficiency was achieved under one sun illumination using the cobalt 2,6-bis(1′-butylbenzimidazol-2′-yl)pyridine, [Co(dbbip)2]3+/2+, redox couple. A very promising 5.2% efficiency was attained under one tenth of a sun illumination, however; the discrepancy was attributed to mass transport limitations. This work was followed up the next year by Sapp et al. who screened a variety of cobalt complexes which are easy to prepare. Notably, their best cells employing the cobalt tris(4,4′-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+, redox couple exhibited efficiencies 80% as high as their control I3−/I− based cells.10 These results not only further demonstrated the promise of cobalt shuttles, but the straightforward synthesis presented a library of complexes very accessible to the interested researcher. Despite these early exciting results, over the next seven years only one paper per year (on average) was published on cobalt complex redox shuttles in DSSCs; this is in contrast to over 2,700 papers from 2003–2009 that come up from a Web of Science search for the terms “dye sensitized solar cell.”
In early 2010, Feldt et al. published a paper reporting a DSSC with an efficiency of 6.7% under full sun illumination with a cobalt tris-bipyridine redox shuttle combined with an organic dye. This breakthrough report demonstrated the feasibility of using outersphere redox couples to produce high efficiency DSSCs through combined optimization of dye and redox couple. Two nearly simultaneous reports, submitted in December 2010 by Zhou et al. and Tsao et al., pushed the efficiency even higher: to 8.3% and 8.8%, respectively. In the former work a cobalt tris-phenanthroline, [Co(phen)3]3+/2+, redox shuttle was used in combination with the C218 dye, while the latter employed the cobalt tris-bipyridine shuttle, [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+, in combination with the Y123 dye. This work not only confirmed the possibility of achieving very high efficiencies, but also demonstrated the flexibility of optimizing the redox shuttle together with the sensitizer. In November 2011 a landmark paper by Aswani Yella, et al. reported a DSSC with over 12% power conversion efficiency (see Fig. 2).11 This new record efficiency that was achieved with the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+redox couple represents a paradigm shift that we expect to drive this already exciting field in new directions.

Advantages and disadvantages
Cobalt(III/II) polypyridyl complex redox shuttles have several advantages over the I3−/I−redox shuttle. First of all, there is less competitive visible light absorption with the cobalt shuttles. Fig. 4 shows absorption spectra of typical I3−/I− and cobalt(III/II) electrolytes (diluted by a factor of 1.2 × 104 to represent the absorbance of the electrolyte in a 10 micron thick electrode with 50% porosity). For the sake of comparison, an absorption spectrum of the often-used N3 dye is also included. Clearly the I3−/I− electrolyte has more absorbance in the 350–450 nm region; all else being equal this would result in somewhat higher photocurrent densities by DSSCs employing cobalt(III/II) redox shuttles.

Another attractive feature of cobalt(III/II) redox shuttles is the tunability of their redox potential. Ideally, the potential of the redox shuttle would be matched to the dye ground state potential in order to regenerate the dye with a minimal overpotential loss, thus maximizing the photovoltage.7Fig. 3 shows the structures of representative [Co(dbbip)2]3+/2+, [Co(R2-bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(X-phen)3]3+/2+ complexes. Through variation of the ligands, and the introduction of electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents on the ligands, the formal potential can be tuned by over 400 mV. Table 1 lists the potentials of these complexes with various substituents. We note that additional variations of this theme have been examined, such as bis-terpyridine complexes, however the list was limited to the most significant variations for conciseness.

Dye
          regeneration by cobalt polypyridyl complexes can be efficient for certain dyes compared to I3−/I−. For example, when [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]2+ was employed as a dye, both [Co(Me2bpy)3]3+/2+ and [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ produced higher quantum yields than I3−/I− based cells, which was attributed to better dye regeneration.20 In addition to [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]2+, cobalt complex shuttles were found to regenerate several other dyes efficiently, which can be inferred by the high IPCEs.13,20–24 Recent work by Feldt et al. determined the regeneration yield of D35-Sensitized DSSCs using a series of cobalt bipyridine and phenanthroline complexes.13 Transient absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine regeneration rate constants of the D35 dye. Fig. 5 shows transient absorption kinetics of D35 TiO2 electrodes sensitized with the D35 dye in the presence of cobalt bipyridine redox shuttles. The fast decay of the signal indicates rapid dye regeneration. Essentially quantitative regeneration was realized when the driving force was over 0.5 eV for the reaction.13 While this is an improvement over I3−/I−,5 it is still not optimal.2

An important feature of these complexes is that the spin change from cobalt(III) (low spin) to cobalt(II) (high spin) produces a large inner-sphere reorganization energy of approximately 1 eV.25–27 This barrier results in very slow electron self-exchange kinetics. In addition to the slow self-exchange kinetics, the large reorganization energy results in slow recombination kinetics at TiO2 electrodes.28,29 Indeed, it is the exceptionally slow recombination reaction that makes the cobalt complexes stand out as a viable alternative to replace I3−/I−. Unlike I3−/I−, however, the rate of recombination is not quite low enough to allow for quantitative charge collection.30 In order to bridge this gap, the strategy of physically blocking the redox couple from the electrode surface has been employed in order to reduce the electronic coupling. In an initial proof-of-concept, we showed that an ultra thin alumina layer consisting of a single atomic layer deposition cycle could retard recombination sufficiently to produce quantitative charge collection.18,20 The drawback of this method is that charge injection also proceeds across this barrier layer which is not ideal. The early promising results with [Co(t-Bu2bpy)3]3+/2+ can also partially be attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky tert-butyl groups.10,18 An elegant approach of building a blocking layer into the dye structure was also employed since injection is uninhibited, but recombination is minimized.21–24,31 The most promising results presented above have utilized this strategy with a variety of dyes. For example, Fig. 6 shows the electron lifetimes, which is a measure of recombination,29 as a function of extracted charge for TiO2 electrodes sensitized with the D35 dye.22 The blocking effect of this dye slows recombination of the three cobalt bipyridine redox shuttles to comparable rates as I3−/I−, which allows for good charge collection. Recently, a combination of sterically hindered dyes and redox couples was reported as an extension of this approach.32 Finally, it has been demonstrated in several cases that recombination can be described using Marcus formalism, where the rate of recombination increases with increasing driving force.13,19,29 Thus, use of more positive shuttles with electron withdrawing groups may yield diminishing returns in terms of voltage. If some form of a blocking layer strategy is improved, however, use of very positive shuttles may lead to even higher photovoltages and efficiencies.
One significant drawback of the relatively bulky cobalt complexes (compared to I3−/I−) is the slow mass transport through the mesoporous electrode.7,16,33,34 The diffusion of the oxidized form of the redox couple to the counter electrode completes the circuit and this mass transport flux is in series with other charge transport processes. Fig. 7 shows current transients of DSSCs containing cobalt bipyridine redox shuttles, where the decay at early times is attributed to diffusion limited photocurrent densities.20,33 The diffusion limiting current density is proportional to the film porosity, εP, the diffusion coefficient, Do, the concentration of the oxidized form of the redox shuttle, [Co3+], and inversely proportional to the electrolyte diffusion distance, l.35 The relatively low solubility of [Co3+] has been problematic,9,10,15 but this was improved through optimization of the electrolyte and judicious choice of the counter ion.21,36 In addition, the bulky cobalt complex redox shuttles have low Do values, which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than I3−/I− in mesoporous TiO2 films.33,34 Use of high molar absorptivity sensitizers alleviates the mass transport demands since a thinner electrode (smaller l) is required to achieve good light absorption. In addition, thin electrodes reduce the distance electrons must diffuse to be collected which helps overcome the limitations of short diffusion length systems.7 Another recent development to overcome mass transport limitations was the introduction of more porous TiO2 nanoparticle films.21 An alternative approach to increase εP, (although not yet demonstrated with cobalt complex redox shuttles) is to coat ultra-porous aerogel films with TiO2viaALD (see Fig. 8).37 Thus, through optimization of the electrode porosity, dye absorptivity and redox shuttle solubility should allow overcoming the mass transport constraints of the low Do cobalt polypyridine redox shuttles.

Conclusions
The recent advancement of cobalt complex redox shuttles over the past two years has produced some very exciting results, which culminated in a new record efficiency of over 12% for a DSSC. Compared to more conventional DSSCs, which have been thoroughly optimized over the past twenty years, the relatively new paradigm of high efficiency DSSCs with cobalt complex redox shuttles still has ample room for improvement. The electrolyte diffusion limitations have partially been overcome, and further improvements should lead directly to over 13% efficient cells under 1 sun illumination. In addition, the overpotential for dye regeneration has been reduced, but further improvements can lead to increased photocurrent densities and/or photovoltages. We thus believe efficiencies exceeding 14% are probable in the near future. One issue which needs to be addressed, however, is the stability of these redox shuttles. For example, a 10–15% decrease in the efficiency was reported following 220 h of exposure to full sunlight at 30 °C.21 While this decay was attributed to loss of the volatile acetonitrile solvent, the stability of the cobalt complex electrolyte was not established. To the best of our knowledge, no long term stability studies have been carried out, which will certainly be necessary if these redox shuttles are to serve as real replacements for I3−/I−.
