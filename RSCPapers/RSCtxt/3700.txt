    , Accepted 22nd June 2017First published on 23rd June 2017AbstractIn the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene over BiVO4/TiO2, some deactivation was observed at 30 °C, while stable activity was maintained at higher temperatures. To further take advantage of the heating effect during photocatalysis, Pt was loaded onto the BiVO4/TiO2 sample, owing to its excellent performance in thermocatalysis. The results show that the Pt/BiVO4/TiO2 sample with a Pt loading amount of 1.0 wt% has the best activity in the oxidation of benzene, compared with others containing loading amounts of 0.2, 0.5 and 2.0 wt%. Benzene can be totally oxidized at 80 °C with an obvious photothermocatalytic synergetic effect, whose mechanism is discussed and summarized as three main paths. In this case, the heating effect of infrared light from a light source can be helpful in photocatalysis, which is an inspiration for increasing the availability of solar energy.
1. Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are not only hazardous air pollutants because of their toxic, malodorous, mutagenic and carcinogenic characteristics, but they are also precursors of ozone and smog.1–3 Among the VOCs, benzene, as an important solvent and raw material, is widely used in industry for producing different kinds of chemical products.4,5 However, the recalcitrant properties of benzene, which can raise the risk of leukemia, decrease blood cell counts and harm the hematopoietic and nervous systems, make it significantly hazardous. People have had a long history of resisting benzene by using adsorption, plasma decomposition and catalytic combustion techniques.6–10 Among these, adsorption methods are limited by a low treatment efficiency, while plasma decomposition and catalytic combustion suffer from great energy consumption and possible secondary pollution. Thus, an increasing number of studies have been focused on photocatalysis (PC) degradation, which possesses the advantages of mild operation conditions and environmental friendliness.
Many kinds of photocatalysts for oxidizing benzene have been studied.11,12 However, most of them respond to UV light and a small part of the visible spectrum. Therefore, the conversion and mineralization of benzene are not as high as when thermocatalysis (TC) oxidation is used, which can completely eliminate benzene at a certain temperature. Efforts have been made to improve the PC performance by modifying TiO2 or making heterostructures with other photocatalysts.13,14 Our group reported several effective visible light-responsive photocatalysts, such as BiVO4/TiO2 (BVT), LaVO4/TiO2 and Ag3VO4/TiO2,15–17 which exhibit excellent activity even under visible light. However, these photocatalysts cannot maintain a high level of activity at increasing space velocity.
It appears to be difficult to eliminate benzene by modifying the photocatalyst itself. In this case, studies involving PC coupled with external fields, such as microwaves,18,19 electric fields20,21 and thermal fields, have been investigated. Compared with other fields that have limitations due to facilities, thermal field coupling has been more widely researched. Falconer et al.22 studied the photothermocatalysis (PTC) degradation of acetaldehyde under UV light and heating to 200 °C using an additional heat source. Li et al.23–25 reported the PTC detoxification of benzene on TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 under a UV lamp, with the temperature automatically increasing to 240 °C. After that, they also reported the use of MnOx/TiO2 and TiO2/CeO2 in a similar reaction. Wang et al.26–29 reported Co3O4 and Ce-based catalysts modified with Bi and Mn for the PTC degradation of formaldehyde, propylene and propane. These studies offer guidelines for PTC, but they also have some limitations, such as the utilization of only UV light and the need for high temperatures. Furthermore, PTC studies related to benzene mostly demand high temperatures and specific facilities, which might overshadow the advantages of PC and limit its application to the elimination of VOCs.
To develop a PTC material that combines both benefits of PC and TC, we combined a photocatalyst that can utilize the UV-vis part the solar spectrum for PC, with a thermocatalyst that can use the IR part for low-temperature TC, without the need for extra heating. Herein, we observed that BVT is deactivated when the space velocity increases from 1000 h−1 to 6000 h−1. To improve the activity of BVT, we found that the increase in temperature is helpful for stabilizing the degradation of benzene at a high space velocity. In order to further exploit the advantage of temperature, Pt was loaded onto BVT because of its outstanding TC activity, even at low temperature. In this case, the heating effect of the IR part could provide the required temperature for the experiment without the need for another heating facility. This work has provided new insights towards the better utilization of solar energy for the elimination of benzene and other VOCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of catalysts
BVT was prepared by following our previous reported procedures.15 The preparation of Pt/BiVO4/TiO2 (PBVT) was accomplished using an impregnation method. The obtained BVT was impregnated into different volumes of an aqueous solution of chlorine platinum acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O, 2.57 × 10−2 mol L−1). After impregnation, the samples were dried at 80 °C and then reduced using an excess solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 0.1 mol L−1) in sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 0.1 mol L−1), followed by calcination at 400 °C. BVT loaded with 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt% of Pt were prepared, and were labeled as 0.2PBVT, 0.5PBVT, 1PBVT and 2PBVT, respectively.
The control sample, Pt-BVT, was synthesized by mixing BVT with a solvent containing Pt nanoparticles stabilized by PVP.30 The amount of Pt was fixed at 1.0 wt%.
2.2 Characterization of catalysts
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), to identify the phase compositions in the samples. The morphology and microstructure of the composites were further investigated using TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) using a JEOL JEM 2010F microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The measurements of specific surface area were performed on a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer with a Coulter Ominisor 100 CX automatic physisorption analyzer using isotherms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on a ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectroscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 3.0 × 10−10 mbar with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (E = 1486.2 eV). Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained using a Varian Cary 500 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetry (TG) analysis was carried out on a NETZSCH STA449C thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.3 Measurement of catalytic activity
The PC and PTC activities were measured in a 20 × 15 × 1.0 mm3 rectangle fixed-bed quartz reactor, by feeding a cylinder of benzene gas (DL Gas, China), which contained 281 ppm benzene with zero air (80% N2:20% O2), at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 over 0.27 g of catalyst (50–70 mesh). A thermocouple was inserted to make contact with the catalyst to monitor the temperature. Simulated solar light from a 500 W Xe-arc lamp (Beijing Changtuo Co., China) was used, without any cut-off filter. The irradiation spectra of the light source are shown in Fig. S1.† Different temperatures were obtained under the irradiation of the Xe-arc lamp using a cooling facility. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 6000 h−1. The concentrations of benzene and carbon dioxide were determined online on an Agilent 7890 GC, by using a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), respectively. TC activity was measured under the same conditions, except that no illumination was used, while the heating plate was applied to maintain different temperatures.
In the gas-phase degradation experiment, the conversion of benzene was defined as (C0 − C)/C0 (eqn (1)). C is the concentration of pollutant at each irradiation time interval detected on the gas chromatograph. C0 is the initial concentration of pollutant when adsorption–desorption equilibrium is achieved in the degradation system. The ratio of the amount of CO2 actually produced and the amount theoretically produced when benzene is converted into CO2 completely was defined as the mineralization ratio (eqn (2)). Every conversion of benzene for each temperature was the average value taken from 24 measurements obtained within 12 h when the target temperature was stable. Conversion of benzene = [(C0 − C)/C0] × 100%(1) Mineralization = [CO2produced/6(C0 − C)] × 100%(2)
Electron spin resonance (ESR) tests for the regeneration of the samples were performed on a Bruker model A300 spectrometer (Bruker Instruments, Inc.) at room temperature. A microwave frequency of 9.813 GHz and a power of 30 mW were used. A 10 mg portion of each sample was put into quartz tubes for tests.
The ESR tests for ˙OH and O2˙− radicals and the TPD tests were performed according to the conditions of our former work.31 The different irradiation conditions are shown in Fig. S2–S4.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The influence of temperature on the decomposition of benzene
Generally, the effect of temperature is excluded in PC. However, if it is a beneficial factor for the decomposition of benzene, the heating effect from the IR part of the light source should be used in a PC reaction. To study its influence, the PC activity of BVT, TiO2 and P25 at different temperatures was researched. The results show that at normal temperature (30 °C), all of these three samples show obvious deactivation (Fig. 1). As for P25, the increase in temperature barely raised the activity, and the conversion of benzene was maintained at ca. 7% from 30 °C to 100 °C. For TiO2, the conversion under the conditions of 60 °C and 80 °C remained stable at 18% and then the conversion increased to 22% at 100 °C. With regard to BVT, a stable conversion of 38% could be obtained at 60 °C, and the conversion subsequently increased to 50% at 80 °C or 100 °C. From the comparison of different samples under different temperature conditions, it can be concluded that the rise in temperature is helpful for stabilizing the catalytic activity and obviously increasing the activity of BVT.

The mineralization versus time over BVT at 30 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C is shown in Fig. 1d. At 30 °C, the mineralization increased versus reaction time, while the conversion decreased. This might be because the intermediates of incomplete oxidation cover the surface of the catalyst. As a result, these intermediates would be preferentially mineralized to CO2 instead of benzene, causing an increase in mineralization. With the temperature increasing, the extent of mineralization at 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C was almost ca. 70–80%. It can be inferred that the increase in temperature can improve the conversion of benzene, which means that fewer intermediates are produced so that higher levels of mineralization and stable activity can be maintained at higher temperature.
3.2 The enlightenment on the regeneration of deactivated samples
In this case, which factor influences the PC activity at higher temperature, the TC effect or the combined effect of PC and TC? In order to figure out this problem, deactivated BVT and TiO2 samples (abbreviated as de-BVT and de-TiO2) were regenerated under PC conditions of PC at 30 °C, TC at 80 °C and PTC at 80 °C for 5 h (abbreviated as PCR, TCR and PTCR, respectively). After regeneration, none of these samples showed changes in their crystal phases as shown in the XRD patterns in Fig. 2a. In the Raman spectra in Fig. S5,† the peaks at 638 cm−1, 517 cm−1, 396 cm−1, 325 cm−1, 198 cm−1 and 143 cm−1 can be attributed to anatase TiO2. The peaks at 610 cm−1, 451 cm−1 and 247 cm−1 can be attributed to rutile TiO2. The weak peak at 830 cm−1 refers to tetrahedral VO4 of BiVO4. No differences were found in the Raman spectra, which means that no changes in structure occurred after regeneration. Subsequently, these samples were tested again in the PC oxidation reaction at normal temperature (30 °C). As shown in Fig. 2b, the PC activity of the BVT-PTCR sample was recovered to its original value, while the activities of the BVT-PCR and BVT-TCR samples were not, and the colors of samples are shown in the inserted photos. However, for TiO2, the regeneration procedure did not help in recovering the activity (Fig. S6†).

(b) The PC conversion of benzene versus time over the BVT-origin, de-BVT, BVT-PCR, BVT-PTCR and BVT-TCR samples at 30 °C, showing their colors after the reaction (inset). (c) TG curves of the BVT-origin, de-BVT, BVT-PCR, BVT-TCR and BVT-PTCR samples. (d) ESR spectra of the BVT-origin, de-BVT, BVT-PCR, BVT-TCR and BVT-PTCR samples. 
To further study the regeneration, TG was used to determine the weight loss under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 2c, for the de-BVT sample, the large slope part corresponds to the weight loss of carbonaceous intermediates, which were completely dealt with at almost 400 °C. For the BVT-PCR sample, the weight loss was decreased compared with the de-BVT sample. It can be deduced that the intermediates were partly oxidized after PC regeneration. For the BVT-TCR sample, the weight loss was increased compared with de-BVT, which means that the amount of carbon deposits increased after TC regeneration. However, the PTCR sample shows a similar trend to that of the original BVT (BVT-origin), in which the weight loss is probably ascribed to water. As a result, the carbon intermediates could be basically removed after PTC regeneration, but not after the PC or TC regeneration.
ESR tests were also used to confirm the existence of intermediates, as shown in Fig. 2d. For the BVT-origin sample, no signal can be observed, while a sharp signal at 3510 Gauss (abbreviated as G) corresponding to carbon species32 appears in the curve of the de-BVT sample. After PC and TC regeneration, the signal of the carbon species at 3510 G still exists, along with some other signals related to different carbon species produced under these two regeneration conditions. But for the BVT-PTCR sample, no obvious signal is detected, which is similar to the situation of the BVT-origin sample. This result is in accordance with the TG results discussed above.
The above discussion reveals that under PTC conditions, the intermediates that hinder the activity of the catalyst can be eliminated. To evaluate the influence of temperature in PC, the Arrhenius equation was considered.26,27 According to the Arrhenius equation, since Ea can be treated as a constant in a moderate temperature range, the reaction rate constant (k) will increase exponentially with increasing temperature, which presents as an increase in activity. As confirmed in the ESI,† for BVT, the lnkappversus 1000 T−1 plot can be fitted linearly as shown in Fig. S7.† Moreover, TiO2 and P25 show no obvious enhancement in their conversion with increasing temperature, and an unapparent linearity is obtained, as shown in Fig. S8 and S9.† Thus, it can be inferred that BVT has the advantage of using the heating effect from the light source.
3.3 The decomposition of benzene using PTC material PBVT
In the previous discussion, for BVT, the rise in temperature in the PC reaction can cause an increase in the reaction rate. In order to make greater use of the temperature effect, the traditional thermocatalyst Pt was introduced into BVT. What role would Pt play in this system? Would it further raise the reaction rate with increasing temperature? As a thermocatalyst, would it have any other effect on the catalytic activity? To answer these questions, PBVT samples with different amounts of Pt loading (0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 wt%, denoted as 0.2PBVT, 0.5PVT, 1PBVT and 2PBVT, respectively) were prepared for the measurement of PTC activity.
From the XRD patterns in Fig. 3, the different loading amounts of Pt had little influence on the crystal phases of the PBVT samples, which mainly consist of anatase and rutile TiO2. The morphology of 1PBVT was further observed using TEM and HRTEM. The dark spots circled in Fig. 4a denote Pt nanoparticles, owing to their higher electron density. The Pt nanoparticles are ca. 5–7 nm in size and dispersed well on the surface of BVT. Several different lattice fringes can be observed from the HRTEM image of 1PBVT in Fig. 4b. The lattice fringes of the dark dot in Fig. 4b match the (111) crystallographic plane of Pt, which can be also identified by its characteristic diffraction spots in Fig. 4c. The lattice fringes of d = 0.352 nm match the (101) crystallographic plane of anatase TiO2 and the lattice fringes of d = 0.309 nm match the (−121) crystallographic plane of the BiVO4 nanoparticles, and the corresponding diffraction spots are shown in the fast-Fourier transform (FFT) patterns in Fig. 4d and e.

 Fig. 4  TEM (a) and HRTEM (b) images of 1PBVT; FFT patterns of Pt (c), BiVO4 (d) and TiO2 (e). 
The BET surface areas of 0.2PBVT, 0.5PBVT, 1PBVT and 2PBVT are 53, 50, 49 and 52 cm2 g−1. XPS analysis, shown in Fig. S10,† was used to analyze the valent states of the samples. Typically, the doublet located at 70.3 and 73.6 eV corresponds to metallic Pt and the intensity of the peaks is enhanced with the increase of the Pt loading amount. Furthermore, the XPS spectra of Bi, V, Ti and O for 1PBVT are in agreement with their corresponding valent states. The optical properties of the PBVT samples are shown in Fig. 5. The optical absorption edges of the PBVT samples with different Pt loading amounts show little difference to those of BVT. However, with an increase in the Pt amount, the optical absorption of the PBVT samples in the visible region is enhanced.

The PTC and TC activities of the PBVT samples at different temperatures were studied. As shown in Fig. 6, taking the PC and TC activity into account separately, the PC activity (referring to PTC conversion at 30 °C) decreases with increasing Pt loading amount, whereas the TC activity increases. The decrease in the PC activity of the Pt-loaded samples compared with BVT might be caused by the coverage of Pt on the PC active sites of BVT and the light-shielding effect of Pt.33–37 As for the PTC activity of each sample, the sum of the PC and TC activities was obtained for comparison. For the 0.2PBVT sample, the curve of the PTC activity almost coincides with the curve of sum-0.2PBVT, meaning that the PTC activity here is just the sum of the PC and TC activities. Meanwhile, for the 0.5PBVT sample, the curve of the PTC activity shows the same trend as the curve of sum-0.5PBVT before 80 °C. When the temperature continues to rise, the PTC activity is higher than the sum, suggesting that a synergetic effect appears. Particularly, the 1PBVT sample shows extraordinary PTC activity, which is dramatically higher than the sum of the PC and TC activities. At 80 °C under PTC conditions, benzene can be totally eliminated. However, when the loading amount of Pt increases to 2.0 wt%, the curve of the PTC activity almost coincides with the curve of the sum, meaning that no synergetic effect appears. Furthermore, the amount of CO2 produced on these samples has a similar trend as the conversion (Fig. S11†).

From this result, it can be concluded that the extent of the PTC synergetic effect depends on the amount of Pt loading. The optimum loading amount of Pt is 1.0 wt% and the 1PBVT sample shows a notable PTC synergetic effect as benzene can be completely degraded under PTC conditions at 80 °C.
In order to verify whether the PTC synergetic effect comes from the increase in reaction rate due to the increase in temperature, the Arrhenius equation was fitted for 1PBVT. As shown in Fig. S12,† unlike the situation for the BVT sample, there is no significant linear relationship of the Arrhenius plot for the 1PBVT sample. In other words, the PTC synergetic effect of 1PBVT is not just because of the increase in reaction rate caused by temperature. There must be some other reason causing this obvious synergetic effect.
3.4 Discussion of the PTC synergetic effect
In order to figure out how the PTC synergetic effect appears, three possible paths have been put forward and are discussed as follows (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Three possible paths causing the PTC synergetic effect. 

3.4.1 Influence of the PC process on the PTC synergetic effect. 
The PC process could influence the desorption of benzene on Pt. On the Pt (111) surface (as shown in Scheme 1, 1st path), benzene chemisorbs preferentially in the bridge sites and then in the threefold hollow sites.38,39 The process of benzene oxidation then occurs between the benzene chemisorbing in the bridge sites and the atomic oxygen chemisorbing in the adjacent threefold hollow site. However, due to the competition between adsorption and desorption, these threefold hollow sites are occupied by benzene instead of oxygen, and this oxidation process only starts when it reaches a certain temperature, T0, at which enough energy can be provided for benzene to desorb from the threefold hollow sites so that atomic oxygen can adsorb. In other words, the TC oxidation of benzene starts to happen at T0. In this circumstance, how would PC influence the TC process? As we know, electrons (e−) can transmit from photo-induced BVT to the surface of Pt. e− on Pt would influence the adsorption of benzene due to its π-electrons.40 As the desorption activation energy for bridge sites (110 kJ mol−1) is higher than that of threefold hollow sites (80 kJ mol−1),41 we deduce that the e− on Pt would help the desorption of benzene from the threefold hollow sites. In this case, under PTC conditions, it might be possible for the temperature of T0 to become lowered compared with that under TC conditions, which turns out to be the 1st path of the PTC synergetic effect.
By connecting this path with the catalytic performance, the change of T0 in PTC and TC was focused on. As shown in Fig. 6, T0 during the TC of 1PBVT is 60 °C. However, the PTC conversion at 60 °C is higher than the sum of PC and TC conversion, which means that T0 in PTC is lowered below 60 °C. The situation is similar for 2PBVT, whereas for 0.2PBVT and 0.5PBVT, the PTC conversion shows no change compared with the PC conversion in the range of temperatures lower than T0 in TC. In other words, for 0.2PBVT and 0.5PBVT, T0 in PTC is not lowered compared with T0 in TC. This indicates that the 1st path, which is closely connected with TC, is related to the loading amount of Pt.


3.4.2 Influence of the TC process on the PTC synergetic effect. 
In a single TC process, O2 adsorbed on Pt will associate with oxygen atoms and then react with benzene. Meanwhile, in the PC process, oxygen on both Pt and BVT will capture e− from BVT and produce O2˙−. In the PTC process, these O2˙− radicals on Pt have a lower bond energy (94.5 kcal mol−1) than O2 (118 kcal mol−1)42 and can dissociate into oxygen atoms and O− with the help of the TC process on Pt as shown in eqn (3). Subsequently, these O− may produce ˙OH according to eqn (4), and ˙OH is known to be a robust reactive species for benzene oxidation. Meanwhile, all the generated reactive species would oxidize benzene as shown in eqn (5). With the help of the TC process, more reactive oxidation species can be produced than in a single PC process, which makes a contribution to the PTC synergetic effect. (3) O− + H2O → ˙OH + OH−(4) [O]ad,O2˙−,˙OH,h+ + benzene → ⋯ → CO2 + H2O(5)
Herein, ESR was employed to test for ˙OH and O2˙− and to verify these processes. From the results shown in Fig. 7, samples with different Pt loading amounts have almost the same ˙OH and O2˙− signal intensities, which means that the loading amount of Pt has little impact on the amount of ˙OH and O2˙− produced under PC conditions. Furthermore, BVT, 0.2PBVT, 0.5PBVT and 2PBVT have the same ˙OH and O2˙− signal intensities, under both PC and PTC conditions (Fig. S13†). However, 1PBVT has a stronger O2˙− signal intensity under PTC conditions, as shown in Fig. 7d. This result confirms the PTC process in eqn (3).

ESR signals of (c) DMPO–˙OH adduct and (d) DMPO–O2˙− of 1PBVT under PC (see the irradiation graph in Fig. S2†) and PTC (see the irradiation graph in Fig. S3†). 
Meanwhile, for the tests of O2-TPD for 1PBVT as shown in Fig. 8, similar to our former study,31 the peak at 200 °C corresponding to O2˙− decreases a little while the peak at 325 °C corresponding to O− increases under the PTC conditions. However, no difference is observed for BVT, as shown in Fig. S14.† In this case, the results of the O2-TPD tests are in accord with those of the ESR tests, further verifying the PTC process of eqn (3). Consequently, this might be another path for the PTC synergetic effect, as seen in the 2nd path of Scheme 1.

3.4.3 Influence of the interaction between the PC and TC processes on the PTC synergetic effect. 
The PC and TC processes might interact with each other. The intermediates in the PC process could transfer to the surface of Pt. These intermediates of the PC process might be oxidized more easily by the TC process, finally leading to the PTC synergetic effect, as seen in the 3rd path of Scheme 1.
As a consequence, the Pt loading amount has an impact on the balance of PC and TC, and further influences the performance of the above three paths, which determine the generation of the PTC synergetic effect. Furthermore, since the contact between Pt and BVT is closely connected to electron transfer and also to these paths, a control sample Pt-BVT, prepared by mechanically mixing BVT with Pt nanoparticles covered with PVP, was studied. From Fig. 9a, it can be seen that the valent state of Pt in both 1PBVT and Pt-BVT is nearly the same. To evaluate the interface contact, the photocurrent was used as indirect evidence. As shown in Fig. 9b, compared with BVT, 1PBVT exhibited a great increase in photocurrent, while Pt-BVT showed little increase, suggesting that 1PBVT has a higher separation efficiency of photoinduced pairs of electrons and holes, owing to better interface contact. In this case, the contact between Pt and BVT is weakened in Pt-BVT. In the activity tests, the TC activity of Pt-BVT shown in Fig. 9c basically maintained the same value as that of 1PBVT. However, the conversion of benzene shown in Fig. 9d was almost the same for Pt-BVT at both 30 and 80 °C. This result indicates that when the contact of Pt and BVT is cut off, no PTC synergetic effect appears.

Conclusions
In summary, in the PC oxidation of benzene, raising the temperature to some extent is beneficial for the stability and reactivity of BVT. In order to exploit the effect of temperature to the utmost, Pt nanoparticles were loaded onto BVT due to its excellent TC activity even at low temperature. As a result, BVT with different amounts of Pt loading showed different PTC activities. Particularly, BVT with a Pt loading amount of 1.0 wt% exhibited an obvious PTC synergetic effect and could completely oxidize benzene at 80 °C. In this work, the mechanism of the PTC synergetic effect is discussed, and three factors are put forward to explain the origin of the synergetic effect. Our work presents a promising new way for using solar energy directly to eliminate benzene.
