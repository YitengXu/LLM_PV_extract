    , Accepted 19th December 2018First published on 19th December 2018AbstractOrganic thermoelectric (TE) materials provide a brand new perspective to search for high-efficiency TE materials, due to their low thermal conductivity. The overlap of pz orbitals, commonly existing in organic π-stacking semiconductors, can potentially result in high electron mobility comparable to that of inorganic materials. Here we propose a strategy to utilize the overlap of pz orbitals to increase the TE efficiency of a layered polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). Through first-principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations, we find that an A–A stacked PCN has unexpectedly high cross-plane ZT up to 0.52 at 300 K, and can contribute to n-type TE groups. The high ZT originates from its one-dimensional charge transport and low thermal conductivity. The thermal contribution of the overlap of pz orbitals is investigated, which slightly enhances the thermal transport when compared with that without considering the overlap effect. That is, there is a limited influence of orbital overlap to thermal conductivity. To explore the physical insight behind its TE advantages, we find that the low-dimensional charge transport results from strong pz-overlap interactions and the in-plane electron confinement, by comparing π-stacking carbon nitride derivatives and graphite. This study can provide guidance to search for layered materials with high cross-plane TE performance.
Introduction
The thermoelectric (TE) technology can directly convert heat into electricity and it is also used in solid-state cooling. Thermoelectric devices are considered for a variety of applications,1–5 for example, distributed power generation, waste heat recovery from vehicles, and power supply to electronic devices. The efficiency of TE conversion can be measured by a dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, which is defined as ZT = σS2T/(κe + κph). σ is the electrical conductivity; S is the Seebeck coefficient; T is the absolute temperature; κe is the electronic thermal conductivity; and κph is the lattice thermal conductivity. Reducing κph while maintaining the power factor (PF = σS2) is a general strategy to increase ZT. Such methods have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing κph, for example, reducing dimensions to bring in size effects on phonon scattering,6–9 creating nanostructures to intensify boundary scatterings,10–12 and changing the morphology on a micron scale.13–16 These strategies aim at designing electron-crystal-phonon-glass structures. In addition, lower-dimensional band structures can augment PF to further boost ZT.17,18
Organic TE materials provide an alternative blueprint for TE application due to their low κph. Compared with inorganic TE materials, organic TE materials have many advantages, for example, light weight, high flexibility, and low cost. Due to the complex morphology of the polymer chain, amorphous bulk polymers have low thermal conductivity, on the order of 0.1–1.0 W m−1 K−1,19,20 as well as low carrier mobility. Ordered crystalline polymers are desirable due to their high carrier mobility and Seebeck coefficients.21,22 However, ordered polymers, such as high-quality ultra-drawn polyethylene (PE) single crystalline nanofibers23 and chain-oriented polymeric fibers, can possibly possess high chain-oriented thermal conductivity.24–26 The large anisotropy in thermal transport properties can be utilized to take advantage of good electron transport properties of conducting polymers and to avoid high chain-oriented thermal conductivity. Conducting polymers, for example, PEDOT and P3HT, are considered as materials with high TE potential.27,28 Their TE performance can be improved through doping or optimizing molecular morphology.29,30 The ZT of PEDOT:PSS is up to 0.42 at 300 K from experiments.31 Another type of promising TE candidates is small-molecular semiconductors that are easier to purify and crystallize than polymers. In small-molecular semiconductors, strong intermolecular electronic couplings provide main paths for their salient charge transport.29 The charge mobility of single-crystal rubrene32 can be up to 43 cm2 V−1 s−1. Pentacene thin films doped with iodine33 have a σ of 110 S cm−1. This excellent electron transport and poor thermal transport make small-molecular semiconductors competitive in TE applications. More interestingly, the charge transport in three-dimensional (3D) structures of small-molecular semiconductors is strongly anisotropic, where inter-planar charge transport dominates. Thus their TE performance along a non-bond direction is worthy of exploration. Recent investigations have shown that Cn-BTBTs and bis(dithienothiophene) (BDT) have high ZT along the inter-planar direction due to their low-dimensional charge transport.34,35 Overall, low κph and the special electronic properties make stacking organic semiconductors promising candidates for TE applications.
Polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs) have recently attracted considerable interest as crystalline all-organic wide-bandgap semiconductors in solar water-splitting36 and photovoltaics.37 Tyborski et al. experimentally found that their samples of PCN mainly consist of flat and buckled A–A-stacked structures with a stacking distance of 3.28 Å.38 The flat structures are shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Merschjann et al. demonstrated that PCNs exhibit one-dimensional (1D) inter-planar charge transport, which means that the charge transport in PCNs is essentially confined to one dimension, the c direction of the crystal structure.39 This low-dimensional charge transport property is similar to that of BDT, where the 1D band structure of BDT results from a pz-orbital overlap and is considered to be responsible for its high ZT.35 Similarly, a previous model of π-stacking molecular junctions has been reported to possess high TE coefficients.40,41 For this reason, we plan to investigate the cross-plane TE performance of a PCN under the influence of the pz-orbital overlap. Another reason is the low-dimensional advantage of their charge transport. Common small-molecular semiconductors possess herringbone structures that result in two-dimensional (2D) charge transport.42 An A–A stacked PCN exhibits 1D charge transport which is preferable for TE applications.43

In this work, we calculate the TE coefficients of an A–A stacked PCN along the c direction using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Its lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. To accurately predict the lattice thermal conductivity of the A–A stacked PCN along the c direction, we consider van der Waals (vdW) interactions and electrostatic forces to describe the overlap of pz orbitals.
Methods
The lattice and electronic structures of the PCN are calculated using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).44,45 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) version of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is used for the exchange–correlation functional.46 The DFT-D2 method of Grimme is used to take into account the van der Waals (vdW) interactions among different layers.47 The cutoff energy of the plane wave expansion is set to 600 eV. The reciprocal space is sampled using a 9 × 9 × 15 Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh. A finer mesh of 11 × 11 × 31 is used for density of states (DOS) calculation. Other computational details are provided in the ESI.†
The electron transport coefficients are calculated with BoltzTraP48 which is based on the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Different from an assumption of constant relaxation time, we calculate electronic relaxation time via a deformation potential approximation (DPA) that is proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.27,34,49–51 The longitudinal acoustic phonon mode is considered in electron–phonon (e–ph) coupling along the direction of electron flow. As PCNs have 1D electron transport properties, we use a 1D formula for relaxation time which is expressed as follows.  
In this formula, kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature; E is the deformation potential constant; ℏ is the reduced Planck constant; C is the elastic constant along the c direction; and vk is the group velocity. Details of formula derivations and transport coefficient calculations are provided in the ESI.†
The thermal conductivity of the PCN is calculated from equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) using the Green–Kubo formula,  where κ, V, and T are the thermal conductivity, the volume of the simulation cell, and temperature, respectively. (τ)·(0) is the heat current autocorrelation function (HCACF). The angular bracket denotes ensemble average. In this study, all the MD simulations are performed using LAMMPS packages.52 For such a layered structured PCN, the overlap of pz orbitals introduces a new electron transport channel. For thermal transport, the AMBER force field53 is used because it has been shown to successfully reproduce the thermal transport of layered structures. Previous investigations demonstrated that the geometry of the overlap of pz orbitals is controlled by electrostatic forces and vdW interactions.54,55 To accurately predict the lattice thermal conductivity between interlayers, both are considered. The charge distribution of the PCN is computed using an atomic charge calculator, which is based on the Electronegativity Equalization Method (EEM).56–60 The periodic boundary conditions are used in three directions to simulate the infinite system. However, the calculated thermal conductivity still exhibits the finite size effects related to the variation in the longest phonon wavelength that the system can reproduce. In our simulations, 6 × 6 × 10 unit cells (100.35 × 76.11 × 7.28 nm3) are used, where the calculated thermal conductivity saturates to a constant. More details about the EMD simulations can be found in the ESI.† All the results reported in our studies are ensemble averaged over 12 independent runs with different initial conditions.
Results and discussion
From Fig. 2(a), for the conduction band (CB), we observe that the band along Γ–Z–Γ is much more dispersive than that along other directions, and that the bandwidth along G–Z–G is larger. Then we use the 1D tight-binding model to fit the CB (see the ESI†), and obtain the hopping energy along the c direction up to 0.224 eV. This value is close to the hopping energy of holes in BDT, and thus indicates an equivalently strong electronic coupling along the c direction. Comparatively, the band along Γ–X and Γ−Y directions is flat, which indicates a smaller electron hopping energy and thus weaker in-plane electronic couplings. On the other hand, from the projected band structure and the partial density of states, we can learn that the strong coupling originates from the overlap of vertical pz orbitals. Meanwhile, the charge density of the CB in Fig. 2(b) shows that nitrogen atoms at the top corners of triangles do not contribute pz orbitals to the CB. That is, electrons are confined within the a–b plane but prefer to move along the c direction. This feature is consistent with the conclusion from a previous study that PCNs have predominantly inter-planar electron transport.39 The predominantly inter-planar or 1D-like electron transport property of PCNs is advantageous in TE applications.61 The density of states (DOS) of PCNs also shows a large asymmetry around the Fermi level. It indicates large Seebeck coefficients of PCNs as Seebeck coefficients involve an integral over eigenvalues around the Fermi level.

With the knowledge of the inter-planar electron transport of PCNs, we have explored two more similar types of stacked carbon nitrides, g-CN1 and g-CN2,62 the lattice structures of which are shown in Fig. 1(c)–(f). We calculated their band structures, which are shown in Fig. 2(e) and (f). The CB and valence band (VB) of both band structures are more dispersive along Γ−M and Γ−K than those along Γ−A, which indicates stronger in-plane electronic couplings and thus larger electrical conductivities along the in-plane directions, compared with those along the out-of-plane direction. That is to say, the electron transport along the in-plane directions dominates in g-CN1 and g-CN2. Therefore, we focus on the PCN in the following TE performance calculations.
We calculate the TE coefficients of the PCN along the c direction, using the band model and the Boltzmann transport equation. To validate our band model for charge transport in organic materials, we calculate hopping rates of the CB of the PCN, and the reorganization energy of melem monomers that constitute the PCN. Details are provided in the ESI.† The hopping rates of the CB are comparable to the reorganization energy, so the band model is acceptable.29,63Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the TE coefficients as a function of doping concentration. Seebeck coefficients below 300 K decrease from 50 to 500 μV K−1 when the carrier concentration increases from 1019 to 1021 cm−3. These Seebeck values are comparable to those of inorganic materials, for example, silicon and single-layer MoS2 which have a ZT maximum in the same concentration range and have a Seebeck coefficient up to 300 μV K−1 below 300 K.10,64

The electrical conductivity of the PCN increases when the carrier concentration increases. In the range between 1019 and 1021 cm−3, the cross-plane electrical conductivity of the PCN has an order of magnitude of 105 S m−1. We calculated the intrinsic mobility of the PCN which is about 8.55 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons below 300 K, which gives a reasonable explanation for its high electrical conductivity. This mobility value is high for organic materials but not restricted to PCNs. As Troisi suggests,65 if the reorganization energy is similar to or smaller than that of rubrene (the inner part is 159 meV (ref. 66)), and the vdW interaction between atoms is involved in the frontier orbitals of neighboring molecules, essentially any highly purified crystalline molecular material may have a sufficiently large mobility in the 1–50 cm2 V−1 s−1 range. It indicates that π-stacking organic materials with low reorganization energy values have favorable cross-plane charge transport.
In organic materials, band theories are able to predict the high mobility which is consistent with experiments. Shuai et al. adopted the electronic band model to calculate the electron mobility of pentacene and rubrene which agrees well with experimental measurements.32,67,68 In addition, a band-like model can be considered valid if transfer integrals are larger than or comparable to reorganization energy. We calculate the upper limit of reorganization energy of the PCN to be 0.296 eV which is close to the calculated transfer integrals of electrons, details provided in the ESI.† In our calculations, we have considered the contribution of acoustic phonon modes. Polar optical phonon (POP) scattering can also be important, such as in GaAs and GaN,69,70 which was considered as associated with large electronegativity differences among component elements.71,72 However, recent research on MoS2 and WS2 showed that the longitudinal acoustic phonon scattering dominates despite their large electronegativity.73 The electronegativity difference between carbon and nitrogen is comparable to that of GaAs. The relation between electronegativity and POP scattering deserves further study. Anyway, it is still safe to say that our calculations overestimate the relaxation time and the electrical conductivity of the PCN, since we only consider the longitudinal acoustic phonon scattering.

Fig. 3(b) shows the thermal conductivity of the PCN, the electronic part κe and the lattice part κph. Within the range from 1020 to 1021 cm−3, κe is comparable to or even larger than κph. As for phonon transport, the lattice thermal conductivity is 0.77 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K. To clarify the contribution of the overlap of pz orbitals to lattice thermal conductivity, other simulations are performed just considering vdW interactions between interlayers. It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity is 0.55 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K within the range (0.1–1.0 m−1 K−1)74–78 of the common amorphous polymers due to the weak intermolecular interactions of vdW nature (more details in the ESI†). Therefore, compared with the weak vdW interactions between interlayers, the overlap of pz orbitals in the PCN does slightly enhance the thermal transport. In addition, Zhang et al.79 studied the phonon transport of h-BN-supported single-layer-graphene along the in-plane direction with different stacking orders. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, they found that different stacking orders can lead to around 9% difference in the in-plane thermal conductivity for the system size of L = 400 nm.
With the electronic and phononic properties, we obtain the ZT profiles of the PCN which are shown in Fig. 3(c). The optimal ZT values at room temperature are 0.52 with an n-type carrier concentration of 1.23 × 1020 cm−3 and 0.28 with a p-type carrier concentration of 5.45 × 1020 cm−3. At the optimal carrier concentration of electrons, the PF is 17.92 μW cm−1 K−2 and the total thermal conductivity is 1.03 W m−1 K−1. The p-type thermoelectric performance is overestimated, as the valence band does not exhibit a large bandwidth along the Γ−Z direction. The hole hopping energies along the c direction are much smaller than the electron hopping energies, indicating that the band model may lose its validity and overestimate the electrical conductivity of holes. PCNs can be doped as n-type materials and contribute to the n-type TE group. Fig. 3(d) shows the maximum ZT values from 100 to 400 K. The ZT of PCNs has the same order of magnitude as that of typical herringbone stacked molecules. The calculated optimal ZT of pentacene and rubrene are 1.8 and 0.6 at room temperature, respectively.67 Herringbone stacked BDT is predicted to have a peculiar 1D band structure and an optimal ZT of 1.48 at room temperature.35
Due to a capability for TE conversion along the cross-plane direction, PCNs can be distinguished from layered materials, specifically inorganic materials such as graphene, MoS2 and black phosphorus, and thus regarded as a complementary material to 2D TE materials. This feature does not only exist in PCNs, as layered inorganic heterostructures also exhibit high ZT along the perpendicular directions. Esfarjani et al. studied the TE performance of vdW graphene/phosphorene/graphene heterostructures with a predicted ZT of 0.13 below 600 K.80 Similarly, graphene/MoS2 vdW heterostructures are calculated to have a ZT as large as 2.8 at room temperature.81 The phonon transport along the cross-plane direction is highly suppressed in both structures. Compared with these nanoscale heterostructures, PCNs are bulk materials and should be easier to prepare in experiments and to scale up. The violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law is another interesting feature of organic materials with low-dimensional charge transport properties. Fig. S3 (see the ESI)† shows the violation of the Wiedemann–Franz law, which is also observed in other quasi 1D organic systems.27,35,82 The normalized value is smaller than one, indicating a higher ratio of electrical conductivity to electronic thermal conductivity in PCNs than that predicted by the Wiedemann–Franz law, and thus a preferable feature in TE applications.
Before closing, we compare the PCN, g-CN1, g-CN2 and A–A stacked graphite to search for the possible lattice structure that materials can have to obtain high cross-plane ZT. The cross-plane direction corresponds to the small lattice thermal conductivity because of no covalent bonds and suppressed lattice vibrations, so strong couplings of electrons or holes along the cross-plane direction are preferable for high ZT values. In organic materials, the layer distance and the stacking motif are considered to affect the couplings.83,84 g-CN1 and g-CN2 have nearly the same layer distances as the PCN, but their band structures exhibit weak electronic couplings between neighboring layers. Our calculated charge density of g-CN1 and g-CN2 shows the same feature in Fig. 4. We found that the pz orbitals of the CB in Fig. 4(a) and (c) indicate the existence of the overlap of pz orbitals. But due to their A–B stacked structures, the coupling is much weaker than that in the PCN as the coupling distance is nearly twice as that in the PCN. The pz orbitals of the VB in Fig. 4(b) and (d) lie horizontally, showing that holes cannot transfer effectively along the cross-plane direction. So an A–A stacked motif or a small coupling distance will be essential for strong inter-planar electronic couplings and the excellent cross-plane TE performance.

For (a) and (b), the isosurface value is set to 0.01 e Bohr−3 for positive and negative cases. For (c) and (d), the isosurface value is set to 0.005 e Bohr−3. 
Besides, the in-plane electron confinement is necessary. For A–A stacked graphite, the stacking motif and the electronic coupling distance are nearly the same as those of the PCN. However, electrons and holes are more likely to move within the plane of graphite, because pz orbitals in graphite form delocalized π bonds in plane. In contrast, the in-plane electron confinement is caused in the PCN because the nitrogen atoms connecting the heptazine-like units contribute no pz orbitals to the CB. Thus, the pz orbitals of the PCN are discontinuously distributed and the π bonds are localized along the in-plane directions. In such a case, charges are more likely to transport from one layer to another which results in 1D-like charge transport. Overall, we conclude that small electronic coupling distances along the cross-plane direction and the in-plane confinement effect are responsible for promising cross-plane TE performance.
Conclusions
We investigated the TE performance of an A–A stacked PCN using first-principles calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the PCN has a high ZT up to 0.52 at 300 K along the c direction, and can contribute to n-type TE groups. The overlap of pz orbitals and the in-plane electron confinement induce 1D charge transport and large cross-plane power factors that are comparable to those of silicon and single-layer MoS2. The lattice thermal conductivity contributed by the overlap of pz orbitals is considered and found to enhance the thermal transport. By comparing three carbon nitrides and A–A stacked graphite, we find that small electronic coupling distances along the cross-plane direction and the in-plane confinement effect induce the 1D charge transport and TE advantages. This study can benefit the pursuit of a high cross-plane ZT in other layered materials.

 	Fig. 1  Lattice structures of an A–A stacked PCN (a and b), g-CN1 (g-C3N4) (c and d) and g-CN2 (tri-g-C3N4) (e and f).	 

 		 

 		 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The projected band structure and pDOS of PCN. (b) Charge density of the conduction band of PCN. The purple space shows the charge density. The isosurface value is set as 2 × 10−7e Bohr−3 for positive and negative cases. (c) The Brillouin zone of the orthorhombic lattice and high-symmetric paths for the PCN band structure. (d) The Brillouin zone of the hexagonal lattice and high-symmetric paths for band structures of g-CN1 and g-CN2. The a*, b*, and c* are reciprocal lattice vectors. (e) The band structure of g-CN1. (f) The band structure of g-CN2.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a)–(c) TE coefficients of PCN versus n-type (n) and p-type (p) carrier concentrations below 300 K. The arrows point to scales for Seebeck coefficients and the power factor: (a) the electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficients; (b) electronic (κe), lattice (κph) and total (κ) thermal conductivity; (c) ZT and the power factor; (d) The ZT maximum dependence on temperature from 100 to 400 K.	 

 	Fig. 4  The charge density of the CB and the VB of g-CN1 and g-CN2: (a) CB of g-CN1; (b) VB of g-CN1; (c) CB of g-CN2; and (d) VB of g-CN2. For (a) and (b), the isosurface value is set to 0.01 e Bohr−3 for positive and negative cases. For (c) and (d), the isosurface value is set to 0.005 e Bohr−3.
