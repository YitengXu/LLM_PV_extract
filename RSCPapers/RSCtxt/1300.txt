1 Introduction
Graphene, with a two-dimensional (2D) sp2-hybridized carbon structure in a single-atom-thick sheet, has rapidly emerged as one of the most attractive materials.1–4 The intriguing physicochemical properties of graphene, including its Young's modulus up to 1 TPa, ultimate strength up to 130 GPa, thermal conductivity up to 5000 W mK−1, electrical conductivity up to 6000 S cm−1 and high surface area with a theoretical limitation of 2630 m2 g−1, make it promising for various applications, such as batteries,5,6 supercapacitors,7,8 fuel cells,9 photovoltaic devices,10–14 and biosensors.15–23
Previous studies demonstrated that the combination of polymers with carbonaceous materials, such as carbon black and carbon nanotubes, can significantly enhance the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the polymers.24 Therefore, graphene and its derivatives, as new filler materials, have been integrated with different polymer matrices to generate a new class of polymer nanocomposites.25 It is well known that the properties of the polymer composites strongly rely on the dispersion state of the filler materials.26 However, it was a challenge to obtain well-dispersed single-layer graphene nanosheets in the polymer matrix.27 Recently, stable aqueous dispersions of polymer-coated graphene oxide (GO) composites with enhanced physicochemical properties have been successfully developed via a chemical approach by Ruoff and co-workers based on the Hummers method.28–30 This strategy gave a new method for the fabrication of graphene-based polymer composites. To date, a variety of graphene-based polymer nanocomposites have been developed to optimize the properties and performances of polymers for specific applications, including graphene–epoxy composites with improved thermal conductivity,31 graphene–poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) composites with improved flame-retardant property,32 graphene–polypropylene composites with enhanced flexural properties and lower percolation threshold,33 graphene–polystyrene composites with increased viscosity and enhanced mechanical properties,34 graphene–poly(vinyl alcohol) composite with enhanced mechanical strength,35 graphene–thermoplastic polyurethane composite with increased optical/electric properties,36,37 graphene–nylon composites with increased electrical conductivity,38 graphene–poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) with improved dispersibility,28 and graphene–polyaniline (PANI) composites with increased capacitance.39
Semiconductor conjugated polymers (CPs) are macromolecules with electron-delocalized unsaturated backbones linked by alternating double, triple bonds, aromatic or hetero-aromatic rings.40 They are considered as organic semiconductors in their neutral states or metallic conductors after doping.41 Hence, CPs have been extensively investigated for device applications, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), photovoltaic cells, organic field-effect transistors (OFET), organic lasers, solar cells and supercapacitors.41 In addition to the good solubility and intrinsic electronic features of CPs, theoretical investigation reveals that the π–π interaction between CP and graphene can tailor the band gap of graphene.42 Consequently, considering these promising aspects, semiconductor CPs have been incorporated with graphene to form advanced functional nanocomposites. These nanocomposites can combine the advantage of graphene with that of CPs, which thus provide platforms for various electronic device applications.
In this minireview, we mainly focus on the recent advances in the development of graphene–CP nanocomposites and their electronic device applications. Herein, the graphene–CP nanocomposites are simply divided into two categories: non-covalent and covalent nanocomposites. Water-soluble and organo-soluble CPs, including polyanilines (PANIs),43 polypyrroles (PPys),44 poly(thiophene)s (PTs)45 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),46 were used to non-covalently modify graphene. On the other hand, CPs terminated with reactive functional groups (e.g. –NH2, –MeOH, etc.), such as triphenylamine-based polyazomethine (TPAPAM),47 P3HT48 and fluorene-, thiophene-, benzothiadiazole-based copolymers,49 were covalently bonded to graphene to form nanocomposites.
2 Non-covalent graphene–CP nanocomposites
The application of graphene-based materials in micro- and nanoelectronic devices not only demands the easy integration and homogeneous distribution of the graphene-based materials in various matrices, but also requires the preservation of the intrinsic electrical properties of graphene in the devices.50 In this regard, the non-covalent functionalization of graphene with CPs, which is a non-destructive method occurring between the basal plane of graphene and CPs and modifies the graphene without significantly altering its chemical structure, is preferred as a facile way to obtain dispersive graphene–CP nanocomposites for device applications.51–53
2.1 Water-soluble CPs
As graphene with good solubility does not exist in nature,54,55 the chemical reduction of GO is considered as one of the most popular approaches to develop functionalized graphene, i.e. reduced graphene oxide (rGO). However, rGO is still highly hydrophobic, and thus experiences very limited solubility or even irreversible aggregation during its preparation, which is inconvenient for the further processing of rGO.29 To circumvent this problem, our group first reported the utilization of water-soluble CPs to obtain highly water-soluble rGO–CP nanocomposites. In this method, the in situ reduction process of GO in the presence of the specially designed CPs (PFVSO3 and PEG-OPE) occurred to directly afford the highly soluble rGO–CP nanocomposites (rGO–PFVSO3 and rGO–PEG-OPE), which took advantage of the strong π–π interactions between the CPs and rGO as the non-covalent binding force (Fig. 1 and 2).51,52

 Fig. 2  (a) Schematic illustration of the synthesis of PEG-OPE–rGO in H2O. Step 1: oxidation of graphite yields single-layer GO sheets. Step 2: chemical reduction of GO with hydrazine in the presence of PEG-OPE produces a stable aqueous suspension of PEG-OPE–rGO; (b) photograph of PEG-OPE–rGO dispersed in different solvents ([PEG-OPE–rGO] = 1.22 mg mL−1). Reprinted with permission from ref. 52. 
As shown in Fig. 1, PFVSO3 has a planar backbone structure attached with SO32− and oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) as the side chains. The resulting rGO–PFVSO3 nanocomposite can be dispersed well in polar solvents, including water, ethanol, methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and dimethylformamide (DMF). It is because the backbone of PFVSO3 imparts the π–π stacking, and its sulfonate and OEG side chains orient away from the surface of rGO, serving as a hydrophilic repulsion layer to facilitate the dispersion of rGO in the polar media via both steric and electrostatic repulsions.51 Due to the p-doping of PFVSO3 to rGO, the electrical conductivity of rGO–PFVSO3 nanocomposite film increased to about 218 S m−1, almost six orders of magnitude higher than that of the GO film (2.58 × 10−4 S m−1) and also better than the unmodified rGO (3.82 × 10−3 to 9.38 × 10−1 S m−1).52
In order to further improve the solubility of graphene–CP nanocomposites, PEG-OPE (Fig. 1), an amphiphilic coil–rod–coil conjugated triblock copolymer, was also used to modify rGO. This polymer has one lipophilic π-conjugated oligomer that can attach to the basal plane of rGO via strong π–π stacking, and two hydrophilic PEG coils that can orient away from rGO surface to produce an amphiphilic outer layer (Fig. 2a). The solubility of rGO–PEG-OPE nanocomposite was evaluated considering the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs).56 The modified rGO–PEG-OPE nanocomposite could be dispersed not only in acetone, THF, DMF, DMSO and ethanol with the value of δP + δH in the range of 13–29, but also in solvents with high polarity (δP + δH above 29, such as water and ethanol) and low polarity (δP + δH below 13 such as toluene and chloroform) (Fig. 2b).52
Similar to our method, another water-soluble CP, poly(2,5-bis(3-sulfonatopropoxy)-1,4-ethynylphenylene-alt-1,4-ethynylphenylene (PPE-SO3−) (Fig. 1) was employed by the Niu group to produce a stable dispersion of graphene–PPE-SO3− nanocomposite in water.57 The surface resistance of the nanocomposite was measured to be 30 kΩ, which was comparable to the rGO film (10 kΩ) and rGO–PFVSO3 (30 kΩ with a film thickness of 150 nm).58 This additional example further proves that the utilization of water-soluble CPs as stabilizers is a universal method for the preparation of highly soluble graphene-based nanocomposites.
2.2 Polyanilines
Polyanilines (PANIs) (Fig. 1), a class of commercialized light weight CPs with high capacitance, have been incorporated with graphene by electrostatic and π–π interactions.43 The in situ polymerization method was used to polymerize aniline in a suspension of GO or rGO in acidic solution, forming the graphene–PANI nanocomposite (Fig. 3a).43 The developed rGO–PANI nanocomposites were used as supercapacitor electrodes (Fig. 3b) since they had a specific capacitance as high as 480 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and good cycling stability.59 The similar result with a specific capacitance of 300–500 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 was also reported.60 Moreover, a flexible and paper-like rGO–PANI nanofiber composite (Fig. 3c) for supercapacitor electrodes was simply fabricated by filtration of the mixed PANI and rGO solution.59 The obtained film possessed a layered structure within which the PANI-nanofibers were uniformly sandwiched between rGO layers (Fig. 3c).59 The fabricated supercapacitor devices had a large electrochemical capacitance (210 F g−1) at a discharge rate of 0.3 A g−1 (Fig. 3d). About 94% of this capacitance could be maintained (197 F g−1) as the discharging current density was increased from 0.3 to 3 A g−1. Furthermore, the capacitor has good stability and a high capacitance of 155 F g−1 was maintained after 800 charging–discharging cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1 (Fig. 3e).59 Subsequently, the influences of aniline concentration and PANI morphology on the capacitive property were systematically investigated.61 As demonstrated in Fig. 4, the PANI nanowires nucleated on the GO surface and grew vertically and hierarchically from the GO substrate in the dilute polymerization process. The specific capacitance of GO–PANI increased with increasing aniline concentration from 0.01 to 0.05 M, until as high as 555 F g−1 at 0.05 M aniline. The capacitance still kept as high as 227 F g−1 even at the higher discharge current density of 2 A g−1.61

In addition to the supercapacitor electrodes, rGO–PANI nanocomposites have also been employed as organic semiconductors. The P–N junction with rGO as the n-type layer and PANI as the p-type layer was fabricated by the epitaxial growth of crystalline PANI on rGO.62 As illustrated in Fig. 5, single crystalline PANI films directly grow along certain lattice directions of the rGO surface. The fabricated high quality P–N junction owns diode-like behaviour with remarkably low turn-on voltage (60 mV) and high rectification ratio (1880:1) within the voltage range up to 0.2 V.62 A solid-state charge-transfer complex was made by the rGO–PANI nanocomposites, within which the rGO and PANI acted as electron acceptor and donor, respectively.63 The reported charge-transfer phenomena of the rGO–PANI nanocomposite provided the possibility for its further applications in flexible plastic and wearable electronics. Besides the aforementioned studies, the role of GO in the layered graphene–PANI nanocomposite was also investigated. This revealed that the π–π planar structure and carboxyl groups of GO served as template and dopant in the formation of the layered structure.64 Moreover, the controllable growth of PANI nanoparticles on GO in the presence of different dopants was also studied.66 As reported, when HCl was used as the dopant, graphene sheets would be coated by PANI nanoparticles with an average diameter of 230 nm. In contrast, when selenious acid (SELA) was used, PANI nanostructures with rod and sphere shapes (both with the average diameter of 150 nm), at dopant–monomer (D/M) molar ratios of 0.5 and 2, respectively, would appear in the composites.65

2.3 Polypyrroles
Polypyrroles (PPys), as a class of traditional CPs (Fig. 1) with excellent capacity, high atmospheric stability and high conductivity, have been used as the most promising electrode materials for applications in supercapacitors and bio-sensors.66 Similar to PANIs, GO–PPy nanocomposites with good capacitance can be synthesized by in situ polymerization of pyrrole in a suspension of GO, involving electrostatic interactions between PPy and GO.66 The morphology of PPy in the layered sandwiched GO–PPy nanocomposites varied when different surfactant micelles were used.44 GO–PPy-fiber and GO–PPy-sphere (Fig. 6) were synthesized in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), respectively. Both of them had very high specific capacitances over 500 F g−1 at a low current density (0.3 A g−1). However, when the current density increased to 5 A g−1, only GO–PPy-fiber had a high capacitance retention ratio (about 70%), because of the morphology-dependent lower ion transport resistance in GO–PPy-fiber at higher current density.44 The electrical studies revealed that the Pt neural micro-electrode with GO–PPy coating had lower impedance (26 kΩ) and higher charge capacity density (278.83 mC cm−2) compared to that with PPy coating, which had an impedance of 115 kΩ and charge capacity density of 190.98 mC cm−2.67

On the other hand, rGO–PPy nanocomposites synthesized via an electrochemical method for bio-applications have also attracted much attention. This is not only due to the good electronic and ionic conductivity of the rGO–PPy nanocomposites, but also owing to their biocompatibility and porous structure, which increased the surface area of the electrode.67 As reported, the porous rGO–PPy coated glassy carbon electrode exhibited good selectivity and sensitivity for the detection of dopamine (DA) in human blood serum.68 The sensing performance of the modified electrodes to DA in the presence of high concentrations of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) was studied by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), revealing a linear range of 0.1–150 μM with a detection limit of 23 nM (S/N = 3).68
A PPy derivate, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP) (Fig. 1), was also used to synthesize rGO–PEDOP nanocomposites via the electrochemical method.69 The modified rGO served as a dopant to form layered rGO–PEDOP nanocomposites and also acted as an electron conductor to connect the PEDOP polymers for generating a homogeneous distribution of conducting regions. The formation of electron conduit was supported by a 2-fold increment in DC electronic conductivity compared to the PEDOP.69
2.4 Poly(thiophene)s
Poly(thiophene) derivatives (PTs) have high conductivities, good environmental stability, structural versatility, high optical transparency, large pseudo capacitance and enhanced nonlinear response.70 P3HT (Fig. 1) was used to stabilize rGO in the reduction process through π–π interactions.46 The resulting rGO–P3HT nanocomposite exhibited good dispersity in chloroform and high storage stability (>20 days). Moreover, the photoluminescence (PL) of P3HT was greatly quenched by addition of GO or rGO, indicating strong electron/energy transfer from P3HT to the graphene sheets.45 The strong interaction between GO or rGO and P3HT made this nanocomposite work well as the active layer for light to electricity conversion in a photovoltaic device (Fig. 7a).45 After annealing the device at 160 °C to remove the functional groups from graphene sheets (Fig. 7b–e), the device efficiency was increased up to 1.1% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.72 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 4.0 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.38.45

Reprinted with permission from ref. 45. 
Similarly, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) (Fig. 1) with good electrical conductivity and aqueous dispersibility, was used to produce a stable aqueous suspension of rGO–PEDOT nanocomposite for the application of transparent and flexible electrode.71 The rGO–PEDOT film on a quartz substrate exhibited a lower sheet resistance of 27.3 kΩ sq.−1 compared to the rGO film (40 kΩ sq.−1) at a transparency of 81%.71 Moreover, because of the large pseudo capacitance, the rGO–PEDOT nanocomposite synthesized by oxidation polymerization techniques was employed as the electrode in a supercapacitor, which provided a faster electrochemical reaction with an average capacity of 350 F g−1.
2.5 Poly(phenylene vinylene)s
Poly(phenylene vinylene)s (PPVs), whose backbones are formed by alternating aromatic rings and double bonds, are capable of electroluminescence and can be applied for applications such as OLEDs. Poly[2-methoxy-5-(20-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) (Fig. 1) decorated GO (GO–MEH-PPV) nanocomposite was fabricated by a simple non-solvent induced precipitation method.72 The GO–MEH-PPV film was superhydrophobic, which was attributed to the increase of surface roughness due to the random decoration of MEH-PPV nanoparticles on the graphene sheets. The MEH-PPV nanoparticles endowed the GO–MEH-PPV nanocomposite film with strong PL. The film also had excellent conductivity up to 382 S m−1, higher than that of MEH-PPV (8.8 × 10−8 S m−1).73 On the other hand, the electronic structure characteristics of graphene–PPVs were theoretically investigated based on the first-principles density functional theory by taking the nanocomposite of graphene and poly[(m-phenylene vinylene)-alt-(p-phenylene vinylene)] (PmPV) as an example.39 The results revealed that the band gap of a graphene nanoribbon with fixed width could be tailored by CP through the non-covalent functionalization, which opens up a window to optimize the device performance.42
2.6 Polyfluorenes
As compared to PPVs, polyfluorenes (PFs) have relatively higher PL quantum efficiency and better thermal stability, thus, they were also intensively employed in the fabrication of OLEDs.73 As one of the most widely studied PF derivatives, poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-thiophene) (PDOFT) (Fig. 1) was incorporated with rGO by the in situ reduction of GO.74 The OLED device with rGO–PDOFT nanocomposite as the active layer had a maximum luminescence of 5908 cd m−2 at an operating voltage of 9.5 V, and a higher corresponding power efficiency at 0.38 cd A−1 than PDOFT (0.15 cd A−1). Other PF derivatives including poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-1,4-yleneethylene-2,5-dihexyloxybenzene) (PFEP) and anthraquinone-attached PFEP (PFEP-ANT) (Fig. 1) were also employed in OLEDs. The results revealed that the physical and electronic properties of rGO–PFs nanocomposites can be altered by the inclusion of functional side groups.75 The presence of ANT in PFEP significantly improved the dispersibility of rGO–PFEP nanocomposites and also increased the electron transfer between the polymer and rGO.75
3 Covalent graphene–CP nanocomposites
Different to the non-covalent functionalization, covalent functionalization is another approach for the preparation of graphene–CP nanocomposites. In this method, CPs were covalently grafted to graphene through chemical reactions between the functional groups of CPs and those of GO or rGO.25 GO, with plenty of reactive oxygenated groups on its basal plane or edge, is the preferential candidate for covalent grafting. For instance, triphenylamine-based polyazomethine (TPAPAM) containing the terminal –NH2 group, was covalently grafted onto GO via the surface-bonded acyl chloride moieties (GO–COCl) for the fabrication of a rewritable memory device (Fig. 8a).47 The device showed a typical bistable electrical switching and nonvolatile rewritable memory effect, with a turn-on voltage of ca. −1 V and an ON/OFF current ratio of over 103. Both the ON and OFF states were stable under a constant voltage stress, and survived up to 108 read cycles at a read voltage of −1.0 V.47 Subsequently, a new CP, poly[{9,9-di(triphenylamine)fluorene}(9,9-dihexylfluorene)(4-aminophenylcarbazole)]) (PFCz) with NH2-terminated side chains, was synthesized (Fig. 8b). This polymer was also grafted onto GO through the reaction with GO–COCl producing a soluble GO–PFCz nanocomposite (Fig. 8b). Apart from the similar device performance of GO–TPAPAM, the ON state of the GO–PFCz based memory device can even withstand a constant voltage stress of −1 V for 3 h.76

In addition to memory device applications, CP-grafted GO composites were developed for photovoltaic devices.48 As shown in Fig. 8c, the MeOH-terminated P3HT chains were covalently linked onto GO sheets via the esterification of carboxylic groups in GO. The fabricated GO–P3HT nanocomposite based bilayer photovoltaic device showed a 200% increase in the power conversion efficiency (η = 0.61%) with respect to its P3HT/C60 counterpart under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2).48
In addition to GO, the surface of rGO can also be modified by CPs to form useful electronic materials. For instance, fluorene-, thiophene-, and benzothiadazole-based copolymers (FTBs) (Fig. 9) were covalently grafted to the rGO surface and applied in the optical-limiting device application.49 The synthesis process of the rGO–FTBs nanocomposite is presented in Fig. 9. First, the GO was reduced in the presence of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). Then the rGO based synthon was prepared by covalently grafting 4-bromophenyl groups onto the rGO sheets. Finally, the rGO–FTBs nanocomposites were synthesized by a Suzuki polymerization in the presence of modified rGO, monomer 4 and 1 or 3. These rGO–FTBs nanocomposites exhibited an excellent optical-limiting effect with a 532 nm laser beam. The optical-limiting threshold energy values (0.93 J cm−2 for rGO–FTB1 and 1.12 J cm−2 for rGO–FTB2) of these graphene–polymer hybrids were better than that of carbon nanotubes (3.6 J cm−2), offering potential applications in the protection of optical sensors, human eyes, and optical elements from high-intensity laser beams.50

4 Conclusions
Graphene–conjugated polymer (CP) nanocomposites formed by non-covalent interaction or covalent grafting methods are reviewed. The non-covalent graphene–CP nanocomposites can be synthesized in many ways, such as in situ reduction of rGO in the presence of CPs, in situ polymerization of CP monomers in the suspension of GO or rGO, epitaxial growth of crystalline CPs on rGO surface, electrochemical synthesis of rGO–CP starting from CP monomers, photo-polymerization of adsorbed monomer on rGO surface, and non-solvent induced precipitation of GO–CP nanocomposites. In these methods, π–π interactions, electrostatic interactions and van der Waals forces play important roles in the formation of stable systems. These nanocomposites have shown potential applications in supercapacitors, photovoltaic devices, OLEDs, and biosensing devices. On the other hand, the covalent graphene–CP nanocomposites can be achieved by reaction of CP or CP monomers with the functional groups on the surface of graphene, which include the acylation reaction between NH2-terminated CP and GO–COCl, esterification between MeOH-terminated CP and GO–COCl, and Suzuki polymerization of CP monomer and PhBr-terminated rGO. These nanocomposites were applied in rewritable memory devices, photovoltaic devices and NLO devices. With the combination of advantages of CP and graphene, the improved electrical and optical properties are demonstrated in both non-covalent and covalent graphene–CP nanocomposites, offering better device performance as compared to those based on the polymers.
In addition to graphene, other 2D materials, such as metal dichalcogenide nanosheets, have recently attracted tremendous attention due to their outstanding performance in device applications.77–94 These 2D materials might also be hybridized with suitable CPs to yield some promising prospects. Therefore, the current studies and findings on graphene–CP composites can provide inspirational thoughts and fundamental guidelines for researchers to explore this thriving scientific field.
