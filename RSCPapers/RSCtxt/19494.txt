    , Accepted 27th October 2016First published on 27th October 2016AbstractAmorphous (a-) Sb2S3 nanoparticle aggregates were synthesized using a facile polyol-mediated process at room temperature and their Na-ion storage capability was evaluated. Owing to the spherical nano-aggregate morphology and amorphous structure, the a-Sb2S3 anode exhibited superior rate capability and cycling stability compared to that of crystalline, microscale Sb2S3 particles. The a-Sb2S3 electrode was also examined as an anode for eco-friendly, Na metal-free seawater flow batteries.
In order to break away from the fossil fuel economy, usher in the era of renewable energy and pursue sustainable development of our societies, much effort has been devoted to developing effective solutions in a variety of social and technological fields.1 One such approach that has drawn considerable attention is the development of technologies for conversion and storage of renewable energy such as nuclear, wind, solar, and geothermal power.1–3 Rechargeable batteries, as one of the options for electrical energy storage (EES), may be vital for the integration of intermittent energy such as generated from renewable resources into the electrical grid.2–4 Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have long been recognized as a primary EES technology for powering a variety of electronic systems, including portable devices and electric vehicles. Furthermore, they are promising candidates for large-scale EES systems due to their high energy densities, long lifespans, and reasonable prices per unit energy.3–6 However, increasing utilization of LIBs has caused concerns about escalating prices and long-term availability due to limited accessibility to global lithium reserves.6,7
Over the past few years, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have been investigated intensively as a promising alternative to LIBs because of the relatively high abundance and low cost of Na, as well as its suitable redox potential (E0 = −2.71 vs. SHE).7–9 Despite the expectation of cost reduction with minimum sacrifice of battery performance, many obstacles remain to be resolved prior to practical implementation of NIBs.7–9 One of the main issues is the development of anode materials with high specific capacity, high rate capability, and long cycle life. In contrast with LIBs, Na ions do not favour insertion into the interplanes of graphite anodes, but rather deposition onto the surface.10 A high-capacity Si anode for a LIB does not reversibly store Na-ions at ambient conditions.11 The larger ionic radius of Na compared to Li induces huge stress changes and thereby leads to severe mechanical fracturing of the active materials (anodes), as well as a slower ionic diffusion rate (limited rate performance) during cycling, giving rise to poor rate and cycling performance.7–9 In this respect, constructing anodes with the desired properties is of high importance for realizing low-cost, high-performance NIBs that can replace existing LIBs. Among the various candidates for NIB anodes,7–9 antimony sulphides (Sb2S3) and their composites have recently been reported to provide excellent anode performance.12–14 Sb2S3 has a theoretical capacity of 946 mA h g−1 based on the conversion reaction (Sb2S3 + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Sb + 3Na2S) and subsequent alloying reaction (2Sb + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Na3Sb). Owing to the relative reversibility of the formation of sodium sulphides (NaxS) compared to the formation of sodium oxides (NaxO), along with the fast reaction kinetics of Sb with Na ions (alloying/dealloying), Sb2S3-based anodes show great promise for NIBs.12,15,16 Nevertheless, resolution of the substantial volume change issue stemming from sodiation/desodiation of Sb still remains a prerequisite for practical application. Typically, Sb2S3 crystallites adopt anisotropic morphologies, such as one-dimensional nanowire arrays and microrods, because of their unusual chain-type structure (SbxSy)n, where Sb and S atoms are bound in infinite hexagonal sheets held together by van der Waals forces. In contrast, an amorphous structure that is isotropic in nature is expected to more effectively mitigate the large volume change exerted during repeated cycles, thereby enhancing cycling stability.17,18
Herein, we report a spherical, amorphous (a-) Sb2S3 nano-aggregate anode prepared using a simple polyol route at room temperature, which is distinct from previous reports that utilized rather cumbersome synthetic pathways under high-temperature conditions (mostly, hydrothermal methods) to form crystalline Sb2S3.12–14 The Na ion storage properties of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode are evaluated, demonstrating its superior electrochemical properties, such as good cycling stability and rate capability as compared to a commercial, crystalline Sb2S3 electrode. Furthermore, the full-cell performance of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode is examined for application to eco-friendly, Na metal-free seawater flow batteries.
The a-Sb2S3 nanoparticles were synthesized by a reaction of a Sb-precursor solution (SbCl3) with a sulphur-precursor solution (thioacetamide, TAA) in ethylene glycol (EG) medium at room temperature in ambient air. As the reaction proceeded, the clear solution mixture changed to opaque orange and then to red. The red precipitates were acquired via washing and drying procedures (refer to ESI†) and examined by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1a displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 particles. The particles consisted of spherical aggregates of sub-constituent nanoparticles with diameters of 150–300 nm (Fig. 1a, inset), which was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 1b. The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized nanoparticles showed a peak typical of amorphous species (top panel of Fig. 1c). In the early stage, a Sb–glycolate complex was formed by dissolving the SbCl3 precursor in EG, which acted as a chelating agent, preventing fast hydrolysis and oxidation of SbCl3 (SbCl3 + H2O → SbOCl + 2HCl); EG also acted as the dispersion medium for uniform formation of the final Sb2S3 spheres. The reaction with TAA, which offers S2− ions in the EG medium, then promoted gradual transformation of the Sb–glycolates into SbSx nuclei, the growth (Ostwald ripening) of which led to aggregation of the spherical nanoparticles to form an amorphous structure.
 Fig. 1  SEM (a) and TEM (b) images, XRD pattern (c), and Raman spectrum (d) of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 nanoparticles (red). The bottom and middle panels in (c) show the XRD patterns of orthorhombic Sb2S3 as a reference (JCPDS no. 42-1393) and the Sb2S3 nanoparticles after heating at 250 °C in N2 atmosphere (black), respectively. The Raman spectrum of heat-treated Sb2S3 is depicted in the bottom panel of (d). 
To evaluate the structural characteristics of the as-synthesized nanoparticles in more detail, the thermal behavior was first probed by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyses (TG-DTA) under a N2 atmosphere. The DTA graph showed two notable endothermic regions (Fig. S1†). The former, at ∼198 °C, accompanied a sharp weight loss, followed by a gradual weight loss up to ∼300 °C, which was plausibly attributed to the evaporation of a small amount of the EG component and subsequent pyrolysis of other organic residues remaining within the as-synthesized nanoparticles. On the other hand, the latter endothermic region at ∼558 °C was due to melting of the SbSx nanoparticles. Based on the thermal analysis, the as-synthesized nanoparticles were heat-treated at 250 °C for crystallization under an Ar flow. As depicted in the middle panel of Fig. 1c, after heat treatment of the dark grey nanoparticles, the sample exhibited crystalline characteristics with XRD peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase of Sb2S3 (space group: Pbnm(62), JCPDS no. 42-1393). The spherical morphology collapsed after the heat treatment (refer to Fig. S2†). Raman spectroscopy was also used to investigate the structural features (Fig. 1d). The Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized nanoparticles had very broad bands centred at 139 cm−1 and 298 cm−1, indicating poor crystallinity.19 In contrast, the spectrum of the heat-treated nanoparticles exhibited several sharp peaks and the spectrum matched with that of crystalline Sb2S3.19–22 For example, the bands at 281 cm−1 and 309 cm−1 were assigned to the symmetric vibrations of SbS3 pyramidal units with C3v symmetry and the bands at 192 cm−1 and 239 cm−1 indicated the crystalline nature. From the elemental analysis of the as-synthesized nanoparticles, the S to Sb ratio was estimated to be ∼1.6 (refer to Table S1†). Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to examine the chemical bonding states. As displayed in Fig. S3,† the Sb 3d and S 2p spectra exhibited peaks of the typical chemical states of antimony sulphides: the Sb spectrum had two major peaks at ∼538.5 eV (3d3/2) and ∼529.2 eV (3d5/2) and the two deconvoluted peaks in the S spectrum were located at ∼162.6 eV (2p1/2) and ∼161.4 eV (2p3/2). These results indicate that the spherical nano-aggregates synthesized at room temperature were a-Sb2S3.
The electrochemical properties of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode were then evaluated for NIB anode application. Sodiation/desodiation of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode was first evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S4,† the CV curves were differentiated into four regions, i.e., ‘C1’ to ‘C4’ and ‘A1’ to ‘A4’, for the cathodic and anodic scans, respectively, on the basis of the electrochemical reaction type. In the first cathodic scan (Fig. S4a†), a broad current signal (C1′) and four noticeable peaks (C2′, C3′, C3′′, and C4) were observed. The C1′ region seemed to correspond to the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and Na-insertion (a-SbSy + xNa → a-NaxSbSy).12,13 The C2′, C3′, and C3′′ peaks corresponded to the conversion (a-NaxSbSy + 2-xNa → yNa2/yS + Sb) and subsequent alloying (Sb + xNa → a-NaxSb; a-NaxSb + 3-xNa → Na3Sb) reactions.12,13,15 The C4 peak is thought to be due to sodiation in the interfaces, such as the grain boundaries of the NaxSb and/or NaxS phases (‘interface storage’). This process allows excess Na-ion storage and appears to be reversible during subsequent cycling, wherein the A4 peaks were symmetrical to the C4 peak in the consecutive anodic scan at each cycle (refer to Fig. S4a and b†).23,24 On the other hand, the first anodic scan gave rise to A3′′, A3′, A2, and A1 peaks, in addition to the A4 peak. The A3′′ and A3′ peaks and the A2 peak were attributed to the dealloying (Na3Sb → a-NaxSb + 3-xNa; a-NaxSb → a-Sb + xNa) and reconversion (yNa2/yS + a-Sb → a-NaxSbSy + 2-xNa) processes, respectively.12,13,15 The weak and broad A1 region likely corresponded to the Na extraction process (a-NaxSbSy → a-SbSy + xNa).13
The cathodic curve of the second and subsequent cycles differed from those of the first cycle. A new small peak (C1′′) and a strong peak (C2′′) corresponding to the insertion and conversion reactions emerged at ∼1.20 V and ∼0.83 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively. For the alloying process, the intensity of the C3′ and C3′′ peaks (at ∼0.20 and ∼0.30 V vs. Na+/Na) gradually decreased and the newly emerging high-voltage C3′′′ peak (at 0.45–0.53 V vs. Na+/Na) became stronger with an increase in the cycle number (refer to Fig. S4b†); the C3′ and C3′′ peaks transformed into C3′′′ and C3′′ peaks that correspond to the alloying stage. This behavior is similar to that documented in previous reports on Sb-based anodes.12,13,15 Notably, the conversion (C2) and reconversion (A2) peaks gradually declined in intensity with increasing cycle number, indicating an irreversible reaction. The aforementioned reactions observed in the CV curves are summarized in Table S2.†

Fig. 2a presents the first five-cycle galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode measured at a current rate of 50 mA g−1 within a voltage window of 0.01–2.5 V vs. Na+/Na. The first discharge curve showed three notable plateaus, corresponding to the insertion and SEI formation, conversion, and alloying processes, which is in line with the CV data. Interestingly, the first plateau had a bump at the initial stage (marked by ‘A’), which implies that the reaction processes required activation energy (energy barrier) to proceed, causing the voltage decrease (overpotential) at the initial stage; however, this step proceeded at relatively high voltage, compared to that in a crystalline anode (see below). This reaction step was responsible for the largely irreversible nature of the first cycle; the discharge capacity and initial coulombic efficiency were 995 mA h g−1 and 65%, respectively. Two voltage plateaus were observed in the charge voltage profiles derived from the dealloying and reconversion processes. As observed in the CV curves, the conversion and reconversion plateaus were shortened with increasing cycle number. The reversible sodiation/desodiation reaction (possibly taking place at the interfaces), which occurred near 0 V vs. Na+/Na as observed in the CV curve (C4 and A4 peaks in Fig. S4†), also occurred in the sloping regions (marked by ‘B’) and contributed to a small amount of extra Na storage in the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode.
 Fig. 2  Galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles measured at a current rate of 50 mA g−1 over the first 5 cycles (a), cycle performance (b) and rate capability (c) of the amorphous Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode. Cycling stability of a commercial Sb2S3 anode is also plotted in (b). The inset in (c) shows the charge–discharge voltage profiles at different current rates (50–3000 mA g−1). 
The cycling stability of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode over 100 cycles is shown in Fig. 2b. During the first eight cycles, the charge capacity of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode decreased monotonically to 586 mA h g−1, but remained almost unchanged with high coulombic efficiencies of 97–99% over the subsequent cycles: the charge capacity was 512 mA g−1 at the 100th cycle (refer to Fig. S5†). In addition, the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode displayed good rate capability under current rates of 50–3000 mA g−1, as depicted in Fig. 2c. The a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode delivered a charge capacity of 648 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 534 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1; the charge capacity was restored to 618 mA h g−1 after the subsequent 20 cycles at 50 mA g−1. For comparison, a commercially available, crystalline (c-) Sb2S3 micrometre-scale powder electrode was tested under the same conditions (Fig. S6a and b†). As shown in Fig. S6c,† the profile of the charge–discharge voltage curves was highly similar to those of the a-Sb2S3 sample, except for the first plateau in the initial discharge curve (with and without a bump). However, the c-Sb2S3 electrode exhibited poor electrochemical properties in the cycling and rate tests (Fig. S6c and d†). Although the initial coulombic efficiency of the c-Sb2S3 electrode (∼64.7%) was similar to that of the a-Sb2S3 electrode, the charge capacity deteriorated sharply after around 20 cycles and reached 290 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles (Fig. 2b). In comparison to the c-Sb2S3 electrode, the superior cycling and rate performance of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode were considered to be due to the spherical-shaped nanoscale particles and the amorphous structure. It has been reported that amorphous anode materials with intrinsic isotropic natures can mitigate the volume expansion more effectively during charge/discharge processes, compared to their crystalline counterparts.17,18,25,26 In this regard, the isotropic characteristics in the structural and morphological aspects, as well as the nanosize of the a-Sb2S3, would be beneficial for accommodating the large volume change and preserving the electrical contact during sodiation/desodiation, particularly in the initial sodiation process and would facilitate the charge transfer due to the shortened Na ion diffusion pathways, consequently enhancing the cell performance. Nevertheless, the use of only a-Sb2S3 nanoparticles as the anode was insufficient to deliver capacity reversibly during repeated charge/discharge processes, since non-conducting NaxS phases would make the desodiation process irreversible. This is most likely to be the main reason for the observed capacity decay of the a-Sb2S3 electrode during cycling. This issue can be resolved by adding more effective conducting agents such as milled graphite or reduced graphene oxide, or by constructing composites with these species.12,13
For Na ion-based full-cell application, the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode was used as the anode for seawater flow batteries. These batteries have recently been reported by our group as an eco-friendly, hybrid-type Na-air battery utilizing naturally abundant seawater as the catholyte in a flow-type, open-structure,27–29 as illustrated in Fig. 3. This battery contains a Na-selective ceramic electrolyte (herein, Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12; NZSP) that separates the anolyte (non-aq. electrolyte) and the catholyte (seawater) and allows only Na-ion-transport between the two. During the charge and discharge processes, reactions leading to the evolution/reduction of gaseous O2 and/or Cl2 phases occur at the cathode side, whereas redox reactions of the Na ions occur at the anode side. By employing an appropriate Na ion storage electrode as the anode, this battery indeed exploits natural seawater to store electrical energy without the use of Na metal. The charge/discharge process of the seawater flow cell using the a-Sb2S3 anode can be expressed as follows: (1)
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of the cell structure of seawater flow battery. 
The charge and discharge processes would ordinarily be accompanied by large overpotentials for the cathode reaction due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) in seawater (pH ∼ 8), inducing large voltage gaps between the charge and discharge curves (poor voltage efficiency).27–30 We therefore applied a representative ORR electrocatalyst, i.e., Pt/C particles, in the air-cathode and tested the cathode half-cell (Na|seawater) at a current rate of 0.5 mA cmNZSP,exposed area−2 (refer to Experimental details in ESI†). The cell containing the Pt/C catalyst showed reduced voltage gaps (∼0.56 V) during the charging and discharging processes as compared to the cell without Pt/C (∼1.01 V; Fig. S7†).
Prior to the full-cell test, the charge–discharge voltage profiles of the full-cell (a-Sb2S3|seawater) were simulated based on the normalized profiles of the anode half-cell (Na|a-Sb2S3) and cathode half-cell (Na|seawater) with the Pt/C catalyst. For the anode half-cell, the voltage profiles for the 1st and subsequent cycles differed in terms of the shape (Fig. 2a); thus, the 1st and 8th voltage profiles of the anode were used to simulate the charge–discharge voltage profiles of the full-cell (bold curves), as displayed in Fig. 4a.
 Fig. 4  Normalized galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage profiles of the anode half-cell (Na|a-Sb2S3) measured at 50 mA g−1 for 1st and 8th cycles, the cathode half-cell containing Pt/C catalyst (Na|seawater) measured at 0.05 mA cm−2, and the simulated full-cells (bold curves) (a); charge–discharge curves of the full-cell under capacity-limited conditions (550 mA h g−1anode) at 0.05 mA cm−2 over 70 cycles (b); cycling performance of the full-cell (c); and, XRD pattern of the anode of the full-cell disassembled after 15th charge process (d). 
The full-cells were examined by galvanostatic cycling with a capacity cut-off (550 mA h ganode−1) on charging and a voltage cut-off (0.4 V) on discharging at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2 (∼83 mA g−1anode). Capacity-limited control on charging was applied to prevent Na plating on the anode surface due to overcharging. As depicted in Fig. 4b, the measured charge–discharge curves for the first and subsequent cycles followed similar paths to the simulated curves (the bold curves in Fig. 4a). The initial discharge capacity was 233 mA h g−1, resulting in a coulombic efficiency of ∼42.3%. The low initial coulombic efficiency could be attributed mainly to formation of an SEI layer on the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode.12,13 The relatively low initial coulombic efficiency, as compared to that of the anode half-cell (Na|a-Sb2S3, ∼65%), could result from capacity-limited charging (550 mA h g−1anode), which did not allow the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode to reach its fully-charged state (state-of-charge 100%). We also speculate that as a result of introduction of the NZSP solid electrolyte, solid–liquid electrolyte interphase (SLEI) layers would form on the NZSP surface by reactions with the non-aq. and/or seawater electrolytes,31 contributing partly to the loss of Na ions provided by the charge process (reduced coulombic efficiency). Systematic investigations are required to improve the cell performance.
With increasing cycle number, discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency gradually increased and became stable around the 50th cycle, as plotted in Fig. 4c; the discharge capacity was 470–485 mA h g−1 with an average discharge voltage of ∼1.9 V and coulombic efficiencies of 83–88% during the 50th to 70th cycles. In order to evaluate sodiation of the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode by natural seawater, another full-cell was cycled under the same conditions, disassembled after the 15th charge process, and the charged anode was intentionally exposed to ambient air. Owing to the intentional exposure, peaks corresponding to the crystalline NaSb(OH)6 phase were readily found in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4d),12 which indicated that the a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle anode stored the Na-ions from natural seawater during the charge process. The stability of the NZSP solid electrolyte of the full-cell before and after cycling was also investigated. In comparison with the pattern of the pristine sample, no notable change was found in the XRD patterns for both the seawater and non-aq. electrolyte sides (Fig. S8†).
Conclusions
In summary, a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle aggregates were fabricated via a polyol-mediated room-temperature synthetic protocol and the Na ion storage performance was investigated. The a-Sb2S3 nanoparticle electrode displayed good cycling and rate performance as a NIB anode as compared to the commercial, crystalline Sb2S3 electrode. This result was mostly likely due to the spherical-shaped nanoparticles and their amorphous structure, which possessed isotropic characteristics in the structural and morphological aspects, enabling the electrode to endure the huge volume changes throughout the repeated charge/discharge processes. In addition, the a-Sb2S3 electrode was evaluated as the anode for Na metal-free seawater flow batteries. The full-cell (a-Sb2S3|seawater) delivered a relatively low discharge capacity in the initial cycles, but exhibited an increased capacity of 470–485 mA h g−1 with an average discharge voltage of ∼1.9 V and coulombic efficiencies of 83–88% during the 50th to 70th cycles. These findings demonstrate that a-Sb2S3 nanoparticles synthesized at room temperature could be promising candidates for NIB anodes, although the electrical properties should be augmented by modifying the structural configuration to include conducting agents in order to further enhance the battery performance.
