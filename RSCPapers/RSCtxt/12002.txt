The block copolymer films showed phase-separated structures with domain sizes of 10–100 nm. Irradiation with UV light afforded crosslinked films through [2+2] cyclodimerization of cinnamate groups. Then, PEO was removed by acidic cleavage of the acetal bond, yielding PT template networks. Taking advantage of the insoluble networks, a fullerene derivative was deposited into the PT templates through a spin-coating process to form donor/acceptor heterostructures. The introduction of the fullerene derivative was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. This strategy of depositing acceptor molecules into donor template networks, instead of spin-coating from donor/acceptor blend solutions, could be applied to improve the phase-separated structures and power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers have been extensively studied due to their potential as organic semiconductors, which are lightweight and flexible.1 The performance of organic devices strongly depends on the assembled structures at nanometer scales as well as molecular structures. Especially in polymer solar cells (PSCs), phase separation of electron donors and acceptors in active layers significantly affects power conversion efficiencies.2 The most common process to prepare active layers of PSCs is spin-coating from blend solutions, which gives bulk heterojunction structures. The domain size should be as small as the exciton diffusion length, typically about 10 nm in organic semiconductors, maintaining the continuity to the electrodes. A representative active layer of PSCs is a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).3–6 By controlling the annealing conditions, the morphology can be modified so as to enhance the power conversion efficiency. However, phase separation of blend systems is difficult to control as the ideal structures are not thermodynamically stable. Interdigitating structures of donor and acceptor domains, which are aligned normal to substrates, have been proposed to universally enhance the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices.7–9 Nanoimprinting method has been proved to be a powerful approach to realize the interdigitating structures.10–12 Nano-patterned templates such as anodic aluminum oxide are utilized to fabricate nanorods of semiconductor molecules vertically aligned on the substrates. Then, the second components are deposited to form interdigitating structures of donors and acceptors. Although this top-down approach succeeded in enhancing the efficiency of PSCs, it suffers from the limited aspect ratio of patterned structures.
In polymer systems, nanostructures can be precisely controlled through self-assembly of block copolymers. Various nanostructures such as spheres, cylinders, double gyroids and lamellae have been observed by controlling the composition of coil–coil block copolymers.13,14 Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is one of the mostly studied components of diblock copolymers showing nanophase separation.15 As the nanophase separation of block copolymers originates from the segregation of each component, hydrophilic PEO is often used as the counterpart of hydrophobic polymers. Polystyrene-b-PEO (PS-b-PEO) is a typical block copolymer system showing well-defined nanophase separation.16–18 Furthermore, a block copolymer composed of PEO and polymethacrylates functionalized with liquid-crystalline azobenzene shows vertically aligned cylinders with a periodicity of 7–15 nm.19–21 If such structures could be obtained using conjugated polymers, they would be ideal for the active layers of PSCs.
Various block copolymers containing conjugated polymers have been synthesized such as P3HT-b-PEO.22–28 Balsara et al. applied P3HT-b-PEO to an electrode of a lithium ion battery, combining the electronic conduction of P3HT and ion conduction in the PEO matrix.22,23 P3HT-b-PEO has also been applied to photovoltaic cells as a component of active layers.24,25 One of the problems in the application of PEO-containing block copolymers to photovoltaic devices is the insulating nature of PEO. The etching of one component of a block copolymer gives nanoporous films, which could be used as templates for nanostructures of blend systems.29,30 Darling et al. obtained P3HT templates from P3HT-b-polylactide films by etching polylactide, and deposited acceptor molecules by immersing the films in an aqueous solution of hydroxy fullerene.31 Recently, Grancharov et al. developed P3HT-b-PEO with a cleavable acetal bond at the linkage to prepare nanoporous films of P3HT.32 To allow the introduction of various semiconductor molecules into nanotemplates by solution processes, the films should be resistant to organic solvents. Conjugated polymers can be crosslinked by functionalizing the polymers with crosslinkable groups such as halogens, azides and olefins.33–38 It has been shown that post-introduction of acceptor molecules into crosslinked donor networks can enhance the power conversion efficiency even without using block copolymers.33,34 Furthermore, crosslinking has been revealed to stabilize nanostructures, preventing the decrease in the power conversion efficiency with time.35–38 Using nanoporous networks prepared from self-assembled block copolymers, the phase separated structures of donors and acceptors could be adequately controlled.
In this study, we synthesized a block copolymer (7 in Fig. 1) composed of PEO and polythiophene (PT), which contains photocrosslinkable cinnamate moieties39 in the PT block and a cleavable acetal bond at the linkage.30,32 Cinnamate groups undergo [2+2] cyclodimerization upon irradiation with UV light to give crosslinked structures.39 We investigated the morphology of the block copolymer films, crosslinking of PT domains, etching of the PEO component, and deposition of a fullerene derivative as an acceptor to fabricate donor/acceptor heterostructures (Fig. 2).

Experimental
Materials and characterization
The synthetic route for the block copolymer is shown in Fig. 1. 1 and 4 were synthesized according to the literature.30,402 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-ECX500 spectrometer. The 1H NMR spectra of polymers are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S3). The number- and weight-averaged molecular weights, Mn and Mw, were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using Shodex KF-803L and KF-806L columns with THF as eluent, which were calibrated with PS standards (Shodex, SM-105). UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured using a spectrometer (JASCO, V-630). The morphology of films was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM; Agilent, 5500) in a dynamic mode. A sample for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was prepared on a glass substrate coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which was delaminated in water. The floating thin film was put on a copper grid and stained with OsO4 vapor for 30 min. TEM was performed on an HT7700 (Hitachi) at 100 kV. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC-60 (Shimadzu).

Synthesis of 3 by random copolymerization of 1 and 240,41. 

1 (615 mg, 1.35 mmol) and 2 (1.03 g, 3.16 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (8.2 mL) under nitrogen. A 1.1 M THF solution of tert-butylmagnesium chloride (tBuMgCl, 4.0 mL, 4.4 mmol) was slowly added and stirred for 18 h at room temperature. After diluting the solution by adding anhydrous THF (7.5 mL), [1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride (Ni(dppp)Cl2, 24 mg, 0.045 mmol) dispersed in anhydrous THF (18 mL) was added under nitrogen, and stirred for 3 h at room temperature. Then, a 0.5 M THF solution of ethynylmagnesium bromide (1.2 mL, 0.60 mmol) was added and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The solution was dropped in methanol, and the purple precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration. The solid was washed with hexane and dried under reduced pressure. Yield: 680 mg.


Synthesis of 5 by click reaction. 

3 (150 mg, 0.0116 mmol), 4 (276 mg, 0.0218 mmol, Mn(NMR) = 1.27 × 104), CuBr(I) (32 mg, 0.22 mmol) and N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA, 55 μL, 0.22 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (8 mL). The solution was degassed by freeze–pump–thaw cycles and refluxed under nitrogen for 21 h. After the solution was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure, water was added to afford a precipitate. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration, followed by washing with water and methanol, and drying under reduced pressure. Yield: 218 mg.


Synthesis of 6 by deprotection. 

5 (154 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous THF under nitrogen. A 1.0 M THF solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF, 0.5 mL, 0.5 mmol) was added and stirred for 1 h. The solution was dropped in hexane, and the precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, followed by drying under reduced pressure. Yield: 148 mg.


Synthesis of 7 by esterification. 

6 (130 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (20 mL) under nitrogen and triethylamine (1.0 mL, 7.2 mmol) was added. A solution of cinnamoyl chloride (561 mg, 3.37 mmol) in anhydrous THF (9.5 mL) was added dropwise to the former solution under nitrogen and stirred for 17 h at room temperature. After the solution was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure, the solution was dropped in methanol/triethylamine (50:1). The precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration and dried under reduced pressure. Yield: 122 mg.

Preparation of thin films
Thin films of 7 were prepared by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solution on glass or quartz substrates. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 h under reduced pressure. Photocrosslinking was performed at room temperature under argon atmosphere with UV light (313 nm, 20 mW cm−2) from a high-pressure mercury lamp through a glass filter (Tokina, U340) for 30 min. For the removal of PEO, the crosslinked films were immersed in TFA for 1 h, and then in methanol for 1 h. PCBM was deposited by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solution on the films (1.0 wt%, 1400 rpm).
Results and discussion

Fig. 3 shows the GPC curves of polymers. PT block 3, which was obtained through random copolymerization of 1 and 2, showed a narrow molecular weight distribution with Mw/Mn = 1.16, implying that the existence of tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (TBDMS) groups does not disturb the living nature of catalyst-transfer polycondensation.42,43 As, evaluated from the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†), the composition of 3 was consistent with the feed ratio of monomers (m/n = 3/7). The end-group of 3 was difficult to analyze due to a low S/N ratio. Therefore, the 1H NMR spectrum of a lower molecular weight sample was used to evaluate the end group obtained by the present synthetic procedure, which was consistent with the predicted structure (Fig. S4, ESI†). The modification of PEO with acetal bonds and azide groups was confirmed by the 1H NMR measurement (Fig. S1, ESI†).30 After the click reaction of 3 and 4, the GPC curve showed a shift to high molecular weight, which suggests the generation of a block copolymer (5). It should be noted that the existence of a homopolymer cannot be completely excluded as the GPC curves of 3 and 5 are partially overlapped, which could disturb the phase-separated structures. The translation of 5 to 7 did not significantly change the GPC curve. The quantitative introduction of cinnamate ester was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the DSC curve of 7. The melting of PEO and PT crystals was observed at 49 and 143 °C, respectively. 7 showed a lower melting point of PT than typical P3HT, which could be due to the introduction of bulky cinnamate moieties in side chains.
We investigated the photocrosslinking behavior of the thin films of 7. Fig. 4 shows the absorption spectra of the block copolymer films. Before UV irradiation, the films showed a peak at 274 nm, which is attributed to cinnamate moieties. The spectra in the visible region were similar to those of typical P3HT films, showing a shoulder at around 600 nm, which is assigned to crystalline PT. When irradiated with UV light under argon, the absorption at 274 nm decreased. This change is caused by [2+2] cycloaddition of cinnamate moieties. When immersed in THF, the films after UV irradiation were not dissolved, in contrast with the films before irradiation (Fig. 5). These results indicate the formation of a crosslinked network through photodimerization of cinnamate moieties.

Fig. 6a shows the AFM phase image of the films after annealing for 10 h at 100 °C and UV irradiation for 30 min at room temperature. We assigned the bright and dark regions to the PT and PEO components, respectively. PT domains with widths of 10–100 nm were separated by PEO, in contrast with a blend film of PT and PEO showing domains larger than 1 μm (Fig. S6, ESI†). A similar structure was also observed by TEM (Fig. S7, ESI†). The films did not show well-defined structures such as lamellae and cylinders as seen in coil–coil diblock copolymers. The complex morphology may be caused by the coexistence of the effects of nanophase separation of block copolymers and the crystallization of PT. The AFM height image of the films (Fig. S8a, ESI†) was similar to the phase image. As PT and PEO have different elastic moduli, the AFM height image may be disturbed by deformation of a sample, which arises from the force between the probe tip and the sample.44

We next tried the formation of heterostructures composed of PT and PCBM aiming at the application to PSCs. The crosslinked films were immersed in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for the cleavage of acetal bonds and in methanol for the removal of PEO blocks. Then, PCBM was deposited into the crosslinked PT films by the spin-coating method. Fig. 6b shows the AFM phase image after immersion in TFA. The area of the bright region increased, indicating the removal of PEO and exposure of PT on the surface. Some of the dark regions remained, which implies incomplete removal of PEO. As the morphology is disordered, some of the acetal bonds may be embedded in PT-rich regions, where TFA cannot reach. After the deposition of PCBM, the films showed a featureless morphology (Fig. 6c), which could be due to the coverage of the surface with PCBM. The photocrosslinking of PT domains allowed post-introduction of PCBM through solution processes. Fig. 7a shows the absorption spectra of the films after cleavage of PEO and deposition of PCBM. Immersing in TFA did not significantly affect the absorption property of PT. After the deposition of PCBM, an absorption peak of PCBM at 334 nm was observed. At the same time, the absorption band of PT showed a blue shift, which may be caused by the removal of uncrosslinked polymer chains and penetration of PCBM molecules into PT domains, which disturbs the crystallization of PT. A similar behavior was also reported for deposition of PCBM into the crosslinked P3HT homopolymer.34 The absorption spectrum did not change even after thermal annealing at 140 °C for 2 h. The removal of PCBM by washing with THF recovered the crystal structure of P3HT (Fig. S9, ESI†), confirming the penetration of PCBM into PT domains. The relatively high miscibility of PT and PCBM in the present system may be due to unreacted cinnamate moieties. With prolonged time of UV irradiation in the photocrosslinking process, the blue shift of the absorption band of PT was suppressed (Fig. S10, ESI†). Fig. 7b shows the fluorescence spectra of the films before and after the introduction of PCBM. The fluorescence of PT was largely quenched after the introduction of PCBM, suggesting that PCBM molecules exist near PT within the exciton diffusion length of PT. Thus, acceptor molecules can be successfully introduced into the PT template with organic solvent thanks to the insolubility of crosslinked networks.

Conclusion
We synthesized a diblock copolymer composed of PEO and crosslinkable PT to control the nanostructures of organic semiconductors. The block copolymer showed a disordered nanostructure with domain sizes of 10–100 nm. After photocrosslinking of PT domains, PEO was removed by successive immersion in TFA and methanol. Then, PCBM was deposited by the spin-coating process to yield donor/acceptor heterostructures. Thus, the crosslinked PT films obtained by photocrosslinking and removal of PEO can be used as templates for heterostructures of organic semiconductors. The solvent resistance of the crosslinked PT will allow the introduction of various acceptor molecules. Unfortunately, the block copolymer did not show a well-defined nanostructure, which is probably caused by the strong crystalline nature of PT components. Ideal structures could be obtained by decreasing the crystallinity of conjugated polymers. With modified nanostructures, crosslinked templates could enhance the energy conversion efficiency of PSCs.
