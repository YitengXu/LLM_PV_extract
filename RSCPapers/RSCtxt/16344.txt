    , Accepted 6th November 2012First published on 12th November 2012AbstractVertically aligned TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) modified with Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) have been successfully prepared via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra and surface photovoltage (SPV) measurements reveal that the Ag2S sensitization extends the range of the photoresponse of the TiO2 NRAs to the visible region and exhibits higher photovoltage responses. With a polysulfide electrolyte, a maximum conversion efficiency of 0.148% with a superior Jsc of 1.177 mA cm−2 are obtained after 6 SILAR cycles under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. These results indicate that the Ag2S QDs/TiO2 NRAs photoelectrode has a promising application in solar cells.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2), as an important wide bandgap semiconductor, has been intensively studied owing to its promising applications in solar energy conversion and photocatalysis.1–4 Among the TiO2 nanostructured materials, well aligned one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanotube and nanorod/wire arrays, are expected to have high photoelectrochemical performances due to their well-defined 1D channel for electrical carrier transport.5–7 In addition, the nanoarrays have a lower optical reflectance owing to light scattering and trapping, leading to a high light absorption efficiency.8 At present, TiO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) have attracted more and more attention because of their single-crystalline structure and facile synthesization as well as their utilization in a variety of applications, such as photocatalysis, gas sensing and solar cells.9–12
However, it is well-known that TiO2 has a large band gap of 3.2 eV (anatase) which absorbs solar light in the UV region only, comprising about 4%–5% of the solar spectrum. Therefore much effort has been devoted to improving the photoresponse of TiO2 in the visible region. One promising strategy is to combine TiO2 with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,13,14 CdSe,15,16 PbS,17 PbSe18 and CdTe,19 which have been tested in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Compared with other sensitizers, semiconductor quantum dots have two unique advantages. First, the band gap of the QDs can be tailored by changing the size of the QDs, allowing one to tune the visible response of the QDs. Second, the QDs can generate multiple electron–hole pairs per photon through the impact ionization effect.20
As an important chalcogenide compound, Ag2S has been investigated for numerous applications in photoconductors and photovoltaic cells21,22 due to its bulk band gap of ∼1.0 eV and relatively high absorption coefficients.23 In addition, α-Ag2S possesses negligible toxicity compared to other commonly used narrow band gap materials,24 making it a promising photosensitizer for QDSCs. In this work, we report an investigation of TiO2 nanorod arrays modified with Ag2S QDs and their performance in QDSCs. A comparison of the properties between pure TiO2 NRAs and Ag2S QD-sensitized TiO2 NRAs is also investigated. The composite electrode results in a significant energy conversation efficiency of 0.148% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 1.177 mA cm−2 under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 by employing a polysulfide electrolyte, indicating that TiO2–Ag2S NRAs can be promising photovoltaic devices.
Experimental details
TiO2 nanorod array synthesis
Vertically aligned TiO2 NRAs were grown on transparent FTO substrates (20 Ω per square) using a hydrothermal synthesis reported previously.6 In a typical experiment, 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5%–38% by weight) followed by stirring at ambient conditions for 5 min. Then, 0.75 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (≥98.0% by weight) was added to the mixture. After stirring for another 5 min, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume) after one piece of the cleaned FTO substrate was put in against the wall with the conductive side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 20 h in a regular laboratory oven. After synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature under flowing water. The FTO substrate was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air.
Ag2S QD deposition on TiO2 nanorod arrays
Ag2S QDs were deposited on TiO2 nanorods via a SILAR method with slight modification, as previously reported.25 Ethanol and methanol were used instead of water as solvents because of their lower surface tension, resulting in a superior penetration ability on the TiO2 film. Briefly, the TiO2 nanorod array substrate was first dipped into a 0.1 M AgNO3 ethanol solution for 1 min, rinsed with ethanol, dipped into a 0.1 M Na2S methanol solution for 3 min and then rinsed with methanol. The two-step procedure forms one SILAR cycle and the incorporated amount of Ag2S would be increased by repeating the cycle. This immersion cycle was repeated several times, typically between 2 and 8 cycles. Finally, the as-prepared Ag2S QDs/TiO2 NRAs films were dried in a N2 stream.
Cell fabrication
The Pt counter-electrode was prepared by placing a drop of a 5 mM H2PtCl6 isopropyl alcohol solution onto a FTO glass substrate, followed by heating at 385 °C for 30 min. The working electrode and the counter-electrode were cohered together by epoxy resin. The polysulfide electrolyte was comprised of 0.5 M Na2S, 2 M S, 0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M NaOH in methanol–water (7:3 by volume).
Characterizations
An XL 30 ESEM FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; FEI Company) fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used to characterize the morphologies and elemental analysis of the samples. High-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation was carried out on a TECNAIG2 transmission electron microscope (FEI company) working at 200 kV. The crystal structure of the as-prepared films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max-2550 X-ray diffractometer with Cu–Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å; 50 kV, 200 mA) in the range of 20–80° (2θ) at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The optical absorption spectra of the samples were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600) to detect absorption over the range of 300–800 nm.
The lock-in-based surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system was constituted of a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (SR540), a photovoltaic cell and a computer.26 Monochromatic light was provided by passing light from a 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global Xenon Lamp Power) through a grating monochromator (Omni-5007, No. 09010, Zolix). A low chopping frequency of ∼23 Hz was used. In the photovoltaic cell, the FTO with the TiO2 nanorod arrays acted as a top electrode. A glass substrate covered with ITO was used for the bottom electrode and a spacer of mica was inserted between the two electrodes.
The photocurrent intensity versus measured potential (I–V curve) measurements were performed by an electrochemistry workgroup (CHI 630b, made in China). Sunlight was simulated with a 500 W xenon lamp. The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2, which was measured with a radiometer (Photo-electronic Instrument Co., attached to Beijing Normal University, China). The effective area of the cell is 0.2 cm2.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the Ag2S QD-sensitized TiO2 nanorod arrays

Fig. 1a and c show typical FESEM images of the as-grown TiO2 NRAs on an FTO substrate by a simple hydrothermal method. As shown in Fig. 1a, the prepared TiO2 nanorods have lengths of 5–6 μm and diameters between 50 and 250 nm, respectively. The cross-section images reveal that the nanorods are nearly perpendicular to the FTO substrate and most of them are densely packed into bundles. Fig. 1c represents a higher magnification of the arrays, showing that the surfaces of the nanorods are relatively smooth. After deposition with Ag2S QDs for 6 cycles, the ordered TiO2 nanorod array structure was retained, as shown in Fig. 1b and d. From Fig. 1d, we can see that the side of the TiO2 nanorods becomes rough and possesses uniform particles compared to the pure TiO2 nanorods, indicating that Ag2S QDs have been successfully deposited on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanorods along their major length.

Fig. 2a is a typical TEM image of a TiO2 nanorod array deposited with Ag2S for 6 SILAR cycles, showing that a large amount of Ag2S nanocrystallites have been deposited on the TiO2 nanorods. The diameter of the Ag2S nanocrystallites ranges from 5 nm to 25 nm. Fig. 2b is the HRTEM image of the sample. The observed lattice spacing of 0.316 nm is in agreement with the values for the (110) lattice planes of tetragonal rutile TiO2. The HRTEM image also indicates that the Ag2S QDs deposited on the TiO2 nanorods have a crystalline structure. The observed 0.242 nm lattice spacing can be assigned to the (121) planes of the α-Ag2S phase (JCPDS card no. 14-0072).

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the TiO2 NRAs before (curve a) and after (curve b) modification with Ag2S. The (110), (101), (002) and (112) peaks seen in the diffraction pattern correspond to the tetragonal rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card no. 21-1276). The enhanced (002) peak indicates that the nanorods are single crystalline throughout their length and grow in the [001] direction, with the growth axis perpendicular to the FTO substrate. The inset in the top-left corner is a magnification of curve a and b in the range of 35°–40° (2θ). We can see that additional peak appears at 36.8° after Ag2S deposition, which is attributed to the α-Ag2S phase (JCPDS card no. 14-0072). Energy dispersive X-ray analysis was also taken and is shown in Fig. 3b. The observed peaks for Ag and S further confirm that the QD clusters are composed of Ag2S. Other elements apart from Ti and O, such as Au and Sn, are also detected in the EDX spectrum. Elemental Au originated from the sputtering gold to enhance the image contrast and elemental Sn comes from the substrate composed of fluorine-doped tin oxide.

Optical and photoelectrochemical properties of the Ag2S QD-sensitized TiO2 nanorod arrays
The amount of Ag2S QDs attached to the TiO2 NRAs can be qualitatively estimated through the UV-vis absorption measurement. Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of bare TiO2 nanorod film and Ag2S QD-modified TiO2 nanorod films with various SILAR cycles, respectively. The bare TiO2 NRAs electrode exhibits a fundamental absorption edge at around 410 nm, which corresponds to its bandgap energy of 3.0 eV in the ultraviolet region. In comparison, for the A2S QDs/TiO2 NRAs electrodes, the light absorbance extends to the visible light region and the absorbance of the spectra increases with an increase in the SILAR cycles, indicating an increased adsorption amount of Ag2S. In the meantime, the absorption edge undergoes an obvious red shift with increasing SILAR cycles, which is due to the quantum size effect, as described previously.27
 Fig. 4  UV-vis absorption spectra of the TiO2 NRAs modified with various Ag2S QDs. The labels next to the curves denote the number of SILAR cycles. 
However, the UV-vis absorption spectra cannot really reflect the information of the photoelectric process in the absorption band. Surface photovoltage technique is an effective way to study the process of photo-induced charge separation and transfer in the surface and interface.28–30 Here, we utilize the lock-in-based AC SPV measuring technique to explore the photovoltaic properties of the samples and the results are shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5a, the black line represents the surface photovoltage of single TiO2 NRAs and the colored lines represent the Ag2S QD-sensitized TiO2 NRAs with different SILAR cycles. For the pure TiO2 NRAs, the SPV response peak at approximately 360 nm is attributed to the electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO2 under ultraviolet light illumination. After Ag2S deposition, the SPV responses of the composite films are extended to 800 nm with a wide range. In Fig. 5b, the corresponding phase spectra show the statistic kinetic characteristics for each AC SPV spectrum with a distinguishable response. The phase values are within the range of 110°–140° for all the curves, which corresponds to negative SPV signals,31 meaning that the photo-induced electrons generally transfer to the top electrode. In the spectral region of 410–800 nm, TiO2 cannot generate a SPV response and only Ag2S can be excited. The observed SPV signals in the visible region imply that the photo-induced electrons are quickly injected into the TiO2 nanorods and transported to the FTO substrate, leaving holes in the valence band of Ag2S. In this way, the photo-induced electron–hole pairs could be more effectively separated. In addition, we can see that the SPV response is weakened when the coating cycles are increased to 8 cycles. This phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that more deposition cycles would cause conglomeration and prevent the photo-induced electrons from Ag2S fast injecting into the TiO2 nanorods, resulting in inefficient separation in the TiO2–Ag2S composite films.13

Fig. 6 shows the characteristics of the experimental photocurrent–voltage (I–V) and power–voltage (P–V) for the TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrodes with various SILAR cycles under illumination at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The dark current densities in all cases can be negligible. The photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η), are shown in Table 1. The results indicate that the Jsc gradually increases from 0.356 to 1.177 mA cm−2 for 2–6 SILAR cycles and the cell yields the maximum Jsc and a η of 0.148% at the sixth cycle. With a further increase of the Ag2S amount, the Jsc and η values begin to decrease after reaching the maximum value. This is mainly because additional deposition cycles may result in the formation of aggregates around the TiO2 nanorods. The larger aggregates are less efficient in transferring electrons although they absorb a wider region of the visible spectrum, which is consistent with our SPV characterization. In the meantime, the pores may be blocked by the additional Ag2S loading, resulting in unfavorable electron transportation at the TiO2–Ag2S–electrolyte interface.32–34

From Table 1, the best efficiency of the cells fabricated with the Ag2S-modified TiO2 NRAs is 18.5 times higher than that of the bare TiO2 NRAs, which is ascribed to the sensitization of the Ag2S QDs. Scheme 1 shows a schematic diagram of TiO2–Ag2S NRAs based solar cell, illustrating the main charge-transfer processes between TiO2 and Ag2S. Under visible light excitation, the photo-induced electrons (e−) from Ag2S can be quickly injected into TiO2, arriving at the FTO substrate through the well-aligned single-crystalline TiO2 NRAs. Meanwhile, the holes (h+) are scavenged by S2− to produce Sx2−. In such a configuration, photoexcited electron–hole pairs are separated quickly and transported in their respective phases to the opposing electrodes, resulting in the enhancement of the photoelectrochemical properties. Considering the cell performance in the present study is still inferior, further improvement can be made, such as controlling the length and density of the TiO2 NRAs, coating with a ZnS layer and a TiO2 scattering layer. All these investigations are ongoing in our laboratory.

Conclusions
In summary, Ag2S quantum dot-modified TiO2 nanorod array films have been prepared by a hydrothermal method and subsequent SILAR technique. The Ag2S-modified TiO2 NRAs exhibit a significant enhancement in Jsc and the efficiency of the cells, which is mainly attributed to the extended absorption in the visible light region resulting from the Ag2S QDs and the effective separation of photo-induced carriers at the TiO2–Ag2S nanojunction interface. Our results confirm that Ag2S QDs can be used as effective sensitizers and demonstrate the potential application of the TiO2 NRAs/Ag2S QD system in solar cells.
