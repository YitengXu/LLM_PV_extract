    , Accepted 24th August 2017First published on 24th August 2017AbstractHere we show that chlorine species originating from commonly used iron precursors annihilate the hematite nanorod photocurrent by providing recombination pathways. Although hematite nanorod films could be obtained by thermal decomposition of the iron oxyhydroxide phase (β-FeOOH), indistinguishable photocurrent responses under dark and sunlight irradiation conditions were observed until the nanorods were annealed (activated) at 750 °C. The annealing led to the elimination of observable chlorine species and allowed photocurrent responses of 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is comparable to the best results found in the literature, suggesting that residual chlorine species from the synthesis can act as electron traps and recombination sites for photogenerated holes.
Introduction
Direct solar energy conversion into chemical energy has been intensively exploited as a renewable energy resource providing clean and sustainable energy, and promising enough power to fulfill the human demand.1–5 Carbon-free technologies such as photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) based on a semiconductor under light-driven water oxidation in the presence of seawater (as feedstock) might be one of the best and cleanest methods to convert solar energy into hydrogen fuel.6–8 The most promising semiconductor for PEC application after over 35 years of investigation is still hematite (α-Fe2O3), which fulfils several of the key criteria to achieve stable and cost-effective commercial devices.9–12 Even though some progress was made on the use of hematite as a photoanode in PECs, the overall solar conversion efficiency is far from its theoretical prediction (15%).13 The main drawback behind this low photoactivity is related to the high recombination rate at the bulk and surface of hematite, which limits the efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pair separation and chemical reactions.14,15 Elucidating the water oxidation mechanisms16 and finding ways to maximize electron collection and hole diffusion are therefore the major challenges for efficient hematite PEC applications.17–20
Along with a number of efforts to overcome hematite limitations (such as insertion of dopants,21–23 and addition of over and under oxide layers),24 Vayssieres et al. proposed a scalable chemical method to design hematite films composed of vertically aligned nanorod/wire arrays in relation to the substrate.25 This one-dimensional morphology maximizes the electronic conductivity by arguably eliminating grain boundaries and although the morphology can be obtained using several methods, the simplicity of the so-called Purpose Built Material (PBM) has largely attracted scientific interest in understanding and optimizing hematite photocatalytic performance,20,26–31 in particular, for addressing the roles of defects, of which little is known so far.
In the context of processing, recent investigations have shown a significant improvement on surface wettability of hematite nanorod films processed at high annealing temperatures.27,32,33 At the same time, high temperature annealing has been associated with a better substrate–layer interface,34 or unintentional doping (by diffusion of Sn from the FTO substrate),35 which seems to increase the absorption coefficient or the donor carrier density. The nature of the temperature activated transformation remains unclear, but it has been observed regardless of the preparation method.
Herein we present systematic evidence that hard-to-detect chlorine contaminations originating from iron precursors during synthesis are responsible for the partial blocking of the surface hematite nanorods for effective water oxidation under sunlight irradiation. By using mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques, we demonstrated that an increase in processing temperatures gradually removes chlorine groups from the hematite surface, re-activating its surface and enhancing the performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of direct evidence of the presence of chlorine remaining on hematite processed using the PBM method, which signifies a major advancement for optimal processing.
Experimental
Synthesis of nanostructured iron oxide films
The iron oxide films were synthesized using an aqueous solution method maintained under hydrothermal conditions as recently described.20,25,29,36 In a typical procedure, an aqueous-solution containing 0.15 mol L−1 iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) with 1.0 mol L−1 sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was prepared with a controlled pH of 1.5 using HCl. Then, the precursor solution was transferred to an autoclavable bottle in which a commercial transparent conductor glass substrate (glass substrate covered by a fluorine-doped tin oxide layer, FTO, F:SnO2) coupled to a Teflon support was immersed. The autoclavable bottle was kept in a conventional oven at 100 °C for different time periods (from 15 min to 24 hours). Thereafter, the flask was quickly cooled in an ice bath and washed with deionized water several times. Finally, an additional thermal treatment was conducted at 390 °C for 1 h. This annealing temperature was chosen based on a previous DSC/TG thermal analysis showing that above 390 °C the thermodynamically stable crystallographic phase of ferric oxide (i.e. hematite) is obtained.36 The same film was further treated at 750 °C for 0.5 h to eliminate chlorine residues as discussed in the paper.
Characterization and analyses
Film morphology and thickness (top-view and cross-sectional analysis of cleaved films) were evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM-FEI, Inspec F-50). X-ray diffraction was performed on the as-prepared and annealed films to investigate the crystalline phases and indexed using the JCPDS card. The optical properties were evaluated by using a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer (from 200 to 1000 nm). The impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical (absence/presence of light) measurements were carried out in a conventional electrochemical cell with three-electrode configuration. Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode in KCl saturated solution, platinum foil as a counter-electrode and iron oxide films with a delimited area of 1 cm2 as a working electrode were used. Current density, J, versus voltage, VRHE (where RHE is a reversible hydrogen electrode), was measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, under dark and illuminated conditions (using a scanning potentiostat/galvanostat model μAutolab III, with FRA). Sunlight was simulated using a 450 W xenon lamp (Osram, ozone free) coupled with an AM 1.5 global filter and the light intensity was set at 100 mW cm−2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was performed in the absence of light. From the Nyquist plot (EIS data obtained in the frequency of 1 kHz with 10 mV of amplitude potential and the bias voltage from 0.8 to 1.8 V vs. RHE) an equivalent circuit was simulated to estimate the semiconductor space charge layer capacitance. For all electrochemical measurements, 1.0 M of NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich pro-analysis) in high-purity water was used as the electrolyte (pH at 13.6) and the cell was purged with nitrogen before the analysis to remove oxygen content. The thermal decomposition analysis was conducted by combining thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC Netzsch 449) analysis with the qualitative gas analysis performed by mass spectrometry (MS). The β-FeOOH sample was heated from room temperature up to 1200 °C at 10 °C min−1 under air at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The final data were collected after subtracting the baseline, i.e. a TGA/DSC/MS run with empty platinum crucibles under the same conditions.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the color change in the iron oxide films formed onto conductive transparent glass substrates (FTO) before and after annealing at 390 °C and as a function of hydrothermal processing time. The uncoated commercial FTO substrate is also shown as a reference. It can be seen that the FTO is gradually covered by a yellow layer (corresponding to a hydrated iron oxide layer) after 0.25 h under hydrothermal conditions which become homogeneous after 1 h. As previously reported, PBM involves the hydrolysis–condensation of hydrated metal ions and complex inorganic polymerization leading to the formation of a metastable ferric oxyhydroxide. The heteronucleation of this compound on the substrate is thus responsible for the observed yellow color.37 Further thermal treatment of the coated FTO substrates in air (at 390 °C for 1 h) changes the color to orange, and gradually to intense red-brown (see Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). This is related to phase decomposition during the annealing process, i.e., water is gradually eliminated and oxyhydroxide is converted into iron oxide.36 The optical measurement was performed for the synthesized films before and after thermal treatment was analyzed in transmittance mode (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI† respectively). The transmittance curve of the glass substrate with a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) layer (520 nm ticker) used as a reference was also measured, represented by the solid black line. The commercial FTO exhibited transmittance higher than 80% in the visible range, which is desirable for PEC application to avoid interferences with the global absorption of the effective layer. As expected the transmittance gradually decreases with synthesis time, i.e., enhancing the thickness of the films reduces the transmittance in comparison with the pure FTO substrate (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†). The thermal treatment leads to a more substantial reduction in the transmittance compared with the as-synthesized film (yellow layer) and the pure FTO substrate. As mentioned above thermal decomposition promoted a color change from yellow to red-brown increasing the film absorption. The red-brown color is associated with the transmission of photons from orange to infrared after strong absorption of photons from yellow to ultraviolet in the visible region. The optical band gap was determined from the transmittance curves converted into the absorption coefficient following the procedure previously described by us. The indirect and direct optical band gap values estimated from Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†) for all synthesized films annealed at the temperatures mentioned in the experimental section are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). The curve profile and values obtained for the indirect (1.5–1.7 eV) and direct (2.1–2.6 eV) optical band gaps are in good agreement with those reported for pure hematite films. Therefore, most of the hematite films exhibit only a single electronic transition except for those films synthesized at 0.25 h, which show two electronic transitions indicating the presence of an intermediate energy level. This intermediate energy level observed in the thinner hematite films is possibly associated with the trapped electrons close to the conduction band. Further experimental investigation should be performed to elucidate the origin of this intermediate level. Souza and co-workers investigating hematite thin films attributed these transitions to the stress induced by the strong interaction between the film and the substrate.38
The morphology evolution of the films at different synthesis stages followed by annealing at 390 °C was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1. Top-view SEM images exhibit the morphology evolution as a function of synthesis time (a–e) and after thermal treatment at 390 °C for 1 h (f). Consistent with the color patterns, we observed that the first layers of iron oxide deposited after 0.25 h are not uniform, with a stalactite-like shape. After 0.75 h, rods are observed to nucleate along the substrate (Fig. 1a–f).
 Fig. 1  Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-synthesized films at (a) 0.25 h, (b) 0.75 h, (c) 1 h (d) 6 h, (e) 12 h, and (f) 24 h and annealed at 390 °C for 1 h. 
After 6 h, the films are clearly composed of nanorods with net vertical alignment, see Fig. 1d, completely covering the substrate, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). This vertically oriented configuration has been attributed to the prompt formation of several nuclei on the substrate, causing a slow net growth (diffusion controlled process) and hence preferential growth in specific crystalline directions due to structural anisotropy.37 Therefore, long synthesis times (12–24 h) will cause significant growth of the nanorods in length but not forming new nuclei, see Fig. 1e and f. Cross-sectional SEM images obtained from the cleaved iron oxide films confirm the growth of fairly vertically aligned nanorods over the glass substrate (Fig. 2). Film thicknesses estimated from the SEM images show an expected growth of the rods in length as a function of time and temperature. For instance, the most significant difference in thickness was observed when comparing films prepared at 6 and 12 h (Fig. 2) with values approximately at 575 nm and 700 nm, respectively. One can also observe a number of rods aligned parallel to the substrate. While this could be due to the sample cleavage affecting the local rod structure, it is also possible that this is a result of a dynamic growth pattern. That is, at the beginning of the growth process, the surface of the FTO substrate is highly reactive and the process is diffusion controlled. However, as growth progresses, the surface reactivity decreases, and the process may change to surface reaction control. This leads to local accumulation of ions in the solution nearby the surface and formation of novel nuclei which can lead to other growth directions. Interestingly, for a very long growth time (24 h, Fig. 1f), all SEM images suggest nanorod “agglomeration”. This can be attributed to an effective decrease in the total concentration of ions in solution, leading to local re-dissolution of the rods, making them shorter and thinner.37

The aforementioned growth process has been investigated by several groups that have shown the nanorods to initially have the akaganeite phase, which is consistent with the observed yellow color.25,29 The decomposition of the akaganeite phase to the iron oxide phase is promoted by the additional thermal treatment. Fig. 3 illustrates the X-ray diffraction patterns for all films annealed at 390 °C for 1 h. The hematite crystallographic structure was indexed as the sole phase in all samples according to the JCPDS card (34-0664). The peaks identified with asterisks were indexed as the tin oxide phase (cassiterite, JCPDS 41-14445 card) related to the transparent conductive layer present on the commercial glass substrate (F:SnO2 layer–FTO substrate). Lattice parameters were calculated from the XRD data for all hematite films and are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The values reveal no significant distortion in parameters a and c and the volume of the cell as compared to the JCPDS card. The slight difference can be related to the nanometric scale or to the fact that these are non-equilibrium crystals.

It is also noticed that the preferential crystal orientation plane, calculated using the relation proposed by Lotgering,39,40 varies randomly with synthesis time. For reference, for photoelectrode applications, higher conductivity and efficient charge separation are better found in (110) planes.11 The hematite films prepared here did not exhibit crystal preferential orientation in (110) planes and these reflection planes only start becoming visible after 1 h of synthesis (Fig. 3b). In fact, the (110) reflection plane does not become preferential in any of the samples annealed at 390 °C.
Therefore, low water oxidation activity under the illuminated conditions of all hematite films can be expected because of the poor electronic conductivity favoring a high recombination rate of photogenerated charges. To confirm this hypothesis, electrochemical measurements (linear sweep analysis) were carried out in the absence and presence of sunlight simulated irradiation (using AM 1.5 global filter with intensity adjusted at 100 mW cm−2) using a three-electrode configuration cell with a quartz window. Fig. 4a shows the photoelectrochemical behavior of selected hematite films prepared at 2, 10 and 24 h. Effectively no difference can be found when comparing their responses under dark and illuminated conditions. As mentioned above, this low hematite film performance under illumination conditions can be in part related to poor charge separation due to the growth of a non-preferential (110) plane. Obviously, this is not the only explanation, but according to the literature and our previous investigations, preferential crystal orientation does play a major role in the performance of the hematite film as a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell.32,34,35
 Fig. 4  (a) Current density, J (mA cm−2), versus voltage (VRHE) was measured at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under dark and illuminated conditions for hematite films annealed at 390 °C for 1 hour. The light intensity was adjusted at 100 mW cm−2. (b) A Mott–Schottky plot (capacitance versus voltage) was obtained from the Nyquist plot measured under dark conditions by impedance spectroscopy. The linear fitting with R = 0.99 was obtained which gives Vo (where the x axis of linear fitting is zero) and the flat band, Vfb, potential from the slope. In both experiments an aqueous electrolyte (NaOH) was used at pH 14. 
The electronic properties of the films were further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under dark conditions. EIS data were analyzed by the Mott–Schottky plot, as exemplified in Fig. 4b for the hematite film obtained at 10 h, and the flat band potential (Vfb) and the donor density (ND) were estimated using eqn (1) and (2), respectively: (1) (2)where e is the elementary charge of an electron (1.6 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor (80 to hematite),41ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), k is the Boltzmann constant and T is temperature. The calculated values of the Vfb and ND parameters for all hematite films investigated in the present study are summarized in Table 1.

In general, the values found here for Vfb and ND are consistent with non-doped or standard hematite reported in the literature.12 Most of the hematites that exhibit similar values of ND (1017 cm−3) show poor charge-separation at room temperature even under sunlight simulated irradiation. The indistinguishable photocurrent response illustrated in Fig. 4a in the dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation confirms the high recombination ratio owing probably to the poor charge-separation efficiency.
To improve the hematite film water oxidation activity a few samples were selected and subjected to a different annealing temperature. The sample selection has been made to include a wide range of thicknesses, which may help us to find the optimized conditions. It has been demonstrated in the literature that, independent of the synthetic route, high annealing temperatures (in the range of 600–800 °C) can play an important role in improving hematite photoelectrocatalytic activity.32,34,35 It is worth mentioning that high temperatures must be used with caution and for short times (from 5 to 30 min maximum) to avoid melting of the glass substrate, ion diffusion from the FTO layer and compromise of the local morphology. In fact, these issues have been the focus of several investigations reporting that the ion diffusion from FTO to the hematite layer, called unintentional doping, can increase the photoelectrocatalytic activity due to an enhancement in charge carrier density. On the other hand, a possible side effect of these missed ions is a sensible reduction of the electronic conductivity in the FTO substrate, which may compromise its charge collection ability during PEC application, reducing the overall efficiency. Leite and co-workers34 conducted a detailed investigation on the influence of a high temperature of thermal treatment showing that at 1000 °C for 4 min the diffusion of Sn from the FTO to the hematite layer is considerable. By using transmission electron microscopy, they estimated a diffusion length of about 100 nm. This suggests that unintentional doping will occur within this thickness and lengthier films will not show increased photocatalytic efficiency as their surfaces remain unchanged.
Herein, a new set of hematite films was prepared at 0.25, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h under hydrothermal conditions and was subjected to a higher annealing temperature of 750 °C for 0.5 h (instead of 390 °C).
XRD analysis of the new set of films obtained after annealing exhibited diffraction patterns of the pure hematite phase, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. No other peaks related to the presence of impurities or extra phases were found, except for the peaks indexed as tin oxide owing to the FTO layer (already discussed above). Lattice parameters and the preferential crystal growth plane were calculated as described above and summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The lattice parameters a and c and unit cell volume are in good agreement with the literature for nanometric hematite.14 Noticeably, the increase in processing temperature enabled the preferential crystal growth of the (110) planes, in contrast to (104) observed when annealed at 390 °C, potentially causing an increase in the overall photoelectric performance. Regarding the morphology shape, no significant change was observed besides the rod length, as illustrated in the SEM images in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to compare the changes caused by both annealing temperatures. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the TEM images confirming that the temperature does not affect the morphology maintaining the rod shape with a slight reduction in the diameter as the temperature increases.

To confirm that the high annealing temperature positively affects the final film performance, electrochemical measurements (linear sweep voltammetry) under dark and illuminated conditions were conducted. The current density, J, against voltage (VRHE) curve illustrated in Fig. 6a showed no response under dark conditions, but in the presence of light the photocurrent response increased with synthesis time. Hematite films obtained at 750 °C exhibit a significant improvement in photocurrent response reaching a maximum at about 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Noteworthily, the photocurrent response is a function of the film annealing time at 750 °C, with 10 h apparently being the optimal processing time.
 Fig. 6  (a) J, current density vs. VRHE, applied potential curves measured (scan rate at 50 mV s−1) under front-side illumination and under dark conditions for hematite electrodes synthesized for 0.25, 2, 6, 10 and 24 hours with additional thermal treatment at 750 °C. (b) Current density versus time, chronoamperometry, at a fixed potential of 1.23 VRHE under front-side illumination. The experiments were carried out using a sunlight simulator coupled with an AM 1.5 global filter. The light intensity was adjusted at 100 mW cm−2. Electrolyte: NaOH aqueous solution at pH 13.6. 
The long-term stability test of all hematite films annealed at 750 °C was evaluated under sunlight irradiation at a fixed potential (1.23 VRHE, energy needed to oxidize water) in aqueous electrolyte at pH 14 for 1 h. The photocurrent responses remained constant during the entire experiment showing good stability, as shown in Fig. 6b. Note that the slight reduction observed during the long-term stability can be attributed to experimental factors, such as lamp intensity drift or electrolyte consumption, and not necessarily film degradation.
An important diagnostic analysis that certifies the quality of the hematite films and the sunlight simulator calibration is to perform incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE, Fig. S9, ESI†) measurements. IPCE can be used as a figure of merit for PEC devices (Fig. S9, ESI†), since it describes the photocurrent density (photocurrent per selected area) collected per incident photon flux as a function of illumination wavelength. In other words, IPCE is the ratio of this photocurrent (converted to an electron rate) versus the rate of incident photons (converted from the calibrated power of a light source), as described by eqn (3): (3)where 1239.8 V nm represents the value obtained by multiplying h (Planck's constant) by c (the speed of light), Pmono is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity in mW cm−2, and λ (nm) is the wavelength at which this illumination power is measured. The IPCE values of the electrodes prepared for 025, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h were 11.4, 9.5, 8.9, 60.5 and 49.6% at 330 nm, respectively, and 3.7, 3.2, 3.0, 18.3 and 16.0% at 450 nm. By integrating the overlap of IPCE data, the estimated photocurrent density values of the undoped hematite electrodes prepared for 0.25, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h were 0.23, 0.21, 0.20, 1.24 and 1.04 mA cm−2, respectively. These values of current density are similar to those found in current–potential analysis under illumination, which means that the source of light used was well adjusted to simulate sunlight irradiation.13
Moreover, the effect of high annealing temperature on the flat band potential (Vfb) and donor density (ND) was evaluated using a linear fitting of a Mott–Schottky plot and following the procedures described before. The results are summarized in Table 2. The films exhibited an enhancement of 2 orders of magnitude in the ND values (from 1017 cm−3 to 1019 cm−3) as compared to the samples treated at lower temperature (Table 1), with an increase in photoactivity achieving a maximum value in the films synthesized at 10 and 24 h. The observed decrease for 24 h may be related to the problems discussed earlier regarding the formation of parallel nanorods with prolonged synthesis times. This would decrease the effective surface area, compromising the photoactivity.

Although this “activating” effect from a high temperature process is aligned with several reports in the literature,32,34,35,42 it is still unclear how the temperature affects the hematite nanorods. Further investigation of the synthetic route was then conducted to elucidate this point. As previously described, the adopted synthesis method (PBM) involves the use of ferric complex oxyhydroxides, which are able to host Cl− ions.37 Jung et al. recently studied the adsorption of Cl− species on the α-Fe2O3(102) surface.43,44 They showed that Cl− has a stable adsorption site with four oxygen atoms surrounding it on the surface and an effective stronger adsorption energy (−1.861 eV), which is consistent with chemisorption. Such high adsorption energy is expected to affect the film growth behavior and its final morphology. Moreover, surface adsorbed Cl− should also influence the photoactivity since Cl− is an electron acceptor attached to an n-type semiconductor possibly blocking surfaces and creating a recombination site. Therefore, one may raise a couple of relevant questions regarding the synthesis method: (i) was the cleaning process on the as-synthesized film enough to eliminate chlorine from the surface of the sample? (ii) Were the temperatures used to promote phase transformation by thermal decomposition high enough to also cause complete chlorine elimination? To answer these questions, a qualitative gas analysis by mass spectroscopy during thermal treatment within TG/DSC was performed to monitor the total decomposition of β-FeOOH into the hematite phase and possible chlorine gas evolution. Due to the limitations of the technique, the iron oxyhydroxide layers were gently removed from the substrate and analyzed in the powder form. Fig. 7a shows the TG/DSC curves. The DSC signal shows an intense and narrow endothermic peak from 100 to 300 °C, likely ascribed to water release (region 1, (R1)) according to the reaction: 2β-FeOOH(S) → α-Fe2O3(S) + H2O(LorG).(R1)This peak is accompanied by a significant mass loss, being consistent with the decomposition of the hydroxide phase. At higher temperatures, there are a series of small endothermic events (region (R2), Fig. 7a) ranging from 500 up to 1000 °C, which could be related to chlorine species found as residues from the synthesis process. A qualitative gas analysis is illustrated in Fig. 7b and confirms that the first endothermic peak (R1) in the TG/DSC is indeed related to dehydration, while the total mass loss observed from 500 to 1000 °C (R2) is because of chlorine, totaling 1.47%. The TG/DSC combined with gas analysis data suggests that during the hematite film preparation, the adopted calcination at 390 °C for 1 h could cause complete dehydration and hematite formation, but did not eliminate the residual chlorine ions from the precursors. These anions are likely on the surface of the nanorods, where they might be pinning the oxyhydroxide structure during thermal decomposition to hematite, avoiding the growth of 110 planes and further acting as electron acceptors by blocking its surfaces. This explains the indistinguishable photoelectrochemical performance of the hematite films treated at low temperature in the absence and presence of light.

Experiments carried out under an oxygen atmosphere in the temperature range from 20 to 1200 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C per minute for the untreated β-FeOOH precursor phase. 
The TG/DSC result suggests that temperatures as high as 1000 °C are needed to eliminate Cl− from the system. However, the test was done using a scanning heating rate, suggesting that isothermal treatments would be efficient in removing at least part of Cl− at lower temperatures. In this sense, a significant reduction of Cl− concentration is expected after treatment at 750 °C, which would enhance donor density by two orders of magnitude, allowing crystal growth preferentially oriented at the (110) reflection plane and resulting in photoactivity comparable to those of the best materials in the literature (for pure hematite).
Note that the usage of chlorine based precursors has been proven important to control rod formation on the substrate, but our results demonstrate that it is essential to eliminate Cl− residues to assure high photoactivities, which can be done by high temperature treatments. In addition to removing Cl−, such treatments have also been shown to promote a better substrate–film interface. Therefore, even though chlorine is removed from the surface using other alternative methods (such as chemical washing), the use of high temperature might be required to improve the charge transport at the solid–solid interface.32,34,35,42 More studies are needed to separate the individual contributions.
Conclusions
In summary, by monitoring the thermal decomposition of iron oxyhydroxide into the hematite phase with a combination of thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry coupled with chemical gas analysis (mass spectroscopy), we have demonstrated the presence of chlorine species remaining from the synthetic process during the fabrication of hematite nanorod films. Since Cl− is an electron acceptor, its presence on the hematite nanorod surface may affect the synthesis process itself as well as photoelectrochemical reactions by acting as an electron trap and a recombination site for photogenerated holes. Removal of Cl− can be achieved by high temperature processing (750 °C), which allows a remarkable increase in the performance. That is, if low annealing temperature (390 °C) is used during the synthesis of hematite films, dehydration and crystallization of the hematite phase occur, but an indistinguishable photocurrent response under dark and illuminated conditions is observed. However, by increasing the annealing temperature (750 °C), not only does phase transformation occur, but also the elimination of partial chlorine species takes place. The estimated donor density number (EIS data) thus increases by two orders of magnitude leading a significant improvement in the photocurrent density under light irradiation up to 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. These findings not only shed light on the high annealing temperature dependence of materials obtained from the PBM method, but also explain previous reports showing that the surface wettability increases with temperature promoting a better PEC performance.32
