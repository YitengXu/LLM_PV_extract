1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received great attention due to their low cost, high charge carrier mobility, large absorption coefficient, and high photoelectric conversion efficiency (their laboratory efficiency has exceeded that of polysilicon solar cells).1–5 Among the layers in the functional stack forming the PSCs, the electron transport layer (ETL) plays the key role in extracting and transporting the electrons from the perovskite light-absorbing layer to the conductive substrate.6–8 Therefore, an improvement in ETLs should not be ignored in the design of state-of-the-art PSCs, otherwise severe interfacial charge recombination will lower the final photovoltaic performance.9 Conventional inorganic ETLs are mainly binary metal oxides. In the early stages of PSC development, most high-efficiency PSCs were based on mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles inherited from the photoanodes of dye-sensitized solar cells.10–12 However, classical mesoporous TiO2 fabrication needs high temperature (>450 °C) annealing during the preparation process, which increases the manufacturing costs and is not compatible with flexible substrates.13,14 In recent years, SnO2 has become an outstanding competitor to TiO2 as an ETL due to its higher electron mobility, better energy level alignment, and lower processing temperature.15–17 These superior properties have made SnO2 a new favorite in the field of electron transport materials.18,19 However, despite great progress achieved for metal oxide ETLs, the finding of new inorganic ETLs is imperative to further boost the efficiency of PSCs, as well as to expand the inorganic ETL family. In particular, low temperature processed ETLs will be of interest for saving energy during device fabrication.
Recently, 2D (transition)-metal dichalcogenides have emerged as novel and promising alternatives for ETLs because of their high electron mobility, thickness-dependent optoelectronic properties, and excellent stability.20–23 The layers of these dichalcogenides are stacked together via van der Waals interaction. A fast charge carrier transfer has been found because the surface exciton collective motion promotes an extreme interfacial charge extraction, thereby lowering the non-radiative recombination.24 The smooth surface is conducive to perovskite crystallization, while the ultra-thin nature makes them attractive for flexible devices.25,26 In this regard, Singh et al. firstly reported MoS2 thin layers as ETLs and obtained an efficiency of 13.1%.27 Afzali et al. reported TaS2 nanosheets as ETLs and achieved an efficiency of 15.23%.28 Malek et al. reported few-atom-thick WS2 nanosheet ETLs, which drove ultrafast charge transfer and achieved an efficiency of 18.21%.29 Thus, so far the performance of PSCs based on metal dichalcogenide ETLs is still far behind the champion devices based on traditional metal oxides as ETLs. The reasons for this may be found in the inherent nature of the metal dichalcogenide, the flatness of the ETLs and the interfaces of both FTO/ETL and perovskite/ETL. SnS2 has a layered structure of Sn atoms being sandwiched between two layers of hexagonally close-packed S atoms. SnS2 has been used in electrocatalysis, field effect transistors and photoelectric detection.30 It is noted that 2D SnS2 has a high electron mobility of 18–760 cm2 V−1 s−1,31 and there are no dangling bonds on the layered SnS2 surface,32 so 2D SnS2 appears advantageous for charge carrier transfer in PSCs.
Additionally, interfacial modification of ETLs can further improve the device performance via the strategies of surface trap passivation, energy level alignment and the improvement of the interfacial contact.33–35 The thin SnO2 ETLs face the issues of pinholes or microholes, the O vacancies and Sn interstitial defects in which would act as the recombination traps, and the surface characteristics of SnO2 could exhibit a significant impact on the crystallinity of perovskite films.36,37 Some researchers used bi-layer ETLs to improve the electron transfer and alleviate the trap density.38–40 For example, Yi et al. reported that the pin-holes on the sol–gel SnO2 layer could be filled with SnO2 nanoparticles to form a uniform and dense surface, leading to a 30% improvement of the PCE.41 Chen et al. developed a sulfidation strategy by converting the ZnO surface into ZnS, and the formed ZnO–ZnS cascade ETL could adjust the energy level arrangement and accelerate the electron transfer.42 More importantly, the S atoms on the ZnO–ZnS surface could coordinate with the Pb ions at the ETL/perovskite interface.
In this study, size-tunable 2D SnS2 nanosheets prepared by a simple hydrothermal route are applied as low-temperature ETLs of PSCs. These SnS2 nanosheet ETLs show a compact and uniform surface, a high transparency, and an effective charge collection and transport ability. PSCs based on sole SnS2 nanosheet ETLs show a high PCE of 18.5%. Besides the direct use of the SnS2 nanosheets as an ETL, they are also used as an interfacial layer for the traditional SnO2 ETL. In this combination, they form an energy level gradient between SnO2 and the perovskite layer. It is beneficial that the SnS2 interlayer improves the perovskite crystallization as well as passivates the defects at the ETL/perovskite interface. Thereby a high PCE of 21.5% is achieved for SnO2–SnS2 bi-layer PSCs along with enhanced stability.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of 2D SnS2 nanosheets
In a typical synthesis, 12 mmol thioamide and 3 mmol SnCl4·5H2O were added into 50 mL deionized water with magnetic stirring for 30 min. The transparent solution was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (80 mL) and hydrothermally treated at 160/180/200 °C for 12 h, and the samples were named NS-1 (160 °C), NS-2 (180 °C) and NS-3 (200 °C), respectively. Then, the as-obtained products were centrifugally washed with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, homogeneous colloids were obtained by dispersing the clean SnS2 nanosheets into ethanol. The preparation process is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.2 Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The SnS2 colloids were deposited onto FTO by one-step spin-coating at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 200 °C for 30 min to obtain the SnS2 ETLs. The controlled SnO2 ETL was prepared by spin-coating using a 0.1 M SnCl2 2H2O isopropanol solution according to our previous recipe.43 The bi-layer SnO2–SnS2 ETL was prepared by spin-coating SnS2 nanosheets on top of SnO2 using the same speed and annealing temperature. The mixed perovskite precursor solution was prepared as the following recipe:44 304.26 mg PbI2, 44.04 mg PbBr2, 103.18 mg FAI, 13.4 mg MABr and 31.56 mg CsI were dissolved into a mixed solvent of 480 μL DMF and 120 μL DMSO. The perovskite solution was coated on the surface of the ETL by one-step deposition by spin-coating at 6000 rpm for 30 s, and 320 μL of chlorobenzene as antisolvent was poured during the last 12 s. The perovskite was calcined at 100 °C for 30 min. After the natural cooling of the perovskites, 30 μL of the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin-coated on the perovskite at 4000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared as the following recipe: 36.2 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (260 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 14.4 μL TBP were dissolved in 500 μL chlorobenzene. Finally, the thermal-evaporated Au layer was prepared as the rear electrode.
3. Results and discussion
The micro-scale morphologies of the SnS2 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 2. The as-obtained products possess a two-dimensional polygonal morphology. By adjusting the reaction temperature, we obtain three kinds of SnS2 nanosheets with different sizes. The mean sizes of the NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 nanosheets are roughly 40, 50 and 60 nm, respectively. Fig. 2(b) shows the HRTEM image of the SnS2 nanosheets. The lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.59 nm are clearly observed, consistent with the (001) plane of SnS2. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the high-angle annulus dark field TEM image and the corresponding EDS mapping, confirming the homogeneous distribution of S and Sn elements. The XRD data in Fig. S2a (ESI†) show that all diffraction peaks are consistent with the 2T-type SnS2 (JCPDS No. 23-0677) hexagonal structure. The strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.1° are assigned to (001) planes, indicating a preferential stacking. To further determine the chemical states, SnS2 is analyzed with XPS (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S2b, ESI†). The XPS survey indicates that the sample is mainly composed of Sn and S. The peaks at binding energies of 163.0 and 161.8 eV correspond to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core levels of S2− (Fig. S2c, ESI†), while the peaks at binding energies of 495.4 and 487.0 eV correspond to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Sn4+ (Fig. S2d, ESI†), which confirms the formation of a pure phase of SnS2.

Generally, an effective ETL should have a compact and pin-hole free surface in order to accelerate the electron transport and prevent charge carrier recombination. Herein, the 2D structures endow the SnS2 ETLs with a flat characteristic. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show top-view SEM images of the SnS2 nanosheet ETLs. All films exhibit conformal and entire coverage on the FTO. The low-magnification SEM images in Fig. S3 (ESI†) further confirm the good coverage. Moreover, from the cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S4 (ESI†), it can be seen that the SnS2 nanosheets are densely covered on the textured FTO substrates, and the film thickness is roughly 40–60 nm. The ETL based on the smaller nanosheets shows a smoother surface morphology as compared with the larger ones. AFM topography images (Fig. 3(e)–(f)) reveal that the root mean square (RMS) roughness values of the ETLs prepared from NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 are 1.85, 3.68 and 4.99 nm, respectively. Thus, the probed surface roughness is verifying the SEM observations.

The light transmittance properties of the different SnS2 ETLs are probed with UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 4(a), all samples exhibit a high transmittance in the visible region. Compared with NS-2 and NS-3, the NS-1 ETL shows the highest transmittance in the visible light region of 400–800 nm. This finding could be attributed to the fact that the NS-1 film has a more uniform and compact surface, leading to less scattering losses. The enhanced light transmittance will help to generate more photoelectrons and finally improve the current density of related PSCs.45 The absorbance spectra of ETLs coated with perovskite active layers are shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†). All these samples exhibit a similar light absorbance and absorption edge, except for the NS-1 film, which exhibits a slightly higher absorbance in the visible region. The electron extraction performance of the NS-1/perovskite, NS-2/perovskite and NS-3/perovskite is analyzed by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL peak of the NS-1/perovskite sample is weaker than that of the NS-2/perovskite and NS-3/perovskite samples (Fig. S5b, ESI†), indicating an enhanced charge carrier extraction. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is employed to investigate the charge carrier lifetime (Fig. S5c, ESI†), and the fitted average lifetimes (τ) for NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 films are 6.9, 9.8 and 13.9 ns, respectively. The shorter lifetime indicates a more effective electron extraction from the perovskite to the ETLs. The conductivities of the SnS2 ETLs are investigated using an electron-layer-only device with the structure of FTO/SnS2/Au. Fig. 4(b) shows the device structure and the obtained current–voltage curves. The conductivities (σ) of the SnS2 ETLs are calculated by the equation σ = d/AR, where d is the thickness of the ETL, R is the resistance and A is the active area.46 The results show that the NS-1 ETL exhibits the highest conductivity of (3.6 ± 0.2) × 10−5 S cm−1 in comparison with NS-2 of (2.9 ± 0.2) × 10−5 S cm−1 and NS-3 of (1.7 ± 0.1) × 10−5 S cm−1. Both the better quality of the NS-1 film and an improved interfacial contact in the FTO/NS-1/Au device are contributing to this best conductivity.

Fig. 4(c) shows the absorbance spectra of the SnS2 nanosheets. The corresponding Tauc plots obtained from the absorbance spectra indicate values of the band gaps of 2.51 eV (NS-1), 2.48 eV (NS-2) and 2.35 eV (NS-3), respectively. It is noted that despite the ETLs not being completely transparent to visible light, the thickness of the SnS2 ETLs is thin enough to avoid self-absorption as confirmed from the transmittance spectra. The energy levels of SnS2 ETLs are a key parameter for effective charge transfer, and were investigated with UPS spectra (Fig. 4(d)). By subtracting the secondary electron cut-off of the SnS2 ETLs from the excitation energy of the He–I spectrum (21.11 eV),47,48 the Fermi level (Ef) or work function of −3.01 eV (NS-1), −3.57 eV (NS-2) and −3.88 eV (NS-3) is obtained (Fig. S6, ESI†). According to the confirmed band gaps, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the SnS2 nanosheet film is calculated to be −3.98 eV (NS-1), −4.02 eV (NS-2) and −4.26 eV (NS-3). Thus, the CBM levels of SnS2 ETLs match well with the CBM of the perovskite (Fig. S6c, ESI†), which could effectively realize the electron transfer at the ETL/perovskite interface and block holes.

Fig. 5(a) shows the schematic diagram of PSCs based on 2D SnS2 nanosheets as ETLs before and applied to annealing. The homogeneous surface of the 2D nanosheet boosts good spreading for the precursor solution of the perovskite, which is helpful to grow large-size grains. In addition, benefiting from the interaction between Pb and S, high quality perovskite films are expected after annealing,49 which are demonstrated in SEM images (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 5(b) shows the J–V curves of the PSCs based on the different SnS2 nanosheet ETLs. The J–V curves show the champion devices in each series, and detailed parameters are shown in Table 1. The PSCs based on NS-1 ETLs exhibit the highest PCE of 18.5%, with a Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.9%. As the size of the SnS2 nanosheets increases, both the Jsc and FF decrease. On the one hand, the variation of Jsc is correlated with the film transmittance. Obviously, the NS-1 ETL with high transmittance could reduce the loss of incident light, thus improving the light utilization. On the other hand, the surface flatness of the ETL and interfacial contact induce different trap-state densities and electron mobilities in the PSCs. Among the three kinds of ETLs, NS-1 exhibits the lowest trap-state density and fastest electron mobility, which is revealed in the following SCLC analysis. The NS-1 PSC shows the largest FF due to the highest conductivity of the NS-1 ETL, thus contributing a great deal to the final PCE. The PSCs without ETLs are also prepared to highlight the superiority of SnS2. The device shows a poor efficiency of 6.11% (Fig. S8, ESI†) with low Jsc and Voc due to the interfacial charge accumulation and recombination. Thus, the SnS2 ETL/perovskite heterojunction is critical for electron extraction and device performance. Moreover, the hysteresis phenomenon based on different ETLs is investigated (Fig. 5(c) and Fig. S9, ESI†). The hysteresis index (HI) values are calculated according to the equation of HI = (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse, which are 0.07, 0.08 and 0.11 for the NS-1, NS-2 and NS-3 ETL-based PSCs, respectively. The origin of hysteresis is mainly attributed to interfacial defects, ion migration, and imbalance of carrier transport at interfaces.50,51 The PSCs based on the SnS2 ETLs show relatively weak hysteresis, indicating less charge accumulation and efficient electron extraction at the selective contacts. The steady-state current density and PCE output were measured to explore the operation status of the PSCs. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the devices maintain a relatively stabilized output for over 250 s, and the PCEs are close to those attained from the reverse scan. The statistical data including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). It is found that the PSCs based on the 2D SnS2 ETLs show a good repeatability, which is of high interest for a real world application. The PCE of 18.5% achieved in this work is significantly higher than two previous pioneering studies, which delivered PCEs of 13.63%52 and 13.2%,53 respectively. Fig. 5(d) exhibits the IPCE spectra of the PSCs. Obviously, the PSC based on NS-1 has an enhanced IPCE in the range of 300∼800 nm, and the IPCE value decreases with the size increase of the 2D SnS2 nanosheets. The integrated current densities calculated from IPCE are also displayed, which agree well with the J–V results. We also investigate the influence of annealing temperature applied to SnS2 ETLs on the photovoltaic performance. It is found that the PSCs exhibit very close efficiencies at the annealing temperature of 150, 200 and 250 °C (Fig. S12 and Table S1, ESI†).

To further explore the electronic properties of the devices, we fabricate the electron-layer-only devices (FTO/SnS2/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag) to evaluate the trap density according to the SCLC model. The obtained dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. 5(e). At a low bias voltage, the linear curve exhibits an Ohmic response. When the voltage goes beyond a rapid nonlinear trap-filled limit region (kink point), the current increases nonlinearly, indicating that the trap-states are filled. The trap density can be calculated by the following formula: VTFL = entd2/2ε0ε.54 Table S2 (ESI†) shows the VTFL and the related trap-state density based on the different SnS2 nanosheets. The trap densities of NS-1, NS-2, and NS-3 are 0.87 × 1016, 0.91 × 1016 and 2.57 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. Fig. 5(f) shows the charge carrier mobility (μ) according to the Mott–Gurney law.2,43 The fitted electron mobility of NS-1 is 7.13 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is larger than for NS-2 (4.69 × 10−3) and NS-3 (2.66 × 10−3). Considering that the device structure and the fabrication procedure are identical for all devices, the low trap density and high charge mobility of NS-1 should be driven by both a better perovskite crystallization and interfacial charge transfer.
It has been reported that there are strong coordinations between S and perovskite. For example, perovskite can be better stabilized by the addition of sulfur (S8) owing to amine–sulfur coordination.55 Yang et al. demonstrated that sulfur on the surface of NiO was bonded to Pb ions in the perovskite, which effectively passivated the interface defects.56 As the buried SnS2/perovskite interface is hardly detectable, the XPS spectra of the pure perovskite and SnS2 mixed perovskite layer are measured to investigate the potential interactions between S2− and Pb2+ in the perovskite. As shown in Fig. 5(g), two peaks assigned to Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 shift to stronger binding energy for the SnS2 mixed perovskite sample, indicating the reduced electron density around Pb ions. This confirms the strong interaction between the SnS2 ETL and perovskite, which would be beneficial to passivate the interfacial trap states and suppress charge recombination at the SnS2/perovskite interfaces.57,58
The interfacial engineering of the ETL is a significant strategy to optimize the interfacial contact and regulate the energy level arrangement. The traditional SnO2 ETL suffers from a much lower conduction band compared to the perovskite and the presence of surface trap sites.43 Therefore, herein, SnS2 nanosheets are further used as an interfacial layer between a SnO2 nanoparticle ETL and the perovskite active layer to reduce the energy loss at that interface. We select the NS-1 nanosheets, which are best performing and they are spin-coated on top of a dense SnO2 ETL. As can be seen from the cross-sectional SEM in Fig. S13 (ESI†), by incorporating the NS-1 interfacial layer the irregular valleys on the pristine SnO2 ETL have been filled in, resulting in a much smoother surface. Furthermore, we investigate the morphology variation of the perovskite active layers based on a single-layer SnO2 ETL and a bi-layer SnO2–SnS2 ETL. As shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the average grain size of the perovskite based on SnO2–SnS2 is obviously larger than that of SnO2 (593 vs. 242 nm). The analogous large grain sizes are also observed in the single-layered SnS2 ETL discussed before (Fig. S7, ESI†), which further indicates that the surface of 2D SnS2 ETLs is beneficial to the growth of large perovskite grains. The cross-sectional SEM images of completed PSCs are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d), in which the ETLs, perovskite active layers, hole transport layers and gold electrodes are clearly observed. The perovskite layer based on the SnO2–SnS2 ETL is well-crystallized and shows large-sized grains.

The energy levels of the two different ETLs are investigated by UPS (Fig. S14, ESI†). The conduction band of SnO2–SnS2 shifts from −4.02 to −3.97 eV as compared with SnO2. The energy level diagram of the device is illustrated in Fig. 7(a). Thus, a gradient heterojunction is constructed in the SnO2–SnS2 double layer ETL, which could accelerate the electron transfer along with preventing the electron back-flow in the device.59Fig. 7(b) and Table 2 present the J–V curves of the champion PSCs and the related device parameters. The PSC based on the SnO2 ETL exhibits a Voc of 1.11 V, Jsc of 22.6 mA cm−2, FF of 69.9% and PCE of 17.6%. After the incorporation of the SnS2 interlayer, all the photovoltaic parameters are significantly increased, exhibiting for the best performing device a Voc of 1.14 V, Jsc of 23.7 mA cm−2, FF of 79.2% and PCE of 21.5%. Thus, the bi-layer ETL combines the merits of the single SnO2 and SnS2 layers, achieving a synergetic effect. Specifically, the amorphous SnO2 under-layer could fill the irregular valleys of the FTO substrate and make the substrate smoother, so the current leakage between FTO and the perovskite layer could be inhibited.36 The 2D SnS2 nanosheets in the top-layer confine the epitaxial growth of the perovskite, thereby easily triggering larger grain sizes. More importantly, the SnS2 layer introduces a gradient energy level between the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer. The better energy level alignment between the perovskite and SnO2–SnS2 ETL can effectively promote the extraction of photogenerated electrons and inhibit charge carrier recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface.60 Consequently, the bi-layered SnO2–SnS2 ETL based PSCs exhibit greatly improved photovoltaic performance compared with single-layer SnO2 or SnS2 ETL devices.

A notable decrease of the dark current density is observed for the SnO2–SnS2 device, indicating a reduced charge carrier recombination. The steady-state current densities are recorded by holding the bias voltage at the maximum power point (VMPP = 0.858 V for the SnO2 PSCs, and VMPP = 0.952 V for the SnO2–SnS2 PSCs), as displayed in Fig. 7(c). The steady-state PCEs of the SnO2–SnS2 and SnO2 PSCs are 21.5% and 17.5%, respectively. The steady-state output PCEs are very close to the values of the J–V results, further demonstrating the stable and actual good performance of the devices. We prepared 20 individual devices based on SnO2 and SnO2–SnS2 ETLs, respectively, to explore the repeatability. The statistical distribution of the PCE is shown in Fig. 7(d). The SnO2 PSCs show an average efficiency of 17.1%, whereas the bi-layer ETL PSCs show an average efficiency of 20.6%. Apparently, the photovoltaic performance is significantly improved after incorporating the SnS2 interlayer to the ETL.
XRD data of the perovskite layers prepared on different ETLs are measured to investigate the influence of the SnS2 interlayer on the crystallinity of the perovskites. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 20.2°, 32.1°, 40.7°, and 43.3° are assigned to the (110), (112), (222), (224), and (314) planes of the perovskite crystal, respectively. The (110) peaks of the SnO2–SnS2 sample are obviously enhanced as compared with SnO2, and the ratio of (110) to (112) peak intensity increases from 2.1 to 4.4. Therefore, the SnS2 interlayer induces a preferential orientation of the perovskite crystals and also improves their crystallinity. The FWHM of the (110) peaks decreases from 0.21 to 0.16, confirming the presence of larger perovskite grains after the incorporation of the SnS2 interlayer. The trap densities are further investigated by the SCLC model. The VTFL values of the SnO2 and SnO2–SnS2 devices are 1.38 and 0.76 V (Fig. 8(b)), leading to the corresponding trap densities of 2.86 × 1016 and 1.58 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The reduced trap densities could be attributed to the interaction between S and under-coordinated Pb2+ at the SnS2/perovskite interface. PL and TRPL decay measurements are employed to evaluate the electron extraction rates (Fig. 8(c) and (d)). The PL intensity of the SnO2–SnS2/perovskite decreases to 30% of SnO2/perovskite, which indicates the faster electron extraction of the SnO2–SnS2 ETL.61 The charge carrier lifetime is extracted from the TRPL curves via fits, and the results are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). The average lifetime decreases from 18.62 ns (SnO2/perovskite) to 15.23 ns (SnO2–SnS2/perovskite), demonstrating the rapid electron injection from the perovskite to the ETL due to the gradient energy level in the SnO2–SnS2 ETL.

Finally, the long-term stabilities of both perovskite films and PSCs are investigated. The XRD data of the unsealed perovskite films placed in an air atmosphere at a relative humidity of 40–50% for 14 days are measured. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the perovskite film prepared on the SnO2 ETL is severely decomposed after aging and the obvious PbI2 peak is observed, whereas the perovskite prepared on the SnO2–SnS2 ETL maintains the XRD data compared with the fresh sample (Fig. 8(a)) due to the strong coordination of SnS2 with the perovskite layer. The PCE evolution as a function of time is shown in Fig. 9. The devices are stored in a glove box and their reverse scanning efficiencies are measured regularly. Obviously, the degradation of the two devices is significantly different. The PCE of the SnO2-based device shows a rapid degradation after 1000 h, which retains only 40% of the initial efficiency. The SnO2–SnS2 based device still retains more than 80% of the initial efficiency after 1752 h storage. This finding demonstrates that the SnS2 interlayer in the ETL greatly improves the long-term stability of the devices, which is of particular interest for applications. In addition, a summary of the device performance based on metal sulfide ETLs in recent years is listed in Table S4 (ESI†), and the PCEs achieved in this study rank top among them.

4. Conclusion
In summary, 2D SnS2 nanosheets are synthesized by the hydrothermal method and applied as low temperature ETLs in PSCs. These SnS2 ETLs show a compact and uniform surface, a high transparency, and a fast mobility. The devices based on the 2D SnS2 nanosheets show a champion efficiency of 18.5% with a high Voc of 1.09 V and an impressive Jsc of 22.7 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the 2D SnS2 nanosheets are spin-coated on a dense SnO2 film for the realization of interfacial modification. The SnS2 interfacial layer is used to regulate the energy level arrangement between the ETL and the perovskite layer. Moreover, the interaction between S and Pb can passivate the defects at the SnO2–SnS2/perovskite interface and reduce non-radiative recombination. As a result, the devices based on the SnO2–SnS2 ETL achieve a high efficiency of 21.5%. More importantly, the bi-layer devices exhibit a better stability as compared with single-layer SnO2 based PSCs. Therefore, this work demonstrates the use of novel 2D metal sulfides as effective electron transport and interfacial layers of PSCs, which could be a meaningful alternative to the conventionally used metal oxides.
