    AbstractWe report the use of oxygen vacancy-rich CuO-ZnO inverse opals to strikingly enhance the performance of catalytic methanol reforming reaction with a ratio of 1:0.125:1 (H2O/O2/MeOH) at a low reaction temperature of only 230 °C, yielding complete conversion of methanol, high hydrogen production rate, ultralow CO formation, and outstanding stability.
Introduction
Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) nanostructures (so-called inverse opals) have attracted considerable attention in recent times owing to the wide variety of their potential applications in areas such as photonic crystals, molecular sieves, catalysts, antireflective coatings, sensors, as well as electrodes for fuel and solar cells.1 In addition, such well-ordered nanoarchitectures also exhibit several advantages, such as quick transfer of heat and mass, low pressure drop, and high contact area between the catalysts and reactants, that render them ideal for gas catalysis.2–4 With the recent upsurge in non-conventional energy generation, and environmental and resource conservation research, there is growing interest in the development of novel catalysts that can effectively and selectively promote the desired reactions related to the production of clean energy.5 Hydrogen is an efficient energy source that can combine with oxygen in a fuel cell to produce electricity and water without generating pollutants, and thus represents an environmentally benign fuel of the future. Catalytic reforming of methanol in a microreactor is a promising approach for hydrogen generation for use in portable power sources, which avoids the hydrogen storage and safety related issues.6,7 The typical oxidative steam reforming of methanol, which combines the endothermic steam reforming reaction with the exothermic partial oxidation reaction, can be generalized as follows6,7CH3OH + 1/2H2O + 1/4O2 → CO2 + 2.5H2
However, one of the most critical impediments that hinders the realization of microreformers for catalyses is poor utilization and low efficiency of the catalyst layer deposited inside the microchannels, usually in the form of a dense film.8 Recent approaches for overcoming this issue typically involve a two-step process, wherein active catalysts are prepared in the first step, followed by their immobilization on the surface of the microchannels in the second step. Various deposition techniques have also been reported for several heterogeneously catalyzed processes in microreactors.9 These methods, however, do not yield sufficiently effective surfaces required for the reactants to effectively access the catalytically active sites. Therefore, evolution of 3DOM nanoarchitectures that enable integration of direct synthesis of catalyst and its immobilization on the surface is essential for efficient catalytic reforming of methanol at low temperature.
Extensive research efforts have recently been devoted to the syntheses of various Cu-based catalysts for high-performance methanol reformers or methanol synthesis due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and natural abundance as compared to the conventional precious-metal catalysts (Pt, Pd).10–14 More recently, numerous studies have focused on gaining in-depth understanding of the effect of oxide supports/promoters towards enhancement of catalytic performance, including their electronic structure, nanostructure, morphology, and surface defect characteristics.15–20 It is particularly noteworthy that native defects (oxygen vacancies, Vo) on the surface of oxide supports have been shown to generate active entities that facilitate the reforming reaction as well as CO oxidation, when doped with rare earth or transition-metal elements.21–24 Nevertheless, these doping approaches are unfavorable for the low cost objectives and environmental benignity, especially from the point of view of the lack of “green chemistry”. To address this problem, we have attempted here to employ an extremely simple technique of plasma treatment to create oxygen vacancies (Vo) on the oxide surface to improve the performance of catalytic methanol reforming reaction (MRR). In this communication, we report for the first time the fabrication and characterization of O2-plasma activated CuO-ZnO inverse opals as high-performance microreformers for methanol. As can be seen from Fig. 1, our key strategy in this work is to fabricate 3DOM nanoarchitectures consisting of macropores as well as mesopores to ensure a high surface area, and generation of oxygen vacancies (Vo) through O2-plasma treatment to produce additional active entities for MRR.

Results and discussion
The CuO-ZnO inverse opals were synthesized directly inside the microreactor by simple wet-chemical methods, using the colloidal crystal templating (CCT) approach (Fig. S1 of the ESI†).1 Polystyrene (PS) opals were first self-assembled inside the microchannels of a microreactor, followed by infiltration with metal precursors (Cu2+, Zn2+) within the voids, and final removal of the opal templates by calcination. After synthesis, the inverse opals were exposed to O2 plasma for 3, 5, 10, and 15 min. The microstructural characterization was carried out by using several analytical techniques including electron microscopy (EM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and N2 adsorption/desorption. The catalytic performance of O2-plasma treated CuO-ZnO 3DOM nanoarchitectures in MRR was systematically evaluated.

Fig. 2 shows the morphology and microstructure of hierarchical 3DOM nanostructures. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image illustrates a continuous oxide framework consisting of an interconnected pore network permeating throughout the structure (Fig. 2a). The nanoarchitectures fabricated exhibit a uniform pore size of ∼300 nm, interconnected by ∼220 nm windows between the adjacent pores. This represents a shrinkage of about 40% during calcination since PS beads used as sacrificial templates were of ∼500 nm size. One of the most significant advantages of hierarchical 3DOM nanoarchitectures, which are clearly distinct from the traditional catalysts, is the high void fraction resulting in a large surface area for effective surface contact between the reactants and catalysts. To further elucidate the inner architectures of the inverse opals, the surface area and porosity were estimated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S2 of the ESI†). The nanoarchitectures exhibited a typical type IV isotherm according to the IUPAC classification. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis of the isotherm confirmed the presence of the mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area of 281 m2 g−1, as well as a bimodal pore size distribution of ∼3.1 and ∼6 nm, as determined through the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) desorption pore distribution method. As a result, this nanoarchitecture provides an isotropic porous structure with easily accessible pore openings from any direction, which is extremely desirable for various electrochemical and catalytic applications. The crystal structure of these inverse opals was studied by XRD analysis, which matched with the JCPDS (No.80-1268) of CuO and JCPDS (No.79-0208) of ZnO. A typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of CuO nanocrystal (NC) on the ZnO support shows that the surface of CuO NC with a particle size of about 10 nm is partially covered by ZnO, preventing it from sintering during MRR. Additionally, several disordered wormhole-like mesopores (indicated by the circles) are also observed. This agrees very well with the BET results. A higher-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2b) reveals that the (111) plane of the CuO NC is in contact with the (101) plane of the ZnO support. Further investigations with elemental mappings via energy-filtered TEM revealed the presence of uniformly dispersed CuO NCs surrounded by ZnO supports inside the hierarchically inverse opals (Fig. 3).

In order to gain further insight into the evolution of defects during O2 plasma exposure, micro-Raman analyses were performed. Fig. 2c presents the typical Raman spectra of CuO-ZnO 3DOM nanoarchitectures for different durations of plasma exposure. The spectra show several peaks characteristic of various vibrational modes of ZnO and CuO. The presence of a sharp and dominant E2 (high) mode at 438 cm−1, which is associated with the vibration of oxygen atoms in ZnO, indicates the wurtzite nature of ZnO.25 After plasma treatment, this mode becomes weak and significantly broader, presumably due to the plasma-induced lattice disorder and a change in band structure of ZnO.25 However, further increase in plasma exposure time to over 10 min possibly leads to the repair of the structural defects via excess O-doping and results in the re-appearance of a strong E2 (high) mode. On the other hand, the broad peak at 500–700 cm−1 can be deconvoluted into two Lorentzian components viz, A1 (LO) and E1 (LO) mode at 575 cm−1 (originating from the Vo of ZnO) and Bg mode at 630 cm−1 related to CuO, respectively.25,26 Thus, the concentration of Vo was calculated by integrating the intensity of the 575 cm−1 peak and taking its ratio with the sum of the 575 and 438 cm−1 peaks. The concentration of Vo on ZnO thus obtained was plotted as a function of plasma exposure time (Fig. S3 of the ESI†), which reaches a maximum value at 10 min of plasma exposure, manifesting the highest concentration of Vo produced by O2 plasma treatment. In contrast, excess plasma exposure may cause compensative effects leading to filling up of the oxygen vacancies by O-doping.
In order to understand the modification of electronic structure in CuO-ZnO inverse opals with O2-plasma treatment, XPS measurements were carried out, the results of which are illustrated in Fig. 4. The O 1s core level spectra of CuO-ZnO 3DOM nanoarchitectures after plasma treatment in O2 in Fig. 4A display a slight shift of the main peak towards higher binding energy, likely as a result of the modification in band bending.27–29 Furthermore, to probe the nature of charge-transfer in CuO-ZnO nanoarchitectures after O2-plasma treatment, the XPS spectra for Cu 2p and Zn 2p3/2 were recorded and are presented in Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C, respectively. The shifts in binding energies of the Cu 2p and Zn 2p3/2 spectra after O2 plasma treatment are likely due to the transfer of electron from ZnO to CuO. This is consistent with the increase in density of Vo on ZnO surface with plasma treatment, which involves loss of electrons from ZnO.

Fig. 5a compares the effects of material architecture and O2-plasma treatment on the methanol conversion and rates of hydrogen production during MRR, respectively. After hydrogen pre-reduction, all experiments were run for 20 h with working catalysts (Cu-ZnO inverse opals). The chemical state of metallic Cu (served as active species) could be determined via XAS measurements (Fig. S4 of the ESI†). Minor deviations were observed in repeated runs, which are indicated by the small error bars in the figures. Notably, the methanol conversion and hydrogen production rates in a microreactor with O2-plasma treated Cu-ZnO inverse opals for plasmaexposure time of 10 min are nearly 100% and 300 mmol gcat−1 h−1 at a temperature as low as 230 °C, respectively, which are significantly higher than those obtained with the conventional dense-film microstructures (non-inverse opals). SEM image of the Cu-ZnO non-inverse opals clearly shows presence of randomly oriented microstructures (Fig. S5 of the ESI†). The 3-fold enhancement in catalytic activity and consequently hydrogen production rate obtained here correlate well with the introduction of high specific surface area and effective surface modification with O2-plasma treatment. Owing to special pore structure, the occurrence of fast gas–solid reactions benefits significantly from proceeding inside the porous transport pathways of 3DOM nanoarchitectures. In addition, O2-plasma treatment is shown to increase the surface concentration of Vo, which provides more active sites for MRR, based on the equation:Vo′′ + 2e′ + O* → Oox + *where Vo′′, Oox, and * are oxygen vacancy, lattice oxygen, and surface active site, respectively.30 Accordingly, it is well recognized that both hierarchical pore-channel networks as well as surface density of Vo are crucial to the observed excellent catalytic activity. On the other hand, only minor amounts of CO were detected by CO detector in the outlet gas stream. The CO concentration of only 130–170 ppm at 230 °C was detected for the O2-plasma treated 3DOM nanoarchitectures with plasma exposure time of 10 min. This result can be attributed to a higher surface density of Vo as a result of the O2-plasma treatment. It is believed that the Vo can generate lattice oxygen that, in turn, catalyzes the CO oxidation reaction.23 Previous investigations have pointed out that the presence of Vo plays an important role in the CO oxidation reaction due to the fact that they provide sites for oxygen activation by formation of O2− anion radicals.31 Likewise, the energy calculations also confirm that the presence of Vo promotes the CO oxidation reaction.32 Thus, the unique nanoarchitecture developed in this study certainly provides a promising alternative for catalytic generation of high purity hydrogen without requiring a complex combination of multiple CO-clean systems to produce clean electrical energy from small fuel cells for automotive applications. Last but not least, the advantage of O2-plasma treated inverse opals is further exemplified by the outstanding stability (a minimal degradation rate of only 10% after 80 h of continuous operation) in MRR, which is significantly superior to the 31% reduction for the commercial catalysts (Fig. 5b). The XRD results on pre- and post-reaction inverse opals show no apparent difference in the crystal structure. SEM observations of the post-reaction inverse opals also confirm that the microstructure is essentially unchanged, although some small fraction of macropores appeared to have collapsed.

Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated an easy route to fabricate a novel CuO-ZnO catalyst with well-defined inverse opal nanostructure on the inner surface of microchannels, via direct synthesis, for microreformer applications. The 3DOM nanoarchitectures have distinct advantages in terms of enhanced catalytic activities since they posse a high specific surface area as well as enable effective transport of reactant molecules to the active sites. The Vo-rich Cu-ZnO inverse opal obtained in this study at a low-reaction temperature of only 230 °C yields complete conversion of methanol, high hydrogen production rate (300 mmol gcat−1 h−1), low CO formation (130–170 ppm), and outstanding stability (after continuous 80 h of operation), making it exceedingly promising toward MRR. The present results prove that the catalytic performance of Cu-ZnO catalysts for MRR can indeed be improved through control not only of hierarchical pore-channel networks but also of Vo induced by O2-plasma treatment. These efforts open up new opportunities in the development of highly active and selective nanoarchitectures for a wide range of different catalytic reaction systems.
