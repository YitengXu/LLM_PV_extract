    , Accepted 1st December 2014First published on 22nd December 2014AbstractTwo, third-generation triphenylamine-based dendrimers (DT1 and DT2) were prepared through a simple convergent approach by using a combination of versatile carbon–carbon formation reactions. It is found that the π-linkages connecting the periphery into the core have a pronounced effect on the properties of the material. The introduction of CC bonds in the periphery improves the photophysical behavior and optical qualities of the films in comparison with their introduction in the core of the dendrimer. Both dendrimers exhibit high Tgs (above 240 °C) and high-lying HOMO energy levels of ∼5.2 eV. As the hole-transporting layer fabricated through a facile solution process, DT2 can endow an Alq3 based multi-layer OLED device with a maximum brightness of 5020 cd m−2, and a maximum current efficiency of 2.36 cd A−1.
Introduction
Electron-donating aromatics, such as triarylamines (TAAs), play a leading role in optoelectronics as organic charge-transporting materials, due to their relatively simple synthetic accessibility, good stability to oxidation and high charge-carrier mobility.1–3 For example, the most commonly used hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) are triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives such as N,N-diphenyl-N,N-bis(m-toly)benzidine (TPD) and N,N-dinaphthyl-N,N-diphenyl benzidine (NPB).4–6 Though both TPD and NPB present excellent hole-transporting abilities, their functionalities are limited, in some degree, by their low glass-transition temperatures (Tgs) (60 °C for TPD; 98 °C for NPB), which significantly reduce the thermal and morphological stability of film during device operation. Also, their thin films need to be fabricated through the relatively costly vapor-deposited approach. To be useful for high-performing devices, it is highly desirable to have HTMs with good solution-processability, high thermal and morphological stability, and excellent simultaneous charge-injecting and transporting abilities.7 In this regard, linear oligo, star-shaped, as well as branched TPAs have been explored to extend the π-conjugation length for stabilizing radical cations.1,8 Moreover, it was found that upon the growth of TPA repeating units, the corresponding oligomers exhibited a much better amorphous nature with increased Tgs as high as ∼150 °C, while maintaining very good hole-transporting abilities for OLED applications.9
Compared to linear small molecules, oligomers or polymers, dendrimers are perfect mono-dispersed macromolecules with a regular and highly branched three-dimensional (3D) architecture, thereby providing an unusual environment for the precise placement of charge-transport units in a single molecule. Such dendritic characteristics are greatly beneficial for improving solubility and processability to achieve high-quality amorphous films, and for suppressing strong intermolecular interactions to enhance morphological stability.10 More importantly, TPA dendrimers can produce highly delocalized radical cations that help to enhance electrical or photochemical stabilities for charge transport.2e Therefore, the incorporation of TPA units into 3D dendritic structures has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy towards the realization and advancement of high-performing HTMs, not only for OLEDs11 but also for solar cell devices.12 For example, 3D 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)amino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been widely used as a HTM in state-of-the-art perovskite-absorber solar cells, which have realized a quite high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼17.0%.12a In addition to hole-transporting applications, these 3D TPA dendrimers have been successfully used as the key structural components for creating unique optoelectronic properties, by attaching them into host-free electrophosphorescent,13 organic solar cell absorbing,14 electroconductive,15 or nonlinear optical16 materials. All these points inspire us to develop a new molecular design strategy for the preparation of TPA based dendrimers.
Nonetheless, the preparation of TPA-based functional dendrimers, especially high generation dendrimers, remains a big challenge, because tedious and complicated repeating steps are required during the synthesis, and extremely low solubility may be encountered in these quite rigid conjugated systems.1,8 Here, we describe a simple convergent strategy to prepare two high generation π-conjugated dendrimers (DT1 and DT2, Fig. 1) fully constructed by 22 TPA units, which have different π-linkage modes between the TPA units leading from the periphery into the core. The whole synthetic process does not require any protection and de-protection steps when employing versatile carbon–carbon formation reactions including Suzuki coupling, Wittig–Horner and Sonogashira coupling reactions. Both dendrimers have been well characterized, and their optical, thermal, electrochemical and hole-transporting properties will be presented in detail.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
For a convergent approach, it is quite important to design a suitable and easily functionalized AB2 building block to grow subsequent generations of dendritic ensembles. Here, two such intermediates 1 and 4 (Scheme 1) were prepared by introducing different reactive groups into three active C4 sites of TPA. Compound 1, bearing two aryl halide groups and one aldehyde group, was prepared following the published method,17 while four steps were needed to synthesize compound 4 with one aryl halide group and two phosphonate groups. As shown in Scheme S1,†S5 was prepared first from TPA by a combination of a typical Vilsmeier reaction and Tuker iodination. Then, S6 was obtained by a reduction of S5 with NaBH4 in quantitative yield. Subsequent treatment of S6 with trimethyl phosphate and two equivalents of iodine at room temperature afforded 4 in the yield of 44.7% according to a similar procedure to that reported by Marder et al.18

Since the different functional groups in the AB2 building blocks (1 and 4) can undergo different reactions selectively, no protection or de-protection chemistry is required to prepare subsequent generations of dendrimers by employing versatile carbon–carbon formation reactions (Suzuki coupling, Wittig–Horner and Sonogashira coupling reactions). The synthetic route of the dendrimers is shown in Scheme 1. First, compound 1 reacted in a standard Suzuki coupling reaction with 2 or in a Sonogashira coupling reaction with 6 to produce the first generation 3 and 7 (G1-CHO), respectively, in good yields. Then, all-trans second generation 5 and 8 (G2-I) were synthesized via a simple Wittig–Horner reaction between 4 and the respective G1-CHO using t-BuOK as the base with ∼60% yields. Finally, the core 9 reacted with 5 to afford the third generation (G3) dendrimer, DT1, via a Sonogashira coupling reaction in a 49% yield, while DT2 was obtained by an improved Suzuki coupling reaction19 between core 10 and 8 in a 45.5% yield using KOH as the base. Considering the rigidity and steric hindrance of G2-I, the yields of G3 bearing up to 22 TPA units were satisfactory. Therefore, our design strategy using a combination of versatile carbon–carbon formation reactions shows much better synthetic efficiency for the preparation of high generation TPA based dendrimers compared to strategies based on monotonously repeating the same reactions, such as the copper catalyzed Ullmann reaction.12b,c
All the new compounds are quite stable toward air, soluble in common organic solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and THF, and readily form thin films. Their structures were fully confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis (see ESI† for details). The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) data shows that both DT1 and DT2 exhibit a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) (1.05 and 1.08, respectively), indicating the good purity of these two dendrimers. Additionally, the signal assigned to molecular ions in MALDI-TOF MS is a clear way to verify the presence of the desired compounds. Here, the molecular ion signal peak of DT1 locates at 5582.5 Da (calcd m/z 5582.4), while for DT2, it is at 5802.7 Da (calcd m/z 5798.4). Fig. 2 illustrates the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum and GPC trace of DT1 as an example.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of DT1 and DT2 were measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with the results summarized in Table 1. It has been shown that rapid molecular motion near the Tg of HTMs will greatly change the morphologies of films, thereby reducing the device stability and lifetime.7 Thus a good HTM needs to possess a high Tg to slow down the device degradation. As shown in Fig. 3, both DT1 and DT2 exhibit quite high Tgs of 257 and 241 °C, respectively, and no crystallization or endothermic peak are observed. These Tg values are significantly higher than those of the most widely used HTMs such as NPB (Tg = 95 °C) and TPD (Tg = 63 °C), and most other reported TPA derivatives,1 suggesting that DT1 and DT2 have the potential to realize high thermal and morphological stability for the improvement of device efficiency and lifetime, especially for those high-temperature requiring device applications.

Optical properties
To investigate their photophysical properties, the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescent (PL) spectra (Fig. 4) of DT1 and DT2 were measured in both dilute THF solutions and solid states with the characteristic data listed in Table 1. DT1 shows two absorption peaks in solution at 373 and 409 nm, corresponding to the π–π* electron transition of the exterior dendron and the exterior dendron to interior core, respectively. In contrast, there is an overlap between the above two transitions for DT2, and only one main absorption peak is observed at ∼396 nm. In terms of film absorption spectra, both exhibit qualitatively similar features to their solution spectra albeit with slight band broadening and red-shifts being attributed to the absence of aggregation in comparison to linear π-conjugated molecules.10 The PL spectra of the dendrimers in dilute THF solutions show quite similar PL behaviors: an emission peak at ∼460 nm with a narrow full width at half-emission maximum (fwhm) of ∼50 nm. However, both PL bands of the films are much broader with red-shifts compared to those in solution. In addition to the PL peak at 470 nm, a pronounced shoulder peak at longer wavelength (∼500 nm) can be observed in both film PL spectra unlike those in the solution PL spectra. This is possibly attributed to the enhanced vibronic splitting in the solid states.11d In solution, the relatively weak π–π stacking makes the shape of individual dendrimer molecules more broadened, thereby reducing vibronic splitting.

Interestingly, it is found that in comparison to DT1, DT2 shows a much sharper band as well as a reduced tail to long wavelength in both solid-state absorption and PL spectra. This should be due to their structural differences: the π-linkage modes between TPA units from the periphery into the core of DT1 are from C–C to CC to CC bonds, while those of DT2 are the opposite. The use of the CC bonds in conjugated molecules always allows them to adopt a more planar structure like a “pancake” that potentially gives very strong intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid state.20 Here, the CC bonds in the core may provide a much increased possibility to induce this “pancake-like’ structure than those in the periphery, therefore leading to an enhanced π–π stacking of DT1 in the solid state. To verify this, the variation of solution absorption spectra of dendrimers by the addition of a nonsolvent such as cyclohexane into the THF solutions was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S1,† when ∼60% cyclohexane was added, DT1 clearly showed an enhanced long wavelength shoulder peak in the absorption band, while for DT2, almost no change could be observed. This therefore suggests that DT1 is more likely to form intermolecular aggregates compared to DT2.
Electrochemistry properties
The oxidative electrochemical properties of the films were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, and the related data of the energy levels are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 5, the two dendrimers display irreversible oxidation peaks. However, two onset oxidation potentials (0.34 V and 0.47 V vs. Fc/Fc+) in the CV trace of DT1 were observed, while only one (0.42 V vs. Fc/Fc+) was observed for DT2. The highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of DT1 and DT2 were calculated based on the first oxidation potential, according to the following equation: EHOMO = −(Eonset(ox),FOC + 4.8) eV, and were −5.14 and −5.22 eV, respectively. Both values are comparable to that of NPB (HOMO, −5.2 eV), suggesting them as potential candidates for hole-injecting and transporting materials in OLEDs.4–6 Moreover, the optical band gap values (Eoptg) of DT1 and DT2, 2.56 and 2.62 eV, respectively, could be obtained from the lower energy onset of the thin film absorption spectra, which were further used to calculate their LUMO levels (∼2.6 eV).

Hole-transporting properties
The hole-transporting ability of dendrimers was investigated by fabricating multi-layer OLEDs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT (35 nm)/DT1 or DT2 (75 nm)/Alq3 (60 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). Thus the dendrimers were used as the hole-transporting layer (HTL) while Alq3 was the emitter and electron-transport layer (ETL). For comparison, a standard device with a similar structure but using NPB as the HTL was also prepared (Fig. S2†). The detailed data for the devices is summarized in Table 2. Both DT1 and DT2 can be processed through room-temperature solution spin-coating due to their good solubility and amorphous nature, which is one of critical factors allowing for roll-to-roll printing or coating on flexible plastic substrates to lead to light-weight, low-cost organic electronic devices, while NPB is fabricated through vacuum vapor decomposition.7

Unfortunately, we could not demonstrate a successful device using DT1 as the HTL (Fig. S3†). This is possibly due to the decreased optical transparency observed after forming a thin film on the top of the PEDOT layer, caused by its much stronger aggregation in the solid state as demonstrated in the photophysical results. On the contrary, when a bias potential was applied to the electrodes of the DT2-based Alq3 emitting device, it showed an identical electroluminescence (EL) peak at 539 nm to that from Alq3 (Fig. S4†). This fact strongly indicates that DT2 only serves as the HTM without causing exciplex formation at the interface with Alq3. The morphology of the thin films of DT2 obtained from spin-coating chloroform solution onto ITO substrates was then investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. S5,† the surface topographic image clearly suggests a smooth morphology with good coverage but no apparent crystal alignment.
The device characteristics are shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6A, the turn-on voltage of the device is 2.9 V, and the maximum of brightness achieves 5020 cd m−2 at ∼13 V with a maximum current density of ∼400 mA cm−2. Moreover, Fig. 6B demonstrates that the DT2-based device can produce a maximum current efficiency of 2.36 cd A−1, with a relatively high power efficiency of 2.40 lm W−1. As shown in Table 2, although the brightness and efficiency of the DT2-based device are lower than those of the standard NPB/Alq3 device, these results are still acceptable since the HTL derived from DT2 is obtained through solution processing, which often results in inferior performance to those of vapor-deposited devices.4–7 Furthermore, the merits of DT2 such as good solution-processability and high thermal stability are essential for practical OLED applications. Importantly, the device performance of the DT2-based device actually compares favorably to those reported for other TPA based oligomers or dendrimers such as TDABs.8,9,11 Further study using these dendrimers for other device applications such as HTMs for solar cells will be reported in due course.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple convergent approach has been reported to prepare two large bulky π-conjugated dendrimers DT1 and DT2 bearing up to 22 triphenylamine units. The effect of the different π-linkage modes from the periphery into the core on material properties was studied, which showed that the CC bonds in the core of the dendrimer result in an enhanced π–π molecular stacking compared with those in the periphery, and worsen the photophysical behaviors and film optical qualities. Both DT1 and DT2 exhibit very high thermal stabilities (Tgs over 240 °C) and high-lying HOMO energy levels (∼5.2 eV), making them feasible for hole-transporting applications. The Alq3 based multi-layer OLED device containing DT2 as the hole-transporting layer has been fabricated successfully through a facile solution process. It displays a bright green emission of 5020 cd m−2 at ∼13 V, and a maximum current efficiency of 2.36 cd A−1,11 suggesting that DT2 can be a promising candidate for a HTM in organic electronic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over and distilled from a K–Na alloy under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Triethylamine (Et3N) was distilled under normal pressure and kept over potassium hydroxide. All other reagents were used as received.
Instrumentation
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer or Bruker ARX 400 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as the internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra were measured on a Voyager-DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS; ABI, American) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser and a 1.2 m linear flight path in positive ion mode. Elemental analyses were performed by a CARLOERBA-1106 micro-elemental analyzer. UV-visible spectra were obtained using a Schimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. PL spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The thermal transitions were investigated using a METTLER differential scanning calorimeter DSC822e under nitrogen at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weights of polymers. GPC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system with a G1362A refractive index detector. Polystyrene standards were used as calibration standards for GPC. THF was used as an eluent and the flow rate was 1.0 mL min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on a CHI voltammetric analyzer in a three-electrode cell with a Pt counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a glassy carbon working electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (purchased from Alfa Aesar) as the supporting electrolyte, in anhydrous acetonitrile solution purged with nitrogen. The potential values obtained in reference to the Ag/Ag+ electrode were converted to values versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) by means of an internal ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/Fc) standard. SEM measurements were performed on a ZEISS-SIGMA scanning electron microscope.
Fabrication and characterization of OLEDs
The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with special detergent and deionized water. After cleaning, the substrates were baked at 120 °C for 20 min before O2 plasma treatment. A layer of 35 nm thick poly-(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, H.C.Stack, 4083) was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrates after a O2 plasma treatment, and baked at 120 °C for 30 min. Then, a 75 nm thick layer of DT1 or DT2 as the hole transporting layer (HTL) was spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and baked at 120 °C for 30 min. After that, the emitting layer of tris(8-hydroxyquinolino)-aluminium (Alq3) was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure <10−4 Pa. Lastly, a 1 nm thick layer of LiF and a 100 nm thick film of Al were thermally deposited as a cathode under vacuum. For comparison, NPB was also deposited by thermal evaporation as the HTL, using the same conditions. The thickness of the films deposited by thermal evaporation was monitored by the crystal thickness meter and the thickness of spin-coated films was measured by the terrace detector. The active area of the devices was 16 mm2 as determined by the cross breadth between the cathode and the ITO. The EL spectra were measured by the JY SPEX CCD3000 spectra. Steady current–luminance–voltage was measured by a Keithley 2400 Source meter and a Keithley 2000 Source multi-meter equipped with a calibrated silicon photodiode. All tests were performed under an air atmosphere and at room temperature.

Synthesis of dendrimer DT1
A mixture of compound 5 (160 mg, 0.085 mmol), compound 9 (8.2 mg, 0.026 mmol), CuI (1.5 mg, 0.008 mmol), PPh3 (3 mg, 0.011 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (3 mg, 0.003 mmol) was carefully degassed and charged with nitrogen three times. THF (15 mL)/Et3N (3 mL) was then added. The reaction was stirred for 4 days at room temperature. The mixture was extracted with CHCl3, washed with water, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using chloroform/petroleum ether (2/1) as eluent to afford yellow solid DT1 (71 mg, 49.0%). Mw = 8600, Mw/Mn = 1.05 (GPC, polystyrene calibration). 1H NMR (400 M Hz, CDCl3, 298 K) δ (ppm): 7.0–7.2 (ArH), 7.29 (ArH), 7.42–7.51 (ArH). 13C NMR (125 M Hz, CDCl3, 298 K) δ (ppm): 122.86, 124.05, 124.34, 127.34, 129.27, 144.70.
