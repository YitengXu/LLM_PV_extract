1. Introduction
Solar cells (photovoltaic cells) have attracted the most attention among the several different energy conversion technologies around the world. Photovoltaics have the potential to harvest clean and renewable energy from solar radiation. In photovoltaic energy conversion, the most challenging and difficult part is achieving a significant improvement of the power conversion efficiency. Traditional wafer-based silicon solar cells still dominate the solar cell commercial market, due to silicon being an earth-abundant material and offering higher efficiency and superior stability in comparison with other energy resources.1,2 However, higher efficiencies in wafer-based solar cell production have elevated the production costs.3–5 Therefore, different materials and advanced fabrication processes for photovoltaic cell development have received increasing attention over the last few decades.6 In recent times, organic, inorganic, hybrid (organic/silicon) and two-dimensional (2D) materials-based solar cells have received a great deal of research interest, due to the possibilities for a lower usage of material, fabrication at room temperature and band structure adjustment at the nano-scale.7,8 However, device stability is still up in the air and the main obstacle limiting their wider practical applications.9,10
Nature is rich in carbon (C) as well as silicon materials. The flexibility to change the crystal structure or size of carbon nanomaterials at the nano-scale can significantly aid researchers to tune the electrical and optical properties of carbon materials. Intensive research has consequently been done on a variety of carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, carbon nanofibres, and other carbon-related materials, such as, amorphous carbon (a-C).11–15 Recently in photovoltaic devices, graphene/Si heterojunction solar cells have attracted a lot of interest as such heterojunctions have an atomically thin crystal structure with a honeycomb lattice shape containing carbon atoms, which makes the structure more conductive, while also having a high carrier mobility, low optical absorption and good thermal stability. Graphene as a 2D sheet was first reported in 2004, obtained by the mechanical exfoliation of graphite.16,17 Right after the addition of 2D graphene in the family of carbon nanomaterials, an increased interest in research into graphene/Si solar cells was observed globally. This has led to enhanced studies in the fundamentals of Gr/Si interfaces. In 2004, the first Gr/Si heterojunction solar cell was fabricated, while later cell fabrication at room temperature was achieved by simply transferring the graphene onto an n-silicon wafer, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.5% achieved in 2010.18 Li et al. described a new kind of graphene called flower-like graphene nano-whiskers. It was found that such a kind of shape could be obtained by adding the nitrogen element during the crystal growth in CVD. The PCE of flower-like graphene nano-whiskers was 1%.19 Graphene has tremendous electronic and optical properties, which makes it a good potential candidate for fabricating graphene/Si heterojunction solar cells, with such devices achieving 15% efficiency in less than a decade of development.20
Graphene in solar cells has multiple roles, due to it being highly transparent with a high charge mobility and is thus used as an alternate to transparent electrodes, e.g. ITO, FTO.21 At the same time, it creates a built-in electric field at the Gr/Si interface, which helps to collect the photogenerated charge carriers. Still, graphene is not a mature technology for mass production in solar panels yet. Because graphene fabrication involves a solution process, which creates lattice defects and grain boundaries, which reduce the conductivity of the graphene layer. Graphene to be used for solar cell applications on a mass production scale thus requires further investigation. One effective way to support the production of graphene on a large scale is through the thermal decomposition of silicon carbide22 and by using plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD).23 Additionally, it is difficult to replace graphene with silicon because of its zero band gap, but it is necessary for photo-active materials to have a band gap. Though, recently it was also reported that chemical doping could change the band gap of graphene and increased it to 1.2 eV.24,25
Kim et al. reported a simple p:n junction solar cell using Gr without silicon as a base material.26 However, research on the endless possibilities of graphene in silicon-based solar cells is still in progress to improve the cell performance. Solar cells have various industrial applications, including solar-powered cars, planes and boats, and for providing power in remote locations, e.g. offshore navigation systems, small villages, telecommunication systems in space and for satellite systems. Other than silicon-based materials, graphene is widely used in organic photovoltaic devices for many applications, such as in wearable electronics in clothes, home windows, curtains, etc.
In this article, we review in detail the latest research work based on graphene/Si heterojunction solar cells. The synthesis of graphene using the CVD process is first considered and the graphene/Si junction for photovoltaic applications discussed in detail. One of the principal parts of this study is to highlight the surface modification of graphene layers and the role of an interfacial layer between graphene and silicon. Finally, developments in Gr/Si fabrication technologies along with the future scope for fabricating high-performance graphene/Si heterojunction solar cells is discussed.
2. Synthesis of high-quality graphene
Initially, the micromechanical exfoliation of graphite led to the discovery of graphene. However, for its industrial application, it is important to develop methods for the synthesis of high-quality graphene on a large scale. Since it was first discovered, various methods have been developed for the synthesis of graphene, such as chemical vapour deposition,27–29 plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD)30,31 and the thermal decomposition of SiC.32 The most common and inexpensive method for the deposition of graphene is by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on transition metals, e.g. Ru,33 Ir,34 Cu,29 h-BN,35 Ni,36 Pt,39 Pd.37 In the case of photovoltaic applications, the use of a single layer of graphene on copper foils on large areas has received more attention towards high-efficiency solar cells. However, the technology for depositing graphene on Cu foil is relatively new, albeit several groups have already reported excellent device properties, such as mobility at room temperature and the growth of graphene in a large area of up to 30 inches.30 Such graphene has a low sheet resistance of 125 Ohm sq−1 and high optical transmittance of ∼98%, which suggests it is well suited to photovoltaic applications.
The growth of graphene on Cu foil using CVD is a fairly straightforward process, as shown in Fig. 1. Graphene growth is done on a copper substrate placed in a thermal reactor at a temperature of 1000 °C. Initially, the substrate was annealed in a hydrogen environment. Afterwards, a mixture of H2/CH4 was introduced into the reactor for the growth of graphene. After the continuous growth of a graphene layer on the Cu substrate or foil, the thermal reactor was left to cool down to room temperature.29 During the growth, hydrocarbon species catalytically decompose on the Cu surface. After the first layer of graphene is laid, the Cu substrate is fully covered with graphene and then no catalyst is exposed to promote the growth of graphene. Thus, this also shows that the growth of graphene on the Cu substrate is self-limiting and produces a high quality result.40 Different research groups have tried different graphene shapes by varying the growth parameters, such as the growth pressure and gas concentration.41–44 Graphene must be transferred for use in a photovoltaic application by removing the metal substrates using during the chemical etching.45 Afterwards, graphene can be transferred onto the desired substrate. For this, first the PMMA was coated and baked at around 100 °C for a few minutes. The Cu substrate was then etched away using a Cu etchant, with FeCl3 being the most widely used for etching the Cu substrate.46,47 After this, the PMMA coating on graphene remains behind, and the PMMA/Gr is cleaned with DI water and transferred onto the substrate. Finally, the PMMA is removed with acetone, to leave only graphene remaining on top of the silicon substrate.
 Fig. 1  Process flow of graphene growth on copper foil and its transfer process on an insulator layer. First, Gr growth was done on Cu foil by using CH4 and H2 at 1000 °C in CVD, then after completion of mono-layer graphene, PMMA was coated on the top surface of graphene and the Cu foil was etched by using wet chemical etching. Finally, Gr was transferred onto the desired substrate. 
The above-mentioned process of transferring graphene is mostly used in the case of Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells. Due to the natural properties of graphene, including it being highly conductive (hundreds of Ohm sq−1 to kOhm sq−1), opaque and flexibile, it is more attractive for transparent electrodes and for making Schottky junction solar cells. In solar cells, indium tin oxide (ITO) is often used as a transparent electrode, due to its low sheet resistance (∼25 Ohm sq−1) and high transparency. However, there are some limitations on the use of ITO, due to its low mechanical flexibility and it being naturally brittle.48,49 The conductivity and transparency of graphene can be controlled during the growth process. It was observed that conductivity increases with increasing the number of graphene layers, but on the contrary, the transparency is decreased by the stacking of graphene layers. However, a lower sheet resistance was observed for few-layer graphene of few Ohms (∼100 Ohms sq−1), while for single-layer graphene a different sheet resistance was observed, ranging from (1 kOhm sq−1 to 3 kOhm sq−1).38,50 Therefore, tuning both parameters, i.e. the conductivity and transparency, in solar cells can lead to a higher efficiency being obtained.
Working principal
A junction between the same materials is a homojunction, while that between two different materials, owing to their different properties, is a heterojunction. Materials like metals, semiconductors and insulators can be differentiated mainly by their conductivities. However, these conductivities depend upon the structures of the valence band and conduction band. If the bottom edge of the conduction band and the top edge of the valence band meet at the Fermi level, that material belongs to the class of zero gap semiconductors or semi-metals.51,52 Two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb graphene is a zero-band-gap semiconductor and has extremely high electron mobility 200000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 2–4 times larger than that of silicon and other semiconductors.53 The band gap of graphene can be controlled by electric field or doping treatments. Recently, a 250 meV band gap was demonstrated by a bilayer graphene.54 In such a scenario with inducing this band gap in graphene, using such a graphene will always induce a potential barrier, which leads to creating a heterojunction. On the other hand, when the thickness of graphene is increased, its band gap becomes zero.51 Additionally, it becomes more conductive and there is the chance of the formation of a Schottky junction with semiconductors. Similarly, when the number of layers of graphene is decreased, a distinct band gap can be generated.51 As explained, the band gap of graphene can be tuned from a semiconductor to a semi-metal, dependent on its inherent physical and electronic properties. When zero-band-gap graphene (semi-metal) coincides with different semiconductor materials, it makes a Schottky junction.55,56 Similarly, when graphene with a band gap is joined with different semiconductor materials, it forms a heterojunction at the interface. However, generally, when two different materials make contact, the chemical potentials of both materials adjust their common position to form a heterojunction.57,58 In light of the above discussion, for Gr/Si-based solar cells, researchers have presented both the heterojunction and Schottky junction phenomena. Moreover, the conductivity of graphene can be increase by chemical doping or by increasing the number of layers. This helps to change the work function of graphene, which tends to enhance the electric field and improve the collection of photogenerated carriers at the Gr/Si interface.59 It is very important to choose the optimum number of graphene layers so as not to affect the sheet resistance and transmittance for solar cell applications.59,60 A schematic diagram of zero-band-gap semiconductor graphene/silicon and its energy band diagram are shown in Fig. 2. Due to the difference in the work function of graphene and the n-type semiconductor, built-in potential is created at the interface of graphene and silicon. This built-in potential across the interface of Gr/Si helps to split the electrons and holes that are generated by the incident light, which can thus be efficiently converted to electrical energy. When the light incident on the semiconductor side and its photon energy hν is greater than the semiconductor Eg value, electron (red)–hole (yellow) pairs are generated in the semiconductor. Holes will accelerate towards the graphene side and electrons towards the n-type silicon, and similarly on the graphene side, if hν is greater than ∅B and less than Eg, photogenerated charge carriers will be generated, and holes will be collected by graphene and electrons will gain enough energy to cross the barrier and flow into the semiconductor. This charge carrier separation phenomenon is due to the high electric field at the interface of Gr/Si solar cells. In Gr/Si solar cells, more light will pass through the Schottky transparent electrode and generate charge carriers (electrons and holes) in the semiconductor, this helps to enhance the conversion of optical to electrical energy.61

3. Graphene/silicon photovoltaic devices
Two-dimensional (2D) graphene has great potential for future solar cells. After the discovering of 2D carbon atomic layers in 2004,16 the first Gr/Si Schottky junction-based solar cell was fabricated in 2010, with an efficiency of 1.65%.18 Because of its remarkable electrical and optical properties, Gr/Si Schottky junction solar cells reached up to 15% efficiency within less than a decade.20 The electron mobility of such a junction is a hundred times more than silicon, which is about 2.5 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1.62,63 Graphene is a zero-band-gap semiconductor, which leads to absorbing light in a wide spectrum and the electrons can move several micrometres without scattering within the graphene material.64 Gr/Si-based Schottky junction solar cells are also favourable for the separation of charge carriers because of their large built-in potential. In Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells, graphene serves as an active layer for photogenerated charge carriers separation and also as a transparent electrode.65,66 Naturally, graphene is a hole transporter in Gr/Si solar cells. The first such solar cell was fabricated by employing a graphene emitter layer on top of silicon.18 These Gr/Si solar cells had an issue of having a higher sheet resistance (a few kOhms) for the grapheme layer, which tended to disturb its conductivity. This also resisted the photogenerated current in Gr/Si solar cells, which lowered the PCE drastically. To resolve this issue, researchers introduced chemical doping in the graphene layer as well as using multilayers of graphene to improve its conductivity. The method involving the introduction of chemical doping on the top surface of graphene was investigated initially. In this method, chemical doping was achieved by introducing p-type dopants in to graphene. The commonly used dopants applied in Gr/Si solar cells were TFSA and HNO3.9,67 Xiaochang Miao et al. introduced a TFSA layer and reported the highest enhancement in Gr/Si solar cell efficiency (1.9% to 8.6%), by using doping. Several other dopants were introduced by different research groups, including boron doping68 and doping using chemicals like HNO3, SOCl2, H2O2 and HCL.69,70 This methodology of coating the top surface of graphene using any dopant was really helpful for researchers to reduce the resistance of graphene, and apparently it was also able to overcome the issue of high resistance. With all the advantages of chemical doping, one major drawback is its instability in the atmosphere, which causes surface degradation and ultimately brings the efficiency of the cell back to its original value. Recently, graphene oxide71 and Pt nanoparticles72 were used as p-type dopants on the top surface of Gr/Si solar cells. In a later section, we discuss the use of doping on graphene by different research groups. The second way to enhance the conductivity of these Gr/Si solar cells is by using stacks of multi-layer graphene. Xinming Li et al.73 suggested that multi-layer graphene can efficiently reduce the resistance. They demonstrated an up to 5-layer-graphene-based solar cell. They also suggested that multi-layer graphene makes a proper junction as compared to single-layer graphene and suppresses the recombination process across the Gr/Si junction. It was also observed and reported that there should be an optimal number of graphene layers as multi-layer graphene affects the transparency. Single-layer graphene has a transparency up to 97% in the visible region, which drops down to 85% in the case of 5-layer graphene. So, in such a case of multiple graphene layers, both factors should be considered, i.e. the resistance and transparency.
The reduction in transparency tends to enhance the loss of incident light on the top surface of the Gr/Si solar cell. In this regard, surface treatment can be performed to reduce the loss of incident light. Different surface treatments were done, such as using silicon nano-wire arrays74 and nano- and micro-holes.75 Enzheng Shi et al.76 demonstrated colloidal TiO2 as an anti-reflection coating (ARC), which has been proven to be the most effective anti-reflection coating for Gr/Si solar cells. TiO2 coating and chemical doping by HNO3 both help to enhance the PCE of Gr/Si solar cells up to 14.5%. This coating not only enhances the PCE, but also helps to stabilize these cells in air for a long time, which is a problem, as previously stated, with chemical doping. Along with TiO2, different organic materials have been introduced as anti-reflection coatings, including PMMA77 and fluoropolymer (CYTOP).78 More recently, CYTOP was introduced as an anti-reflection coating, which also helps in the stability of HNO3-doped graphene. ARC will be discussed further in detail in the anti-reflection section. The third and final important factor in Gr/Si-based solar cells is the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Voc is one of the most important factors in photovoltaic devices, as we know that Gr/Si make a Schottky junction due to the semi-metal behaviour of graphene. The value of Voc of Gr/Si solar cells is in the range of 0.4 V to 0.5 V. One way to enhance the Voc and reduce the recombination processes is by inserting an insulating layer into the Gr/Si interface. This structure is mainly known as a metal insulating semiconductor (MIS). Several interfacial layers have been introduced to date, which are discussed in the interfacial layer section of the manuscript. This interfacial layer not only lowers the recombination process but also enhances Voc up to 0.6 V. The highest efficiency achieved for Gr/Si solar cell was achieved by introducing a native oxide at the interface of graphene and silicon.79 Recently, interfacial layers were introduced that could act as hole transport layers, showing very promising results. These hole transport layers include MoOx,80 GQDs81 and spiro-OMeTAD.82 Perhaps the main advantage of all these parameters is that these processes are low-temperature processes. However, with the help of varying all these parameters Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells’ efficiency has been raised to 15.6%20 from 1.65%.18 It was also noticed that the sheet resistance of single-layer graphene can vary, which may be due to the growth conditions and the transfer method of depositing graphene on the silicon substrate. Although some researchers have suggested few-layer graphene on silicon is more appropriate rather than single-layer graphene for making solar cells.73 However, the maximum efficiency achieved on Gr/Si junction solar cells was achieved on a single layer.20Fig. 3 shows a schematic illustration of Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells using different interfacial layers, doping and anti-reflection coatings. Table 1 shows the major selected Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells from 2010 to early 2017.

4. Doping of graphene
Pristine single-layer Gr/Si and few-layer Gr/Si solar cells’ efficiency now reach up to 6% and 9%, respectively.81,83 However, their high sheet resistance can affect their electrical properties. As we know, their work function can be tuned, which helps to extract or separates the charge carriers in Gr/Si solar cells, e.g. by using p-type chemical doping on the graphene84 polymers,67,85 Au nanoparticles,86 Ag nanoparticles,87 Pt cubic nanoparticles72 and others,10,70 which helps significantly increase the performance of solar cells. Feng et al. reported chemical doping by using the HNO3 using a vapour process, and reported that HNO3 doping could enhance the work function of graphene and increase the cell performance of a Gr/Si solar cell to 4.35% from 2.90%.88 Cui et al. described molecular doping with four different volatile oxidants, namely HnO3, HCl, H2O2 and SOCl2. The best improvement in Gr/Si solar cell was achieved by doping with SOCl2, with a PCE enhancement from 2.45% to 5.95%. They also test the stability of these chemical doped solar cells and concluded that SOCl2- and HCl-treated solar cells have much better stability in air.9 These chemical doping methods help to reduce the sheet resistance and improve the Schottky barrier, which lead to efficient charge separation. Besides, electrolyte solutions were also prepared for doping. Yu et al. reported electric field doping using ferro-magnetic materials, P(VDF–TrFE). The main advantage of this material is that it can maintain long-term polarization after applying an electric field. The PCE was enhanced from 2% to 4.14%.10 Li et al. reported two different electrolyte solutions based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA + HNO3 and PVA + H3PO4). Also for graphene growth, copper mesh fabric was used. The PCE was increased from 6.43% to 11% after PVA + HNO3 doping.89
Another effective way to increase the carrier density and built-in potential is by spin-coating a layer of bis-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amide (TFSA) onto Gr/Si.67,85 Due to TFSA doping, the sheet resistance is decreased and work function enhanced. As a result, the PCE is enhanced from 3.3% to 9.5%.85
Adding nanoparticles is another way to tune the work function of graphene. Au nanoparticles contribute p-type doping on graphene. Several groups have applied Au nanoparticles.86,90 Liu et al. applied different sizes of Au nanoparticles doping on graphene. After Au nanoparticles doping, the PCE was enhanced from 3.93% to 7.36%. It was further increased to 10.20% by combining it with HNO3.86 Ho et al. introduced a novel approach to filling out the cracks using Au nanoparticles in graphene, where those cracks were introduced into graphene during the cooling down process because of the different thermal expansion coefficients between the Cu substrate and graphene. Such defects are inevitable during the growth of graphene and result from the reduction–oxidation process between the Cu substrate and HAuCl4 solution. Due to the filling out of the self-cracked graphene by Au nanoparticles, the PCE was increased from 3.3% to 7.8%, and then it was further increased to 12.3 by TFSA doping.85 Zhe Kang et al. demonstrated doping on graphene woven fabrics (GWF) using the self-deposition of Pt nanoparticles. A combination of Pt nanoparticles and a solid electrolyte coating on GWF solar cells enabled the PCE of the GWF solar cell to reach up to 10%. This study showed a unique way to deposit Pt nanoparticles by combining a photo-assisted method and the electrochemical deposition method. This process helped avoid the use of the complex deposition method of Pt nanoparticles and also reduced the defects on Pt–GWF.91 Tongxiang Cui et al. synthesized N-doped carbon films (N-CFMs) by using acetonitrile (CH3CN) as liquid carbon. It was observed that with decreasing the amount of acetonitrile, the transmittance and sheet resistance increased. 1.55% efficiency was achieved with the N-CFM/n-Si solar cell structure, with values of Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.438 V, 11.26 mA cm−2 and 31.4%, respectively.92
5. Interface passivation
Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells have achieved a PCE of up to 10% after the surface modification of graphene. The low barrier height and recombination along the interface are responsible for the low PCE of Gr/Si solar cells. When an interfacial layer is introduced between graphene and silicon, it suppresses the recombination process on the surface of silicon, which also helps the holes to transfer in graphene layer through tunnelling processes. This helps to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and causes an increase in the PCE of solar cells.
Several materials have been used for interfacial layers by researchers, who are still searching for more. Native oxide,20 graphene oxide,93 quantum dots,81 conductive polymer,94 fluorine-based graphene and nitrides83,90 have been used in Gr/Si solar cells. An electron blocking layer by using an organic material was demonstrated by different research groups. Zhang et al. and Xie et al.94,95 introduced the P3HT layer as an electron blocking layer. Because of the low barrier height, which leads to a large leakage current and also a reverse dark saturation current, different layer thicknesses were tested for achieving the best performance for Gr/Si solar cells to reduce the surface recombination. The best performance was achieved with a 10 nm layer thickness of P3HT, while for further optimization, multilayers graphene were used in the following Gr/Si solar cells. A further increase in the layer thickness of P3HT reduced the current and this caused degradation of the performance of the solar cells. The P3HT thin layer helped to enhance the efficiency up to 9%.
Jiao et al. and Yang et al.93,96 used graphene oxide as an interfacial layer to enhance the performance of the solar cell. Graphene oxide was sandwiched between graphene and silicon wafers, fabricated by the spin-coating method. Jiao et al. used different annealing temperatures for enhancing the GO film characteristics. They demonstrated that annealing the GO films up to 400 °C showed the best performance in terms of the solar cell PCE. Initially, by introducing the GO film, the PCE decreased from 2.13% to 0.2%, but after further annealing up to 400 °C, the efficiency increased to up to 5.2%.
Zhong et al.83 introduced fluorographene (FG), which is a new kind of graphene (Fig. 4(a)). It can be fabricated by exposing the graphene in fluoride gas. Fluorographene acts as a very thin insulating layer. F atoms in FG act as electron acceptors and can enable obtaining p-type doping in Gr/FG heterostructures. The authors fabricated a metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) structure using a Gr/FG/Si solar cell, in which they proposed a one-step approach for doping and for introducing the interfacial layer. The PCE of a conventional Gr/Si cell in the following study was 3.17%. By contrast, by introducing a thin FG insulating layer, Voc, Jsc and FF were enhanced to 0.4 V, 27.1 mA cm−2 and 63% from 0.35 V, 25.3 mA cm−2 and 35.7%, respectively (Fig. 4(b)). As a result, the PCE was enhanced upto 7.52%. Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the improvement in the ideality factor and barrier height with the layer of FG. Also, the minority-carrier lifetime was also increased from 16.2 μs to 20 μs (Fig. 4(e)). Further, passivation with PMMA and chemical doping of the Gr/FG/Si solar cell led to a performance enhancement to 13.38% (Fig. 4(f)–(h)).

To reduce the surface recombination along the Gr/Si interface, Meng et al.90 introduced boron nitride (h-BN), which helped reduce the surface recombination and also provided benefits as a hole transport layer. A few layers of h-BN were transferred onto a silicon substrate and afterwards, graphene was transferred. h-BN also helped to enhance the conductivity of graphene. The Gr/SiO2/Si sheet resistance was 305 Ohm sq−1, which was reduced to 212 Ohm sq−1 after incorporating the h-BN layer. The PCE was improved from 2.80% to 3.61%, and then further by using Au nanoparticles and HnO3 doping, reaching up to 10.93%.
As mentioned above the role of native oxide can also have an impact on the PCE of Gr/Si solar cells. The maximum efficiency of a Gr/Si solar cell by using native oxide at the interface of Gr/Si has been achieved to date by Song et al.,20 who studied different layer thicknesses of native oxide. Native oxide was grown after HF treatment of the silicon substrate and placing that substrate in air. A 0.5 nm layer was grown immediately after HF treatment. After two weeks, the film layer thickness reached up to 1.5 nm. After optimization of the native oxide layer thickness to 1.5 nm and with TiO2 anti-reflection coating, a record PCE of 15.6% was achieved with a Gr/Si solar cell.
Similarly, Diao et al.81 used graphene quantum dots (QDs) at the interface of Gr/Si. Different sizes of QDs were prepared, ranging from 6 nm to 12 nm. Further, by using the same GQDs sizes, different layer thicknesses of GQDs were fabricated as an interfacial layer between graphene and silicon, with the layer thicknesses ranging from 8 nm to 50 nm. The best PCE was achieved with a 20 nm layer thickness for 3–6 nm sized GQDs. After introducing the GQDs layer, the PCE reached up to 10.67% from 4.24%, and after further doping, it reached up to 12.35%.
6. Anti-reflection coating and texturing for light trapping
The planar Si surface has a high reflectivity of about 30–40% in the visible range. Different methods can reduce this, such as the use of pyramids,2,99 nanowires100 and random texturing.66,101 In the conventional C–Si solar cell, one way to reduce the reflectance is by texturing the top surface102 and by deposition of a thin film on the surface of Si solar cells as an anti-reflection coating.103 Texturing can be done by chemical etching or dry etching. For Gr/Si solar cells, researchers have fabricated different kinds of nano- and microstructures for light trapping. Feng et al.66 and Xie et al.75 fabricate different kinds of texturing surface, which helped to enhance the PCEs of Gr/Si solar cells. Feng et al. reported some silicon pillar arrays, which were fabricated by using plasma etching (ICP). The pillar height was controlled by the etching time. Using silicon pillar arrays, they were able to enhance the efficiency from 1.65%, which was recorded in a planar Gr/Si solar array, to 1.96%, and then after HnO3 treatment, it even reached to 3.55%. Similarly, Xie et al. fabricated microarrays using RIE plasma. Different depth sizes of microarrays were fabricated, ranging from 3.8 μm to 12.8 μm. The maximum efficiency they achieved was with a 12.8 μm depth. The final PCE achieved using silicon microarrays and AuCl3 doping was 10.4%.75
Xie et al. and Fan et al.100,101 used nanostructures of silicon for light trapping. These nanostructures were prepared by a Ag-assisted etching method from n-Si wafers, and afterwards the graphene layer was transferred onto the surface of these Si nanostructures, making the complete structure of the solar cells. These structures could reduce the light reflectance, also helping to increase the minority-carrier lifetime.
Many researchers have discussed the application of anti-reflection coatings using PMMA,104 PDMS,105 TiO2,97 MoOx106 and GO.71 Yavuz et al.71 used graphene oxide as an anti-reflection coating and as a p-type doping on Gr/Si solar cells (Fig. 5(a) and (b)). GO was prepared in DI water, and afterwards, GO solution was dispersed using a spin-coating method. The PCE of bare Gr/Si solar cell was observed, which was about 3.6%, while after GO film coating it was increased almost 3 times, reaching up to 10.6% (Fig. 5(d) and (e)). They proposed that the effect of the GO film arises because of two main factors: first, the GO films doping on a Gr layer increases the conductivity of the Gr layer, and second, the GO films act as anti-reflection coatings; this effect was also observed in the Rs and EQE spectra (Fig. 5(c) and (f)). This study also showed the stability of the GO/Gr/Si cell structure for 20 days without any vacuum, where the degradation in PCE was less than 1%. Xin Gan et al. fabricated a Gr/Si Schottky junction solar cell by using an anti-reflection coating with PMMA. They introduced a novel strategy of polymer-coating graphene as an ARC. In this work, PMMA was not removed after being transferred onto the silicon substrate. With HNO3 doping and PMMA coating, the PCE reached up to 13.34%. They also studied the HNO3 stability by using fluoropolymer (CYTOP) coating on graphene, whereby the PCE of CYTOP-coated graphene after HNO3 doping reached upto 11.39%. They suggested that the CYTOP-coated graphene solar cell is more stable compared to PMMA. They also compared polymer ARC coating with TiO2 colloids. The TiO2-coated solar cells showed a 1% lower efficiency compared to PMMA-coated solar cells.107 Also, Jiao et al.77 presented PMMA as an anti-reflection coating on Gr/Si solar cells. In this work, they did not remove the PMMA from the graphene layer and instead transferred the PMMA/Gr layer onto a silicon substrate, which acted as an anti-reflection coating, where the film thickness of PMMA was about 80 nm. The PCE was increased from 4.9% to 7.5%, and by using a bilayer of graphene it further reached up to 8.9%. Similarly, Shi et al.97 used TiO2 nanoparticles as an anti-reflection coating on Gr/Si-based solar cells. The TiO2 solutions were spin-coated on a Gr/Si solar cell with a film thickness of about 50–80 nm. The PCE of the bare G–Si solar cell was 3.78%, but increased up to 8.91% after HNO3 doping. It was further enhanced after the anti-reflection coating of TiO2 film to 14.5%.

7. Challenges and prospects
Graphene-based Schottky junction solar cells are one of the major hot topics over the last decade in the field of photovoltaic devices, due to their unique electrical and optical properties. Graphene as a carbon-based material has some inherently useful properties, such as it is easy to fabricate compared to other photovoltaic devices and it has low cost, which can help to reduce the cost of conventional silicon-based solar cells. Second, it has great potential in flexible devices. Nowadays, many researchers are trying to find the ideal path towards its industrial and practical application. Graphene-based silicon heterojunction solar cells seem very promising for industrial application. However, there are still many difficulties and challenges in this specific area. We discuss some of these here.
As we discussed earlier, the sheet resistance of a single layer is in the order of kOhm sq−1, but as we increase the number of layers of graphene, the sheet resistance is reduced, but at the same time, its transparency is also decreased. So, it is necessary to optimize the sheet resistance by using the optimum number of graphene layers without losing the transparency.
The PCE of Gr/Si solar cells has reached up to 15% in just a few years. Currently, these devices are not favourable for industrial application because the active area of Gr/Si solar cells is too small. Song et al.20 fabricated a Gr/Si solar cell with a PCE of 15% and with an active area of 0.1 cm2. Similarly, Xie et al.95 fabricated Gr/Si solar cells with different device areas. The results showed that the PCE of Gr/Si was 10.56% with an active area of 4 mm2, but it decreased to 3.62% at 100 mm2. This was because of the series resistance, which directly affects the performance of solar cells in a large area scale. This result shows that the performance of the solar cell is directly proportional to the active area of the solar cell. With the help of interface engineering, Gr/Si solar cells currently now can achieve a PCE of just above 7% with a device area of about 0.09 cm2.83 It is necessary to increase the active area to at least above 0.1 cm2. However, Wenjing Xu et al. demonstrated a large-area CNT–Si solar cell up till now with a PCE of 10% with an area of 2 cm2. The combination of CNT films and CNT strips caused the enhancement of the PCE upto to 10% on such a large area. These results represent one more step forwards towards commercial applications.108
Another big issue is the stability of these graphene-based solar cells. The performance of these solar cells starts degrading with the passage of time, especially in the case of after doping treatment. Several researchers have investigated the stability during storage of Gr/Si solar cells and have also tried to find ways to control the degradation. Xie et al.75 reported results after different time intervals, where the PCE of a Gr/Si solar cell dropped down from 10.40% to 7.42% within 3 months. Initially, chemical doping on graphene shows a drastic degradation of Gr/Si solar cells. Recently graphene oxide showed some stability in terms of the PCE.71,96 Yavuz et al.71 reported some stability results whereby after 3 weeks, the degradation in PCE was less than 1%. However, it is clear that further studies are needed regarding the stability under different parameters, such as temperature and humidity. The final issue is the quality of Gr/Si solar cells. The PCE in Gr/Si solar cells is not uniform. Li et al.89 showed PCE ranges of 3.57% to 5.28%. This showed that for a number of samples, the PCE was not constant, even after doping. So, for commercial and for practical applications, the quality needs to be maintained.
8. Future activities
In reference to all the previous discussions and results, Gr/Si heterojunction solar cells have great potential in future photovoltaic devices. In silicon-based solar cell, the top electrode design is very important to collect the photogenerated charge carriers. In Gr/Si solar cells, most of the designs are windows based. Recently, Jieran Fang et al.109 demonstrated the gold fractal metasurface design in graphene-based photodetectors. Such a kind of design could be adopted for graphene-based silicon solar cells for the efficient collection of photogenerated charge carriers. This might also help improve the efficiency of solar cells. Similarly, top surface passivation with an anti-reflection coating, such as TiO2 and PMMA, has mostly been reported. Al2O3 is another good alternative though, which has shown promising results recently on other 2D material, e.g. MOS2,110 for top passivation, which were deposited using the ALD technique. Similarly, Al2O3 and other oxides, including SiO2, which are mainly used in C–Si solar cells, can be deposited using the ALD technique, are have also been used on graphene for surface passivation. Additionally, surface texturing is one way to achieve light trapping in silicon-based solar cells. Reports have also suggested using silicon nanoarrays and microarrays. Moreover, silicon pyramid texturing in the micron size99 along with different designs of the top electrode can be applied to reduce the light loss. Beside the Gr/Si solar cells, cells could be fabricated along with other semiconductor and 2D materials. This would create a possibility to enhance the overall PCE of Gr/Si solar cells. In recent years, semiconductor materials, such as perovskite111 and CdSe,112 have shown promising results towards photovoltaic devices due to their wide range of electrical and optical properties. More research work can be done on these materials along with graphene for making more efficient and low cost solar cells. A combination of 2D materials with graphene opens an opportunity for thin, flexible and efficient photovoltaic devices.113–116 Yuka Tsuboi et al.117 demonstrated a mono-layer Gr/MoS2/n-Si solar cell. The PCE of such a device was upto 11%. Similarly, Shanmugam et al.118 achieved a PCE of 3.3% by using graphene/WS2 solar cells. Similarly, Lee et al.119 demonstrated WSe2- and MoS2-based solar cells using graphene as a top and bottom electrode. They investigated the photovoltaic effect on the Gr/WSe2/MoS2/Gr structure. The external quantum efficiency they achieved was 34%. These result show the potential of graphene along with 2D materials for achieving high-efficiency solar cells by using atomically thin layers. Moreover, 2D graphene has not only successfully been employed in solar cells, but also in other applications, e.g. sensors and photodetectors.120,121 As we discussed earlier, graphene helps in charge carrier separation, and recently it has shown promising results in applications such as in sensors and photodetectors.120,122 Graphene-based photodetectors have exhibited excellent results in terms of stability and photoresponsivity. These photodetectors also have important implications towards mass production devices for applications such as in biological imaging, remote control and other communication systems. Materials including silicon (III & V) are not cost effective or nature friendly. Because of graphene's optical and electronic unique properties and long-term stability, this enables the absorption of the light in a wide energy spectrum from UV to the IR region,123,124 which would help to develop short wavelength infrared with high responsivity photodetectors,125 broad band and ultra-fast photodetectors126 and the integration of CMOS technology with photodetectors based on graphene.127,128 Miao Zhu et al. demonstrated a RGO/Si-based gas detection Schottky diode. These devices were tested to detect the following gases: CH4, O2, CO, NO2, NO and SO2. Their results showed that in RGO/Si sensors, the oxygen functional groups (OFGs) play an important role in gas detection. The results showed much better results in the detection of NO2 and NO gases.129 Similarly, graphene showed also very promising results in photodetectors.130,131 Zefeng Chen et al. reported recently short-wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors with a record responsivity of 83 A W−1 by using plasmonic Au NPs at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Also, their rising time was less than 600 ns, which is also the fastest response achieved to date in these kind of photodetectors.132 TiO2 nanoparticles were also used by Zhu et al. in photodetectors. Their results showed that the conversion efficiency of TiO2-coated photodetectors was increased by 72.7% and 100% at 420 nm and 350 nm, respectively.133
9. Conclusion
In this review, we highlighted the recent developments in graphene-based Schottky junction solar cells. Due to researchers persistent efforts, the PCE has increased for Gr/Si solar cells from 1.65% to 15% in less than a decade, with further improvements expected in the future. Here, some key highlights for the synthesis of graphene as an active emitter by using CVD have been given. The effects of chemical doping on graphene and the use of interfacial layers and anti-reflection coatings have improved the overall PCE of Gr/Si solar cells significantly. Gr/Si photovoltaic devices seem to offer a promising new technology for future solar cells. In spite of its rapid progress, there are limitations and challenges for its applications on a commercial scale. One of the main hurdles is to achieve the continuous growth and superior quality of the material. Apart from that, the environmental stability is also a concern for Gr/Si solar cells. Keeping in mind the recent advances, it can be predicted that Gr with Si-based electronics might be developed for high-performance solar cells with commercial applications.
