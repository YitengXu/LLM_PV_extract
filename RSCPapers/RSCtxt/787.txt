    , Accepted 26th August 2015First published on 26th August 2015AbstractHigh-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were directly prepared on simple treated ITO glass in air under a relative humidity of lower than 30%. Due to efficient charge transport at the ITO (or PCBM)/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces, the champion and average PCEs of 12.78% and 10.85% are obtained in the inverted perovskite solar cells without any hole transport layer, which provides a promising method for low-cost and easy processing industrialization of perovskite solar cells.
In the past few decades, several promising photovoltaic devices with the advantages of being solution-processable, low-cost, and compatible with flexible substrates have attracted considerable attention for next generation renewable energy devices, such as organic solar cells,1–4 dye sensitized solar cells,5,6 and quantum dot solar cells.7 Recently, organometal trihalide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) have emerged as a new material for photovoltaic applications with the above advantages.8–10 Moreover, this kind of material is abundant in nature and has several promising properties, such as appropriate bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, long hole–electron diffusion lengths, and excellent carrier transport.11–14 Great progress has been made in perovskite solar cells, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has boosted from 3.8%15 in 2009 to over 15%.8–10,16–19 Now, the highest PCE has reached 20.1% as certified by NREL.20 There are two main architectures considered for perovskite solar cells. One is a conventional mesoporous structure commonly using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as the electron transport scaffold layer. However, the formation of the mesoporous TiO2 layer requires high-temperature processing (>450 °C) to improve charge mobility,21,22 and the resulting device suffers from instability and exhibits large hysteresis with different sweep directions.23,24 Meanwhile, organic material spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7'-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene) is applied as the hole transport layer, which needs some additives to improve its performance.23–25 These further increase the complexity of the device fabrication process. The other device is an inverted planar structure, which can avoid using the mesoporous TiO2 layer. In the typically inverted structure, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used hole transport material on the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate for hole collection and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is the electron transport layer for electron collection.26–32 Dai et al. reported an inverted CH3NH3PbI3−xClx planar perovskite solar cell prepared by a layer-by-layer method. The PCE is as high as 15.12% without hysteresis in the current–voltage measurement.29 However, there are some drawbacks using PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer due to its hydrophilic and strong acidic nature, which could deteriorate the stability of the solar cells.33–35 Recently, several groups have reported inverted perovskite solar cells with nickel oxide (NiOx) as the hole transport layer with positive results.36–38 However, the preparation of the NiOx film requires high-temperature processing or a sputtering method, which could increase the cost and complexity of the process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop simple device structures or easy solution-processable hole transport materials for perovskite solar cell applications. One of the challenging and prospective methods is directly fabricating a perovskite film on a conducting substrate without any transport layer.
In this letter, an inverted planar perovskite solar cell directly prepared on simple treated ITO glass without any hole transport layer is reported. Perovskite films with a smooth surface and free of pinholes were obtained on ITO glass through effectively controlling the morphology in air under a relative humidity of lower than 30%. PCBM was used as the electron transport material, and devices with the structure of ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al were fabricated. The device shows a PCE of 12.78% under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm2, which is the highest reported value to date for perovskite solar cells without any hole transport layer in inverted structures.
X-ray diffraction measurement was carried out to verify the structure and crystallization of the prepared film, as shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD pattern of the prepared film has three intense diffraction peaks at 14.17°, 28.49° and 31.92°, which can be assigned to the (110), (220) and (310) crystal planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure, respectively.8 There are no impurity peaks in the XRD pattern of the CH3NH3PbI3 film, indicating that the PbI2 and CH3NH3I have completely transformed into a perovskite phase. Fig. 1b shows the typical absorption spectrum of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on the ITO substrate, which absorbs in a wide range from visible to near infrared as previously reported.26 The surface quality of the perovskite film is extremely important for high-performance solar cell applications. To evaluate the morphology of the prepared CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film on ITO glass, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the surface morphology, as shown in Fig. 1c. It clearly shows that the perovskite film is composed of compact grains with the size of a few hundred nanometers and full coverage on the ITO glass. Furthermore, it exhibits a large homogeneous film without any cracks (Fig. S1a, ESI†). It is worth pointing out that there are no pinholes, which could reduce photocurrent recombination between two electrodes. The film was further characterized by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) as shown in Fig. 1d. The film shows the flat surface morphology with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 10.2 nm for an area of 5 μm × 5 μm. Even after enlarging the scanning area to 10 μm × 10 μm (Fig. S1b†), the RMS value is still only 10.7 nm. The quite smooth surface is favorable to be covered with a thin electron transport layer, such as PCBM for inverted structures or spiro-OMeTAD for conventional devices.

The sandwich-structured inverted perovskite solar cell with the configuration of glass/ITO/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Al (Fig. 2a) without using a hole transport layer was designed and fabricated, and its cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image is shown in Fig. 2a. From the cross-sectional view, there are no clear crystalline grain boundaries, cracks or pinholes in the perovskite layer. It can be seen that the device shows a flat layer-by-layer structure with clear interfaces. The thickness of the perovskite film is about 270–300 nm, which is adequate to absorb incident light sufficiently.39 Furthermore, photo-induced carriers can be effectively collected due to their long lifetimes and excellent transport properties.13,14 The smooth surface of the perovskite film discussed above can be fully covered by a 40 nm thick PCBM film. It is known to all that the energy-level matching is very important for high-performance devices. A schematic energy diagram of the device is illustrated in Fig. 2b. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of CH3NH3PbI3 and PCBM were taken from the literature values.40,41 When light irradiates on the solar cells, the CH3NH3PbI3 layer will absorb photons to produce carriers, and the carriers will diffuse to the corresponding electrodes to be collected. As shown in Fig. 2b, because the LUMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 is higher than that of PCBM, efficient electron transport to the Al cathode is expected. Meanwhile, the work function of ITO and the HOMO level of CH3NH3PbI3 are −4.7 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively. From the viewpoint of energy levels, the device should exhibit high hole transport and collection efficiency to the ITO electrode. In addition, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite film on glass and ITO with photoexcitation at 507 nm are recorded and shown in Fig. 2c. There is a sharp PL spectrum at 770 nm for the film prepared on the glass substrate, which is consistent with the previously reported results.42 However, a significant quenching effect was observed in the film on the ITO substrate. The result further confirms that the holes can be effectively transferred at the interface of ITO and CH3NH3PbI3. Furthermore, the PL lifetime of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on the ITO substrate was also investigated (Fig. S2†). According to a previous report, the PL lifetimes of the neat CH3NH3PbI3 film and CH3NH3PbI3/PEDOT:PSS are 200.1 and 50 ns, respectively. Here, the PL lifetime of the CH3NH3PbI3 film is only 28.5 ns, indicating that the charge transfers fast even without the PEDOT:PSS layer.

The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the perovskite solar cells were measured under the irradiation of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 and with a scan rate of 100 ms 10 mV−1, as shown in Fig. 3a. The device performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device exhibits a good PCE of 12.78%, with a high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.997 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 18.83 mW cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 68.04%. In addition, the forward J–V scan is also given in Fig. 3a. A PCE of 12.21% is obtained and the hysteresis is negligible. The results demonstrate that the holes can be effectively transported and collected, and consequently the device exhibits high performance even without any hole transport layer. Moreover, the stability was investigated with the devices being stored for 150 days. The obtained J–V curve and related device parameters are also given in Fig. 3a and Table 1. The device shows good stability with a PCE of 9.91% after being stored for 150 days, indicating a drop only by 23%. In our previous result, the PCE dropped by 12.3% after 20 days for the devices include a PEDOT:PSS hole transporter.43 The improved device stability could be due to no application of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Furthermore, the current and power outputs of the devices without or with the PEDOT:PSS layer are given in Fig. S3.† The solar cells with different structures show similar stabilized power outputs in comparison with the J–V curves with the reverse scan. We know that the stabilized power output was poor for hole/electron transport layer free devices in the previous reports.23,44 The excellent stabilized power output could be due to the improved quality of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and the formation of a good contact with ITO glass.

Furthermore, in order to verify the accuracy of the J–V values, the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite solar cell was measured, as shown in Fig. 3b. The device exhibits excellent photo-response in the broad range of 350–750 nm with the maximum EQE of 80.17% at 600 nm. The cut-off of the photo-response is at 790 nm, which agrees well with the optical bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. S2†). Importantly, the calculated JSC from the integrating EQE spectrum is 17.98 mW cm−2, which is coincident with the measured value of 18.83 mA cm−2.
In order to investigate the reproducibility of the cells, 60 separate devices were fabricated and tested using the previous optimization conditions. Fig. 4 shows the histograms of the device performance parameters. The Gaussian fit of the distribution was plotted for the histogram. As can be seen in Fig. 4b, all devices show a relatively high VOC of nearly 1.00 V. The VOC is higher than those of the previously reported devices with PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer, which is mainly ascribed to the high-quality perovskite film and matching the work function of the ITO electrode.28 In addition, the average JSC is moderate with a value of nearly 17.00 mW cm−2, and the FF is very good (∼70%) for all devices. As a result, the 60 separate devices show an average PCE as high as 10.85% (Table 1). We know that the high performance is related to energy level matches of devices, good morphology and long carrier lifetimes of the perovskite film. As discussed above, the perovskite film directly prepared on ITO is smooth and pinhole-free and it can be fully covered with a thin layer PCBM, together with appropriate energy level matching, resulting in high photovoltaic performance without the PEDOT:PSS layer.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated an inverted planar perovskite solar cell directly on ITO glass without using any hole transport layer. Through effectively controlling the morphology, the perovskite films with a flat surface and free of pinholes were prepared on ITO glass. From the viewpoint of the device energy level and PL results, efficient charge extraction has occurred at both CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and ITO/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces. In combination with high charge carrier mobility of the excellent perovskite film, a PCE of 12.78% was obtained under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 in the inverted perovskite solar cell without a hole transport layer. The results indicate that perovskite films directly prepared on ITO without any hole transport layer can also produce high-performance perovskite solar cells. It provides an attractive alternative for easy processing large scale fabrication of low-cost perovskite solar cells.
