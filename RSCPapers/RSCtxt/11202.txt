    , Accepted 16th December 2018First published on 17th December 2018AbstractSodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with high energy/power density have been in urgent demand for various power applications. Upgrading the electrochemical dynamics of electrode materials is crucial to achieve this goal. Herein, we exhibit delicately synthesized cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe2 nanocavities (h-FeSe2@PC) with sub-5 nm ultrathin walls and multiple rooms for ultrafast sodium storage. Unlike with the conventional interphase Kirkendall effect, the multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities were formed via an exotic stress-induced cracking–hollowing reassembly mechanism. Benefiting from their unique multi-hierarchy, more than 93% pseudocapacitive capacity contribution was recognized in an h-FeSe2@PC anode, featuring ultrafast dynamics. As a result, h-FeSe2@PC displayed an extremely low-decay (9.5%) rate capability, ultrastable cyclability (over 2000 loops with 98.5% capacity retention), and high energy/power densities (670.7 W h kg−1/35.3 kW kg−1 at 20 A g−1). The results of multiple analyses and comparisons showed that the dynamics-promoted superior performance was correlated almost completely to the applied FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC by shortening the Na+-diffusion length to near the accessible limit (<10 nm) and to the fast electron transfer ensured by the cellular carbon. The exhibited dynamics-oriented materials design could open up an avenue to aid the further development of high-performance electrodes.
1. Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have witnessed striking successes in various applications, ranging from portable electronic devices, electric vehicles (EVs) to smart grids over the past decades, owing to their high energy density, long-life cyclability, and environmentally benign property.1–3 However, the limited lithium reserves (20 mg kg−1 in the earth's crust) cannot meet the upgraded energy demand, especially for near-future EVs and the promotion of smart grids.4 Low-cost sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are currently deemed as promising alternatives to LIBs, especially for portable and smart-grid applications.5–8 High-energy/power density sodium storage is of significant concern to meet a durable and fast power output but remains full of challenges to date.9–14
Rational componential selection and nanostructured design greatly affect the sodium-storage performance of active materials. Cost-efficient chalcogenides consisting of transitional metals (M = Sb, Mo, Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, etc.) and chalcogen (X = O, S, Se) possess a higher theoretical specific capacity (300–1000 mA h g−1) and tapping density than that of hard carbon, which intrinsically makes them favorable for high-energy density sodium storage.15–23 Compared with metal oxides or sulfides, metal selenides have a higher tapping density and electronic conductivity, enabling the achievement of a high-volumetric capacity and high-rate capability.24–33 In addition, the nanostructured design has a powerful extrinsic mediation effect on their sodium-storage property. Masashi et al. found a remarkably enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior when nanosizing a LiCoO2 electrode from the bulk to 6 nm, suggesting a miraculous nanometer effect on lithium-ion storage behavior.34 Dunn and coworkers' research verified an enhanced surface/near-surface pseudocapacitive effect universally existing in various nanosized active materials (e.g., TiO2, MoS2, MoO3).35–38 Benefiting from the ultrafast pseudocapacitive redox reaction dynamics, such materials usually exhibit a high-rate and stable lithium/sodium-ion storage. Moreover, the nanosized design also effectively suppresses the pulverization of active materials, providing a good contact between materials and the current collector.39–42 Besides, bridging active species with carbon materials is an advisable strategy toward the electronic highway, boosting the overall sodium-storage performance of the resultant nanohybrids.43–45
As a narrow-band gap (1.0 eV) p-type semi-conductor, FeSe2 is equipped with some fascinating properties, like fast electron transfer, high adsorption coefficient, and a stronger quantum confined effect, displaying extensive application potential in electrochemical catalysis, dye-sensitized solar cells, and metal-ion batteries.46–49 When serving as an anode for SIBs, the sodium-storage properties of FeSe2 vary depending on the electrolyte variety and voltage window to the material's architecture. It has been suggested, during cyclic charge–discharge, that metal sulfides/selenides-converted intermediates gradually dissolve in carbonate ester-based electrolytes, leading to fast capacity decay, as occurs in lithium–sulfur batteries; while relatively stable intermediates are formed in ether-based electrolytes, which is more conducive to sustaining good cyclability.48,50 Moreover, a proper voltage range is pivotal to attain long-life cyclability because of the circumvented side reactions. Chen et al. first reported solvothermal-synthesized FeSe2 microspheres as SIBs anodes with ether-based electrolytes in a cutoff voltage range, obtaining a high-rate capability and good cyclic stability.26 Electrochemical analysis suggested the existence of a typical pseudocapacitive behavior during the sodiation–desodiation of FeSe2 microspheres. Recently, Ji et al. reported a rod-like N-doped carbon-coated FeSe2 for SIBs with ether-based electrolytes, attaining a high rate capability and long-life cyclability, which benefitted from an enhanced capacitive effect from the reduced rod diameters.25 Lately, Kang et al. observed a stable, thinner (ca. 2.5 nm) ether-based electrolyte-SEI layer than that (ca. 10 nm) of the typical ester-based electrolyte on anatase TiO2, which partly accounted for the better rate capability of the former.51 However, it remains unclear if the effect applies to other metal sulfides/selenides. On the other hand, FeSe2/carbon nanohybrids with various architectures have also been reported for SIBs in ester-based electrolytes, such as carbon-coated hollow FeSe2 nanospheres/reduced graphene oxides, hollow FeSe2/carbon nanospheres, and hierarchical FeSe2 nanoboxes composites.52–55 Interestingly, Pint et al. found, when downscaling conversion-type pyrite FeS2 from the bulk to 4.5 nm (comparable to or smaller than the diffusion length of iron ions during electrochemical ion exchange), a dramatically improved lithium/sodium-storage performance was afforded by thermodynamically reversible nanodomains consisting of Fe and NaxS or LixS formed electrochemically.39,56 Although substantial efforts have been dedicated to the study of FeSe2-based materials, few reports to date have elucidated the sodium-storage behavior of FeSe2/carbon nanohybrids with extremely short-ion diffusion, accelerated ion migration, and fast electron transfer in ether-based electrolytes.
In this work, we present a delicate synthesis of unique cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe2 nanocavities with ultrathin (sub-5 nm) walls and multiple rooms (h-FeSe2@PC), and probe into the effect of their multi-hierarchy on sodium-storage behavior. Hollow iron oxides with a mono-chamber were created and used for lithium storage in our previous work,33 whereas the present h-FeSe2@PC displayed an evidently different structure (ultrathin-walled and multi-room nanocavities) and electrochemical properties for superior sodium storage. Specifically, by an unusual Kirkendall effect, selenized metastable Fe3C nanoparticles on cellular carbon experienced an exotic stress-induced cracking–hollowing reassembly process, eventually forming ultrathin-wall and multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the h-FeSe2@PC exhibited an extremely low-decay rate capability and ultrastable cyclability, which overwhelms the performance of s-FeSe2@PC and other chalcogenide-based anodes. Electrochemical dynamics analysis revealed that the h-FeSe2@PC enables more than 93% surface/near-surface pseudocapacitive reactions, unveiling the dynamics-promoted superior performance by way of the near-limit accessible ion diffusion length in FeSe2 and fast electron transfer ensured by the cellular carbon.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of cellular carbon-wrapped Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@PC)
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and PVP (K30) were purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai). Fe3C@PC was synthesized via a modified method reported previously.33 Typically, 1.0 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.67 g PVP (K30) were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water and stirred for 3 h, and then oven-dried at 80 °C overnight. Next, the as-obtained yellow mixture was hand-milled and put into a tube furnace, and annealed at 700 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, a resultant black sample was collected.
2.2. Synthesis of cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe2 nanocavities with ultrathin walls and multiple rooms (h-FeSe2@PC)
In a typical run, 50 mg Fe3C@PC and an overweight of Se powder were separately put into a quartz boat and covered with carbon paper, then transferred into a tube furnace with the Se powders upstream of the carrier gas. The selenization was conducted under a mixed H2/Ar flow at 360 °C for 8 h with various ramp rates (0.5, 1.0, and 2 °C min−1). After cooling down to room temperature, the h-FeSe2@PC was obtained. For comparison, s-FeSe2@PC was synthesized via similarly treating preoxidized Fe3C@PC at 300 °C for 1 h as well.
2.3. Characterization of the materials
The crystal structure of the materials was recorded by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2400 type X-ray spectrometer with Cu Kα radiation (l¼1.5406 Å)). The morphological features were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The structure details were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit, operated at 120 kV) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30S-Twin, operated at 300 kV). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were collected with a Gatan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera in a digital format. The surface valence states were analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250). The Raman spectra were performed using a Raman microscope (DXR).
2.4. Electrochemical performance tests
The anodes were prepared by mixing the samples (h-FeSe2@PC, s-FeSe2@PC), acetylene carbon black and binder (poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF) with the weight ratio of 7:2:1 in the n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form a slurry. Then, the slurry was pasted onto copper foil to form electrodes. After being vacuum-dried at 120 °C overnight, these electrodes were tailored and weighed. The mass loading of the active materials was ca. 0.74 mg cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
The h-FeSe2@PC nanohybrids were controllably synthesized by delicately fumigating carbon-housed metastable Fe3C nanoparticles wrapped by cellular carbon (Fe3C@PC) under a H2Se atmosphere (Fig. 1a). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-chelated ferric nitrate hydrate pyrolysis-derived Fe3C@PC was employed as a precursor, rendering a well-defined cellular carbon framework for fast electrolyte permeation and electron transfer. Unlike the universal solid/gas interphase Kirkendall effect, in which a unitary nanoparticle is hollowed out to a single cavity,52,57 metastable Fe3C nanoparticles herein were completely converted to ultrathin-wall multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities with an unusual stress-induced cracking/hollowing reassembly mechanism (Fig. 1a). The unique evolution processes were correlated with the selenization ramp rates and time, which are analyzed in the subsequent discussion. The FE-SEM and TEM images in Fig. S1a–c† show the typical cellular architecture of Fe3C@PC built from thin carbon sheets decorated with plentiful sub-10 nm Fe3C nanoparticles. The magnified TEM image further exhibited the presence of carbon layers outside the nanoparticle with a 0.226 nm interplanar distance, corresponding to the (002) lattice plane of Fe3C, as confirmed by the XRD patterns of Fe3C@PC (Fig. S1d,† and 2a). The well-matched diffraction peaks of h-FeSe2@PC with standard patterns in Fig. 2a suggest a complete conversion of pure cohenite Fe3C (PDF 85-1317) in the Fe3C@PC into ferroselite FeSe2 (PDF 82-0269). Fig. 2b and c demonstrate the typical crystal structures of cohenite Fe3C (space-group Pnma (62), orthorhombic) and ferroselite FeSe2 (space group Pnnm (58), orthorhombic).

The FE-SEM images in Fig. 2d illustrate the well-inherited cellular structure of h-FeSe2@PC from Fe3C@PC. However, different from Fe3C@PC, many embossments appear on the carbon sheets of h-FeSe2@PC, which was originally smooth before selenization (Fig. S1a,† inset). Furthermore, the TEM image clearly shows a uniform mosaic of hollow FeSe2 nanocavities on the carbon sheets, corresponding to the embossments mentioned above (Fig. 2e). The Raman spectra of h-FeSe2@PC and Fe3C@PC in Fig. 2f indicate typical featured bands located at 1342 cm−1 (D-band) and 1591 cm−1 (G-band), which are related to disordered and sp2-hybridized carbon, respectively.58 For Fe3C@PC, the peaks at 217.5, 283.9, and 397.3 cm−1 were indexed to the characteristic vibration modes of Fe3C.59 Compared with Fe3C@PC, the widened D-band of h-FeSe2@PC could be extrinsically induced by the intumescent formation of FeSe2 nanocavities; while the peaks appearing at 218.7, 282.3, and 593 cm−1 were ascribed to Fe–Se vibration modes. Besides, the peak located at 391.6 cm−1 was associated with an Fe–O vibration mode.60 Such results are in good accordance with the information provided by the XRD patterns.
The N2 adsorption isotherm of h-FeSe2@PC in Fig. 3a shows a typical IV profile with an obvious hysteresis loop, with the corresponding pore width distribution testifying the coexistence of micropores (centered at 0.7 and 1.4 nm) and mesopores (<10 nm) in the nanohybrids. In contrast, the N2 adsorption isotherm in Fig. S2† shows no evident porous structure, indicating a typical solid FeSe2 structure in s-FeSe2@PC. The BET specific surface area of h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC was 67.4 and 14.3 m2 g−1, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 3b and c, the magnified TEM images explicitly present the unique multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities consisting of several voids (marked in green number) with a wall-thickness of around 3 nm and typical internal diameter of ∼4.8 nm, which confirm the good mesopore distribution as mentioned above. The HR-TEM image in Fig. 3d further features the structural details of a single FeSe2 nanocavity housed by few-layer graphitized carbon (pointed by red arrow), in which the interplanar distance of 0.221 nm was indexed to the (210) crystal plane of FeSe2 as demonstrated by the corresponding FFT image (inset). Interestingly, one can observe the presence of <2 nm apertures along the FeSe2 nanocavity wall by HR-TEM (navigated by green double-arrow), which indicates an incomplete connection of such nanocavities, which is beneficial to inward electrolyte diffusion. The TEM-EDS elemental mapping in Fig. 3e exhibits a well-matched distribution of C, Fe, Se, and N to the referred TEM image, verifying the uniform mosaic of FeSe2 nanocavities over the cellular carbon. Besides, Fig. S3† shows that the atomic ratio of Fe to Se was 7:12, which is generally consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of FeSe2, suggesting the presence of FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC.

The formation of h-FeSe2@PC was clarified by characterizing the samples obtained at incremental ramp rates (e.g., 0.5, 1, and 2 °C min−1). The FE-SEM images in Fig. S4a and b† display the impact of hollow FeSex structures in FeSex@PC-0.5, but with smaller internal space than that of h-FeSe2@PC (1 °C min−1). This phenomenon could be caused by an inadequate migration rate of FeSex species outward since an overmoderated selenization rate fails to afford a proper driving force for the Fe3C/FeSex boundary diffusion rates difference.57 Instead of hollow nanospheres, it is faintly visible that some nanoparticles loosely aggregate on the carbon sheets of FeSex@PC-2 (Fig. S4c and d†). Such nanoparticles seem to be evolved from fragmentations of the original FeSex nanoparticles when subjected to inhomogeneous stress from an over-quick selenization rate. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig. S4f,† the resultant samples (FeSex@PC-0.5 and FeSex@PC-2) consist of similar chemical compositions FeSe2 (PDF 79-1892) and Fe3Se4 (PDF 71-2250). Thus, it is well-documented that the selenization ramp rate determines the chemical compositions and morphological features of FeSex, whereby thin-wall multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities can be obtained at a proper selenization ramp rate.
The structural evolution of ultrathin-wall multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities was further investigated through characterizing the samples with different selenization times (e.g., 2, 4, and 8 h) by TEM. As shown in Fig. S5a,† the chemical compositions in h-FeSe2@PC-2h and h-FeSe2@PC-4h were that of FeSe2, which is the same as typical h-FeSe2@PC (8 h). Compared with original Fe3C nanoparticles in Fig. S1b,† FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC-2h presents a hollow internal space encircled with apparent cracked solid particles, which results from the stress-difference between Fe3C and FeSe2 phases during the selenization (Fig. S5b and c†). In contrast, FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC-4h exhibits enlarged internal space with relatively continuous outer walls, indicating that these cracked particles experience further hollowing and volume expansion inward and outward (Fig. S5d and e†). With the extension of selenization time to 8 h, the FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC eventually develop to give an ultrathin-wall multi-room superstructure (Fig. 3b and c). Such results verify the proposed stress-induced cracking-hollowing reassembly mechanism in Fig. 1b.
To elucidate the comparative superiority of thin-walled multi-room FeSe2 for sodium-storage properties, solid FeSe2 nanoparticles mosaiced cellular carbon (s-FeSe2@PC) was prepared by analogously selenizing preoxidized Fe3C@PC nanohybrids. The XRD pattern and Raman spectrum of s-FeSe2@PC in Fig. S6a and b† display well-matched diffraction peaks of FeSe2 with the standard pattern (PDF 82-0269) and featured Raman bands of FeSe2 and carbon, respectively, suggesting the coexistence of FeSe2 and carbon. The FE-SEM images in Fig. S6c† show a cellular structure built from scobinate carbon sheets similar to h-FeSe2@PC. The TEM image in Fig. S6d† clearly presents amounts of solid nanoparticles mosaiced on the carbon sheets; while the magnified TEM image in Fig. S6e† further shows the > 20 nm diameter of such FeSe2 nanoparticles, which is comparative to that of hollow multi-room FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC (Fig. 2b). The HR-TEM image in Fig. S6f† suggests the FeSe2 nanoparticles are housed by carbon layers like that in h-FeSe2@PC, while the 0.22 nm interplanar distance is assigned to the (210) lattice plane of FeSe2.
By TGA and XPS, the FeSe2 content and surface electronic structure of h-FeSe2@PC were determined. As illustrated in Fig. 4a and S7,† TGA profiles of bare FeSe2, h-FeSe2@PC, and s-FeSe2@PC show 43.4 wt%, 64.7 wt%, and 62.1 wt% weight loss, respectively. During the TGA tests, the FeSe2 phase was oxidized, and cellular carbon was burnt out. Therefore, the content of FeSe2 in h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC could be calculated following the equation y = (1 − x)/(x − 0.434), where x is the whole weight loss of nanocomposites, while 0.434 corresponds to the weight loss of bare FeSe2. The calculated content of FeSe2 in the h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC was 62.4 wt% and 66.8 wt%, respectively, suggesting a similar content of FeSe2 in these two nanohybrids. The XPS survey scan in Fig. 4b uncovered the characteristic spectra of C 1s, Fe 2p, Se 3d, and N 1s. Moreover, the high-resolution C 1s spectrum could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 284.6, 286.4, and 288.6 eV, respectively corresponding to carbon in C–C/CC, C–O, and CO bonds (Fig. S8a†);61 while the high-resolution N 1s spectrum manifests a predominant presence of pyrrolic-N at 400.6 eV along with less pyridinic-N at 398.5 and quaternary-N at 403.5 eV (Fig. S8b†);62 the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum could be decoupled into four peaks at 710.7, 713.2, 718.5, and 724.2 eV, corresponding to iron in Fe 2p3/2, Fe 2p3/2, satellite peak, and Fe 2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 4c);46 and the high-resolution Se 3d spectrum could be split into three peaks at 54.6, 55.8, and 58.8 eV, respectively corresponding to selenium in Se 3d5/2, Se 3d3/2, and SeO2 (Fig. 4d).63

To study the electrochemical performance, two FeSe2-based anodes were coupled with sodium metal counter electrodes in coin cells with 1 mol L−1 NaCF3SO3 in DEGDME as the electrolyte. All the tests were performed in a cutoff voltage range of 0.4–2.9 V to circumvent the side reactions. The redox reactions were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests conducted at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S9a and b,† two anodes present a similar CV curve evolution, indicating that they experienced similar electrochemical mechanisms. The first cathodic CV curves of two anodes present a sharp reductive peak at 1.33 V, corresponding to the formation of solid electrolytes interphase (SEI) layers; in subsequent CV scans, two evident cathodic peaks at ca. 1.65 and 0.64 V are detected, which accord with the formation of NaxFeSe2 (D1), Fe, and Na2Se (D3), respectively. Notably, an inconspicuous cathodic peak resulting from the smaller scan rate (0.1 mV s−1) appears at ca. 1.05 V, which becomes stronger when scanned at larger rates (Fig. 5a), corresponding to the formation of FeSe and Na2Se (D2). In addition, two sharp anodic peaks appear at ca. 1.5 and 2.0 V, corresponding to the formation of intermediate NaxFeSe2 (C1) and final FeSe2 (C2), respectively.26 Matching with the CV tests, the discharge/charge profiles of two anodes also display identified plateaus at the corresponding voltage positions (Fig. S9c and d†). The involved redox reactions are as follows. FeSe2 + xNa+ + xe− → NaxFeSe2(D1) NaxFeSe2 + (2 − x)Na+ + (2 − x)e− → FeSe + Na2Se(D2) FeSe2 + 2Na+ + 2e− → Fe + Na2Se(D3) Fe + 2Na2Se → NaxFeSe2 + (4 − x)Na+ + (4 − x)e−(C1) NaxFeSe2 → FeSe2 + xNa+ + xe−(C2)

Fig. 5a shows the discharge/charge profiles of the h-FeSe2@PC anode at different current densities. Well-sustained discharge platforms at ca. 1.65, 0.98, and 0.64 V, and charge platforms at ca. 1.50 and 2.01 V can be clearly seen at a current density ranging from 0.5 to 20 A g−1, indicating a highly stable voltage output capability. Notably, to obtain a stable rate capability for comparison, when the h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC anodes were pre-run at certain discharge/charge rates, an initial coulombic efficiency of 83.3% was achieved for the former (Fig. S10†). As presented in Fig. 5b, the pre-run h-FeSe2@PC anode displays an overwhelming rate capability over that of the s-FeSe2@PC anode, whereby the former average capacity is 1.41 times higher than the latter. Specifically, high capacities of 414.5, 413.3, 407.6, 400.2, 398.6, 397.7, 395.5, 393.0, 392.7, and 384.3 mA h g−1 were obtained from the h-FeSe2@PC anode at current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 20 A g−1, respectively, featuring an extremely low capacity decrease (9.5%) from 1 to 20 A g−1. Compared with other metal chalcogenide-based anodes reported elsewhere (Table S1†), the h-FeSe2@PC anode was evidently advantageous especially at high current densities ranging from 4 to 20 A g−1 (Fig. 5c). To appraise the application potential, the energy density and power density of the h-FeSe2@PC anode were calculated respectively on the basis of the active materials, as shown in Fig. 5d. For comparison, we also provide the corresponding result of a FeSe2-free cellular carbon (PC) anode (Fig. S11†). The energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated following the equations:  where i, v, m, and t respectively represent the current, voltage, mass of active material, and charge time in the half coin cell with a sodium plate as the counter electrode. In other words, the energy density (E) is numerically equal to the integration area of charge profile of voltage (V) versus capacity (mA h g−1, or A h kg−1), while the power density (P) is obtained using the energy density (E) divided by the charge time (t) corresponding to the charge profile.64 As expected, the h-FeSe2@PC anode showed an almost horizontal Ragone plot under various charge rates (from 0.5 to 20 A g−1), corresponding to an extremely low energy density decay (6.1%) with the power density increasing (Fig. 5d). In contrast, the PC anode showed a remarkably lowered energy density at the same charge rates. Impressively, the h-FeSe2@PC anode simultaneously delivered a very high energy density of 670.7 W h kgelectrode−1 and power density of 35.54 kW kgelectrode−1 at a high current density of 20 A g−1 (ca. 1 min for full charge). Furthermore, when cycled at 5 A g−1 over 2000 loops, the h-FeSe2@PC anode displayed a high capacity of 380.5 mA h g−1, superior to that of s-FeSe2@PC, corresponding to 98.5% capacity retention (Fig. 5e). The cycled h-FeSe2@PC anode was characterized by TEM, as shown in Fig. S12,† with the multi-room structure of the sample showing certain damage. However, such damage imposed no evident deterioration on the sodium-storage performance. Even when cycled at a higher rate of 10 A g−1 for 1250 loops, as high as 333.2 mA h g−1 capacity remained with 97.6% capacity retention (Fig. S13†). Such results manifest that the h-FeSe2@PC holds great promise for high energy/power density sodium storage.
For a deepened insight into high-efficiency sodium storage, the electrochemical reaction dynamics of h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC were further analyzed and compared. Following the theory proposed by Dunn and coworkers, the relationship between the peak current (i) and scan rate (v) in the CV curves accords with the equation: i = avb, where a and b are adjustable parameters.35 The b-value is usually in the range of 0.5–1, which qualitatively demonstrates the pseudocapacitive fraction in the total capacity. When the b-value is equal to 1, the total capacity is completely contributed by surface/near-surface pseudocapacitive behavior, corresponding to a well-defined pseudocapacitance-type electrode material (e.g. Nb2O5);65 but when the b-value is close to 0.5, the energy storage is ion diffusion-controlled bulk behavior, which is a feature of an ideal battery-type material (e.g., LiFePO4).66Fig. 6a illustrates the CV curves of h-FeSe2@PC at different scan rates, in which five typical redox peaks are clearly seen, inosculating with the discharge/charge platforms in Fig. 5a. By fitting the linear relationship of ln(i) versus ln(v) in the CV curves, the as-obtained b-values were 0.84, 1.00, 0.80, 0.80, and 1.00, corresponding to redox peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, revealing a high-proportion pseudocapacitive contribution. For comparison, the CV tests of s-FeSe2@PC at the same scan rates were also conducted, and the homologous b-values were 0.82, 0.98, 0.82, 0.69, and 1.00, respectively (Fig. S14†). The pseudocapacitive contribution was calculated following the equation: i = k1v + k2v1/2, where k1v and k2v1/2 represents the pseudocapacitive and ion-diffusion controlled contributions, respectively.35 The k1-values could be acquired on the basis of the linear relationship of i/v1/2versus v1/2 at fixed potentials. The pseudocapacitive contributions at various scan rates were calculated employing the integral area of the original CV curves divided by the counterpart of i = k1v.67 Interestingly, the h-FeSe2@PC displays in Fig. 6c inching pseudocapacitive contributions at 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.0 mV s−1, specifically, 93.5%, 93.8%, 94.2%, 94.5%, and 94.8%, which indicates the total specific capacity was almost completely contributed by the pseudocapacitive behavior. Moreover, this result was pervasively higher than that of s-FeSe2@PC (84.5%, 85.5%, 86.3%, 87.1%, and 88.6%). Despite only 7.76% average pseudocapacitive differences between them, the latter pseudocapacitive capacity contribution is 61.2% of the former based on their average capacities at 20 A g−1. Fig. 6d demonstrates the typical cathodic parts of CV curves for the two electrodes at 1 mV s−1 with the pseudocapacitive fractions (shaded areas), suggesting an advantageous pseudocapacitive behavior in h-FeSe2@PC over that of s-FeSe2@PC.

To further verify the enhanced electrochemical reaction dynamics of h-FeSe2@PC, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was employed to calculate the Na+ diffusion coefficients (DNa+) in the two anodes.68 Through measuring the potential changes in the work electrode and counter electrode with a fixed pulse current, DNa+ can be determined. Before the GITT tests, the anodes were cycled at 0.5 A g−1 for 5 loops to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). As exhibited in Fig. S15,† the discharge/charge GITT profiles of the h-FeSe2@PC anode present gradually augmented overpotentials with the proceeding electrochemical courses, indicating a mounting dynamic difficulty in the desodiation/sodiation procedures.69 Based on the GITT profiles of the two anodes in Fig. 7a, DNa+ was calculated following the equation:  where mB is the active material mass of the h-FeSe2@PC and s-FeSe2@PC anodes (0.483 and 0.455 mg), MB is the molar mass (46.7 g mol−1), VM is the molar volume (14.9 and 15.8 cm3 mol−1), S is the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte (close to the surface area of the electrode: 1.539 cm2), ΔEs is the IR drop, and ΔEτ is the potential difference ranging from τ0 to τ0+t (t = 30 min) when galvanostatically discharged. As illustrated in Fig. 7b, the h-FeSe2@PC anode generally shows higher DNa+ than that of s-FeSe2@PC, accounting for the comparative superiority of the h-FeSe2@PC anode. Corresponding to the discharge profiles (inset), the valley values of DNa+ always occur at the voltage platforms, while the peak values appear at the sloping voltage zone of the discharge, revealing regularly fluctuating ion-diffusion rates in the cutoff voltage of 0.4–2.9 V.

Notably, for the conversion-type FeSe2 anode, the electrochemical reaction depth was limited by the accessible diffusion coefficient of Fe (DFe ≈ 10−18 cm2 s−1) and Na+ at room temperature. Herein, DNa+ (∼10−12 cm2 s−1) was far larger than DFe, thus the accessible Fe diffusion length (LFe ≥ 10 nm) identified by ex situ STEM-EDS and Raman mapping largely determined the reaction processes.56 Thus, when the FeSe2 size is in the LFe regime, a reversible activated layer for redox reactions can be obtained. Depending on the analysis above concerning the material architecture and electrochemical properties, the superior sodium-storage mechanism of h-FeSe2@PC can be reasonably ascribed to a rigorous ion diffusion-confined, pseudocapacitive behavior, as seen in Fig. 7c. For the h-FeSe2@PC, LFe is smaller than the ultrathin wall-thickness (D1 ≈ 5 nm) of FeSe2 nanocavities, thus the whole FeSe2 could be available (L1 + L2 ≈ D1). In contrast, since LFe is less than the diameter (D2 ≥ 20 nm) of solid FeSe2 nanoparticles in s-FeSe2@PC, incomplete redox reactions are unavoidable (L < D2). Overall, the perforated ultrathin-wall multi-room FeSe2 nanocavities not only afford an extremely short ion-diffusion length and function as an electrolyte supply depot, but they are also favorable for double-sided ion aggression during the electrochemical reactions, which is desirable for high-efficiency sodium storage (Fig. 7c I). On the other hand, because of the approachable ion-diffusion length (L) limited by the electrochemical dynamics, solid FeSe2 nanoparticles could form an unreactive isolated island, which is detrimental to adequately unlocking the specific capacity (Fig. 7c II).
Besides, for an extensive demonstration, we also investigated the effect of the FeSe2 content in h-FeSe2@PC and the selenization time on the sodium-storage performance. As shown in Fig. S16a,† h-FeSe2@PC with a moderate FeSe2 content (62.4 wt%) presents an optimal rate capability compared to the other two samples with lower or higher FeSe2 contents. Moreover, with the increase in selenization time, the rate capability of the resulting h-FeSe2@PC exhibited an optimized sodium-storage performance, which could be associated with the thinner wall and more open multi-room structure of h-FeSe2@PC (Fig. S16b†).
4. Conclusions
We successfully synthesized cellular carbon-wrapped FeSe2 nanocavities with ultrathin walls and multiple rooms (h-FeSe2@PC) via an unusual Kirkendall effect, and revealed its stress-induced cracking–hollowing reassembly mechanism. When employed for SIBs, the h-FeSe2@PC anode delivered superior performance to other chalcogenide-based anodes reported, such as an extremely low-decay (9.5%) rate capability, ultrastable cyclability (over 2000 loops with 98.5% retention), and high energy/power densities (670.7 W h kg−1/35.3 kW kg−1) at large current densities. By analyzing the electrochemical behavior compared with ≥20 nm solid FeSe2 nanoparticles wrapped by cellular carbon (s-FeSe2@PC), we proposed a rigorous ion diffusion-confined, pseudocapacitance-controlled sodium-storage dynamics for the h-FeSe2@PC. On the one hand, sub-5 nm ultrathin FeSe2 walls in h-FeSe2@PC was within the limited diffusion regime (≤10 nm) of iron ions, which enables an impressively predominant (>93%) pseudocapacitive capacity contribution. On the other hand, the ultrafast dynamics benefits from the delicately built multi-hierarchy of h-FeSe2@PC, in which cellular carbon bridges the electron-transfer highway and the perforated multi-room nanocavities function as electrolyte supply depots ensuring continuous reactions. We anticipate that the demonstrated nanodynamics design concept would enlighten researchers to support them developing new superstructures for energy-related applications.
