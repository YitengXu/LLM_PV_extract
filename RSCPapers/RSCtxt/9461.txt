    , Accepted 19th August 2020First published on 20th August 2020AbstractA Ti3C2/CuS composite has been fabricated as a counter electrode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells by anchoring CuS nanoparticles on Ti3C2via a facile ion-exchange method at room temperature. The accordion-like Ti3C2 is well intercalated and coated with CuS nanoparticles at the optimized ratio of Ti3C2 to CuS. Both electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization measurements indicate that the composite exhibits a significantly faster electrocatalytic rate towards the polysulfide reduction than pure CuS. The quantum dot-sensitized solar cell-based composite counter electrode displays an overall power conversion efficiency of 5.11% which is 1.5 times that obtained from the CuS counter electrode. The higher power conversion efficiency benefits from the improved short-circuit current density (20.86 mA cm−2), open-circuit voltage (0.56 V) and fill factor (0.45). The enhancement of photovoltaic performance is mainly attributed to the combined advantages of the excellent conductivity of the Ti3C2 skeleton and the abundant catalytically active sites of CuS nanoparticles.
Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have received extensive interest in recent years because of their special features like low cost, easy fabrication, and excellent performance of quantum dots (QDs) such as a size-dependent bandgap, and multiple exciton generation.1,2 A typical QDSSC has a sandwich-like structure with a photoanode comprising a semiconductor oxide (TiO2, SnO2, ZnO) nanoparticle film sensitized by quantum dots, an electrolyte containing the polysulfide redox couple (S2−/Sn2−), and a counter electrode catalyzing the reduction of polysulfide ions.3
In the past few years, extensive efforts have been devoted to improving the performance of QDSSCs, including improvement in the performance of quantum dots,4,5 interface engineering and counter electrodes (CEs), and a large number of remarkable achievements have been obtained.6,7 Through the exploration of the superior colloidal QD sensitizers and interface modification engineering, the power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs has reached 13.08%.8
CEs should possess high catalytic activity and conductivity. At present, there are mainly four types of materials including noble metals, conductive polymers, carbon materials, and metal sulfides for QDSSC CEs.7,9 MXenes are a new family of transition metal carbide/nitride two-dimensional crystal materials, with a graphene-like structure. The chemical formula is Mn+1Xn, where M is an early transition metal, X is C and/or N, n = 1, 2, 3.10 The materials can be fabricated by exfoliating layered ceramic materials (MAX phases) using hydrofluoric acid. Owing to their intrinsically metallic electrical conductivity and chemical stability, they have been successfully applied to supercapacitors,11–13 lithium batteries,14–16 photocatalysis,17,18 hydrogen storage19,20 and other fields.21–24 Of about 60 kinds of MAX phases known, Ti3C2 is a typical compound25 which possesses numerous hydrophilic functional groups (–OH and –O) on its surface, enabling it to easily make strong connection with various semiconductors. Therefore, it can be used for new composite reinforcements due to its unique mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties.
This paper explores the application of Ti3C2 to QDSSC CEs due to its excellent conductivity. To date, transition metal sulfides, such as Cu2S,26–28 CoS,29,30 CuS,31,32 MoS2,33,34 and ternary cobalt spinel,35 have been applied as counter electrode materials for QDSSCs due to their properties of low resistance and high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction reaction of polysulfide. CuS is a commonly used candidate material for composite counter electrode study because of its low cost and easy synthesis. CoS/CuS,36 Au/CuS,37 CNT/CuS38 and MoS2-CuS39 have all been successfully used in QDSSCs, and the power conversion efficiencies (η) obtained by the respective composite CEs are 4.1%, 5.73%, 3.86% and 5%, respectively.
In this study, Ti3C2 has been successfully designed as the conductive skeleton for CuS nanoparticles via in situ anchoring of CuS nanoparticles on the MXene as high-performance CEs of QDSSCs. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the synthetic method of Ti3C2/CuS through an ion-exchange method at room temperature with precursors CuSO4 and Na2S for CuS. CuSO4 was mixed with an ultrasonically dispersed Ti3C2 sheet, and the Cu2+ ions can be bound on the surface of Ti3C2 due to the chemical adsorption between Cu2+ ions and the negatively charged surface functional groups (–OH, –F, –O) of Ti3C2 under constant stirring at room temperature. With the addition of Na2S solution, those Cu2+ ions bound on the surface of the Ti3C2 sheet were converted into CuS nanoparticles due to ion exchange. The nanosized CuS particles on the Ti3C2/CuS composite CE provide abundant catalytically active sites, and Ti3C2 acts as an excellent electrical tunnel for fast electron transport from the external circuit to highly catalytic CuS nanoparticles. A composite with an optimized ratio of Ti3C2 and CuS was obtained due to the combined advantages of Ti3C2 and CuS. The composite CE has an outstanding higher catalytic activity than the CuS CE toward the reduction of polysulfide electrolyte.

Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the Ti3AlC2, Ti3C2 and Ti3C2/CuS composites are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2. The transformation from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2 is firmly evidenced by the obvious shift of the (0 0 2) peak from 9.6° to 8.7° and the disappearance of the strongest diffraction peak of the (1 0 4) crystal facet of Ti3AlC2 at 39.04°. The main diffraction peaks of Ti3C2 at 2θ = 8.7°, 18.29°, 27.63°, 34.90°, 41.28° and 60.66° are presented in the pattern, which are nearly identical to those reported in ref. 18, 40 and 41. Fig. 2b shows the diffraction peaks of Ti3C2, CuS (JCPDS 79-2321) and Ti3C2/CuS in which the prominent diffraction peaks of Ti3C2 and CuS correspond to the peaks of the composite material. This proves that the Ti3C2/CuS composite was synthesized.

Fig. 3 displays the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Ti3C2 and T2C1, T1C2, and T1C3 samples (for TmCn, m and n mean that the mass ratio of Ti3C2/CuS is m:n). Fig. 3a shows the structure of Ti3C2; a loosely layered accordion-like architecture MXene with a micrometer size was made by selectively etching out the Al layers in the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase, and the interlayer spacing is about 90 nm. The anchored CuS nanoparticles with a size of 20–30 nm were deposited on the surface of Ti3C2 (Fig. 3b–d). With the increase of CuS content, the number of nanoparticles increased (Fig. 3b and c). When too many nanoparticles aggregate to form an excessively thick deposition layer, the openings between the layers of Ti3C2 are blocked and further result in the reduction of the specific surface area of the composite (Fig. 3d), which was also not conducive to the transmission of electrolytes. So, the CuS nanoparticles evenly cover on the surface of Ti3C2 at optimized mass ratio of Ti3C2 to CuS (1:2), which possible possess the largest specific surface area. To confirm this speculation, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of the samples was obtained, as shown in Fig. 4. The T1C2 composite has the highest specific surface area of 36.93 m2 g−1, compared with T1C1 (34.60 m2 g−1), T1C3 (31.35 m2 g−1), CuS (18.84 m2 g−1) and Ti3C2 (2.10 m2 g−1). The higher specific surface area of T1C2 provides more active sites and facilitates charge exchange with polysulfide ions.

Fig. S1† displays the SEM element mapping results of sample T1C2 which show that the signals of Ti, C, Cu and S originate from the Ti3C2 and CuS nanoparticles. The mapping confirms that CuS nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on Ti3C2. The morphology and structural characteristics of Ti3C2/CuS were further explored by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It can be seen that the Ti3C2 nanosheet surface is evenly covered with CuS nanoparticles (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 5b) shows that CuS nanoparticles are tightly bound to Ti3C2 nanosheets. The lattice spacing of Ti3C2 is ∼1.06 nm, which belongs to the (0 0 2) plane corresponding to 8.7° in the XRD pattern, and the lattice spacing of the nanoparticles on the Ti3C2 surface is ∼0.304 nm, which corresponds to the (1 0 2) plane of CuS in the XRD pattern.

To investigate the catalytic performances of various counter electrodes, symmetrical dummy cells were prepared by assembling two identical CEs face to face and filling the polysulfide electrolyte for EIS measurement. Fig. 6a shows the Nyquist plots of CEs. The series resistances (Rs) and the charge transfer resistances (Rct) were obtained with Zsimpwin software. As shown in Fig. 6a, the T1C3 CE gives an unsatisfactory Rct value up to 6.88 Ω, suggesting that its catalytic activity is very poor in the polysulfide electrolyte. The Rct values decrease sharply first, and then increase with the decrease of CuS content; the Rct of sample T1C2 exhibits the lowest value of 0.78 Ω, indicating that T1C2 possesses the best catalytic activity toward the reduction of polysulfide. This is mainly due to the low catalytic activity sites when the CuS content is low. When the proportion of the two is 1:2, the excellent conductivity of Ti3C2 and the sufficient catalytic activity sites of CuS reduce the interface transfer resistance to the lowest value, indicating that the composite exhibits excellent catalytic activity towards polysulfide reduction. However, when the CuS content is too high, the specific surface area of the material decreases due to the deterioration of the morphology, as shown in Fig. 3d, the number of catalytically active sites of the composite decreases, and further the catalytic activity of the composite becomes worse. In addition, Ti3C2 anchored by CuS nanoparticles improves the contact between the CE film and titanium mesh, which contributes to the decrease of Rs for all composites, but is still larger than that of the CuS CE (10.71 Ω). Moreover, it is observed in Bode plots that the characteristic response peak of Ti3C2/CuS obviously shifted to a much higher frequency region with respect to that of CuS (Fig. 4b), demonstrating a significantly faster electron transfer rate across the Ti3C2/CuS electrode/electrolyte interface. These results clearly show that the incorporation of CuS nanoparticles into the Ti3C2 exerts a positive effect on the catalytic activity of Ti3C2/CuS.

To confirm the electrocatalytic activity of Ti3C2/CuS, Tafel polarization measurements were also conducted with symmetrical dummy cells. Fig. 6c shows Tafel plots with the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of voltage (V) for the oxidation/reduction of the electrolyte. The exchange current density (J0) which represents intrinsic charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in equilibrium can be calculated from the extrapolated intercepts of two branches of the corresponding Tafel curves. As shown in Fig. 6c, the J0 values of Ti3C2/CuS CEs increase with the content of CuS nanoparticles, and when the ratio of Ti3C2 to CuS is 1:2, J0 reaches the highest value, and then the J0 values of Ti3C2/CuS decrease with the content of CuS nanoparticles. The significantly higher J0 of T1C2 CE indicates superior catalytic activity toward the polysulfide reduction, which is in good agreement with the EIS results.
Both electrochemical impedance spectroscopic and Tafel polarization measurements are in line with the difference in morphology observed in the aforementioned SEM analysis, in which CuS nanoparticles uniformly intercalate and coat on Ti3C2 when the mass ratio of Ti3C2 to CuS is 1:2. It is speculated that the unique morphology of the composites can take the performance advantages of both Ti3C2 and CuS, which makes the composites have excellent catalytic activity.
To further evaluate the catalytic activities, QDSSCs were fabricated, in which photoanodes were made of CdS/CdSe QD-sensitized TiO2 films modified with ZnSe. Fig. 6d shows the J–V plots of the QDSSCs based on various CEs at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity, and Table 1 lists the corresponding photovoltaic parameters, including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η). The cell with the pure CuS CE shows low photovoltaic performance with a maximum η of 3.26%. The cell based on T1C2 CE has a significantly high η of 5.11%, which is an efficiency more than twice that obtained from the CuS CE. The J–V results indicate a higher electrocatalytic activity of T1C2 than that of CuS and other composites, as evidenced by the high Jsc and FF since they are generally sensitive to the counter electrode properties. The enhancement of cell attributes to the T1C2 CE accelerates the charge transfer rate and reduces the electronic recombination between interfaces.

With the excellent conductivity of Ti3C2 and the high catalytic activity of CuS, T1C2 CEs have superior performance and improved Jsc (20.86 mA cm−2), Voc (0.56 V) and FF (0.45), which contributes to their better power conversion efficiency. Fig. 7 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of QDSSCs based on different CEs. Besides, QDSSCs based on the T1C2 CE show the highest IPCE value, compared with QDSSCs based on other CEs, which is in good agreement with the J–V results.

A multicycle successive CV scanning (at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. 8)) was used to evaluate the electrochemical stability of the composite and CuS. The CV plot repeatability of T1C2 is better than that of CuS, as shown in Fig. 8a and b. The insets show the CV plots only for the 1st and 50th cycle. After 50 cycles of continuous scanning, the peak current density and curve shape remain unchanged for the T1C2 electrode, which demonstrates its excellent electrochemical stability in the polysulfide electrolyte system. So, anchoring CuS nanoparticles on the accordion-like structure of Ti3C2 enhances the catalytic activity while increasing the electrochemical stability of the material. This result led us to conclude that Ti3C2/CuS can be a promising material for counter electrodes in QDSSCs.

Experimental section
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals used in this work were purchased from Aladdin (Sigma-Aldrich) and used without any further purification.
Synthesis of Ti3C2
500 mg of Ti3AlC2 was slowly added to 60 ml of 40% hydrofluoric acid. The reaction mixture was magnetically stirred for 48 hours at room temperature. The sample was then washed with deionized water and centrifuged at 10000 rpm. The process was repeated several times until the pH of the solution became neutral. Finally, the sample was dried in a vacuum at 353 K for 12 hours.17
Synthesis of Ti3C2/CuS
CuSO4 was mixed with the ultrasonically dispersed Ti3C2 flakes and stirred for 60 minutes. Then the Na2S aqueous solution was slowly added (about 5 s per drop) to the above mixture and coordinated with Cu2+ using a micro-injector, the third step. The resulting suspension was washed twice with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and then dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 10 hours. Samples of T1C1, T1C2 and T1C3 were fabricated. For TmCn, m and n mean that the mass ratio of Ti3C2/CuS is m:n. CuS was prepared by the same method without adding Ti3C2.
Preparation of Ti3C2/CuS composites electrode
The Ti3C2/CuS counter electrode was prepared by screen printing. The slurry was prepared by mixing 32 mg of Ti3C2/CuS, 8 mg of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and an appropriate amount of N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Then the slurry was screen-printed (200 mesh number) onto the titanium mesh substrate (a 80-mesh wire). Finally, the CE was dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 3 hours. The thickness of the electrode is about one layer of the thickness of the Scotch tape. The CuS CEs were prepared by the same method.
Fabrication of TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe photoanode
Porous TiO2 films were fabricated from commercial P25 TiO2 nanopowder (Aladdin Reagent China). Commercially available F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was used as a transparent conducting substrate for the preparation of TiO2 photoanodes. TiO2 films were prepared by doctor blading TiO2 paste onto the substrate and then sintering at 500 °C for 30 min in air at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.42 To synthesize and assemble QDs on TiO2 films, chemical bath deposition (CBD) was used as described previously.42,43 For CdS QDs, TiO2 films were immersed in a solution of Cd(CH3COO)2 (0.1 M) for 1 min, rinsed with deionized water, and dried with an air gun and then dipped for 1 min into 0.1 M aqueous Na2S, rinsed with deionized water, and dried with an air gun. The process was repeated for four cycles. These as-prepared electrodes are represented herein as “TiO2-(CdS)-4” electrodes. For CdSe QDs, the TiO2-(CdS)-4 electrodes were dipped into a solution of Cd2+ (0.1 M) for 1 min at room temperature and then immersed into 0.2 M aqueous Na2SeSO3 for 0.5 h at 50 °C, followed by rinsing with deionized water and drying. The process was repeated up to 38 cycles. These as-prepared electrodes are represented herein as TiO2-(CdS)-4-(CdSe)-8 electrodes. The TiO2-(CdS)-4-(CdSe)-8 electrodes were immersed in a solution of Zn(NO3)2 (0.1 M) and NaHSe (0.1 M) for 2 min in a glove box of N2 to obtain TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe photoanodes.26
Assembly of QDSSCs
The fabricated TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe photoanodes and CEs were sealed to obtain a sandwich QDSSC using a hot melt sealing sheet (60 μm, Surlyn 1702, DuPont).44 The internal spaces around the cells were filled with a redox electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in a methanol-to-water ratio of 7:3. The active area of the cell was 0.25 cm2.
Characterization
XRD patterns were obtained by using a Pgeneral XD-30 system with Cu kα radiation. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Quanta 250F) attached with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to investigate the morphology and elemental composition of the composite. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed with a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope operated at 200 kV (Cs 0.5 mm, point resolution 1.9 Å). Images were recorded with a Gatan CCD camera. Nitrogen sorption isotherms were obtained on an automatic N2 adsorption/desorption instrument (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). The specific surface areas of the materials were calculated by the Brunauere–Emmette–Teller (BET) method. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization measurements (Tafel) and photovoltaic performances were carried out using an electrochemical system (Ivium-N-Stat Multichannel potentiostat). The current–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of QDSSCs were recorded under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using a HGILX500 Technologies (China) solar simulator, which was calibrated with a commercially available standard crystalline silicon solar cell. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of QDSCs was measured using a Solar Cell Quantum Efficiency-Solar Cell Scan 100 (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd).
Conclusions
CuS nanoparticles were successfully anchored on the accordion-like structure of Ti3C2via a facile ion-exchange method at room temperature. The optimized Ti3C2/CuS composite as the efficient counter electrode exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability in the quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. With the favorable catalytic activity of CuS nanoparticles as well as the excellent charge transport provided by Ti3C2, the QDSSC based on the optimized Ti3C2/CuS CE shows high electrochemical performance with a Jsc, Voc, FF, and η of 20.86 mA cm−2, 0.56 V, 0.45 and 5.11%, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pure CuS CE. Our study opens up a new application field for the MXene family and also introduces a more promising candidate for developing high-efficiency CEs in QDSSCs.
