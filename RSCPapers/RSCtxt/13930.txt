    , Accepted 17th September 2018First published on 17th September 2018AbstractSolar steam generation is a promising solar energy conversion technology due to its potential applications in water treatment, liquid–liquid phase separation, and sterilization. Therefore, finding highly efficient solar-thermal conversion materials and structures is highly desirable. Here, we developed a membrane consisting of a narrow bandgap semiconductor of CuFeSe2 nanoparticles (NPs) decorated wood (coded as black wood membrane), for high-efficiency solar steam generation. The CuFeSe2 NPs display a desirable narrow bandgap of 0.45 eV, and can be used as a novel light absorbing material for highly efficient solar-thermal conversion. Wood served as the substrate for the CuFeSe2 NPs due to its excellent properties: a mesoporous structure, low density, heat-localization, low thermal conductivity, high hydrophilicity, and cost-effectiveness. All the properties of the designed CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane make it an ideal absorber for solar steam generation, allowing it to achieve a high solar thermal efficiency of 86.2% under 5 kW m−2. Moreover, the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane is cost-efficient and scalable, making it a fantastic material for various applications involving light absorption, photothermal conversion, and water purification.
Introduction
Steam generation through the efficient harvesting of solar energy has promising applications in areas such as power generation,1 desalination,2–8 water purification,9–12 liquid–liquid phase separation,12,13 and sterilization.14 Traditional methods of generating steam from solar energy depend strongly on the ability of the absorbers to transfer the energy of absorbed light directly to nearby water to generate steam. Most of the existing solar steam generation systems suffer from poor efficiency because they often lose heat to bulk water and the surrounding environment. Various heat localization absorbers have recently been designed to confine heat at the evaporation surface, significantly improving the steam-generation efficiency when compared to conventional heating methods.15–20 Most of the approaches to heat localization are primarily focused on exploring photo-thermal materials with high solar spectrum absorption. While metallic nanoparticles (NPs),15,16 carbon materials,17–19 and plasmonic materials20 have proven to be able to enhance the solar absorption efficiency, there are some challenges that still need to be addressed such as complex fabrication methods, poor prospects of scalability, and the material cost. Hence, there is an urgent need for cost-effective and scalable heat-localization materials that can provide high solar steam generation efficiency.
Because of its excellent chemical and physical properties including low toxicity, low cost, high conversion efficiency, and absorption coefficients, CuFeSe2 as a ternary chalcogenide has been widely utilized within the fields of optoelectronics and solar energy conversion.21,22 In addition, CuFeSe2 NPs also possess a desirable narrow bandgap of 0.45 eVs, which endows CuFeSe2 NPs with the ability to absorb solar energy from the full spectrum range. Moreover, CuFeSe2 is a low-cost, abundant semiconductor containing Cu, Fe, and Se elements. Compared with other plasmonic metals such as Au, Pt, Ag, et al.,20 the narrow bandgap semiconductor of CuFeSe2 is more competitive in terms of cost and scalability for practical and scalable applications.
Herein we develop a black wood membrane combining the narrow bandgap semiconductor of CuFeSe2 NPs with a multi-channeled and thermally insulating wooden membrane decorated with CuFeSe2 NPs for highly efficient solar steam generation and water purification. Due to its broad band, efficient solar absorption, low density, inherently low thermal conductivity, and naturally aligned microchannels for transporting water, the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane has proven to be a fantastic solar absorber with a high solar-thermal efficiency of 67.7% under 1 kW m−2 and 86.2% under 5 kW m−2. Moreover, drinkable clean water which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standards can be collected with our solar steam device.23 These results demonstrate that the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane is a promising material for a robust, scalable, and low-cost absorber with promising applications in efficient solar steam generation and water purification.
Results and discussion
The CuFeSe2 NPs were obtained from the reaction of metallic acetylacetonates (Cu(acac)2 and Fe(acac)3) with diphenyl diselenide (Ph2Se2) in oleyl amine and oleic acid at 265 °C for 1.5 h. The sample was collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 4 min) and washed several times with absolute ethanol and petroleum ether to remove the excess oleylamine on the surface of the CuFeSe2 NPs. Finally, the prepared CuFeSe2 nanoparticles were dispersed among trichloromethane for further use.22 The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses were then carried out to verify the composition and confirm the presence of the three elements in the CuFeSe2 NPs (Fig. S1 and Table S1†). The results show that the molar ratio of Cu, Fe, and Se elements within the synthesized CuFeSe2 NPs is 1.00:0.95:1.98, which is consistent with the stoichiometric composition of CuFeSe2. In addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization and detailed discussion are shown in Fig. S2.† It can be proven that the valence states of Cu, Fe, and Se elements are +1, +3, and −2, respectively.22 The phase of the prepared CuFeSe2 NPs is characterized by power X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. S3† shows that all the diffraction peaks agree with the standard data of tetragonal phase CuFeSe2 in form JCPDS no. 81-1959, demonstrating that the prepared CuFeSe2 NPs are of good crystallinity and high purity.
The eskebornite CuFeSe2 NPs display a trigonal structure (a = b = 5.15 Å; c = 13.61 Å) with an R3c space group (Fig. 1a). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to further investigate the band features of CuFeSe2 NPs based on the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) exchange calculation method. CuFeSe2 is a correlated system with a large Coulomb interaction due to the partially filled Cu-3d and Fe-3d orbital. Thus, we employed the DFT plus U approach to overcome the underestimate of Coulomb interaction in our DFT calculations.24,25 The density of states (DOS) and the partial density of states (PDOS) are plotted in Fig. 1b. The valence band around the Fermi energy level is mainly dominated by Cu-3d, Fe-3d and Se-4p, which indicates that there is a strong hybridization between Cu-3d, Fe-3d and Se-4p.26 The conduction band is mainly comprised of the Fe-3d orbital. The bandgap of CuFeSe2 is 0.45 eV. The small bandgap enables CuFeSe2 NPs to have the ability to absorb the solar energy from the full spectrum range.27,28 Most photons from solar emissions have significantly higher energy than the bandgap of CuFeSe2 NPs, which leads to the generation of electron–hole pairs in CuFeSe2 NPs under solar irradiation. The electrons and holes then relax to the band edges, converting the extra energy into heat by the thermalization process28 shown in Fig. 1c.

(b) PDOS/DOS of CuFeSe2 NPs derived from first-principles calculations. (c) Simulation of photo-thermal conversion of narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NPs. (d) The prepared narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NPs were supported on a piece of wood to form the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane which was then used for efficient solar steam generation. The plasmonic effect of the CuFeSe2 NPs on the surface of the wood causes CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane to appear black (black wood). The magnified image shows the mesostructure of the black wood which contains many channels in the wood and the NPs were coated on the surface of the wood. 
The fantastic light absorption property of CuFeSe2 NPs provides unique opportunities for the development of highly efficient photo-thermal conversion systems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the use of narrow bandgap material CuFeSe2 NPs for solar steam generation (Fig. 1d). In our design, a thin layer of CuFeSe2 NPs was supported on the surface of a piece of basswood to form a CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane (black wood). Wood was chosen as a supporting substrate because of following unique advantages: (1) a naturally hydrophilic nature (Fig. S4†), (2) numerous aligned microchannels for high flux water transport, (3) low thermal conductivity along the channel axis direction under the dry or wet state (0.12 or 0.525 W m−1 K−1, Fig. S5†), (4) excellent mechanical properties,29,30 (5) superior stability in water,31 and (6) a low cost. The magnified image exhibits the mesostructure of the black wood which contains many channels. These channels are devoted to localizing heat and transporting water from the bulk to the photo-thermal active layer at the evaporative surface.
The morphology of the prepared CuFeSe2 NPs was studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As displayed in Fig. 2a, the CuFeSe2 NPs present a monodisperse and have an average size distribution of about 5 nm based on a statistic histogram (Fig. S6†). The (111) lattice plane of CuFeSe2, with an interplanar distance of 0.274 nm, is shown in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 2b. As shown in Fig. 2c and S7,† a piece of basswood was cut along the growth direction. It was decorated with CuFeSe2 NPs by vacuum strategy. It was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight (see the Experimental section for details). Cellulose and hemicellulose are the major constituents of wood. They each have abundant hydroxyl groups which can result in strong bonding between the CuFeSe2 NPs and the wood surface. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) shows that the stretching band of CuFeSe2 NPs at 613 cm−1 moved to 592 cm−1 which demonstrates the Fe–O formation between CuFeSe2 and the hydroxyl groups of cellulose in wood (Fig. S8†).32 This confirms the interaction between the CuFeSe2 NPs and hydroxyl groups of the cellulose/hemicellulose of wood.

(c) The photo images of the CuFeSe2 NPs dispersed in TCM, natural wood, and CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane. (d) The CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane was cut along the growth direction to show that only the surface of the wood is black, the inner side of the wood is the natural color of wood, thereby highlighting that CuFeSe2 NPs are evenly distributed on the surface of the wood block. (e) SEM image of the wood surface show the mesoporous microstructures of wood. The inset shows the TEM image of CuFeSe2 NPs on the surface of the wood. (f) The SEM image of the long channels in wood which are highlighted with a red dashed line. 
The wooden block changed from yellow to black due to strong light absorption by the prepared nanoparticles anchored on the surface of the wood. Following the deposition of CuFeSe2 NPs on the wooden surface, the bilayer structure is evident and can be seen in Fig. 2d. The CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane in the figure was cut for a better view of the inside. It shows that the surface of the wood is black while the inner side keeps its original color. The thickness of the CuFeSe2 NPs coating layer was determined to be about 0.5 μm. Fig. 2e shows the SEM image of the wood surface which depicts the highly porous microstructure of wood. The inset shows the TEM image of CuFeSe2 NPs on the surface of the wood. It is well known that wood cells exhibit a cylindrical structure and growth parallel to the trunk of the tree (Fig. 2f).31,33–36 These microchannels form a porous matrix allowing for the transportation of water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves.
The light absorption performance of the black wood and natural wood were experimentally measured by extinction spectrum. The black wood membrane exhibited broadband light absorption up to 99% over nearly the whole measured wavelength range. The light absorption is noticeably much higher than natural wood (Fig. 3a). The broadband optical absorption of the black wood membrane has an appreciable overlap with the solar spectrum inducing a significant temperature increase under solar irradiation. To illustrate this, the photothermal performance of the black and natural wood under 1 kW m−2 solar illumination in a dry state was monitored with an infrared radiation (IR) camera. As shown in Fig. 3b, the temperature of the black wood membrane rapidly increased from 20.1 °C to around 62 °C, however, the temperature of the natural wood reached about 41.7 °C under the same irradiation conditions. The higher temperature of the black wood membrane compared with the natural wood indicates the high optical absorption and effective photo-thermal conversion efficiency of the black wood membrane under solar illumination. On the other hand, the temperature of the black wood membrane under wet state increased to 30.1 °C (Fig. 3c). The small rise in temperature of the black wood membrane in its wet state compared to the dry state under the same solar irradiation indicates that the water evaporation consumes the solar energy. The IR images of the temperatures of dry black and natural wood increasing are shown in Fig. 3d.

Subsequently, we systematically investigated the solar steam generation performance of the black wood membrane. Fig. 4a shows digital images of the steam generation experimental set-up. The black wood membrane floating on the surface of the water was exposed to various simulated solar irradiation (from 1 sun to 5 suns). We observed that the column of water vapor steam expanded when the solar illumination density increased. This indicated the water evaporation rate gets faster with an increase in the intensity of solar illumination. The combination of the broadband light spectrum efficient absorption, localized liquid–vapor phase change, and the porous network structure enables the black wood membrane absorber particularly suitable for the solar steam generation process (Fig. 4b).

(h) The measured concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in actual seawater samples from the South China Sea, each with an average salinity of ∼1.05 wt%, before and after desalination with the black wood membrane under 1 kW m−2. 
The evolution of temperature for the natural wood and black wood floated on the surface of the water under solar irradiation of 5 kW m−2 is shown in Fig. 4c. The results show that the temperature of the black wood floating on water increased from 20 °C to 51.5 °C within an irradiation time of 400 s. On the other side, the temperature of natural wood and bulk water increased to 36.5 °C and 28.5 °C, respectively. The temperature increasing processes on the surface of the black wood and natural wood under different irradiations are shown in Fig. S9 and S10.† The temperature distribution of the wet black wood under different solar illumination intensities was detected with IR camera (Fig. 4d). Under 1, 2, 3, and 5 suns, stable top surface temperatures of 30.2, 35.3, 41.1, 51.5 °C, respectively, were established. The high temperature was localized on the top of the evaporation surface at all illumination intensities, which is helpful for the high-efficiency solar steam generation.
The changes in mass over time and under different optical concentrations (Copt) are shown in Fig. S11.† These changes were independent of the black wood absorbers. Fig. 4e shows the evaporation rates (E.R.s) vs. the optical concentrations (Copt) of pure water, natural wood, and black wood. It is apparent from our observations that steam generation with the black wood membrane is more efficient than natural wood under identical optical concentrations. For example, the evaporation rate with the black wood membrane reaches ∼6.6 kg m−2 h−1 under Copt = 5, which is 5.2 times greater than that of bulk water.
The corresponding solar steam generation efficiency (η) can be calculated by the following equation: η = ṁhLV/CoptP0(1)where ṁ (units: kg m−2 h−1) denotes the E.R., hLV is the total enthalpy of the liquid–vapor phase transition (including the sensible heat), Copt is the optical concentration, and P0 represents the nominal solar illumination value of 1 kW m−2. The dark field mass change was measured and subtracted from the subsequent solar steam measurements. The thermal efficiency of solar steam generation under various values of Copt is shown in Fig. 4f. The result indicates that the steam generation efficiency of the black wood membrane increases from 67.7% at 1 sun illumination to 86.2% at an illumination of 5 suns. The detail information of energy balance was analyzed in ESI.† This demonstrates one of the higher solar steam generation values among other devices.37–46 Control experiments with pure water under various Copt were also measured. To demonstrate this difference, an enhancement factor (E.F.) was calculated and plotted against the various Copt (Fig. S12†). The E.F. considers the water evaporation rate (E.R.), independent of the black wood. A large enhancement factor of up to 5.5 was achieved. This finding is higher than values previously reported using metal nanoparticles for solar steam generation.2,47
The stability is another important aspect of solar steam generation absorption. The prepared CuFeSe2 NPs are in good agreement with eskebornite which is very stable and ubiquitous within the environment. The strong bonding between CuFeSe2 NPs and the hydroxyl of cellulose in wood enable the assembled CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane to avoid detachment and agglomeration. Therefore, the black wood membrane could maintain a high and stable evaporation rate for 25 hours (1 hour for each cycle) under 5 suns of illumination (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, the desalination effects of the black wood were evaluated using water sample from the South China Sea with the ions of Na+, Mg2+, K+, and Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 4h, the concentrations for Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ ions within the solar steam treated water samples were 4.18, 0.71, 2.45 and 3.05 mg L−1, respectively. These ion concentrations are much lower compared to the initial salty water (South China Sea) and meet the WHO standard.23
At the same time, the concentration of Cu, Fe, and Se is lower than WHO standard (Table S2†).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed a cost-effective and scalable black wood membrane with a CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood for highly efficient solar steam generation and water purification. The CuFeSe2 NPs possess a desirable narrow bandgap (0.45 eV) which endows them with an ability to absorb solar energy in the full spectrum range. In addition, the wood substrate acts as an excellent supporting material in the designed black wood membrane. This is because of wood's naturally occurring multi-channeled porous structure, high hydrophilicity, low thermal conductivity, and low cost. The combination of narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NPs with mesoporous and thermally insulating wood gives the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane a high light absorption of 99% over a wide spectrum range, a fast water transport time, and an excellent thermal management ability with heat localization. Consequently, a high steam-generation efficiency of 86.2% under 5 kW m−2 can be achieved. Moreover, the collected clean water is highly pure which allows it to potentially meet the WHO standard well. Because of its high efficiency, straightforward fabrication, and abundant materials, the novel black wood membrane is a fantastic candidate for a solar steam generation and seawater desalination system.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
Copper(II)acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2), iron(III)acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3), 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, diphenyl ether, diphenyl diselenide, and oleylamine were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used directly.
Synthesis of CuFeSe2 NPs
Cu(acac)2 (1 mmol) and Fe(acac)3 (2 mmol) were dispersed in mixture solution of oleylamine (15 mL) and diphenyl ether (15 mL), and then stirred under nitrogen atmosphere. The reagent was dehydrated at 110 °C for 1.5 h, then heated to 265 °C for 1 h. The diphenyl diselenide (1 mmol) was dispersed in oleylamine (1 mL), the mixture of diphenyl diselenide and oleylamine was injected in the reaction system immediately and reacted for 1.0 h to obtain CuFeSe2 NPs. The CuFeSe2 NPs were separated by addition of ethanol (50 mL) and centrifuging. Then the nanoparticles were washed with the mixed solution of ethanol and petroleum ether several times to remove the excess oleylamine on the surface of CuFeSe2 NPs. Finally, the prepared nanoparticles were dispersed in chloroform.
Preparation of CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane
CuFeSe2 NPs were dispersed in chloroform with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1. A piece of wood with the dimension of 5 cm by 5 cm by 0.5 cm was immersed in the mono-dispersed CuFeSe2 NPs chloroform solution and treated by vacuum until the surface of the wood changed to black.
Measurements and characterizations
The morphology of the CuFeSe2 NPs and CuFeSe2 NPs/wood membrane were characterized by emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI, Sirion 200). TEM measurements were taken with a JEM-2100 at 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were tested on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation (l = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using a PHI-5702 multifunctional spectrometer with AlKα radiation. The contact angles of the droplets were measured using a contact goniometer (OCA-15 EC, Beijing Eastern-Dataphy Instrument Inc., China). UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra were carried out on an Agilent Cary 5000 Spectrophotometer. FT-IR characterization was tested on a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer. The thermal conductivity was carried out by a steady-state method with homemade test equipment.40
Experiment for steam generation
All of the solar steam generation experiments were tested by using a multi-functional solar simulator (NBeT HSX-UV300). The irradiation intensity was adjusted by controlling the power of the solar simulator and the distance of the optical lens. The optical power meter (Newport 843-R) with thermopile sensors (Newport 919P-010-16) was utilized to precisely record the optical intensity on the surface of natural and black wood samples. The temperature was measured using an IR camera (Fotric 226) which is able to detect IR radiation at wavelengths from 1 to 5.4 μm, has a sensor resolution of 320 by 256 pixels, and is connected to a computer via ThermaCAM Researcher software. The weight loss from evaporation was measured by an electronic microbalance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg. The wood sample with a dimension of 5 cm by 5 cm by 0.5 cm was floating on the surface of the water. The irradiation area was about 2.25 cm2.
Experiment for sea water desalination
The solar desalination experiments were conducted under 1 kW m−2. The sea water is from South China Sea, each with an average salinity of ∼1.05 wt%. The concentrations of Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ ions before and after desalination were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Perkin-Elmer Elan DRC II). The clean water is collected according to previous report.2

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The schematic illustration of narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane for efficient solar steam generation. (a) Schematic representation of the CuFeSe2 corundum unit cell. (b) PDOS/DOS of CuFeSe2 NPs derived from first-principles calculations. (c) Simulation of photo-thermal conversion of narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NPs. (d) The prepared narrow bandgap CuFeSe2 NPs were supported on a piece of wood to form the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane which was then used for efficient solar steam generation. The plasmonic effect of the CuFeSe2 NPs on the surface of the wood causes CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane to appear black (black wood). The magnified image shows the mesostructure of the black wood which contains many channels in the wood and the NPs were coated on the surface of the wood.	 

 	Fig. 2  Characterization of the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane. (a) The TEM image of CuFeSe2 NPs. The NPs, with an average size of 5 nm, display a mono-disperse in trichloromethane. (b) The HRTEM image exhibits the (111) lattice plane of CuFeSe2 with an interplanar distance of 0.274 nm. The inset shows the corresponding SAED pattern of CuFeSe2 NPs. (c) The photo images of the CuFeSe2 NPs dispersed in TCM, natural wood, and CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane. (d) The CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane was cut along the growth direction to show that only the surface of the wood is black, the inner side of the wood is the natural color of wood, thereby highlighting that CuFeSe2 NPs are evenly distributed on the surface of the wood block. (e) SEM image of the wood surface show the mesoporous microstructures of wood. The inset shows the TEM image of CuFeSe2 NPs on the surface of the wood. (f) The SEM image of the long channels in wood which are highlighted with a red dashed line.	 

 	Fig. 3  Optical and thermal properties of the black wood membrane. (a) The light absorption spectra for the CuFeSe2 NP-decorated wood membrane and natural wood. The black wood membrane absorbs nearly all the incident light over the entire wavelength range. (b) The temperature increasing process of the dry black and natural wood under 1 kW m−2 illumination. (c) The temperature increasing process of the black and natural wood at under 1 kW m−2 illumination and in wet states. (d) IR images showing the temperature of the black and natural wood under 1 kW m−2 irradiation and in dry states at various time points.	 

 	Fig. 4  Solar desalination performance of the black wood membrane. (a) Photographs showing vapor columns under various illuminations. (b) Schematic of the black wood membrane for efficient solar steam generation. (c) The temperature increasing process of the wet black and natural wood under 5 kW m−2 h−1. (d) IR images showing the temperature distribution of the black wood membrane at different illumination intensities. (e) The dependence of the evaporation rate of the black wood membrane on different Copt. (f) The Solar steam efficiency of the black wood membrane for different values of Copt. (g) The water evaporation stability of the black wood membrane under a sun irradiation of 5 over 25 hours (1 hour for each cycle). (h) The measured concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ in actual seawater samples from the South China Sea, each with an average salinity of ∼1.05 wt%, before and after desalination with the black wood membrane under 1 kW m−2.
