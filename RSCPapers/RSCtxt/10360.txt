    , Accepted 29th July 2021First published on 29th July 2021AbstractA better replacement of electrocatalytic platinum on counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has received increasing attention to achieve a balance between efficient charge transfer and cost-effectiveness. Using an electrochemical polymerization method, a polymeric layer of poly(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spirobi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]), called poly(spiroBiProDOT), was fabricated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) counter electrode. For comparison, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), called PEDOT, a polymer layer and Pt were also deposited on the FTO counter electrode. Photovoltaic characterizations of the fabricated solar cells based on poly(spiroBiProDOT), PEDOT, and Pt counter electrodes were performed, and maximum power conversion efficiencies of 7.9%, 6.8%, and 8.31% were achieved, respectively. Poly(spiroBiProDOT) exhibits a stronger competitiveness to replace Pt in comparison with PEDOT. The competitiveness mainly comes from the better charge transfer in poly(spiroBiProDOT) due to its ordered thiophene moiety connected by a spiro linkage, which can increase the photocurrent density, and therefore, the cell efficiency. Electron density calculation, microstructural characterization, and impedance analysis were performed to rationalize the better efficiency of poly(spiroBiProDOT).
1. Introduction
Power generation from sustainable energy resources has become an essential technology for the development of better colonization and carbon neutralization in future generation to reduce the greenhouse effect.1 Out of numerous renewable energy systems, solar energy is showing much more potential for energy utilization because of its cleanliness, abundant availability on earth, and climate friendliness.2 There are two major technologies from which solar energy can be harvested and converted into power generation. Among them, the photovoltaic solar technique becomes more useful and commercially convenient from which photon energy is converted into electrical energy using semiconductor panels.3 Nonetheless, solar thermal technology has also been used to directly convert heat from the sun into mechanical or electrical energy.4 Solar technology can be classified into three major types based on the semiconductor used for the construction of solar panels.5 First-generation solar panels are wafer-based crystalline silicon6 or polysilicon, while the second generation consists of thin films of amorphous silicon,7,8 CdTe (cadmium telluride),9,10 CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide),11,12etc. The second-generation solar panels are generally used for the manufacturing of photovoltaic power stations. However, third-generation solar cells based on multilayer thin-film technology are still under the developing phase for commercial use.13 To develop low-cost, effective and environmentally friendly solar cells, Grätzel et al. designed so-called dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which incorporated a photoactive titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer carrying a ruthenium complex sensitizer on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass, a counter electrode with a platinum layer, and an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte.14 In the DSSC configuration, the platinum-layered counter electrode encourages two important mechanisms. First, the superb electrocatalytic property of platinum is useful for the regeneration of dyes by catalyzing I−/I3− ions in the redox couple system.15 Second, the charge transfer process with better efficiency has been observed by applying a platinum layer on a counter electrode.16–19 Studies on the modification of TiO2 nanoparticles in a form of quantum-dot TiO220 and trifunctional TiO221 with exposed {001} facets to improve the cell efficiency have been carried out. Platinum has been recognized as a typical electrocatalyst,22–24 yet the main drawbacks are the cost-effectiveness and high chances of corrosion in the presence of I−/I3− electrolytes. In order to resolve these problems, researchers have been using graphite and carbon black to replace platinum electrodes in liquid-type DSSCs.25–28 Other promising candidates such as metallic sulfides,29,30 oxides,31 carbides,32–38 and nitrides39–44 have also been incorporated and examined instead of the platinum layer. Nonetheless, the main breakthrough has come after replacing platinum with conducting polymers.45,46 Efficient photovoltaic parameters were characterized by fabricating the solar cells with PEDOT47 or PEDOT/PSS-based conducting polymer layers on metal oxides.48–52 Basically, PEDOT is the polymerized form of monomeric unit of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, which can be synthesized by chemical-oxidation or electropolymerization methods.53 An optimistic research work has already been developed on DSSCs after employing nanoporous PEDOT because of its cost-effectiveness, better electrochemical activity, stability and better catalytic activity. In 2010, Nazeeruddin et al. synthesized a PEDOT nanoporous layer using an electro-oxidative polymerization method at room temperature in the presence of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMITFSI) as an oxidizing agent. A maximum cell efficiency of 7.93% with Voc of 0.693 V, Jsc of 15 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.76 was achieved after incorporating the PEDOT nanoporous layer to replace Pt.54 Oxidative polymerization of EDOT was also carried out in the presence of oxidants such as iodine vapor,55 ferric(III) chloride,56 molybdenum(V) chloride,57 and ammonium persulphate58 for synthesizing the PEDOT nanoporous layers. However, in the electropolymerization method, PEDOT films were developed after dissolving EDOT monomers in halogenated solvents and applying optimized current and voltages. In this method, an optimized voltage and input current played an important role in getting better polymerization on the FTO glass surface. Special precautions should be taken for the polymerization of EDOT monomers, inevitably increasing the experimental time and fabrication cost. However, this problem was surmounted by Li et al. by utilizing a simple electropolymerization method for the fabrication of PEDOT polymers on the FTO glass after optimizing the voltage under direct-current power supply.47 A comparison has been made with respect to photovoltaic parameters between the cells incorporating PEDOT and platinum as the catalyst, and maximum cell efficiencies of 6.401% and 6.493% were achieved, respectively, which were comparable to each other.
In this study, a nanoporous layer of poly(2H,2′H,4H,4′H-3,3′-spirobi[thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine]), called poly(spiroBiProDOT), was fabricated on the conductive surface of an FTO glass at optimized applied voltage and DC current via electropolymerization53 in an electrochemical cell under an inert atmosphere. Photovoltaic characterizations of liquid-type solar cells constructed with modified spiroBiProDOT-layered FTO glass (FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT)) were performed. To get a fair comparison, a PEDOT [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)] nanoporous layer on the FTO glass (FTOPEDOT) was also fabricated at the same optimized voltage and DC current for liquid-type solar cells. Nonetheless, a standard reference cell was also manufactured by applying a platinum-layered FTO glass (FTOPt). Maximum cell efficiencies of 7.9% (Jsc of 14.76 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.726 V, and FF of 0.73) and 6.8% (Jsc of 12.68 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V, and FF of 0.72) were achieved for the solar cells employing FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT) and FTOPEDOT conducting glass under 1 sun illumination. At the same intensity of light, a maximum cell efficiency of 8.26% was achieved by applying the reference FTOPt conducting glass. Scanning electron microscopy was used to understand the nano-porous nature of poly(spiroBiProDOT) and [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)], respectively. Theoretical calculation of single repeating units of spiroBiProDOT and EDOT was carried out using the Gaussian software to realize the electronic structural properties and quantify the band gap. The main object of this study is to understand the reinforcement of charge transportation as well as enhanced photovoltaic parameters with respect to a higher number of oxythiophene units connected with SP3 carbon in a poly(spiroBiProDOT) nanoporous layer compared to a PEDOT layer on the FTO glass. This study is also helpful to understand the feasibility of the poly(spiroBiProDOT) layer in place of a costly platinum layer for fabricating DSSCs with lower budget.
2. Experimental procedure
2.1. Material and reagents
Reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Matrix Scientific, SHOWA, TCI, and ACROS organic. Purchased chemicals and reagents were used without further purification. SpiroBiProDOT was synthesized following the reported procedure.53,59,60 Dry solvents and inert atmosphere were maintained for every chemical and electrochemical reaction. For the purification of organic compounds, distilled solvents were used. For the recrystallization process, a dry solvent was used. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate and EDOT were used directly without purification.
2.2. Electropolymerization reactions and characterizations
A CH (CHI611E) instrument was used for electropolymerization of the polymer on the FTO glass (2.2 mm thick, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) in a four-chambered 250 mL glassy cell. A silver (Ag/AgCl) wire as a pseudo reference electrode, an FTO glass side as a working electrode, a platinum flag as a counter electrode were immersed into the solution of monomers through three chambers of the cell, respectively, under an inert atmosphere. For the spiroBiProDOT (0.1 mol) monomer, acetonitrile/toluene (4:1) was used as a solvent (100 mL). However, for EDOT (0.1 mol), only acetonitrile was used as a solvent. Another chamber was used for the addition of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. DC power supply was applied for the electropolymerization on the FTO glass. Initially, 1.1 V was applied for 10 min followed by 10 V for 20 min at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1. Dark blue and blue colour of films were observed on the FTO glass for poly(spiroBiProDOT) and PEDOT polymers, respectively. After electropolymerization, all the polymer-layered FTO glass samples were taken out carefully from the glass cell followed by drying at 60 °C for 3 h. For measuring the thickness of the polymer film on the FTO counter electrode, a surface texture measuring instrument (SURFCOM 130A, Accretech, Tokyo Seimitsu) was used. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS Ultra Plus, Europe) was used for the microstructural observation of the polymeric films. 1H NMR spectrum of monomeric spiroBiProDOT was recorded using Varian 400 MR and Varian Mercury Plus 400 spectrometers, with CDCl3 [the chemical shifts were reported in ppm, parts per million with respect to reference TMS (0 ppm) shift].
2.3. DSSC fabrication
A TiO2 photoanode was fabricated by screen-printing a 12 μm thick TiO2 mesoporous film on an FTO glass using a commercial TiO2 paste (Ti–Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) with a fixed 0.16 cm2 printed area. The sintering process was performed at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min, and was cooled naturally to room temperature.61–63 The sintered TiO2 photoanode was immersed in an N719 dye solution (0.4 mM in EtOH solvent) for 4 h for the adsorption of dye on the TiO2 photoactive layer. After adsorption of dye, the photoanode was assembled with an FTO glass covered with a polymeric (poly(spiroBiProDOT) or PEDOT) layer in a face-to-face manner and sealed with a 25 μm thick Surlyn film by clips. A laboratory-prepared liquid electrolyte (0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, 0.2 M PMII, 0.5 M TBP, 0.2 M TBAI in acetonitrile/valeronitrile with a 85:15 volume ratio) was injected into the space gap between two electrodes via a predrilled pinhole in the counter electrode. For comparison, reference cells employing a conventional Pt-covered FTO glass as the counter electrode were fabricated following the same assembling process, and the preparation details of the Pt layer were mentioned elsewhere.61,62
2.4. Photovoltaic characterization
Photovoltaic characterizations were performed under 1.5G (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2) illumination utilizing a solar simulator (YSS-E40 Yamashita Denso Corp., Japan). A solar cell QE/IPCE measurement system (QE-3000, Titan Electro-Optics Co., Ltd, Taiwan) was used for the characterization of incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency of constructed DSSC cells. Electron impedance spectra were recorded employing a potentiostat instrument (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab B.V., Netherlands) with an applied bias of 0.75 V under dark conditions and operated with an AC current of 10 mV amplitude within the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
The monomeric unit of spiroBiProDOT was aptly selected because of its core structure, where two alkylenedioxy thiophene units were connected through SP3 carbon atoms.53 However, the dihedral angle between two alkylenedioxy units can be tailored by substitution of thiophenyl active –C–H reported previously.53 Furthermore, it has already been specifically reported that after polymerization, the thiophene units of spiroBiProDOT were attributed to get a coplanar structure. This specific electronic structure of the thiophene unit of monomeric spiroBiProDOT within the same plane has been considered, because this flexibility could enhance the probability of charge carrier throughout its polymeric structure. The synthesis details of the monomeric unit of spiroBiProDOT are shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Synthesis of spiroBiProDOT and electropolymerization of poly(spiroBiProDOT) and PEDOT. 
Initially, polymerization of monomeric spiroBiProDOT was carried out by applying 1.1 V for 10 min and 10 V for 20 min sequentially. A similar experiment was carried out for EDOT polymerization. It was reported that dimerization and polymerization of EDOT were carried out at 1.1 V and 10 V, respectively.47 According to the report, monomeric EDOT was observed on the FTO surface as the EDOT˙+ cation radical at 1.1 V, whereas polymerization occurred after applying 20 V potential followed by the radical polymerization reaction.47
In this work, at 10 V voltage, a dark blue color thin film was developed on the surface of the FTO glass, while polymerizing the spiroBiProDOT monomer. However, a sky-blue color was observed in case of the polymerization of EDOT on the FTO glass. Upon further increasing the voltage, black precipitates aggregated on the FTO conducting surface. The thickness of the polymeric layer was measured carefully and found to be nearly 4.2–4.5 μm and 1.9–2.3 μm for spiroBiProDOT and PEDOT layers, respectively, on the FTO glass. The thickness of poly(spiroBiProDOT) was optimized by taking the deposition time as a variable. Basically, the thickness of the poly(spiroBiProDOT) layer on the FTO glass was increased proportionally with the deposition time. The photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding solar cells employing poly(spiroBiProDOT) with different thicknesses are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
The thickness of the polymer on the FTO glass plays a vital role in maintaining the charge transfer resistance between the polymer and the FTO glass. Therefore, an optimized thickness of the polymeric layer should be achieved to get proper charge transfer throughout the cell. Molecular weights of 312.0490 g mol−1 and 142.1720 g mol−1 were calculated for spiroBiProDOT and EDOT monomers, respectively. The higher molecular weight of spiroBiProDOT could be a reason for the higher thickness of poly(spiroBiProDOT) polymers on the FTO glass rather than that of the PEDOT polymer by applying the same applied potential in the electropolymerization method.
To understand the electron density and band gap of both polymers, theoretical calculation was performed by applying the Gaussian program using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) model for dimeric units of spiroBiProDOT and EDOT monomers, respectively. Electronic structures of spiroBiProDOT containing the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are shown in Fig. 2. The electron density was found to be maximum in allylic carbon atoms (C-2 and C-2′, Fig. 2) between the thiophene units of neighboring spiroBiProDOT units for HOMO energy states. However, the electron density was found to be maximum on the S atom as well as C5 or C5′ in LUMO energy states. The molecule contained the C2 axis of the symmetry; therefore, after simulation, degenerate orbitals of HOMO/LUMO were not taken into consideration. That's the basic reason that the electron density of only one part of the dimeric structure is shown (Fig. 2). A similar type of observation was also made for the dimeric unit of EDOT in which the HOMO energy orbital contained maximum electron density between the thiophene (C-2 and C-2′) moiety of each EDOT (Fig. 3).

Polymers with low band gap are promising as electrocatalytic materials because of two prime factors. First, the charge carriers can be enhanced thermally. Second, these polymers also have higher electrical conductivity without using any oxidative or reductive dopants.64,65 In addition, increasing the π-conjugation in the molecular backbone of polymers can reinforce the charge mobility throughout the polymeric systems. Poly(spiroBiProDOT) system contains a higher number of oxy-thiophene moieties than the PEDOT polymer, which is helpful for the reduction of the conduction band as well as increasing the efficiency of charge mobility. Band gaps of 2.05 eV and 3.8 eV were calculated for dimeric spiroBiProDOT and dimeric EDOT after careful simulation. The simulation results are also helpful to understand the enhanced charge carrier capacity of poly(spiroBiProDOT) on the FTO glass as compared to the PEDOT polymer. SEM images of PEDOT and poly(spiroBiProDOT) layers on the FTO glass were helpful to understand the morphology/structure of these polymeric layers applying the above-mentioned voltage for 10 min under an inert atmosphere (Fig. 4). The porous structure was observed for the PEDOT polymer at lower magnifications (Fig. 4a), and this porous structure was composed of many micro-sized aggregates. Nonetheless, at higher magnifications, a thread-like nanoporous structure was observed on the PEDOT surface (Fig. 4b). It has been reported that aggregation of large amounts of three-dimensional network nanoparticles can increase the effective active area.47 Upon careful observation of the SEM images of poly(spiroBiProDOT), a porous aggregated three-dimensional nanostructure was also formed on the surface of the FTO glass (Fig. 4c).
 Fig. 4  (a and b) SEM images of the PEDOT polymer at low and high magnifications. (c and d) SEM images of poly(spiroBiProDOT) at low and high magnifications. 
These aggregates of poly(spiroBiProDOT) shown in Fig. 4d were much denser than those of PEDOT (Fig. 4b). Electronic structures of spiroBiProDOT monomers whose number of thiophene units is double that of the EDOT monomer may be one plausible reason for dense aggregation in poly(spiroBiProDOT) polymers due to inter- or intra-molecular π–π interaction between thiophene units.
Photovoltaic characterization was carried out by employing the poly(spiroBiProDOT) and PEDOT polymer-coated FTO glass as the counter electrode for DSSCs under 1 sun illumination.
The current density–voltage curves (J–V) and the corresponding data are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. At least three cells were fabricated using the poly(spiroBiProDOT)-layered FTO glass to get an average data. For comparison, at least three cells were also manufactured by employing the PEDOT polymer-layered FTO glass.

A maximum cell efficiency of 7.9% with Jsc of 14.76 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.726 V, and FF of 0.73 (Table 1) was achieved by applying the poly(spiroBiProDOT)-coated FTO counter electrode under 1 sun illumination. By contrast, a maximum cell efficiency of 6.8% (Jsc of 12.68 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.691 V, and FF of 0.72) was recorded for the cells constructed with a PEDOT-coated FTO counter electrode. From the enhanced short circuit photocurrent density for solar cells fabricated with poly(spiroBiProDOT) compared to PEDOT, it can be postulated that an increase in the number of thiophene moieties can increase the electrocatalytic active area for charge transmission and better charge passivation on the surface. An enhancement of 35 mV in the Voc was observed for FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT) compared to FTOPEDOT, though was not significant but still helpful for better solar efficiency. These photovoltaic results were also compared with the solar cell data fabricated with the platinum-based counter electrode, where the maximum cell efficiency of 8.31% (Jsc of 15.66 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.749 V, and FF of 0.73) was recorded under 1 sun illumination. Based on the above-mentioned photovoltaic results, it is apparent that the spiroBiProDOT-based counter electrode gives a better competition with the Pt-based solar device. PEDOT was synthesized on the counter electrode for DSSCs, which achieved the maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.401%.45 The authors also reported a higher efficiency of 7.115% after involving a mixture layer of graphene oxide and PEDOT. By comparison, in our study, a layer of poly(spiroBiProDOT) was synthesized by an electrochemical method after optimizing the voltage, and a maximum cell efficiency of 7.9% was achieved (even without the addition of any foreign dopant like graphene oxide) using the same dye (N719 dye) under 1 sun illumination. Therefore, we believe that poly(spiroBiProDOT) is more competitive than PEDOT in DSSC applications.
Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was carried out to understand charge transfer resistance throughout the cell under lighting conditions. A Nyquist spectrum consisted of three typical semicircles. The first semicircle in the higher frequency zone implies the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the counter electrode and the electrolyte (Rct1), and the second semicircle in the mid-frequency zone associated with charge transfer resistance at the interface of dye-coated TiO2 and electrolyte (Rct2).61,66–69 The third semicircle in the low-frequency zone refers to the Warburg diffusion constant between the photoanode and the counter electrode. EIS spectra of solar cells fabricated with the poly(spiroBiProDOT), PEDOT, and Pt-layered FTO counter electrode are shown in Fig. 6a. Based on the EIS spectra and an equivalent circuit configuration, the corresponding charge transfer resistances of Rct1 and Rct2 can be calculated as listed in Table 2.

The values of Rct1 between the counter electrode and the electrolyte were found to be 17.6 Ω and 20.8 Ω for the cells employing FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT) and FTOPEDOT counter electrodes (Table 2). The lower value of Rct1 for FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT) compared with the FTOPEDOT counter electrode indicates a lower charge transfer resistance between the FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT)/electrolyte interface. Due to lower charge transfer resistance of the poly(spiroBiProDOT) polymer layer, the reduction rate of triiodide to iodide on the counter electrode can be enhanced, and therefore, Jsc is increased. It was found that the values of Rct2 were similar for all solar devices employing three different catalysts, poly(spiroBiProDOT), PEDOT, and Pt, on the counter electrodes, which can be explained by the factor that all three solar devices have the same configuration of TiO2 photoanodes.
Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded (Fig. 6b) to understand the higher Jsc value of 14.76 mA cm−2 for FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT) with respect to FTOPEDOT (12.68 mA cm−2)-based solar cells. For N719 dyes, a broad IPCE spectrum was observed between 300 nm and 755 nm. At 527 nm, a maximum IPCE of 60% was observed for FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT)-based solar cells. However, a maximum IPCE of 55% was recorded at the same wavelength number. This broad IPCE spectrum with a high IPCE from 300 nm to 755 nm regions was the main reason for the higher Jsc value of FTOPoly(spiroBiProDOT)-based solar cells than that of FTOPEDOT-based solar cells. However, a maximum IPCE of 72% was observed for the FTOPt-based solar device. Based on the above-mentioned photovoltaic results, it can be seen that the poly(spiroBiProDOT)-layered FTO counter electrode is not only cost-effective but also more competitive with the platinum-layered counter electrode in terms of solar efficiency.
Enhanced solar cell efficiency by incorporating a PEDOT-based counter electrode has been widely reported in the literature. Solid-state polymerization of the PEDOT polymer on the counter electrode also made an impact in the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Additional increment of photovoltaic parameters by employing foreign nanoparticles or polymers with PEDOT in DSSCs has also been reported under 1 sun illumination. A comparison in terms of photovoltaic parameters of reported PEDOT-based counter electrodes with the poly(spiroBiProDOT)-based counter electrode was made, and the results are tabulated in Table S2 (ESI†).
4. Conclusion
Monomeric pure spiroBiProDOT was synthesized in laboratory from 3,4-dioxythiophene. A dimeric spiroBiProDOT layer was synthesized from its monomeric spiroBiProDOT units and fabricated on the surface of an FTO glass by an electropolymerization method. For comparison, the PEDOT layer was also fabricated on the FTO glass. Theoretical calculation was performed to explain the high charge carrier capacity for poly(spiroBiProDOT) compared to the PEDOT polymer, from which dimeric spiroBiProDOT was shown to have a lower band gap of 2.05 eV than that of dimeric EDOT, which was 3.8 eV. Microstructural characterization of the SEM images indicated that poly(spiroBiProDOT) exhibited a nanoporous structure composed of many small densely packed aggregates. Such dense aggregation was attributed to the factor that the thiophene unit of spiroBiProDOT was double that of EDOT, which induced stronger inter- or intra-molecular π–π interactions between thiophene units. A maximum cell efficiency of 7.9% was recorded for the DSSC by applying a poly(spiroBiProDOT)-based FTO counter electrode, which was 16% higher than that (6.8%) of the PEDOT-based solar cell under 1 sun illumination. Compared to the conventional Pt-based counter electrode, poly(spiroBiProDOT) also exhibited strong competitiveness as an efficient electrocatalyst in terms of cell efficiency (7.9% versus 8.3%). The ordered thiophene moiety connected by a spiro linkage can increase π–π conjugation and π–π interaction in poly(spiroBiProDOT), which can enhance the charge mobility for more efficient reduction reactions on the counter electrode. As a result, Jsc was increased and contributed to high cell efficiency.
