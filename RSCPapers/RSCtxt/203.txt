    , Accepted 11th February 2020First published on 12th February 2020AbstractRecent work has emphasized the pivotal role of halogen substituents in the development of polymer donors or small-molecule (SM) acceptors for efficient bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. However, the application of –F or –Cl substitutions in the design of SM donors is yet to receive similar considerations. In this contribution, we report a set of oligothiophene derivatives (2F7T and 2Cl7T) with halogenation at the central thienyl moiety. Such halogenation is shown to induce a sufficient increase in ionization potential (IP; i.e. deeper HOMO) to modify the electron-donating and -transporting characteristics of the molecules. When combined with a low-bandgap SM acceptor (Y6), the devices with 2Cl7T achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to ca. 11.5% (vs. ca. 2.5% for non-halogenated donor DRCN7T based devices), representing the best photovoltaic performance of oligothiophene donors.
The attention captured by bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) is increasing exponentially due to their unique advantages of low-cost, low weight, easy fabrication and flexibility that fit wearable devices.1,2 In the last three years, small molecule (SM) non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and the substitutes of fullerene (e.g. PC61BM or its C71 analogue) acceptors have been pushing the OSC efficiency to higher records. So far, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 15% and 16% have already been achieved in polymer donor/SM-NFA systems.3,4 However, the considerable inconsistency of device performance, caused by the batch-to-batch variations in molecular weight (Mw) and the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of polymer donors, remains a major challenge to the development of polymer-based solar cells.5–8 Recently, the SM-donor/SM-NFA, i.e., all-small-molecule (ASM) OSCs emerged with soaring PCE records. Compared with its polymer-based counterpart, an ASM-OSC possesses several indisputable advantages such as easy purification, a well-defined structure, and negligible batch-to-batch inconsistency in photovoltaic behavior. Unfortunately, most reported ASM-OSCs show unsatisfactory device performance with PCEs of <10% at present.9
Oligothiophenes and polythiophenes have been intensively investigated as electron-donating materials in BHJ-OSCs, especially those containing regio-regular head-to-tail segments.10 Besides presenting excellent charge transport and high stability, the breakthroughs of the concise and low-cost synthesis of oligothiophenes also intrigued researchers to polish them as practical donors for the commercialization of OSCs.11–13 Actually, even though the photovoltaic performance of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is less than satisfactory, it is still the dominant donor material for the fabrication of large area OSCs due to its low synthetic cost.14 In 2014, a SM donor containing a sepithiophene π-backbone was first reported with a notable PCE of 9.3% in its PC71BM system, and the following modified pentathiophene analogue further pushed the record to 10.1%, which was the highest one reported for single-junction SM-OSCs.15,16 Yet in most NFA systems, oligothiophene donors exhibited much inferior compatibility with SM acceptors to those with PC71BM. The relatively shallow highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of oligothiophene donors and their highly overlapped absorption spectra with most SM acceptors always lead to relatively low open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC), thus, a drastic decline in PCE can be frequently observed. Hence, the best PCE record for oligothiophene-based ASM-OSCs is still below 10%.17
To enhance the performance of oligothiophene donors in ASM-OSCs, here we introduced halogen atoms (–F and –Cl) into the center thienyl group of septithiophene containing head-to-tail alkylated terthiophene π-linkers and rhodanine terminal groups. In comparison to non-halogenated donors, i.e., DRCN7T, the film absorption onset of the fluorinated donor 2F7T was slightly blue-shifted with a corresponding Eopt of 1.68 eV; as for the chlorinated donor 2Cl7T, the Eopt of 1.75 eV is much wider. Furthermore, a near-infrared (NIR) NFA Y6 was selected to fabricate ASM OSC devices with these halogenated donors. An impressive PCE up to ca. 9.4% and 11.5% was achieved by using such 2F7T and 2Cl7T, respectively. The PCE of the OSC with 2Cl7T is not only an almost fivefold enhancement compared to that of non-halogenated DRCN7T (ca. 2.5%), but also the highest record for OSCs with oligothiophene donors. And it is noteworthy that, with a skyrocketing improvement in PCE, actually the synthetic cost of 2Cl7T has little difference from that of DRCN7T. This result demonstrated that halogenated oligothiophene donors are promising candidates for scale-up production and application in the field of OSCs.
The synthetic procedure of halogenated donors 2X7T is depicted in Scheme 1. According to previous reports, the organotin reagent of 3,4-difluorothiophene (2FT-Sn) was synthesized via a four-step route from 3,4-dibromothiophene with a total yield of around 18%;18 by contrast, the chlorinated organotin compound 2ClT-Sn can be conveniently synthesized via a two-step route with a total yield of up to 80%. The head-to-tail terthiophene segment 5 was concisely built via two consecutive regio-controlled cross-coupling reactions followed by formylation and bromination.11,12,19 Then the halogenated septithiophene backbone was constructed through a Stille coupling between 2XT-Sn (X = Cl or F) and segment 5. Finally, the terminal group 6 was attached to the oligothiophene to generate SM donors 2F7T and 2Cl7T. Overall, starting from industrialized intermediates 3,4-dibromothiophene and 3-octylthiophene, 2Cl7T can be obtained in 8 steps with a satisfactory yield of around 37%. In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S1†) shows that both SM donors exhibit good thermal stability and decompose (5% loss) only above 385 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Fig. S6†) results indicate that the SM donors have a melting temperature (Tm) of 176 °C and 188 °C respectively, and the cooling scans indicate the obvious propensity for crystallization of both of them.

The photophysical properties of SM donors were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S4,† both 2F7T and 2Cl7T exhibit quite similar absorption profiles to DRCN7T in solution, only with various degrees of blue-shifts due to the introduction of halogen atoms. While in a thin film (Fig. 1a), a significant red-shift was observed for 2Cl7T (ca. 108 nm, judging from the λonset), leading to an optical band gap around 1.75 eV. As for 2F7T, a bigger red-shift of ca. 137 nm makes its Eopt (ca. 1.68 eV) quite similar to that of DRCN7T (1.67 eV). And the clear vibronic features presented at ca. 600 and 660 nm in the thin film absorption profile suggest that the 2F7T is more prone to form ordered aggregates compared with its chlorinated counterpart and DRCN7T due to the smaller atomic size of fluorine. Overall, the thin-film absorption of SM donors in the range from 450–650 nm makes them spectrally complementary with the SM acceptor Y6, which has a main absorption range of 600–850 nm.

The electrochemical behaviors of SM donors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). A gradient shift of the first oxidation potential (EOX) of three SM donors was observed. As shown in Fig. 1b, along with the halogenation in the septithiophene backbone, the EOX of three SM donors shifted from 0.77 V (DRCN7T) to 0.95 V (2Cl7T). We estimated the HOMO energy level (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (ELUMO) of 2F7T and 2Cl7T, which are at −5.29 and −3.61 eV, respectively, for 2F7T and at −5.39 and −3.64 eV, respectively, for 2Cl7T.
To further investigate the effect of halogenation, geometry optimization of three donors was performed at the pbe0/def2svp level with Grimme's empirical dispersion correction GD3BJ during optimization using the Gaussian 09 program.20 The electronic structures were then obtained at the ω-tuned wb97x/def2-TZVP level.21–23 The electrostatic potential (ESP) graphics, HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and natural population analysis (NPA) charge of halogen atoms are shown in Fig. 2. All three molecules have a completely planar structure at stationary point. Compared with the DRCN7T, the introduction of –F and –Cl lowers the LUMO level a little (within 0.03 eV) but reduces the HOMO level to a greater extent, which leads to a wider gap.24 These gap tuning effects of halogen atoms can be understood by their inductive effect, as manifested by the NPA atomic charges of F (−0.270) and Cl (0.072), compared with that of –H (0.225). It's interesting to note that, although the inductive effect of –F is stronger, the HOMO level of 2Cl7T is actually deeper. This is because the p–π conjugation effect of –F is stronger due to the shorter C–F bond (C–F: 1.33 Å vs. C–Cl: 1.73 Å), as evidenced by the LUMO distribution (Fig. S3†), where 2F7T has some distribution on halogen atoms but 2Cl7T does not.

To validate the photovoltaic performance of the halogenated SM donors, Y6 was selected as the acceptor, and devices with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active layer/PFN-Br/Ag were fabricated with a device area of 0.11 cm2. The device optimization conditions are detailed in ESI section 9.†Fig. 3 depicts the J–V curves and EQE spectra of the optimized OSCs, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The reference device of DRCN7T:Y6 only yielded a PCE of 2.48%, with a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 8.44 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 36.48%. On the other hand, the device of 2F7T:Y6 showed better performance with a VOC of 0.79 V, a JSC of 20.72 mA cm−2, and an FF of 54.1%, obtaining a PCE of 9.41%. Notably, the optimal device of 2Cl7T:Y6 exhibited the best performance with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 19.69 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.15%, resulting in an outstanding PCE of 11.45%. In addition, the highest VOC obtained in the chlorinated device was in line with the deeper HOMO energy levels. One can notice that the JSC was lower compared with that of the fluorinated device, which was attributed to the wider absorption range of 2F7T in solid films, leading to a higher photon to electron response visualized in the EQE spectra from ca. 500–800 nm (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, the turn points of the EQE at ca. 700 nm for 2Cl7T, and ca. 720 nm for 2F7T were observed, which again confirmed our above speculations.
The recombination features of these devices were examined qualitatively by measuring the J–V curves with different incident light intensities. On the one hand, the JSC and incident light intensity I have a power law relationship, i.e. JSC ∝ Iα, and the power α reflects the extent of bimolecular recombination. It indicates that the devices barely suffer from bimolecular recombination if the value of the α is equal to unity (α ≡ 1).25 In contrast, bimolecular recombination exists while the α value deviates from 1. It is noted that the α values of 0.95, 0.99, and 0.97 were fitted for the devices of DRCN7T:Y6, 2F7T:Y6, and 2Cl7T:Y6, respectively (details in Fig. S9†). These values suggest that all three devices underwent weak bimolecular recombination. On the other hand, information about trap assisted recombination can be obtained from the relationship between the VOC and the incident light intensity. When the incident light intensity changes, the VOC obeys the expression of VOC ∝ nkTln(I)/q,26 where n is the coefficient, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. The n value usually ranges from 1 to 2, and a unity of n indicates a trap free condition, while any deviation from unity indicates the existence of trap assisted recombination.27 As presented in Fig. S9,† the device of 2Cl7T:Y6 shows an n value of 1.35, while the devices of DRCN7T:Y6 and 2F7T:Y6 showed much larger n values of 1.90 and 1.71, respectively, indicating the weakest trap assisted recombination in the device of 2Cl7T:Y6. From the above analysis on the J–V curves under different incident light intensities, we can see that trap assisted recombination was the major recombination channel in devices of DRCN7T:Y6 and 2F7T:Y6.
To understand the effect of the halogen substituents on charge transport properties, carrier mobility was fitted from the dark J–V curves using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (details in ESI section 10†). However, it was found that the hole mobility was not affected much. Therefore, we in turn checked the active layer morphology for further information studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 4 shows the AFM and TEM images of the three blend films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the active layers of 2Cl7T:Y6 and 2F7T:Y6 was comparable, with values of 1.58 nm and 1.28 nm. On the other hand, the roughness value of the active layer of DRCN7T:Y6 was 9.92 nm, resulting in altered aggregation features. Specifically, the donors and acceptors in the films of 2Cl7T:Y6 and 2F7T:Y6 were finely mixed with a uniform surface, while strong aggregation in the film of DRCN7T:Y6 was observed with large extent of phase separation. These features are also revealed in the TEM images in Fig. 4d–f and evidenced from the photoluminescence quenching efficiency of these films presented in Fig. S14 and S15.† Notably, the surface roughness values were in line with the hole mobility obtained.

To elucidate the effect of drafting different halogens on molecular crystallinity and orientation, two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) of pristine SMs and optimized blend films was measured (Fig. 5). The corresponding in-plane (qxy) and out-of-plane (qz) profiles of the GIWAXS images are shown in Fig. S16,† and the summarized crystallographic parameters are presented in Table S11.† Compared to that of pristine SMs (detailed GIWAXS analysis is provided in ESI section 15†), the molecular orientation of both 2F7T:Y6 and 2Cl7T:Y6 blend films was drastically changed, as revealed by the suppression of the main π–π stacking (010) peaks along either the qxy or qz directions (Fig. 5e and f). These features indicate the good miscibility of the 2F7T or 2Cl7T with Y6, which may be attributed to some interaction between the halogen of the SMs and Y6,28 or the repulsive interaction between halogens in SMs.29 Notably, both these blends displayed mixed (edge-on and face-on) orientations, suggested by the appearance of higher order lamellar packing (up to the 300 peak) (the corresponding d spacing ranging from 18.98 to 19.29 Å) and extremely weak (010) π–π stacking peaks along both qxy and qz directions. Moreover, 2Cl7T:Y6 demonstrated decreased π–π stacking and higher CCL010 along both qxy and qz directions (Table S11†), indicating its enhanced crystalline nature, corroborating well with its lower recombination and higher hole mobility in SCLC devices. Conversely, in the case of DRCN7T:Y6, in addition to higher order lamellar packing along qxy and an intense (010) reflection peak along qz (q(100) = 0.33 Å−1 and q(010) = 1.69 Å−1, respectively), it also exhibits additional (100) and (010) diffraction peak along qxy and qz directions (q(100) = 0.291 Å−1 and q(010) = 1.78 Å−1), respectively (Fig. 5d). We further analysed the GIWAXS pristine Y6 to understand this unique feature (Fig. S17 and Table S11†). Clearly, a second set of diffraction peaks originated from the Y6 acceptor, signifying its poor miscibility with DRCN7T, thereby resulting in phase separated distinct aggregated domains of Y6 and DRCN7T. These results were in good agreement with the morphology of the optimized blend films.

In summary, we have demonstrated that with simple chlorination, oligothiophenes can be rationally designed to be high performance donors for ASM OSCs. Apart from having more suitable energy levels (deeper HOMO levels), the resulting oligothiophene 2Cl7T has also shown to possess optimal balance between crystallinity and miscibility with the NFA Y6 in blend films compared with those of the other two counterparts. Attributed to the merits mentioned above, the ASM OSCs fabricated with 2Cl7T/Y6 can deliver an impressive PCE of 11.45%, outperforming those of the fluorinated (9.41%) and non-halogenated (2.48%) control devices. These findings provide guidelines for the halogenation of SM donors and pave the way for the development of oligothiophene-based donors for superior device performance.
