    , Accepted 1st November 2019First published on 5th November 2019AbstractIn this work we present an innovative method of creating Si quantum dots under pulsed ion-beam exposure. The evolution of defect structure ODC(II) → E′ → ODC(I) → Si QDs in glassy SiO2 under ion-beam implantation was established by optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Depending on the mode of ion exposure, it is possible to easily control the type and concentration of defects in the host and modify its optical properties for novel applications. Ab initio calculations confirm that bond softening in SiO2 is attainable via the use of Gd ion implantation. According to our experimental and theoretical results, the three-stage interaction of primary oxygen-deficient centers leads to the formation of stable silicon quantum dots with a size of 3.6 nm and luminescence at 1.8 eV excited by incoherent light.
1. Introduction
Obtaining silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) and the study of their properties are hot subjects of great interest in the fields of science and engineering. Unlike bulk silicon, QDs exhibit distinctive photoluminescence due to the effect of quantum confinement.1 The efficiency of electron–hole radiation and recombination in QDs is increased by preventing the migration of excitons to non-radiative recombination centers in addition to the charge confinement in a small volume. One more advantage of Si QDs is the ability to tune the emission energy from the infrared (1.2–1.6 eV) to the visible (2.6–3.0 eV) spectral range via changing their size.2 This feature makes Si QDs a highly promising candidate for a lot of practical applications, such as light emitting systems,3 quantum information technologies,4 solar cells,5 memory structures,6 spintronic-logic devices,7 plasmonic nanostructures,8etc. In addition, Si QDs show excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, which is important for biomedical practice.9
Numerous advances have been achieved in the synthesis of Si QDs, among them are bulk silicon etching,10 laser pyrolysis,11 gas phase synthesis,12 thermal vaporization,13 wet chemistry techniques,14 phase separation upon thermal annealing15,16etc. However, these methods often require special additives such as ligands, surfactants and dopants, as well as high-temperature post-processing, to stabilize the QDs and control their size. As we are searching for a more simple and convenient method for Si QD formation, pulsed ion-beam implantation is used.17 By varying the ion energy and dose, we can control the degree of structural damage and defective composition in the host.18,19 Choosing the optimal mode of implantation requires a deep understanding of the processes of defect formation in SiO2 after ion irradiation.
The main fundamental task of this work is to study the radiation damage of the crystal structure on the atomic scale and to establish the possible mechanisms of Si QD formation, as well as investigate their emission properties, in SiO2 glass under exposure to an ion beam at different doses. For implantation, the gadolinium ion was chosen due to its physicochemical and optical properties. Gadolinium is a heavy element belonging to the group of lanthanides. The implantation of SiO2 with heavy ions increases the possibility to significantly change the host structure and create a variety of intrinsic defects, including Si QDs. Furthermore, gadolinium is a chemically active element which extremely easily forms bonds with oxygen. This feature stimulates the creation of oxygen-deficient centers in SiO2 additionally and hence the formation of Si QDs can be achieved consequently. The distinctive electron configuration of Gd determines its energy structure and optical properties. All energy levels of Gd3+ excited states are located in the ultraviolet spectral region, to which the SiO2 host is transparent, and Gd3+ is a promising ion for converting UV energy into visible light.20–22 In turn, the visible emission of Si QDs can be widely used in nanophotonic and optoelectronic functional systems.
2. Samples and methods
2.1 Ion-beam exposure of silica glass
High quality KUVI-SiO2 quartz glass (type IV) with a minimum concentration of impurities (up to 10−3 mass%) and transmittance in a wide spectral range from the IR to the UV was used as a matrix. Ion implantation was performed at the Institute of Electrophysics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, Ekaterinburg. In order to obtain a gadolinium ion-beam a metal-vapor vacuum arc ion-source (MEVVA-type) was employed. We used a pulsed mode of implantation in order to minimize thermally-activated diffusion processes and to clearly distinguish different stages of defect formation induced by ion exposure. The cathode was fabricated using metallic gadolinium with a purity of 99.9 at%. The ion beam was generated in pulse-periodic mode with a pulse duration of 400 μs and a repetition frequency of 12.5 Hz. The energy in the ion beam and the current density were 30 keV and 3.4 mA cm−2, respectively. The temperature of the samples during the ion-beam treatment was maintained at 100 °C. The pressure in the implantation chamber was no more than 0.01 Pa. By changing the time of ion irradiation, we obtained Gd-implanted SiO2 samples with different fluences: 5 × 1016, 1 × 1017, 2.5 × 1017 and 5 × 1017 cm−2.
2.2 Spectroscopic measurements
Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the virgin and Gd-implanted SiO2 glasses were obtained using a McPherson™ VuVAS PL 1000 spectrometer. The pressure in the sample chamber was maintained at 10−4 Pa with the help of two turbomolecular vacuum pumps TURBOVAC 300i. A deuterium lamp model 632 was used as a light source. Photoluminescence measurements were carried out at a temperature of 8 K using a Janis CCS-450 cryostat. The input and output slits of the optical pathway provided a 2 nm spectral resolution.
The concentrations of light-absorbing defect centers in SiO2, formed as a result of ion implantation, were calculated using the Smakula–Dexter equation:18 (1)where n is the refractive index of SiO2 in the spectral region of the absorption band (1.46 for the KUVI-type quartz glass); α0 is the absorption coefficient at the band's maximum; ΔE is the FWHM of the band; and f is the oscillator strength of the optical transition (0.2, 0.135 and 0.4 for ODC(I), ODC(II) and E′-centers, respectively23).
2.3 Computational methods
The initial lattice parameters of the undoped silicon dioxide are (4.913 Å, 4.913 Å, 5.405 Å) in the space group P3121. The Gd ions are doped in the unit cell of SiO2 and the composite undergoes geometric optimization with the GGA-PBE functional.24 The bond strength between silicon and oxygen is calculated using the LDA functional25 where ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used. The SCF tolerance is 1 × 10−5 eV per atom and 100 SCF cycles are performed. To compare which element weakens the Si–O bond interaction more effectively, the bond lengths of Ge, Gd, Re and Co doped silicon dioxide are studied.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optical absorption induced by an ion beam
Survey optical absorption spectra of both Gd-implanted and virgin SiO2 are shown in Fig. 1. Ion implantation leads to a shift in the fundamental absorption edge of SiO2 to the low-energy region, reducing the transparency of silica glass. The maximal absorption peak at 7.5 eV, which is very weak in the virgin matrix, is clearly manifested after ion implantation. Despite the fact that a weak absorption band at about 5.6 eV is completely absent in the virgin host, it appears after ion irradiation with a fluence of at least 1 × 1017 cm−2. These features observed from the survey optical absorption spectra indicate the formation of different intrinsic defects in the SiO2 host, induced by radiation damage of the structure. The spectral positions of the absorption bands in the Gd-implanted samples indicate the assumed nature of the absorption centers, associated with the so-called ODCs (oxygen-deficient centers) and E′-centers (3-fold-coordinated silicon atoms).23,26,27

For a more detailed determination of the impact of Gd-ion irradiation on defect formation in SiO2, we analyze different absorption spectra of implanted samples obtained by subtracting the spectrum for the untreated virgin matrix (Fig. 2). The absorption spectrum of the sample with a 5 × 1016 cm−2 fluence is non-elementary and can be represented by a superposition of two bands with maxima at 6.7 eV (FWHM = 0.6 eV) and 7.6 eV (FWHM = 1.2 eV). These bands are characteristic of oxygen-deficient centers commonly referred to as ODC(II) and ODC(I), which correspond to two-coordinated silicon atoms [Si:] and neutral single oxygen vacancies [Si–Si], respectively.23,26,27 With an increase of fluence up to 1 × 1017 cm−2, the spectral composition of absorption changes and a new band appears at 5.6 eV (FWHM = 0.6 eV). This signal can be attributed to the so-called E′-center, representing a 3-fold-coordinated silicon with one unpaired electron.23,26,27 With a further increase in the Gd-ion dose, there are no qualitative modifications to the differential absorption spectra, but the peak intensity and FWHM of the bands change, which indicates a variation in the concentrations of oxygen-deficient centers.
 Fig. 2  Difference absorption spectra of SiO2 implanted with Gd ions at various fluences. The arrows indicate the signals from oxygen-deficiency related centers in the SiO2 host, induced by the pulsed ion implantation: single oxygen vacancies ODC(I); divacancies ODC(II) and E′-centers (3-fold-coordinated silicon). 
The measured concentrations in absolute value are listed in Table 1 and the data are presented in Fig. 3 in order to show the dynamics of their changes with the ion fluence more clearly. We can distinguish three regions of ion dose, denoted by Latin letters in Fig. 3. In the first low-dose region “A” (up to 1017 cm−2), the concentrations of both ODC(I) and ODC(II)-centers are increased by about the same value. With a further increase in fluence (region “B”), the concentrations of single vacancies and two-fold-coordinated silicon atoms demonstrate opposite behavior: the number of ODC(I)-centers is increased but the concentration of ODC(II)-centers is reduced. In the third high-dose region “C” both oxygen-deficient centers show a tendency to decay, which is more pronounced for [Si–Si] centers. Such an ambiguous change in the concentrations of oxygen-deficient centers with varying ion fluence indicates the possibility of implementing the process of converting some centers to others. In order to obtain more detailed information about the features of radiation-induced defects in silica glass, we measure photoluminescence spectra.

The letters indicate various stages of formation and the conversion of defect centers: (A) radiation formation of vacancy defects; (B) transformation of defects; (C) clusterization into quantum dots. The shaded areas quantify the ODC(II) → ODC(I) transformation. 
3.2 Luminescence of defects
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the Gd-implanted SiO2 have non-elementary forms and consist of several bands (Fig. 4). With low doses of irradiation (5 × 1016 and 1 × 1017 cm−2), the main contribution to the overall PL intensity is provided by the bands with maxima at 2.8 eV (FWHM = 0.5 eV) and 3.1 eV (FWHM = 0.8 eV). The appearance of the bands is due to the radiation transitions from the excited triplet state to the ground singlet energy level T1 → S0 in oxygen-deficient ODC(I) and ODC(II)-centers.23,26,27 It should be noted that the highest luminescence intensity is achieved at 6.6 eV excitation, which corresponds to the S0 → S2 transition in ODC(II)-centers. The observed triplet PL under excitation of the singlet level is explained by the almost complete absence of an activation barrier for the S2 → T1 energy pathway.28
 Fig. 4  Photoluminescence spectra of SiO2 implanted with Gd ions at different fluences (5 × 1016, 1 × 1017, 2.5 × 1017 and 5 × 1017 cm−2). The measurements were carried out at a temperature of 8 K under excitation by photons with an energy of 6.6 eV. 
Along with the unambiguous interpretation of PL signals from oxygen-deficient silicon centers, the emission band at 2.2 eV cannot be assigned to any known optical center in SiO2. We assume that the nature of this PL band is related to the optical transition in an ODC-type defect modified by a gadolinium ion. The theoretical simulation of the electronic structure of SiO2:Gd showed that for low values of the fluence (5 × 1016–1 × 1017 cm−2), the most energetically favorable position of Gd ions is located at the interstitial site in the SiO2 host.29 The location of a Gd ion near the silicon oxygen-deficient center can modify its energy structure. As a consequence, the optical characteristics are amended. Similar effects were observed in our previous work attributed to the implantation of glassy SiO2 with different ions.17–19
With increasing ion fluence, the PL spectra undergo both qualitative and quantitative changes, among which three main features emerge. Firstly, the PL intensity of ODC-type centers is decreased. Secondly, the maximum of the PL band assigned to the Gd-modified center is shifted to the high-energy spectral region. It is related to a change in the energy-level structure of the center due to the alteration of its local atomic environment. Thirdly, a new band with a maximum at 1.8 eV (FWHM = 0.3 eV) appears in the PL spectra for the case of a 2.5 × 1017 cm−2 Gd-ion dose in the SiO2 host. With a further increase in fluence, this band becomes more pronounced along with significantly suppressed signals from oxygen-deficient centers. The emission at 1.8 eV is characteristic of silicon quantum dots (Si QDs), which was observed in both amorphous and crystalline SiO2.3,30–36 Silicon atoms can be directly knocked to interstitial sites by the implantation of the SiO2 matrix with heavy ions such as gadolinium, as shown in the theoretical analysis of the electronic structure.29 With irradiation dose increases, the number of such interstitial silicon atoms grows, and the process of their clusterization with the formation of Si QDs becomes highly probable. On the other hand, since we observe a variety of oxygen-deficient centers caused by radiation damage of the host structure, more complex mechanisms for the formation of Si QDs can occur with the participation of these defects.
3.3 Silicon–oxygen bond softening
Based on our ab initio calculations, doping Gd ions enlarges the crystal structure of SiO2 from (4.913 Å, 4.913 Å, 5.405 Å) to (5.434 Å, 5.434 Å, 5.918 Å). The bond distance between S and O atoms in the pure silicon dioxide is 1.61 Å originally. However, doping Gd ions increases the average S–O bond length to 1.94 Å where the relaxed structure is drawn in Fig. 5. The Gd ion not only affects the bond length, but also influences the bond angle. The bond angle Si–O–Si is increased from 143 degrees to 175 degrees while the bond angle O–Si–O is bent from 84 degrees to 108 degrees. After geometric optimization, we remove the Gd ion but leave the relaxed coordinates of Si and O unchanged for the calculation of the bond energy. The average bond strength (per unit cell) between Si and O atoms under the relaxed coordinates is reduced by 62% remarkably. In comparison to other ionic dopants, the Si–O bond lengths of Co-doped, Re-doped and Ge doped silicon dioxide are 1.78 Å, 1.92 Å and 1.89 Å, respectively. Although our DFT simulation doesn’t aim at simulating the dynamic environment during ion implantation, the elongation of the Si–O bond may be a good precursor to guess which element will stand a higher chance to create QDs. While the largest elongated Si–O bond is observed in the Gd-doped silicon dioxide, the weakening of the Si–O bond strength in the Gd-doped silicon dioxide should be the most obvious. This actuates the process of QD formation. When the Si–O bond strength is weaker in the presence of Gd ions, the pivot angles of O–Si–O and Si–O–Si should bend less sharply that minimizes the repulsion between electron clouds. Thus, we believe that Si–O bond softening is an initial step in the multi-stage mechanism of Si QD formation.
 Fig. 5  The short range order of the SiO2 structure is deformed by Gd ion implantation. The red, blue and brown balls are oxygen, silicon and gadolinium respectively. The bond lengths and bond angles are listed in units of Angstroms and degrees respectively. 
3.4 The formation of quantum dots
On the basis of PL and optical absorption data and DFT calculations, we propose various schemes for the defect formation in SiO2 after Gd-ion implantation with different fluences. The obtained results show that the ion implantation with various fluences causes significantly different processes of defect formation in the host, which can be classified according to a number of stages as drawn in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Scheme of the successive stages for oxygen-deficient defect formation and fabrication of silicon quantum dots in SiO2 subjected to ion beam irradiation. “A”: radiation formation of vacancy defects; “B”: transformation of defects; “C”: clusterization into quantum dots. 

Stage “A”: radiation formation of vacancy defects. 
At 5 × 1016–1 × 1017 cm−2 ion fluences, the radiation damage of the SiO2 host structure leads to the formation of ODC(I) and ODC(II) defects by the following pathways: (2)and (3)where O: is free interstitial oxygen with two unpaired electrons. With an increase in fluence within this region, the formation of both types of oxygen-deficient centers occurs more intensively, as evidenced by the increase in their concentrations (Fig. 2).
Our earlier study showed that the penetration depth of Gd ions into the SiO2 host is up to 40 nm.37 Herein, the pulsed mode of ion implantation allows inducing the shock-wave mechanism of ODC formation over the entire thickness of the sample. Due to the extremely high chemical activity, the Gd easily forms chemical bonds with free oxygen arising from ODC creation. While this process occurs predominantly in the surface layer, the transformation of defects dominates in the bulk state, which will be described in the next stage.


Stage “B”: transformation of defects. 
In the second range of fluences (1 × 1017–2.5 × 1017 cm−2), the number of single oxygen vacancies [Si–Si] continues to grow in contrast to the [Si:]-centers. We note that the increase in the absolute value of the ODC(I) concentration and the decrease of that of the ODC(II)-centers are close. In addition, the absorption spectra (Fig. 1) clearly indicate the formation of a new type of defect center – three-coordinated silicon [Si˙], named E′-centers. We suppose that there is a multi-step process of ODC(II) → ODC(I) conversion with intermediate formation of E′-centers in this particular region of ion fluence: Si: + O: → Si˙(4) Si˙ + ˙Si → Si–Si(5)In the first step, the ODC(II)-center forms a bond with one free oxygen atom and transforms to three-coordinated silicon. Then, two E′-centers, each of which has one unpaired electron, are combined into one single oxygen vacancy.


Stage “C”: clusterization into quantum dots. 
Implantation with high fluences of 2.5 × 1017–5 × 1017 cm−2 leads to the appearance of the PL signal from Si QDs. Along with that, from our absorption measurements we found a decrease in the ODC(I) concentration (Fig. 3 and 4) by 0.3 × 1017 cm−3, which is several orders of magnitude larger than the possible range of error. Neutral silicon oxygen vacancies Si–Si have a high probability to easily coagulate at certain concentrations.38 We suppose that the vacancies of oxygen act as precursors for the formation of Si QDs due to clustering: (6)The average size of Si QDs can be estimated from the blue shift of the PL energy with respect to the band gap of bulk silicon by the following power law: (7)where EPL = 1.8 eV is the energy of PL at the maximum of the band; E0 = 1.17 eV is the band gap of bulk silicon; d is the average diameter of Si QDs; and α = 3.73 and β = 1.39 are empirical constants, which provided good agreement with experimental data further supported by theoretical modeling in different matrices.34,36 Implantation of the SiO2 host with Gd ions at fluences 2.5 × 1017 and 5 × 1017 cm−2 leads to the formation of Si QDs with an average diameter of 3.6 nm. The size of the obtained Si QDs is less than twice the Bohr exciton radius in bulk Si (∼10 nm), which indicates the appearance of a strong quantum confinement effect.1 In this regime of confinement, the energy structure of Si undergoes transformation from an indirect, characteristic of the bulk material, to a quasi-direct form, which leads to significant modification and enhancement of the optical properties of silicon.39 Taking into account the size of the obtained Si QDs and the known lattice parameters of Si, we estimate that each QD contains about 1200 silicon atoms and requires the clusterization of 600 ODC(I) centers.
There are two main competing factors determining the luminescence characteristics of QDs: the stronger interaction between electrons and holes gives a higher probability of radiative recombination and an extremely high surface-to-volume ratio causes an increase in the rate of non-radiative relaxation, which originates from quenching by surface defects. The luminescence of quantum dots is usually excited via the use of laser and synchrotron sources in order to provide an increased probability of light absorption.24 In our case, we observe the PL of Si QDs even when it is excited by an incoherent light source in the regime of strong quantum confinement.

Fig. 6 summarizes the different stages of defect formation and their conversion up to the creation of Si QDs by the pulsed ion implantation of amorphous SiO2. The choice of implantation regime allows modifying the defective composition of the matrix and its fundamental optical properties. By varying the ion fluence, we can create different types of structural defects, including QDs, which are achieved by controlling their concentration, and the spectral range and intensity of light emission.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we established the feature of formation, conversion and clustering of optically-active defects induced by ion-beam implantation of high-purity silica glass. During Gd-ion implantation with different doses, Si–O bond softening appeared and the three main stages of defect evolution were identified: (A) formation of primary oxygen-deficient centers; (B) defect conversion; (C) clustering into Si QDs. By changing the modes of radiation exposure of the SiO2 matrix, we can control the qualitative and quantitative composition of defects and modify the optical properties of the host, including the ultraviolet transmittance and visible luminescence. Implantation with high doses of ions has proven to be a simple and easily controlled method to obtain Si QDs with a stable and relatively small size of about 3.6 nm. The red luminescence of these Si QDs is excited even by incoherent light due to the strong quantum confinement effect. We suppose that implantation with other heavy ions, like gadolinium, will have a similar effect of modifying the defect composition of SiO2 up to the creation of Si QDs for planar functional structures of photonic devices.
