    , Accepted 14th September 2022First published on 16th September 2022AbstractThe film quality of a light absorber is the key factor that limits the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a new ammonium salt of 2-amidinopyrimidine hydrochloride (APC) is introduced into the surface and shallow layer of a perovskite film for further improving the performance of PSCs. The multi-functional groups within APC not only passivate the iodine vacancies (undercoordinated Pb2+ defects) through interaction with pyrimidine N, but also compensate the formamidine (FA) vacancies (undercoordinated I−) via N–H⋯I hydrogen or ionic bonding. APC also finely tunes the crystallization of FA-based perovskite films, resulting in an ultralong photoluminescence lifetime of about 5 μs and a larger carrier diffusion length of more than 4 μm, which is on par with single crystal perovskites. Benefiting from the excellent charge-carrier activities, the champion device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.17% (certified 24.51%), a notable fill factor of over 84%, and an open-circuit voltage of 1.184 V (the voltage deficit is only 0.37 V). Additionally, the APC treated device demonstrates excellent long-term storage and operational stability. This study will pave a new avenue for improving the perovskite film quality and realizing highly efficient and stable PSCs.

Broader context
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors have drawn tremendous attention in the photovoltaic field with a record efficiency of over 25%. However, it is still challenging to achieve a stable and reproducible high efficiency device. Here, an ammonium salt of 2-amidinopyrimidine hydrochloride (APC) was introduced into the shallow layer of a perovskite. The charged traps and crystallization of the perovskite were effectively regulated simultaneously, resulting in a PCE of 25.17% (certified 24.51%), with a notable VOC of 1.184 V, and an ultrahigh FF of over 84%. Moreover, the APC treated device exhibited excellent long-term operational stability, retaining more than 95% and 93% of its initial efficiencies after five months of storage in the dark and 600 h of continuous maximum output power point tracking (MPPT) under 1 sun illumination (white light LED array), respectively.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have drawn tremendous attention in the optoelectronic field,1–6 such as solar cells and light-emitting diodes, owing to their high light absorption coefficient (105 cm−1), long charge-carrier diffusion lengths (>1 μm in polycrystalline films), and ease of fabricating devices. Considering the unique optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials and the enormous contributions from the worldwide solar cell community, the certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for small-area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been elevated to 25.7% over the past decade.7 This rapid advance comes from the continuous optimization of the film quality by tuning the crystallization behavior and passivation of the non-radiative recombination center with functional organic molecules and/or their corresponding ions.8–11 Imperfection of a polycrystal perovskite film usually results in serious non-radiative recombination, leading to the deterioration of the related device performance.12 Therefore, the development of perovskite thin films with high crystallinity and a low trap-state is very important for high-performance PSCs.
Obviously, solution-processing of perovskite active films is a great advantage to be compatible with other functional layers, substrates, and/or sub-cells, which affords diversified device structures and application scenarios.13 However, the defects induced in such processes are detrimental to the device efficiency and stability of PSCs.14 For example, point defects would be easily formed in perovskite films because of their low formation energies, such as halide anion vacancies and organic cation vacancies.12 The defects derived from imperfect perovskite films would be also charged due to the ionic nature.15,16 The electronic traps distributed at the surfaces and grain boundaries of perovskite films not only dominate the non-radiative recombination and limit the open-circuit voltage (VOC),17–19 but also initiate rapid device degradation under elevated temperature, light exposure and atmosphere.15 Hence, tackling the charged defects in perovskite films is highly desirable for achieving high device performance.14–16 Previous reports indicated that excess MA/FA or iodine ions could be adopted to suppress organic cation or halide anion vacancies.20,21 Ammonium salts with long carbon chains were also used as efficient passivators via constructing a low dimensional perovskite interfacial layer.22,23 On the other side, the ionic nature of perovskites also resulted in defect passivation upon using versatile functional materials.11,24 Those materials including an electron donor (Lewis base) or acceptor (Lewis acid) would interact with electron-deficient defects (e.g. undercoordinated Pb2+) or electron-rich defects (e.g. undercoordinated I− or Pb–I anti-site defects), respectively.25 However, it is still challenging to simultaneously regulate both crystallization and defects of perovskite films for improving the device efficiency and stability of PSCs.
In this work, we presented an ammonium salt of 2-amidinopyrimidine hydrochloride (APC) to be introduced into the wet perovskite film for modulating both the crystallization and the charged traps at the same time. APC features multi-functional groups, including two pyrimidine N with unpaired lone pair electrons, –NH2 and NH2+ groups, and Cl− with negative charge (Fig. 1a). It is expected that APC will be a potential passivator for imperfect perovskites. The introduction of APC did not result in the formation of a 2D perovskite but it existed mainly at the surface and in the shallow perovskite layer. The results indicated that APC not only immobilized the under-coordinated Pb2+ (iodine vacancies) by interacting with pyrimidine N, but also compensated the FA vacancies (undercoordinated I−) through N–H⋯I hydrogen-bonding or NH2+⋯I− ionic bonding. Thus, the formation of deep-level defects was suppressed and the non-radiative recombination was also reduced. Moreover, crystallization of the perovskite film was improved effectively, along with an ultralong photoluminescence lifetime of about 5 μs and a carrier diffusion length of more than 4 μm. Benefiting from these merits, a VOC of 1.184 V (with a VOC loss of 0.37 V), an ultrahigh fill factor (FF) of over 84%, and a PCE of 25.17% (certified 24.51%) were obtained for our planar PSCs, which significantly outperformed the control device (VOC = 1.141 V, FF = 80%, and PCE = 23.14%). Meanwhile, the APC treated device showed excellent long-term stability, retaining more than 95% and 93% of its initial efficiencies after five months of storage in the dark and 600 h of continuous maximum output power point tracking (MPPT) under 1 sun illumination (white light LED array), respectively. Our study highlights the synergistic effect of crystallization modulation and trap passivation on the film quality for further elevating the performance of perovskite solar cells.

Results and discussion
Interaction between APC and the perovskite precursor
As mentioned above, APC is an ammonium salt with multi-functional groups, such as a pyrimidine ring, two pyrimidine N, two –NH2, and Cl−. Fig. 1a shows the electrostatic potential (ESP) of APC. Although the pyrimidine ring overall shows positive ESP (blue), the localized regions on N, –NH2, and Cl− all exhibit negative ESP (red). Therefore, APC with these electron-rich units can theoretically passivate Lewis-acid defects, e.g. the under-coordinated Pb2+. Besides, the existence of Cl− would play a vital role in modulating the morphology and crystallization of the perovskites.26–28 To study the influence of APC on the crystallization and defect passivation of FAMA-based perovskites,9 a trace amount of APC (0.01 mg mL−1) was introduced to the wet perovskite film by dispersing the functional material into a mixed anti-solvent (anisole:isopropanol = 9:1).29 To investigate the distribution of APC in perovskite films, time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was adopted to probe the depth profiles of the atomic species in the perovskite sample with or without APC treatment (Fig. 1b and c). The ToF-SIMS positive ion image showed a clear signal at the surface and a gradual decline of APC in the target perovskite film (Fig. 1c). The result indicated that there was substantial incorporation of APC into the perovskite film with a gradient distribution in the shallow perovskite layer. The corresponding 3D distribution images (Fig. S1, ESI†) could also provide more clear distribution information.
The interaction between APC and the perovskite precursor was revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Fig. 1d shows the FTIR spectra of APC, PbI2 and the APC-PbI2 mixed sample. The stretching vibration of CN in the pyrimidine ring (1568 cm−1) shifted to a lower wavenumber when APC was mixed with PbI2.30 This is attributed to the interaction between APC and Pb2+, where the pyrimidine N atoms donated their unpaired lone electrons to the empty orbitals of Pb2+. A similar shift for the APC-FAI mixed sample confirmed that APC could interact with both PbI2 and FAI (Fig. S2, ESI†). Liquid-state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed to further determine the interaction between APC and the perovskite precursor. It was found that the proton signal of the –NH2+ in APC appeared at 9.72 ppm (Fig. 1e), which shifted to 9.60 ppm when blended with PbI2, suggesting the strong NH⋯I hydrogen-bonding or NH2+⋯I− ionic bonding interactions.31 There was also a shift for the protons of –CH– in the pyrimidine ring, confirming the existence of coordination interaction between Pb2+ and pyrimidine N in APC. A similar conclusion was obtained from UV-vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), a red shift of the onset of absorption spectra was observed for the APC-PbI2 mixed solution compared to the pure APC and PbI2 solutions, implying the interaction between PbI2 and the functional groups in APC. Additionally, the interaction between APC and FAI could also be revealed from the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 1f), which was ascribed to the strong hydrogen bonding.
Fig. S4, ESI† shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for the perovskite films with or without APC. The characteristic peak at 400.47 eV (Fig. 1g) was ascribed to N 1s for FA+. After introducing APC, a new peak at 399 eV appeared, which belonged to pyrimidine N, confirming the presence of APC in the resultant perovskite film.32 Moreover, the characteristic peak for FA+ shifted to a lower binding energy, which was attributed to the electron-rich environment of FA+ derived from the electron-donating effect of the pyrimidine ring.33 Moreover, the characteristic peaks of Pb2+ shifted to lower binding energies after the introduction of APC (Fig. 1h), indicative of the changed surrounding electron cloud density. This shift was ascribed to the interaction between Pb2+ and the pyrimidine N in APC through Lewis acid–base interaction as mentioned in the previous reports.34 A similar shift to relatively lower binding energies was observed for the I 3d peaks (Fig. 1i), which was attributable to the electrostatic interaction between I and –NH2 in APC through hydrogen or ionic bonding.11,35 This agreed well with the 1H NMR results. Therefore, APC could not only coordinate with under-coordinated Pb2+via Lewis acid–base interaction, but also compensate the FA vacancy by forming hydrogen-bonding with FAI (as shown in Fig. 2), resulting in suppressed formation of the trap-state for improving the device performance.

Characterization of perovskite films
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) was subsequently performed to gain insight into the influence of APC on the crystallization of the perovskites (Fig. 3a). Both perovskite films with or without APC showed the same crystal structure. Here, hexagonal non-perovskite and 2D perovskite phases were not detected, indicating the formation of a phase-pure photoactive perovskite. Notably, only the (100) and (200) diffraction peaks could be detected, suggesting that the fabricated perovskite films exhibited preferential crystallographic orientation, and the crystal growth direction was preferred along the (100) facet. For the APC treated film, a significantly improved intensity of the (100) diffraction peak was observed. After analyzing the (100) diffraction peak, it could be found that the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was reduced from 0.19° to 0.17° upon the APC treatment (Fig. S5, ESI†). The results implied that the functional groups (N, NH2, and Cl−) synergistically controlled the crystallization, promoted the orientation, and improved the crystallinity of the perovskite film. This was in line with the reported results that Cl− could passivate interfacial defects and alter the crystallization of perovskites.26,36,37

(d) UPS spectra of the control and APC treated perovskite films (inset: the corresponding energy levels). (e) PL and (f) TRPL spectra of the perovskite films without and with APC treatment. 
The surface morphologies of the perovskite films with or without APC-treatment were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 3b and c show that both samples are covered fully by polycrystalline perovskites and the average crystal sizes are all over 1000 nm, indicating the high quality of the film prepared in this work. The grain size statistical distributions displayed that the average crystal size increased from 1050 nm for the control case to 1432 nm for the APC treated sample (one of the biggest grains was up to 2100 nm) (Fig. S6, ESI†). The result suggested that the crystal quality of the perovskite film was improved by APC treatment, which was in good agreement with the XRD results. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). RMS values of 55.3 nm and 48.4 nm were obtained for the control and APC-treated perovskite films (Fig. S7, ESI†), respectively, indicating that the introduction of APC slightly reduced the surface roughness of the perovskite films. In addition, all the perovskite films with or without APC-treatment exhibited a bandgap of 1.55 eV (Fig. S8, ESI†). A slight increase in the absorption intensity was observed for the APC treated perovskite film, which could be ascribed to the improved crystallinity.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was adopted to acquire the energy levels of the perovskites with or without APC treatment (Fig. 3d). The APC-treated film presented a Fermi level at −4.53 eV, deeper than that of the control film at −4.50 eV, indicating a more p-doped surface. This top-side p-dopant effect was beneficial for promoting charge transfer from the perovskite to the upper hole-transport layer. Compared to the control perovskite film (−5.44 eV), the deeper valence band maximum (−5.47 eV) for the APC-passivated perovskite also allowed achievement of a higher VOC.38
To evaluate the charge-carrier dynamics in perovskite films, steady photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopies were employed. The APC treated perovskite film showed a stronger PL intensity than that of the control film (Fig. 3e), implying a significantly improved film quality. When a quenching layer was introduced (SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD were chosen as the electron and hole extraction layers, respectively), the APC treated perovskite film showed a faster quenching of the PL signal compared with its control counterpart (Fig. S9, ESI†). The results indicated that the APC treated perovskite film exhibited an enhanced film quality and more efficient carrier quenching. The TRPL results (Fig. 3f) further confirmed this conclusion. The TRPL decay curves were fitted with a bi-exponential function (eqn (1)) and the fitted data are summarized in Table S1, ESI.† (1)where τ1 is the fast decay process related to bimolecular recombination, and τ2 is the slow decay process associated with trap-assisted recombination.14B is a constant for the baseline offset. A1 and A2 are constants representing the contributions of the fast and slow components, respectively.25 It was found that the APC treatment primarily impacted the slow decay process. The average PL decay lifetime can be obtained using eqn (2): (2)
The average PL lifetime (τave) for the control perovskite film was calculated to be 3799 ns. However, this value was remarkably enhanced to 4931 ns for the APC treated perovskite films. The ultralong carrier lifetimes in the microsecond range suggested that there were fewer non-radiative recombination pathways in the perovskite crystals, which was the prerequisite for high-quality polycrystalline films and led to high VOC.9,14,39 Besides, the charge-carrier diffusion length was another key factor reflecting the quality of light absorbers.40,41 The electron and hole diffusion lengths in the control and APC treated perovskite films were thus evaluated based on the TRPL results in the presence of a quenching layer. The charge-carrier diffusion length was calculated according to a simplified 1D diffusion model (eqn (3)):33,41 (3)where LD is the diffusion length, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and τD and τ are the PL average lifetimes of the perovskite film with or without the quenching layer, respectively. Fig. S10, ESI† and Table S1, ESI† show the TRPL results for both perovskite films with or without the quenching layer. It was clear that the generated charge-carrier could be more efficiently extracted by the quenching layer for the APC treated perovskite films than that of the control case. The fitting diffusion lengths are provided in Fig. S11, ESI.† Both the electron and hole diffusion lengths (LD,e and LD,h) for the control film were above 1000 nm. In contrast, the APC treated perovskite film showed much more prolonged diffusion lengths of 1937 nm and 4175 nm for electrons and holes, respectively. Over 4 μm of charge-carrier diffusion length was on par with that of single crystal perovskites.42
Photovolatic performance of PSCs
To evaluate the effect of the APC passivator on the photovoltaic (PV) performance, a planar device with a simple architecture FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 4a) was prepared, where FTO was fluorine-doped tin oxide and spiro-OMeTAD was 2,2',7,7'-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9'-spirobifluorene. The thicknesses of the compact SnO2, perovskite layer and hole transporting layer (HTL) were determined to be ∼25 nm, ∼600 nm and ∼240 nm from the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. S12, ESI†), respectively. Notably, the perovskite crystal directly contacted both charge transporting layers without grain boundaries in the vertical direction, which was conducive to carrier transportation and collection. Fig. S13, ESI† shows the statistical distribution of device performance (VOC, JSC, and FF, PCE) with different APC concentrations. With the average PCE increased from 22.16% to 24.55%, the optimal concentration of APC was observed to be 0.01 mg mL−1. Fig. 4b and Fig. S14, ESI† show the champion J–V characteristics of the control and APC treated devices under standard AM 1.5 G illumination (the PV parameters are summarized in Table 1). A PCE of 23.14%, JSC = 25.18 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.141 V and FF = 80.51% were obtained for the control device. However, the optimized APC-passivated device delivered the highest PCE of 25.17%, with JSC = 25.30 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.184 V and FF = 84.04%. Importantly, one APC treated device gave an ultrahigh FF of 84.76% (Fig. S15, ESI†), which is one of the highest reported values for planar PSCs so far.43–46 One of the best devices was sent to an accredited test center and a PCE of 24.51% and a FF of 84.64% were certified (Figs. S16–S19, ESI†). The remarkable enhancement in PCE is mainly reflected in the improved VOC and FF, which were ascribed to the suppressed non-radiative recombination and the reduced carrier extraction/transportation barrier at the interface.47 The VOC deficit for the champion device was calculated to be 0.37 V (Eg = 1.55 eV), which was smaller than the value observed in silicon solar cells (0.38 V).48 External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were collected for both devices and are plotted in Fig. 4c. The integrated photocurrent densities were calculated to be 24.60 and 24.78 mA cm−2 for the control and APC treated devices, respectively, both of which were comparable to the values extracted from the J–V curves (<3% deviation). Maximum output power point tracking (MPPT) was further performed to evaluate accurately the real output performance of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4d and Fig. S20, ESI,† the APC-passivated device stabilized at 25.0% (Vmpp = 1.02 V) for 600 s; however, the control device just gave an output efficiency of 22.9% (Vmpp = 0.98 V). The statistics for 60 individual cells also confirmed the excellent batch-to-batch reproducibility (Fig. 4e and Table S2, S3, ESI†). The results demonstrated the advantage and reliability of APC passivation in achieving high-performance PSCs.

To validate the compatibility and potential of the present strategy in the scalable fabrication of a perovskite film, a large area perovskite device was then prepared. As shown in Fig. S21 (ESI†), the APC-treated device with an aperture area of 1 cm2 exhibited an impressive PCE of 23.02%, which was superior to that of the control device (PCE = 21.43%), showing great potential in upscaling PSCs toward the practical development. To further verify the universality of APC in improving the device performance, an MA-free, CsFA perovskite system (Cs0.15FA0.85Pb(I0.95Br0.017Cl0.033)3) was selected as the light absorber because it has been recently reported to be thermally stable compared to the MA-containing perovskite. When the APC was introduced, the control device with an aperture area of 0.09 cm2 delivered a PCE of 22.17% (Fig. S22, ESI†), which was significantly improved to 23.89% along with a high FF of 83.30%. This is one of the highest efficiencies for MA-free CsFA based PSCs. These results indicated that the present strategy can not only be suitable in upscaling the active area of PSCs, but also be extended to different perovskite systems, demonstrating the excellent universality and compatibility in fabricating high efficiency and stable PSCs.
Analysis of traps and carriers
To understand deeply the improvement in PV performance, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was employed to examine the trap-state in perovskites with or without APC treatment. The trap density (nt) can be determined using eqn (4).49 (4)where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, nt is the trap density, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite (46.9),50 and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage (I–V) curves based on the electron-only and hole-injecting devices (Fig. S23, ESI†), respectively. The density of electron traps was calculated to be 1.33 × 1015 cm−3 for the APC treated device, which was lower than that of the control case (1.74 × 1015 cm−3). Meanwhile, the density of hole traps was reduced from 3.34 × 1015 cm−3 for the control device to 2.67 × 1015 cm−3 for the latter one (Fig. S23, ESI†). The reduced trap density was attributed to the synergistic effect of defect passivation and crystallization modulation by APC, leading to higher VOC and FF in the passivated device.51

(b) VOCvs. light intensity for the devices without and with APC treatment. (c) Mott–Schottky fitting to the capacitance–voltage (C−2–V) plots and (d) EIS of PSCs based on the control and APC treated perovskite films. 
To further explore the carrier recombination mechanism, the J–V curves under different light intensities were measured for both devices. Fig. S24, ESI† shows the power-law dependence of JSC on the incident light intensity (0.1 sun ≤ light intensity ≤ 1 sun). The control and APC treated devices both displayed a slope of 0.98, indicating that the bimolecular recombination was negligible and the predominant recombination mechanism was trap-assisted recombination.52Fig. 5b shows the relationship between light intensity and VOC.53 The ideality factor (n) was calculated to be 1.94 for the control device, which was reduced to 1.30 after APC was introduced. The results indicated that the trap-assisted non-radiative recombination process was suppressed effectively by introducing APC,54 which was in good agreement with the SCLC results. The built-in potential (Vbi) of the devices was extracted from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot to better understand the enhancement of the VOC (Fig. 5c).55 The Vbi was significantly improved from 1.09 V for the control device to 1.16 V for the APC-treated device, indicating an enhanced driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers, which agrees well with the improved trend of VOC.
To study the interfacial carrier transfer and transport kinetics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist plots for the control and APC-passivated devices at an applied bias voltage of 0 V under dark. The charge-transport resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec) were fitted using the Z-view software with the given equivalent circuit (Fig. 5d). The corresponding values are summarized in Table S4, ESI.†54 The APC treated device exhibited a lower Rtr and a higher Rrec compared with those of the control one, indicating a faster charge-carrier transfer and a lower recombination rate, in good agreement with the characterization results discussed above. The results indicated that more efficient charge transportation could be expected in the APC treated device, thus leading to higher VOC and FF values.56 In other words, the PV performance improvement of the APC treated device was attributed to the improved carrier lifetimes, reduced trap-state and suppressed non-radiative recombination.
Device stability
Besides the PCE, the device lifetime is also important for PSC commercialization. The stability of both devices stored in a N2 filled glovebox at room temperature was evaluated first. Fig. 6a–d and Table S5, ESI† show the main parameters for the control and APC-treated devices without encapsulation. A PCE of 23.96% was obtained for the APC treated device after 5 months of storage (Fig. S25, ESI†), which was more than 95% of its original efficiency (25.03%), whereas the control device remained at 92.6% of its initial efficiency, confirming the excellent storage stability of the devices in this work. After that, the operational stability of the unencapsulated devices was studied subsequently. As shown in Fig. 6e, the APC treated device retained over 93% of its original efficiency after 600 h of continuous MPP tracking under 1 sun illumination (white light LED array, N2 filled box, ∼30 °C), which was better than that of the control device (retained 75% of its initial PCE after 600 h of MPPT). The improved stability of APC treated PSCs was attributed to the improved crystal quality, prolonged charge-carrier lifetime, and reduced trap-state in the perovskite film. Our results demonstrated that synergistically improving both the crystallization and the defect passivation of perovskites could result in high efficiency and high stability at the same time for PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, a new ammonium salt of APC was introduced into the shallow layer and at the surface of perovskites for constructing high-performance PSCs. The existence of APC simultaneously improved the film quality and passivated the trap-state in perovskites. The electron-rich units (pyrimidine N, –NH2, and Cl−) within APC could not only passivate the charged defects through the formed interaction with under-coordinated Pb2+ and FA vacancies, but also synergistically regulate the crystallization process of perovskites. Finally, the charged traps were effectively reduced and the non-radiative recombination was significantly suppressed, along with the prolonged charge-carrier lifetime to about 5 μs. The best device delivered an impressive PCE of 25.17% (certified 24.51%), with a high VOC of 1.184 V, and an ultrahigh FF of over 84%. The unencapsulated device exhibited excellent long-term and operational stabilities. Our study suggests that the rational design of a passivator will improve perovskite crystallization and passivate its defects simultaneously. This work will also provide a facile strategy to realize highly efficient and excellent stable PSCs towards commercialization in the future.

Broader context
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductors have drawn tremendous attention in the photovoltaic field with a record efficiency of over 25%. However, it is still challenging to achieve a stable and reproducible high efficiency device. Here, an ammonium salt of 2-amidinopyrimidine hydrochloride (APC) was introduced into the shallow layer of a perovskite. The charged traps and crystallization of the perovskite were effectively regulated simultaneously, resulting in a PCE of 25.17% (certified 24.51%), with a notable VOC of 1.184 V, and an ultrahigh FF of over 84%. Moreover, the APC treated device exhibited excellent long-term operational stability, retaining more than 95% and 93% of its initial efficiencies after five months of storage in the dark and 600 h of continuous maximum output power point tracking (MPPT) under 1 sun illumination (white light LED array), respectively.
