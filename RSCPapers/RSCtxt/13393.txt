    , Accepted 13th November 2021First published on 23rd November 2021AbstractIn this work, we reported an energy-saving and cost-efficient process for the (re)generation of NaBH4 by ball milling hydrated borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) with a Mg–Al alloy under ambient conditions. The introduction of abundant and readily available Al can increase air stability of the reducing agent. A high yield up to 85.2% could be achieved by using Mg17Al12 because of its hardness and brittleness.
1. Introduction
Currently, widely depleted fossil fuels have caused severe air pollution issues and brought about the energy crisis. In this regard, it is highly desirable to develop alternative fuel sources based on clean and renewable energy, including wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro power. Clean and renewable energy must be stored owing to its features such as intermittent and location-dependent. Recently, it has been reported that Li batteries and whole hydrogen storage proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems with high energy densities can be efficient electrochemical energy storage devices.1 Owing to the extremely low volumetric energy density of H2 under ambient conditions, high-pressure compression and low-temperature liquefaction techniques have been adopted to improve the energy density in hydrogen media. However, these two high energy-denstity methods have some inevitable disadvantages, such as energy loss, high cost and safety issues, seriously hampering their further commercial applications. Alternatives, and in particular, chemical storage in hydrides with light weight elements, have therefore attracted much attention.2–4 Light weight hydrides possess a relatively high hydrogen capacity but suffer sluggish kinetics and unfavorable hydrogen reaction thermodynamics and have a high operating temperature. To improve the hydrogen storage properties of light-metal hydrides, various strategies have been adopted, such as introducing catalysts,5 fabricating composites,6 and nanostructuring.7–9 Nanostructuring can enlarge the specific surface area and shorten the mass transport path, which effectively enhances the thermodynamics and kinetics.7 Liu et al. prepared Ni nanocrystal-decorated LiBH4 nanoparticles (<10 nm) on graphene, and found that the LiBH4 nanocomposite could reversibly desorb and absorb ∼9.2 wt% H2 and exhibit a stable cycling behavior in 100 cycles at 300 °C.8 Recently, Liu et al. also realized a significant breakthrough in 30 °C reversible hydrogen storage (up to 6.7 wt% H2) with non-confined MgH2 nanoparticles of 4–5 nm.9 The prepared MgH2 nanoparticles represented a remarkable stability and rapidity in hydrogen cycling at 150 °C.9 However, numerous challenges in nanostructured materials for hydrogen storage remain to be addressed in the future, such as easy large-scale preparation and convenience for transport and storage. Thus, dehydrogenation of light weight hydrides by hydrolysis, represented by hydrolysis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4), becomes remarkably appealing because they have attractive features such as high hydrogen purity, a fast hydrogen evolution rate, and near-ambient operating conditions.10–12 However, to realize the practical use of NaBH4 as a hydrogen storage material for onboard hydrogen production, one serious challenge is the (re)generation of NaBH4 in an energy- and cost-efficient way.
Nowadays, various boron and protide (H−) suppliers have been utilized to (re)generate NaBH4. One of the current industrial methods of NaBH4 production is the Brown–Schlesinger process (225–275 °C):13 4NaH + B(OCH3)3 → NaBH4 + 3NaOCH3.(1)
B(OCH3)3 is a costly and flammable liquid. Thus, a lot of effort has been made to develop an approach to recycle dehydrated NaBO2 or Na2B4O7 (as alternatives to the boron source of B(OCH3)3) into NaBH4 since they can be recycled from the “spent fuel” as NaBO2·xH2O. NaBO2·xH2O reacts with CO2 from the air to form Na2B4O7·10H2O via the following reaction:14 4NaBO2·xH2O + CO2 + (10 − 4x)H2O → Na2B4O7·10H2O + Na2CO3.(2)
The water of crystallization can be thoroughly removed by dehydrating at temperatures over 350 °C in NaBO2·xH2O and at approximately 600 °C in Na2B4O7·10H2O.15,16 Apart from NaH, another commonly used protide supplier, MgH2, has also been used to react with NaBO2 to regenerate NaBH4 at 550 °C under 7 MPa H2.17 Owing to the high cost of metal hydrides, Mg is used as a substitute to react with NaBO2 (or Na2B4O7) in the presence of high H2 pressure by annealing at high temperatures,17–20 but the yield of NaBH4 decreases significantly. Al is also used to react with NaBO2via annealing at 400–650 °C under 2.3 MPa H2 to regenerate NaBH4.21 However, NaBH4 cannot be formed because condensed Al2O3 is formed on Al surfaces, which restricts mass transfer.21 Interestingly, NaBH4 is successfully synthesized after introducing Na2O, which enables the formation of loose NaAlO2 (with a lower oxygen gradient) instead of Al2O3.21 The yield of NaBH4 reaches up to 65.8% by annealing Na4B2O5 (2NaBO2 + Na2O), NaBO2, and Na2O with Al under the same conditions.21 All these reactions mentioned above require harsh conditions (high temperature and/or high H2 pressure), causing safety and energy-intensive issues. It also should be noted that a high-temperature dehydration process of NaBO2·xH2O (or Na2B4O7·10H2O) and an expensive additional protide supplier (metal hydride or high-pressure H2 gas) is needed, which further leads to the increase of energy consumption and costs.
In this regard, it is a good choice to consider the hydrated NaBO2 and Na2B4O7 as boron sources and protide suppliers without dehydration. Unfortunately, the yield of NaBH4 was only 12.3% by annealing NaBO2·2H2O with Mg at 600 °C under 3 MPa H2.22 This could be attributed to the fact that a thicker layer of MgO on the Mg surfaces may be formed with increasing the water of crystallization content in hydrated NaBO2, which significantly decreases the kinetic properties of NaBH4 formation. Oxide layers such as MgO on the metal can be destroyed and fresh surfaces can be generated simultaneously during the ball milling. Ball milling can also enrich grain defects/boundaries and shorten mass transport paths. These are conducive to continuous reaction and improving the overall kinetics of NaBH4 formation. Thus, many researchers14,23 tried ball milling hydrated NaBO2 and Na2B4O7 with cheap Mg; the highest yields of NaBH4 are 68.55% and 78.6% for NaBO2·2H2O and for Na2B4O7·10H2O–Na2CO3, respectively. Although the yield can be improved by applying a ball-milling process, the regeneration of NaBH4via a mechanochemical reaction suffers from the low ball-milling efficiency of light metals (Mg) arising from their sticky issues.
Herein, instead of metallic Mg, hard and brittle Mg–Al intermediate phases as cheap reducing agents were adopted to (re)generate NaBH4 from Na2B4O7·10H2O (merits attention as much as NaBO2·xH2O) through ball milling. It should be noted that the more abundant and readily available aluminum (Al) in the alloy can be oxidized into a higher valence than Mg but with similar reducibility, which allows for taking more oxygen from Na2B4O7·10H2O to form NaBH4. The introduction of Al can also increase the air stability of the reducing agent, rendering Mg–Al alloy convenient for transport and storage. In this process, the high energy and cost associated with dehydration (600 °C) and with high-pressure H2 gas are avoided, and the dosage of metal hydrides reduces due to the intrinsic hydrogen source in the hydrated borax. Therefore, this method is expected to be useful for the scalable (re)generation of NaBH4.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
The reducing agent Mg17Al12 was available from Aike Reagent (China) and the reducing agent Mg2Al3 was in-house prepared by melting Mg and Al metals. The resulting Mg2Al3 ingots were first polished to remove the oxide layer and pulverized using a saw. The sawed powders were used for the synthesis without further sieving. The XRD patterns of the reducing agents together with the standard PDF cards are shown in Fig. S1.† All chemicals: Na2B4O7·10H2O (ACS-grade, Aladdin), NaH (≥90%, Sigma-Aldrich), ethylenediamine (C2H8N2, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich), H2SO4 (GR, Aladdin), NaOH (≥99%, Aladdin), KIO3 (AR-grade, Aladdin), KI (≥99%, Aladdin), starch indicator (≥99%, Aladdin), and Na2S2O3 solution (1 M, AR grade, Aladdin), were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis
In each experiment, a mixture of Na2B4O7·xH2O (x = 5, 10), NaH, and Mg17Al12/Mg2Al3 (1 g) was placed into an 80 mL grinding bowl with a ball-to-powder ratio of 50:1 in the glove box filled with Ar (O2 and H2O concentrations below 0.1 ppm). Ball milling was carried out in a shaker mill (QM-3C, Nanjing, China) at 1200 cycles per min (CPM) under 0.1 MPa Ar and at ambient temperature. The shaker mill generates mainly an impact force with high energy benefiting the mechanochemical reactions, while the planetary mill with a lower rotation speed supplies lower energy (in friction, shear, and impact modes).24 As known from previous studies, shaker mills could more effectively promote the NaBH4 formation compared to planetary mills.25 The milling process was performed for every half hour to avoid overheating. The milling times mentioned in this work do not include the pauses. NaBH4 was extracted from the ball-milled products (about 0.6 g) using 20 mL C2H8N2 and then separated from the by-products and remaining reactants using a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (0.45 μm in pore size) under an Ar atmosphere at room temperature. The extract solution was dried for 24 h in a freeze dryer (Martin Christ, Alpha 1-2LD plus, Germany) to obtain solid NaBH4. The solvent (C2H8N2) was captured by the cold trap of the freeze dryer (about −50 °C).
2.3 Characterization and quantification
The surface morphology of the samples was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Zeiss Supra-40). Phase identification of the as-synthesized samples was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; PANalytical Empyrean) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 45 kV and 40 mA. The chemical bonds of the samples were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet IS50). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded using a Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha, and the spectral data were analyzed by using XPSPEAK Fit 4.1 software. Solid-state 11B MAS NMR (Bruker Avance III HD) was also applied to analyze the coordination environment of the boron atoms in the ball-milled products. The yield of NaBH4 was quantitatively determined by iodometric analysis25 and calculated according to the following equation (eqn (3)):26 Yield = [(the obtained mass of NaBH4)/ (the theoretical mass of NaBH4)] × 100%.(3)
The theoretical amount of NaBH4 was based on a full conversion, meaning that 1 mole of Na2B4O7·xH2O (x = 5, 10) is converted to 4 moles of NaBH4.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Using Mg17Al12 for NaBH4 (re)generation
According to our previous study,27 an additive (NaH) containing no oxygen was added to the reaction environment for the compensation of the sodium deficiency, which then promotes the formation of NaBH4. In Fig. S2,† XRD patterns and FTIR spectra unambiguously clarify the existence of NaBH4, which is generated through ball-milling NaH and Na2B4O7·10H2O at different molar ratios in the presence of Mg17Al12 for 20 h. NaBH4 was further purified from the as-milled product and then identified via XRD, FTIR, and SEM as shown in Fig. S3.† The XRD patterns of the purified product are similar to those of commercial NaBH4 (Fig. S3a†). None of the additional peaks could be observed. In Fig. S3b,† the purified NaBH4 displays an almost identical FTIR spectrum as the commercial NaBH4. The peaks at 2200–2425 and 1126 cm−1 are ascribed to the B–H stretching and deformation vibrations of pure NaBH4, respectively.14,27,28 Of note, the microstructure of the (re)generated NaBH4 observed in the SEM appears to be cubic with a particle dimension of several microns, which is in accordance with the commercial NaBH4 (Fig. S3c and e†). In summary, NaBH4 with high purity and a similar microstructure as commercial NaBH4 was successfully (re)generated via directly ball-milling a mixture of Mg17Al12, Na2B4O7·10H2O, and NaH under ambient conditions. The reaction conditions are quite mild, in comparison with previous studies which require high hydrogen pressure and temperatures.17–20,29

Fig. 1a gives a comparison of Mg, Al and Mg17Al12 reacted with NaH and Na2B4O7·10H2O at different molar ratios. As expected, the yield of NaBH4 for Mg17Al12 was improved as the NaH content increased and the yield reached ∼57.7% when the molar ratio was 4:1. Here, the reasons for the improvement of yield may lie in three aspects. First, the brittleness of NaH working as a dispersant and cutter relieves the materials sticking onto the reactor and increases the total surface of the particles in contact, enhancing the ball milling efficiency. This is supported by decreasing the contents of Fe and Cr (peeling off the balls and jar) in the as-milled products with more NaH, similar to Mg and Al as the reducing agents (Table S1†). Second, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of Fe2B decrease with increasing content of NaH (Fig. S2a†), indicating that the decomposition of NaBH4 decreases, which is consistent with previous studies.14 Third, when more NaH was used, the formation of NaAlO2 in contrast to Al2O3 results in fast NaBH4 formation kinetics (Fig. S2b†), as described in section 3.3. Herein, NaH plays an important role in the synthesis of NaBH4 from Na2B4O7·10H2O when Al is introduced in the reduction process by using Mg17Al12 as the reducing agent. However, the yield for Mg17Al12 decreases when too much NaH is loaded for the same reasons as for the Mg reducing agent. This is likely because a molar ratio higher than 4:1 (NaH:Na2B4O7·10H2O) causes some NaH to stay unreacted and decreases effective contact between Mg17Al12 and borates (Fig. S4†).

Yet, the yield of 57.7% is still not satisfactory. To further optimize the yield of NaBH4, the initial loading of Mg17Al12 was increased. Fig. 1b and c show the XRD patterns and FTIR spectra of the products obtained by ball-milling Mg17Al12 and Na2B4O7·10H2O with different molar ratios, respectively. The intensities of the XRD diffraction peaks and FTIR peaks corresponding to NaBH4 are the strongest when the molar ratio is 0.850:1 (Mg17Al12:Na2B4O7·10H2O), indicating the maximum yield of NaBH4. This is consistent with the iodometric analysis results, showing that the yield increases with the increasing amounts of Mg17Al12 and reaches ∼85.2% for a ratio of 0.850:1 (Fig. 1d). The highest yield of 85.2% is slightly lower than that of the NaBO2·2H2O–MgH2 system in our previous study (90.0%; Table S2†)30 because of the higher reactivity of MgH2 than Mg17Al12. But the highest yield in this study is much higher than the one in the literature for even those processes using expensive MgH2 as the reducing agent (Table S2†).14,17,20,22,23,25,26,31,32 Compared with previously reported methods using MgH2 as the reducing agent, the cost of this process is around 17-fold lower (Table S3†). The reason for such a high yield lies in that the brittle intermetallic powder particles (Mg17Al12) are ground more severely, resulting in an increased contact area between the reactants with a reduction in the particle size and allowing fresh surfaces to come into contact repeatedly. Mg17Al12 was substituted with the same content of Mg and Al collectively worked as a reducing agent to (re)generate NaBH4 in the same way. As expected, the yield of NaBH4 for Mg17Al12 is much higher than that for Mg + Al (Fig. S5†). Besides, a per gram Mg17Al12 output of NaBH4 for a 0.850:1 ratio is also the highest (Fig. 1d). When the molar ratio increased to 0.850:1, the diffraction peaks assigned to Al start to be visible, apart from NaBH4 and MgO (Fig. 1b(4)). For the 1:1 ratio, the atomic ratio of Mg and O in the raw materials is 1:1. Therefore, Mg is enough to seize oxygen from hydrated borax and to support the formation of NaBH4, resulting in considerable Al being unconsumed, as evidenced by the significant intensities of the diffraction peaks of Al (Fig. 1b). Mg in Mg17Al12 seems to react earlier than Al, which will be discussed later.
Energy consumption here mainly depends on the ball-milling time. The impact of the reaction time on the yield was also investigated (Fig. 1e). For the optimal ratio (0.850:1), the yield increases slowly first and then increases significantly and finally levels off after 20 h of milling. Long ball-milling time generates a fresh surface and creates the opportunity for the reactants to react further. As seen in Fig. 1f and Fig. S6,† it is found that the intensities of the diffraction peaks and FTIR peaks of NaBH4 increase with the reaction time. After 4 h of ball milling, the diffraction peaks of Mg17Al12 disappear, in contrast to the appearance of the diffraction peaks of Al and MgO instead. The diffraction peaks of Al are very broad, indicating a small grain size, which is favorable to the mass transfer and beneficial for the complete reaction of Al in the reduction process. With increasing reaction time, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of MgO increase significantly, while those of Al remain almost unchanged until 10 h. This confirms that Mg in Mg17Al12 precedes Al in the process of the reactions because the reducibility of Mg (electronegativity (χp):1.31) is slightly stronger than Al (χp:1.61).
3.2 Using Mg2Al3 for NaBH4 (re)generation
Given that Al can offer more electrons to prepare NaBH4, Mg17Al12 was replaced by Mg2Al3 (another Mg–Al intermediate phase with a higher Al content) to generate NaBH4. According to Fig. 2a and b, the (re)generation of NaBH4 is also achieved. Furthermore, the microstructure and morphology of the purified NaBH4 are similar to the commercial NaBH4 (Fig. S3†). Generally, the intensities of the characteristic peaks of NaBH4 in the XRD patterns and FTIR spectra increase firstly and then decrease with increasing amounts of Mg2Al3 (Fig. 2a and b). The yield of NaBH4 firstly increases and then decreases (Fig. 2c). The optimum molar ratio is 3.28:1 with a maximum yield of 53.0%. Although the yield is not very attractive, Al makes a greater contribution to the synthesis of NaBH4.

3.3 Reaction mechanism
In order to study the reaction mechanism, Mg17Al12, NaH, and Na2B4O7·10H2O mixtures were ball-milled at different times. Fig. 3a shows the XRD patterns of the raw Na2B4O7·10H2O and the as-milled products. The XRD diffraction peaks of Na2B4O7·10H2O and NaH disappear after 10 min of ball milling, in contrast to the appearance of the diffraction peaks of Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5·5H2O shown in Fig. 3a(2). The formed Na-rich boron compounds are critical intermediates in the formation process of NaBH4, especially Na4B2O5·5H2O, which is composed of 2NaBO2 and 1Na2O.21,33 Na2O would react with the condensed Al2O3 (the ratio of O/M = 3:2, M: metal elements) layer on Al particles to form porous NaAlO2 (O/M = 1:1) to decrease the oxygen gradient in the product layer, resulting in higher mobility of O2− and H− ions in the product layer and promoting NaBH4 formation.21,34 Meanwhile, a considerable amount of H2 is formed (Fig. 3c(2)). It is well established that NaH can easily react with H2O to produce NaOH and H2. Considering the formation of H2, Na2[BO2(OH)], and Na4B2O5·5H2O, it is assumed that (1) NaH first reacts with the coordinated water in Na2B4O7·10H2O to form H2 and NaOH, and (2) NaOH reacts with borax to transform into Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5·5H2O, which is confirmed by the previous results.35 It should be pointed out that NaH serves as a small part of the hydrogen source for the (re)generation of NaBH4. H− in NaH transforms into H2 (H0), and then H2 (H0) comes back to H−, which finally gets stored in BH4− (see below). As the milling increases to 2 h, besides a small quantity of Mg17Al12, the XRD diffraction peaks of Al become highly visible, while those of Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5·5H2O disappear (Fig. 3a(4)). None of the XRD patterns of NaBH4 can be observed, indicating a low content and weak crystallization. The generation of NaBH4 could be verified by the appearance of typical BH4 bands (1126 and 2200–2425 cm−1) in Fig. 3b(4) and [BH4]− resonance (−42.1 ppm) in Fig. 3d(3).23,36 As the ball-milling time reaches 5 h, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of Al increase, while those of Mg17Al12 decrease and almost disappear, along with the appearance of the diffraction peaks of MgO. After 10 h of milling, the intensities of the diffraction peaks of MgO and NaBH4 become stronger, while the intensities of Al peaks decrease. Although the diffraction peaks of the oxidized phase of Al could not be observed, the characterized peaks of NaAlO2 (878, 811, 723 and 430–650 cm−1) are clearly detected by using FTIR (Fig. 3b(6,7)).37 In Fig. 3b(6,7), the FTIR bands of 811 and 430–650 cm−1 correspond to the O–O triangular species and the vibrations of the Al–O bond in AlO2−, respectively,37 which is consistent with the XPS results (Fig. S7†). In 10 h-milled raw Mg17Al12 powders, the coexistence of Al0 (Al2p at 71.1 eV) and Al3+ (Al 2p at 73.2 and 74.1 eV corresponding to the tetrahedral and octahedral states of Al3+, respectively) indicates the formation of Al2O3 due to slight oxidation of Mg17Al12.38,39 After 10 h of ball milling Mg17Al12, NaH, and Na2B4O7·10H2O, the peaks of Al0 and the octahedral state of Al3+ almost disappear, demonstrating the conversion of Al0 into Al3+. Since Al3+ adopts a tetrahedral coordination, NaAlO2 is more likely to be formed than Al2O3.38,39 NaAlO2 appears to be amorphous, which is consistent with previous studies.40 Therefore, Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5·5H2O react with Mg17Al12 in the presence of in situ formed H2 to generate NaBH4, MgO and Al, and then react with in situ formed Al to generate NaBH4 and NaAlO2.

To confirm H2 participating in the above reaction, a semi-quantitative assay of the H2 concentration change in the gas phase was established by using argon as an internal standard. It is found that the content of H2 in the jar first increases and then decreases, indicating that H2 is also an intermediate in the formation process of NaBH4 (Fig. 3c).
The as-milled products were also investigated using FTIR (Fig. 3b) and solid-sate 11B magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra (Fig. 3d). As shown in Fig. 3b, the peaks at 947 and 1300–1500 cm−1, correspond to the B–O asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of Na2[BO2(OH)], respectively.41 The vibration peaks of the B–O bond in Na4B2O5·5H2O are also at around 947 and 1300–1500 cm−1.35 The intensities of the FTIR peaks of the B–O bonds decrease, while those of the B–H bonds increase with increasing milling time, which indicates that O in Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5 is gradually replaced by H to generate NaBH4. This is in accordance with the NMR results (Fig. 3d). In Fig. 3d(3,4), the 11B MAS NMR spectra of the 2 h- and 10 h-milled products show a resonance at around −13.3 ppm assigned to [BOH2]−.36,42 According to the inductive effect, the resonance at around −2.4 ppm may be ascribed to [BO2H]2− because O decreases the electron cloud density around B and weakens the shielding effect, resulting in an increase in the chemical shift (δ).
Based on the analysis above, a reaction mechanism was proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 3e. Na4B2O5 can be written as Na2O·2NaBO2. H2 diffuses to the Mg or Al surface and dissociates to convert into H−. Mg or Al is converted into Mg2+ or Al3+. Mg and Al are more likely to bond with O to form a more stable compound in thermodynamics ( of MgO: −569.3 kJ mol−1 oxygen;  of Al2O3: −527.4 kJ mol−1 oxygen; ΔGf° of B2O3: −398.1 kJ mol−1 oxygen). As shown in Fig. 3e(1), in view of the electrostatic interaction between Na+ and O2− with a single bond to B, O2− with a double bond to B is easier to be taken away by Mg2+ or Al3+ under the condition of ball milling.36 Then B accepts two H− and forms the NaBOH2 intermediate. Then, O2− in NaBOH2 is still replaced by two H− to form NaBH4, as shown in Fig. 3e(2). In Fig. 3e(3), the B–O bond (bond length: 1.35 Å) in Na2[BO2(OH)] is stronger than the B–OH bond (bond length: 1.439 Å).43 Besides, O2− is attracted by Na+ due to the electrostatic interaction. Thus, the B–OH bond preferentially breaks, and B forms a bond with H−, while OH− forms a bond with Mg2+ or Al3+. The [BO2H]2− anionic group detected in the NMR spectra is formed (Fig. 3e(3)). Then, one of the O2− atoms is replaced by H− to form [BOH2]−, and the other O2− atom in the generated NaBOH2 is substituted with H− in the same way as shown in Fig. 3e(2).
Mg17Al12 was substituted with Mg2Al3 to understand the reaction in the same way. The XRD, FTIR, XPS, MS and NMR results (Fig. S8†) indicated similar features, microstructure, and phase evolution as the sample of Mg17Al12. The mechanisms of Mg17Al12 and Mg2Al3 are almost the same.
Through the reaction mechanism analysis, it is confirmed that the water of crystallization in Na2B4O7·10H2O can be used as a protide (H−) supplier for the NaBH4 (re)generation. The troublesome heat-wasting process to obtain Na2B4O7 from Na2B4O7·10H2O by drying at approximately 600 °C can be waived. In this method, a large proportion of H2 is generated in situ to form H−, reducing the expensive hydrogen source (metal hydride (H−) or H2 (H0)) consumption and simplifying the process.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the (re)generation of NaBH4 in a high yield can be achieved by ball-milling Na2B4O7·10H2O, NaH, and Mg–Al intermediate phases under ambient conditions. The highest yield of 85.2% was obtained after 20 h of ball-milling for the Mg17Al12, Na2B4O7·10H2O, and NaH mixtures with a 0.850:1:4 molar ratio, which is higher than those in previously reported references even in comparison with the methods using expensive MgH2. Mg in the Mg–Al alloy preferentially reacts leaving Al. NaH plays an important role in NaBH4 formation and achieves the transformation of Na2B4O7·10H2O into Na-rich boron compounds. Na4B2O5·5H2O is composed of 2NaBO2 and 1Na2O that would react with condensed Al2O3 on in situ formed fine-grain Al particles to form porous NaAlO2, which is helpful to make full use of Al in the generation process of NaBH4. O in Na2[BO2(OH)] and Na4B2O5 was gradually replaced by H to generate NaBH4, which is confirmed by [BO2H]2− and [BOH2]− detected by NMR. Using the cheap H source in hydrated borax and the inexpensive Mg17Al12/Mg2Al3 alloy can lead to economical and efficient (re)generation of NaBH4. Compared with the use of MgH2 as a reducing agent, the raw material cost is reduced by 17-fold with no requirement of additional hydrogenation of Mg. Generation of hydrogen for the hydrogenation of Mg originally from a separate hydrogen production process is still a challenge using renewable sources. Thus, this method is very promising to prompt the practical use of NaBH4.
