    , Accepted 2nd August 2019First published on 2nd August 2019AbstractThe rational design and development of advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting based on porous monolithic carbon as a host matrix of earth-abundant transition metals (TMs) is highly desirable and actively pursued owing to their promising practical applications, but remains a grand challenge. Herein, a wood-derived N-doped hierarchically porous monolithic carbon (N-HPMC) matrix embedded with Co nanoparticles (Co@N-HPMC) is fabricated by direct two-step carbonization of natural wood (NW) loaded with Co/CoOx. The monolithic N-HPMC matrix has numerous aligned and open microchannels, abundant porosity, and high conductivity, which afford rapid electron transfer and mass transport, while the embedded Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) have high dispersion and a strong synergistic interaction with the N-HPMC matrix, which offer an abundance of highly active sites. As a result, the monolithic Co@N-HPMC electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic water splitting performance in 1.0 M KOH, and it requires overpotentials of 128 and 297 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. More notably, an alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting (OWS) assembled by employing Co@N-HPMC as both the cathode and anode achieves current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 at cell voltages of 1.77 and 2.16 V, respectively. This study provides an effective strategy to fabricate noble-metal-free high-performance monolithic electrocatalysts for commercial applications.
Introduction
Future energy supply based on the clean and renewable hydrogen (H2) will substantially reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, addressing the issues of increasing energy crisis and environmental pollution.1–4 Sustainable H2 production accompanied by O2 production through electrocatalytic water splitting reaction in an alkaline or proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer has provided an appealing approach to convert and store energy from renewable resources such as solar and wind energy.5–8 To alleviate the sluggish kinetics of the two half-reactions, that is, the HER and OER, affordable, sustainable and active electrocatalysts are urgently needed.9,10 Currently, Pt-based materials and Ir/Ru oxides are benchmark HER and OER catalysts under strongly acidic and basic conditions, respectively.11–13 However, their scarce nature and high cost considerably limit large-scale implementation in industrial devices. Thus, earth-abundant alternatives are being extensively sought,11,14–20 primarily based on transition-metal-based compounds including sulfides,21–25 selenides,26,27 phosphides,28–34 carbides,35–37 borides,35,38 nitrides,37,39,40 and metal-free carbon nanomaterials.41,42 However, only a few of the developed catalytic materials could compatibly function well as both HER and OER electrocatalysts in the same electrolyte with satisfactory activity.24,25,30,31,38,40 Consequently, there still exists a strong demand for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts, yet a grand challenge still remains.
Equally importantly, for practical application of powdery electrocatalysts, insulating polymer binders and conductive additives need to be used to immobilize the powdery active materials on conductive substrates, which will inevitably lead to the blocking of active sites and unfavorable mass and electron transport, thereby suppressing their electrocatalytic activity and stability. Therefore, the practical implementation of electrocatalytic water splitting for energy conversion also hinges on innovative breakthroughs regarding the development of self-supported electrocatalysts that can largely avoid the tedious slurry-based electrode assembly process and enhance mass transfer. To this end, various transition-metal-based nanostructured electrocatalysts have been directly grown on various current collectors (metal substrates, carbon cloth, carbon paper, etc.), affording a number of high-performance self-supported electrodes with controllable morphology, large electrochemical surface area, and abundant active sites.43–52 However, electron and mass transport within the nanostructured materials with a length scale even up to micrometers cannot be fully ensured owing to the insulating/semiconducting nature of catalytic materials. Alternatively, directly integrating/embedding catalytically active materials within a highly conductive porous monolithic carbon matrix would be expected to lead to a self-supported electrode with improved electrocatalytic performance due to the formation of built-in electron and mass transfer channels for facilitating the reaction kinetics and strong synergistic effect between the embedded active materials and carbon matrix for optimizing the electronic structure of active sites.53–55
In this work, inspired by the 3D hierarchically porous structure with open microchannels of natural wood (NW),56–58 we design and develop an effective and cost-efficient strategy to fabricate a monolithic porous carbon-based electrode by two-step carbonization of a Co (Co/CoOx)-modified NW slice, as an active and stable electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER in alkaline solution, as well as their coupled OWS reaction. During the topological thermal transformation of Co-modified NW, the NW slice was formulated into a N-doped hierarchically porous monolithic carbon (N-HPMC) matrix with elongated and open microchannels (∼several tens to hundreds of μm) interconnected by hierarchically porous walls (average pore size: ∼4.0 nm), while the Co species are converted to small metallic Co NPs (<100 nm) embedded uniformly within the N-HPMC matrix, leading to a monolithic Co@N-HPMC electrode. This structurally integrated Co@N-HPMC electrode has several unique advantages including high graphitization of the N-HPMC matrix, large surface area (249 m2 g−1), and strongly coupled contacts between the embedded Co NPs and N-HPMC matrix. Specifically, the N-HPMC matrix possesses good conductivity for fast electron transfer and interconnected porous frameworks for rapid diffusion of electrolyte and gas products, while the embedded Co NPs with high dispersion and small size establish intimate contact with the N-doped graphene shells. As a result, these merits cause the Co@N-HPMC electrode to show excellent bifunctional catalytic performances toward the HER and OER with an overpotential of 128 mV and 297 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, when employed as both the anode and cathode, Co@N-HPMC also exhibits a high OWS activity with cell voltages of 1.77 and 2.16 V to reach current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. More importantly, the structural integration of this electrode avoids the tedious slurry-based electrode assembly process with no need of using conductive additives and binders, and it can be directly used for large-scale practical applications. The nature-inspired strategy developed in this work not only provides a highly efficient Co@N-HPMC electrode for water splitting electrocatalysis, but would also be expected to be easily extended to prepare other noble-metal-free TMs@N-HPMC electrodes with excellent performances for large-scale electrochemical energy conversion.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
All reagents including cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and anhydrous ethanol were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. The basswood used in this study was received from the Ruiyi Wood Industry Company (China). All solutions were prepared with ultrapure water.
Fabrication of the Co@N-HPMC electrode
The Co@N-HPMC electrode was synthesized by hydrothermally loading Co species into the natural wood sheet followed by a two-step carbonization process. In a typical procedure, the natural basswood was first cut perpendicular to its growth direction into thin slices (2 cm × 3 cm × 2 mm), which were then immersed into an ethanol solution of Co(NO3)2 (5 mg mL−1) and hydrothermally heated at 180 °C for 6 h in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to load Co species into the pores of the wood slices (Co/CoOx@NW-HT). After washing and drying, the Co/CoOx@NW-HT was pre-carbonized in air in a muffle furnace at 260 °C for 6 h, and the obtained sample was denoted as Co/CoOx@NW-LT. Finally, the Co/CoOx@NW-LT was transferred into a quartz tube furnace and then carbonized at 1000 °C for 6 h with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1 under a flow of N2 gas (40 mL min−1). The thus-obtained sample was denoted as Co@N-HPMC.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken with an FEI Talos F200s field emission transmission electron microscope. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a SHIMADZU SSX-550 scanning electron microscope. Power X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 5–80° with a scanning rate of 5° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out using a Kratos Axis Supra spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operating at 225 W, a multichannel plate, and a delay line detector under a vacuum of 1 × 10−9 mbar. The survey and high-resolution spectra were collected at fixed analyzer pass energies of 160 and 40 eV, respectively. Binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak (set at 284.8 eV) of the sp2 hybridized carbon from the sample. Raman spectra were collected using a Raman spectrometer system (Horiba Evolution) using 532 nm. The specific surface area was determined with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation at 77 K by using an adsorption apparatus (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD 88). Temperature-dependent conductivity of the samples was measured by a four-probe technique using a quantum design physical property measurement system (PPMS-6000). The loading amount of Co was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (Varian 710-ES).
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell using a CHI760E potentiostat (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The as-fabricated Co@N-HPMC electrode was polished to the desired thickness (∼600 μm) and soldered to a piece of Cu wire as the working electrode. A graphite rod and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential vs. RHE was calibrated as E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 1.0072 V. The reference electrode calibration was performed in a high purity hydrogen saturated electrolyte solution with Pt wire as the working and counter electrode, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†). The current–voltage curve was scanned at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and the average of the two potentials at which the current crossed zero was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions. The HER and OER polarization curves were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. All polarization curves were corrected with iRs drop compensation. Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the uncompensated solution resistance (Rs). EIS for the HER and OER was carried out in 1.0 M KOH solution in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 10 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV. The stability tests for the Co@N-HPMC were conducted using chronoamperometry at a constant applied overpotential. A two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer was assembled by using Co@N-HPMC as the cathode and anode to perform OWS reaction in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by measuring the capacitance of the double layer at the solid–liquid interface by cyclic voltammetry (CV), which was performed in a potential window where the faradaic current on the working electrode is negligible.
For the measurement of faradaic efficiency, an air-tight two-compartment three-electrode electrochemical cell was used, where the working and reference electrodes were separated from the counter electrode. The working electrode compartment of the cell was degassed and saturated with N2 at 10 mL min−1 for at least 15 min. During the electrolysis, N2 gas was continuously bubbled into the cathodic compartment at a rate of 10 mL min−1. The eluent was delivered directly to the sampling loop of an on-line gas chromatograph (PANNA-A91 Plus) equipped with a molecular sieve-13X (60/80) column. High purity nitrogen (99.999%) was used as the carrier.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the synthesis process of the Co@N-HPMC electrode. Firstly, a piece of NW was cut perpendicular to the growth direction into thin slices (thickness: 2 mm). Then, the Co species (Co/CoOx) were in situ loaded into a NW slice (denoted as Co/CoOx@NW-HT) via a hydrothermal treatment method (step 1). The successful loading of Co species was first observed by the colour change from light yellow for NW to brown for the resultant Co/CoOx@NW-HT. During the hydrothermal treatment process, the cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin within the NW can be partially removed (see the XRD results below). Following that, direct two-step carbonization of the Co/CoOx@NW-HT slice resulted in a hierarchically porous monolithic Co@N-HPMC electrode. Briefly, Co/CoOx@NW-HT was first pre-carbonized in an air flow at 260 °C for 6 h (step 2) (denoted as Co/CoOx@NW-LT) and consequently carbonized at 1000 °C for 6 h in an N2 flow (step 3). Shrinkage of the slice dimensions during carbonization processes was accompanied by weight reduction. During the two-step carbonization process, the preloaded Co species were reduced to Co NPs, while the NW slice was topologically transformed into a N-HPMC matrix with a well-retained macroscopic structure,58 resulting in a monolithic Co@N-HPMC electrode. Importantly, the 3D hierarchically porous framework of the Co@N-HPMC electrode with aligned and open microchannels will greatly facilitate mass transfer such as permeation of the electrolyte toward active sites and release of the gases produced during the HER and OER processes.58 In addition, the conductive N-HPMC matrix not only contributes a fast pathway for charge transfer to in situ embedded Co NPs but also contributes to the regulation of the electronic structure of the active sites of Co NPs via heteroatom doping.59
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of the Co@N-HPMC electrode. 
The phase structure evolution during the synthesis of the Co@N-HPMC electrode was first investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization (Fig. 2a). The XRD pattern of NW shows the presence of cellulose (peaks I and II) and hemicellulose (peak III), which are preferentially oriented in the cell wall of NW.60 After Co species are loaded into the NW via the hydrothermal treatment, the crystalline diffraction peaks ascribed to cellulose and hemicellulose significantly weaken in the resultant Co/CoOx@NW-HT due to the partial dissolution of cellulose and hemicellulose, which will leave more open channels for the loading of Co species. It should also be noted that no characteristic peaks of Co species (Co, CoOx, and Co(OH)2) could be observed, indicating that the loaded Co species inside the NW matrix are amorphous. After low temperature carbonization, only featureless broadened diffraction peaks could be observed for the resultant Co/CoOx@NW-LT, suggesting that the residual cellulose and hemicellulose could be carbonized and converted to amorphous carbon species, and the loaded Co species are still amorphous. After high temperature carbonization, apart from the strong Bragg peaks located at 2θ values of 26.0° and 42.8° corresponding to the (002) and (100) lattice planes of graphitic carbon,54,55,61 respectively, peaks at 2θ values of 44.2, 51.6, and 75.9° could also be clearly identified, which respectively correspond to the (111), (200), (220) planes of metallic Co in the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase in Co@N-HPMC.62 Also, it can be noted that the Bragg peaks of the C phase for N-HPMC without Co NPs are obviously weaker than those of Co@N-HPMC (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating that the embedding of Co NPs would improve the crystallinity of N-HPMC during the carbonization processes.54,55

(e) N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of the Co@N-HPMC electrode and the corresponding pore size distribution (inset). (f) The conductivity measured for N-HMPC and Co@N-HPMC electrodes using a temperature-dependent four-probe method. 
The structural evolution was further investigated by Raman analysis. Fig. 2b shows that no characteristic peaks could be observed in NW and Co/CoOx@NW-HT, while only one very weak peak occurs at 1588 cm−1 corresponding to graphitic carbon in the Co/CoOx@NW-LT sample,61 indicating that the pyrolysis process is essentially necessary to promote the graphitization of the NW matrix; however, the low temperature is not effective for obtaining a high degree of graphitization. After high temperature carbonization, the obtained Co@N-HPMC electrode exhibits two characteristic peaks at 1352 and 1589 cm−1, which represent disordered carbon (D-band) and graphitic carbon (G-band),61 respectively. In addition, a sharp 2D band at 2685 cm−1 is also observed, which indicates that the graphitic carbon in Co@N-HPMC has high crystallinity.54 As an indicator of the degree of graphitization of carbon materials, the relative intensity ratio of D to G-band of Co@N-HPMC (ID/IG = 0.978) is lower than that of NW-derived pristine N-HPMC (ID/IG = 0.984) (Fig. S3, ESI†),61 suggesting that the embedding of Co species could promote the graphitization of N-HPMC, consistent with the XRD results.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further performed to gain an insight into the elemental composition and chemical states. The XPS survey spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†) reveal that NW is mainly composed of C, N, and O elements, while the Co/CoOx@NW-HT, Co/CoOx@NW-LT, and Co@N-HPMC samples consist of C, N, and O elements, and the additional Co element, indicating the successful loading of Co species. Fig. 2c presents the high-resolution Co 2p3/2 XPS spectra of the Co-containing samples, revealing that only the Co3O4 phase and metallic Co could be observed in the Co/CoOx@NW-HT and Co/CoOx@NW-LT samples.63 The presence of metallic Co in Co/CoOx@NW-HT is probably due to the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 by lignin in NW under hydrothermal conditions.57 For the Co/CoOx@NW-LT electrode, the Co2+/Co3+ ratio is increased while the Co0 content remains almost unchanged as compared to the Co/CoOx@NW-HT, indicating that the Co3+ could be partially reduced to Co2+ by residual cellulose and hemicellulose during the low temperature carbonization process in air (260 °C) (Table S1, ESI†). Notably, after subsequent carbonization of Co/CoOx@NW-LT at 1000 °C in N2, a new peak attributed to Co–Nx species occurs in the resultant Co@N-HPMC probably through the reaction of Co0 and Co oxides (Co3+) with precarbonized NW (Table S1, ESI†),54,61,63 confirming the formation of a strong electronic interaction between embedded Co NPs and N in the N-HPMC matrix. The loading amount of Co NPs was determined to be 0.32 mg cm−2 by ICP-OES analysis (Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 2d shows the N 1s spectra of the above four samples, where the deconvolution of the N 1s peak of NW, Co/CoOx@NW-HT, and Co/CoOx@NW-LT only exhibits a combination of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N species, while the N 1s spectrum for Co@N-HPMC could be deconvoluted into four peaks. Apart from the presence of pyridinic-N/Co–Nx and pyrrolic-N, two new species corresponding to graphitic-N and oxidized-N are observed, all of which are beneficial for the HER process.63–65
Furthermore, we conducted N2 adsorption–desorption measurement at 77 K to investigate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (SBET) of the Co@N-HPMC electrode (Fig. 2e). The results show that the Co@N-HPMC has an SBET of 249 m2 g−1, numerous mesopores with an average size of ∼4 nm, and a total pore volume of 0.249 cm3 g−1. This indicates that the N-HPMC matrix in the Co@N-HPMC electrode with numerous aligned microchannels and mesopores can provide a large surface area matrix for loading numerous Co NPs and providing an abundant active surface area with high accessibility for diffusion of electrolyte and gas products.57,58 In addition, the electronic conductivity of the electrodes was measured using the temperature-dependent four-probe method (Fig. 2f). Owing to its high graphitization degree, the N-HPMC matrix exhibits an excellent conductivity of 8–9 S cm−1 in the temperature range of 12.5 to 300 K even though it is a monolithic carbon membrane. Even after being loaded with Co NPs, the Co@N-HPMC electrode still shows a high conductivity of 5.1–7.8 S cm−1 in the same temperature range. The high conductivity of the Co@N-HPMC electrode is beneficial for fast electron transportation for electrolysis. It is also noted that the conductivities of both N-HPMC and Co@N-HPMC increase with the test temperature, which is characteristic of semiconductor-like behaviour due to the heteroatom doping (N) for N-HPMC and strong electronic coupling of the embedded Co NPs and N-HPMC matrix.55
The morphology of N-HPMC and Co@N-HPMC electrodes was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It can be seen that the NW-derived N-HMPC matrix has naturally porous and elongated and aligned microchannels along its growth direction (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is in accordance with previous reports.56–58 As to the Co@N-HPMC electrode, the porous and low-tortuosity microstructure of the N-HMPC matrix can be perfectly preserved, indicating that the presence of Co NPs has no significant influence on the microstructure of the N-HPMC matrix during the thermal transformation. Specifically, from the top-view SEM images (Fig. 3a and b), a number of open pores can be observed on its surface, and the diameters of the large and small pores are typically around 25–50 μm and 5–10 μm, respectively. Fig. 3d and e display the side-view SEM images of the Co@N-HPMC electrode (thickness: ∼600 μm). It can be observed that the microchannels are elongated and aligned across the Co@N-HPMC electrode, which will facilitate the electrolyte transport and gas diffusion in electrolysis.56–58 In addition, numerous small pores are found on the walls of the microchannels. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental maps (Fig. 3c and f) of the Co@N-HPMC electrode confirm the uniform dispersion of the Co species not only on the outer surface but also throughout the microchannels of the N-HPMC matrix. Fig. 4a shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the Co@N-HPMC electrode, revealing that Co NPs with a diameter in the range from 50 to 100 nm are firmly embedded within the N-HPMC matrix. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 4b) reveals that Co NPs are coated by a ∼10 nm-thick graphene layer with a layer distance of ∼0.34 nm. The spacing of two lattice fringes on the Co NPs is about 0.215 nm (inset in Fig. 4b), corresponding to the (111) plane of fcc Co.54,61 The well-defined fast Fourier tansformation (FFT) pattern (inset in Fig. 4b) further manifests the polycrystalline nature of the Co@N-HPMC electrode. The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of the Co@N-HPMC electrode and the corresponding EDX elemental maps (Fig. 4c) further demonstrate that the N-HPMC matrix is uniformly doped with N heteroatoms and the Co NPs are firmly embedded within the N-HPMC matrix. The presence of O element is probably due to the surface oxidation of Co NPs since no characteristic diffraction peaks can be observed in the XRD pattern.

The electrocatalytic activity of the Co@N-HPMC electrode for the HER and OER, as well as OWS, was evaluated in 1.0 M KOH solution using a typical three-electrode system. All the polarization curves were obtained by liner sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The measured current is normalized by the geometrical area of electrodes and the potential is referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) after uncompensated resistance correction (see the Experimental section). Fig. 5a shows the HER polarization curve of the Co@N-HPMC electrode, as well as those of commercial Pt foil and N-HPMC for comparison, and the required overpotentials at 10 and 100 mA cm−2 are presented in Fig. 5b. It can be clearly seen that the N-HPMC electrode shows the worst HER activity with an overpotential of 580 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Under the same reaction conditions, the Co@N-HPMC exhibits an enhanced HER activity with a very low onset potential of 39 mV and an overpotential of 128 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, revealing that the embedded Co NPs in N-HPMC are the highly active component for the HER. The Co@N-HPMC electrode has one of the best performances among the recently developed Co-based electrocatalysts and other non-noble-metal HER catalysts in alkaline media (Table S3, ESI†). However, the HER activity of the Co@N-HPMC electrode is still much lower than that of Pt foil, which shows the best HER performance with a low overpotential of 94 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. More importantly, the HER performance of the Co@N-HPMC electrode becomes comparable to or even better than that of Pt foil with increasing applied potential, which could be attributed to the enhanced mass transfer due to the presence of elongated and aligned microchannels. To gain more kinetic insights into the HER on different electrocatalysts, the Tafel plots for various electrodes were generated from their corresponding LSV curves and the Tafel slopes were extracted from the linear region (Fig. 5c). It can be seen that the Pt foil exhibits a Tafel slope of 59.2 mV dec−1, being much closer to the Tafel slope of Heyrovsky reaction (≈40 mV dec−1), suggesting that the HER process may occur through a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the rate-determining step (RDS) is the Heyrovsky reaction.66 The larger Tafel slope of Pt foil at higher current density reveals that the limited active sites present on the surface of the flat Pt foil will greatly restrict its HER activity. The Co@N-HPMC electrode exhibits a Tafel slope of 129.3 mV dec−1, also indicating that the HER follows a Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism, and the Volmer reaction is the RDS. Note that the Tafel slope remains constant from low to high current regimes, suggesting that the Co@N-HPMC electrode possesses an abundance of active sites for the HER.

(d) Results of the long-term stability test of the Co@N-HPMC electrode for the HER. The inset in panel (d) shows the amount of H2 evolved over the Co@N-HPMC electrode as a function of time. 
The N-HPMC electrode without Co NPs exhibits much lower activity for the HER as compared to the Co@N-HPMC electrode, implying that the N dopant in N-HPMC is not the active site that accounts for the observed high HER activity for Co@N-HMPC. However, the high conductivity and large surface area of the N-HPMC matrix might play a beneficial role in the HER. Firstly, even though Co@N-HPMC shows a larger charge transfer resistance than N-HPMC (Fig. 2f and S6, ESI†), the highly conductive N-HPMC will facilitate fast electron transfer. Besides, the embedded metallic Co NPs within the N-HPMC matrix have high dispersion and strongly interact with the N-HPMC matrix by forming Co–O and Co–Nx species, which will lead to abundantly exposed active sites for the HER.63–65 The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) between the electrode and electrolyte was used to estimate the effective surface area of the solid–liquid interface by cyclic voltammetry (CV). We measured the Cdl of the N-HPMC and Co@N-HPMC by integrating the area of their CV curves to compare their electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The Cdl of N-HPMC and Co@N-HPMC is 0.61 and 0.87 mF cm−2, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†), confirming the increased ECSA after the embedding of Co NPs in the N-HPMC matrix.
Furthermore, the long-term HER stability of the Co@N-HPMC electrode at high current density was assessed in 1.0 M KOH solution (Fig. 5d). During the 12 h electrocatalytic HER, the current density at an overpotential of −0.195 V vs. RHE is relatively stable with a slight decrease from 30 to 24 mA cm−2. Online gas chromatography (GC) measurement reveals that the reduction current is derived solely from water reduction, since the Faraday efficiency of the H2 evolution was approximately 100% (inset of Fig. 5d). The morphology and microstructure of the Co@N-HPMC electrode after the HER stability test were also characterized. As shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† apart from the preservation of Co and N species throughout the N-HMPC matrix, the characteristic overall morphology was perfectly retained without significant damage to porosity and microchannels. To further investigate whether the microstructure of the Co@N-HPMC electrode after the HER stability test changes or not, XRD, Raman, and XPS analyses were also performed. From the XRD (Fig. S9a, ESI†) and Raman (Fig. S9b, ESI†) analyses, it can be seen that the Co species is still present within the N-HPMC matrix in metallic form without the formation of the secondary Co phases and the graphitization of the carbon phase does not change significantly, demonstrating that the highly stable N-HPMC matrix effectively prevented the corrosion of the embedded Co NPs. XPS (Fig. S10, ESI†) analysis indicates that both Co and N species still preserve their initial chemical states, demonstrating the high stability against the alkaline solution under the protection of the N-HPMC matrix; however, the ratio of Co3+/Co–Nx species changed slightly after the HER stability test, which may account for the observed slight degradation in HER activity.

Fig. 6a shows the OER polarization curves for the various electrodes in 1.0 M KOH solution. The Co@N-HPMC electrode requires overpotentials of 297 and 415 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b), respectively, which are much lower than those of N-HPMC (441 and 571 mV) and Pt foil (758 and 822 mV). These values are also among the best reported values for Co-based OER electrocatalysts (Table S4, ESI†). In addition, the Co@N-HPMC electrode presents a Tafel slope of 115.7 mV dec−1, comparable to that of Pt foil (104.2 mV dec−1) (Fig. 6c), indicating that the first electron transfer process is the RDS. Furthermore, the Tafel slope for the Co@N-HPMC is much smaller than that of N-HPMC (207.5 mV dec−1), which indicates the favorable OER kinetics for Co@N-HPMC due to the presence of Co NPs.67 This exceptionally high OER activity should be attributed to the unique structure of the Co@N-HPMC electrode, in which the coexistence of exterior Co–O/Co–Nx species on metallic Co can yield efficient active sites and charge separate sites for the OER, while the inner metallic Co core can rapidly transfer the electrons to the N-HPMC matrix,63 thus endowing the Co@N-HPMC electrode with excellent electrocatalytic OER performance. The OER stability of the Co@N-HPMC electrode was also tested at a constant applied potential of 1.65 V with an initial current density of 50 mA cm−2. As indicated in Fig. 6d, the current density for the OER on the Co@N-HPMC electrode gradually decreases with reaction time and 64% of its original activity is retained after a 3 h electrolysis reaction. The Faraday efficiency of the O2 evolution was measured to be approximately 78% over a 3 h reaction (inset of Fig. 6d), suggesting that the oxidation of the N-HMPC matrix is inevitable during the OER process.68,69 After the OER stability test, the Co@N-HPMC electrode was subjected to various characterization studies. From the SEM images (Fig. S11, ESI†), a number of cracks (∼5 μm) across the microchannels and the surface of the N-HPMC matrix could be clearly observed most likely due to the oxidation of the N-HPMC matrix during the OER, which will significantly retard the electron transfer between Co NPs and the N-HPMC matrix (Fig. S12, ESI†), thereby reducing the OER activity and stability. In addition to the macrostructural degradation, XRD (Fig. S13a, ESI†) and Raman analyses (Fig. S13b, ESI†) also indicate that the characteristic diffraction peaks ascribed to Co0 reduce obviously, while the ratio of ID/IG is increased to 1.020 for the Co@N-HPMC after the OER stability test. Moreover, XPS analysis (Fig. S14, ESI†) reveals that the Co0 can be partially oxidized to Co3+/Co2+ species and the ratio of surface Co–Nx significantly reduces due to the oxidation of N species for the Co@N-HPMC electrode after the OER stability test (Table S1, ESI†). These results suggest that the microstructure of the Co@N-HPMC electrode is significantly destroyed during the OER stability test, that is, both the embedded Co NPs and N-HPMC matrix are oxidized, which will lead to increased electron transfer resistance and thus reaction barriers for the OER.

The above results clearly reveal that the Co@N-HPMC electrode can be used as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER, which is further confirmed by polarizing this electrode in a wide potential range from −0.7 to 2.0 V in 1.0 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 7a, the potential difference (ΔE) needed to reach a current density of 50 mA cm−2 is 1.95 V vs. RHE after iR compensation (the ΔE is 2.16 V vs. RHE without iR compensation). Accordingly, an electrolyzer was assembled by pairing two Co@N-HPMC electrodes in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 7b). The cell voltages required to achieve current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2 are 1.77 (corresponding to an overpotential of 540 mV for OWS) and 2.16 V, respectively. Phenomenally, both H2 and O2 vigorously evolve on the electrode surface (Fig. 7c).This result is better than or at least comparable to previously reported results for bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting (Table S5, ESI†). Also, the durability of the assembled electrolyzer was tested at a cell voltage of 1.97 V with an initial OWS current density of 25 mA cm−2. As observed in Fig. 7d, the activity of OWS obviously decreases (38%) after a 4 h electrolysis. Since the Co@N-HPMC electrode is not stable towards the OER, the instability of the electrolyser is mainly due to the degradation of the Co@N-HPMC electrode when serving as an anode.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient monolithic electrocatalyst based on a wood-derived N-doped hierarchically porous monolithic carbon (N-HPMC) matrix with embedded Co NPs (Co@N-HPMC) for electrocatalytic water splitting reactions in alkaline solution. The open, porous, and low-tortuosity microchannels within the 3D monolithic N-HPMC matrix endow the Co@N-HPMC electrode with enhanced diffusion kinetics and mass transport for the electrolyte and produced gas. Meanwhile, the highly dispersed Co NPs are firmly embedded in situ within the N-HPMC matrix with the formation of Co–O and Co–Nx species, providing numerous active sites for both the HER and OER. As a result, the Co@N-HPMC electrode requires a lower overpotential of 128 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and displays considerable stability for the HER. In addition, when used as an OER electrocatalyst, the Co@N-HPMC electrode needs an overpotential of 297 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. More importantly, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by using the Co@N-HPMC electrode as both the cathode and anode requires cell voltages of 1.77 and 2.16 V to drive an OWS reaction at current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm−2, respectively. The strategy proposed here is highly promising for the design and fabrication of highly active TM-based monolithic electrocatalysts as alternatives to powdery electrocatalysts for large-scale industrial application.
