    , Accepted 11th November 2022First published on 25th November 2022AbstractRecently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have been considered as the new generation of photovoltaic devices due to their excellent performance. However, their finite interfacial stability limits their further commercialization. How to improve their stability is one of the important issues in current scientific research. Herein, a bilayered titanium dioxide nanorod array-flower (B-TiO2-NAF) was prepared as an electron transport material for hybrid perovskite solar cells in order to overcome this difficulty. A device based on B-TiO2-NAF exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.8% due to its low electron trap density (ntrap), low carrier recombination resistance (Rs), facilitated electron injection, and reduced nonradiative recombination rate. The application of B-TiO2-NAF provides a stable three-dimensional (3-D) D/A interface and shortens the internal photoexciton diffusion distance. As a result, the device shows excellent long-term stability, which is maintained at over 83% of the initial efficiency after 30 days. Our work should be beneficial for the preparation of 3-D semiconductor materials and provides new insights into highly stable perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
With the development of the global economy, the demand for energy in human society has increased dramatically while non-renewable resources dominated by fossil and mineral energy (from coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) are gradually failing to meet this demand. Solar cells have received extensive attention because of their high efficiency, and green and environmental protection properties.1 Based on this, a new generation of solar cells, represented by organic photovoltaic devices2–5 and perovskite solar cells,6–8 has been gradually studied in depth. In particular, the research of highly efficient perovskite solar cells has brought rapid development in the field of solar cells.9–11 The efficiency of perovskite solar cells has increased from an initial 3.8%12 to now surpass 25%.13–15
At present, the theoretical efficiency of perovskite solar cells has met the requirements of commercialization, but they still cannot be completely commercialized. The main reason is that the stability of perovskite solar cells is insufficient, and devices are greatly affected by the environment.16–18 Temperature changes, oxygen content, relative humidity and other related factors will affect the performance of solar cells. In fact, the stability of the interface between the donor and the acceptor (D/A interface) for perovskite solar cells is the main factor.19–21 Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, due to their own particularities, such as poor thermal stability,22 high surface energy,23–25 and easy decomposition and deliquescence,26 feature a large-scale D/A interface micro region inside the active layer. Thus, the interface state is usually metastable.27–29 How to effectively regulate the D/A interface and construct a regulation mechanism for interfacial stabilization has become an important challenge for the research of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells.
Yang's research group has studied the external influencing factors of perovskite materials in the process of film formation and crystallization, and found that the performance of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3−xClx grown in an environment with a relative humidity of 30% was the best. The use of yttrium-modified TiO2 as an acceptor material can speed up the carrier transmission process and reduce energy loss.17 However, perovskite crystals were susceptible to moisture decomposition in humid air and under long-term lighting conditions, and the morphology of the film was seriously affected by thermodynamic factors. The microphase separation structure between perovskite and acceptor materials was usually in a metastable state rather than final equilibrium state. Michael Grätzel found that the decomposition rate of perovskite films increased with an increase of annealing temperature. When the temperature exceeded 200 °C, there were two phases of complete perovskite and PbI2. In this state, the micro-scale of the active layer interface increased, and the area of the D/A interface decreased. Finally, the micro-scale exceeded the exciton diffusion length, leading to a situation where some excitons could not reach the D/A interface smoothly.30 Therefore, the unstable interface of the photoactive layer is an important factor for the reduction of the lifetime of perovskite solar cells.
At present, the electron transport material of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells is mainly a two-dimensional planar structure with mesoporous titanium dioxide (m-TiO2) as the electron transport layer.31–33 Based on this structure, the D/A interface of the active layer is usually a two-dimensional planar structure, and the thermodynamic properties are usually unstable. The expansion of the interface micro-area will seriously reduce the effective D/A interface area within the unit active layer. Thus, the dissociation and transmission of carriers are limited to a great extent. To mitigate this weakness, herein, we prepared a bilayered titanium dioxide nanorod array-flower (B-TiO2-NAF) material to construct a three-dimensional (3-D) D/A interface for carrier transport in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. Through the construction of a 3-D interface, the stability of the device is effectively improved, and the carrier transport is greatly enhanced. This work is expected to provide a new theoretical basis for the preparation of highly stable perovskite solar cells.
Experimental section/methods
Materials and methods
All chemical reagents and materials were commercial grade. UV/visible absorption spectra were recorded using an Agilent Cary 300. A fluorescence instrument FLS980 was used to detect the quenching response of the fluorescence spectrum. X-ray diffraction measurements were performed to detect the crystal structure of the samples (D/MAX 2500, Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5405 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements (Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements (HITACHI S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope) were performed to characterize the morphology of the samples. XPS measurements were performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements were performed to evaluate the lifetime of the samples (FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer, excitation 560 nm). The decay curves obeyed a double exponential function fitting with χ2 in a region of 0.9–1.1. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were recorded using a Thermo Fischer ESCALAB 250Xi.
Preparation of B-TiO2-NAF/FTO
B-TiO2-NAF was prepared as follows: hydrochloric acid and deionized water were mixed in a volume ratio of 1:1.2 to form a 60 mL homogeneous solution, and then 1.2 ml of isopropyl titanate and 10 mg of NaCl were added with stirring for 25 minutes. The solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined hydrothermal reaction vessel where FTO glass was embedded and reacted at 200 °C for 90 min. After the reaction, a white film was obtained on the FTO glass and washed with deionized water 3 times to obtain a B-TiO2-NAF/FTO thin film. The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of B-TiO2-NAF/FTO is shown in Fig. 1a. For comparison, an m-TiO2/FTO film was also prepared using a typical method.34

Device fabrication and characterization
The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was synthesized using a one-step method detailed in the literature.35 To prepare the device, 0.2 mL of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was spin-coated onto the B-TiO2-NAF/FTO thin film at 2500 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to form a perovskite active layer. After that, a chlorobenzene solution containing 68 mM spiro-MeOTAD, 55 mM tert-butylpyridine, and 9 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide salt was spin-coated at a rate of 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 200 nm Au layer was deposited onto the surface to complete the solar cells (0.12 cm2). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a solar simulator (Newport Sol 2A ORIEL, AM 1.5 G spectrum) under 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices were measured using a Qtest station 500 (USA). The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring the current at the maximum power point, and the photo-current value was recorded.
Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of B-TiO2-NAF/FTO is shown in Fig. 1a. The as-synthesized B-TiO2-NAF/FTO is a white transparent film. As shown in the SEM image (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†), B-TiO2-NAF has a bilayered nanorod array-flower structure (Fig. S2, ESI†), where the length of the nanorods is about 400–500 nm with a diameter of 50–80 nm. Fig. 1c shows the XRD pattern of B-TiO2-NAF. B-TiO2-NAF reflected the (112), (101), (211), and (002) diffraction peaks, in good agreement with rutile TiO2 (JCPDS Card #21-1276).36 The TEM and HRTEM measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicated that B-TiO2-NAF crystals grew perpendicular to the (101) crystal plane. The absorption spectrum of B-TiO2-NAF exhibited maximum absorbance at a wavelength of 310 nm, which is attributed to the Ti(3d)–O(2p) transition of TiO2.37
To clearly understand the growth process of B-TiO2-NAF, we recorded SEM images during different growth periods. When the growth time was 20 min, a small number of TiO2 nanorods just emerged from the FTO surface to form an array prototype (Fig. 2a). As the growth time continued to 60 min, a stable TiO2 array was formed (Fig. 2b). Note that, during the formation process of the array, the nanorods began to cluster together to form new platforms, which would provide sufficient sites for the formation of nanoflowers. With an extension of time to 90 min, new nanorods continued to grow on these platforms and formed stable B-TiO2-NAF nanostructures (Fig. 2c). The entire schematic diagram of the growth mechanism is shown in Fig. 2d.

In order to understand the energy band gap (Eg) of B-TiO2-NAF, we measured the direct spectral band gap (Fig. 2e), by which the Eg value was calculated to be 3.13 eV. The onset of the UPS spectrum (Fig. 2f) was used to determine the distance between the Fermi level (Ef) and the valence band (EVB), where the Ef − EVB value was estimated to be 2.45 eV. The Fermi level can be determined by the D-value between the cutoff edge of the UPS spectrum and 21.22 eV, by which the Ef value was calculated to be −4.75 eV. Therefore, the conductive band level (ECB) and EVB values of B-TiO2-NAF were calculated to be −4.07 eV and −7.2 eV, respectively.
To test the defect density, electron-only devices were prepared (Fig. 3a and b). The J–V curves were measured under dark conditions with the bias voltage in the region from 0 to 3 V. The trap filling limit voltage (VTFL) was the voltage at the turning point of the ohmic response (linear section) and trap-filling process (exponential increase). The electron trap density (ntrap) was calculated using eqn (1):38 (1)where L is the thickness of the CH3NH3PbI3-based crystal layer, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, and ε is the relative dielectric constant of the CH3NH3PbI3 material. The VTFL values for the m-TiO2 and B-TiO2-NAF-based devices were 0.56 and 0.38 V, respectively. VTFL was proportional to ntrap, as other factors remained unchanged. Consequently, ntrap in the B-TiO2-NAF-based device was lower than that based on m-TiO2. The electrical properties of B-TiO2-NAF were evaluated by vertical current–voltage measurements with the architectures of Au/B-TiO2-NAF/FTO and Au/m-TiO2/FTO (Fig. 3c). Compared with m-TiO2, devices based on B-TiO2-NAF showed a higher current, which means better conductivity. To detect the carrier recombination resistance (Rs), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed (Fig. 3d). In the low-frequency region, the B-TiO2-NAF-based device exhibited a smaller semicircle than that for m-TiO2, indicating a lower Rs and a decreased carrier recombination rate than its m-TiO2 counterpart.

The PL properties of the CH3NH3PbI3 film on B-TiO2-NAF/FTO and m-TiO2/FTO thin films were recorded to confirm the charge transfer process (Fig. 4a). In steady-state PL spectra, CH3NH3PbI3 exhibited a broad emission band (EB) with a maximum at 775 nm. The emission of CH3NH3PbI3 was significantly quenched for the thin film on m-TiO2, indicating an effective charge transfer process occurring between the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and m-TiO2. The PL quenching of CH3NH3PbI3 was further increased by its coming into contact with the B-TiO2-NAF/FTO film, implying a more convenient charge transfer behaviour at the interface between CH3NH3PbI3 and the B-TiO2-NAF/FTO film. To confirm this, the TR-PL spectra of the thin films were recorded (Fig. 4b and Fig. S4, ESI†). The photoluminescence lifetime of CH3NH3PbI3 in the CH3NH3PbI3/m-TiO2/FTO thin film was 5.2 ns, which was reduced to 3.4 ns by coming into contact with the B-TiO2-NAF/FTO thin film, indicating a facilitated electron injection efficiency at the interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals and B-TiO2-NAF.

To study the photovoltaic performance of B-TiO2-NAF, solar cells with a structure of FTO/B-TiO2-NAF/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au (Fig. 4c) were prepared. The m-TiO2-based device showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.8 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.81 and a PCE of 20.5%. For comparison, the device based on B-TiO2-NAF showed improved photovoltaic performance with a Voc of 1.11 V, a Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.82 and a consequent PCE of 21.8%. We noted that the increase in the PCE for the device was mainly due to the increase in Jsc and Voc, so it was quite necessary to further explore the changes in Jsc and Voc. Thus, the EQE spectra and the integrated Jsc of the B-TiO2-NAF- and m-TiO2-based solar cells were tested (Fig. 4d) to investigate the current intensity. Compared with the m-TiO2-based device, the EQE value of the B-TiO2-NAF-based device was increased over the whole region. The highest EQE and integrated Jsc of the B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cell were 93% and 22.9 mA cm−2, respectively, much higher than those of the m-TiO2-based solar cell (89% and 21.8 mA cm−2), which indicated that B-TiO2-NAF can more effectively promote the generation of a photo-current.

V
oc was another important factor that restricted the device performance. Under the conditions of fixed energy level matching, the voltage was determined by nonradiative recombination.39 Generally speaking, a suppressed charge recombination loss would lead to an increased Voc. The light intensity-dependent Voc measurement is an important method to test nonradiative recombination (Fig. 5a). The diode ideal factor (n) was calculated using eqn (2).39 (2)where T, K, q and I represent the temperature, Boltzmann constant, elemental charge, and light intensity, respectively. The value of the linear slope inversely reflected the nonradiative recombination.34,40 The linear slope in the B-TiO2-NAF-based device was much lower than its m-TiO2 counterpart, indicating the suppressed trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells.

The steady-state PCE and photo-current output at the maximum power point were recorded to confirm the efficiency of champion devices (Fig. 5b and c). Compared with the m-TiO2-based device, the B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells showed an improved PCE and photo-current output that matched well with the J–V curves. In addition, we recorded the statistics of 20 devices for each to investigate the device performance (Fig. 5d, Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). Through the statistics, the B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells showed an average Jsc of 23.1 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 21.2%, much higher than those of the m-TiO2-based devices (22.0 mA cm−2 and 19.4%). The statistics data demonstrated the excellent reproducibility of the devices based on B-TiO2-NAF.
The energy level diagram of the B-TiO2-NAF-based device is shown in Fig. 6a and the corresponding carrier transport process was analyzed (Fig. 6b). A conductive band of −4.07 eV and a valence band of −7.2 eV for B-TiO2-NAF were adopted from UPS results. For other energy levels of materials, we referred to previous work.37 For the m-TiO2-based solar cell, the carrier transport channel was just on a two-dimensional plane, which resulted in carriers far from the D/A interface needing to undergo a relatively long diffusion path to reach the interface, meaning carriers were vulnerable to external factors such as trap capture and nonradiative recombination during the diffusion process, resulting in partial energy consumption. Differently, B-TiO2-NAF provided a stable 3-D interface for carrier transport. Carriers can effectively diffuse to the D/A interface for charge separation, which increased the internal charge transfer efficiency and reduced the energy loss. In order to understand that intuitively, we provided a cross-sectional SEM image of the CH3NH3PbI3/B-TiO2-NAF/FTO thin film. Obviously, based on the structural characteristics of B-TiO2-NAF, the thin film presented a local bilayered structure (Fig. 6c). Finally, the air stability of the m-TiO2- and B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells was evaluated (Fig. 6d). The device based on B-TiO2-NAF showed better stability than its m-TiO2 counterpart, maintaining over 83% of its initial efficiency after 30 days, whereas the counterpart based on m-TiO2 suffered a much faster degradation and maintained only 77% of its original efficiency. The above results demonstrated that B-TiO2-NAF with a 3-D interface can efficiently improve the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel kind of 3-D B-TiO2-NAF material was prepared. Perovskite solar cells based on B-TiO2-NAF resulted in a top PCE of 21.8%. The PL and TR-PL results demonstrated the facilitated electron injection at the 3-D interface between the perovskite layer and B-TiO2-NAF. The EQE measurement of the B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cell showed an improved integrated photo-current conversion efficiency than its m-TiO2 counterpart. Light intensity-dependent Voc measurements indicated a suppressed trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells. The dark J–V characteristics of the electron-only devices indicated that there was lower ntrap in the B-TiO2-NAF-based device. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a lower Rs and a decreased carrier recombination rate for the B-TiO2-NAF-based device. In addition, the internal carrier transport behaviour was analyzed. Moreover, the B-TiO2-NAF-based solar cells showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining over 83% of their initial efficiency after 30 days. These results would be beneficial to the preparation of 3-D semiconductor material-based highly stable perovskite solar cells.
