    , Accepted 18th December 2017First published on 18th December 2017AbstractAlthough substantial efforts have been made toward the synthesis of noble metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures, direct in situ synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) core–shell semiconductor@noble metal heterostructured nanosheets remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel 2D core–shell CuFeSe2@Au heterostructured nanosheet with an amorphous core and a crystalline shell based on the reversed growth of Au nanosheets on the CuFeSe2 frameworks under near-infrared (NIR) illumination. The nanosheet exhibits strong absorbance in the NIR region, and the valence band top of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is higher than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. Owing to the unique structural features, the resulting nanosheets show excellent photocatalytic activity and high stability toward water oxidation with an O2 generation rate up to 3.48 mmol h−1 g−1 compared to those of the constituent materials under NIR light irradiation (λ > 850 nm). This work brings new opportunities to prepare 2D core–shell semiconductor@noble metal heterostructured nanosheets, which can be applied as photocatalysts toward water splitting and solar energy conversion at long wavelengths.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metal–semiconductor nanoheterostructures with desirable chemical compositions and/or morphologies have attracted a great deal of research interest, as they show promising technical applications in photocatalysis,1 biomedicine,2 storage,3 energy conversion,4 and nanodevices.5 Integrating the metallic and semiconducting domains to form nanoheterostructures may not only lead to the combined properties from the different components but also further enhance new synergistic properties, which come from the interactions between the semiconductor and metal components.6–8 In such unique classes of heterostructured materials, the low Fermi levels of metal nanoparticles serve as a reservoir of photoelectrons to improve the lifetime of photogenerated carriers. Thereby, the overall photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst can be improved.
Many studies have recently suggested that in addition to the properties of the compounds and their interface between the two phases, crystal planes9,10 and dimensions11,12 also play an important role in determining their basic properties. In particular, two-dimensional nanomaterials with nanometer thickness can expose a specific crystal surface to the maximum extent, thus showing further enhanced catalytic properties. In addition to graphene and related nanomaterials,13–15 a large number of studies have focused on preparing free-standing 2D materials with intrinsically layered crystal structures, including metal oxides,16–19 metal chalcogenides,20–23 as well as Pd,24,25 Au,26,27 Ag,28,29 and other noble metal nanosheets. However, the development of scalable approaches to fabricate 2D core–shell semiconductor@metal heterostructured nanosheets is still far less demonstrated.
In this article, for the first time, we report a novel type of core–shell CuFeSe2@Au heterostructured nanosheets based on the reversed crystal growth of Au nanosheets on the CuFeSe2 frameworks under near-infrared (NIR) illumination. Au was selected due to its potential for plasmonic enhancement. In addition, the surface plasmon of Au coupled with a semiconductor exciton enhances the excited state lifetime of the photoelectron.30–39 Here we show that CuFeSe2 frameworks are critical for forming well-defined CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets. The resulting nanosheets show a sheet-like structure with a thickness of ∼50 nm. Our studies showed that the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets show high catalytic activity and high stability toward NIR light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and characterization
Iron(III) acetylacetonate (99.9%), copper(II) acetylacetonate, oleylamine (70%), diphenyl ether, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and diphenyl diselenide (98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. HAuCl4·4H2O (Au > 47.8%) was purchased from Beijing HWRK Chem CO., Ltd. Purified water (18.2 MΩ cm) for the preparation of solutions was obtained from a Molecular Lab Water Purifier.
The morphology of the samples was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI, Sirion 200). TEM measurements were carried out with a JEM-2100 (200 kV) instrument under ambient conditions through the deposition of ethanol dispersions of the nanomaterials on amorphous carbon-coated copper grids. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the particles were recorded using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation (l = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI-5702 multifunctional spectrometer with AlKα radiation. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photocatalysis was performed using a xenon lamp (HSX-F/UV 300), equipped with 400–800 nm and 800–1500 nm filters. FT-IR characterization was carried out on a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer. Fluorescence microscopy images were viewed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DR) equipped with a digital camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu). The magnetic hysteresis loops were measured using a Bruker DRX-400 MHz high sensitivity vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) with fields up to 1.5 tesla at room temperature. The metal concentration of the nanoparticles was quantified using inductively coupled plasma absorption emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was conducted on an Agilent 5500.
2.2 Material synthesis

2.2.1 Synthesis of CuFeSe2 NCs. 
Fe(acac)3 (2 mmol), Cu(acac)2 (1 mmol), oleylamine (15 mL) and diphenyl ether (15 mL) were mixed and magnetically stirred under a flow of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was dehydrated at 110 °C for 1.5 h under a blanket of N2, then heated to 265 °C, and aged at this temperature for 1 h. Then 1 mmol of diphenyl diselenide dispersed in 1 mL of oleylamine was injected in the above reaction system immediately. After 60 min, CuFeSe2 NCs were obtained. After the reaction, the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Then CuFeSe2 NCs were precipitated upon the addition of 50 mL of ethanol and centrifuging. In order to remove the excess oleylamine on the surface of NCs, the NCs were washed with petroleum ether and ethanol mixed solution. Finally, the product was dispersed in chloroform.


2.2.2 Synthesis of triethylenetetramine-3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DIB-TETA). 
108 μL triethylenetetramine was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL). 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde (200 mg, 1.44 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL), and then this was added dropwise to the above solution. After that the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 25 °C. The solvent was evaporated to half under reduced pressure and centrifuged. The product was then dried under vacuum at 25 °C.


2.2.3 Synthesis of CuFeSe2 frameworks. 
15 mg triethylenetetramine-3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was dissolved in DMSO (10 mL). 0.01 g of each specific structured CuFeSe2 NCs was added into 10 mL of CHCl3, and then this was added into the above solution. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The product was centrifuged and washed with petroleum ether and ethanol (2:1 v/v), and then dispersed in ethanol.


2.2.4 Photo-induced synthesis of hybrid core–shell structured CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets. 
0.55 mL triethylenetetramine-3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde–CuFeSe2 solution was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL). HAuCl4·4H2O (124 mg 0.03 mmoL) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL), and then this was added into the above solution. The mixture was irradiated with the Xe lamp for 2 h. The reaction temperature was set at 20 °C and controlled by using a circulating water bath. The nanosheets were obtained after the final solution was centrifuged and washed with ethanol three times and then redispersed in ethanol.

2.3 Photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets
Typical photocatalytic water oxidation performed under our laboratory conditions is as follows. 10 mg catalyst was added to the solution containing 0.1 M Na2S2O8, 1.0 M NaOH and 10 mL ultrapure water. The mixed solution was agitated and deaerated by purging with N2 gas for 30 min in a flask (28 mL) sealed with a rubber septum (the volume of the reaction solution was 10 mL) at the same time. The reaction was then started by irradiating the solution with a Xe lamp power source through a transmitting glass filter at ambient temperature (by using a connected reflux water condenser). The intensity of light is 100 mW measured by using a power meter (Model 843-R, Newport). After exposure to light corresponding to several times, 250 μL of N2 was injected into the flask and then the same volume of gas in the headspace of the flask was withdrawn using a SGE gas-tight syringe and analysed by gas chromatography (GC). The O2 in the sampled gas was separated by passing through a 2 m × 3 mm packed molecular sieves 5 Å column with an N2 carrier gas and quantified using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Shimadzu GC-2014C). The total quantity of produced O2 was calculated on the basis of the concentration of O2 in the headspace gas. Contamination of the headspace with air was calibrated by measuring N2 present in the headspace through measuring the N2 peak in the GC traces.
2.4 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement
A 300 W Xe arc lamp was used as the light source for the photocatalytic reaction. The measurement of AQE was performed using same amount of reactants. We fixed the wavelengths at 450 ± 10, 500 ± 10, 550 ± 10, 600 ± 10, 650 ± 10, 700 ± 10, 800 ± 10 and 900 ± 10 nm for irradiation. The laser power in the photocatalytic reaction was collected using a power meter (Newport; 843-R). The corresponding wavelengths captured for AQE calculation are located at 450 ± 10 nm. Thus, the AQE was calculated using the following equation, AQE = 4n/np × 100%, in which n and np were denoted as the number of photons that the generating product needed and the number of incident photons, respectively. The AQE for the catalysts under light irradiation at the other wavelengths was also calculated with the same method.
2.5 The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) calculation
Within 40 min of visible light irradiation (450 ± 10 nm) of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets, the average intensity of irradiation was found to be 0.041 W and 0.014 W by using a power meter (Newport; 843-R) before and after the catalyst was added to the reaction flask. The total absorbed light energy ΔE = (0.041 − 0.014) × 40 × 60 = 64.8 J, n = 2.34 × 10−3 mmol, energy per photon E0 = hc/λ = 6.63 × 10−34 × 3 × 108/(450 × 10−9) = 4.42 × 10−19 J, moles of photons np = ΔE/(E0 × NA) = 64.8/(4.42 × 10−19 × 6.02 × 1023) = 0.244 mmol, and AQE (initial) = 4n/np = 4 × 2.34 × 10−3/0.244 × 100% = 3.8%. With the same method, we can calculate the initial AQE for other light irradiation, the AQE (initial) were 2.8%, 3.0%, 3.4%, 1.3%, 0.1%, 5.9% and 7.9%, respectively.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurement
Photoelectrochemical properties were investigated on an electrochemical station (CHI 760E) in a standard three-electrode, single-compartment quartz cell. The CuFeSe2 electrode and the CuFeSe2@Au electrode with an active area of 2 cm2 served as the working electrodes. The counter electrode and reference electrode consisted of a platinum sheet (99.99%, 0.1 mm, 1 cm × 2 cm) and Ag/AgCl, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp with an ultraviolet filter (λ > 850 nm) was used as the near-infrared (NIR) source and was positioned 10 cm away from the photoelectrochemical cell. Impedance measurements were performed under NIR light illumination (λ > 850 nm filter, 300 W Xe lamp) in a 0.5 mol L−1 Na2S solution at open circuit voltage over a frequency range from 105 to 10−1 Hz with an AC voltage at 5 mV. The Mott–Schottky plots were obtained at a fixed frequency of 1 kHz to determine the flat-band potential and carrier density. The transient photocurrent was measured using a 20 s on–off cycle at a bias voltage of 0.7 V.
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis procedure involves three steps. Firstly, highly monodisperse CuFeSe2 NCs were prepared by the reaction of iron(III) acetylacetonate, and copper(II) acetylacetonate with diphenyl diselenide in the presence of oleylamine (OLA) and diphenyl ether. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the CuFeSe2 NCs present a monodisperse and uniform spherical shape with ∼6.0 nm size (Fig. 1A and S1†). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1B) show that the NCs are well crystallized, and the resolved interplanar distance of 0.272 nm could be indexed as the (200) and (020) planes of the tetragonal-phase CuFeSe2.40 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 1C) showed that all the diffraction peaks coincide well with the standard data of the tetragonal phase CuFeSe2 in the eskebornite form (JCPDS file number 81-1959). The molar ratio of copper:iron:selenium was calculated to be 1.07:1:1.83 by using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S2†). Such a molar ratio is consistent with the results (the atomic ratio of Cu:Fe:Se = (1:0.95:1.98) determined from the elemental analysis (Table S1†) by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)). Further confirmation of the element oxidation states was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S3†).

To prepare CuFeSe2 frameworks, 10 mg CuFeSe2 NCs in 10 mL chloroform was added into 10 mL of DMSO containing 15 mg triethylenetetramine-3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and stirred overnight at room temperature for 24 h. XRD patterns of the assembled CuFeSe2 frameworks matched well with those of the standard CuFeSe2 (JCPDS 81-1959, Fig. 1C), and the TEM image indicates that the CuFeSe2 frameworks exhibited a microporous structure of the NC matrix, which cross-linked with each other to form mesopores with different pore sizes (Fig. 1D). These features were not found in CuFeSe2 NCs (Fig. 1A). Further confirmation of the formation of CuFeSe2 frameworks was monitored by XPS (Fig. S4 and S5†) and the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S6†).
CuFeSe2 frameworks and HAuCl4·4H2O were used as precursors for the preparation of heterostructured CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets under NIR-light (λ > 850 nm) irradiation. A representative TEM image of the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets confirms the sheet-like morphology (Fig. 2A and S7†). HRTEM analysis shows lattice fringes of 0.242 nm (Fig. 2B), corresponding to the (111) planes of fcc Au. The HRTEM images of Au show the lattice fringes across the whole nanosheet. From the element mappings of Cu, Fe, Se, and Au in the aggregated CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets (Fig. 2C and D), Au is observed to be rich on the outside of the nanosheets and four elements are presented in the entire testing area, indicating that CuFeSe2 NCs are homogeneously distributed between the 2D Au nanosheets. In addition, the EDX spectra also show the existence of Cu, Fe, Se, and Au elements in the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets (Fig. S8†). After the nanosheet is cut along the longitudinal direction, the cross section shows that the nanoparticles are embedded between the nanosheets, and the thickness of the Au shell is about 10 nm (Fig. 3A). The HRTEM images (inset of Fig. 3A) show both the resolved interplanar distances (about 0.272 nm) of CuFeSe2 and resolved interplanar distances (about 0.242 nm) of Au, and the Cu, Fe, Se, and Au elements are clearly shown in Fig. S9.† A typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) image shows that the average thickness of the formed nanosheet is determined to be 52 nm (Fig. S10†). SEM images in Fig. 3B and S11† clearly showed randomly oriented 2D nanosheets with ∼50 nm thickness. The molar ratios of Cu:Fe:Se:Au in the as-prepared CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets are 1:0.99:1.98:8.53 as determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Table S2†).

The successful formation of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets was further confirmed by XPS (Fig. 4A–D and S12†) and the FT-IR spectrum (Fig. S13†). The XPS survey spectrum identifies the existence of Fe, Cu, Se, C, N, O and Au (Fig. 4A). Two peaks located at 931.99 and 953.39 eV with a binding energy splitting of 21.40 eV in Cu 2p XPS spectra indicate the presence of Cu+ (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the measurement confirms the existence of some Cu2+ since the shake-up structure of copper(II) is observed in the spectra. The binding energies at 711.22 eV and 722.53 eV are in agreement with the reported Fe3+ spectrum (Fig. 4C). The binding energies of Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 for CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets can be identified at 84.37 and 88.05 eV, which indicates the presence of Au0 (Fig. 4D).41 The peak at 531.68 eV is assigned to be O 1s (Fig. S12A†). The peak at 398.84 eV related to N 1s is shown in Fig. S12B.† The selenium peak is confirmed at 55.74 eV (Fig. S12C†). Moreover, the upshift of the N 1s from 398.34 eV for CuFeSe2-frameworks to 398.84 eV for CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is due to the coordination of N atoms with Au (Fig. 4E).42 Similarly, as seen in Fig. 4F, the upshift of the Se 3d increases from 55.21 eV for the CuFeSe2 frameworks to 55.74 eV for the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets and also suggest Se element coordination onto the Au nanosheets. As shown in Fig. S13,† the blue-shift of the CN vibrations from 1657 cm−1 for the CuFeSe2-frameworks to 1647 cm−1 for the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is attributed to the coordination between the Au0 and CN groups of CuFeSe2 frameworks.43 Similarly, the red-shift of the N–H groups increases from 3409 cm−1 for the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets to 3420 cm−1 for the CuFeSe2 frameworks suggesting the coordination of the Au element onto the N–H groups of the CuFeSe2-frameworks.44 Meanwhile, the peak at 414 nm is assigned to the group of Au–N.45

To further investigate the growth mechanism of the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets, time-dependent growth of the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is monitored by SEM (Fig. 5). In the early reaction stage, the formed nanostructures are mainly spherical (Fig. 5A). When the reaction time was further increased from 30 min, the quantity of spherical particles decreased and the quantity of nanosheets increased as observed from the SEM images (Fig. 5B–D). Fig. 6 shows the successive XRD patterns obtained from the samples collected at different time intervals during the synthesis of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 6, the samples obtained after 0.5 h had all peaks including CuFeSe2 and Au. With the progressing time, the intensity of the CuFeSe2 peak gradually decreased, and that of Au increased. These results indicate that CuFeSe2 NCs are encapsulated by the Au nanosheets. The effect of the amount of HAuCl4·4H2O on the formation of Au nanosheets was also investigated. As shown in Fig. S14,† only when the amount of HAuCl4·4H2O is up to 0.03 mmol, sandwich-like nanosheets were formed. We also found that no nanosheets were formed in the dark under identical conditions (Fig. S15B†). In addition, the use of CuFeSe2 NCs alone did not generate nanosheets under NIR light irradiation (Fig. S15C†).

Based on the above experimental results, we propose the reversed growth mechanism, which is similar to the case in analcime,46,47 to elucidate the formation of the core–shell CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets (Scheme 1). Under NIR-light irradiation, electron and hole pairs can be generated within the CuFeSe2 frameworks. The photo-excited electrons facilitate the reduction of AuCl4− ions to Au0, and Au is first nucleated on the surface of the CuFeSe2 framework owing to the numerous functional groups of the CuFeSe2 frameworks, which could coordinate with Au-NH (Fig. 4E and S12†), Au–NC (Fig. S12†), and Au–Se groups (Fig. 4F). When the Au nucleation occurs, the new Au nanostructures can deposit, fuse together, and self-adjust until the entire surface corresponds to the (111) planes of fcc Au, thereby forming core–shell CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets.

The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) displayed that the resulting CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets exhibit two absorbance bands (Fig. 7A). A broad band in the range of 780–1700 nm comes from CuFeSe2 NCs, whereas, a new absorption band centered at 550 nm corresponds to the localized surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanosheets. We estimated conduction, valence band edges, and Eg values of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets according to the Tauc plots (Fig. 7B) and the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. 7C) test.48 The optical band gap of the as-prepared CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is estimated to be around 0.70 eV.49 According to the UPS test, the EVB = hυ + Ecutoff − Ef = (21.20 + 5.02 − 20.15) eV = 6.07 eV, then ECB = EVB − Eg = (6.07 − 0.70) eV = 5.37 eV.

Fig. 7D further shows that the valence band top of the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is higher than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O, thus proving the potential of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets as a photocatalyst for water oxidation.
The photocatalytic water oxidation reaction, with the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets as a catalyst, was performed in the presence of Na2S2O8 as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The oxidation reaction was carried out in a nearly neutral solution (NaOH–Na2S2O8 buffer with a pH value of 8.8) under NIR-light (λ > 850 nm) and visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Surprisingly, the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet catalyst resulted in the highest O2 evolution rate (3.48 mmol h−1 g−1), leading to 3.15-, 2.85-, 2.02-, and 1.37-fold improvements compared to that of the CuFeSe2 (1.10 mmol h−1 g−1), Au nanosheets (1.22 mmol h−1 g−1), the physical mixture of CuFeSe2 NCs and Au nanosheets (1.72 mmol h−1 g−1), and CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets (2.55 mmol h−1 g−1) under visible light irradiation, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8A. Notably, the thermal effect caused by visible and NIR-light radiation is eliminated by using a connected reflux water condenser. In order to objectively compare the efficiency of oxygen evolution under different monochromatic lights, the apparent quantum yield (QY) was calculated. As shown in Fig. 8B, the efficiencies of O2 evolution in NIR light were higher than that in visible light. Generally, NIR light is easily converted to heat. As shown in Fig. S16,† when the reaction was carried out at 30 °C in the dark, the O2 evolution rate is only 99.67 μmol h−1 g−1. These experimental results indicate that the O2 generation is attributed to the near-infrared light driven CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet catalyst, not the temperature effect. The enhanced oxygen evolution for CuFeSe2@Au with NIR light should be due to the enhanced charge-carrier separation of CuFeSe2 NCs by Au nanosheets as electron trap centers. The O2 evolution rates for the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet photocatalysts remained stable over 10 h of testing, confirming good operational stability (Fig. 8A). The in situ formed CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets can extend the wavelength range from visible to NIR light for water oxidation; thus, they can be promising for developing multichannel solar energy conversion.

(B) The initial AQE of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets under different light irradiation. Reaction conditions: 10 mg catalysts, 0.1 M Na2S2O8, 1.0 M NaOH, 10 mL ultrapure water, under light irradiation. 
In order to confirm the charge-carrier separation of CuFeSe2 NCs by Au nanosheets, the chronoamperometric I–t curves were measured under NIR light irradiation (λ > 850 nm) at a bias voltage of 0.7 V (see the Experimental section). As shown in Fig. 9, both CuFeSe2 NCs and CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets exhibited significant photocurrent responses, but CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets showed a stronger response. Generally, the photocurrent intensity depended on both the photoelectron generation from the semiconductor via light activation and the photoelectron-hole recombination rate.50 When the CuFeSe2 NCs were activated by near-infrared light, the generated photoelectrons could be trapped by the Au nanosheets, which retarded the recombination of electrons and holes. Therefore, CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets exhibited stronger photocurrent responses than those of CuFeSe2 NCs alone.

4. Conclusions
In summary, new types of 2D core–shell CuFeSe2@Au heterostructured nanosheets having a crystalline shell and an amorphous core have been prepared via the reversed growth of Au nanosheets on the CuFeSe2 frameworks under NIR light irradiation. This is the first report on the preparation of 2D core–shell semiconductor@metal heterostructured nanosheets. The CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet showed strong absorption in the NIR region, and the valence band top of CuFeSe2@Au nanosheets is higher than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O. When used as a photocatalyst, the CuFeSe2@Au nanosheet could dramatically enhance photocatalytic water oxidation under NIR light irradiation (λ > 850 nm). This is the first report on a long wavelength photocatalyst that is capable of catalyzing water oxidation. It is expected that the versatility of this method demonstrates a promising way of synthesizing new 2D core–shell semiconductor@metal heterostructured nanosheets with enhanced performances in photocatalysis and energy conversion.
