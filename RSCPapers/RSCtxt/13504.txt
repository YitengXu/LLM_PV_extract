    , Accepted 4th November 2019First published on 5th November 2019AbstractA bifunctional ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 (ZIS/NbO) photocatalyst was constructed by growing Nb2O5 nanospheres on the petals of ZnIn2S4 microspheres via a facile hydrothermal approach. The composite possessed a direct Z-scheme heterostructure that was confirmed by in situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. Owing to the good charge separation efficiency in the Z-scheme system, the lifetime of charge carriers in ZIS/NbO was obviously prolonged. Thus, the rate of hydrogen evolution for optimized ZIS/NbO was 2.8 and 1.8 times higher than that of Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4, respectively. Furthermore, the ZIS/NbO also showed good performance for the oxidation of biomass-derived intermediate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to value-added products. More importantly, the coupled photocatalytic H2 reduction and HMF oxidation were achieved on the ZIS/NbO Z-scheme heterostructure at the same time. Due to the presence of a direct Z-scheme heterojunction that prevents the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in the composite, the ZIS/NbO displayed excellent photocatalytic performance. Our findings are expected to offer a broad optical window for fabricating bifunctional heterostructured composites for coupled photocatalytic reduction and oxidation.
Introduction
Solar-driven water splitting by employing semiconductor photocatalysts to construct renewable and storable energy systems is a highly promising strategy to solve the current growing energy crisis and environmental pollution.1,2 Researchers have made substantial efforts on utilizing sunlight to directly split water into H2 and O2.3–7 In general, there are two half reactions when employing a semiconductor as a photocatalyst to drive water splitting. The electrons on the conduction band were utilized to reduce water/protons for H2 evolution. Meanwhile, the holes on the valence band were used to oxidize water for O2 production.8,9 However, due to the sluggish kinetics of the O2 evolution reaction, the overall reaction rate is greatly restricted. In addition, higher overpotentials are needed for the production of O2 to coordinate with the rate of the H2 evolution reaction, resulting in poor energy conversion efficiency.10,11 Besides, as a promising electron acceptor, O2 can get electrons from the conduction band to produce some reactive oxygen species (ROS), which restrain the production of H2 and is harmful to the catalyst.12,13 Moreover, the fact that O2 has a low economic value should also be taken into consideration. Hence, it may not be beneficial to simultaneously produce H2 and O2.
Recently, intensive attention has been paid to deploy various electron donors to replace the oxidation evolution reaction to make sure H2 is continuously produced.14,15 Unfortunately, these electron donors still are not satisfactory due to their low economic efficiency. At present, oxidizing the renewable biomass resources into high value fine chemicals is a promising method to meet the stringent environmental and economic policies.16–18 So the oxidation of biomass derived chemicals would be a perfect replacement for the oxygen evolution reaction. As one of the popular biomass-derived chemicals, 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) is of high requirement for the synthesis of value-added chemicals like 2,5-diformylfuran dioxime and resins.19–21 In general, DFF is obtained by the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Therefore, the oxidation of HMF is a more beneficial choice to replace the low economical oxygen evolution reaction and expensive electron sacrificial agent and could simultaneously obtain H2 and DFF in a photocatalytic reaction. For example, Ni/CdS nanosheets were successfully employed as photocatalysts to carry out H2 evolution accompanied by HMF oxidation under visible-light irradiation.11 However, the hydrogen evolution rate is still very low which resulted from the low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Besides, it has been reported that porous carbon nitride is utilized as a visible light active photocatalyst for H2 production coupled HMF oxidation.3 However, the yield of DFF still remains unsatisfactory. Thus, exploiting a bifunctional photocatalyst, which could achieve efficient hydrogen evolution reaction coupled with the oxidation of HMF, is economically attractive and highly desirable.
Encouraged by natural photosynthesis that happens usually in green plants, Z-scheme photocatalytic systems have been paid increasing attention in recent years due to their high photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with traditional heterostructured photocatalysts, the direct Z-scheme photocatalyst has the ability to keep photogenerated electrons and holes in a high redox potential, promoting the photocatalytic performance greatly.22–28 For a Z-scheme system, photogenerated holes on a semiconductor with lower oxidation ability will be recombined by photogenerated electrons migrating from a second semiconductor with lower reduction ability. Therefore, the photogenerated electrons and holes with higher redox potentials can be preserved to participate in surface redox processes. Nb2O5 is a typical transition metal oxide semiconductor that has been applied in a wide range of applications.29–31 However, the large bandgap (about 3.4 eV) highly limits its application as a photocatalyst under solar light.30 Numerous efforts have been devoted to solve this restriction. Coupling Nb2O5 with various semiconductors that have suitable band structures is regarded as an effective approach to modify the band energy levels for the photocatalytic systems.32–34 However, the Nb2O5-based direct Z-scheme system is rarely reported. Thus, it is still challenging to construct the Nb2O5-based direct Z-scheme system as a bifunctional photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction coupled with the oxidation of HMF.
Herein, we utilized flower-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres to couple with Nb2O5 nanospheres to form a bifunctional photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction coupled with the oxidation of HMF via a hydrothermal strategy. Most interesting is that the charge carrier transfer pathway in ZIS/NbO was found to be in good agreement with the direct Z-scheme mechanism. The results of IS-XPS and ESR further verified the successful fabrication of a Z-scheme photocatalyst. As a result, it has been demonstrated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement that the addition of Nb2O5 can prolong the lifetime of charge carriers and accelerate the separation and generation between photogenerated electrons and holes, thus promoting the photocatalytic performance of the material. Such an architecture paves a new way to explore efficient bifunctional semiconductor photocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution and the valorization of biomass intermediates.
Experimental
Materials
The following materials were obtained: zinc chloride (ZnCl2, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O, Aladdin), thioacetamide (TAA, Aladdin), niobium oxalate (C10H5NbO20, Macklin), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, Aladdin). All these materials were of reagent grade and utilized without further purification.
Synthesis

Synthesis of Nb2O5 nanospheres. 
The Nb2O5 nanospheres were synthesized via a hydrothermal approach. Firstly, 0.74 g of niobium oxalate was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water under constant stirring. Then the clear solution was transferred to a 100 mL Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 453 K for 24 h. The final products were maintained at 333 K overnight after washing several times with deionized water.


Synthesis of ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 composites. 
A certain amount of the as-prepared Nb2O5 nanospheres, 0.136 g of ZnCl2 (1.0 mmol), 0.586 g of InCl3·4H2O (2.0 mmol), and 0.45 g of thioacetamide (6 mmol) were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. After stirring for 60 min, 1 M HCl was added dropwise to obtain a mixture with pH = 1. Then the suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Telfon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and maintained at 433 K for 12 h. The resultant nanocomposites were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and then dried at 333 K overnight. ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 nanocomposites with 2, 8 and 20 wt% Nb2O5 nanospheres were denoted as ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/NbO-8 and ZIS/NbO-20, respectively. ZnIn2S4 nanomaterials were synthesized via a similar method without adding the Nb2O5 nanosphere precursor.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku UItima III instrument with the 2θ ranging from 3 to 70° at a speed of 10° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained via a Zeiss Supra 55 microscope, while high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis was undertaken to record the data of lattice fringes and elemental mapping of the obtained products with the aid of a FEI Tecnai G2 F20. Inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS, NexION 300X) was utilized to verify the actual Nb2O5 amounts in the composites. The samples (about 4 mg) were completely dissolved in a mixed acid (concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid in a volume ratio of 3:1), and then diluted them to 500 mL with DI water. Next, 1 ml of the above solution was diluted to 10 ml with DI water for the tests. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed via an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer from Thermo Scientific. The source was monochromatic 150 W Al Kα and the passing energy was 30 eV, and binding energies are reported relative to the C 1s line at 284.8 eV. A Tsushima UV-3600 UV-vis spectrometer was employed to perform the diffuse reflectance ultraviolet and visible (DRUV-vis) spectroscopy test from 200 nm to 800 nm. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis of ZnIn2S4 and Nb2O5 was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi purchased from ThermoFisher. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis was conducted with the aid of a Conta AS-1C-VP analyzer. All samples were out-gassed at 373 K for 2 h, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method based on adsorption isotherms was utilized to determine the specific surface area. A CanyECLIPSe spectrophotometer (Varian) was deployed to obtain the photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and the excitation wavelength (λex) used in the test for PL lifetime was 330 nm, while the emission wavelength (λem) was 530 nm. For the value of the average lifetime (ave. τ), it is calculated via τ = τ1·A1 + τ2·A2 (τi = lifetime; Ai = relative intensity).35 The ISI-XPS was conducted under photo-irradiation with the aid of an optical fiber, and simulated solar light was provided by a 300 W Xe arc lamp. The ESR measurement was undertaken with the aid of an electron paramagnetic resonance A300 spectrometer (Bruker AXS Company, Germany). 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was used as a spin trap in this test to detect the reactive ˙OH species adsorbed on the photocatalysts or dissolved in water/methanol under simulated solar light irradiation.
Photocatalytic activity evaluation

Photocatalytic HMF oxidation. 
The photocatalytic oxidation reaction was undertaken in a double-neck flask (25 mL). A 300 W xenon lamp purchased from Beijing ChangTuo Ltd was utilized as the light source and the reaction was irradiated by simulated solar light. The reaction solution was maintained approximately 10 cm away from the light source. The reaction temperature was maintained at 303 K. The real light power density at the position of the reactor is determined to be 120 mW cm−2. The initial HMF concentration and volume of benzotrifluoride (solvent) were 10 mM and 5 mL, respectively. 50 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst was added into the above solution, and then the mixture was constantly stirred for 0.5 h in the dark to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. An O2 flow at a rate of 10 mL min−1 was used. Quantitative results of the photocatalytic products were analyzed with the aid of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Agilent 1260, equipped with a C18 AQ column). The mobile phase consists of 60% ultrapure water and 40% acetonitrile with a flow speed of 1 mL min−1.


Photocatalytic H2 evolution. 
Photocatalytic H2 production was undertaken with a Pyrex reaction cell equipped with a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. The real light power density at the position of the reactor is determined to be 700 mW cm−2. 15 mg of ZnIn2S4, Nb2O5, and ZIS/NbO were suspended into a mixed solution consisting of 7.5 mL of TEOA (hole-scavenging sacrificial reagent), 40 mL of deionized water and 30 μL of H2PtCl6 (60 mM in deionized water, Pt was used as a cocatalyst), respectively. Then the suspension was degassed for 30 min, and next irradiated by a simulated solar light source and stirred at a speed of 250 rpm. During the photocatalytic process, a flow of cooling water was utilized to keep the system at 278 K. Finally, an on-line Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector was employed to analyze the composition of the product mixture.
Photocatalytic H2 evolution tests of ZIS/NbO-8 under irradiation with different wavelengths (a 300 W xenon lamp purchased from Beijing ChangTuo Ltd with a quartz band pass filter of 550 nm, 500 nm, 475 nm and 400 nm, respectively) were also performed. The light intensity in these tests was 200 mW cm−2.


Bifunctional photocatalytic reaction. 
The reaction was carried out with a Pyrex reaction cell equipped with a closed gas circulation and evacuation system. The real light power density at the position of the reactor is determined to be 700 mW cm−2. 15 mg of the as-synthesized ZIS/NbO-8 was added into 40 mL of pure water or 1.25 mg mL−1 HMF aqueous solution. Then 30 μL of H2PtCl6 (60 mM in deionized water) was added into the mixture. Next, the obtained mixture was deoxygenated with N2 for 30 min, and the simulated solar light was utilized as the irradiation source. The on-line Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector was employed to analyze the composition of the product mixture. The conversion of HMF was analyzed by using a HPLC instrument (Agilent 1260, equipped with a C18 AQ column).


Photoelectrochemical measurements. 
An electrochemical workstation (CHI 660 C, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) was employed to conduct the photoelectrochemical analysis by using a standard three-electrode system. 2 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of mixed solution consisting of 0.75 mL of water, 0.25 mL of isopropanol and 0.02 mL of Nafion. The suspension was ultrasonicated for 5 min. Then, 80 μL of the suspension was evenly distributed onto the FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass) with 1 cm2 illuminated area. The as-prepared sample was dried in air to obtain the final working electrodes. A saturated calomel electrode was utilized as the reference electrode, while Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and the electrolyte solution was 0.5 M of Na2SO4 solution. The transient photocurrent responses were obtained with the aid of a simulated solar light lamp (700 mW cm−2) that sets itself on and off at a certain time period.

Results and discussion
Physicochemical properties of ZnIn2S4/Nb2O5 composites

Fig. 1a displays the XRD patterns of pure Nb2O5 nanospheres, ZnIn2S4 microspheres, ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/NbO-8 and ZIS/NbO-20. Obviously, all diffraction peaks of pure ZnIn2S4 fit well with that of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS 65-2023).36 The phase of synthesized Nb2O5 nanospheres is attributed to orthorhombic Nb2O5 (JCPDS 30-0873) as reported before.28 For ZIS/NbO with different loading amounts of Nb2O5, the major diffraction peaks are assigned to the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 phase, demonstrating that the addition of Nb2O5 does not affect the preferential growth orientations of ZnIn2S4. After growing some Nb2O5 nanospheres, there appears a small peak at about 22° in the nanocomposites, which is in agreement with the (001) plane of the orthorhombic Nb2O5 phase. With the increase of the loading amount, the intensity of the (001) peak increases, indicating that some Nb2O5 has been introduced onto ZnIn2S4. The SEM image is utilized to investigate the morphologies of pure Nb2O5, ZnIn2S4 and ZIS/NbO-8 nanohybrids, as shown in Fig. 1b–d and Fig. S1.†Fig. 1b displays a typical nanosphere of Nb2O5, which consists of some rod-like nanoparticles around 10 nm in width. It is found from Fig. 1c that pure ZnIn2S4 is constructed of a lot of flowerlike microspheres with the diameter of about 5 μm. As shown in Fig. 1d, Nb2O5 nanospheres are dispersed onto the flowerlike microspheres of ZnIn2S4, which is attributed to the good contact that is beneficial for the fast transfer of charge carriers between the two materials. The morphologies of ZIS/NbO-2 and ZIS/NbO-20 are shown in Fig. S1,† and a few Nb2O5 nanospheres are found on ZnIn2S4 petals in ZIS/NbO-2 and many nanospheres are dispersed on ZnIn2S4 microspheres that almost plug onto the petals in ZIS/NbO-20.

(e and f) HRTEM images of ZIS/NbO-8 and (g) its corresponding elemental mapping images of O, Nb, Zn, In and S. 
The detailed structure of ZIS/NbO-8 was further analyzed by HRTEM. The low-magnification HRTEM of the hybrids (Fig. 1e) reveals that the Nb2O5 nanospheres are embedded into the ZnIn2S4 petals, in accordance with the SEM images. The high-magnification HRTEM image of ZIS/NbO-8 (Fig. 1f) displays two clear sets of diffraction fringes, which can be indexed to the (001) crystal plane of orthorhombic Nb2O5 (d = 0.39 nm) and the (102) lattice plane of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 with an interlayer spacing of 0.32 nm, respectively. Elemental mapping characterization was carried out to investigate the elemental composition of the ZIS/NbO-8. As displayed in Fig. 1g, the elemental distribution for Zn, In and S is relatively more apparent and denser as ZnIn2S4 is dominant in the nanocomposite, while some elemental mapping dots for Nb and O are mainly located at the edge of ZnIn2S4 petals. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for ZIS/NbO-8 is shown in Fig. S2,† and there was an obvious Nb signal in ZIS/NbO-8. These results further confirmed the successful introduction of Nb2O5 onto ZnIn2S4 petals. With the aid of ICP-MS, the actual amounts of Nb2O5 for ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/NbO-8 and ZIS/NbO-20 were determined to be 0.52%, 2.39% and 11.27%, respectively.
The XPS measurement was performed to determine the chemical states of the elements in ZIS/NbO-8. The survey spectrum (Fig. 2a) indicates the signals of Zn, In, S, O and Nb elements, in accordance with the results of elemental mapping characterization. Fig. 2b–e show the high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2p, In 3d, S 2p and Nb 3d in the hybrids. As shown in Fig. 2b, there is a clear shift in the binding energies of Zn 2p, from 1045.2 and 1022.1 eV in ZnIn2S4 to 1045.0 and 1021.9 eV in ZIS/NbO-8, while the binding energies almost remain the same for In 3d and S 2p. Compared with pure Nb2O5 (209.8 and 207.1 eV), the binding energy of Nb 3d shifts to 210.1 and 207.4 eV. The changes in binding energies further demonstrate that there is a strong interaction between Nb2O5 nanospheres and ZnIn2S4 microspheres. The firm growth of Nb2O5 nanospheres on ZnIn2S4 petals facilitates the construction of intimate interfacial contacts, which efficiently promoted the charge-separation/transfer in the composites.

DRS was employed to investigate the optical properties of the as-prepared samples. As shown in Fig. 3a, Nb2O5 exhibits poor light absorption in the visible-light region, while pure ZnIn2S4 manifests strong photoabsorption in the same region. After embedding Nb2O5 nanospheres into the ZnIn2S4 petals, the hybrid displays better visible-light absorption than Nb2O5, but similar absorption as pure ZnIn2S4 (absorption edge at around 550 nm). It was calculated from the Tauc plots shown in Fig. 3b that the bandgap energies of Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 are 3.20 and 2.24 eV, respectively.37,38 We have also conducted UV-vis DRS analysis for ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/NbO-8 and ZIS/NbO-20. As shown in Fig. S3,† ZIS/NbO-8 exhibted the strongest light absorption from 220 nm to 600 nm among the three samples. The valence band edge of the as-prepared semiconductors in the absolute vacuum scale (vac) was evaluated by UPS. The UPS spectra of Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 are presented in Fig. 3c and d. The work function (ϕ) was determined using eqn (1). E1 represents the upper emission onset energy of secondary photoelectron energy, and the excitation energy of He I is 21.22 eV.39 The valence band energy in the absolute vacuum scale was obtained by adding the values of E2 (the lower emission onset energy) and work function (ϕ) together, as shown in eqn (2). The calculated EVB values were 7.19 and 5.81 eV, respectively. The conduction band energies were estimated using DRS results from eqn (3), and from eqn (4), we obtained the Fermi level position (Ef). Then eqn (5) was used to convert those values to the NHE scale.40 For Nb2O5, the values of EVB, ECB and Ef were calculated as 2.69, −0.51 and −1.34 eV, respectively, while for ZnIn2S4, they were 1.31, −0.93 and −1.18 eV, respectively. ϕ = 21.22 − E1(1) EVB = ϕ + E2(2) ECB = EVB − Eg(3) Ef = EVB − E2(4) E(NHE) = −E(vac) − 4.5(5)

Photocatalytic property

Fig. 4a and b depict the photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples with various loading amounts of Nb2O5 toward water splitting under simulated solar light irradiation. TEOA was employed as a sacrificial agent in the tests, and Pt used as the co-catalyst (deposited by the in situ photoreduction method). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 are all capable of catalyzing the H2 evolution, showing a H2 production rate of 2157 μmol g−1 h−1 and 3328 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Nonetheless, after growing some Nb2O5 nanospheres on ZnIn2S4 petals, ZIS/NbO-2 and ZIS/NbO-8 manifest substantially promoted performance, with the highest H2 production rate of 6026 μmol g−1 h−1 (Nb2O5 loading 8 wt%), implying that Nb2O5 content in the composite has a great effect on the photocatalytic performance. It is found that ZIS/NbO-8 is durable enough to produce H2 during the testing time as shown in Fig. 4c, while the H2 releasing rate of both Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 reveals an apparent decrease trend after catalyzing for 90 min. These results highlight the improved splitting activity of ZIS/NbO-8. In general, the structure and surface properties of oxides, such as surface area and adsorption, have an important effect on their photocatalytic properties.28 In order to eliminate the effect of surface area on the H2 production, we intend to compare the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates by normalizing to the specific surface area (SBET) of the photocatalysts. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis of Nb2O5, ZnIn2S4 and ZIS/NbO-8 was conducted to calculate the SBET of the samples. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are displayed in Fig. S4.† The results showed that the SBET of Nb2O5, ZnIn2S4 and ZIS/NbO-8 was calculated to be 187.93, 40.85, and 63.30 m2 g−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4d, the H2 evolution rate of ZIS/NbO-8 (95.18 μmol h−1 m−2) was still better than that of Nb2O5 (11.48 μmol h−1 m−2) and ZnIn2S4 (81.46 μmol h−1 m−2) after normalization to the SBET, indicating that the active sites in ZIS/NbO-8 have higher intrinsic activity due to its direct Z-schemed structure. The stability of ZIS/NbO-8 was assessed by conducting the H2-evolution reaction for 15 h and the H2 production was recorded every 3 h (Fig. S5†). There is no obvious deactivation in five successive cycles, indicating that the as-synthesized composites possess high stability. Also the H2 release on a physical mixture of Nb2O5 nanospheres (8 wt%) and ZnIn2S4 microspheres exhibited a lower production rate (1620 μmol g−1 h−1) compared with ZIS/NbO (6026 μmol g−1 h−1 for ZIS/NbO-8), verifying that charge transfer exists between Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4. If no Pt was used as the co-catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4c, the H2 production of ZIS/NbO-8 (without Pt as the co-catalyst) was only 1734 μmol g−1 after 3 h, much lower than that of ZIS/NbO-8 loaded with Pt (18075 μmol g−1). It is well-known that Pt was used for forming Pt–H bonds and subsequently reducing protons to generate H2via the conduction of band electrons. Therefore, Pt played the role of a co-catalyst in the evolution half reaction, which is in good agreement with the reported literature.41,42

In order to investigate the effect of wavelength on the photocatalytic H2 evolution, we have conducted the photocatalytic H2 evolution tests of ZIS/NbO-8 under irradiation with different wavelengths. As shown in Fig. S6a,† more H2 was produced with the decrease of the wavelength, and when the wavelength decreased to 400 nm, the sample displayed the highest H2 production (1528.3 μmol g−1). Fig. S6b† displays the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of ZIS/NbO-8 under photoirradiation with different wavelengths. The sample irradiated by light with a filter of 400 nm still showed the highest H2 production rate (611.3 μmol g−1 h−1). Thus, the H2 reduction reactions are indeed initiated by light excitation of the photocatalyst.
To calculate the quantum efficiency in the H2 evolution tests, we measured the H2 production of ZIS/NbO-8 under 365 nm LED light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S7,† the H2 evolution rate was calculated as 16.5 μmol h−1. The light intensity was 6.6 mW cm−2, and the light area was 12.56 cm2. Based on the above results, the quantum efficiency was determined to be 3.75%.

Fig. 5a and b display the photoconversion of HMF by pure Nb2O5, ZnIn2S4, ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/NbO-8 and ZIS/NbO-20 under simulated solar light. As a dominant product of HMF, DFF has a high value in industry as it is not only a crucial monomer of furan-based biopolymers, but also an important chemical intermediate that is applied in the conversion to functional polymers, and heterocyclic and pharmaceutical ligands.43–46 The formation of this product was confirmed by the results of GC-MS (Fig. S8†). From Fig. 5a and b, it is found that all ZIS/NbO composites exhibited higher catalytic performance than pure Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 after 3 h irradiation. The HMF conversions of ZIS/NbO-2, ZIS/Nb-8 and ZIS/NbO-20 are 59.3%, 85.5% and 61.9%, respectively. Among them, ZIS/Nb-8 showed the best HMF oxidation activity and highest DFF selectivity (88.3%). The above results indicate that the content of Nb2O5 also has an important effect on the photocatalytic performance of the composites for HMF oxidation reactions, and the optimum loading amount of Nb2O5 is 8 wt% in this case. The time plots of HMF oxidation performance on ZIS/NbO-8 are shown in Fig. 5c, indicating 85.5% conversion of HMF and 88.3% selectivity of the DFF product. The stability of ZIS/NbO-8 for the photocatalytic oxidation of HMF was also investigated (Fig. 5d), still no apparent deactivation appears after five cycles, suggesting a highly stable activity for HMF oxidation. For comparison, the photo-conversion of HMF on a physical mixture of Nb2O5 nanospheres (8 wt%) and ZnIn2S4 microspheres was also tested, showing 44.5% conversion of HMF and 16.0% yield of DFF, which were much lower than that for ZIS/NbO-8, suggesting the formation of the Z-scheme heterostructure is significant for the photocatalytic performance. A blank experiment without the photocatalyst under light irradiation for the photoconversion of HMF has also been carried out. The conversion of HMF and the yield of DFF was 4.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The small amount of conversion without the photocatalyst is mainly due to the heat produced by the light irradiation that has resulted in the conversion of HMF.47

In addition, reactive species trapping experiments were performed to investigate the main active species involved in the photocatalytic oxidation of HMF on ZIS/NbO-8. According to the literature,48 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), isopropanol (IPA), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-Na2) were used as the scavengers for superoxide radical (˙O2−), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) and holes (h+), respectively. As displayed in Fig. S9,† the photoconversion of HMF showed a significant decrease after the addition of BQ, implying that ˙O2− is the dominant reactive species in this oxidation. When EDTA-Na2 was added, it led to the reduction of photoconversion to a certain degree, demonstrating h+ also participated in the reaction. The conversion of HMF showed no distinct change after introducing IPA to the reaction, indicating that ˙OH is not the major reactive species in the photo-oxidation of HMF. Therefore, the reaction processes are suggested as follows: first of all, the photo-induced electrons and holes were separately irradiated by the simulated solar light; then the holes in ZIS/NbO react with HMF to form alkoxide radicals; next, the electrons in the composite reduce O2 to ˙O2−; finally, the product DFF could be obtained by oxidizing the alkoxide radicals with the aid of ˙O2− species.
As is concluded from the above results, both the H2 evolution activity and HMF oxidation performance of the ZIS/NbO composites were greatly enhanced, where the amount of Nb2O5 ranged from 2 wt% to 8 wt%. However, both photocatalytic activities decreased when the amount of Nb2O5 was further increased. The main reason is attributed to the contact of Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4. As observed from the SEM images (Fig. S1†), the large number of Nb2O5 nanospheres blocked the pores among the petals of ZnIn2S4 in ZIS/NbO-20, shielding the light radiated to the ZIS/NbO heterostructure and lacking sufficient interfacial contact of Nb2O5 with ZnIn2S4, and both of them are not beneficial for charge transfer. But for ZIS/NbO-2, because fewer Nb2O5 nanospheres were grown on the petals of ZnIn2S4, the transfer amount of photogenerated electrons between Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 was decreased. The optimal loading amount of Nb2O5 was 8 wt% that could provide a sufficient contact interface between Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4, resulting in the highest photocatalytic performance.
Then the application of ZIS/NbO was extended to a bifunctional photocatalytic system without the need for TEOA. HMF was introduced to this water splitting system to utilize ZIS/NbO as a bifunctional photocatalyst. The photocatalytic H2 production of ZIS/NbO-8 with or without HMF oxidation is compared in Fig. 6a. Obviously, there is an apparent enhancement in the photocatalytic performance and the H2 release amount increased to 1286 μmol g−1 in the presence of HMF, while no H2 was detected from pure water. The improvement of photocatalytic H2 production was mainly ascribed to the efficient use of photo-excited holes in the progress of HMF oxidation as the oxidation reaction can facilitate the separation of photo-excited charges. After 3 h of reaction, the conversion of HMF reached 21.6%. Therefore, the ZIS/NbO is used as an efficient bifunctional photocatalyst both for H2 evolution and HMF oxidation. A comparison of the XRD pattern and SEM image of ZIS/NbO before and after the photocatalytic reaction is shown in Fig. S10.† It is observed that there was almost no change, displaying a good stability of the composite. In addition, a bifunctional catalytic system test without Pt was conducted to discuss its effect on this reaction. For comparison, the test was carried out under the same condition. As shown in Fig. 6a, the H2 production was 1286 μmol g−1 and the conversion of HMF reached 21.6% with Pt as the cocatalyst. However, the H2 release amount decreased to 50 μmol g−1 and the conversion of HMF was only 1.5% without the existence of Pt. Therefore, Pt can be utilized as an effective cocatalyst in the bifunctional catalytic system. The schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 6b.

Mechanism considerations
Photoelectrochemical measurement on the as-synthesized photocatalysts was undertaken to understand the photocatalysis mechanism. As shown in the transient photocurrent spectra (Fig. 7a and Fig. S11†), there is a higher current response of ZIS/NbO-8 than that of the single component and the other two composites, reflecting that the charge transport kinetics in ZIS/NbO-8 was accelerated and more photo-induced charge carriers were produced. Photoexcited charge carriers are the crucial species for photocatalytic reactions, and it is fundamental to investigate the lifetime of the electron–hole pairs. To attain further insight of the dynamic performance of the photoinduced charge carriers, time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurement was also conducted. The decay profiles of both pure ZnIn2S4 and ZIS/NbO-8 are exhibited in Fig. 7b, the average lifetime of pure ZnIn2S4 was calculated as 7.24 ns, showing a shorter survival time of charge carriers than that of the ZIS/NbO-8 composite (9.01 ns), which implies the later has a higher separation efficiency of photo-exited electrons and holes. The prolonged survival time of charge carriers represents improved reaction abilities, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic experiments. In addition, steady-state PL spectra (Fig. S12†) further confirmed that ZIS/NbO-8 effectively inhibited the recombination of charge carriers as it displays weaker PL quenching than pure ZnIn2S4. The above measurements indicated that the separation and migration of photo-exited charges in ZIS/NbO-8 was improved, resulting in remarkable photocatalytic activity. The highest photocatalytic efficiency of ZIS/NbO-8 was due to the synergistic actions of the survival time of the electron–hole pairs and their recombination.

Based on the analysis of the band structure of Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4 as shown in Fig. 3e, there exist two possible charge carrier migration approaches (the traditional type-II heterojunction and direct Z-scheme system) in the photocatalytic systems, as shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, ISI-XPS measurement was deployed to investigate which pathway the interfacial charge migration follows between Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4. The same method has been employed to verify the presence of the Z-scheme system for the TiO2/CdS composite.49 As exhibited in Fig. 8a, the hybrid has two characteristic peaks at 445.3 (In 3d5/2) and 452.9 eV (In 3d3/2) assigned to ZnIn2S4 under light irradiation, showing a slight negative shift (by 0.2 eV) in the In 3d binding energy compared with that without light irradiation. The shift indicated that the electron density of ZnIn2S4 increased with light irradiation. Meanwhile, the two characteristic peaks of Nb2O5 at 208.0 (Nb 3d5/2) and 210.8 eV (Nb 3d3/2) are found in Fig. 8b without light irradiation, and a positive shift (by 0.2 eV) is observed upon light irradiation, demonstrating a decrease of the electron density on Nb2O5. These changes in binding energy directly suggested that the charge carrier transfer pathway across the hybrid interface with light irradiation (the same condition as the photocatalytic process) in good accordance with the direct Z-scheme heterojunction.

(e) Schematic illustration of the migration pathway of photogenerated electrons and holes in accordance with type-II and direct Z-scheme heterojunction of the ZIS/NbO-8 hybrid. 
To further understand the formation of the aforementioned direct Z-scheme heterojunction, ESR spin-trapping was employed to investigate the transient radical intermediates. In general, we deployed 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to trap radicals. ESR measurements were conducted in methanol solution (for DMPO-˙O2−) and aqueous solution (for DMPO-˙OH). Considering the fact that the calculated conduction band energy for both Nb2O5 (−0.51 eV vs. NHE) and ZnIn2S4 (−0.93 eV) is higher than that for the O2/˙O2− couple (−0.33 eV), they are all capable of reducing the dissolved O2 into ˙O2− (O2 + e− → ˙O2−). It was verified by the four characteristic peaks with identical intensity for all the three samples (Fig. 8c). But the DMPO-˙OH was only detected in Nb2O5 and ZIS/NbO-8 under simulated solar light irradiation, as demonstrated by the four characteristic peaks with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 in Fig. 8d. It is deduced that ˙OH radicals are produced on the two samples after irradiation. Moreover, it is obvious that the intensity of the four characteristic DMPO-˙OH signal peaks for pure Nb2O5 is weaker than that of ZIS/NbO-8, demonstrating that there are more ˙OH radicals generated on the surfaces of heterostructured ZIS/NbO-8 than pure Nb2O5. The result implies that more holes are accumulated on the valence band of Nb2O5 in the ZIS/NbO-8 composite. The results of radical spin trapping are in full compliance with the above ISI-XPS analysis, which further confirmed that a direct Z-scheme structure was successfully formed in the ZIS/NbO-8 composite rather than a traditional type-II heterojunction. If there is a formation of type-II heterojunction, the photoexcited electrons would tend to migrate from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 to the conduction band of Nb2O5, while holes would be migrated from the valence band of Nb2O5 to the valence band of ZnIn2S4. However, as the potential energy (1.31 eV vs. NHE) of holes for ZnIn2S4 is more negative than that for the H2O/˙OH (2.4 eV) couple, the holes generated on the valence band of ZnIn2S4 have no ability to oxidize H2O into ˙OH. Therefore, the formation of a type-II heterojunction system is ruled out, and the transfer pathway of photo-excited electrons fits well with an all-solid-state Z-scheme system. Due to the presence of the direct Z-scheme heterojunction, which prevents the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole in the composite, it is not surprising that the ZIS/NbO-8 has both stronger transient photocurrent response and a longer lifetime (in Fig. 7).
Overall, a direct Z-schemed migration pathway of charge carriers was proposed to proceed over the ZIS/NbO composite enhancing photocatalytic activities for both H2 revolution and HMF oxidation, and, the results were confirmed by the ISI-XPS and ESR measurements. Specifically, when the composite absorbed photons with enough energy, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of Nb2O5 were transferred to the valence band of ZnIn2S4, then, recombined with the holes, consequently suppressing the recombination of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band of ZnIn2S4. Meanwhile, the photoexcited electrons and holes were congregated in the conduction band of ZnIn2S4 and valence band of Nb2O5, respectively. As a result, the ZIS/NbO composite retained both high reduction ability of ZnIn2S4 and high oxidation ability of Nb2O5, offering a strong driving force for the photocatalytic reactions. In general, the noble metal prefers to deposit at the electron-rich area of a semiconductor in the process of photo-deposition.50,51 Herein, the photo-deposition of Pt nanoparticles in the composite was accumulated on the ZnIn2S4 surface, as verified in Fig. S13.† Therefore, the photoexcited electrons accumulated on the surface of ZnIn2S4 were transferred to Pt nanoparticles for taking part in the surface water splitting for H2 evolution, while the photoexcited holes gathered on the Nb2O5 surface participated in HMF oxidation. The transfer pathway of such a direct Z-scheme system significantly promoted the charge separation efficiency as was proved by the measurements and offered a strong force both for H2 evolution and HMF oxidation, improving the photocatalytic performance. In this work, the ZnIn2S4-based material firstly exhibited the excellent promoting effect for photocatalytic HMF oxidation. Compared with other Nb2O5-based systems (Table S1†), the HER rate for the Z-schemed ZIS/NbO composite is among the best. We have also compared our work with some other reported literature for the photocatalytic HMF oxidation as listed in Table S2,† and the ZIS/NbO-8 is among the best except Au0.5Ru2.5/rGO (but the Au and Ru are all expensive metals). Obviously, the 3D direct Z-schemed ZIS/NbO composite offered more adsorption and active sites and inhibited the recombination of the photoexcited electrons with holes effectively.
Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally designed and successfully constructed a direct Z-scheme heterostructure ZIS/NbO as an efficient bifunctional photocatalyst. A series of characterization studies have been conducted to demonstrate the successful fabrication of the Z-scheme structure. Compared with Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4, the ZIS/NbO shows a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers due to the Z-scheme migration path. Therefore, the Z-scheme ZIS/NbO heterostructure achieved a higher H2 evolution rate and biomass-derived HMF oxidation production than that of sole Nb2O5 and ZnIn2S4. Furthermore, the coupled photocatalytic H2 reduction and HMF oxidation at the same time was achieved on the ZIS/NbO Z-scheme heterostructure. Our work is supposed to provide a broad optical window for designing bifunctional direct Z-scheme heterostructures for coupled photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction.
