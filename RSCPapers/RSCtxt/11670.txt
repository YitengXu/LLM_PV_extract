    , Accepted 22nd January 2016First published on 26th January 2016AbstractTo achieve high performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction, a series of Cu pillar electrodes (Cu-2.5 h, Cu-5 h) were fabricated by using an electrodeposition method, and then their catalytic activities and reaction mechanisms were investigated. The series of Cu pillar electrodes exhibited improved electrocatalytic activities toward CO2 reduction to formic acid (HCOOH) as Cu pillars on electrodes developed. The Cu-5 h electrode performed well with a 28% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid at −0.5 V (vs. RHE). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated that the enhanced catalytic activities were primarily attributable to the increased (111) facet, which is energetically favourable for the production of HCOOH. Also, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results suggested that the series of Cu pillar structure electrodes improved the electron transfer to adsorbed CO2 due to the decreased work function of the Cu pillar structure.
1. Introduction
Since the industrial revolution, humankind has recklessly spent massive amounts of fossil fuels resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. As a result, the accumulation of CO2 has reached 1430 giga tonnes since the 1870s.1 Global warming and abnormal climate change caused by excessive CO2 emission have now turned into a global crisis.2 To mitigate this issue, the electrochemical conversion of accumulative CO2 into renewable energy sources is highly recommended.3 Theoretically, the CO2 electroreduction system requires a thermodynamic potential of approximately −0.25 to −0.52 V (vs. NHE at pH 7) for the conversion into various hydrocarbons.4,5 This implies that the required thermodynamic potential can be attained from solar and wind power generation in a renewable and sustainable manner.6–8 With the incorporation of renewable energy sources, it is beneficial from an ecological point of view to use water as a hydrogen (H2) source, since water is an abundant resource on earth. In addition, this technology is not only easy to adopt for practical applications and scale-ups, but can also supply artificial fuel to industries.9
To provide artificial fuel from eco-friendly feedstock, electrochemical CO2 reduction requires an appropriate electrocatalyst, which guarantees high selectivity, low overpotential, high production rate, and long-term stability. To meet these criteria of an electrocatalyst candidate, many studies have been conducted to find alternatives, for example, semiconductors, proteins, metal complexes, organic materials, and transition metals.10–13 Among these candidates, transition metals, especially d-block metals (d8–d10), have attracted great interest due to their inherent catalytic activity toward CO2 and simplicity of modification.14–16 During the investigation of the catalytic activities and reaction mechanisms of these materials, researchers have confirmed that CO2 reduction and H2 evolution rates of the catalyst have a very intimate relationship, as these two reactions are competitive. Moreover, catalysts should have the ability to form adsorbed CO2 as a reaction intermediate expediting further hydrocarbon formation at the catalytic active sites. The aforementioned qualities, regarding H2 evolution and formation of a reaction intermediate, are key aspects in designing an optimum electrocatalyst which can improve catalytic activity through providing alternative reaction mechanism.17 Hence, Cu has been researched due to its intrinsic catalytic activity, in that the CO2 is electrochemically converted into various products, such as CO, formic acid (HCOOH), methane (CH4), and ethylene (C2H4).18–20 The variation of reduction products by the Cu electrode considerably depends on the surface properties like orientation and morphology, as these characteristics influence the type of intermediate which then leads to the formation of various hydrocarbons.21–24
Based on the fact that the selectivity of CO2 reduction on the Cu electrode is determined by surface orientation, controlling the orientation is considered as one of the most significant factors in the application of CO2 reduction reactions. Several approaches have been attempted to verify the relationship between surface orientation and selectivity through a modification of the Cu surface.25,26 According to the research, the selectivity of a reduction product is determined by the formation energy of the adsorbed intermediate, which varies with crystal orientation on the surface. Selectivity is increased at a lower index facet, such as (111), (100) and (211) lattices, which has a favorable formation energy of the intermediate when compared to a higher index facet. Consequently, in the aspect of modification of the Cu surface, preparing a nanostructured electrode which has a low-index facet can be a novel approach to increase the selectivity toward hydrocarbons.23 A predominant low-index facet induced by a rough surface on a nanoparticulate electrode augments selectivity attributed to reduction in the free energy of formation of the reduction product.21
Along with the enhancement of selectivity, nanoparticles dramatically amplify current density for CO2 reduction reactions.23,24,27 The increase in current density on the electrode composed of nanoparticles is a consequence of overly numerous active sites, which have favorable formation energy of the reaction intermediate. In other words, an electrode with a nanosized structure can achieve an increase of selectivity and productivity at once. Also, more interestingly, based on the previous research, surface modification even decreases the overpotential for CO2 reduction toward CO and HCOOH. Kanan's group has reported a nanostructured Cu electrode as an electrocatalyst that exhibits over 45% CO and 35% HCOOH Faradaic efficiency at −0.35 V and −0.55 V (vs. RHE), respectively.27 These phenomena can be interpreted that an increased surface area intensifies the initial electron transfer to adsorbed CO2 on a modified Cu surface as well as encourages the production rate of hydrocarbon at low overpotential. In addition, the modified electrode brings positive outcomes, along with long-term stability. Herein, we employ a series of Cu pillar structures to consolidate the effect of surface modification that contributes to improved selectivity, high productivity, long-term stability and low overpotential. We anticipate that hierarchical growth of the Cu pillar structure may affect surface properties and bring about a progressive outcome for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The Cu pillar structure selectively converts CO2 to HCOOH with significantly low overpotential because the increased surface area promotes facile electron transfer to CO2. To provide solid evidence of facile electron transfer from a modified Cu electrode to CO2, we calculated the work function of each electrode and compared them by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). We also investigated the resistance of each electrode with various applied potentials by using in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These results give us useful information on the correlation between the diminished onset potential of the CO2 reduction reaction and the increase in the surface area.
2. Experimental
2.1 Electrochemical deposition of the Cu pillar structure
A highly perpendicular Cu nanopillar structure was prepared by cathodic electrodeposition on a Cu foil substrate (1 cm2, 250 μm thickness, 99.99% Cu, Aldrich), which was also used as a counter electrode. The solution for electrodeposition was composed of 5.5 g of CuSO4·5H2O (Aldrich), 1.1 g of ammonium sulfate (Aldrich) and 4.4 mL of diethyltriamine (DETA, Aldrich) in 55 mL of DI water. The electrode assembly was a stack of a working electrode, an aluminium oxide membrane (AAO, Whatman, Anodisc 47200 nm pore size), a separator (Filter paper, Whatman, Grade 1), and a counter electrode, in sequence. Before the cathodic electrodeposition, the working electrode was mechanically polished and ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water. Isolation adhesive films covered the outer part of the Cu electrodes to prevent unintended reactions. Stainless steel clamps held onto the stacked electrodes with a constant pressure during the deposition time. The assembly was immersed in the precursor solution with vigorous stirring during the deposition. Cathodic electrodeposition on the Cu electrode was attained by applying the multi-current step technique by using a potentiostat (CHI 750D, CH Instruments Inc.). This technique applied pulsed current with a cathodic current pulse of −2 mA cm−2 for 250 ms and −30 mA cm−2 for 50 ms. A series of Cu pillar structures were prepared with total deposition times of 2.5 hours (Cu-2.5 h) and 5 hours (Cu-5 h). After the deposition process, the working electrode was dismantled from the assembly, which had been immersed in a 1 M sodium hydroxide solution at 80 °C for 5 min to erase the AAO supporter. Then, the Cu working electrode was stored in an acidic copper sulphate solution to remove copper oxide that had formed during the AAO elimination process and to avoid oxide passivation through the air.28
2.2 Physical characterization
The physical characteristics of the prepared series of Cu pillar structures were analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UPS. The XRD patterns were obtained by thin film XRD (RIGAKU D/MAX-RC) using the radiation from a Cu Kα source at 30 kV and 60 mA. The surface morphology and composition of the prepared electrodes were observed by using a FESEM (Hitachi S-4800) equipped with EDS (Horiba) at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. The deposition of Cu was confirmed by using an XPS instrument (Sigma Probe of Thermo VG Scientific) equipped with a microfocused monochromator X-ray source. The work functions of Cu foil, Cu-2.5 h and Cu-5 h electrodes were measured by UPS, using the same equipment as that used for XPS.
2.3 Electrochemical test
Electrochemical activities were measured by using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 750D, CH Instruments Inc.). The standard calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt gauze (Sigma, 99.9%) were used as the reference and counter electrode, respectively. Electrolyses were performed on a fuel-cell-like two-compartment electrochemical cell separated by a piece of SELEMION anion exchange membrane. The electrolyte was N2- or CO2-bubbled 0.1 M KHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution (pH 6.6–6.7), in which analytical grade water (HPLC Certified Solvent, Burdick&Jackson) was used. The results in the N2-bubbled electrolyte were included only for comparison with those of the CO2-bubbled electrolyte. Each compartment contained 10 mL of electrolyte. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 at various constant potentials (i.e. from −0.2 to −0.9 V vs. RHE) was performed in CO2-bubbled 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution. All potentials were measured against an SCE reference electrode and converted to the RHE reference scale using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. SCE) + 0.241 V + 0.0591 V × pH. EIS was performed at various constant potentials (i.e. from −0.4 to −0.7 V vs. RHE) under the same experimental condition as the electrochemical activity test. The impedance spectra of each electrode were measured in the frequency range between 1 MHz and 100 mHz with a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV.
2.4 Liquid product analysis
Liquid products were analysed by 700 MHz 1H 1D liquid NMR (Bruker Avance) at 25 °C. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as an internal chemical shift reference. The standard solution was 2 mM dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 10 mM phenol in D2O solvent (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). NMR samples were prepared by mixing 540 μL of product-containing electrolyte and 30 μL of standard solution. The amount of products was calculated by comparing the integral areas of the products with that of phenol. The peak positions were calibrated with purchased HCOOH (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution containing the standard solution.
2.5 Gas product analysis
Gas products were analysed by using a 7890 Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Carboxen-1000 columns (12390-U, Supelco) were used for both TCD and FID, respectively, and Ar (99.999%) was used as a reference gas. Before beginning the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 (99.99%) was purged for 30 min. CO2 was continuously purged into the reactor and vented to the sampling loops with 6 sccm of gas flow velocity. This flow contains the gas products from electrochemical CO2 reduction. When two gas sampling valves collected the product gas at the same time, one collected gas that flowed to the TCD for detecting H2 and CO2, while the other collected the gas sample that passed through the methanizer and then was analysed by FID for detecting CO. The oven temperature was changed from 80 °C to 225 °C during analysis. Aliquots were collected every 18 min during the reaction.
2.6 Surface area determination
The surface area of an electrode can be estimated by measuring the electric double layer thickness. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with each Cu electrode in the same electrochemical system. In the case of this measurement, a Nafion proton exchange membrane was employed instead of an anion exchange membrane.
The obtained CVs were measured in the potential range from 0.1 to −0.3 V (vs. RHE), and geometric current density was plotted against the scan rate of the CV. The capacitance of each electrode was calculated from the slope of the current density upon the scan rate of the CV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characteristics of the prepared Cu pillar electrodes
A series of highly perpendicular Cu pillar structures were deposited by using cathodic electrodeposition and their perpendicular feature was confirmed by FESEM. Fig. 1a–d show the FESEM images of Cu-2.5 h and Cu-5 h, respectively. The images indicated that the Cu pillar structure hierarchically grew in Cu-5 h as well as Cu-2.5 h (i.e. average length of Cu pillars was 7 μm and 15 μm for Cu-2.5 h and Cu-5 h, respectively). The diameter of the pillar in Cu-5 h was measured to be about 180 to 360 nm, which corresponds to the pore diameter of the AAO membrane used in cathodic electrodeposition. The gap between the pillars was sufficient for CO2 to penetrate and transform into reduced products.29

To give crystallographic evidence of Cu pillar formation, we measured X-ray diffraction. Fig. 1e shows an XRD pattern of Cu pillar structures and untreated Cu foil. In the case of the XRD pattern of the Cu pillar structure, the metallic Cu peak at 2θ = 43.3° and 50.5° corresponded to (111) and (200), respectively (# JCPDS: 04-0836). Interestingly, the crystallographic growth of the Cu pillar structure is preferred along the (111) plane than the (200) plane while that of untreated Cu foil was dominated by the (200) plane. Unlike on the Cu foil substrate, the intensity of the (111) lattice intensified as the deposition time increased. On the other hand, the intensity of the (200) plane diminished as the reaction time progressed. The relative ratios of different crystal facets for (111)/(200) were 3.66, 2.13 and 0.53 for Cu-5 h, Cu-2.5 h, and Cu foil, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). We assumed a Cu pillar growth mechanism in which the Cu precursor is soaked in the separator between the cathode and the anode deposits layer-by-layer through the pores of the AAO membrane. The (111) facet, which is energetically the most favourable facet, stacks along the normal direction of the growth axis of the Cu pillar. Also, in previous studies, the Cu pillar structure has commonly shown this type of preferential growth during the perpendicular growth of the pillar structure.30,31
In addition to the XRD results of the metallic Cu pillar, the composition of the Cu pillar was confirmed by XPS (Fig. 1f and Fig. S1a, ESI†) and EDS analysis (Fig. S1b, ESI†). In compositional analysis by XPS and EDS measurements, oxygen contamination by air and AAO membrane was not detected: in the XPS result, Cu 2p peaks which emerged at 952 eV and 932.2 eV indicated metallic Cu.32 Also, the EDS result showed that the Cu pillar structure is composed of 95 atomic% of Cu with a negligible amount of oxygen (under 5%) (Fig. S1b, ESI†).
3.2 Electrochemical activity of Cu pillar electrodes
Electrochemical CO2 reduction activities of Cu pillar structures were evaluated by chronoamperometry at various applied potentials (i.e. from −0.2 V to −0.9 V vs. RHE). The electrochemical CO2 reduction was conducted for 6 hours at each applied potential. The quantity of reaction products was confirmed by 1H NMR and GC. The detailed results including the Faradaic efficiency of CO2 reduction and the production rate of H2, CO, and HCOOH at each electrode are shown in Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†). The main product from CO2 reduction was HCOOH by using Cu pillar electrodes and the results are summarized and plotted in Fig. 2a as Faradaic efficiency versus applied potentials.

 Fig. 2  (a) Faradaic efficiency of the Cu pillar structure and (b) chronoamperometry curve of the Cu-5 h electrode for 6 hours. Data for the Faradaic efficiency of the copper electrode are literature data (ref. 5) obtained in saturated 0.1 M KHCO3. 
The formation of HCOOH started at −0.2 V and −0.3 V on the Cu-5 h and Cu-2.5 h electrodes, respectively. However, the reference data of polycrystalline Cu (i.e. Cu foil) which was conducted by Hori's group begin with −0.5 V. It is noteworthy that these potentials (i.e. −0.2 V and −0.3 V vs. RHE) are similar to the standard redox potential of formic acid (i.e. −0.19 V vs. RHE), indicating a very low overpotential loss. The highest value of Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH of 28.7% was exhibited by the Cu-5 h electrode. This value was 6 times higher than that of the polycrystalline Cu electrode, which was 5% at the same applied potential.5 Also, these results were meaningful in that the onset potential and the most efficient potential for CO2 reduction showed a decreased tendency compared to those of polycrystalline electrode. Furthermore, the tendency became more distinguished with longer deposition time for the pillar structure. However, the Faradaic efficiency of hydrogen evolution increased from applied potential at −0.6 V in contrast to that of hydrogen evolution showing a decreasing tendency at low applied potential range from −0.2 V to −0.5 V (Table 1 and Table S2, ESI†). This phenomenon has been often reported in previous research studies, which adopted Cu nanoporous electrodes due to the limited CO2 mass transportation.27 Increased hydrogen evolution at negatively high applied potential can be solved by improving mass transport by using a flow cell or a gas diffusion electrode.
We assume that the increased surface area and the preferential growth of the Cu pillar structure will lead to positive effects for CO2 reduction reactions such as relatively low onset potential and a decrease of the most efficient potential. According to the XRD results, the longer the deposition time is, the more intensified is the (111) lattice while the (200) lattice is diminished (Table S1, ESI†). Based on the previous density functional theory (DFT) studies, the (211) facet has been known as the surface that has the most favourable free energy to form hydrocarbons. Otherwise, the (100) and (111) facets have relatively high free energy than the (211) facet18,21,33 (i.e. we assumed that the (200) facet is identical to (100) facets in the bcc cubic system and equivalent in DFT calculation results). However, the formation of HCOOH is slightly different from that of hydrocarbons. In other words, the formation of HCOOH, mainly originating from the F-intermediate (OCHO*), is different from the predicted reduction pathway. The (111) facet, which indicates the most appropriate free energy for adsorption of OCHO*, requires less negative overpotential to produce HCOOH than the (211) and (100) facets. The favourable transformation from OCHO* to HCOOH is also proved by Nie et al., who investigated the reaction mechanisms of CO2 electrochemical reduction on a Cu(111) facet with the DFT study.34 In addition, the alternative reaction pathway to form a formic acid on the (111) facet is also shown in the DFT study conducted by Durand et al.33 According to the DFT calculation, the reaction mechanism follows an opposite trend to that of the other products, such as CH4 and C2H4, due to the adsorption of OCHO* which leads to a less negative potential requirement for the (111) surface than the (211) surface. Based on the aforementioned DFT studies, we predict that the adsorbed species on the (111) facet in a Cu pillar structure was OCHO* and this may contribute to high Faradaic efficiency at relatively low applied potential.
In terms of practical application, it is crucial to ensure not only CO2 reduction with low overpotential but also increased current density with long term stability. The current density of the Cu pillar electrode measured for 6 hours in the range of −0.2 to −0.9 V is shown in Fig. 2b (i.e. the current normalized by the apparent electrode area (1 cm2)). According to the electrochemical activity test, modification of the Cu electrode induced not only reducing the required overpotential for CO2 reduction but also amplifying the current density at various applied potentials. Also, the increased current density of Cu pillar electrodes induced by modification of the electrodes was maintained for 6 hours without current density drop. However, the current density of Cu foil electrode dropped from 1 mA cm−2 to 0.6 mA cm−2 (i.e. 40% of current density drop) (Fig. S2, ESI†). To verify the surface modification effect, we performed surface area measurements by checking the double layer capacitance, which indirectly tells us the active area.27 By calculating the slope of current density against the scan rate, we can figure out the roughness factor, which has a higher value for a larger active area. Fig. 3 displays the variation of current density versus scan rate for each electrode. As we expected, the Cu-5 h electrode exhibits the highest value of the roughness factor, which is 344. This result correlates with the current density of the Cu-5 h electrode which has the highest current density due to the increased number of active sites than the others. Moreover, it is obvious that enhancement of current density consequently improves the production rate which is 28.8 μmol h−1 at −0.9 V for 6 hours. In the case of the Cu pillar electrode at −0.8 and −0.9 V, current density seemed to be decreased during the electrochemical test. The current density drop at negative applied potentials is attributed to increased concentration of the products. This phenomenon was also observed in another experiment.35 The current density drop due to the accumulation of the product could be improved by a flow system.

3.3 Effect of surface modification on Cu
Based on our experimental observations, the modified Cu electrodes exhibited a lower onset potential than polycrystalline electrodes. Also, the modified Cu electrodes selectively reduced CO2 to HCOOH. This is due to the fact that less overpotential is required for the formation of formic acid on the (111) facet than on the other facets. In addition, we postulate that the Fermi level of the electrode may enhance electron transfer, and as a result, it will help to decrease the overpotential of CO2 reduction. To provide compelling evidence of a decrease of overpotential, we measured the work function and Ef of each electrode (Fig. 4a). The relationship between the work function and reactivity has been studied in many types of surface modification36–39 because the work function of metal electrodes can be regulated by surface modification such as particle size variation or by deposition methods.40,41 According to the studies, the work function of electrodes is measured by UPS analysis, which is the following equation:We = hν − |Esec − Ef|where hν is 21.2 eV when using a He I source, Esec is the onset of the secondary emission, and Ef is the Fermi edge. The work function is defined as the minimum thermodynamic energy to remove an electron near the Fermi energy which is bound to the interior of the solid to a position outside the solid surface. When the values of Esec are the same, the work function is decreased to a small value of Ef. An electrode that modulates an upward shift of Ef toward zero binding energy ejects energetically more reactive electrons. In previous research conducted by Trasatti,39 a lower work function correlated with catalytic activity due to the easier extraction of electrons from the metallic phase and, as a result, more reactive electrons extracted. In the case of our experiment, more reactive electrons migrate to CO2 immediately, and we interpret the enhanced electron migration as facile electron transfer. In that sense, facile electron transfer, which causes intensified selectivity, is ascribed to low work function. Thus, an increase of work function in a perpendicularly augmented Cu pillar, which is changed from 4.8 to 4.2 and 3.7 eV in Cu foil to Cu-2.5 h and Cu-5 h, respectively, supports our argument. The effect of surface modification, which causes enhanced electron migration and facile electron transfer, was also confirmed by in situ EIS measurements of each electrode. Both ohmic resistance and charge transfer resistance, which mean resistance for CO2 reduction and electron diffusion on the electrode, respectively, showed the minimum values of 80.5 Ω for ohmic resistance and 65.9 Ω for charge transfer resistance at the Cu-5 h electrode in various applied potentials (Fig. 4b and Fig. S2, Table S3, ESI†). This diminished tendency corresponds to a decrease of overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction as well as the work function of electrodes. These correlations support our argument that surface modification decreases the overpotential for the CO2 reduction reaction.38

As in the aforementioned postulation, improved surface area promotes electron transfer to adsorbed CO2. This can be a hypothesis as to why a negligible amount of CO is detected in this system (Table 1). Taking account of the high selectivity of HCOOH with low potential, we have a question about the negligible amount of CO produced during the CO2 reduction reaction, unlike previous studies. The production of CO originates from the dissociation of adsorbed formate into CO and water. There are two types of reaction intermediates. One is adsorbed OCHO*, which is considered a major intermediate on the (111) facet and produces HCOOH without a further reduction. The other is the carboxyl intermediate, which refers to the C-intermediate (COOH*), the main reaction intermediate of CO production. In spite of a tendency to increase the (111) facet in Cu pillars, electrodes still have (100) and other facets. The other facets, which include the (100) facet, are preferable for the adsorption of CO2 as a COOH* type.33 This implies that there is a chance to have COOH* for CO production. However, based on our result, we expected that COOH* was also desorbed into HCOOH rather than being dissociated into water and CO due to the enhanced electron transfer from the electrode to the adsorbed species through the surface modification. Facile electron transfer through the pillar electrode may affect the reaction mechanism, and as a result, only a small amount of CO would be detected. This result can explain the absence of hydrocarbon production in this experiment. Previous studies mechanistically and practically demonstrate that adsorbed CO is the key intermediate to produce CH4 or C2H4. Thus, it is obvious that there is no production of CH4 of C2H4 without CO. We conclude that the prevalence of the (111) facet and facile electron transfer affected the reaction pathway, and eventually, HCOOH selective reduction occurred due to the Cu pillar structure.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of modified Cu pillar electrodes were designed as a promising strategy for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction. Cu was selected as an electrocatalyst due to its variety of reduction products and adequate binding energy for CO and H2 for reduction of CO2. Catalytic activities in terms of Faradaic efficiency, reaction selectivity and productivity were improved through the surface modification of the Cu electrode. The Cu pillar electrode, especially Cu-5 h, demonstrated a relatively high Faradaic efficiency of 28% at −0.5 V with low overpotential and negligible production of CO. The performance of CO2 reduction on Cu pillar electrodes was different from that of the previously reported HCOOH that was produced along with a negligible amount of CO production. This is because the majority of the surface lattice, the (111) facet, rules the reaction with the formation of the F-intermediate, and as a result, CO2 is mostly reduced to HCOOH. Another well-known intermediate, C-intermediate, which binds to the (100) facet, is presumably reduced to HCOOH. This is because enhanced electron transfer amplified by surface modification assists the reduction to end up with HCOOH and hinders CO formation. This assumption of the reaction mechanism is supported by XRD analysis, UPS measurements, EIS study, and double layer capacitance which indicate the lattice plane, the work function of each electrode, and the increased surface area, respectively.
