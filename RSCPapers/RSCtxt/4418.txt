    , Accepted 10th June 2020First published on 11th June 2020AbstractWO3−x (oxygen deficient tungsten oxide) thin films and WO3−x/Ta2O5 (tantalum oxide) composite films exhibit a huge photochromic effect with 60% near-infrared transmission modulation, in comparison to results in the literature. The colouring efficiency of such films results from both the stoichiometry of the particles (oxygen/tungsten deficient ratio) and the quality of the films (films are thin, homogeneous, and constituted of nanoparticles of about 5 nm in diameter and so with low scattering). Additionally, the high colouring efficiency obtained with a low fluence ultraviolet (UV) lamp is followed by a nearly complete bleaching phenomenon after a few hours in the dark. Beyond the attractiveness of our films toward multiple applications, and especially as films able to regulate the solar flow through smart windows, the optical properties and the colouring and bleaching kinetics were deeply investigated. For both the WO3−x thin films and the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite films, colouring under irradiation and bleaching in the dark are phenomena that both proceed with a complex kinetics combining ultra-fast processes (from charge transfer, with a characteristic time of about one minute) and slower processes (linked to ionic diffusion, with a characteristic time of about one hour or even longer).
1. Introduction
Photochromism is the ability of a material to change its coloration in a reversible way under light irradiation. Photochromic materials can be divided into two main groups: organic materials, such as spiropyrans, azobenzenes or diarylethenes,1–4 and inorganic materials, such as transition metal oxides, metal halides or rare earth complexes.5–8 Several chemical processes, induced by irradiation, can lead to a color change of a compound. For inorganic materials, photochromic phenomena are essentially linked to a photoinduced redox process.
Inorganic photochromic materials are generally transition metal oxides. These oxides are large gap semiconductors (between 2.5 and 3.5 eV) like the molybdenum, niobium, vanadium or tungsten compounds: MoO3,6,9–12 Nb2O5,13,14 V2O515,16 or WO3.5,17–21 Regarding more particularly tungsten oxide, Deb was the first to highlight the photochromic properties of WO3 thin films, in 1973.5 Although WO3 has not been the preferred material for working on photochromism, as compared to MoO3, which exhibits better photochromic effects in terms of contrast and kinetics, WO3 photochromism has recently become a very hot topic, as shown by the high number of publications devoted to the subject in the last 12 months.22–26 Indeed, despite the weak optical contrast between colored and bleached states and its very slow and incomplete bleaching process (lack of adequate reversibility for many applications), WO3 oxide has become more and more studied. Indeed, based on the optimization of crystallite morphologies, recent studies have been carried out showing a particular interest in producing photosensitive and reprintable inks27,28 based on WO3 nanoparticles.
The mechanisms governing photochromism in transition metal oxides are complex and are not fully understood yet, at least they remain a subject of controversy. However, the literature reports agreed on the fact that the photochromism mechanism is induced by irradiation wavelengths allowing transfer through the semiconductor forbidden band with the creation of an exciton, i.e. for light energy in the UV range for WO3, since the gap between valence and conduction band is located at the border between the UV and visible range for this oxide. In 1973,5 Deb proposed a complete model explaining the photochromic effect in WO3 films under UV irradiation. Deb proposed that the photochromism is linked to the creation of colored centers during the preparation of the film. These colored centers would trap the photoinduced free electrons leading to the coloration of the material. Several studies were carried out,28,29 and it is now well established that the blue color in WO3 arising from the photoreduction of the material is based on the transfer of electrons between tungsten ions having different valence states (W6+ and W5+) via an intervalence charge transfer (IVCT). The photo-redox process follows the next steps. When the WO3 film is irradiated with UV light, electrons (e−) and holes (h+) are generated (excitons). Then, sufficiently slow charge depletion occurs, allowing separate reactions of the initiated electrons and holes, in addition to photo-exciton recombination, which remains the main reaction. Thus, a few electrons are then trapped by some tungsten ions, leading to W5+ ion formation, and thus the IVCT phenomenon and blue coloration. IVCT is associated with the creation of an absorption site with energy corresponding to the frontier between the visible range and near infrared region, and with the blue coloration of the material.20,24 In the literature, it is often suggested that the holes would then react with the water adsorbed on the WO3 film surface to form H+ ions (water oxidation); these protons would then diffuse into the material, thus creating a tungsten bronze with the HxWO3 chemical formula. This model explains the stabilization of the reduction of a fraction of W6+ ions into W5+ ions, thanks to their association with the integration of protons inside the WO3 crystalline network. Nonetheless, the latter model is the default to explain the bleaching process when maintaining the material in the dark, which occurs like the reverse redox equation and so implies deprotonation. Although most of the studies devoted to the photochromism of WO3 agree and re-propose Deb's process, all the parameters necessary to observe the appearance of photochromism are not certain. For illustration, recent studies have shown that photochromism only appears if WO3 previously exhibits oxygen vacancies.30,31 Gérard et al. have shown that perfectly stoichiometric WO3 films have a very weak photochromic effect compared to films that are slightly deficient in oxygen.32 Other authors have shown that water must be initially chemisorbed on the film’ s surface,33 or even directly incorporated as crystalline water groups into the material such as in WO3, 0.33H2O34 to observe efficient photochromism.
With the aim to determine which parameters could lead to an improvement in the photochromic performance of WO3, a new generation of studies have focused their effort on the evaluation of many factors that can influence photochromic behavior, such as heat treatment, the presence of doping ions35 or adsorbed water.33,36 Different film preparation techniques can also lead to slight modifications in the forbidden band energy, the chemical compositions and the film microstructures, thus leading to different photochromic performances. It has also been shown that particle size plays a predominant role in the photochromism intensity. Indeed, particles of small sizes and therefore having a large specific surface have been found to be more photoreactive.37 The impact of the WO3 particle shape has also been studied: nanosheets or nanoflocons, with large specific surfaces, have good photoreactivity with a faster coloration process.28,38 The comparison of photochromic contrast obtained from the different available crystal structures of WO3: cubic, hexagonal, and monoclinic systems,36,39 has shown that the optical contrast is linked to the structural features.
In this article, to study the photochromic properties of thin films of WO3 obtained by dip-coating from suspended nanoparticles in ethanol. In the first part, the discussion focuses on the filmelaboration. In the second part, the photochromic behavior of two types of film is compared and deeply analyzed: on the one hand a WO3 pristine film, and on the other hand a sandwich film constituted by a WO3 sub-layer covered with a Ta2O5 top-layer. Finally, the last section is devoted to the reversibility aspect of the photochromism of the two mentioned films.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthetic procedures

WO3−x film elaboration. 
Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Tungsten(VI) chloride was used as the tungsten source and diethylene glycol (DEG) was used as the solvent. WCl6 (7.2 g) was added to 100 mL of DEG and 20 mL of distilled water. The mixture was heated at 180 °C with continuous stirring and refluxed for 3 h. At the end of the reaction, a deep blue precipitate was obtained. The precipitate was washed and centrifuged several times with ethanol to remove any trace of solvent and dried in an oven at 80 °C; it was then washed with HCL solution (1 mol L−1) for surface functionalization with protons. The functionalized WO3−x nanoparticles (NPs) were then dispersed in ethanol to prepare the suspensions (weight content in NPs is 86 g L−1), which were dip-coated on standard glass substrates to obtain pristine WO3−x thin films. The dip-coating parameters are: (i) dip-coating speed: 133 mm min−1 and (ii) for multilayers, successive dip coating steps operated with 30 min of drying between two steps in an oven (90 °C).


Ta2O5 film elaboration. 
Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received. Tantalum ethoxide was used as the Ta source and anhydrous ethanol was used as the solvent. The sol is obtained from tantalum ethoxide, anhydrous ethanol, 37% hydrochloric acid and distilled water. The protocol consists of preparing two separate solutions before mixing to obtain a stable sol. In solution A, 1 g of tantalum ethoxide is added to 4.92 mL of anhydrous ethanol, and stirred for 10 min. In solution B, 2.46 mL of ethanol is mixed with 0.0664 mL of distilled water and 0.01 mL of hydrochloric acid. After mixing, solution B is added, drop by drop, into solution A, and the as-prepared sol is stirred for 1 h. Once the sol is prepared, films are made by dip-coating with a deposition rate fixed at 133 mm min−1. The layers are dried after each deposition for 30 min at 90 °C. Deposition of one to four successive layers has been performed.


Ta2O5/WO3−x composite film elaboration. 
A “sandwich design” with the WO3−x film covered by Ta2O5 as a top-layer is discussed.

2.2. Characterization techniques

Chemical, structural and morphological characterization. 
The chemical composition of the as-prepared WO3−x powder can be determined thanks to chemical titration. The chemical titration was performed after dissolution of the powder in aqueous NaOH solution in the presence of KMnO4 and KI salt, dissolved in large excess with regard to the tungsten trioxide concentration. Redox processes between MnO4− and W5+ ions and then between the rest of the MnO4− and I− lead to the formation of I2 species, which can be titrated by Na2S2O3 solution in order to get the W5+ concentration, and then to deduce the oxygen sub-stoichiometry of the WO3−x compounds (x equals half the W5+ concentration).
Zeta potential, which corresponds to the potential of the particles located at the sliding plane between the Stern layer and the diffuse layer, is measured based on the electrophoretic mobility of the particles in aqueous solution with different pH values using a Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern). With the same apparatus, dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to determine the size distribution profile of the WO3−x particles in the suspensions used for the dip-coating process.
The NPs and the film structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (PANanalytical X’Pert Pro Instrument Cu Kα1 = 1.54056 Å, Kα2 = 1.54439 Å and 2θ range from 8° to 80°).
The morphology of the as-prepared films was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Quanta 3D FEG) working at 5 kV acceleration voltage. Film thickness was measured using an optical profilometer, WYCO NT1100 (Veeco).


Irradiation conditions. 
Irradiation was performed using a UV mercury-lamp (Vilbert Lourmat 8.LC) at a monochromatic wavelength of 365 nm. The sample is placed at 10 cm from 8 W tubes: the power per surface unit received by the sample is equal to 5.6 W m−2, i.e. irradiance close to UV-daylight irradiance in London. The use of such a low fluence is in order to be near the real conditions in regard to life-conditions when smart windows or smart textiles are exposed.


Optical characterization. 
Film transmission spectra were recorded at room temperature from 200 to 2500 nm on a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer using an integration sphere (spectral resolution: 1 nm and bandwidth: 2 nm).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Film elaboration

WO3−x suspensions. 
The WO3−x nanoparticles, with a pale blue color, were already described in terms of morphology, structure and chemical composition in our previous paper devoted to the comparison of the photochromic efficiencies of various WO3-type powders.40 The amount of W5+ within the raw material was determined using iodometric titration. The tests gave an average x value of 0.018, leading to the formula of the raw powder of W0.9826+W0.0365+O2.982. The structure was found to be pseudo-cubic with an a unit-cell parameter of about 3.80 Å. The particle sizes exhibit a narrow distribution centred around 4–5 nm in diameter.
Preliminary works to obtain some stable WO3−x NP suspensions were firstly conducted (Fig. 1). The suspension obtained with the particles extracted from the precipitation medium (DEG) with simple washing with ethanol sedimented very quickly. It was necessary to develop a strategy for the preparation of a more stable suspension. First, the determination of the isoelectric point of the WO3−x particles was performed. Zeta potential values of the particles obtained as a function of pH of the aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 1a. The isoelectric point of our particles is at a very acidic pH of 1.5, as already listed in the literature.41,42 Note that this can be interpreted as a characteristic of a particle surface very rich in cations (W6+ and W5+); the surface therefore has a very clear tendency for hydroxylation at the expense of protonation. The cation-rich surfaces show good agreement with the WO3−x oxygen-deficient stoichiometry: a segregation of the oxygen vacancies at the surface may also be considered. Furthermore, zeta measurements show that the particles sediment easily for suspensions of pH between 1 and 2.2 (generally, a suspension is said to be stable when the potential, in absolute value, is greater than 20 mV); the suspension was stable for pH between 2.2 and 6. In this range, the particles exhibit negatively-charged surfaces due to the formation of dangling bonds between the surface tungsten ions and OH− hydroxyl groups. For pH values higher than 5–6, the particles gradually dissolved; the paradoxical rise in surface potential between pH 4 and 6 (the surface charge becomes less negative) can be seen as a precursory sign of this dissolution, with a transformation of the nature of the dispersed particles from tungsten oxides to tungsten hydroxides. This measurement in aqueous solution allowed us to develop a protocol for the stabilization of our particle suspensions in ethanol. Once the ethanol washes were carried out, the particles were washed two additional times with distilled water, the goal being to negatively charge the surface of our particles (hydroxyl group fixation). The particles were subsequently re-suspended in ethanol. The final suspension obtained is blue and much more stable against sedimentation, even over long periods of time (more than 4 weeks). In order to illustrate the influence of such a hydroxyl functionalization of the WO3−x NP surfaces on the particles, a quasi-elastic light scattering (DLS) measurement was performed on two suspensions, respectively, with particles that are water-washed and not water-washed (results reported in Fig. 1b).

WO3−x film elaboration. 
The WO3−x films are prepared from an 86 g L−1 suspension with hydroxylated particles. The photographs and transmission spectra show that the films from the modified suspension present a good visible transmission with a low scattering coefficient (Fig. 2a). In the near infrared region, the transmission at 1200 nm varies from 80% for a 1-layer film to 62% for a 6-layer film (1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-layer films were studied). For the 3-layer film, a distinct absorption band appears centred at 1200 nm; this absorption band is linked to the presence of W5+ ions due to the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) between W5+ and W6+ ions in the structural network of the WO3−x particles. As photochromism is related to an increase of these IVCT bands, the thickness achieved by the 3-layer coating is enough to carry out photochromism studies. The thickness measurements performed with an optical profilometer allow assessing the thickness evolution of the films versus the number of successive coatings. The thickness variation is nearly linear with the number of deposited layers (Fig. 2b). The SEM images of our coatings (top views), reported in Fig. 3, show that the surface of the films has an adequate density; however, the presence of cracks, in particular on the 6-layer film, is evidenced.

Ta2O5 film elaboration. 
The films obtained from 1 to 4 successive coatings of Ta2O5 sols were characterized with the same procedures as that of the WO3−x films, i.e. by using transmission spectra, photographs, thickness measurements and SEM (top views) images. X-ray diffraction shows no diffraction peaks, as the Ta2O5 films are amorphous.
The transmission spectra (Fig. 4a) show that the four films studied are transparent with transmission in the visible range of more than 80%, even with an increase in the number of successive deposits. In addition, the appearance of interference fringes (with a single very wide fringe for films from one or two successive deposits and two clearly visible fringes for films from three or four deposits) is also a sign that the surface of the films is very smooth and the film thicknesses are very regular. Indeed, the interference fringes only appear when the film roughness is low, and the thickness is regular enough to allow consistent interference between the multiple reflections appearing at different film/air interfaces. The thickness evolution versus the number of successive deposits is roughly linear (Fig. 4b), and SEM image resolution is not sufficient to evidence any defects (cracks or roughness): the films are smooth and crack-free.
 Fig. 4  (a) Transmission spectra and photographs of Ta2O3−x films, (b) evolution of the thickness of the films according to the number of layers, and (c) illustration of the Swanepoel plot for the evaluation of the refractive index. 
From these data and using the method proposed by Swanepoel43 (illustrated in Fig. 4c), it is possible to estimate the value of the refractive index of the film of Ta2O5 from the envelope, which includes the interference fringes, i.e. from the tm minimal and TM maximal transmission values in the interference regime and the substrate index from equations:n = (N + (N2 − ns2)1/2)1/2 (nS = 1.52)with N = 2 × ns × (TM − tm)/(TM × tm) + (ns2 + 1)/2.
Thus, the effective refractive index of the Ta2O5 film can be estimated to be 1.9 (at a wavelength of 600 nm). With regard to the theoretical refractive index of tantalum oxide: 2.23,44 the estimated effective refractive index indicates that quite dense films are obtained, with about 15–20% porosity (considering that the effective index can be calculated as a mixing law of porosity and Ta2O5 particle linear susceptibilities).


WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film elaboration. 
The method chosen to make composite films is to prepare “sandwich-type” films, i.e. on a 1- to 6-layer WO3−x film, a single top-layer of Ta2O5 is then coated. The idea is to fill surface defects of the WO3−x films with the Ta2O5 additional layer, in order to limit the film scattering phenomenon, thanks to the proximity of the refractive indices of these two compounds. In addition, the top layer of tantalum oxide also constitutes a protective layer of the film of tungsten oxide particles (particularly regarding oxidative attack: hydration, from the outside medium).
From the transmission spectra (Fig. 5a), several elements deserve discussion. The good transparency in the visible area of the films, already demonstrated by the photographs of these films, is confirmed by the transmission spectra. The appearance of interference fringes, implying a multireflection effect within the film, indicates that the optical quality (roughness) of the film surface is greatly improved by adding the Ta2O5 layer. Moreover, the absorption band relative to the presence of W5+ ions (IVCT), centred at 1200 nm, is now visible for films made using successive deposition steps greater than 3 layers. Analysis of the surface of the films by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 5b) also shows that the surface roughness of the films is improved by the additional layer of Ta2O5 oxide.
 Fig. 5  (a) Transmission spectra and (inset) photographs of WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite films, and (b) SEM pictures of the films. 
Nonetheless, a significant roughness and small cracks linked to the tungsten oxide bottom layer (especially visible in high magnification images) remain visible. For less than 2 successive coatings of tungsten oxide, the cracks are no longer visible. On the other side, there is also de-adhesion of the films from the substrate for films obtained using 5 and 6 successive coatings of tungsten oxide. This delamination phenomenon can be linked to a higher chemical affinity of the WO3−x layer with Ta2O5 than with the silica glass substrate. Constraints created during gelation of the Ta2O5 top-layer (during the sol–gel transition) can spread to the interface between the WO3−x film and the substrate. Recent studies performed in our laboratory have shown that this delamination can be prevented by depositing as a first primer, a layer of Ta2O5. Such a Ta2O5/WO3−x/Ta2O5 architecture remains under investigations. In the following, the 4-layer WO3−x obtained with the Ta2O5 top-layer, representing a good compromise between a strong IVCT absorption and low scattering, will be studied.

3.2. Photochromic properties

Photoinduced colouring of the WO3−x film. 
The photochromic study firstly focused on the 4-layer WO3−x pristine film for which the IVCT in the near infrared region is already visible before irradiation. The film was subjected to different irradiation durations (cumulated) (Fig. 6a).
 Fig. 6  Evolution of (a) the transmission of the WO3−x film coated on a glass substrate and (b) the absorbance of the WO3−x film during irradiation. (c) De-summation of the absorbance spectrum of the WO3−x film by three Gaussian curves (for 2 h 30 min of irradiation). 
We notice firstly that the irradiation makes the film “react” in the visible and near-infrared ranges with higher reactivity in the near-infrared region. Nevertheless, the absorption of a part of the red light under irradiation produces a pale blue coloration of the films. This strongly suggests a significant increase of W5+ ions. The photo-redox process is herein the origin of a “huge photochromic phenomenon” for such a thin film with regard to the literature devoted to WO3 photochromism. Indeed, an important increase of the absorption at 1200 nm (1 eV) with a loss of more than 8% of transmission after only 10 seconds of irradiation is observed (when this decrease is only 0.25% at 600 nm (2 eV), showing a poor photochromism in the visible range). Similarly, after 2.5 hours of irradiation, the transmission decreased by 62% at 1200 nm.
Considering the initial absorbance of the film as the reference, the transmission curves were converted in relative gained absorption of the WO3−x film (Fig. 6b). This conversion of the transmission of the film–substrate sandwich into the selective absorption of the film allows a de-summation with a Gaussian peak of the large absorption IVCT band (Fig. 6c).
To try to assign each phenomenon to a specific region of the spectrum, we have de-summed the spectra with Gaussians to determine the number of phenomena involved in the photochromism of WO3−x films. For this de-summation, data are plotted vs. energy, then treated between 0.62 eV and 2 eV (2000–620 nm) to include the whole part of the spectrum reacting to UV radiation. The absorption bands are simulated by a Gaussian according to the following relation:y = A × exp{−1/2 × [(x − xc)/w]2},where y is the absorbance, A is the magnitude of a Gaussian contribution in absorbance units, x is the energy in eV, xc is the position of the Gaussian curve in energy, and w is the width of the Gaussian curve in energy. To obtain a satisfactory simulation, i.e. a fit of the experimental absorbance envelope with a low reliability factor, three Gaussian curves, partially convoluted, must be used. The 3 Gaussians have the following positions (see Table 1): the main one (Gaussian curve #1) is centred at 1.14 eV (1090 nm); this main peak is surrounded by two satellite signals, located respectively at lower energy, around 0.78 eV (1600 nm), and at higher energy, around 1.53 eV (810 nm). The hypothesis put forward to justify the consideration of 3 Gaussians is difficult to definitively establish. To the best of our knowledge, no report of such a deep investigation can be found in the literature. The partial convolution of three absorption bands means three different absorption phenomena. The absorption can come from polaronic transfers (IVCT band), but also from the formation of an electronic gas (plasmonic band linked to Drude's theory). Here, the appearance of the high energy component (band located on 1.5 eV) potentially could be attributed to a plasmonic effect related to the appearance of free electrons. The existence of the other two sub-bands can be attributed to two different polaronic transfers. One may propose that these two bands correspond respectively to bulk and surface polaronic transfers (nonetheless, they can be also related to a polaronic transfer involving W5+ neighbouring oxygen vacancies getting a specific energy).

The magnitude A of these bands roughly evolves versus irradiation time with quite the same kinetics. Nonetheless, some slight differences, especially for Gaussian curve #3, which evolves with a lower kinetics than the two other ones, explain the slight blue shift of the maximum of the absorption envelope versus the irradiation time. Thereafter, the plot of the evolution of the absorbance at 1 eV (1200 nm), i.e. corresponding to the central position of the complex absorption phenomenon appearing under irradiation, is used to investigate more accurately the photo-redox kinetics. It can be noted that for all the kinetic studies that will follow, the choice to work on absorbance spectra rather than transmission spectra is justified by the fact that the absorbance phenomenon is directly related to the concentrations of the chromophoric species.
Overall, absorbance seems to be changing rapidly in the first minutes of irradiation, then it seems to slow down after a few tens of minutes until it almost no longer evolves after 2 hours. From a macroscopic point of view, the evolution in terms of amplitude of the photoinduced absorbance signal shows an asymptotic evolution. To go further, the absorbance evolution at 1 eV versus the irradiation time is depicted on Fig. 7. The experimental plot has been fitted by trend curves (considering a combination of two 1st order kinetic laws), according to the equation:y = A1 × [1 − exp(−t/k1)] + A2 × [1 − exp(−t/k2)],with two characteristic times (k1 and k2) associated with phenomena that each have their own amplitude (A1 and A2).
 Fig. 7  Absorbance evolution at 1 eV (1200 nm) during irradiation. 

Table 2 summarizes the four working parameters (A1, k1, A2, and k2). The evolution is composed of a fast-kinetic answer (k2 is about a minute) and a slow-kinetic answer (k1, of predominant impact for long irradiation times, is about one hour). The fast and the slow phenomena have roughly the same amplitude (A1 and A2 are around 0.3 in absorbance units). For the energy considered (1 eV), the k2 parameter monitors mainly the answer of the material during the first minutes of irradiation and is significantly smaller than the parameter k1. The independent plots of each fast-kinetic and slow-kinetic exponential contribution allow the schematization of this complex kinetics: the pink curve is associated with the (A2, k2) exponential; it increases very quickly in the first few seconds and then stabilizes after a period of 5–10 minutes of irradiation. The blue plot for the (A1, k1) exponential continues to increase even for a long time of irradiation; this 2nd phenomenon does not reach saturation (asymptotic value) even after 150 hours.

These two different evolutions (fast- and slow-kinetics) can be associated to two different photochromic phenomena: during the first few minutes, a very pronounced reaction from the surface of the film (the charge transfer being the rate-limiting step), and for longer times, a reaction rate limited by the cationic renewal of the WO3 particle surfaces (kinetics of a diffusional nature). Indeed, the quick photoreduction of surface cationic species (photoreduction from W6+ to W5+ ions) would saturate with the increase of the W5+ surface concentration; to go further, the surface must “desaturate” by ionic diffusion of the W5+ surface ions towards the bulk, which leads to a slower reaction speed. The photo-redox reaction proceeding thus with two reaction speeds is depicted in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  Simplified scheme of the photoreduction of tungsten ions associated with photochromism. 
It can be seen that by taking into account a very simplified model with two cations on the surface and two cations in the material bulk, different phenomena can occur during the irradiation to produce a photo-redox reaction with the reduction of the two W6+ ions and charge migration to the bulk. Finally, the observation of equivalent amplitudes for the two phenomena (fast and slow) supports their attribution to bulk and surface. Indeed, particles of 5 nm diameter like those constituting the as-prepared films have roughly 50% of their ions located on the surface.


Photoinduced colouring of the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film. 
The photochromic study has then focused on the 4-layer WO3−x covered by a Ta2O5 top-coat to evaluate the impact of the tantalum oxide top-layer on the photochromic effect. Indeed, this quite dense and glassy film could act like a barrier and prevent the participation of atmospheric water molecules in the photo-redox reaction associated with the photochromism.
Using the same irradiation conditions and source, the same investigations as for the pristine WO3−x films were carried out on the composite films: transmission versus irradiation, absorbance versus irradiation time and de-summation of the absorbance bands are reported in Fig. 9.

We notice that the composite film reacts in the near infrared region but less markedly than the pristine WO3−x film. In fact, after 2 hours of irradiation, the maximal decrease in transmission at 1200 nm is only 28% as compared to the 62% drop observed in the case of the WO3−x film alone. Similarly, the film reacts very little in the visible range, and the film is not coloured by the radiation. It seems that the phenomenon at high energy (which was attributed to the creation of an electron gas: plasmonic: Gaussian curve #3) is not observed when adding the Ta2O5 top layer. This phenomenon is probably causally linked to the lower amplitude of the photochromic effect: the concentration of free carriers (or W5+ ions) remains probably insufficient to enable the creation of a free electron gas. As previously performed for the pristine WO3−x film, the spectra were de-summed in the range of 2000–620 nm (0.62–2 eV). The de-summation of the transmission spectra allows the determination of the number of convoluted Gaussians and therefore the number of photoinduced chromophores present in the composite film for the sandwich configuration. Only two Gaussian curves are necessary; the Gaussian curve parameters are reported in Table 3.

Adding a layer of Ta2O5 on the surface of the WO3−x film well limits the amount of photo-reduced tungsten VI ions. The Ta2O5 film being transparent to the irradiation lengths, it has, a priori, no effect on the creation of the concentration of exciton pairs in the tungsten oxide semiconductor. Therefore, the addition of a Ta2O5 surface film could limit charge depletion (between valence band h+ holes and conductive band free e−s) and act in favour of the exciton rapid recombination (thus, the photochromic effect is decreased). The photoreduction of W6+ to W5+ ions on one side, and/or the oxidation, which is necessary to loop the redox process on the other side, are partially impeded. We believe that the top-layer contribution acts on this latter oxidation step: either in avoiding hole recombination with the air water molecules (based on Deb's mechanism), or in avoiding the surface O2− anion departure in the form of dioxygen (which we assume to be the half-oxidation to compensate for tungsten photoreduction; tests have shown that the humidity of the surrounding atmosphere is of a negligible impact).
Moreover, the kinetics of the photochromic phenomenon was also investigated; the absorbance evolution at 1 eV versus the irradiation duration is depicted in Fig. 10.
 Fig. 10  Absorbance evolution of WO3−x/Ta2O5 film during irradiation at 1 eV (1200 nm). 
As compared to the previous results obtained for the WO3−x pristine films, the main new phenomenon to note for the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite films is the increase of the absorption up to 25 minutes of irradiation followed by its gradual decrease after 45 minutes. This overly complex kinetics cannot be fitted considering the standard exponential law. The bleaching effect occurring for a long irradiation time, acting as a “negative photochromic effect”, has never been reported, to the best of our knowledge, in the literature devoted to the photochromism of inorganic oxides. This negative photochromism can be explained by the re-oxidation of the tungsten ions (W5+ to W6+ oxidation) from an anionic diffusion coming from the Ta2O5 film. Indeed, Ta2O5 would behave as a potential source of O2− anions, which facilitates the reoxidation of WO3−x films.


Bleaching and cycling. 
After studying the colouring behaviour of the film as a function of duration of irradiation, we investigated its reversibility. Data from the literature report that the reversibility kinetics is very slow when the product is only left in a dark environment to relax and it is often necessary to heat the film at 80–100 °C in air or under ozone to obtain a complete relaxation.20,27,45 Herein, the pristine or composite films were previously irradiated for 2 hours (slightly beyond saturation time) at room temperature and left in the dark for self-bleaching directly in the spectrometer chamber in order to record the evolution of the transmission spectra: an analysis was automatically performed every hour. The calculated absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. 11 and 12, respectively, for the WO3−x pristine film and the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film.

 Fig. 12  (a) Bleaching of the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film versus time in the dark and (b) corresponding absorbance evolution at 1 eV. 
The time necessary for a total return seems very long (out of the investigated time domain); the gap between the spectrum obtained after 16 hours in the darken and the spectrum of the initial state is still important: the maximal absorption after 16 hours in the darken at around 1200 nm is equal to about 0.3 and 0.2 for the WO3−x pristine film and the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film, respectively. The absorbance evolution at 1 eV (1200 nm) versus darkening time is plotted in Fig. 11b and the variation of the absorbance has been simulated using the following equation: y = A1′ × exp(−t/k1′) + A2′ × exp(−t/k2′), i.e. considering as for the colouring effect under irradiation, a double kinetics (slow- vs. fast-process) for the bleaching process. Fitting parameters are reported in Table 4.

The trends of the two plots and so for the extracted kinetic parameters for the WO3−x pristine film and the WO3−x/Ta2O5 composite film are very similar. Indeed, for both films, the parameters k2′ and k1′ corresponding to the relaxation rates of the fast- and slow-bleaching processes are about 3–5 hours for the fast relaxation and of the order of one day (20–22 hours) for the slow phenomenon. Also, the ratio between fast and slow phenomenon amplitude: the A2′/A1′ ratio, is about 1/3 in both cases. The time necessary for the film to return to its initial state is, however, very long, but the quality of the fit with a bleaching equation as a convolution of two decreasing exponential terms shows that 100% bleaching is predicted (i.e. no positive value as a final asymptotic point has to be taken into consideration in our kinetic equation). The phenomenon of re-oxidation of W5+ to W6+ by the oxygen in the air is therefore very slow (k times of a few hours) compared to photoreduction of W6+ to W5+ under UV irradiation (k times of a few minutes). Furthermore, the occurrence of slow and fast-colouring processes has been previously interpreted by a fast charge transfer circumscribed to the film surface followed by surface renewal from ionic diffusion (slow process). Logically, the re-oxidation should follow the same pathways with a rapid process involving the W5+ ions located on the film surface followed by a slow process dealing with W5+ species initially located in the bulk progressively diffusing to the surface before being re-oxidized.
Finally, cycling tests were carried out on the WO3−x pristine film (Fig. 13). Several irradiation steps were applied (2 hours irradiation, allowing the colouring process to saturate), with sufficient time in the dark in between two successive irradiation steps to let the compound fully self-bleach (allowing the film to return to its “initial” state between each irradiation step). The relaxation time between the first and the second cycle was fixed at 72 h, and 120 h was necessary between the second and the third irradiation.
 Fig. 13  Absorbance variation at 1 eV after several hours without irradiation; study completed on 3 different cycles. 
For the 3 first cycles, the absorbance at 1 eV (1200 nm) was recorded during the 12 hours following the colouring saturation under irradiation only. The cycling study demonstrates that the shapes of the bleaching curves of the first, the second, and the third cycle are all almost identical. These results show the good performance, in terms of stability, of the film during successive cycles (colouring under irradiation + bleaching in the dark).

4. Conclusions
The significant photochromic properties of WO3−x films obtained by dip-coating from solutions of suspended non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide nanopowder synthetized by a polyol chemical route have been investigated. The kinetics of the photochromism was studied. Several phenomena are responsible for two distinct kinetics of photochromism, the photoreduction of W6+ ions at the particle surface leading to intervalence charge transfer and the diffusion of the W5+ species within the bulk of the particles. The deposition of a layer of tantalum oxide on the WO3−x films decreases the photochromic effect. In this latter case, the top layer is proposed to limit hole recombination with air water molecules or surface O2− anion departure. The cycling effect has also been demonstrated. This study opens the door to possible applications of non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide in smart windows or in smart textiles, which could progressively be coloured during the day due to day-light irradiation and self-bleached during the night or during a certain rest period in our cupboards.
