    , Accepted 6th July 2020First published on 7th July 2020AbstractFor the future development of environmentally friendly and sustainable electrode materials, herein, novel orthorhombic vanadium pentoxide@carbon composites (V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS) were synthesized via a green solvothermal process. According to the SEM and TEM analysis, the vanadium pentoxide@carbon (V2O5@C) composites exhibited a flower-like morphology with a few agglomerated nanoflakes located on their surface. The incorporation of carbon in the V2O5 matrix was established based on the element distribution mapping images, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and XPS. The V2O5@C–R2HS composite presented the smallest thickness (40 nm) of the flower-like morphology and the highest content of carbon and V5+ ions. The electrochemical performance of all the electrode materials was studied in a three-electrode configuration using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The V2O5@C–R2HS composite electrode displayed the best electrochemical performance compared to that of the V2O5@C–WHS and V2O5@C–R1HS composites. The two-electrode configuration was evaluated using the V2O5@C–R2HS composite as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode to fabricate an asymmetric device (V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC). The V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC device presented a specific energy and associated specific power of 33.4 W h kg−1 and 670 W kg−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1 and voltage of 1.6 V. The asymmetric cell showed excellent cycling stability of 98.9% coulombic efficiency and 88% capacity retention during a large number of cycles (25000). Thus, the present study confirms that this novel green V2O5@C–R2HS composite exhibits a superior performance as a positive electrode for future sustainable supercapacitors.
1. Introduction
The rapid increase in the demand for energy has resulted in the development of technologies. Therefore, it is crucial to produce, convert and store energy efficiently, adequately and sustainably to secure the socio-economic development of society.1 Renewable energy sources such as wind and sun are driving the need for superior and sustainable energy technologies.2 For efficient energy harnessing, batteries and supercapacitors are deemed efficient storage components.3 However, considering the differences in energy generation from these sources (solar and wind) and that they depend on weather conditions, energy storage systems are required to play a crucial role in preserving the excess energy for use when the sun and wind are not available.4 Although renewable energy resources (i.e., photovoltaics, wind turbines, and geothermal heat) have displayed great potential to be employed as alternative energy sources to fossil fuels globally, their success is still limited.5 In addition, their inability to store harvested energy and quickly transmit it have their utilization even more challenging. Thus, the market for energy storage applications, especially in developing countries, has become an integrated critical component in clean energy development and sustainability. Electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrochemical capacitors, batteries and redox flow cells have shown immense potential for energy conversion and storage, and are expected to bridge the gap between energy supply and demand, which arises with the irregularity in renewable energy generation technologies.6
In comparison, electrochemical supercapacitors (ESs) can deliver a higher specific energy than conventional capacitors and higher specific power than batteries and fuel cells.7 Furthermore, ESs have a charge–discharge capability ranging up to a million times8 and high energy efficiency.9,10 However, electrochemical supercapacitors have a major hurdle, which is their low specific energy values compared to batteries and fuel cells.11 Supercapacitors are classified into two main types (I and II) considering their energy storage mechanism: (I) electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC) arising from the accumulation of charges at the electrode/electrolyte interface.12 Typically, EDLC-type materials are carbon-based materials. These materials provide a large-surface area with excellent chemical stability and thin electrolytic dielectrics to achieve a reasonable capacitance.13 (II) Faradaic capacitors, which store energy through fast redox reactions, where the common materials adopted in this type of capacitor are transition metal oxide and hydroxides (TMOs/TM-OHs) and redox polymers.14,15 The TMOs-based electrodes materials in SCs display high specific capacity due to their ability to exhibit different oxidations states.16
Among the range of low-cost metal oxides, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has been shown to be a great candidate electrode for SCs.17,18 This vanadium oxide has good electrochemical properties including high specific capacity, unique layered structures, and different oxidation states (ranging from 2+ to 5+); however, it has low electrical conductivity and poor cyclic stability.19,20 Thus, to overcome these drawbacks of V2O5, some studies have been established by incorporating carbon elements into the V2O5 matrix to form composite materials using graphene, carbon nanotubes and nanofibers.21–23 For instance, Liu et al.24 Synthesized V2O5 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites using a solvothermal process with annealing treatment. Their study showed the effect of introducing graphene greatly improved the electrochemical performance of the V2O5 nanostructure24 using the solvothermal route. Carbon-based nanomaterials are commonly produced from commercially available precursors such as methane, toluene and acetylene.25 However, compared to these precursors, biomass materials have been considered as suitable sources of carbon since they are cheap and readily available. Recently, different flowers have been used to generate activated carbon electrode materials in SCs such as Borassus aethiopum,26 coconut trees,27Albizia flowers,28Paulownia,29 and Couroupita guianensis30 due to their noteworthy role in environmental protection, economic growth and daily life.31
Besides dry matter, liquid extracts from biomass can also be employed as green sources of not only carbon but also metal ions. However, it should be noted that the generation of metal oxide nanoparticles using flower extracts is still in its infancy. Recently, Kundu et al.32 successfully synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO-NPs) using Hydrangea paniculata flower extracts. The electrochemical performance of the NiO-NPs exhibited a specific capacitance of 752 F g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1 with good cycling stability up to 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. They concluded that the extract of the Hydrangea paniculata flower played a crucial role in enhancing the electrochemical performance of the NiO-NPs.32
Among the natural flowers, Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS), also called roselle, is mainly composed of organic and phenolic acids (citric acid, hydroxycitric acid and hibiscus acid).33–36 The high number of anthocyanins, phenolic and antioxidants in HS flowers play a unique role in the color of this plant, which can be categorized into three different varieties designated traditionally as white, dark and light red. Several studies presented a comparison of these three varieties, where the dark red Hibiscus sabdariffa (R2HS) displayed a superior percentage of anthocyanins, phenolic, and antioxidants than the light-red Hibiscus sabdariffa (R1HS), while the white Hibiscus sabdariffa (WHS) lacks anthocyanins.37–39 The anthocyanin in the dark and light red HS is composed of cyanidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, and delphinidin-3-sambubioside.40–42 These major bioactive components of the anthocyanins are presented in Fig. 1.42
 Fig. 1  Structure of the major bioactive molecular compound anthocyanins within the HS flowers.42 
The anthocyanins, phenolic, and antioxidant compounds of this organic acid are a great source of carbon, which can be incorporated into a metal oxide matrix to form sustainable and eco-friendly metal oxide/carbon composite electrode materials. This incorporation can improve the conductivity and cyclic stability of the pure metal oxide materials. Accordingly, the development of metal oxide@carbon-based composites (MxOy@C) derived from natural extracts as electrode materials for supercapacitors is an important niche that needs to be investigated.
Therefore, in this study, novel orthorhombic vanadium pentoxide@carbon composites (V2O5@–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS) were successfully prepared using a green process from the natural Hibiscus sabdariffa family. This green solvothermal method has the ability to control the crystal size, shape distribution and crystal structure of all the vanadium pentoxide@carbon composites43,44 at a moderate temperature. According to the SEM and TEM analyses, all the V2O5@C composite materials displayed flower-like morphologies with a few agglomerated nanoflakes on the surface of the V2O5@C–R2HS composite. The element distribution mapping images, FTIR spectroscopy and XPS confirmed the presence of carbon in the V2O5 matrix. The electrochemical performance of all the composite electrodes was evaluated in a three-electrode configuration using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The V2O5@C–R2HS composite exhibited the highest electrochemical performance compared to that of the V2O5@C–WHS and V2O5@C–R1HS composites. Thus, it was further used as a positive electrode in the assembly of an asymmetric device with a carbon-based negative electrode (activated carbon) at a voltage of 1.6 V. The V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC device presented a specific energy and specific power density of 33.4 W h kg−1 and 670 W kg−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1. The asymmetric cell showed excellent stability of 88% capacity retention up to 25000 cycles.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Green synthesis of vanadium pentoxide@carbon composites
A green solvothermal route was used to synthesize the V2O5@C composites. Firstly, the leaves of the white Hibiscus sabdariffa (WHS) were collected from Senegal and dried under direct sunlight. Then, the dried leaves of WHS were crunched into a fine powder. 1 g of this powder was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water (DI) for 24 h at room temperature to ensure maximum extraction of the bioactive compounds. Thereafter, the resulting solution was filtered to remove the solid residual leaves of WHS, as presented in Scheme 1. The pH of the solution of Hibiscus sabdariffa was 2.05.

Secondly, 3 g of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was placed in a quartz tube furnace and heated to 450 °C in air for 2 h at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 to obtain an orange-red color powder, as shown in Scheme 2.45

Scheme 3 presents the final step of the procedure, where 0.5 g of the orange-red powder was dissolved in 20 mL of the extract solution and 20 mL of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was added. The solution was stirred for 10 min in an ice bath. Subsequently, 2 g of oxalic acid was added and stirred for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous solution, and then transferred to a sealed 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 24 h. Consequently, the obtained greenish black colored gel was centrifuged and washed with water and ethanol before drying at 60 °C for 18 h. The final product was labelled as V2O5@C–WHS composite. The same procedure was adopted for the synthesis of the V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composites using different extracts from the family of Hibiscus sabdariffa. The acidic pH of the light red (R1HS) and dark red (R2HS) extracts was 2.05 and 2.09, respectively.

For comparison, vanadium pentoxide was prepared without the addition of dye extract (see details in the ESI†).
2.2 Synthesis of activated carbon (AC)
The activated carbon (AC) was prepared through the conventional in situ chemical activation using peanut shell waste as the raw material and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as the active agent. Briefly, AC was prepared via carbonization followed by activation and heated to 850 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under an argon (Ar) flow rate of 250 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) before being kept at that temperature for 1 h. The detailed description of AC was recently presented in our work reported by Sylla et al.46
2.3 Structural, morphological, and textural characterization
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) of the powder of the Hibiscus sabdariffa (WHS, R1HS and R2HS) family was analyzed using a Thermo Fisher ARL Perform'X Sequential XRF instrument with the Uniquant software. The morphology and element distribution mapping of the synthesized composite materials were characterized using a high-resolution Zeiss Ultra Plus 55 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operated at a working voltage of 2.0 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV (Akishima-shi, Japan). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the V2O5 materials prepared with the different Hibiscus sabdariffa flowers were collected using a diffractometer (Brucker D8 Advance) with the theta/2theta geometry, operating with a Cu X-ray source (Kα, 1.5418 Å) at 2θ values in the range of 10°–80°. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a WITec confocal Raman microscope (WITec alpha300 R, Ulm Germany) operating with a laser wavelength of 532 nm at a 5 mW emitting power to minimize the heating effect. Fourier transformation infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded on a Vertex 70v (Bruker) spectrometer in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 with resolution of 4 cm−1 and analyzed with the Opus software. The specific surface area (SSA) of the V2O5@C composite materials was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method in the relative pressure range (P/P0) of 0.01–1.0. The pore size distribution was obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method and density functional theory (DFT) pore size distribution data. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha, Thermo Fisher) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source was used to irradiate the material surface to determine their surface chemistry.
2.4 Electrode preparation and electrochemical characterization
The V2O5–WHS, V2O5–R1HS, V2O5–R2HS and AC electrodes were fabricated by mixing 80% of the active material, 10% carbon black as a conducting additive and 10% polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as a binder. Thereafter, a few drops of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent was dispersed in the mixture to form a homogeneous slurry, which was coated on a pre-annealed nickel foam (NF) substrate with an area of 1 × 1 cm2 and dried at 60 °C overnight for the complete evaporation of the solvent. For a good comparison, the mass of each electrode material was kept at approximately 0.003 g.
The electrochemical performance was analyzed in a three- and two-electrode system using a Bio-Logic VMP-300 potentiostat (Knoxville TN 37,930, USA) driven by the EC-lab software. An Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl saturated) reference electrode and glassy carbon as the counter electrode were used in the three-electrode (half-cell) system with the active materials as the working electrode to complete the testing circuit. The half-cell configuration was used to indicate the electrode performance for optimization of the V2O5@C composites using the Hibiscus sabdariffa family as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode for the fabrication of an asymmetric cell. The device was assembled using a Swagelok cell with a microfiber glass filter paper as the separator of the two electrode materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to determine the behavior of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS, V2O5@C–R2HS and AC electrodes and their stable working potential in the three- and two system cells. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements were performed to calculate the specific capacity and test the stability of the electrode materials.
Both the CV and GCD measurements were carried out in a cell potential range of 0.0 to 1.6 V. The CV curve was tested at a scan rate of 5 to 1500 mV s−1, while the GCD plot was performed at a specific current in the range of 1 to 10 A g−1.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also performed to investigate the capacitive properties of the V2O5@C composite and AC electrodes in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at open circuit voltage. All the electrochemical tests were performed in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at room temperature. Based on the different GCD curves of the V2O5@C–R2HS and AC electrodes, the specific capacity, Q (mA h g−1), was calculated using eqn (1) as follows:23 (1)where Id is the gravimetric specific current in A g−1, tD is the discharge time (s), and Q is the specific capacity (mA h g−1).
The charge equilibrium was used to balance the masses of both electrode materials in the asymmetric cell. This generated eqn (2) and (3), which were used to balance the masses: QV2O5@C–R2HS = QAC(2) (3)where mV2O5@C–R2HS and mAC are the mass loading of the positive and negative electrodes, QV2O5@C–R2HS and QAC are the specific capacities of the V2O5@C–R2HS and AC electrodes, respectively, Id is the specific current and tD is the discharge time.
The mass ratio of the V2O5@C–R2HS and AC electrodes at the same specific current is: (4)
According to eqn (4), the masses of the V2O5@C–R2HS and AC electrodes were considered to be approximatively 0.004 and 0.0017 g, respectively, which gave a total mass of 0.0057 g.
The specific energy (Ed) and specific power (Pd) of the asymmetric device were calculated using eqn (5) and (6): (5) (6)where V is the potential window (V), and m is the total mass (mg) of the positive and negative electrode of V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological, structural, and textural characterization
The X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) analysis was used to determine the elemental composition of the powder of the natural Hibiscus sabdariffa flowers. Table 1 shows the major elements present in the white Hibiscus sabdariffa (WHS), light red Hibiscus sabdariffa (R1HS) and dark red Hibiscus sabdariffa (R2HS) flower powders. A considerable percentage of silicon (Si), aluminium (Al), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) was observed in all the natural powders with the most prominent organic chemical composition of 93.99%, 94.48% and 95.30% for R2HS, R1HS and WHS, respectively. This high organic chemical composition confirmed the nature of the WHS, R1HS and R2HS flowers of the Malvaceae family.

The morphology analysis of the powders of the different natural Hibiscus sabdariffa flowers (WHS, R1HS and R2HS) were studied and presented in Fig. 2. The SEM images of the different natural Hibiscus sabdariffa powders display an interconnected nanoflake network-like morphology.47

Fig. S1 (ESI)† displays the SEM images of the V2O5–DI powder obtained with deionized water as the solvent instead of the extract of the natural Hibiscus sabdariffa flowers. The morphologies of these samples reveal spindle-like shapes with some small nanoflakes on the surface of the nanostructures.
Fig. S2 (ESI)† presents the SEM images of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composites obtained with the extract of the natural Hibiscus sabdariffa flowers as the solvent without the addition of H2O2 in the preparation step. The surface SEM images reveal a nanosheet-like morphology.
These nanosheet structures of THE V2O5@C composites, which adopted their morphology from the nanoflake-like morphology of the natural Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts, showed a stacked structure. Upon the addition of H2O2, the resulting V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composites exhibited a flower-like morphology, as seen in Fig. 3. The micrographs in Fig. 3 reveal the formation of thin nanosheets in the V2O5@C composites, which further presented a flower-like structure when H2O2 was added during the synthetic procedure. The nanosheet-like morphologies of the V2O5@C composites originate from the assembly of the nanoflakes of the Hibiscus sabdariffa powders. It appears that all the samples exhibited nanosheets assembled to give a flower-like architecture when H2O2 was added. Specifically, the flower-like structure can be attributed to the exfoliation effect of H2O2. Fig. 3(a and b) show the SEM images of the V2O5@C composites prepared with the white natural Hibiscus sabdariffa with added H2O2. The surface of V2O5@C–WHS exhibited the presence of assembled nanoflakes, which originate from the natural dye, with an approximate thickness of 45 nm. The morphology of the V2O5@C–R1HS composite presented in Fig. 3(c and d) displays a rough surface with the highest assembly of short nanoflake-like structures and a thickness of 43 nm. Meanwhile, for the V2O5@C–R2HS composite, as presented in Fig. 3(e and f), a well-defined flower-like structure was observed with the smallest assembly of nanoflakes on the surface with a thickness of 40 nm. The slight difference in the surface morphology for the V2O5@C composites can be attributed the effect of the different natural extracts from Hibiscus sabdariffa.

The scanning electron microscopy-element distribution mapping of all the V2O5@C composite materials was performed to evaluate their elemental composition. Fig. 4 displays the mapping images of the V2O5@C composites, which show the presence of vanadium (V), oxygen (O) and carbon (C) atoms in all the as-synthesized materials. Thus, Fig. 4 confirms the presence of carbon atoms in the as-prepared V2O5@C materials. The mapping results, as shown in Fig. 4(a–i) clearly indicate that all the chemical elements are homogeneously distributed in the framework of the V2O5@C composite materials.

Subsequently, TEM was also performed to study the morphology of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials. As presented in Fig. 5, the TEM images clearly demonstrate the formation of overlapping thin V2O5@C composite sheet-like structures, which reveal the presence of nanoflakes on the surface of the materials, especially as shown in Fig. 5(b). Thus, the TEM images of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials confirm the observations from the SEM analysis.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to study the structural properties of the V2O5@C composites, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) exhibits the XRD spectra of all the synthesized composites materials, in which several peaks can be observed. These diffraction peaks correspond to the Miller indices of the (200), (001), (201), (011), (111), (310), (311), (600), (112), (321) and (702) crystallographic planes and can be indexed as the orthorhombic structure Pmmn (59) space group with lattice parameters of: a = 11.4980 Å, b = 3.5450 and c = 4.3450 using the matching Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) Card No. 96-412-4511.48–50 Additionally, no peaks of carbon were observed in the XRD pattern, which can be due to the high intensities of the peaks of the vanadium pentoxide nanostructures. Meanwhile, the crystallite sizes based on the most intense (201) diffraction plane were calculated using the Scherer equation as follows:4,51 Crytallite size (nm) = 0.94λβcosθ(7)where λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54 Å), θ is the diffraction angle and β is the full peak width at half-maximum of the (201) plane.

Fig. 6(b) presents the crystallite size of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials. Among them, the highest crystallite size was observed for the V2O5@C–R2HS composite (80.5 nm) (65.8 nm and 66.6 nm), which implies that the V2O5@C–R2HS composite is highly crystalline compared to the others composites.
Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were carried out to establish and identify the different phase structure of all the composites materials, as shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  (ab) Raman spectra and (c) FTIR spectra of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials. 
The Raman vibration modes of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials are located at ∼99.0 cm−1, 141.1 cm−1, 282.5 cm−1, 406 cm−1, 405.5 cm−1, 522.5 cm−1, 691.7 cm−1 and 991.4 cm−1, as presented in Fig. 7(a).52 The Raman bands of the composites synthesized with the extract of HS are indexed to the characteristic vibration modes of orthorhombic V2O5.53,54 The component peaks observed at low (99.0 cm−1, the bending vibration Ag) and high modes (141.1 cm−1, the bending vibration B3g) can be described in terms of external modes55 and the layered structure of orthorhombic V2O5,56,57 respectively. The Raman bands located at 282.5 cm−1, 405.5 cm−1, 522.5 cm−1, and 691.7 cm−1 are related to the bending vibrations of the O–V–O bond (B2g mode) and asymmetric stretching of the V–O–V bond (Ag mode). The peak at 991.4 cm−1 is associated to the stretching of the VO bond, arising from the bands of the V2O5 crystallites.23,58 As displayed in Fig. 7(a), the peaks of carbon were not observed due to the high intensity peaks of the orthorhombic vanadium pentoxides. In the Raman spectra in Fig. 7(b), which presents a magnified view of Fig. 7(a), the low intensities of the peaks at 1321–1335 cm−1 and 1587–1589 cm−1 are attributed to the disorder or defect in the graphitic structure and the tangential vibration of the sp2 carbon atoms, respectively.59,60 These two peaks are pronounced for V2O5@C–R2HS, while for the other composites are not observed at all, which can be due to the fact that their presence is much lower than the detection limit of the Raman spectroscopy technique.
To further check the presence of carbon in the V2O5 matrix, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out for all the orthorhombic V2O5@C composite materials. The FTIR analysis of the materials displayed the vibration modes of the vanadium oxygen bond in the range of 1006.5 to 1013.7 cm−1 and 732 to 747.1 cm−1. The (V–O–V) bridging mode of the materials was located at 1000.7 cm−1, while the νs (VO) stretching mode was observed at 732.6–747.1 cm−1.58 These two vibrational modes of νs (V–O–V) and νs (VO), as seen in Fig. 7(c), are in agreement with the Raman scattering analysis, which confirmed the dominant formation of the V2O5 structures.61 Another transmittance peak appeared at higher modes (1604–1614.7 cm−1) for all the V2O5@C composites, which can be assigned to the CC stretching vibration,62,63 revealing the presence of carbon atoms in the samples. The existence of these peaks of carbon is associated with the organic chemical compounds of the HS extract solution.
The N2 adsorption–desorption and pore size distribution measurements were carried out to investigate the textural (porosity) properties of the V2O5@C composites, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI).† Fig. S3(a)† shows a type III adsorption–desorption isotherm with H3 hysteresis behavior. This hysteresis behavior of the composite materials exhibits plate-like particles, giving rise to slit-shaped pores.60,64 The specific surface areas (SSAs) of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials were calculated to be 1.7 m2 g−1, 2.6 m2 g−1 and 3.3 m2 g−1, respectively.65
These low specific surface areas of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composites can be attributed to the formation of non-porous carbon from the Hibiscus sabdariffa flower extract and the formation of an interconnected flower-like morphology. Fig. S3(b)† displays the pore diameters, ranging from ∼2 to 5 nm, which show the presence of predominantly mesopores in the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composites. As presented in Fig. S3(a and b),† the V2O5@C composite synthesized with the dark red (R2HS) extract achieved a superior SSA and highest pore volume compared to the other materials, which can be due to the highest carbon in this material. The highest SSA and pore volume of V2O5@C–R2HS can enable the good transport of electrons and ions, facilitating the diffusion of the electrolyte ions, and further provide more electroactive sites, which can contribute to a high electrochemical performance.
The chemical composition of all the V2O5@C composites was evaluated through XPS analysis to determine the valence state of all the elements present in the as-prepared materials. Table S1 (ESI)† indicates the existence of the main active atoms, which are vanadium, oxygen and carbon. Compared to the vanadium and oxygen elements in all the materials, the amount of carbon is smaller (12.89–17.44 at%). The core-level for all the V2p peaks is displayed in Fig. 8(a, d and g), revealing the binding energy of the V2p1/2 and V2p3/2 peaks observed at 517.1–517.6 eV and, 524.1–524.4 eV, respectively. The V2p3/2 core level spectrum of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS composite materials were deconvoluted into three peaks.

The high binding energy peak of the as-prepared materials located at 517.1–517.6 eV confirms the dominant V5+ valency, which reveals the formation of V2O5.66 The small peaks located at the low binding energy of 516.5–516.8 eV and 515.8–515.9 eV can be attributed to V4+ and V3+, respectively.67–69 These two vanadium species in a lower oxidation state (4+ and 3+) indicate that V5+ can by partially reduced during the synthesis.68 As observed in Table 2, the ratio of IV5+/IV3+ is the lowest in the V2O5@C–WHS composite, while the ratio of IV5+/IV4+ in the V2O5@C–R2HS composite is the highest among the materials, revealing the highest amount of V5+ in the composite prepared with the dark red extract of HS. This high intensity of V5+ in the V2O5@C–R2HS composite can play a crucial role in the performance of the electrode materials.70,71

In Fig. 8(b, e and h), the O1s peaks of all the materials consist of three components with energies of 530.0–530.2 eV, 530.6–530.7 eV and 531.6–531.7 eV. The high peaks at 530.0–530.2 eV are associated with the oxygen in the lattice of vanadium pentoxide,69,72 while the peaks at the binding energy of 530.6–530.7 eV can be attributed to oxygen bound to a vanadium (V4+ and V3+).73,74 The peaks observed at 531.6–531.7 eV can be ascribed to O–CO.75,76 The core-level spectrum of C1s exhibits three peaks, as shown in Fig. 8(c, f and i). The peak at the binding energy of 284.6–285.1 eV corresponds to the sp2 CC bond.77,78 The peaks located at 285.95–286.1 eV and 287.9–288.05 eV are attributed to the sp3 C–O and CO bonding structures, respectively.79,80
3.2 Electrochemical performance of the electrodes
The electrochemical properties of the V2O5@C composite and activated carbon electrodes were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and EIS measurements. The half-cell configuration was investigated using a working potential window of 0.0 to 0.4 V and −0.9 to 0.0 V for the V2O5@C composite and activated carbon electrodes, respectively, using an aqueous electrolyte. In this study, 6 M KOH electrolyte was used to investigate the electrochemical performance of all the electrode materials. The choice of this electrolyte was based on the small radius of its hydration sphere, high molar conductivity (73.5 cm2 Ω mol−1 for K+) and the high ionic conductivity of the OH− ion compared to other neutral and acidic electrolytes (LiCl, KNO3, Na2SO4 and KCl),81–83 as presented in Table 3.

The electrochemical performances of the V2O5–DI and V2O5@C–WHS electrodes were investigated, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI).† Fig. S4(a)† shows the CV plots of V2O5–DI and V2O5@C–WHS at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a mode of charge storage based on redox reactions. Fig. S4(b)† displays the specific capacity values of V2O5–DI (37.1 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) and V2O5@C–WHS (50.4 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) calculated using eqn (1) at different specific currents ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. These figures clearly reveal that the V2O5@C–WHS electrode exhibited a higher current response and specific capacity than the V2O5–DI electrode.
Apparently, the electrochemical properties of the orthorhombic V2O5 electrodes were greatly improved by using the white Hibiscus sabdariffa extract (WHS), indicating the crucial role of the natural flowers in supercapacitors. The V2O5@C–WHS electrode was further compared with the red Hibiscus sabdariffa (R1HS and R2HS) for complete electrochemical optimization of the Hibiscus sabdariffa family. Fig. 9(a) shows the CV plots of the V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS electrodes in the positive potential window of 0.0 to 0.4 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. All the CV curves present anodic and cathodic peaks, exhibiting faradaic behavior. This charge transfer of the faradaic process is characterized with a fast and reversible redox reaction at the surface of V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS due to the interaction between the electrodes and KOH. As observed in Fig. 9(a), the CV plot of V2O5@C–R2HS displays the highest current response compared to the other electrodes, and the electrochemical mechanism reactions implied at the surface of this electrode material can be represented as follows: V2O5 + OH− ↔ V2O5OH + e−(8)
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the electrochemical measurements: (a) CV plots at 50 mV s−1 and (b) GCD curves at 1 A g−1 of V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS, (c) specific capacity of 1 A g−1versus the different HS extracts and (d) coulombic efficiency of the different electrodes for up to 7000 cycles at a constant specific current of 10 A g−1. 

Fig. 9(b) exhibits the corresponding galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) plots of V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS at 1 A g−1. All the GCD plots show a non-linear charge–discharge pattern, confirming the faradaic behavior of all the materials, as observed in Fig. 9(a). The specific capacities of the materials calculated from the GCD profiles are presented in Fig. 9(c). The specific capacity values of 50.5, 52.2 and 99.1 mA h g−1 were recorded for V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS at 1 A g−1, respectively. As can be observed in Fig. 9(c), the specific capacity values of V2O5@C–WHS and V2O5@C–R1HS are very close, while V2O5@C–R2HS has the highest specific capacity value in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This high specific capacity value of 99.1 mA h g−1 is higher than that of the V2O5/GF-150 mg composite (73 mA h g−1) previously studied using the same electrolyte.23Fig. 10(d) shows the coulombic efficiency of V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS for up to 7000 cycles at a constant specific current of 10 A g−1. In this figure, the coulombic efficiency of V2O5@C–R2HS (99.8%) is higher than that of V2O5@C–WHS (96.8%) and V2O5@C–R1HS (98.7%), suggesting the good stability test of the electrode over 7000 cycles. This electrochemical performance of V2O5@C–R2HS is associated with its smallest thickness (40 nm) together with its open flower-like structures and its highest amount of carbon and V5+ ions.

Fig. 10(a) shows the CV profiles of the V2O5@C–R2HS composite electrode at different sweep rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV s−1 in a positive potential window range of 0.0–0.4 V. All the CV plots display faradaic behaviour, confirming the existence of a pair of redox peaks. For instance, the anodic and the cathodic peaks at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 are located at 0.15 V and 0.32 V, respectively. Fig. 10(b) exhibits the corresponding galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) plots at different gravimetric currents ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. The non-linear charge and discharge profile in Fig. 10(b) confirms the presence of faradaic behaviour, as shown in Fig. 10(a). The specific capacity of the electrode was calculated from the GCD curve using eqn (1). Fig. 10(c) presents the calculated specific capacity at different specific currents ranging from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1. Fig. 10(d) shows the Nyquist plot and EIS (see inset of the figure) of the V2O5@C–R2HS composite. An equivalent series resistance (ESR) value of 0.57 Ω was recorded, which can be attributed to the fast charge transport between the electrode and the current collector and good ion diffusion at the electrode–electrolyte interface.23
Additionally, Fig. S4† shows the electrochemical performances of the activated carbon electrode in 6 M KOH. Fig. S4(a)† exhibits the CV plots, showing a rectangular-like profile. This indicates an ideal capacitive behavior in the negative potential window range of −0.9 to 0.0 V. Fig. S5(b)† displays the GCD curves at different specific current values (1–10 A g−1).
This figure shows the linear GCD curves, confirming the double layer capacitive charge storage of the activated carbon.84 Fig. S5(c)† presents the Nyquist plot of the AC coupled with the ERS value of (see inset of the figure) 0.35 Ω.
A further evaluation was performed by fabricating an asymmetric device (V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC) using the V2O5@C–R2HS composite as a positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode in the same electrolyte. Fig. 11(a) presents the CV curves of V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC, which are expanded in the operating voltage of 1.6 V. All the CV profiles show both the contribution of the faradaic (V2O5@C–R2HS composite) and EDLC (AC) electrodes at different scan rates from 0.005 to 1.5 V s−1, confirming the fabrication of the asymmetric device. It is quite remarkable that the CV curves maintained their shape even at a much high scan rate of 1.6 V s−1, indicating a high rate capability, which did not occur in the other devices.

Fig. 11(b) displays the corresponding GCD plots of the V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC asymmetric cell at different specific currents in the range of 1–10 A g−1. The GCD curves confirmed the hybrid behaviour of the asymmetric device, which agree with the CV curves, as observed in Fig. 11(a). According to the GCD plots, the specific capacity of V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC was recorded and presented in Fig. 11(c), where the specific capacity of the asymmetric device is 49 mA h g−1 at a specific current of 1 A g−1. At a high specific current (10 A g−1), the specific capacity shows a value of 15 mA h g−1. The Ragone plot of the V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC asymmetric device cell is presented in Fig. 11(d) with a specific energy and specific power value of 33.4 W h kg−1 and 670 W kg−1, respectively, at a specific current of 1 A g−1. A specific energy value of 11 W h kg−1 was recorded at a gravimetric current of 10 A g−1 with an associated specific power of 9900 W kg−1. These specific energy and specific power values are superior to that reported for some V2O5/graphite- and graphene-based composites, including an exfoliated graphite nanoplatelet–V2O5 nanotube composite (xGnP–VNT),85 vanadium pentoxide and graphene nanocomposite (VGN)24 and graphene/V2O5 (V–LrGO),86 as shown in Fig. 11(c). These good specific energy and specific power values of the device are linked to the high specific capacity of V2O5@C–R2HS and the stable electrochemical performances of AC.
To assess the cycling stability of the asymmetric device, it was tested for up to 25000 constant charge–discharge cycles at a high specific current of 10 A g−1. The cycling stability is crucial for good practical applications in a supercapacitor. Fig. 12(a) presents the coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of the cell device as a function of cycle number. The cycling stability of V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC showed excellent coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of 98.9% and 88% for up to 25000 cycles, respectively. The insets in the figure show the GCD curves of the first few cycles and few cycles near the 25000th cycles at 10 A g−1, exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability at a stable voltage of 1.6 V.

This is due to the incorporation of carbon (from the natural flower Hibiscus sabdariffa) in the orthorhombic V2O5 matrix, which was employed as a positive electrode, and using AC as a negative electrode for a high cycle number. Fig. 12(b) presents the Nyquist plots of the asymmetric device before and after 25000 cycles. The Nyquist plot before 25000 cycles displays a smaller deviation from the vertical line and shorter diffusion length compared to after the stability measurement. The ESR value of the V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC asymmetric device increased from 0.8 Ω before cycling to 0.96 Ω after the stability test.
4. Conclusion
We successfully synthesized novel orthorhombic V2O5@C composites (V2O5@C–WHS, V2O5@C–R1HS and V2O5@C–R2HS) using a green solvothermal process. All the V2O5@C composite materials displayed a flower-like morphology with few agglomerated nanoflakes on their surface. The incorporation of carbon into the V2O5 matrix was confirmed from the element distribution mapping images, Raman, FTIR and XPS data. The V2O5@C–R2HS composite presented the smallest thickness (40 nm) of the flower-like morphology and the highest amount of carbon and V5+ ions. The V2O5@C–R2HS composite electrode displayed a superior electrochemical performance compared to that of the V2O5@C–WHS and V2O5@C–R1HS composites using 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. An asymmetric device was fabricated using the V2O5@C–R2HS composite as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode at a cell voltage of 1.6 V. The V2O5@C–R2HS‖AC device presented a specific energy and associated specific power of 33.4 W h kg−1 and 670 W kg−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1. The asymmetric cell showed excellent cycling stability of 98.9% coulombic efficiency and 88% capacity retention up to a large number of cycles (25000). This study confirms that this novel green V2O5@C–R2HS composite can result in a superior performance as a positive electrode for future sustainable supercapacitors.
