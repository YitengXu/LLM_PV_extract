    , Accepted 13th July 2016First published on 14th July 2016AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen by sunlight is a promising approach to solve energy and environmental problems. In this work, silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) photocathodes decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for PEC water splitting were successfully prepared by a flexible and scalable electrochemical reduction method. The SiNWs photocathode with the optimized rGO decoration (SiNWs/rGO20) shows an enhanced activity with a much higher photocurrent density and significantly positive shift of onset potential compared to the bare SiNWs arrays for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The enhanced PEC activity is ascribed to the high electrical conductivity of rGO and improved separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. This work not only demonstrates a facile, rapid and tunable electrochemical reduction method to produce rGO, but also exhibits an efficient protocol to enhance the PEC water splitting of silicon-based materials.
1. Introduction
Sustainable energy sources are urgently required because of the excessive consumption of fossil fuels which has led to a critical energy crisis and associated environmental problems.1,2 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the most promising methods to solve energy and environmental issues by using the free and abundant sunlight as a clean power source.3,4 Recently, photocathodes based on semiconductors in PEC cells have attracted much attention for PEC hydrogen evolution.5 However, typical semiconductors, such as TiO2 and ZnO, have wide band gaps and can only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light which accounts just for ∼4% of the solar radiation energy, resulting in low utilization of sunlight.6–10 In contrast, most of the narrow band-gap semiconductors have high optical absorption over a wide range of the solar spectrum, but the improper positions of their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) can't always meet the energetic requirements for solar water splitting.11–13 Among the narrow band-gap semiconductors, silicon possesses a conduction band edge (−0.5 eV vs. NHE at pH = 0) which is sufficiently more negative than the reduction potential of protons for H2 production, showing great potential for hydrogen evolution from solar water splitting. However, the commonly used planar silicon has a high reflectance for incident photons which leads to low light harvesting. Compared with planar silicon, silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) used for PEC water splitting have many merits such as lower reflectance to improve light harvesting, a large specific surface area to provide more active sites, and fast and direct charge carrier transport pathways to enhance the separation efficiency of the charge carriers.14–17 However, as PEC photocathodes for hydrogen generation, it is still not satisfactory to employ SiNWs due to their low-efficiency indirect band gap and their large kinetic over-potential for overall water splitting.18,19
Therefore, co-catalysts have been applied to enhance the PEC performance of SiNWs photocathodes.20–22 Due to its high optical transmittance, good electrical conductivity and large surface area, graphene has become an important co-catalyst with low-cost, environmental-friendly, and corrosion-resistant properties for SiNW photocathodes.23–26 In previous reports, graphene/SiNWs composites have been prepared by various methods to improve the power conversion efficiencies of solar water splitting,27–31e.g., Huang et al.28 synthesized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a solvothermal method and spin-coated it on SiNWs for the enhancement of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Sim et al.29 prepared N-doped graphene quantum sheets as co-catalysts on the SiNWs surface by chemical vapor deposition, which exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic H2-production activity. Fellahi et al.31 utilized UV irradiation to reduce graphene oxide (GO) as an efficient co-catalyst on SiNWs to enhance the PEC activity. Nevertheless, these reported methods to fabricate rGO on SiNWs always suffer from a complicated preparation process, a serious waste of raw materials and energy, and/or toxic substances to pollute the environment. Thus a more suitable method for preparation of graphene on SiNWs is strongly needed.
Electrochemical reduction of GO is a facile, controllable, efficient and environmentally friendly approach to form rGO.32–37 Herein, we demonstrate an electrochemical method to directly reduce GO onto the SiNWs. Compared to the bare SiNWs, the obtained SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode not only exhibits improved PEC performance with more than 29 times higher photocurrent density at −0.5 V vs. RHE, but also represents a significantly positive shift of onset potential by 0.66 V under illumination. These results indicate the advantages of the synthesized rGO derived from this facile preparation method on silicon based-PEC water splitting.
2. Experimental
Preparation of SiNWs
P-type (100) Si substrates (1–10 Ω cm) were degreased by ultrasonication in ethanol, acetone and water for 15 min sequentially. Afterward, the degreased Si substrates were subjected to a boiling solution composed of H2SO4 and H2O2 (3:1, v:v) for 20 min, followed by deionized water rinsing. In a typical metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) process,14 the cleaned Si substrates were dipped into a solution of HF for 2 min before they were immersed in aqueous etchant (AgNO3, 5 mM; HF, 4.8 M) for 1–2 min at room temperature (25 °C). Then, the Si substrates were immediately immersed into an aqueous etchant composed of 4.8 M HF and 0.25 mM H2O2 for 30 min in the dark to form silver-dendrite-covered SiNWs. Subsequently, the silver dendrites were removed by immersion in dilute HNO3 for 2 h. The obtained SiNWs were rinsed with deionized water and finally dried at 40 °C in vacuum.
Preparation of SiNWs/rGO samples
GO was synthesized from natural graphite powder by a modified Hummers’ method.38 rGO was obtained by an electrochemical reduction method.36 Briefly, the obtained GO was dispersed in 0.5 M HCl solution by vigorous stirring and sonication for several hours to form a homogeneous dispersion with a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1. Prior to the electrochemical reduction process, the system was bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen. An electrochemical reduction process to obtain rGO was carried out in GO solution by a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) with a three-electrode configuration. The prepared SiNWs, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) were applied as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The tested potential vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale conforming to the following equation:39 ERHE = Em, Ag/AgCl + 0.059pH + 0.197(1)where ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE, Em, Ag/AgCl is the experimental potential tested against the reference electrode. In order to investigate the effect of the rGO content on the PEC performance on the SiNWs, the electrochemical reduction process was repeated from 0.85 V to −1.15 V vs. RHE at a rate of 50 mV s−1 with 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, and correspondingly the resulting composite photocathodes were labeled as SiNWs, SiNWs/rGO10, SiNWs/rGO20, SiNWs/rGO30 and SiNWs/rGO40, respectively. After electrochemical reduction, the working electrodes were washed with DI water, and then dried at 40 °C in vacuum. The schematic diagram of the fabrication process is shown in Scheme 1.

Electrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-electrode configuration using a Chenhua CHI 660C electrochemical analyzer with 0.1 M H2SO4 and 0.5 M K2SO4 (pH = 2) solution as the supporting electrolyte. The prepared samples, Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) electrode were employed as the working electrode, the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. The nitrogen was purged into the reactor for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen before illumination. A 300 W Xenon arc lamp with 100 mW cm−2 intensity was positioned 16 cm from the reactor as the light source to trigger the PEC reaction. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the dark and under light illumination (100 mW cm−2). A photocurrent density versus time (J–T) curve was evaluated under illumination at a fixed potential of 0 V vs. RHE. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were performed at the open circuit potential over the frequency range between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz with an AC voltage magnitude of 5 mV amplitude under illumination. Mott–Schottky measurement was performed with a fixed frequency of 1 kHz and an AC voltage magnitude of 5 mV under illumination to determine the charge carrier density.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected with a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer with a Cu Kα irradiation source (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology of the samples was obtained with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM, 7500F). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were achieved by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu, Japan) with BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were carried out on an ESCALAB250xi electron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation at 200 W. The binding energy was referenced to the adventitious carbon C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Raman spectra of GO and SiNWs/rGO20 were measured on a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia) in the backscattering geometry at room temperature with a 633 nm Ar+ laser as excitation source.
3. Results and discussion
Representatively, microstructures of SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 were investigated by FESEM. The two samples exhibit a similar morphology to porous silicon nanowire arrays. Fig. 1a shows the top view of the obtained silicon nanowires, most of which are closely bundled to form pores with pore diameters from tens to hundreds of nanometers. The FESEM image of the cross-section in Fig. 1b shows that the SiNWs are uniform, straight and vertical to the Si substrate and the length of SiNWs is approximately 6.5 μm. After electrochemical reduction, rGO is located on top of the SiNW arrays (Fig. 1c). The low contrast between rGO islands and the SiNWs background in Fig. 1c indicates the high transparency and very thin thickness of rGO. Therefore, the incident light is able to pass through the rGO and can be effectively utilized by the SiNWs for PEC reaction. The energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) mapping of C element in the SiNWs/rGO20 (Fig. 1d) strongly confirms that the rGO was successfully loaded on the SiNWs. The TEM image of SiNWs/rGO20 (Fig. 1e) also demonstrates the intimate contact between SiNWs and rGO, which can ensure fast electron migration from SiNWs to rGO, so that the HER performance of the device can be enhanced.

The crystalline phases of the as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD (Fig. 2). The XRD patterns of all the samples demonstrate the good crystalline structure of silicon with a characteristic peak at 69.7°, which can be assigned to the (400) crystal plane of Si (JCPDS 27-1402). The main crystal structure of the silicon can be preserved on SiNWs after MACE processing, suggesting that the unique photoelectrochemical properties of the silicon can be inherited by the SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20. In addition, no characteristic diffraction peaks of rGO can be observed from the XRD pattern of SiNWs/rGO20 due to the low content and relatively low diffraction intensity of rGO on SiNWs in our case. However, a slightly decreased peak intensity of SiNWs/rGO20 compared to that of SiNWs can be observed, which should be due to the sheltering effect from rGO in SiNWs/rGO20.40

Optical properties of the prepared samples were measured by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 3. The silicon wafer has a relatively high UV-vis reflectance (>28%) in the wavelength range from 400 to 1100 nm. In contrast, the reflectance of SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 is much lower than that of silicon wafer, indicating the low effective refractive index and low multi-antireflection behaviors. This also suggests that a large part of the light is absorbed by SiNWs array and SiNWs/rGO20. In the wavelength range of 1100–1400 nm, the slightly lower reflectance of SiNWs/rGO20 than that of SiNWs can be attributed to the enhanced photon absorption by the black body effect of rGO.26,28

Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the structural changes occurring during the electroreduction of GO to rGO on the surface of SiNWs. Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of GO, SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 in a wavenumber range from 200 to 3000 cm−1. For SiNWs, the spectrum shows the most intense characteristic Raman band at 517 cm−1, which is due to the scattering of the first-order optical phonon of crystalline silicon. In addition, there are two less-intense characteristic Raman bands at 302 and 970 cm−1, which can be assigned to the scattering of two transverse acoustic (2TA) phonons and two transverse optical (2TA) phonons, respectively.41,42 As for GO, there are two typical Raman bands at 1334 and 1597 cm−1. The band at 1334 cm−1, denoted as the D peak, is generally associated with lattice defects and partially disordered structures of the sp2 domains. The other band at 1597 cm−1, denoted as the G peak, represents the first-order scattering of the E2g vibrational mode within the aromatic rings of sp2 carbon atoms.43,44 In the case of SiNWs/rGO20, all the Raman characteristic bands from SiNWs and GO can be detected, while the SiNWs/rGO20 shows an increased D/G intensity ratio (1.14) compared to GO (0.80) (Table 1), indicating that GO was successfully reduced to rGO and deposited on SiNWs during the electrochemical reduction.45,46

XPS was carried out to determine the chemical composition and reduction state of GO and SiNWs/rGO20 samples. The C 1s XPS spectra for GO can be deconvoluted into four typical peaks (Fig. 5a, dashed lines), which are attributed to the following functional groups: sp2 bonded carbon (C–C, 284.7 eV), epoxy/hydroxyls (C–O, 286.9 eV), carbonyls (CO, 287.8 eV) and carboxyl (O–CO, 288.9 eV), indicating the high percentage of oxygen-containing functional groups in GO.47,48 Meanwhile, as shown in the XPS spectrum of C 1s of the SiNWs/rGO20 (Fig. 5b), after electrochemical reduction, the peaks relating to CO, C–O and O–CO (dashed lines) have much lower intensities than those observed in GO, implying that most of the oxygen-containing functional groups are successfully removed during electroreduction. This result is also in good agreement with the aforementioned increased D/G intensity ratio of SiNWs/rGO20 in Raman spectra analysis (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Therefore, it is clear that GO is partially reduced to rGO in the SiNWs/rGO20, which is expected to improve the electrical conductivity of the samples.24,25,47

The PEC hydrogen production performance of SiNWs/rGO composites was evaluated via polarization experiments. The content of rGO is one of the key factors influencing the PEC performance of SiNWs/rGO composites. Controlling the number of scan cycles of the electrochemical reduction is an effective way to load a tunable amount of rGO on the SiNWs array.35,36Fig. 6a exhibits the LSV curves of SiNWs/rGO composites, and Fig. 6b shows the photocurrent densities of SiNWs/rGO samples at −0.5 V vs. RHE dependent on the CV scan cycles. It can be seen that with a small amount of loaded rGO (10 CV cycles), the photocurrent density of SiNWs/rGO10 can be enhanced significantly compared to the bare SiNWs. When the SiNWs is covered by rGO after 20 CV cycles, SiNWs/rGO20 shows the highest photocurrent density. To confirm that rGO itself does not exhibit the photoactive behavior intrinsically, rGO alone was investigated as a photocatalyst on the FTO glass prepared by the same electrochemical reduction method. As shown in Fig. 6c, the bare rGO on FTO glass without the SiNWs array is not photoactive under the same experimental conditions. Therefore the enhanced PEC performance of SiNWs/rGO should be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the high conductivity of rGO and the photoactivity of the SiNWs array, which can lead to effective spatial separation of the electron–hole pairs to produce more H2. Moreover, the rGO acts as an acceptor of the electrons generated in the Si photocathode and effectively decreases the recombination probability of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs, causing more charge carriers to form reactive species. However, a further increase of the rGO content (more than 20 CV scans) on the SiNWs/rGO composites leads to a deterioration of the photocatalytic performance. In particular, the photocurrent density of SiNWs/rGO40 was even smaller than that of the bare SiNWs. This is because overloading of rGO can cause a shielding effect on SiNWs which can greatly reduce the light absorption ability of the SiNWs.47 Obviously, the optimal photocathode is SiNWs/rGO20 in our research. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6a, the photocathodic current densities decrease with increase of the rGO content when the number of CV cycles is larger than 20. This indicates that the photocathodic current density does not originate from the further reduction of GO. In Fig. 6c, the photocathodic current densities of the FTO/rGO20 is extremely low, ∼3 orders of magnitude lower than that of SiNWs/rGO20. This result further proves that the enhancement of the photocathodic current density of SiNWs/rGO20 cannot be due to the reduction of GO.

(c) LSV curves of FTO/rGO20 measured in the dark and under illumination (100 mW cm−2). (d) LSV curves of polished silicon wafer, SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 in the dark and under illumination (100 mW cm−2). 
In order to investigate further the mutual influence of silicon and rGO on enhanced PEC performance, the LSV curves of the polished silicon wafer, SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 photocathodes were compared. As shown in Fig. 6d, the silicon wafer, SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 photocathodes all exhibit negligibly small currents in the dark. Under illumination, the SiNWs exhibit a much larger current density than silicon wafer, indicating that nanowire arrays of silicon are conducive to enhance the PEC performance for HER due to its lower reflectance, higher surface area and fast charge carrier transport pathway. Surprisingly, the SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode, prepared by decoration of SiNWs with rGO, exhibits the highest photocurrent density with −5.22 mA cm−2 at −0.5 V vs. RHE, which is 29 times as large as that of the bare SiNWs (0.18 mA cm−2); moreover, the onset potential of the SiNWs/rGO20 is 0.25 V vs. RHE, representing a positive shift by 0.66 V in comparison with that of SiNWs (−0.41 V vs. RHE). These results indicate that loading of rGO can further improve the PEC performance of the SiNWs photocathodes.
It is well-known that the PEC performance is strongly associated with band bending and impedance. Herein, capacitance and impedance measurements were carried out to clarify the PEC activity enhancement mechanism of the SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the capacitance results of the bare SiNWs and the SiNWs/rGO20 samples. The flat band potentials and carrier densities of the bare SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 samples were calculated by the Mott–Schottky relationship:49 1/Csc2 = 2(E − Efb − kT/e)/(eεε0NA2)(2)where Csc is the capacitance of the space charge region, E is the applied potential, Efb is the flat band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electron charge, N is the hole acceptor density for a p-type semiconductor, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor materials, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and A is the reaction area of the material. The carrier concentration was determined by the slope, and Efb was calculated by extrapolation to a capacitance of zero. According to these relations, the flat band potential of the SiNWs/rGO20 sample (0.11 V vs. RHE) is more negative than that of the SiNWs array (0.24 V vs. RHE) under irradiation (100 mW cm−2). According to the equation: Eb = E − Efb,50 the magnitude of band bending (Eb) and Efb are determined by the applied potential in the semiconductor. Because the SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 samples act as photocathodes, E is always more negative than Efb. As a result, a larger value of Efb for the SiNWs leads to a larger band bending than that of the SiNWs/rGO.50 Larger band bending at the interface between the SiNWs electrodes and electrolyte is propitious to separate the generated electrons and holes. Therefore, comparing with SiNWs, the relatively smaller band bending of SiNWs/rGO20 cannot afford the significant enhancement in performance of the SiNWs/rGO sample in Fig. 6a. Since the contribution of band bending can be ruled out, impedance measurements are necessary to reveal the reason for the enhanced PEC activity of the SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode.

To study further the electrochemical performance of the SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 electrode, EIS were measured under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in a three-electrode system. Fig. 8 shows the typical Nyquist plots of SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 samples. In the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 8, Rt represents the overall series resistance of the circuit, CPEdp is the capacitance phase element for the depletion layer of the SiNWs semiconductor, Rct,dp is the charge transfer resistance in the depletion layer of the semiconductor, CPEdl is the capacitance phase element for the double layer at the photocathode/electrolyte interface, and Rct,dl is the charge transfer resistance of the double layer at the photocathode/electrolyte interface, which is correlated to the kinetics of the Faradaic reaction across the double layer (e.g., the reduction of H+ to hydrogen in our experiments), where a smaller value corresponds to a faster reaction rate.51,52
 Fig. 8  EIS Nyquist plots of the SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20. 
In EIS, the semicircle in high-frequency region can be associated with the charge transfer process in the depletion layer of the semiconductor, while in the low-frequency region the semicircle reflects the charge transfer across the double layer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface.49,51 In Fig. 8, the semicircle in the low frequency range corresponding to the interface of SiNWs/rGO20 and electrolyte has a smaller diameter than that of SiNWs, and the fitted values of Rct,dl are 230.4 and 668.2 Ω for SiNWs/rGO20 and SiNWs, respectively; the Rct,dl of SiNWs/rGO20 is approximately 3 times smaller than that of the SiNWs, indicating that the introduction of rGO can significantly decrease the Rct,dl of the photocathode and promote the Faradaic reactions by reducing the charge transfer resistance across the double layer.28 This result shows a good correlation with the remarkably enhanced photocurrent density in the SiNWs/rGO20 sample (Fig. 6a). Consequently, the impedance results suggest that the enhancement of the HER performance of the SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode should be greatly attributed to the high electrical conductivity and the boosted charge transfer rate.
On the basis of the above results and discussion, the mechanism of the enhancement for the charge separation and transfer in the rGO-silicon system for the PEC performance is proposed, as shown in Fig. 9. Under illumination, electrons are excited from the VB to the CB of the silicon semiconductor, leaving holes in the VB. At an applied potential, electrons react with the adsorbed H+ ions to form H2. Because of the high surface area and the special one-dimensional morphology of SiNW, SiNWs can provide not only more active sites for HER reactions, but also fast and direct charge carrier transport pathways to enhance the separation efficiency of the charge carriers. When the SiNWs photocathode is decorated by rGO, rGO can serve as an electron collector and transporter to efficiently contribute to the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs at the applied voltage due to its high conductivity and favorable electron mobility properties. Meanwhile, electrons accumulate on the surface of the rGO sheets, leading to a more negative reduction potential than H+/H2. Therefore, the rGO sheets can catalyze the reduction of H+ to H2 molecule. Moreover, the high optical transmittance and large surface features of rGO allow HER reactions to take place not only on the surface of SiNWs, but also on the rGO sheet, greatly enlarging the reaction space. Furthermore, SiNWs and rGO have a large contact area and strong interaction via an electrochemical method, promoting the transfer of electrons in the PEC reaction.23–26

The photo-stability of the SiNWs/rGO20 photocathode was examined in 0.5 M K2SO4 and 0.1 M H2SO4 solution (pH = 2) at 0 V vs. RHE under illumination (100 mW cm−2). As illustrated in Fig. 10, both SiNWs and SiNWs/rGO20 samples show considerable stability for 1 h under constant illumination, meanwhile, SiNWs/rGO20 exhibits a dramatically enhanced photocurrent compared to the SiNWs photocathode, indicating that such electrochemical modification of the rGO layer on SiNWs can enhance the PEC performance for hydrogen evolution without sacrificing the photocatalytic stability.

4. Conclusions
In summary, this work demonstrates a facile and controllable electrochemical method to deposit effectively and reduce graphene oxide on SiNWs to improve the PEC performance of the SiNWs photocathode. Particularly, the optimized SiNWs/rGO20 composite exhibited a much higher photocurrent and significantly positive shift of the onset potential compared to the bare SiNWs. This is because of the high electrical conductivity of rGO and improved separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. The method and results of this work shed light on application of the facile electrochemical reduction approach to enhance the performance of solar water splitting related devices involving silicon and graphene-based materials.
