    AbstractThis article summarizes various research highlights selected from the 2009 literature pertaining to the synthesis and study of macromolecules that contain main group and transition metal elements in the polymer backbone.

The field of inorganic and organometallic polymers is growing rapidly each year, and important achievements from 2009 include: the radical polymerization of silaalkenes (SiC bonds),40 the synthesis of luminescent organoboron polymers featuring diborylanthracene moieties,62,63 the preparation of air-stable and water soluble cobaltocenium polymers,96 the formation of the first poly(ferrocenylsilane)–polyphosphazene block copolymers,93 and the expanding key role of inorganic polymers as light harvesting components of modern polymeric solar cell devices.82,83
1. Introduction
The incorporation of inorganic elements within the main chain of a macromolecule often leads to the emergence of hitherto unknown, and often useful, properties when compared to more traditional organic polymers. As a result, the preparation of inorganic polymers is of significant fundamental and applied interest to many; however this active field of research is not without its challenges. Specifically, one major hurdle encountered by practitioners in this area is a lack of suitable methods available to link inorganic elements into extended linear arrays. Fortunately synthetic inorganic and organometallic chemistry is advancing to such a degree that these challenges are being continually overcome and the highlights presented below, drawn from a survey of the 2009 literature, is a reflection of these synthetic successes.
This report builds upon the previous article in this series1 and is divided according to similar guidelines. After this brief introduction, recent books and review articles published in the area of inorganic and organometallic polymer chemistry will be summarized. Three sections will then be devoted to research involving the well-established inorganic polymer classes: polysiloxanes (or silicones), polysilanes and polyphosphazenes. After which, there is a section dedicated to the synthesis and applications of new polymers featuring main group (p-block) elements. The field of ferrocene and related metallocene organometallic polymers will then be covered, followed by a final section that showcases recent developments in the preparation of macromolecules containing transition metals.
Throughout this report, focus will be given towards describing advances made in the synthesis of new linear macromolecules with inorganic elements as part of their core structure. The associated burgeoning fields of inorganic nanoscience and supramolecular chemistry will be covered in separate reports.2,3
2. Books and reviews of inorganic polymer science
In 2009, an issue of the journal Polymer International was dedicated to Prof. R. G. Jones in honour of his contribution to the field of polysilanes.4 In addition, Prof. Takakazu Yamamoto was honoured for his research in conducting polymers in the form of a special issue of the Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials.5 Moreover two books describing recent advances in main group polymer chemistry were published: De Jaeger and Gleria edited a collection dealing with “Silicon-based inorganic polymers”,6 while Chivers and Manners authored a comprehensive text covering modern developments in “Inorganic rings and polymers of the p-block elements”.7
A book chapter describing recent advances in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclosiloxanes in aqueous media was published.8 The use of Si–O polymers as electrolytes in Li batteries9 and the employment of ultrasound as a tool to chemically modify various polydimethylsiloxanes and polyorganosilanes were summarized.10 A series of review articles involving polysilanes were published in the above mentioned dedication issue of Polymer International.4 Topics included: new developments in the synthesis and functionalization of polysilanes,11 and the formation of organometallic-rich Si polymers.12 Weinert covered advances in the synthesis and structure of oligogermanes (R2Ge)n in a recent perspective article.13 An interesting article concerning the ability of silole rings and their polymers to undergo aggregation induced photoluminescence was published.14 This behavior should enable the future development of these materials for sensors, as biolabels for immunoassays and as active components of light emitting diodes.14
A detailed review outlining recent progress in polyphosphazene chemistry, including practical applications of this important polymer class, appeared in the literature.15
The use of polymers as active light harvesting/charge creation layers in modern polymeric solar cells (PSCs) is a rapidly expanding domain of research. As many of the most successful polymers contain heterocyclic units based upon inorganic elements (e.g. the thiophene and silole units), their chemistry is relevant to this review. In line with the growing importance of this field, many pertinent reviews have been published in 2009, covering topics ranging from polymer synthesis,16–20 device fabrication/polymer processing,20,21 to the use of transition metal containing polymers as active components.22
The exciting field of polymer light emitting devices (PLEDs) was recently reviewed, with particular focus given to the role of inorganic polymers in advancing this area of research.23,24
The synthesis and photochemistry of various polymers featuring dimeric metal carbonyl complexes in their core was summarized.25 The use chelating π-conjugated polymers to bind various metals for catalytic applications remains an active area of research, and this field was recently reviewed.26
3. Polysiloxanes and related polymers
A platinum-rich polysiloxane gel was synthesized from poly(methylhydrosiloxane), [Me(H)SiO]n, (PMHS) and used as an active catalytic matrix for the hydrogenative reduction of nitroarenes to anilines. At 1% Pt loadings, quantitative reduction of various nitroarenes was reported and, notably, these matrices could be re-used without sign of catalyst leaching.27
The polyborasiloxane, 1, was prepared via electropolymerization and was used for the vaporchromic detection of various primary and secondary amines. Treatment of the amine-bound polymers with B(C6F5)3 resulted in decomplexation of the amine and regeneration of the polyborasiloxane.28  
The synthesis of poly(silsesquioxane)s from the rapid polycondensation of trialkoxysilanes in a continuous-flow micro-reactor was described. By varying the residence times, polymers with controllable molecular weights ranging from 1.9 × 103 g mol−1 to 1.1 × 104 g mol−1 were obtained; these poly(silsesquioxanes) are now being explored as low dielectric constant materials for microelectronics.29
Anionic ring-opening copolymerization of fluorinated cyclosiloxanes [RfMeSiO]3 (Rf = –CH2–CH2–CF3) with hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane [Me2SiO]3 gave copolymers with a gradient distribution of trifluoropropyl groups due to the different reactivity ratios of each monomer.30 Research in this field is driven by the very low glass transition temperatures obtained (<−70 °C).
A series of luminescent polysiloxanes 2 were prepared with coordinated Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions as part of the polymer side chain; these lanthanide polymers displayed narrow spectral emissions in the green and red color regions (for Tb3+ and Eu3+, respectively).31 An interesting class of TEMPO radical functionalized polysiloxanes 3 were developed. These materials exhibited a single, reversible, redox event per TEMPO unit and thus are being explored as cathode active materials for lithium–ion batteries.32  
Metal-free click chemistry (azide/alkyne cycloaddition) was used to construct polysiloxane elastomers under ambient conditions. This chemistry transpired in the absence of light suggesting that the cycloaddition processes were thermally induced and not photochemically driven. These elastomers demonstrated similar softness and transparency as conventional siloxane-based elastomers with the added advantage of their inexpensive and simple syntheses.33
An efficient method for the production of poly(methylalkoxy)siloxanes from PMHS was reported. The Si–OR side groups were generated via the Pt catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols ROH with the Si–H groups of the PMHS backbone.34
An attractive enzyme-mediated approach for the synthesis of poly(dimethylsiloxane)-b-poly(ethyleneterphthalate) block copolymers 4 was reported. In this work, lipase was shown to catalyze the efficient transesterfication of hydroxyterminated polysiloxanes with dimethyl terphthalate; this strategy is a promising “green” route to potentially commercially viable block co-polymers.35 High molecular weight poly(dimethylsiloxane) (>1 × 106 g mol−1) was synthesized in a very low polydispersity (<1.1) via the controlled anionic polymerization of cyclo-[Me2SiO]3 at elevated temperatures.36  
Suitable modification of polysiloxanes with chiral ligands allowed for the stabilization of catalytically active palladium nanoparticles. Preliminary results indicate that these Pd nanoparticles are capable of hydrogenating α-keto esters asymmetrically with modest enantiomeric excesses observed.37
Antibacterial polymers based upon a siloxane backbone and cationic dialkylimidazolium functional groups were recently prepared.38 A novel polysiloxane-based sensor for toxic organophosphates was also reported;39 the presence of phosphate was noted by a mass uptake (as detected by a quartz crystalline microbalance) and was mediated by interactions of the toxin with pendant fluorophenol groups.39
4. Polysilanes, polygermanes, polystannanes, polycarbosilanes and related polymers
The radical polymerization of the silene, (Me3Si)2SiCAd (Ad = 2-adamantylidene), 5, was reported to give the polycarbodisilane (6) as an air- and moisture-stable white solid (Mw = 1.14 × 104 g mol−1; PDI = 1.4). The mechanism of this polymerization was shown to involve the initial addition of a radical to the Si atom in 5 followed by hydrogen transfer from a Me–SiMe2– group to generate a propagating carbon-based radical.40  
A series of mixed oligogermasilanes were prepared using an interesting Lewis acid catalyzed rearrangement.41 The synthesis of the photochromic polysilane 7 was reported wherein the observed color response was due to the light-induced cis-trans isomerization of the pendant azo-benzene unit.42 A novel photochemical route to polyorganogermanes, [R2Ge]n, was described.43 Exposure of dibenzoyldiethylgermane to radiation at 300–440 nm led to the extrusion of the benzoyl groups and formation of poly(diethylgermane) 8 in narrow polydispersity (PDI = 1.01–1.14) and low molecular weights (1.4–2.8 × 103 g mol−1). Preliminary results also indicate that polymer 8 is a suitable photoinitiator for the polymerization of styrene.43 The synthesis of various poly(alkylphenylstannanes) via dehydrocoupling of H2Sn(Ph)R precursors (R = alkyl group) using Wilkinson's catalyst, ClRh(PPh3)3, was described.44 The obtained polystananes were isolated as yellow-orange gummy materials and exhibited very low glass transition temperatures (approaching −52 °C) along with semi-conducting behavior.44 The dehydrocoupling of the primary silanes, RMe2Si(CH2)xSiH3 (x = 2 and 3), using a Cp2TiCl2/2.2 nBuLi catalyst mixture, afforded various poly(hydrosilanes), such as 9, in moderate yields.45    
Poly[methylhydrosilane-co-diphenylsilane]s were prepared; interestingly these materials can act as photosensitizers for the generation of singlet oxygen upon exposure to visible light.46
Ordered silica nanodot arrays were prepared from the photodegredation of poly(styrene-block-carbosilane) films. The titania substrates used in this procedure were photocatalytic for the removal of organic residues, thus leading to pure silica nanodots in a single synthetic procedure.47 The use of polymethacrylate-block-polysilane copolymers as positive-tone photoresists has been demonstrated, and an three-fold increase in etch resistance (to oxygen plasma) relative to polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA, was noted.48 A novel series of block copolymers featuring a pentasilane, [SiPh2]5, core and capping polyalkylmethacrylate blocks were synthesized.49 The syntheses proceeded via living anionic polymerization and hence block copolymers of controllable molecular weights and architectures were obtained.
The chemistry of silole polymers has gained significant attention recently due to their novel photophysical properties. For example a series of fluorescent polymers featuring fused terphenyl disilane groups (10) was reported.50 Moreover polymer LEDs containing the electroluminescent (EL) polysilafluorene (11) were prepared; these materials emitted deep-blue light with an EL efficiency of 1.91% (which is greater than the parent polyfluorene systems).51    
A new light emitting layer for OLEDs based upon silole functionalized poly(norbornene)s exhibited good solution processing and high electron mobility characteristics.52 In a detailed study, a series of oligo- and poly(carbazolylene-alt-diphenylsilane)s were synthesized and shown to display extremely efficient photoluminescence (at times quantitative);53 reduced performance was noted when these polymers were incorporated in PLED devices due to possible issues with unbalanced electron injection/transport. However the modular nature of the polymer synthesis should enable polymer modification and potential increases in device performance to occur.53
5. Polyphosphazenes, polyheterophosphazenes and related polymers
A detailed study of the mechanism of the living cationic polymerization of the N-silylphosphoranimine, Cl3PNSiMe3 (12), was reported last year.54 This work revealed that polymer chain growth occurs more readily at one chain end when the cationic chains are short, e.g. in [Cl3PNPCl3]+, whereas bidirectional growth of the polymer dominates when longer P–N chains are present. Moreover, the PCl6− counterions (once believed to be inert) can initiate the polymerization of 12via its dissociation into chloride ion and the active Lewis acid activator, PCl5, thereby leading to a reduction in molecular weight control during the process. This discovery should facilitate the development of improved initiators for the polymerization of 12.  
The use of oligomeric phosphazenium salts as co-catalysts for the living radical polymerization of methacrylates was reported. These salts when used in conjunction with iron(II) halides led to improved polymerization activities and functional group tolerance when compared to previously known catalysts.55
There were some very notable examples reported in 2009 of polyphosphazenes that were functionalized with biologically active residues. For example, Allcock and coworkers installed dipeptides onto a polyphosphazene backbone via nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine groups in poly(dichlorophosphazene), [NPCl2]n.56 These polymers 13 exhibited improved solubility and stability under neutral to basic conditions, while undergoing rapid hydrolysis at pH < 4; consequently these polymers are promising candidates for tissue engineering and drug delivery. In related work, the synthesis of biodegradable polyphosphazene microcapsules was reported; in this study, silica spheres were used as templating agents that were later removed after polyphosphazene loading to give the polyphosphazene rich capsules.57  
The interaction of hydrophobic polyphosphazene-block-polystyrene copolymers with β-cyclodextrin was reported to give stable micellar structures in water whereby the hydrophobic nature of the polyphosphazene blocks were rendered hydrophilic via side chain (adamantane)/β-cyclodextrin interactions.58
Solid state 2H NMR spectroscopy was used to probe polymer chain mobility within poly[bis(methoxy)phosphazene] at temperatures near its glass transition (Tg); this work confirmed the highly flexible nature of the P-N backbone and the commensurately rapid chain mobility, both required for successful polymer electrolytes.59 A series of high Tg polyphosphazenes have been prepared containing diazo-imidazole based chromophores as side groups (cf.14). These polymers exhibit high degrees of photoinduced birefringence that makes these materials useful for non-linear optic applications.60
The isolation of F2PN was reported,61 and represents the first time that a monomer of a poly(dihalophosphazene) was isolated and conclusively identified via spectroscopy. This species was generated via photolysis of the explosive azidodifluorophosphine, F2P–N3, and studied in a solid argon matrix.61
6. Other main group element-containing polymers
Luminescent polymers were obtained via the hydroboration of various diethynylbenzene linkers using 9,10-dihydro-9,10-diboraanthracene (15 and 16). These novel boron-rich polymers were considerably moisture sensitive and showed a strong tendency towards gelation in organic solvents; the polymeric nature of these materials was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.62 Concurrently, the group of Jia reported a similar hydroboration route to 15 along with a separate condensation route to yield the aryl-spaced diboraanthracene polymer, 17.63 A detailed study of the hydroboration polymerization of TripBH2 (Trip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2) with various aryldialkyne linkers was reported.64 The polymers were obtained in modest molecular weights (ca. 4.0 × 103 g mol−1) and displayed blue-to-green light emission; high degrees of photostability could be obtained by decorating the aryl linkers with fluorinated side groups (e.g. CF3).64
Fluorescent conjugated polyorganoboranes featuring alkylfluorene moieties were prepared.65 The electronic structure of these polymers were readily tunable by varying the nature of the groups attached to boron. These materials exhibited enhanced electron affinity when compared to their boron-free analogues, and preliminary studies indicate that these polymers can be used to selectivity bind/detect smaller anions such as fluoride and cyanide.65 Quinolate polymers containing conjugated spacer groups such as fluorene and thiophene (18) were synthesized via an ether cleavage reaction involving reactive bromoborane moieties.66 These polymers are stable to 300 °C (as evidenced by TGA studies) and possess luminescence characteristics that are suitable for the construction of polymeric light emitting devices (PLEDs).66 An interesting class of boron-containing polyquinolate analogues were prepared by Chujo and coworkers wherein the oxygen donor groups at boron were replaced with the heavier chalcogens, sulfur and selenium; incorporation of the heavy donors led to a red shift in the emission wavelengths, however a concomitant reduction in quantum yields was also observed.67      
Various air- and moisture-stable macromolecules containing carborane (B10C2) units as integral components of the main chains were reported. For example, luminescent polyalkynylarylenecarboranes 19 were prepared (Mw = 4.3–5.1 × 104 g mol−1; PDI = 1.4–1.8).68 Moreover, examples of polycarboranes with ortho-substitution about the carborane cages were developed.69,70  
A series of fluorene-aluminum bis(8-hydroxyquinoline)acetylacetone oligomers (n = 1–9) was described, and the electron transport processes in these materials were examined using a combination of theoretical methods and femtosecond transient spectroscopy. In addition preliminary devices featuring these oligomers exhibited bright yellow electroluminescence.71
Fluorescent polymeric dyes based upon repeating units of BODIPY were prepared (20). Due to the nature of synthetic methods employed, various conjugated linkers could be readily inserted between the BODIPY groups, allowing for the tuning of the light emission.72 In related work, polyfluorenes were prepared with luminescent BODIPY groups embedded in the polymer backbone (21). The incorporation of the BODIPY linkers led to a red-shift in the UV-vis absorption relative to their monomeric analogues.73  
The intermolecular hydrophosphination of phosphinoalkynes led to the formation of cyclic polyphosphinoalkenes 23 with a degree of polymerization (DPn) approaching 60.74,75 The controlled functionalization of polyethylenes with pendant phosphonic acid groups was reported. In this study, Wagner and coworkers used ADMET (acyclic diene metathesis) condensation polymerization to selectively graft the hydrophilic –PO(OH)2 residues at every 21st carbon atom of the polyethylene backbone. Phosphonic-acid residues have been used previously to impart improved biocompatibility and flame-resistance to polymeric materials.76  
A breakthrough in the field of light emitting polymers was reported by Baumgartner et al. in which the synthesis of a random terpolymer featuring styrene repeat units along with two different light emitting dithienophosphole groups (24), led to a material which displayed stable bright white light emission when protonated.77  
As mentioned in section 2, thiophene rings form integral components of many efficient photovoltaic polymeric solar cells (PSCs). In line with this research field, the efficient growth of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) chains from an active surface of silica spheres was reported. This polymer/nanoparticle framework achieved good photovoltaic responses and should facilitate the development of even higher performance hybrid materials for solar cell technologies.78 Numerous reports concerning the use of thiophene and dithienosilole polymers to construct polymeric solar cells were published in 2009. This field has been reviewed already,16–21 therefore only selected examples of the highest performing materials from last year's literature will be mentioned here. Notably, a low band-gap polymer capable of light absorption up to 800 nm was prepared containing dithienosilole and benzothiadiazole units as part of the polymer backbone (25).79 By systematically altering the location and number of thiophene residues in each repeat unit within the polymer class 25, improvements in PSC performance could be obtained.80 In an interesting report, the band gap of the molecular model 26 could be tuned significantly via the addition of various Lewis acids, such as B(C6F5)3. Interaction of the Lewis acids with one of the benzothiadiazole N atoms results in considerable shifting of the absorption profile to longer wavelengths. Provided that these Lewis acids do not interfere with electron transfer processes, this strategy might be of use to the blossoming PSC field.81 Lastly, very high power conversion efficiencies (ca. 7%) were obtained using the PBDTT polymer construct 27. The synthetic strategy used allows for facile tailoring of the chemical structure, thus paving the way for even greater increases in PSC efficiencies.82,83      
7. Ferrocene-containing and related metallocene polymers
A series of cyclic oligo- and polyferrocenylsilanes, 28, were obtained via the irradiation of the silicon-bridged ferrocenophane [Cp2FeSiMe2] in the presence of pyridine Lewis bases as initiators. The cyclic oligomers [Cp2FeSiMe2]x (x = 2–7) were purified by column chromatography and characterized by X-ray crystallography and electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry). Moreover MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to show that the polymers produced also contained cyclic structures.84 The photo-initiated polymerization of dircarba[2]ferrocenophanes was explored; notably the polymerization exhibited living characteristics at early stages of the polymerization (up to 50 repeat units), and as such this strategy could be used to generate well-defined block copolymer architectures involving silicon-bridged ferrocene blocks.85  
The synthesis of polyferrocenylsilane (PFS) hydrogel polyelectrolytes was described. In this study, the redox nature of the iron centres was used to manipulate the swelling and collapse of the hydrogel matrix via chemical oxidation and reduction.86 In addition, the preparation of organometallic liquid crystalline materials featuring redox active PFS polymers was reported; these materials are promising candidates for the development of polymeric electrochemical sensors.87 Patterned arrays of poly(ferrocenylmethylphenylsilane) were demonstrated to be suitable etch masks resists for oxygen plasma reactive ion etching processes, whereby features in the sub 100 nm range could be generated.88 PS-b-PFS-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine) triblock terpolymers were prepared. These materials readily self-assembled to give well-defined arrays of iron-rich nanorings (33 nm outer diameter) after selective etching of the organic blocks by reactive ion etching with oxygen.89
Poly(ferrocenylsilane)-hyperbranched poly(carbosilane) block copolymers were prepared via hydrosilylation chemistry.90 These materials exhibited rich electrochemistry due to the presence of redox active ferrocene groups, and rod-like assemblies could be constructed via copolymer self-assembly in THF/decane solvent mixtures.90
Foucher et al. developed an elegant synthesis of poly(ferrocenyldisiloxane) 30via the Pt catalyzed oxidation/polymerization of bis(dimethylsilane)ferrocene 29 using DMF as an oxygen source.92  
The novel boron-bridged polyferrocene [FcBH]n (Fc = (η5-C5H4)2Fe) was prepared and shown to undergo smooth hydroboration chemistry with acetylenes (R–CC–H; R = tBu and Ph) to give the substituted polyferrocenylboranes 31. These polymers were air- and moisture-sensitive, however light scattering performed under nitrogen atmosphere indicated that the polymer chains were short (Mn < 5000 g mol−1). The electronic nature of molecular models suggest that the empty boron p-orbitals in 31 might be involved in electron delocalization.91
The first example of a poly(ferrocenylsilane-block-polyphosphazene) copolymer was reported (32). A great advantage of the synthetic protocol used is that a combination of living anionic (for the PFS block) and cationic polymerization routes (for the polyphosphazene block) were used, thus providing a high degree of control over the PFS-PN molecular weight and block ratio. Preliminary results indicate that these polymers readily assemble into well-defined morphologies.93  
Conjugated ferrocene-containing poly(aryleneethynylene)s 33 were recently synthesized. These materials have donor-acceptor chromophores embedded within the main chain (as evidence by the appearance of charge transfer bands in the UV-vis spectrum) leading to low optical band gaps (1.41 V), and hence are promising materials for photovoltaic applications.94 Ferrocenyl end-capped oligothiophenevinylenes were prepared and their charge transfer/electronic communication behavior was studied in the context of developing novel non-linear optic materials.95  
The ring opening polymerization of the dicarba[2]cobaltocenophane 34 afforded the high-molecular weight polycobaltocenium 35 as a yellow-green, water soluble and redox active organometallic polymer (Mw ∼ 55000 g mol−1; estimated by dynamic light scattering).96
Acyclic Diene Metathesis Polymerization (ADMET) was successfully employed in the synthesis of novel molybdocene-containing polymers 37. In the presence of Schrock's catalyst, the olefin capped monomer 36 was polymerized to give the poly(dimolybdocene) in modest molecular weight (Mn = 2.3 × 104 g mol−1; PDI = 4.3). Concentrated reaction media were required during the polymerization in order to suppress undesired ring-closing metathesis (RCM). Notably, polymer 37 could be degraded photochemically with visible light in CCl4, and this process occurs via the cleavage of the core Mo–Mo bonds.97    
8. Other metal-containing polymers
Gold functionalized poly(4-vinylpyridine)s were obtained as bright green luminescent solids from the direct reaction of poly(4-vinylpyridine) with the Au(I) sources, Au(C6X5)THT (X = F or Cl; THT = tetrahydrothiophene); efforts are currently underway to develop these materials as PLED phosphors.98 The creation of ordered domains of gold nanoparticles within lamellar structures was achieved via the binding of gold particles to the pyridine residues within ordered polystyrene-block-polyvinylpyridine copolymers arrays.99
Smith and coworkers communicated the synthesis of the diphosphine linked metallopolymers 38 and 39. The molecular weight of these materials were estimated to be 1.5 × 104 and 1.7 × 104 g mol−1 respectively by end-group analysis (31P NMR), and fluorescent behaviour was observed.100  
A novel redox active organometallic polyacetylide 40 was prepared by Harvey and coworkers. The inclusion of benzoquinone-diamine spacers allowed for chemically reversible two electron redox processes to transpire. The redox behavior of 40 was similar to that found within polyaniline, therefore 40 represents an interesting class of potentially conducting organometallic polymer.101  
A nickel dithiolene-containing polymer 41 was prepared via electropolymerization of an indole di-capped monomer. The obtained polymer displayed fast electrochromic response in the near IR (∼860 nm). Such modulation could find application in telecommunications provided that the electrochromic response could be tuned towards the 1300–1550 nm optical window of fiber-optics.102 Nickel dithiolene polymers featuring thiophene groups were also synthesized. These polymers displayed similar redox behavior as polythiophenes with increased light absorption in the near-IR region (a property that is useful for polymer based solar cells).103  
Green light-emitting polynorbornenes were synthesized by the ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of platinum(II) and carbazolyl-based norbornene monomers. In these systems, solution phosphorescence efficiencies of 0.56 were obtained suggesting that these materials would be suitable for OLED devices.104
Terpyridine-functionalized poly(phenylenevinylene)s 42 were used to detect Cu2+ ions in a selective manner by taking advantage of the significant quenching of the polymer fluorescence in the presence of copper.105
A series of high band-gap metallopolyynes of Pt(II) bearing electron donating phenothiazine and thiophene units were prepared (43). These materials displayed significant thermal stabilities (up to 345 °C; by thermal gravimetric analysis, TGA) and showed modest performance when incorporated in bulk heterojunction solar cell devices (1.3% efficiency); moreover, luminescent behavior was observed.22
The optical properties of Pt(II) polyynes with fused and non-fused thiophene linkers were recently compared. Despite the increase in ring planarity of the fused thiophene derivatives, an increase in the excited state energies of these systems relative to non-fused analogues was noted.106    
Highly efficient, bright yellow-green, electrophosphorescence was noted within platinum acetlylide polymers containing N-heterocyclic carbazole chromophores. The incorporation of metals within PLEDs often creates concern with respect to the toxicity of the metal, however these Pt based polymers displayed very low levels of cytotoxicity, making them suitable for use in commercial PLEDs.107
Polythiophenes bearing Co(DBSQ) units (DBSQ = 3,5-di-tert-butylcatecholate) were synthesized as deep red films via electropolymerization. The Co centers in 44 show unusual valence tautomerization behavior whereby the Co(II) state dominates at room temperature, whereas cooling the polymer leads to electron transfer from Co to a DBSQ chelate, and the formation of Co(III) states with significantly different magnetic and optical properties.108
