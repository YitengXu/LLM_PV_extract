Therefore, the surface area of photocatalysts plays an important role in photocatalytic processes.20 Moreover, the size, shape and crystallinity of the photocatalysts, also have a significant effect on their activity, while these structural characteristics are determined by the preparation method.21–23Up to now, various methods have been employed to synthesize photocatalysts. Among these methods, hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis is a well-established approach for the preparation of various functional nanomaterials with desired micro/nanostructures for a variety of potential applications , e.g., electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis and biomedicine.24–26 Usually, the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals are initiated during the thermal process. In particular, the formation of crystalline products through a hydrothermal or solvothermal process can be produced at temperatures substantially lower than those required by solid-state or vapor reactions.27 However, conventional heating in a hydrothermal or solvothermal process is inevitably confronted with several disadvantages, such as sharp thermal gradients throughout the bulk solution, slow reaction kinetics and nonuniform reaction conditions.28–30 Therefore, these conventional thermodynamic methods have been recognized to be inefficient, time-consuming, and relatively limiting.31Recently, microwave heating has been developed into an efficient method for the fabrication of nanomaterials. Microwave irradiation is electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range 0.3 to 300 GHz which corresponds to wavelengths of 1 mm to 1 m. All domestic microwave ovens or dedicated microwave reactors for chemical synthesis operate at a frequency of 2.45 GHz (corresponding to a wavelength of 12.24 cm) to avoid interference with telecommunication and cellular phone frequencies. Microwave irradiation induces interaction of the dipole moment of polar molecules or molecular ionic aggregates with alternating electronic and magnetic fields, causing molecular-level heating which leads to homogeneous and quick thermal reactions with low thermal gradients.32–34 Obviously, a low thermal gradient is necessary to produce high-quality materials.35 It should be noticed that the thermal gradient in a microwave process is related to the penetration depth (skin depth) which depends on the kind and mass (or volume) of the solutes and solvents. In a microwave process, the loss tangent (tan δ) provides a measure for the ability of a material to convert electromagnetic energy into heat at a given frequency and temperature. Because the penetration depth is inversely proportional to the loss tangent, the ability of a solution to absorb microwave energy is affected by the penetration depth. In general, solvents can be classified as high (tan δ > 0.5), medium (tan δ 0.1–0.5), and low microwave absorbing (tan δ < 0.1) solvents.36 Solvents with high loss tangents (measured at room temperature and 2.45 GHz) such as ethylene glycol (1.35), water (0.123), ethanol (0.941) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.825) are suitable solvents for microwave chemistry.36,37 Furthermore, the thermal gradient in the microwave process will be lower under stirring. If the microwave-assisted process is performed in a closed vessel under high pressure and stirring, more energy input at the same temperature and enormous acceleration in reaction time can be achieved, which means that a reaction which under conventional hydrothermal or solvothermal conditions would take several hours can be completed over the course of minutes or a reaction that would not proceed previously will now proceed, typically, with higher yields.31,38,39 What is more, it is possible to program and to control the different synthesis steps.40 Compared with other solution-phase synthetic methods by conventional heating, microwave hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis has been accepted as a promising method for rapid heating, higher reaction rate and selectivity, lower reaction temperature, shorter reaction time, homogeneous thermal transmission, and phase purity with better yields.41–47 Microwave heating techniques are potential methods for the scale-up industrial production of high-quality nanomaterials.37,48–52In this work, we summarize various semiconductor nanomaterials including semiconductor oxides and sulfides, Bi-based oxides, as well as nanocomposites including carbon nanotubes (CNT)-based and graphene-based composites via microwave-assisted solution-phase synthesis. Application of these nanomaterials in photocatalysis for the degradation of pollutants in water or air, removal of Cr(VI) and hydrogen evolution is also demonstrated. They show improved photocatalytic activities compared with the ones synthesized via conventional methods.2 Semiconductive oxidesSemiconductive oxides have attracted considerable attention due to their wide application in photocatalysis.53–63 At present, ZnO and TiO2 have been proven to be promising photocatalysts due to their intriguing optical and electrical properties, low cost and ease of availability.64–66 However, their use is restricted to UV light due to their intrinsically wide band gap (Eg) and the quick recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs has significantly decreased their photocatalytic performance.2.1 ZnOZnO with a Eg of 3.2–3.37 eV has been widely studied for a range of environmental applications.67–72 Up to now, various methods have been developed to prepare ZnO photocatalysts, which include hydrolysis in a polyol medium,73 template methods,74 chemical precipitation,75 thermal oxidation process,76 sol–gel methods,77 electrochemical deposition,78 vapor-phase process,79 hydrothermal synthesis80,81 and microwave heating.82,83 Unfortunately, the synthesized products in many cases contain appreciable amounts of admixtures due to the incomplete decomposition of precursors. Microwave heating processese are favorable to produce high-quality ZnO materials by minimizing contamination in grown ZnO crystals.41 Recently, many studies on the microwave irradiation synthesis of ZnO with a variety of morphologies, such as nanowires,41 nanorods,84–86 nanoneedles,87 hollow structures and self-assembled architectures,88 were widely reported, and these ZnO materials exhibited excellent photocatalytic performances.ZnO nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 1(a), synthesised via a microwave-assisted reaction of ZnSO4 in aqueous solution (20 ml, 0.1 M) using a microwave synthesis system under magnetic stirring (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) at 150 °C for 5–25 min, were found to have an optimal photocatalytic performance for the reduction of Cr(VI) (K2Cr2O7, concentration: 10 mg l−1) with a reduction rate of 81% under UV irradiation (500 W high-pressure Hg lamp).89Fig. 1(b) displays ZnO rod-assembled microspheres from Zn(NO3)3 in aqueous solution (∼65 ml) by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method using a MDS-8 microwave system (Sineo, China) in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) at 180 °C for 30 min.90 The microspheres are assembled from ZnO rods with diameter and length of 300 and 1 μm, respectively, and the ends of the ZnO rods are even and regular hexagons which is typically characteristic of wurtzite ZnO crystallites. The ZnO microspheres exhibited a very high degradation rate (100%) of the dyes MB (methylene blue), MO (methyl orange) and rhodamine B (RhB) (concentration: 1.25 mg l−1) under 365 nm light irradiation from a UV lamp.90 The MB degradation rate of commercial ZnO powder was found to be inferior to the as-prepared ZnO microspheres due to the lower specific surface area (7.02 m2 g−1 for the commercial powder and 12.56 m2 g−1 for the as-obtained sample). Fig. 1  SEM images of ZnO samples with (a) a sheet structure, (reproduced with permission from ref. 89) (b) rod-assembled microspheres, (reproduced with permission from ref. 90) (c) hexagonal prism, (reproduced with permission from ref. 91) (d) peanut-like structures, (reproduced with permission from ref. 91) (e) dumbbell-shaped structures, (reproduced with permission from ref. 92) and (f) hollow tubular structures, (reproduced with permission from ref. 93). Zhang and Zhu91 prepared ZnO with various morphologies by a microwave-assisted solvothermal method using a microwave synthesis system (MDS-6, Sineo, China) at 200 °C for 30 min. Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (1 mmol) was used as the reactant and a mixture of water (15 ml) and ethylene glycol (EG, 15 ml) was used as the solvent. The morphology of the prepared samples could be controlled by changing the mixing ratio of EG to water, such as hexagonal prisms with two linked segments (water:EG = 1:1) in Fig. 1(c), and peanut-like structures (water:EG = 1:2) in Fig. 1(d). The high EG content restricts the longitudinal growth of ZnO and hinders the formation of the 1D structure. The samples had a high photocatalytic activities with a maximum degradation rate of 98% in the degradation of MO (20 mg l−1) after 40 min reaction under UV light irradiation (300 W high pressure Hg lamp with a maximum emission at about 365 nm), which was much higher than that of commercial ZnO powder (50%) after a 60 min reaction. The reason was ascribed to their higher specific area.91A dumbbell-shaped ZnO photocatalyst with its surface covered by a lot of small particles, as shown in Fig. 1(e), could be synthesized by microwave heating using a domestic microwave oven at a power of 400 W for 5 min, followed by 240 W for 10 min.92 Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (5 g) was used as the reactant and a mixture of water (30 ml) and NH4OH (8 ml) was used as the solvent. These small particles increased the surface area of the prepared ZnO and enhanced its light absorption. The photocatalytic activity of the prepared dumbbell-shaped ZnO photocatalyst was evaluated by the degradation of MB (15 mg l−1) under UV irradiation (300 W high-pressure Hg lamp). A maximum degradation rate of 99.6% was achieved after 75 min irradiation, which is attributed to the ability of the dumbbell-shaped microstructure to absorb a large fraction of UV light.92By optimizing the reaction time, temperature and microwave power, Chen and Lo93 synthesized hexagonal ZnO microtubes with hollow tubular structures from Zn(CH3COO)2 in aqueous solution (50 ml, 1.0 M). The microwave hydrothermal method was carried out using a microwave digestion system (Ethos Touch Control, Milestone Co., Italy) under the desired level of irradiation (400 or 700 W) for a specific time (1, 3, or 5 h) and temperature (348, 373 or 403 K). The optimal conditions for hexagonal ZnO microtubes in their study were found to be 373 K at a power of 400 W for 3 h. These hexagonal ZnO microtubes (Fig. 1(f)) have well faceted ends and side surfaces with a large specific surface area of 380.41 m2 g−1, while the specific surface area of commercial ZnO (Fluka, USA) is only 5.2 m2 g−1. Therefore, they exhibited a better photocatalytic capability for the degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (365 nm, 400 W) compared to commercial ZnO powders.2.2 TiO2Similar to ZnO, TiO2 (Eg = 3.0–3.3 eV) is a more widely used oxide photocatalyst because TiO2 is more stable than ZnO in aqueous solution.2,11,14,58,70,94–99 Therefore, TiO2 has attracted more interest for environmental applications in recent years.18,100 Many synthetic methods have been reported for the preparation of TiO2 nanostructures, including sol–gel reactions,101,102 hydrothermal reactions,103–105 solvothermal reactions,106 template methods,107 anodic oxidation,108,109 chemical vapor deposition110 and reaction in reverse micelles.111,112 Nano-TiO2 with various morphologies and shapes such as nanorods,113 nanotubes,108,114 nanowires115,116 and nanospheres117 can be produced, which depends upon the synthetic methods. The traditional synthesis processes normally require long reaction times, high energy-consumption or involve special conditions.118,119 Especially, the sizes or diameters of the TiO2 nanomaterials obtained from the template and electrochemical anodization methods are often large, which lead to the low BET surface areas.120Currently many studies have adopted microwave heating to prepare TiO2,17,121–123 yielding better crystallinity than Degussa P25 TiO2.122 Cheng et al.124 compared the microwave and conventional heating treatments in preparing nanocrystalline TiO2 and found that the microwave heating promoted the phase transformation of TiO2 from anatase to rutile. Will et al.125 reported the microwave hydrothermal treatment of colloidal TiO2 suspensions. The results showed that the microwave treatment allowed for a rapid heating rate and recrystallization, resulting in highly nanocrystalline material and reduced process time and energy with respect to the conventional hydrothermal treatment. Yu et al.126 reported a microwave-assisted hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of rutile TiO2 mesocrystals with high purity and good crystallinity. The reaction was carried out by heating TiCl3 solution (10 ml) at 200 °C for 1 min under microwave irradiation (Ethos TC, Milestone). The resulting 1D rutile nanowires can easily assemble into 3D hierarchical architectures without the help of surfactants or additives, as shown in Fig. 2(a). As revealed by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image (Fig. 2(b)), the superstructure is composed of individual nanowires which are single-crystalline in nature with an average diameter of about 7.5 nm and an aspect ratio of about 267. The sample showed an excellent photocatalytic activity for NO (400 ppb) removal in air under the irradiation of a 300 W tungsten halogen lamp (simulated solar light) and UV-A fluorescent lamps (UV light) due to its well crystallized rutile phase, low band gap energy and fast electron transfer properties.126 Fig. 2  (a) SEM and (b) HRTEM images of the self-assembled rutile TiO2. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 126). The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is found to be related not only to the crystallinity of TiO2 but also the surface area.17 Nanocrystalline TiO2 particles with a mesoporous structural network will be more promising because light harvesting can be further enhanced due to the enlarged surface area and multiple scattering.127 Wang et al.128 presented a rapid formation of active, mesoporous, and crystalline TiO2 photocatalysts. TiO2 nanopowders with worm hole-like pores were prepared by a modified sol–gel synthesis of titanium tetra-isopropoxide using tetraecylamine as a self-assembly micelle, accelerated by a microwave hydrothermal process. Under microwave irradiation, the temperature of the reaction solution is raised so rapidly that a large amount of nuclei can be generated in a very short time, which inhibits the crystal growth of the product and results in a smaller crystallite size and larger specific surface area.122 The surface area of the sample prepared using a conventional hydrothermal process was found to be considerably lower than that of the microwave hydrothermal process. This is because in over a longer duration (>3 h) for conventional heating and cooling, Ostwald ripening might take place, forming larger crystal sizes.129 Due to the high-surface area and good crystallinity, the nanopowders exhibited a high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB (1 × 10−5 M) under UV-visible irradiation for 90 min, which is superior to the commercial P25 and TiO2 prepared by the conventional hydrothermal process. Madras et al.97 used hydrazine hydrate to improve the mesoporous structure of nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 synthesized by microwave irradiation of an ethanol solution (∼48 ml) of titanium isopropoxide in a domestic microwave oven at a power of 800 W for 5 min. The photocatalytic activity of the nanometric TiO2 in the degradation of dyes (Orange G, Remazol Brill Blue, Alizarin Red S, MB, RhB, concentration: 50 ppm) under UV light irradiation (125 W high pressure Hg lamp) was significantly higher than that of commercial P25.Mathew et al.94 synthesized TiO2 nanostructures with different morphologies like cubes, spheres, and rods by a simple microwave irradiation technique using TiCl3 as the titanium precursor. Fig. 3(a)–(c) show the HRTEM images of the TiO2 nanoparticles including S1 (nanocubes), S2 (nanospheres) and S3 (nanorods). The morphological differences were attributed to the ion assisted growth of the crystallites which might be different for OH− assisted growth in the case of S1, Cl− assisted growth in S2, and Cl− and NH4+ assisted growth in S3.94 The shape evolution originated from the different adsorption capabilities of these ions in various planes during the growth of the particles.130 The MB (4 × 10−5 M) degradation ability under UV light irradiation (100 W Hg lamp) for the nanocubes was found to be superior to the nanospheres and the nanorods, as shown in Fig. 3(d), which should be attributed to the higher surface area of the nanocubes. These TiO2 nanostructures showed higher photocatalytic activities than the commercial Degussa P25 TiO2.

(Reproduced with permission from ref. 94). 2.3 Doped oxidesAlthough ZnO and TiO2 are considered to be promising photocatalysts, their universal use is restricted to UV light which only occupies 3–5% of the total solar spectrum due to their intrinsically wide band gaps, and in the meantime the quick recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs has significantly decreased their photocatalytic performances. Doping is a very useful way to improve the charge separation or tune the band gap in semiconductor systems.60,131–134 Recent progress has shown that the doping of semiconductor photocatalysts by nonmetal elements,135–137 typically N, S or F, or the incorporation of metal nanomaterials with a work function lower than the CB of the semiconductor photocatalyst,138–142 such as Au, Ag, Pt or Fe, can solve the above-mentioned problems and enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO or TiO2 in the UV or visible light regions. In the photocatalysis process, metal nanomaterials can act as excellent electron-acceptor/transport materials to effectively facilitate the migration of photo-induced electrons and hinder the charge recombination in electron-transfer processes due to the electronic interactions between themselves and the semiconductor photocatalysts,143,144 while nonmetal elements can tune the band gaps and extend the photo-response into the visible light region,98,145,146 which is regarded as an effective approach to utilize solar light. In addition, some noble metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag, Pt) exhibit unique optical properties, owing to the excitation of resonant collective oscillations of the conduction electrons by electromagnetic radiation; the localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR).147–150 The frequency of the SPR can be spectrally tuned by changing the size, shape, and dielectric environment of the particles.147,148 SPR can dramatically amplify the absorption of visible light and is therefore utilized to develop the efficient visible-light-driven plasmonic photocatalysts.148,149,151In recent years researchers have reported several approaches for the incorporation of metal nanoparticles including sputtering, photochemical deposition, impregnation and hydrothermal methods,96,152,153 and for non-metal doping such as ion implantation, sputtering, sol–gel, chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal methods.154–157 However, the conventional preparation methods have some disadvantages. For example, in sputtering it is difficult to deposit metal particles inside high aspect ratio porous structures due to the preferred nucleation and growth of nanoparticles at the pore mouth. UV induced photochemical deposition of metal nanoparticles cannot be used due to the short penetration depth of UV light in ZnO or TiO2. Impregnation allows poor control over the particle size, dispersion and composition. Hydrothermal methods and sol–gel techniques require a long synthesis time and high calcining temperatures. Recently, described as follows, a microwave-assisted method has been widely used to synthesize the doped ZnO or TiO2 structures.2.3.1 Sn–ZnO. Sn is considered as one of the most important doping elements for ameliorating the photocatalytic activity of ZnO.158–160 Feng et al.161 synthesized nano-structured ZnO and Sn-doped ZnO photocatalysts through the reaction of a solution (15 ml) of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (5 g), SnCl2·2H2O (0.1 g) and glucose (15 g) in water by microwave heating in a domestic microwave oven at a power of 800 W for 1 min. The doping greatly changed the structure and morphology of ZnO, increased the dye adsorption and light absorption, and improved the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO in the degradation of MB (40 mg l−1) under sunlight irradiation was greatly enhanced by Sn doping.2.3.2 Ag–TiO2. Ag is one of the most suitable candidates for industrial applications due to its low cost and ease of preparation. Incorporation of Ag into TiO2 is observed to enhance the photocatalytic activity and stability of TiO2 by promoting the phase transformations, inhibiting the growth of the anatase crystallite and decreasing the band gap.162,163Lu et al.164 prepared Ag-modified TiO2 (Ag–TiO2) by heating a TiO2 and AgNO3 solution (20 ml) under microwave irradiation in a microwave digestion system (Sineo, China) at 600 W and 150 °C for 30 min. Compared with the hydrothermal method, Ag–TiO2 with small crystallite size and high crystallinity was obtained by the microwave-assisted method. In the photodegradation of gaseous toluene under UV light irradiation (28 W UV lamp with main wavelength of 254 nm), Ag–TiO2 exhibited a better photostability compared with pure TiO2 and the optimal Ag/Ti molar ratio was found to be 1%.Chen et al.165 prepared TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 nanotubes by a hydrothermal method and microwave-assisted preparation, respectively. 0.10 g TiO2–NTs and 30 ml glycol containing 4.0 × 10−4 mol KOH were used in the microwave process. The evaluation of the photocatalytic activity showed that Ag–TiO2 with 0.8% Ag achieved a 87.91% degradation rate in the degradation of RhB, which was much higher than those for pure TiO2 nanotubes (45.70%) and commercial P25 (70.34%) under UV light irradiation (9 W UV lamp with main wavelength of 365 nm).2.3.3 Pt–TiO2. The effect of Pt on photocatalytic activity has been studied by several research groups.166,167 Liu et al.168 deposited Pt nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface by microwave heating of an EG solution (26.53 ml) of H2PtCl6 in a microwave oven (National NN-S327WF, 700 W) for 50 s. They found that the spherical and uniform Pt nanoparticles with sizes 2–6 nm were uniformly dispersed on TiO2 by microwave irradiation and their amount was about 1 wt%. The Pt-doped TiO2 (Pt–TiO2) exhibited a better photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of MB (0.21 mM) under UV light irradiation than the pure TiO2.Grimes et al.169 deposited ultrafine Pt nanoparticles in situ within high aspect ratio TiO2 nanotubes arrays via a rapid microwave-assisted solvothermal approach by using a MARS-5 microwave digestion system with a power of 300 W. The Pt-TiO2 was shown to greatly promote the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and water vapor into methane under the exposure of AM 1.5 G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) for 1 h, which was attributed to the homogeneous distribution of the metal co-catalyst nanoparticles over the TiO2 nanotube array surface, providing a large number of active reduction sites.1692.3.4 F-TiO2. Many studies revealed that F doping can promote the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by slowing down the radiative recombination process of photogenerated electrons and holes.170–172 He et al.173 prepared a F-doped TiO2 (F-TiO2) spherical photocatalyst via a microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis technique at 180 °C for 1 h using TiO2 microspheres as a precursor. By changing the concentration of NaF, F-TiO2 microspheres with different sizes and morphologies could be achieved. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the photocatalytic degradation of MO (50 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (300 W medium pressure Hg lamp) for 2 h. The results showed that the samples exhibited higher photocatalytic activity compared with the undoped one.2.3.5 N-TiO2. Among anionic dopants of TiO2, N is the most effective for photocatalytic applications.174 The improved photocatalytic activity is described by either mixing the N 2p state with an O 2p state on the top of the valence band or creating a N-induced mid-gap level.1Peng et al.175 prepared both interstitial N-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) by microwave-assisted reaction of a mixed solution of P25 (0.8 g), urea (1.2 g) and EG (40 ml) in a multi-mode microwave oven (MAS-II, Sineo) at 1000 W above 135 °C for 10–30 min, and substitutional N-TiO2 by annealing P25 TiO2 under an NH3 flow at 600 °C for 3 h. 3.7 mol% N was incorporated into the TiO2 prepared by the microwave method (interstitial N-TiO2). In comparison, a lower N content of 2.2 mol% was detected in the substitutional N-TiO2. Both substitutional and interstitial N impurities greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in the degradation of MO (20 mg l−1) or phenol (100 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (1000 W Xe lamp). Moreover, the visible light photocatalytic activity of interstitial N-doped TiO2 was higher than that of substitutional N-doped TiO2 and P25.Varlikli et al.176 prepared N-TiO2 nanoparticles by using alkyl and alcohol amines as nitrogen sources through microwave and hydrothermal growth methods. A nitrogen source (18.75 mmol) was added into a colloidal TiO2 solution (40 ml) under microwave irradiation in a CEM MARS5 microwave reaction system at 90 °C and 145 °C for 30 min or at 200 °C for 12 h in a convection oven (hydrothermal method). The N species in the TiO2 lattice were interstitial impurities. N-TiO2 exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB (1 × 10−5 M) under 1000 W Xe lamp irradiation compared to the undoped one.2.4 Bi-based oxideBi-based oxides such as Bi2O3, BiPO4, BiVO4, BiFeO3, Bi2WO6, Bi2MoO6 have been widely investigated because of their excellent photocatalytic activities in decomposing organic compounds,177 splitting water178 and reducing NO.179 These materials with delocalized conjugated π structures have been proven to efficiently provoke a rapid photo-induced charge separation and a relatively slow charge recombination in electron-transfer processes.180 Up to now, different methods have been utilized to prepare Bi-based nanostructures, including chemical vapor deposition,181 sonochemical methods,182,183 sol–gel methods,184 co-precipitation,185 solid state reactions,186,187 reverse-microemulsion,188 a molten salt method189 and hydrothermal treatment.190–192 Recently, rapid microwave irradiation method has been employed to synthesize Bi-based compounds.193,1942.4.1 Bi2O3. Bi2O3 is an important metal oxide semiconductor with good electrical conductivity, favourable thermal properties, and a direct band gap ranging from 2 to 3.9 eV.195 It has proved to be an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting and pollutant decomposition under visible light irradiation.196–198 Various morphologies including nanoparticles,199 nanorods,200 nanotubes,201 nanobelts,202 nanowires,203 nanofibers,204 thin films,205 and flower-like hierarchical structures206 have been prepared. It has been widely reported that microwave irradiation can control the reaction kinetics to accelerate reactions and even to promote the formation of metastable phases.207,208 Amorphous β-Bi2O3 nanoparticles could be synthesized directly via a liquid phase microwave reaction (500 W, 90 min) using Bi(NO3)3 and urea as starting materials.209 While conventional heating in an oil bath has been used, β-Bi2O3 is hard to prepare directly without post-calcination.Cao et al.210 synthesized Bi@Bi2O3 microspheres via a microwave-assisted solvothermal route in a domestic microwave oven with a power of 480 W for 2.5 min. Glucose (8 mmol) was selected as the reductant, BiCl3 (1 mmol) as the bismuth source, and EG (40 ml) as the solvent. As shown in Fig. 4, the microspheres are relatively homogeneous and have smooth surfaces. Their average diameter is 1.60 ± 0.70 μm. The photocatalytic activities of the Bi@Bi2O3 microspheres were evaluated by the photodegradation of RhB (5 × 10−5 mol l−1) and MO (5 × 10−5 mol l−1) dyes under UV light irradiation (250 W high pressure Hg lamp with main emission wavelength 365 nm). The degradation rates for Bi@Bi2O3 microspheres reached a maximum value of 96.6% for RhB and 100% for MO after 4 h irradiation.

Recently, BiPO4 nanostructures (Eg = 3.35–4.09 eV) have been explored for their photocatalytic abilities in the degradation of organics under UV light irradiation.211–214 Chen et al.213 explored a facile and rapid microwave irradiation method for the synthesis of BiPO4 nanostructures with various morphologies and phases using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.485 g) and NaH2PO4·2H2O (0.156 g) as precursors in different solvents (30 ml) including a glycerol–H2O mixture (R1); H2O (R2); mannitol (R3); a diethylene glycol (DEG)–H2O mixture (R4); and pure EG (R5). Fig. 5(a)–(e) show typical SEM images of the BiPO4 samples prepared in solvents R1–R5. In Fig. 5(a), it can be observed that the product is composed of well-dispersed nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm. When H2O was used as the solvent, the BiPO4 sample is composed of needle-like nanostructures with lengths of 1–3 μm (Fig. 5(b)). In mannitol solution, short rod-like BiPO4 nanostructures with diameters of 100–200 nm and lengths of 500 nm were fabricated (Fig. 5(c)). It is observed that there are many cracks on the surface and hollows at the ends of the nanorods from the SEM image (inset of Fig. 5(c)). Fig. 5(d) reveals the fabrication of rice-like BiPO4 nanostructures with lengths of 300–400 nm in a DEG–H2O mixture. Its shape matches well with that of a typical rice grain with two sharp ends and a spheroid body. However, only uniform BiPO4 nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution from 20–50 nm are obtained when EG was used as the solvent, as depicted in Fig. 5(e). The shape evolution of BiPO4 crystals might be greatly ascribed to the variation of nucleation, diffusion and growth rates in the solvents with different viscosities.215–219 The BiPO4 products prepared using R1, R2, R3 and R4 exhibited highly crystalline hexagonal phases while the one using R5 should be monoclinic BiPO4. Their band gaps were about 3.71, 4.09, 3.79, 3.88 and 3.66 eV, respectively. It was found that the photocatalytic activities of these BiPO4 nanostructures in the degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) under UV and visible light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp) were closely related to their crystalline phases and band gaps. Hexagonal BiPO4 nanoparticles with a narrow band gap showed the highest photocatalytic performance with a degradation rate of about 100% after 80 min irradiation.

(Reproduced with permission from ref. 220). 2.4.3 BiFeO3. BiFeO3 is an important multiferroelectric and photocatalytic material owing to its high stability and narrow band gap around 2.1 eV.221–224 Various procedures have been developed to synthesize BiFeO3 nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanoparticles and nanospindles.225–227Lee et al.220 developed a simple microwave synthesis procedure for single-crystalline perovskite BiFeO3 nanocubes using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (1 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (1 mmol), Na2CO3 (20 mmol) and KOH (160.2 mmol) as the starting materials and water (15 ml) as the solvent. The microwave reaction was carried out at 180 °C for 30 min using a microwave oven (Mars-5, CEM). As shown in Fig. 5(f), BiFeO3 exhibits a well-defined cubic morphology with an average size of about 50–200 nm. The material showed a good photo-induced water oxidation activity.Wang et al.228 synthesized BiFeO3 by a facile preparation process assisted with microwave treatment using Bi(NO3)3, and Fe(NO3)3 as precursors in a domestic microwave oven at 100 °C for 20 min. The as-obtained BiFeO3 nanoparticles were highly crystallized and exhibited a single-phase perovskite structure. They showed high photocatalytic properties with a degradation rate of more than 98% in the decomposition of acid red 18 (20 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (15 W high pressure Hg lamp with 263.7 nm) for 10 h.Zhu et al.229 synthesized spherical perovskite-type BiFeO3 nanocrystals with diameters of 10–50 nm and hexagonal-shaped sillenite-type ones with sizes of 18–33 nm using Bi(NO3)3 and Fe(NO3)3 as the precursors under microwave irradiation (MARS-5, CEM) at 180 °C for 60 min. The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of RhB (10 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation using a 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm). The result showed that the sillenite-type BiFeO3 nanocrystals exhibited a higher photocatalytic ability (∼35%) at 3 h than the perovskite-type ones (20%), which could be ascribed to their small mean particle size and unique hexagonal morphology, and the structural characteristics of the sillenite-type compound.2292.4.4 Bi2WO6. Bi2WO6 (Eg = 2.6–2.8 eV) has proved to be an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting and pollutant decomposing under visible light irradiation because of its unique molecular and electronic versatility, reactivity, stability, etc.230–236 Bi2WO6 with various morphologies such as nanoplates,194,235 nanocages,237 nanofibres,238 nanospheres,239 nanodisks,240 flower-like,241 hierarchical235,242 and porous structures236 have been fabricated by tuning experimental parameters such as pH, surfactants or templates.Shen et al.194 synthesized nanosized Bi2WO6 by a microwave hydrothermal approach using Bi(NO3)3, NH3 and H2WO4 as the starting materials in aqueous solution (40 ml) in a microwave reaction system (MRAS-5, CEM, USA) and investigated the influence of the reaction conditions (including starting materials, concentration, reaction temperature, and holding time) on the phases and morphologies of the products. It was found that the reaction temperature and the holding time had a significant impact on the morphology of the products. The higher the reaction temperature or the longer the holding time was, the better crystallinity was obtained. The photocatalytic activity of the sample in the degradation of MB (10−5 M) under visible light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp, λ > 400 nm) for 100 min was much higher than that of the one prepared by the solid-state reaction. The reason may be derived from the larger surface area of Bi2WO6 prepared using the microwave hydrothermal method, which accelerated the photocatalytic reaction.194Li et al.179 reported a photocatalytic removal of 400 ppb level of NO in air under visible light irradiation (300 W commercial tungsten halogen lamp) by utilizing three dimensional (3D) hierarchical Bi2WO6 microspheres. A facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving Bi(NO3)3 and Na2WO4 in aqueous solution (40 ml) using a microwave system at 170 °C for 30 min was developed to synthesize the photocatalyst. A microwave induced nucleation aggregation ripening process was proposed for the synthesis of these hierarchical flower-like spheres, as shown in Scheme 1.179 It can be observed from Fig. 6 that the flower-like microstructures with an average diameter of about 3 μm are constructed by 2D nanosheets with a thickness of ∼10 nm. The aggregation and/or assembly of the nanosheets might produce abundant hierarchical pores on the nanoscale. The specific surface area of the hierarchical flower-like Bi2WO6 sample was found to be much higher than those of the samples prepared by the solid-state reaction or the hydrothermal reaction, which not only provided more active sites for the degradation of organic compounds, but also effectively promoted the separation of the electron–hole pairs.

Fig. 6  (a) Low-magnification and (b) high-magnification SEM images of flower-like Bi2WO6. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 179. Copyright (2010) American Chemical Society). Similarly, Chen et al.241 also reported the preparation of flower-like Bi2WO6via a microwave-assisted process in a microwave system (200 W, Discover S-Class, CEM) using Bi(NO3)3 and Na2WO4 as the starting materials in aqueous solution (∼10 ml) under magnetic stirring. The Bi2WO6 was able to efficiently degrade RhB (1 × 10−5 M) with a very high degradation rate of 99.9% under visible light irradiation (500 W Xe lamp, λ > 420 nm) for 80 min.Fu et al.193 synthesized Bi2WO6 nanosheets via a microwave-solvothermal process in a microwave reaction system (ETHOS TC, Milestone Inc.) at 160 °C for 2 h and 4 h using Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (4 mmol) and (NH4)10W12O41·5H2O (0.17 mmol) as the starting materials and EG (20 ml) as the solvent. As shown in Fig. 7, for the decomposition of RhB (10−5 mol l−1) under visible light irradiation (300 W halogen lamp, 420 nm < λ < 850 nm) for 5 h, the Bi2WO6 sample obtained by the microwave-solvothermal process shows higher photocatalytic activity than that of the sample obtained by the conventional hydrothermal process due to the larger specific surface area and the presence of more oxygen vacancies created by the microwave-assisted method.193 Fig. 7  Concentration changes of RhB at 554 nm as a function of the visible light irradiation time in the presence of photocatalysts: a) microwave 160 °C, 2 h; b) microwave 160 °C, 4 h; c) conventional 160 °C, 12 h. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 193). 2.4.5 BiVO4. BiVO4 (Eg = 2.3–2.6 eV) has recently been considered to be one of the most promising photocatalysts under visible light irradiation.243–248 Up to now, various BiVO4 structures including nanoparticles,249 nanofibres,250 nanosheets,251 nanoribbons,252 microtubes,183 microspheres,253 porous spheres,254 hollow peanut-like structures246 and dumbbell-like structures247 have been successfully fabricated.Li et al.255 synthesized hierarchical BiVO4 microspheres assembled from nanosheets by a hydrothermal process from aqueous Bi(NO3)3 and NH4VO3 solutions (∼50 ml) under microwave irradiation (300 W microwave reactor) at 180 °C for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 8, the sample consists of a large quantity of microspheres with diameters ranging from 2 to 5 mm and these BiVO4 microspheres are actually composed of many randomly grown nanosheets. These nanosheets interweave together, forming an open porous structure with a high specific surface area, which could facilitate the accessibility of reactants to the active sites within the meso-architectures. The BiVO4 architectures showed much better photocatalytic activity (91%) for the degradation of MB (8 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp, λ > 420 nm) in 210 min than the bulk BiVO4 solid microspheres (49%) and P25 (39%) due to their high specific surface areas and hierarchical mesoporous structures.255 Fig. 8  (a) Low magnification and (b) high magnification SEM images of BiVO4 3D architectures. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 255). Liu et al.256 prepared pure tetragonal and monoclinic phase BiVO4 from aqueous Bi(NO3)3 and NaVO3 solutions by a rapid microwave-assisted method using a domestic microwave oven at 120 W for different irradiation times. It was reported that tetragonal BiVO4 had a 2.9 eV band gap, while monoclinic BiVO4 with a 2.4 eV band gap had a characteristic visible light absorption besides the UV band.243 The phase converts irreversibly from tetragonal BiVO4 with small particle sizes (Fig. 9(a)) to monoclinic BiVO4 with highly crystallized and large sheets and some nanostrips (Fig. 9(b)) when the irradiation time was increased from 10 min to 40 min. The photocatalytic experiments using BiVO4 in the degradation of RhB (2 × 10−4 mol l−1) under visible light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp) showed that the variation of phase structures led to different photocatalytic properties and the photocatalytic degradation rate increased with increasing content of the monoclinic phase.

Bi2MoO6 (Eg = 2.6–2.71 eV), as a typical Aurivillius oxide, with excellent intrinsic physical and chemical properties, shows great potential in the utilization of solar energy.257–259 Many methods for preparing Bi2MoO6 catalysts, including solid-state reactions, co-precipitation and sol–gel methods, have been investigated over the years.259–261 Through the above methods, Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts with various morphologies have been synthesized to enhance their photocatalytic activities.261–264Xie et al.265 synthesized γ-Bi2MoO6 nanoplates by a microwave hydrothermal approach using Bi(NO3)3, NH3 and MoO3 as the starting materials in aqueous solution (50 ml) using a microwave reaction system (MARS-5, CEM, USA). It was found that γ-Bi2MoO6 nanocrystals could be formed indirectly with an intermediate phase of Bi2O3 in both the microwave hydrothermal and hydrothermal methods. However, the microwave hydrothermal approach required a relatively lower temperature and a shorter time to promote crystallization (120 °C/1 h or 140 °C/0.5 h) and its reaction conditions were milder compared with the hydrothermal method (140 °C/10 h or 180 °C/5 h). The samples exhibited a higher photocatalytic activity in the degradation of MB (10−5 M) solution under visible-light irradiation (500 W and 31 mW cm−2 Xe lamp) for 200 min than the ones synthesized by the conventional hydrothermal method.2.5 Other oxides2.5.1 CuO. The advanced 2D or 3D CuO architectures (Eg = 1.2–1.6 eV), self-assembled by prime building blocks, have been reported to be synthesized using conventional hydrothermal methods.266–274 However, the reported CuO architectures are usually of micrometer dimensions and few are on the nanoscale.Zhu and Qian275 prepared CuO hierarchical hollow nanostructures, assembled from nanosheets in n-octanol–[Cu(NH3)4]2+ aqueous solution (∼11 ml) through a microwave approach in a domestic microwave oven with a power output of 1000 W for 3 min. As shown in Fig. 10, the 3D hierarchical CuO nanospheres with hollow structure are assembled closely from nanosheets of about 10 nm in thickness and the thickness of the CuO nanosphere shell and the diameter of the cavity are about 100 and 400 nm, respectively. A self-assembly mechanism of an aggregation-then-growth process through a bubble template was proposed for the formation of the hollow hierarchical architectures.275 As illustrated in Scheme 2, under microwave irradiation, NH3 bubbles erupting from the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ aqueous solution on the n-octanol–aqueous liquid interface acted as templates for the aggregation of the CuO nuclei. The continuous aggregation process of 1D CuO occurred and hollow spheres assembled by nanosheets were finally formed. It can be seen in Fig. 11 that the obtained CuO hierarchical hollow nanostructures possess superior photocatalytic activities for the degradation of RhB (10−5 M) under UV-visible light irradiation for 100 min than the microsheets. The superior photocatalytic activity was related to the hierarchically aggregation-based CuO nanosheets, the smaller size of the building blocks of the hierarchical hollow nanospheres, and the effective separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes.275 Fig. 10  (a) Low magnification and (b) high magnification SEM images of CuO hierarchical hollow nanostructures.

Fig. 11  (a) Typical time-dependent absorption spectra of RhB solution in the presence of CuO hierarchical hollow nanospheres under UV-visible light irradiation, and (b) the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under different conditions: 1) in the absence of photocatalysts, 2) microsheets and 3) hierarchical hollow nanospheres.

Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor with a direct band gap of 2.0–2.3 eV.276–280 Its low cost, non-toxicity and good environmental acceptability make it a reasonable alternative for photocatalytic277,281,282 and photovoltaic applications.283 Much effort has been focused on the synthesis of Cu2O crystals with different shapes such as octahedra, whiskers,284 dodecahedra,285 polyhedra,286 nanocubes,287 nanopheres,288 nanowires,289 nanocages,290 multipods,291 hierarchical292 and hollow structures.293Zhang et al.294 synthesized Cu2O micro-/nanocrystals by using a liquid phase reduction process under microwave irradiation at 600 W for 5 min using a domestic microwave oven. CuSO4 was used as the starting material, glucose and hydrate hydrazine as the reducing agents, and macromolecule surfactants as the templates. As shown in Fig. 12, Cu2O crystals with spherical, strip, octahedral and dandelion shapes are synthesized. The different morphologies of Cu2O crystals result in different specific surface areas, direct band gaps and UV-vis absorbencies. The photocatalytic results (Fig. 13) of the degradation of RhB (5 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (500 W tungsten halogen lamp) for 4 h shows that the morphology significantly affects the photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic activities of the Cu2O crystals synthesized by the microwave method were much higher than those made by other methods as reported in the previous literature.295,296 Fig. 12  SEM images of Cu2O with different morphologies: (a) spheres, (b) strips, (c) octahedra, (d) dandelions.

(Reproduced with permission from ref. 294). 2.5.3 α-Fe2O3. α-Fe2O3, an n-type semiconductor (Eg = 1.9–2.2 eV), is the most stable iron oxide under ambient conditions.297–306 Due to its environmental friendliness, low fabrication cost and high resistance to corrosion, α-Fe2O3 has applications in a variety of fields such as photocatalysis,307 lithium ion batteries,308 gas sensors,308 photoanodes309 and organic pollutant adsorption.310Cao and Zhu311 developed a one-step NaCl-assisted microwave solvothermal method for the preparation of monodisperse α-Fe2O3 mesoporous microspheres in a microwave synthesis system (MDS-6, Sineo, China) at 120 °C for 30 min. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.404 g) was used as the iron source, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.111 g) acted as a surfactant in the presence of NaCl (0.117 g) in a mixed solvent of H2O and ethanol (30 ml). α-Fe2O3 mesoporous microspheres were formed via oriented attachment of α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals. High photocatalytic activities in the degradation of salicylic acid (20 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (high pressure Hg lamp) were observed for these α-Fe2O3 microspheres.2.5.4 Fe2(MoO4)3. Traditionally, Fe2(MoO4)3 was prepared via high temperature solid-state reactions312–314 or hydrothermal processes.315 Chen et al.316 synthesized pancake-like Fe2(MoO4)3 microstructures using microwave-assisted hydrothermal reaction in a microwave system (200 W, Discover S-Class, CEM) using Fe(NO3)3 and (NH4)6Mo7O4 as starting materials in aqueous solution (∼28 ml) at 150 °C for 1 min under magnetic stirring. As shown in Fig. 14(a), the as-prepared product is composed of pancake-like Fe2(MoO4)3 microstructures with relatively good dispersion and uniform diameters of ∼5 μm. A high magnification SEM image shown in Fig. 14(b) reveals that the building blocks of such nanoarchitectures are nanosheets of ∼40 nm mean thickness. The photocatalytic properties of the product in the degradation of bromopyrogallol red (10 mg l−1) were investigated under visible light irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp (λ > 420 nm) for 40 min and a 68% degradation rate was achieved. Fig. 14  (a) Low magnification and (b) high magnification SEM images of the as-prepared Fe2(MoO4)3. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 316). 2.5.5 Zn2GeO4. Zn2GeO4, an important wide-gap semiconductor material with an Eg of 4.68 eV, has received great attention for various applications due to its interesting optical properties.317,318 Several reports have appeared on the fabrication of Zn2GeO4 by surfactant-assisted hydrothermal methods319 and chemical vapor transport methods.320Chen et al.321 prepared well-aligned Zn2GeO4 nanorod bundles from Zn(CH3COO)2 and GeO2 in aqueous solution (∼15 ml) via a facile microwave-assisted solution-phase approach using a microwave system (100 W, Discover S-Class, CEM) at 170 °C for 15 min under magnetic stirring. As shown in Fig. 15(a), the as-prepared product is composed of abundant Zn2GeO4 nanorod bundles with relatively good dispersion. A high magnification SEM image of an individual nanorod bundle reveals that the as-prepared nanobundles are constructed of many nanorods of about 800 nm in length (Fig. 15(b)). These rod-like building blocks are arranged side by side and bound tightly. The photocatalytic properties of as-prepared Zn2GeO4 nanobundles were studied and they exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with a degradation rate of 99% in the degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (100 W high-pressure Hg lamp) for 20 min. Fig. 15  (a) Low-magnification and (b) high-magnification SEM images of as-prepared Zn2GeO4 nanorod bundles.

However, sulfide photocatalysts sometimes suffer from instability owing to photo-corrosion in practical applications.143.1 CdSCdS, (Eg = 2.25–2.49 eV), one of the most important IV–VI group semiconductors, is a potential candidate for use in solar cells, photoelectric devices and photocatalysts.70,324–328 Due to its narrow band gap, CdS is an excellent photocatalyst with visible light response.329,330 Recently, several methods have been successfully applied for the preparation of CdS nanomaterials, including hydrothermal synthesis,331,332 UV irradiation technology333 and microwave-assisted reactions.334–336Yang et al.337 reported the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles using Na2S and CdCl2 as precursors in aqueous solution (50 ml) under microwave irradiation using a domestic microwave oven for 10 min. The as-prepared sample had a uniform morphology and high purity. The effects of pH and solution temperature on the photocatalytic oxidation of MO (2 × 10−3 M) in CdS suspensions under UV illumination (125 W high pressure Hg lamp) were investigated. The photodegradation rate was found to decrease with increasing pH and solution temperature. Although CdS is an excellent visible light photocatalyst, the key disadvantages of the serious photo-corrosion and high toxicity of CdS limit its application as an environmentally friendly photocatalyst.3.2 ZnSZnS, a type of wide band gap II–VI compound semiconductor material (Eg = 3.58–3.8 eV), can behave as an effective catalyst and has attracted attention in the fields of photosynthesis, photocatalytic pollutant treatment and hydrogen production.338–350 Esmaili and Habibi-Yangjeh351 proposed a fast and template-free method for the preparation of nanocrystalline ZnS using Zn(CH3COO)2 and thioacetamide (TAA) solution (50 ml) in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulphate [EMIM][EtSO4], a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL), under microwave irradiation using a domestic microwave oven at 55% output for 4 min. The photocatalytic activity of the nanocrystalline ZnS prepared in the presence of the RTIL for the degradation of MB (3.13 × 10−5 M) under UV light irradiation (UV Osram lamp of 125 W with the major fraction of the radiation occurring at 365 nm) were better than that of the sample prepared in water.3.3 Zn1−xCdxS/Zn1−xCuxSBecause of its large band gap, ZnS absorbs only UV light, but its absorbance can easily be tuned by doping with various metal ions.352,353 It was reported that Cu-doped353,354 and Cd-doped ZnS355,356 are active photocatalysts for organic pollutant degradation or hydrogen generation under visible light irradiation. Therefore, preparation of Zn1−xCdxS or Zn1−xCuxS nanoparticles using a solid state reaction355 or hydrothermal method357–359 has been a very popular research area in recent years. Generally, these methodologies often involve very complicated processes, cost a great deal of energy and much time, or need strict experimental conditions. Therefore, several studies have been reported to apply microwave irradiation to the synthesis of Zn1−xCdxS or Zn1−xCuxS.Poormohammadi and Habibi-Yangjeh360,361 prepared a series of Zn1−xCuxS (x = 0–0.15) and Zn1−xCdxS nanoparticles (x = 0–1), respectively, in a precursor solution (100 ml) containing TAA, Zn(CH3COO)2, Cu(CH3COO)2 or Cd(CH3COO)2 under microwave irradiation for several minutes using a domestic microwave oven (1000 W) with 55% output. The photocatalytic degradation of MB by the samples was investigated under visible light irradiation (tungsten lamp with 500 W). The result indicated that Zn0.97Cu0.03S and Zn0.8Cd0.2S nanoparticles exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity among the prepared samples due to their high visible light absorption and low electron–hole recombination when Cu2+ or Cd2+ ions were present in the lattice.Li et al.362 synthesized ZnxCd1−xS nanorods using Cd(CH3COO)2, Zn(CH3COO)2 and (C2H5)2NCS2Na as the starting reagents in aqueous solution (20 ml) by a microwave method (Explorer48, CEM Co., USA) at a controllable temperature of 140–160 °C for 10 min under magnetic stirring. It was found that the ZnxCd1−xS nanorods prepared by the microwave method were more homogeneous than those synthesized by conventional solvothermal reactions. The Zn0.28Cd0.72S exhibited the highest efficiency of 96% in the degradation of MO (6.1 × 10−5 M) under visible light irradiation (500 W halogen lamp, 420 nm < λ < 800 nm) for 6 h. Its photocatalytic activity is found to be better than that of the sample prepared by conventional solvothermal reactions under the same degradation conditions, as shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 16  Photocatalytic degradation of MO in the presence of Zn0.28Cd0.72S prepared by a conventional solvothermal reaction and by microwave synthesis. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 362. Copyright (2010) American Chemical Society). 3.4 AgInS2So far, many methods for preparing AgInS2 (Eg = 1.87–2.03 eV)363,364 powders and films have been reported, such as solvothermal synthesis approaches,323,365,366 hot press methods,367 spray pyrolysis techniques368,369 and hot wall epitaxy methods.366 Li et al.11 synthesized orthorhombic phase AgInS2 nanoparticles by a microwave hydrothermal method in aqueous solution (∼15 ml) containing Ag2SO4, InCl3 and TAA using a microwave system (Explorer 48, CEM Co., USA) at 200 °C for 20 min under magnetic stirring. The photocatalytic activity of AgInS2 in the degradation of MO (5 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation using a 500 W tungsten–halogen lamp with cutoff filters (420–800 nm) for 9 h was investigated and a ∼95% MO degradation rate was achieved. Their studies showed that the photocorrosion or photodissolution of photocatalysts did not occur on the surface of the AgInS2 photocatalyst in the photocatalytic reaction and AgInS2 was stable under visible light irradiation.3.5 CdIn2S4Attempts have been made to synthesize photoactive CdIn2S4 (Eg = 2.12–2.29 eV) by chemical spray pyrolysis, vacuum evaporation, hot wall epitaxy, hydrothermal, iodine-vapor transport and horizontal Bridgman methods.370–373 Recently, Kale et al.374 demonstrated the synthesis of nanostructured CdIn2S4 with different morphologies (marigold flower, nanoparticle spheres, pyramids, nanotubes) using a hydrothermal method or a microwave method. Cd(NO3)2, In2(NO3)2 and thiourea were used as the precursors and the microwave reaction was performed in a microwave digestion system (SEM XL 30). In the microwave synthesis, the product was formed within 15 min, whereas by the hydrothermal method more than 24 h reaction time was required. CdIn2S4 structures with different morphologies were observed in both synthesis methods and a possible formation mechanism is displayed in Scheme 3. The plates resulting from the self-orientation of nanoparticles can easily generate curvature and develop into a marigold-like structure (Scheme 3b and c). The curvature of the plate is further accelerated by the hydrothermal conditions in the methanol-mediated reaction and results in the formation of CdIn2S4 nanotubes (Scheme 3a). There may be orientation of the nanoparticles in the form of a triangular shape, followed by self-organization to give a pyramid under microwave irradiation (Scheme 3d). The marigold flowers and nanopyramids of CdIn2S4 synthesized by the microwave method achieved high degradation rates of 97.31% and 93.01% for the degradation of MB (10 ppm), respectively, which gave almost 30% enhancement compared to CdS under direct sunlight for 150 min. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was due to the good crystallinity of these materials.371 Scheme 3  Schematic representation of the formation of CdIn2S4 with different morphologies.

ZnIn2S4 submicrospheres were composed of a large quantity of nearly monodisperse spheres with an average diameter of about 0.6 μm, and the surface of the spheres had numerous fibrous or flake-like particles. They showed enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity in the MB degradation due to their high specific surface area of 270.1 m2 g−1.28Chen et al.384 synthesized marigold-like ZnIn2S4 microspheres using ZnCl2, InCl3 and TAA as reactants in aqueous solution (14 ml) by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method (Explorer 48, CEM Co. Ltd., USA) with a temperature range from 80 to 195 °C and in situ magnetic stirring under a maximal microwave power of 200 W for 10 min. The microwave-assisted reaction time is much shorter than the normal hydrothermal method whereas better crystallinity is obtained in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal samples. The TEM image in Fig. 17(a) shows an individual microsphere with a zigzag circular shape. There are some floccules between the nanosheets, which may be due to the short reaction time and faults in the crystal. The SEM image of the as-synthesized ZnIn2S4 in Fig. 17(b) shows that the sample is composed of a large quantity of microspheres with an average diameter of about 2 μm and has a unique marigold-like spherical superstructure which is made up of numerous nanosheets. It is similar to the ZnIn2S4 sample prepared by hydrothermal method,382 whereas the interspace in the microwave-assisted hydrothermal samples between nanosheets is narrower and shorter than that of the normal hydrothermal samples. The reason may be the high heating efficiency of the microwave.384 The degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) by the as-prepared ZnIn2S4 under the visible light irradiation (300 W tungsten–halogen lamp with cutoff filters (420–800 nm)) for 4 h was investigated. The ZnIn2S4 sample synthesized at 195 °C exhibits the best photocatalytic activity for MO degradation, as shown in Fig. 18, which may be due to its large specific surface area.384 In addition, the photocatalytic activities of all the samples prepared by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method were better than those prepared by a normal hydrothermal method.384 Fig. 17  (a) TEM and SEM pictures of microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesized ZnIn2S4.

(Reproduced with permission from ref. 384). 3.7 AgIn5S8There are many methods reported for the preparation of AgIn5S8 (Eg = 1.70–2.57 eV),385,386 such as the pulsed laser deposition approach,387 single crystal thermal evaporation,388 solution growth techniques389 and chemical bath deposition methods.390 Li et al.385 synthesized AgIn5S8 powder by a microwave hydrothermal method using Ag2SO4 (0.1 mmol), InCl3·4H2O (0.5 mmol) and TAA as starting reagents in aqueous solution (15 ml). The microwave hydrothermal synthesis was performed in a microwave reaction system (Explorer 48, CEM Co.) at different temperatures (80, 120, 160, and 200 °C) for 10 min under magnetic stirring. The photocatalytic activity of the AgIn5S8 nanoparticles was investigated through the degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation using a 500 W tungsten–halogen lamp (420–800 nm). The sample prepared at 120 °C displayed the best photocatalytic activity with a degradation rate of 89.4% at 4 h.4 Composites4.1 ZnO–ZnSeZnSe is a candidate for producing type II heterostructures based on ZnO because its band gap (2.67 eV) is narrower than that of ZnO and its CB and VB are aligned in a staggered manner relative to those of ZnO,391,392 which facilitates the charge separation of an electron–hole pair before recombination.Lee et al.393 reported the synthesis of porous ZnO–ZnSe nanocomposites for visible light photocatalysis. In their work, porous ZnO nanostructures were firstly synthesized by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal reaction at 120 °C for 2 h in a microwave reactor (Discover SP, CEM Corporation) then converted into porous ZnO–ZnSe nanocomposites by a microwave-assisted dissolution–recrystallization process using an aqueous solution (50 ml) containing selenium ions at 160 °C for 2 min. ZnO powders (Fig. 19(a)) are mainly composed of spherical architectures and the surfaces of ZnO are porous and seem to be composed of nanoparticles. Some structures contain a large pore on the surface. The ZnO–ZnSe exhibits a hierarchical structure, as shown in Fig. 19(b). Nanoparticles are attached to the porous surfaces. The size of the ZnO–ZnSe structure is similar to that of the ZnO structure. The photodecomposition of Orange-II (4-(2-hydroxy-1-naphthylazo) benzenesulfonic acid, 5 × 10−5 M) under the irradiation of an Hg lamp without or with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 400 nm or λ ≥ 495 nm) was used to study the photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized porous ZnO and ZnO–ZnSe structures. The porous ZnO–ZnSe nanocomposites exhibited much higher activities than the porous ZnO nanostructures. Fig. 19  SEM images of the (a) ZnO and (b) ZnO–ZnSe powders.

Wu et al.399 prepared multi-walled CNTs coated with face-centered cubic ZnS nanospheres with a uniform and small diameter to form ZnS–CNTs heterostructures under microwave irradiation in a microwave refluxing system (NN-S570MFS, Sanle, China) at 280 W for 15 min. Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.2744 g) and TAA (0.0614 g) were used as the zinc and sulfur sources, respectively, and water (50 ml) as the solvent. The SEM and TEM images (Fig. 20) show that the surfaces of the CNTs are randomly decorated with ZnS nanoparticles. The probable formation mechanism of ZnS–CNT heterostructures was proposed as follows:399 the positive Zn2+ ions are adsorbed effectively onto the surface of the acid-treated CNTs via electrostatic attraction,400 which allows the heterogeneous nucleation of Zn2+ with S2− released quickly and uniformly from TAA at the elevated temperature due to the microwave irradiation. Then ZnS nuclei formed on the shell of the CNTs grow to form ZnS nanoparticles. The ZnS–CNT heterostructures showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward the photodegradation of MO (20 mg l−1) under UV irradiation (250 W high pressure Hg lamp) for 3 h. The reason should be that the introduction of CNTs reduced the charge recombination and401 and increased the surface area-to-volume ratio, allowing for greater photon absorption on the photocatalyst surface.18 Fig. 20  (a) SEM and (b) TEM images of the ZnS–CNTs heterostructures.

The same group402 introduced Cd into the ZnS matrix to form ZnxCd1−xS–MWCNT heterostructures by a microwave-assisted route using Zn(CH3COO)2 (0.1372 g), Cd(NO3)2 (0.1928 g), and TAA (0.0566 g) as the reactants and water as the solvent (50 ml). The microwave-assisted reaction was carried out in a microwave refluxing system (NN-S570MFS, Sanle, China) at 365 W for 5 min. Similar to the ZnS–CNTs,399 the CNTs were decorated with ZnxCd1−xS nanoparticles, which revealed heterostructures with ZnxCd1−xS nanoparticles along the CNTs outer surfaces. The ZnxCd1−xS–CNTs with different Zn concentrations showed different photocatalytic activities towards the photodegradation of fuchsine acid (10 mg l−1) under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 400 nm) and the Zn0.2Cd0.8S–CNTs possessed the best photocatalytic activity with a degradation rate of about 96%.4.2.2 ZnSe–CNTs. Wu et al.403 prepared the multi-walled CNTs coated with face-center cubic uniform and small diameter ZnSe nanoparticles to form ZnSe–CNT heterostructures under microwave irradiation in a microwave refluxing system (NN-S570MFS, Sanle, China) at 440 W for 15 min. The CNTs were found to be decorated with uniform ZnSe nanoparticles along the CNTs outer surfaces. It was demonstrated that the heterostructures could degrade fuchsine acid (10−4 M) under UV light irradiation (30 W) for 50 min with a higher photocatalytic activity than the ZnSe nanoparticles. This was because the surface functionalized CNTs avoided the formation of nanoparticle aggregates, improving the distribution and reducing the average size of the nanoparticles, which could improve the photocatalytic activity.4034.2.3 ZnO–TiO2–CNTs. Compared with single photocatalysts (ZnO or TiO2), these hybrid materials can provide a superior photocatalytic performance owing to the extension of the light absorption range and the effective charge injection from ZnO to TiO2.404–406 The incorporation of CNTs into a ZnO–TiO2 composite to form a ternary hybrid material can further enhance the photocatalytic performance because of the stepwise structure of the band-edge levels constructed in the ZnO–TiO2–CNTs composite, as shown in Scheme 4. According to the data reported on the CB and VB of ZnO (−4.05 and −7.25 eV),349,407 TiO2 (−4.2 and −7.4 eV),408,409 and the work function of CNTs (−4.5 eV),410,411 the energy levels of the three materials follow the order: ZnO > TiO2 > CNTs. Such energy levels are beneficial for photo-induced electrons to transfer from the ZnO CB via the TiO2 CB to the CNTs, which can efficiently separate the photo-induced electrons and hinder the charge recombination in electron-transfer processes, thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Scheme 4  Schematic diagram of the energy levels of ZnO, TiO2 and CNTs. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 412). Pan et al.412 synthesized ZnO–TiO2–CNTs composites using a microwave-assisted reaction of ZnSO4 in a P25 TiO2 and CNT suspension (20 ml) using a microwave synthesis system (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) at 150 °C under a power of 150 W for 10 min. The system was equipped with in situ magnetic stirring. Fig. 21(a)–(d) show SEM images of CNTs, ZnO, ZnO–TiO2, and ZnO–TiO2–CNT composites. From Fig. 21(a) and (b) it can clearly be seen that the CNTs are entangled with each other and show a network-like structure, while ZnO displays a sheet nanostructure. When TiO2 nanoparticles are incorporated into the composite, as illustrated in Fig. 21(c), they are dispersed around the ZnO sheets in ZnO–TiO2 composites. Compared to ZnO–TiO2, CNTs act as wires connecting different ZnO sheets and TiO2 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 21(d), which can serve as fast electronic conducting channels and is beneficial to photocatalytic performance.413 The HRTEM images in Fig. 21(e) and (f) reveal that ZnO and TiO2 crystallites are attached onto the surface of the CNTs. The photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples were evaluated through the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) (10 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (500 W high pressure Hg lamp with the main wave crest at 365 nm). The results showed that the addition of CNTs could enhance the photocatalytic performance of the ZnO–TiO2 composites. The ZnO–TiO2–CNTs composites achieved a maximum reduction rate of 90% under UV light irradiation for 4 h, which is much higher than those for the pure ZnO (58%) and the ZnO–TiO2 composite (69%). The improvement was ascribed to the increased light absorption and the reduction of electron–hole pair recombination upon the introduction of CNTs.412 Fig. 21  SEM images of (a) CNTs, (b) ZnO nanosheets, (c) ZnO–TiO2 composite, and (d) ZnO–TiO2–CNT composite; (e) low-magnification and (f) high-magnification HRTEM images of ZnO–TiO2–CNTs.

However, in most of the reported methods, hazardous reducing agents, high temperature or long processing times are required. Therefore, producing RGO on a large scale using facile and practical reducing methods is still a challenge. Microwaves can heat the reactants to a high temperature in a short time and have been successfully applied in the reduction of GO to synthesize RGO without any toxic chemicals within a short reaction time (several minutes) and at relatively low temperature (150–300 °C).424–426Fig. 22 and 23 show the AFM, TEM and SEM images of RGO obtained by microwave-assisted methods. The RGO consists of a few carbon layers and the corrugated and transparent sheets resemble crumpled silk veil waves. The RGO layers interact with each other to form an open pore system to enhance the specific surface ratio. The C/O ratio of RGO (∼9.12) obtained from energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is close to the value for RGO obtained by conventional hydrazine reduction (∼10).418 This result, together with the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman analysis, confirm that the exfoliation and deoxygenation of GO can be realized during this facile and pollution-free process.426 Fig. 22  AFM image of RGO in the tapping mode: topography images and height profiles are obtained from the positions indicated by the different lines. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 426).  Fig. 23  (a) SEM and (b) HRTEM images of RGO. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 426). Similar to CNTs, RGO can also act as an excellent electron-acceptor/transport material407,427,428 and attempts to combine semiconductor photocatalysts and RGO have been reported in efforts to obtain hybrid materials with superior performances.329,407,427,429–433 In the meantime, attachment of such semiconductor particles onto RGO can also prevent the restacking and agglomeration of the RGO sheets during the reduction process due to van der Waals interactions between them. Due to the lower energy level of the work function of RGO than the CB of most photocatalysts, the stepwise structure of the energy levels constructed in the RGO–photocatalyst composites can facilitate electron transfer and separation, which enhances the photocatalytic performance of the photocatalyst.54,56,407,427,434–445 In addition, the introduction of RGO can enhance the light absorption intensity and range55,427,446–449 as well as increase the adsorption of pollutants.429,448,450 However, it should be noted that excessive RGO can act as a kind of recombination center instead of providing an electron pathway411,451 and light filter to decrease the number of charge carriers in the composite to be photogenerated,427,452 which will decrease the photocatalytic performance. As a result, the incorporation of a suitable amount of RGO is necessary for achieving the optimum performance of the composite.Compared with other synthesis methods such as the UV-assisted photocatalytic reduction of GO in photocatalyst suspensions,420,421,428,453 solvothermal or hydrothermal methods in GO and photocatalyst precursors,55,329,448,454 sol–gel methods,455 or sonochemical methods,456 the microwave-assisted method can fulfill in situ formation of semiconductor photocatalysts on GO nanosheets and the simultaneous reduction of GO to RGO without any toxic chemicals.349,409,457–460 Furthermore, it can facilitate mass production in a short time with low energy costs425 and form an intimate contact between the photocatalysts and RGO,461,462 which is crucial for the formation of electronic interactions and interelectron transfer at the interface.4274.3.1 ZnO–RGO. Pan et al.349 reported a one-step synthesis of a ZnO–RGO composite through the microwave-assisted reaction of ZnSO4 in aqueous solution (20 ml) with a GO dispersion using a microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) at 150 °C for 10 min with magnetic stirring. Fig. 24(a) displays the SEM image of ZnO sheets–RGO composite. The RGO nanosheets are curled and are decorated densely by ZnO sheets, which displays a good combination between them. The thickness of ZnO in the ZnO–RGO composite is about 20–30 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 24(a). The detailed formation mechanism is as follows: under acidic conditions of pH < 6.0, the Zn element exists as Zn2+ and ZnOH+ soluble ions in the aqueous solution.447,462 Zn2+ and ZnOH+ ions could be tightly adsorbed onto both sides of GO due to the functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy groups on the surfaces of GO. With increasing pH (∼9), a conversion from Zn2+ and ZnOH+ ions to Zn(OH)2 precipitate happens and finally GO is reduced to RGO and the Zn(OH)2 is transformed to ZnO sheets on both sides of the RGO under microwave heating. The photocatalytic performances of the as-synthesized ZnO–RGO samples with different RGO contents were evaluated by the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) (10 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation (500 W high pressure Hg lamp with the main wave crest at 365 nm). The ZnO–RGO composite (1.0 wt% RGO) exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic performance with a maximum reduction rate of 98% under UV light irradiation for 4 h as compared to pure ZnO (58%) and P25 (70%). Fig. 24  SEM images of (a) ZnO sheets–RGO349 and (b) ZnO particles–RGO composites. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 458). The same group458 changed the precursor and applied the microwave conditions to a GO dispersion with Zn(NO3)2 (20 ml) at 100 °C for 30 min with magnetic stirring to synthesize ZnO particles–RGO hybrid composites. As shown in Fig. 24(b), the ZnO displays a hexagonal nanorod structure and the RGO sheets are decorated densely by the ZnO nanorods. The photocatalytic performance of the composite in the degradation of MB (5 mg l−1) was investigated under UV light irradiation (500 W high pressure Hg lamp with the main wave crest at 365 nm) for 260 min. It was found that the incorporation of RGO could enhance the photocatalytic performance and photo-stability of ZnO, and the ZnO–RGO composite with 1.1 wt% RGO achieved a maximum degradation rate of 88% at pH 7 and 91.7% at pH 9 as compared to pure ZnO (68%).4.3.2 TiO2–RGO. Yu et al.433 prepared a TiO2–RGO composite by the microwave hydrothermal treatment of GO and hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanosheets in an ethanol–water solvent (∼32 ml) using a microwave synthesis system (MDS-6, Sineo, China) at 180 °C for 1 h. These composite samples showed high photocatalytic H2 production activity using a 350 W Xe arc lamp as the UV light source in aqueous solutions containing methanol, as sacrificial reagent, even without the Pt co-catalyst. The optimal RGO content was found to be 1.0 wt%, giving a H2 production rate of 736 mmol h−1 g−1 with a quantum efficiency of 3.1%, which exceeded the rate observed on pure TiO2 nanosheets more than 41 times.Pan et al.409 synthesized TiO2–RGO composites via microwave-assisted reduction of GO in a TiO2 suspension (20 ml) using a microwave synthesis system (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) at 150 °C with a power of 150 W for 10 min with magnetic stirring. It is found that TiO2 forms uniform spherical particles in Fig. 25(a) and they are densely attached onto the surface of the curled RGO nanosheets in Fig. 25(b). The TiO2–RGO composite with 0.8 wt% RGO exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic performance for the reduction of Cr(VI) (10 mg l−1) with a maximum removal rate of 91% under UV light irradiation (500 W high pressure Hg lamp with the main wave crest at 365 nm) for 4 h, compared with pure TiO2 (83%) and commercial TiO2 P25 (70%). Fig. 25  Surface morphologies of (a) TiO2 nanoparticles and (b) TiO2–RGO by SEM measurement. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 409). 4.3.3 CdS–RGO. Pan et al.457 synthesized CdS–RGO composites via the microwave-assisted reduction of GO in a Cd(NO3)2 and CH4N2S solution (20 ml) using a microwave system (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) with a power of 150 W at 150 °C for 10 min with magnetic stirring. Fig. 26(a) and (b) show the SEM images of CdS and CdS–RGO. CdS is formed of spherical particles and the surface of the curled RGO nanosheets is packed densely with CdS nanoparticles. The RGO sheets decrease the agglomeration of CdS nanoparticles and act as bridges for the connection between different CdS nanoparticles, which is beneficial to the separation of photo-generated carriers. The photocatalytic performance of the as-prepared samples was evaluated by photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) (10 mg l−1) under visible light irradiation (400 W metal halogen lamp with cut off filter (λ > 400 nm)) for 4 h. The CdS–RGO composite (1.5 wt% RGO) exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic performance for the reduction of Cr(VI) with a maximum removal rate of 92% compared with pure CdS (79%). In their work, CdS–RGO composites with 1.5 wt% RGO were also prepared using a conventional solvothermal method. A higher photocatalytic performance of the sample prepared via the microwave-assisted method was achieved compared with the sample prepared using the conventional solvothermal method, as shown in Fig. 27. The enhanced performance could be ascribed to the following reasons:457 (i) good contact between CdS and RGO is formed, which can inhibit the interfacial recombination of the injected electrons from CdS to RGO;457,463,464 (ii) microwave irradiation can heat up the aqueous solution homogeneously and quickly.465,466 Therefore, the nucleation and growth of CdS can be complete in an extremely short period of time, which is extraordinarily beneficial for reducing the concentration of surface defects in CdS. The carrier recombination at surface defects of CdS is correspondingly suppressed.467,468 Fig. 26  Surface morphologies of (a) CdS nanoparticles and (b) CdS–RGO samples by SEM measurement. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 457).  Fig. 27  Photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by CdS–RGO synthesized via a conventional solvothermal method and a microwave-assisted method. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 457). 4.3.4 ZnS–RGO. Wang et al.460 reported a facile and efficient strategy for preparing RGO nanosheets–ZnS composites assisted by microwave irradiation (400 W) using a MAS-I microwave oven (Sineo, China) at 85 °C for 20 min. The process involved the reaction of GO nanosheets (300 mg) as the dispersant and 2D growth template for ZnS nanoballs, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.04 mol) as the zinc source, and TAA (0.06 mol) as a sulfide source as well as the reducing agent in aqueous solution (100 ml). ZnS nanoballs composed of many small self-assembled ZnS nanocrystals were formed in situ on GO and GO was simultaneously reduced to RGO nanosheets. By comparing the TEM images of the ZnS and ZnS–RGO composites in Fig. 28(a) and (b), when adding RGO, the agglomeration of ZnS can be effectively avoided and the ZnS nanoballs disperse well in the RGO matrix. A possible mechanism was proposed as follows:460 the positive Zn2+ ions were easily anchored onto the surface of GO. With TAA added to the mixture, the Zn2+ ions reacted in situ with the S2− uniformly released from TAA under microwave heating to form the initial ZnS nuclei. Afterwards, the ZnS nuclei grew to form ZnS nanoparticles which were then self-assembled into nanoballs induced by continuous microwave radiation, while GO was reduced to RGO to form the ZnS–RGO composite. The as-prepared ZnS–RGO composites showed an excellent photocatalytic activity with a degradation rate of ∼99% toward the photodegradation of MB (15 mg l−1) under UV light irradiation using a high-pressure Hg lamp (500 W) for 30 min, compared with pure ZnS (∼59%) after 150 min irradiation. Fig. 28  TEM images of (a) ZnS nanoballs and (b) ZnS–RGO composites. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 460). 4.3.5 CdS–TiO2–RGO. As an alternative to the doping of TiO2 by non-metals or noble metals, the coupling of TiO2 with a narrow band gap semiconductor material, typically CdS, is also an effective way to extend the absorption to the visible light range.469–472 In the meantime, the photoexcited electrons in CdS can be efficiently injected into TiO2 because the CB position of CdS is higher than that of TiO2.473,474Pan et al.459 reported a rapid synthesis of a CdS–TiO2–RGO composite using microwave-assisted reduction of GO in a CdS precursor (CdCl2 and Na2S) solution with a TiO2 suspension (20 ml). The synthesis was performed in a microwave synthesis system (Explorer-48, CEM, USA) at 150 °C under a power of 100 W for 10 min. The system was equipped with in situ magnetic stirring. Fig. 29(a) and (b) show the SEM images of CdS–TiO2 and CdS–TiO2–RGO. Compared with CdS–TiO2, it is observed that the RGO sheets are decorated densely by CdS–TiO2, which displays a good combination between them. In the composites, CdS extends the absorption of TiO2 from the UV region to the visible light range, while RGO increases the specific surface areas of the composites and facilitates the charge transportation and separation. Microwave-assisted synthesis of the CdS–TiO2–RGO composite is a one-step process. Due to the distribution of carboxylic acid groups on GO, TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed on the carbon support easily accumulated along the wrinkles and edges of RGO.448 Meanwhile, positively charged Cd2+ ions form complexes with TiO2 nanoparticles and S2− from Na2S quickly reacted with Cd2+ producing uniform CdS nuclei under microwave irradiation. The CdS nuclei grew, crystallized, and stabilized on TiO2 under microwave irradiation, leading to good contact between CdS and TiO2.464,475 The photocatalytic experiments of the CdS–TiO2–RGO composite for the degradation of MO (10 mg l−1) showed that the addition of RGO could enhance the photocatalytic performance of the CdS–TiO2 composites with a maximum degradation rate of 99.5% under visible light irradiation (400 W metal halogen lamp with cut off filter, λ > 400 nm) for 5 h as compared with the pure TiO2 (43%) and the CdS–TiO2 (79.9%).

In summary, we have introduced various semiconductor photocatalysts synthesized via microwave-assisted methoda. Besides the most common photocatalysts, other compounds, such as SrTiO3,476,477 CeVO4,478 PrVO4,478 NdVO4,478 ReFeO3 (Re: La, Sm, Eu, Gd),479 K4Nb6O17,480 GaOOH,481 AgVO3,482 AgInS2,11 Ag2CrO4,483 SrWO4:Ln3+ (Eu3+, Tb3+, Sm3+ and Dy3+),484 CaSb2O5(OH)2,485 Cd(OH)2,486 SnNb2O6,487 YVO4,488,489 Y4Al2O9,490 ZnFe2O4,491 Bi2Fe4O9,492 Bi2GeO5,493 ZnGa2O4,494 ZnGaNO,495 In(WO4)2,496 AgCl–Ag,497 Ag2S–Ag,498 Fe3O4–ZnCr,499 CeO2–TiO2,500 NaTaO3,501,502 and BiOBr,503,504 have also been synthesized using microwave-assisted hydrothermal or solvothermal methods. Some of them exhibited superior photocatalytic activities and stabilities compared to commercial TiO2 (P25, Degussa Co.) or the samples synthesized by conventional methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal or solid-state reactions.478,481,482,485,4875 ProspectsMicrowave-assisted solution-phase synthesis has shown great potential in the preparation of photocatalysts compared with other traditional technologies. The use of microwave heating for the preparation of nanomaterials a rapidly growing research area.48,505 Microwave synthesis offers several advantages over conventional routes. The most important are the improvement of reaction yields, the increase in reaction rates and the reduction of reaction times. In addition, microwaves allow energy to be saved506 and appear today as a new technology for the development of the green chemistry, with synthesis methods involving toxic-solvent-free processes or reduced reactant amounts. Another advantage of the microwave process is the rapid switch on and off, and their quite easy adaptation to the conventional heating processes used in industry.Currently several other approaches to apply microwaves in the synthesis of photocatalysts have also attracted much interest. For example, novel microwave-induced solution combustion techniques have been studied to prepare TiO2–SiO2, TiO2–Al2O3, and TiO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides for photocatalysis;507 microwave calcination is used to produce highly crystalline samples but it avoids a great increase of the particle size and the corresponding decrease of specific surface area which occurs during conventional heating in a muffle furnace;508–511 microwave solid state reactions are employed to avoid the requirement of high temperatures, long duration calcination and overcomes the problems of uncontrollably large grain growth, localized segregation of one or more components, and possible loss of stoichiometry in conventional solid state reactions.502,512Compared with other technologies, microwave-assisted synthesis is a relatively new technology. However, there are several challenges that should be further clarified, otherwise, it will limit the application of microwaves in the synthesis of photocatalysts. One of the most important issues is related to the microwave equipment. Many studies employed simple domestic microwave ovens which makes it difficult to control the temperature and pressure of the synthesis system. As a result, this could not guarantee uniform reaction conditions and is not stable and efficient. Moreover, it is worth to mention that the samples obtained via microwave irradiation in a domestic microwave oven may be not composed of pure phases.513 In order to solve the problem, modern commercially available dedicated microwave reactors should be used for chemical syntheses. Commercial microwave systems can accurately control the temperature, time and power during microwave reactions but most of them are expensive. As with any new technology, the current price range of commercially available dedicated microwave reactors is bound to change over the next several years, and less expensive equipment should become available.36 Another crucial challenge is to manipulate the shape and size of the as-synthesized nanomaterials. Attempts such as adding catalysts, using small molecules as surfactants, changing reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, etc. can be adapted in microwave systems.514 Furthermore, in future research, microwave-assisted methods will be expected to synthesise core–shell particles, thin films on substrates, ceramic and polymeric composites. Microwave-assisted methods have a bright future and may open up new possibilities for the simple, rapid and effective mass production of photocatalysts owing to the increased deviations from equilibrium in conventional hydrothermal or solvothermal processes.AcknowledgementsFinancial support from the Scholarship Award for Excellent Doctoral Student granted by the Ministry of Education (no.
