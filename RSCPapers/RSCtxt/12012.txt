    , Accepted 1st August 2019First published on 1st August 2019AbstractThe synthesis, characterisation and application as electron-acceptors in organic photovoltaic cells of new [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline-based small molecules with oligo(ethylene oxide) solubilising groups and tunable optical bandgaps are reported. A new p-type polymer consisting of a polythiophene derivative substituted with analogous solubilising groups was also synthesised to perform as a donor, in combination with the small molecules, for bulk-heterojunction solar cells using ethanol/anisole mixtures as low toxic solvents to process the active blends. Comparison of the structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties of the small molecules elucidated on the structural dependence of their optical bandgaps, ranging from 1.31 to 2.25 eV. The active layers composed of the polythiophene donor and the small molecules showed well-intermixed morphologies, and the best performing blends showed a fibrillar-type morphology, indicative of more ordered molecular packings. Blends processed from the 50:50 (v/v) mixture of ethanol and a low toxic solvent, anisole, yielded low power conversion efficiencies of 0.39% in non-optimized organic solar cells. Although the efficiencies are low, these are the first reported results of OSCs with active layers composed of non-fullerene acceptors processed from ethanol-based solvent formulations. This study provides guidelines for the design of non-fullerene acceptors for the fabrication of OSCs processed from environmentally friendly solvents.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) integrating solution-processed active layers represent a promising solar energy technology because they enable large-area solution deposition methods in their fabrication (e.g. ink-jet printing, roll-to-roll) and produce low-cost, lightweight, and mechanically flexible devices.1–3 Recently, BHJ-OSCs demonstrating efficiencies over 15% were reported for single junctions formed by the polymer donor PBDB-T-2F and a non-fullerene acceptor based on a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-core-based fused-unit dithienothiophen[3,2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole, Y6.4 In fact, the several intrinsic restrictions of fullerenes as electron-acceptors in OSCs, such as limited absorption in the visible region, structural instability enabling aggregate formation under photon-irradiation and restricted tunability of electronic properties by adjusting the molecular design,5,6 have led to increased interest in seeking non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).7 Nevertheless, the high toxicity of the solvents currently used to process the active layers of very efficient OSCs, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, which are typically harmful halogenated solvents, leads to critical issues for transferring lab-scale OSCs for large-scale and mass production, since such solvents are outlawed in the semiconductor industry.8 In face of the present urgency to maximise the use of emerging renewable energy technologies, such as OSCs, the awareness of the importance of using “green” solvents to process the active layers, has grown and increasing efforts have been endeavoured either to synthesise materials with solubility in “eco-friendly” solvents9 or to develop solvent formulations of lower toxicity (e.g. based on halogen-free solvents)10 to replace halogenated solvents in the cell fabrication process. However, to date, only a few studies have shown OSCs processed from non-toxic or very low toxic solvents, such as water or water/ethanol mixtures, and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) reported was 1.4% for OSCs with active layers processed from ethanol/water mixtures and composed of a p-type polymer anchoring branched oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side groups poly(2,5-bis(1,3-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)propan-2-yloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (PPDT2FBT-A), with derivatives of PC61BM substituted by linear OEG-type groups.11 Such studies also showed that the engineering of side chains, such as the chain length and branched vs. linear chains, can determine relevant material properties for device operation (e.g. crystallinity and charge mobility). In a previous study, we also showed that the simple replacement of n-hexyl chains with OEG-based chains as side groups in perylenediimide (PDI) dimers resulted in improved PCE in BHJ-OSCs.12 The obtained enhancements were attributed to closer intermolecular π–π stacking promoted by the higher flexibility of OEG chains in comparison with n-alkyl groups. Other authors13 also demonstrated the beneficial role of the OEG side groups in polymer donors in OSCs compared with alkyl chains and related improvements in hole mobility and redshifted absorption caused by the more densely packed assembly of the polymer phase. Noteworthily, Torabi et al.14 determined higher relative dielectric constants for polymers and fullerene derivatives functionalised with OEG chains, which is beneficial to the dissociation of hole–electron pairs. In addition to such positive effects on cell performance, OEG-type groups are also preferential as polar and hydrophilic solubilising groups owing to being non-ionic, i.e., they do not act as traps for charges that can degrade the cell electric performance.
In this study, a series of conjugated small molecules with a [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) central unit substituted with phenyl rings anchoring OEG-type side groups was investigated as the acceptor in BHJ-OSCs processed from anisole and anisole/ethanol mixtures. In addition, a new p-type polymer similarly substituted with OEG side groups (POEGT) was synthesised to perform as a donor in the fabricated OSCs. Anisole is a recommended solvent, according to a reported survey of over fifty solvents, owing to its low toxicity, which is well-comparable to those of ethanol, n-butanol and ethyl acetate.15 In spite of being aromatic, such as toluene and xylenes, health hazard parameters for anisole are lower,16 thus enabling its use in fragrances. Fig. 1 and Scheme 1 show the chemical structures of the studied small molecules and the donor polymer, POEGT, respectively. This was designed as a polythiophene derivative, since this class remains very interesting for applications in devices owing to their easy synthesis, good compatibility with a variety of acceptors, and low-cost, which reflects on the device production cost.17 In this study, we designed a three-step synthetic approach to obtain an alternating copolymer consisting of 50% OEG-substituted thiophene units. The synthesis and characterisation of TQT1 and TQT2 were previously reported by us.18 The molecular designs of TQT1 and TQT2 correspond to a “donor–acceptor–donor” (D–A–D) structure, in which the electron rich (donor) ends are thienyl units and the electron-poor (acceptor) units are thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline units (TQ). In our previous publication, we showed that both TQT1 and TQT2 exhibited narrow optical band gaps and low LUMO energies, which allowed us to use TQT1 as an acceptor in OSCs. In fact, TQT1 showed ambipolar behaviour; it performed as a donor with PCBM and as an acceptor with the polymer donor PTB7 in BHJ-OSCs with blends processed from chlorobenzene.19 However, the high HOMO energy of TQT2 precluded us from exploring it as an acceptor as no suitable donors could be found. In both compounds, TQT1 and TQT2, the HOMO extends over the entire A–D–A system,18 while the LUMO is located mainly at the central TQ unit. As a result, we predicted that the HOMO energy could be tuned by the modification of the units coupled to the TQ central unit. The molecular design of the new small molecules, TQBT and TQFP, comprising aromatic rings substituted with electron withdrawing groups (thiadiazole moieties and fluorine atoms) instead of thienyl units, aims to down-shift the HOMOs of the small molecules while not significantly affecting their LUMOs and exploiting their potential as acceptors for applications in green-processed OSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterisation
The synthesis and characterisation of TQT1 and TQT2 were previously reported by us.18 The new small molecules TQBT and TQFP were prepared in good yields via Suzuki (TQBT) and Stille (TQFP) coupling reactions using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst, starting from 4,9-dibromo-6,7-bis(4-(2-(2-ethoxylethoxy)ethoxy)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline synthesised as reported in our previous study18 and an excess of the commercially available appropriate end units, benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5-yl-boronic acid pinacol ester (for TQBT) or 2,3-difluor-4-(tributylstannyl)pyridine (for TQFP). Detailed procedures are described in the experimental section. Both compounds exhibit high solubility in common organic solvents (e.g. dichloromethane, toluene, and tetrahydrofuran) and moderate solubility (ca. 5–10 mg mL−1) in polar solvents. However, solubility in water is negligible for all the compounds. TQBT melts at a considerably high temperature (Tm = 157.5 °C), and TQFP did not melt in the temperature range of 0–200 °C, according to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements shown in Fig. S12 of ESI.†POEGT was prepared through a Stille coupling polymerisation reaction in moderate yield (55%) from the newly synthesised dibrominated thienyl monomer substituted with one OEG group (Scheme 1) and the distannylated thiophene comonomer. An excess of thienyl-based mono-capping units was subsequently added to the reaction medium after the polymer was formed to minimise chain end defects associated with bromide and tin species that could cause device performance deterioration.20 The polymerisation reaction was quenched by precipitating the polymer in n-hexane. Further purification included extractions with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate solution to remove possible palladium residue. The monomer 3 and POEGT were fully characterised by elemental analysis, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (see Experimental section and ESI†). The average number-molecular weight (Mn) of POEGT, determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is 11.3 kDa (Mn) with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.98. Despite not being fully functionalised with OEG solubilising groups, POEGT is soluble in common organic solvents, including toluene, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran, although its solubility in hydrophilic solvents, such as ethanol, is only moderate. The thermal analysis of POEGT through DSC (Fig. S13 in ESI†) showed no transitions in the 20–300 °C temperature range, thus indicating the polymer's good thermal stability.
2.2. DFT studies
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the effects of the structural modifications of the new compounds, i.e., the role of the terminal units difluoropyridine and benzothiadiazole on the molecular conformations and frontier molecular orbitals of the small molecules. TDDFT calculations, with similar functionals, were used to compute the excitations from the ground state wave function (see Experimental section for details). Analogous calculations were performed for TQT1 and TQT2 in our previous study18 and are shown here for comparison purposes. The molecules were modelled with methoxy groups as solubilising chains to simplify the calculations. Fig. 2 shows the obtained optimised molecular structures and HOMO and LUMO distributions. The values for the maximum transitions are shown in Table 1. From the optimised structures, we observe that the molecular structures of both TQFP and TQBT are more twisted than those of TQT1 and TQT2. As seen, both TQT1 and TQT2 show coplanarisation between the TQ unit and the capping five-member thienyl rings, while the torsion between the TQ core and the six-member rings of difluoropyridine and benzothiadiazole units is large, with the dihedral angles of 55° and 48° in TQFP and TQBT, respectively. As a result, in TQFP and TQBT, the electronic delocalisation is mostly restricted to the TQ core, with little contribution from the end-capping units, and the HOMO energies are lower than those found for TQT1 and TQT2. This effect is consistent with the experimental estimates of the HOMO energies, determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 3 and Table 1). In addition, the lack of delocalisation to the end-capping units in TQFP signifies that the HOMO is nearly degenerate with lower-energy occupied states (HOMO−1). As for the LUMO, it is mainly localised in the TQ unit in both TQFP and TQBT, similar to TQT1 and TQT2, probably owing to the strong electrophilic nature of the thiadiazole-quinoxaline unit. Hence, the LUMO energy is less affected by the modification of the end capping units, although it decreases by a few tenths of an eV from TQT1 and TQT2 to TQFP and TQBT, which accounts for the small differences in the contribution of the end-capping units. The observed confinement of both HOMO and LUMO mostly to the central TQ unit in TQFP and TQBT contrasts with the internal charge transfer (ICT) HOMO–LUMO excitation from the end-capping units to the thiadiazolo-quinoxaline block determined for TQT1 and TQT2.18 However, in the case of TQFP, due to the nearly degenerate HOMOs, the HOMO–LUMO excitation is from both the benzene ring in the TQ unit and the peripheral phenoxy rings to the benzothiadiazole-quinoxaline core and therefore has some ICT character. This is in agreement with the solvatochromic studies for TQFP, as discussed in Section 2.4. The increased HOMO–LUMO bandgap predicted for TQFP and TQBT in comparison with those for TQT1 and TQT2 is also consistent with the absorption spectra for the small molecules presented in Section 2.4. The S1 state is predicted at 443 and 494 nm for TQFP and TQBT (Table 1), respectively.

2.3. Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to assess the electrochemical properties of the new materials POEGT, TQBT and TQFP (Fig. 3). For comparison, the voltammograms obtained for TQT1 and TQT2 are also shown.18 As observed, both TQBT and TQFP oxidise at higher potentials than TQT1 and TQT2. Thus, their HOMO energies (determined from the onset potential for the anodic processes, as explained in the Experimental section), estimated as −5.68 eV and −5.85 eV for TQBT and TQFP, respectively, are both lower than those found for TQT1 (−5.24 eV) and TQT2 (−4.81 eV) (Table 1). Regarding the cathodic processes, the onsets of reduction for TQBT and TQFP occur at potentials only a little lower than those for the thienyl-capped analogues and, consequently, their estimated LUMO energies, being −3.77 eV and −3.89 eV for TQBT and TQFP, respectively, differ little from those of TQT1 (−3.87 eV) and TQT2 (−3.72 eV). These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions establishing that the LUMOs of the small molecules have small contributions from the end-capping units. From these results, it can be concluded that the difluoropyridine and benzothiadiazole as the end-capping units in TQFP and TQBT, respectively, cause a significant decrease in the HOMO energy in comparison with TQT1 and TQT2, while the LUMO is not much altered, as theoretically predicted. Thus, the frontier energy levels of the new small molecules are more favourable to application as electron-acceptors in OSCs, as desired. The POEGT polymer oxidises at smaller potentials, as expected, i.e. its HOMO energy (−4.74 eV) is the highest among the series and its reduction onset is at larger potentials (ELUMO = −2.98 eV). These values compare well with those estimated for poly(3-alkylthiophene)s, whose HOMO and LUMO energies (determined by CV) have been reported at approximately −4.9 and −3.1 eV, respectively.21 The electrochemical data of the compounds are listed in Table 1.
2.4. Photophysical properties

Fig. 4a and b present the UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the new small molecules, TQBT and TQFP, in several solvents of different polarity and the absorption of spin-cast films prepared from dichloromethane solutions. Table 1 lists the absorption maxima and optical bandgaps, Eg, estimated from the spectra of solid films, as shown in Fig. S14 of ESI.† The study of the optical properties of TQT1 and TQT2, including solvatochromic studies, were reported by us in a previous study.18 The absorption spectrum of POEGT in a solid film is shown in Fig. 4c, along with the absorptions of TQT1 and TQT2 included for comparison purposes.

As observed, the lowest energy band in the absorption spectra of TQFP and TQBT is in the 400–550 nm range, significantly blue-shifted in comparison with the lower energy bands of TQT1 and TQT2, which extend up to the NIR region. This is in agreement with the DFT studies, which assigned the enlarged HOMO–LUMO energy gap of TQFP and TQBT to the significantly lowered HOMO energy due to their shorter π-electron delocalisation in comparison with TQT1 and TQT2. The solvatochromism and solvatofluorochromism of TQFP and TQBT were evaluated. While the absorption spectra of both compounds remain mostly unchanged upon increasing solvent polarity (Δλabs = 7 nm), more significant changes are observed in the emission spectra (Fig. 4a and b). For TQFP, the emission maxima shift substantially to lower energies with increasing solvent polarity (Δλem = 65 nm, 2300 cm−1), indicating that the lowest energy transition has a strong charge transfer character, as anticipated by DFT studies. A good linear correlation exists between the Stokes shift and the solvent polarity parameter ET(30)22,23 (Fig. S15 of ESI†), even for protic solvents. These results suggest that there is a stronger interaction with the solvent in the excited state, mainly through non-specific interactions, due to an increase in permanent electric dipole moment in the excited state compared to the ground state.22,23 In contrast, for TQBT, the emission spectra do not vary significantly with solvent polarity (Δλem = 12 nm, 360 cm−1) and no clear correlation between Stokes shift and solvent ET(30) was found (Fig. S15 of ESI†). The effects of protic solvents could not be evaluated due to the low solubility of TQBT in alcohols. This lack of linear correlation suggests that there is no significant change in solvation interaction in the excited state, either through specific or non-specific interactions. Thus, these results agree with the DFT calculations for TQBT, which show that there is no significant change in electron density and thus, in the dipole moment, between ground and excited states.
In the solid film absorption spectra, the maxima of TQBT and TQFP are only slightly red-shifted compared with those of solutions and a pronounced shoulder appears in the lowest energy absorption band of TQBT. Although its origin could not be determined, we conjecture that this shoulder could be related to intermolecular absorption processes from regions of the film with some crystallinity or ordering. A similar spectral characteristic has been well described for regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) for which the shoulder intensity was related to the degree of intermolecular ordering in the films.24 The hypothesis of intermolecular ordering in the solid film of TQBT is also consistent with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of POEGT:TQBT blends, shown in the next section, which reveal fibrillar structures. As for POEGT, the polymer in film exhibits a single absorption band with a maximum at 527 nm, comparing well with the absorption of rr-P3HT whose maximum is at about 530 nm.21 Interestingly, the absorption band of POEGT exhibits a small shoulder at around 600 nm, also resembling the spectrum of rr-P3HT and therefore indicating the presence of crystalline regions.
2.5. Organic photovoltaic devices
In view of the frontier molecular orbital energies of the small molecules relative to POEGT, the four small molecules were used as electron-acceptors in combination with POEGT as the electron-donor in the active layer of BHJ-OSCs. The cells were fabricated with the general structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al (see Experimental section for details). The blends were spin-coated from 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), anisole (AN) and mixtures of anisole and ethanol (AN/EtOH). Table 2 shows the performance parameters, determined under simulated solar irradiation (AM 1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2, of the cells prepared with 1:1 (D:A) blends. In some cases, cells with different active layer (AL) thicknesses were prepared for the sake of comparison. No further treatments were implemented in the cells nor were additives used, in order to better observe the effect of the modification of the acceptor only on cell operation. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. Cells with 1:2 and 2:1 (D:A ratio) blends prepared from 70:30 anisole/ethanol mixtures were also prepared, but their efficiencies did not surpass 1:1 blends (Table S1 of ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the cells are collected in Fig. S17 of ESI.† AFM was employed to characterise the morphology of the active layers (Fig. 6 and Fig. S18, S19 of ESI†).

As observed, the efficiencies of the cells are low, reaching a maximum of 0.39–0.40% (PCE) for the cells with POEGT:TQBT blends prepared from 50:50 anisole/ethanol mixtures. It should be noted that the solubility of POEGT in ethanol is only moderate, which precluded us from increasing the ethanol ratio in POEGT:TQBT blend solutions. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, these are the first results demonstrating BHJ-OSC cells with non-fullerene acceptors processed from ethanol-based solvent formulations. The known examples of OSCs processed from water/ethanol mixtures are reports on blends of a p-type polymer anchoring branched OEG side groups and derivatives of PC61BM substituted with linear OEG-type groups, reaching a maximum PCE of 1.4%.11 Moreover, it should be remarked that the absorption spectrum and molecular structure of POEGT are comparable to those of P3HT, today a relatively low performing polymer in OSCs. In fact, the highest efficiencies reported for OSCs based on P3HT:PCBM blends are around 5%, upon implementing device optimizations, while most devices lie between 2–3% in PCE.25 Considering that VOC is related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor, it would be expected that TQT2, owing to its raised LUMO, would result in cells with larger VOC. The observed discrepancies may be related to polarization effects brought about by specific intra- and/or intermolecular organisations at the D/A interfaces which affect the energies of the frontier molecular orbitals involved. Compared with the cells prepared from anisole/ethanol mixtures, those with POEGT:TQBT are the most efficient, showing enhanced PCE (0.4%), short-circuit current (JSC) (−1.49 mA cm−2) and VOC values (0.92 eV). The AFM images obtained for the POEGT:TQBT (1:1) blend films reveal fibrillar-type structures, as shown in Fig. 6, which are more evident for the films prepared from 1,2-dichlorobenzene and anisole/ethanol mixtures. These are also the films which correspond to larger fill factors (FF) within the POEGT:TQBT series, thereby indicating better charge transport within the active layer. The films prepared from anisole (Fig. 6b), although exhibiting contrast in the phase image, also reveal structuring at a smaller scale. Since the absorptions of TQBT and TQFP cover a similar spectral region and their molar absorptivities at the absorption maxima (measured in solution) are of the same magnitude (for TQBT, λmax/nm (logε/dm3 mol−1 cm−1): 350 (4.48), 465 (4.41); for TQFP, λmax/nm (logε/dm3 mol−1 cm−1): 308 (4.75), 463 (4.41)), the fibrillar-type morphology of the POEGT:TQBT active layers should be, at least in part, the origin of the improvement observed for TQBT-containing cells. In fact, fibrillar-type film morphologies have been related to improved charge carrier mobility and superior device performance in various D:A blends, of which the most studied systems correspond to rr-P3HT:PCBM blends.26 Hence, it can be expected that molecular ordering and/or polymer chain alignment also occur in POEGT:TQBT, resulting in self-assemblies that favour charge transport and possibly exciton dissociation within the blends. Considering that the absorption spectrum of TQBT in solid film shows a pronounced shoulder (Fig. 4b) which may be attributed to intermolecular processes in semi-crystalline or ordered regions, the tendency of TQBT to self-organise into ordered intermolecular assemblies might be the origin of the fibrillar-type morphologies observed in POEGT:TQBT blends. Thus, it can be concluded that the introduction of the benzo-thiadiazole units should promote intermolecular interactions, presumably via π–π interactions between the planar fused benzothiadiazole units. TQFP, whose end-capping units are substituted with fluorine atoms, did not evidence intermolecular ordering features in the absorption spectrum or AFM images, which differs from reports showing that the introduction of fluorine atoms in the aromatic systems of several small molecules and polymers promotes intermolecular aggregates via formation of non-covalent F···H bonds, resulting in enhanced device performance.27–29 As observed in Fig. S18g and h of ESI,† the POEGT:TQFP blends processed from anisole and anisole/ethanol showed the more homogeneous surfaces of the blend series, with the lowest rms values, of 0.21 and 0.19 nm, respectively, and without perceptible aggregation. These morphologies, indicating good miscibility between POEGT and TQFP, can be related to the JSC values found for the corresponding cells, displayed in Table 2, which are the largest among the series, following the cells of POEGT:TQBT in anisole/ethanol. The AFM images of the other blends, composed of TQT1 and TQT2 and shown in Fig. S18a–e of ESI,† although exhibiting low rms values (from 0.24 nm to 0.46 nm), reveal aggregates when the processing solvent is DCB (Fig. S18a and d, ESI†) and large phase separation at the surface in the blends processed from anisole (Fig. S18b and e, ESI†) or 70:30 anisole/ethanol (Fig. S18c, ESI†), as indicated by the observed contrast in the respective phase images. From this set of results, it can be concluded that the low cell performances of both TQT1 and TQT2 are probably related to unfavourable blend morphologies for PV operation, containing large aggregates. For POEGT:TQFP blends, cells processed from 70:30 anisole/ethanol were fabricated and a positive trend in PV performance accompanied by more homogenous and smoother blend morphologies was obtained from DCB as the processing solvent than with the more polar solvent formulation, i.e. 70:30 anisole/ethanol. For TQBT-containing cells, it was found that its molecular structure, bearing benzothiadiazole groups as terminal units, enabled blend processing from 50:50 anisole/ethanol and promoted intermolecular ordering, likely being the origin of the obtained improvements in cell operation. Hence, from these studies, the molecular structure of TQBT is established as the most beneficial for applications as electron-acceptor in OSCs processed from ethanol-based solvent formulations.
3. Experimental
3.1. Material and methods
The synthesis of TQT1 and TQT2 was previously reported by us.18 All reactions were carried out under inert (N2) atmosphere using a dual vacuum/nitrogen line unless otherwise specified. All solvents used under inert atmosphere were dried by refluxing over a suitable drying agent followed by distillation under N2. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker “Advance II” spectrometer (300 or 400 MHz). Elemental analyses were obtained from the IST elemental analysis service. High resolution ESI positive mode mass spectra were obtained on a QqTOF Impact IIt mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) operating in high resolution mode. The molecular weight analysis of POEGT was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in a Waters 1515 chromatograph with three Styragel columns (HR5E, HR4, HR3) in series with a Waters 2414 differential refractometer, using monodisperse polystyrenes in THF as standards. All analyses were performed in filtered (0.2 μm, Millipore Millex HV) THF solutions. All the solvents used in spectroscopic and electrochemical methods were of HPLC grade. DSC thermograms were obtained with a Netzsch DSC 200F3 using aluminium crucibles. The measurements were carried out under nitrogen with heating/cooling rates of 10 °C min−1.

3.2. Measurements
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Cecil 7200 spectrophotometer or a Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Horiba SPEX 212 I Fluorolog Spectrofluorometer. All emission spectra were collected with correction files for wavelength-dependent instrument sensitivity. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed using a Solartron potentiostat and a three-electrode set-up equipped with a platinum wire as counter electrode, a platinum working electrode and a saturated calomel electrode or Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 0.1 M TBABF4 electrolyte solution at 50 mV s−1 scan rate. Ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as external reference. HOMO and LUMO energies estimated from voltammograms were calculated from the onset for the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, after referring to the vacuum level and considering the energy level of Fc/Fc+ as 4.80 eV below the vacuum level, through the equations: EHOMO (eV) = −(Eox,onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.80) and ELUMO (eV) = −(Ered,onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.80).
3.3. DFT/TDDFT calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent (TDDFT) calculations were carried out using GAMESS-US31 version R3. A range-corrected CAMB3LYP32 functional, with 65% HF exact exchange at long range and 19% at short range, was used in both ground-and excited-state calculations. A 6-31G** basis set was used in either DFT or TDDFT calculations. CAMB3LYP slightly overestimates excitations with a scaling scheme applied to the reported values (Ereported = ETDDFT × 0.98 − 0.06).33 HOMO energies were estimated following the methodology described in ref. 18 based on the PBE0 functional and ELUMO = EHOMO + ETDDFTexcitation.
3.4. OSC device fabrication and characterisation
The devices were fabricated over glass/ITO (ITO: indium tin oxide) substrates cleaned by washing with distilled water and a non-ionic detergent, distilled water, acetone (HPLC grade), and isopropyl alcohol (HPLC grade) under ultrasound. The substrates were then subjected to UV-oxygen plasma for 3 min before an aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid) (Heraeus Clevios PVP.Al 4083) was spin-coated on top, yielding a 40 nm thick film. The PEDOT:PSS layer was then dried at 125 °C for 10 min and the active blends were spin-coated on top. Given that different materials and solvents resulted in different film thicknesses, the concentrations of blend solutions were adjusted to yield comparable film thicknesses. The blend solutions with TQT1, TQT2, TQFP and TQBT in dichlorobenzene were prepared with concentrations of 15, 30, 30 and 15 mg mL−1 (total concentration), respectively, with concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in anisole. The blends prepared from 1,2-dichlorobenzene or anisole were stirred on a hot plate at ca. 125 °C for 48 hours. In the case of the blends with anisole/ethanol, they were first stirred in anisole for 48 hours at ca. 125 °C and then ethanol was added and the solutions were stirred for three more hours at ca. 75 °C. The concentration of anisole/ethanol solutions was 10 mg mL−1 for 70:30 (v/v) mixtures and 5 mg mL−1 for 50:50 (v/v) mixtures. The blend solutions were then spin-coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates previously heated on a hot plate at 125 °C (for the blends in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and anisole) or at 75 °C (for the blends of anisole/ethanol). 20 nm of calcium followed by 60–100 nm of aluminum were then evaporated on top at a base pressure below 2 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask, defining a device active area of 0.24 cm2. At least 8 devices were prepared for each condition. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured under inert atmosphere (N2) and using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, 69920, Newport) with simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was measured with a calibrated solar cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained under short-circuit conditions, using a homemade system with a Xe lamp as light source.
3.5. AFM analysis
AFM measurements were performed on a Nano Observer microscope from Concept Scientific Instruments (Les Ulis, France), operating in noncontact mode. Cantilevers with a resonance frequency between 200 and 400 kHz and silicon probes with tip radius smaller than 10 nm were used. All images were taken at 256 × 256 pixel resolution and processed with Gwyddion (version 2.26) software.
4. Conclusions
In summary, two new small molecules and a new polythiophene derivative substituted with hydrophilic OEG solubilising groups for application as electron-acceptors and electron donor, respectively, in BHJ-OSCs, were synthesised. From the quantum mechanical studies, it was found that the large dihedral angles between the TQ core and the end-capping units in TQFP and TQBT, difluoropyridine and benzothiadiazole, respectively, caused a confinement of the HOMO to the central TQ core, lowering the energy of that orbital and increasing the HOMO–LUMO bandgap, in relation to analogous compounds TQT1 and TQT2 containing thienyl groups as end-capping units. The introduction of OEG groups provided good solubility in low toxic solvents, such as anisole, and moderate solubility in ethanol, without compromising the solubility in less polar organic solvents. The new small molecules, TQFP and TQBT, also showed enhanced solubility in ethanol in comparison with TQT1 and TQT2, although solubility in water was negligible for all the molecules. The electrochemical studies allowed us to conclude that the introduction of difluoropyridine and benzothiadiazole units as the end-capping units to replace the thienyl units in TQT1 and TQT2 caused a lowering of the HOMO level, as desired for utilizing the new compounds as electron-acceptors in OSCs and in accordance with the theoretical calculations. The new polythiophene derivative, POEGT, composed of thienyl rings substituted with OEG chains alternated with non-substituted rings, showed absorption resembling that of rr-P3HT and enhanced solubility in low toxicity solvents, such as anisole and ethanol. BHJ-OSCs fabricated with blends of the new small molecules as acceptors and the new polymer processed from anisole and anisole/ethanol mixtures exhibited performances at the same level as reference cells processed from 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The most efficient devices, showing PCE of 0.4%, resulted from the blends of POEGT:TQBT processed from 70:30 and 50:50 anisole/ethanol. For these cells, the AFM analysis showed a fibrillar-type structured surface, indicating intermolecular ordered packings in the blends. From the comparative studies of all the small molecules, it was determined that the molecular design of TQBT is the most advantageous for applications as electron-acceptor in OSCs, combining low HOMO and LUMO energy levels that result in high VOC and tendency to form self-assembled aggregates favourable to PV operation. Overall, this study provides guidelines for the design of non-fullerene acceptors for the fabrication of OSCs processed from environmentally friendly solvents.
