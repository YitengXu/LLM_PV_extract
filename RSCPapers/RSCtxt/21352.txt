    , Accepted 10th March 2021First published on 12th March 2021AbstractA self-assembled polar monolayer (SAPM) is proposed to serve as the hole-transport layer (HTL) in optoelectronic devices. To illustrate our working principle, a superior performance of organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) photodetectors and solar cells is reported. A monolayer of poly[3-(6-carboxyhexyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3HT–COOH) was prepared on an ITO anode through a self-assembled process as HTL. It was found that the self-assembled P3HT–COOH monolayer exhibited a preferential dipole orientation on the ITO and possessed an electric field pointing toward the ITO side, which produced a positive shift of lowest-dark-current-density bias and a reduced work function relative to the spin-coated film. The presence of this internal electric field in OIHP photodetectors facilitates charge collection and assists carrier transport. Additionally, the higher LUMO level of SAPM could effectively block electron injection and lower the dark current density in comparison with that made from spin-coated P3HT–COOH. As a result, an OIHP photodetector with SAPM as the HTL demonstrated a detectivity of more than 3.03 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1, a response time of 95 ns, a responsivity of 0.479 AW−1, and a stable responsivity over 11 decades. Moreover, solar cells based on SAPM exhibit much better power conversion efficiency than conventional PEDOT:PSS-based devices. All these outstanding results can be extended to many other material systems, which ensure that our approach represents a key step toward the advancement in the development of cost-effective and high-performance semiconductor optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
The development of optoelectronic technologies enables the realization of next-generation smart living.1–3 Some optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and solar cells, are key components for converting radiation into photocurrent and play important roles including advancing technologies for energy consumption, automated unmanned driving and factories, and environmental monitoring. Generally, commercially available optoelectronic devices are based on conventional inorganic semiconductors, such as silicon or indium gallium arsenide, which require costly manufacturing processes, including molecular-beam epitaxy and metal–organic chemical vapor deposition.4–6 Organic and organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) materials are increasingly attractive due to their advantages of low-temperature solution processing, high-throughput manufacture, and large-area applications over their inorganic counterparts and hence, are becoming important components in optoelectronic applications. Both kinds of materials have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in photogenerated charge collection. For example, the power conversion efficiencies of organic and OIHP solar cells have skyrocketed in the past 10 years to currently exceed 18% and 25%, respectively.7,8
A typical architecture for organic semiconductor (or OIHP)-based optoelectronic devices, including photodetectors and solar cells,9,10 comprise a photoactive layer sandwiched between hole and electron transport layers (HTLs and ETLs, respectively).11,12 Aiming for devices with flexible features, organic materials for HTLs and ETLs are also indispensable. The common organic materials for HTLs are poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), N,N′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)-methoxy)-hexyloxy)phenyl)-N,N′-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)biphenyl-4,4′-diamine (OTPD), and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA). PEDOT:PSS is well-known to degrade devices due to the acidity of the PSS chain;13,14 whereas OTPD and PTAA have relatively higher LUMO levels, which can effectively block electrons leaking to the anode.15 In addition, the surface character of the former film is hydrophilic, whereas the latter two are hydrophobic. Differences in the surface property of HTLs can affect the morphology of the subsequently deposited photoactive layer, resulting in a distinct performance.16 As reported by Bi et al.,16 OIHP films grown on the wetting surface of PEDOT:PSS have a large density of small grains close to the PEDOT:PSS interface, leading to a large density of traps at grain boundaries, whereas those grown on the nonwetting surface have a much larger grain size and much reduced charge recombination at the HTL/OIHP interface. Till now, OIHPs have demonstrated their promising applications as photodetectors with a highest detectivity of 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at −0.1 V17 and response speed as fast as ns for a tiny device area of 0.04 mm2.18 Moreover, though those HTLs give good performance in optoelectronic devices, they are all deposited by spin-coating methods, which still requires some delicate adjustments to the facilities to complete the process.
Herein, we propose and demonstrate high-performance OHIP photodetectors using a self-assembled polar monolayer (SAPM) as the HTL. A monolayer of poly[3-(6-carboxyhexyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3HT–COOH) was selected as the HTL material prepared by a self-assembled process on an ITO electrode. Quite interestingly, the performance of photodetectors based on the SAPM is much better than those with HTLs deposited by typical spin-coating methods and the commonly used PEDOT:PSS film. Moreover, the key figures of merit of a photodetector, including the detectivity, response time, and responsivity, outperform all the devices ever reported based on similar structures and active materials. In order to understand the underlying mechanism of the ultrahigh performance of our devices, both optical and electrical characterizations were carried out. We found that the self-assembled P3HT–COOH monolayer was well-oriented and formed a dipole layer producing an electric field toward the ITO substrate. This P3HT–COOH dipole monolayer could not only serve as an efficient charge blocking layer, but also could facilitate charge collection and transportation to the anode. As a result, the dark current density was greatly reduced, the detectivity was largely improved, and the response time was extremely fast. Further, when implementing our SAPM in OIHP solar cells, the power conversion efficiency was much better than in the conventional devices based on PEDOT:PSS. The SAPM shown here can be applied to many other semiconductor material systems. Therefore, our proposed methodology provides an excellent route for the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material preparation
Poly[3-(6-carboxyhexyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3HT–COOH) was synthesized in our lab while polyethylenimine (PEI, Lumtech Inc.), PC61BM (Lumtech Inc.), and PEDOT:PSS (PH1000, Heraeus Inc.) were purchased commercially and used as received. Lead iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and TCI Chemicals, respectively. The perovskite precursor solution (MAPbI3, 40 wt%) was prepared as follows: PbI2 was mixed with MAI at a molar ratio of 1:1 dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, >99%, Arcos) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99%, Arcos) with the volume ratio of 1:0.19. The mixed precursor solution was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h on a hot plate.
2.2. Fabrication of the photodetector
Patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrates (15 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ethanol, buffer solution, acetone, and isopropanol in sequence and dried in a N2 gas flow before use. Those substrates were then treated with ultraviolet (UV)-O3 surface cleaning for 10 min to make the substrate surface hydrophilic. Three types of hole-transport layers, including spin-coated P3HT–COOH, self-assembled P3HT–COOH, and spin-coated PEDOT:PSS, were deposited on the treated ITO substrates. For the spin-coated P3HT–COOH film, P3HT–COOH solution in DMF with a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 was prepared on the ITO glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 45 s followed by thermal treatment at 140 °C for 10 min. For the self-assembly film, the treated ITO substrates were dipped in a more dilute P3HT–COOH solution (0.1 mg mL−1) for 16 h. Later on, the substrate was soaked into DMF and sonicated to remove the residues to form a monolayer on the surface. For the reference film, PEDOT:PSS was mixed with isopropanol at a volume ratio of 1:8 and stirred at 500 rpm overnight before depositing onto the ITO glass substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 45 s followed by thermal annealing at 145 °C for 10 min. The preheated perovskite precursor solution at 70 °C was spin-coated on the HTL at 4000 rpm for 25 s and the film was rinsed with ether during spinning. Then the perovskite film was annealed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 1 h. After thermal annealing, the PC61BM layer was deposited on the perovskite film by spin-coating from a PC61BM solution of 25 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (CB) at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then the resulting film was dried in a N2 environment for 45 min. Afterward, the PEI layer was prepared from 0.1 wt% in methanol by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the photodetector was finished by thermal evaporating silver (Ag, 100 nm). The device area defined by the overlapping of the ITO and Ag electrode was 0.039 cm2 The device fabrication procedures were carried out in a N2-filled glove box.
2.3. Characterization details
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OIHP photodetectors were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 source power meter under an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a calibrated solar simulator (Newport Inc.) with an AM 1.5G filter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were collected using a setup composed of a lamp system (Newport Inc.), a chopper, a monochromator, a lock-in amplifier, and a standard silicon photodetector (ENLI Technology). Absorption spectra were recorded by an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, LAMBDA 750) with a blank ITO glass as the baseline. The response time was monitored by an oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO5054A) under a 50 μs pulse laser of 650 nm wavelength and frequency of 1 MHz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Materials characterization

Fig. 1a presents the MAPbI3-based perovskite photodetector structure (ITO/HTL/MAPbI3/PC61BM/PEI/Ag) along with the molecular structures of the used HTL materials. Three kinds of HTLs were prepared from polymer materials of P3HT–COOH and PEDOT:PSS using different deposition approaches. P3HT–COOH films were deposited on the ITO by either a spin-coating method or self-assembly approach. PEDOT:PSS is the most commonly used HTL material and served as the reference. Devices with HTLs prepared from the spin-coated P3HT–COOH film (spin-coated device), self-assembled P3HT–COOH monolayer (SAM-device), and spin-coated PEDOT:PSS layer (PEDOT:PSS-device, reference) were fabricated for our study and for comparison.

(b) The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra of the pristine ITO and P3HT–COOH on the ITO. (Inset: Room-in spectra in the onset region). (c) The energy level diagram of the fabricated perovskite photodetector. (d) The UV-vis absorption spectra of the MAPbI3 perovskite layers on the three kinds of HTLs. 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (φ) of the ITO coated with P3HT–COOH was measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, PHI 5000 VERSAPROBE II) with a He I (21.22 eV) photon source. Fig. 1b presents the cutoff (Ecutoff) and onset (Ei) energy regions in the UPS spectra. The HOMO level of a material can be determined according to the equation φ = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − Ei). The work function of the ITO substrate was estimated to be 4.87 eV. For the ITO/P3HT–COOH samples, φ of the spin-coated film was 5.38 eV, while that of the self-assembled film was 5.27 eV. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra,19 the optical gap yielded from the absorption edges of the spin-coated and self-assembled P3HT–COOH films were 1.97 and 2.16 eV, respectively. Based on the obtained optical gaps, one can deduce that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the spin-coated P3HT–COOH and self-assembled P3HT–COOH films were −3.41 and −3.11 eV, respectively. We tried to measure the thickness of this self-assembled layer. Based on the Beer–Lambert law, the thickness of the self-assembled layer was estimated to be less than 1 nm, which was approximately the length of the hexyl carboxylic acid side chain in P3HT–COOH (see Fig. S1, ESI†), suggesting that a monolayer of P3HT–COOH molecules was formed on the ITO surface through the self-assembled process. The energy level diagram for those devices is displayed in Fig. 1c, revealing a cascading band alignment structure for hole transport.
It has been shown19 that the average perovskite grain size on PEDOT:PSS, spin-coated P3HT–COOH, and self-assembled P3HT–COOH are 155, 394, and 409 nm, respectively. The nonwetting surface of P3HT–COOH layer not only can assist the crystal formation but also can form high-quality perovskites on top of it.16Fig. 1d shows the strong absorption spectra of the perovskite films grown on these three HTLs, showing no difference in the spectral range from the near-IR to UV region.
3.2. Perovskite photodetectors’ performance

Fig. 2a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) of the devices in the dark and under AM 1.5G one sun illumination. All the devices showed similar photocurrent densities under illumination. In the forward bias regime, the devices function as photovoltaics, with the performance parameters summarized in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†). In brief, the power conversion efficiency of PEDOT:PSS-devices of 12.25% was comparable to the literature reports20,21 while both P3HT–COOH devices performed better than the PEDOT:PSS-device, especially the SAM-device, which exhibited a much higher PCE of 17.21%. The details for the operation of the photovoltaic mode will be reported separately in another publication.19 Here, we only focus on the performance of the photodetector mode.

The dark J–V curves for those devices varied remarkably. The dark current density of devices at reverse bias followed the order: SAM- < spin-coated < PEDOT:PSS-devices. Both photodetectors prepared from P3HT–COOH HTLs had a lower dark current compared to the reference cell. Especially, the SAM-device exhibited a significantly reduced dark current density. As an example, the dark current density values were 0.38×, 0.042×, and 1.63 × 10−6 A cm−2 at −0.1 V for the spin-coated, SAM-, and PEDOT:PSS-devices, respectively. The dark current suppression of P3HT–COOH devices can be understood as due to the higher electron-injection barrier at the ITO/P3HT–COOH interface (1.46 or 1.76 eV) than at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface of 1.1 eV, which could effectively block electron injection in the dark and lower the dark current. Interestingly, the SAM-device had the lowest dark current density at +0.1 V, which was quite different from the other two shown at 0 V. The positive shift of the lowest-dark-current bias of the SAM-device suggests the existence of a reversed built-in electric field inside the device. Wan et al.22 reported that the arrangement of the carboxylic groups on the ITO surface can induce an interfacial dipole. According to Chang et al.,19 the surface property of self-assembled P3HT–COOH is more hydrophobic than that of the spin-coated P3HT–COOH film. Because the carboxylic group in P3HT–COOH polymer can rotate freely, it is likely that most of those carboxylic groups orient toward the ITO surface in the liquid phase, such that the anchoring density of carboxylic groups on the ITO surface increases, leaving less density of carboxylic groups pointing toward the P3HT–COOH surface. Consequently, a highly oriented electric dipole layer is formed (inset of Fig. 2a), resulting in a different surface character. Further, the UPS result suggests that the self-assembled film had a 0.11 eV reduction of the HOMO level of the self-assembled layer compared with the spin-coated film, indicating the dipole monolayer was well-oriented and pointing away from the ITO.23 Thus, the observed built-in electric field could be ascribed to the induced P3HT–COOH interfacial monolayer dipole.

Fig. 2b displays the wavelength-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) for all the devices measured at −0.1 V, showing a photoresponse from 330 to 800 nm and an integrated photocurrent density in the order: PEDOT:PSS- < spin-coated < SAM-devices. Devices with P3HT–COOH HTLs had a higher photocurrent than the reference device, while the SAM-device collected more photocharges than the spin-device. This is because that perovskite films grown on P3HT–COOH HTL have a larger crystal grain size, and a larger grain size is beneficial for creating long-lived carriers to enable efficient charge transport. Further, the relatively higher LUMO level of the self-assembled P3HT–COOH compared to the spin-coated layer has a better ability to block electrons migrating from the perovskite layer into the HTL. Therefore, the SAM-device possessed a higher photocurrent density.
3.3. Detectivity characterization
Detectivity is an important parameter to characterize device sensitivity and is determined by the responsivity and noise current. We first compared the responsivity of these three devices. By biasing devices at −0.5 to 0 V, the responsivity of each device at an irradiant light wavelength of 633 nm with intensity of 0.25 mW cm−2 is shown in Fig. 3a. Both P3HT–COOH devices exhibited bias-independent responsivity, a result which can be attributed to the minority carrier diffusion in the perovskite layer being unimpeded through the absorber/HTL interface due to the larger perovskite grain size grown on the nonwetting surface.16 The bias-dependent behavior of the PEDOT:PSS-device revealed that the external bias can provide charge carriers to fill up the trap states, which is beneficial for photogenerated carriers traveling through the junction without impediment.24 Taking V = −0.1 V for instance, the spectral responsivity of these three devices is presented in Fig. 3b, showing that both P3HT–COOH devices had higher values than the reference cell in the spectral region.
 Fig. 3  Responsivity and spectral detectivity of the perovskite photodetectors. (a) Responsivities of devices biased at −0.15, −0.1, −0.05, and 0 V under illumination at 633 nm wavelength with 0.25 mW cm−2 input intensity. (b) The spectral responsivity and (c) the specific detectivity of photodetectors at −0.1 V under one sun illumination. 
In order to evaluate the detectivity of the photodetector, we estimated the noise current of our devices. Generally, the noise current is mainly composed of shot noise and thermal noise. Shot noise is given by (2eIdarkB)1/2,17,25–27 where e is the electronic charge constant, Idark is the dark current, and B is the bandwidth. The thermal noise can be expressed as (4kBTB/R)1/2,25–28 where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and R is the resistance of the device. R can be obtained by taking the differential resistance at −0.1 V in Fig. 2a. The noises for the spin-coated, SAM-, and PEDOT:PSS-devices were calculated to be 56.5, 4.21, and 199 fA Hz−1/2, respectively. Notably, the SAM-device had the smallest noise current level. Fig. 3c illustrates the spectral detectivity at −0.1 V estimated from the calculated noise current and spectral responsivity. The SAM-device exhibited the highest detectivity of the order of 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 throughout the UV-visible and into the near-infrared region. For example, at 665 nm, the detectivity values for the spin-coated, SAM-, and PEDOT:PSS-devices were 1.08 × 1012, 1.57 × 1013, and 1.89 × 1011 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively. Both the spin- and SAM-devices carried a higher detectivity than that of the reference device. The detectivity of the SAM-device was an order of magnitude higher than that of the spin-device, a result which confirmed its lowest dark current density among all the devices. Because the SAM-device had the lowest dark current density at +0.1 V, the corresponding detectivity was estimated to be 3.03 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1. Compared to the literature reports, the detectivity of the SAM-device is much higher than the commercial Si photodiode29,30 and other OIHP photodetectors using noncorrosive organic HTL materials other than PEDOT:PSS (see Table 1).31–35

For most applications of photodetectors, including illumination meters and sensors, it is necessary to demonstrate the intensity of the detected light over a wide-intensity range. In such cases, a stable responsivity over a wide light-intensity range is an important property of the photodetector. At a wavelength of 465 nm, we measured the photocurrent under various irradiance intensities at −0.1 V and calculated the corresponding responsivity, with the obtained results shown in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that when the devices were illuminated under the light beam, they all showed a linear photocurrent response in the applied incident photon power range from 10−12 to 10−1 W cm−2. The photocurrent linearity of the spin-coated and PEDOT:PSS-devices were across 8 decades of intensity, whereas the SAM-device was superior to both at 11 decades. As is known, the linear dynamic range (LDR) is given by LDR = 20 log(Jhigh/Jlow), where Jhigh and Jlow are the highest and the lowest current densities among which the device can keep a linear response to light intensity.33 Thus, the LDR values for the spin-coated, SAM-, and PEDOT:PSS-devices were 140, 200, and 126, respectively. The corresponding responsivity also kept almost constant at the linear response regime. For example, the SAM-device had a stable responsivity from 2.5 pW cm−2 to 0.63 W cm−2.

3.4. Transient photocurrent response characterization
The response speed is another important parameter to characterize the photodetector. The response time of OIHP photodetectors was measured by the transient photocurrent method. The device was illuminated with a pulse laser having 1 μs pulse duration and 50% duty cycle. The used 405 nm wavelength laser could be modulated up to 1 MHz and had a power density of 20 mW cm−2. Rise and fall times are defined as the time to transition between 10% of the minimum current to 90% of the maximum, and from 90% down to 10%, respectively. In all devices, the rise time was slower than the fall time, with the slower component typically attributed to the diffusive contribution to the photocurrent during discharging.36–38 The response times of spin-, SAM-, and PEDOT:PSS-devices yielded 110, 95 and 155 ns, respectively. The obtained value of the PEDOT:PSS-device is similar to the literature reports.17 The SAM-device had the fastest response time of 95 ns, which is comparable to the best recorded of ∼70 ns.18 The faster response time of the SAM-device compared to that of the spin-coated device could be attributed to the monolayer dipole of P3HT–COOH molecules producing an electric field pointing toward the ITO to rapidly sweep hole carriers across the perovskite/P3HT–COOH interface to the ITO anode (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Transient photocurrent response of the perovskite photodetectors. Photocurrent rise and fall of the photodetectors at an input irradiance of 20 mW cm−2. 
From the above study, photodetectors using P3HT–COOH as the HTL performed superior to those with conventional PEDOT:PSS due to much lower dark current and fewer traps at the MAPbI3/HTL interface as indicated by the dark J–V curves and the bias-independent responsivity results. It was also found that the P3HT–COOH HTL prepared by the self-assembly process possessed dramatically different properties than that using spin-coating method. The monolayer P3HT–COOH molecules pursued a higher LUMO level, which could effectively block electron injection from the ITO leading to a much lower dark current of the SAM-device. Additionally, those monolayer molecules also exhibited a preferential dipole orientation on the ITO and produced an electrical field pointing toward the ITO (see inset of Fig. 2a), which could reduce the work function (HOMO level) of P3HT–COOH in comparison with the one prepared by the spin-coating method, showing no orientation preference. The presence of this interfacial dipole field in devices could rapidly sweep photogenerated hole charges out of the perovskite layer to reach the ITO anode. As a result, the SAM-devices had a superior detectivity, response time, and LDR over the spin-coated devices. We point out here that due to the instrumental limitation of measuring the current level down to 0.1 nA, the actual detectivity and LDR of the SAM-devices are believed to be much greater than 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and over 200, respectively.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we successfully demonstrated perovskite photodetectors with superior performance using a polar hole-transport monolayer prepared by a self-assembly approach. Devices with self-assembled P3HT–COOH HTL showed much reduced dark current density in comparison with those using spin-coated P3HT–COOH and PEDOT:PSS films due to the much higher electron-injection barrier. In particular, the SAM-device also exhibited a +0.1 V shift of the lowest-dark-current-density bias, which could be ascribed to the formation of a dipole layer pointing away from the ITO by the monolayer P3HT–COOH molecules during the self-assembling. The produced electric field pointing toward the ITO facilitates hole extraction and shortens the carrier traveling time. As a result, the SAM-device had a detectivity exceeding 3.03 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1, a fast response time of 95 ns, a responsivity of 0.479 AW−1, and an LDR value of more than 200, which outperforms the previous reports. Further, solar cells made with SAPM showed a much better power conversion efficiency than the conventional devices based on PEDOT:PSS HTL. All these outstanding results can be extended to many other semiconductor material systems. Therefore, our approach should be very useful and timely, which paves a useful route for fabricating cost-effective and high-throughput optoelectronic devices with superior performance.
