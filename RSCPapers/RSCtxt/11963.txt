    , Accepted 5th April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractNon-equilibrium Ti4+-doped hematite (Ti-Fe2O3) is explored successfully as an electron transporting layer (ETL) material for planar perovskite solar cells, which were simply processed by quenching the ETL films at high temperature after thermal annealing. High-temperature quenching can fix Ti4+ dopants in the bulk lattices of Ti-Fe2O3 and suppress surficial TiOx segregations on it, which obviously increase the doping density and decrease surficial electron traps in Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, thereby greatly improving their electron transport properties. Hence, the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells with these desired Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs can be boosted to 17.85% along with the stabilized value of 17.05%, which is much higher than that of cells with Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs prepared by routine natural cooling and even the previous record efficiency of planar cells based on Fe2O3 ETLs. Our work contributes to enriching the ETL systems of perovskite solar cells and offers a promising candidate for efficient and photo-stable cells.
Introduction
Organolead trihalide perovskite semiconductors have recently attracted substantial attention as emerging light-harvesting materials for photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are also known as perovskite solar cells not only due to their superior optoelectronic properties but also because of widely available raw materials and feasibility of film deposition via low-temperature solution routes.1–3 These features enable efficient PV cells but with low cost.4 Till now, the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) for single-junction cells has reached up to 22.7%.5 It is steadily approaching that of single-junction monocrystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells,6 which places perovskite solar cells into the center stage of the thin-film PV research community.7
At present, the most efficient perovskite solar cells often utilize a mesoporous structure,2,8 in which a TiO2 bilayer consisting of a mesoporous upperlayer and a compact underlayer is employed as the electron transport layer (ETL). This configuration is presumed to be not only beneficial to boost the PCEs of cells but also alleviate their anomalous photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis to some extent.9,10 However, mesoporous-structured cells often require complicated fabrication procedures, which bring cost and reproducibility concerns in cell fabrication.11,12 Thus, the planar-structured ones without using a mesoporous TiO2 layer emerge as the research focus in view of their simple structures, facile preparation processes and thus low cost, as well as high reproducibility.13–21 Based on various innovative optimizations in constituent materials,14–16 functional film quality and interfaces,17–21 the PCEs of planar-structured cells with TiO2 ETLs are already beyond 20%.14–21 Even so, several challenges are still remaining before they can enter the PV market successfully. For example, when compact TiO2 is used as an ETL, it deteriorates the cell stability under ultraviolet (UV) illumination due to light-induced desorption of surface-absorbed oxygen of TiO2 and high photocatalytic activity of TiO2.9,22,23 However, excellent UV stability is a critical requirement when cells operate continuously in a high altitude region on land or space-environment where UV radiation is relatively intensive.9,24 Besides, compact TiO2 ETLs prepared by conventional solution routes usually contain plenty of surficial oxygen vacancies and structural defects.25–28 Such defects acting as deep-level traps inevitably cause a sluggish electron transfer from organolead trihalide perovskite to TiO2 and excessive charge accumulation at their interface simultaneously, which cause serious photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in planar-structured cells.11,25–27 The J–V hysteresis renders it extremely challenging to estimate the actual efficiency of cells.29
Given the consideration of the above issues, innovative modifications on compact TiO2 ETLs including but not limited to ionic doping,26,30 interface passivation,28,31 and introduction of a down-converting functional layer32 have been reported. And at the same time, alternative materials as potential candidates to replace TiO2 have also been explored extensively, including SnO2,12,23 Fe2O3,9,33,34 CdS,35 SrTiO3,36 Zn2SnO4,37 BaSnO322etc. Among them, Fe2O3 has, in particular, attracted great interest since it not only possesses sluggish UV photocatalytic activity, which is beneficial in enhancing the UV stability of cells but also, it can facilitate rapid electron injection and reduce interface charge accumulation due to its much lower conduction band energy when compared with TiO2, which ultimately alleviates the J–V hysteresis of planar-structured cells.9,33,34 However, Fe2O3 ETLs seem to inherently suffer from poor electrical conductivity in their pristine form,33,38,39 which definitely limits the performance of planar-structured cells. To address this drawback, Wang et al.33 attempted to introduce suitable Ni2+ dopants into Fe2O3 ETLs, which could induce enhanced electron conductivity and downward shift of its conduction band minimum. Hence, the stabilized PCE of the best-performing cell could be improved from 9.2% to 11.6%. And, Huang et al.9 designed a unique Fe2O3 nanoisland structure with high transmittance and excellent electron extraction ability. The cells with these novel Fe2O3 ETLs yielded an increased efficiency and negligible J–V hysteresis. In spite of these remarkable achievements, the PCE of the best-performing cells with Fe2O3 ETLs remains far inferior to that of TiO2-based ones.14–21 Thus, the development of desired Fe2O3 ETLs is still a challenging issue for obtaining efficient and photo-stable perovskite solar cells.
Herein, we propose a facile non-equilibrium Ti4+ doping strategy to enable desired Fe2O3 ETLs, which is achieved by simply quenching the sample at a high temperature after thermal annealing other than routinely natural cooling. High-temperature quenching yields the Ti4+-doped Fe2O3 (Ti-Fe2O3) ETL with much higher carrier density and thereby dramatically improved solar cell performance. Further investigations reveal that the quenching recipe can fix Ti4+ dopants in the bulk lattices of the Fe2O3 host and suppress surficial TiOx segregation partly, which obviously increases the doping density and decreases surficial electron traps in the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL and thus greatly improves its electron extraction properties. So far as we know, our work is the first report to promote the performance of Fe2O3 ETL based perovskite solar cells by a non-equilibrium Ti4+ doping route, which can also be an important reference for developing other efficient ETLs for perovskite solar cells.
Results and discussion
Fe2O3 ETLs with non-equilibrium Ti4+ dopants were prepared by a spin-coating method. Firstly, the precursor films were spin-coated on pre-cleaned FTO substrates with the solution dissolving 0.404 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 10 μL TiCl3 in 10 mL ethanol. After being annealed at 550 °C for 60 min in a muffle furnace, the samples were taken out directly and quenched quickly to room temperature from 550, 450, and 350 °C, respectively. Thus, the Fe2O3 ETLs with non-equilibrium Ti4+ dopants were obtained, which were labeled as quenched Ti-Fe2O3. The sample cooled naturally was also prepared for comparison, and marked as normal Ti-Fe2O3. Detailed procedures are described in the Experimental section.
The influence of the quenching recipe on the PV properties of Ti-Fe2O3 ETL based perovskite solar cells was carefully studied, taking a planar configuration of FTO/Ti-Fe2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag as schematically shown in Fig. 1(a). A corresponding diagram of energy levels of each functional layer can be found in Fig. S1.†9 For a reliable evaluation of the performance of cells, 20 cells with each Ti-Fe2O3 ETL are measured. The statistical PCEs are given in Fig. S2,† which were measured under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight in a reverse scan (from 1.5 to −0.1 V) with a rate of 100 mV s−1. Thus, the average PCE is estimated to be (13.10 ± 0.78)% for the cells based on normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. In contrast, the value steadily improves to (13.95 ± 0.83)%, (14.76 ± 0.99)%, and (16.49 ± 0.71)% in the case of cells based on quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs with the quenching temperatures of 350, 450, and 550 °C, respectively. Obviously, the statistical average PCE shows a significant improvement upon the introduction of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. As to the following discussions, we choose the sample quenched at 550 °C and normal Ti-Fe2O3 as models since a more obvious PCE difference can be observed between the cells fabricated with them. Hereinafter, the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 refers in particular to the one quenched from 550 °C unless otherwise mentioned.

(b) Forward and reverse J–V sweeps under AM 1.5 G simulated illumination corresponding to the optimized cells with normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, respectively. (c) EQE spectra and (d) steady-state power outputs at the maximum power points for the optimized cells, respectively. 
Detailed PV properties of cells fabricated with normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs are investigated as follows. Fig. 1(b) shows the J–V curves including the reverse scan (RS) and the forward scan (FS) for the optimized cells with normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. Corresponding PV parameters including short circuit current density (Jsc), open voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are listed in Table 1. Under RS, the optimized cell with the normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL yields a low PCE of 14.24% with a Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.974 V, and FF of 0.70. In contrast, all the PV parameters improve greatly for the one with the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. The PCE jumps to 17.85% with the corresponding Jsc, FF, and Voc increasing to 21.56 mA cm−2, 1.104 V, and 0.75, respectively. This value exceeds the previous highest efficiency recorded for planar perovskite solar cells based on Fe2O3 ETLs.33,34 Under FS, the increases of PV parameters are similarly observed for this cell. Moreover, it is clear that the higher PCE for the optimized cell with quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL primarily comes from its larger Voc and FF. Fig. 1(c) gives the corresponding EQE spectra. In contrast to the one with the normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, the cell with the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL shows higher EQE values over the entire region, further indicating its better photoelectric conversion ability.2,21 The corresponding integrated Jsc values shown in Fig. S3† match well with the difference observed from the relevant J–V curves. The current density corresponding to its maximum power output as a function of time was further studied for each cell,40 as shown in Fig. S4.† Both the cells exhibit stable outputs during the test period, which is the highly unique advantage of Ti-Fe2O3 ETL based cells compared with the ones with other commonly used ETLs.12,27,41 In comparison, for the cell with the normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, it takes over 20 s to reach the peak current density of 17.45 mA cm−2 under 0.748 V bias voltage, while the current density can rapidly reach a steady value of 19.11 mA cm−2 in about 5 s under 0.892 V for the one with the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. This result implies that the cell with the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL possesses a faster photocurrent response, which probably relates to the decreased charge recombination in the cell.35,42,43 Furthermore, the PCE outputs were derived to be 13.10% and 17.05% for the cells with normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(d). They are close to the values obtained from the corresponding J–V curves under the reverse scan, indicating the relatively weak J–V hysteresis for both cells. Overall, the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL can enable stable planar perovskite solar cells with negligible J–V hysteresis and much improved PV parameters, in particular of Voc and FF.

Now, we focus our attention to clarify the origins of improved PV performance for cells with the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. Because the difference resides only in the ETL between the two cells, fundamental characterization studies on Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs were conducted. Raman measurement was carried out to study the crystallinity of the concerned Ti-Fe2O3 samples. As shown in Fig. S5(a),† all the Raman peaks can be indexed well to α-phase Fe2O3.38 There is no observed difference in peak features between the two samples, indicating their similar crystallinity. The UV-vis spectra of Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs were also collected and are shown in Fig. S5(b).† They almost have the same characteristics as well. The above results suggest that the improved PV performance of the cell is likely irrelevant to the crystallinity and absorbance properties of Ti-Fe2O3 ETL.
The morphology of Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs was further studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Corresponding top-view SEM images are given in Fig. S6.† The one for bare FTO is also provided for clarification. We can thus see that both ETLs appear to be composed of a uniform and pinhole-free Ti-Fe2O3 film that conformally covers the bare FTO. The surficial morphology of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is similar to that of normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. Fig. S7† displays AFM height images of normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, which demonstrates a decreased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness from 7.2 to 5.4 nm by the quenching recipe, which mainly comes from the reduced TiOx segregations on the surface of the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL as discussed below. The difference of RMS roughness cannot account for the improved cell performance considering that a rough ETL is more conducive to electron extraction.30,44 In this regard, the morphology difference of Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs may not be the determining factor for enhanced PV performance of the cell with quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL.
It should be noted that the roughness of the ETL has an influence on the microstructure of the upper organolead trihalide perovskite film as revealed previously,30,45–47 which in turn may affect the cell performance. So the morphology, crystallinity and absorbance properties of CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs are compared systematically. As exhibited in Fig. S8 (a and b),† both CH3NH3PbI3 films are composed of closely packed grains and no pinholes can be found over large areas. Moreover, there is no obvious difference in average grain size between them. Cross-sectional SEM images reveal that nearly all individual grains in each CH3NH3PbI3 film can cross the entire film thickness and form vertically oriented grain boundaries (Fig. S8 (c and d)),† which is highly desired for efficient planar perovskite solar cells.17,48 Similarly, the difference between them is negligible. Furthermore, XRD patterns and UV-vis spectra shown in Fig. S8 (e and f)† suggest the identical crystallinity and absorbance properties of CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. Thus, the potential contributions related to CH3NH3PbI3 film can be rationally excluded.
Since the normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs have similar crystallinity and morphology that give rise to similar properties of upper CH3NH3PbI3 films as well, other factors should be explored to understand the origins of improved performance for the cell with quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the composition on their surface and in the bulk of concerned Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S9,† the XPS peaks with bonding energies of ∼710.7 eV and ∼724.3 eV can be assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively.39,49 The characteristic peak of O1s located at ∼529.8 eV was also detected in both samples,50 as revealed in Fig. 2(b). The clear XPS peaks with bonding energies of ∼457.9 eV and ∼463.8 eV as shown in Fig. 2(c) can be identified to Ti4+ dopants in Fe2O3 based on previous studies.39,51,52 These results indicate the successful doping of Ti4+ ions into the Fe2O3 host, and the pure composition of both Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. Moreover, the intensities of Fe 2p XPS peaks are comparable both on the surface and in the bulk of normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. The intensity of the O 1s XPS peak is only similar in the bulk of both samples, whereas the value of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is higher than that of normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL on their surface. These results suggest fewer surficial oxygen vacancies in the quenched sample.53 It should be noted that as for the XPS peak intensity of Ti 2p, the difference is remarkable both on the surface and in the bulk of two samples, as revealed in Fig. 2(c). On the one hand, in the bulk of the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, the intensity of the Ti 2p XPS peak is higher than that of the normal one. It means that the density of Ti4+ dopants in its bulk of the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is higher than that of the normal one. Quantitative results shown in Fig. 2(d) reveal that the Ti/Fe ratio increases from 2.91% for the normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL to 4.05% for the quenched one. On the other hand, for both samples, the intensities of Ti 2p XPS peaks on their surface are higher than those in their bulk. This means that the surficial TiOx segregations exist in both samples inevitably.39,51 Similar phenomena have been frequently observed in Ti-Fe2O3 nanostructured films by other groups.39,51,52,54 Because of the low formation temperature, the TiOx segregations inevitably contain a mass of compositional and structural defects that usually act as electron traps,39,51,52,54,55 which will lead to the extremely inferior electron transport properties of Ti-Fe2O3. However, as quantitatively revealed in Fig. 2(d), surficial TiOx segregations for quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL are alleviated significantly in contrast to that of normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. Overall, the XPS results convey the fact that the quenching recipe can increase the doping density in its bulk and suppress TiOx segregations on thesurface of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, which are highly desired for efficient Fe2O3 ETLs.

Furthermore, according to XPS results, a schematic diagram is proposed in Fig. 3, which may provide insight into the mechanism of increased doping density in its bulk and suppressed TiOx segregations on the surface of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL by the quenching recipe. It is assumed that when the sample is being calcined at 550 °C, the distribution of Ti4+ ions in bulk lattices of the Fe2O3 host is uniform because of the increased solubility of Ti4+ ions in Fe2O3 at high temperature.39,51,52,54 Moreover, the diffusion of Ti4+ ions is relatively fast at this temperature. After the temperature is lowered, Ti4+ ions will precipitate because of the decreased solubility, and diffuse from the bulk onto the surface of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. For the natural cooling process, it provides enough time for Ti4+ ion diffusion at high speed to reach the equilibrium state. So, low Ti4+ doping density in its bulk and clear TiOx segregations on its surface can be detected for normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs. In contrast, Ti4+ ions will be fixed in the bulk lattices of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL because the remaining duration for high-speed Ti4+ ion diffusion is extremely short when it was quenched from 550 °C to room temperature quickly. Hence, the quenching recipe can induce non-equilibrium Ti4+ doping and enable higher doping density in its bulk and fewer TiOx segregations on the surface of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagrams of the possible mechanism for increased doping density in its bulk and suppressed segregation on the surface of the Ti-Fe2O3 sample. 
The increased Ti4+ doping density in its bulk and suppressed surficial segregations is conducive to improving the electrical-transport properties of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. To clarify this, electron-only dark J–V curves of the samples were studied by employing the stacking configuration of FTO/Ti-Fe2O3/PCBM/Ag as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a). As shown in Fig. 4(a), under the same bias voltages, the higher current density can be found in the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, indicating its higher electron conductivity. Furthermore, a closer analysis of the J–V curves can extract the electron trap density and the mobility of the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL.48,56 At low bias voltage, the linear J–V curves indicate an Ohmic response of the samples. Then, the current density increases nonlinearly when the bias voltage exceeds the trap-filled limit (VTFL), demonstrating that all of the trap states are filled. Based on the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) theory, the VTFL depends on trap density: VTFL = entL2/(2εε0),56 where e represents the elementary charge of the electron, nt is the trap density, L represents the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL thickness that is found to be ∼60 nm using a step profiler, and ε and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant of Fe2O3 (ε = 33)57 and vacuum permittivity, respectively. The electron trap density is thus estimated to be 2.97 × 1016 cm−3 in normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, while it decreases to 1.02 × 1016 cm−3 in quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL. When the voltage exceeds VTFL, the variation of the dark current density follows the Mott–Gurney law: J = 9εε0V2/(8L3).56 Therefore, electron mobility is obtained as 6.86 × 10−6 and 2.44 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, respectively. Furthermore, carrier concentrations of the samples were analyzed by the Mott–Schottky method,51–53 and the results are given in Fig. 4(b). The values are estimated to be 7.37 × 1019 and 1.43 × 1020 cm−3 for normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, respectively. The carrier density of the quenched sample is about two times as high as that of the normal one. All the electrical measurement results indicate that the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL possesses a lower electron trap density as well as a higher electron mobility and density compared with the normal one, which give rise to its better electron transport properties.

The improved electron transport properties of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL can facilitate efficient electron extraction in ultimate devices, which can be verified by photoluminescence (PL) measurement results. The steady-state PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films deposited on normal and quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs are shown in Fig. 5(a). For comparison, the PL spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 film on glass substrate is given as well. Because of the similar features of CH3NH3PbI3 films, it ensures similar intensity of absorbed photons for the samples investigated. All the emission peaks can be ascribed to the inter-band radiative recombination of photo-induced carriers of CH3NH3PbI3.21,43 The CH3NH3PbI3 film deposited on glass substrate exhibits an intense PL emission centered at ∼773 nm with a linewidth of 38 nm. When a Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is introduced, the PL intensity of CH3NH3PbI3 film is weakened clearly, from which electron extraction across the CH3NH3PbI3/Ti-Fe2O3 interface can be inferred.14,15,21 However, the weakening of the PL intensity for CH3NH3PbI3 film on quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is more obvious with respect to that on the normal one, which suggests its more efficient electron extraction properties.14,21 We further used time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra to quantitatively estimate the dynamics of charge carriers (Fig. 5(b)). The longer lifetime of minority carriers (τ = 119 ns) for CH3NH3PbI3 film on glass substrate indicates its better electronic quality.43,56 Consistent with the steady-state PL results, the lifetime of minority carriers decreases significantly for CH3NH3PbI3 films containing Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, indicating that the obvious charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to Ti-Fe2O3. In comparison, the lifetime of minority carriers for CH3NH3PbI3 film on quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL (τ = 13 ns) is much shorter than that on the normal one (τ = 35 ns). This result further consolidates the inference that the electron extraction of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETL is more rapid and efficient than that of the normal one,14,15,21 which is mainly related to low electron trap density as well as its high electron mobility and density as revealed by the electrical measurement results as shown in Fig. 4. The superior electron extraction properties of quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs are highly conducive to reducing the energy loss of photo-generated electrons during injection and transport, which accounts for the improved PV performance of perovskite solar cells, especially the Voc and FF.2,21,41,42,44,47

Conclusions
In summary, Ti-Fe2O3 films are explored as ETLs with the aim of preparing photo-stable planar perovskite solar cells. In particular, the non-equilibrium Ti4+ doping strategy that is simply processed by quenching Ti-Fe2O3 films at a high temperature after thermal annealing is further proposed to boost the performance of cells. It is found that the high-temperature quenching recipe can fix Ti4+ dopants in bulk lattices of the Fe2O3 host and partially suppress surficial TiOx segregations that usually act as electron traps. Those features endow the quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs with excellent electron transport properties, as a result of low electron trap density as well as high electron mobility and concentration. Consequently, the efficiency of planar perovskite solar cells with quenched Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs can be boosted to 17.85% along with the stabilized value of 17.05%, which are much higher than the ones with normal Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs and even the previous highest efficiency recorded for planar perovskite solar cells with Fe2O3 ETLs. So, our work suggests a favorable route to fabricate efficient and photo-stable perovskite solar cells. It can also be an important reference for developing other efficient ETLs.

Patterned FTO glass (Pilkington TEC8, 8 Ω sq−1) substrates were cleaned by the recipe described elsewhere.48 After a 15 min UV-ozone treatment for further cleaning, the precursor films of Fe2O3 ETLs were spin-coated on pre-cleaned FTO substrates using the solution of 0.404 g Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 10 μL TiCl3 (CAS: 7705-07-9, Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 10 mL ethanol. After being sintered at 550 °C for 60 min in a muffle furnace, the samples were taken out directly from the furnace and quenched quickly to room temperature from 550, 450, and 350 °C, respectively. Thus, the Fe2O3 ETLs with non-equilibrium Ti4+ dopants were obtained, and labeled as quenched Ti-Fe2O3. The sample cooled naturally was also prepared for comparison, which was marked as normal Ti-Fe2O3. All samples were finally transferred to a glovebox for cell fabrication.
Fabrication of planar perovskite solar cells
CH3NH3PbI3 film was deposited on Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs by a Lewis base adduct-based one-step spin-coating method proposed by Park et al.,58 which was slightly modified with a face-down annealing recipe proposed in our previous work to form a (110) texture in the films.48 In detail, a 50 μL precursor containing of 79.5 mg CH3NH3I, 230.5 mg PbI2, 39 mg anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 300 mg anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was added dropwise on the Ti-Fe2O3 ETL, which was spun subsequently at 4500 rpm for 30 s. After the first 6 s of the spinning process, 500 μL of diethyl ether was added dropwise on it by means of an injection syringe. After that, the sample was placed face-up on a hot plate with a preset temperature of 40 °C for 30 s. Subsequently, the film was turned face-down and annealed at a constant temperature of 100 °C for about 15 min to enable a full crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 film.
To complete the solar cell fabrication, a 100 nm hole transporting layer was coated on CH3NH3PbI3 film by spin-coating 100 μL premixed precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The solution contains 72.5 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 28 μL 4-tertbutylpyridine, 17.5 μL Li-TFSI in acetonitrile, 75 μL Co(III) complex FK209/acetonitrile solution (7.5 mM), and 1 mL chlorobenzene. After being stored in a humidity-controlled dark environment for 10 h, an Ag counter electrode with a thickness of about 100 nm and a specific area of 0.28 cm2 was finally coated on a hole transporting layer via vacuum thermal evaporation.
Characterization
The cells were without any encapsulation, and all the measurements of PV features were conducted at room temperature under ambient conditions. The J–V curves were tested by use of a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard AM 1.5 G simulated illumination (100 mW cm−2, XES-70S1). A shadow mask with a specific hole area of 0.09 cm2 was adopted to define the active area of the cell. EQE curves were measured by means of a commercialized quantum efficiency measurement system (SCS10-X150, Zolix Instrument Co. Ltd). The EQE data were collected under DC mode without any bias light. The stabilized power output of the cell was tested by applying a constant voltage, which refers to its maximum power point in the J–V curve. A standard Newport silicon solar cell was adopted to calibrate all the illumination systems.
XPS measurements were taken on a photoelectron spectrometer (PHI-5702) using Al Kα monochromatic radiation. To investigate the bulk elemental composition of Ti-Fe2O3 ETLs, the samples were etched by argon ions (2 keV, ∼50 μA cm−2) for 60 s at a chamber vacuum of 5 × 10−3 Pa. The data were calibrated with the binding energy of a C 1s peak at 284.6 eV to relieve any charging effects. M–S measurements were performed in 1.0 M NaOH on an electrochemical analyzer (Princeton Applied Research, 2273) at a frequency of 1000 Hz under dark conditions, using a 10 mV amplitude sinusoidal perturbation. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw RM-1000 laser Raman microscopy system. Absorption properties of the samples were studied using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. SEM images were taken on a Zeiss Supra-40 Field-Emission SEM. AFM images were obtained by means of a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM. XRD patterns were measured using a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer system. The patterns were collected in the range of 10–60° with a scan speed of 10° min−1. PL spectra were tested on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer) at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 515 nm. TRPL curves were recorded using a time-correlated single-photon counting technique (Picoharp 300) under a 505 nm laser beam pulse with a frequency of 5 MHz.
