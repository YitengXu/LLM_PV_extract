    , Accepted 6th April 2018First published on 10th April 2018AbstractWe used several polymers as the ternary components to demonstrate a ternary strategy to improve the performance of PCDTBT:PC71BM devices under 1 sun and indoor illumination. With a binary bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) of PCDTBT:PC71BM organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.5% under indoor light sources (300 lux from fluorescence tube) was achieved. However, with a ternary BHJ cell of PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM, the PCE can be enhanced to 20.8%. FFs are the primarily improved in these devices. Transport and absorption measurements indicate the origins of the improvements of OPV performance: the ternary BHJ films exhibit enhanced hole mobilities and reduced Urbach energies, indicating that the blending of the PDTSTPD component passivates shallow traps near the band edges of the BHJ films.
Introduction
The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) transforms the ways we work and live. It is estimated that more than 50 billion internet-enabled objects, such as cellphones, wearable devices and sensors will be connected into the IoT network by the year 2020.1 Such huge amounts of separate and off-grid gadgets presumably require light-weight portable batteries, and how these batteries can be charged in time conveniently presents a big challenge. Currently, several candidates with power in the range of 1–100 μW are under consideration and they mainly involve the use of piezoelectricity and vibrational energy.2–4 As IoTs are usually operated indoor, few researchers pay attention to photovoltaic (PV) devices because they are developed for outdoor applications.5–10 So IoTs and PV cells should not be related to each other.
The rise of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, however, is altering the relationship between IoTs and PV cells. Organic materials possess strong absorbance in the visible light region (∼390–760 nm)11–14 and hence, OPV cells are better light harvesters than silicon-based PV devices under room lighting illumination. This realization spearheads the emergent study of OPV devices under different illumination conditions.15–18 As reported by Cutting et al., the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) (under 1-sun) of P3HT:PCBM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) cells were around 2.93% and 8.65% and surged up to around 12.83% and 20.19%, respectively, under the LED illumination.19 As a comparison, the c-Si-based PV device achieves a PCE of 16.72% under the 1 sun illumination, and only increases moderately to 20.19% under white LED illumination. PCDTBT, a well-known donor polymer used in OPV, has been the focus of attention lately because its OPV cells possess relatively high Voc (∼0.9 V).20,21 It has been observed that PV devices generally suffer from a loss in Voc of about 0.2 V under room lighting conditions. Therefore, PV devices with higher Voc such as PCDTBT will be able to retain a large fraction of its Voc under room lighting illumination. Using this concept, Lee et al. compared the performances of PTB7:PC71BM, and PCDTBT:PC71BM OPV devices under various types of illumination.22 Under 1 sun illumination, their PTB7:PC71BM device achieved a higher PCE of 6.8%. However, under 300 lux of fluorescent light (FL) illumination, the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell achieved a higher PCE of 16.6%. This observation clearly shows the potential of PCDTBT-based OPV devices under indoor lighting illumination.
One problem related to the BHJ of PCDTBT:PC71BM is its relatively poor hole transport, which impacts negatively on the device fill-factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc). To overcome this problem, a ternary BHJ cell can be considered. Specific functionalities of ternary components can improve the performance of OPV cells: (i) enhanced carrier mobilities improve FFs;23,24 (ii) complementary optical absorptions increase Jscs;25,26 and (iii) matched energy levels enlarge Vocs.27,28 In this study, we adopt a ternary strategy and improve the performance of PCDTBT-based OPV devices. PCDTBT was chosen as the host polymer because it has a large Voc of 0.9 V under 1 sun illumination. Despite this advantage, PCDTBT:PC71BM has inferior hole mobilities in the range of ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Thus if a ternary polymer with a high hole mobility is introduced, it is anticipated that the PCE of the resultant ternary cells would be improved. Following this idea, five well-studied polymers, namely, PTB7, PTB7-Th, P3HT, PBDB-T, and PDTSTPD, were chosen as the ternary candidates. The BHJ cells have a general composition of donor-1 (host):donor-2 (ternary polymer):PC71BM with weight ratio of 0.9:0.1:2. The overall donor:acceptor weight ratio was fixed at 1:2. Among all cells, the PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM cell achieves the highest PCE of 19.8% under 300 lux illumination from the 2700 K FL tube. By solvent vapor annealing (SVA), the PCE can be further enhanced to 20.8%. To investigate the origins of the improved OPV performances, we used admittance spectroscopy (AS) to measure the field dependent hole mobilities of the optimized ternary and binary BHJ films. We found that the ternary BHJ improved hole transports. In addition, photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) was performed to measure the subgap optical absorptions of the BHJ films. It was found that the ternary BHJ has a sharpened band edge, implying the passivation of shallow traps near the band edge in ternary BHJs.
Experimental
The OPV device structure is denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/LiF/Al. The indium tin oxide (ITO)-patterned glass substrates were ultrasonicated subsequently in deionized water, acetone, and 1,2-propanol, and then dried in ambient air overnight. After a 13 min UV-ozone treatment, a PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on the cleaned substrate at 7000 rpm for 60 s, which was further annealed at 140 °C on a hotplate for 10 min. The resultant PEDOT:PSS layer had a thickness of 30 nm. The substrates were then transferred into a N2 filled glove box to spin-coat the active layers. Polymers for BHJ cells fabrication were obtained from 1-materials and PC71BM was obtained from nano-C and mixed in the appropriate ratios. For the binary BHJ, the donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio was fixed as 1:2 and for ternary systems, the PCDTBT:polymer:PC71BM weight ratio was 0.9:0.1:2. The overall donor concentration was 7 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene (CB), and the spin speed was 1600 rpm for 60 s, to form ∼85 nm uniform active layers. The ternary polymers were PTB7, PTB7-Th, P3HT, PBDB-T, and PDTSTPD. Finally, a thin LiF layer (∼1 nm) and Al cathode (∼130 nm) were evaporated in a high vacuum chamber (∼4 × 10−6 torr).
Performance under 1-sun

Fig. 1 summarizes the chemical structures and HOMO/LUMO levels of the host polymer PCDTBT, the acceptor PC71BM, and the ternary polymers. PCDTBT and PDTSTPD have relatively low lying HOMO levels (−5.50 eV and −5.60 eV, respectively), which are more favorable to fabricate large-Voc OPV devices. Fig. 2 displays the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the binary PCDTBT:PC71BM, and ternary PCDTBT:polymer:PC71BM devices under 100 mW cm−2 of AM 1.5G solar illumination. The binary control device achieves an overall PCE of 5.3%, with a Jsc of 10.8 mA cm−2, FF of 56.0%, and Voc of 0.87 V. The PCDTBT:PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PCDTBT:PTB7:PC71BM ternary cells exhibit enhanced Jsc in excess of 11.2 mA cm−2. However, Voc of these two ternary devices drop to 0.85 V and 0.82 V, respectively. Among these polymers, PDTSTPD is a promising ternary candidate because it has a chemical structure similar to PCDTBT, a relatively higher hole mobility, a low lying HOMO level, and stronger optical absorptions in the near infrared region.29,30 The PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM cell achieves an optimized overall PCE of 6.0%, Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2, FF of 60.2%, and Voc of 0.89 V. The PCE of the ternary cell with PDTSTPD can be further enhanced to 6.3% (Jsc of 11.0 mA cm−2, FF of 63.1%, and Voc of 0.90 V) by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 30 s (Fig. S1†). The origin of PCE enhancement from SVA is not clear. However, it is likely to originate from the improvement of morphology, as reported in similar studies.31,32Table 1 summarizes the OPV parameters of the binary and ternary OPV devices with various ternary compounds.

Performance under indoor illumination
We further examined PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM ternary devices under indoor light conditions. The following commercially available T5 tubes were used to simulate the indoor lights: LED (model PAK410080) with color temperatures of 3000 K, 4000 K, and 6500 K and FL (model PAK300408) with color temperature of 2700 K, 4000 K, and 6500 K. The emission spectra S(λ) of the tubes were acquired; Fig. 3(a) depicts the LED emission spectra normalized by its total emission intensity ( in eqn (2)), so that the area under each curve in the figure is 1. The spectra for all light sources are shown in the ESI Fig. S2.† The FL spectrum originates from fluorescence of phosphors and emission from excited Hg vapor inside the lamp, producing characteristic peaks of narrow bands, while LED spectrum is produced from emission of a combination of a GaN blue LED and fluorescence of phosphor materials, giving a broad bands with a peak in the blue color region.33,34 Stronger optical emission is observed in the near ultraviolet region (450–460 nm) for high color temperature tubes and in the near infrared region for lower color temperature tubes. An illuminance of 300 lux is a widely recognized indoor standard used in the lighting industry.19,21 Therefore, the distance between devices and light tubes were adjusted in our experiments such that the total illuminance was fixed at 300 lux (measuring with the Lutron LX-102 photometer). The input power intensities of various light sources were then calculated based on the illuminance. For a monochromatic light source, the relationship between the illuminance L and the power intensity I can be expressed as14 L(λ) = KrIV(λ)(1)where Kr is a constant scaling factor of 683 lm W−1 (the maximum spectral luminous efficacy for human photopic vision), and V(λ) [Fig. 3(b)] is the CIE 1988 2° spectral luminous efficiency function for human photopic vision deduced to be adopted by the photometer.35 Due to the spectral sensitivity of human eyes, the effective brightness, namely, illuminance needs to be weighed by V(λ), which accounts for the visual sensitivity. For heterochromatic light sources, the total illuminance L involves the integral of the emission spectrum of photopic vision, S(λ) × V(λ), over the visible region, i.e. (2)

The thicknesses of films are about 85 nm, which is the thickness of the optimized BHJ devices. 

Fig. 3(c) shows the distribution of normalized S(λ) × V(λ), which is essentially the integral of product in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The input power intensity can be calculated by eqn (2). The last column of Table 2 lists the calculated input powers (Pin) arising from different light sources. Different emission spectra possess different overlapping with V(λ) and hence the integral value; thus, under the fixed 300 lux illumination, the input power intensity is the smallest for the spectrum with the best overlapping. Nonetheless, the computed Pin's are similar for all light sources used herein ranging from 74 to 80 μW cm−2. The results are also comparable to those reported elsewhere under the same illuminance of 300 lux.17,22

Fig. 4 shows the JV characteristics of the binary PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM OPV devices under different indoor illuminations with a fixed illuminance of 300 lux: (a, b) FL sources; (c, d) LED sources. The ternary cells consistently exhibit enhanced OPV parameters in all cases. Under illumination from a 2700 K FL tube, the highest PCE of 19.8% is achieved for the ternary cell. The OPV performance of binary PCDTBT:PC71BM cells is similar to those recently reported by Lee et al.22 For the ternary cells, the Jsc improvement is mainly contributed by the enhanced optical absorption in the near infrared region. Fig. 3(d) displays the normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of the binary and ternary BHJ films and their pure compound layers. There is a small, but distinct absorption peak between 650–700 nm for the ternary film, which matches the absorption peak of PDTSTPD. The performance of ternary cells can be further improved by SVA for 30 s after the spin coating of BHJ films. Under a 2700 K FL tube, the ternary cell with SVA achieves an optimized PCE of 20.8%, with the Voc of 0.73 V, FF of 63.5%, and Jsc of 33.3 μA cm−2. However, when OPV devices are illuminated by other indoor light sources with higher color temperatures, the Jsc differences between binary and ternary cells become smaller because of the mismatches of the emission and absorption spectra. For example, when the devices are illuminated under a 6500 K LED tube, both the binary and ternary cells show reduced Jsc and overall PCEs. Jsc of the ternary and binary cells decrease significantly to 29.0 μA cm−2 and 28.3 μA cm−2, resulting in PCEs of 16.1% and 13.9%, respectively. The OPV parameters of the binary PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM BHJ solar cells are summarized in Table 2. Improvements in FF and Voc in ternary cells can be observed under various light sources. However, PCDTBT-based solar cells achieve higher Jsc under neutral (4000 K) and warm (2700 K & 3000 K) light sources, than cool (6500 K) FL and LED tubes. Fig. 5 summarizes the PCEs and output powers of binary PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM cells with or without SVA under different indoor light sources.

Discussions
(A) How to choose PV materials for room lights
Below, we briefly discuss why a large Voc is essential for making BHJ cells for room light harvesting. The Voc loss under room lights can be rationalized by dependence of Voc on the light dependent photocurrent Iph: (3)where n is the ideality factor of the diode, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the cell temperature, q is the electron charge, and I0 is the dark current.22 Two observations can be deduced from eqn (3). First, under a fixed illumination, material with small dark current should give rise to a large Voc. Thus, an OPV polymer with large energy gap should give a large Voc. Second, the reduction of Voc (ΔV) under room lights can be expressed as (4)where Iph,sun and Iph,room are the photocurrents under 1 sun and room light illumination, respectively. It should be noted that ΔV is clearly independent of I0. Furthermore, for most OPV materials, Iph increases with the incident photon flux. In particular, Iph ∼ P′α where P′ is the incident power intensity contributed by the range of wavelength giving rise to photovoltaic effect and α is a constant ranging from 0.75 in the case of space-charge limited photocurrent to unity for the space-charge-free limit.36 Herein, we chose the space-charge free limit (α ≈ 1) due to the absence of charge injection. The solar spectrum consists of a wide range of infrared light, which contributes slightly to the PV performance, while LED and FL spectra mostly cover only the visible region, which corresponds to the PV performance. We therefore write P′sun = Psunθ, where Psun ≈ 100 mW cm−2 is the nominal incident power intensity of 1 sun illumination and θ is its fraction of light without infrared radiation (<780 nm, defined by the range of V(λ) corresponding to photopic vision). Then, eqn (4) can be written as (5)and the Voc of room light illumination can be expressed as (6)
By investigating the area under the solar spectrum, 56.65% of the solar power comes from wavelength less than 780 nm. Using Proom ≈ 80 μW cm−2 (∼300 lux) in our experiment and assuming n ≈ 1, we get a computed Voc loss ΔV ≈ 0.166 V, which is almost the same loss as the experimental value (Table 2). It can be seen from eqn (5) that ΔV should be independent of the choice of materials. We therefore conclude that to achieve a large Voc at ambient light illumination, a BHJ that gives a large Voc under 1 sun illumination is essential.
Recently, two papers reported high-Voc OPV devices used in room light illuminations. Lee et al. fabricated BTR:PC71BM BHJ cells (Voc of 0.945 V under standard 1 sun) and achieved an overall PCE of 28.1% under 1000 lux fluorescent lamps. Notably, under the indoor light, Voc of the BTR:PC71BM device is 0.791 V, which is the highest value among OPV cells used as indoor light harvesters.37 Yang et al. used P3HT as the donor, and compared the performance of P3HT-based devices with different acceptors in various illuminations.38 Under 1 sun illumination, the P3HT:ICBA and P3HT:PCBM cells have Vocs of 0.89 V and 0.59 V, respectively. Therefore, under indoor illumination (500 lux from FL and LED), the P3HT:ICBA device achieves a leading Voc of 0.73 V, while Voc of the P3HT:PCBM cell decreases to only 0.43 V.
(B) How does the ternary PDTSTPD enhances PCEs under room lights
With a large Voc, the next step is to improve the FF. Our ternary approach addresses how the ternary polymer enhances the FF by improving the electronic properties of the BHJs.

Electronic characterization. 
Admittance spectroscopy (AS) was performed to investigate the origins of the FF enhancements in ternary devices. The principle of AS has been documented elsewhere.39–41 The hole mobilities of the binary PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM BHJ films were examined by AS. The hole-only device structure is denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/CuPc:Spiro-TPD/Au. Fig. 6(a) shows the electric field dependent hole mobilities of binary and ternary BHJ films from AS measurements at room temperature. The hole mobilities can be described by the Poole–Frenkel model, which is expressed as μ(F) = μ0exp(βF1/2)(7)where μ0 is the zero-field hole mobility, β is the Poole–Frenkel slope, and F is the applied electric field.42 The parameters μ0 and β were extracted to compare the hole transport properties. For the ternary BHJ film, μ0 ≈ 1.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about half order larger than 4.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the binary film. Moreover, the ternary film achieves smaller Poole–Frenkel slope β of 1.05 × 10−3 (cm ΔV)1/2 than 1.81 × 10−3 (cm ΔV)1/2 of the binary film. A smaller β improves hole mobilities in the low field region, and enhances the charge balance near the Voc condition.43 Therefore, the PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM ternary OPV devices achieve enhanced FFs than the binary control cells under 1 sun and indoor light illuminations.
 Fig. 6  (a) Hole mobilities of binary PCDTBT:PC71BM and ternary PCDTBT:PDTSTPD:PC71BM BHJ films as a function of electric field; (b) subgap optical absorption spectra extracted from PDS for binary and ternary BHJ films with different weight fractions of PDTSTPD. 
Photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) was performed to investigate the subgap bandedge absorption of the BHJ films. A sharper bandedge, associated with a more abrupt drop in the absorption just below the bandgap energy, is an indication of reduced disorder.44 For organic amorphous semiconductors, the mean optical absorption coefficient α of the bandedge can be expressed as (8)where α0 is the optical absorption coefficient at the bandedge, hν is the photon energy, and Eu is the Urbach energy. Eu can be used to describe the width of the localized band tail states.45 A small Eu indicates faster drop in the optical absorption just below the bandgap energy Eg, a narrower band tail, and reduced shallow traps. Fig. 6(b) shows the subgap optical absorption spectra of PCDTBT-based binary and ternary BHJ films from PDS measurements. The reduction of Eu can be clearly observed in the ternary films. Eu is 53.4 meV for the PCDTBT:PC71BM binary film, and decreases to 43.1 meV in the ternary film with 10% ternary PDTSTPD in weight. Correspondingly, the optimized ternary solar cell (10% PDTSTPD) achieves an enhanced FF of 60.2% than 56.0% of the binary control device. However, although Eu is further decreased to 39.6 meV in the ternary film with 20% PDTSTPD in weight, the FF and PCE decrease to 55.7% and 5.6%, respectively, because of the excessive subgap traps shown in Fig. 6(b). AS and PDS results indicate that PDTSTPD molecules behave as conducting linkers for PCDTBT molecules. Shallow defects near the bandedge are passivated and energetic disorders of hole transport are reduced in the ternary BHJ films, resulting in suppressed PF effects of hole transport and improved hole mobilities.

Conclusions
We propose a ternary strategy to improve the OPV performance of PCDTBT:PC71BM devices under 1 sun and indoor illumination. A low HOMO (−5.6 eV) polymer PDTSTPD was selected as the ternary compound with the D1:D2:A weight ratio of 0.9:0.1:2. Under the 1 sun illumination, the ternary device achieves an enhanced PCE of 6.0%, rather than 5.3% of the binary device. The ternary cells also exhibit improved OPV performances under different indoor light sources (300 lux). A high PCE of 20.8% was achieved under 300 lux of illumination from a 2700 K FL tube. FFs are primarily improved in these devices. Moreover, ternary cells tend to have higher Jsc under indoor tubes with lower color temperatures due to better spectral overlap of the emission spectra of light sources, and the absorption spectra of ternary BHJ films. Transport and absorption measurements are performed to reveal the origins of the improvements of OPV performances in ternary devices. With the ternary polymer PDTSTPD, the BHJ films exhibit enhanced hole mobilities and smaller Poole–Frenkel slopes (β). Moreover, the sharpening of the bandgap (reduced Eu) can be clearly observed in the ternary films, indicating that the blending of PDTSTPD passivates the shallow traps near the bandedge of the PCDTBT:PC71BM BHJ films. The present study suggests that some polymers that have been abandoned because of large bandgaps and “poor” hole transporting capability should be re-considered for investigation under different illuminations. PCDTBT fits into this category as this polymer shows much better spectral overlap under room light illumination and its hole transport can be significantly enhanced using a ternary polymer. Its BHJ solar cells clearly outperform the conventional high performance polymer. We believe that PCDTBT is not the lone outlier and more polymers with similar potential can be identified in the future.
