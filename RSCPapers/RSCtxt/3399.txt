1. Introduction
In recent years, transition metal chalcogenides have caught much research attention owing to their unique physicochemical characteristics, low cost, and broad application potential.1–7 Among them, ternary sulfides have drawn rather extensive interest in the field of energy conversion and storage (e.g., solar cells, water splitting, hydrogen generation, supercapacitors, Li/Na-ion (Li–S, Li–O2, and Zn–air) batteries, etc.) because of their outstanding electrochemical performance.8,9 In particular, nickel cobalt sulfides (NCSs) have become one of the most concerned ternary sulfides, mainly due to their relatively high electrical conductivity, multiple valence states and rich crystallographic structures.10,11 It is generally considered that nickel holds tetrahedral sites, while cobalt takes over both octahedral and tetrahedral sites within spinel NiCo2S4 (Fig. 1). The mixture of heterogeneous spin states from Ni and Co atoms will result in lattice distortion and subtle atomic arrangement due to the mismatch in the Jahn–Teller distortion degree (Co2+, t2g6eg1, strong John–Teller effect; Ni2+, t2g6eg2, no John–Teller effect), which would produce more exposed active octahedral edge sites of NCSs.12 This is beneficial for more electrochemical reactions (e.g., pseudocapacitor or catalysis) and thus the synergistic effect between Ni and Co can effectively boost the electrochemical performance of NCSs with the coexistence of Ni2+, Ni3+, Co2+, and Co3+ ions. Compared to nickel cobalt oxides (Fig. 1), NCSs present relatively lower optical energy band gaps (NiCo2S4: 1.2 eV vs. NiCo2O4: 2.5 eV) and higher conductivity (∼100 times).13,14 This enables the lowering of the charge-transfer resistance of NCSs and facilitates charge transport when they are applied in energy conversion and storage systems. Theoretical calculation results indicate that NiCo2S4 has a smaller band gap than NiCo2O4 (Fig. 1d and e), suggesting its higher electric conductivity. And NiCo2S4 possesses a lower diffusion energy than NiCo2O4 (Fig. 1c), revealing that ions can more easily diffused in NiCo2S4.15 The replacement of oxygen by sulfur for NCSs will create more flexible structures since the electronegativity of sulfur is lower than that of oxygen.16 This can alleviate the structural deformation originating from the intercalation of electrolyte ions and thus promote the reactions between electrolyte ions and NCSs, yielding much enhanced electrochemical performance.

In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the development of NCSs, which can be roughly divided into several aspects.
The first is the design of micro-/nano-structures (Fig. 2 and 3). In addition to conventional nanostructures (e.g., zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticles,17 one-dimensional (1D) nanowires/nanorods/nanotubes,18,19 and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets20), some special morphologies as well have been designed, such as nanotube-woven hexagonal microsheets,21 nanosheet-constructed hollow nanocages,22 nanoparticle-stacked microspheres,23 hexagonal nanoplate-assembled microstructures,24 and so on. Such hierarchical structures are beneficial to further amplify the active reaction sites, facilitate the charge transport and promote the ion diffusion, ultimately strengthening the performance of NCSs.25–28 Although the hydrothermal/solvothermal method is still the most common way to synthesize the nanostructures of NCS materials,29 multi-step strategies combining different processes (e.g., solution reactions (hydrothermal/solvothermal, sol–gel and chemical bath reactions), electrodeposition and high-temperature calcination) are becoming more and more popular to construct high-performance morphologies of NCSs.30,31 More impressively, in situ growth of NCS nanostructured films directly onto conductive substrates (e.g., carbon cloth and Ni foam; Fig. 2 and 3d–f) is also well accepted mainly because it enables the simplification of the synthesis processes, removal of the use of binders, avoidance of the aggregation of nanomaterials, and reduction of the interfacial resistance between NCS films and substrates, therefore improving the performance of NCSs.19,32

Reproduced from ref. 19 and 22 with permission from American Chemical Society. 
The second is the study of the stoichiometric effect. For ternary or quaternary semiconductors, the stoichiometric ratio of their elements is usually adjustable, which also plays an important role in their properties and device performance.33,34 A variety of studies have been performed to investigate this stoichiometric effect on NCSs, and various NCSs with different element stoichiometry have been prepared, such as NiCo2S4,19,35 CoNi2S4,36,37 Ni1.4Co1.6S4,38 Ni1.5Co1.5S4,39 (Co0.5Ni0.5)9S8,40 (Ni0.33Co0.67)9S8,41 Ni1.77Co1.23S4,42 Ni4.5Co4.5S8,43 Ni0.67Co0.33S,44etc. The comparison of the relative performance of NCSs with different element stoichiometry has also been discussed in depth (Fig. 4).45 It is proposed that the high conductivity of NCSs is mainly due to the occupation of Ni in the tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure, the low bandgap and the synergistic coupling effect between Co and Ni with p-type (Co) and n-type (Ni) doping.46 Then, the different ratios of Ni/Co contents in NCSs will influence their performance in applications. For example, three NCSs with varied Ni/Co ratios (Ni0.8Co2.2S4, Ni1.5Co1.5S4, and Ni2.2Co0.8S4) were synthesized to study the composition effect on their electrocatalytic activity.47 It was found that Ni2.2Co0.8S4 had the highest current density and the lowest overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its largest content of Ni3+ with the conversion of Ni3+ to Ni4+ for producing more active sites to adsorb –OOH, while Ni1.5Co1.5S4 exhibited the highest current density for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to the larger content of Ni2+ and Co2+ with superior conductivity and the synergetic coupling between Ni and Co.47

The third is the fabrication of composites. NCS-based composites also have been widely fabricated to compensate for the shortcomings of NCSs (e.g., relatively low stability and slow mass transfer/reaction kinetics). NCSs can be rationally integrated with lots of other materials, for example, metal oxides (e.g., CeO2,54 CoMoO4,55 NiCo2O4,43 Co3O4,56etc.), sulfides (e.g., FeCo2S4,57 Co9S8,58 MgS,59 MoS2,60 SnS2,61etc.), selenides (e.g., Co0.85Se,62 MoSe2,63etc.), phosphides (e.g., NiCoP,64 NiFeP,65etc.), carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs),66 graphene,67–69 carbon dots,70 mesoporous carbon spheres,71etc.), polymers (e.g., polypyrrole,72 polyanilnie,73etc.), layered double hydroxides (LDHs; NiMn-LDHs,74 CoNo-LDHs,75 NiFe-LDHs,76etc.), two-dimensional titanium carbide (MXene),77 and others (e.g., g-C3N4,78 Ag,44etc.). Besides, element doping (e.g., Mn,79 and Cu80) also have been widely used to further enhance the performance of NCSs.
The fourth is the development of applications (Fig. 2). NCSs are one type of the most popular electrode material used in supercapacitors due to their excellent electrochemical activity.53,81 Besides, NCSs have been gradually applied to other electrochemical energy storage systems over the years, mainly including Li/Na-ion batteries,18,82 Li–O2 batteries,83 Zn–air batteries,69 and Li–S batteries.35 NCSs are also able to act as effective counter electrodes in dye/quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (DSCs/QDSCs).84,85 NCSs as well have great activity in photocatalytic reactions, such as the degradation of organic pollution and hydrogen evolution.86,87 Moreover, NCSs can be efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting with bi-functions of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).88,89 Particularly, NCSs can be used as bio-sensing materials due to their attractive electrochemical characteristics90 and microwave absorbers because of their excellent magnetic loss properties.91
For NCSs, some articles have reviewed their applications in supercapacitors and batteries.1,10,11 However, few reviews comprehensively summarize promising applications for NCSs in different fields. In this review, we focus on the recent applications of NSCs in a variety of fields in the last few years. We discuss some representative studies about the applications of NCSs in energy storage devices, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors and microwave absorption. We highlight the intercommunity of NCSs in different application fields. Finally, the general problems and future prospects of NCSs for various applications are analyzed and emphasized.
2. Applications of NCSs in energy storage devices
2.1. Supercapacitors
NCSs have been intensively applied in supercapacitors due to their relatively higher conductivity and more redox sites in comparison with their corresponding oxides and binary sulfides. It is commonly considered that the pseudocapacitive performance of NCSs is mainly due to the Faraday redox reactions between Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+. In an alkaline aqueous electrolyte, the reversible Faraday peaks can be associated with the reversible redox reactions from NiCo2S4 to NiSOH, CoSOH and CoSO species (Fig. 5). The theoretical capacitance of NiCo2S4 in supercapacitors is 2534 F g−1.1
 Fig. 5  Schematic diagram and reactions of NCSs in supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. 
In order to amplify the charge storage ability of NCSs, a series of strategies have been developed (Table 1), including regulating the element ratio (e.g., NiCo2S4,19,35 CoNi2S436,37 and NiCo2S4−x19), tuning the morphological structures in different dimensions (Fig. 6a and b),45,92–94 doping other elements (e.g., Fe,95 Mn,96 P,29 and V;97Fig. 6d–f), and integrating with other materials (e.g., CNTs,98 graphene,63 Nb2O5,99 Ni(OH)2,100 FeCo2S4,57 MXenes,77etc.). For example, the defect engineering strategy enables the production of rich sulfur vacancies on the surface of NCS crystals through various methods, such as low-temperature plasma induction (Fig. 4h–j),20 Ar/H2 gas-assisted annealing,23 and NaBH4 solution reduction.30 The existence of sulfur vacancies will change the electronic structures of NCSs to increase their conductivity and reactive sites for enhanced electrochemical performance.20 Besides, the 3D hierarchical structures of NCSs (Fig. 6) have been widely designed and fabricated for high-performance supercapacitors,93,101–103 mainly because they have attractive properties to offer sufficient surface areas for more faradaic redox reactions, and build fast channels for effective charge transfer and ion diffusion.

It is worth noting that NCSs frequently show obvious battery-like charge storage behavior, that is, displaying typical redox peaks in cyclic voltammogram curves (CVs; vs. near-rectangular shapes or broadened peaks for capacitors; Fig. 6c) and clear discharge platforms in galvanostatic charge/discharge curves (GCDs; vs. quasi-triangular shapes for capacitors; Fig. 6e).105 It means that the reaction kinetics of NCSs in the charge storage processes are partially determined by the diffusion-controlled redox behavior (i.e., , where I is the current and v is the scan rate in CVs), while the reaction kinetics of pseudocapacitance are dominated by the surface-controlled faradaic process (i.e., I ∝ v).58 Thus, the corresponding devices based on battery-like NCS electrodes are named hybrid supercapacitors due to the capacity contribution both from the diffusion-controlled and surface redox processes (Fig. 6f).44,81,106–109 However, we find that the contribution ratio of these two kinds of electrochemical behavior for NCSs is significantly influenced by the micro-/nano-structures of NCSs. The electrochemical performance of four types of NiCo2S4 hierarchical structures assembled from similar nanorod building blocks was investigated,110 and it was indicated that the hat/flower-like structures with a compact packaging way showed unclear CV redox peaks and GCD discharge platforms, suggesting that the diffusion-controlled process was limited and the capacity was mainly from the surface electrochemical process. In contrast, sphere/brush-like structures with a loose and orderly assembly way presented more obvious CV redox peaks and GCD discharge platforms, revealing a higher utilization of active materials from the increased contribution of diffusion-controlled faradaic reactions in the inner part of the electrode, and thus they had larger capacity.110 Moreover, NCSs and their composites are commonly in situ grown on planar substrates (e.g., carbon cloth, Ni foam and metal meshes), and they usually show clear battery-like behavior,58,81 but when the planar substrates are changed into ultrathin metal wires with a diameter on a scale of tens of micrometers and a high aspect ratio (Fig. 7a–d), clear CV redox peaks and GCD discharge platforms disappear (Fig. 7e and f), and most capacity is from the surface pseudocapacitance because of the relatively large surface area of ultrathin wires (Fig. 7g and h).59 Therefore, it is possible to modify NCS electrodes on different aspects (e.g., components, morphologies, substrates and so on) to achieve high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

2.2. Batteries
In recent years, NCSs have also been employed as effective electrode materials in other electrochemical energy storage devices (Table 2), such as Li/Na/Zn-ion, Li–S, Li–O2 and Zn–air batteries, similarly because of their intrinsic properties of high electrochemical activity stemming from their rich redox reactions with multi-valence states and relatively high electrical conductivity with the synergetic effect from Ni and Co atoms (Fig. 5). The theoretical capacity of NCSs in Li-ion batteries is 703 mA h g−1.1 For example, NiCo2S4 hollow nanowires (Fig. 8a) were uniformly grown on a 3D N-doped carbon nanosheet substrate derived from a bio-polymer of Chitin (poly(b-(1,4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine)),18 which exhibited attractive long-term cycling stability with a revisable capacity of 1198 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 500 cycles (Fig. 8b). Besides, (Co0.5Ni0.5)9S8 hollow microspheres (Fig. 8c) were converted from the Ni–Co metal–organic framework (Ni–Co-MOF) and then modified with N-doped carbon (N–C).40 When applied as the anode in Na-ion batteries with Na3V2(PO4)3@C as the cathode, the full cells delivered a capacity of 737.6 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 within 0.01–3.7 V after 50 cycles. It was found that the composite electrodes had a hybrid electrochemical charge storage behavior and the pseudocapacitive contribution was up to 88.8% at 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 8d). In addition, NiCo2S4 porous nanoneedle arrays were in situ grown on N/S co-doped carbon cloth and displayed high sulfur loading capability due to the rich mesoporous structure and a great ability to absorb and convert polysulfide intermediates owing to the high electronic conductivity and catalytic activity.117 Therefore, NCS-based materials are as well promising for Li–S batteries.

Recently, besides the ex situ measurement ways,118in situ characterization methods (e.g., in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) have been extensively developed to reveal more details about the charge storage processes for batteries. Thus, some studies have also reported the in situ characterization and analysis of the working mechanism of NCSs in Li/Na-ion batteries.41,66,119–122 For example, in situ XRD of the NiCo2S4@CNT electrodes in Li/Na-ion batteries showed that in the first discharge process with Li/Na ion intercalation, phase change occurred with the formation of Ni/Co particles, Li2S and Na2S, while in the charge process, NiS and CoS would generate due to the deintercalation of Li/Na ions (Fig. 9).66 In addition, the in situ EIS analysis of the interfacial properties and charge transfer resistance of NiCo2S4@carbon electrodes also confirmed the phase change with the conversion of NiCo2S4 into NiSx and CoSx after 200 cycles.120 The participation of carbon materials enabled the improvement of the electrical conductivity and ensured the high reversibility of structural and phase transition of NiCo2S4 during charge/discharge cycles, thus enhancing the stability of NCS-based batteries.66,120 Therefore, it will be very beneficial to deeply elucidate the working mechanism and key processes in electrochemical energy storage devices by combining in situ and ex situ characterization methods, ultimately guiding the design of more high-performance devices.

For the applications of Zn–air and Li–O2 batteries, the electrocatalytic activity and durability in the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) for the discharge process and the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) for the charge process are very essential for advanced cathode electrode materials. Many studies have confirmed that NCSs are feasible for metal–oxygen batteries as a class of bifunctional cathodes,69,78,123–125 still due to their excellent electrochemical activity and reversibility in redox reactions. For example, NiCo2S4 nanoparticles were integrated with carbon nitrogen nanosheets and demonstrated efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic performance (i.e., a positive half-wave potential of 0.83 V for the ORR and a low overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for the OER).78 The corresponding Zn–air batteries showed a maximum power density of 92 mW cm−2, a capacity of 801 mA h g−1, an energy density of 1025 W h kg−1, and outstanding cycling durability for 180 h with 1000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2, which were comparable or superior to those (106 mW cm−2, 759 mA h g−1, 925 W h kg−1, and 69 h) of the commercial Pt/C–RuO2-based one.
3. Applications of NCSs in water splitting
Nowadays, electrochemical water splitting is widely recognized as one of the most prospective strategies to generate hydrogen (Fig. 10a), which is mostly accepted as an ideal energy choice to substitute for conversional fossil fuels. There are two important processes involved in the electrocatalysis of water, that is, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which require highly active electrocatalysts to overcome the large overpotential (1.6–2.0 V) of these reactions. To date, IrO2 and Pt have been considered as the best catalysts for the OER and HER; nevertheless, the high price of noble metals restricts their large-scale applications. Thus, alternative electrocatalysts with low cost and high activity have attracted much attention. Because of the co-existence of Ni and Co with rich active sites from the redox couples (i.e., Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+) in crystal structures, NCSs show higher conductivity and catalytic capability than binary sulfides (Fig. 10b–d), and then have been applied in electrocatalytic water splitting as a promising type of bifunctional catalyst (Fig. 10a and Table 3).131–133

Much effort has been devoted to the rational engineering of the components and nanostructures of NCSs,88,89,131,132,134,135 in order to further enlarge their reactive surface areas, improve their electrical conductivity and enhance their catalytic stability, ultimately synergistically strengthening their electrocatalytic performance. For example, nanorod assembled NiCo2S4 microspheres were in situ planted onto N,S co-doped reduced graphene oxides,136 which exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic ability in the HER and OER with a low cell voltage of 1.58 V in 1 M KOH for overall water splitting. More impressively, they also had electrocatalytic capability in a neutral electrolyte (1 M phosphate buffer solution) with a cell voltage of 1.91 V, which is very meaningful to avoid the corrosion of devices from alkaline electrolytes and reduce the operating cost for practical applications. Besides, NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4 and NiCo2Se4 nanosheets were separately grown on conductive carbon papers to compare their behavior in electrocatalytic water splitting.137 For the HER at 10 mA cm−2 , the overpotential value for NiCo2Se4 (56 mV) was relatively lower than those of NiCo2S4 (87 mV) and NiCo2O4 (141 mV), but still slightly higher than that of Pt/C (41 mV). However, for the OER at 25 mA cm−2, NiCo2S4 possessed the lowest overpotential value of 251 mV as compared to other materials (i.e., NiCo2O4: 372 mV; NiCo2Se4: 321 mV; IrO2/C: 358 mV). Accordingly, NiCo2S4 and NiCo2Se4 were employed as the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, respectively, yielding a low cell voltage of 1.51 V for driving the generation of H2 and O2 bubbles at 10 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculation unraveled that the center position of the d band for electrodes was closely related to the electrocatalytic activity. It was found that NiCo2S4 and NiCo2Se4 had the d band center closer to the Fermi level, suggesting increased unoccupied orbitals due to the existence of S and Se, and the upward movement of the antibonding d state with strengthened adsorption interaction with reactive species (e.g., H2O and H*) for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.137

In addition, due to their excellent electrocatalytic activity, NCSs have also been proved to be effective electrocatalysts for the alkaline urea electrooxidation reaction in urea fuel cells, which are accepted as one promising strategy to use urea from wastewater to produce electricity and hydrogen.52,138–140 For example, NiCo2S4 nanowires were in situ grown on a carbon sponge, which showed great electrocatalytic performance with a large electrochemically active surface area of 330.7 cm−2 and a low activation energy of 15.3 kJ mol−1 towards the urea oxidation reaction.140 It is believed that the excellent electrocatalytic properties of NCSs will make them have good application prospects in other electrocatalysis fields.
4. Applications of NCSs in solar cells
NCSs are frequently used as counter electrode materials in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs).84,143–146 In DSCs and QDSCs, counter electrodes (CEs) play an important role in collecting electrons from the external circuit to electro-catalyze the reduction of the electrolyte and thus realize continuous photoelectric conversion. For DSCs, Pt is an ideal choice as the CE due to its excellent electrocatalytic ability for the reduction of iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolytes.145 However, the high cost of Pt inspires people to develop cheaper alternatives. For QDSCs, Pt is inefficient for the reduction of polysulfide redox electrolytes because of the strong adsorption of sulfur atoms onto the Pt surface to reduce its conductivity and reduction ability.143 Therefore, effective CE materials have been intensively developed, including carbon-based materials, metal sulfides and so on.
Among them, NCS-based materials are expected to be promising CE alternatives because they provide rich redox reactions and relatively high conductivity from the synergetic effect of Ni and Co atoms. For instance, NiCo2S4 quantum dots (QDs) were decorated onto the surface of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) as CEs for DSCs (Fig. 11a).147 It was found that such CEs showed comparable electrocatalytic performance to Pt (Fig. 11b and c; photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSCs: 7.65% for NiCo2S4@N-CNTs vs. 7.39% for Pt). This was mainly because of the uniform distribution of NiCo2S4 QDs on CNTs for abundant reaction sites, the special 1D channels of CNTs for rapid charge transport and ion diffusion, and the strong metal–nitrogen bonding between NiCo2S4 QDs and CNTs due to the nitrogen doping.

5. Applications of NCSs in photocatalysis
Recently, metal sulfides have been widely applied in photocatalysis,148–150 and NCSs are also introduced into the photocatalytic system mainly due to their great photoelectric conductivity and p-type semiconductor characteristics (Eg = ∼2.5 eV). For example, NCS@MXene composites were prepared as a photocatalyst and exhibited great photocatalytic activity and stability in the degradation of rhodamine B under visible light conditions.86 Besides, NiCo2S4/CdS (Fig. 12),87 NiCo2S4@Zn0.5Cd0.5S,151 and NiCo2S4/g-C3N4 (ref. 152) co-catalysts have been fabricated and proved to be efficient in visible-light-irradiation photocatalytic hydrogen generation because the participation of NCSs is able to significantly enhance the carrier separation and migration due to the heterojunction formation in the co-catalysts.

Moreover, NiCo2S4 micro-particles were synthesized via a solvothermal method and then applied as noble-metal-free catalysts in the CO2 photoreduction system.122 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is considered as a promising strategy to realize the direct conversion of solar energy into special chemicals (e.g., CO) with the advantages of using renewable solar energy and alleviating the climate change from CO2 emission. Here, the NiCo2S4 photocatalyst showed considerable activity for visible-light CO2 reduction, yielding a production rate of 43.5 μmol mg−1 h−1 for CO. In situ steady-state photoluminescence and transient photocurrent tests indicated that the NiCo2S4 catalyst enabled the reduction of the recombination and the acceleration of the transport of photo-generated charges during the CO2 reduction process.122
6. Applications of NCSs in sensors
The accurate detection of glucose concentration in various sources (e.g., human blood, foods and pharmaceuticals) is essential and necessary for personal healthcare, diagnosis and therapy of diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus), drug analysis, food monitoring and so on.153 It requires that glucose-monitoring devices should be efficient, reliable, low-cost, and simple. Enzyme-immobilized electrodes are widely used as glucose sensors due to their high sensitivity. However, such glucose sensors demand complex operating conditions for the attachment of enzymes onto the electrode surface, and the biomass enzymes are usually unstable under high temperature, humidity or acidity and alkalinity conditions.90
To address these problems, enzyme-free glucose sensors based on various inorganic materials (e.g., metal nanoparticles, metal oxides, sulfides, etc.) have been developed recently. NCSs and their composites with different structures (e.g., NiCo2S4 nanosheets/nanowires/hollow spheres,90,154,155 and NiS/CoS/NiCo2S4 micro-flowers156) are also considered as an optimal choice for non-enzymatic glucose sensors based on their good electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation. Moreover, they have several advantages, such as facile synthesis, high sensitivity, great stability and low cost. For example, flower-like NiCo2S4 structures constructed from many interlaced nanosheets were simply electrodeposited onto Ni-coated cellulose filter paper (Fig. 13a),153 which showed satisfactory sensing performance for glucose detection (Fig. 13b–e), including a wide linear range (0.5 μM to 6 mM; Fig. 13d) for the glucose content, considerable sensitivity (283 μA mM−1 cm−2), a low detection limit (50 nM), great selectivity (Fig. 13e), excellent repeatability and electrochemical stability.

Similarly, the excellent electrocatalytic capability of NCSs also endows them with great sensing performance for the detection of other substances (e.g., sulfadimethoxine (SDM)54 and pyrimethanil157). It was reported that a NiCo2S4@N/S-doped CeO2 composite was able to be an effective signal amplification label in a DNA aptasensor for detecting SDM, which is widely used for the veterinary treatment of coccidiosis and other bacterial infections but harmful to organisms even at a low concentration. This was because the composite had great electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction, and thus excellent electrocatalytic amplification for SDM detection with high sensitivity and selection.54 In addition, NCS-based materials (e.g., NiCo2S4/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets) also can act as gas sensors for ethanol monitoring by recording the resistance change of sensing materials. This is mainly due to the adsorption of O2 molecules on the electrode surface and the reaction between the ethanol molecules and the adsorbed O2 molecules will change the electrode resistance.158
7. Applications of NCSs in microwave absorption
With the improvement of science and technology, more and more electronic products come into our daily life, while the accompanying electromagnetic radiation and interference will affect the human health, influence the normal operation of electronic devices, and even threaten the national defense safety. Thus, a variety of microwave absorption materials have been extensively studied in order to effectively absorb and then transform electromagnetic microwaves into other types of energy (e.g., thermal energy; Fig. 14a).159 Ideal microwave absorbers should have a high absorption capacity, a wide absorption frequency range, low cost and light weight. Carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene and porous carbon materials) have been widely used to absorb microwaves primarily due to their tunable dielectric properties, large specific surface areas, light weight and high chemical stability.160
 Fig. 14  Proposed microwave absorption mechanism of NCS-based materials (a) and comparison of microwave absorption ability among different materials (b).163 Reproduced from ref. 121 with permission from Elsevier. 
Recently, NCSs have also been considered to be a potential microwave absorption material owing to their great magnetic loss performance.161,162 For example, NiCo2S4 nanosheets or microspheres were combined with carbon materials (e.g., biomass derived carbon mesoporous91,163 and hollow carbon microspheres164) to achieve excellent microwave absorption capability (Fig. 14b), such as a minimum reflection loss value of −64.74 dB and a wide absorption range from 9.22 to 14.48 GHz.163 It was found that the assistance of NiCo2S4 in the biomass-derived carbon composite was able to improve the impedance matching and the attenuation constant for strong microwave absorption.91 Therefore, it is promising to develop highly efficient and low-cost microwave absorbers based on NCS materials.
8. Conclusion and prospects
In summary, NCS-based materials have been extensively studied in recent years. They possess great performances in different applications due to their intrinsic characteristics of highly reactive activity from the multivalent states of crystals, and relatively high electronic conductivity from the cooperation of Ni and Co atoms. This review summarizes the recent development of NCSs on various aspects of micro/nano-structure design, element modulation and dopants, heterojunction building and composite integration. It emphasizes the applications of NCSs in several fields, including electrochemical energy storage devices (e.g., supercapacitors, Li/Na/Zn-ion batteries, and Li–S/Zn–air/Li–O2 batteries), water splitting, DSCs/QDSCs, photocatalysis, sensors and microwave absorption. It is indicated that these important applications are all mainly based on the attractive properties of NCSs, such as relatively high conductivity, rich active sites, and tunable components.
Although much progress has been achieved on the development of NCS-based materials for different devices, these materials are still unsatisfactory to meet the requirement for practical applications. For example, the specific capacity, energy density, and stability of the corresponding energy storage devices aren't quite high. Although the energy density of NCS-based supercapacitors is higher than that of the carbon-based ones, their power density and cycling stability are reduced concurrently. Compared to other typical batteries with high energy density, NCS-based batteries are still unsatisfactory. Besides, the high self-discharge rate (10–40%/day) of NCS-based supercapacitors should be addressed for their practical applications. Similarly, the catalytic activity and cycling stability of NCSs for the applications of electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and sensing devices also need further enhancement. In addition, the manufacturing cost, environmental compatibility, and industrial-scale preparation should be especially concerned in future. Moreover, the relationship between the microscopic characteristics of NCS materials and the macroscopic performance should be understood more for the further rational design of NCS materials.
For the performance improvement, the exploitation and construction of highly effective NCS materials concerning various aspects (e.g., modulation of the element ratio, formation of efficient nanostructures, and integration of other components) are definitely required to expose abundant active surface sites, strength electronic conductivity, build fast channels for charge transfer and mass diffusion, and enhance the cycling durability of NCS-based systems. Besides, deep understand of the material behavior and working mechanisms of NCSs in different application systems is very important for their performance improvement. The combination of ex situ and in situ characterization techniques is very useful to disclose the underlying mechanisms (e.g., component conversion, structural evolution, reaction pathways, and interfacial interaction) of NCS-based applications.41,66,119–121,165 Besides, the optimization of mathematical modeling and theoretical simulation with higher rationality and reliability is also very helpful to promote the practical applications of NCSs.15,69,117,121,166 It is noteworthy that machine learning has been rapidly developed and widely applied in many fields, which is possibly a powerful way for the investigation of NCSs with superior performance in various applications by the purposeful design and simple, large-scale, high efficiency and low-cost preparation strategies.
