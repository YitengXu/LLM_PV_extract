    , Accepted 3rd January 2020First published on 4th January 2020AbstractThe oxidative instability of tin-based halide perovskites (Sn-HaP) is a culprit for inferior device performance and applications in other optoelectronic devices. Here, we have investigated the impacts of a Rb additive on the FASnI3 based device characteristics. It is observed that the RbCl additive facilitates uniform morphology with better crystal quality and suppression of oxidation of Sn2+. This results in an enhancement in the device efficiency of 3.12% for pure Sn-HaP to 5.89% for the RbCl additive with high reproducibility and superior stability. It also benefited from a higher diffusion potential and mitigation of defect activities with the RbCl additive in Sn-HaPSCs. These results corroborate that the incorporation of Rb in the FASnI3 structure plays a crucial role in improving the film growth, surface chemistry, and mitigation of trap centers.
1. Introduction
The startling progress in lead halide perovskite-based solar cells (Pb-HaPSCs) has drawn significant attention as next generation cost-effective photovoltaic technology. Although the device performance of Pb-HaPSCs exceeded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25%,1 the toxic Pb has to be replaced for commercialization. A number of non-toxic candidates such as Sn,2 Ge,3 Bi,4,5 and Sb6 based halide perovskites have been explored as Pb free HaPSCs.7 Among these alternatives, Sn-based halide perovskites (Sn-HaP), a close cousin to Pb-HaP, are promising alternatives. But the surface oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in Sn-HaP leads to higher carrier density and metal-like behavior which results in electrical shunting and hence rapidly deteriorates the device performance.8 Since Sn with a weakened inert pair effect has the proclivity to be oxidized to Sn4+, there is a high possibility of the co-existence of Sn2+ and Sn4+ in Sn-HaP films. As a consequence, it induces Sn2+ vacancies (VSn) having small formation energy.9–11 Indeed, the oxidation of Sn2+ occurs spontaneously if a reducing agent has not been used. Therefore, the oxidative instability of Sn-HaP is widely known as one of the main reasons for device malfunction.
Recently, many efforts have been devoted to addressing the oxidation and non-uniform morphology with poor surface coverage of Sn-HaP films for the improvement of the device performance.9,12–16 The addition of SnF2 in the precursor solution has been generally used for the suppression of Sn2+ oxidation.12,16,17 Since an excess of SnF2 worsens the morphology as well as the optoelectronic quality of the Sn-HaP film, multiple reports have explored alternative strategies for the enhancement of the device performances. Mixed cation Sn-HaP (FA0.75MA0.25SnI3) based devices have demonstrated a PCE as high as 8.12%.18,19 Diau and co-workers have achieved comparatively stable Sn-HaPSCs of a PCE of 9.6% using a nonpolar organic coadditive (guanidinium (GA)) in a FASnI3 lattice.20 Moreover, it has been reported that the incorporation of hydrophobic organic cations21,22 (butylammonium (BA+), phenylethylammonium (PEA+), 5-AVAI, etc.) and thiocyanate of GA23 and FA14 in FASnI3 forms a 2D/3D hybrid, which resulted in a PCE of ∼6 to 9%. These additives are found to be moisture resistive and to control the extent of oxidation. Similarly, alkali halide additives have been used for the fabrication of highly efficient Pb-HaPSCs.24,25 It has been documented that the incorporation of A-site cations with a smaller radius (i.e. alkali metal additives) contracts the corner-sharing SnI6 in the FASnI3 structure. This results in structural symmetry to get superior stability.26,27 Marshall et al. suggested that the partial substitution of Cs by Rb in CsSnI3 (Cs1−xRbxI3) gives a more stable film.28 Similarly, Wu and co-workers have reported the structural stability and suppression of the oxidation of FASnI3 by structural regulation with a Cs additive.29 There is still much room to address the issues related to Sn-HaP based devices. It requires a number of systematic studies to get insight into the film deterioration, device stability, and device physics for the substantial improvement of the device performance.
In this report, we have studied the role of Rb incorporation (i.e. a smaller cation in the A-site) into the lattice structure of FASnI3 for device efficiency and insight into device analysis. It is found that the RbCl additive improved the film quality and optophysical properties and hence resulted in a device efficiency of ∼5.89% (increased by ∼80% over the PCE of pure FASnI3) with higher reproducibility and improved stability. It is noticed that the Rb additive is benign for the reduction of the extent of oxidation of Sn2+ and defect passivation. We have discussed the insight into an additive approach to pave the way for resolving the oxidation and deterioration issue of Sn-HaPSCs.
2. Results and discussion
To study the effect of the Rb additive on the characteristics of FASnI3 films, we prepared the FA1−xRbxSnI3 films using a single precursor followed by an antisolvent dripping approach (Experimental section in the ESI†). Here, we have used RbCl as an additive for Rb composition in the precursor. Fig. 1a–d show the SEM images of the FA1−xRbxSnI3 films. The impact on the film coverage and grain size with the RbCl additive can be seen. We noticed grain formation with a small crystallite size for higher RbCl content (≥0.1) (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). A similar effect was observed for FA1−xCsxSnI329 and Cs1−xRbxSnI3 films28 with Cs and Rb rich compositions. The XRD patterns of the respective films are given in Fig. 1e. The characteristic diffraction peaks are matched with the orthorhombic FASnI3 phase. This is consistent with earlier reports.13,29 No characteristic XRD peak for the secondary phase was noticed. It indicates that the small granular features in the film morphology are small crystallites of the respective materials rather than impurities of a secondary phase. The characteristic XRD peak position exhibits a very small shifting trend toward a higher degree (Fig. 1f). This suggests the incorporation of Rb into the lattice of the host crystal, which results in the contraction of the crystal lattice due to the smaller ion size in the lattice (RFA+ = 253 pm and RRb+ = 152 pm). The XRD patterns of the Rb-incorporated film (Fig. S2, ESI†) show better stability, which agrees with the report that the lattice contraction is benign for the structural stability of the FASnI3 perovskite.29
 Fig. 1  SEM images (a–d), XRD patterns (e and f), absorption spectra (g) and PL spectra (h) of the FA1−xRbxSnI3 films with different RbCl contents (x = 0–0.12). 
The absorption spectra (Fig. 1g) show that the absorption responses are slightly affected by Rb incorporation. The PL response of the pristine FASnI3 film shows a rather asymmetric feature, which is attributed to the film quality. We can notice a very small red shifting trend with increasing Rb content. This also agrees with the report by McGehee and co-workers.26 It has been documented that the octahedral tilting of PbX6 increases the bandgap upon partial substitution of the larger FA with smaller Cs in Pb-HaP whereas the bandgap decreases for Sn-HaP due to lattice contraction. But when the small halide ions are added in the lattice Sn-HaP,30 the bandgap increases. This is analogous to the Pb-HaP film.31,32 In our results, the bandgap shifting tendency in FASnI3 with the RbCl content is also affected by the smaller cation (Rb) and chloride anion additive in accordance with the stoichiometry sharing of the additive in the film.
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance, we have fabricated a complete device with the inverted structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FA1−xRbxSnI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 2a) as mentioned in the Experimental section (ESI†). The effect on the device parameters with the RbCl additive is summarized in Table 1 and the J–V characteristics can be found in Fig. S3a, ESI.† The device with the RbCl additive (x ≤ 0.08) exhibited a PCE of ∼5.89% (with a VOC of 0.487 V, JSC ∼ 20.05 mA cm−2 and FF ∼ 0.604, steady-state JSC and PCE; Fig. S4, ESI†) with negligible hysteresis, which is an ∼80% improvement of the device efficiency compared to that of the pristine device (PCE ∼ 3.22%). This is attributed to the improvement in the morphology, crystallinity, and optoelectronic quality of the film. The poor performance for the device with a higher RbCl additive content is related to the deterioration of the film quality (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). It is presumed that the lattice contraction and tolerance factor are much demarked with higher Rb content (much smaller ionic size) in the FASnI3. It deteriorates the structural symmetry in the FASnI3 lattice,26,29 which is detrimental for optoelectronic properties for light harvesting. To examine the role of Rb further, we prepared devices with additives (0.08-RbI and 0.08-FACl) adopting the same fabrication approach. It is noticed that the devices with RbI and RbCl (Fig. S5 and Table ST1, ESI†) demonstrated enhanced device performance while there is no significant improvement for the device with the FACl additive, suggesting a minimal effect of Cl. In addition, the FAI rich FASnI3 film deteriorates the device performance. These results further assure that the Rb additive has a key role in the enhancement of the device parameters.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the pristine devices (x = 0) and those with the RbCl additive (x ≤ 0.08) are depicted in Fig. 2c (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The spectral response shows an overall enhancement in the entire spectral range. It is correlated to the suppression of recombination activities at the interface and vicinity of the band edge33 as a consequence of the improvement in the FASnI3 film quality with the RbCl additive. The values of JSC estimated by integrating the EQE spectra are 16.03 and 20.49 mA cm−2 for the pristine and Rb incorporated devices, respectively. These are in the range of the value obtained from the J–V characteristics (Fig. 2b). It is noticed that the band edge of the EQE spectrum has a little red shift for the device with Rb. This is consistent with the optophysical results (Fig. 1h).
The histograms of the device parameters (Fig. 2d and Fig. S6, ESI†) indicate higher reproducibility of the device with the RbCl additive possessing a much narrower distribution of figures of merit compared to the pristine FASnI3 device. Moreover, the device stability result (Fig. 3a and Fig. S7, ESI†) suggests that the Rb incorporation is benign for stability. It is further supported by the XRD results (Fig. S2, ESI†), which exhibit the pristine FASnI3 concomitant with a SnI2 secondary peak, indicating film deterioration with aging, whereas that for the Rb incorporated film is comparatively stable with few obscure peaks. This observation is parallel to the hypothesis of the structural regulation approach for the robust stability of FASnI3 with the incorporation of smaller ions in A-sites.26,29 The details of the stability issue are beyond the scope of this report. Our results suggest that the Rb incorporation in the FASnI3 structural lattice is propitious for the device stability and reproducibility. Indeed, there is still much room to resolve the limiting factors for getting a highly efficient and stable Sn-HaP based device.

To understand the insight into the effect of the RbCl additive, the surface chemistry of the FASnI3 film was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S8, ESI†). The characteristic peaks deconvoluted from the XPS spectra (Fig. 3b and c) at ∼486.7 (495.2) eV and 487.3 (495.7) eV are assigned to the Sn2+ and Sn4+ species, respectively. Interestingly, the surface stoichiometry extracted from the XPS spectra (Tables ST2 and ST3, ESI†) shows a tin rich composition (i.e. an atomic ratio of Sn:I of 1:1.38 for the pure and 1:1.49 for the added RbCl FASnI3 films). This is much deviated from the ideal composition of 1:3. Since XPS can probe only the elements situated less than 10 nm from the surface, the off-stoichiometry surface may be due to the existence of a higher content of SnF2 on the film surface. It is noticed that the pure FASnI3 film has a higher atomic percentage of Sn4+ compared with the Rb additive film. It corroborates that the Rb incorporation in the FASnI3 lattice controls the extent of Sn2+ oxidation and hence ameliorates the film quality. This is concurrent with the device results.
To investigate the impacts on the carrier profile and defect states, the capacitance spectra of the devices were analyzed. This technique has been commonly used to explore the optoelectronic properties of kesterite34,35 as well as Pb-HaP36,37 based thin film solar cells. The Mott–Schottky plot under dark conditions (Fig. 4a and b) reveals a larger diffusion potential (Vd)38 with the RbCl additive, which contributes to the increase in the VOC.39 The carrier profile (Fig. S9, ESI†) shows a reduction in the carrier density by approximately one order of magnitude for the RbCl added device (∼8.64 × 1016 for pristine to ∼9.57 × 1015 cm−3 for the RbCl additive). These results are in the range of the reported values.13,30 Seo and co-workers30 have documented that the carrier density for FASnI3 (6.76 × 1017 cm−3) is reduced by 3 orders of magnitude for a Br doped FASnI3 device (7.80 × 1014 cm−3). A similar result was obtained in the case of CsSnI3. For CsSnI2Br + SnF2 (33 mol% of Br), the carrier density for mixed halide CsSnI2Br (1.42 × 1017 cm−3) was reduced by 1 order of magnitude compared to that of pristine CsSnI3 (5.28 × 1018 cm−3).40 Moreover, the carrier profile for the device with the Rb additive is found to be confined as our earlier reports on Pb-HaPSCs.31,38 The device with pristine FASnI3 has a higher carrier density, which is attributed to a larger proportion of Sn4+ residing in a wide space charge region (SCR) of the pristine device. Note that the carrier density also accounts for the traps in the corresponding Sn-HaP layer. The smaller carrier density indicates fewer traps and hence attenuated recombination activities in the device. It indicates that the trap density can be quenched by Rb (i.e. smaller cation) incorporation in the FASnI3 lattice. This result supports the suppression of oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ as observed in the XPS analysis (Fig. 3b and c), which is analogous to the reduction of the trap density of Sn vacancies.11

To investigate the defect status further, the thermal capacitance–frequency (C–f–T) spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†) of the respective devices were analyzed. The C–f response in the dark at room temperature (Fig. S11a, ESI†) shows higher capacitance at a lower frequency regime for pure FASnI3, suggesting higher charge accumulation at the interface or junction. Note that the trapping/de-trapping activities at the trap states and charge accumulation at the interface junction contribute to the capacitance response. The capacitance spectra vary with the change in free carriers generated with thermal energy depending on the absorber layer quality. The temperature-dependent capacitance responses at different frequencies (Fig. S11, ESI†) display a slower decreasing rate for the device with the RbCl additive. The faster rate of change of the capacitance response in the pure FASnI3 indicates higher defect activities, which are prone to lead to poor device performance. Moreover, from the Arrhenius plots (Fig. 4c and d), it is found that the device with Rb incorporated FASnI3 has a shallower trap state at Et2 ≈ 0.412 eV (ν2 ≈ 9.35 × 109 s−1) than that for the pristine device at Et2 ≈ 0.654 eV (ν2 ≈ 8.46 × 1012 s−1) indicating that the Rb additive is propitious for defect mitigation. These defects are conjectured to reside either in the bulk or at the interface of the Sn-HaP layer. The defect densities (Fig. 4e and f) are found to be attenuated for the device with the Rb additive (2.68 × 1016 cm−3) compared to the pristine one (1.86 × 1017 cm−3). We noticed a deeper trap state and higher trap density profile for the FASnI3 based device than that reported for the high-efficiency Pb-HaP based device.37,41 The defect status is consistent with the corresponding device performance. This must be associated with the varying content of Sn2+ and Sn4+ species in the film and the nonstoichiometric surface as observed in the XPS spectra (Fig. 3b and c and Table ST3, ESI†). Our work corroborates that the structural regulation via incorporation of Rb (a smaller ion) in the A site improves the optoelectronic quality of Sn-HaP films. It has been documented that the organic coadditive and cocation approaches are beneficial for the improvement of the film quality and effective for passivation of defects induced by oxidation.14,15,20 Therefore, we believe that the Sn-HaP based device can be improved further by tailoring the film quality and stability via engineering inorganic and organic cations in the FASnI3 lattice.
3. Conclusions
We have explored the role of Rb insertion in the FASnI3 lattice for device performance. The Rb incorporation in the crystal lattice facilitates a uniform morphology with better crystal quality and suppression of oxidation of Sn2+. This leads to an improvement in the device with a power conversion efficiency of 3.12% for pure FASnI3 to 5.89% for Rb incorporated FASnI3. The analysis of the capacitance spectra reveals a shallower defect state and significant suppression of the defect density (∼1.86 × 1017 for pristine to 2.68 × 1016 cm−3 for Rb incorporated) as a consequence of structural regulation by Rb insertion in the FASnI3 crystal lattice. These results substantiate that the Rb in the FASnI3 structure plays a crucial role to control the surface chemistry, film formation and mitigation of trap centers. This work paves the way for optimization of the Sn-HaP film quality by modulating the crystal lattice with an incorporated additive for boosting the performance and stability of the device.
4. Experimental section
Materials and precursor solution
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers as mentioned and, unless otherwise specified, they were used as received. Formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.9%, luminiscent), RbCl (Sigma Aldrich), SnI2 (Sigma Aldrich), and SnF2 (Sigma Aldrich), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevious, A14083), PCBM (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) and BCP (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) were purchased and used as received.
For the fabrication of Sn-HaP films, the precursors were prepared by dissolving FAI (0.8 M), SnI2 (0.8 M), and SnF2 (0.08 M) for FASnI3 and RbCl:FAI (x, 1 − x) (0.8 M), SnI2 (0.8 M), and SnF2 (0.08 M) for FASnI3 with the RbCl additive film (RbxFA1−xSnI3) in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent for two hours at room temperature. PC61BM (Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity) solution (2 wt%) dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) was used for coating the electron transport layer (ETL). A super saturated BCP solution was prepared by dissolving 3 mg ml−1 in anhydrous isopropanol. All the solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters just before the deposition to avoid the risk of unwanted particles in the precursor solution.
Device fabrication
Solar cell devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω square−1). The ITO substrates were pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, pure water, and 2-propanol, followed by an ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 5 min to remove the organic residuals. A thin HTM layer (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS was deposited onto the ITO substrate by spin coating at 3000 rpm and subsequently dried at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate in ambient air. Then the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (<1.0 ppm O2 and H2O) and the rest of the steps were carried out inside the glove box. The Sn-HaP precursor was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 50 s (ramping slope 3 s) followed by dripping 100 μl of CB at the 25th second. Then to promote the crystallization, those as grown Sn-HaP films were simply placed on a hot plate at 60 °C for 10 min and 100 °C for 5 min. For the ETM layer, PC61BM was spin-coated on top of the Sn-perovskite films at 700 rpm for 30 s followed by 5000 rpm for 10 s and baked at 65 °C for 12 min, followed by dynamic deposition of a thin BCP layer spinning at 2000 rpm for 20 s followed by 4000 rpm for 10 s, which was annealed at 50 °C for 2 min. To complete the device structure, the samples were then transferred into the evaporation chamber connected to the glove box for metal contact deposition. Finally, 100 nm of Ag was thermally evaporated at a pressure <10−4 Pa. Devices with an area of ∼0.26 cm2 were sealed using UV-curable resins before the subsequent measurements in ambient conditions.
Device characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fabricated Sn-HaP films were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54050 Å). The morphology of the films was studied and cross-sectional images were taken using a high resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) at a 5 kV accelerating voltage (Hitachi, S-4800). The absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the various films were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (7200, V-Jasco) and spectrofluorometer (FP8500, Jasco). XPS spectra were obtained using a Versa Probe II (ULVAC-PHI, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured at a scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 under 1 sun with an AM1.5G spectral filter (100 mW cm−2) coupled with an MPPT system (Systemhouse Sunrise Corp.). For the stability test, the encapsulated devices were measured under MPPT conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a spectrometer (SM-250IQE, Bunkokeiki, Japan). The capacitance–frequency response (C–f) was obtained using an LCR meter (IM3536, Hioki), which probes from 20 Hz to 2 MHz at an AC voltage amplitude of 30 mV under dark conditions in the temperature range of 253–343 K. After confirming the geometric capacitance regime in the C–f spectra, capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were carried out at 10 kHz under dark conditions (the geometric capacitance regime in the C–f spectra). For temperature dependent C–f scans, a temperature-controlled chamber (SU-221) was used having a control system with an error of ±0.1 K (°C).
