    , Accepted 4th December 2019First published on 4th December 2019AbstractClean energy and renewable fine chemicals including biofuels, hydrogen, and bicarbonates are critical for a sustainable and green future. In this study, the integrated production of naturally separated high density liquid biofuels (mainly C7 and C14 olefins), hydrogen gas, and fine chemicals is achieved in an electrochemical cell under ambient conditions. Biofuels are obtained by anodic decarboxylation of the carboxylates, hydrogen is obtained by cathodic reduction of water, and fine chemicals are obtained by the reaction between the alkaline aqueous solution and the anodic carbon dioxide products. An environmentally friendly and low-cost aqueous substitution method is employed to prepare self-supporting Pt nanospheres on 3D porous titanium sponge (Pt@TS) composite electrodes for such an integrated electrolysis. A Pt@TS anode with abundant Pt(100) facets exhibits enhanced activity and stability for electrocatalytic biofuel production as compared with commercial Pt anodes.
1. Introduction
With the global soaring of energy demand and environmental problems, the need for abundant, renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources to replace finite fossil fuels is critical. In this context, solar and wind power are widely accepted as alternative energy sources and can be used in the form of electricity by photovoltaics and wind turbines, respectively. However, as they are intermittent, territorial and weather dependent, it is essential to efficiently convert them into a storable form for widespread applications.1 Electrochemistry provides promising solutions to the above problems by storing electrical energy into chemical bonds.
To date, various devices, electrocatalysts, and electrochemical methods have been developed to convert electrical energy into storable forms including batteries,2 electrocatalytic hydrogen production,3 carbon dioxide and methane fixation,4–6 organic electrosynthesis,7 and biofuel production.8–11 Electrocatalytic liquid biofuel production is a relevant technique for electrical energy conversion and storage due to the possibility to have a comparably larger energy density, being also compatible with the existing oil transportation and distribution infrastructure. Kolbe electrolysis (eqn (1)), which is the electro-oxidation of carboxylates to olefins with carbon chain propagation, holds the potential to provide biomass-derived drop-in fuels and fuel additives.12 2R-COO− → R–R + 2CO2 + 2e−.(1)
However, the scale-up of Kolbe electrolysis has been restricted by a number of reasons. Firstly, Pt sheets and methanol have always been the mainstream anode material and solvent, respectively. The flat structure of the Pt sheet is inappropriate for the diffusion of gas products and the surface-adsorbed bubble may block the active sites; the Pt inside acts as a current collector, which leads to a decrease in the Pt utilization ratio. On the other hand, anchoring Pt nanocrystals on a 3D conductive substrate (see Fig. 1 for comparison between the Pt sheet and self-supporting Pt anodes) improves Pt utilization, overcomes the above shortcomings and puts Kolbe electrolysis a step closer to industrial application. Moreover, it is technically challenging and significant to separate the products from the solution after the conventional electro-synthetic reactions.13,14 Importantly, replacing methanol with water as a solvent fulfills the criteria of green chemistry with the additional advantage of spontaneous organic product separation upon generation, easy to collect at low-energetic/economic costs. The use of alkaline salts as a supporting electrolyte also provides access to bicarbonates via conversion of in situ generated CO2. Based on these premises, the potential of Kolbe electrolysis needs to be fully realized and requires the development of novel self-supporting highly active and stable anodes.
 Fig. 1  Schematic comparison between the conventional Pt sheet anode and the self-supporting Pt-doped anode on a 3D porous substrate using the 3D titanium sponge as an example. 
The development of anodes for Kolbe electrolysis or other electrosynthesis has been rarely reported, mainly due to dissolution (especially non-noble metals) during the anodic oxidation process. Liu et al. reported the fabrication of micro-/nano-two-tier structured Pt electrodes by high power laser cutting with superoleophobicity and superhydrophilicity for Kolbe electrolysis.15 The electrode exhibited an enhanced performance with a working life over 8.3 h compared to that of commercial Pt sheets (1.6 h). The cost of the electrode is too high for the scale-up application since the electrode is made of pure Pt and the relationship between the Pt structure (e.g. crystal facets) and Kolbe performance has not been addressed yet.
In this study, self-supporting Pt nanoknot balls on titanium sponge (TS) composite electrodes, denoted as Pt@TS, were synthesized via an aqueous substitution method. The Pt nanoknot balls are rich in Pt(100) facets, which are highly active for Kolbe electrolysis. The 3D porous TS substrate has good electrical conductivity and is good for electrolyte transport and gas diffusion. The synergic effects between Pt and Ti promote the reactant adsorption. Pt@TS exhibited excellent activity and good reusability for Kolbe electrolysis. The preparation process of Pt@TS and its application towards electrocatalytic biofuel production were conducted in aqueous solutions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Chemicals
Caprylic acid (C7H15COOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, 46–47% Pt), oxalic acid (C2H2O4), sulphuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), acetone (C3H6O), and Pt/C (20 wt%), all of AR grade, were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Titanium sponge (TS) (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 2.6 mm; density: 1500 g m−2), which was cut by wire electrical discharge machining, was purchased from Suzhou Jiashide Metal Foam Co., Ltd. All aqueous solutions were prepared using Millipore Milli-Q ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.2 Mω.
2.2 Synthesis of Pt-doped titanium sponge composites
Firstly, TSs were ultrasonically cleaned with ethanol and water, and then pickled in 5 wt% oxalic acid solution at 100 °C for 2 hours.16 After acid etching, a homogeneous TS surface microstructure was obtained. The TSs were further washed with ultrapure water and dried under an ambient atmosphere for further use. Then, the galvanic deposition of Pt was conducted on TS. In detail, a piece of the pretreated TS and 8 mL of 2 mM H2PtCl6 and 0.5 M H2SO4 were mixed in a Teflon vial (10 mL). The vial was tightly sealed and maintained at 30 °C in air for 60 min. The as-synthesized Pt-doped TS sample was washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water several times and dried at 60 °C in an electric oven overnight.
2.3 Physical characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using an S-4800 operating at 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectra were acquired using a JEOL JEM-2100F operating at 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements were carried out using an Agilent 7500 ICP-MS instrument.
2.4 Evaluation of decarboxylation activity
The electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical cell connected to a CompactStat electrochemical workstation (Ivium, The Netherlands) with a platinum gauze (1 cm × 1 cm, mesh number: 60) and Hg/HgO (20 wt% KOH, 98 mV vs. NHE) as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Polarization data were obtained at 5 mV s−1 while rapidly stirring the solution with a magnetic stir bar at 500 rpm. Electrolysis was carried out at a constant current density of 0.25 A cm−2, until the charge reaches 1 F per mole caprylic acid.
2.5 Product analysis

2.5.1 Qualitative analysis. 
Qualitative analysis was conducted by GC-MS. About 0.02 μl of each sample was injected in the split-injection mode with a split ratio of 80:1. The split/splitless injector was connected to an HP-5MS column (50 m × 0.25 mm, and 0.25 mm ID, Agilent) that interfaced with a mass spectrometer (5975N mass spectrometry, Agilent). The temperatures of the injector, interface and ion source were 250, 280, and 230 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas set at a constant velocity of 36 cm s−1 in velocity mode. Initially, the oven temperature was maintained at 40 °C for 1 min, and was increased at a rate of 20 °C min−1 to 150 °C and held for 1 min, and then was increased at a rate of 10 °C min−1 to 200 °C. Finally, it was increased at a rate of 40 °C min−1 to 310 °C and held for 1 min. The mass range scanned was 20 to 300 m/z. Peak identification was accomplished by comparing the mass spectra with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2005 mass spectral library (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD).


2.5.2 Quantitative analysis. 
Quantitative analysis was carried out using a GC (Agilent 7890A, Agilent Technologies, the United States of America) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The separation is achieved on a HP-5 column (50 m × 0.2 mm; i.d. 0.5 μm). For mixed standards, the GC oven is programmed from 40 °C (hold time: 12 min) to 160 °C at a rate of 15 °C min−1 (hold time: 10 min), and then increased to 280 °C at a rate of 15 °C min−1 (hold time: 2 min). The concentrations of the hydrocarbons (i.e., n-heptane, 1-heptene, and n-tetradecane) and n-octanoic acid were determined by internal calibration curves with n-dodecane as an internal standard.

2.6 Calculations
The conversion (%) of n-octanoic acid, yield (%), and selectivity (%) of electrocatalytic deoxygenation products were calculated based on the following three equations: (1) (2) (3)
The faradaic efficiency (FE) of product formation was calculated based on the following equation: (4)where the number of electron transfer for C14 product formation is 2 and that for C7 product formation is 1, and F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physical characterization
The Pt@TS anode was prepared by a facile galvanic replacement reaction in aqueous solution at room temperature as shown in Scheme 1. Because of the standard reduction potential of PtCl62−/Pt (1.44 V, vs. SHE), comparably higher to that of TiO2/Ti (−1.63 V, vs. SHE),17 the 3D porous network Ti sponge suspended in the solution can be oxidized by PtCl62− according to the equation in Scheme 1.

After the galvanic deposition of Pt on the TS superficies, TS was changed from grey to dark as shown in Fig. S1,† with a fully preserved porous structure (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2†). Fig. 2b shows that Pt knot balls are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of TS. A closer look at Fig. 2c shows two groups of Pt knot balls with a diameter around 150 nm and 500 nm on the surface of Pt@TS. Pt knot balls have a rough surface, which positively contributes to its electrochemical active area (ECSA), Fig. 2d. Pt knot balls directly grow in the vicinity of TS (as the arrow points in Fig. 2d), which enables Pt@TS to show a fast charge transportation efficiency.18 The particle size, morphological structure, and mass loading of Pt nanocrystals can be further modified by the preparation temperature and the concentration of H2PtCl6 during the galvanic deposition process, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4.†

The morphology and structure of Pt@TS were further characterized by TEM, HRTEM, XRD, and CV. TEM images (Fig. 3a) confirm a knot ball-like sphere morphology with abundant nanopores and its high surface area. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) shows a portion of the Pt@TS sphere with good crystallinity. The d-spacing value from HRTEM and FFT results indicates the formation of Pt(100) on the surface. FFT images also show the diffraction rings of Ti(102), Ti(002), Pt5Ti3(100), and Pt5Ti3(004), originating from TS and the alloy of Pt and TS, respectively. This suggests that the deposited Pt nanoparticles are in two forms on TS: polycrystalline Pt and the PtTi alloy. The polycrystalline nature of Pt knot balls in Pt@TS is also supported by XRD and CV results.

The XRD diffraction peaks (Fig. 3c) at 39.8, 46.2, and 67.5 can be assigned to the (111), (100), and (110) planes of Pt (JCPDS No. 04-0802), respectively. The other newly formed peaks are ascribed to TiH2, which is a sintering agent used in the production of TS.19 The cyclic voltammogram in Fig. 3d shows two small peaks at −0.82 V and −0.49 V, and a strong peak at −0.61 V, corresponding to Pt(111), Pt(110), and Pt(100), respectively.20 The above results show that knot ball-like polycrystalline Pt knot balls are formed on TS with Pt(100) as the main facet. Moreover, the ECSA of Pt nanoparticles in the Pt@TS electrode was calculated to be 45.5 ± 2.1 m2 gPt−1 from the integrated hydrogen desorption charge (QH) shown in Fig. 3d.21
The surface composition and valence states of Pt@TS were further characterized by XPS. The survey spectrum (Fig. 4a) confirms the existence of Pt species in Pt@TS. Fig. 4b provides the Pt 4f core level spectrum, with two peaks at binding energy values of 71.4 and 74.6 eV corresponding to the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 orbitals of metallic Pt,22 consistent with the HRTEM and XRD results. These findings indicate that Pt0 is dominated in the Pt knot balls. Moreover, the Pt 4f7/2 peak shifts ca. 0.2 eV as compared to that of pure Pt0,23 which originates from the alloy with Ti, in good agreement with the results from the FFT images (Fig. 3b inset). This upshift may be related to the strong electronic effect of Ti on Pt, contributing to the ideal adsorption energy of the feed reactant on the surface of Pt@TS. The high-resolution XPS Ti 2p spectrum in Fig. 4c consists of two sharp peaks 459.6 and 465.4 eV due to the spin–orbit splitting of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, in agreement with the presence of Ti4+ species. The high-resolution O 1s spectrum of Pt@TS in Fig. 4d shows two peaks located at 530.4 and 532.2 eV, which are attributed to Ti–O–Ti from TiO2 and the adsorbed oxygen species on the surface, respectively.24,25 The above results prove the successful deposition of Ti modified Pt knot balls with good reactant adsorption capability and some TiO2 on the TS surface after the galvanic replacement reaction.

3.2 Activity evaluation
The Kolbe electrolysis performance of Pt@TS was evaluated in an aqueous solution of 0.5 M CA and 0.5 M KOH at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. As shown in Fig. 5a, the anodic polarization curves of Pt@TS anodes were obtained from 1.0 to 3.5 V by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). LSV measurements of the benchmark commercial Pt sheet and bare TS were also conducted for comparison. Pt@TS shows the lowest onset oxidation potential (ca. 1.5 V) among the tested anodes, which indicates that Pt@TS has a comparatively superior activity towards CA decarboxylation to that of commercial Pt anodes or bare TS. Besides, Pt@TS has a negatively shifted oxidation peak located at 2.0 V and a larger peak current density at 27 mA cm−2 with respect to that of the benchmark commercial Pt sheets (2.2 V and 15 mA cm−2, respectively). On the other hand, the bare TS substrate exhibited negligible activity for CA decarboxylation, with an anodic peak at ca. 2.5 V and a peak current density at 2–3 mA cm−2, respectively. These results confirmed that the activity sites on Pt@TS originate from Pt nano knot balls anchored on the TS substrate and/or Pt–Ti interaction (Fig. 4b).

(d) Reusability tests of the Pt@TS anode (fresh electrolyte for each run with an aged anode). The inset of b shows the fitted equivalent circuit. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also carried out to investigate the CA decarboxylation performance of different anodes. All obtained Nyquist plots exhibited single semicircles over the frequency range tested, corresponding to one time constant, as shown in Fig. 5b. The impedance spectra were analyzed by fitting the experimental data to the equivalent circuit model shown in the Fig. 5b inset, which is a parallel combination of the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and the semi-infinite diffusion impedance of the anodes (W), and the capacitance of the double-layer capacitor of the anode (Cd), both in series with the solution resistance (Rs). The Rct value is related to the catalytic kinetics and a lower Rct value corresponds to a faster reaction rate. The Rct value of Pt@TS (0.56 Ω) was calculated to be the smallest among all the investigated anodes including Pt sheets (5.49 Ω) and bare TS (1.25 Ω), indicating that Pt@TS has the fastest charge-transfer. The reduction in the Rct value of Pt@TS relates to the direct growth of Pt nanocrystals on the conductive TS (Fig. 2d) and enables a speedy charge transfer between the active sites and the current collector.26
CA decarboxylation experiments were carried out using Pt@TS, Pt sheets, and bare TS anodes at 0.25 A cm−2 in 25 ml aqueous solutions of 0.5 M CA and 0.5 M KOH. It is worth mentioning that other than the biofuels (C7 and C14 alkanes) produced on the anode, gaseous hydrogen and fine chemicals (bicarbonates) were also formed over the cathode and in the alkaline solution, respectively. An obvious phase boundary was formed after electrolysis between the aqueous solution of bicarbonates and hydrophobic biofuel products (Fig. S5†). The chemical reactions related to their synthesis are listed in eqn (S1) to (S4).† The observed hydrocarbon products from CA decarboxylation were n-heptane, isomers of heptene, and n-tetradecane, all detected by GC/MS. The relationship between the hydrocarbon yield/faradaic efficiency (FE) and the anodes is shown in Fig. 5c. The hydrocarbon yield and FE over a Pt@TS anode were comparably higher to those observed over Pt sheets or a bare TS substrate. This implies that the active sites for CA decarboxylation are Pt nanoknot balls and/or Pt–Ti alloy sites, in good agreement with the LSV (Fig. 5a) and XPS results (Fig. 4b). In addition, this hypothesis has also been demonstrated by the comparison between Pt@TS and commercial Pt/C on TS anodes. As shown in Fig. S6,† Pt@TS exhibits an FE about two times higher with respect to Pt/C on TS at an identical Pt mass loading.
Five consecutive runs for CA decarboxylation over a Pt@TS anode were conducted under the aforementioned conditions with a fresh loading electrolyte for each run but using an aged anode with some treatment to check its reusability (Fig. 5d). The Pt@TS anode shows good reusability with a negligible decline in the CA decarboxylation performance. On the other hand, the surface of the conventional flat Pt anode was covered with organic products after electrolysis (Fig. S7†). It was not suitable to be used in a new run without cleaning its surface. Besides, the Pt content in the Pt@TS anode slightly decreases (from 4.2 ± 0.1% to 3.7 ± 0.1%) after five reaction cycles, according to the ICP-OES analysis. These results indicate that almost no active sites were dissolved in the reaction solution during the electrolysis process, an additional advantage from the directly grown Pt crystals on the TS (stable to leaching/dissolution from the TS substrate) due to a strong active site-substrate (Pt–Ti) interaction.27
4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have developed an efficient and stable self-supporting Pt@TS anode for the sustainable production of naturally separated biofuels, H2, and fine chemicals via Kolbe electrolysis in an aqueous solution. The anode was prepared by an aqueous substitution method and the electrolysis was conducted in an aqueous solution of carboxylates. Electrons other than any oxidizing agents were used as immaterial agents during the electrolysis process. This procedure fulfills the criteria of green chemistry by solely using water as the solvent throughout the anode preparation and the biofuel production processes.28 It demonstrates that electrifying biomass valorization in an aqueous solution is promising for the sustainable production of carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals. It also provides a ready-to-use method for the storage of overproduced fluctuating wind power and photovoltaics-sourced electricity in the form of biomass-derived fuels and chemicals.
