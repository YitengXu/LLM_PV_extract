1. Introduction
With the development of modern industries, the demand for energy is increasing rapidly, which inevitably causes the large-scale utilization of fossil energy resources. The huge consumption of traditional non-renewable resources (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas), on the one hand, has led to the dilemma of resource shortage or even exhaustion, and on the other hand it also brings about serious environmental problems. Exploration of clean and renewable energy sources is emergent and important. Solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy, etc., have been developed to try to replace traditional energy sources. Nevertheless, the instability, intermittence, and regionality greatly limit the widespread use of these sustainable energy resources. Therefore, the development of other technologies that can utilize renewable clean energy sources in a reasonable way is of vital significance for solving current energy shortage and environmental problems. In recent years, emerging energy storage and conversion technologies such as fuel cells, electrochemical water splitting, metal–air batteries, and CO2 to fuel conversion have been extensively explored due to their high efficiency and low pollution to the environment.1–4 These electrochemical technologies can effectively realize the conversion of chemical energy and electrical energy, and play a crucial role in the efficient use of renewable clean energy by alleviating energy crisis and environmental pollution problems.
Currently, the critical point of electrochemical energy technologies mainly depends on multiple electrocatalytic reaction processes, which involve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), etc. The HER and OER are the cathode and anode reactions of electrochemical water splitting to generate H2 and O2, respectively, whereas the obtained H2 and O2 are converted to water once again in fuel cells along with electricity and heat via the oxidation reaction of H2 at the anode and the ORR at the cathode.5 The ORR and OER are also a pair of reversible reactions that occur at the cathode of a metal–air battery.6 The CO2RR driven by electricity is a sustainable approach to form valuable chemicals and fuels with high efficiency and product specificity.7,8 These reactions determine the efficiency of electrochemical technologies or devices, and further affect the efficient utilization of renewable clean energy (Fig. 1). As a result, various electrocatalysts have been developed to drive the above electrocatalytic reactions effectively by improving the kinetics and reducing the overpotential. Among these electrocatalysts, Pt-based metal catalysts have favorable kinetics and extremely small overpotentials for the HER and ORR,9,10 while RuO2 and IrO2 are considered to be promising catalyst candidates for the OER.11 Though noble metals or their oxides have shown outstanding catalytic activity for the above-mentioned electrocatalytic reactions, their scarcity, high cost, and easy poisoning have become great restrictions for large-scale commercial use of these noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Therefore, the study of high-efficiency electrocatalysts with high activity, low cost, abundant resources, good stability, and resistance to poisoning has become a research hotspot and top priority for the exploration of renewable energy technologies.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of some electrocatalytic reactions and their applications. 
Recently, much effort has been made towards exploring earth-abundant electrocatalysts with high activity, low cost, and good stability. The general principle for the design of electrocatalysts primarily lies in the increase in active sites. It is mainly from two aspects: (1) the increase in the number of active sites can be accomplished by changing the morphology, porosity, specific surface area, etc.; and (2) increasing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts can be achieved by heteroatom doping, interface construction, defect regulation, hybridization, etc. On this basis, a large variety of transition metal-based (e.g., metal, alloy, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, metal selenides, metal nitrides, metal carbides) or non-metal catalysts (e.g., heteroatom-doped nanocarbon materials, polymers) and their composites were explored as catalysts for different electrocatalytic reactions.12–18 Among these studies, the catalysts with porous structures usually exhibit superior catalytic performance due to their more accessible catalytic sites and higher appropriate confinement toward active species as compared with non-porous catalysts. As typically representative porous materials, porous organic polymers (POPs) are ideal porous structures to incorporate catalytically active species in their frameworks or to be used as sacrificial precursors for synthesizing porous catalysts with highly dispersed catalytically active sites.
POPs are based on the covalent linkages formed by chemical polymerization reactions (e.g., Schiff base condensation, Friedel–Crafts alkylation reaction, Suzuki coupling reaction, Knoevenagel reaction, Aldol condensation, Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction, Yamamoto–Ullmann coupling reaction, Scholl reaction, phenazine ring fusion reaction, cyclotrimerization reaction, oxidative coupling reaction, amide/imide/dioxane/boroxine/boronate ester formation reaction) of organic groups or fragments to result in extended 2D or 3D network structures (Fig. 2a).19,20 According to their structural characteristics and preparation methods, POPs can be divided into polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),21 hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs),22 conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs),23 covalent organic frameworks (COFs),24 covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs),25 porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs),26etc. (Fig. 2b). POPs generally have tuneable pore structures, high surface areas, diverse chemical compositions, and controllable functionalities via the pre-design of organic linkers or post-modification. In addition, POPs are composed of lightweight elements linked by strong covalent bonds, which endow POPs with low densities and high chemical stability. These characteristics enable POPs to be applied widely in various fields, including gas storage and separation,27 optoelectronics,28 proton conduction,29 heterogeneous catalysis,30 removal of pollutants,31 and energy storage and conversion.32–34 As an important part of energy storage and conversion, electrocatalytic reactions are the core of energy storage and conversion technologies. POPs possess ideal structures in which electroactive components can be implanted in their frameworks, and POPs can serve as appropriate platforms for active species through methods like coating and hybridization, making POPs suitable catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions. In addition, POPs also exhibit efficient reactant enrichment and good mass transfer performance by virtue of their functional organic components and porous structures. Meanwhile, their porous structures and high surface areas can expose more active sites for electrocatalytic reactions and then increase their electrochemically active surface areas, which indicate the effective areas actually involved in the electrocatalytic reactions and theoretically represent the contact areas between the active sites of catalysts and electrolytes. As a result, the increase in electrochemically active surface areas will probably improve their electrochemical performances.
 Fig. 2  (a) Representative chemical reactions that have been developed for the construction of POPs. (b) Representative examples of six POP materials (C, grey; H, white; N, blue; O, red; B, pink). 
Over the past decades, application of POPs for electrocatalytic reactions can be mainly divided into the following two strategies: (1) POPs are employed as precursors to obtain heteroatom-doped carbon materials via pyrolysis; and (2) the organic groups or metal ions in POPs are directly used as active sites to catalyze the reactions. In terms of pyrolysis, POP-derived carbon catalysts have shown outstanding performance for different electrocatalytic reactions, owing to their heteroatom doping, high porosity, and good conductivity.35–37 Nevertheless, the resulting uncertain compositions/structures and the loss of functionality of organic groups bring uncertainty to catalytic activity and also hamper the investigation of electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.38 In contrast, pyrolysis-free POPs have precise compositions and structures, and can be atomically controlled to afford explicit chemical structures and definite active sites, which are beneficial to understanding the nature of electrocatalysis. As a result, multitudinous effort has been made towards preparing POP-based electrocatalysts via delicate devisal and controllable strategies. The pyrolysis-free POPs toward multiple electrocatalytic reactions offers a desirable catalyst system for efficient electrocatalysis and a greater insight into the electrocatalytic mechanism. These research studies are worth outlining to open new perspectives on rational design of POP-based electrocatalysts. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the application of pyrolysis-free POPs in the electrocatalysis field.
POP-based electrocatalysts reported up to now can be conceptually classified into four categories: those based on heteroatom introduction, modification with metal ions, encapsulation of metal-based materials, and combination with conductive carbon materials (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes) or metal electrodes (e.g., Au, Ag). Among these POPs, COFs are a class of crystalline materials and generally have more ordered pore structures as compared with other POPs. On this basis, COFs have been frequently employed as host frameworks in the post-modification reactions to bear functional groups or other active species for electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, as compared with the dynamic covalent bond linkage of COFs, other POPs constructed with stable covalent bonds may show higher stability than COFs in theory. Therefore, these POPs are also widely employed in the research studies of electrocatalysis. Although several reports have reviewed POPs and their derived materials for electrocatalysis, these papers are primarily concerned with COFs or a certain class of electrocatalytic reactions,38–40 and are also inadequate for a good understanding of the mechanisms and factors of POPs in application of electrocatalysis. A comprehensive discussion is thus of great significance for future design of POPs in the field of electrocatalysis. Based on this point, we systematically analyze and summarize the application of POPs in various electrocatalytic reactions, including the HER, OER, ORR, CO2RR, N2 reduction, nitrate/nitrite reduction, nitrobenzene reduction, hydrogen oxidation, and benzyl alcohol oxidation reactions. In the following sections, the synthesis procedures, compositions, structures, performances, and mechanisms of POPs in electrocatalysis will be discussed and summarized, mainly focusing on their recent progress. Finally, we discuss the limitations of POPs in electrocatalysis and put forward some suggestions for the future development of POPs toward practical electrocatalytic applications. It is expected that this review can provide an exhaustive and insightful understanding and future directions of POPs in electrocatalysis.
2. Hydrogen evolution reaction
2.1 Fundamental principles of the HER
The HER is comprised of multi-step elementary reactions, which occur at the cathode of water splitting reaction. The reaction pathway of the HER in an acidic environment can be described as follows: (1) H+ is first hydrated into H3O+ in water; (2) on the surface area of the electrode, H3O+ dehydrates by obtaining an electron from the electrode to become an intermediate hydrogen atom; (3) the intermediate hydrogen atoms are then adsorbed onto the catalyst surface and every two of them further combine with each other to produce hydrogen molecules; and (4) the produced hydrogen molecules are desorbed from the catalyst surface and finally aggregate to form H2 bubbles.41 The reaction mechanism of the HER under alkaline or neutral conditions is similar to that under acidic conditions, except that protons are produced by water molecules in the alkaline or neutral environment. As a result, the HER routes can be generally expressed as eqn (1)–(6):42
In acidic medium: Volmer step: H3O+ + * + e− → H* + H2O(1) Heyrovsky step: H3O+ + H* + e− → H2 + H2O + *(2) Tafel step: H* + H* → H2 + 2*(3)In alkaline or neutral medium: Volmer step: H2O + * + e− → H* + OH−(4) Heyrovsky step: H2O + H* + e− → H2 + OH− + *(5) Tafel step: H* + H* → H2 + 2*(6)
in which * represents the catalytically active site and H* indicates a hydrogen atom adsorbed on an active site. As compared with the alkaline or neutral medium, the acidic medium is more favorable for the HER because of the high H+ concentration.
The first Volmer reaction is the initial electron transfer step, in which the protons get electrons to form H* on the electrode surface. The second Heyrovsky reaction is an electrochemical desorption step, in which H* species combine with the protons or water molecules to produce H2. The third Tafel reaction is a composite desorption step, in which H* species bond with each other to generate H2.43 Thus, the overall HER process involves two steps: electron transfer and hydrogen desorption. If the rate of the HER is determined by the electron transfer step, the Volmer reaction will be the rate determining step with a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec−1. Otherwise, if the hydrogen desorption stage is the rate determining step, the Heyrovsky or Tafel reaction will control the whole kinetics of the HER with a Tafel slope of 40 or 30 mV dec−1, which is determined by the number of H* species. If there are sufficient H* species on the catalyst surface, two H* species are inclined to combine with each other and the Tafel step controls the reaction kinetics. Conversely, if the number of H* species is insufficient on the catalyst surface, H* species tend to bond with protons or water molecules, and the Heyrovsky step controls the reaction rate of the HER. Hence the kinetic process of the HER can be inferred from the value of the Tafel slope.
In the actual reaction process of the HER, the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface are a pair of competing reactions.44 If the adsorption is too strong, H* is easily formed, but it prohibits H* desorption from producing H2. In contrast, if a catalyst surface has weak binding, it is unfavorable for the formation of H2. In consequence, a good balance between adsorption and desorption can show good HER activity. For an ideal HER catalyst, its surface should show moderate adsorption and desorption for hydrogen with easy electron–proton transfer and H2 release processes. In general, the free energy of hydrogen adsorption  on the catalyst surface is employed to predict the HER activity of the catalyst. When  is close to 0, the corresponding exchange current density at this point is the largest and the HER can be easily carried out. Therefore, it is necessary to explore catalysts with moderate  or to optimize existing catalysts by tuning their  for desired HER activity. In general, catalysts with high catalytic activity should have low overpotentials, small Tafel slopes, and large exchange current density.
2.2 POP-based catalysts for the HER
It is known POPs can be easily and precisely regulated and functionalized to achieve the desired composition, pore structures, π-conjugate planes, high stability, and functionality, which are favorable for the exposure of catalytic sites, diffusion kinetics of substrates and/or products, and electron transfer on the overall framework, allowing POPs to be applied as electrocatalysts for the HER (Table 1). At present, POPs applied for the HER fall mainly into three categories: heteroatom-containing POPs, metallized POPs, and POPs with incorporated metal nanoparticles.

2.2.1 Heteroatom-containing POPs. 
According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Ball et al. predicted that a Si and P co-doped bipyridine-linked CTF (SiPF-Bpy-CTF) is a promising electrocatalyst for the HER by substituting bipyridine hydrogens with F atoms (Fig. S1, ESI†).52 SiPF-Bpy-CTF has a negligible band gap (7 meV) after co-doping and substitution and an ideal  value close to 0 eV, which might enable it to achieve ideal charge transfer kinetics during the HER. As compared to 3D heteroatom-containing POPs, 2D POPs have been experimentally proved to have more effective charge transfer during the HER. For example, a 2D N-rich covalent quinazoline network (TQ-CQN) exhibits a lower charge transfer resistance as compared with a tricycloquinazoline-based 3D CMP (Fig. S2, ESI†).46 When TQ-CQN is used as the catalyst for the HER, TQ-CQN shows a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, indicating its faster kinetics, which largely benefits from its fully conjugated rigid plane and ordered π–π array stacking. The delocalization effect of π-electrons facilitates charge migration, and ordered 1D nanochannel arrays provide facile mass diffusion, hence improving the charge transfer and diffusion kinetics.
A porphyrin is a heterocyclic conjugated aromatic molecule composed of four pyrrole subunits connected by methyne bridges. The aromatic conjugated structure enables the porphyrin to have a high electron movement ability during the electrocatalytic reaction. Pradhan and co-workers reported a pyrene–porphyrin containing imine-based COF (SB-PORPy) through the Schiff base reaction of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAP) with 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene (TFFPy) (Fig. 3a and b).47 SB-PORPy shows a Tafel slope of 116 mV dec−1 for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 due to π-electronic conjugation and pyrene stimulated π–π stacking interaction. The reaction mechanism of the porphyrin unit for the HER was investigated by Bhaumik and co-workers via a porphyrin-based polymer (TpPAM) (Fig. S3, ESI†), which is constructed by the condensation of triformyl phloroglucinol (Tp) and 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (PAM) for the HER.48 A repeating unit of meso-tetra(4-(benzylideneamino)phenyl)-porphyrin in TpPAM was selected as a model. According to DFT calculations, the protonation of pyrrolic N atoms at the porphyrin ring is the origin of HER activity for TpPAM under acidic conditions (Fig. 3c and d). After protonation, the porphyrin ring with chemically adsorbed H+ as an electron acceptor captures one electron and delocalizes it over the π-conjugated structure, along with the formation of TpPAM–H*. This proton-coupled electron transfer is the first Volmer step of TpPAM for the HER. Subsequently, H* reacts with H+ or another H* via desorption reaction to form H2 (Fig. 3e). The  value (0.08 eV) and the position of TpPAM in the volcano plot also demonstrate the good HER activity of TpPAM as compared with other metal catalysts (Fig. 3f).

2.2.2 Metallized POPs. 
Metal-based materials are the well-known catalysts for the HER with efficient electrocatalytic activity; thus the metalation of POPs is a recognized promising strategy to achieve high activity by creating more active sites in POPs. Porphyrin units are usually used to chelate metal ions due to their strong coordination ability with transition metal ions by creating a four-coordinated (M–N4) square planar structure, which is regarded as the electrocatalytically active center. As a result, a porphyrin is frequently considered to be one of the best monomers to coordinate with metal ions and form a secondary structural unit, which can be assembled into POPs by interconnecting with other building units. In 2018, Ranjeesh et al. reported a bimetallic (Co and Ni) porphyrin 2D-sheet polymer (2DP3) via the condensation of metallated octahydroxyporphyrin and squaric acid (Fig. 3g and h).49 When used as a HER electrocatalyst, this metalloporphyrin based 2D-sheet exhibits excellent catalytic performance for H2 evolution with a faradaic efficiency of 97%, an overpotential of 105 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, and a Tafel slope of 74.1 mV dec−1. The enhanced HER performance mostly profits from the polar porous structure and incorporation of Ni ions in the Co framework. On the one hand, the polar porous structure improves the availability of proton sources for active catalytic sites. On the other hand, doping with Ni ions might increase the conductivity and decrease the energy barrier for adsorption of active species. As previously reported, Co(II) is the catalytic center in a Co-porphyrin system, which undergoes a stepwise electron transfer associated with the reduction of Co(II) to Co(0) and subsequent proton transfer with the regeneration of Co(II) (Fig. 3i).52,53 In the case of Ni porphyrin, it favors a stepwise proton transfer–electron transfer route, in which the protonation probably proceeds from the Ni(I) state (Fig. 3j). It is assumed that an electron in the metal-based orbital can promote the proton transfer by offering a favorable electrostatic environment. The improved conductivity induced by Ni doping is also verified by the impedance measurement. Consequently, the incorporation of Ni in the Co framework has a positive effect on HER performance.
Another approach for the metalation of POPs is that the prepared POPs are metallized by reacting them with metal ions. For example, a Co-porphyrin-based covalent organic polymer (CoCOP) was developed through the Schiff base condensation reaction and subsequent coordination with Co(II) (Fig. S4, ESI†).50 By virtue of the efficient charge transfer from the Co porphyrin moiety (donor, D) to imine groups (acceptor, A), the frontier orbital energy of CoCOP is altered, resulting in a change in the binding energies of the intermediates. This change can facilitate the adsorption and desorption of reaction intermediates on/from CoCOP, thus enhancing the HER kinetics.


2.2.3 POPs with incorporated metal nanoparticles. 
Incorporation of metal nanoparticles in POPs is a feasible strategy to obtain efficient heterogeneous catalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability. Fang et al. reported an imidazolium-based POP modified on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface through silane chemistry and alkylation reaction of tetrakis[4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl]methane (IM) and 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (2BrB) (Fig. S5, ESI†).51 The modified electrode was then employed to load Pt nanoparticles (ca. 2.28 nm) via the reduction of PtCl62− on the electrode. Imidazolium-based POPs can prevent the agglomeration and loss of Pt nanoparticles, and also enable their good dispersion and stability. In addition, imidazolium units are favorable for electron transfer via π–π and/or cationic–π interactions. Hence, the modified electrode with Pt nanoparticles shows outstanding HER activity with a low overpotential of 56 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a long-term stability of 4000 cycles.

3. Oxygen evolution reaction
3.1 Fundamental principles of the OER
The OER is a complex four-electron transfer reaction and considered to be the rate-limiting step of electrochemical water splitting due to the high energy barrier for the breaking of the O–H bond and the formation of the O–O bond.54 Thus additional energy is required to conquer the kinetic barrier and drive the reaction, resulting in the actual potential for the OER greater than the theoretical potential (1.23 V). To date, the mechanism of the OER has not yet been fully confirmed, but a generally accepted mechanism of the OER process is involved with the adsorption and desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH) at active sites. In this case, the OER pathways can be described by eqn (7)–(14):55
In acidic medium: H2O + * → OH* + e− + H+(7) OH* → O* + e− + H+(8) O* + H2O → OOH* + e− + H+(9) OOH* → O2 + e− + H+(10)
In alkaline medium: OH− + * → OH* + e−(11) OH* + OH− → O* + H2O + e−(12) O* + OH− → OOH* + e−(13) OOH* + OH− → O2 + H2O + e−(14)where * indicates the active site on the catalyst surface.
Since acid is more corrosive to electrodes and electrolyzers, alkaline electrolytes are commonly used in industry. In an alkaline environment, OH− is first adsorbed on the active sites of the surface, and OH* is formed after losing an electron (eqn (11)). OH* then reacts with OH− in the solution to generate the oxygen-containing intermediate O* according to eqn (12). O* further reacts with OH− to form another oxygen-containing intermediate OOH*, as shown in eqn (13). Finally, OOH* combines with OH− to produce and releases O2 together with exposure of the active site according to eqn (14). From the above reaction process, it can be seen that the OER is a multi-step single-electron transfer reaction. Each step of the reaction needs to overcome a certain energy barrier, resulting in a large overpotential for the OER due to the accumulation of multi-step energy barriers. An efficient catalyst is the key to overcoming energy barriers and improving the reaction efficiency of the OER. Generally, a good OER catalyst should have high catalytic activity (usually described as a low overpotential, a small Tafel slope), good conductivity, and long-term stability under severe working conditions.
3.2 POP-based catalysts for the OER
POPs as OER catalysts can be divided into four categories: metal-free POPs, metallized POPs, metal-based materials incorporated in POPs, and POPs combined with conductive carbon materials (Table 2).

3.2.1 Metal-free POPs. 
The electrocatalytic activity of metal-free POPs is mainly affected by the heteroatoms that they contain. Incorporation of N atoms into POP structures is a conventional strategy to create active sites in POPs due to the uneven charge distribution of adjacent C sites induced by N doping.57 Zhang and co-workers investigated the OER activity of three POPs with different C:N stoichiometries.57 COF-C4N, h-C2N, and h-C5N2 were synthesized by reacting hexaketocyclohexane octahydrate with 2,3,6,7,10,11-triphenylenehexamine, hexaaminobenzene trihydrochloride, and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride, respectively (Fig. 4a). As compared with h-C2N and h-C5N2, COF-C4N exhibits the most enhanced performance for the OER with an overpotential of 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec−1. The high activity of COF-C4N can be attributed to the ordered crystal structure and the appropriate band gap, which facilitates the creation of C active species around N atoms. A theoretically optimized periodic COF-C4N monolayer was built and four C sites on the COF-C4N surface were selected to gain insight into the specific catalytic sites (Fig. 4b). As shown in Fig. 4c, the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum are contributed by the 2p orbitals from N and C atoms, respectively. This means that when charge carriers are generated, the holes are largely concentrated on C atoms, while electrons are mainly distributed on N atoms. Thus the holes will be transferred from C to N atoms, and the electrons will be transferred from N to C atoms. The results in terms of density of states and wave functions indicate that C4 sites show easier hole and electron transfer. The calculated OER pathway for C4 sites also declares a lower overpotential, implying that C4 sites are potential catalytic sites for the OER (Fig. 4d).

3.2.2 Metallized POPs. 
DFT calculations have shown that the adsorption free energies of metalloporphyrin frameworks (metals like Co, Rh, and Ir) for reaction intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH) are close to those of ideal catalysts, implying that metalloporphyrin frameworks may have low overpotentials for the OER and ORR.73 Therefore, various metallic porphyrin based POPs have been developed to be applied as OER catalysts through building block metalation for porphyrin monomers or post-modification of metal ions for porphyrin-based POPs.58,59 In order to enhance the electron transfer of the whole framework, metalloporphyrin moieties are frequently reacted with highly conjugated linkers to construct large π-conjugated structures.60,61 For example, a Co(II)-porphyrin/pyrene-based CMP (Co-MPPy-1) (Fig. S6, ESI†) synthesized via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction exhibits excellent OER performance in alkaline medium with an overpotential of 420 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a long recyclability of 1000 cycles.61 This superior electrocatalytic activity mostly profits from the abundant Co(II) centers on porphyrin units and efficient charge transport in the π-conducting conjugated network. As known from the optimized molecular fragment of Co-MPPy-1, Co(II)-porphyrin units have the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and pyrene units have the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO); thus charge separation is favorable in Co-MPPy-1 from Co(II)-porphyrin (D) to pyrene (A). This D–A architecture can promote charge carrier mobility and further enhance the reaction kinetics of the OER.
Phthalocyanines are macrocyclic molecules similar to porphyrins and also possess rigid N4-coordination sites for metal ions. Metallophthalocyanines therefore have been explored as catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions.62,63 In 2018, Maji and co-workers reported a Co(II)-phthalocyanine-based CMP (CoCMP) as an efficient catalyst for the OER synthesized by the Schiff base reaction between Co(II)-phthalocyanine tetraamine and 4,4′-(2,5-bis(pentyloxy)-1,4-phenylene)bis(ethyne-2,1-diyl)dibenzaldehyde (OPE-5) (Fig. 5a).62 DFT results show that the HOMO is located on the Co(II)-phthalocyanine unit and the LUMO is situated on OPE-5, indicating that CoCMP is a D–A charge separated system, which is positive for electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the path of electron transport is from the HOMO of OH− to the LUMO of CoCMP in terms of DFT calculation. As a result, the convenient electron transport together with periodic catalytic sites and permanent porosity allows CoCMP to display an onset overpotential of 340 mV and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec−1. Bimetallic phthalocyanine-based POPs are also developed to investigate their electrocatalytic activity for the OER. For example, a Ni/Fe-based bimetallic polymer of Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP was prepared through Sonagashira–Hagihara coupling of Ni[phthalocyanine(ethynyl)4] and Fe[phthalocyanine(I)4] (Fig. S7, ESI†).63 In Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP, the electronic interaction between adjacent Ni and Fe atoms can enhance the oxidation of Ni/Fe to a higher valence state. It is generally believed that transition metal centers with high valence states can promote the generation of OOH* and the further oxidation of OOH* to O2. Hence Fe0.5Ni0.5Pc-CP shows a low overpotential of 317 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 toward the OER.

In addition to porphyrins or phthalocyanines, other organic groups (e.g., azo nitrogen, bipyridine nitrogen, salen moiety) can also coordinate transition metal ions to achieve the metalation of POPs. Maji and co-workers prepared an azo-functionalized POP (NDI–PG) through the diazo coupling of naphthalene diimide (NDI) and phloroglucinol.64 In NDI–PG, an azo nitrogen from NDI and an adjacent phenolic oxygen atom can coordinate Co ions to form a Co(II) coordinated polymer (CoII–NDI–PG) (Fig. 5b). The redox active NDI facilitates the delocalization of π electrons, which contributes to the uninterrupted charge transfer and further improves the reaction kinetics of the OER. When CoII–NDI–PG was used as a catalyst for the OER, a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec−1 can be obtained in 0.1 M KOH. The bipyridine group is also a good coordination group for transition metal ions. In 2016, Aiyappa et al. reported an OER catalyst of a bipyridine-containing COF (TpBpy) modified with Co(II) ions (Fig. 5c).65 The as-prepared Co-TpBpy shows excellent stability for the OER with the activity tests of 1000 cycles and 24 h in phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7). To improve the diffusion limitations of microporous COFs, a macro–microporous COF with bipyridine groups (macro-TpBpy) was synthesized via a template-assisted method by using polystyrene spheres (PSs) as hard templates (Fig. 6a).66 After the coordination with Co(II), the resulting macro-TpBpy-Co exhibits an improved OER performance with a competitive overpotential of 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 as compared with microporous COFs. The salen moiety is another coordinating group with metal ions to form salen–metal complexes for electrocatalytic applications. For example, a salen-CMP-Fe catalyst for the OER was prepared by the Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction of tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)methane (TEPM) with salen-Br monomers and followed by metalation with Fe(III) (Fig. 6b).67 Salen-CMP-Fe shows a low overpotential of 238 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec−1 for the OER. The enhanced OER activity is primarily due to the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Fe-salen moiety, the porous property of the whole framework, and the D–A charge-separated system, in which the Fe-salen moiety is the donor and the CMP backbone is the acceptor.

Electrostatic interaction is another method for the metalation of POPs. Luo and co-workers first synthesized a COF-SO3H via the Schiff base reaction of 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol with 2,5-diaminobenzenesulfonic acid (Fig. S8, ESI†).68 COF-SO3H was then treated with concentrated ammonia solution to obtain ammoniated COF-SO3H (NH4@COF-SO3), which was further immersed into a solution of NiCl2 and FeSO4, resulting in metal-ion-incorporating NixFe1−x@COF-SO3via a simple cation-exchange process between NH4+ and Ni(II) as well as Fe(II). Thereinto, Ni0.5Fe0.5@COF-SO3 shows a high metal-atom utilization efficiency with a turnover frequency value of 0.14 s−1 at an overpotential of 300 mV. Furthermore, Ni0.5Fe0.5@COF-SO3 only requires an overpotential of 308 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This overpotential is also lower than that of the commercial IrO2 benchmark (327 mV).


3.2.3 Metal-based materials incorporated in POPs. 
On account of the excellent OER performance of metal-based materials (e.g., metal nanoparticles, metal hydroxides), it is largely expected that incorporation of metal-based materials in POP supports can achieve high electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials and high stability by limiting the size and distribution of metal-based materials. In 2019, Maji and co-workers reported a redox active POP (TAPA-PG) synthesized by the Schiff base reaction of 4,4′,4′′-triaminotriphenylamine (TAPA, donor) with 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (PG, acceptor).69 TAPA-PG can reduce Co(II) to Co(0) in situ under ambient conditions, resulting in a cobalt nanoparticle-stabilized polymer (Co@TAPA-PG) (Fig. 6c). In the OER process, OH− first binds with Co(0) to form Co(II) and Co(III) species. It is expected that Co(III) species will be further oxidized to produce Co(IV)-oxyl species, finally leading to the release of O2. By using NaBH4 as the reductant, Mullangi et al. synthesized a nanocomposite containing a flexible COF support and CoxNiy(OH)2 nanoparticles with a size ≈2 nm.70 The flexibility of the COF enables the framework to wrap tightly on CoxNiy(OH)2 nanoparticles, where the COF can stabilize such small CoxNiy(OH)2 nanoparticles by means of the N-rich backbone. The obtained CoxNiy(OH)2-COF nanocomposite shows a double-layer capacitance of 0.40 mF cm−2 and the corresponding electrochemically active surface area of 4.7 cm−2, implying its potential electrocatalytic capability. Hence, the CoxNiy(OH)2-COF nanocomposite exhibits excellent activity and reaction kinetics for the OER with a low overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec−1.


3.2.4 POPs combined with conductive carbon materials. 
To achieve a high overall OER performance, POPs can be combined with conductive carbon materials by simple π–π stacking interactions. Du and co-workers used multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a template.71 The adsorbed Co-porphyrin (CoP) monomers on MWCNT surfaces were connected to each other through the Hay coupling reaction, forming a stable shell around the MWCNTs. By performing π–π stacking of different layers, the resulting polymer fragments were then stacked on the first layer, thereby forming a multilayer polymer shell around the MWCNTs (Fig. 6d). The obtained (CoP)n-MWCNTs shows an overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2. This overpotential is much lower than that of the physisorbed CoP/MWCNT hybrid (440 mV). Graphene is also applied as a conductive carbon substrate for POP growth. A composite of graphene and a pyrimidine-based POP with Ni(II) was prepared through the Sonagashira–Hagihara coupling reaction and post-synthetic impregnation with Ni(II) in the presence of graphene.72 This composite exhibits a low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec−1 for the OER due to the required electrical conductivity offered by graphene.

4. Oxygen reduction reaction
4.1 Fundamental principles of the ORR
The ORR is a key reaction in the electrode reactions of fuel cells and plays an important role in the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy. At present, the mechanism of the ORR is still not fully understood and there are different reaction paths and many extremely unstable intermediates (e.g., O*, OOH*, OH*, O22−, O2−, HO2−) in the reaction process, which are difficult to be directly detected.74,75 The entire process of the ORR is a complex multi-electron reaction process, which can be simply divided into two paths: 4e− transfer pathway and 2e− transfer pathway (Fig. 7a).76,77 In the 4e− pathway, O2 is finally reduced to H2O or OH− under acidic or alkaline media, respectively. Different from the 4e− pathway, O2 is first reduced to the adsorbed intermediate products H2O2 or HO2− under acidic or alkaline conditions during the 2e− pathway process. Subsequently, on the one hand, H2O2 or HO2− can continue to be reduced to H2O or OH−. On the other hand, H2O2 can also be desorbed from the catalyst and diffuse into water, and HO2− can be further reduced to H2O2 and also diffuse into water. Although the generation of H2O2 or HO2− is conducive to reducing the activation energy of the reaction, it is usually required to avoid H2O2 during the ORR owing to its strong corrosiveness. The generated H2O2 can destroy the active sites and further accelerate the decay and deactivation of the electrocatalysts. At the same time, H2O2 can also corrode the proton exchange membranes of the fuel cells, causing the perforation of the proton membranes and finally causing the short circuit of the fuel cells. In addition, the 2e− pathway can decrease the output voltage of the fuel cell due to its low theoretical potential (0.68 V) as compared with the 4e− pathway (1.23 V). The low output voltage will lead to a decrease in battery power. Therefore, the 4e− pathway is generally expected for the ORR in fuel cells. Nevertheless, on the other hand, if electrocatalysts possess high selectivity to H2O2, they might be able to produce H2O2 through electrochemical reduction of O2.
 Fig. 7  (a) A diagram of the reaction pathway for the ORR. (b) Three oxygen adsorption models – the Griffith model, Pauling model, and Yeager model (M represents the active site). 
According to the above reaction paths, the ORR process can be described by eqn (15)–(20):
In acidic medium: O2 + 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2O(15) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → H2O2(16) H2O2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2H2O(17)In alkaline medium: O2 + H2O + 4e− → 4OH−(18) O2 + H2O + 2e− → HO2− + OH−(19) HO2− + H2O + 2e− → 3OH−(20)
It is known that the electrocatalytic process of the ORR includes three steps: diffusion, adsorption, and surface reaction. Among them, the adsorption of oxygen-containing species on the catalyst surface is the key step of reaction kinetics and can often determine the reaction path of the ORR. It is believed that there are roughly three models to adsorb oxygen on the catalyst surface (Fig. 7b): the Griffith model of direct dissociative adsorption, the Pauling model of vertical adsorption, and the Yeager model of bridge adsorption.76 In general, an ideal catalyst should have the characteristics of high specific surface area to provide more active sites, a porous structure to accelerate mass transfer and diffusion, and appropriate binding energy for oxygen-containing species. If the adsorption is too weak, it will limit the transfer of electrons or protons to the adsorbed O2. In contrast, if the adsorption is too strong, it is not conducive to the desorption of reaction products, which may hinder the effective exposure of the active sites, thereby limiting the progress of the ORR. Thus, the development of ORR catalysts with desirable electronic structures and appropriate binding energy will improve reaction kinetics and increase the reaction selectivity, and further achieve high ORR activity.
4.2 POP-based catalysts for the ORR
The high specific surface area and porous structure of POPs can maximize the exposure of catalytically active sites, and their diverse building blocks allow adjustable chemical structures, leading to a suitable chemical reaction environment for the ORR. Furthermore, it is achievable to improve the ORR performance by creating an inherently conductive and electrochemically active structure and generating O2 binding sites in the porous structures of POPs. POP-based catalysts for the ORR generally include metal-free POPs, metallized POPs, and hybrids of POPs with metal-based materials (Table 3). Thereinto, conductive carbon materials are also added to obtain composite catalytic materials with both catalytic capability and carrier mobility by achieving the synergistic effect of the active centers and conductive supports.

4.2.1 Metal-free POPs. 
Generally, the ORR activity of metal-free POPs mainly originates from heteroatoms or functional groups, which can alter the local electronic environment of the neighbor atoms. N-containing POPs have been widely studied in electrocatalytic reactions, especially for the ORR.97,98 It is believed the incorporation of N atoms, especially pyridine N, may change the electron cloud density of neighbor C atoms and make C atoms carry positive charge, enhancing the adsorption of O2 and the reaction intermediates and thereby improving the catalytic activity for the ORR. CTFs are a class of porous covalent organic materials with high N percentages.97 The electron-donating property of the N atom induces the electron delocalization of its adjacent C atoms, which are the catalytically active site for the ORR by facilitating O–O bond cleavage. Unlike N atoms, the active catalytic centers of S-containing POPs are C–S regions.79,80 Chen and co-workers reported a one-dimensional nanohybrid of a carbon nanotube core and a thienothiophene–pyrene COF shell via an in situ wrapping method (Fig. S9, ESI†).80 DFT results indicate that the initial O2 adsorption first occurs on C atoms adjacent to S atoms in the thienothiophene moiety. Then the adsorbed O2 accepts a proton–electron pair to form an OOH* intermediate, which further diffuses to S atoms, proceeding via the following ORR pathway. Meanwhile, the bandgap and work function of the thienothiophene–pyrene COF are reduced by the effective charge transfer from carbon nanotubes, thereby decreasing the charge transfer barrier between C–S regions and oxygen-containing species, and significantly improving the catalytic activity. Li et al. found that H2O2 selectivity toward the 2e− pathway can be achieved by adjusting the charge states of N & S-containing POP frameworks.99 In addition, Li and co-workers confirmed that incorporating two S atoms into a porphyrin unit can effectively decrease the charge density of aza N and then facilitate the O* desorption process, thus reducing the overpotential of the porphyrin organic polymer for the ORR.81
An ionic covalent organic polymer (BPyTTzCOP:Br) was first prepared by the conjugation of viologen and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (Fig. 8a). The counter anion (Br−) in BPyTTzCOP:Br can be replaced with F−, Cl−, or I−via an ion exchange process, resulting in BPyTTz-COP:X (X = F, Cl, or I). The charge states of the polymer network are altered with the electronegativity of halide anions, leading to different *OOH binding energies, which vary with the electronegativity of halide anions (F > Cl > Br > I). A lower *OOH binding energy implies easier O–O bond dissociation, which tends to form H2O through a 4e− pathway and shows low selectivity toward H2O2. Thus, according to the electronegativity of X, the selectivity of BPyTTz-COP:X for H2O2 follows the order of F > Cl > Br > I. In addition to heteroatom incorporation, introducing functional substituents can also modulate the charge distribution of the carbon skeleton. DFT calculations indicate that electron-rich nitro-group substituents can change the charge density distribution of POPs effectively, endowing the adjacent carbon atoms with positive charge and POPs with better electron fluidity.100 In addition, introducing specific electrocatalytically active moieties into POPs is another method that allow the direct use of POP catalysts for the ORR. For instance, incorporating electron-poor naphthalene diimide units into COFs contributes to accepting electrons from oxygen.101

Reasonable structure design of metal-free POPs also enables improvement of the catalytic activity for the ORR. A polychlorotriphenylmethyl-based covalent organic radical framework (PTM-CORF) was prepared via the liquid/liquid interfacial acetylenic homocoupling of tri(4-ethynyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenyl)methane (Fig. 8b).82 The strong electron-withdrawing properties of PTM radicals and extended π-conjugation structure endow PTM-CORF with a low LUMO energy level, which is beneficial for accepting electrons from oxygen. In addition, PTM-CORF with a low HOMO–LUMO gap is favorable to the improvement of ORR activity due to its low kinetic stability. It is known that POPs with D–A structures generally exhibit easy charge transfer, which is beneficial to improving conductivity. Maji and co-workers proposed a design strategy to create electrochemically active CMPs by connecting D nodes and A spacers (Fig. S10, ESI†).83 Triphenylamine as a hole transporting unit was incorporated into CMPs due to its long lived charge separated states. Two semi-conducting metal-free CMPs with high conductivity were synthesized by the coupling reaction of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (D) with 1,1,2,2,-4,4′-diethynylbiphenyl (A) or tetrakis(4-ethynylphenyl)ethane (A). DFT calculations reveal that the N atom in triphenylamine is in a charge separated electropositive state and the O2 molecule binds to N sites in the Pauling model of vertical adsorption via N(2p)–O(2p) interaction. According to the experimental results, the researchers proposed two points for metal-free POPs to achieve ORR activity: (1) creating an inherently conductive and electrochemically active structure and (2) fabricating O2 binding sites in the porous structure. Afterwards, Maji and co-workers synthesized two amphipathic CMPs (TAPA-OPE-mix and TAPA-OPE-gly) by a microwave technique using 4,4′,4′′-triaminotriphenylamine (TAPA) and alkyl/alkoxy sidechain substituted oligo-(p-phenyleneethynylenes) (OPEs) as the monomers (Fig. 9a).84 The incorporation of amphiphilic (alkyl and alkoxy) sidechains promotes nanostructuring, which endows CMPs with more exposed catalytic surfaces. As compared with TAPA-OPE-mix, TAPA-OPE-gly shows more enhanced ORR catalytic activity by means of its more hydrophilic inner pores, which are favorable for the transfer of substrates to the catalytic centers.

4.2.2 Metallized POPs. 
Building block metalation and post-synthetic metalation are two common strategies to prepare metallized POPs. The post-synthetic metalation of POPs is generally achieved through cation exchange or coordination to introduce metal ions into the prepared POPs. Kamiya et al. reported a Pt-modified CTF hybridized with conductive carbon particles via Pt2+ absorption (Fig. S11, ESI†).102 As compared with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, the platinum-modified CTF is inactive for methanol oxidation and highly selective for the ORR in the presence of methanol, implying its potential application in direct methanol fuel cells. The high selectivity can be attributed to the single Pt catalytic site derived from Pt–N coordination bonds, while at least two Pt sites are required to oxidize methanol. Kamiya and co-workers then synthesized a copper-modified CTF for the ORR under neutral conditions in 2015 (Fig. S12, ESI†).85 The prepared copper-modified CTF exhibits an onset potential of 0.81 V (versus RHE) at neutral pH. The researchers found that the interaction between metal sites and oxygen-containing species largely lies on the vacancy in metal d orbitals. The unsaturated coordination of copper centers enables a strong interaction between Cu and O2 due to the accessible d orbitals and low steric hindrance, thereby promoting the O–O bond breaking.
Research studies on building block metalation mainly involve metallomacrocycle-based POPs, which are principally based on metalloporphyrin-, metallophthalocyanine-, and metallocorrole-based polymers. This is chiefly because the cavities of phthalocyanines, porphyrins, and corroles can coordinate various metal ions. The resulting catalytic center of M–N4 (where M is metal Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) is recognized as a potential replacement for noble metal catalysts. In addition, the macrocyclic structure can afford the same local coordination environment for metal ions and achieve precise control of M–N4 active sites at the atomic level, providing the possibility of investigating the catalytic mechanisms accurately. Furthermore, the catalytic ability of these metallomacrocycle-based POPs can also be enhanced by building electron transfer channels between active centers and electronic conductors (such as graphene and carbon nanotubes) through π-electron conjugation, van der Waals interaction, etc.
Porphyrins have an applicable coordination environment for metal ions to form M–N4 active sites after deprotonation. The highly conjugated structure enables electron mobility over the whole porphyrin structure and transport from the backbone to O2 molecule. Hence, various metalloporphyrin-based POPs have been developed to achieve expected catalysts for the ORR and further used as cathodes for Zn–air batteries.86,87,103,104 Xia and co-workers systematically studied the catalytic activity of metalloporphyrin-based COFs with 3d transition metals.18 They found that the catalytic reaction pathway largely relies on the types of transition metals, which can be briefly represented by the crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). When the CFSE value is relatively low, the ORR process can proceed along a 4e− pathway and show a low overpotential. According to the CFSE values, Fe–N4 and Co–N4 show optimal catalytic activity.
As compared with porphyrins, phthalocyanines display higher stability and conductivity owing to their fully closed-conjugated structures. A theoretical study first confirms the high efficiency of Fe-phthalocyanine (Fe-Pc) for the ORR by constructing the models of an Fe-Pc monolayer and an Fe-Pc molecule.105 DFT computations reveal that the ORR prefers to proceed along a 4e− pathway on the Fe-Pc monolayer. Though the energy for O2 reduction to OOH* is roughly the same for the Fe-Pc monolayer and Fe-Pc molecule, the Fe-Pc monolayer shows a higher stability than the Fe-Pc molecule under acidic conditions. The reason is that the Fe-Pc monolayer has a higher free energy change for the substitution of one Fe atom by two protons than the Fe-Pc molecule; thus the Fe-Pc monolayer is less likely to undergo demetallation. The superiority of metallophthalocyanine-based POPs for the ORR has also been proved by previous experimental results.88,106,107 A Co-polyphthalocyanine nanosheet catalyst exhibits an onset potential of 0.97 V and a half-wave potential of 0.81 V for the ORR, which are comparable to those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, indicating its potential application in alkaline fuel cells.89
The adjustment and optimization of metallophthalocyanine structures can be achieved by incorporating different substituents or metal ions. For instance, incorporation of acid anhydride substituents with different sizes can effectively enlarge the interlayer spacing of Co-phthalocyanine POPs by reducing π–π stacking due to the volume effect.90 The resulting CAN-Pc(Co)-p has a marginal interlayer distance of 5.1 Å (Fig. 9b and c), which can provide much exposed Co–N4 active sites. The enhanced active sites are confirmed by the electrochemical double-layer capacitances, which are mostly used to estimate the electrochemically active surface areas of electrocatalysts. Cyclic voltammetry tests indicate that CAN-Pc(Co)-p shows a relatively high double-layer capacitance (0.64 mF cm−2) as compared with CAN-Pc(Co)-o, -n, and -b, implying that CAN-Pc(Co)-p has a higher electrochemically active surface area than CAN-Pc(Co)-o, -n, and -b, and can expose more active sites. Hence, CAN-Pc(Co)-p exhibits an excellent performance for the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.85 V, which is superior to that of 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst (0.84 V). The mass activity of CAN-Pc(Co)-p (44 mA mgcat.−1) shows a 6.0-fold enhancement as compared with 20 wt% Pt/C. A bimetallic phthalocyanine-based POP of Fe0.5Co0.5Pc-CP reported by Jiang and co-workers shows higher ORR activity than homometallic analogues of FePc-CP and CoPc-CP.91 The interaction between the proximate Fe and Co ions provides a synergistic effect for catalytic reaction and enables a fast 2 × 2e− reaction pathway. DFT calculations reveal that O2 preferably adsorbs on the Co center in the initial reaction stage and H2O2 is generated as the resulting intermediate via a 2e− reduction pathway. Next, the catalytic reaction transfers from the Co center to Fe because of the obviously lower activation barrier for peroxide reduction. The whole ORR process is then completed after another 2e− reduction pathway on the Fe center. When Fe0.5Co0.5Pc-CP was exfoliated to ultrathin nanosheets and then hybridized with graphene, excellent ORR activity with an onset potential of 1.006 V and a half-wave potential of 0.927 V was achieved in 0.1 M KOH owing to its highly exposed active centers and good electron transfer capability.92 Jiang and co-workers further compared the ORR activity of metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines by constructing four mixed phthalocyanine-porphyrin-based CMPs (FePcZnPor-CMP, ZnPcFePor-CMP, FePcFePor-CMP, and ZnPcZnPor-CMP) (Fig. S13, ESI†).93 The result indicates that FePc-containing CMPs exhibit a better ORR performance than FePor-containing CMPs. The principal reason is that the FePc unit has a shorter Fe–N bond than the FePor unit, which provides a strong ligand field to stabilize Fe2+ species.
Corroles are also macrocyclic molecules similar to porphyrins, and consist of four pyrrole rings joined together by a straight pyrrole–pyrrole linkage and three methynes. Different from the dianionic structures of porphyrins and phthalocyanines, corroles provide a unique trianionic platform after deprotonation, which is conducive to chelating high-valent metal ions. In addition, the direct pyrrole–pyrrole connection endows corroles with a small cavity, thereby allowing the formation of short metal–N bonds after coordination with metal ions. It is known that the short metal–N bond shows strong bonding, which may afford a robust structure for the catalyst during the catalytic reaction. Friedman et al. synthesized a 3D Co-corrole polymeric structure through electropolymerization using a cobalt(III) complex of tris(4-aminophenyl)corrole (CoTAC) as the monomer.94 The electropolymerization process involves the loss of protons of aniline groups to form secondary or tertiary amines and the ortho position of the aminophenyl ring is the electropolymerization site (Fig. 9d). As compared with the monomeric catalyst CoTAC, the polymeric structure of polyCoTAC shows much better ORR activity with a lower overpotential and higher selectivity for the 4e− reduction pathway due to the synergistic activity of metallocorroles.


4.2.3 POPs with metal-based materials. 
The hybridization of POPs and metal-based materials is proved to be an effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by altering the electronic nature of the hybrid material and further achieving the synergistic effect. In the light of their high surface area and porous characteristics, POPs are considered to be ideal porous supports to stabilize active metal nanoparticles, which are normally hybridized with POPs through mixing or in situ reduction. For instance, a hybrid material of Pt and a N-rich COF prepared by growing Pt nanoparticles on the COF surface shows ultrahigh catalytic activity for the ORR in acidic medium.95 Multiple pyridinic N atoms act as the nucleation sites of Pt nanoparticles, which thus disperse uniformly and possess a narrow size distribution with an average diameter of 2.10 nm. The obtained Pt@COF hybrid catalyst displays a more positive onset potential of 1.05 V and a half-wave potential of 0.89 V versus RHE in comparison to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Maji and co-workers synthesized a Co-CMP composite by in situ growing Co nanoparticles in a redox-active D–A CMP based on tris-(4-aminophenyl)amine and perylenediimide.96 The as-synthesized Co-CMP with 2.56 wt% Co nanoparticles shows apparently improved activity for the ORR as compared with metal-free CMP. Both experimental data and DFT calculations indicate that the introduction of Co decreases the HOMO–LUMO gap of Co-CMP and improves the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the LUMO of O2 is 0.43 eV lower than the HOMO of Co-CMP, implying facile electron transfer from Co-CMP to O2 by virtue of its low electron transfer barrier.

5. CO2 reduction reaction
5.1 Fundamental principles of the CO2RR
The CO2RR is considered to be a feasible means to convert electrical energy into valuable fuels with high energy density in the form of chemical bonds, and is expected to be an effective strategy to decrease the CO2 content in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the CO2RR is still unclear, and there are also numerous obstacles that need to be overcome for the CO2RR, such as poor reaction selectivity, low energy efficiency, and low overall conversion rates.108 At present, the CO2RR is mainly carried out in liquid electrolyte, in which CO2 enters into the electrolyte solution to form a gas–liquid–solid three-phase reaction system. The reaction process of the CO2RR generally includes four steps: (l) CO2 molecules are chemically adsorbed on the catalyst surface; (2) protons and electrons are transferred to the adsorbed CO2 molecules, breaking CO bonds and forming C–H bonds; (3) the reaction intermediates are reduced by continuously accepting electrons or protons, and the adjacent intermediates may combine with each other and undergo configuration rearrangement to form the final products; and (4) product molecules desorb from the catalyst surface.109 The above process involves multiple electron–proton transfers, such as 2e−, 4e−, 6e−, 8e−, 12e−, 14e−, and 18e− reaction pathways; thus it is possible to produce many different kinds of carbon-based reduction products, including carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH) (HCOO−, basic medium), methanol (CH3OH), formaldehyde (HCHO), methane (CH4), oxalic acid (H2C2O4) (C2O42−, basic medium), ethylene (C2H4), ethanol (C2H5OH), ethane (C2H6), and n-propanol (C3H7OH) (Table 4).109,110 The specific electrochemical half-reactions of the CO2RR can be described by eqn (21)–(31) (all potentials are relative to the standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) at pH 7 in aqueous solution, and a side reaction of the HER also occurs during the CO2RR process, as shown in eqn (32).111

From the data in Table 4, it can be seen that the difference between the thermodynamic potentials required to form different products is small, leading to low selectivity for the specified product. According to the thermodynamic formula ΔG = −nFE0, the reaction becomes more and more difficult as the value of E0 gets smaller. In fact, the potential required to drive the reaction is more negative than the thermodynamic equilibrium potential in the actual CO2RR process. To date, it has been found that the products of the CO2RR are more inclined to forming CO and HCOOH, and the side reaction of reducing H+ to H2 also easily occurs during the actual CO2RR process. It is largely because the CO2RR process not only needs to overcome the thermodynamic barrier, but also has relevance to the reaction kinetics, involving the proton concentration and the electron transport rate, which are related to the electrocatalysts. Consequently, an efficient electrocatalyst for the CO2RR should easily absorb protons and transfer electrons quickly. Meanwhile, it also needs to relatively easily adsorb CO2 and reaction intermediates and desorb the reaction products. In addition, it is known that the electrocatalysts have determining impact on the product distribution and selectivity of the CO2RR. Therefore, the development and optimization of electrocatalysts are essential for achieving high efficiency and selectivity at low overpotentials for the CO2RR.
5.2 POP-based catalysts for the CO2RR
Although a variety of catalysts are thermodynamically feasible for the CO2RR, such as abundant metal based catalysts, these traditional monometallic catalysts tend to have high overpotentials, poor selectivity, and weak inhibition to the competitive reaction (HER). Therefore, exploring suitable catalysts with high selectivity and high efficiency is still a huge challenge for scientific researchers. Two approaches are mainly used to enhance the reaction selectivity and efficiency of the CO2RR process, including (1) exposing certain crystal lattice planes on metal electrodes and (2) incorporating catalytic sites into molecules and molecule-based materials, such as metal complexes and polymers.111,112 Thereinto, POPs carrying catalytic sites are found to be promising alternative catalysts in the CO2RR process for the following reasons: (1) various kinds of metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, Re) can be incorporated into POPs as catalytic sites; (2) POPs may afford more accessible catalytic sites by virtue of their high surface areas and porous structures as compared with other catalysts with higher density; and (3) multiple functionalities (e.g., CO2 enrichment, electron transmission) can be achieved by tuning the structures of POPs to promote the conversion efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR.113,114 At present, the reported POPs for the CO2RR generally involve metallized POPs by building block metalation or post-synthetic metalation and hybrid systems of POPs with conductive carbon materials or metal electrodes (Table 5). It is noted that the main product of the CO2RR is CO owing to the relatively easy 2e− transfer process.115 In this catalytic conversion process, a pair of proton and electron (H+/e−) is first transferred from the electrolyte to the adsorbed CO2 on the catalyst surface, forming the carboxyl intermediates of *COOH. Then, another pair of H+/e− attacks the hydroxyl oxygen atom of *COOH to produce H2O and *CO. H2O molecules first enter in the solution and *CO intermediates subsequently desorb from the catalyst surface. Nevertheless, the weak binding of *COOH and the strong binding force of *CO severely affect the conversion of CO2 to *COOH and the desorption of CO, respectively, leading to a high reaction potential, a low conversion rate, and poor selectivity. Thus, exploring suitable catalysts to optimize the binding energy of intermediates is an effective strategy to enhance the reaction efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR.

5.2.1 Metallized POPs. 
As mentioned above, metallized POPs are generally prepared through building block metalation or post-synthetic metalation. Building block metalation is primarily concerned with macrocyclic molecules (such as metalloporphyrin and metallophthalocyanine units). The specific molecular structures make these metal macrocyclic complexes ideal model systems for systematically studying the structure–activity correlation in the CO2RR. Chang and co-workers first studied the CO2RR performance of COF-366-Co and COF-367-Co, which were synthesized via the Schiff base condensation of [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphinato]cobalt [Co(TAP)] with 1,4-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (BDA) and biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxaldehyde (BPDA), respectively (Fig. 10a).116 Owing to the uniform arrangement of catalytic sites and conserved pore environment around the active centers, COF-367-Co exhibits a 26-fold increase in catalytic activity as compared with the molecular cobalt complex, displaying a high faradaic efficiency (90%) at −0.67 V versus RHE and maintaining for a period of 24 h (Fig. 10b and c). The better catalytic performance of COF-367-Co as compared with COF-366-Co can be attributed to the more accessible metalloporphyrin moieties due to its larger pores. This study gives rise to the design of hybrid molecular materials for a broader range of catalytic applications by integrating the merits of both molecular and heterogeneous systems.

In 2018, Chang and co-workers further tuned the electronic character of metalloporphyrin moieties by introducing different electron-withdrawing groups on BDA linkers and investigated the CO2RR performance of the obtained COF-366-Co, COF-366-(OMe)2-Co, COF-366-F-Co, and COF-366-(F)4-Co (Fig. 11a).117 According to the catalytic mechanism, the Co(II) center of the metalloporphyrin moiety is first reduced to Co(I) after capturing one electron (Fig. 11b). Co(I) then serves as the active site to activate and reduce the adsorbed CO2 molecules to generate a *COOH intermediate by combining with a H+. *COOH further combines with another pair of H+/e− to form a H2O molecule and a *CO intermediate. Afterwards, *CO removes from the catalyst surface to form CO, accompanied by the regeneration of the Co(II) center. From this mechanism, it is clear that facilitating the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) can possibly contribute to the improvement of CO2RR performance. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on linkers can take away electron density from the Co(II) center and further promote the reduction of Co(II). As a result, COF-366-F-Co shows a low overpotential of 550 mV and a faradaic efficiency of 87% for CO due to the strong electron-attracting ability. This work reveals the direct relationship between electronic structure and function for COF catalysts.

Recently, Lan and co-workers built an oriented electron transport pathway in metalloporphyrin–tetrathiafulvalene based COFs (M-TTCOFs) (Fig. S14, ESI†) to enhance the electron mobility and further improve the CO2RR performance by incorporating the electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF).113 When TTF is coupled with the electron acceptor metalloporphyrin, the electron transfer efficiency of the obtained M-TTCOFs is largely enhanced by building an intermolecular charge-transfer pathway. Thus, the as-prepared Co-TTCOF exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of 91.3% for CO at −0.7 V and a remarkable cycling stability of more than 40 h. In addition to the Co(II) center, metalloporphyrin moieties containing other metal ions have also been explored for the CO2RR. For example, a Ni porphyrin-based CTF synthesized by an ionothermal approach shows high selectivity for the CO product with a faradaic efficiency of 97% at −0.9 V.118 DFT calculation indicates that the Ni porphyrin-based CTF structure is quite effective in decreasing the kinetic energy barrier for the adsorbed CO2 transition to *COOH on the Ni–N4 site, thus improving the CO2RR performance. Kubiak and co-workers found an Fe(III) porphyrin COF thin film synthesized by a solvent-free method from 5,10,15,20-tetra-(4-aminophenyl)-porphyrin Fe(III) chloride (FeTAPPCl) and 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalaldehyde (Dha) could reduce CO2 to CO with an average faradaic efficiency of 80% at −2.2 V (versus Ag/AgCl) in MeCN solvent.124
Metalloporphyrin moieties can also be incorporated into POPs through non-bonding interaction. For instance, encapsulation of Co porphyrin derivative molecules of cobalt meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (CoTCPP) into a cationic POP via electrostatic attraction can achieve the synergistic action to promote the CO2RR.119 The obtained cationic POP containing anionic Co porphyrin moieties exhibits a faradaic efficiency of 83% at −0.6 V versus RHE and a per-site TOF of 1.4 s−1. In situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy measurement reveals the interaction between the intermediates (e.g., *COOH, *CO) and pyridyl rings, implying that the positive charge density of the surrounding POP backbone makes it easier for *CO to get desorbed from active sites.
Another common class of macrocyclic molecules is metallophthalocyanines. In the metallophthalocyanine unit, the 3d orbital of the metal ion strongly resonates with the 2p orbitals of the four nearest N atoms and simultaneously forms a weak resonance with the second nearest N atoms, which endow the metallophthalocyanine with the strengthened crystal field and 3d orbital split as compared to the metalloporphyrin unit.124,125 The unique crystal field allows metallophthalocyanines to stabilize the intermediates via strong binding, thereby decreasing the energy barrier of the CO2RR. Meanwhile, by combining the CO2 storage capacity, the phthalocyanine boronate COF (Co-Pc-PBBA) (Fig. S15, ESI†) constituted by Co-phthalocyanine and boronic acid shows a significant improvement in overpotential and reaction rate by passing CO2 gas through the Co-Pc-PBBA layer before entering electrolyte.125 As compared with the performance in a normal aqueous environment, the overpotential decreases from 390 to 270 mV and the reaction rate increases by 97.7 times owing to the higher CO2 concentration around the catalytic centers. Recently, Jiang and co-workers developed a stable and conductive phenazine-linked Co-phthalocyanine COF (CoPcPDQ-COF) using cobalt(II) 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octakis(amino)phthalocyanine ([NH2]8CoPc) and 4,5,9,10-pyrenediquinone as monomers (Fig. S16, ESI†).120 CoPcPDQ-COF not only possesses π conjugation along the x and y axes but also achieves π conduction along the z direction across the π columns, implying a fully π-conjugated lattice for CoPcPDQ-COF. This structural feature endows CoPcPDQ-COF with a combination of conductivity, durability, and catalytic activity. As a result, CoPcPDQ-COF exhibits a high faradaic efficiency of 96% for CO at −0.66 V versus RHE and a long-term TOF of 3.17 s−1, which is 32-fold as high as that of [NH2]8CoPc molecules.
Post-synthetic metalation is also a common strategy to obtain metallized POPs. In general, these POPs usually contain functional groups that can interact with metal ions, such as bipyridine or porphyrin units,126,127 facilitating the subsequent metal ion modification. The modified metal ions can be either ordinary transition metal ions or precious metal ions. For instance, when the bipyridine-containing COF or CMP underwent a simple post-treatment by soaking COFs or CMPs in Re(CO)5Cl or Mn(CO)5Br solution, Re or Mn could be modified in the porous framework of COFs (Fig. S17, ESI†) or CMPs (Fig. S18, ESI†) and further used as the catalytic site for the CO2RR.121,126


5.2.2 POP-based hybrid systems. 
In order to achieve a high overall performance, incorporating POPs into some supporting materials to construct POP-based hybrid systems is expected to overcome the drawbacks of POPs and obtain the synergistic effect of both POPs and supporting materials. Since POPs usually have poor electronic conductivity, graphene or carbon nanotube substrates are generally incorporated with POPs to enhance the electron transfer capability of the composite systems. For instance, a pyrimidine-containing POP (PyPOP) (Fig. S19, ESI†) deposited on graphene sheets exhibits an improved electrochemical activity toward the CO2RR.128 This PyPOP could also be feasibly coated on MWCNTs to afford a PyPOP–MWCNT composite, which shows pronounced affinity to CO2 and enhanced catalytic activity as compared with PyPOP and MWCNTs.129 In addition, to enhance the penetration ability of CO2, electrochemical polymerization has been employed to prepare binder-free catalyst films. Luangchaiyaporn et al. developed a bithiophenyl-substituted Co-phthalocyanine POP (p(CoPc-1)) film on carbon paper through the electropolymerization of 2,9,16,23-tetra([2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)phthalocyaninato-cobalt(II) (Fig. S20, ESI†).122 This composite system of p(CoPc-1)-modified carbon paper exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity for the CO2RR with a faradaic efficiency of 94% for CO at −0.66 V versus RHE, implying that electropolymerization may be a promising approach to afford effective catalysts for the CO2RR.
Another approach to improve the reaction efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR is to decorate metal electrodes with POPs. In this respect, Deng and co-workers have studied the CO2RR performances of two composite systems by depositing POPs on Ag and Au electrodes.112,123 As illustrated in Fig. 11c, they first synthesized a 3D COF of COF-300 and further reduced the imine linkages in COF-300 to amine linkages, thereby greatly enhancing the chemical stability in acids and bases.123 The obtained COF-300-AR (where AR means after reduction) was deposited homogeneously on a Ag electrode and applied to catalyze the CO2RR. In the CO2RR process, CO2 molecules are concentrated in the COF-300-AR framework and activated by the amine functional groups to form carbamates, which are in favor of the conversion of CO2 on the Ag surface (Fig. 11d). Then electrons are directly transferred from the Ag electrode to CO2 molecules and carbamates are converted into CO molecules and OH− with the assistance of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, amine functional groups are regenerated and participate in the next catalytic cycle. This concerted manner of COF-300-AR and the Ag electrode effectively improves the CO2 conversion efficiency. In addition, the researchers fabricated another composite system by electropolymerization of tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin on a Au electrode surface.112 Benefiting from the abundant amino functional groups and Au atoms on the interface, the resulting composite system shows an excellent catalytic performance for the CO2RR with a high faradaic efficiency of 95% for CO at −0.7 V versus RHE.

6. Other reactions
Besides the above-mentioned HER, OER, ORR, and CO2RR, POPs are also applied as catalysts for many other electrocatalytic reactions, such as N2 reduction, hydrogen oxidation, nitrate/nitrite reduction, nitrobenzene reduction, and benzyl alcohol oxidation (Table 6). All these electrocatalytic reactions play important roles in the efficient use of clean energy and alleviation of environmental pollution, mainly including the areas of the agrochemical industry, hydrogen fuel cells, water purification, hazardous waste treatment, and the pharmaceutical industry. For example, ammonia (NH3) is an efficient energy carrier and hydrogen storage medium and the most important chemical for the production of chemical fertilizers in the agrochemical industry. As compared to the traditional Haber–Bosch process of NH3 production, converting N2 to NH3 by electrochemical reduction is considered to be a promising alternative to the Haber–Bosch strategy owing to its mild reaction conditions and obvious advantages in energy conservation and environmental protection. Yan and co-workers demonstrated that a boron-rich COF (Fig. S21, ESI†) shows highly efficient activity for N2 reduction with a faradaic efficiency of 45.43%.130 The high activity is attributed to plentiful B sites, which facilitate N2 (a weak Lewis base) adsorption in the COF due to their strong Lewis acidity. DFT calculations indicate that the energy barrier of N2 dissociation on B sites is greatly decreased by virtue of the superior COF electronic structure at a suitable potential. Meanwhile, the collision probability between B sites and N2 molecules is effectively enhanced because of the localized high N2 concentration, thereby improving the reaction activity. In addition, on the basis of DFT calculations, Su and co-workers proposed a conductive Mo-COF (Fig. S22, ESI†) constructed from 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octaamino-metallophthalocyanine and pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone could be an efficient catalyst for N2 reduction with a low overpotential of 0.16 V and a high faradaic efficiency (close to 100%).131 The outstanding activity is mainly due to the large positive charge and spin moment of the Mo center and appropriate adsorption strength for reaction species.

Generally, metal-based materials, especially noble-metal-based materials, are superior catalysts for numerous electrocatalytic reactions. However, the extensive application of these metal-based materials faces the challenges of high cost, limited abundance, and environmental issues. To achieve economic catalysts, incorporating metal-based materials into environmentally friendly support materials is a promising approach to decrease the loading amount of metals. POPs with tunable porosity and high chemical stability provide a desirable platform to load metal-based materials. Thereinto, CTFs are being widely employed as support materials to load various metals because of abundant nitrogen atoms in CTFs, which can form coordination bonds with metals. Hence, CTFs modified with different metal species have been developed to achieve specific catalytic functions for different electrocatalytic reactions.
Loading noble metals into CTFs can minimize their use by atomically dispersing noble metals in polymer frameworks. For example, a Pt-modified CTF (Pt-CTF) with conductive carbon black (only a loading of 0.29 wt% Pt) shows high hydrogen oxidation activity comparable to that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst.132 Notably, as compared with 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, Pt-CTF shows lower cathodic ORR activity owing to the abundance of atomically dispersed Pt. Higher hydrogen oxidation activity and lower ORR activity are of great significance for catalysts in limiting cathode degradation during start-up/shut-down cycles of fuel cells. Moreover, Pt-CTF can efficiently catalyze the decomposition of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) molecules, whereas it exhibits low activity for nitrate reduction.133 In contrast, bulk Pt shows high activity for both nitrite and nitrate reduction. The high selectivity of Pt-CTF for nitrite reduction is probably because nitrate ions adopt an adsorption manner of the monodentate form on single Pt atoms owing to the absence of adjacent Pt sites. This monodentate configuration leads to weak adsorption strength with low adsorption energy, which is too weak to activate nitrate ions. Besides Pt, other noble metals like Ru can also be incorporated into CTFs. Nakanishi and co-workers reported a Ru-modified CTF (Ru-CTF), which shows high selectivity for the electrochemical oxidation of benzyl alcohol in aqueous electrolyte solution over the OER.134 Considering that oxidizing water to O2 for the OER involves at least two adjacent Ru sites, single Ru–oxo species formed on one unsaturated Ru coordination site is the active species for the hydrocarbon oxidation reaction. In addition, another method to incorporate active sites into CTFs is electrostatic assembly. Hu and co-workers incorporated a molecular polyoxometalate catalyst (H5PMo10V2O40) into a cationic CTF (Fig. S23, ESI†) through electrostatic interaction.135 The resulting PMo10V2@CTF also shows outstanding activity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol with a high conversion of 99%, a high selectivity of 99%, and a faradaic efficiency of 96% for benzyl aldehyde.
Meanwhile, non-noble metals have also been encapsulated into CTFs for electrocatalytic application due to their low cost. For example, a Cu-modified CTF was found to show efficient activity for reduction of nitrate to nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a pivotal intermediate for the generation of harmless N2 (denitrification).136 The atomically dispersed Cu in Cu-CTF allows Cu atoms to maintain unsaturated coordination structures, which can provide more accessible d orbitals and have small steric hindrance for adsorbates. Thus, Cu-CTF shows a moderate binding strength for NO, which can promote the formation of N2O by reacting solvated NO with surface-bound NO, resulting in a selective catalytic reduction. On this basis, Nakanishi and co-workers developed a local cell catalytic unit to electrochemically reduce nitrate to N2O with H2 by loading Pt-CTF and Cu-CTF onto the same conductive substrate.137 In this local cell, Pt-CTF selectively catalyzes the hydrogen oxidation reaction, and Cu-CTF selectively reduces NO3− to N2O, implying that the selective catalytic reactions can proceed in a hybrid system. In addition, Cu-CTF was also applied to electrochemically reduce nitrobenzene by Nakanishi and co-workers.138 The researchers proposed a cooperative electrocatalytic process, in which CTF itself reduces nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine and single-atom Cu sites further reduce phenylhydroxylamine to aniline.
7. Conclusions and perspectives
POP-based materials have been applied as promising catalysts for numerous electrocatalytic reactions because of their high surface areas, designable and tailorable structures, diverse organic linkers, adjustable functionality, and high stability. We have summarized the recent developments of POP-based catalysts for electrocatalytic applications including the HER, OER, ORR, CO2RR, N2 reduction reaction, nitrate/nitrite reduction reaction, nitrobenzene reduction reaction, hydrogen oxidation reaction, and benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. It has been apparent that the high surface areas enable POPs to expose more accessible active sites and increase the electrochemically active surface areas. The porous structures endow POPs with favorable mass transfer and the ability to enrich the reactant in the pores and thus accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction rate. Meanwhile, the high stability allows POPs to be employed in electrocatalytic reactions with diverse media. In addition, as compared to POPs after thermal decomposition, pyrolysis-free POPs not only retain the catalytic performance of POPs themselves, but also have precise and controllable material structures, which provide clear models to study the active sites, and structure–activity relationships as well as fundamental mechanisms. In particular, it is relatively easy to design energy storage and conversion devices according to the characteristics of electrocatalysts because high temperature treatment is avoided during the syntheses of POPs. As a result, major advances have been made in design and application of pyrolysis-free POPs for electrocatalytic reactions.
Generally, POPs for electrocatalytic reactions involved in this review can be divided into three types: (1) metal-free POPs, (2) metallized POPs, and (3) POP-based hybrid systems. In the first type, various heteroatoms (e.g., B, N, O, S, F) and different functional substituent groups (e.g., electron-withdrawing/donating groups, hydrophilic/hydrophobic groups) are incorporated into POPs in the skeleton or as side chains. The heteroatoms in POPs can be used as active sites and also adjust the electrical properties of neighboring atoms to make them more favorable to electrocatalytic reactions. Introduction of substituent groups can change the local electronic structures and create a more favorable reaction environment. In addition, POPs with fully conjugated structures or D–A structures are also designed and constructed to enhance the electron transfer of the whole frameworks by selecting appropriate linkers. For the second type, the strategies of building block metalation and post-synthetic metalation are generally applied to prepare metallized POPs. Macrocyclic molecules (such as metalloporphyrins, metallophthalocyanines, and metallocorroles) are generally used to construct metallized POPs by building block metalation. Post-synthetic metalation is mainly applicable to POPs with chelating groups (e.g., bipyridine groups). Both noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ru, Re) and non-noble metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mn) are incorporated into POPs as catalytic centers. Introducing metals into POPs via coordination interaction can greatly reduce the dosage of metals and obtain atomically dispersed metals, which are critical to achieve the high selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions. For the third type, POPs are generally integrated with metal-based nanoparticles (e.g., Pt nanoparticles, Co nanoparticles), conductive carbon materials (e.g., carbon black, graphene, carbon nanotubes), and metal electrodes (e.g., Au, Ag). Using POPs as supports for metal-based nanoparticles can improve the stability and dispersion of nanoparticles, thereby increasing the exposure of the active surface and inhibiting the agglomeration of nanoparticles. The effective combination of POPs and conductive carbon materials, on the one hand, can improve the overall conductivity of the hybrid system to promote electron transfer. On the other hand, the synergistic effect between POPs and carbon materials can change the adsorption performance of key reaction intermediates, resulting in the improvement of catalytic activity and long-term stability. Depositing POPs on metal electrodes can greatly increase the selectivity of electrochemical reactions by building a molecularly defined interface. In addition, POP-based hybrid systems can also be obtained via electrostatic interaction using anionic/cationic POPs and charged active moieties (e.g., metal cations, polyoxometalate anions) as ingredients.
Although reasonable design and fine synthesis allow POPs to achieve certain progress in numerous electrocatalytic reactions, the practical and extensive applications of POPs in electrocatalytic reactions still face many difficulties and challenges. According to the existing literature, we would like to put forward our perspectives on the key challenges and the corresponding feasible research directions in the future.
(1) Rational design and efficient synthesis are the most pivotal factors of POPs for electrocatalytic applications by determining their electrocatalytic performances and large-scale preparation. It is known that most of the POPs suffer from complex monomer synthesis and high cost, which seriously limit their wide range of electrocatalytic applications. In this case, developing low-cost monomers and exploring new synthetic strategies as well as improving existing synthetic methods are greatly urgent to achieve economical and high-efficiency large-scale production. Meanwhile, in addition to POPs in their powdery form prepared by the traditional solvothermal method, developing POP films or free-standing POP electrodes constructed by electropolymerization or in situ synthesis is of practical importance to simplify the assembly of catalytic devices. Notably, the extensive electrocatalytic application of POPs is also restricted by their low conductivity, which is crucial for electron transfer. To enhance the conductivity, constructing fully conjugated structures and ideal hybrid systems of POPs on conductive substrates is necessary to achieve fast electron transfer and synergistic effects. Developing POPs with highly stable bonds and exploring new preparation paths are also required to obtain robust frameworks for harsh environments, thereby increasing their long-term stability. Furthermore, metallized POPs and POP-based hybrid systems may face the drop-off of metal ions and the separation of hybrid species. The strong interaction or binding force is proposed for these systems. In addition, more attention should also be paid to incorporating active sites and designing pore geometry, which are distinctly important for the catalytic activity and mass transportation. Thus, it is urgent to further enrich the strategies of heteroatom doping, metal ion modification, and functional group substitution to regulate the electronic configuration of POPs by incorporating diverse structural moieties, thereby improving the intrinsic activity of POPs.
(2) The mechanisms of POPs for many electrocatalytic reactions have not yet been deeply understood and are still in the initial stage due to their complex electrochemical processes. Although the DFT calculations provide valuable references for understanding the electrocatalytic mechanisms of POPs, the desirable correlation between theory and experimental results has not yet been established. It is still difficult to accurately predict the performance of a specific POP based on theoretical research alone. Moreover, the study of electrocatalytic mechanisms should also afford reasonable theoretical guidance for the design of new POP electrocatalysts. Therefore, developing efficient tracking and monitoring methods and characterization techniques is extremely necessary to investigate intermediate species and verify active sites and reaction pathways. The resulting authentic combination of experimental design and theoretical analysis is expected to virtually guide the electrocatalytic research studies of POPs.
(3) It is also challenging to evaluate and compare the catalytic performances of different POPs because of the diverse reaction systems and reaction conditions in the literature. So far, there have been no uniform and normative standards for electrocatalytic measurements. The catalytic performances of POPs are greatly affected by the electrocatalyst loading, electrode preparation method, electrolyte, and other factors involved in electrocatalytic processes. It is relatively difficult to truly and fairly evaluate the catalytic performances of different POPs and affirm which one is better. In such situations, researchers should provide as much test data as possible, including electrocatalyst loading, electrode area, the overpotential, the Tafel slope, stability, exchange current density, faradaic efficiency, and turnover frequency. More importantly, particular effort should be devoted towards developing standardized test methods and establishing a unified evaluation system in future research studies.
In summary, POPs have achieved considerable progress in electrocatalytic research studies because of their unique characteristics. Though challenges to their wide application undoubtedly exist, it is believed that POPs offer great opportunities for the rapid development of electrocatalytic research through sustained research effort.
