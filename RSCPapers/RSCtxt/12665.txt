    , Accepted 16th June 2020First published on 17th June 2020AbstractTo investigate the effect of bridge atoms on the properties of non-fullerene acceptors, we designed two analogues by changing only one atom and report the first germanium based non-fullerene acceptor GDIC-C8. Compared to its analogue IDIC-C8, altering the bridge atom from carbon to germanium dramatically leads to a more planar molecular geometry. GDIC-C8 tends to form a 1D lamellar/slip-stack packing while IDIC-C8 represents a reticular motif packing in a single crystal. This unique structure greatly enhances the crystallinity of GDIC-C8 in single crystal and neat films, evidenced by X-ray single crystal diffraction and atomic force microscopy measurements. However, GDIC-C8 prefers to form edge-on π–π stacking when blended with a donor polymer PM6. In addition, the extremely high crystallinity of GDIC-C8 restrains competitively the crystallization of PM6 in the blend film. These features lead to an inferior photovoltaic performance of GDIC-C8 compared to IDIC-C8. This work systematically studies the effect of bridge atoms on molecular geometry and packing and reveals the importance of the bridge atom in the fused-ring semiconductors for the modulation of optoelectronic properties and device performance.
Introduction
In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the development of novel conjugated materials for application in organic solar cells (OSCs). One promising class of materials is a non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) with an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture, wherein two electron-deficient moieties, such as indene malononitrile and rhodanine, flank an electron-rich aromatic core.1–5 The core is typically an aromatic fused-ring, in which thiophene or benzene units are forced to be coplanar and fully conjugated by bridge atoms. To date, significant progress has been achieved in improving the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance by the optimization of absorption and energy level alignment.6–14 Nevertheless, one critical challenge, the manipulation of the morphology of the active layer, still remains. The morphology of the blend film is determined by the intermolecular interaction between donor and acceptor.15–21 Following the typical A–D–A architecture, numerous studies have been carried out to modulate the molecular geometry of acceptors, including the substitution of a halogen on the terminal,22–27 changing the sidechain,28–33 extending conjugation and altering the aromatic ring of the core,34–42 introduction of a π-bridge,43–51 and so on.52–56
However, few examples have been reported regarding the selection of bridge atoms in the aromatic fused-ring.57–60 Although the bridge atoms are not involved in the conjugation, they participate in the construction of the backbone as the site linking sidechains, and thus significantly affect the morphology by tuning the intra- and intermolecular interactions.61–63 Generally, an sp3-hybridized carbon atom is employed as the bridge to facilitate the introduction of flexible sidechains, which is essential to enhance the solubility to guarantee the solution-process capability of the relevant materials.1,2 However, it has been demonstrated that altering the bridge atoms from carbon to silicon or germanium which possesses a larger atomic radius can improve the π–π stacking of the relevant molecules, which is attributed to the longer C–Si or C–Ge bonds which keep the sidechains far away from the backbone.64–66 Notably, the C–Ge bond is only slightly longer than the C–Si bond due to d-block contraction. Moreover, the same effect makes the electronegativity of germanium much closer to that of carbon than of silicon, reducing the polarization of the C–Ge bond and rendering the aryl germane much more stable towards bases and nucleophiles compared to the silane analogue.67 However, the previous studies involving aryl germane have mainly focused on polymer donors, while a germanium based acceptor has not yet been reported for OSCs.68–71 This inspired us to investigate the effect of bridge atoms on molecular geometry and intermolecular packing, which consequently impact the morphology of the active layer in OSCs.
Herein, two new non-fullerene acceptors with an A–D–A architecture have been designed and synthesized, in which two 2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene) propanedinitrile (IC) groups terminally flank an electron donating core, indacenodithiophene (IDT) and germaindacenodithiophene (GDT) for IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8 (Scheme 1), respectively. Notably, GDIC-C8 is the first reported non-fullerene acceptor based on germanium. Altering only one atom dramatically changes the molecular geometry and packing. Compared to IDIC-C8, GDIC-C8 has a more planar geometry with a smaller dihedral angle between the GDT core and the IC terminal group in the single crystal. More importantly, due to the varied steric hindrance induced by the sidechains, the IDIC-C8 crystal is seen to be a three-dimensional (3D) reticular motif while the GDIC-C8 crystal appears as a 1D lamellar/slip-stack packing. Consequently, the co-facial packing endows GDIC-C8 with higher crystallinity and better packing order in single crystal and neat films. However, the extremely high crystallinity and unfavorable edge-on packing of GDIC-C8 is bad for exciton dissociation and charge transport in the blend film, leading to a relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.76% compared to that of IDIC-C8 (10.23%).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic details of IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8 are shown in Scheme 1 and the details are depicted in the ESI.† The aromatic cores, IDT and GDT, are prepared by following similar procedures to those in the previous literature,65,72 followed by the Knoevenagel reaction to afford the target molecules. The chemical structures are confirmed by NMR and mass spectra.
The optical properties of these two acceptors are studied by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1). IDIC-C8 displays strong absorption with a molar absorption coefficient of 1.99 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 668 nm. After the substitution of germanium on the bridge position, the absorption of GDIC-C8 shows a hypsochromic shift with a molar absorption coefficient of 1.66 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 644 nm. The absorption spectra of both IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8 in the solid state (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†) show a red shift of around 40 nm compared to their solution absorption, respectively, indicating the tendency for aggregation of these two molecules. In the solid state, GDIC-C8 presents a narrower absorption band, indicating a stronger crystallinity and relatively high packing order compared to IDIC-C8, which can be rationalized by the more planar geometry of GDIC-C8. These results suggest that the alteration of the bridge atom significantly leads to the diversity of the absorption spectra.

The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 1c, both IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8 exhibit reversible oxidative and reductive behaviors. From the onset potentials of redox curves, the energy levels of frontier orbitals, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are estimated to be −5.63/−3.86 eV and −5.67/−3.86 eV for IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8, respectively (Fig. 1d). Notably, GDIC-C8 shows a slightly lower HOMO compared to IDIC-C8. This is rationalized by the fact that the HOMO in the push–pull structure is mainly determined by the donor part, i.e. the GDT core, in which the longer C–Ge bond reduces the interaction involving the thiophene and the phenyl ring.64
Crystallography
The single crystals of these two acceptors are successfully obtained via slow evaporation of the dilute solution (GDIC-C8 in dichloromethane and IDIC-C8 in chloroform solution respectively) to identify the diversity of the molecular geometry and packing. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, C–Ge bonds exhibit longer bond lengths (1.97 Å and 1.95 Å) compared to C–C bonds (1.53 Å and 1.51 Å), which expectedly makes the sidechains of GDIC-C8 far away from the backbone plane, verified by the distances between the centroid of the aromatic core and the methylene group connected to the bridge atom, 3.8 Å for IDIC-C8 and 4.4 Å for GDIC-C8, respectively. It is well known that noncovalent interaction is very important for locking the conformation. Due to the varied molecular skeletons of IDT and GDT, the angles between the sulfur atom in thiophene and the five-membered ring containing bridge atoms are significantly different, 135.40° for IDIC-C8 and 127.40° for GDIC-C8 respectively, leading to varied noncovalent interactions involving the sulfur atom. For GDIC-C8, the S⋯H distance between the sulfur atom and the hydrogen of the phenyl ring in the D core is 2.96 Å and S⋯O interaction between the D core and A flank is 2.76 Å, while the distances of S⋯H and S⋯O in IDIC-C8 are 3.39 Å and 2.73 Å respectively. Moreover, the coplanarity of GDIC-C8 is significantly enhanced, providing a relatively small dihedral angle of 1.9° between the GDT core and the IC group, while the molecular geometry of IDIC-C8 is evidently distorted with a torsional angle of 6.8°.

The molecular packing is further investigated to reveal the influence of the bridge atom. As stated in previous reports,73–75IDIC-C8 presents a typical 3D reticular packing motif, providing a diamond-like interpenetrating network (Fig. 2f and Fig S2, ESI†) wherein each IDIC-C8 overlaps with four adjacent molecules via the π–π stacking of flanked IC groups. For each IC group, there are two types of A⋯A close contacts, one from an antiparallel adjacent IC group at a distance of 3.45 Å, and the other from an interleaving IC group at a distance of 3.38 Å (Fig. 2d). Altering the bridge atom from carbon to germanium dramatically transforms the crystal of GDIC-C8 into a lamellar packing motif with 1D π–π stacking (Fig. 2e and Fig. S3, ESI†).73,76
The GDT core shows co-facial J-aggregation with a D⋯D distance of 3.63 Å. Meanwhile the slip stacking of the GDT core leads to a D⋯A overlap (3.51 Å) involving the GDT core and the adjacent IC moiety in another GDIC-C8 molecule (Fig. 2c). In non-fullerene acceptors with the A–D–A configuration, the bulk sidechains in the D core protrude perpendicularly from the backbone plane, sterically hindering the co-facial packing of the donor moiety, i.e. D⋯D π–π stacking is rare in A–D–A acceptors.77,78 The existence of an intermolecular D⋯D contact in GDIC-C8 suggests that the longer C–Ge bond is beneficial for the enhancement of the packing order in the crystal.
Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the effect of the bridge atom on the photovoltaic performance, OSC devices with a conventional architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/acceptor:donor/ZnO/Al are fabricated. Regarding the donor material, polymer PBDB-T and its fluorinated analogue PM6 (Fig. S4, ESI†) are employed, in which PM6 has a relatively low crystallinity due to the steric hindrance of the fluorine atom.3,72 The device parameters under various fabrication conditions are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). As depicted in Fig. 3a and Table 1, the optimal device based on GDIC-C8:PM6 shows a PCE of 6.76% with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 11.39 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 58.2%. The IDIC-C8:PM6 based device achieves a higher PCE of 10.23% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 14.12 mA cm-2, and a fill factor (FF) of 74.7% (Table 1). When the donor polymer is PBDB-T, the optimal GDIC-C8 based device shows a similar PCE of 6.83% with a significantly higher FF of 66.9% compared to GDIC-C8:PM6, while the IDIC-C8:PBDB-T device shows a PCE of 6.86% and a FF of 61.8%, similar to that of the GDIC-C8:PBDB-T based device (Table S2 and Fig. S5, ESI†). Notably, the sharp contrast in device performance is beneficial for the investigation of the distinctive effect of bridge atoms, so the acceptor:PM6 combination was used to study the structure–property relationship in the following sections.

Despite the LUMO levels of these two acceptors being identical, the GDIC-C8 based device shows a higher Voc. However, the photoresponse value of the overall EQE curve (Fig. 3b) in the GDIC-C8:PM6 device is lower than that of the IDIC-C8 based device, which is inconsistent with their absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the absorption spectra of GDIC-C8:PM6 and IDIC-C8:PM6 show similar intensities. This implies that the diversity of the photocurrent is not mainly determined by the photon absorption in the device. Thereby, the charge transporting behavior is investigated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7, ESI†). Both hole and electron mobilities of the GDIC-C8 blend film (μh/μe, 7.04 × 10−4/5.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1) are relatively low compared to those of the IDIC-C8 blend film (μh/μe, 8.36 × 10−4/8.84 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1), which is consistent with the poor photovoltaic performance of the GDIC-C8 device. It is notable that a 3D reticular motif is preferred for isotropic charge transport in multiple directions.73 To reveal the inherent mechanism, the exciton dissociation and charge recombination kinetics are further studied. As shown in Fig. 3c, the exciton dissociation and collection probability of the GDIC-C8 based device (87.8% and 83.0%) are obviously lower than those of the IDIC-C8 based device (96.5% and 95.9%), which rationalizes the low photoresponse of the GDIC-C8 based device, consequently leading to the inferior Jsc. In addition, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on light intensity (Fig. 3d and Fig. S8, ESI†) reveals that Shockley–Read–Hall recombination is sufficiently suppressed in these devices demonstrated by the fact that both scaling factors in these two devices are 1.00, while the power-law dependence of the GDIC-C8 based device (0.89) is relatively low compared to that of IDIC-C8 (0.91), indicating a deteriorated bimolecular recombination which is consistent with its low FF.
Morphology and microstructure
The morphology of neat films is also studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the IDIC-C8 film prepared by spin-coating appears to be amorphous with a small root mean square roughness (RMS) of 0.51 nm, while the GDIC-C8 film is obviously crystalline with an RMS of 2.64 nm. This diversity might be correlated with the packing model. For GDIC-C8, each molecule only interacts with two adjacent molecules to form a 1D packing motif which is speculated to be facilely executed during the fast spin-coating process. However, the spin-coating is not good enough to form the complex 3D reticular motif of IDIC-C8 in which each molecule is in close contact with four adjacent molecules. These results suggest that GDIC-C8 has a higher crystallinity and better packing order in single crystal and neat films. However, the GDIC-C8 based device shows poor exciton dissociation, relatively low charge mobility and worse charge recombination, eventually leading to inferior photovoltaic performance. These might be relevant to the morphology and microstructure of the blend film. Therefore blend films fabricated under various conditions are also characterized by AFM. Dramatically, obvious phase separation is evident in both blend films (Fig. 4c and d), wherein the IDIC-C8:PM6 film even shows a higher RMS of 1.46 nm than GDIC-C8 (1.26 nm). As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), the solvent additive chloronaphthalene (CN) enhances the domain size in blend films but thermal annealing shows less effect.

To further reveal the microstructure distinction of blend films, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements are performed. Fig. 5 shows the 2D patterns and related out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cut profiles. Obviously, more scattering signals are present in the 2D patterns of the GDIC-C8 blend film, indicating a stronger crystallinity. In both blend films, PM6 shows the face-on packing demonstrated by the 010 peak at 1.67 A−1 in OOP and the bimodal 100 peaks at 0.30 A−1 in IP and OOP,79 corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.76 Å and lamellar packing distance of 21.0 Å respectively. Besides the scattering peaks of PM6, there is a strong lamellar peak at 0.33 A−1 (OOP) in OOP and a π–π stacking peak at 1.74 A−1 (IP) in the blend film of GDIC-C8:PM6, indicating the existence of a preferential edge-on π–π stacking of GDIC-C8. In addition, there is an OOP direction peak at 0.67 A−1 the origin of which is difficult to assign and might be from the GDIC-C8 backbone ordering. Meanwhile there is no obvious π–π stacking peak for IDIC-C8. Combining the results of AFM and GIWAXS, it is clear that GDIC-C8 shows high crystallinity in the blend film and the packing of PM6 in the IDIC-C8:PM6 blend film is dominant. This might be relevant to the different crystal motifs of GDIC-C8 and IDIC-C8, which has been demonstrated by the morphology of neat films. During the spin-coating process, the highly crystalline GDIC-C8 facilely forms 1D packing, which restrains competitively the crystallization of PM6 in the blend film. Consequently, the more amorphous PM6 leads to poor exciton dissociation and deterioration ofthe charge recombination. This also rationalizes that the FF of the GDIC-C8 based device is significantly improved when the polymer PBDB-T with a stronger crystallinity is employed as the donor. In addition, the unfavorable edge-on packing of GDIC-C8 causes the decline of charge mobility in the vertical direction. These features synergistically result in the low photocurrent and FF of the GDIC-C8 based device.

Conclusions
In summary, to modulate the molecular geometry and packing of A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptors, IDIC-C8 and GDIC-C8 are prepared by altering the bridge atoms of the donor core with carbon or germanium. Attributed to the longer C-Ge bond which makes the bulk sidechains more far away from the backbone, the coplanarity of GDIC-C8 is significantly enhanced compared to that of IDIC-C8. More importantly, the reduced steric hindrance leads to a co-facial packing in the GDIC-C8 single crystal which is rare in A–D–A acceptors, resulting in a 1D lamellar motif with highly ordered π–π stacking. Only close contact among terminal groups is observed in the IDIC-C8 case, forming a typical 3D reticular packing motif. The features of molecular geometry and packing endow GDIC-C8 with higher crystallinity and better packing order in single crystal and neat films. However, the extremely high crystallinity of GDIC-C8 restrains competitively the crystallization of PM6 in the blend film. Moreover, GDIC-C8 prefers to form edge-on π–π stacking when blended with the donor polymer PM6, which restrains the charge transport between two electrodes in the vertical direction. Eventually, poor exciton dissociation, low charge transport and increased bimolecular recombination result in the poor photovoltaic performance of GDIC-C8 compared to IDIC-C8. Overall, this work systematically studies the effect of bridge atoms on molecular geometry and packing and reveals the potential for the modulation of optoelectronic properties and device performance by changing only one atom in the fused-ring semiconductors.

Device fabrication
Patterned indium tin oxide glass (ITO) glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq−1 were used. The glass was cleaned with deionized water, acetone, chloroform, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially in an ultra-sonic bath for 15 min each and then dried using N2 gas. Then, 10 min of UV-ozone treatment was applied before use. The PEDOT-PSS solution was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO glass substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the PEDOT-PSS coated substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Acceptor:PM6 blends were dissolved in chloroform:CN (99.75:0.25, v/v) at 50 °C and stirred overnight in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The active layers with optimized thicknesses were obtained by spin-coating the blend solution at room temperature with polymer concentrations of 8 mg mL−1. Then, 10 mg mL−1 ZnO nanoparticle solution was spin-coated onto the active layer at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, the anode, 100 nm Al, was deposited at a speed of 0.3 nm s−1 through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation in a vacuum chamber under 3 × 10−6 Torr to complete the device fabrication. The active area of the device was 3.64 mm2 defined by a shadow mask.
