, Accepted 1st June 2023First published on 21st June 2023AbstractOxides are physically and chemically stable. Non-contact thermometer—Yb3+–Er3+ ions co-doped solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3, is prepared by the regular solid method. The structural results obtained by XRD indicate that a pure phase solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 has been obtained. The solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 has a similar crystal structure, especially Y2O3 and In2O3 with the same space group (Ia). Green emission from 500 to 600 nm is due to Er3+ 4f–4f transitions: 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 at 567 nm and 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 at 528 nm. Red emissions from 630 to 720 nm are attributed to Er3+: 4F9/2 → 4I15/2. UC luminescence changes greatly with laser diode power and Er3+ and Yb3+ content. Furthermore, the two-photon process is confirmed to be dominant between Yb3+ and Er3+ in oxide solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3. Optical temperature sensitivity is also investigated systematically in order to explore the application of the oxide solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3. The temperature-dependent green fluorescence at 528 and 567 nm was investigated with the range of 313–573 K. 0.316% K−1 is the maximum absolute sensitivity at 503 K, which is higher than most Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped systems. In addition, the solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ has better thermal stability and stronger UC emission than a simple substance with excellent temperature sensing performance. It indicates that Yb3+–Er3+ ions co-doped (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 solid solution is a good candidate for optical temperature sensing.
1. Introduction
Converting long wavelength light into short wavelength light, up-conversion (UC) luminescence involves the unique anti Stokes physical process.1–5 UC materials have several significant applications including bioimaging,6 solar cells,7 optical sensing8 and temperature measurements.9 In recent years, non-contact temperature measurements using rare-earth luminescent materials have attracted considerable attention.10 Rare earth doped up-conversion materials have great promise for optical sensing due to their non-contact property, fast response to light and temperature, high immunity to electromagnetic interference and high spatial resolution of temperature measurement. By thermal coupling energy levels (TCLs) of chosen pairs and tracking their fluorescence intensity at different temperatures, fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technology can be used to obtain the corresponding temperature. NaYF4 is currently the most efficient fluoride up-conversion luminescence material, such as NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+, in which Yb3+ is used as a sensitizer and Er3+ is used as an activator.11 However, fluorides are generally unstable in air and are toxic, therefore it is crucial to limit use.12 However, oxides usually have excellent physical and chemical stability, and are particularly non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Therefore, in recent years, systematic studies of up-conversion oxides with an increased degree have been carried out.13,14 According to Planck's law, Ceramic Y2O3:Er3+,Yb3+ have excellent luminescence characteristics over a wide temperature range.34 In up-conversion luminescence, due to Yb3+ high near-infrared absorption cross section at 980 nm, it is usually used as a sensitizer and then energy transfer (ET) to other Ln3+, such as Er3+, Eu3+ and Cr3+.35–37 As Er3+ has two suitable TCLs, 4S3/2 and 2H11/2, with a 770 cm−1 energy gap, it is a widely used activator. Due to high and broad absorption and efficient ET to Er3+, the Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped hosts can significantly amplify the UC efficiency.15–17 The studies on the up-conversion properties of UC solid solutions co-doped with Yb3+–Er3+ ions, especially physically and chemically stable oxides, are still ongoing. The effective energy transfer process from Yb3+ to Er3+ is confirmed in In2O3.38 We suppose (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ has higher sensitivity. Herein, a UC phosphor (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ solid solution has been successfully obtained via a traditional solid-state method. The photoluminescence properties were systematically studied, including UC luminescence, ET mechanism between Yb3+ and Er3+, and optical temperature sensitivity. When the UC solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ was exposed to a 980 nm continuous laser, a bright orange output is visible, consisting of strong red radiation Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and weak green radiation of Er3+:4S3/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2. From FIR technology, optical temperature sensitivity is probable with good approximation. In the range 313–573 K, 0.316% K−1 is the maximum sensitivity at 503 K, which is higher than that of most systems. These results demonstrate that (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+/Er3+ can be used as an optical temperature sensor.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+–Er3+
(Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+–Er3+ solid solution phosphors were manufactured using a traditional solid phase process. Y2O3 (Analytical Reagent, A.R.), In2O3 (A.R.), Yb2O3 (4N) and Er2O3 (4N) are the raw materials. All reagents were weighed stoichiometrically and milled for 60 minutes. Then, the powder was sintered at 1400 °C for 6 hours. The final product was obtained by further milling at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
2.2 Characterization
Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation was used to detect the structure of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+–Er3+. Data were collected across the range 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80° with 0.02° increments. The microscopic morphology was characterized using a JSM-7800F scanning electron microscope (SEM). An energy dispersive spectrometery (EDS) was conducted on a ThermoFisher Scientific Talos F200S, Netherlands for sample composition analysis. A 980 nm cw laser was selected as excitation light for the UC luminescence. Visible radiation was collected using a Hitachi F-4600 Fluorescence spectrophotometer. An Orient-KOJI TAP-02 high-temperature fluorescence device was used for temperature-dependent luminescence behavior.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+/Er3+
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the synthesized (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+/Er3+. The diffraction patterns of Yb3+–Er3+ ions co-doped (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 obey well the data JCPDS No: 00-025-1097, standard (Y0.5In0.5)2O3, and no extra peaks are observed. The powder materials obtained in this way are purity phase and have no obvious lattice changes after Yb3+ and Er3+ doping into (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 solid solution. In accordance with activator's electrovalence and ionic radii, the ionic radii of Yb3+ and Er3+ are 11.6 and10.3 Å, respectively, which are near that of Y3+ (10.4 Å) and In3+ (10.6 Å) in the host lattice.18 Therefore, it was suggested that Er3+/Yb3+ occupy In/Y positions in (Y0.5In0.5)2O3. The X-ray diffraction diagram does not reveal the second phase, indicating that Yb3+/Er3+ ions are completely dissolved in (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 due to the substitution of In3+/Y3+ ions. Sharp diffraction peaks indicate that the sample is highly crystallized, which always increases luminescence intensity.

(Y0.5In0.5)2O3 is the solid solution of Y2O3 and In2O3, with the same space group Ia (206), cubic with Y2O3 and In2O3.

Particle size is also critical to the luminescence properties of a material. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and EDS diagram of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05Er3+ are shows in Fig. 3a and b. The irregular grains are mostly around 1–2 micrometers from the SEM images. The EDS diagram shows that the contents of the element Er, Y, In, O, and Yb are close to the theoretical chemical ratio, further indicating Er3+/Yb3+ was successfully inserted into the (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 crystal lattice.

3.2 UC luminescent properties
UC spectra of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:xYb3+, 0.05Er3+ and (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+, yEr3+ under a 0.5 W cw 980 nm laser excitation are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. UC luminescence of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ contains the green and red emissions. Green emission in the range 500 to 600 nm is comprised of four peaks that belong to Er3+ 4f → 4f transitions, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 at 528 nm and Er3+: 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 at 567 nm.19 The red luminescence band from 620 to 730 nm is attributed to Er3+ transition 4F9/2 → 4I15/2. The emission intensity is sensitive to changes of Yb3+/Er3+ concentration in (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+. When Er3+ is 5 mol% and Yb3+ is below 14 mol%, UC emission intensity for (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:xYb3+,0.05Er3+ increases first and then decreases (Fig. 4). The optimal Yb3+ content is determined as 14 mol% for (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:xYb3+,0.05Er3+. When Yb3+ exceeds 14mol%, UC emission gradually descends. The main reason may be energy back transfer (EBT) between Yb3+ and Er3+.10 When Yb3+ is 14 mol%, UC emission for (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,yEr3+ also changes with the Er3+ concentration and the UC emission gets to its maximum at Er3+ 5 mol%, shown in Fig. 5. When the Er3+ concentration exceeds 5 mol%, the high doping concentration results in lower emission intensity for (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,yEr3+ owning to concentration quenching effects caused by cross relaxation and nonradiative energy transfer between Er3+.20–23 The Red emission of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05Er3+ is 9 times higher than that of green light, resulting in a bright orange color visible with the naked eye.

3.3 UC mechanism
To understand the mechanism of up-conversion luminescence, the dependence of the luminescence intensity of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05 Er3+ on the pump power was investigated (Fig. 6). Red emission intensity increases with the pump power as shown in Fig. 6a. Fig. 6b is a color map for improved visual clarity of emission dependence on laser power. UC emission intensity (I) is dependent on the laser power (P):24 
I ∝ Pn
(1)where n is pumping photons number from ground to excited state. Fig. 7 shows the Ln–Ln plot of integrated intensity of all radiation dependence on pump power for (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05 Er3+. According to the above formula, the number of photons n at 528 nm, 567 nm and 664 nm is approximately 1.82, 1.83, and 1.59, respectively, from the straight fitted line slope. Thus, red and green UC was a two photon process in the (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+–Er3+ samples.

 Fig. 7  The logarithm of UC emission intensities at 528 nm, 567 nm and 664 nm versus the pump power. 
Fig. 8 is the schematic energy level diagram illustrating the UC mechanism of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ solid solution ions. When Yb3+ absorb a 980 nm infrared photon, the electron is elevated from 2F7/2 to 2F5/2. Due to energy syntonic of Yb3+:2F5/2 and Er3+:4I11/2, ET from Yb3+ to Er3+ causes Er3+:4I15/2 → 4I11/2.25 Subsequently, electrons partially relax from 4I11/2 to 4I13/2 during nonradiative relaxation. After absorbing another photon, the population of 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 is stimulated to the 4F7/2 and 2F9/2 level. Thereafter, red emission (4F9/2 → 4I15/2) appears. In addition, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 would be occupied by electrons from the 4F7/2 level because of nonradiative relaxation. The population on 4S3/2 partially relaxes to 4F9/2, generating 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 with red radiation. Meanwhile, the green emission, indicates transitions from 2H11/2 and 3S3/2 to 4I15/2.26 However, 4F7/2(Er3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+) → 4F9/2(Er3+) + 4F9/2(Er3+), indicates that cross relaxation (CR) plays a dominant role instead of nonradiative relaxation.20,21 Meanwhile, there is an EBT, 4S3/2(Er3+) + 2F7/2(Yb3+) → 4I13/2(Er3+) + 2F5/2(Yb3+), as Yb3+ ions concentration is high, which increases red radiation and weakens green emission.27,28

3.4 Temperature behavior
Temperature effect on green emission of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05Er3+ phosphors should be investigated. Fig. 9a shows the emission spectra of a typical (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05Er3+ sample upon 980 nm excitation at different temperatures. Fig. 9b is a temperature contour for better clarity of the radiation intensity versus temperature. The intensities of green radiation are 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, as well as red emissions associated with 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions which cause significant changes with temperature. As the temperature rises, all emissions gradually decrease. For the green emissions, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 and 2H11/2 are thermally coupled levels, and their relative population comply with the Boltzmann distribution29,30 
(2)where  is green emissions FIR from 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 to ground state 4I15/2, N is proportionality constant, Boltzmann constant k = 0.695 K−1 cm−1, ΔE is the energy gap between 4S3/2 and 2H11/2, and T is absolute temperature.

Fig. 10 shows FIR for 4S3/2 (546–600 nm) and 2H11/2 (500–546 nm) vs. temperature. The experimental data indicate that FIR gradually increases with increase in temperature, which are well fitted to FIR = 6.03 × e(−1038.61/T). FIR control reaches an astonishing 99.96%. In addition, the calculated value of ΔE was 721.8 cm−1, close to the splitting energy of thermally bonded levels 4S3/2 and 2H11/2, 700–800 cm−1.31

Sensitivity S is considered an important parameter for evaluating the performance of temperature sensors in practical thermometer applications. Herein, sensitivity is distinguished as absolute sensitivity SA and relative sensitivity SR:32,33

(4)
According to formula (4), a larger energy gap ΔE can lead to a larger SR, while the absolute sensitivity SA is also influenced by FIR. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 describe SA and SR change with temperature from 313 to 573 K. At 313 K, 0.244% K−1 is the starting point of SA. With increasing temperature, a maximum absolute sensitivity is reached, about 0.316% K−1 at 503 K. SR is 1038/T2, decreasing with temperature from 313 K to 573 K. Therefore, the maximum relative sensitivity was 1.062% K−1 at 313 K.

 Fig. 12  The relative sensitivity (SR) of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:0.14Yb3+,0.05Er3+ depending on temperature from 313–573 K. 
The temperature sensing performance of (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ was assessed as good in comparison with other optical systems based on FIR in accordance with Table 4. The sensitivity of solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ is higher than most other systems. As an oxide optical thermometer based on the FIR, the solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ has a possible high-test temperature of more than 573 K. Y2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ is reported by the determination condition of about 2100 K.34 Therefore, we believe that (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+,Er3+ will have excellent performance at high temperatures due to its strong UC emission and good thermal stability property.

The weak green radiation (Er3+:4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition) and strong red radiation (Er3+:2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition) were detected. As FIR optical thermometer, thermally coupled electronic levels 2H11/2/4S3/2, corresponding to green radiation of 528 nm/567 nm, depending on temperature in the range 313–573 K, were systemically investigated. Maximum absolute sensitivity of the solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3 is 0.316% K−1 at 503 K. All results make the solid solution (Y0.5In0.5)2O3:Yb3+–Er3+ a promising physically and chemically stable optical temperature sensor.
