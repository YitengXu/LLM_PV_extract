    , Accepted 27th September 2022First published on 27th September 2022AbstractThe chiral Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes of [6]helicene thioethyl porphyrazine have been synthesized and their spectroscopic, electrochemical, and chiroptical properties have been investigated by experimental and computational analyses. In these compounds, the tetrapyrrole macrocycle is β-substituted with an inherently chiral extended aromatic moiety potentially suitable to establish attractive π–π interactions with nanocarbons and endowed with helical chirality, both features providing interesting properties for optoelectronic applications. Experimental and density functional theory computational analyses highlight the presence of HOMO–LUMO charge-transfer transitions between the helicene moiety and the porphyrazine macrocycle. These compounds behave as mono-substituted push–pull systems without any typical electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups and thus appear promising for optoelectronics. The enantiomers of the Ni(II) complex have been separated by chiral HPLC and their absolute configuration has been established by density functional theory computational analysis of electronic circular dichroism spectra. The magnetic circular dichroism spectrum of this complex has also been recorded providing better insight into its electronic structure.
Introduction
The importance of chirality, well established since a long time for biomolecules,1 is emerging now more and more frequently also in materials science.2 In fact, chiral materials3 or chiral supramolecular assemblies4 display peculiar and distinct properties both at the molecular level and in aggregated states. In particular, the relevant role of chirality has been evidenced in materials for optoelectronic applications. Among them, chiral liquid crystals5 have found interesting applications, and other studies highlight the importance of chirality in materials for non-linear optics (NLO),6 or for the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.7 Only recently, the importance of chirality in organic solar cells has been highlighted, showing different efficiencies when either the racemate or the enantiopure molecule is employed as an acceptor.8 However, the use of chiral tetrapyrrole macrocycles in organic photovoltaics (OPV) has not been explored yet, although tetrapyrroles are among the most employed low molecular weight compounds for OPV.9,10 We considered it worthwhile to synthesize novel chiral tetrapyrrole derivatives suitable for photovoltaic applications. Tetrapyrroles display relevant spectroscopic properties, with intense absorption in the visible range, great thermal and chemical stability, and good synthetic versatility, which allow fine tuning of their spectral and electrochemical features. The most employed tetrapyrroles in OPV essentially belong to the porphyrin9 and phthalocyanine10 subgroups, while only a few examples have been reported regarding the application of porphyrazines in photoactive devices.11 Only recently, some of us described the first efficient photovoltaic device based on nanocomposites constituted by a pyrene-substituted thioalkyl porphyrazine with both carbon nanotubes and graphene.12 In this case, the macrocycle acts as an antenna for light harvesting, while the extended aromatic pyrene moiety allows one to anchor the dye to the nanocarbons through non-covalent π–π interactions. The latter is the acceptor part of the device, ensuring efficient charge transfer. Notably, the porphyrazine compound displays atropisomeric chirality, because the pyrene moiety is not coplanar with the macrocyclic core. Accordingly, the two enantiomers of this pyrene–porphyrazine were separated by chiral HPLC and stereochemically characterized by computational analysis of electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. However, the enantiomers were configurationally unstable at room temperature, having a rotational barrier of about 22.0 kcal mol−1.13 We then decided to investigate new porphyrazine scaffolds conjugated with extended aromatic moieties endowed with stable inherent chirality like helicenes. In fact, these moieties join an aromatic structure suitable to establish attractive π–π interactions with nanocarbons with helical chirality, a structural feature providing interesting properties for optoelectronic applications14 and organic light-emission diodes (OLEDs),15 but still they have been rarely explored in organic photovoltaics.8c,16 In one of those literature examples racemic and enantiopure bis-naphthalimide [6]helicene acceptors blended with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPV were compared and a 5-fold increase in power conversion efficiency was observed when switching from a racemic to an enantiopure helicene moiety.8c This difference was attributed to a different packing of homo- and hetero-chiral assemblies in the solid state affecting both the charge transport properties and the morphology within the active layers. The same packing effect was also explored to explain the much higher hole mobility observed in enantiopure 1-aza[6]helicene in comparison with racemate,17 eventually leading to devices with selective optical responses to circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation.18 Taking into account the fact that non-radiation energy loss represents one limiting effect on the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells,19 photoluminescent molecules deserve particular attention in OPV. For this reason, in this work we have preliminarily investigated compounds substituted with the low fluorescence20 carbohelicene moiety, being aware that for future developments heterohelicenes, which display higher photoluminescence properties,15a,21 would be more advisable.
The aim of this paper is then to describe the design, synthesis, and characterization of the novel [6]helicene β-substituted thioethyl porphyrazine Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix, respectively (Schemes 2). To the best of our knowledge, these complexes represent the first examples of helicene-substituted porphyrazines.22 The spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of the complexes were investigated by experimental and computational methods and, after HPLC enantiomeric separation on a chiral stationary phase, the chiroptical properties of the enantiomers were investigated by computational analysis of the ECD spectrum, eventually establishing the absolute configuration of the eluted enantiomers of NiPzHelix.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The hexahelicene-substituted thioethyl porphyrazine Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix were synthesized through Sonogashira coupling between the 2-ethynyl-[6]helicene 3 and mono-bromo substituted macrocycles 6b and 6c, respectively, in turn obtained by an asymmetrization process23 of the parent symmetric thioethyl porphyrazine 4 (see Schemes 1 and 2). Accordingly, 2-bromo-[6]helicene (1) was coupled, through the Sonogashira reaction, with trimethylsilylacetylene in the presence of CuI (11% mol) and the Pd(II) catalyst [PdCl2(PPh3)2] (20% mol) in Et3N (Scheme 1).24 The high quantity of Pd(II) and Cu(I) catalysts employed and the use of Et3N as the solvent, allowing a higher reflux temperature, gave rise to product 2 in a more than satisfactory 50% yield. Notably, this experimental procedure, originally described for the alkynyl functionalization of more reactive 7-bromo-[6]helicene, was very effective also with 2-bromo-[6]helicene, thus highly increasing yields for the alkynyl Sonogashira coupling of this compound.25 Alkynyl helicene 2 was then desilylated, by treatment with K2CO3 in THF/methanol solution,26 providing 2-ethynyl-[6]helicene 3 in good 83% yield.

The bromo derivative 6a was prepared from the parent symmetrically substituted thioethyl porphyrazine 4 (Scheme 2).27 First, the removal of one alkylsulfanyl chain led to the formation of nonsymmetrical β-H-substituted porphyrazine 523 which was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), providing bromo porphyrazine 6a.28 Such a unique a posteriori asymmetrization process of the symmetric parent macrocycle allows one to avoid the commonest low yielding statistical macrocyclization. The Ni(II) complex 6b was prepared by the reaction of free base bromo porphyrazine 6a with NiCl2·DME, as previously described,29 whereas complex 6c was obtained herein for the first time from 6a and Pd(OAc)2 following a procedure described for Pd(II) insertion in thioalkyl porphyrazines.13 Finally, the Sonogashira coupling reaction between complexes 6b and 6c and 2-ethynyl-[6]helicene 3 was carried out under the same conditions as mentioned above,24 providing the desired products NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix in 29% and 25% yields, respectively.
Spectroscopic analysis
The electronic properties of NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix were investigated by experimental and theoretical analysis of their UV–vis absorption spectra. In Fig. 1 and Table 1 the experimental UV–vis spectra of NiPzHelix are reported together with those of the Ni(II) complex 6b and 2-ethynyl-[6]hexahelicene (3). The UV–vis spectrum of NiPzHelix shows the typical features of the non-aggregated metal complexes of thioalkyl porphyrazines,29,30 displaying a single broad Q band at 672 nm,31 a Soret band at 328 nm and, in between, a band at 493 nm ascribable to sulfur n → π* transitions.32 Moreover, the UV–vis spectrum of NiPzHelix shows a structured absorption band around 270 nm which is missing in the spectrum of the parent bromo derivative 6b and, by comparison with the alkynyl helicene 3, contains contributions also from the 1Ba transition of the helicene chromophore.33,34 The UV-vis spectrum of the PdPzHelix complex (Fig. S15 in the ESI† and Table 1) shows the same spectral features as those of NiPzHelix albeit with some wavelength differences of the band maxima. To sort out the metal effect on the band wavelength we compared the spectra of the Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes, analyzing both the 6b/6c and NiPzHelix/PdPzHelix pairs. Such a comparison shows that in both cases the Soret band is slightly red shifted (ca. 6 nm) in the Pd(II) complexes while a much larger bathochromic shift (ca. 20 nm) is observed for the n → π* band of the Pd(II) derivatives. Notably, the Q band is almost unaffected by the metal substitution in brominated 6b and 6c while an hypsochromic shift of 9 nm is observed in PdPzHelix with respect to NiPzHelix. As far as the hexahelicene substitution is concerned, a comparison between the 6b and NiPzHelix Ni(II) complexes shows that helicene substitution leaves practically unaffected the Soret band wavelength which dominates with respect to the underlying Bb helicene band; however the presence of helicene gives a higher Soret-Q band intensity ratio in NiPzHelix in comparison to 6b. Considering the lower energy bands, a bathochromic shift of 17 nm is observed both for the Q and for the n → π* bands. An analogous red shift of these bands is observed upon comparing the UV-vis spectrum of PdPzHelix with that of the parent brominated Pd(II) complex 6c (Fig. S15 and Table 1 in the ESI†). In fact, the n → π* and Q bands of PdPzHelix are shifted by 22 nm and 12 nm, respectively, with respect to 6c. The red shift of these bands has already been observed in arylethynyl substituted tetrapyrroles35 and thioalkyl porphyrazines29 and has been attributed to the presence of an effective conjugation between the macrocycle core and the peripheral aromatic substituent. These results seem to indicate that while the hexahelicene substitution gives rise to a generalized red shift of both n → π* and Q bands, the type of metal ion mostly affects the energy transition of the n → π* band.

To get further insight into the electronic structure of these novel [6]helicene-substituted compounds, a time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) computational investigation was carried out to provide an interpretation of the UV–vis spectral features of NiPzHelix taken as a representative example. The UV–vis computed spectrum is well reproduced (see Fig. S19 in the ESI†), and the detailed analysis of the transitions generating the spectrum and of the participated molecular orbitals permits to pinpoint the contributions of the two moieties, as discussed later.
The emission properties of the NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix complexes were also investigated. In Fig. S16a† the fluorescence spectrum of NiPzHelix is compared with that of the Ni(II) complex of the parent symmetric porphyrazine 4 (Ni-4) and of 2-ethynyl-[6]helicene (3). All the compounds have been excited at 350 nm, i.e. in correspondence with the main absorptions of both [6]helicene and porphyrazine (Soret band). As inferred from Fig. S16a† the emission spectrum of NiPzHelix shows, in contrast to complex Ni-4, a more intense and broader band in the 400–550 nm range, where the emission bands of helicene 3 are also observed. However, the intensity of emission bands of NiPzHelix is weaker than that of isolated 3. Notably, at comparable concentrations, the emission intensity of the PdPzHelix complex is 60% higher (Fig. S16b in ESI†). For both NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix excitation in correspondence with the other main porphyrazine absorption bands at 500 nm (n–π* band) and 620 nm, 650 nm, and 670 nm (Q band) does not give detectable emission.
Electrochemical analysis
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurement data of NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix in CH2Cl2 are collected in Table 2 and the voltammograms of the former, taken as an example, are reported in Fig. 2. The redox behavior of both complexes is typical of thioalkyl porphyrazine metal complexes. In fact, two sequential monoelectronic reduction processes are observed in the cathodic region, and can be assigned to the formation of a porphyrazine π-anion radical and a porphyrazine dianion, respectively.30,36,37 The redox processes of NiPzHelix in CH2Cl2 are characterized by a cathodic peak and its anodic counterpart displaying half-wave potentials E1/2(ΔEp) = −0.976 V (0.096) and E1/2(ΔEp) = −1.321 V (0.094) (vs. Fc/Fc+), respectively. Both processes can be considered as quasi-reversible because the conditions for the reversibility are not rigorously fulfilled with the ΔEp values being slightly higher than the expected value of 0.057 mV and Ipa/Ipc ∼ 1.2 instead of 1.0. Furthermore, the CV of NiPzHelix shows a non-reversible signal in the anodic potential range with Ep = +0.678 V (vs. Fc/Fc+). However, the ca. 0.55 V value of such oxidation potential could be more clearly determined by DPV analysis. HOMO and LUMO energies obtained from the electrochemical data are reported in Table 2, by assuming the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium at −4.8 eV.38–40 The HOMO and LUMO energies calculated from the electrochemical data are −5.4 eV for the HOMO and −3.8 eV for the LUMO, giving rise to a ca. 1.6 eV bandgap. Notably, the HOMO and LUMO energy values make NiPzHelix suitable for the fabrication of BHJ cells with nanocarbons as acceptors. In fact, with acceptors such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), and graphene, having work functions41 in the −4.3 to −4.9 eV range, donors with HOMO energy values lower than −5.20 eV and a bandgap energy range of 1.30–1.80 eV are required.42 As far as the electrochemical data for PdPzHelix are concerned, a significant cathodic shift of both reduction potential values is observed and no oxidation signal is detected in the observed potential range (Fig. S20 in the ESI†).

DFT calculations
To gain insight into the experimental results and to characterize the electronic properties, DFT calculations have been conducted on a NiPzHelix model compound with SCH3 pendant groups replacing the SCH2CH3 groups, in order to avoid too many conformers. The helicene P enantiomer has been considered in the calculation. It is important to recall that the orientation of the SCH3 groups, that is the orientation of the n orbitals of the sulfur atoms, has some influence on the electronic states and that some molecular orbitals receive important contributions from sulfur atoms; besides this, it is known that thioalkyl porphyrazines show an “extra” band at about 500 nm which is assigned to nsulfur → π* transitions.32 Five main conformers have been found, possessing the geometrical characteristics as illustrated in Table S1 in the ESI.† The present discussion refers to the main conformer. Optimization has been conducted at the BP86/6-31+G* level, with LANL2DZ pseudopotential for Ni. The subsequent TDDFT calculations to obtain the simulated spectra were run based on the M06-L functional with the same basis set. The solvent has been considered at the iefpcm level. In Table 2 the TDDFT computed values for the HOMO and LUMO orbitals are reported and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental electrochemical determination. Alternatively, since the HOMO level is related to the vertical ionization potential (IP) while the LUMO energy represents the vertical electron affinity (EA), we report in brackets also the computed differences in energy between neutral and charged molecules (ΔSCF),43 similarly to what reported in ref. 29. As expected, the fundamental gap (1.62 eV) is larger than the optical gap (1.15 eV) and is very similar to the gap evaluated by the electrochemical experiment. Analysis of the energy levels and of the orbital electron density is presented in Fig. 3 in comparison with thioethyl porphyrazine Ni(II) complex Ni-4. Taking into account the parent compound one can classify orbitals considering the Gouterman orbitals, which are involved in the most intense absorption bands, nickel orbitals and other orbitals extended not only on the porphyrazine core but also on the sulfur atom pendant. Many of these orbitals, particularly the Gouterman ones, are maintained in the NiPzHelix complex (Fig. 3), however, some of them are quite deformed by the helicene presence (see the HOMO orbital in Fig. 3 and Fig. S17 in the ESI† for other orbitals in the interesting energy range). Helicene, of course, breaks the symmetry and thus the degeneracy, as it occurs for example in the first two excited states (ΔLUMO = 0.0317 eV). From Fig. S17† one may appreciate that some electronic states are localized on the helicene moiety, while others are quite interestingly delocalized on the two moieties. Particularly interesting is the appearance of a level at slightly higher energy than the HOMO Gouterman orbital which is prevalently localized on the helicene and the bridge between the two moieties. This is relevant when considering the calculated absorption transitions: the characteristics of the most relevant ones are reported in Table S2 in the ESI† where the orbitals are classified based on their localization by inspection. This analysis permits to evidence that the first two transitions show charge transfer character from the helicene-bridge moiety to the Gouterman porphyrazine LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals. The location of the frontier orbitals on the two aromatic molecular moieties, helicene and macrocycle, allows the compound to behave as a push–pull system, although lacking typical electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. Other effects are introduced by the broken symmetry: for example some contributions of the metal are also evidence of bright transitions under the Q band, which were not observed in the parent thioalkyl porphyrazine Ni-4.32 As commented above, when analyzing the observed absorption spectra, the features due to helicene are in the same region as the Soret band, and various contributions localized on helicene appear together with other contributions delocalized on both moieties (see Table S2 and Fig. S17† for details).

All orbitals relative to these levels are represented in Fig. S17.† 
Enantiomer separation and chiroptical studies
HPLC chiral separation was performed on racemic NiPzHelix with an (R,R)-Whelk O1 chiral stationary phase and using online ECD and UV-vis detection. The chromatogram in Fig. 4 shows a smooth separation of the two enantiomers of NiPzHelix, while two late eluting minor peaks were observed and attributed to the enantiomers of the demetalated porphyrazine that can form, presumably, as a result of the chromatographic process. As expected, the chromatographic peaks of the two enantiomers display an ECD signal with opposite signs at 330 nm.

The samples allied to the two major peaks with opposite ECD signals were then collected after chromatographic separation, obtaining milligrams of optically pure (>99%) single enantiomers and their ECD spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2. As shown in Fig. 5, the two enantiomers display the expected mirror-image spectra. The first eluted one has an intense positive Cotton effect at 251 nm and a negative one at 358 nm, in correspondence with two most intense helicene bands and with the Soret band. At a higher wavelength, broad weaker negative features appear in correspondence with the sulfur n–π* and Q bands of the macrocycle. In the 200–400 nm range, the ECD spectrum of the NiPzHelix complex very closely resembles that of the [6]helicene chromophore alone33a,34,44 apart from a ∼30 nm bathochromic shift of the lower energy band. This strict similarity allows one to assign the absolute configuration of the eluted enantiomers by a qualitative comparison of the spectra. Such a comparison suggests that the (M) absolute configuration is assigned to the first eluted enantiomer. Additionally, with TDDFT analysis we have calculated both absorption and ECD spectra: as previously stated, the P configuration has been adopted for calculations and shows a spectrum similar to the second eluted enantiomer. We may see that not only the absorption spectrum is well reproduced by calculations (Fig. S19 in the ESI†), but also ECD shows a fairly good agreement reproducing the helicene intense bands, and thus the absolute configuration can be unequivocally assigned. The nsulfur → π* extra band is calculated with higher ECD intensity than that observed, while the calculated signal in the Q region agrees with the recorded weak signal and with its sign. In Fig. S18† the superposition of the various conformer spectra is given: the pendant orientation has some influence on the weak and broad lowest energy feature. It is interesting to point out that no wavelength shift has been used to fit the calculated to the experimental spectra, which makes us confident about the previous discussion based on the calculated electronic energy levels.

The red line represents the first eluted enantiomer and the blue line represents the second eluted enantiomer on (R,R)-WhelkO1 c.s.p. Top: Computed ECD spectrum for the (P) enantiomer of NiPzHelix (BP86/6-31+G* optimization, M06-L/6-31+G*; iefpcm CH2Cl2, 250 states have been considered). 
Notably, there is ECD activity also in the Q region where the main contributions to absorption are due to a flat chromophore which is however perturbed by both the thioalkyl pendants and the ethynyl–helicene. For this purpose it may be interesting also to consider whether and how the system responds to magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy performed directly on the two enantiomeric species as already described.45 In fact, MCD provides a better resolution of the electronic transitions than absorption and also than ECD, taking into account that the thioalkyl porphyrazine ECD activity is very weak in this case. With this technique indeed we obtain intense experimental signals (Fig. 6) analogous to the ones observed for the parent Ni-4 complex:32 the Q doublet is very similar in shape and intensity despite the reduction in the symmetry, and also the nsulfur → π* band and the Soret region are similar. Some differences may be due to the helicene contributions in this region, but with the used relatively weak 0.6 T magnetic field it is hard to analyze them.

Conclusions
The first [6]helicene-substituted porphyrazine macrocyclic complexes NiPzHelix and PdPzHelix have been synthesized and their spectroscopic, electrochemical, and chiroptical properties have been investigated by experimental and computational analyses. These complexes display a tetrapyrrole dye β-substituted with an inherently chiral extended aromatic moiety suitable to establish attractive π–π interactions with nanocarbons and endowed with helical chirality, providing interesting properties for optoelectronic applications. In particular, experimental and DFT analysis highlight the possibility of an efficient electron transfer between the ethynyl–helicene moiety and the porphyrazine macrocycle, similar to what we already observed in pyrene-12 and 4-dimethylaminophenyl-substituted thioethyl porphyrazines.29 In all these cases, the HOMO orbital localized on the substituent has slightly higher energy than the standard HOMO Gouterman orbital of the tetrapyrrole. The occurrence of such helicene-to-macrocycle charge-transfer transitions makes these compounds mono-substituted push–pull systems and, thus, promising substrates for optoelectronics. After chiral HPLC separation of enantiomers of NiPzHelix, their ECD spectra have been recorded. The ECD spectra are dominated by the intense helicene spectral features, although some weaker Cotton effects allied to the Q-band transitions are visible, indicating a perturbation of the flat macrocyclic chromophore. DFT computations well reproduce the experimental spectrum, thus allowing one to assign the absolute configuration of the two eluted enantiomers. Finally, to gain better insight into the compound electronic structure, the MCD spectrum of the studied compound is also presented, being dominated by the porphyrazine moiety.
Experimental section
General

1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian INOVA 400 spectrometer, using TMS as an internal standard. GC/MS spectra were recorded on a HP 6890 gas chromatograph, equipped with a HP-5975 mass spectrometric detector. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded at the “Consorzio Interuniversitario INBB Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi” (Rome). Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel 60 Macherey–Nagel sheets. The spots were visualized by exposure to UV radiation (254 nm) and/or by spraying the plates with a potassium permanganate solution. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (Merck, Kieselgel 60, 60–230 mesh). THF was freshly distilled on sodium benzophenone ketyl under a nitrogen atmosphere before its use. Triethylamine and methanol were dried by distillation over calcium hydride and sodium, respectively, and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere. The other analytical grade solvents and commercially available reagents were used without further purification. 2-Bromo-[6]helicene,46,47 (1), [2-(bromo)-3,7,8,12,13,17,18-eptakis(ethylthio)-5,10,15,20-porphyrazine] (6a),28 and [2-(bromo)-3,7,8,12,13,17,18-eptakis(ethylthio)-5,10,15,20-porphyrazine]nickel(II) (6b)28 were prepared as previously described. UV-vis spectra were recorded in the 250–800 nm range by using a UV-vis Cary 50 spectrophotometer in 1 cm path length quartz cells and at a concentration of ca. 10−6 M in CH2Cl2.48 Emission spectra were recorded in ∼10−6 M CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature in quartz cells with an Agilent Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) experiments were performed with an EG & G Princeton Applied Research Model 263A potentiostat/galvanostat. Data were collected and analyzed by using the Model 270 electrochemical analysis system software.49 A standard three-electrode arrangement was employed. The working electrode was a glassy carbon button (∅ = 3 mm). A platinum wire served as counter electrode and a home-made AgCl/Ag electrode containing saturated KCl was used as the reference electrode. All the oxidation and reduction potentials are reported relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) potential, using the voltammetric oxidation of ferrocene as an internal reference. The reproducibility of individual potential values was within ±5 mV. All the electrochemical measurements were carried out using Schlenk techniques (N2) at room temperature. The concentration of the supporting electrolyte [N(C4H9-n)4BF4] was typically 0.15 M. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded by scanning the potential at 200 mV s−1. DPV measurements were performed at 5 mV s−1 with a pulse height of 50 mV and 50 ms pulse width. All the synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1–S14 in the ESI†).
Syntheses

2-Trimethylsilyl-ethynyl-[6]helicene (2). 
2-Bromo-[6]helicene (1) (100 mg, 246 μmol) was dissolved, under an inert atmosphere, in freshly distilled Et3N (20 mL). Trimethylsilylacetylene (51.2 μL, 370 μmol) was then dropwise added, followed by CuI (5.2 mg, 27.0 μmol) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (34.6 mg, 49.2 μmol). The mixture was heated at reflux under vigorous stirring, observing a darkening. After 3 hours, reflux was stopped and the mixture was allowed to cool at room temperature. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and filtered on Celite. The orange solution was extracted with saturated NH4Cl. The collected organic phases were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After filtration and solvent evaporation at reduced pressure the recovered orange-yellow solid was first purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane:CH2Cl2, 9:1 v/v) and later by using a preparative TLC plate (1.0 mm thickness, silica gel, hexane:CH2Cl2, 9:1 v/v).

ECD and MCD spectroscopy
ECD spectra were obtained on a Jasco 815SE spectrometer, employing a 1 mm path length quartz suprasil cuvette in 0.0007 M CH2Cl2 solution for the two enantiomers. MCD spectra were recorded on the same solutions, utilizing the special cell-holder previously designed and successfully employed,32 ensuring 0.6 T magnetic field at the center of the 1 mm quartz cuvette. Ten scans were run for each of the orientations of the magnetic field (parallel and antiparallel to the incident beam propagation) for the solutions and for the solvent, with the spectra of the latter being subtracted from the former. The final spectra in Fig. 6 are the result of the subtraction of B = 0.6 T parallel CD spectra and B = 0 CD spectra. We verified that the thus obtained MCD spectra for the M-enantiomer are equal to the spectra for the P-enantiomer.
Computational details
The TDDFT calculations were run with the Gaussian 16 package.51 As described in the ESI† and in the Discussion section, the adopted level of theory was BP86/6-31+G* level, LANL2DZ pseudopotential for Ni in the optimization step. To obtain the simulated spectra TDDFT calculations were performed based on the M06-L functional with the same basis set. The solvent was examined at the iefpcm level.

The number of exchanged electrons in each of these redox processes is also confirmed by analyzing the width of the peaks at half height in the corresponding differential small pulse amplitude voltammograms. Considering that in our pulse voltammograms obtained using a pulse amplitude of 50 mV, the measured values of the peak half widths are greater than 90.4 mV, a one-electron reduction processhas to be associated with all the studied compounds.

 	Fig. 3  Kohn–Sham orbital energy levels of NiPzHelix (left) and Ni-4 (right) and graphical representations of some more relevant orbitals. Color code refers to the type of orbital. Red: Gouterman orbital; yellow: orbital localized on Pz; green: orbital with major contribution from nickel; blue: orbital mainly localized on helicene; light blue: orbital localized on helicene and the triple bond bridge; purple: orbital on the bridge; black: delocalized orbital. All orbitals relative to these levels are represented in Fig. S17.†	 

 	Fig. 4  HPLC separation of the NiPzHelix complex on the (R,R)-WhelkO1 chiral stationary phase (c.s.p.) with a mobile phase composed of a mixture of CH2Cl2, hexane and ethanol. Upper side UV trace (black line) and lower side CD trace (blue line).	 

 	Fig. 5  Bottom: Experimental ECD spectra of the two separated enantiomers of NiPzHelix. The red line represents the first eluted enantiomer and the blue line represents the second eluted enantiomer on (R,R)-WhelkO1 c.s.p. Top: Computed ECD spectrum for the (P) enantiomer of NiPzHelix (BP86/6-31+G* optimization, M06-L/6-31+G*; iefpcm CH2Cl2, 250 states have been considered).	 

 	Fig. 6  MCD spectra of NiPzHelix (black line) recorded with parallel 0.6 T magnetic field (the M enantiomer was employed and the ECD spectrum at zero magnetic field was subtracted out) and comparison with the MCD spectrum of Ni-4 (green line).
