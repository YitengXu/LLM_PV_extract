Heterojunctions built by low-dimensional and three-dimensional perovskites (1D/3D or 2D/3D) help to improve the stability of PSCs. However, the insulated organic cations of low-dimensional perovskite impede the transport of carriers, decreasing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. Herein, we introduce an in situ cross-linking polymerizable propargylammonium (PA+) to the 3D perovskite film at surfaces and grain boundaries to form a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure. This passivation strategy not only significantly improves the interfacial carrier transport but also releases residual tensile strain in perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion PCE of 21.19%, while maintaining 93% of their initial efficiency after 3055 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions.

Broader context
Due to the fragile nature of halide perovskite materials, which are commonly sensitive to moisture, oxygen, heat, and light in the ambient environment, the stability of the absorbing layer and the relevant interfaces is the primary challenge for commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We introduce an in situ cross-linking polymerizable propargylammonium (PA+) to the 3D perovskite film at surfaces and grain boundaries to form a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure, which not only significantly improves the interfacial carrier transport but also releases residual tensile strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion PCE of 21.19%, while maintaining 93% of their initial efficiency after 3055 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions. This work is helpful to realize the PSCs’ commercial production and developing this green energy material is of great signifcence to solve the energy shortage and environmental pollution.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have attracted great attention recently due to their unique properties and compositional versatility, providing limitless space to exploit and envisage in both industry and academia.1–3 In the past few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been boosted from 3.8% to 25.2%, which is close to that of monocrystalline silicon solar cells.4–6 However, due to the fragile nature of halide perovskite materials, which are commonly sensitive to moisture, oxygen, heat, and light in the ambient environment,7,8 the stability of the absorbing layer and the relevant interfaces is the primary challenge in the commercialization of PSCs.9
To improve the stability of perovskite films, some strategies are focusing on composition adjustment or material engineering.10–12 In contrast to three-dimensional (3D) organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, low-dimensional (0–2D) perovskites show superior moisture stability due to the hydrophobicity of their large organic cations.13,14 1D and 2D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites were reported to modify the 3D perovskite absorbing layer by building 1D/3D or 2D/3D heterojunctions and passivating the crystal boundaries for the long-term ambient stability of PSCs. For example, Park and his co-workers introduced a 2D perovskite (5-AVA)2PbI4 (5-AVA: 5-ammoniumvaleric acid) passivation layer at the perovskite/CuSCN interface.15 A champion PCE of 16.75% for the unencapsulated device was reported and it retains 98% of its initial PCE after 63 days under dark conditions with the humidity of about 10%. Another example is that the 1D perovskite layer of TAPbI3 (TA: thiazole ammonium) was introduced to the top of the 3D FAMAPbI3 layer, and the corresponding device delivered a champion PCE of 18.97%, retaining 92% of the initial efficiency when stored in ambient air for 60 days.16 This indicates that low-dimensional perovskites can effectively block the pathway of water intrusion into the vulnerable 3D perovskite polycrystalline films to guarantee PSCs longer operation life.17,18 However, the stability enhancement has thus far been at the cost of the device PCE, mainly due to short carrier diffusion length, low carrier mobility and wide band gaps of as-induced low-dimensional (0–2D) perovskites.19–21 The organic spacer layers within the low dimensional perovskites act as multiple quantum wells to trap carriers,22,23 and the organic–inorganic hybrid slabs impede the migration of charge carriers because of the lower conductivity of the materials.24 Thus, despite the significantly enhanced stability, the application of low-dimensional perovskites in photovoltaics is mostly limited by the insulating spacer cations which inhibits out-of-plane charge transport.25 Consequently, it is highly desired to further improve the PCE from the perspective of enhancing the carrier transport of low-dimensional perovskites.
Besides the hydrophobic nature of low dimensional perovskites induced by A site cations, which can improve the moisture stability of the resultant device, it is important to extend the utilization of these low dimensional perovskites to improve the device lifetime in different perspectives. Recently, Huang and co-workers26 declared that relaxation of the lattice strain can effectively reduce the strain-related perovskite decomposition rate, and our group also reported that strain engineering affects the transporting dynamic of carriers and enhances the performance of PSCs.27 Moreover, Sargent and co-workers reported that the residual tensile strain was compensated by introducing an external compression strain from the ultra-thin organic hole conveyor layer and the compressive strain increases the activation energy of ion migration, which improves the stability of perovskite films.28 It is reasonable to expect that large organic cations at interfaces and grain boundaries can alter the lattice constant of the resultant perovskites to effectively release residual strain of polycrystalline films for stability improvement, which requires systematic investigation.29,30
To optimize the carrier transport of the low-dimensional perovskite with efficient residual strain release in the heterojunction, we first used the strategy of 1D perovskite combined with cross-linking to improve the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs in the field of perovskite solar cells, and the cross-linked ultra-thin 1D perovskitoid, which is in situ constructed on the 3D absorber. Most importantly, this heterostructure improves the carrier transport through the electronic conjugation formed by polymerization of PAI. First of all, we introduce a novel ultrathin PA+-based (PA+: propargylammonium) 1D “perovskitoid”24 passivation layer at 3D perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface, where the 1D perovskitoid passivation layer is formed by the excessive PbI2 present on the surface of the FAMACs mixed perovskite film reacting with the spin-coated PAI (propargylammonium iodide). Unlike corner-sharing MX6 octahedral structures in traditional perovskite, perovskiteoids have face-sharing MX6 octahedral structures. The face-sharing MX6 octahedral structures tend to stabilize (lower) the 6s2 (Pb2+) or 5s2 (Sn2+) orbital energies that typically dominate the top of the valence bands in proper perovskites.16,31 Therefore, perovskiteoids have high environmental stability. Moreover, owing to the cross-linkable alkynyl terminal, PA+ cations were cross-linked through mild thermal treatment to form polymerized propargylamine groups surrounding the 1D perovskitoid, which allows carriers to travel between 1D chains of face-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra effectively. Meanwhile, the treatment of hydrophobic PA+ also released the remnant tensile strain in 3D perovskite films, enhancing both the PCE and stability of the perovskite devices. And further cross-linking could transform the residual tensile strain of the 3D perovskite film into compression strain, which is an effective method to adjust the residual strain that has not been reported in the previous literature. We believe that this finding is one important step that provides a feasible approach to modulation of interfacial strain. In PSC devices with complete cross-linked PA+, a champion efficiency of 21.19% was achieved. Remarkably, the cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure based PSCs exhibit promising lifetime and represent the state-of-art operating stability for perovskite solar cells, which maintained 93% of their initial efficiency after 3055 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operation conditions. Our work illustrates that the cross-linked 1D perovskitoid strategy can significantly enhance both the PCEs and stability of PSCs, which is really a dual-function strategy.
Results and discussion
Formation of the 1D/3D and in situ cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure
PAI was chosen to be a possible effictive interface or grain boundary passivation molecule to improve carrier transport or an additional agent to eliminate the iodine vacancies at the interface or grain boundary of perovskite films at the beginning.32 Top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1a) show morphologies of passivated perovskite films with PAI solution with different concentrations. It can be observed that, as the spin-coated PAI solution concentration increased to 4 and 6 mg mL−1, some polycrystalline particles appeared on the surface and grain boundary of the 3D perovskite films. Besides, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of perovskite films with different concentration (0–30 mg mL−1) PAI modification showed that PAI is introducted and a novel low dimensional crystal is produced on the surface of the 3D perovskite films (Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†). As the concentration of PAI increases to 10 mg mL−1, the new XRD peaks of 11.6° and 10.4° appeared obviously, which are characteristic signals of the low dimensional perovskite crystal.

(c) Illustration of the structure for PAI based 1D perovskitoid. 
To confirm the possible sructure of this new material, we synthesized the crystal with PA+ as organic cations by using the solution method and further analyzed its crystal structure by single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). As shown in Fig. 1c, it is a crystal in 1D chains with face-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra, which is termed as “perovskitoid”, with a formula of PAPbI3. The crystallographic data is shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of this single crystal is almost identical to that of the simulated PXRD pattern, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In particluar, the characteristic peaks of 11.6° and 10.4° further comfimed the 1D perovskitoid on the surface and grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite film. Moreover, we found the obvious reduction of the PbI2 peak at 12.6° along with the increasing of the PAI concentration, proving that PAI can react with excessive PbI2 to build an ultra-thin 1D perovskitoid on the 3D perovskite film, forming a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure layer (Fig. S1, ESI†). In addition, the XRD patterns of 1D perovskite and PAI powders is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Clearly, the main diffraction peak of the PAI molecule is 26.8°, and 1D perovskitoid and PAI molecules did not find the same diffraction peak, which well confirmed the formation of 1D perovskitoid.
It is more meaningful that PA+ occurred in situ cross-linked polymerization surrounding the 1D perovskitoid after the film was heated at 150 °C for 5 min (Fig. 2a), as the terminal alkynyls are cross-linkable under thermal treatment. We further fabricated pure PA+-based 1D perovskitoid films to demonstrate their polymerization of alkenyl ammonium by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. 2b, 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed the characteristic signal of cross-linked PA+ in 1D perovskitoid films. The pristine PAI sample shows the expected alkynyl hydrogen signal at 3.63 ppm before cross-linking at 150 °C, while this chemical shift diminished with the emergence of new shifts at 6.87 and 6.44 ppm, which are the characteristic signals of vinyls. This signifcantly indicates that PA+ cross-linked after thermal treatment, as the appearance of downfield vinyl hydrogen proton signals indicates that alkynyl bonds have cross-linked to form sp2 carbons.

(c) FTIR spectra of 1D/3D films before and after cross-linking and pure PAI. The dashed lines indicate the characteristic vibration peaks of PAI. 
In FTIR spectra as shown in Fig. 2c, pure PAI molecules exhibit characteristic vibration peaks of –CH at 3245 cm−1, and –CCH groups at 2134 cm−1 before cross-linking. In 1D/3D films, the vibration peaks ascribed to –CCH all disappeared after cross-linking at 150 °C, including the C–H stretching vibration (νCH, 3245 cm−1) and C–C stretching vibration (νCC, 2134 cm−1), while the characteristic peaks of –CH3 still exist. Meanwhile, the vibration peaks ascribed to CHC appeared in the cross-linked 1D/3D films, including C–C stretching vibration (νCC, 1603 cm−1) and the C–H bending vibration (γCH, 925 cm−1). This result indicates that PA+ in the perovskite films indeed cross-linked with each other via –CCH groups when annealed at 150 °C. The peak at 2134 cm−1 is greatly weakened in 1D/3D films after cross-linking due to the polymerization of the –CCH groups. No obvious difference in XRD is observed between 1D/3D stacking and cross-linked 1D/3D stacking films (Fig. S4, ESI†), and this is similar to previous studies.33 In addition, we speculated that the cross-linking process followed the scheme of Deng et al.34 The specific process is listed in the ESI.† It is worth noting that this mechanism may not necessarily lead to the complete polymerization of PA. Given the solid state situation, it is possible that we obtain a spectrum of oligomers during polymerization. This explains why post-annealed PAI and PAI treated perovskite films can be partially dissolved in deuterated solvent, to show 1H-NMR signals. In spite of this, the cross-linked 1D/3D strategy can still improve PSC performance. We also obtained the top-view SEM images of the 1D/3D films before and after cross-linking. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), they both exhibit a pinhole free and smooth morphology with large grains, indicating that cross-linked PA+ hardly affects the morphology and crystal structure of the 1D/3D film.
Carrier transport
At first, we found that the PAI modification could effectively passivate the defect states on the surface and grain boundary in perovskite films like many other organic cations,35,36 which could be verified by decreased Urbach energy (Fig. S6, ESI†) and the PL enhancement (Fig. S7, ESI†). Furthermore, the transport behavior of carriers at the interface was investigated by time-resolved passivation of the defect states on the surface and grain boundary in photoluminescence (TRPL), space-charge-limited current (SCLC), and conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and all the measurements manifest improved hole extraction after forming a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure and the following in situ cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure. At the same time, due to the increase of interfacial carrier transport capacity, the accumulation of interfacial carriers decreases, and this is beneficial to the stability of PSCs.37
With the configuration of glass/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD and glass/perovskite stacking/spiro-OMeTAD as observed in Fig. 3a and Table S2 (ESI†), TRPL measurements show that the cross-linked 1D/3D stacking perovskite obtained the shortest average decay time of 48.34 ns. This indicates an obviously enhanced charge transport process, compared with that of a decay time of 84.71 and 142.64 ns for the 1D/3D and reference samples, respectively. SCLC measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†) show that the mobility values of the reference, 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure samples were calculated to be 6.70 × 10−4, 8.42 × 10−4 and 1.89 × 10−3 cm−2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This experimentally proves that, by heating treatment to in situ cross-link propargylamine surrounding the 1D perovskitoid, the hole mobility enhanced obviously.

(h) Linear fit of 2θ–sin2(φ) for the reference, and 1D/3D before and after cross-linking films. 
To further illustrate the interface transmission improvement by cross-linking, we also carried out the c-AFM measurement to study the film conduction through local current–voltage measurements. Fig. 3b–d show c-AFM images for the reference, 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D films under a bias voltage of 2.0 V, indicating that the 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure and in situ cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure samples gave out considerably larger conducting currents in the entire measured area than that of the reference sample.
Two semicircles in the EIS (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†) spectra describe the charge transfer behavior at the perovskite/HTL interfaces.38 The values of the series resistance (Rs),39 resemble all reference, 1D/3D stacking and in situ cross-linked 1D/3D stacking samples, excluding the effect of Rs on the FF. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) decreases significantly for the in situ cross-linked 1D/3D heterojunction compared to that of the 1D/3D sample and reference sample, indicating more efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface in the cross-linked 1D/3D sample. Moreover, the carrier collection efficiency was studied by IMPS and IMVS measurements. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), the PSC based on the cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure shows the highest ηcc values at all potential-modulating light intensities. The higher the ηcc, the more efficient a cell is, in accordance with the device performance.
Residual strain release
Residual tensile strain in perovskite films is a source of instability, and stems from the thermal expansion mismatch between perovskites and substrates during the annealing steps required in the formation of perovskites. After PAI treatment, we investigate the residual tensile strain by employing the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique with 2θ–sin2(φ) method. The FAMACs mixed perovskite film on the SnO2/ITO/glass substrate showed XRD peaks (2θ) at 14.0°, 31.6° and 40.5°, corresponding to the crystal surfaces of (001), (012) and (022), respectively.40 Among the three planes with stronger diffraction peaks, plane (012) is selected for further analysis because of its higher diffraction angle and multiplication factor, which can provide the most reliable structural symmetry information. Fig. 3e–g shows the GIXRD of the reference and 1D/3D films before and after cross-linking with respect to the (012) crystal plane. In Fig. 3e, by varying Ψ from 10° to 50°, the scattering peaks gradually shifted to the left, indicating the increase of the crystal plane distance d(012). This clearly shows that the reference film is bearing tension strain as a whole. However, Fig. 3f shows that the line of the scattering peaks is almost perpendicular to the horizontal line as Ψ from 10° to 50°, indicating that the 1D/3D film is in a strain-free environment. In addition, the scattering peak of the cross-linked 1D/3D film gradually shifted to the right (Fig. 3g), indicating that the cross-linked 1D/3D film is bearing compression strain as a whole. In general, sin2(φ) and 2θ have a linear relationship, and the slope of the fitting line is the size of the residual strain. 2θ and sin2(φ) were linear fitted with Gaussian distribution function (Fig. 3h), and the slopes of linear fit of 2θ–sin2(φ) for the reference and 1D/3D perovskite films before and after cross-linking have changed from negative to positive values. This implies that residual tensile strain in the perovskite films becomes the compressive strain. This change of strain in perovskite films is responsible for improved carrier transport26 and enhanced intrinsic perovskite stability.41,42 We speculated that PA+ organic cations entering the grain boundary could release the residual strain of perovskite thin films and interact with each other by cross-linking generating compression strain on the perovskite thin films. Therefore, PAI treatment and the subsequent cross-linking effectively released the residual tensile strain of the perovskite film, which is beneficial to both the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of PSCs.
Photovoltaic device performance
To check the influence of PAI treatment and the cross-linking strategy on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we manufactured FAMAC mixed solar cells with the modification of 1D perovskitoid with different concentrations, employing the planar stack architecture of ITO/SnO2/perovskite layer/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. As shown in Fig. 4a, the cross-sectional SEM image consists of a SnO2 layer (40 nm) as the electron transport layer (ETL) on an ITO glass substrate, a spiro-OMeTAD layer (250 nm) as the hole transport layer (HTL),43,44 an evaporated Au layer (100 nm thick) as the back electrode and a 650 nm 1D/3D heterostructure layer closely sandwiched between spiro-OMeTAD and SnO2 interlayer. We also found that the 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure layer is vertically dense without obvious cracks or pinholes, which is conducive to vertical carrier transport (Fig. 4a).

(b) I− V curves of the reference, and 1D/3D before and after cross-linking; the inset represents the stabilized current density measured at a bias voltage (0.94, 0.96 V, respectively). (c) Statistics of PCEs for devices based on the reference, and 1D/3D before and after cross-linking. (d) EQE as a function of monochromatic wavelength recorded for PSCs based on the reference, 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D. 
Based on the device structure above, the best concentration of PAI is 2 mg mL−1 for PSCs with the best performance in our case, which can achieve an average PCE of 18.13% and it is higher than that of the reference cells. Beyond this concentration, the performance of the device deteriorated, as shown in Fig. S14 and Table S3 (ESI†). Moreover, we further investigated the photovoltaic performance optimization of PSCs with 1D/3D heterojunctions before and after in situ cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4b, the 1D/3D heterostructure presented a higher PCE than that of the reference cell and the subsequent cross-linking further greatly improved the PCE. PSCs with an in situ cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure exhibit a champion efficiency of 21.19%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.11 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 23.69 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 80.76%. By holding a bias near the maximum power output point (0.96 V), a stabilized photocurrent of 21.3 mA cm−2 was obtained, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 21.7% (the inset of Fig. 4b). The PCE enhancement is attributed to the significant improvement in all the JSC, FF and VOC. Generally, the FF value is influenced by the charge recombination at the grain boundaries and interfaces and improved hole extraction after forming a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure leading to a noticeable increase in FF in the corresponding device. The histogram of three batches of cells shows the reproducibility and further verifies the PCE enhancement (Fig. 4c and Fig. S15, Table S4, ESI†). The PSCs’ external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4d. Compared to the reference device and 1D/3D device, the cross-linked 1D/3D device showed the highest light harvesting efficiency (EQE value is close to 90%) along the entire absorption wavelength range from 400 to 780 nm. The increase of JSC was originated from the improved charge collection efficiency (Fig. S13, ESI†). The integrated photocurrent density for a cross-linked 1D/3D device was calculated to be 23.5 mA cm−2, which was in good agreement with the JSC in the J − V measurement.
Long-term stability
We assessed the ISOS-D-145 stability of the nonencapsulated films and devices in ambient conditions with a humidity of about 40–70% at a temperature of about 25–40 °C. Fig. 5a presents the relative content of the PbI2 phase for the reference perovskite film, perovskite films with 1D/3D stacking layer and in situ cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure layer before and after humidity aging in air. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the reference perovskite film, 1D/3D perovskite film and cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite film before and after humidity aging in air. During the aging test (1000 h), the relative content of PbI2 was monitored by XRD,46 as it is one of the known decomposition products of perovskites. Clearly, the cross-linked 1D/3D film and 1D/3D film have a much lower PbI2 content than the reference film, showing the outstanding humidity stability of the cross-linked 1D/3D film and 1D/3D film. Furthermore, after 1500 hours of ISOS-D-1 stability test in ambient air, the 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D PSCs both retained 97% of their initial efficiency, while the PCE of the reference PSC dropped to 43% (Fig. 5b). The change of PCE value with time before normalization is shown in Fig. S17a (ESI†). In the stability test of ISOS-D-1, the initial average PCE (%) values of reference, 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D are respectively 17.47 ± 0.301, 19.35 ± 0.095 and 19.51 ± 0.071. This suggests that the 1D perovskitoid serves to improve the environmental stability of 3D perovskite-based devices, and the PA+ polymerization also acts as a hydrophobic layer to protect perovskite films. The result of ISOS-L-1 stability tests under continuous 0.8 sun illumination under a nitrogen atmosphere is shown in Fig. 5c, the photo-stabilities of the 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D PSCs are superior to that of the reference PSCs, maintaining 89.3% and 95.9% of their original PCE after 840 h of illumination, respectively. The change of PCE value with time before normalization is shown in Fig. S17b (ESI†). In the stability test of ISOS-L-1, the initial average PCE (%) values of reference, 1D/3D and cross-linked 1D/3D are respectively 17.78 ± 0.356, 18.29 ± 0.567 and 18.58 ± 0.372. Most importantly, we investigate the operational ISOS-L-1 stability of unencapsulated devices under MPP tracking with a continuous one-sun irradiation with an LED lamp under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 3055 h of MPP measurement, cross-linked 1D/3D PSCs still retain over 93% of their initial PCE (18.90%) (Fig. 5d), which is currently in the top level of operating stabilities for PSCs (Fig. S18 and Table S5 in the ESI† summarized the lifetimes of PSCs achieved in previous reports and this work). Therefore, 1D perovskitoid cooperating with the interface organic cations cross-linking strategy effectively improves the stability of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we provide here an effective method to passivate a perovskite absorber by introducing an ultra-thin 1D perovskitoid to form a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure. An in situ cross-linking strategy to create conductive species surrounding the 1D perovskitoid allows carriers to travel along the 1D chains of face-sharing [PbI6]4− octahedra efficiently. Meanwhile, the introduction of PAI and subsequent cross-linking treatment released the residual tensile strain in the perovskite films, which further improves the stability of the perovskite films. As a result, a certificated efficiency of 21.19% was obtained in the device by employing a solution-processed and cross-linkable 1D perovskitoid to form cross-linked 1D/3D heterojunctions. The cross-linked 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure based PSCs retained 93% of their original PCE after 3055 h under MPP operation conditions under continuous illumination. Our work demonstrates the usage of 1D perovskitoid featured with cross-linked organic cations to construct a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure, which enhances both the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

Broader context
Due to the fragile nature of halide perovskite materials, which are commonly sensitive to moisture, oxygen, heat, and light in the ambient environment, the stability of the absorbing layer and the relevant interfaces is the primary challenge for commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We introduce an in situ cross-linking polymerizable propargylammonium (PA+) to the 3D perovskite film at surfaces and grain boundaries to form a 1D/3D perovskite heterostructure, which not only significantly improves the interfacial carrier transport but also releases residual tensile strain in the perovskite films. As a result, the corresponding devices achieve a champion PCE of 21.19%, while maintaining 93% of their initial efficiency after 3055 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point (MPP) operating conditions. This work is helpful to realize the PSCs’ commercial production and developing this green energy material is of great signifcence to solve the energy shortage and environmental pollution.
