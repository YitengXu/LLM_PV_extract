    , Accepted 7th February 2020First published on 7th February 2020AbstractThere is a need to develop techniques for conversion of carbon dioxide to useful products such as formaldehyde, formic acid, methanol, and hydrocarbons. Carbon dioxide can be converted into these products using either photochemically, electrochemically, thermochemical or hydrogenation by bacteria. Formate is of interest due to the possibility of being used in liquid fuel cells, as an additive in pyrolysis vapors and as a precursor for biological fuels. In this work, conversion of carbon dioxide to formic acid under acidic conditions and formate under basic or neutral conditions was accomplished through photoreduction using an inexpensive setup consisting of titanium dioxide, metal phthalocyanines and inexpensive incandescent sources. The yield of formic acid based on anion chromatography was 1.54%. This work also discusses and presents a true quantum yield determined using chemical actinometry which was near 2.0%. Detailed studies of the photoreduction process showed that the amount of sensitizer, light intensity and pH affect the amount of formate generated.
Introduction
Background
The rich energy nature, availability, and stability of common fossil fuels including natural gas, petroleum, and coal have made fossil fuels primary energy sources.1,2 Industrialized countries such as the USA and China have relied greatly on the use of coal as a major energy source over the years.1,3,4 Continuous dependence on fossil fuel burning has globally increased the atmospheric concentration level of CO2, a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas, to 409.14 ppm in 2019.5 Industrialized countries are working towards reducing fossil fuel consumption for power production. Examples are use of solar, hydroelectric, nuclear and wind power.6 Carbon dioxide is a stable component of ambient air.7–9 Converting atmospheric CO2 to fuels may result in a carbon cycle that prevents atmospheric levels from increasing.9,10 Hence, there is a significant interest in technology to reduce CO2.11,12 Examples include reduction of CO2 into methane and formate for fuel cells.13 Reduction of CO2 is based on photochemical, electrochemical, thermochemical, and biological hydrogenation.14,15 This article reports work that used metal phthalocyanines (MPC) for reduction of CO2 to formic acid under acidic conditions and formate under neutral and basic conditions. Diffuse reflectance measurements and a photodiode calibrated using chemical actinometry were used to calculate a true quantum yield.
Photochemical reduction using dye sensitized TiO2
Carbon dioxide can also be reduced photocatalytically by photosensitized TiO2 systems.16 Photoreduction of CO2 to formate involves absorption of photons by a sensitizer, such as MPC, in the electronic ground state which is highly reactive.16 Absorption of light energy equal or greater than the band gap of the sensitizer initiates excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band.16 Excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO2, and electron transfer reactions occur on the surface where CO2 is adsorbed.16 Photochemical products include hydrogen and oxygen gas, formate and potentially other small chain hydrocarbons.17 This article focuses on formate as a product due to being used in fuel cells. The photoreduction process of carbon dioxide to formate under acidic medium can be represented by reactions (1)–(7).18–21 MPC + hν → MPC*(1) MPC* + TiO2 → e−·TiO2 + MPC+(2) CO2(g) + e−·TiO2 → TiO2·CO2−(ads)(3) e−·TiO2 + H+(aq) → TiO2·H(ads)(4) TiO2·CO2−(ads) + TiO2·H(ads) → TiO2·HCO2−(ads)(5) TiO2·HCOO−(ads) + H+(aq) → TiO2 + HCOOH(aq)(6) 2MPC+ + H2O → 2MPC + 2H+(aq) + 1/2O2(g)(7)Reactions (8)–(16) suggest a mechanism for photoreduction to formate when pH is equal to or greater than 7, and the TiO2 surface is known to be negatively charged.22–24 TiO− + H2O → TiOH + OH−(8) TiO2 + TiOH → TiO2·H+(ads) + TiO−(9) MPC* + TiO2·H+(ads) → MPC+ + TiO2H(ads)(10) CO2(g) + e−·TiO2 → TiO2·CO2−(ads)(11) TiO2H(ads) + TiO2·CO2−(ads) → TiO2 + TiO2·HCO2−(ads)(12) TiO2·HCO2−(ads) → TiO2 + HCO2−(aq)(13) MPC+ + OH−(aq) → MPC + OH˙(14) TiO2H(ads) + OH˙·→ TiO2·H2O(ads)(15) TiO2·H2O(ads) → TiO2 + H2O(l)(16)The sensitized titanium dioxide surface enables the photoreduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid under mild acidic conditions and formate under alkaline or neutral medium. This work explores use of TiO2 with adsorbed metal phthalocyanines for reduction of CO2 under basic, neutral and acidic conditions.
Choice of metal phthalocyanines as a photosensitizer
Physical properties of MPC depend on having a metal center and if there are substituents.25,26 They range in color from dark blue to green.26 MPC have a high melting point.27 For example, nickel phthalocyanine (NiPC) melts at 300.28 MPC are quite insoluble in water due to their π–π* conjugation system.29 They tend to be soluble in sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrofluoric, trichloroacetic acids and most organic solvents such as dichloromethane, dimethyl formide and dimethyl sulfoxide.30,31 Solubility of MPC can be improved by linking ligands with hydrophilic groups such as sulfonates,32 phosphate,33 amino,34 carboxylate,35 or carbonyl groups.36 Solubility of PCs decrease due to aggregation caused by interactions between their 18 π delocalized electrons.37 The degree of aggregation depends on the central metal ion, type of substituents on the ligands, temperature and the nature of solvent.37,38 Methods reportedly used to reduce aggregation of MPC include using water soluble groups, dendrimer and surfactant substituents as axial ligands.31,35 Such bulky substituents prevent delocalized π-electrons from interacting and reduces aggregation.39
Phthalocyanine molecules become excited when they absorb visible light between 600 and 800 nm.25,30,40–43 Excited MPC molecules can react when oxidizing agents are present and decompose.25 Photochemical decomposition of MPC in solution is regarded as a complex process due to several radicals that could be formed.25 When exposed to UV-Vis radiation, weakening of carbon–nitrogen bonds may occur resulting in photodegradation of MPC.25 One possible degradation product is phthalimide.25 The presence of a solvent influences the photostability of MPC due to interaction with PC ligands. Experiments show that electron rich ligand substituents such as hydroxyl groups, ethylene glycol, and amine increase the electron density of the carbon–nitrogen bond which enhances stability.44 The photostability of MPC also depends on the molecular structure and nature of the bond between the metal and ligands. The electronic configuration and electronegativity of PCs complexed with metal influences the carbon–nitrogen bond lengths resulting in different stabilities when illuminated with UV-Vis radiation.25 Experiments show solid MPC bind O2 or N2 causing a change in electron density distribution and polarizability within the MPC, which results in a decrease in carbon–nitrogen bond length.25
MPC have also been reportedly applied in ecology for pollution degradation.45,46 An example of this is TiO2 nanoparticles sensitized with cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) for photodegradation of 4-chlorophenol. Electrons transferred from CoPC in an excited state to TiO2 react with O2 to produce singlet O245,46 Singlet O2 then reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals.44,45 The hydroxyl radicals formed react with 4-chlorophenol to form chlorocatechol and chlorobenzoquinone.45,46 Subsequent attack of hydroxyl groups on chlorobenzoquinone results in conversion to simple acids.45,46 Due to these properties, MPC were chosen to explore photoreduction of CO2 and determine a true quantum yield.
True quantum yield
Photochemical efficiency describes the percent of absorbed photons that reduce CO2 to products. Photochemical efficiency is commonly referred to as the quantum yield (Φ) of reaction. Two photons are required to generate two electrons reducing CO2 to formate.47 Since two electrons are involved the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, the quantum yield for reduction of CO2 to formate is given by eqn (17).48,49 (17)
Quantum yield depends on intensity and wavelength of radiation.49 According to an experiment conducted on CO2 reduction using UV light (300 nm), a maximum quantum yield of 28% was obtained.49 In this experiment, 17 μmol of formic acid was formed after two hours.49 As wavelength was increased to 350 nm, the photochemical efficiency was near zero percent.49 The quantum yield of products formed per photon absorbed during natural photosynthesis is approximately 1%,50,51 while a typical artificial photoreduction of CO2 is at or less than 1%.52 An example of this is an experiment using a Ru(II)–Re(I) bridged supramolecular complex in an aqueous solution which resulted in a quantum yield of 0.2% over 24 hours of irradiation using 546 nm monochromatic light.52 Many that report quantum yields use the number of incident photons referred to as an apparent quantum yield as opposed to a true quantum yield based on the number of photons actually absorbed. An example of this is work by Kumar et al. in which they report a 1.84% quantum yield for CO2 conversion.53 They used the number of incident photons to determine an apparent quantum yield. A 1997 article by Nick Serpone correctly states that a quantum yield in heterogeneous catalysis must use the number of photons absorbed to correctly determine a quantum yield due to scattering of light.54 Experimentally determining a true quantum yield is challenging for heterogeneous systems due to scattering and reflection.54,55 This article presents a simple method for a quantum yield based on the number of absorbed photons.
This study examined use of metal phthalocyanines (copper, nickel, zinc and indium) as catalysts adsorbed to anatase TiO2. Conditions such as pH and luminous intensity were varied to determine the effect on the amount of formate generated. In this work, measurement of polychromatic incident photons in the visible range was performed using a photodiode calibrated using chemical actinometry. The photodiode was also used to measure the reflected light from the heterogenous solution and photoreactor. To account for scattering, Diffuse Reflectance measurements of the heterogeneous system using an integrating sphere were obtained.54,55 The absorbance values were used to determine a true quantum yield.
Experimental
Materials
The crystalline titanium dioxide (anatase) was purchased from Spectrum Chemical. Nickel phthalocyanine was purchased from Alfa Aesar, indium phthalocyanine (InPC) from Sigma-Aldrich, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPC) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPC) were obtained from VWR Analytical. The oxidation state of In is 3+, while Zn, Ni, Cu have oxidation states of 2+. Sulfuric acid (98%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Carbon dioxide was obtained from Airgas with a purity of 99.7%.
Photoreduction experiment
The photoreduction experiment consists of a paste formed by mixing approximately 5.0 mg of metal phthalocyanine sensitizer and 0.5 g titanium dioxide using 2–3 drops of chloroform. The supported photocatalyst was transferred into the reactor shown in ESI,† Fig. S1 using 50.0 mL of an aqueous 1.0 mM sulfuric acid. The solution was saturated with CO2 gas by bubbling vigorously for 30 minutes (flow rate approximately 50–80 sccm).
Quantifying formate
In ion chromatography, formic acid is quantified as formate due to the sodium carbonate basic mobile phase. Formate analysis was determined by ion chromatography using a Metrohm 930 IC. Sodium carbonate, 3.6 mM, was used as the eluent with a flow rate of 0.7 mL min−1 and sulfuric acid 0.5 M (Acros Organics) as a regenerant. The anion column was maintained at 45 °C. A 1000 ppm formate stock solution was purchased from VWR Analytical. The IC was calibrated using 50.0 ppm, 10.0 ppm, 5.00 ppm, and 1.00 ppm formate standard solutions prepared in 1.0 mM sulfuric acid. Formate standards were injected using a 10.0 mL syringe to fill a 20 μL sample loop. The retention time for formate was found to be 4–5 minutes. Peak areas for formate standards were used to generate a calibration curve.
Effect of pH
Carbon dioxide was converted to formic acid under acidic conditions and formate under neutral to basic conditions. To determine the change in hydrogen ion concentration of the acidic medium used over 96 hours, pH measurements were performed using a Vernier pH probe calibrated with pH 4.0 and 7.0 buffer solutions. The pH measurements were performed before irradiation with light and at 24 hour intervals during the photoreduction process. Also, the effect of pH on reduction was explored. A solution of 1.0 M NaOH was used to adjust pH from 3.0 to 5.0 before combining with ZnPC, TiO2 and saturated with CO2 for 30 min. The mixture was illuminated using 150 Watt (W) incandescent light source for 96 hours. Formate yield was quantified using IC at 24 hour intervals. The procedure was repeated using pure water at a pH of 7.0 and 1.0 mM NaOH having a pH of 11.0.
Effect of light intensity
To determine the effect of light intensity on the yield of formate, mixtures of 0.5 g TiO2, 5.0 mg ZnPc, and 50 mL 1.0 mM H2SO4 was saturated CO2 and illuminated with a 45 W, 150 W or 200 W incandescent light source for 24 hours. All incandescent light sources had a color temperature of 2800 K meaning same spectral output (warm white) but different lumens (400, 2740 and 3650 lumens respectively). The temperature of 50 mL of water was measured using each light source. Due to warming of the solution and to determine if heat resulted in reduction of CO2, the experiment was repeated at a constant temperature of 26.00 ± (0.01) °C using a temperature controlled water bath without irradiation for 24 hours.
UV-visible diffuse reflectance studies
Samples were also prepared for diffuse reflectance measurements. This consisted of test tubes each containing 0.5 g of TiO2, 3 mL of 1.0 mH H2SO4 and InPC varying from 10–50 mg. All samples were sent to East Central University, Ada, Oklahoma for Diffuse UV-Visible Reflectance absorption measurements. This work was performed by Dr Dwight Myers using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere.
Calibration of photodiode for true quantum yield
The quantum yield of formate involved determining the number of moles of formate generated and the number of absorbed photons. Incident photons from the 150 W incandescent light source was determined using a Hamamatsu S2387 33R Si photodiode with a surface area of 5.7 mm2. Chemical actinometry using a potassium iron oxalate solution was used to calibrate the photodiode as a visible polychromatic photon counter.56
A 0.2 M potassium ferrioxalate solution, K3Fe(C2O4)3, was prepared by mixing 4.2 g KOH, 0.262 g FeCl3 and 3.375 g oxalic acid (H2C2O4) in the dark. Additional H2C2O4 was added until a clear green solution of K3Fe(C2O4)3 was obtained. The green solution was diluted to 1.0 L with 5.16 g concentrated sulfuric acid and water. A buffer solution (pH = 5.0) was also prepared by mixing 24.8 g NaOH with 60.3 g glacial acetic acid and diluted to 1.0 L. The K3Fe(C2O4)3 solution, 1.1 mL, was added to a beaker with 4.1 mL 0.1% 1,10-phenanthroline solution, 0.61 mL buffer solution and diluted with 4.5 mL deionized water serving as blank. Approximately 3.5 mL of the K3Fe(C2O4)3 solution was illuminated for 5 hours with a calibrated monochromator set at 514 nm. Of the 3.5 mL, 1.2 mL was mixed with 4.1 mL 0.1% 1,10-phenanthroline solution, 1.0 mL buffer solution and 4.1 mL deionized water. This solution results in the iron 1,10-phenanthroline complex which absorbs light at 514 nm. The absorbance of the blank and sample was measured at 514 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorbance for the iron phenanthroline complex. The difference in absorbance is used to calculate the number of emitted photons. The calibrated photodiode was used to measure the current generated when illuminated by the 150 W incandescent permitting calculating the number of emitted polychromatic photons.
This method works by photons being absorbed by the actinometry solution resulting in oxidation of oxalate to CO2 and reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Iron 1,10-phenanthroline forms an orange complex with Fe2+. Absorbance measured at 514 nm, volume of solution and time of radiation permit calculating polychromatic photons absorbed per second. A calibrated monochromator was used to isolate radiation at 514.0 ± 0.2 nm from the light source for which the quantum yield of the potassium iron oxalate solution is known to be 0.93. While this wavelength is not near the wavelength of maximum absorbance for phthalocyanines, approximately 680 nm, the sensitivity of the photodiode is 0.2 and 0.5 at 400 and 800 nm respectively. Assuming an ideal sensitivity of 0.5 across the visible range, an area ratio of the sensitivity of the photodiode in this region can correct for the number photons measured by the photodiode. This area ratio is used to correct the constant for the photodiode in units of einsteins A−1 s−1. This calculation is shown in detail in the ESI.†
Determining the number of incident photons
The current generated by the illuminated photodiode was measured using a simple digital multimeter connected to the leads of the photodiode such that current was a positive numeric measurement. The current resulting from direct illumination of the photodiode and current from reflected light were subtracted. This current difference, photodiode constant and time of illumination was used to calculate the number of photons incident to the heterogeneous solution.
Determining absorbed photons and true quantum yield
Absorbance spectra using the integrated sphere technique were integrated to determine area. The ratio of the difference in area of MPC/TiO2 and TiO2 only divided by MPC/TiO2 multiplied by the number of true incident photons was used to determine the number of absorbed polychromatic photons. The true quantum yield calculation is presented in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Calibration of IC for formate
Formate standards were analyzed using the IC to develop the calibration curve shown in Fig. 1. A 1.00 ppm formate standard was measured four times to calculate the limit of detection and limit of quantitation. Three times the standard deviation and ten times the standard deviation of the peak area divided by the calibration slope resulted in a limit of detection of 0.289 ppm and limit of quantification of 0.964 ppm respectively.

Effect of sensitizer and reaction rate

Fig. 2 shows the effect of modifying TiO2 with sensitizers CuPC, NiPC, ZnPC, and InPC on the amount of formate obtained carrying out photoreduction using a 150 W incandescent source. InPC gave the highest amount of formate, 23.5 ppm. CuPC resulted in the lowest amount of formate after illumination for 96 hours, 13.9 ppm. Also, photoreduction of CO2 to formate does not seem to occur when TiO2 is used alone as a blank without a metal phthalocyanine. Titanium dioxide as photocatalyst does not absorb radiation within the visible region, therefore it requires a sensitizer to extends its light absorption to visible region.57,58 The metal phthalocyanine alone also results in an undetectable amount of formate. No formate was obtained using a catalyst and photosensitizer, without irradiation for 96 hours. Fig. 2 also shows that the amount of formate generated in the dark is very low compared to the amount of formate when using visible radiation. The maximum amount of formate obtained after 96 hours was 23.5 ppm using InPC. This result shows that light radiation is essential for reduction of CO2 to formate in the photoreduction process. Table 2 shows the reaction rates based on Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Amount of formate and use of CuPC, NiPC, ZnPC and InPC. 
According to Table 1, photoreduction of CO2 to formate using InPC and ZnPC, the photochemical reaction rate was statistically faster compared to use of NiPC and CuPC. The variation in the rate of formate produced using different sensitizers can be attributed to a different degree of aggregation in each phthalocyanine. InPC has the lowest degree of aggregation compared to other PC's used in this work. This results in a higher probability of π–π* transitions in InPC when illuminated with visible radiation.59,60 The result is greater electron transfer to the conduction band of TiO2 enhancing electron transfer reactions. This accounts for the greater amount of formate generated by InPC compared to NiPC, ZnPC and CuPC.

Effect of luminous intensity and temperature

Fig. 3 shows the amount of formate obtained in photoreduction of CO2 in 50 mL of 1.0 mM sulfuric acid with TiO2 and ZnPC using 45, 150 and 200 W sources for 24 hours. From Fig. 3, after 24 hours of irradiation, no formate peak was obtained using a 45 W light source. This result can be attributed to the fact that the number of photons absorbed by the heterogenous system was too low to result in a significant amount of formate that can be detected or quantified by the IC. An increase in luminous intensity is consistent with an increase in the amount of formate produced. Also, no formate was obtained when the heterogenous solution was heated at 26 °C for 24 hours without irradiation. This shows that the amount of heat absorbed by solution has no effect on photoreduction of CO2 to formate.
 Fig. 3  Effect of luminous intensity on the amount of formate generated. 
Effect of the amount of sensitizer
Although the presence of MPC catalyzes the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, the TiO2/MPC ratio is also key. The effect of the amount of InPC in mg added to 0.5 g TiO2 at a pH of 3 was explored. According to Table 2, higher amounts of InPC result in a decrease in the amount of formate. Using amounts of MPC less than 5 mg did not show any further increase in the amount of formic acid present. This trend could be due to a greater ratio of the amount of InPC to TiO2 causing π stacking of InPC rings forming dimers which decreases absorbance and thus photochemical ability.61 Amounts less than 5 mg did not show any further increase in the amount of formic acid present (Fig. 4).

pH effect on photoreduction
The effect of pH of aqueous solution on the amount of formic acid produced (at pH of 3, 5) and formate (at pH of 7, 11) was investigated. These results are shown in Fig. 5. The amount of formate decreases as pH approaches neutral conditions. A solution of pH 3.0 gave the highest yield of formate (16.6 ppm). A solution with a neutral pH resulted in the lowest amount of formate, (3.8 ppm). Photoreduction of CO2 also occurs under alkaline conditions but the amount of formate is lower compared to acidic conditions. This result is consistent with literature.18 This result may be attributed to the difference in solubility and equilibrium of CO2 in acidic, basic and neutral medium and desorption in acidic medium.62,63

Visible absorbance of actinometry solution

Fig. 5 shows the visible absorption spectrum of the green potassium iron(III) oxalate solution before and after illumination following treatment with buffer and 1,10-phenanthroline. The wavelength of maximum absorption of potassium iron(III) oxalate in solution was found to be approximately 410 nm. The wavelength of maximum absorption of iron(II) 1,10-phenanthroline in solution is approximately 514 nm.
Diffuse UV-Vis measurements
The absorption area obtained using 0.5 g TiO2/10 mg InPC and 0.5 g TiO2 only in Fig. 6 was integrated using logger pro 3.10.1 software within 350–750 nm visible range.

Stoichiometric yield at a pH of 3
Henry's law was used to determine a stoichiometric yield for formate at a pH of 3 due to obtaining the highest amount of formate at this pH. Henry's law describes the relationship between partial pressure and aqueous concentration in pure water and is given in eqn (18).64 PCO2 = kH[CO2(aq)](18)where ‘PCO2’ represents pressure of atmospheric CO2 in atm, and ‘kH’ is Henry's constant for CO2 in atm/M at room temperature (29 atm/M).65 As CO2 dissolves in water, bicarbonate and carbonate ions are formed through dissociation of carbonic acid. As such, Henry's constant requires modification to account for pH, especially under basic conditions. At a pH of 3 there is no correction to Henry's constant needed due to the low acid dissociation constants of carbonic acid.65 At 1.00 atm the calculated concentration of aqueous CO2 is 0.034 M in pure water, which is 1530 ppm formate. Using the experimental yield of formate after 96 hours of illumination of the TiO2/InPC system (23.5 ppm), and the theoretical yield (1530 ppm) results in a stoichiometric yield of 1.54%.
True quantum yield
A Hamamatsu S2387 33R photodiode was calibrated using the potassium iron oxalate actinometry method using eqn (19).56 (19)Nq is moles of incident photons in einsteins per second. The quantity ΔA is the change in absorbance of the iron 1,10-phenanthroline complex before and after illumination. The term (λ) is the quantum yield for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ ion, which is 0.93 for a 0.2 M potassium iron oxalate solution using 514 nm radiation. The quantity V1 is volume of K3Fe(C2O4)3 solution irradiated, V2 is volume of solution analyzed after irradiation, V3 is total volume of the solution after adding 0.1% 1,10-phenanthroline buffer solution and water, ε (514 nm) is the molar absorption coefficient of the iron 1,10-phenanthroline complex (11100 L mol−1 cm−1), l is optical pathlength and t is irradiation time in seconds. Table 2 shows absorbance values before and after illumination.
The number of einsteins per s, the photodiode current measured (1.8 μA), given area of the photodiode (5.7 mm2) and incident area of heterogeneous solution (3500 mm2) enabled determination of a constant such that current and number of incident polychromatic photons are proportional. Additionally, the change in intensity of the source as a function of wavelength and sensitivity of the photodiode means that the number of einsteins per s needs to be corrected. The photodiode increases in sensitivity linearly from 0.2 A W−1 at 400 nm to 0.5 A W−1 at 800 nm as given in the data sheet for the photodiode. Assuming an ideal sensitivity of 0.5 A W−1 across the visible range, an area ratio (0.7) of the sensitivity of the photodiode from approximately 400 to 800 nm corrects the current from the photodiode for counting polychromatic photons. These two ratios and photodiode current was used to calculate the photodiode constant which was 3.2 ± 0.4 × 10−3 einsteins (A s)−1.
The calibrated photodiode was illuminated directly by the 150 W incandescent source and the direct current (183 μA) was measured using a multimeter. The photodiode was also used to measure the reflected light from the heterogeneous solution and photoreactor (165 μA). However, the number of photons from an incandescent source varies with wavelength introducing error in the current measurement. This error for the light source was determined by taking 18.27 lumens per Watt for the 150 W incandescent source and dividing by 680 lumens per Watt, which is 100% luminous efficiency at 556 nm. When this ratio is multiplied by the 150 W source 4.03 J s−1 is obtained. Using this value, assuming a near linear response of the photodiode to photons, and the relationship between energy and frequency, the number of photons per s at 400 and 740 nm varies from 8.09 × 1018 to 1.42 × 1019 photons per s. These two values have an average and range of 1.2 ± 0.4 × 1019 photons per s. This range represents a relative error of 33% for the number of photons measured from 400 to 740 nm. This relative error was applied to the current output of the photodiode and propagated to find the number of einsteins of photons incident to the heterogeneous solution (5.0 ± 1.8 × 10−3 einsteins).
Integrated absorbance area from diffuse reflectance of the metal and phthalocyanine TiO2 solutions were used to determine the number of photons absorbed. The areas for 0.5 g TiO2 in 50 mL of 1.0 mM H2SO4 only and with 10, 20 and 50 mg of InPC were 811.27, 957.19, 984.68, and 1086.85 respectively. To account for absorption of photons due to the added InPC only, the absorbance area of TiO2 only was subtracted from the area with InPC and divided by the area of TiO2 and InPC. Using 0.5 g TiO2 and 10 mg InPC, the number of absorbed photons was 7.6 ± 2.7 × 10−4 einsteins. The amount of formate obtained using 0.5 g TiO2 with 5 mg of InPC and irradiation in 50 mL solution for 24 hours was determined to result in 3.6 ± 0.2 ppm formate, which is 8.0 ± 1.3 × 10−6 moles of formate.
The true quantum yield of formate for using 0.5 g TiO2 and 5 mg InPC was found to be 1.9 ± 0.7%, 1.8 ± 0.7% and 1.7 ± 0.6% after 48, 72 and 96 hours of irradiation respectively. The results indicate that quantum yield is identical within error from 24 to 96 hours of illumination. If the number of incident photons were used (5.0 ± 1.8 × 10−3 einsteins), this would result in a quantum yield of 0.32, which is much lower that the true quantum yield. Taking scattering into account to determine the number of absorbed photons results in a more accurate quantum yield.
Conclusions
Photoreduction of CO2 to formate under acidic conditions using solid TiO2 and MPC's is possible as quantified by ion chromatography. The amount of formate produced depends on wavelength, luminosity, metal sensitizer, pH, and time of radiation. The order of aggregation of sensitizers in solution used increases in the following manner: InPC > ZnPC > NiPC > CuPC. Aggregation of PCs limit the injection of electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 surface reducing electron transfer reactions.60,66 Also, saturation of CO2 in acidic medium gave a higher yield when compared to basic or neutral conditions. Though photolysis of water produces protons required for the reduction process, more protons are present for photoreduction of CO2 to formate under acidic conditions. The amount of formate increases over time with visible radiation. The true quantum yield of photoreduction of CO2 to formic acid (acidic conditions) was determined to be 2.1 ± 0.8% after 24 hours and within error is similar to the stoichiometric yield, 1.54%. The obtained true quantum yield is higher than if the number of incident photons was used (apparent yield), 0.32%. By using diffuse reflectance measurements and a photodiode, a simple method for calculating a true quantum yield results in higher quantum yields when carrying out heterogeneous catalysis. This is due to the diffuse reflectance measurements which permit determining absorbance which accounting for scattering by solid particles in the system. For photocatalysis to be successful on an industrial scale converting large amounts of CO2, pilot plant studies are needed using air as a source to determine feasibility. These studies should also determine reusability of the catalyst.
