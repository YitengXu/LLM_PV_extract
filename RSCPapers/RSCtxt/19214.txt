    , Accepted 4th August 2019First published on 9th August 2019AbstractIn this work, the structural, optoelectronic, and defect properties of both the α-phase and β-phase CsPbI2Br are investigated based on first-principles calculations. First, we calculate the bandgap of α-CsPbI2Br using the standard HSE06 method which is in accordance with the experimental bandgap value of 1.9 eV. We also find that α-CsPbI2Br shows comparable optoelectronic properties to CsPbI3. More intriguingly, our calculated results show that both α-phase and β-phase CsPbI2Br possess better thermal and phase stability than CsPbI3 due to the mixture of halide elements, and the optical absorption coefficient of CsPbI2Br also resembles that of CsPbI3 and MAPbI3 due to the lone pair electrons of Pb. Furthermore, the formation energies and transition energy levels of intrinsic point defects indicate that CsPbI2Br exhibits unipolar self-doping behavior (p-type conductivity) and similarly good defect tolerance while the dominant defect changes. Therefore, our present work provides fundamental understanding of the great performance of CsPbI2Br thin films and offers strategies for designing more superior CsPbI2Br-based devices.
Introduction
In the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with the chemical formula ABX3 (where A represents a monovalent cation, B is a divalent group-IVA cation and X is a halogen anion) have been in the spotlight as a promising photovoltaic technology for efficient solar energy harvesting.1–4 The current certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has reached 23.7% (December, 2018).4 However, the poor long-term device stability of PVSCs under heat and humidity conditions is still a challenge for the practical commercial application of PVSCs.5–7 Therefore, various approaches have been developed to overcome this serious issue, such as improvements in the interface structure,8,9 optimization of deposition techniques,10,11 and compositional engineering.12 Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that mixing a small amount of inorganic cations such as Cs+ with methylammonium (CH3NH3+, i.e., MA+)/formamidinium (CH3(NH2)2+, i.e., FA+) at the A site can significantly increase the stability of perovskite films.13–16 Research on all-inorganic halide perovskites CsPbX3 has soared recently due to their comparable photovoltaic performance but better stability, ultrahigh photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY), and composition dependent luminescence covering the whole visible region with narrow line-width.17–24 Meanwhile, chemical adjustment of compositional elements, especially mixing multiple halogen elements at the X site, has been verified as an effective method to further enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability.25–30
More recently, all-inorganic cesium lead mixed-halide perovskites CsPbIxBr3−x, especially CsPbI2Br systems, have been found to have excellent thermal stability and desirable optoelectronic properties for high-efficiency solar cells and other optoelectronic device applications, such as a suitable direct bandgap, a broad absorbing spectrum in the solar region, notable stability toward light soaking and thermal aging, low defect density and long carrier lifetime.31–39 In 2018, Luo et al.34 developed a sequential chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to fabricate colorful, bandgap tunable, and stable CsPbIxBr3−x films. In addition, Li et al.35 developed a nonstoichiometric method to fabricate CsPbI3−xBrx (x < 1) films by adding excess CsBr to the precursor and found that the phase transition from the α-phase to δ-phase was suppressed. Moreover, Li's36 group used a gradient thermal annealing (GTA) method to control the growth of α-CsPbI2Br crystals and then utilized a green anti-solvent (ATS), isopropanol, to further optimize the morphology of the α-CsPbI2Br film. PVSCs based on this CsPbI2Br film achieved a record PCE of 16.07% (stabilized efficiency of 15.75%), which is the highest efficiency reported for all-inorganic PVSCs to date. Thus, it is highly required to prepare high-quality all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite films and explore the fundamental properties including optoelectronic properties and defect physics in order to further improve the performance of CsPbI2Br solar cells.
Defect properties, especially the intrinsic point defects in a semiconductor, are crucial to device performance. First-principles calculations have long been used to understand defect properties of semiconductors.40–42 Yin et al.43 and Li et al.44 have systematically studied the defect properties of the all-inorganic perovskite semiconductor cubic CsPbI3, respectively. The results showed that CsPbI3 exhibits unipolar self-doping behavior (p-type conductivity), which distinguishes it from organic–inorganic MAPbI3. However, the theoretical study of optoelectronic and defect properties in CsPbI2Br has not yet been reported. Therefore, it is needed to explore the basic structural, electronic and optical properties and defect physics of CsPbI2Br.
In this paper, we present a systematic study on the structural, optoelectronic, and point defect properties of mixed-halide CsPbI2Br based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. First, we investigate the geometric structures and calculate the decomposition energies compared to the competitive phases of a binary compound. It is found that the decomposition energies of CsPbI2Br are lower than those of CsPbI3 counterparts due to smaller Br ions compared to I. Second, we reveal the electronic properties of CsPbI2Br using the PBE method and HSE06 correction in combination with the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect, respectively. The DFT calculated bandgap of cubic CsPbI2Br is in line with the observed experimental one. Furthermore, the stable chemical potential window, transition energy levels and formation energies of intrinsic defects are systematically investigated. It shows that the presence of Br ions affects the formation of dominant defects in CsPbI2Br. Additionally, the optical absorption of CsPbI2Br is also calculated and compared with that of CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 and MAPbI3. Our results provide useful guidance and new insights for understanding the experimental results of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) based PVSCs and designing appropriate growth approaches to fabricate high-performance CsPbX3 solar cells.
Results and discussion
The structural parameters of materials are crucial in determining the performance in the application of optoelectronic devices. According to relevant literature reports, CsMI3 (M = Pb and Sn) exhibits four phases: cubic (α-phase), tetragonal (β-phase) and two orthorhombic phases (the black γ and the non-perovskite yellow δ-phase).45–47 At finite temperatures, the room temperature yellow δ-phase is the most stable phase for CsPbI3, but the bandgap of the high temperature α-phase is more suitable for solar cell applications. More intriguingly, previous research reported that on cooling, the perovskite structure remains kinetically stabilized converting to the black perovskite β- and γ-phases at 260 and 175 °C, respectively.48 Hence, in this work, we mainly investigate the α- and β-phase CsPbI2Br because of their suitable bandgap, considering that there is no experimental crystal data information about CsPbI2Br yet. In this work, we first construct the crystal structure of α-CsPbI3 (space group Pmm) and β-CsPbI3 (space group P4/mbm, simulated from β-CsSnI3 (ref. 46 and 49)), then replace an I atom with a Br atom on the basis of relaxed CsPbI3 structures to obtain CsPbI2Br structures. Fig. 1 shows the crystal structures of CsPbI2Br with the lattice parameters labelled. The crystal structures are visualized using the software VESTA.50 It should be noted that only α-phase CsPbI2Br can be observed experimentally, and no other phase of CsPbI2Br is detected.36,37 The optimized lattice parameters are a = 6.40 Å, b = 6.40 Å, c = 5.97 Å for α-CsPbI2Br and a = 8.95 Å, b = 8.95 Å, c = 6.03 Å for β-CsPbI2Br. They are in good agreement with previous experimental51,52 and theoretical studies,27,53 indicating that our optimization method is reasonable and reliable. It is worth noting that the optimized lattice parameter c is slightly smaller than a and b in both α- and β-CsPbI2Br, leading to the so called pseudo-cubic and pseudo-tetragonal phase, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, the bond length of Pb–Br (2.98 Å) is slightly smaller than that of Pb–I (3.21 Å) due to the ionic radius of Br being less than that of I. This is the main reason why the stability of the mixed-halide compounds could be enhanced. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor is a reliable and empirical index to predict the stability of halide perovskites.54 The effective tolerance factor (teff) (based on the Shannon radius, Cs1+ 1.88 Å, Pb2+ 1.19 Å, I1− 2.20 Å, and Br1− 1.96 Å)55 of CsPbI2Br (0.855) is slightly larger than that of CsPbI3 (0.847), but still outside the range between 0.9 and 1.0, which is predicted to form stable perovskite phases. The enhanced teff is consistent with the enhanced phase-stability observed experimentally.

Calculated energy band structures of CsPbI2Br based on PBE (blue dotted lines) and HSE06 (red solid lines) methods, respectively: (c) α-phase and (d) β-phase. The Fermi level is set to be 0 eV denoted as a black dashed line. 
 Fig. 2  At the ideal conditions of perovskite AMX3, the ionic size meets the condition of (rA + rX)/2(rM + rX) = 1. In this case, the ideal lattice constant is 2 × (rM + rX). The undersized A atom will shrink the ideal lattice constant, and the oversized A atom will expand the ideal lattice constant. From this figure, we can see that the lattice constants of CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br and CsPbBr3 are smaller than the ideal lattice constants indicating that (rCs + rI)/2 (rPb + rI) < 1. 
To understand the electronic structure properties, both PBE and HSE06 methods are employed to calculate the energy band structures of CsPbI2Br, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(c and d). We can see that α-phase CsPbI2Br has a direct bandgap with a value of 1.49 eV(PBE) and 1.94 eV(HSE06), respectively, while both the valence-band maximum (VBM) and the conduction-band minimum (CBM) are located at the R(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) point. Similarly, the calculated results indicate that β-phase CsPbI2Br has a direct bandgap of 1.74 eV(PBE) and 2.30 eV(HSE06) in which both the VBM and CBM are situated at the Z(0, 0, 0.5) point. Moreover, the spin–orbital coupling (SOC) effect in CsPbX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) can be significant because of the heavy element Pb. For an accurate description of bandgaps, PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC calculations are also considered in our calculation, summarized in Table S2.† The calculated results show that the standard HSE06 gives the experimental bandgap without any underestimation, indicating that the HSE06 method without SOC is suitable to describe the CsPbI2Br system. Computational testing shows that 63% HSE06 + SOC can get the same result as the experimentally measured gap (1.91 eV).36,37 Therefore, we use the HSE06 without SOC calculations to further analyze the electronic structure of CsPbI2Br in order to save computing time.
To understand the origin of the CBM and VBM, we plotted site-projected band structures and total density of state (TDOS) corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) with the energy range between −10 eV and 10 eV based on HSE06 calculations, as shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3(a and c), for both α- and β-phases, the VBM is manly contributed by the I 5p orbital, and the contribution from Br 4p is much lower than that of I, while the CBM is manly contributed by the Pb 6p state. As shown in Fig. 3(b and d), for both phases, the PDOS results show that the VBM consists of Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding states, while the CBM is composed mainly of Pb 6p orbitals, and Cs has no significant contribution to the band edges, which are similar to the results seen in CsPbI3 (ref. 43) and CH3NH3PbI3.56 It is worth noting that for CsPbI2Br, different phases possess similar electronic structures.

The blue, red, and green circles represent the electron orbits of Pb, I, and Br atoms, respectively; the size of the circle represents the weight of the orbit. The Fermi level is set to be 0 eV and denoted as a black dashed line. 
Next, we examined the stability of CsPbI2Br by calculating the decomposition energy Ed with respect to the decomposed binary components (CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2, according to ref. 36 and 37)36,37 using the following equation: Ed = E(CsPbI2Br) − E(CsI) − E(PbI2) − E(PbBr2)(1)whereE(CsPbI2Br), E(CsI), E(PbI2) and E(PbBr2) are the total energies of bulk CsPbI2Br, CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2, respectively. The lower the decomposition energy, the more stable the structure. The calculated decomposition energies are 0.05, −0.01 and −0.04 eV for α-, β- and δ-phase CsPbI3, respectively. These results are very close to the 0.04, −0.09 and −0.16 eV for α-, β- and δ-phase CsPbI3 reported by Yin et al.43 and also consistent with the trend of formation energies for α-, β-, γ- and δ-phase CsPbI3 reported by Sutton et al.49 Furthermore, the calculated decomposition energies are −0.04, −0.06 and −0.11 eV for α-, β- and γ-phase CsPbI2Br, respectively, showing a slight decrease compared to those of CsPbI3. Therefore, CsPbI2Br phases are more stable than CsPbI3, which is favorable in solar cell applications.

Fig. 4 shows the calculated chemical potential window of β-phase CsPbI2Br (see computational methods in the ESI†), in which, CsPbI2Br is stabilized against possible competitive phases including Pb, I2, CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2. The chemical potential window polyhedron has a long but narrow shape, indicating that the chemical growth conditions should be carefully controlled to form a pure CsPbI2Br phase and avoid impurity phases, similar to the Pb-based halide perovskites.56,57 In addition, the stability regions of CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in the chemical potential window polyhedron are much larger than those of I2 and Br2, indicating that these secondary phases are more competitive than other phases. These results also explain the difficulty of synthesis of the pure CsPbI2Br phase. The higher (ΔCs, ΔI, and ΔBr) side of the polyhedron (i.e., the DEF side) indicates Pb-, I-, and Br-rich/Cs-poor chemical conditions, and the lower (ΔCs, ΔI, and ΔBr) side (i.e., the ABC side) means Pb-, I-, and Br-poor/Cs-rich chemical conditions, as shown in Fig. 4(b and c). Here, we qualitatively chose the DEF slice (ΔμI = −1.45 eV, see Fig. 4c) for discussion, where all intrinsic defects have positive ΔH, as Br-rich conditions for the following calculations of defect formation energies. The transition energy levels of all possible intrinsic defects were calculated and plotted between different charge states relative to the VBM and CBM, as shown in Fig. 5. The point defects include four vacancies (VCs, VPb, VI, and VBr), four interstitial sites (Csi, Pbi, Ii, and Bri), two cation substitutions (CsPb and PbCs), and eight antisite substitutions (CsI, CsBr, PbI, PbBr, ICs, IPb, BrCs, and BrPb). For both α- and β-CsPbI2Br, only six point defects induce deep transition levels: ICs, IPb, BrCs, BrPb, PbBr, and PbI. All other defects are found to create shallow levels. It may further be stated that PbCs, Pbi, VBr, VI, Csi, CsBr and CsI are shallow donors, whereas VCs, VPb, Bri, Ii and CsPb are shallow acceptors.

The polyhedron shows the region where CsPbI2Br is stabilized against possible competing phases, including Pb, I2, CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2. The slices at (b) ΔμI = 1.44 eV and (c) ΔμI = 2.0 eV are also shown, where the allowed regions (grey) are surrounded by CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2. 
 Fig. 5  The transition energy levels for intrinsic acceptors (blue line) and intrinsic donors (red line) in CsPbI2Br: (a) α-phase and (b) β-phase, respectively. 
Moreover, the formation energies ΔH for the above point defects were calculated. All donor defects have higher formation energy, consistent with the experimental finding that most samples show p-type conductivity. Here, two representative chemical potential points in Fig. 4 were chosen for the following discussion, and these points represent different growth environments: A (ΔCs = −2.97 eV, ΔPb = −3.57 eV, ΔI = −2.54 eV, and ΔBr = −3.10 eV, denoted as “Br-poor/Cs-rich”) and D (ΔCs = −4.06 eV, ΔPb = −5.75 eV, ΔI = −1.45 eV, and ΔBr = −2.01 eV, denoted as “Br-rich/Cs-poor”). The calculated ΔH values of the intrinsic defects as a function of EF at these chemical points are plotted in Fig. 6(a and b). Under the Br-poor conditions, VBr has the lowest ΔH over essentially the whole EF region and is the dominant defect. Bri also has low ΔH, indicating that Br atoms can move more easily than other atoms in the lattice of CsPbI2Br. The Fermi level is pinned at 1.03 eV above the VBM (i.e., 0.71 eV below the CBM) by VBr and Ii, and thus CsPbI2Br can be tuned from p-type to the intrinsic semiconductor. Under the Br-rich conditions, the ΔH values of the dominant acceptor Bri and the dominant donor VPb intersect at a p-type EF of 0.18 eV above the VBM (i.e., 1.56 eV below the CBM), where the EF is pinned by the formation of compensating Bri and VPb2+ charged defects, indicating a compensated p-type conductivity. Thus avoiding the Br-poor conditions can help to reduce the defect concentration. These theoretical results show that the formation energy of dominant defects under Br-rich growth conditions is much lower than that under Br-poor conditions. Thus, the electrical properties of CsPbI2Br can range from intrinsic to p-type, depending on the growth conditions. It is suggested that the CsPbI2Br films should be synthesized under the Br-rich conditions in order to realize good p-type conduction and maximize the photovoltaic performance. These six defects with deep transition levels have large formation energies, suggesting that the concentrations of these defects should be low. Therefore, CsPbI2Br is expected to exhibit good electronic quality.

The optical absorption coefficient determines the capability of the light absorber and therefore is critical for solar energy harvesting. Using the PBE method, we have investigated the optical absorption spectra for CsPbI2Br, as well as for CsPbI3, CsPbBr3 and MaPbI3, for comparison, as shown in Fig. 7. For the α-phase, it is seen that the shapes of the three curves are very close, where the light absorption coefficient shows a red-shift as the structure of perovskite changes from CsPbBr3 to CsPbI3. The optical absorption coefficient of CsPbI2Br is very slightly weaker than that of CsPbI3 but much higher than that of CsPbBr3 within the visible light range (1.55–3.1 eV). Interestingly, for the β-phase, the optical absorption coefficient of CsPbI2Br is greater than that of both CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3. Moreover, for both α- and β-phases, the optical absorption coefficient of CsPbI2Br is smaller than that of MAPbI3, which can be considered as one of the main reasons why the PCE of MAPbI3 is greater than that of CsPbI2Br. As the visible light range accounts for the major useable portion of the full solar spectrum, high visible light absorption is critical for achieving high efficiency solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically studied the structural, optoelectronic, and point defect properties of both α- and β-CsPbI2Br perovskites from first-principles calculations. We found that after tuning the halide composition from pure I to a mixture of I–Br, α-CsPbI2Br and β-CsPbI2Br exhibit enhanced stability with a small increase of bandgap (from 1.72 to 1.94 eV) compared with the CsPbI3 system. Due to the similar antibonding coupling between Pb-s and I-p, the optoelectronic properties and absorption coefficient in the visible light range of CsPbI2Br resemble those of CsPbI3. Defect calculations indicate that the formation energies of Bri and VPb in β-CsPbI2Br are low under Br-rich conditions, and the Fermi level is pinned near the VBM. The dominant intrinsic defects induce shallow transition levels. The CsPbI2Br perovskite material can be tuned from intrinsic semiconductor to p-type, depending on the growth conditions. Our theoretical investigations provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural, optoelectronic, and defect properties of CsPbI2Br, which provide insights for further compositional engineering and optoelectronic property tuning, which help optimize the performance of PVSCs and other optoelectronic devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  The schematic crystal structure of the CsPbI2Br unit cell: (a) α-phase and (b) β-phase, respectively. The green, black, purple and brown balls denote Cs, Pb, I and Br atoms, respectively. Calculated energy band structures of CsPbI2Br based on PBE (blue dotted lines) and HSE06 (red solid lines) methods, respectively: (c) α-phase and (d) β-phase. The Fermi level is set to be 0 eV denoted as a black dashed line.	 

 	Fig. 2  At the ideal conditions of perovskite AMX3, the ionic size meets the condition of (rA + rX)/2(rM + rX) = 1. In this case, the ideal lattice constant is 2 × (rM + rX). The undersized A atom will shrink the ideal lattice constant, and the oversized A atom will expand the ideal lattice constant. From this figure, we can see that the lattice constants of CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br and CsPbBr3 are smaller than the ideal lattice constants indicating that (rCs + rI)/2 (rPb + rI) < 1.	 

 	Fig. 3  Calculated projected band structures and total density of state (TDOS) corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) by using the HSE06 method: (a and b) α-CsPbI2Br (c and d) β-CsPbI2Br. The blue, red, and green circles represent the electron orbits of Pb, I, and Br atoms, respectively; the size of the circle represents the weight of the orbit. The Fermi level is set to be 0 eV and denoted as a black dashed line.	 
Ed = E(CsPbI2Br) − E(CsI) − E(PbI2) − E(PbBr2)	(1)

 	Fig. 4  (a) Calculated chemical potential (ΔμCs, ΔμI, and ΔμBr) window diagram. The polyhedron shows the region where CsPbI2Br is stabilized against possible competing phases, including Pb, I2, CsI, PbI2, and PbBr2. The slices at (b) ΔμI = 1.44 eV and (c) ΔμI = 2.0 eV are also shown, where the allowed regions (grey) are surrounded by CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2.	 

 	Fig. 5  The transition energy levels for intrinsic acceptors (blue line) and intrinsic donors (red line) in CsPbI2Br: (a) α-phase and (b) β-phase, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 6  Calculated formation energies ΔH of intrinsic defects in CsPbI2Br as a function of the Fermi level EF at two representative chemical potential points in Fig. 4(a): (b) A (Pb-poor) and (c) D (Pb-rich). Defects with very high ΔH values are denoted as dashed lines.	 

 	Fig. 7  Calculated optical absorption coefficient spectra of CsPbI2Br with the PBE method: (a) α-phase and (b) β-phase, respectively. A small smearing of 0.1 eV is used to better distinguish the absorption peaks.
