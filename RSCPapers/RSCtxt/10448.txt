    , Accepted 12th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractDithienosilole (DTS) and dithienogermole (DTG) are useful building units of π-conjugated organic materials. In the present work, donor–π-acceptor (D–π-A) dyes with bis(dihexyloxyphenyl)aminophenyl, DTS or DTG, and pyridine or cyanoacrylic acid as the donor (D), the π-conjugated linker (π), and the acceptor (A) units, respectively, were prepared and their optical properties were investigated. The D–π-A dyes exhibited strong absorption in the visible region, indicating efficient intramolecular donor–acceptor interaction. The addition of trifluoroacetic acid to solutions of pyridine-containing dyes led to red-shifts of the absorption bands as a result of pyridinium salt formation. Similar red-shifts were observed for cyanoacrylic acid dyes, which were due to the enhanced formation of neutral dyes relative to the separated ion pairs. The D–π-A dyes, however, showed similar absorption spectra when attached to the TiO2 surface, indicating that the dye–TiO2 electronic interaction was rather weak. In contrast to the finding that these dyes exhibited similar optical properties regardless of the π-linker (i.e., DTS or DTG), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on DTG-containing dyes exhibited superior performance compared to those based on DTS-containing dyes. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements supported the higher performance of the DSSCs with DTG-containing dyes.
Introduction
Oligothiophenes and polythiophenes are of current importance as π-conjugated functional materials because of their excellent properties, such as highly efficient conjugation arising from the high coplanarity of the adjacent thiophene rings, high chemical and thermal stability, and easy chemical modification of the ring.1–3 Of those, element-bridged bithiophenes have been investigated as building units of functional π-conjugated materials.4–9 In addition to the high planarity of the bridged bithiophene units, which efficiently enhances the conjugation, perturbation of the electronic states of the bithiophenes by the bridging elements makes it possible to tune the electronic states of the bithiophene systems to realize the desired functionalities. In particular, dithienosilole (DTS) and dithienogermole (DTG) (Chart 1a) have captivated attention and many papers concerning the synthesis and applications of DTS- and DTG-based π-conjugated materials have been published to date.6–9 These materials have found use in organic electronic devices, such as thin-film transistors,10–13 organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells,14–17 light-emitting diodes,18,19 and fluorescence sensors.20,21 There has been considerable interest in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) that have dye-modified TiO2 as the active photoelectrode, because of their potential application as lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective modules. The development of efficient sensitizing dyes is the key to realizing high-performance DSSCs.22–25 The basic structures of organic sensitizing dyes are composed of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units that are linked directly or by a π-spacer to give rise to photo-induced charge separation. Recently, their structures have been further modified to improve charge separation efficiency. The dyes should also have an anchor unit for attachment to the TiO2 surface, and electron-withdrawing groups with binding ability to the TiO2 surface are often employed as A units. Commonly, cyanoacrylic acid, carboxylic acid, and pyridine units are used as the typical A units.26 The A units therefore affect the cell performance not only as part of π-conjugated units to absorb light and facilitate charge separation, but also by controlling dye attachment and electron injection from the dye to TiO2. DTS-based materials have also been studied as sensitizing dyes for DSSCs that possess dye-attached TiO2 as the active photoelectrode (Chart 1b).27–33 For example, D–π-A compounds with DTS as the π-linker were prepared and high DSSC performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.0–10.3% was achieved using dye C209 shown in Chart 1b.27 A DTS-containing D–A–π-A sensitizing dye B-87 was also synthesized and a high PCE of 10.2% was reported.33 In these DTS-based dyes, not only the efficient conjugation but also the substituents on the bridging silicon atom play a role in sterically covering the conjugated systems to avoid dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. On the other hand, DTG-containing photosensitizing dyes have been hardly investigated compared to DTS-containing dyes. This is presumably due to the similarity between the electronic perturbation of germanium to the π-conjugated system and that of silicon. Actually, the absorption of DTS- and DTG-containing polymers/molecular dyes in solution resembles each other regardless of the bithiophene-bridging elements in many cases.12–14,17,34 However, the long and low-polarized Ge–C bond of DTG results in differences in the intermolecular interaction in the solid state and the chemical stability compared to those of DTS. For example, we previously reported that an OPV cell with a DTG-containing polymer showed higher performance than an OPV cell with a DTS congener. This is likely due to the stronger intermolecular interactions in the DTG-containing polymer in the solid state.35 It has also been reported that the higher chemical stability of DTG than that of DTS under alkaline conditions is because of the smaller polarization of the Ge–C bond than that of the Si–C bond.36 In the course of our studies on DTG-based materials, we prepared DSSC photosensitizing dyes with DTG as the π-linker (Chart 1c),36,37 expecting that longer Ge–C bonds would result in better coverage of the π-conjugated dye core structure. These dyes exhibited good sensitizing properties in DSSCs. However, no systematic studies to compare the sensitizing properties of DTS- and DTG-containing dyes have been reported so far. In this paper, we report the synthesis of DTS- and DTG-containing D–π-A dyes with a cyanoacrylic acid or pyridine unit as a common anchoring acceptor and their sensitizing properties in DSSCs and directly compare the effects of DTS and DTG structures as the π-linkers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
In this work, four new sensitizing dyes were synthesized. The dyes possess di(hexyloxy)triphenylamine and pyridine or cyanoacrylic acid units as donor and anchoring/acceptor units, respectively, which are linked by a DTS or a DTG π-conjugated linker. The synthetic scheme of the DTG-containing dyes is shown in Scheme 1. The Stille cross-coupling reaction of 1 with trimethylstannyl-substituted di(hexyloxy)triphenylamine produced dithienogermole 2 bearing a triphenylamine unit. After bromination of compound 2, the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of monobromide 3 with 4-pyridylboronic acid gave pyridyl-substituted dye DTGPy in 84% yield. Cyanoacrylic acid dye DTGCA was prepared by the formylation of 3 to yield 4, followed by the Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid. For these DTG dyes, first, the donor fragment and the DTG structure were connected, and then the acceptor unit was introduced into the DTG structure. We attempted to adopt a similar synthetic scheme to the DTS dyes. Although a DTS congener of compound 2 could be synthesized in a similar fashion to 2, the following bromination by N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) produced inseparable byproducts together with the expected bromide. Therefore, the synthetic scheme for the DTS dyes was modified as shown in Scheme 2. Here, first, the acceptor unit was introduced, and then the donor unit was cross-coupled with the DTS unit to synthesize DTSPy and DTSCA. The structures of the four dyes were confirmed by 1H, 13C, 29Si NMR, and HR-MS measurements. The DTS- and DTG-containing dyes are stable in air and soluble in common organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, and acetone.

Photophysical properties
The absorption spectra of DTSPy and DTGPy with a pyridyl anchoring group are shown in Fig. 1. The absorptions of these dyes were quite similar in neutral THF, indicating similar electronic structures regardless of the bridging element (Si or Ge). The absorption band appeared at around 440 nm in the visible region, suggesting sufficient conjugation and the existence of intramolecular D–A interaction, which is supported by their solvatochromic properties and quantum chemical calculations (vide infra). The absorption of DTGPy was blue-shifted relative to that of pyridine dye ODTGPTzPy2 (λabsmax = 572 nm in THF, Chart 1),37 which should be due to the absence of a strong electron-withdrawing pyridinothiadiazole unit. In the presence of 1 vol% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the absorptions of DTSPy and DTGPy were clearly red-shifted from those in neutral THF. This would be attributed to the protonation of the pyridyl group, which led to the enhanced intramolecular D–A interaction, as observed in previously reported dyes.36 The absorption spectra of carboxylic acid dyes DTSCA and DTGCA are presented in Fig. 2. Similar to DTSPy and DTGPy, the absorption spectra of DTSCA and DTGCA were nearly identical in neutral THF. The absorptions of DTSCA and DTGCA were obviously red-shifted from those of DTSPy and DTGPy, due to the stronger electron-withdrawing properties of the cyanoacrylic acid moiety than those of the pyridyl group. The absorption wavelengths of DTSCA and DTGCA are similar to that of TP6CADTS (λabsmax = 511 nm in 2-methyl-2-propanol/acetonitrile (1:1) solution, Chart 1),29 indicating the weak electronic effect of the substituents on the Si/Ge atom. Under acidic conditions, the absorptions of DTSCA and DTGCA were red-shifted relative to those in neutral THF. This red-shift indicates that the cyanoacrylic acid group of DTSCA and DTGCA formed a separated ion pair in neutral THF, whereas the cyanoacrylate group was converted into neutral acid under acidic conditions, again similar to previously reported dyes.36 Next, we investigated the absorption of the dyes attached to the TiO2 surface. We immersed TiO2 films in 0.1 mM dye solutions containing 0.1 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for 15 hours and the films were thoroughly washed with a solvent used for dye-adsorption (acetonitrile or acetone) to remove excess dyes and CDCA. CDCA is often used as a co-adsorbent to avoid the highly aggregated state of the dyes on TiO2, because dye aggregation suppresses DSSC performance.38–42 The absorptions of DTSPy and DTGPy on the TiO2 film were slightly broadened but similar to those in THF solution, indicating weak electronic interactions between the dye molecules on TiO2 and between the dyes and TiO2 (Fig. S1†). These weak electronic interactions on the TiO2 surface were also observed in previously reported pyridine dyes, such as DTGPTzPy and ODTGPTzPy2 (Chart 1).36,37 On the other hand, DTSCA and DTGCA exhibited blue-shifted absorption on the TiO2 surface relative to the absorption in THF (Fig. S2†). The carboxylic group would become more anionic by forming CO2–Ti bonds on the TiO2 surface, leading to the blue-shifted spectra of DTSCA and DTGCA.36,43,44 This blue shift is contrary to that of the cyanoacrylic acid dye DTGPTzCA2 (Chart 1), whose absorption was extensively red-shifted on the TiO2 surface relative to the absorption in THF solution, because of the stronger intermolecular interaction.36 This difference is likely attributed to the simpler structures of DTSCA and DTGCA than that of DTGPTzCA2, although there may be some other factors that affect the spectra. The more extended conjugation and the enhanced D–A structure of DTGPTzCA2 with a highly electron-deficient pyridinothiadiazole unit seem to be responsible for the stronger intermolecular interaction. For example, the calculated dipole moment of DTGPTzCA2 is larger than that of DTGCA, resulting in the stronger dipole–dipole interaction of DTGPTzCA2 (Fig. S3†).

The fluorescence spectra of the present DTS- and DTG-containing dyes are shown in Fig. 3. In the same manner as the absorption, the fluorescence of DTSPy and DTGPy was nearly identical with each other. The high fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of 83% and 73% for DTSPy and DTGPy, respectively, clearly indicate their rigid structures that suppress the non-radiative relaxation process.45–47DTSPy and DTGPy were non-emissive in the presence of TFA. The fluorescence spectra of DTSCA and DTGCA were shifted to longer wavelengths than those of DTSPy and DTGPy, again suggesting the more effective intramolecular D–A interaction of DTSCA and DTGCA. The ΦF values of DTSCA and DTGCA were lower than those of DTSPy and DTGPy, which may be due to the smaller HOMO–LUMO energy gap.48–50 Under acidic conditions, similar to their absorption bands, the fluorescence bands of DTSCA and DTGCA were red-shifted relative to those in neutral THF. The ΦF values could not be determined because of the low intensity of the fluorescence bands. Next, the solvatochromic behavior of photoluminescence was investigated. As shown in Fig. S4,† the emission of DTSPy exhibited a clear bathochromic shift as the solvent polarity increased. In addition, the ΦF values decreased in polar solvents (Table S1†). This tendency demonstrates the effective intramolecular D–A interaction in the π-skeleton. A similar red-shift was observed for DTGPy (Fig. S5†), indicating that the nature of the bridging element (Si or Ge) does not largely affect the electronic structures of such highly π-conjugated systems.51,52 We also investigated the solvatochromic behavior of DTSCA and DTGCA. Because it has been reported that the optical properties of cyanoacrylic acid dyes are sensitive to protic solvents, the spectra were recorded in carefully dried solvents.53–56 As shown in Fig. S6,† the absorption maxima of DTSCA and DTGCA shifted to a shorter wavelength upon increasing solvent polarity from toluene/THF to acetone/DMF. It is likely that the formation of separated ion pairs is more favorable in polar solvents suppressing the D–A interaction. However, the changes are not linearly related to solvent polarity and the spectra in toluene and THF and those in acetone and DMF closely resemble each other, respectively, unlike those of DTSPy and DTGPy. In addition, their fluorescence bands were red-shifted in the order of THF < acetone < toluene ≈ DMF (Fig. S7†), in contrast to the absorption spectral changes. Presumably, the enhancement of the D–A interaction and the separated ion pair formation in polar solvents compete with each other leading to a non-linear relationship between the absorption and fluorescence energies and the solvent polarity.

Electrochemical properties
To examine the electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in 1.0 mM DMF solution with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. The obtained cyclic voltammograms of the DTS- and DTG-containing dyes are shown in Fig. 4. Two oxidative waves were observed for all the compounds. The first wave was reversible and the second wave was pseudo-reversible or irreversible. Interestingly, the first oxidative potentials were nearly the same for the four dyes, indicating that not only the bridging element but also the electron-acceptor unit (A) is inert to the first oxidative state of the dyes. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated on the basis of the first oxidative potentials and the absorption edges in neutral THF (Table 2). The attempted detection of reductive waves was unsuccessful. In contrast to the HOMOs, the LUMOs were affected by the structures and the attachment of a stronger electron-withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid unit resulted in the low-energy shifts of the LUMOs relative to those of pyridine-containing dyes. It was also found that the DTS derivatives have slightly lower-lying LUMOs than the DTG congeners. Although the differences were small, this was also supported by the DFT calculations (vide infra). This may be due to the enhanced σ*–π* interaction in the DTS derivatives arising from the shorter C–Si bond than the C–Ge bond, as observed for other simpler siloles and germoles reported previously.57 However, this was not clearly seen in DTSCA and DTGCA.

The HOMO energy levels of the dyes were more negative than the iodide/triiodide redox potential (−4.8 eV), which would promote dye regeneration by electron transfer from the iodide/triiodide redox couple solution in DSSCs. On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels were more positive than the conduction band edge of TiO2 (−3.9 eV), and this would lead to electron injection from the photoexcited dye to the TiO2 electrode in DSSCs. These results indicate that the DTS- and DTG-containing dyes would reasonably work as photosensitizers for DSSCs.
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were performed to investigate the electronic states of the DTS- and DTG-containing dyes at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The 2-ethylhexyl and hexyl groups were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation. The energy levels of the frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. 5. The HOMOs of the dyes were distributed from the diphenylamino moiety to the DTG backbone, and the LUMOs were mainly delocalized on the DTS/DTG structure and the terminal electron-accepting group. These well-separated HOMOs and LUMOs would give rise to the intramolecular D–A interaction, reflecting the strong absorption in the visible region and the solvatochromic behavior of the fluorescence spectra. The HOMO energy levels of the dyes were similar regardless of the structural differences, consistent with the results of CV analysis (Table 2). On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels of DTSCA0 and DTGCA0 were lower than those of DTSPy0 and DTGPy0, which arose from the stronger electron-withdrawing properties of the cyanoacrylic group than those of the pyridyl group, thereby reducing the HOMO–LUMO gaps. In the LUMO of DTSPy, the σ*–π* interaction between the π*-orbital and the Si–C σ*-orbital was observed, but it was not evident for DTGPy. This might be responsible for the slightly lower LUMO energy level of DTSPy than that of DTGPy, in agreement with the experimental results (Table 2). However, this energy difference is very small, thus possibly negligible for the DSSC performance.

Photovoltaic properties
Finally, we fabricated DSSCs based on the four DTS- and DTG-containing dyes as photosensitizers. The TiO2 electrodes were modified by immersing in 0.1 mM dye solution for 15 hours. For TiO2 modification, one equivalent of CDCA was added into the dye solution as the co-adsorbent to suppress dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium/0.05 M I2/0.1 M LiI/0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and the cell effective area was 0.25 cm2. To confirm the reproducibility, three cells were independently prepared for each dye. The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells based on DTS- and DTG-containing dyes with maximum PCE in the three cells are shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the cell with DTGPy exhibited higher IPCE than that with DTSPy. This may be due to the larger absorption coefficient of DTGPy than that of DTSPy (Table 1). Another possibility is, although we do not have solid evidence, the suppressed dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface due to the longer Ge–C bond.36 It is well known that the dye aggregation often lowers the cell efficiency.38–42 On the other hand, the cell with DTGCA showed similar IPCE spectra to that with DTSCA. Possibly, the effect of the long Ge–C bond might be neutralized by the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the cyanoacrylic acid moiety in the DTGCA system. The IPCE spectra of the cells with DTSCA and DTGCA were red-shifted relative to the spectra of the cells with DTSPy and DTGPy, consistent with the red-shifted absorption spectra of DTSCA and DTGCA in THF (Fig. 1 and 2). The IPCE spectral bands of our dyes extend to the visible region, and they are comparable to those of conventional organic dyes such as MK-2 and D131.58,59 The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 7. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the cell with DTGPy was larger than that with DTSPy, and the Jsc of the cell with DTGCA was nearly the same as that with DTSCA. These results are in accordance with the IPCE spectra (Fig. 6). The cells with DTSCA and DTGCA showed larger Jscs than those with DTSPy and DTGPy, which would be attributed to the red-shifted IPCE spectra. Importantly, the cells with the DTG-containing dyes exhibited higher Vocs than those with the DTS congeners in both pyridine and cyanoacrylic acid dyes (Table 3). This tendency was consistently observed in the three cells examined. It is surprising to us that the Vocs were improved for the DSSCs based on DTGPy and DTGCA compared to those based on the corresponding DTS dyes, although the photophysical properties of the DTS and DTG dyes were quite similar to each other. This seems to indicate that the recombination process from TiO2 to the electrolyte was effectively prohibited in the DTG dye-containing systems.60,61 To evaluate the interfacial charge recombination process in the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. S8† and Table 3, the electron transport resistance (Rrec) values of the cells with DTGPy and DTGCA were larger than those of the cells with DTSPy and DTSCA, respectively. The larger Rrec in the Nyquist plot indicates higher charge transport resistance among the TiO2/dye/electrolyte, leading to the improved Voc of the cells with the DTG-containing dyes.62 The electron lifetime (τe) was estimated from the Bode plots (Fig. S9† and Table 3). The τes of the cells with DTGPy and DTGCA were longer than those of the cells with DTSPy and DTSCA, respectively. This indicates the higher charge collection efficiency of the cells with DTGPy and DTGCA, which is also responsible for the improved Vocs of the cells with the DTG-containing dyes. To disclose the relationship between the bridging atom and the electron recombination process, further investigations are in progress.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized D–π-A type photosensitizing dyes containing DTS and DTG as π-linkers. The DTS- and DTG-containing dyes exhibited strong absorption in the visible region and they were applicable as the photosensitizing dyes of DSSCs. Interestingly, DSSCs based on DTG-containing dyes yielded better photovoltaic performance than those based on DTS-containing dyes, although these dyes showed similar electronic states regardless of the nature of the π-linker (DTS or DTG) and the difference in the anchoring acceptor unit exerts a larger influence on the cell efficiency. Especially, the Vocs of DSSCs with the DTG-containing dyes were improved from those with the DTS-containing dyes, as evidenced by EIS measurements. Cell performance based on the present dyes was not very high, but it must be noted that simple replacement of only one bridging element improved the DSSC performance. It is expected that the replacement of DTS by DTG in other DTS-containing dyes would also improve the DSSC performance.
