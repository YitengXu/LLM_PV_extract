Introduction
As an emerging technology for energy conversion, photo/electrochemical water splitting offers a promising yet eco-friendly way to meet the tremendous global energy demands.1–5 Due to large-scale commercialization, hydrogen energy, one of the most promising candidates for replacing fossil fuels, can be sustainably generated with solar energy by photocatalysis, photovoltaic-driven electrolysis or photoelectrocatalysis.6–10 Water electrolysis for hydrogen production is considered to be a sustainable and secure technology which has received extensive attention in the present energy and environmental scenario.11–13 Considering the excessive price and poor durability of noble metals (platinum and palladium), developing cost-effective and Earth-abundant transition metal oxide (TMO) alternatives with excellent HER activity to noble metals is imperative.14–16 Photoelectronics or photothermal TMO materials are environmentally applied to this field.17–20 The general principles are similar, i.e. utilizing a wide solar spectrum, only the former converts the absorbed photoenergy into electricity, while the latter prefers heat.21,22 Meanwhile, photothermal TMO materials also have great potential for biomedical applications.23,24 Photothermal therapy for cancer treatment is regarded as one of the most promising application due to its negligible side effects and fast operation.25–27 Photothermal therapy can heat up and kill cancer cells in the vicinity of heating agents (typically nanomaterials) that absorb near-infrared light (NIR) under irradiation.28 Herein, infrared-active photothermal materials coupled with photo-electricity conversion ability provide a unique way to convert infrared light into sustainable energy. However, the effective coupling of photoelectronics and photothermal materials still remains a great challenge.
Tungsten oxide (WO3), which consists of perovskite units, is known as the most-attractive candidate for photo/photoelectro-catalysis.29–33 WO3 displays fascinating performances resulting from the particular qualities of the outer-d valence electrons.34 It is reported that WO3 nanosheets possess planar conduction channels which accelerate the transport of photo-excited charge carriers.35–37 However, the long migration route also makes it easy for (photo)electron–hole recombination. Meanwhile, pristine WO3 is generally acknowledged as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) inert materials owing to the poor electronic conductivity and inappropriate hydrogen adsorption energy.29 The optical absorption of the ultraviolet region inevitably brings about the lack of an evident photothermal effect, limiting the corresponding photoelectronics and photothermal applications.
To solve the above issues, defect construction, involving intrinsically vacancies, is carried out as a significant way to modify the properties of WO3.38–42 Due to the small formation energy, oxygen vacancies (OVs) are generally introduced into the oxide, leading to alterations in the oxidation states of the central metal and the formation of new electronic states.43–48 The non-stoichiometric property of WO3 further assures that the lattice can withstand a considerable number of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen-deficient WO3 displays localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which induces high visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) light absorption.49–53 Furthermore, the photothermal effect also derives from the dissipation of photon energy into heat due to surface plasmon resonance absorption.
In our work, a series of oxygen-deficient WO3 has been synthesized by oxygen vacancy tuning. Oxygen vacancies with different concentrations were regulated on the layered WO3 under a reduction atmosphere. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental studies, it was verified that the chemical and electronic properties of WO3 nanosheets were successfully optimized through O-vacancy tuning. Enhanced electronic conduction, extended light absorption and enhanced HER reaction kinetics were achieved. As expected, WO3–OVs showed a drastic enhancement of electrocatalytic HER behavior under Vis-NIR light irradiation. A small overpotential of 52 mV (at 10 mV cm−2) and a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec−1 favorably compare to the state-of-the-art HER catalysts (Pt, Pt/C). Moreover, upon single-wavelength NIR irradiation (808 nm), WO3–OVs exhibited a high photothermal conversion efficiency (∼41.6%) and an efficient tumor inhibition rate (∼96.8%). This study may have opened up a feasible route to produce multifunctional photoelectronics or photothermal materials from well-developed oxides.
Results and discussion
In consideration of the ‘Magdeburger Halbkugeln’ phenomenon of 2D layered materials, ultrasonic magnetic stirring was introduced in the acidification process of preparing homogeneous nanosheets.54 The as-prepared high-quality precursor nanosheets are in favour of synthesizing the target product and increasing more active sites (Fig. S1, ESI†). As shown in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1a, b and c), the morphology of sample is well-maintained after calcination under a H2/Ar atmosphere. The corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals the high crystallinity of cubic WO3 (Fig. 1d). The lattice fringes with the crystal spacing of 0.365, 0.316 and 0.391 nm were in agreement with the (110), (100) and (001) crystal faces of cubic WO3, respectively.30–32 The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern demonstrates that the as-sythesized WO3 is a single-crystalline cubic structure without a second phase or precipitation (Fig. 1e). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was further used to study the thicknesses and fine structures of the nanosheets, which are unobservable in SEM characterization. These oxide nanosheets were about 1.2 nm in thickness and the width size of nanosheets is similar to those observed in the SEM images (Fig. 1f). Moreover, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) mapping images reveal the homogeneous distribution of W and O elements (Fig. 1g). The presence of carbon element is derived from the carbon cloth substrate during the EDS test. The sample exhibits O/W proportions greater than 3, owing to the existence of physico/chemical adsorbed water (Fig. 1h). The synthesized high-quality WO3 nanosheets will provide more charge carriers and improve the conductivity, which help to promote electrocatalytic ability.

On account of the high crystallinity of WO3–OVs nanosheets, the cubic WO3 phase (JCPDS No. 41-0905) can be indexed from the XRD pattern (Fig. 2a). As shown, the characteristic diffraction peaks at 23.9°, 34.1°, 42.1°, 49.1°, 55.3° and 61.1° corresponding to the (100), (110), (111), (200), (210) and (211) planes of cubic WO3 were detected. Compared to WO3, the (100) peak of WO3–OVs slightly shifted to the left, which is due to the presence of oxygen vacancies.55 As shown in Fig. 2b, the Raman peaks of WO3–OVs at 263 cm−1 and 681, 817 cm−1 are ascribed to the bending vibration and stretching vibration of O–W–O, respectively. Compared to the sharper peaks of WO3 and HWO4·xH2O, the peak of WO3–OVs shows a slightly broader peak shape at 600–900 cm−1. The broader peak shape preliminarily testifies the existence of the WO3 composition with oxygen vacancies.56 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was further employed to study the chemical structures. The XPS survey spectrum reveals that the materials are only composed of W and O, suggesting high purity (Fig. S2, ESI†).30–32 The results obtained through XPS are consistent with those acquired through EDX. Compared to control HWO4 and fully-oxidized WO3, two additional peaks at ∼34.9 and 36.9 eV corresponding to 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of W5+ appear in the W 4f spectrum of WO3–OVs, implying that WO3 is partially reduced and oxygen vacancies are produced (Fig. 2c). In addition to the main O 1s peak for the O–W bond, another additional peak represents the physisorbed/chemisorbed water (Fig. 2d). Obviously, the appearance of the peak in WO3–OVs located at ∼531.2 eV is attributed to the amount of defect sites with a lower oxygen coordination. The existence of oxygen vacancies was further identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Fig. 2e). No signal was detected in HWO4 and WO3. A strong EPR peak at a g value of 2.002 ascribed to unpaired electrons is observed in the as synthesized WO3–OVs.57–59 Compared to precursor HWO4 and WO3, WO3–OVs exhibited the largest BET specific surface area (97.1 m2 g−1), which illustrates the amount of active sites that appeared during the preparation (Fig. 2f). The above detailed analysis indicates that the successful formation of oxygen vacancies on WO3 nanosheets is highly conducive to facilitate charge transfer and tune band gaps, which exhibit significant potential effects of the catalytic HER system.

The inset of (f) shows the corresponding BET specific surface area and DR microporous surface area of samples. 
Considering the LSPR effect induced by oxygen vacancies, the as-synthesized WO3 with oxygen vacancies (WO3–OVs) displays significantly enhanced absorption of Vis-NIR light (Fig. 3a). Both diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements prove that the photo-response of WO3–OVs is largely extended to the near infrared regions (500 to 850 nm) and the solar energy utilization efficiency is increased. Photo/electrocatalytic HER was investigated as the template reaction to explore the potential of photoelectronic applications. A Pt electrode and 20 wt% Pt/C acted as the control samples. A short duration of visible light treatment shows significant improvement of the HER activity of WO3–OVs (Fig. 3b). Under light irradiation, the overpotential driving 10 mA cm−2 decreased only 40.2% of that in darkness and the current density at −100 mV increased 8-fold than that with light irradiation (Fig. S3, ESI†). Meanwhile, the Tafel slope sharply decreased from 92 mV dec−1 (in darkness) to 37 mV dec−1 (under light irradiation), which performs favorably comparable to the state-of-the-art HER catalysts (Pt, Pt/C). The photocurrent responses were further recorded to test the photoelectrochemical (PEC) behavior for several on–off cycles of light irradiation in alkaline solution. WO3–OVs display a photocurrent response of about 15 μA cm−2 under light irradiation, which is higher than that of WO3 (∼5 μA cm−2) (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Transient photocurrent responses of WO3–OVs show that the photoinduced electron–hole pairs are easy to be separated and transferred, which eventually perform as the higher HER activity. These results can be further confirmed by EIS with different light irradiation (Fig. S4b, ESI†). WO3–OVs exhibit a smaller semicircle of the corresponding impedance, which reveals the better electronic conductivity of WO3–OVs.

The inset of (d) shows the SEM image of WO3–OVs after the stability test. (e) DFT-calculated density of states (DOS) of WO3 and WO3–OVs. 
As another important criterion for photo/electrocatalysts, the electrocatalytic stability of WO3–OVs was evaluated by current-time plots (Fig. 3c) and LSV after long-term cycling (Fig. 3d). The current density of −2.1 mA cm−2 was almost unchanged after a 24 h continuous i–t testing at an overpotential of −50 mV, which meant that WO3–OVs possessed good long-term catalytic stability for HER. Moreover, negligible degeneration in HER activity was tested with/without light irradiation after long-term cycling. What is more, the XRD pattern and SEM image show that the chemical structure and nanosheet morphology of WO3–OVs were well-retained (the insets of Fig. 3c and d, Fig. S5, ESI†). The possible valence changes were further examined by XPS (Fig. S6, ESI†). No significant change occurs in the W 4f region spectrum. The oxygen vacancies are well maintained and the peak intensity of physisorbed or chemisorbed water increases after the reaction. All the above measurements indicate the excellent stability of the WO3–OVs photo-response electrocatalyst towards the HER in a strong alkaline media. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed to understand the promoted electrocatalytic performance by oxygen vacancy (Fig. 3e and S7, 8, ESI†). In the plots of the partial density of states (PDOS), the introduced oxygen vacancies exhibit a broad DOS peak at the Fermi surface and the effective density of states is slightly delocalized, which enhances the conductivity.5,60,61 In addition, the modulation of oxygen vacancies assures a rapid electron and hole transfer, which significantly contributes to the outstanding photo-electrochemical HER activity.
To further shed light on the effect of oxygen vacancy quantity, control samples WO3-250/350/450/550/650 with different amounts of oxygen vacancies prepared at different calcination temperatures were synthesized (Fig. S9 and 10, ESI†). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of control samples are shown in Fig. 4a. In contrast to the WO3-250/350 with a lower amount of oxygen vacancies, enhanced Vis-NIR light absorption can be observed from WO3-450. However, a continuous increase of oxygen vacancies (WO3-550/650) gives rise to degenerative absorption. The main reason for this degeneration is the negative effect of the redundant impurity energy level on light absorption,62–64 which was introduced by excessive oxygen vacancies. Each O 1s spectrum for control samples can be fitted with three symmetrical peaks at similar energy positions with varied intensity, which corresponds to metal oxide, oxygen vacancy, and physisorbed/chemisorbed water (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the intensity of the EPR signal of oxygen vacancies increases with the calcination temperature (Fig. 4c). The results indicate the positive correlation of oxygen vacancy and calcination temperature, which is consistent with the XPS observation. A similar tendency of optical absorption occurs in photo-enhanced electrocatalysis (Fig. 4d, and S11 and 12, ESI†). The catalytic ability of all of the samples is moderate in darkness without much difference and WO3-450 exhibits the best performance. Large discrepancies existed while introducing light irradiation. In particular the Tafel slope and the overpotential decrease, but the current density distinctly increase (Fig. S11, ESI†). WO3-450 shows the optimum performance compared to the samples with higher or lower oxygen vacancies.

Encouraged by the dramatic absorption of NIR and clarified principle of photothermal effect, the photothermal effect of the WO3–OVs was investigated. Of note, the temperature of the WO3–OVs dispersions can be increased with different light intensities in a time and concentration-dependent manner. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, as the laser power density increases, the temperature elevation increases. Compared to the control group (DI water) with a negligible change (∼2.1 °C), the temperature of the WO3–OVs dispersion at 100 μg mL−1 can be rapidly increased to as high as ∼64.2 °C (Fig. 5b). The temperature also increased to ∼54.1 and ∼43.1 °C at a rather low concentration of 50 and 20 μg mL−1, respectively. The above results demonstrated that the WO3–OVs can easily eliminate cancer cells by reaching the critical temperature (43 °C) at a low concentration or short period of irradiation.65,66 The stability of photothermal conversion was also investigated by four repeated irradiation cycles (Fig. 5c). The temperature of the WO3–OVs dispersion (100 μg mL−1) can be maintained at the maximum or minimum temperature when turn the laser on or off, testifying the high photothermal stability of the WO3–OVs. To further verify the photothermal potential, the photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of WO3–OVs was measured. The remarkably high η of ∼41.6% is better or comparable to that of reported tungsten-based materials and other analogous materials (Fig. S13, ESI†). The cytotoxicity on both HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and MCF-7 cells (the common human cell line derived from breast cancer) was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay to explore the application of WO3–OVs. The cells were incubated with the WO3–OVs dispersions at various concentrations for 48 h. The results showed that the cell viability was maintained above 98% at any concentration (Fig. 5d). This indicated that the WO3–OVs have good biocompatibility. The photothermal therapy effect of the WO3–OVs was further studied in vitro. For the experiment, MCF-7 cells were treated with WO3–OVs only (100 μg mL−1), NIR irradiation (808 nm, 2.5 W cm−2) only and combination of the WO3–OVs with laser irradiation for 2 min. The photothermal destruction efficacy was quantitatively confirmed by the CCK-8 assay. As shown in Fig. 5e, the control group of MCF-7 cells receiving only laser treatment (without using WO3–OVs), shows no significant loss in viability after irradiation. However, the viability of the cells incubated with WO3–OVs significantly decreases with increasing irradiation time and more than 90% of MCF-7 cells were killed upon 2 min irradiation. An efficient tumor inhibition rate (∼96.8%) was achieved with 100 μg mL−1 WO3–OVs. Even at a concentration as low as 50 μg mL−1, the cells nearly 75% were destructed with such a short irradiation. The therapeutic effects were further confirmed via calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM) and propidium iodide (PI), where the live cells showed green fluorescence and the dead cells showed red fluorescence (Fig. 5f). As exhibited in Fig. 5f, MCF-7 cells treated with either the WO3–OVs or the NIR laser alone showed only green fluorescence in the entire well, suggesting that neither of such treatments can reduce the cell viability. As a striking contrast, MCF-7 cells treated by the combination of the WO3–OVs with 2 min irradiation can induce severe cell death (nearly 100% of tumor inhibition rate), which was in accordance with the results of the CCK-8 assay. These results demonstrate that WO3–OVs, as high-performance photothermal therapy agents, are promising for further biomedical applications.

Conclusions
In our work, oxygen vacancy tuning was introduced to oxygen-deficient WO3 synthesis. The specific role of oxygen vacancy on metal oxide (WO3) was investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental studies. It was verified that the chemical and electronic properties of WO3 were successfully optimized through O-vacancy tuning. Enhanced electronic conduction, extended light absorption, enhanced HER reaction kinetics and benign photothermal performance were achieved. The WO3–OVs exhibit a noble-metal like electrocatalytic HER behavior, which is highly enhanced by Vis-NIR light irradiation. The promising potential of the WO3–OVs for anticancer photothermal therapy has also been demonstrated, with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (∼41.6%) upon single wavelength near-infrared irradiation and an efficient tumor inhibition rate (∼96.8%). This work paves an exciting new avenue for the design to convert well-developed metal oxides to high-performance and low-cost materials for energy and oncology applications.
Experimental
Synthesis of WO3 nanosheets with OVs
In a typical process, 0.5 g ammonium tungstate hydrate was dispersed in 10 mL deionized water in a quartz tube. The HWO4 NSs were formed by adding 0.4 mL hydrochloric acid (12 mol L−1) to the sample dropwise, while mixing it homogeneously by intensely stirring. Then, the quartz tube was placed into a powerful ultrasonic machine with magnetic stirring for 8 h. The as-prepared precursor was collected and dried at 60 °C for 12 h under vacuum state. Then, under the flowing H2/Ar gas, the above precursor was heated at 450 °C for 2 h in a tube furnace. The control samples with different concentrations of OVs were named WO3-250/350/550/650, and prepared at different calcination temperatures, respectively.
Materials characterization
The morphology and phase structure of the samples were investigated by FESEM (Hitachis-4800), HRTEM (JEM 2100F), XRD (Bruker D8 Advance), Raman (LabRAM HR), BET (ASAP 2020), ESR (Bruker E500) and XPS (Philips Tecnai Twin-20U), respectively. For the test details, see ESI S2.†
Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical characterization studies
All electrochemical measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). Ag/AgCl (KCl saturated, E0Ag/AgCl = 0.2046 V, at 25 °C) and Pt plate were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared catalysts were employed as working electrodes. A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C, Beijing Perfect Light Company) was used as the light source, providing visible light throughout the photoelectrochemical test. For the test details, see ESI S3.† The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by measuring the photocurrent density under monochromatic light irradiation with a 500 W Xe lamp coupled with a grating monochromator, and then calculating the IPCE using following eqn, where Iph is the photocurrent density, λ is the incident light wavelength, and Pmono is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity. The illumination intensities of the monochromatic light were measured with a PM 100A Optical Power Meter (ThorLabs).  
DFT calculations
DFT calculations were carried out using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package. The exchange–correlation energy was described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation density functional (PBE) within the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA).67 A 400 eV plane-wave kinetic energy cutoff was chosen. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 6 × 6 × 6 Monkhorst–Pack grids for WO3 bulk and surface calculations. The atomic positions were fully relaxed until a maximum energy difference and residual force on atoms, respectively, converged to 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1. A 15 Å thick vacuum layer was used to avoid the interaction between top and bottom surfaces.
Photothermal and photothermal therapy experiments
Monitoring the temperature of the WO3–OVs dispersions in a quartz cuvette whether at different light intensities of 808 nm laser (1.5, 2.0, 2.5 W cm−2) or various concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μg mL−1) was performed to measure the photothermal effect. A thermocouple microprobe submerged in the solution to measure the temperature. The photothermal conversion efficiency of WO3–OVs was calculated according to previous reports.68–70 Single wavelength photothermal conversion efficiency (ηsin) is calculated based on following equation:  where hsin is the heat transfer coefficient; Ssin is the surface area of the container; hS = mc/τ. m refers to the solution mass, c means the specific heat capacity of the solution, and τ is obtained from the cooling process and the corresponding time. ΔTmax,sam and ΔTmax,DI are the temperature change of the WO3 and solvent (DI water) at the maximum steady-state temperature, respectively; Qs is the baseline energy input by the solvent and the sample container without the sample solution; I is the laser power; A808 is the absorbance of the WO3 at 808 nm. The cytotoxicity of WO3–OVs for HUVECs and MCF-7 cells and the therapeutic effects of MCF-7 cells were measured by CCK-8 assay. Immunofluorescence of MCF-7 cells was further achieved via AM/PI. For the test details, see ESI S4 and 5.†
Photothermal therapy
The human breast cancer cells MCF-7 were purchased from Shanghai cell bank (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China), human venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from iCell Bioscience company (Shanghai, China). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and MCF-7 cells were first seeded into 96-well cell-culture plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well, and then incubated with the sample dispersion at various concentrations (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 μg mL−1) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 48 h. Afterwards, the cell survival efficiency was measured using CCK-8 assay. The cells cultured with the pure medium were used as a control. The data represented the mean of quintuplicate measurements.
The photothermal effect was evaluated using MCF-7 cells as the test model. MCF-7 cells were seeded on a 24-well plate at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well (in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1.0 mL per well) at 37.0 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After being kept overnight, the sample dispersion (100.0 μg mL−1) was added for co-incubating for 24 h, and then the cells were exposed to NIR laser (808 nm, 2.5 W cm−2) for 2 min. After laser irradiation, the cells were incubated with fresh RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS at 37.0 °C for 30 min, and then washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and stained with calcein AM (2.0 μmol L−1) and PI (3.0 μmol L−1) for visualization of the live cells and dead cells. Cell viability was evaluated using CCK-8 assay according to the manufacturer suggested procedures. Results were shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n = 4).
