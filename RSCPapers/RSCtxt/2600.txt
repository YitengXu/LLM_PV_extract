    , Accepted 16th April 2012First published on 18th April 2012AbstractA high-efficiency photoelectrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) should combine the advantageous features of fast electron transport, slow interfacial electron recombination and large specific surface area. However, these three requirements usually cannot be achieved simultaneously in the present state-of-the-art research. Here we report a simple procedure to combine the three conflicting requirements by using porous SnO2 nanotube–TiO2 (SnO2 NT–TiO2) core–shell structured photoanodes for DSSCs. The SnO2 nanotubes are prepared by electrospinning of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/tin dichloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) solution followed by direct sintering of the as-spun nanofibers. A possible evolution mechanism is proposed. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 core–shell structured DSSCs (∼5.11%) is above five times higher than that of SnO2 nanotube (SnO2 NT) DSSCs (∼0.99%). This PCE value is also higher than that of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25) DSSCs (∼4.82%), even though the amount of dye molecules adsorbed to the SnO2 NT–TiO2 photoanode is less than half of that in the P25 film. This simple procedure provides a new approach to achieve the three conflicting requirements simultaneously, which has been demonstrated as a promising strategy to obtain high-efficiency DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention as a promising candidate for future green energy due to their facile, low-cost, and environmentally-friendly fabrication process.1–3 Recently, Yella et al.4 reported a new record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >12% by using a porphyrin-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode together with cobalt(II/III)-based redox electrolyte. However, the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode is still a limiting component that needs to be further improved before the technology can be commercialized. The overall sunlight-to-electric power conversion process of a DSSC can be summarized as the combination of photogeneration, charge-carrier transport, and collection.1,5 In other words, a high-efficiency photoanode for DSSCs should combine the advantageous features of fast electron transport, slow interfacial electron recombination, and high specific surface area. Considerable attention has been focused on 1D core–shell structures for the purpose of speeding up electron transport and slowing recombination to achieve a high charge collection efficiency.6–11 However, in the present state-of-the-art research, these 1D core–shell structures usually increase the charge collection efficiency at the expense of specific surface area, resulting in a low PCE.
One promising approach to achieving the three conflicting requirements simultaneously is to use electrospun SnO2 nanotubes in SnO2 nanotube–TiO2 (SnO2 NT–TiO2) core–shell structured photoanodes for dye-sensitized solar cells. Firstly, we fabricated SnO2 nanofibers and nanotubes as photoanodes for DSSCs by electrospinning followed by direct sintering the as-spun nanofibers. Electrospinning generates 1D polycrystalline SnO2 nanomaterials with extremely high aspect ratios and specific surface areas, and thus, is different from most other methods used to prepare SnO2 nanomaterials, such as template methods,12 and the hydro-thermal method.13 Therefore, the electrospun 1D structures, such as nanofibers and nanotubes, can provide a direct pathway for electron transport and large surface area for dye loading. On the other hand, SnO2 is an excellent metal oxide semiconductor with higher electron mobility (∼100 to 200 cm2 V−1 S−1) and larger band gap (3.6 eV) than TiO2, indicating a faster transport of photogenerated electrons and more excellent long-term stability compared to TiO2 for DSSCs applications.7,14,15 However, SnO2-based DSSCs were developed with less success due to at least two weak points: (1) a 300 mV positive shift of the conduction-band edge of SnO2 with respect to that of nanocrystalline TiO2, leading to a faster interfacial electron recombination and lower trapping density,16 and (2) less adsorption of the dye with acidic carboxyl groups due to a lower isoelectric point. To solve these problems, SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structures have been adopted to combine the advantageous features of the two materials.7,14,15,17,18 The SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structured DSSCs show higher short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) than that of TiO2 nanoparticle (P25) DSSCs. The contribution of one mole of dye molecules to Jsc for SnO2–TiO2 core–shell DSSC is almost three times larger than that of P25 DSSC, indicating an extremely fast and efficient charge collection in SnO2–TiO2 core–shell DSSCs.
Experimental
Preparation of 1D SnO2 nanostructure by electrospinning
To obtain nanofibers and nanotubes, two kinds of precursor solutions were prepared. Firstly, certain amounts of tin dichloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, Tianjin Chemical Corp., China) were dissolved in a mixture of 2.2 g ethanol and 2.2 g N,N-dimethyl formamide by magnetic stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Secondly, 0.4 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP, Sigma Aldrich, Mw ≈ 1300000) was added to the resulting solution and vigorously stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The weight ratios of PVP to SnCl2·2H2O were 1.33 (solution A) and 1.78 (solution B). The applied voltage and the distance between the tip and the collector were 13.5 kV and 15 cm, respectively. After electrospinning, the non-woven membranes of the fibers were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3.5 °C min−1 in air.
Fabrication of the SnO2–TiO2 core–shell photoanodes for DSSCs
To obtain the SnO2–TiO2 core–shell photoanodes, the annealed nanofibers and nanotubes (0.08 g) were ultrasonically dispersed in a mixture of 1.5 ml acetic acid, 0.4 ml deionized water and 0.1 g ethanol for durations of 10 min. Then 0.02 g polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw = 20000) was added to the above solutions and stirred for 30 min. The pastes were then coated on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (2.2 mm in thickness, >90% transmittance, 14 Ω per square, Nippon, Japan) by drop-drying method. The thickness of the films was fixed at ∼13 μm. The films were then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Coating of TiO2 on SnO2 nanofibers and nanotubes was performed by dipping the SnO2 nanofibers and nanotubes electrodes into a 0.08 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 85 °C for 2 h, and then again sintering at 500 °C in air for 30 min.
Assembling of DSSCs
The details of the assembling process of the DSSCs have been described in our previous work.19 In brief, after cooling to 80 °C, the sintered electrodes were immersed into a 0.3 mM solution of N-719 dye in a mixture of tert-butyl alcohol and acetonitrile (volume ratio of 1:1) and kept in the dark at room temperature for 12 h. Sensitized electrodes were rinsed with ethanol for 30 min to remove the physisorbed dye molecules, and then assembled with the platinum counter electrodes. The counter electrodes were prepared by spin-coating a 4.5 mM isopropanol solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O followed by sintering at 400 °C for 20 min. The interelectrode space was filled with a liquid electrolyte consisting of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The effective area was fixed at 0.18 cm2.
Characterizations
The morphologies of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30). The thermal gravimetry analysis was performed on a Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA, PerkinElmer, Diamond TG/DTA) in air with a heating rate of 3.5 °C min−1. X-Ray diffraction (XRD, Philips, X'pert pro, Cu Kα, 0.154056 nm) was employed to characterize the structural properties of the samples. The specific surface area was measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, ASAP 2010) method. The amount of adsorbed dye was measured by chemical desorption with a 0.1 M NaOH solution in 1:1 EtOH/H2O. The dye concentration of the resultant solution was determined by UV-VIS absorption measurement (TU-1901) of the solution using the absorption peak intensity of N719 at 515 nm. Current–voltage (I–V) curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with an Electrochemical Workstation (RST5200, Zhengzhou Shiruisi Technology Co., Ltd, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz at open-circuit voltage with a potential pulse of 10 mV in amplitude.
Results and discussion
Characterization of electrospun SnO2 nanofibers and nanotubes

Fig. 1 shows the typical SEM and TEM images of the samples electrospun from solution A and solution B followed by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3.5 °C min−1. The electrospun nanofibers from solution A and B yielded nanofibers and nanotubes after annealing at 500 °C for 2 h, as shown in Fig. 1a and c, and Fig. 1b and d, respectively. The average diameter and particle size of the nanofibers is 130 and ∼13 nm respectively. While the nanotubes exhibit an average outer diameter of ∼110 nm, a wall thickness of ∼10 nm, and an average particle size of ∼14 nm. These 1D structures consisting of closely packed nanoparticles have a large surface-to-volume ratio which is in favor of dye loading. The high resolution TEM image and selected area electron diffraction pattern are shown in Fig. 1e and f, respectively, revealing the polycrystalline nature of the nanotubes, and the patterns could be completely indexed to the rutile SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445).

Formation mechanism of SnO2 nanotubes
To investigate the formation mechanism of the porous SnO2 nanotubes, the annealing process was carried out under temperatures of 300, 350 and 425 °C, and the morphology evolution of the two samples mentioned above were observed by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, the heating rate was fixed at 3.5 °C min−1. At first, both of the samples annealed at 300 °C were solid nanofibers with small quantities of tiny particles embedded in the amorphous carbon matrix (see the high resolution TEM image shown in Fig. S1†). The tiny particles are likely the products of SnO2, which can be confirmed by the SAED pattern for the sample from solution A, as shown in Fig. 2a. No diffraction ring pattern can be observed for the fibers prepared from solution B. This indicates that the crystallinity of the initially formed SnO2 particles at 300 °C from solution B is poorer as compared to that from solution A. When the temperature rises to 350 °C, tiny SnO2 particles are clearly observed at the edge of the fibers prepared from solution B, which cannot be found on the fibers prepared from solution A. As the temperature increases to 425 °C, porous SnO2 nanotubes start to form from the electrospun fiber prepared from solution B, while the products from solution A are still solid nanofibers consisting of closely packed nanoparticles with a much smoother surface. At last, further annealing of the fibers at 500 °C and keeping the temperature for 2 h, generated SnO2 nanofibers and nanotubes, as shown in Fig. 1c and d.

On the basis of the experiments mentioned above, a possible formation mechanism of SnO2 nanotubes is proposed. At first, composite nanofibers with well dispersed SnCl2 molecules in the PVP polymer network were obtained by electrospinning. There were fewer SnCl2 molecules dispersing in the network of PVP for the fibers from solution B than that of solution A. This difference seems to play a key role in the formation of nanotubes. During the heating, the diluted SnCl2 molecules dispersed in the network of PVP (from solution B) tend to diffuse to the surface of the nanofibers and decompose to form SnO2 nanoparticles; whereas the fibers containing more SnCl2 molecules (from solution A) tend to decompose and form SnO2 nanoparticles near the sites where they are initially. This can be confirmed by the difference in TEM images of the two fibers annealed at 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 2a and d. Here, two driving forces result in the diffusion of SnCl2 molecules to the surface: Firstly, most of the SnCl2 molecules in the core region of the nanofibers do not decompose due to lack of oxygen, leading to a SnCl2 concentration gradient. This driving force performs a role in the temperature range from 185 (the Tg of PVP) to 400 °C (PVP starts to decompose, TGA shown in Fig. S2†), because at this temperature range PVP chains show high flexibility, which would be beneficial for the free diffusion of SnCl2. Secondly, when the temperature rises above 400 °C, the gas released from the decomposition of PVP can drive the tiny SnO2 nanoparticles to the surface. In order to better understand the influence of gas release on the morphology of SnO2 fibers, the fibers prepared from solution A were annealed at a higher heating rate of 10.0 °C min−1, and the products were nanotubes as shown in Fig. S3.† This result indicates that the increase of the heating rate results in an increase in the rate of PVP decomposition, and consequently in the gas release rate. In the previous work on preparing nanotubes by direct annealing of the electrospun composite nanofibers, Cheng et al.20 argued that the gas diffusion decomposed from PVP leads to the formation of hollow Fe2O3 structures; Xiang et al.21 considered that, a Cu(CH3COO)2 concentration gradient is formed during heating, which will drive Cu(CH3COO)2 to diffuse to the surface to form CuO nanotubes. However, in this work, we have demonstrated that both of the driving forces play a key role in the formation of nanotubes (Fig. 3).

SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structured photoanodes
SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structured photoelectrodes for DSSCs tests were prepared by depositing SnO2 NF and NT films on FTO glasses and then treating the electrodes with TiCl4 aqueous solution. Fig. 4a–c are SEM images of the SnO2 NT electrodes fabricated by drop-drying method. The continuous fibers were cut into NTs with an average length of ∼3 μm upon ultrasonic dispersion. The average aspect ratio of the NTs was ∼30. In addition, the resulting SnO2 NT film was dispersed homogeneously over a large area without aggregates. Here, the coexistence of water and acetic acid was important because in this mixture the SnO2 NTs can be isolated from each other and the aggregations of the NTs can be prevented.22 After treating the electrode with TiCl4, the diameter of the SnO2 NTs increased slightly, but their macroscopic porous morphology was retained.

Fig. 4d compares the XRD patterns of the SnO2 NT film with and without TiCl4 treatment. It can be seen that all the diffraction peaks of SnO2 NTs can be well indexed to a rutile structure of SnO2 (JCPDS no. 41-1445). In the case of SnO2 NT film with treatment, additional XRD peaks characteristic of rutile TiO2 appeared at 2θ = 27.45, 36.09, 41.22, and 54.32°, which further confirm the realization of SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structure.
To obtain an insight into the porous structure of the SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structured photoelectrodes, we measured the BET surface area of these samples using nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the SnO2 NT, SnO2 NT–TiO2 and P25 films are shown in Fig. 5. The BET surface area of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 presents quite a high value, ∼52.6119 m2 g−1, which is 35% higher than that of SnO2 NT (∼39.0213 m2 g−1) and is slightly lower than that of P25 film (∼54.1601 m2 g−1). The inset of Fig. 5 compares the pore-size-distribution curves of SnO2 NT, SnO2 NT–TiO2 and P25 film. There are mainly two sizes of pores, 2.1 and 17.2 nm for SnO2 NT, 1.8 and 7.9 nm for SnO2 NT–TiO2 film, and lastly, 1.9 and 22.1 nm for P25 film. As compared with SnO2 NT, the maximum pore volume of SnO2 NT–TiO2 film shifts to a lower pore diameter, which is obviously a result of the decrease of the pore diameter due to the coating of TiO2 on SnO2 NT.

The performance of DSSCs
SnO2 NT–TiO2 photoelectrodes were tested under an illumination condition of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) and compared to those with the photoelectrodes of SnO2 NT (without TiCl4 treatment), SnO2 NF–TiO2 (with TiCl4 treatment), SnO2 NF (without TiCl4 treatment), and commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (P25). The characteristic J–V curves of these DSSCs are presented in Fig. 6, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSCs (Voc = 0.723 V, Jsc = 14.71 mA cm−2) are considerably higher than those obtained from the SnO2 NT DSSCs (Voc = 0.489 V, Jsc = 5.89 mA cm−2). These variations are similar to those of Voc and Jsc for the SnO2 NF–TiO2 and SnO2 NF DSSCs. These results are expected because the conduction-band edge of SnO2 is 300 mV more positive than that of TiO2, which leads to a faster interfacial electron recombination and lower trapping density.14,16 In DSSCs, the interfacial charge recombination affects the Voc by decreasing the concentration of electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor, and affects the Jsc by decreasing the forward injection current.23,24 The coating of the TiO2 shell on a SnO2 core yields a surface dipole layer toward the SnO2.24 Such a dipole layer might shift the conduction band of SnO2 to a more negative value, causing an increase in Voc and Jsc. Therefore, the significant increases in Voc and Jsc indicate that the interfacial electron combinations on SnO2 NF and NT electrodes are effectively suppressed by applying the SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structure. Moreover, since the amount of dye adsorption on the SnO2 NT–TiO2 (0.594 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is larger than that of SnO2 NF–TiO2 (0.501 × 10−7 mol cm−2), the 15.92% increase of Jsc for SnO2 NT–TiO2 with respect to that of SnO2 NF–TiO2 most likely arises as a result of an enhanced light harvesting due to the larger surface area of SnO2 NT.

To reveal the differences in the interfacial characteristics of these photoelectrodes, we measured EIS spectra of the DSSCs using SnO2 NT–TiO2, SnO2 NT and TiO2 nanoparticles (P25), as shown in Fig. 7. In all the EIS spectra, one well-defined semicircle, denotes the electron transfer at the oxide/dye/electrolyte interface according to recent analysis on the EIS spectra of the DSSCs,25 was observed in the region of 100–1 Hz. The lifetime of the electrons in the oxide film (τr) can be estimated from the characteristic frequencies of the impedance semicircle at middle frequencies, according to the relation τr = 1/2πfmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency of the mid-frequency peak. As shown in the inset of Fig. 7, the fmax value for the SnO2 NT–TiO2 is ∼4 Hz, much smaller than the values for SnO2 NT (∼7 Hz) and P25 (∼9 Hz), indicating a longer electron lifetime in SnO2 NT–TiO2 film than in SnO2 NT and P25 film.

The differences of these photoelectrodes were further studied by the open-circuit voltage-decay (OCVD) technique which provides a continuous reading of the lifetime as a function of Voc at high-voltage resolution. The electron lifetime is given by τn = −(kT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1, where kT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVoc/dt is the first-order time derivation of the Voc. Fig. 8 shows the electron lifetime as a function of Voc for SnO2 NT–TiO2, SnO2 NT and P25 films. The shape of the OCVD curve for P25 films is consistent with that of the previous reports,26,27 confirming a typical trap-assisted conduction mechanism. The depression seen in the curve at around 0.3 V indicates the presence of surface trap states that could result in recombination of electrons with the electrolyte through tunneling.26 While the dependence of τn on Voc was found to be linear for SnO2 NT–TiO2 and SnO2 NT, indicating the absence of the surface traps. This phenomenon may result from the 1D property of SnO2 NTs. In addition, the τn for SnO2 NT–TiO2 is evidently larger than that of SnO2 NT, which is in accordance with EIS analysis mentioned above.

It is interesting that the Jsc of SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC (∼14.71 mA cm−2) is much higher than that of the P25 DSSC (∼11.44 mA cm−2), even though the amount of dye molecules adsorbed to the SnO2 NT–TiO2 film (0.594 × 10−7 mol cm−2) is less than half of that in the P25 film (1.288 × 10−7 mol cm−2). To a certain extent, Jsc divided by the amount of dye loading (Jsc/dye) represents the charge-collection properties.28,29 From the adsorption amounts and the Jsc values mentioned above, the Jsc/dye value for SnO2 NT–TiO2 is 24.76 × 107 mA mol−1 which is three times higher than that of P25 (8.88 × 107 mA mol−1). This enhanced photocurrent could be attributed to the higher charge collection efficiency of SnO2 NT–TiO2 film. The charge-collection properties of the DSSCs are discussed in terms of the charge-collection time (τc), which considers the differences in the time scales of charge transport and recombination.30 This charge-collection time was obtained by first-order decay kinetics fitting of the transient photocurrent profile using a homogeneous light (532 nm) in a short-circuit condition, as described in the previous work.28 As shown in Fig. 9, the τc of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC is significantly smaller than the P25 DSSC for the entire range of Jsc. Given that the τr of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC (39.8 ms) is slower than the P25 DSSC (17.69 ms) by more than 2 times (Fig. 7), it can be concluded that the charge collection efficiency of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC is higher than the P25 counterpart.

Conclusion
To summarize, we have prepared porous SnO2 nanotubes by electrospinning followed by direct sintering of the as-spun nanofibers. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation process. The resultant SnO2 nanotubes and nanonfibers were deposited on FTO substrates by drop-drying method for use in DSSCs. By TiCl4 treatment, we fabricated the SnO2–TiO2 core–shell structured DSSCs. The PCE value of the SnO2 NT–TiO2 core–shell structured DSSCs (∼5.11%) is more than five times higher than that of SnO2 NT DSSCs (∼0.99%). Moreover, the value of Jsc/dye for SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC is almost three times larger than that of P25 DSSC, indicating an extremely fast charge collection in SnO2 NT–TiO2 DSSC. The results given herein show that the combination of the advantageous features of fast electron transport, slow interfacial electron recombination and large specific surface area is a promising strategy to obtain high-efficiency DSSCs. The simple procedure provides a new approach to achieve the three conflicting requirements simultaneously and may facilitate the development of DSSCs.
