    , Accepted 5th September 2017First published on 5th September 2017AbstractMultifunctional electrocatalyst enabled electrochemical hydrogen/oxygen redox plays pivotal roles in variable energy conversion/storage devices and some coupling devices. The daunting challenge in developing multifunctional electrocatalysts at present is to effectively incorporate multiple active sites into one material. Herein, we presented a general protocol by a controllable pyrolysis/vapor reforming process, which allows for reconstitution to form CoNC nano-units, while preserving Co and Co oxides simultaneously. The material by co-intercalation of these active units into graphene generates outstanding trifunctional activities. The overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are 205 and 360 mV (at 10 mA cm−2), respectively, and the half-wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction is 0.81 V, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art trifunctional electrocatalysts. A maximum power density of 23 mW cm−2 and 1000 stable cycles were realized in the as-prepared material equipped Zn–air battery. This battery further drove overall water splitting for 24 hours, at a faradaic efficiency of ca. 100% and gas production rate of 0.035 and 0.017 mL min−1 for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thus this work offers a general approach to explore other efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for application in renewable energy technologies.
Introduction
The growing problems associated with energy security and environmental pollution have stimulated extensive efforts worldwide for the development of green and renewable energy technologies, including metal–air batteries, fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and solar synthetic reactors.1–7 The hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) and the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are the most crucial electrochemical processes and usually coexist to realize energy storage and conversion in these technologies. Typical examples are the metal–air battery involving ORR and OER, and the water splitting process combining the HER and OER. The development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with low overpotentials and high activities is central for simplifying the design of the electrodes for fuel cells, metal–air batteries and overall water splitting setups.8,9 Noble metals such as RuO2 and IrO2 capable of executing the OER with high catalytic activities still suffer from the limitation of single function.10 Pt-based catalysts, although function well in the ORR, HER and HOR, underperform in the OER.10 Further, the critical drawback of scarcity and high cost render these noble metals less ideal materials for incorporation into bulk production scale devices. Since Pt is still irreplaceable in the HOR,10 the exploitation of low-cost, efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER, ORR and OER still remains a big challenging issue.
Among the non-noble metal alternatives, cobalt-based hybrids have harvested extensive interest, because they are effective in the OER or HER based on the low energy barrier for H adsorption or favorable electrostatic affinity for water dissociation.7,11–15 These monofunctional alternatives were further extended to bifunctional application towards both the HER and OER by manipulation in the electronic structure.7,16 To take a further step towards trifunctional application (HER/OER/ORR), the unsatisfactory ORR activity of cobalt-based materials needs to be improved upon. In this context, previously reported carbon-based electrocatalysts such as nitrogen-doped graphene have shown excellent electrocatalytic activity for the ORR.17–19 Of particular interest, heteroatom doped graphitic carbon and defective graphene have been revealed to be trifunctionally active, although most of which focused on fast ORR/OER kinetics.4,20,21 However, a mechanical combination of cobalt-based materials and N-doped graphene may generate harmonious trifunctional electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the best performance reported to date22,23 is still not unified in one system. In particular, it is not in one electrocatalytic material and under the same pH environment for an overall highly efficient trifunctional electrocatalysis. One of the reasons is due to the lack of efficient structure control for fully utilizing the active sites of the material. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the synthetic method and reaction mechanism of monofunctional units. A mandatory intercalation of such active units into one system likely causes a mutual inhibition of their respective performance. Therefore, design for the simultaneous optimization of monofunctional active units without mutual inhibition is highly desirable and feasible for efficient trifunctional electrocatalysis. Coupling N-doped graphene (NG) with Co-based materials has two merits: one is improvement of the HER/OER electrocatalytic activities of cobalt species via increasing the number of active sites and enhancing the interfacial charge transfer; the other is reinforcement of the ORR activity via electron density modulation of cobalt (cobalt–nitrogen-doped carbon, CoNC).24–29 Besides, the electrocatalytic performance is strongly governed by components, structures and morphologies.30 Inspired by these analyses, only exquisite multiform cobalt species/CoNC nano-units with abundant accessible active sites via unified synthetic processes are technically desirable to derive advanced trifunctional hybrid electrocatalysts.
Herein, we employed a precursor with hydrogen bonding interactions. A controllable nitrogen–carbon pyrolysis/vapor reforming method was demonstrated, for reconstitution to form CoNC nano-units, preserving Co and Co oxides simultaneously. The material by co-intercalation of these active units into highly conductive graphene (D-Co@CNG) generates synergetic trifunctional activities. It displayed only 59, 320 and 230 mV of onset overpotentials for the HER, ORR and OER, with corresponding Tafel slopes of 95, 83 and 130 mV dec−1, respectively, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art trifunctional electrocatalysts. More importantly, excellent stability was revealed for the D-Co@CNG electrode relative to noble metal benchmarks. The robust trifunctional performance further enables the long-term operation of Zn–air batteries (over 1000 cycles per week) and water electrolysis (about 24 hours). An alkaline electrolyzer was fabricated by using D-Co@CNG as both the cathode and anode. This electrolyzer was powered by two series-connected Zn–air batteries based on an air electrode made from the same electrocatalyst. This water-splitting unit can produce stable H2 and O2 with 0.035 and 0.017 mL min−1 gas production rate, respectively. Based on the aforesaid points, it is fair to say that this work puts forth a general framework for the design of robust multifunctional catalysts for zinc–air batteries and overall water splitting setups.
Results and discussion
As illustrated in Fig. 1 and ESI Fig. 1,† cobalt ions are first adsorbed on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) by electrostatic interaction in the mixed solution. Subsequently additive C3N4 polymer or 2-methyl imidazole (2-MIM) molecules can embed or graft on GO, further allowing coordination and spatial separation of graphene oxide and cobalt ions. The anchoring effect of 2-MIM can be attributed to the hydrogen bonding between –OH groups on GO and N moieties on 2-MIM. This was verified by the appearance of a broad peak induced by a hydrogen bond in the range of 2210–3000 cm−1 as described in ESI Fig. 2a.† During pyrolysis, part of the Co(II) components were reduced to form metallic cobalt in the reducing atmosphere formed by C3N4 or 2-MIM decomposition at elevated temperatures.31 More importantly, these metallic cobalt species then acted as the catalyst for the growth of N-doped carbon nano-architectures with the release of cyano fragments (e.g., C2N2+, C3N2+, and C3N3+) from the decomposition of polymeric carbon nitrides.31 This calcination step not only renders incorporation of N and C atoms around Co nanoparticles in a sense reminiscent of chemical vapor deposition, but also facilitates a strong intercalation of the newly formed N-doped carbon–cobalt nano-architectures into N-doped graphene.
 Fig. 1  The preparation and structure of Co@CNG and D-Co@CNG trifunctional electrocatalysts. The raw materials of the synthesis involved Co2+ salt, N source (C3N4 or 2-MIM) and graphite oxide. The final products were obtained by pyrolysis of the precursors, via reforming of vapour containing C/N elements partly on the Co surface to form Co/N/O-decorated graphene hybrids. 
The successful transformation from GO to NG was witnessed by the vanishment of the peaks previously located at 1040 cm−1 (C–O–C), 1415 cm−1 (C–O–H), 1732 cm−1 (CO) and 3400 cm−1 (O–H) in ESI Fig. 2b.† In contrast, the weak absorption bands corresponding to the vibration of CC/CN and C–C/C–N functional groups at around 1551 and 1238 cm−1 were preserved. Cobalt species in D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG were also preserved after the thermal treatment process, as validated by powder XRD analysis (ESI Fig. 3a†). The peaks for D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG centered at 44.3° and 51.7° correspond to the (111) and (200) planes of Co, respectively (JCPDS no. 15-0806); and the peak at 47.1° is attributed to (101) (JCPDS no. 05-0727). This suggests the conversion of the cobalt ion into metallic cobalt during heat treatment. Co bonded with C (JCPDS no. 65-8206) and N (JCPDS no. 65-1458) can also be confirmed by the appearance of peaks at 40.9° and 43.1°, respectively. Additionally, some CoO may also exist at ca. 42.4° (JCPDS no. 65-2902). Further, since metallic cobalt and cobalt oxides in D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG are soluble in acid, while some of them survived in the leaching process (ESI Fig. 3a and b†). This implies that the geometric confinement of part of the cobalt nanoparticles within nitrogen-doped carbon shells has been achieved. As a control sample, CoG was prepared without addition of any nitrogen source with the same synthesis procedure (see the Experimental section in the ESI for more details†). It didn't show obvious peaks characteristic of cobalt crystals in ESI Fig. 3a.† This result is consistent with the very low content of cobalt in the CoG sample (0.45 wt%) from ICP-OES analysis (ESI Table 1†). The control sample of D-Co@CN also didn't give cobalt-related peak signals in ESI Fig. 3a.† This is probably due to the atomic dispersion of cobalt atoms.32 Remarkably, D-Co@CN shows a bigger half-wave width of the peak at 26.1° representative of graphitic carbon compared to other graphene-containing samples. This suggests a lower degree of graphitization thereby contributing less to the conductivity.
Electron microscope images in Fig. 2a and d, ESI Fig. 4e, f and 5† indicate the flake/tube-like hybrid morphology of Co@CNG. The diameter of the N-doped carbon nanotubes is in the range of 20–40 nm with the wall thickness of 4–20 nm (ESI Fig. 5†). It is evident that cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated in the bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes as also shown by some typical TEM images in Fig. 2a and ESI Fig. 5.† Most of the synthesized cobalt nanoparticles shown in Fig. 2c are spherical with an average diameter of ∼20 nm. Besides, a few abnormally large nanoparticles (indicated with green circles in ESI Fig. 5†) were also observed. The graphitic carbon and crystalline cobalt are further proved by the two rings with an interplanar distance of 3.34 and 2.04 Å in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern in Fig. 2b. These two values are indexed to the Co (0 0 2) and Co (1 1 1) diffraction patterns, respectively. The presence of C, N and O elements is confirmed and they are evenly distributed over the whole carbon nanotubes as shown by the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectrum in Fig. 2d. The metallic cobalt concentrates in the inside of the N-doped carbon nanotubes.

With using 2-MIM as a substitute for C3N4 in the synthesis, a wrinkled morphology was obtained as shown in SEM and TEM images in Fig. 2e and ESI Fig. 4g, h and 7.† In a sharp contrast to the characteristic morphology of bulky grain and aggregation in D-Co@NC (ESI Fig. 4c, d, 6c and d†), most cobalt nano-units (light/dark-contrast objects in ESI Fig. 4g and h†) in D-Co@NCG were uniformly decorated on graphene nanosheets (dark grey background) without detachment and aggregation. This is due to the spatial segregation effect of 2-MIM. The part of cobalt nano-units (the average size of 0.3 μm) with light-contrast features were assigned to nanopolyhedrons; the other cobalt nano-units with light-contrast features were ascribed to cobalt nanocrystals with sizes in the range of 5–35 nm. This is also evidenced by the diffraction pattern of crystalline nature in Fig. 2f and coincides with XRD analysis. This indicates the multiformity of cobalt nano-units with smaller sizes. Cobalt nanocrystals reveal a unique characteristic of highly uniform dispersion, as manifested in Fig. 2e and ESI Fig. 7.† 2-MIM has a hydrogen bonding effect with the GO substrate. It is thus assumed that 2-MIM can act as a barrier for spatially segregating cobalt units by this strong interaction and preventing cobalt from sintering at elevated temperatures. A close observation of Fig. 2g and ESI Fig. 7† further reveals that part of the cobalt nanocrystals were embedded in the CN architecture and surrounded by a few graphitic carbon layers with a wall thickness of 1–3 nm. Besides, discrete cobalt and even distribution of N along with C, graphene nanosheets and Co-external carbon layers are revealed in Fig. 2h. The thermal decomposition of 2-MIM is thought to generate fewer carbon–nitrogen fragments compared to C3N4 decomposition in the experiments. It is conceivable that these carbon–nitrogen fragments serve as carbon sources, with the amount only enough for precipitation of a thin nitrogen-doped carbon layer on the cobalt surface. Some cobalt nanoparticles may also keep uncoated with CN layers concurrently.
The Raman spectra of D-Co@CNG, Co@CNG, NG and G are given in Fig. 3a and ESI Fig. 8 and 9.† Compared to other Co-based materials such as Co@CN-800 (ref. 33) and Co carbide/nitride,34 the cobalt content in these hybrids is low. This results in inconspicuous Raman peaks at a low shift from 200 to 800 cm−1 as shown in ESI Fig. 8.† In contrast, the Raman peaks ranging from 800 to 1800 cm−1 that belong to graphitic carbon atoms are more evident.35 These peaks can be deconvoluted into a series of four components, centered at around 1170, 1337, 1473, and 1583 cm−1. The characteristic peaks at around 1337 cm−1 (D-band) and 1583 cm−1 (G-band) are ascribed to the hybridized vibrational mode associated with the edges, and the tangential oscillation as well as vibration from all the sp2 carbon atoms in the graphene, respectively. The intensity ratio of D to G bands (ID/IG) on D-Co@CNG, Co@CNG and NG is slightly higher than that of G (ESI Table 2†). This indicates their slightly lower level in the degree of graphitization due to Co or N dopants in the material. The broad band at about 1170 cm−1 is caused by carbon atoms outside a perfectly planar graphene network, such as aliphatic and amorphous structures.20 The peak at approximately 1473 cm−1 stems from the distorted structures such as five-membered rings or heteroatom incorporation into the graphene hexagonal network.29 In this case, it is nitrogen doping in the carbon matrix which imparts electrocatalytic activities.2,36–39

The elemental composition of the as-prepared electrocatalysts in ESI Fig. 10† indicates C 1s, Co 2p, N 1s and O 1s peaks at ∼284.5, ∼780.0, ∼398.5 and ∼532.5 eV,40 respectively. Notably, no obvious signal of cobalt on CoG can be found. This is attributed to the relatively low cobalt content as manifested by ICP-OES in ESI Table 1.† The high-resolution XPS Co 2p spectra in Fig. 3b revealed metallic Co and Co oxides, as well as a dominating broad mixed zone where Co–N and Co–C bonds can be identified from low to high binding energies.41,42 The formed Co–N bond was further confirmed by N 1s spectra in Fig. 3c and ESI Fig. 11.† The dominant peak in the pyridinic N region shifts from ∼398.04 on NG and Co@CNG to 398.54 on D-Co@CN and D-Co@CNG, suggesting the increasing relative ratio of N in N–Co.41 Furthermore, the absolute content of N in the N–Co bond as determined by deconvolution (ESI Fig. 11†) is 2.48 wt% and 1.83 wt% for D-Co@CN and D-Co@CNG, respectively, as listed in ESI Table 3.† These values are higher than that of Co@CNG (1.70 wt%). N species were also incorporated into the carbon matrix in the form of pyridinic, pyrrolic, quaternary and oxidized configurations. Deconvolution of these four types of nitrogen species was conducted with peaks centred at 398.3, 399.9, 400.9 and 402.9 eV, respectively (ESI Fig. 12†). Integral data in ESI Table 4† show the absolute content of the four N species, in which the pyridinic and graphitic N species are dominant. High pyridinic and graphitic N content could greatly contribute to electrocatalytic activities.43 Notably, D-Co@CN with the absence of graphene presents the lowest quaternary N among the materials. The center of C 1s in Fig. 3d shifts from ca. 284.4 to 284.6 eV after annealing. This shift is probably associated with the newly formed C–N (285.2 eV) bonds, and other factors including the formed C–O (286.0 eV) and CO (287.1 eV).32,44 The interaction between cobalt and the carbon skeleton is clearly verified by the negative shift of the C peak from 284.5 eV on G to 284.3 eV on CoG. This interaction also exists with partial shielding in the presence of abundant N in atomic state doping, which induces a lower electron density at the C surface sites. Note that the half-wave widths of C 1s peaks in the XPS spectra diminish from D-Co@CN to D-Co@CNG, and then to other graphene-containing materials, suggesting overall incremental graphitization.45 O 1s spectra are shown in ESI Fig. 13.† The main peak of the O 1s at approximately 531.8 eV is typical of oxygen in an OH group or hydroxyl species. A shoulder appears at higher binding energies associated with surface bound water (H–O–H).44,46 Doping with N/O induces strong charge redistribution along with possible changes in surface hydrophobicity, and more surface defects on the carbon matrix as confirmed by Raman spectra, contributing to advanced electrocatalytic activities.2,47 The BET specific surface areas of D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG were determined by means of the nitrogen sorption technique (ESI Fig. 14†). It was calculated to be 206 and 58 m2 g−1, respectively. All of these observations manifest that diversified species of cobalt/cobalt oxides, CoNC nanofilms have been successfully co-intercalated into N-doped graphene through the 2-MIM-assisted annealing method.
To demonstrate the multifunctional electrochemical catalytic activities of the hybrids, linear scan voltammetry (LSV) measurements were carried out with a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE). The RRDE test confirms the production of H2, O2 and HO− on the catalysts as shown in Fig. 4a–c and ESI Fig. 16.† The HER activities of the hybrids and the control samples of NG, CoG and EG were evaluated and are compared in ESI Fig. 17a–c.† As can be seen, the introduction of N and Co into the graphene matrix can remarkably enhance the HER activity of the material. In particular, the D-Co@CNG, D-Co@CN and Co@CNG electrodes showed much lower onset overpotentials of ∼57 mV, 148 mV and 132 mV (Fig. 4d), with corresponding lower Tafel slopes of 95 mV per decade, 123 mV per decade and 112 mV per decade (ESI Fig. 17e†), respectively. This implies that the release of molecular hydrogen is the rate-limiting step.48 The overpotentials to achieve the current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4b) for the D-Co@CNG, D-Co@CN, Co@CNG, NG, CoG and G are 169, 266, 260, 413, 497 and 613 mV, respectively. The best HER activity occurred on D-Co@CNG with the lowest onset potential close to that of commercial Pt/C, and also the low overpotential of 205 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2. These values are comparable to some of the well-known non-noble metal HER catalysts in alkaline media (ESI Table 5†). A continuous HER at a given potential was performed to evaluate the durability of the D-Co@CNG catalyst. As shown in ESI Fig. 17d,† a lower degradation in current density (19.5%) can be determined as compared to Pt/C (38.8%) after the 18000 s test, confirming its remarkable long-term electrochemical stability.
 Fig. 4  (a–c) RRDE measurements of H2, O2 evolution and O2 reduction on the Pt/C (20 wt%), Ir/C (20 wt%), D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG electrodes. The Pt-ring electrode was maintained at 0.65 V vs. the RHE for H2 oxidation, at 0.40 V for O2 reduction and at 1.40 V for HO2− oxidation on the disk electrode, respectively. The solid lines and dashed lines indicate the disk and ring signals, respectively. (d and f) Onset overpotential, overpotential at 5 mA cm−2 and half-wave potential for the HER, OER and ORR. 
The LSV curves for the OER are depicted in Fig. 4b and ESI Fig. 18a–c.† Data derived from the LSV curves indicate a similar performance rule to the HER. More specifically, the D-Co@CNG electrode showed the smallest onset overpotential of 230 mV in Fig. 4e (320, 257, 311, 257 and 442 mV for D-Co@CN, Co@CNG, NG, CoG and G, respectively), which is close to that of the Ir/C catalyst (153 mV). The D-Co@CNG electrode only demands overpotentials of 340 and 360 mV to reach 5 and 10 mA cm−2, respectively. These overpotentials compare favorably to the behaviors of previously reported trifunctional electrocatalysts like N, S co-doped graphitic sheets (η 10 mA cm−2 = 370 mV)20 and nitrogen-doped graphene/cobalt embedded porous carbon polyhedron (η 10 mA cm−2 = 430 mV)22 (ESI Table 6†). It is interesting to note that the CoG electrode exhibits much lower onset overpotentials than those of the NG electrode, and a similar trend is observed in the HER measurement. These results reveal that incorporating cobalt into the carbon matrix even in trace amounts is still a more efficient way to reduce the overpotentials for both the HER and OER relative to coupling nitrogen. Joint incorporation of Co and N into carbon yields much better OER activities as demonstrated by D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG. The former displays low overpotentials and a Tafel slope of 130 mV per decade (ESI Fig. 18e†), which suggest its more favorable thermodynamics and kinetic for the OER. Furthermore, the D-Co@CNG catalyst exhibited a better stability compared to Ir/C during the 18000 s chronoamperometric operation (ESI Fig. 18d†).
The evaluation of ORR activity was conducted in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. All electrocatalysts show a mixed kinetic-diffusion control region followed by a well-defined diffusion-limiting current density from high to low potential scan. The LSV curves in Fig. 4c and ESI Fig. 19a and b† highlight an efficient ORR on D-Co@CNG, with a smallest onset overpotential of 320 mV, a half-wave potential of 0.81 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a low Tafel slope of 83 mV per decade (Fig. 4f and ESI Fig. S19e†). This low Tafel slope suggested that the reaction mechanism for the ORR was from Temkin-type adsorption, which is similar to what occurred on Pt/C.49 The performance index above is even comparable to those of Pt/C and most previously reported multifunctional electrocatalysts (see ref. in ESI Table 7†). HO2− generation was monitored during the ORR process using the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The D-Co@CNG, D-Co@CN and Co@CNG electrodes showed a lower current density associated with HO2− oxidation obtained on the Pt-ring (20–30%) compared to other CoG, NG and G (ESI Fig. 19c†). The n value was calculated from RRDE voltammograms to be 3.0–3.5. The comparison of onset potentials and limiting currents of Co@CNG, CoG, NG and G is provided in ESI Fig. 19a and b.† It suggests that N doping determines the onset potential, while cobalt incorporation only dominates the limiting current for the ORR. One should note that the electrochemically active surface area (EASA) of D-Co@CN (267.5 cm2) is much higher than that of D-Co@CNG (57.5 cm2) as calculated in ESI Fig. 20.† However, the latter still exhibits better ORR performance in terms of half-wave potential, limiting current density and Tafel slope. This contrastive result implies that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) may be a less important contributor relative to incorporation of graphene with Co/N species towards the enhanced kinetics. Chronopotentiometric measurements in ESI Fig. 19d† also manifest the excellent ORR stability of D-Co@CNG, with only 7% current reduction. However, a value of ca. 18% of the initial activity was lost for the Pt/C catalyst over the same course of the experiment.
To illuminate the origin of robust trifunctional performance on D-Co@CNG, we have connected the physical structure and component of the catalyst to its HER, OER and ORR activities. Firstly, more promotion in the HER and OER mainly comes from Co doping than N doping, as demonstrated by comparison of CoG and NG. It was also verified that metallic cobalt and CoxOy contribute more to the high HER via different roles with synergistic effects:50 metallic cobalt possesses a suitable binding energy close to Pt for the H atom;51–53 while cobalt oxides can be hydroxylated to dissociate water based on a strong electrostatic affinity to the locally positively charged Co(II/III)/species.54,55 The D-Co@CNG hybrid contains metallic cobalt and Co oxides (as confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis). Thus, abundant OH− will be generated from H2O decomposition and preferentially attach to the Co oxide surface, and the decomposed H tends to adsorb on the nearby cobalt site. This synergistic effect then probably facilitates the HER through the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway based on the case that its Tafel slope (95 mV per decade) is comparable to that for NiO/Ni (ca. 51 mV dec−1).56 NG without cobalt doping also exhibits lower activity relative to CoG for the OER, again revealing the pivotal role of Co in the OER. It has been reported that Co(II) can yield better catalytic ability while Co(III) contributed less to the OER.50 In our case, deconvolution of Co(II) is difficult to conduct in the XPS spectrum because of the complex cobalt components in D-Co@CNG. However, continuous oxygen generation at high potential may induce partial transformation of Co(II) to Co(III), thus resulting in the decrease of catalytic efficiency in the OER test.50
Although CN plays a less important role in the HER and OER, its contribution to the ORR is exclusively prominent. Comparison of Co@CNG, NG, CoG and G in the ORR (ESI Fig. 19b†) obviously demonstrated the critical effect of N on onset potentials. Meanwhile, the effect arising from cobalt still can't be overlooked as it influenced the limiting current. D-Co@CNG, D-Co@CN and Co@CNG which contain abundant highly active pyridinic CoNC units outperform CN in ORR activity. This result suggests that CoNC sites contributed more to the activity in comparison to C–N sites. It has been reported Co–N–C species hold a strong interaction with HO2−,32 thereby facilitating an approximate four electron reduction process for the ORR. Another notable advantage of D-Co@CNG in comparison to D-Co@CN is the incorporation with highly conductive graphene. This incorporation yields a high ion diffusion rate and evidently lower charge transfer resistance (ESI Fig. 22†), which imparts preferable ORR, HER and OER activities. Although incorporation of graphene improved the integral conductivity of the materials, the local charge transfer between different active moieties still cannot be ignored.57 In XPS analysis, we concluded that N incorporation induced the positive charge of adjacent carbon atoms, which are considered to be the active sites for the ORR.43,58 Meanwhile, Co incorporation may also slightly modulate the electron configuration of C at a molecular level, towards more favorable ORR processes. Vice versa, the electronic configuration of Co was changed by C and N. Due to the co-existence of diversified Co species in the material, however, precise structural analysis associated with the HER and OER activities is difficult to conduct. The more complex model and mechanism require further investigation. The surface area is not a dominant factor, but it may still play some degree of electrocatalytic role in D-Co@CNG relative to other materials, except D-Co@CN. All the above results indicate that the remarkable multifunctional electrocatalytic performance of D-Co@CNG could be attributed to the synergistic effect of co-intercalated metallic cobalt, Co oxide and CoNC active units in graphene, together with relatively high conductivity and large surface area.32,50
Since D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG show efficient trifunctional electrocatalysis, we have further constructed a rechargeable zinc–air battery using a porous carbon fiber paper pasted with the hybrids as cathodes. An electrolyte of 6 M KOH + 0.2 M zinc acetate (formed Zn(OH)42−) was used to ensure reversible redox reactions at the Zn anode,21 as illustrated in ESI Fig. 23g.† The Pt/C and Pt/C–Ir/C with a mass ratio of 1:1 were used for comparison. Fig. 5a shows a high power density of around 23 mW cm−2 at D-Co@CNG, higher than that of Co@CNG (18 mW cm−2), Pt/C (20 mW cm−2) and Pt/C–Ir/C (15 mW cm−2). The Pt/C–Ir/C catalyst electrode although delivered a lower charge polarization potential at low current density (ESI Fig. 23a†), with the corresponding highest open circuit potential (OCP) at ca. 1.45 V, it still suffered apparent polarization during discharge especially at a high current rate compared to D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG electrodes, as demonstrated in ESI Fig. 23b.† The D-Co@CNG electrode outperforms the other two electrodes in terms of power density and stability. Further, the voltage remained highest at 1.21 V even after discharge at 10 mA cm−2 for 24 h (ESI Fig. 23c†), with 93.6% of coulombic efficiency. Additionally, charge/discharge on D-Co@CNG also displayed low values of overpotentials at the current densities of both 5 and 10 mA cm−2 after more than 1000 cycles (Fig. 5b and ESI Fig. 23d†). The Zn–air battery equipped with the D-Co@CNG electrode after more than 1000 cycles still outputs sufficiently high OCPs of 1.36 V and 4.01 V (three cells in series) as shown in ESI Fig. 23e and f.† Two and three of the batteries in series power the light-emitting diode (LED) with a light nominal voltage of ≈1.8 and 3.0 V (Fig. 5c and ESI Fig. 23h†), respectively. This result demonstrates the capability of the electrocatalyst in meeting the specific energy and/or power needs for practical applications.

As a proof of concept for the multifunctional electrocatalytic system, we further constructed an integrated water-splitting setup. In this setup, nickel foam wires were pre-coated with D-Co@CNG for both the anode and cathode with comparable performance to its counterpart based on the Pt/C–Ir/C for the HER and OER. The setup was powered by a Zn–air battery using the same D-Co@CNG catalyst as the air cathode, as shown in Fig. 5d and e. This setup operated successfully, as witnessed by visible bubble-releasing processes symbolizing oxygen and hydrogen generation during water-splitting (Fig. 5e, see ESI Movie 1†). Two tubes with volume marks, inserted with the anode and cathode and sealed on the top end with epoxy, were used to collect gases and evaluate the efficiency of water-splitting. Continuous operation of the setup powered by two Zn–air batteries in series yielded a stable gas volume increase for both hydrogen and oxygen with increasing water-splitting time, as recorded in ESI Fig. 24.† The gas volume as a function of the water-splitting time is given in Fig. 5f. It displays a good linear relationship with a slope of 0.035 and 0.017 mL min−1 for hydrogen and oxygen gas, respectively. The volume ratio of H2/O2 was close to the theoretical value of 2:1, as anticipated for hydrogen and oxygen production by water splitting. Faradaic efficiency approaching 100% was obtained during the long-term electrolysis (see the ESI †). All these results demonstrate that D-Co@CNG is a robust trifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a controllable pyrolysis/vapor reforming process for reconstitution to form CoNC nano-units, while preserving Co and Co oxides simultaneously. The co-intercalation of these active monofunctional units into graphene generates three positive effects: (1) the generated highly active Co/CoxOy nano-units promote the HER and OER; (2) incorporation of NC species, especially, the highly active pyridinic Co–N–C imparted high ORR activity; (3) the hybrid with high conductivity and relatively large active surface area offered fast electron transfer and abundant active sites for trifunctional reactions. The newly developed trifunctional electrocatalyst enables a rechargeable Zn–air battery to deliver a maximum power density of around 23 mW cm−2 and excellent charge/discharge performance for over 1000 cycles (one week). The Zn–air batteries can power a water-splitting setup for approximately 24 hours with faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and a gas production rate of 0.035 and 0.017 mL min−1 for hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. Thus, this work puts forth a general strategy for developing multifunctional electrocatalysts towards application in renewable energy technologies.
Experimental
Synthesis of GO
Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared according to the previous literature by Hummers from graphite powder (Aldrich, powder, <20 micron, synthetic).59,60
Synthesis of C3N4
In a typical synthesis, 5 g melamine was first heated at 600 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The resultant product was fully ground to get C3N4 powder.
Synthesis of the cobalt–nitrogen–carbon coupled N-doped graphene hybrid (Co@CNG)
400 mg of the as-prepared GO and 400 mg of cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2·6H2O) were mixed and dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic stirring for 1 h. 2 g of the as-prepared C3N4 was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic stirring for 2 h. The two above suspensions were mixed by magnetic stirring for 1 h. Afterwards, the mixture was freeze-dried for at least 48 h to produce a yellowish-brown Co–C3N4–GO powder. The Co–C3N4–GO powder was then placed in the centre of a quartz tube furnace (Φ = 10 cm, OTF-1200X-100). After pumping and purging the system with Ar three times, the temperature was ramped up to 900 °C at 5 °C min−1 with the feeding of Ar (15 sccm, standard cubic centimeters per minute) at ambient pressure. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h and the resultant product after cooling to room temperature under Ar protection was then treated with a 3 M HCl solution at room temperature for 24 h. The nitrogen/carbon-coated Co on graphene (Co@CNG) was obtained after filtering the mixture, washing with deionized water and ethanol, and drying at 80 °C overnight.
The control sample of CoG and NG was prepared with the same treatment except that C3N4 and CoCl2·6H2O were not introduced during the synthesis process, respectively. SiO2 was used to replace C3N4 in the synthesis without addition of the Co source and finally was removed with concentrated NaOH solution; the product was defined as G. Here SiO2 serves as a space separator like C3N4 to eliminate the influence of explosion. This explosion process will occur on GO via direct pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere at the elevated temperature (explosion temperature at ca. 250 °C). The product by directly annealing GO was defined as extended graphene (EG).
Methyl imidazole assisted synthesis of the cobalt–nitrogen–carbon coupled graphene hybrid (D-Co@CNG)
0.4 g of the as-prepared GO, 2.184 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and 2.232 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) were mixed and dispersed in 160 mL of methanol/ethanol (1:1 in volume) under ultrasonic stirring for 1 h. Then 2.464 g of methyl imidazole in 30 mL of methanol was added into the above dispersion, and the system was reacted under magnetic stirring for 3 days. A precursor was obtained after filtering the mixture, washing with ethanol, and drying overnight. The precursor was sealed with two porcelain boats (4 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.8 cm) and then placed at the end of a quartz tube furnace (Φ = 4 cm, OTF-1100X-100). After purging the system with Ar (200 sccm) for 1 h, the temperature was ramped up to 900 °C at 10 °C min−1 while the precursor still remains at around room temperature. Once the system reached 900 °C, the porcelain boats with the sample were pushed to the middle of the quartz tube with a rigid iron wire from the air outlet. The airflow of Ar was then tuned to 30 sccm and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h before cooling to room temperature. Thus D-CoNG was obtained.
The control sample of D-Co@CN was prepared with the same treatment except that GO was not introduced during the synthesis process.
Synthesis of Ir/C
Activated carbon (Vulcan XC-72R) was first pretreated with 5 M HNO3 at 110 °C for 12 h. Then, the mixture was neutralized with concentrated KOH solution, filtered, washed with double distilled water and dried at 80 °C overnight. The Ir/C catalyst was prepared as follows: 46 mg of pretreated Vulcan XC-72R carbon and 3 mL of potassium hexachloroiridate (K2IrCl6, 20 mM) were dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water under ultrasonic stirring for 0.5 h. An excess NaBH4 solution was added to reduce Ir4+ ions to Ir particles and the reduction reaction was conducted for 24 h under stirring. This mixture was then filtered, washed and dried at 80 °C overnight to obtain an Ir/C composite (20 wt%).
Characterization
Cobalt contents in the synthesized catalytic materials were determined using an Ultima2 inductively coupled plasma OES spectrometer (ICP-OES, Jobin Yvon). The morphology of the catalytic materials was obtained using a JEOL-6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM). The structure and elemental distribution were characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV with a microanalyser whose resolution power is 129 eV. The contents and chemical valences of Co, N, C and O in the materials were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB 250) with an Al K X-ray source at 1487 eV. The chamber pressure was kept below 3 × 10−10 mbar during analysis and specific correction was done by employing a C 1s binding energy of 284.8 eV. Raman spectra were collected from a Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR) using a 633 nm laser. The specific surface areas of the materials were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements carried out using automatic volumetric adsorption equipment (Micromeritics, ASAP2020) at −196 °C, with calculation using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. X-ray power diffraction (XRD) was performed with a Philip X'Pert Pro MPP diffractometer using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source at the scan rate of 1° min−1. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a VERTEX 70 infrared spectrometer.
Electrochemical measurements
Three-electrode measurements were performed with a CHI660e electrochemical working station (CH Instrument Inc.) in a three-electrode cell at room temperature. The Pt net (1 cm2) and the Ag/AgCl saturated with KCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A glassy carbon (GC) electrode covered by the as-prepared catalyst was used as the working electrode. For the preparation of the working electrode, a specific amount of the catalytic material, commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst or 20 wt% Ir/C catalyst was dispersed in a suspension containing 950 μL of isopropyl alcohol and 50 μL of 20 wt% Nafion solution (DuPont, USA) under ultrasonic stirring. The slurry was pipetted with a micro-syringe and spread on the polished GC electrode surface and the electrode was dried under an infrared lamp (catalyst loading 0.2 mg cm−2). 1 M KOH and 0.1 M KOH aqueous solutions saturated with nitrogen/oxygen were employed as the electrolyte for the HER/OER and ORR, respectively. The potentials, measured against an Ag/AgCl electrode, were converted to the potentials versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) by RHE calibration. The details of the calculation of the number of electrons transferred and the percentage of HO2− generated during the oxygen reduction, and RHE calibration are given in the following sections. All measurements with assessment of activity are IR-drop corrected.
For Zn–air battery testing, the ORR air electrode was prepared by uniformly coating the as-prepared catalyst ink or Pt/C–Ir/C (1:1 in mass ratio) on a carbon paper electrode (catalyst loading 0.5 mg cm−2). A Zn plate was used as the anode. 6 M KOH + 0.2 M Zn(Ac)2 was used as an electrolyte of the Zn–air battery.
For the preparation of the water splitting electrodes, the nickel foam was pre-treated in 3 M hydrochloric acid solution for 30 min at room temperature in order to remove oxides on the surface. The nickel foam was rolled up along with the end of a copper wire. The superfluous copper end was coated with epoxy resin to resist the electrolyte. The catalyst was loaded by adsorbing a catalyst ink (10 mg mL−1) on the pre-treated nickel foam, followed by drying at 80 °C. The catalyst loading is about 1 mg cm−2. For the calculation of H2 and O2 production volumes during the water splitting, a calibration was conducted by deducting the corresponding volumes of Cu wire.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Raman spectra of D-Co@CNG, Co@CNG, NG and G; (b–d) high-resolution Co 2p, N 1s and C 1s XPS spectra of different materials.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–c) RRDE measurements of H2, O2 evolution and O2 reduction on the Pt/C (20 wt%), Ir/C (20 wt%), D-Co@CNG and Co@CNG electrodes. The Pt-ring electrode was maintained at 0.65 V vs. the RHE for H2 oxidation, at 0.40 V for O2 reduction and at 1.40 V for HO2− oxidation on the disk electrode, respectively. The solid lines and dashed lines indicate the disk and ring signals, respectively. (d and f) Onset overpotential, overpotential at 5 mA cm−2 and half-wave potential for the HER, OER and ORR.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Discharge polarization curve and power density curve of zinc–air batteries using D-Co@CNG, Co@CNG, Pt/C–Ir/C and Pt/C electrodes. (b) Discharge/charge cycling curves of two-electrode rechargeable Zn–air batteries at a current density of 5 mA cm−2. (c) Photographs of a blue LED (3.0 V) powered by three Zn–air batteries integrated in series (after cycles). (d and e) Gas collection setup of electrochemical water splitting and the optical images of electrodes before and after water splitting powered by two Zn–air batteries in series. (f) O2 and H2 production volumes as a function of water-splitting time (calibration with cable volume).
