    , Accepted 14th December 2016First published on 14th December 2016AbstractSearching for promising nontoxic and air-stable perovskite absorbers for solar cell applications has drawn extensive attention. Here, we show that a promising perovskite absorber should exhibit a high electronic dimensionality. Semiconductors that exhibit a high structural dimensionality, but a low electronic dimensionality have less promise as an absorber, because of barriers to isotropic current flow, enhanced electron/hole effective masses and fundamentally deeper defect states (more effective at causing recombination). Our concept accounts for the device performance of the perovskite-based solar cells reported in literature so far.

Conceptual insights
A promising photovoltaic absorber should exhibit the following properties: high optical absorption, small carrier effective masses, and dominant defects that yield shallow levels. Structural dimensionality has been commonly used to provide one basis for desirable photovoltaic properties. Here, we introduce the concept of electronic dimensionality – the connectivity of the atomic orbitals that comprise the lower conduction band and upper valence band. We show that the electronic dimensionality accounts for photovoltaic properties much better than the structural dimensionality, with high electronic dimensionality providing the opportunity for (though not guaranteeing) high photovoltaic performance.

Introduction
Despite the rapid improvement in record power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the past six years, demonstrating the great potential of organic–inorganic lead (Pb) halide perovskite (ABX3) solar cells,1–6 the commercialization of this emerging photovoltaic technology is still facing serious challenges, most notably cell instability against moisture and temperature and the inclusion of toxic Pb. Developing nontoxic or low-toxicity and air-stable halide perovskite-based solar cells has attracted extensive attention.7–20 Theoretical studies have shown that the superior photovoltaic properties of lead halide perovskite absorbers are partially attributed to their unique electronic features, including the Pb 6s2 lone pair that causes strong Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding coupling, and the high symmetry of the perovskite structure.21–23 Therefore, searching for alternative Pb-free halide perovskites has focused on halide compounds containing Sn2+, Ge2+, Bi3+, and Sb3+ cations, which exhibit ns2 lone pairs.24 These metal cations are known to form octahedra with halogen anions, which represent the required structural unit for forming the perovskite structures and their alternatives (hereafter, referred as nonperovskites).25 Here, perovskites and nonperovskites refer to the structures consisting of corner-sharing and non-corner-sharing (e.g., edge-sharing, face-sharing, or even isolated) [BX6] octahedra, respectively. These perovskites and nonperovskites can also be categorized by their structural dimensionality, i.e., 3D, 2D, 1D, 0D,25 and even a fractional dimensionality, as will be defined later. A large number of Pb-free halide perovskites and nonperovskites with a wide range of bandgaps and different bandgap characteristics (direct versus indirect) have been reported.11,13–15,26–37 So far, only Sn-based 3D perovskites have produced solar cells with reasonable PCEs;7–10 other Ge-, Bi-, and Sb-based perovskites and nonperovskites have not produced efficient devices.11,12,29,35,37,38 Therefore, it is important to fully understand the trend of bandgaps and other photovoltaic properties of all reported materials and the causes for the inferior photovoltaic device performances.
Conventionally, structural dimensionality has been used as one metric to account for photovoltaic properties and device performances of absorbers.35,39,40 This argument relies in part on the notion that current needs to effectively travel between contacts in a photovoltaic device before recombination and, given randomly oriented grains in an absorber film, the current path will be more direct if the transport properties are isotropic. While this notion is successful for most absorbers, it fails for some others. In this work, we introduce a new concept, electronic dimensionality, which describes the connectivity of the atomic orbitals that comprise the lower conduction band (LCB) and the upper valence band (UVB), to help understand photovoltaic properties such as bandgaps, carrier mobilities, defect levels and device performances of all reported halide perovskites and nonperovskites. While some perovskites are both structurally and electronically 3D, some perovskites are structurally 3D, but exhibit lower-dimensional electronic structures. We show that, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the photovoltaic properties and device performance, the electronic dimensionality must be considered. Our results suggest that a promising photovoltaic absorber should have a high electronic dimensionality. Low electronic dimensionality implies that, at a minimum, the absorber films must be grown with special crystallographic orientation to facilitate effective carrier transport and collection. Our results also provide critical guidance for searching for promising Pb-free perovskite-based photovoltaic absorbers and for fabricating efficient devices.
Results and discussion
Perovskite and nonperovskite structural dimensionality has significant impact on the properties that are important for photovoltaic devices, including bandgap, carrier effective masses, optical absorption and defect properties. Fig. 1 summarizes the experimental optical bandgaps and device performances of some metal iodide perovskites and nonperovskites. For Pb-based iodide perovskites (red symbols), 3D MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3), FAPbI3 (FA = HC(NH2)2) and CsPbI3 have bandgaps of 1.52 eV,26 1.48 eV,26 and 1.67 eV,26 respectively, which are suitable for single-junction solar cell applications. Layered perovskites can be structurally derived from their 3D analogues by slicing along specific crystallographic planes.25,41,42 The most common structure is the (100)-oriented type with the general chemical formula of (RNH3)2(MA)n−1BnX3n+1 (R indicates an alkyl or aryl group, and n is the number of [PbI6] octahedra layers), which is obtained by stacking n perovskite layers along the [100] direction of the parent 3D structure, separated by the long spacer ammonium cations RNH3+. The thickness of the parent octahedra layers can be controlled by varying the molar ratio between the large organic cation and the parent perovskite precursors. Here, the structural dimensionalities of the single-layered (n = 1) and the infinite-layered (n = ∞) perovskites are 2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the dimensionality of a multilayered perovskite can semi-quantitatively be expressed as 3 − 1/n, i.e., with values between 2 and 3 (see the horizontal axis of Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 1  (a) Experimental optical bandgaps of some iodide perovskites (diamond symbols) and nonperovskites (triangle symbols) as a function of crystal dimensionality. For the dot-center symbols, optical bandgaps were determined by excluding the exciton band at low temperature. The structural dimensionality of an n-layered perovskite is defined as 3 − 1/n. Similarly, the structural dimensionality of the compounds that comprise double-[BX6]-chains is qualitatively defined as 1.5, and that for bioctahedra-based compounds as 0.5. (b) Highest recorded power conversion efficiencies for some iodide perovskite and nonperovskite absorber materials. The red, violet, wine, blue, and olive symbols indicate Pb-, Sn-, Ge-, Bi-, Sb-based halides, respectively. “Cn” indicates CnH2n+1NH3, “C6-2” indicates C6H5(CH2)2NH3, “C1I” indicates NH2C(I)NH2, “FA” indicates HC(NH2)2, and “HA” indicates C5N3H11. The detailed data for a and b are given in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† respectively. 
The bandgap of a 2D single-layered perovskite (RNH3)2PbI4 can be tuned by controlling factors such as the interlayer spacing (i.e., the length of the spacing cation RNH3) and the structural distortion within the perovskite layer,43 because increasing the interlayer spacing and the degree of distortion can decrease the band widths, particularly, of the LCB and the UVB. The bandgap of (RNH3)2PbI4 is 2.57 eV,44 2.70 eV,45 2.82 eV,46 and 2.88 eV,47 when the spacing cation is C6H5(CH2)2NH3 (PEA), C6H13NH3, C9H19NH3, and C12H25NH3, respectively. The increasing trend of bandgap should be partially attributed to the increasing interlayer spacing caused by the increasing length of the organic molecular cations. Interestingly, a recently reported 2D single-layered perovskite (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2, which consists of SCN− anion-terminated octahedra layers, has a relatively small bandgap of 2.1–2.3 eV,48,49 primarily because of its small interlayer spacing. The bandgaps of the multilayered (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskite family members are shown in Fig. 1a. As n increases to 2 and 3, the bandgap decreases to 2.32 eV44 and 2.1 eV,39 respectively. As n further increases to 6 and 10, the structural dimensionality becomes closer to 3 and, correspondingly, the bandgap becomes close to that of 3D MAPbI3 (n = ∞).50 The similar n dependence of bandgap is also observed in other families of layered perovskites including (C6H13NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1,45 (PA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (PA = C3H7NH3),51 and (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (BA = C4H9NH3).52 (NH2C(I)NH2)3PbI5 is a structurally 1D perovskite consisting of corner-sharing [PbI6] chains, and has a large bandgap of 3.18 eV.53 (MA)4PbI6·2H2O consists of isolated [PbI6] octahedra and should be considered as a 0D nonperovskite because the [PbI6] octahedra lose the “corner-sharing” feature. The bandgap of (MA)4PbI6·2H2O is as large as 3.87 eV.46 δ-CsPbI3 consists of double-chains of non-corner-sharing [PbI6] octahedra and has a structural dimensionality of 1.5 (i.e., 2 − 1/2 for double-chains). The 1.5D δ-CsPbI3 has a bandgap (3.14 eV54) that is much larger than that of the cubic 3D CsPbI3 (1.67 eV), although they are polymorphs. On the basis of these literature results, we conclude that the general trend is that the bandgap increases with decreasing of structural dimensionality.
As seen in Fig. 1a, the Sn-based halides (violet symbols) exhibit a similar structural dimensionality-bandgap dependence as that found in the Pb-based halides.55,56 3D MASnI3, FASnI3, and CsSnI3 have bandgaps of 1.20 eV,26 1.41 eV,26 and 1.30 eV,26 respectively. 2D (PEA)2SnI4, 1D (NH2C(I)NH2)3SnI5, and 0D (MA)4SnI6·2H2O, have bandgaps of 2.19 eV,57 3.02 eV,46 3.54 eV,46 respectively. The bandgaps of the Sn-based halides are lower than that of Pb-based counterparts, primarily because of the higher energy levels of Sn 5s orbitals as compared to Pb 6s orbitals. Ge-based 3D halide perovskites are expected to have bandgaps smaller than those of Sn- and Pb-based counterparts, because the Ge 4s orbitals are higher in energy than Sn 5s and Pb 6s orbitals. However, in contrast to the expectation, the Ge-based 3D halide perovskites exhibit large bandgaps as compared to the Sn- and Pb-based perovskites; for example, 3D AGeI3 (A = MA, FA, etc.) have bandgaps ranging from 1.63 to 2.8 eV, depending on the A cation.38,58–60 These anomalously large bandgaps are due to the structural distortion of the [GeI6] octahedra caused by the small ionic radius (0.73 Å) of Ge2+, which is much smaller than the Sn2+ and Pb2+ cations (1.02 Å and 1.19 Å, respectively).61 The small Ge2+ cation cannot sustain the regular [GeI6] octahedra.62 Instead, the Ge2+ cation deviates from the octahedra center, forming three short Ge–I bonds (2.73–2.77 Å) and three long Ge–I bonds (3.26–3.58 Å).58
Recently, trivalent Bi3+ and Sb3+ cations also have been used to replace Pb to form Pb-free halide perovskites.11–14,29–31,37,63–70 However, the resulting compounds expressed by the general chemical formula of A+3B3+2X−9 have to crystallize into lower-dimensional structures to keep charge neutrality. There are two typical polymorphs for A3B2X9. One is a vacancy-ordered bilayered perovskite structure, with chemical formula expressed as A3□B2X9 (□ indicates B vacancy), where each one □ layer and two B-atom layers are alternatively stacked along the 〈111〉 direction of the parent perovskite structure.25,29 These bilayered A3B2X9 perovskites have a structural dimensionality of 2.5 (i.e., 3 − 1/2 for n = 2) and the bandgaps are on the order of 2 eV (e.g., (NH4)3Bi2I9: 2.04 eV;13 Rb3Bi2I9: 2.1 eV;14 and Cs3Sb2I9: 2.05 eV29). The other is a nonperovskite phase A3B2X9 consisting of A+ cations and isolated [B2X9]3− units (each [B2X9] unit consists of two face-sharing [BX6] octahedra). Here, the structural dimensionality of A+3[B2X9]3− is considered as 0.5 (i.e., 1 − 1/2 for bioctahedra), higher than those consisting of isolated [BX6] octahedra (i.e., 0D). Because of the further lower crystal dimensionality, the A3B2X9 nonperovskites have bandgaps much larger than those of their bilayered perovskite counterparts. For example, Cs3Bi2I9 and (MA)3Bi2I9 nonperovskites have bandgaps of 2.86 eV71 and 2.9 eV,37 respectively. However, some groups reported much smaller bandgaps for Cs3Bi2I9 and (MA)3Bi2I9 nonperovskites.11,12,65,66,68 It is known that low-dimensional semiconductors generally exhibit an exciton band below the absorption edge. However, these groups determined the bandgaps from the exciton band, rather than the fundamental absorption band edges, leading to the underestimated bandgap values.
Most of the reported bandgap values of the materials shown in Fig. 1a correlate well with the structural dimensionality. We show that the underlying reason is that these materials have the same structural and electronic dimensionality. It is their electronic dimensionalities that determine the bandgap values. To help understand the effects of structural and electronic dimensionality on the photovoltaic properties of perovskite materials, we show DFT calculated photovoltaic properties for prototype perovskite materials consisting of the same elements of Cs, Pb, and I, but different crystal dimensionalities, i.e., 3D CsPbI3 (cubic, Pmm),72 2D Cs2PbI4 (following K2NiF4,73 tetragonal, I4/mmm), 1D Cs3PbI5 (following [CH3SC(NH3)2]3SnI5,74 orthorhombic, Pnam), and 0D Cs4PbI6 (following Cs4PbBr6,75,76 rhombohedral, Rc), which consist of 3D network, 2D single-layers and 1D single-chains of [PbI6] octahedra, and isolated [PbI6] octahedra, respectively (see Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b and c show the calculated band structures and optical absorption spectra of these materials, respectively. CsPbI3 exhibits a direct bandgap at the R point. The valence band maximum (VBM) consists of Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding states, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed mainly of Pb 6p states. It is important to note that the CBM- and VBM-deriving Pb 6s, 6p, and I 5p atomic orbitals connect 3-dimentsionally, exhibiting a 3D electronic dimensionality. Because of this 3D electronic dimensionality, both the VBM and CBM are dispersive along all directions, leading to mobile charge carries along all directions. Furthermore, CsPbI3 exhibits high and isotropic optical absorption because of the p–p transition. These results are consistent with the well-established literature on 3D halide perovskites.77,78

2D Cs2PbI4 has a direct bandgap of 1.90 eV at the M point (see the second panel of Fig. 2b), which is much larger than that of 3D CsPbI3 (1.48 eV). The calculated band structure reveals dispersive characters for the LCB and UVB for the 2D Cs2PbI4 perovskite along the M–X and A–R directions, which are parallel to the [PbI6] octahedra layers, indicating that the carriers are mobile within the layers. This is because this 2D perovskite also exhibits a 2D electronic dimensionality, i.e., the CBM- and VBM-deriving Pb 6s, 6p, and I 5p atomic orbitals connect in the octahedra layers. However, there is almost no orbital connection along the direction perpendicular to the octahedra layers. As a result, there is almost no dispersion for the LCB and UVB along the M–A direction (i.e., [001]). Therefore, the charge carriers exhibit almost infinite effective masses along the M–A direction and are immobile across the layers; that is, the charge carriers are confined within the 2D layers. Also, because of the 2D electronic dimensionality associated with the layered structure, the optical absorption coefficients (α) of the 2D Cs2PbI4 perovskite exhibit a strongly anisotropic character (see the second panel of Fig. 2c). The α along the [001] direction crossing the layers (blue dotted line) is much weaker for low energy photons than those along the [100] and [010] directions parallel to the layers (black solid and red dashed lines, respectively). There is no noticeable absorption until around 0.3 eV above the bandgap along the [100] direction. However, because of the p–p transition feature, Cs2PbI4 still exhibits a high total absorption coefficient and may still be used as the top cell in tandem solar cell applications. These results are generally consistent with our previous study on the 2D perovskite (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2.48 Because of the 2D electronic dimensionality, both LCB and UVB have slightly narrower band widths, leading to a lower VBM, a higher CBM and, therefore, a larger bandgap as compared to its 3D counterpart CsPbI3.79–81
1D Cs3PbI5 exhibits an indirect bandgap of 2.80 eV with the VBM at the T point and the CBM at the Γ point. The LCB and the UVB are dispersive only along the T–R and the Γ–X directions, respectively, which are parallel to the [PbI6] octahedra chains. This is because the CBM- and VBM-deriving Pb 6s, 6p, and I 5p atomic orbitals connect only along the octahedra chains, but do not connect along the directions perpendicular to the chains. Therefore, this structurally 1D material also exhibits a 1D electronic dimensionality. The bands along the directions perpendicular to the chains (i.e., U–X, Γ–T, and R–S) are fairly nondispersive, indicating poor carrier mobility across the chains. The LCB and UVB are much narrower, leading to the increased bandgap as compared to its 3D and 2D counterparts. The optical absorption coefficients of Cs3PbI5 are anisotropic. The absorptions along the directions perpendicular to the chains (the blue dotted and the red dashed lines) are much weaker than that along the chain direction (black solid line) for photons in the region of about 1 eV above the bandgap. 0D Cs4PbI6 exhibits a direct bandgap of 3.44 eV at the Γ point. The LCB and the UVB are nondispersive along all directions because of the isolation of the [PbI6] octahedra, in which the CBM- and VBM-deriving Pb 6s, 6p, and I 5p atomic orbitals do not connect. Therefore, this structurally 0D perovskite also exhibits a 0D electronic dimensionality, which is fundamentally responsible for the large bandgap. On the basis of these results, 1D and 0D perovskites are not promising photovoltaic absorbers. These results explain why all 1D and 0D perovskites and nonperovskites shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 1 exhibit large bandgap values.
Recently, layered (2D) lead iodide-based perovskites have attracted much attention for solar cell applications because of their higher environmental stability and film quality. Among the 2D single-layered perovskites,52,82–84 (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 has shown the highest PEC of 3.23%,84 which is still much lower than the values attainable for the 3D perovskites. An obvious way to enhance the PCE is to increase the electronic/structural dimensionality by increasing the layer number n.39,50 To illustrate this, we examined the photovoltaic-relevant properties of a family of Csn+1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskites by DFT calculations. Fig. 3a shows the crystal structure of the n = 4 member. Fig. 3b shows the calculated bandgaps of the Csn+1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite family. The calculated bandgap for the n = 1 member is 1.90 eV. As n increases to 10, the bandgap steadily decreases to 1.51 eV, which is fairly close to that of the 3D counterpart (n = ∞) CsPbI3 (1.48 eV), explaining the experimental trend shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 3c shows the effective carrier masses calculated from the band structures (Fig. 3d). It is important to note that the electronic dimensionality is the same as the structural dimensionality for this system. The in-plane effective masses of both electron and hole (e.g., along the M–X direction) decrease as n increases. However, increasing n up to 10 cannot remove the anisotropic nature of the carrier transport properties. The out-of-plane effective electron mass (i.e., along the M–A direction) also decreases as n increases; however, the hole mass remains almost infinite for the layered perovskites (at least for n = 1–10). For the optical properties, increasing the n value significantly enhances the optical absorption, because of the decreased bandgap and reduced anisotropy in the optical response (Fig. 3e). Therefore, the trend of the electronic and optical properties and carrier mobility can be fundamentally understood by the structural and electronic dimensionality. Smith et al. used the n = 3 member of (PEA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite family as absorbers in solar cells, which achieved a PEC of 4.73%.39 Moreover, as is evident from the structure,48 these layered perovskites should be grown with the layers perpendicular to the substrates to achieve better photovoltaic properties, including higher carrier mobility and higher optical absorption, and thus higher PECs. Most recently, Tsai et al.85 have successfully obtained vertically aligned (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films via the “hot-casting” method. The best PECs of their solar cells reached to 11.44% and 12.52%, respectively, which are much higher than those based on horizontally aligned films (4.02% and 2.39% for (BA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 and (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13, respectively);52 however, they are still lower than those for the 3D lead iodide perovskites, presumably because of the properties associated with the lower electronic dimensionality of these layered perovskite materials, e.g., larger bandgaps.

The above materials exhibit the same structural and electronic dimensionality. Therefore, the bandgap trend, optical properties, and device performance can be explained well by the structural dimensionality. However, there are perovskites exhibiting electronic dimensionalities lower than their structural dimensionalities. For these perovskites, the trend of bandgap and optical properties can no longer be explained solely by the structural dimensionality; the electronic dimensionality must be considered. There are two major causes for lower electronic dimensionality: structural and chemical deviations.
The structural deviation is related to the rotation and/or distortion of [BX6] octahedra. It is known that the bandgap of a perovskite can be affected by the structural distortion.25,43,86,87 Here, we show that the trend of the changes of photovoltaic properties caused by structural distortion can be qualitatively understood by the change of the electronic dimensionality. To understand this, we choose ideal 3D CsPbI3 and 2D Cs2PbI4 perovskites as examples, in which all the Pb–I–Pb bond angles are 180°. For simplicity, we only change the in-plane Pb–I–Pb bond angle (denoted as θ in Fig. 4a) but fix the out-of-plane Pb–I–Pb bond angle.43 In addition, all Pb–I bond lengths are the same (no distortions introduced to the octahedra). Fig. 4b summarizes the calculated bandgaps as a function of the in-plane Pb–I–Pb bond angle θ. As the θ decreases from 180° to 136.4°, the bandgap of 3D CsPbI3 increases slowly from to 1.48 eV to 1.66 eV, while the bandgap of 2D Cs2PbI4 increases rapidly from 1.89 eV to 2.51 eV. Fig. 4c shows the calculated band structures, and Fig. 4d and e show the VBM- and CBM-associated charge density maps on the (001) plane (i.e., the ab plane). For the ideal 3D CsPbI3 perovskite (see the first panels of Fig. 4c–e), the VBM is composed of strongly coupled I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals, while the CBM mainly consists of Pb 6p orbitals, among which, Pb 6px, 6py and 6pz orbitals contribute equally to the CBM. The rotation of the [PbI6] octahedra does not change the structural dimensionality, i.e., 3D, but it does lower the connectivity of I 5p and Pb 6s orbitals and the connectivity (overlap) of Pb 6px, and 6py orbitals, leading to a reduced electronic dimensionality. For the θ = 136.4° CsPbI3 (see the second panels of Fig. 4c–e), the in-plane I atoms are off the centers of the line of two-neighboring Pb atoms, which reduces the in-plane orbital overlap between Pb and I atoms. Interestingly, the Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding coupling is significantly weakened, which makes the UVB narrower and thus the VBM lower and less dispersive. Also, because of the structural distortion, the Pb 6px- and 6py-derived conduction bands also become narrower and contribute little to the LCB. The Pb 6pz-derived bands are less affected by the in-plane structural distortion and are slightly narrowed, making the VBM slightly higher in energy. As a result, the distortion-induced bandgap widening for CsPbI3 is relatively small (Fig. 4b). It should be noted that the structural distortion slightly reduces the connectivity of the atomic orbitals that comprise the LCB and UVB; therefore, the electronic dimensionality is slightly less than 3, though it is difficult to assign an exact value.

(c) Calculated band structures and (d) VBM- and (e) CBM-associated charge density maps on the (001) plane for ideal undistorted (θ = 180°) and distorted (θ = 136.4°) CsPbI3 and Cs2PbI4 perovskites. 
For the ideal 2D Cs2PbI4 perovskite (see the third panels of Fig. 4c–e), the electronic properties have been discussed above. Here, it should be noted that the LCB consists mainly of only Pb 6px and 6py orbitals. The Pb 6pz orbitals contribute little to the LCB, because the Pb 6pz-derived bands are largely narrowed because of the 2D structure.79 For the θ = 136.4° Cs2PbI4 (see the forth panels of Fig. 4c–e), again, the VBM becomes lower and less dispersive, because the Pb 6s–I 5p antibonding coupling is weakened by the structural distortion. Additionally, the Pb 6px- and 6py-derived bands, which account for the CBM, are narrowed because of the structural distortion, effectively raising the CBM level. As a result, the in-plane-distortion-induced bandgap widening of structurally-2D Cs2PbI4 is much larger than that for structurally-3D CsPbI3. Therefore, structural distortion can significantly affect the bandgaps of 2D layered perovskites, explaining the “scattered” nature of bandgaps for 2D layered perovskites.43 The electronic dimensionality of these distorted layered perovskites should be considered lower than 2, but it is difficult to define it quantitatively.
The above correlation between the structural distortion and the electronic structure accounts for the bandgap increasing from the cubic phase (ideal perovskite) to the tetragonal and orthorhombic phases (distorted perovskites) for lead halide perovskites.26,88–90 As mentioned above, because of the extremely small ionic radius of the Ge2+ cation compared to halogen anions, the structural distortions in Ge-based perovskites are fairly large, leading to the bandgaps that are larger than the Sn- and Pb-based counterparts.38,58–60
To help understand how chemical deviations can lower the electronic dimensionality as compared to structural dimensionality, we calculate the band structures of two prototype double perovskites Cs2SrPbI6 and Cs2NaBiI6, whose bandgap values are shown in the top left corner of Fig. 1a. These double perovskites are structurally 3D, but have bandgaps significantly larger than the 3D single-B-cation perovskites, e.g., CsPbI3, MAPbI3, FAPbI3. Fig. 5a shows a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of the 3D CsPbI3 perovskite, which can be regarded as a nominal “double” perovskite of Cs2PbPbI6, which is isostructural to Cs2AgBiBr6 (i.e., in the Fmm space group). We compare the DFT calculated photovoltaic properties of this nominal and a real double perovskite such as Cs2SrPbI6 (Fig. 5b). It is seen that Cs2SrPbI6 is composed of a 3D octahedra network of alternatively-corner-shared [SrI6] and [PbI6] octahedra and, therefore, exhibits a 3D structural dimensionality. However, it should be noted that the [PbI6] octahedra are isolated by the [SrI6] analogues.

In figure e, d, i and j, the relative VBM and CBM positions of Cs2PbPbI6 and Cs2SrPbI6 are aligned by matching core levels. 

Fig. 5c and d show the calculated band structures for Cs2PbPbI6 and Cs2SrPbI6. It is seen that Cs2PbPbI6 exhibits a direct bandgap with both VBM and CBM located at the Γ point. The VBM consists of I 5p–Pb 6s antibonding states while the CBM consists mainly of Pb 6p states (see the calculated charge density maps of the VBM and CBM, as shown in Fig. 5e and g, respectively). It should be noted that both the VBM and the CBM derived from the 3D corner-sharing [PbI6] octahedra are relatively dispersive, leading to reasonably good carrier transport properties. For the double perovskite Cs2SrPbI6, the calculated band structure exhibits an indirect bandgap of 3.05 eV with the VBM at the Γ point and the CBM at the L point. This bandgap value is much larger than that of 3D CsPbI3 (1.48 eV), but is comparable to the calculated bandgap of 0D Cs4PbI6 (3.44 eV).91 The VBM and CBM of Cs2SrPbI6 consist of I 5p–Pb 6s antibonding states and mainly Pb 6p states, respectively, similar to Cs2PbPbI6; however, the [SrI6] octahedra do not make contribution to the CBM and VBM. Therefore, the CBM- and VBM-deriving Pb 6s, 6p, and I 5p atomic orbitals ([PbI6] octahedra) do not connect (see Fig. 5f and h), giving the double perovskite Cs2SrPbI6 effectively a 0D electronic dimensionality. Therefore, the LCB and UVB bands are fairly nondispersive, resembling the electronic properties of the 0D perovskites.
The 0D electronic dimensionality has significant effects on the properties of point defects in the absorber materials. Fig. 5i and j show the calculated transition levels of vacancies in Cs2PbPbI6 and Cs2SrPbI6, respectively. For Cs2PbPbI6, the (0/1−) transition of VCs and the (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transitions of VPb are below the VBM and therefore are inert. For VI, the (0/1+) transition is located 0.28 eV below the CBM, while the (0/1−) transition is above the CBM. These results indicate that Cs2PbPbI6 exhibits good defect tolerance, consistent with previous reports on 3D MAPbI3.78,92,93 In contrast, Cs2SrPbI6 systematically exhibits deeper defect transition levels than Cs2PbPbI6. The (0/1−) transition of VCs is located at 0.17 eV above the VBM. The (0/1−) and (1−/2−) transitions are located at 0.15 eV and 0.40 eV above the VBM, respectively. The (0/1+) and (0/1−) transitions are located at 0.50 eV and 0.39 eV below the CBM, respectively. These deep defects may act as electron traps, hole traps, and/or recombination centres, which deteriorate the device performance. The deep nature of the defects in Cs2SrPbI6 can be qualitatively explained by the 0D electronic dimensionality, causing lower VBM and higher CBM than its 3D counterpart Cs2PbPbI6, which is similar to the argument detailed for the 2D (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2 perovskite.81
The electronic dimensionality can also explain the photovoltaic-relevant properties of Bi-based double B-cation perovskites such as Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br and Cl),15,32,94,95 and (MA)2KBiCl6,33 which have recently attracted significant attention. The bromide Cs2AgBiBr6, and chlorides Cs2AgBiCl6 and (MA)2KBiCl6 exhibit indirect bandgaps of 1.95 eV,15 2.77 eV,32 and >3.04 eV,33 respectively. Cs2AgBiI6 is expected to have a smaller bandgap; however, it cannot be readily synthesized because of the negative decomposition energy (Cs2AgBiI6 → 1/2CsAg2I3 + 1/2Cs3Bi2I9, −0.47 eV).96 Like the prototype compounds Cs2SrPbI6 and Cs2NaBiI6, the Ag- and Bi-based double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 are electronically 0D, although structurally 3D. Taking Cs2AgBiBr6 as an example, the DFT calculated band structure shows that the VBM is mainly derived from Ag 4d–Br 5p antibonding states, whereas the CBM is mainly derived from Bi 6p states.96 However, as Bi 6s orbitals do not contribute to the VBM because of their lower energy positions as compared to the Ag 4d orbitals, the VBM-deriving Ag 4d and Br 5p orbitals cannot connect 3-dimensionally because the [AgBr6] octahedra are isolated by the adjacent [BiBr6] octahedra. Similarly, the CBM-deriving Bi 6p orbitals cannot connect 3-dimensionally because of the isolated [BiBr6] octahedra. Cs2AgBiBr6 has an indirect bandgap because of the mismatch in angular momentum of the VBM- and CBM-deriving atomic orbitals,97 and large carrier effective masses along some directions due to the 0D electronic dimensionality. Moreover, the defect calculations suggest that VBi and AgBi are the dominant defects, which, however, show deep charge-state transition levels.96 On the basis of this understanding, double perovskites such as Cs2AgBiBr6 do not exhibit promising photovoltaic properties comparable to MAPbI3. More recently, on the other hand, on the basis of DFT calculations, Savory et al. reported that replacing Ag with In or Tl can yield good photovoltaic-relevant properties.97 On the basis of our electronic dimensionality concept, the In-/Tl- and Bi-based double perovskites are electronically 3D, because In/Tl has similar contribution to the LCB and UVB, leading to a 3D connectivity of atomic orbitals. Deng et al. have synthesized (MA)2TlBiBr6,34 and confirmed the direct character of the bandgap (around 2.0 eV). However, Tl is far more toxic than Pb, and hence unsuitable for most optoelectronic applications. So far, there have been no reports on working solar cells based on these Bi-containing double perovskites.
As a lead-free and air-stable perovskite variant, Cs2SnI6 has also attracted much attention for solar cell application.16,19,28,98–102 Cs2SnI6 also crystallizes in the Fmm space group and can be regarded as a vacancy-ordered double perovskite, expressed as Cs2□SnI6 (□ indicates Sn vacancy (VSn)), where Sn atoms and vacancies adopt a rock-salt-type arrangement. Both the VBM and the CBM of Cs2SnI6 are derived from the isolated [SnI6] octahedra;100 therefore, Cs2SnI6 is electronically 0D. Because of the fairly localized VBM, Cs2SnI6 exhibits a large hole effective mass and thus a low hole mobility.19,100 In addition, the dominant defects (i.e., VI and Sni) in Cs2SnI6 exhibit deep transition levels, which may act as electron and hole trap centers, and/or nonradiative recombination centres, deteriorating the device performance.101 Currently, the solar cells based on Cs2SnI6 absorbers have achieved only ∼1% PCE.102
The electronic dimensionality can also account for the device performances of perovskites and nonperovskites listed in Fig. 1b. When the structural and electronic dimensionality decreases to 2 ≤ 3 − 1/n < 3, the absorbers become layered perovskites, such as (C6H13NH3)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1,45 (PA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1,51 and (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1.52 Although these perovskites exhibit reasonable bandgaps and optical absorption characteristics, the performances of devices based on films with randomly oriented grains are much lower than those of the 3D MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 perovskites, since the photogenerated charges cannot effectively travel across the gap between the inorganic layers because of the lower electronic dimensionality. To enhance the PCEs, these layered perovskites must be grown such that the interlayer direction within the crystallites is perpendicular to the substrate surface to facilitate charge transport and collection, which has been demonstrated by Tsai et al.85 With further decrease of the structural and electronic dimensionality, the perovskites and nonperovskites, such as Cs3Sb2I9, (MA)2Pb(SCN)2I2, (HA)2PbI4, Cs3Bi2I9, and (MA)3Bi2I9, exhibit even poorer device performances (Fig. 1b). Such poor performance cannot be explained solely by their relatively wide bandgap, because these cells show very poor open-circuit voltages, relative to the large bandgaps, indicating strong nonradiative recombination in the absorbers. The large averaged effective masses and deep defect levels caused by the low electronic dimensionalities are likely the fundamental reasons for the strong nonradiative recombination.
It should be noted that having a 3D electronic structure with appropriate band gap does not guarantee good photovoltaic properties. FASnI3, MASnI3, and CsSnI3 are all structurally and electronically 3D. They exhibit suitable bandgaps for single-junction solar cell applications, but the PCEs of solar cells based on these absorbers are rather poor as compared to MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 based solar cells. For 3D Sn-based perovskites, the facile oxidization of Sn2+ to Sn4+ causes a high density of Sn vacancies, leading to significant carrier recombination and poor device performance.7,103 The black CsPbI3 phase is also structurally and electronically 3D, but it does not produce efficient solar cells.104,105 This is likely because the black CsPbI3 is not stable because of the relatively small Cs+ ions, which lead to a too small structural tolerance factor.106
Finally, it is worth noting that extensive efforts have been made to search for promising Pb-free and air-stable halide perovskite absorbers, since the discovery of MAPbI3 for solar cell application. However, so far, no promising candidates have been reported. Replacing Pb by other cations can cause many issues that lead to undesirable photovoltaic properties. Besides the above discussed reduced electronic dimensionality, the substitution of Pb can also cause structural instabilities. A recent theoretical study based on the tolerance factor and a revised set of anion-dependent ionic radii for cations has found only a handful of cations that may be successfully placed on the Pb site to form stable iodide perovskites.62 Unfortunately, most of the resultant halide perovskites exhibit large bandgaps and effective masses, which are not suitable for photovoltaic applications.107,108 Therefore, exploring promising perovskite-based photovoltaic absorbers still remains a significant challenge.
Conclusions
We show that, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the photovoltaic properties and device performance of an absorber, the electronic dimensionality should be considered. The commonly used structural dimensionality explains the photovoltaic properties of some absorbers, but fails to account for others. This is because the structural and electronic dimensionalities are the same for some semiconductors, but different for others. We show that some double perovskites, such as the Ag- and Bi-containing halide double perovskites are structurally 3D, but electronically 0D. High electronic dimensionality is preferred for high-performance photovoltaic materials. The electronic dimensionality can account for many of the trends observed for photovoltaic properties and device performances of perovskite and nonperovskites reported in literature. Our results provide critical guidance for searching for Pb-free halide perovskite photovoltaic absorbers and for fabricating efficient devices.
Computational method
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, as implemented in the VASP code.109 The plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 300.0 eV. Γ-Centered k-meshes with k-spacing of 0.3 Å−1 were employed for sampling the Brillouin zones. The general gradient approximation (GGA) Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)110 functional was used for exchange–correlation. Prior to the electronic structure calculations, the structure was fully relaxed and considered to be converged when the total force on each atom was <0.01 eV Å−1. Total-energy defect calculations were performed for CsPbI3 and Cs2SrPbI6 using a 320-atom supercell and the Γ-only k-mesh. The atomic positions of the defect structures were relaxed until the total force on each atom was smaller than 0.05 eV Å−1. The potential-alignment, image charge and band-filling corrections were applied by the methodology described in the literature.111,112

Conceptual insights
A promising photovoltaic absorber should exhibit the following properties: high optical absorption, small carrier effective masses, and dominant defects that yield shallow levels. Structural dimensionality has been commonly used to provide one basis for desirable photovoltaic properties. Here, we introduce the concept of electronic dimensionality – the connectivity of the atomic orbitals that comprise the lower conduction band and upper valence band. We show that the electronic dimensionality accounts for photovoltaic properties much better than the structural dimensionality, with high electronic dimensionality providing the opportunity for (though not guaranteeing) high photovoltaic performance.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Experimental optical bandgaps of some iodide perovskites (diamond symbols) and nonperovskites (triangle symbols) as a function of crystal dimensionality. For the dot-center symbols, optical bandgaps were determined by excluding the exciton band at low temperature. The structural dimensionality of an n-layered perovskite is defined as 3 − 1/n. Similarly, the structural dimensionality of the compounds that comprise double-[BX6]-chains is qualitatively defined as 1.5, and that for bioctahedra-based compounds as 0.5. (b) Highest recorded power conversion efficiencies for some iodide perovskite and nonperovskite absorber materials. The red, violet, wine, blue, and olive symbols indicate Pb-, Sn-, Ge-, Bi-, Sb-based halides, respectively. “Cn” indicates CnH2n+1NH3, “C6-2” indicates C6H5(CH2)2NH3, “C1I” indicates NH2C(I)NH2, “FA” indicates HC(NH2)2, and “HA” indicates C5N3H11. The detailed data for a and b are given in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Hypothetical model crystal structures of CsPbI3, Cs2PbI4, Cs3PbI5, and Cs4PbI6. (b) Calculated band structures and (c) optical absorption coefficients of model systems CsPbI3, Cs2PbI4, Cs3PbI5, and Cs4PbI6.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Crystal structure of the n = 4 member of the hypothetical Csn+1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite family (tetragonal, space group I4/mmm). (b) Calculated bandgaps and (c) in-plane (red) and out-of-plane effective electron (the circles symbols) and hole (the diamond symbol) masses of the Csn+1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite family. The out-of-plane hole masses of these layered perovskites are almost infinite and are not shown. (d) Band structure and (e) absorption coefficient of the n = 1, 2, 4, 8 members of the Csn+1PbnI3n+1 layered perovskite family.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Schematic of Pb–I–Pb bond distortion in the ab plane of √2 × √2-cells of CsPbI3 and Cs2PbI4 perovskites. (b) Calculated bandgaps of CsPbI3 and Cs2PbI4 perovskites as a function of the in-plane Pb–I–Pb bond angle θ. (c) Calculated band structures and (d) VBM- and (e) CBM-associated charge density maps on the (001) plane for ideal undistorted (θ = 180°) and distorted (θ = 136.4°) CsPbI3 and Cs2PbI4 perovskites.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a and b) Crystal structures, (c and d) band structures, (e and f) VBM- and (g and h) CBM-associated charge density maps on the (100) plane, (i and j) calculated defect transition levels of (a, c, e, g and i) Cs2PbPbI6 and (b, d, f, h and j) Cs2SrPbI6. In figure e, d, i and j, the relative VBM and CBM positions of Cs2PbPbI6 and Cs2SrPbI6 are aligned by matching core levels.
