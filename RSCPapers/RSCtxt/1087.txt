    , Accepted 19th August 2019First published on 20th August 2019AbstractThree D–A π-conjugated copolymers PnTIF (where n = 2, 4, or 6), composed of isoindigo electron acceptor units and difluorinated bithiophene (BTF) electron donor units, were synthesized and characterized. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels, solubility (and miscibility with PCBM), crystallinity (and crystalline orientation) and PnTIF:PCBM thin film morphology (nano-fibrillar network and phase separation) of the copolymers could be adjusted by the number (0 for P2TIF, 1 for P4TIF, 2 for P6TIF) of flexible 3-dodecylthiophene spacers between the isoindigo and BTF units. From the tested polymer solar cells fabricated with PnTIF:PCBM bulk heterojunctions, P4TIF:PC61BM solar cells exhibited a remarkably high short-circuit current density of ∼22 mA cm−2 together with a fill factor of ∼61% and an open-circuit voltage >0.80 volt, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 10.7%, making it one of the highest among PC61BM-based polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, considering different options of n-type materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs), the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction binary PSCs is exceeding 11%,1,2 14%,3–7 and 10% (ref. 8 and 9) for fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM and PC71BM), non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs), and electron-deficient polymers, respectively. Bi-continuous interpenetrating networks with fine fibril-like nanostructures have been considered as the ideal morphology of BHJ to overcome the seemingly contradictive miscibility and phase separation of p-type and n-type materials and to achieve high efficiency of PSCs. Nevertheless, such ideal nano-morphology of BHJs is not easy to achieve. Based on the chemical structures of donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments of the copolymers, the common feature of these high-performance D–π–A copolymers is oligothiophene (OT) or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the donor segment. Associated with the OT unit, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT)1,2,10,11 or naphthobisthiadiazole (NTz)12–15 is the optimal choice for the acceptor segment of the copolymers. Regarding the BDT donor segment, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT),16–20 benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]-dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD),21 and 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-imide (BTI)22 are the superior choices for the acceptor units. Considering their strong electron-deficient characteristics and high degree of coplanarity, isoindigo-based copolymers have been applied for PSCs in recent years.23–35 In our previous study, we synthesized and demonstrated two isoindigo–quaterthiophene-based copolymers, i.e., P4TIH and P4TIN, for high-performance PSCs (the highest PCE is 8.36%). Although a remarkably high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ∼1.06 V was achieved for P4TIN:PC61BM PSCs, P4TIN exhibited lower crystallinity and less nano-fibrillar structure due to its non-planar conformation and a relatively large dihedral angle (∼18.6°) of 3,3′-dicyano-2,2′-bithiophene (BTCN) units.36 For further improving the performance of isoindigo–oligothiophene copolymer PSCs, we designed and synthesized a series of fluorine-substituted copolymers, P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF (Scheme 1), of which 3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene (BTF) unit is the common part of oligothiophene as the donor segment of the copolymers.37
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the PnTIF copolymers. The donor segments of PnTIF are difluoro-substituted bithiophene, quaterthiophene, and sexithiophene for P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF, respectively. 
The results presented herein indicate that P4TIF having the optimal isoindigo–oligothiophene repeating unit exhibits intermediate solubility and crystallinity to form an ideal morphology of interpenetrating networks with fine fibril-like structures in the active layer of P4TIF:PC61BM BHJ. PSCs having an active layer of ∼300 nm thickness and a high PCE reaching 10.69% was achieved. In addition to the potentials of mass production by solution processes, our devices have an edge-on fabrication cost over other high-performance PSCs, which are usually based on much more expensive fullerene derivative, such as PC71BM.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterizations of PnTIF polymers
The synthesis route of PnTIF, i.e., P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF, is illustrated in Scheme 1. Detailed synthesis procedures and structural characterizations of the reaction products can be found in ESI.† All three PnTIF copolymers were readily synthesized via a Stille cross-coupling reaction of isoindigo units (A1, A2, or A3) and a difluoro-substituted bithiophene unit (D1). P2TIF is composed of the monomer A1 (and D1), 3-dodecylthiophene and bis-(3-dodecylthiophene) attached to both flanks of an isoindigo species (i.e., A1) to generate A2 and A3, as the donor segment of P4TIF and P6TIF, respectively. Compared with those of P4TIF and P6TIF, the solubility of P2TIF is substantially lower. We have observed that P2TIF is prone to precipitation during the process of polymerization. In order to avoid the precipitation, which is adverse to the reaction yield, the synthesis reaction of P2TIF requires more solvent (almost double), i.e., reaction in a more diluted solution. However, it might cause a different degree of polymerization. The P2TIF synthesized in this study has a much higher molecular weight than that reported in the literature.31 Therefore, P2TIF synthesized in this study has significantly lower solubility than that reported in the literature.31 The low solubility is a major adverse factor of PnTIF in device fabrication.
Both P4TIF and P6TIF have a similar number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 109.6 kDa and 113.2 kDa, respectively, and a similar PDI of 1.60 and 1.56 as well, respectively (Table 1). As expected, P2TIF has a higher Mn of 156.1 kDa and a lower PDI of 1.35 compared with those of P4TIF and P6TIF.

With additional two and four n-dodecyl alkyl side chains on the flanked thiophene spacers, P4TIF and P6TIF can be readily dissolved in halogenated solvents, such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. However, lacking such n-dodecyl alkyl side chains, the solubility of P2TIF is much lower. The apparent solubility of PnTIF follows the order P6TIF > P4TIF ≫ P2TIF. The 1H NMR spectra of P6TIF show the most distinguishable peaks around the aromatic shift region compared with those of P4TIF and P2TIF, indirectly verifying the suggested order of solubility (Fig. S4–S6†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) determined the melting temperature (Tm) of P2TIF to be 388.2 °C, which is significantly higher than 295.1 °C and 251.7 °C of P4TIF and P6TIF, respectively (Fig. S7b†). In addition to the lowest solubility, the highest Tm of P2TIF is consistent with its strong tendency of aggregation in PSC fabrication.
3.2 Absorption spectroscopic properties
The absorption spectroscopic property of PnTIF copolymers in solution (CF) and thin film states was characterized using an UV-visible absorption spectrometer. The copolymer thin films were prepared by spin-coating a CF and DCB (1/1, v/v) mixed solution, which is consistent with that used in PSC fabrication. The detailed absorption data, including the wavelength of absorption maximum (λmax) in solution and thin film as well as the optical bandgap (Eoptg) values are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1, either in solution or thin film state, all PnTIF copolymers have two major absorption bands around 350–550 nm and 550–800 nm.
 Fig. 1  UV-visible absorption spectra of PnTIF: (a) CF solution at room temperature. (b) Thin-film spin-coated from CF:DCB (1:1 volume ratio) solution. 
Comparing absorption spectra in solutions and thin films, it was observed that those of high-energy absorption bands are mostly the same, while the profile of low-energy absorption bands varied a lot due to the varied extent of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics involved in different PnTIF copolymers. In the solution spectra, P2TIF exhibited the most distinct vibronic absorption components, i.e., 0–0, 0–1, and 0–2 at 706, 647, and ∼600 nm, respectively (Fig. 1a), which remain mostly unchanged in the thin film spectra, indicative of locally excited (LE) π–π* transition. On the other hand, the solution spectra of P4TIF and P6TIF have much less vibronic feature, but they are intensified in thin-film spectra. The different absorption spectra of P4TIF and P6TIF can be attributed to their more ICT characteristics and non-planar conformation, of which the stacking of polymer-chain enforces a more planar conformation in the thin film and enhances the vibronic absorption feature. Moreover, the solution absorption spectra of P2TIF are also consistent with the fact that P2TIF is the copolymer having the least non-planar conformation among PnTIF series, showing the least temperature dependence (Fig. S8†). The structural difference in PnTIF is the π-conjugation spacer, 3-dodecylthiophene, which is flexible and steric space demanding. Without any 3-dodecylthiophene in the copolymer backbone, P2TIF exhibits the most planar and rigid conformation and hence the lowest solubility. The significantly less ICT characteristics found for P2TIF than P4TIF or P6TIF may be due to the same reason, the lack of structural flexibility and steric space demanding 3-dodecylthiophene.
In addition, in the low-energy region, the thin-film absorption coefficients, of which 0–0 vibronic absorption are as high as 6.8–8.7 × 104 cm−1, indicating an efficient absorption of solar light. These spectroscopic observations indicate that each PnTIF copolymers has a difference of partial ordering (or semi-crystallinity) and oriented alignment in thin film state (see Section 3.6 for details). Moreover, by introducing varied number of 3-dodecylthiophene (as the π-conjugation spacer) between isoindigo and fluorinated bithiophene (BTF) units, the Eoptg and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of PnTIF are controllable, and the trend of VOC of PnTIF PSCs is predictable.
3.3 Electrochemical properties and density functional theory (DFT) simulation
To more understand the influence of increasing 3-dodecylthiophene spacers between isoindigo and fluorinated bithiophene (BTF) on PnTIF optoelectronic properties, cyclic voltammetry (CV, Fig. S9†) and DFT simulation were performed.
As evident by the oxidation potential from CV measurements, the addition of thiophene spacer enhanced the donor strength of difluoro-substituted oligothiophene. Accordingly, the HOMOCV energy levels of PnTIF polymers were estimated to be sequentially rising as −5.69, −5.41, and −5.26 eV for P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, a relatively high and low VOC can be expected for the P2TIF and P6TIF PSCs, respectively. Moreover, CV measurement reveals that all PnTIF show very similar reduction potentials (Fig. S9a†). Therefore, the estimated lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMOCV) energy levels of PnTIF are almost the same as −3.82 ± 0.01 eV (Table 1). Such results are consistent with a fact that the most electron-deficient moiety of PnTIF is an isoindigo unit, which is the common electron acceptor segment used in all copolymers. The HOMOCV energy level, which is related to the oligothiophenes, the donor segment of PnTIF, is the decisive factor for ECVg (the energy gap estimated by CV). ECVg was determined to be 1.87, 1.59, and 1.43 eV for P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF, respectively. Although these values are not the same as the optical energy gaps (Eoptg) estimated from the onset absorption wavelength, the trend of both ECVg and Eoptg is the same, i.e., P2TIF > P4TIF > P6TIF. The CV results shown here also provide an indirect evidence for ICT characteristics involved in the absorption band around 550–800 nm.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels from the DFT calculations (HOMODFT and LUMODFT) are summarized in Table 1. Although the values are different, the trend of HOMODFT is exactly the same as that of HOMOCV, i.e., the sequence (from top to bottom) of the HOMO energy level is P6TIF, P4TIF, and P2TIF, with 0.2–0.3 eV separation in between. Similarly to those of LUMOCV, LUMODFT varied little by 0.01–0.04 eV for PnTIF. Analyzing HOMOs and LUMOs from the electron density contour plots (Fig. S10†), the LUMO of three copolymers encompasses a rather similar segment including isoindigo π-conjugation unit and the first thiophene ring attached to it. The oligothiophene π-conjugation unit is the main area covered by HOMO of all three copolymers. However, P6TIF has a HOMO extended to the adjacent benzene ring of isoindigo. The HOMO of P4TIF extends further to include the central CC double bond of isoindigo. Very differently, the HOMO of P2TIF surrounds the whole π-conjugation from oligothiophene to isoindigo. We believe that the unique HOMO constitution of P2TIF causes its absorption spectra different (in terms of less ICT characteristics) from those of P4TIF and P6TIF.
DFT calculations also provide a useful information about the coplanarity of the π-conjugation system, which constitutes the copolymer backbone structure of PnTIF. The coplanarity of the π-conjugation system is one of the two factors influential to the solubility and the aggregation (or stacking) of copolymers in solution and in thin film state, respectively. As shown in the results (Fig. S10†), the dihedral angle of fluorinated bithiophene unit (θFF) is only 0.3–0.4 degree in all three PnTIF, enabling a very flat or coplanar conformation. However, the dihedral angles between other adjacent aromatic rings, 3-ethylthiophene and 3-fluorothiophene (θTF), 3-ethylthiophene and 3-ethylthiophene (θTT), 3-ethylthiophene and benzene ring of isoindigo (θIT), and 3-fluorothiophene and benzene ring of isoindigo (θIF) are much larger of 12.2–15.4 degree (θTF, θTT) and 20.2–22.6 degree (θIT, θIF). When the number of alkylated thiophene spacers increased, the π-conjugation copolymer backbone becomes more twisted, which increases the non-coplanarity of the copolymer and reduces the tendency of aggregation or crystallite formation of copolymers in solution and thin film state, respectively. Thus, P2TIF, without any 3-dodecylthiophene spacer, has the most rigid and coplanar conformation of the copolymer backbone, which is prone to the formation of aggregate or crystallite in the thin film state. In contrast, P6TIF will be the most difficult one forming an aggregate or a crystallite in thin film state, and the best solubility can be expected among PnTIF.
3.4 Photovoltaic characteristics
The BHJ solar cells were fabricated as inverted PSCs (device area: 0.04 cm2) with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/PEIE/copolymer:PCBM/MoO3/Ag. Ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) was applied to modify the surface and work function of ZnO layers.40Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic characteristics of various combinations of PnTIF copolymers and PCBMs with or without the solvent additive diphenyl ether (DPE) (2 vol% of the mixed solvent CF/DCB).

In our device fabrication, DPE was only adopted in the fabrication of the best PSCs of PnTIF:PC61BM or PC71BM for final optimization. The best PSCs are P2TIF:PC61BM, P4TIF:PC61BM, and P6TIF:PC71BM for each PnTIF, respectively. As shown in the results, the effect of solvent additive DPE is copolymer dependent. For P2TIF:PC61BM PSCs, DPE improves the average power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.27% to 4.52%. These values are much lower than 8.8% reported in the literature.31 However, the Mn of literature P2TIF (PiI2fT) is 91.6 kDa, which is significantly lower than 156.1 kDa of P2TIF that we synthesized in this study. The higher the molecular weight, the lower the solubility of the copolymer, hindering the preparation of PCBM-blended thin films with good nano-morphology. For P4TIF:PC61BM PSCs, DPE decreases the average PCE from 10.16% to 9.42%. For P6TIF:PC71BM PSCs, DPE decreases the average PCE from 8.35% to 7.22%. From the data listed in Table 2, the decrease or increase in PCE caused by DPE is primarily determined by the changes in the fill factor (FF) and secondarily by the short-circuit current density (JSC). The correlation between solvent additive DPE and FF is related to the morphology of PnTIF:PCBM BHJ, and the solubility and the miscibility of individual PnTIF with either PC61BM or PC71BM play an important role in the thin film morphology and hence the FF of PnTIF:PCBM PSCs. To probe the thin film morphology and to understand its correlation with the FF, the corresponding results from the measurements of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) are shown in Sections 3.5 and 3.6, respectively. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the highest PCE of 10.69% among all the devices reported here was achieved with P4TIF:PC61BM PSCs without any solvent additive. The J–V characteristics of the best PSCs based on each PnTIF copolymers are shown in Fig. 2a.

Regarding the VOC of PnTIF:PCBM PSCs, P2TIF:PCBM has a VOC of around 1.00–1.02 V, which is larger than 0.79–0.81 V of P4TIF:PCBM, and which, in turn, is larger than 0.70–0.72 V of P6TIF:PCBM. Such a VOC order is in accordance with the order of HOMO energy levels of PnTIF (see CV results in Section 3.3). Moreover, PC71BM-based PSCs always have a smaller VOC (by 0.01–0.02 V) than that of PC61BM-based PSCs. It can be reasonably ascribed to a slightly lower LUMO energy level of PC71BM than PC61BM.41
It is commonly known that a high JSC of PSC requires an efficient photo-generated exciton, an efficient exciton dissociation, a less recombination of charge carriers, and a high charge transportation (mobility). The exciton dissociation and charge recombination of polymer:fullerene BHJ are closely related to the nano-fibril network and the degree of phase separation between polymer and fullerene materials,42–44 which will be described and discussed later (see Section 3.5 TEM and AFM for details). Relevantly, the DPE solvent additive effectively worked for P2TIF:PC61BM PSCs in terms of enhancing the JSC and FF of the PSCs. However, it did not work for P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM PSCs mainly due to the significant decrease in FF, which is related to the phase separation between PnTIF and PCBM and the optimal width of the nano-fibril. The corresponding discussion can also be found in Section 3.5 (AFM and TEM results).
Considering the absorption coefficient of PnTIF copolymer thin films (Fig. 1b), the long-wavelength light harvesting of P2TIF is better than that of P4TIF and P6TIF. However, the absorption spectra of PnTIF:PCBM blended thin films exhibited a weaker spectral intensity of P2TIF:PC61BM than those of P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM (Fig. 2c). This can be mainly attributed to the thinner P2TIF:PC61BM thin film (∼160 nm) compared with that (>300 nm) of P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM. In addition to a reason of thickness of the thin film, the observed much higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2b) over the whole range of 400–800 nm of P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM than P2TIF:PC61BM may be ascribed to the extended nano-fibrillar network and the high face-on alignment ratio of P4TIF and P6TIF (see Results and discussion of Sections 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7). Particularly, a very high EQE greater than 90% (Fig. 2b) or exceptional high thin film absorption intensity (Fig. 2c) around 450–580 nm was found for P6TIF:PC71BM. In addition to a reason of thick active layer (∼365 nm), these can be explained by a relatively higher absorption coefficient of P6TIF around 475 nm (Fig. 1b) as well as the absorption contribution of PC71BM in a range of 450–580 nm.45 As many cases of PSCs having PC71BM, PC71BM actually provides a photocurrent output of the solar cell due to its light absorption band of 450–580 nm. In the present study, the solubility of PnTIF in the processing solvent system is crucial to the thickness of PnTIF:PCBM BHJ. From other experimental evidences shown in this study, we have demonstrated the solubility of PnTIF to be P6TIF > P4TIF ≫ P2TIF, which is in accordance with the active layer thickness of the best device of each PnTIF. However, there is a clear trade-off between FF and JSC in increasing the thickness of the BHJ, taking P4TIF:PC61BM as an example. As shown in Table 3, when the thickness of the P4TIF:PC61BM active layer increases from 120 nm to 300 nm, the FF reduced from 64.81 to 60.82%, whereas JSC increases from 13.48 to 21.97 mA cm−2. However, when the thickness is over 300 nm, both JSC and FF decrease. P4TIF works better with such a thick active layer, which can be attributed to its favourable morphology (fine nano-fibrillar network) and high face-on crystalline orientation characteristics (see the discussion in Sections 3.5 and 3.6). Both factors sustain the elevation of JSC in the thickness range of 120–300 nm. The optimal thickness of PnTIF:PCBM PSCs requires a fine-tuning, which has been achieved via the regulation of PnTIF:PCBM solution concentration. However, the solution concentration is very much limited to the solubility of PnTIF, of which P2TIF shows the lowest solubility and the thickness of the P2TIF:PC61BM active layer can hardly reach over 160 nm.

As the results show, the highest JSC of either P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM PSCs is over 21 mA cm−2, which is a very high value among literature-reported polymer:PC61BM or PC71BM-based BHJ PSCs. In summary, an extended nano-fibrillar network, a high face-on alignment ratio of the copolymer, and a thick active layer (>300 nm) of the BHJ are three good reasons for such high JSC.
3.5 TEM and AFM morphology characterizations of PnTIF:PCBM
The morphologies of the PnTIF:PCBM blend films can be probed by TEM (Fig. 3). The bright and dark regions in bright-field TEM images represent copolymer and fullerene domains, respectively. Ideally, interpenetrating network structure with bi-continuous fine phase separation is the most favorable morphology for large area contacts of electron donor and electron acceptor materials as well as effective charge transport channels (or less charge recombination).
 Fig. 3  TEM images of different PnTIF:PCBM thin films with or without 2% DPE. All scale bars are equivalent to a length of 100 nm (×40000). The scale bars of three inserted figures are 0.5 μm in length (×10000). 
As shown in Fig. 3 (those without 2% DPE), all PnTIF copolymers form an interpenetrating network morphology with fibril-like nanostructures. However, the network structure of P2TIF is not quite the same as those of P4TIF and P6TIF. Compared with the fibril width of P2TIF, relatively finer nano-fibrils of P4TIF and P6TIF can be clearly seen in Fig. 3. We attribute such difference mainly due to the solubility of PnTIF copolymers and hence their miscibility with PCBM.43 In addition to a much thinner active layer in PSC, the poor solubility of P2TIF causes the formation of aggregate (nano-fibril) readily in the blended thin film, resulting in thick nano-fibrils in a less intertangling network structure. Estimated from our TEM images, P4TIF and P6TIF have a nano-fibril width of ≤10 nm. This width fits quite well to a typical exciton diffusion length of π-conjugated polymers,46 enabling efficient exciton dissociation and reducing exciton radiative recombination.42 Besides, the finer nano-fibrils increase the area of the contact interface of PnTIF and PCBM, which facilitates the photocurrent generation. The poor solubility of P2TIF is also manifested in the TEM images of a copolymer neat film. The P2TIF neat film exhibits a thick and extended nano-fibrillar structure, which is not observed for P4TIF or P6TIF (Fig. 4). Similarly, the nano-fibrillar structure was found thicker and more extended for P2TIF than P4TIF or P6TIF neat films in AFM images (Fig. 4). One intriguing result of PnTIF:PCBM PSCs is the influence on PCE by using solvent additive DPE. The changes in TEM images due to the inclusion of DPE in PnTIF:PCBM blended thin films is quite relevant to the changes in PCE. As shown in Section 3.4, in enhancing PCE, the solvent additive DPE only works for P2TIF:PC61BM and does not work for either P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM. Two crucial changes are revealed by the TEM images of the PnTIF:PCBM blended thin films with the inclusion of DPE. First, the width or the thickness of nano-fibril was reduced more significantly for P2TIF:PCBM than that for P4TIF:PCBM or P6TIF:PCBM. Second, phase separation between PnTIF-enriched and PCBM-enriched substances (bright and dark area in TEM images) was found to be more for P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM than P2TIF:PC61BM. We suggest that solvent additive DPE interferes the strong aggregate tendency (to form nano-fibril) of P2TIF, whereas the interference is less significant due to the less tendency of aggregate (because of better solubility) of P4TIF or P6TIF. Moreover, in the presence of DPE, a bundle of nano-fibril is more mobile for P4TIF or P6TIF than that for P2TIF because of less structural rigidity of the former two copolymers. Therefore, with 2% DPE, the TEM images exhibit more phase separation (assembly of nano-fibril bundles) for P4TIF:PC61BM or P6TIF:PC71BM than P2TIF:PC61BM (the inserted figures in Fig. 3 or their full-scale pictures in Fig. S11†). In fact, the observation of surface morphology from AFM (Fig. S12†) is consistent with TEM results. With the solvent additive DPE in the process of thin film preparation, a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the AFM image decreases for P2TIF:PC61BM but increases for both P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM, evident for the increase in phase separation.
 Fig. 4  (Top row) TEM images of PnTIF copolymer neat films. The scale bars are 200 nm (×20000). (Bottom row) AFM images of PnTIF copolymer neat films. The scale bars are 1.0 μm. 
Another unusual result from PnTIF:PCBM PSCs is that PC71BM outperforms PC61BM but for P6TIF only. We can attribute such unusual result to the miscibility difference between PnTIF and PCBM, which is very much related to the structural flexibility and hence the solubility of PnTIF (in either DCB or DPE).34,35 From TEM images (Fig. 3), the width of nano-fibril is apparently lager for P2TIF:PC71BM and P4TIF:PC71BM than that for P2TIF:PC61BM and P4TIF:PC61BM. In contrast, the width of nano-fibril of P6TIF:PC71BM is not much different from that of P6TIF:PC61BM. As we have demonstrated already that the solubility of P6TIF is the best among PnTIF, the good solubility makes a similar miscibility of P6TIF to PC71BM or PC61BM. Since such variation in nano-fibrillar width is in parallel with the variation of FF (Table 2), we infer that the best soluble PnTIF, P6TIF, has a best miscibility with PC71BM and only P6TIF PSC can have an increased FF when switching PCBM from PC61BM to PC71BM.

 Fig. 5  2D-GIWAXS patterns of P2TIF:PC61BM without (a) and with (a1) 2% DPE, P4TIF:PC61BM without (b) and with (b1) 2% DPE, and P6TIF:PC71BM without (c) and with (c1) 2% DPE. The GIWAXS profiles of (d) out-of-plane direction (area integration χ = 0–45°), (e) in-plane direction (area integration χ = 45–90°), (f) azimuthal angle scans extracted from the lamellar (100) diffraction of PnTIF:PCBM blend films, (g) azimuthal angle scans extracted from the lamellar (100) diffraction of PnTIF neat films. 

Fig. 5d and e exhibit the GIWAXS profiles of out-of-plane direction (integrated from the azimuthal scan range χ = 0–45°) and in-plane direction (integrated from the azimuthal scan range χ = 45–90°) from the 2D diffraction patterns, respectively. The (h00) diffraction signals are usually ascribed to the lamellar polymer side chain packing, and the (0k0) diffraction signal is corresponding to the π–π (face-to-face) stacking of the polymer backbone,47 corresponding to a d-spacing of 22.3–27.6 Å (d(100)) and 3.55–3.62 Å (d(010)), respectively.
Clearly shown in Fig. 5d, P2TIF:PC61BM exhibits a significantly higher intensity of (100) diffraction and a significantly shorter lamellar d-spacing than those of P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM, indicating a larger crystalline domain and a dense crystallite lamellar packing. The good crystallinic nature of P2TIF in lamellar packing is also evident from its (200) diffraction, which is more distinguishable than that of P4TIF or P6TIF. Moreover, P6TIF:PC71BM exhibits a stronger (010) diffraction than the other two, indicating a larger crystallinic domain of P6TIF in the π–π stacking. Accordingly, the crystallinity nature of P4TIF is in between that of P2TIF and P6TIF. In fact, the size of the PnTIF:PCBM crystallite can be more quantitatively analyzed through the crystallite correlation length (CCL) by the Scherrer equation.48 The prominent (100) diffraction peaks enable a reliable estimation of CCL(100) values and they are 85.4 Å, 67.3 Å, and 54.1 Å for P2TIF:PC61BM, P4TIF:PC61BM, and P6TIF:PC71BM, respectively. The size of a crystallite (lamellar packing structure) from large to small is in an order of P2TIF > P4TIF > P6TIF. In fact, such an order is exactly reverse to the order of PnTIF solubility, which in turn is parallel with the number of flexible and non-planar 3-dodecylthiophene spacers in the copolymer main-chain. When DPE solvent additive is included in the thin film preparation, all CCL(100) and hence the size of crystalline domain get smaller, 71.5 Å, 65.7 Å, and 50.1 Å for P2TIF:PC61BM, P4TIF:PC61BM, and P6TIF:PC71BM, respectively (Table 4).
The difference in the chain-orientation of each PnTIF mixed with PCBM can be clearly seen in the azimuthal angle (χ) scans of the lamellar (100) diffraction (Fig. 5f). The face-on ratio(100) can be estimated by calculating the area ratio of the χ between 45° and 90° to that between 0° and 45°.49 Otherwise, the area integral ratio of χ ranges between 45° and 90° (Axy) and 0° and 35° (Az), i.e., Axy/Az, corresponds to the fractions of face-on and edge-on crystallites.12,13 The face-on ratio(100) or Axy/Az observed are 43.5%, 47.8%, and 28.0% or 0.77, 0.91 and 0.39 for P4TIF:PC61BM, P6TIF:PC71BM, and P2TIF:PC61BM without solvent additive DPE, respectively (Table 4). First, except for P2TIF:PC61BM, these values are all higher than those (polymers for the thin film transistor or polymers for PSCs with thick BHJ) reported in the literature.12,13,49 Second, our GIWAXS-measured face-on ratio(100) or Axy/Az of PnTIF neat films (i.e., thin films without PCBM) is particularly high, 67.3% or 2.05, for P6TIF but it is particularly low, 16.8% or 0.20, for P2TIF (see Table 4, Fig. 5g and S13†). Such results indicate that PnTIF have a different preference of copolymer chain-orientation, particularly, a face-on and an edge-on alignment for P6TIF and P2TIF, respectively. From a chemical structure perspective, such GIWAXS results also imply that more the 3-dodecylthiophene spacers put in the copolymer main-chain, the more the face-on orientation can be expected for PnTIF. Finally, it is interesting to find that the face-on ratio(100) or Axy/Az gets increased for P2TIF:PC61BM when solvent additive DPE is included in the process of thin film preparation (see Table 4 and Fig. 5f). In contrast, the face-on ratio(100) or Axy/Az is actually decreased for P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM. Importantly, such a difference in chain orientation is in parallel to the changes in PCE, i.e., increased PCE for P2TIF:PC61BM but decreased PCE for both P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM when DPE is included in device fabrication. In addition to the increase in light-harvesting, face-on oriented copolymers will be more favourable in charge transport and the output photocurrent of PSCs.
3.7 SCLC and TFT characterization of hole mobility
The space-charge-limited current (SCLC)-determined hole mobilities (μh,SCLC) of PnTIF neat films from high to low follows the order P6TIF (4.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P4TIF (3.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) > P2TIF (1.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Fig. S14 and Table S1†). Such order of μh,SCLC is in fact reverse to that of CCL(100) (crystallinity of the lamella stacking of copolymer), but it is parallel to the order of face-on ratio(100) or Axy/Az of PnTIF neat films estimated by GIWAXS (Table 4). Therefore, we may logically suggest that the face-on orientation of the copolymer chain plays a more important role than the size of the crystallite of lamellar stacking structure in the SCLC measurement. The face-on ratio(100) of PnTIF, P6TIF ≫ P4TIF > P2TIF (Fig. 5g and S13†), still influences the hole mobility determined by the thin film transistor (TFT) method, where the hole mobility is measured in a direction parallel to the substrate surface, the octadecylsilane-modified Si-wafer, different from that of SCLC measurement. From the GIWAXS measurement of PnTIF neat films on octadecylsilane-modified Si-wafer (Fig. 6), except for P6TIF, PnTIF all have a predominant edge-on orientation. There are still some minor face-on orientations or in-plane (100) diffraction signals for P6TIF (Fig. 6c and e), consistent with its strong preference of face-on orientation.
 Fig. 6  2D-GIWAXS patterns of PnTIF copolymer neat films after thermal annealing: (a) P2TIF; (b) P4TIF; (c) P6TIF; the GIWAXS profiles of (d) out-of-plane direction (area integration χ = 0–45°) and (e) in-plane direction (area integration χ = 45–90°). 
In addition, with thermal annealing treatment on PnTIF thin films, the CCL(100) of the PnTIF neat films all increased significantly from 127 to 204 Å, from 67.5 to 304 Å, and from 54 to 127 Å for P2TIF, P4TIF, and P6TIF, respectively (Table 4). Such CCL(100) results are very much in accordance with the thermal heating susceptibility in terms of the lamellar packing structure of PnTIF. With thermal heating, P2TIF has a moderate migration (and hence limited increase in CCL(100)) due to its rigid structure of the copolymer backbone; P6TIF is too flexible and its conformation (of 3-dodecylthiophene spacer) disorder limits the increase in CCL(100). Moreover, P6TIF has the highest face-on orientation, which is adverse to the TFT hole mobility. Therefore, with thermal heating, P4TIF has the largest increase in CCL(100), and a TFT hole mobility (μh,TFT) of 0.40 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than 0.25 and 0.18 cm2 V−1 s−1 of P2TIF and P6TIF, respectively (Fig. S15 and Table S1†). Both hole mobility measurements of SCLC and TFT indirectly verified the preference of the face-on orientation of P4TIF and P6TIF in the PCBM blended film, which was observed in the GIWAXS measurement.
4. Conclusions
In summary, HOMO energy level engineering and the fine-tuning of solubility as well as crystallinity and the copolymer-chain orientation of PnTIF copolymers was realized by introducing flexible, non-planar, electron-rich 3-dodecylthiophene spacers along with the copolymer main-chains. Although it increases the HOMO energy level and hence decreases the VOC value of PSCs, the 3-dodecylthiophene spacers could enhance the solubility and miscibility (with PCBM) in the thin film of PnTIF:PCBM. First, PSCs with a thick active layer (≥300 nm) were fabricated with P4TIF or P6TIF mainly due to the satisfactory solubility. Second, carefully examined by TEM and AFM, P4TIF or P6TIF formed favorable thin film morphologies with PC61BM or PC71BM in a fine nano-fibrillar network structure, resulting in a much higher JSC and FF of P4TIF and P6TIF PSCs compared with those of P2TIF. Moreover, GIWAXS measurement verified the high face-on chain orientation (>40%) found for the thin film of P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM, facilitating the light harvesting of the PSCs. P4TIF:PC61BM and P6TIF:PC71BM PSCs show high JSC over 21 mA cm−2 and EQE as high as >90%. With optimal trade-off between VOC and JSC as well as FF, P4TIF:PC61BM PSCs achieved the highest PCE of 10.69%, which was one of the best devices among the thick (≥300 nm), single-junction, fullerene-based PSCs. Therefore, in the present study, we have successfully demonstrated that the isoindigo unit can be an effective option for the structural design of acceptor units in addition to TT, BDD, BT, and NTz.
