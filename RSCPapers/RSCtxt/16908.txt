    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 29th October 2015AbstractEfficient absorption of visible light and a long-lived excited state lifetime of silver nanoclusters (Ag29 NCs) are integral properties for these new clusters to serve as light-harvesting materials. Upon optical excitation, electron injection at Ag29 NC/methyl viologen (MV2+) interfaces is very efficient and ultrafast. Interestingly, our femto- and nanosecond time-resolved results demonstrate clearly that both dynamic and static electron transfer mechanisms are involved in photoluminescence quenching of Ag29 NCs.
The pursuit of new light-absorbing candidates for solar cell applications is a topic that has garnered intensive efforts by materials scientists. A relatively new class of nanomaterials called metal nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged as the missing link between atomic and nanoparticle behavior in metals.1,2 These are atomically precise nanoparticles, less than 2 nm in size, which consist of a distinct number of metal atoms protected by organic ligands.3 In this size regime, metals behave like molecules, whereby their energy levels discretize and increase in spacing.4–7 NCs are well documented for their wide applications as fluorescent probes for ion detection,8,9 biosensing10,11 and gas sensing,12 and specifically for the ultrafast electron transfer (ET) in pyrene-functionalized gold (Au25) NCs.13 Furthermore, Au NCs have recently been reported as photosensitizers in mesoscopic TiO2-based solar cells.14 This specific example highlighted the importance of the photoactivity of thiolated metal clusters for high-power conversion efficiency. While Ag NCs have been explored for their ET and sensitization potential, they have received far less attention than Au NCs, despite their obvious advantages: low cost, strong photoluminescence (PL), demonstrable stability, and uniquely ultra-scalable synthesis in high-yield and molecular purity.15–17 PL in metal NCs is thought to originate from either the metal core18 or from interactions between the metal core and surface ligand.2,19,20 To date, only a few examples of Ag NCs with a short lifetime have shown photoinduced-electron-transfer (PET) properties.21–24 However, little progress has been made towards uncovering PET reaction mechanisms in the nanocluster community; more efforts are needed to better understand the excited-state interactions and the subsequent development of applications for NCs, especially in energy conversions. As part of the regime, methyl viologen (MV2+), an organic dication, is a highly attractive choice for investigating donor–acceptor properties because of its strong electron accepting character and a wide range of applications including solar energy conversion.25–27 The stability of its radical cation (MV+˙) and the ease of its spectroscopic detection makes MV2+ a favorable choice in applications explaining the fundamentals of PET.25,28,29
In this work, we investigate the excited-state interactions between Ag29 NCs and MV2+ using steady-state and state-of-the-art femtosecond laser spectroscopy with broadband capabilities. Our results indicate an efficient quenching of Ag NC fluorescence in the presence of MV2+. Synthesis and characterization of the Ag29 NCs are detailed in the ESI.† In addition, single crystals of these clusters have been recently reported.30 Stern–Volmer plots confirmed a combination of dynamic and static mechanisms (see Scheme 1). This mixed interaction mechanism was further supported by time-resolved femto- and nanosecond transient absorption (fs-TA and ns-TA) and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements. Additionally, the ultrafast ET from the NCs to the MV2+ was indicated by the formation of the MV+˙ within 120 fs.
 Scheme 1  Static and diffusion-controlled mechanisms of PET from Ag29 NCs to MV2+. 

Fig. 1 presents the steady-state absorption and emission spectra of Ag29 NCs with and without MV2+ in deaerated acetonitrile (CH3CN). In the absence of MV2+, the absorption spectrum of NCs shows three absorption bands at 320, 445 and 510 nm. However, upon MV2+ addition, the spectrum features a slight increase in absorption and a long tail over the range of 500–700 nm, providing clear evidence for the ground-state interaction between the two components.
 Fig. 1  Steady-state absorption (A) and emission (B) spectra of a deaerated CH3CN solution of Ag29 NCs (3 mg mL−1) in the presence and absence of MV2+. Inset is a Stern–Volmer plot with the static (v) and dynamic (KSV) quenching rate constant as obtained from straight line. 
Photoexcitation of the Ag29 NC shows an intense emission spectrum centered at 660 nm, while efficient quenching became evident upon the addition of MV2+; a maximum quenching of ∼99% is observed with ∼21.8 μM MV2+ added. The absorption spectra of two different concentrations of MV2+ = 4 and 21.8 μM are given in Fig. 1 for comparison. The lower concentration is equal to the highest concentration used to induce maximum quenching during NC luminescence and the other is about 8-fold higher; however, neither showed any spectral overlap with Ag29 NC emission, ruling out a photo-induced energy transfer process from NCs to MV2+. Moreover, association of the cluster can also be ruled out based on the control experiment performed using three different concentrations of NCs, where the quenching behavior in the presence of MV2+ proved to be the same, see Fig. S8.† Therefore, we can confidently assign this strong quenching to a PET from Ag29 NCs to MV2+. Several reports have evidenced fluorescence quenching of Ag NCs upon interactions with electron acceptors.22,23,31 Here, we analyzed PL quenching data using the Stern–Volmer equation, (F0/F) = 1 + Ksv[MV2+], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of MV2+, respectively; Ksv is the quenching constant; and [MV2+] is the concentration of MV2+. The upward curve observed on the Stern–Volmer plots indicates a combined effect from both diffusion-controlled and static mechanisms in the excited-state deactivation.32 Quenching data were further analyzed using an extended Stern–Volmer equation: , where both static (v) and dynamic (KDSV) quenching constants are considered.33,34 The data show a straight line with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 with estimated dynamic and static quenching constants of 2.49 × 104 M−1 and 4.26 × 104 M−1, respectively. Time-resolved spectroscopy further confirmed a mixed mechanism of luminescence quenching behavior (see below).
Time-resolved TA spectroscopy has proven to be a critical part of studying excited-state interactions,35–40 specifically for probing energy and electron transfer processes in NCs.13,21,41 Here, we explore the lifetime and light-harvesting capability of Ag29 NCs using fs- and ns-TA spectroscopy in CH3CN in the presence and absence of MV2+; the TA spectra are given in Fig. 2 and 3. The experimental setup for TA measurement is described in the ESI† and further details can be found elsewhere.42
 Fig. 2  ns-TA of Ag29 NCs in deaerated CH3CN after laser excitation at 350 nm (A) and kinetic traces of ESA monitored at 485 nm (B). 
 Fig. 3  fs-TA of Ag29 NCs in deaerated CH3CN after 350 nm laser excitation: (A) free, in the presence of MV2+, (B) 1.36 × 10 −5 M, and (C) 2.72 × 10−5 M; delay time is given on the graph. 
The ns-TA spectra (Fig. 2A) show the excited-state absorption (ESA) with a maximum at 405 nm. We observed another band with several features extending over the range of 485–850 nm together with the ground-state bleach (GSB) at 445 nm. Fig. 2B shows the ESA decay, monitored at 485 nm, where the extracted lifetime of Ag29 NCs is estimated to be 335 ± 30 ns. In contrast, data from previous studies for smaller NCs reported much shorter lifetimes than what we report here.21,41 To extend our understanding of the excited-state interactions between Ag29 NCs and MV2+, we performed fs-TA in the presence and absence of two different concentrations of MV2+, after laser excitation at 350 nm (see Fig. 3).
The TA spectra of Ag29 NCs alone showed less than 10% decrease in ESA and GSB recovery over a time frame of 5.5 ns, which agrees with the long lifetime extracted from the ns-TA decay. Dynamics of the excited state show a faster decay with added MV2+ that speeds up with increasing concentration. Moreover, a new spectral band developed and became more feasible at higher concentrations of MV2+ and with the increased delay time at 605 nm. This new band lies within the spectral range reported in the literature for radical ion of MV+˙.25,43 The formation of the MV+˙ provides clear evidence for the PET from NC to MV2+. Fig. 4A and B illustrate the kinetic traces of NCs with and without MV2+.
 Fig. 4  Kinetic traces in deaerated CH3CN after laser excitation at 350 nm of Ag29 NCs in the presence (green) and absence (violet) of MV2+ collected from (A) fs-TA monitored at 485 nm (ESA) and 445 nm (GSB), (B) ns-TA monitored at 485 nm (ESA), and (C) TCSPC after laser excitation at 485 nm and monitored at λem = 650 nm. Fitted lines are given in blue and time constants are given. 
In the presence of MV2+, the radical ion forms ultrafast within 120 fs (the temporal resolution of our instrument, see Fig. S1† for pulse characterization), followed by decay due to a charge recombination (CR) with a time constant of 41 ± 5 ps, evidenced by the ESA and GSB behavior. This rapid dynamic provides more experimental evidence of a close connection between NCs and MV2+, and indicates that PET processes occur between them. More specifically, the formation of radical ions, immediately after pulse excitation, indicates that the electron transfer process from NCs and MV2+ is static in nature.
However, it is clear from the kinetic trace that while the fast decay component was about 40%, another long component represents ∼60% of the decay (see green and yellow curves in Fig. 4A), which is longer than the 2.5 ns time window. While the fast component was estimated at ∼41 ps and assigned to CR as discussed above, the long component can be attributed to diffusion electron transfer and the lifetime of unreacted NCs. To further explain the kinetics at a longer time scale, we measured the excited-state deactivation using both ns-TA and TSCPC for Ag29 NCs in the presence and absence of MV2+; Fig. 4B and C show the kinetic traces. The kinetic decays clearly show a decrease in the excited-state lifetime of the cluster in the presence of MV2+. Such a change in the lifetime of the NCs with added MV2+ is indicative of the dynamic nature of the interaction that is involved in the electron transfer process. The rate of the PET was estimated from the excited-state deactivation at ≈5–6 × 107 s−1. This rate is lower than the diffusion limit of MV2+ (≈ 1010 M−1 s−1), confirming the diffusion nature of the electron transfer.44,45Fig. 4B and C illustrate the existence of a long component in the decay curves at about 67%, demonstrating a lifetime of NCs that does not undergo electron transfer.
From the measurements discussed above, we found that the formation of a radical cation within 120 fs proves electron transfer with a static nature with a PET rate anticipated at ≥8.3 × 1012 s−1. This rate is about two orders of magnitude faster than what has recently been reported for a closely related nanocluster system.22 The rate for the diffusion controlled mechanism, as calculated from the change in lifetimes, is indicated by ns-TA and TCSPC measurements at ∼5–6 × 107 s−1. Based on this information, we have estimated the efficiency of PET to be ∼95% in good agreement with the estimated value from steady-state measurements. Here, we present the detailed reaction mechanisms by which both static and freely diffusing MV2+ molecules accept electrons from the newly synthesized Ag29 clusters as a model system such that they can be applied to other nanoclusters and molecular acceptors. More importantly, we quantitatively separated the contributions of static and collision-caused photo-induced electron transfer from that of the clusters to MV2+ through both transient absorption (TA) and time-resolved fluorescence (TCSPC experiments). Note that the interaction was also proven to be solid-state active. We performed the fs-TA experiments for a spin-coated film of Ag29 NCs on glass in the presence and absence of MV2+ (see Fig. S9†). In the presence of MV2+, a fast deactivation of the excited-state and characteristic bands for MV+˙ were observed, providing clear evidence of the PET in solid-state as well. These bands were detected right after excitation (within 120 fs), supporting the static nature of the interaction.
Conclusions
Here, we present the light-harvesting capability of Ag29 NCs using both femto- and nanosecond time-resolved laser spectroscopy. We found that these new clusters can serve as an absorber layer in UV-Vis regions with very long excited-state lifetimes. They show rapid and efficient electron injection to the molecular acceptor MV2+. Perhaps more importantly, a combination of femto- and nanosecond time-resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy reveals the involvement of two mechanisms by which MV2+ induces the decay of the excited state of Ag29 NCs through static and diffusion-controlled electron transfer.
