    , Accepted 21st December 2011First published on 11th January 2012AbstractLow cost, non-dendritic magnesium metal is an ideal anode for a post lithium ion battery. Currently, development of magnesium electrolytes governs the rate of progress in this field, because electrolyte properties determine the class of cathodes utilized. A review of the latest progress in the area of magnesium battery electrolyte and a perspective on mitigating present challenges is presented herein. Firstly, density functional theory has been shown to predict the potential window of magnesium electrolytes on inert electrodes. Secondly, we report initial efforts aimed to overcome the corrosive property of these magnesium organohaloaluminates towards less noble metals such as stainless steel. This is a major challenge in developing high voltage magnesium electrolytes essential for batteries which operate above 3V. We lastly touch on cathode candidates including the insertion and conversion classes. One conversion cathode we pay particular attention to is electrophilic sulfur which can be married with magnesium metal anodes by utilizing non-nucleophilic electrolytes obtained by simple crystallization of in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminates. Effectively, non-nucleophilic electrolytes open the door to research on magnesium/sulfur batteries.John MuldoonDr Muldoon received his B.Sc (Hons) in chemistry from Queens University of Belfast.

Broader context
Recently, lithium ion batteries have been used to power hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles (EV). In order for EVs to be competitive in driving range and cost to vehicles powered by combustion engines, a dramatic improvement is required in the energy density of lithium ion batteries. Without a doubt, the Holy Grail in battery research is the development of post lithium ion batteries. This may require shifting from alloys to pure metal anodes and from insertion to conversion cathodes such as sulfur or air. Magnesium's thermodynamic properties make this metal an obvious candidate as an anode. In this perspective we report the recent progress in the area of magnesium batteries and discuss how the properties of an electrolyte are crucial in determining a viable cathode.

1. Introduction
The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that the energy consumed globally in 2008 was estimated at 1.4 PWh and is expected to rise by 40% within the next 25 years.1 Energy input from cosmic radiation drives most activity on earth and is naturally stored as a variety of carbon reserves which are non-renewable over the time scale of their exploitation. EIA worldwide energy statistic for 2008 reports the proven total reserve of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is capable of generating 12.2 PWh. As a consequence, the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels as the main global energy source will require diversification into alternative, green energy sources, such as direct solar, hydroelectric, thermal, and wind energy capture. This shift will require the advent of novel, high energy storage technologies able to compensate the intermittent characteristics of alternative energy and provide power on demand or on schedules similar to those provided by current electric grids.2,3 As a result, Toyota considers global sustainability and minimizing industrial and automotive pollution a top priority. With this objective in mind, Toyota introduced the first generation Prius Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) in Japan in 1997. Since then it has continued to improve the hybrid system and has applied it to other vehicles. Currently, Toyota sells 17 hybrid models including a 3rd generation Prius and has achieved 3.1 million HEV sales worldwide. This approach has reduced CO2 emissions by 19 million tons as of March, 2011.4 In addition, Toyota has demonstrated a Plug-in Hybrid EV (PHEV) based on a third generation Toyota Prius (model ZVW30) outfitted with 5.2 kWh lithium-ion batteries, with an all-electric range of 23 km. In order to develop EVs with a range and cost competitive to those of conventional combustion engines, development of higher energy batteries will be required; therefore research of post Li ion technologies is paramount. Post Li ion batteries (PLiB) can be defined as those batteries with a theoretical energy density higher than that of a Li ion battery containing a carbon anode and a lithium cobalt oxide cathode (2000 Whl−1).
Without a doubt, the Holy Grail in battery research is the development of PLiB which may require shifting from alloys to pure metal anodes. Li metal anode is a superior candidate because of high volumetric capacity (2062 mAh cm−3) and very negative reduction potential (−3.04V vs.NHE). Despite recent renewed enthusiasm towards Li metal anodes, pioneering work in this area dates back nearly 100 years (1912) and was carried out by G.N Lewis. Previous attempts at commercializing a rechargeable battery containing a Li metal anode have been dissuaded by the inherent instability of Li metal, especially during charging. Unfortunately, batteries containing Li metal anodes suffer from thermal runaway, which is characterized by temperatures quickly rising above the melting point of metallic Li.5,6 This inherent safety issue can be related to dendrite formation on the Li metal anode which short-circuits the battery.7 In an effort to mitigate this intrinsic instability of batteries containing a Li metal anode, research shifted towards lithiated graphites and alloy-based anodes containing Si and Sn.3,8–14 Consequently, one of the major challenges in the commercialization of PLiBs containing a Li metal anode will be the suppression of dendritic growth; this is not a trivial task.7
In contrast to Li metal, magnesium (Mg) metal anodes are not plagued by dendritic formation.15,16 Additionally, Mg is safer than Li when exposed to air, more abundant in the earth crust (currently 24 times cheaper then Li), and provides a larger volumetric capacity of 3832 mAh cm−3. On the other hand, Mg has a reduction potential of −2.356V vs.NHE, which is 700 mV less negative than Li and has a unique electrochemistry which prohibits its reversible deposition in aprotic solvents containing currently commercial ionic salts such as magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)-imide or magnesium perchlorate. Reduction of these electrolytes results in the formation of an electronically blocking surface layer which does not conduct magnesium ions and inhibits deposition.17,18 However, efficient Mg deposition in ethereal solutions of Grignard reagents dates back to 1925 and has been regularly reported on ever since.19–28 Furthermore, Mg has also been successfully deposited from magnesium organohaloaluminates popularized by Aurbach et al. which have far superior coulombic efficiencies, voltage stabilities and current densities to solutions of Grignard reagents. These organohaloaluminates are generated in situ from the reaction between an organomagnesium compound (Lewis base) and a Lewis acid.29–34 The voltage stability and coulombic efficiency of the magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes are highly dependant upon the chemical structure and ratio of both the Lewis acid and Lewis base.30
The first rechargeable batteries with Mg metal anodes were demonstrated in 2000. These Mg batteries showed impressive cycle life (>3500 cycle measured), low capacity fading over prolonged cycling, negligible self-discharge and a wide operating temperature range. These batteries were considered only as replacements for nickel-cadmium or lead-acid batteries because the high formula weight and low voltage of Chevrel phase MgxMo3S4insertion cathodes lowered their overall energy density.30,35NuLiet al. has reported the feasibility of higher voltage mesoporous magnesium manganese silicate cathodes and thus improved the overall energy density of rechargeable batteries containing Mg metal anodes.36,37 Nevertheless, a fundamental challenge of magnesium intercalation is the difficulty of two electron transfer during Mg2+ insertion in inorganic hosts. This is due to a strong polarization of the small, divalent Mg2+ ion when compared to similarly sized, but monovalent Li+ ion.38
On the other hand, magnesium batteries will benefit from the use of conversion cathodes which inherently possess higher theoretical volumetric capacities than insertion cathodes and do not rely on intercalation of Mg2+. One such ideal cathode is electrophilic sulfur, which has a high theoretical volumetric capacity of 3459 mAh cm−3 and is of great interest when coupled with a Mg metal anode.2 This coupling can only occur in non-nucleophilic electrolytes. The theoretical volumetric energy density of a Mg/S battery exceeds 4500 Whl−1, which is approximately twice that of a Li ion battery composed of a graphite anode and a cobalt oxide cathode. A more attractive cathode is air. Mg/air batteries have a theoretical voltage of 2.93Vvs.Mg with a volumetric energy density of 14046 Whl−1.39,40 The high energy density can be explained by oxygen being an unlimited cathode and the capacity of the battery only being limited by the volume of the Mg metal anode. However, none of the existing magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes are moisture/air stable and therefore are not compatible with an air cathode.
This critical perspective will overview key historical events leading to the advent of rechargeable magnesium batteries as well as report the current state of the art and a brief synopsis of our recent progress in the area of magnesium electrolytes. It will incorporate the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in an effort to guide synthetic routes for new electrolytes with higher voltage stabilities and without the shortcomings of magnesium organohaloaluminates previously observed, including their nucleophilicity and their reactivity with electrodes. The electroactive species of these magnesium electrolytes and the important role of the anion on their performance will also be presented. In addition, we will briefly discuss some of the major hurdles which must be overcome in the development of a metal anode battery coupled with sulfur or an air cathode.
2. Magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes: history and state of the art
It has been a vital task to develop a magnesium battery electrolyte which overcomes the low anionic stability of Grignard reagents. For example, ethylmagnesium bromide and butylmagnesium chloride have a voltage stability of 1.5Vvs.Mg, therefore limiting the choice of available cathodes.41 Initially, Gregory et al. synthesized an electrolyte (Mg[B(C4H9)4]2) from the reaction between dibutylmagnesium and the Lewis acid tri-n-butylborane which showed improved anionic stability over Grignard reagents, but a lower coulombic efficiency.42 Based on his work, it was assumed that the character of the Lewis acid could be the determining factor in improving the voltage stability and that transmetalation was a key step in the formation of the electrochemically active product.32,34 Derived from this premise, Aurbach et al. investigated how different combinations/ratios of organomagnesium compounds (R2Mg) to Lewis acids affected the coulombic efficiency and oxidative stability of electrolytes. Shockingly, he observed no magnesium deposition from tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions of dialkylmagnesium Lewis bases in combination with a wide variety of Lewis acids (BPh2Cl, BPhCl2, B[(CH3)2N]3, BEt3, BBr3, BF3, SbCl3, SbCl5, PPh3, PEt2Cl, AsPh3, FeCl3, and TeF3).30 However, the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate with a given formula of Mg(AlCl2BuEt)2 formed from the reaction of one equivalent of dibutylmagnesium and two equivalents of ethylaluminum chloride resulted in an electrolyte with an electrochemical stability of 2.4V and 100% coulombic efficiency.34,43 In an attempt to analyze the structure of this electrolyte, single crystals were precipitated from a THF solution by addition of hexane. Surprisingly, the crystal (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(EtAlCl3) obtained was not reported electrochemically active when dissolved in THF.30,32,44
The main limitation of this first generation magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolyte was the electrochemical instability attributed to the relatively weak Al–C bond which breaks viaβ-H elimination.45 The electrochemical stability window was improved by substituting alkyl groups on the Lewis acid with phenyl groups, therefore excluding β-H elimination as a possible oxidation route. In effect, the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate called APC formed from the reaction of one equivalent of AlCl3 with two equivalents of PhMgCl displayed a much improved electrochemically stable window of 3.3Vvs.Mg on a Pt working electrode. Additionally this electrolyte possesses a specific conductivity of 2 × 10−3 Ω−1 cm−1 and a coulombic efficiency of 100%. NMR and Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that the solution consists of a mixture of Mg complexes including MgCl2, MgCl, Mg2Cl3+, Ph2Mg and PhMgCl all of which are coordinated by THF.34 The overall nucleophilic nature of this magnesium organohaloaluminate can be explained by the nucleophilicity of Mg complexes such as PhMgCl and Ph2Mg present in the electrolyte mixture. Unfortunately, the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminates reported so far, while having high coulombic efficiencies, are nucleophilic, and air sensitive and therefore preclude their use with electrophilic cathodes such as sulfur or oxygen. For example, a 2:1 mixture of PhMgCl and AlCl3 in THF has been shown incompatible with an electrophilic sulfur cathode. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed that this electrolyte directly reacts with sulfur to form phenyl disulfide and biphenyl sulfide.46
Our approach to solving the mismatch between electrohilic sulfur and nucleophilic magnesium organohaloaluminates was to focus on using non-nucleophilic Hauser bases as electrolytes. As such, potassium hexamethyldisilazide is a non-nucleophilic base so the corresponding Hauser base (hexamethyldisilazide magnesium chloride) (HMDSMgCl) was a good starting point for synthesizing a Mg/S battery electrolyte. HMDSMgCl has been previously reported as capable of undergoing reversible magnesium deposition with a similar current density to that of Grignard reagents.41 Following the previous work of Aurbach et al., the current density for the magnesium deposition was increased by a factor of seven upon addition of AlCl3. Unfortunately, the voltage stability did not improve and was equal to that of HMDSMgCl. In order to examine the product of the reaction between HMDSMgCl and AlCl3, crystals were obtained by slow diffusion of hexane. The crystal (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDSAlCl3) was identified by single X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1A).

The cation consisted of two octahedrally coordinated Mg centers, bridged by three chlorine atoms. The three remaining sites on each Mg center are coordinated through the oxygen by THF solvent. The anion is composed of an Al atom tetrahedrally coordinated by one HMDS group and three chlorides. This crystal is electrochemically active and its crystallization improved both the voltage stability and coulombic efficiency when compared to the in situ generated electrolyte formed from the reaction of a 3:1 mixture of HMDSMgCl and AlCl3. Bulk analysis of crystalline electrolyte 1 by NMR and mass spectrometry confirms the major product is (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDSAlCl3) and the minor product is (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDS2AlCl2).46 Electrolyte 1 can be stored up to one year in a glove box without any loss in electrochemical performance (Fig. 2).

Inset shows 100% coulombic efficiency for deposition-dissolution of Mg. 
Electrochemical activity of crystallized electrolyte 1 prompted the investigation of crystallized products obtained from in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminates previously reported by Aurbach et al.31 For example, contradictory to these reports, (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(EtAlCl3) obtained from the reaction of n-butylmagnesium and ethylaluminum chloride was, in fact, electrochemically active.46 Similarly, the electrochemical activity of the reaction product between a 2:1 ratio of PhMgCl and AlCl3 was also confirmed. Crystallization of this in situ generated electrolyte has the general formula (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(PhnAlCl4-n) (n = 1–4) 2. Its major product was confirmed by single X-ray diffraction as (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(Ph2AlCl2) (Fig. 1B).47
The cation (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)+ is consistently present in all of the electrochemically active, crystallized magnesium organohaloaluminates, which suggests it is the electrochemically active species generated from the reaction between an organomagnesium compound and a Lewis acid (Fig. 3). However, the equilibrium between the magnesium cations (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)+ and MgCl2/MgCl+ cannot be discounted and the assumption that the (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)+ cation is solely responsible for magnesium deposition cannot be made with confidence. Scheme 1 shows the proposed steps in the formation of 1.46 The initial reaction involves the transmetalation of HMDS group to yield the HMDSAlCl3− anion [Eq. (1)]. One credible scenario to account for the formation of the cation (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)+ is MgCl+ rapidly reacting with MgCl2 [Eq. (3)]. MgCl2 is present from the Schlenk equilibrium [Eq. (2)], and its depletion drives the equilibrium to the right. A proposed pathway to account for the minor product (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDS2AlCl2) involves further reaction of HMDSMgCl with the HMDSAlCl3− anion [Eq. (5)].

Blue line depicts (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(PhnAlCl4-n) (n = 1–4), green line (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(EtAlCl3) and red line (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(HMDSnAlCl4-n) (n = 1,2). Experiments are conducted on a Pt electrode with 0.02 cm2 surface area, at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1, 21 °C with a Mg reference and counter electrode. 

Crystallization results in non-nucleophilic magnesium organohaloaluminates by removing the nucleophilic components of the in situ generated electrolyte. For example, crystallization of the magnesium organohaloaluminate generated from the reaction of a 2:1 ratio of PhMgCl and AlCl3 removes the nucleophilic PhMgCl and Ph2Mg components which are the reason for this electrolyte's reactivity with elemental sulfur. In effect, the formation of biphenyl sulfide and phenyl disulfide observed in the in situ generated organomagnesium electrolyte is not detected in the reaction of crystallized product 2 with elemental sulfur. Similarly, NMR studies clearly demonstrate that electrolyte 1 has no reactivity with sulfur. No change is observed in the33S NMR spectrum of elemental sulfur in the presence of these crystallized electrolytes even after one week.46 In conclusion, crystallized magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes are non-nucleophilic whereas in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes are nucleophilic and incompatible with electrophilic cathodes such as sulfur.
All magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes synthesized thus far have the same cation (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)+ therefore their dissimilar stabilities are governed by their unique anions. We believed that DFT may aid in the screening of electrolyte candidates by modeling their oxidative and reductive stability.48 The oxidative stability of an electrolyte governs the choice of a cathode. The oxidative stability can be estimated from the calculated Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) energy as the oxidation reaction involves removal of an electron from this orbital. The more negative the HOMO energy the higher the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. Similarly, the reductive stability of the electrolyte is extremely important. A low reductive stability of the anion or the solvent may result in the formation of an electronically insulating surface layer which does not conduct magnesium ions. The reductive stability can be estimated from the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) energy, as reduction involves the addition of an electron to this orbital. In this case, the more positive the LUMO energy the higher the reductive stability of the electrolyte.
Since electrolytes contain ions, DFT modeling must also take into account the influence of solvents. Hocking et al., has examined the effect of a dielectric model (COSMO) on DFT-calculated structures of organometallic complexes. It was found that gas-phase DFT calculations do not correctly reproduce experimental trends unless solvation corrections were included.49 Recently, Aurbach examined the oxidative stability of the components of the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolyte obtained from PhMgCl and AlCl3 through DFT calculations, using the IEFPCM model to include solvent influences.34 Calculations used to predict the oxidative stability of electrolyte candidates used anion geometry optimizations performed at the B3LYP/6-311+g-dp level in THF (ε = 7.58) solution, viaCOSMO. Table 1 summarizes the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for a number of magnesium electrolytes. However, the structural flexibility of (HMDS)2AlCl2− makes its geometry difficult to optimize. It is important to note that when an electrolyte is a mixture of components the oxidative stability of the electrolyte is governed by the species with the most positive HOMO energy. Therefore, in the case of 2 where the general formula is ( 2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(PhnAlCl4-n) (n = 1–4), the oxidative stability is determined by AlPh4− anion and in the case of 1 it is determined by the HMDS2AlCl2− anion. Based on this logic, our DFT calculations predict the electrolyte order of oxidative stability to be 4 > 2 > 3 > 1.This is based on the assumption that the HOMO energy level gap between the (HMDS)AlCl3− and (HMDS)2AlCl2− anions is similar to the energy gap between PhAlCl3− and Ph2AlCl2− anions.

In order to investigate whether theoretical calculations predict the experimental results accurately, we synthesized additional model electrolytes (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)(BPh4) 3 and (Mg2(μ-Cl)3·6THF)[B(C6F5)3Ph] 4. Treatment of triphenylboron with 3 equivalents of PhMgCl yields 3. The structure of 3 was confirmed by single X-ray diffraction (Fig. 4).50 In an analogous reaction, 4 can be synthesized by simply replacing triphenylboron with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, B(C6F5)3 as the Lewis acid. It is important to mitigate the reactivity of B(C6F5)3 with THF. Both electrolytes can be readily crystallized from hexane. Evaluation of magnesium electrolytes was conducted on a Pt working electrode. Electrolytes 1, 2, 3 and 4 have oxidative stabilities of 3.2V, 3.3V, 2.6V, and 3.7Vvs.Mg, respectively (Fig. 5). In order to understand the true benefits of DFT calculations in evaluating the properties of electrolytes it is crucial to perform these calculations on a larger population of synthesized electrolytes. Based on the small sample size presented, we believe DFT could be a valuable tool. While the oxidative stability of the electrolytes can be determined on an inert working electrode, the reactivity of these electrolytes with components of a coin cell should also be evaluated.

        et al. has noticed a dependence of the oxidative stability of Grignard reagents on the type of working electrode.51 Pellion Technologies similarly reported the oxidative stability of in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolyte depends on the metal electrode used.52 Furthermore, Aurbach et al. has also reported that in situ generated APC electrolyte contains the Grignard reagent PhMgCl so it was plausible to infer that this Grignard reagent was the culprit for corrosion of metals by the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes reported in the Pellion patent. As previously stated crystallization results in the removal of byproducts and yields a pure magnesium organohaloaluminate. Therefore, the oxidative stability of a crystallized electrolyte with various working electrodes was investigated. Fig. 6 shows the oxidative stability of 1 on several working electrodes. Most notably, the voltage stability is 2.2V vs.Mg on a stainless steel working electrode. It is worth noting that 2 behaves similarly to 1 (not plotted). This experiment complements reports by NuLi and Pellion and shows that even crystallized magnesium organohaloaluminates are corrosive in nature.

Two electrochemical signals indicative of metal corrosion are current density hysteresis53,54 during cyclic oxidative stability tests as well as a decrease in oxidative stability on less noble working electrodes. Thus, the oxidative stability of 1 differs from an inert to a less noble working electrode as displayed in Fig. 6. Faradaic currents at positive potentials due to oxidation of metal electrodes should not be confused with faradaic currents corresponding to oxidation of electrolyte on inert electrodes. SEM images of a stainless steel working electrode at potentials above 2.2V vs.Mg confirm corrosion by display of pits (Fig. 7). Pits are also observed in electrolyte 2 above 2.2V vs.Mg. Therefore, corrosion of metals by magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes limits charging in a coin cell battery configuration to under 2.2V due to the utilization of less noble metals such as stainless steel and nickel in the casing and current collector material.

The synthesis of a new generation of high performance magnesium electrolytes without the limitation of metal corrosion is paramount if coin cells are to be operated above 2.2V. A reasonable cause for the corrosion observed in current magnesium organohaloaluminates is the presence of halides in the cation and anion components of the electrolyte. This effect is currently under scrutiny. Preliminary results demonstrate that the anion has a dramatic effect. For example, the magnesium organoborate electrolyte 3 with a halogen free anion BPh4− exhibits the same oxidative stability (2.6Vvs.Mg) on both stainless steel and Pt electrodes. In addition, cyclic voltammograms of 3 do not exhibit hysteresis on stainless steel (Fig. 8A). Electrolyte 3 shows a 400 mV improvement over 1 and 2 on stainless steel. In order to enhance the oxidative stability of 3 we considered using the fluorinated Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. As previously noted, the reaction of B(C6F5)3 with PhMgCl results in the formation of 4 which has an oxidative stability of 3.7Vvs.Mg on Pt. This is denoted by a linear scan voltammogram between OCV and 4.5Vvs.Mg (Fig. 8B). Unfortunately, when the voltage is scanned back to OCV, 4 exhibits hysteresis and establishes a stability of 2.2Vvs.Mg on a stainless steel working electrode. In the search for a non-reacting electrode material, glassy carbon has been found inert to magnesium organohaloaluminates and is ideal for high voltage oxidative stability tests (Pt working electrodes still suffer from a lower level of pitting corrosion at high positive potentials). Nonetheless, Pt working electrodes are better suited for coulombic efficiency characterization due to an apparent limitation of glassy carbon electrodes to intermediate efficiencies of Mg deposition/dissolution. When properly used, Pt and glassy carbon electrodes ensure that electrochemical experiments characterize redox events pertaining solely to the magnesium electrolyte and eliminate reactions between the electrolyte and electrodes. In conclusion, DFT calculations may be used to predict the oxidative stability of electrolytes on inert electrodes but cannot predict their performance on less noble electrodes due to the unaccounted phenomenon of corrosion. For example, magnesium electrolyte performance on stainless steel must be evaluated experimentally. Ongoing efforts to improve the voltage stability on a stainless steel working electrode will be reported in the future, including investigations on the effects of the cation.

Clockwise arrows designate passivation while counterclockwise arrows denote hysteresis. Scan rate is 25 mV s−1 and the counter and reference electrodes are both magnesium. 
3. Conversion cathodes for a magnesium battery
The observed corrosion of metals in magnesium electrolytes currently renders the high voltage insertion cathode strategy difficult to implement due to desired high operating voltages in excess of 3.0Vvs.Mg in a coin cell configuration due to the presence of stainless steel components. Presently, magnesium electrolytes 1,2 and 4 are limited to 2.2Vvs.Mg while magnesium electrolyte 3 extends the operating potential by 400 mV. It is important to consider that the operating voltage of a magnesium battery may be around 100 mV lower than the voltage stability of the electrolyte observed in a three electrode cell. The development of noncorrosive high voltage electrolytes for evaluating high voltage insertion cathodes in a coin cell is crucial. However, low voltage but high capacity conversion cathodes are currently the best choice for a magnesium battery. Two attractive conversion cathodes for PLiB are sulfur and air. The concept of utilizing sulfur as a positive electrode with a Li metal anode was introduced in the 1960's.55 An often disregarded challenge associated with using a Li metal anode is dendrite formation due to uneven deposition during charging which may result in shortage of the battery followed by thermal runway. Therefore, a Mg/S battery is a potentially interesting candidate for PLiB because it circumvents this challenge. Unfortunately, the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate electrolytes reported so far, while having high coulombic efficiencies are nucleophilic and therefore preclude the use of electrophilic sulfur. For example, the overall nucleophilic nature of the in situ generated magnesium organohaloaluminate APC can be explained by the nucleophilicity of Mg complexes such as PhMgCl and Ph2Mg present in the electrolyte mixture. Crystallization of APC results in a non-nucleophilic electrolyte 2 by removal of the nucleophilic components. In effect, the formation of biphenyl sulfide and phenyl disulfide observed in APC is not detected in the reaction of crystallized product 2 with elemental sulfur. Similarly, NMR studies of the reactivity of 1 with sulfur clearly demonstrate that the electrolyte is indeed non-nucleophilic. In fact all crystallized magnesium organohaloaluminates and magnesium organoborates are non-nucleophilic and therefore chemically compatible with electrophilic sulfur.
When a coin cell is charged above the experimentally determined corrosion onset potential, it is possible to confuse corrosion with recharging of the battery. In effect, use of battery cells accommodating carbon cloth or carbon paper as current collectors is suggested for magnesium batteries due to their inertness towards magnesium electrolytes. Therefore, it is crucial to confirm the desired charge/discharge chemistry at the cathode through chemical analysis such as X-ray diffraction or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). One of the most direct methods of confirming this chemistry in a Mg/S battery is XPS because it can determine the change in the oxidation state of the sulfur cathode. Fig. 9 compares high-resolution (HRES) S 2p spectra obtained from sulfur cathodes (as-prepared, after a first discharge, and after a complete discharge/charge cycle), to standard samples of S and magnesium sulfide (MgS) powder. After discharging, the majority of the sulfur (S 2p3/2 = 164.0 eV) is reduced to magnesium sulfide (MgS, 2p3/2 = 160.9 eV) and magnesium polysulfides ((MgSx, 1 < x < 8, S 2p3/2 = 162.0–163.0 eV). Upon charging, the majority of the MgS is oxidized to S via polysulfide intermediates therefore the desired chemistry is observed.46

(b) HRES S 2p spectra of the cathode as-prepared (I), after first discharge (II) and after first charge (III) are compared with standard samples of S powder (top) and MgS powder (bottom). Note that the S 2p peaks contain both a 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit splitting state. The 2p3/2 states, located at lower binding energies, were used for chemical state identification and are emphasized with filled symbols.

While there are numerous scientific and technical challenges which must be overcome, the major obstacle in the development of a Mg/S battery is capacity fade on repeating charge/discharge cycles which require dramatic improvements in the sulfur cathode. It is thus important to mitigate the solubility of sulfur and polysulfide anions in the electrolyte. Furthermore, during cycling, polysulfide anions can migrate to the magnesium anode where they are reduced to magnesium sulfide, causing capacity loss. Notable progress in diminishing capacity fade of a Li/S battery has been widely reported and discussed this year in comprehensive reviews to which the reader is referred to for details.5,56,57 One of the most promising approaches was recently reported by Nazar et al. where a dramatic improvement by the use of a nanostructured, polymer modified, mesoporous carbon-sulfur composites was displayed.58 Entrapment of the sulfur in a carbon cage in combination with a polymer coating substantially retards the polysulfide diffusion therefore improving life time. Recently, Tarascon et al. have demonstrated improvements in life time using mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MOF) as a host material for sulfur impregnation.59 Progress in Mg/S battery research can dramatically benefit from the advancements in Li/S battery. As a next step to reduce the Mg/S battery capacity fade we are investigating both the combination of the nano modified mesoporous carbon and MOF sulfur composites with new electrolytes. Unfortunately, battery solvents most commonly used to mitigate this problem in Li/S batteries, such as carbonates, are reduced on Mg metal and form a passivating, electronically blocking, solid electrolyte interface which prevents Mg deposition.60 Therefore, we are considering other ether containing solvents including diglyme,44 ionic liquids29,61 and block copolymer gel electrolytes62–64 as a replacement for THF with hopes of mitigating the solubility of polysulfides in THF. The first step in this process is confirming the compatibility of these new electrolytes with the Mg anode in order to verify that reversible magnesium deposition/dissolution is allowed to occur. The marrying of carbon-sulfur composites with magnesium electrolytes is actively being investigated. In principle, a conversion cathode even more exciting than sulfur is air. Notable progress in the development of a Li/air battery has been widely reported and discussed in recent comprehensive reviews.5,57,65,66 Similar to the challenges of Li/air, the discovery of an electrolcatalyst67 used to reduce the overpotential for the discharge–charge cycles and an air stable non-volatile electrolyte are necessary for a Mg/air battery.
4. Conclusion
One of the great successes in recent years has been the development and commercialization of lithium ion batteries for portable electronics, power tools, and electric vehicles. Without a doubt, the Holy Grail in battery research is the development of high energy post lithium ion batteries. This may require shifting from alloys to pure metal anodes and from insertion to conversion cathodes such as sulfur or air. Magnesium's thermodynamic properties make this metal an obvious candidate as an anode. The major advantage of magnesium metal is the lack of dendrite formation during charging while its major disadvantage is a more positive reduction potential than lithium metal. As highlighted in this perspective the main challenge of developing a high energy rechargeable magnesium battery is rooted in material discovery. The investigation of magnesium batteries presents rich opportunities for research and collaboration between chemists and electrochemists. This fundamental research will enable identifying and overcoming hurdles in developing magnesium batteries. Future emphasis in this field should fall on the development of novel electrolytes because their properties govern the choice of cathodes. Furthermore, magnesium batteries necessitate progress in both conversion and insertion cathodes. While major progress has already been made the road is still long and many rewards are waiting for those willing to travel it.

Broader context
Recently, lithium ion batteries have been used to power hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles (EV). In order for EVs to be competitive in driving range and cost to vehicles powered by combustion engines, a dramatic improvement is required in the energy density of lithium ion batteries. Without a doubt, the Holy Grail in battery research is the development of post lithium ion batteries. This may require shifting from alloys to pure metal anodes and from insertion to conversion cathodes such as sulfur or air. Magnesium's thermodynamic properties make this metal an obvious candidate as an anode. In this perspective we report the recent progress in the area of magnesium batteries and discuss how the properties of an electrolyte are crucial in determining a viable cathode.

XPS analysis of sulfur cathode. (a) Discharge and charge of a Mg/S coin cell at 50 and 25 μA, respectively. XPS spectra were taken from coin cells at various stages of cycling. (b) HRES S 2p spectra of the cathode as-prepared (I), after first discharge (II) and after first charge (III) are compared with standard samples of S powder (top) and MgS powder (bottom). Note that the S 2p peaks contain both a 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 spin–orbit splitting state. The 2p3/2 states, located at lower binding energies, were used for chemical state identification and are emphasized with filled symbols.
