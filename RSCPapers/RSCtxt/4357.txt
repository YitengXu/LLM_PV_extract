    , Accepted 9th January 2020First published on 10th January 2020AbstractLi+ doping is a well-known, simple, yet efficient strategy to optimize the properties of upconverting materials. Nonetheless, the position of Li+ in the lattice and the mechanism of upconversion enhancement are still controversial, especially in Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Y2O3. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the above issues (i.e. the position occupied by Li+ in the lattice and the mechanism of luminescence enhancement, in terms of decreased defects) by studying (Y0.78−XYb0.20Er0.02LiX)2O3 powders. Neutron powder diffraction was employed for the first time in the literature to show that Li+ ions are accommodated in Y sites of YO6 octahedra, confirmed also by the content of oxygen defects, which was increased with the increase of Li+ concentration. FT-IR showed that there was a small change in the amount and the type of the surface-absorbed groups with the increase in the Li+ content, thus not supporting the prevailing conclusion that the quenching groups are decreased by doping Li+. Positron annihilation lifetime (PLAS) experiments showed that the total defect concentration and the large defect clusters, which are considered as quenching centers, are decreased with increasing Li+-content, resulting in the enhancement of the emission intensity in Yb3+/Er3+ co-doped Y2O3.
Introduction
Upconverting materials doped with trivalent lanthanides (denoted as Ln3+) have remarkable and fascinating optical properties, such as large anti-Stokes shift, sharp emission peak, low auto-fluorescence background signal, long luminescence decay time, excellent photo-stability against photo-bleaching, and continuous emission capability (i.e. no photo-blinking); consequently, they have attracted great attention over the past few years.1–5 These unique features make upconverting materials ideal for use in a variety of emerging and potential applications, such as high-resolution bio-imaging, super-resolution nanoscopy, photodynamic therapy, light-triggered drug delivery, remote photo-activation, anti-counterfeiting, full-color displays, and solar energy harvesting.2,4,6–10 Nevertheless, the luminescence intensity and conversion efficiency of Ln3+-doped upconverting materials are too low to meet the growing demand for further developments in emerging applications, which need efficient light-emitting materials. Therefore, there has been an increasing effort to enhance the intensity of upconversion luminescence in the last few years, which is vital to developing potential novel fields. Moreover, the achievement of this goal will hopefully contribute to improving the understanding of the mechanism of upconversion luminescence enhancement.
Upconversion emission intensity from lanthanide-doped materials is influenced by various factors, such as particle size, shape, crystal structure, the type of solvent molecules, the choice of surface ligands, the relative Ln3+ concentration, temperature, and pressure.11–18 Great progress has been made in enhancing the emission intensity with the rapid development of synthesis technology, such as chemical modification methods, and the efficient use of external stimulus conditions over the past few years.11,13,19–23 For instance, core–shell upconverting architectures were designed to suppress the surface-related quenching effect and the deleterious cross-relaxation process by epitaxial growth of homogeneous or heterogeneous shells.3 Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) caused by loading metallic nanoparticles on upconverting nanoparticles results in an increase of emission efficiency.19 Furthermore, tailoring the local crystal structure around Ln3+ ions can regulate the intensity and color through doping non-equivalent ions, such as Li+ and Mn2+.24,25 Besides chemical modification, manipulation of an external stimulus (such as excitation energy, magnetic field, temperature, etc.) can modulate upconversion luminescence dynamically.26 It should be noted that in most reported cases, the enhancement of emission intensity was simply achieved by doping Li+ in Ln3+-doped fluorides and oxides.
The host matrix of Y2O3 co-doped with Yb3+, Er3+, and Li+ has been well studied because the oxide hosts generally have higher chemical and thermal stability in many practical applications, compared to fluorides.27 However, although some promising results were recorded, there is still a lively debate (or even confusion) related to the position of Li+ in the lattice and the enhancement mechanism. Apparently, due to its small radius, Li+ can easily diffuse in the host lattice, occupying the interstitial or substitutional sites. According to the literature, the determination of the position of Li+ is only based on the main X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern peak shift. Hence, some suggest that lithium enters the Y3+ sites, while others suggest that Li+ first substitutes for Y3+ and then enters the interstitial sites.25,28,29 The reason for this big difference is that the small shift of diffraction angles strongly depends on the measurement conditions, including the particle size of the powders and the flatness of the powders after pressing. Unfortunately, it is impossible to distinguish lithium from other elements easily because the X-ray scattering ability is negligible for lithium or lithium ions. Accordingly, the precise position of Li+ needs to be experimentally determined by a more reliable characterization method, such as neutron diffraction (because the coherent scattering length of the lithium nucleus is relatively large).30–32
As far as the enhancement mechanism is concerned, various conclusions are also reported in the literature, which can be roughly divided into three categories. More specifically, it is widely accepted that Li+ changes the local crystal field symmetry around the emitting Ln3+, and relaxes the parity-forbidding character of the intra-4f transitions, which enhances the emission intensity.25,28 On the other hand, due to the low melting temperature of Li precursors, the temperature of phase formation is lowered, which improves the crystallinity and increases the size of the particles.33,34 In addition, Li+-doping may reduce the non-radiative transitions by decreasing the number of surface-related quenching centers, such as OH− and CO32−. Yet, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the OH− and CO32− groups adsorbed on the surface of samples.29,35,36
This paper presents a study on determining the position of Li+ in the lattice of Y2O3 co-doped with Yb3+, Er3+, and Li+, and the upconversion emission enhancement mechanism. More specifically, four samples with a Li+-doping of 0, 6, 12, and 18 mol% were prepared and their emission intensity was measured. With the aid of neutron diffraction and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), the occupation of Li+ ions in the Y-sites in the YO6 octahedra was shown. Using positron annihilation lifetime (PLAS) experiments, we obtained information about the defects, including their size, type, and relative concentration. We shed light on the influence of lithium ions on the increase of oxygen defects, and on the decrease of the relative content of large defect clusters and of the total defect concentration. The relationship between the reduction in total defects plus the reduction of non-radiative transitions and the increase of upconverting intensity is also discussed.
Experimental
Sample synthesis
Li+-doped (Y0.78Yb0.20Er0.02)2O3 powders were synthesized via the Pechini method.37 First, appropriate amounts of the above precursors of Y, Yb, and Er were completely dissolved in de-ionized water. Then, citric acid and EDTA were added to the above solutions in a molar ratio of 0.7 and 1, respectively, with respect to the metal ions. The pH of the above solutions was adjusted to 6.0–7.0 by the addition of ammonia. Then, the precursor was heated until it was self-ignited inside the crucible. The formed gels were calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in air (the heating and the cooling rates were 4 K min−1). This procedure was followed to prepare the four investigated polycrystalline powders which had the general formula (Y0.78−XYb0.20Er0.02LiX)2O3 where X = 0.00, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.18 (denoted as Li0, Li6, Li12 and Li18, respectively), by merely changing the relative concentration of Li+ and Y3+. As we shall discuss in Section 3.2, two simplified model samples with the composition of (Y1−XLiX)2O3 (where X = 0.06 and 0.12), were similarly prepared, as well.
Material characterization
The crystalline structure of the produced powders was investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Rigaku TTR-III, Japan; Cu Kα radiation as λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range of 10 to 70°. The morphology of the powders was observed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8220). High resolution HAADF-STEM images were obtained with a JEOL ARM 200F and a JEM 2100 F with a probe corrector operating at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250) spectra of the samples were collected and analyzed using the adventitious C 1s peak with a fixed value of 284.5 eV. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, PerkinElmer) was employed to measure the actual Li+ concentration in the samples. Fourier-transformed infrared resonance (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in transmission mode on Nicolet 8700 FT-IR equipment. The upconversion photoluminescence spectra of the samples were measured under excitation at 980 nm, produced by a near-infrared source, with the same pump power (100 mW), on a JY Fluorolog-3-Tou spectrometer. Positron annihilation lifetime (PLAS) experiments were carried out in a fast-slow coincidence ORTEC system with a time resolution of about 230 ps full width at half-maximum. Neutron diffraction experiments were conducted at room temperature using a neutron powder diffractometer at the Institute of Nuclear Physics and Chemistry, P. R. China. The measured diffraction patterns of X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction were refined by Rietveld analysis using GSAS software.
Results and discussion
Characterization of the produced powders
The X-ray diffractograms of the four produced powders, presented in Fig. 1a, are a good match to the standard X-ray powder diffraction patterns of Y2O3, plotted at the bottom of the diagram. There is no evidence of secondary impurity phases, except in the case of the high Li-content sample (18 mol%, Li18), where small peaks (marked with an asterisk) of an unknown phase were recorded. Thus, hereafter we shall mainly discuss the samples with the single phase structure, Li0, Li6, and Li12, (unless stated otherwise). According to Scherrer's equation (Fig. S1, ESI†), the crystal diameter in Li0, Li6, and Li12 was calculated to be 19.6, 38.3, and 49.2 nm, respectively. In these samples, the increase in Li-content causes a shift of the main diffraction peak owing to the (222) plane at ∼29° towards higher angles (Fig. 1b), suggesting (according to Scherrer equation) a lattice shrinkage. This might be evidence of substitution of Li+ for Y3+ in the cubic Y2O3 host lattice, on account of the smaller ionic radius of Li+ (0.76 Å) compared to that of Y3+ with a coordination number of 6 (0.9 Å).38 In order to throw light on this hypothesis, neutron diffraction had to be employed.

Meanwhile, since there was evidence of active participation of Li-ions in Y-site substitution, the actual content of Li in the investigated powers was precisely determined (with the aid of ICP-AES). The results for the samples Li0, Li6, and Li12 are presented in Table 1. It is clearly seen that the actual Li+ concentration is lower than the designed value. This can be attributed to the volatilization of lithium at the high temperatures employed during the synthesis process.

However, Li-content had a negligible influence on the morphology of the as-prepared powders, which were mainly composed of agglomerated particles (Fig. 2a–c). The typical HAADF-STEM images from the Li12 sample (Fig. 2d and Fig. S2 from ESI†), recorded with an electron beam along the [111] zone axis, suggest that the spacing of the lattice was about 0.185–0.187 nm, which is consistent with the (40) crystalline planes of Y2O3. The fast Fourier transform spots (inset of Fig. 2d) suggest the existence of (40), (2), and (4) facets in the [111] zone axis, which is consistent with the results recorded with the electron beam along the [111] zone axis in Y2O3, presented (by crystal maker) in a supercell (Fig. S3 in the ESI†).

Analysis of the lithium position
Due to the fact that the ionic radius of lithium ions is smaller than that of yttrium ions, it is possible for Li+ to enter an interstitial site (denoted as Liinterstice) or occupy the lattice position (denoted as Lilattice) in Y2O3. The X-ray scattering intensity of atoms is proportional to the atomic number Z. Moreover, the scattering ability of lithium nucleus (i.e. the amplitude of coherent scattering length) is relatively large and independent of the scattering vector Q = 4πsinθ/λ. Hence, neutron diffraction is perfectly suitable for determining the position of light elements in the lattice.30 In addition, Yb and Er have no effect on the sites occupied by lithium ions. Consequently, the following analysis was conducted by using the Yb- and Er-free simplified model compositions (Y1−XLiX)2O3, with X = 0.06 and 0.12, also denoted as Li6 and Li12, respectively.
The Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction patterns measured at room temperature for the samples Li6 and Li12 is presented in Fig. 3. In order to identify the Li+ distribution inside the Y2O3 lattice, two models (Lilattice and Liinterstice) were considered. In the Lilattice model, as there are two Y sites (24d and 8a) in the asymmetric part of the unit cell, and the model of the crystal structure considers Li ions in these positions. The Li/Y occupations were refined based on the assumption that the sum of occupancies occ(Y) + occ(Li) = 1. In the Liinterstice model, since the oxygen octahedral sites are occupied by Y ions, it is assumed that Li ions can enter only tetrahedral sites. As shown in Fig. 3, the refinement quality of Lilattice is more satisfactory and gives lower R factors compared to Liinterstice (Li6 in Lilattice model Rwp = 7.93%, Rp = 6.80%; Li6 in Liinterstice model Rwp = 11.82%, Rp = 9.28%; Li12 in Lilattice model Rwp = 7.36%, Rp = 6.28%; and Li12 in Liinterstice model Rwp = 10.26%, Rp = 8.00%). Accodingly, Li ions should occupy Y sites, which causes a decrease in the lattice parameter.39 The refinement results of the LiLattice model are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI† for Li6 and L12, respectively.

Rietveld analysis cast light on the influence of Li+ content on the cell parameter (Table 2). In the resultant profile (Fig. S4 in the ESI†), the values of the R-factor (Rp) were far smaller than 10%. It is clearly seen that the lattice parameter is reduced with the increase of Li+ content. This result agrees fairly well with the peak shift in Fig. 1b and the results of neutron diffraction analysis.

The replacement of Y by Li leads to a negative value of the charge of the unit cell, therefore there will be O defects. Analyses with XPS shed light on the infuence of the Li-content on the existence of oxygen defects. The O 1s spectra and their deconvolution are shown in Fig. 4. Two peaks with a binding energy at about 529.1 and 531.6 eV, were recorded, which are ascribed to the lattice oxygen species (O2−), and to the less electron-rich oxygen species, rspectively.40–43 The deconvolution of the broad peak at higher binding energy reveals three components, (i) at ∼530.6 eV, which corresponds to absorbed oxygen species (O22−/O−),43 (ii) at ∼531.6 eV, due to hydroxyl species (–OH) or the surface-adsorbed oxygen (O2).44,45 and (iii) at the highest binding energy of ∼532.4 eV that is indicative of CO32−/CO2 adsorbed on the surface.46 The values of the ratio of the various oxygen species, calculated from the relative areas of the fitted subpeaks (Table S3 in the ESI†), suggest that the O22−/O− content increases with the increase of the Li+ concentration. This result also supports that Li+ replaces Y3+.

Mechanism of enhanced upconversion luminescence
The influence of the concentration of Li+ ions on the upconversion luminescence spectra at room temperature under 980 nm laser excitation, recorded under the same experimental conditions (of temperature, pump power, etc.) at the same time, and the integral intensity of red upconversion emission of the as-prepared samples (including the Li18) is shown in Fig. 5a and b, and Fig. S5 (ESI†). Through qualitative comparison based on the emission spectra under the same conditions, the emission increases markedly in the samples with a Li-content up to 12%, but then it decreases with a furher increase of Li+ ion concentration. More specifically, for 6 and 12 mol% Li+-doping, there is a ∼7 and ∼30 times enhancement, respectively, compared to the Li-free sample (Li0). The decrease of the red emission intensity in Li18 is attributed to the presence of the secondary impurity phases (Fig. 1a).
 Fig. 5  Influence of Li+-content on (a) room temperature upconversion spectra under excitation at 980 nm produced by a CW laser (100 mW), and (b) the integral intensity of the red upconversion emission. 
It is also worthnoting that Yb-free samples exhibited a relatively weak emission intensity in the green and in the red regions. Additionally, the integral intensities of the sample doped with 12 mol% Li+ were not increased significantly, compared to the undoped sample (Fig. S6 in the ESI†). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the absence of Yb3+, since the Yb ion has a large absorption cross-section at around 980 nm, and thus, it can efficiently transfer the excitation energy to Er3+ ions.47,48
The Fourier-transformed infrared resonance (FT-IR) spectra and the positron annihilation lifetime spectra (PLAS) threw light on the mechanism of the enhanced upconversion luminescence by Li+-doping. In the FT-IR spectra (Fig. S7 in the ESI†), the peaks at around 1500 and 860 cm−1 were attributed to carbonate groups CO32−, and the peak at around 3500 cm−1 to OH groups. Nonetheless, it was noticed that their intensities do not display a regular change with the change of the Li-content.49,50 In general, OH−, CO32−, and defects are considered as quenching centres, which reduce the upconversion luminescence intensity by non-radiative transition. Some articles suggest that doping with lithium can enhance upconversion emission by reducing the number of quenching centers.36,51,52 Nevertheless, our FT-IR results can weakly support this conclusion since FT-IR is not a quantitative technique for surface groups. Furthermore, our results suggest that the intensity due to surface groups is not decreased with the increase of the Li+-content.
Consequently, the focus of attention in the investigation in order to gain an insight into the outstanding enhancement of upconversion luminescence by doping with Li+ in the produced samples, was shifted to the quenching centres. PALS is a well-established physical technique for characterizing vacancy defects in solid materials since it can provide direct information including size, type, and relative concentration of various vacancies.53–56 Typical positron lifetime spectra were recorded from the three samples, as shown in Fig. 6a. The PALS spectra were deconvoluted into three distinct lifetime components, τ1, τ2, and τ3, with relative intensities I1, I2 and I3, respectively (Table 3). These values are correlated with the size and the concentration of various kinds of defects. According to the theoretically calculated lifetime of positrons (Table 4), the shortest lifetime τ1 corresponds to positron annihilation as trapped , and the intermediate component τ2 can be ascribed to defect clusters (pentavacancy) present in the materials.58 The longest lifetime τ3, corresponding to annihilation at voids or the sample surface, can be considered as negligible owing to its low fraction, as usual.54,57

Further information about the relative concentration of the vacancies can be obtained by the relative intensity, which can quantify the abundance of a defect with respect to the reference sample (Fig. 6b). Hence, in the sample without Li+-doping, larger defect clusters should be more dominant than . Conversely, increase of the Li+-content leads to a decrease of defect clusters. A decrease of I2 from 53.2% to 47.4% and then to 32.6% is observed, while I1 increases as the Li+-content increases from 0 to 12 mol% in the samples (Table 3). In addition, the trend of the change of  is also consistent with the results of neutron diffraction and XPS analyses. These results (i.e. the results of PALS) suggest that the relative content of large defect clusters can be conveniently controlled by simply adjusting the Li+-content, which serves as an effective platform to reduce large quenching centres.
The value of the overall defect (vacancy) concentration, τm,58 was calculated using eqn (1): (1)The influence of the Li+-content on the mean lifetime τm of positrons annihilating in the samples is shown in Fig. 6c. A gradual decrease of τm was recorded with the increase of the Li+-content. This suggests that a reduction of the overall defect concentration takes place in the samples whose SAED patterns (Fig. S8 in the ESI†) revealed higher crystallinity and lower orientation disorder in the grain boundaries.
The above results suggest that lithium-doping introduces oxygen defects but it reduces the total defect concentration. In general, doping with lithium usually reduces the temperature of phase formation. This can favor a more uniform ion diffusion and thus, a reduction of the content of large defect clusters. Debasu et al. have proposed that the Li+-induced quantum yield enhancement is generally due to the decrease in the lattice parameter in different oxide hosts.39 Our experimental and theoretical results confirm that hypothesis, and further indicate that the decrease in the lattice parameter is related to the decrease of the total number of defects. Moreover, the reduction of disorder degree in the grain boundaries reduces the number of defects in grain boundaries that are rich in defects. All things considered, doping with lithium leads to a reduction of the total defects and of the large defect clusters, which results in a reduction of quenching centers. In addition, the substitution of Li+ for Y3+ reduces the local crystal field symmetry around the Er3+ ions. The combination of these two factors results in great enhancement of the upconversion luminescence.
Conclusions
Li+-doped (Y0.78−XYb0.20Er0.02LiX)2O3 powders were synthesized via the Pechini method. The addition of Li+ ions can significantly improve the upconversion emission intensity. The results from neutron diffraction demonstrated that Li+ occupies the Y3+ sites, which was also supported by the results of XPS analysis and XRD Rietveld refinement. This conclusion sheds light on the debate related to the position of Li+ in the lattice. The enhancement of emission intensity by Li-doping was attributed to the decrease of total defects, especially defect clusters (such as Y–O–O–Y–Y pentavacancy, Y–O–O–O–Y pentavacancy, etc.), which are quenching centers. These results provide a new insight, useful for an in-depth understanding of the enhanced luminescence mechanism, in order to explore a new avenue which may be open to the design of novel upconversion materials by engineering the defect concentrations.
