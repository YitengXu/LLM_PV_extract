    , Accepted 27th March 2020First published on 27th March 2020AbstractTo date, the facile preparation of photocatalysts with high efficiency, selectivity and photostability to promote CO2 conversion remains a big challenge. Here, we fabricated a novel photocatalyst, namely, MPA&MUA QDs prepared from CdS quantum dots (QDs) anchored by mixed MPA (3-mercaptopronic acid) and MUA (11-mercaptoalkanoic acid) ligands in one pot. Assisted by the sacrificial agent, the MPA&MUA QDs exhibited excellent performance and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to carbonaceous products HCOOH, CO and CH4 with the corresponding rates of 2.8, 5.4 × 10−2 and 6.3 × 10−3 μmol mg(cat)−1 h−1, respectively, under irradiation for 32 h. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for the production of HCOOH achieved a high value up to 23.2%, while for CO and CH4, it was 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. The attractive duration for photocatalysis under irradiation implied that the MPA&MUA QDs possessed enhanced photostability. Compared with the QDs solely decorated by MPA or MUA, the MPA&MUA QDs could enhance the energy gap Eg and tune the conduction band to smoothly generate CH4, CO and HCOOH. From the combination of steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved lifetime, we inferred that the MPA&MUA coatings had a decreased number of available hole trapping sites and improved passivation on the surface, which allowed for efficient hole and electron migration. With this work, we introduce a facial and feasible strategy to create an inexpensive and efficient visible-light photocatalyst for the multi-electron reduction of CO2.
Introduction
Mitigating CO2 emissions via improving the combustion efficiency of fossil fuels or exploring clean and renewable energy sources to promote CO2 conversion has represented a point of interest for many researchers over the past few decades.1 The natural photosynthesis of green plants sets an excellent example on how to fix and stepwise reduce CO2 into carbohydrates, which is vital for the maintenance of life on earth.2 Inspired by nature, the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO, preferably with the generation of high-valuable carbonaceous products, like CH4 and HCOOH, provides the dual advantage of a reduction in global warming and the synthesis of hydrocarbon fuels.3 Among the numerous pioneering photocatalysts, semiconducting CdS quantum dots (QDs) are attractive as ideal light absorbers and catalysts in the application of light-driven CO2 reduction.4 Their large extinction coefficients in the solar irradiation spectrum are better than those of most organic dyes and metal complexes and provide the basis for excellent light harvesting.5 Besides, owing to the appropriate conduction band edge located around −0.6 V (vs. NHE at pH 7), CdS can be typically employed for CO2 reduction because this potential is more negative than those of the CO2 reduction products.6 In particular, given that CO2 reduction involves multi-electron redox reactions, CdS QDs can trigger massive redox equivalents (excited electrons and holes) to guarantee their subsequent replenishments, where electrons push forward the reduction and holes are consumed in the appearance of hole scavengers.7 Another excellent merit of semiconductor CdS QDs is their size-dependent optical properties, expressed as quantum confinement effects, which endow them with tunable redox potential, providing the basic possibility to control photoreduction selectivity.8 However, the severe light corrosion of CdS is common on the surface, which causes a decrease in its photostability and greatly limits its application in photoreactions with CO2.9 Besides, CdS suffers from the drawback of a high recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.4c,10 Therefore, for enhancing the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, it is urgently desirable to improve the efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and prolong the charge-carrier fate.
Tremendous strategies, including semiconductor coupling, cocatalyst modification and element doping, have been devoted to suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs as well as photocorrosion of Cd surface.11 Semiconductor coupling and element doping can benefit enhanced charge separation, whereby the photogenerated electrons or charges of CdS transfer to the other semiconductor, but less active sites are exposed. Besides, the densely packed surface screens the QD core from the catalytic media. For cocatalyst modification, the organic linkage between the semiconductor and cocatalyst always blocks effective charge transfer. This is because charge exchange from QDs (electron donors) to cocatalysts (electron acceptors) cannot usually occur smoothly, unless cocatalysts can successfully permeate through the organic linkage layer.12
Most QDs colloids possess surfactants with a long alkyl organic ligand to stabilize the surface, whereby a layer of anchoring head groups (e.g. sulfide and halogen anions) are tethered to the QDs and a hydrophilic tail is directed away from the inorganic core.13 Although bound with an organic ligand, the QDs can still maintain abundant catalytic active sites in close contact with the catalytic media. Besides, ligand exchange on the QDs layers can finely tune the band structure and position of a semiconductor, which further influences the light-harvesting capacity, optoelectronic properties and reduction/oxidation power.14 Therefore, the efficiency of the catalyst differs from that of the surface ligand. Under suitable light irradiation, charge carriers are photogenerated. The electron transport is typically fast, while the hole transfer is more problematic.15 Hence, a strategy dedicated to improving hole migration is greatly desirable, whereby organic ligands can function as a relay to deliver holes effectively.16 In 2010, Mews reported that 3-mercaptopronic acid (MPA) on CdSe QDs surface could generate surface traps for capturing holes due to its HOMO energy level being lower than the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor.16a In 2015, Wu established a new type of sensitized photocathode, by simply engineering CdSe QDs onto a p-type semiconductor of NiO using the molecular linker mercaptoacetic acid (MAA).16b MAA facilitated the holes transfer and supported the efficient photoelectrochemical catalysis of H2 generation from water (Scheme 1).

Here, we modified CdS QDs with an MPA and MUA mixture in one pot. The mixed ligands anchored on the core of CdS QDs (MPA&MUA QDs) succeeded in tuning the energy gap of the semiconductor, and enabled it to achieve an enhanced driving force for electron transfer to reduce CO2. A combination of steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved lifetime inferred that the MPA&MUA coatings had a decrease in the available hole-trapping sites and improved passivation on the particle surface, leading to efficient holes and electrons separation. Assisted by the electron donor, MPA&MUA QDs performed as an efficient photocatalyst for visible light-driven CO2 reduction, displaying a high selectivity and photostability for the production of HCOOH, CO and CH4 in a water solution at close to neutral pH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to use mixed ligands for the synthesis of QDs photocatalysts in order to achieve high efficiency, selectivity and photostability for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.
Experimental
Materials
All the reagents and analytical grade chemicals were used without further purification. CdCl2·2.5H2O, Na2S, 3-mercaptopronic acid (MPA) and 11-mercaptoalkanoic acid (MUA) were purchased from Energy Chemical. Acetonitrile, TEOA, HCl and NaOH were purchased from Sinopharm Chemicals. Millipore water of 18 MΩ cm was used in all the experiments.
Characterization
A U-3900H UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the UV-vis absorption spectra. A Bruker 400 MHz instrument was used to collect the 1H NMR spectra in D2O, and the chemical shift of H2O was 4.79 ppm. A HPLC-MS experiment was performed on an Ekspertultra LC 100-XL by introducing the samples directly into the ESI† source using a syringe pump. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were used to obtain clearer images of the microstructure. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the electrodeposited film was performed on a Kratos AXIS ULTRA XPS system. The C1s peak at 284.8 eV was referenced for correcting the binding energy, and high-resolution Cd 3d and S 2p spectra were obtained. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were detected on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi). The time-resolved fluorescence measurements were recorded on a time-resolved confocal fluorescence instrument (MicroTime 200, PicoQuant).
Electrochemical methods
All the electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature using a CHI660E instrument. A three-electrode system was used to carry out the electrochemical characterization in 10 mL CH3CN as the solvent with 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte. A 0.07 cm2 glass carbon was chosen as the working electrode, with platinum wire as the auxiliary and a non-aqueous Ag+/Ag electrode (0.01 M AgNO3 in CH3CN) as the reference electrode respectively. Electrochemical measurements were conducted with the solution degassed with Ar stream for 20 min. After measurement, ferrocene was added as the reference. All potentials were reported versus NHE.
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction was carried out under ambient conditions under constant magnetic stirring in a cylindrical quartz reactor cell (20 mL) with the head space closed by a high-quality septa. An LED (λ = 400 nm) was used for the irradiation. In a typical experiment, 4 mL aqueous solution containing the photocatalyst (1 mg mL−1) with 1 mL TEOA was saturated by highly pure CO2 gas (99.999%) after purging for 30 min under constant stirring. The gaseous reduction products were measured by injecting 400 μL of the gaseous sample from the reactor headspace into a PerkinElmer Clarus 580 GC equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) and methanizer. Liquid product HCOOH was purified as follows. After filtering the reaction residuals, the solution was neutralized by NaOH to convert the low-boiling HCOOH into HCOONa. HCOONa was determined on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, with phenol as the internal standard.
The selectivity for the CO2 reduction product was obtained using the following formula:4hHCOOH selectivity = nHCOOH/(nHCOOH + nCO + nH2 + nCH4)

Preparation of the materials

Synthesis of MUA QDs. 
In nitrogen atmosphere, 114.2 mg (0.5 mmol) CdCl2·2.5H2O was dissolved into 100 ml N2 gas-saturated H2O. After the injection of 135 mg (0.62 mmol) MUA, the pH changed to 2 and a blue turbid suspension was obtained. Concentrated 1 M NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 7 to afford a colourless transparent solution. The system was treated by 5 mL fresh 0.1 M Na2S and then refluxed to turn yellow. After 4 h, the MUA QDs coatings could be obtained.


Synthesis of MPA QDs. 
The same process was followed but using 500 μL (11.5 mmol) MPA instead.


Synthesis of MPA&MUA QDs. 
The preparation of MPA&MUA QDs followed the same procedure as for MUA QD with an MPA and MUA mixture (containing 250 μL MPA (2.8 mmol) and 67.5 mg (0.3 mmol) with a mole ratio of 9:1) used instead. The synthesis of MPA&MUA QDs was carried out in one pot.
The yielded materials were further evaporated to remove the solvent to 1/4 (volume ratio), and isopropanol was added to precipitate the material, which was isolated by centrifugation and washed with ultrapure water to remove the residual and surface-bound stabilizers.

Results and discussion
The modification of the CdS QDs by MPA, MUA or the mixture of MPA and MUA was followed based on the reference, which was synthesized in one pot.17 Interestingly, the optimum form and catalysis of the coatings with the mixed ligands differed from the mole ratio of MPA and MUA, showing that 1:1 afforded the turbid solution, and 4:1 inhibited the catalysis with a small amount of CO2 conversion. Adjusting the ratio to 9:1 afforded transparent bright-yellow colloidal MPA&MUA QDs with the best catalytic performance.
The MPA&MUA QDs were further characterized. A representative of high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in Fig. S1,† which shows the MPA and MUA fabricated QDs as nanoparticles nearly monodispersed with a mean size of 3.3 nm. The lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing distance of 0.281 nm were investigated, corresponding to the (110) lattice plane of CdS. The morphology of both MPA QDs and MUA QDs was similar to that of the MPA&MUA QDs, illustrating that the nanoparticles had sizes of 4.5 nm and 2.9 nm, respectively (Fig. S1†). These results were consistent with the DLS (dynamic light scattering) results, which showed the similar particles size of the three samples (Fig. S2†). The chemical composition and chemical state of the elements in MPA&MUA QDs were identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 1 and S3,† the survey XPS spectrum confirmed the presence of Cd, S, C and O elements. The inevitable existence of S, C and O peaks was derived from the carbon alkyl linkage, confirming the organic ligands had been successfully attached on the surface of the CdS. In the high-resolution Cd 3d spectrum, two distinct peaks at binding energies of 411.9 eV for Cd 3d3/2 and 405.2 eV for Cd 3d5/2 could be observed, demonstrating that the valence state of Cd was +2.18 The difference of 6.7 eV in the binding energy of the Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 4d5/2 peaks is also a characteristic of the divalent Cd 3d state. This is consistent with the reported results of Cd2+ in CdS.18 The XPS signals of S 2p indicated a peak with a binding energy of 162.1 eV, which is a typical signal of metallic sulfide.18 Furthermore, the optical properties of MPA&MUA QDs were displayed in the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (UV-vis DRS). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the MPA&MUA QDs exhibited a boosted absorbance band at a wavelength larger than 310 nm, followed by a sharp absorption edge located at around 476 nm. This indicates it could harvest photons in the visible-light region for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In the comparison with QDs solely decorated by MPA (MPA QDs) or MUA (MUA QDs), their absorption edges were expanded to 538 nm and 562 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). Clearly, the absorbance band of MPA&MUA QDs was blue-shift compared to the MPA QDs and MUA QDs. The UV-vis absorption spectra in water further underpinned the same phenomenon, whereby the MPA&MUA QDs exhibited a dissimilar profile and their maxima absorbance was shifted to a higher energetic band (Fig. S4†). Fig. 2b shows the corresponding Tauc plots, and the band gaps (Eg) were calculated by the plot of (αhν)2versus the photoenergy (hν). The estimated Eg value was 2.76 eV, larger than those of MAP QDs and MUA QDs (2.45 and 2.30 eV, respectively) (Fig. 2), suggesting the MPA&MUA QDs could afford a more powerful driving force for the generation of charge carriers, which may dramatically influence the photocatalytic behaviour.19

The photoreduction CO2 activity of the MPA&MUA QDs was evaluated in water under visible light irradiation (LED, λ = 400 nm) in the presence of a sacrificial agent. The inorganic holes captures e.g. S2−, SO32−, while they are abandoned because they usually induce a salting-out effect to aggregate the QDs. Moreover, negatively charged thiolated carboxylic ligands can repel anionic S2− and SO32− from the close contact with QDs.20 In contrast, the non-charged hole scavenger TEOA can not only ameliorate the photocatalytic performance dramatically, but also act as a proton source for the generation of carbonaceous products.21 Additionally, the employed TEOA can improve the solubility of CO2 in the liquid, assisted by the interaction with the N atom on TEOA.22 It is noted that to minimize the aggregation driven by the changes in the catalytic parameters, including the pH, concentration and ionic strength, the optimal conditions were applied under a surface-coated colloidally stable condition. Some organic solvents appear to favour the photocatalysis; however, under irradiation, the organic THF or DMF can be easily decomposed to emit CO. Thus, pure deionized water was chosen directly. More importantly, water can both serve as an excellent solvent to disperse CdS colloids and can provide protons to facilitate in proton-participant CO2 reduction. The concentration of the photocatalyst was determined by a Job plot through dispersing CdS QDs solid into water, as shown in Fig. S5.† The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted by the addition of concentrated KOH or HCl.
The gaseous products CO, CH4 and H2 were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), while the liquid product HCOOH was determined on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, with phenol as the internal standard (Fig. S6 and S7†). The yields of the batch photocatalytic tests are displayed in Fig. 3. It could be seen that the pH plays a critical role, and pH 6 could boost the yields for carbonaceous products. Either in gas or liquid, a pH lower than 6 gives a lower efficiency. This might be due the instability of QDs in more acidic atmospheres, where the uncharged COOH groups on the thiolated ligand can precipitate QDs from the solution. Adjusting the pH above 6 could moderate photocatalysis with the reduction of CO2, but it generally becomes less competitive to the generation of H2 at much higher pH. As shown in Fig. S8,† the controlled measurements illustrate that the photo-induced CO2 reduction could be confirmed by the disappearance of TEOA. Moreover, in the absence of CO2 (under N2), the negligible CO2 reduction activity signifies that CO2 was the original resource to generate the carbon-reduced products (Fig. S9†). This is correlated with the results reported by Lu et al.,4k but different from the tests carried out by Lee et al.,23 where MPA-capped CdSe QDs were homogeneously deposited on the porous NiO electrode for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Those researchers commented that the product formic acid originated from the degradation of MPA during the long-time electrolysis. We assumed the difference might be derived from the different synthetic process for QDs and catalytic conditions for CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 3  Amounts of gas products varying by pH: a) CO, H2 and CH4 and b) the generation of liquid HCOOH. 
Combined with the results revealed in Fig. 3, the amount of each reduced product under the optimal conditions after 32 h irradiation was divided by the quality of the catalyst to yield the turnover number (TON). As a result, TONs for HCOOH of 90 μmol mg(cat)−1, CO of 1.74 μmol mg(cat)−1, and CH4 of 0.2 μmol mg(cat)−1 were obtained, corresponding to rates of 2.8, 5.4 × 10−2 and 6.3 × 10−3 μmol mg(cat)−1 h−1, respectively. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for the production of HCOOH was 23.2%, while for CO and CH4 it was 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. Clearly, MPA&MUA QDs harmonizes to effectively reduce CO2 into HCOOH with the selectivity as high as 97.5%. It is worth emphasizing that, to the best of our knowledge, this performance is even better than the system Wu reported on the composite CdS materials or other CdS-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.4p,24
In addition, as described in Fig. 4, time-dependence CO2 photoreduction was performed and the sample exhibited a stable photostability for 32 h, suggesting the excellent photostability for CO2 reduction. This revealed that both the amounts of reduced products in the gas and liquid increased dramatically in the first 16 h. Prolonging irradiation could slow down the rate of reduction, but the catalysis could be further recovered after re-purging CO2 into solution (Fig. 4). This indicates that abundant CO2 is essential for the efficient photoreducing reaction. It also revealed the high durability and photostability of the MPA&MUA QDs. In comparison, MPA QDs and MUA QDs both acted as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction under the same conditions, but a declining catalytic behaviour was obtained, showing that no CH4 was detected in both cases, and the production of HCOOH was discontinued when MUA QDs was applied (Fig. S10 and S11†).

The above observations indicate that MPA&MUA QDs could boost the photocatalytic activity towards the more attractive pathway. Despite the difficulty to unambiguously make clear the decoration of MPA and MUA on the QDs, several facts could be drawn to unleash the fertile possibilities of MPA&MUA coatings: 1) in comparison with the absorbance bands of MPA QDs and MUA QDs, MPA&MUA QDs were distinctly blue-shifted to a higher energy lever. However, if directly mixing the MPA QDs and MUA QDs colloidal solutions together, followed by precipitation, the band edge of the mixture in the UV-vis DRS appeared at 566 nm, close to the band edge of MUA QDs (Fig. S12†). This result absolutely rejects that mechanical mixing can lead to a change in the band position and that MPA&MUA coatings could arise from the mixing of MUA QDs and MPA QDs. 2) The efficiency and selectivity of MPA&MUA QDs illustrates their superior activity compared to MPA QDs and MUA QDs, implying the surface of MPA&MUA QDs favours enriching electrons. When mixing MPA QDs and MUA QDs directly for photocatalysis, no CH4 was detected. This is definitely different from that of the MPA&MUA QDs, further rejecting that mixing MUA QDs and MPA QDs could give birth to MPA&MUA QDs. Meanwhile, the observation also excluded the possibility to generate MPA&MUA QDs under the photocatalytic condition. Therefore, it is proposed on MPA&MUA QDs surface, where MUA and MPA can decorate the same CdS core. This might be because both S atoms on MUA or MPA can competitively be incorporated into the lattice of CdS, which can decrease the lattice defects and tune the energy gap. Hence, the thermodynamic requirements were perfectly satisfied for forming the complicated reduced products.10,25 In reality, until now, it is still difficult to determine the quantification of MUA and MPA on one CdS core, and so the corresponding research is ongoing now.
From the thermodynamic perspective for CO2 reduction, it is generally accepted that the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency of a QD-based system is determined by the following factors: (1) the separation efficiency of the electron–hole pairs generated on the QDs surface; (2) the electron-transfer efficiency between the CB (conduction band) and CO2; (3) the holes migration from the VB to the hole scavenger; and (4) the activity of the catalyst.26 To shed light on the light-driven CO2 reduction of MPA&MUA coatings, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved lifetime of photocatalysts analyses were applied, which have been proven to be effective methods to monitor the surface state of QDs.14a–c,27–29 As shown in Fig. 5a, the MPA&MUA coatings led to the highest PL intensity. The MUA coatings exhibited an intermediate PL value. The lowest PL intensity was observed for MPA coatings. Comparison of the changes in regards the time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime are shown in Fig. 5b. It is clear that the PL decay was related to the lifetime and differed from that for the QDs with the different modifications. The lifetime could be fitted with a bi-exponential function. The shorter lifetime, longer lifetime and the calculated average lifetime are listed in Table S1.† The longer lifetime and average lifetime for the MPA&MUA-coated nanoparticles were 99.4 ns and 27.7 ns, respectively, i.e. relatively longer than those for the QDs decorated by MPA (82.1 ns, and 6.4 ns) and MUA (89.2 ns and 12.2 ns). Clearly, the MPA&MUA-coated nanoparticles had the longest lifetime, compared to the MPA coatings bearing the shortest lifetime, while the MUA assembly had a medial position. The trend was the same as that for the PL intensity.
 Fig. 5  a) PL intensity of MPA&MUA QDs, MPA QDs and MUA QDs; b) time-resolved lifetime of each photocatalytic material. 
In general, the shorter lifetime is related to the quenching excitons, whereas the longer lifetime is deemed to originate from the formation of photogenerated electrons and holes.4i,27 Accordingly, the hole–electron pair separation clearly differed from the QDs core with different ligand modifications.28 Combined with the photocatalytic behaviour of CO2 reduction, QDs decoration with the mixed ligands can prolong the lifetime of excited charge carriers. Our observation runs counter to Banin's and Jin's results, which described that the QDs modified by cocatalyst Au or CdSe with more quenched luminescence and a shortened lifetime displayed a better catalytic efficiency.14b,c However, our sample was totally different. Cocatalyst modification was operated in their cases; therefore the interaction between the QDs and cocatalysts should account for the quenched PL and shortened lifetime. Usually, the PL intensity and lifetime are dictated by the competition between the non-radiative and radiative relaxations in QDs.14a–c The magnitude of the PL intensity and lifetime decay can be regarded as an indicator that reflects the status of the surface passivation on the surface of the QDs.14a,29 A high probability of trapping events usually reduces the number of charge carriers recombining radiatively, leading to the quenched PL intensity and the shortened lifetime.14a–c,29,30 On the CdS QDs surface, unsaturated Cd or S dangling bonds give rise to surface defects, regarded as efficient trapping sites. Therefore, on the MPA&MUA coatings surface, the surface passivation was dramatically improved by the mixed ligand. This further supports our proposal that both ligands (MPA and MUA) can complementarily be incorporated into the lattice of the CdS core, resulting in the ameliorated QDs surface. Thus, charge carriers are more likely to migrate than to react with surface defects, thus accompanied by efficient holes and electrons separation.31 As a result, the electrons can reduce CO2, thus allowing for an improvement in the catalytic activity.
The interaction of the coating assembles with CO2 and TEOA were further examined in fluorescence quenching experiments. In the presence of TEOA, the PL intensity was almost unchanged in the three cases, no matter which ligand was loaded on the QDs surface; while in the CO2-saturated solution with the same concentration of TEOA, the PL intensity of the QDs was quenched to a different extent, with the MPA&MUA coating presenting the most efficient quenching (100%), while MPA provided for an intermediate interaction with CO2 and TEOA (88.9%), and MUA offered the lowest quenching efficiency (85.3%) (Fig. 6). This result implies that the interaction between QDs surface and CO2 dominates the quenching of the PL, and the electron transfer among the QDs, CO2 and TEOA harmonizes the photocatalysis towards a much more benign way for reducing CO2.32 Moreover, the MPA&MUA coating showed the most efficient quenching, implying it had the most valid interaction with CO2 and TEOA, in line with its highest catalytic performance.

To deeply dig into the outstanding reduction behaviour of the MPA&MUA QDs, the energy levels of the CB and VB were considered. For the reduction reaction, the CB edge position makes the dominant contribution to the catalytic efficiency and the selectivity.23 To perform a highly effective photocatalytic reduction of CO2, the CB edge of a semiconductor photocatalyst should be located at a more negative voltage than the reduction potential of CH4/CO2 (−0.24 V vs. NHE) and the VB edge position should be more positive than the oxidation potential of the hole oxidant, which can furnish a tractive force for CO2 thermodynamic photoreduction.6,33 In general, a simple method can be applied to determine the band edge positions of the CB and VB of a semiconductor, respectively. The CB edge of a semiconductor at zero charge (pHzpc) can be determined using the following equation:34 ECB = χ − Ee − 1/2Eg(1) EVB = Eg + ECB(2)where ECB is the CB edge potential, EVB is the VB edge potential and χ is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms, which is defined as the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionization energy. Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale, about equal to 4.5 eV.34 As discussed above, the UV-vis DRS results showed that the band gap of the MPA&MUA QDs was 2.76 eV. The calculated CB position was approximately −0.84 V. Hence, the VB position was calculated to be 1.92 V. Following the same analogy, the CB positions of the MPA coatings and MUA assembly were calculated to be located at −0.68 V and −0.60 V, with VB positions at 1.77 V and 1.70 V, respectively. Due to the large overpotential associated with the CO2 reduction process, the band gap should be sufficiently large. Therefore, CdS QDs with the increased band gaps are expected to have more favourable CB energy for affording electrons to reduce CO2.6 Despite visible light absorption decreasing with the increased band gap, the efficiency is the balance between the thermodynamic ability to trigger electron transfer and the light absorption resulting in the optimal assembly. In comparison, the MPA&MUA QDs afforded a much more negative CB energy than that used for reducing CO2 into CH4, CO and HCOOH (the reduction potential for CH4/CO2, CO/CO2 and HCOOH/CO2 at −0.24, −0.52 and −0.61 V vs. NHE respectively, pH = 7),6 suggesting it can provide enough driving force to smoothly generate CH4, CO and HCOOH (Scheme 2). In contrast, the CB of the MUA QDs was located more positively than that for the formation of HCOOH, which showed an inert activity towards the photogeneration of HCOOH. This is well evidenced by the results in Fig. S11,† where no HCOOH was detected with MUA coatings as photocatalysts. Although based on theory, it seems that both MPA QDs and MUA QDs can enable reducing CO2 into CH4, albeit the 8e sequential electrons addition is much more complicated and sluggish. Gerischer's theory clearly states that the logarithm of the electron-transfer rate is a quadratic function with respect to the driving force ΔG, which signifies that a more negative CB energy lever can afford a larger driving force to inject electrons to the redox media.19b,35 Therefore, MPA&MUA QDs can manifest the fastest electron transfer, which is in line with the highest efficiency.
 Scheme 2  Proposed mechanism for MPA&MUA QDs assembly to reduce CO2. 
It has been witnessed that organic ligands can function as a relay to mobilize holes from the VB of QDs to the interface of the integrated substrate.16 Furthermore, the HOMO of MPA and MUA were determined by electrochemical measurements, which demonstrated that the HOMO levels of MPA and MUA were located at 1.64 and 1.39 V (vs. NHE), respectively (Fig. S13†).16a Both these values are lower than the VB level of CdS, meaning that the hole transfers from VB of the coatings to the thiolated ligands traps are thermodynamically favourable. Scheme 2 outlines the possible CO2 photoreduction mechanism of the MPA&MUA QDs system. As illustrated, the energy levels of the surface traps induced by the mixed ligands were located between the energy levels of the VB of the QDs and the hole scavengers. Once the QDs were excited, the photo-induced holes quickly transferred to both MAP and MUA, and subsequently to the hole scavenger. On the other hand, the mixed ligands induced a more negative CB energy value, which can afford a larger driving force to inject electrons to the redox media for facilitating CO2 reduction. This process successfully prevents the excited charge carrier from recombination. It is thus clear that the abilities of QDs to store and deliver multiple excited-state carriers play a key role in enhancing the activity of CO2 reduction. Besides, the high duration of MPA&MUA coatings for photocatalysis can also be explained by the efficient hole migration. It is accepted that the interior photogenerated holes continuously escalate the photocorrosion of the outer surface, leading to a fast deactivation of CdS via concentrating it in the bonding orbital region of the surface sulfur.36 Both MPA and MUA on QDs can deliver holes on the surface. Holes are efficiently removed, instead of oxidizing surface sulfur, which dramatically avoids the collapse of the QDs framework, and leading to an improved photostability.
Conclusions
In summary, mixed ligands modification was operated to construct CdS QDs frameworks. It was revealed that the mixed ligands MPA and MUA play a key role in tuning the energy gap of the semiconductor, achieving an enhanced driving force for electron transfer. Due to the HOMO of MPA and MUA being lower than the VB level of CdS, the hole transfer from the VB of the coatings to the thiolated ligands traps is thermodynamically favourable. Combined with the observation of the PL and lifetime, it is proposed that the MPA&MUA QDs facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs for photocatalysis, and also promote hole migration to dramatically avoid the collapse of the CdS framework. Assisted by the electron donor, the MPA&MUA QDs perform as an efficient photocatalyst with an enhanced duration for visible light-driven CO2 reduction. They displayed a high selectivity for the production of HCOOH, and CO and CH4 in a water solution under mild condition. These findings demonstrate great opportunities to intelligently design the functional component for promoting long-lasting charge carrier separation, which can further help to realize photo-driven multi-electron reduction reactions. This strategy opens a new scenario for exploring new promising alternative photocatalysts for the sustainable and cost-effective conversion of solar energy into usable fuels or chemicals.
