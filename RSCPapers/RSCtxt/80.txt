    , Accepted 15th July 2014First published on 24th July 2014AbstractTwo-dimensional graphene has tremendous potential to be used as a transparent conducting electrode (TCE), owing to its high transparency and conductivity. To date graphene films have been applied to several kinds of solar cells except the Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cell. In this work, we present a novel TCE structure consisting of a doped graphene film and a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to replace the ZnO:Al (AZO) electrode for CIGS. By optimizing the contact between graphene and intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO), a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.5% has been achieved, which is among the highest efficiencies of graphene-based solar cells ever reported and approaching those of AZO-based solar cells. Besides, the active area of our solar cells reaches 45 mm2, much larger than other highly efficient graphene-based solar cells (>10%) reported so far. Moreover, compared with AZO-based CIGS solar cells, the total reflectance of the graphene-based CIGS solar cells is decreased and the quantum efficiency of the graphene-based CIGS is enhanced in the near infrared region (NIR), which strongly support graphene as a competitive candidate material for the TCE in the CIGS solar cell. Furthermore, the graphene/PMMA film can protect the solar cell from moisture, making the graphene-based solar cells much more stable than the AZO-based solar cells.
1. Introduction
ZnO:Al (AZO) films are widely used as transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) in a-Si, CdTe, Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS), Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and dye-sensitized solar cells.1–7 However, AZO limits the photo-generated current due to rather strong absorption in the IR region of the spectrum.1,8 Therefore new TCEs with higher transmittance beyond about 800 nm are in great need. Graphene has tremendous potential to replace AZO, owing to its high transparency with only about 2.3% absorption, absence of the thickness-dependent interference effect, and superior electrical conductivity.9–11
In the past few years, graphene has been widely reported as TCEs for organic photovoltaics, silicon Schottky junctions and hybrid solar cells.12–19 However, in the field of thin film solar cells, similar work is still in its infancy. Graphene films have been used as TCEs in CdTe solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.17%.8 The application of graphene films as a window electrode in the silicon thin-film solar cell has also been demonstrated.20 However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on the use of graphene-based TCEs in CIGS solar cells for replacement of AZO films. Here we present a novel TCE structure for CIGS solar cells, in which a AuCl3 doped graphene film grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was transferred with a thin layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and was then used to replace the normal AZO window layer. We have demonstrated a PCE as high as 13.5%, very close to that of the reference standard CIGS solar cell. Since the development of a large area solar cell is an important step for the practical applications of solar cells, the efficiency of our graphene-based solar cell with a large active area of 45 mm2 (13.5%) is a good achievement, and only University of Oxford and Peking University have reported higher efficiency of the graphene-based solar cell (15.6% (ref. 21) and 14.5% (ref. 17)) with a smaller active area (<10 mm2) to date (as shown in Table 1S† which summarizes the efficiencies of graphene-based solar cells). Researchers in Peking University also reported that their cell efficiencies would decrease from 14.5% to 10.6% with enlarging the active area of their graphene–Si solar cell by 3-fold.17
In this work, we employed several methods (denoted as processes A, B, C, and D in Fig. 1) to replace the AZO layer with graphene or a graphene/PMMA layer in the CIGS solar cell (see the Experimental section for details). In process A, the AZO electrode was substituted by the graphene layer while the rest of the layers remained the same as the CIGS reference solar cell. With the graphene/PMMA film directly transferred onto the i-ZnO surface, the PMMA was subsequently dissolved in chloroform for 10 minutes. Finally, the Ni/Al/Ni top-contact grids were deposited onto the graphene film. Compared to process A, the position of the Ni/Al/Ni metal grids in processes B, C and D was changed from on top of the TCE to underneath the TCE, i.e., right on the i-ZnO surface. Since the cross-section of the Ni/Al/Ni grids deposited by evaporation with a metal mask is trapezoidal as shown in Fig. 1S,† the graphene/PMMA layer is able to conform to the surface of i-ZnO near the Ni/Al/Ni grids. The difference between processes C and B is that the i-ZnO layer thickness in C is increased to reduce the roughness of the i-ZnO surface. Process D differs from process C by using thin PMMA. The active area of all the solar cells in processes A, B, C and D were determined to be 45 mm2 by mechanical scribing, which is much larger than other highly efficient graphene-based solar cells reported so far. Fig. 2a shows a photograph of a graphene-based CIGS solar cell with a novel TCE structure. Fig. 2b shows the schematic structures of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell in Fig. 2a and the reference CIGS solar cell with a standard TCE structure.

2. Results and discussion
A graphene film was grown via low pressure CVD on 25 μm thick Cu foil and then transferred to a target substrate by using the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) method described elsewhere.22,23 (see the Experimental section). Fig. 3a shows the Raman spectrum of our as-grown graphene film. The Raman spectrum contains two typical peaks: the G band (∼1581 cm−1) and the 2D band (∼2683 cm−1). The 2D band is a single Lorentzian peak centered at 2683 cm−1 with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼35.4 cm−1. The intensity ratio of the 2D band and the G band (I2D/IG) is ∼3.45, indicating that the as-grown film is single-layer graphene.8,22 The absence of the D band indicates that our CVD grown graphene is of high quality.22 As shown in Fig. 3b, the transmittances of 1 layer graphene is about 97.1% and is relatively flat, with little dependence on the wavelength. In the same panel, the transmittances of PMMA of 150 nm and 400 nm thickness, 4 layer graphene, 1 layer graphene/PMMA, 4 layer graphene/PMMA, and AZO of 150 nm and 600 nm thickness are shown together for comparison. Obviously, the graphene-based transparent electrodes have much better transmittance in the wavelength range of interest compared to the AZO films, revealing the benefits that CIGS devices made of graphene-based electrodes can enjoy.

The J–V characteristics of the reference CIGS solar cell fabricated with the standard process and the graphene-based CIGS solar cells fabricated with different processes A, B, C, and D are listed in Table 1. It is found that the CIGS solar cell with the AZO layer directly replaced by the one layer graphene film in the standard solar cell structure (Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/TCE/metal grid) as outlined by process A has very low conversion efficiency, and practically no current can be collected. By changing the solar cell structure and improving the adhesion between graphene and i-ZnO as outlined in processes B, C, and D, higher PCE of graphene-based CIGS solar cells have been achieved. The details are to be discussed below.

Fig. 4a and b show the optical and SEM images of the surface of a CIGS solar cell with the graphene/PMMA film directly transferred onto the i-ZnO layer (for the case of process A in Fig. 1). It is clear that the graphene/PMMA film at this stage does not exhibit any dilapidation due to the mechanical protection of PMMA. However, when the PMMA is removed by chloroform, many small cracks and holes start to appear in the graphene layer due to the surface roughness of i-ZnO, as shown in Fig. 4c. As the transparent conducting electrode of the CIGS solar cell with a large active area, a graphene layer with such high density of cracks presents a very high sheet resistance (Rsheet), resulting in high series resistance (Rs) of the solar cells (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the cracks in graphene and the residual of PMMA are harmful for current collection since they jeopardize the quality of the deposited Ni/Al/Ni grids. This explains the very low power conversion efficiency (PCE < 0.5%) from the first graphene-based CIGS solar cell (sample #2) in Table 1 fabricated by process A.

(d) Sheet resistance vs. the number of graphene layers for graphene on i-ZnO, glass, and PMMA substrates. AuCl3 doped graphene is also shown for comparison. 
To eliminate the above problems, we have designed a new structure of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell without removing the PMMA layer. As presented for process B in Fig. 1, the Ni/Al/Ni grid was deposited onto the i-ZnO layer prior to the transfer of the graphene/PMMA film. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PMMA layer with either 150 nm or 400 nm thickness is perfectly transparent. Without the removal of PMMA (Fig. 4d), the 1-layer graphene/PMMA film has a sheet resistance of 272 Ω sq−1, while the graphene film on the glass substrate after removal of PMMA has a much higher sheet resistance of 415 Ω sq−1. The sheet resistance of the graphene/PMMA film decreases with the increase of the number of graphene layers. 4-Layer graphene/PMMA has a low sheet resistance of 87 Ω sq−1. In contrast, when the as-grown graphene film was transferred to a 125 nm thick i-ZnO layer and the PMMA was subsequently removed, its sheet resistance increases by at least one order of magnitude compared with the graphene transferred to a flat glass substrate after the removal of PMMA. This suggests that the rough i-ZnO surface is detrimental to the conductivity of graphene, consistent with the SEM observations in Fig. 4c.
To further decrease the sheet resistance, the graphene/PMMA films were immersed in 20 mM AuCl3 aqueous solution for 30 s for doping before transferring them to the i-ZnO surface. After doping, the sheet resistance of 4-layer graphene/PMMA is reduced from 87 to 55 Ω sq−1 while the transmittance of the whole film remains about 89% at 550 nm. These results are much better than most of the reported graphene based TCEs and are close to the best result ever reported.24
As revealed in Table 1, using doped graphene/PMMA films as TCEs in the graphene-based CIGS solar cells and the fabrication process B, the cell performance is significantly improved with a much higher current density than that from cells made by process A. As shown in Fig. 2S† and Table 1, the solar cell with a 4-layer graphene TCE (sample #4) exhibits a much better performance with a power conversion efficiency of 7.20%, while the 1-layer graphene solar cell (sample #3) has an efficiency of 5.62%. The difference in the conversion efficiency for the 1-layer and 4-layer graphene TCE solar cells comes both from their current density and fill factor. With more graphene layers, the sheet resistance is reduced and the electron charge collection by the TCE is improved, resulting in a higher current density and a larger fill factor. However, the increase of the number of graphene layers reduces the light transmittance and jeopardizes the advantage of graphene in its transparency and therefore the final conversion efficiency of CIGS solar cells.
However, graphene-based solar cells made by process B are still much inferior to the reference CIGS solar cell, mostly in terms of the current density and the fill factor. By comparing the structure of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell and the standard CIGS solar cell (Fig. 1), we found two possible reasons: (1) the sheet resistance of the 4-layer graphene/PMMA film (about 55 Ω sq−1) is still higher than that of 150 nm AZO (about 20–30 Ω sq−1); (2) the contact between graphene and i-ZnO is still not good enough for effective electron charge transfer. While it is difficult to reduce the sheet resistance of graphene layers at this stage, the contact between graphene and the i-ZnO surface can be improved.
We here use a model to illustrate how the i-ZnO/TCE interface influences the performance of the CIGS solar cells, as sketched in Fig. 5a. The solar cell has a textured interface due to the inherent structures of CIGS, CdS and i-ZnO. The contact morphology between graphene and i-ZnO can lead to three types of cells: Cell-A, Cell-B and Cell-C. We use θ to represent the difference of the contact morphology dictated by the i-ZnO surface. For Cell-A, θ equals to 180°, implying a flat interface. For Cell-B and Cell-C, θ is in the range of 0°–180° and θB is larger than θC. In the case of AZO–CIGS solar cells, since the AZO TCE is deposited by RF sputtering, it uniformly covers the whole i-ZnO surface independent of the detailed morphology. In the case of graphene-based CIGS solar cells, since the graphene/PMMA TCE is transferred to the i-ZnO surface by the wet transfer method, graphene/PMMA cannot fully conform to the i-ZnO surface if θ is very small, as depicted in Cell-C by Fig. 5a. In contrast, for θ much bigger than 0°, graphene/PMMA is flexible to develop large enough bending to conform to the substrate, as modelled by Cell-A and Cell-B in Fig. 5a. We use a single diode model to analyse the performance in Cell-A, Cell-B and Cell-C for the graphene-based CIGS solar cells. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the J–V characteristics can be described by (1)where J0 is the reverse saturation current, JL is the photo-current, q is the electron charge, A is the ideality factor, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Rs is the series resistance, and Rsh is the shunt resistance.
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic drawing of three kinds of interfaces between graphene/PMMA and i-ZnO. (b) Resistance change as a function of the bending angle of graphene/PMMA. The inset shows a schematic image of the curved graphene/PMMA/Scotch tape. 
The series resistance can be expressed by Rs = R0 + R. Here R0 consists of (1) bulk resistance of the function layers of the solar cell, (2) bulk resistance of the back electrode, and (3) contact resistance of all the interfaces except the interface between graphene/PMMA and i-ZnO in the device. The resistance R refers to the bulk resistance of the graphene/PMMA film and the contact resistance between graphene/PMMA and i-ZnO. For Cell-A, Cell-B and Cell-C, R is given by Ra, Rb, and Rc, respectively. At different bendings, as shown in Fig. 5b, the bulk resistance of the graphene/PMMA film decreases with the increase of θ. This phenomenon was also observed in many other studies.24–26 Therefore, Ra of Cell-A is smaller than Rb in Cell-B, and thus in principle the conversion efficiency of Cell-A is higher than that of Cell-B. The reason for larger Rc than Rb is not only from the bulk resistance contribution of the graphene/PMMA film, but more importantly also from the contribution due to the incomplete contact between the graphene/PMMA film and the i-ZnO surface.
The above analysis suggests that the poor interface between the graphene TCE and the i-ZnO surface is an important cause for the low efficiency of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell. Below, we demonstrate two strategies to modify this interface. Either by optimizing the thickness of i-ZnO as in process C or by reducing the PMMA thickness in the transfer process of graphene as in process D, a better contact between graphene and i-ZnO and thus a higher efficiency of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell can be achieved.
As we discussed above, the surface morphology of i-ZnO plays an important role in contact with the graphene/PMMA film. As shown in Fig. 6a and c, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the 125 nm thick i-ZnO deposited on a glass substrate is only about 25.9 nm, but increases to 36.8 nm if deposited on the CdS/CIGS/Mo substrate. This result indicates that the higher roughness of i-ZnO/CdS/CIGS/Mo is mainly caused by the CIGS film (RMS = 46.06 nm), as shown in Fig. 6b. Nevertheless, it is found that the RMS roughness of i-ZnO films on CdS/CIGS/Mo decreases as the thickness of i-ZnO increases. As shown in Fig. 6d, the RMS roughness of the i-ZnO film decreases from 45.70 to 34.36 nm as the thickness increases from 50 nm to 200 nm.

(d) i-ZnO RMS roughness as a function of i-ZnO film thickness when deposited on CdS/CIGS/Mo samples. (e) The J–V curves of the graphene-based CIGS solar cells with different thicknesses of i-ZnO films under AM 1.5 illumination. (f) The dark J–V curves of graphene-based CIGS solar cells with different thicknesses of i-ZnO films. 
Based on the above observation, we designed process C in which the thickness of i-ZnO was varied from 50 to 200 nm to optimize graphene based CIGS solar cells. As shown in Fig. 6e and Table 1, when the thickness of i-ZnO is increased from 50 to 125 nm, both Jsc and FF of the graphene based solar cells increase substantially. A further increase of the i-ZnO thickness to 200 nm resulted a small decrease of the conversion efficiency, but still a better performance than the 50 nm thick i-ZnO solar cell. We attribute the increase of Jsc and FF mainly to the much smoother surface of the i-ZnO film, which leads to a better contact with the graphene/PMMA film. As the roughness becomes smaller with the i-ZnO thickness increase from 50 to 125 nm, θ would increase and the percentage of Cell-C in the graphene based CIGS solar cell would decrease which improves the overall Jsc and FF of the whole solar cell. For the solar cell with the 200 nm thick i-ZnO film, although the surface becomes even flatter with a RMS roughness of 34.36 nm, slight drops in Jsc and FF are observed, possibly due to the higher bulk resistance of the thicker i-ZnO film.
To assist our analyses, we also measured the dark J–V curves of these graphene-based CIGS solar cells as shown in Fig. 6f. The dark J–V curves can be fitted by eqn (1) with JL = 0. The fitting parameters are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that Rs is reduced and Rsh is enhanced when the thickness of i-ZnO is increased from 50 to 125 (or 200) nm. This perfectly explains the increase of FF in the graphene-based CIGS solar cells with a relatively thick i-ZnO film. Possibly due to the higher sheet resistance of the graphene film and the poorer contact between graphene and i-ZnO, the Rs and Rsh of the graphene based CIGS solar cells are respectively about two times larger and a few times smaller than those of the reference AZO–CIGS solar cell, respectively, resulting in smaller Jsc and FF obtained for the graphene-based CIGS solar cells.

Since the graphene-based CIGS solar cell with a 125 nm i-ZnO layer has higher conversion efficiency, in the following, the 125 nm thick i-ZnO was chosen in the subsequent experiments for better performance.
To further increase the efficiencies of graphene/PMMA based CIGS solar cells, the transfer process of the graphene film was optimized as shown in process D (Fig. 1). In order to make the graphene/PMMA film conform to i-ZnO better, we attempted to make the composite film softer by decreasing the thickness of PMMA and eliminating the baking process of PMMA. Here, we controlled the thickness of PMMA by the rotating speed of spin-coating and obtained a minimum thickness of 150 nm. In addition, we dried PMMA in air at room temperature for 30 minutes instead of baking it at 120 °C for 10 minutes.
From the J–V characteristics shown in Fig. 7a and Table 1, it can be found that great improvements have been achieved for the solar cell fabricated by process D. The PCE of sample #7 was as high as 13.5% with a Voc of 601 mV, a Jsc of 32.4 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.1%, very close to that of the reference cell (sample #1, PCE, 14.9% with Voc, 601 mV, Jsc, 32.8 mA cm−2; and FF, 74.3%). In contrast, the solar cell with 400 nm PMMA on graphene as the transparent electrode (sample #5) showed relatively poor cell performance (PCE, 10.5%; Voc, 595 mV; Jsc, 31.2 mA cm−2 and FF, 52.2%). The Rs and Rsh of graphene-based CIGS solar cell fabricated by Process D were also improved as shown in Table 2. The higher PCE for sample #7 could be attributed to the improved interface between the rough i-ZnO surface and the graphene/PMMA film, since thinner PMMA was much softer and could result in better surface contact with easy conformity. Fig. 7b displays the photo of sample #5 and sample #7 without a metal grid (the metal grid was not applied here for the precise measurement of the reflectance in Fig. 8). It is clearly shown that the color of sample #7 is darker than that of sample #5. In addition, when we put the two samples into water or scribed them to determine the active area, the graphene/PMMA TCE film of samples #5 was found to be easy to peel off the i-ZnO film, while no such phenomenon was found for sample #7, which also proves the better contact in sample #7. The high Jsc of sample #7 could also be partially attributed to the anti-reflection effect by thin PMMA according to the simulation results shown in Fig. 7c.

Compared with the CIGS solar cell with standard AZO as the TCE, though the PCE of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is slightly lower due to the lower Jsc and FF, the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is found to exhibit excellent optical and electrical properties. Firstly, due to the refractive index matching and the anti-reflection effect of graphene/PMMA films, the total reflectance of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell (sample #7) is lower than that of the standard CIGS solar cell as shown in Fig. 8. Secondly, the EQE result demonstrates the potential of utilizing the graphene film to replace AZO films as the window layer in the CIGS solar cell to improve the quantum efficiency in the NIR. As shown in Fig. 9, the dQE/dλ curves showed the function layers (ZnO, CdS, and CIGS) are the same in the graphene-based CIGS solar cell and the standard AZO-based CIGS solar cell, while the normalized EQE of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is slightly higher than that of the AZO-based CIGS solar cell in NIR, which is caused by the high transmission of the graphene TCE films in the NIR due to the low free carrier absorption loss.

It is well known that AZO is susceptible to moisture in air, while graphene possesses excellent chemical stability. Moreover, graphene is nearly impermeable to any gas and liquid, therefore it can protect the solar cell from moisture.27–29 The stability of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell was examined in air at a temperature of 25 °C and a humidity of 45%. For comparison, the reference CIGS solar cell was put in the same room and characterized under the same conditions. Fig. 3S† shows the normalized PCE of the devices after different periods. After 83 days, the loss in the PCE for the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is around 3% while for the reference CIGS solar cell is around 9%. Moreover, this passivation effect of graphene in the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is also an advantage for encapsulated CIGS solar cells. The acetic acid from the encapsulation material (EVA) is reported to be an important factor which leads to the degradation of the traditional encapsulated CIGS solar cell,30 while with graphene preventing the solar cell from acetic acid, this problem can be avoided.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the CVD grown graphene film with a thin layer of PMMA coating can efficiently serve as the transparent conducting electrode for CIGS solar cells to replace AZO. With a set of progressively improved processes to achieve better interface contact between the graphene/PMMA and i-ZnO layers, a high PCE of 13.5% has been achieved, which is remarkable for a large active area up to 45 mm2. Besides, the graphene-based CIGS solar cell exhibits excellent optical and electrical properties such as lower total reflectance and enhanced quantum efficiency in the NIR compared with the standard AZO-based CIGS solar cell. Furthermore, due to the protection of the PMMA/graphene film, the graphene-based solar cell shows better stability than the standard AZO based solar cell, and this advantage could also be meaningful for the encapsulated CIGS solar cell. With more effort in reducing the sheet resistance of graphene, higher PCE of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell is possible. Our experiments presented in this work shall be regarded as the first attempt in this direction and hopefully will attract further research in the future.
4. Experimental section
Synthesis of monolayer graphene
A graphene film was grown via low pressure CVD on 25 μm thick Cu foil (Alfa Aesar, Product no. 46365) in a quartz tube placed in a three-zone horizontal tube furnace (Lindberg/blue HTF55667C). At first, the Cu foil was treated with ethyl lactate for 1 hour and then rinsed with isopropyl and DI water. Then the Cu foil was annealed in the CVD chamber at 1035 °C for 30 minutes. After that, 2 sccm CH4 along with 30 sccm H2 were introduced for 18 minutes. Then the flow rate of CH4 was increased to 20 sccm for 2 minutes. Finally, the Cu substrate was cooled to 200 °C under CH4:H2 = 5:30 sccm.
Graphene transfer and doping technique
To transfer the as-grown graphene film, a thin layer of PMMA was spin-coated on the sample. The copper substrate was then etched away by FeCl3 solution (1 mol L−1) for 1 hour with the graphene layer on the back side of the Cu substrate removed prior in O2 plasma. To reduce the sheet resistance of graphene, the graphene/PMMA film was immersed in 20 mM AuCl3 aqueous solution for 30 s and then thoroughly washed with DI water. In the case of multilayer graphene films, a layer-by-layer transfer method was used in which the previous graphene/PMMA film was placed conformally on top of another graphene/Cu layer, followed by etching away the Cu substrate.
Fabrication of the CIGS reference solar cell
The fabrication process of the reference CIGS solar cell with the standard AZO electrode can be briefly described as follows: a 1 μm Mo back contact film was first deposited by DC-magnetron sputtering on a 2 mm thick soda-lime glass substrate at room temperature. Then, a 2–3 μm CIGS absorber layer was grown by the three-stage process using a co-evaporation deposition system. The CdS buffer layer was deposited on top of the absorber via the chemical-bath deposition method. Afterwards, a high resistivity intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) layer was deposited at room temperature in an Ar and O2 atmosphere from an intrinsic ZnO target, followed by a ∼150 nm thick AZO film deposited by RF-sputtering from an AZO target. Finally, Ni/Al/Ni metallic grids with a thickness of about 8 μm were fabricated on top of the AZO by electron beam evaporation.
Fabrication of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell with a standard structure (process A)
In process A, the AZO electrode was substituted by a graphene layer while the rest of the layers remained the same as the CIGS reference solar cell. With the graphene/PMMA film directly transferred onto the i-ZnO surface, the solar cell was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to enhance the adhesion between graphene and i-ZnO. The PMMA was subsequently dissolved in chloroform for 10 minutes. Finally, the Ni/Al/Ni top-contact grids were deposited onto the graphene film.
Fabrication of the graphene-based CIGS solar cell with PMMA as a protection and an antireflection layer (processes B, C and D)
Compared to process A, the position of the Ni/Al/Ni metal grids in processes B, C and D was changed from on top of the TCE to underneath the TCE, i.e., right on the i-ZnO surface. The graphene/PMMA layer was then directly laminated on top of Ni/Al/Ni metal grids, contacting both Ni/Al/Ni and i-ZnO. The solar cell was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to enhance the adhesion between graphene and i-ZnO or the Ni/Al/Ni metal grid. The difference between processes C and B is that the i-ZnO layer thickness in C is increased to reduce the roughness of the i-ZnO surface. Process D differs from process C by using thin PMMA.
Material and device characterization
The morphologies of the solar cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and optical microscopy (OM). The visible-IR spectra were obtained by using a spectrophotometer with a wavelength range from 300 nm to 1200 nm. The sheet resistances of the graphene films were measured via the Van Der Pauw method. The J–V measurements of the solar cells were performed under dark or with illumination of the standard AM1.5 spectrum with 100 mW cm−2 at 25 °C. The intensity of the light source of the solar simulator was calibrated with a standard single crystal Si solar cell. The EQE of the solar cells was measured with a standard system equipped with a xenon lamp, a monochromator, a Si detector, and a dual channel power meter. The active area of solar cells was determined to be 45 mm2 by mechanical scribing.
