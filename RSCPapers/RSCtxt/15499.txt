    , Accepted 3rd July 2019First published on 5th July 2019AbstractSolar steam generation by direct harvesting of light irradiation has emerged as one of most efficient technologies for utilization of solar energy and production of fresh water. Herein, we report the fabrication of a novel solar steam generation system based on a blank hollow spacer fabric (BHSF) prepared by filling spaces with chitosan and coating with reduced graphene oxide on the surface. Based on its porous textile fabric structure, with excellent thermal insulation, the modified BHSF shows better performance for water transport and mechanical properties, with a compression strength of up to 733 kPa at 70% strain and low thermal conductivity (0.08 W m−1 K−1). Under solar light power of 1 kW m−2, this solar generator gives an evaporation efficiency of 86%, which is comparable to the best performance for multilayer systems that have been reported so far. More significantly, the unique hollow structure of BHSF, with an aligned big channel array (2 mm in size), which provided additional low-tortuosity pathways, endows the modified BHSF with excellent salt-resistant properties, such as evaporation in high saline solution. Such a textile-based BHSF may hold great potential for scalable manufacture of a cost-efficient solar still with excellent mechanical flexibility, physicochemical robustness and high solar energy conversion efficiency for a variety of applications, including power generation, desalination, and steam sterilization.
Introduction
Sunlight as a natural energy has played an important role in various fields1,2 from ancient times right up to the present day.3,4 Solar-thermal technology, which enables direct harvesting of solar energy for heating and energy storage applications as a supplement or potential alternative for fossil fuel energy, has recently attracted much attention in both academia and industry.5–12 As one important way of utilizing solar energy, solar steam generation has emerged as a solar-thermal technology that can efficiently convert sunlight into heat to generate solar steam via photothermal materials. This has been the subject of both commercial and research interest, with a wide variety of potential applications, including desalination,13–15 production of fresh water,16–18 power generation,19,20 steam sterilization21,22 and so on.23–25
In traditional solar-driven evaporation systems, vapor generation relies on the absorption of solar radiation to heat bulk water to generate steam until the boiling point is reached, which leads to a larger thermal mass and unnecessary drops in temperature.26 Without optical concentration, such solar stills suffer unavoidable heat losses, from heat generation to evaporation surfaces, which in turn contribute to the relatively low evaporation efficiency. Comparatively, solar steam generation makes it possible to localize solar heat onto the surface of photothermal materials to produce steam. The photothermal materials usually have high solar energy conversion efficiency owing to both strong light absorption and highly efficient thin-layer evaporation, with low heat transportation or loss. Therefore, it is essential to exploit powerful photothermal materials with excellent light absorption, low thermal conductivity, and inter-penetrated porous structures for quick water transportation, for the construction of high-performance solar steam generation systems. So far, great efforts have been made to create a wide variety of photothermal materials, such as carbon-based materials,27–33 metallic nanoparticles,34,35 natural materials,36 porous polymers37 and biomass-based materials.38 Although significant progress has been achieved in recent years, big challenges still remain as fabrication of these photothermal materials, in most cases, has drawbacks or limitations involving high cost, complicated production processes, difficulty in amplification, etc. More seriously, salt can be precipitated from saline solution and deposited onto the photothermal materials, thus prolonging the duration of the evaporation time for solar desalination, which dramatically impairs the evaporation efficiency and practical operability for large-scale applications.
Hollow spacer fabric is a commercially available three-dimensional textile constructed with an upper and lower surface as well as a huge space with erect monofilaments. Such a unique structure combining synthetic fibers endows it with excellent mechanical strength, flexibility and better thermal insulation, and it has been employed as a promising thermal insulator for solar energy harvesting.39 Based on these merits, and according to the criteria mentioned above, such hollow spacer fabric might be an ideal candidate as a photothermal material for solar steam generation. No investigation involving the use of hollow spacer fabric for solar steam generation has been reported so far. Thus, continuing our previous studies on photothermal materials,40–43 herein we report the fabrication of a novel photothermal material by filling chitosan into the space and coating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto the surface of commercial BHSF for efficient solar steam generation. Taking advantage of the excellent light absorption, low thermal conductivity, and inter-penetrated porous structure for quick water transportation, the processed BHSF shows a high solar-thermal efficiency of ∼86% at 1 kW m−2. More interestingly, the unique hollow structure of BHSF, with an aligned big channel array (2 mm in size), provided additional low-tortuosity pathways, which endow the modified BHSF with excellent salt-resistant properties and even evaporation in high saline solution. Therefore, this material shows great potential for real applications, combining low cost, commercial availability, and a simple and scalable manufacturing process.
Experimental
Materials
BHSF was provided by Fujian Fulian Fine Editing Co., Ltd. All chemicals used were of analytical grade, were obtained from commercial sources and were used without additional purification.
Preparation of chitosan hydrogel and rGO coating

Chitosan hydrogel. 
A certain amount of chitosan (1 g) was dissolved in 0.5% acetic acid solution (80 mL) to obtain a clear and transparent viscous liquid. Glycerol with 3% mass concentration was added as plasticizer, with stirring for 2 h. The mixture was stirred continuously and 3% CaCl2 solution (2.5 ml) added as a crosslinking agent, with static degassing for 12 h.


Fabrication processes for solar desalination devices. 
BHSF was cut into suitably sized squares (3 cm × 3 cm), and then treated ultrasonically in acetone, water, and ethanol for 10 minutes, and dried at 60 °C in a dryer. The BHSF was soaked in the as-prepared chitosan solution and dried at 70 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, graphene oxide film was coated onto the surface of the BHSF and immersed in 20% hydrazine hydrate solution for 12 h.

Steam generation and solar desalination experiments
Chitosan-coated BHSF was floated onto the solution surface in a bottle. The sample was irradiated with a solar simulator and the temperature of the sample surface was recorded using an infrared camera. The solar steam performance of BHSF was measured at an ambient temperature of ca. 21 °C and at a humidity of ca. 12%. The mass loss of water was measured using an electronic analytical balance with 0.0001 g resolution. The absorber temperature was measured using a thermocouple inserted into the evaporation fabric. Thermocouples were placed at the center, to represent the temperature of a sufficiently large absorber where side effects would be negligible.
The salt-rejecting experiment for the modified BHSF was performed on a simulated seawater solution (K+ 382 mg L−1, Ca2+ 393 mg L−1, Na+ 10474 mg L−1, Mg2+ 6969 mg L−1) and 20% sodium chloride solution.
Characterization
The BHSF surface was illuminated with a solar simulator (Scientech SF300, Canada) equipped with an acrylic Fresnel lens (Greenbrier International, Canada). The longitudinal compressive stress–strain of BHSF was tested using a material testing machine with a 500 N load cell (EZ-Test, Shimadzu, Japan). Thermal conductivity values for the samples were measured with a multifunction rapid thermal conductivity tester (DRE-III, China) using the transient plane source method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra were collected using KBr discs on a Mexus 670 spectrometer, in the range 4000 to 400 cm−1. The morphologies of the BHSF (blank hollow spacer fabric) were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL, Ltd.). The temperature of the BHSF surface was observed with the assistance of an IR thermal camera (Thermal Imager TESTO 869, Testo SE & Co. KGaA, Germany). The UV-visible absorption was conducted on a Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrometer in the range 200 to 2500 nm, with an integrated sphere. Note that the integrating sphere was utilized to collect the scattered light for accurate measurement.
Results and discussion
Herein, we fabricated a novel solar steam generator (shown in Fig. 1a) which was prepared by filling chitosan into the space of BHSF and coating rGO onto the BHSF surface, as illustrated in Fig. 1. BHSF is a three-dimensional (3D) textile whose bulk space consists of pile monofilaments, and the trapped air between the upper and lower surface plays an important role in the characteristics of insolation. The monofilament acts as a support for the elastic net, but its affinity for water is not very good. Chitosan has been widely used in various industries due to its biofunctionality and compatibility with natural polymers, blood compatibility, safety, and microbial degradability. Here, we filled chitosan gel into BHSF to obtain an absorber with good water absorption. Graphene has excellent optical, electrical and mechanical properties, so we applied it to the BHSF surface to compensate for the limitation in the heated area as a result of the large pores of BHSF. Thus, we obtained a low cost and efficient solar evaporator. We placed it under 3 kW m−2 illumination and steam could be seen clearly, as shown in Fig. 1c and d.

The 3D BHSF selected had good flexibility, could bend at easily and its structure was not damaged after unfolding, which is beneficial for storage and transportation. The top and bottom sides of the BHSF are polyester, and the middle connecting filament is a polyester monofilament.44 Its thickness is 8 mm, with excellent resilience. The longitudinal compressive stress–strain of the BHSF was probed using an electrical universal material testing machine, as indicated in Fig. 2c. Three important stages can be seen on the curve, that is, linear elasticity, a collapse plateau and densification. The stress–strain curve is linear elastic when the compression is less than 17%. The second stage of the compression showed a relatively large deformation that occurs at a relatively constant stress of ca. 0.1 MPa. The monofilaments were bent and the thickness of the BHSF decreases. At this stage, the thickness decreased significantly, after all the individual monofilaments had collapsed. The stress rises rapidly and the strain is very small after this densification. As shown in Fig. 2d, the processed BHSF was up to 20 times stronger than the untreated BHSF. Based on this excellent pressure compression performance, we used the processed BHSF in a solar energy evaporation device, to ensure that the device will not be damaged when subjected to sudden compression. Moreover, the filling of chitosan does not affect the pressure compression properties and enhances the strength.

The top view of the hollow spacer fabric is shown in Fig. 3b, and large holes and array channels can be seen clearly, which are of benefit for the transportation of water.45 The monofilament between the three-dimensional intervals (Fig. 3b) acts as a support for the elastic net and helps to store air in the middle.46 The thermal conductivity of BHSF before and after treatment with chitosan was measured by a multifunction rapid thermal conductivity tester and the results are shown in Fig. 3e. It can be seen that the thermal conductivity of BHSF both before and after chitosan gel filling is similar in value, indicating that filling with chitosan gel does not significantly affect the thermal insulation effect of BHSF.

In order to obtain a solar evaporation device with excellent performance, we filled chitosan into the space of BHSF to enhance its water absorption performance, and coated graphene onto the upper surface layer to increase the light absorption area. The results of the infrared characterization of the individual substances and complexes are as follows: common peaks of the three substances are assigned in Fig. 4a, namely –OH (3420 cm−1), C–H (2924 cm−1), CC (1650–1450 cm−1), C–OH (1383 cm−1) and C–O–C (ca. 1150 cm−1). For chitosan, multiple peaks at 1300–1150 cm−1 are attributable to the superposition of C–O–C, C–C, and C–N stretching vibrations. The peak close to 667 cm−1 was assigned to the C–H bending vibration of –CH2. In the case of BHSF, the main ingredient is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), so, besides the absorption peak of the benzene ring at 1650–1450 cm−1, the spectra also show the C–H bending vibration peak on the substituted benzene ring at 727 and 669 cm−1. After combination of the three substances, there was no displacement of the characteristic peaks of each individual substance. As shown in Fig. 4b, chitosan has good water absorbency. Therefore, filling the chitosan into the BHSF space is very helpful for evaporation for solar energy efficiency, which compensates for the reduction in the heat insulation effect.

In order to observe the details of the modified BHSF more clearly, a typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) noncontact mode image of the rGO nanoplate and SEM images of the main view of BHSF were recorded, as shown in Fig. 5. The SEM images clearly show the details of the pile monofilaments of the surface, before and after treatment of BHSF. The sample of the pile monofilament exhibits a smooth fiber rod with a diameter of ca. 120 μm, while the surface of the pile monofilaments after coating with chitosan gel becomes rough, as shown in Fig. 5d. The SEM-EDM (scanning electron microscopy-element distribution map) images were measured to further investigate the surface of the modified BHSF. Compared with the untreated monofilament, the elemental distribution of the modified monofilament shows additional N elements, which demonstrates chitosan coating on the monofilament.

Taking into account the merits of processed BHSF, such as low thermal conductivity, good flexibility, hygroscopicity and apparent density, it can be used as a promising platform for solar steam generation. In this work, solar vapor generation experiments were conducted under illuminations of 1 kW m−2, 2 kW m−2 and 3 kW m−2, and a schematic diagram of the experimental and monitoring device is shown in Fig. 6a. The right side of Fig. 6a shows the different locations for temperature recording in the evaporation structure. After 60 minutes solar illumination (1 kW m−2), the water temperature below increases only slightly, due to the decrease in heat flux through the thermal insulation structure.13 The surface temperature of solar steam generation, displayed in Fig. 6b, rose sharply to 37.8 °C, 42.0 °C and 49.8 °C at a power density of 1, 2 and 3 kW m−2, respectively, in the first 5 min and then further increased to 44.1 °C, 52.4 °C and 59.2 °C within 30 min, respectively, indicating that the processed BHSF had excellent solar energy conversion efficiency performance. Meanwhile, as the density of the solar illumination increased, the maximum temperature of the processed BHSF rose significantly from 45.4 °C to 61.7 °C under 1–3 kW m−2 illumination. Fig. 6c and d shows the curves for time-dependent temperature change. It can be clearly seen that there is a distinct temperature increase within the initial 5 min, and then the rising trend of temperature tends to be balanced as time goes on. It is worth noting that the difference between the bulk water temperature and the surface temperature of the insulation is close to 20 °C (Fig. 6d), which indicates that our device can concentrate heat around itself for evaporating water.

(c) Temperature change of BHSF surface under different illumination. (d) Temperature change of different locations of bulk water under one sun illumination shown in (d). 

Fig. 7a illustrates that the amount of water evaporated increased with increasing solar radiation. After subtracting the dark evaporation rate of pure water from all measured evaporation rates, the evaporation rates calculated from the slope of the time-dependent mass change curves were 1.4352 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2, 2.1954 kg m−2 h−1 under 2 kW m−2, and 3.1446 kg m−2 h−1 under 3 kW m−2 for the processed BHSF solar receiver, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7b. Of course, the high evaporation efficiency is attributed not only to the hydrophilicity of the solar receiver, but also to the absorption of light. It can also be seen that the evaporation efficiency of untreated BHSF is only 64% at one sun illumination, while the evaporation efficiency of the processed BHSF can reach 86% under the same conditions. Detailed calculation of the energy conversion efficiency is presented in the ESI.†47Fig. 7c shows the light absorption of BHSF before and after treatment. Both samples have good light absorption across 200–2500 nm. Interestingly, BHSF has better absorbance before treatment, but the light absorption area is greatly reduced when applied to solar evaporation due to the large gap, thus giving a lower evaporation efficiency. Fig. 7c also shows a schematic diagram of the material produced by the sun in seawater. As shown in Fig. 7d, the evaporation efficiency is relatively stable after five cycles, indicating the excellent stability of the desalination plant, the images show that the material remains basically unchanged before and after the cycle, which also proves the excellent stability of the desalination.

To further investigate the seawater desalination ability of processed BHSF, we simulated seawater to explore the evaporation performance of processed BHSF under one sun irradiation for 60 min. As illustrated in Fig. 8a, compared with pure water, the quality of the seawater and high concentration brine is basically unchanged, implying a similar evaporation rate and efficiency (Fig. 8b). This also indicates the better salt-resistant ability of the modified BHSF, even at high salt concentration. It should be noted that, in most cases, salt can be precipitated from saline solution and deposited on the photothermal materials, thus prolonging the evaporation duration time, which dramatically impairs the evaporation efficiency.48,49 Therefore, the development of photothermal materials with better salt-resistant properties, or much more stable evaporation efficiency in terms of saline solution, is essential for practical applications. In fact, many photothermal materials suffer poor salt resistance, although they usually have remarkably high evaporation efficiency in pure water.50 To investigate the salt-resistant performance of the BHSF, a saline solution with 20% NaCl concentration was used for the solar evaporation test. For comparison purposes, we also prepared a dark ink-coated filter paper as a control photothermal material.

(d) Concentrations of four primary ions in simulated seawater before desalination, and the concentration of fresh water obtained by condensing steam. The dashed colored lines refer to the WHO standards for drinkable water. (e) Multidirectional mass transfer in the evaporator. 
The photographs of both BHSF and dark ink-coated filter paper used for the solar evaporation test at different times are shown in Fig. 8c. It is clear that a quantity of white crystalline NaCl appeared in the margin of the dark ink-coated filter paper, while almost no solid salt can be observed on the surface of BHSF after 60 min under 1 sun irradiation, indicating a better salt-resistant performance. Fig. 8d shows that the concentrations of the four primary ions, K+, Ca2+, Na+ and Mg2+, decrease from initial values of 382, 393, 10474 and 6969 mg L−1 in simulated seawater, to 1.85, 0.74, 0.94 and 0.17 mg L−1, respectively, in the fresh water produced. These ion concentrations are much lower than the standard for drinking water,51,52 indicating that our BHSF-based solar steam generation system has good desalination ability. The results could be attributed to the unique hollow structure of BHSF with an aligned big channel array (2 mm in size), which provides additional low-tortuosity pathways with different hydraulic conductivities, in addition to the porous fiber cluster of BHSF, as shown in Fig. 8e. Thus, the water flux in the aligned big channel array is higher than for the small-sized pores or channels of dark ink-coated filter paper. This, in turn, results in a faster salt exchange between the aligned channel array and the bulk solution and facilitates the increased salt concentration in the aligned channel array being transferred back to the bulk solution.45,53,54 As a result, the salt-resistant property of BHSF could be significantly improved, which may be of great technological importance for practical desalination or fresh water production.
Conclusions
In summary, we report the fabrication of a novel solar steam generation system based on BHSF, which was prepared by filling chitosan into the space and coating rGO onto the surface. Based on its porous textile fabric structure, with excellent thermal insulation, the modified BHSF shows better performance for water transport and mechanical properties, with a compression strength up to 20 times stronger than that of untreated BHSF. The compression strength was up to 733 kPa at 70% strain with low thermal conductivity (0.08 W m−1 K−1). Under solar light power of 1 kW m−2, our system gives an evaporation efficiency of 86%, which is comparable to the best performance of multilayer systems reported in previous studies. More importantly, the unique hollow structure of BHSF, with an aligned big channel array (2 mm in size), which provided additional low-tortuosity pathways, endows the modified BHSF with excellent salt-resistant properties, even for evaporation in high saline solution. Thus, this system has great potential for real applications, in combination with its low cost, commercial availability, and simple and scalable manufacturing process.
