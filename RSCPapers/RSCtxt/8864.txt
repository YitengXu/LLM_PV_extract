    , Accepted 2nd April 2014First published on 3rd April 2014AbstractThe Pr3+ and Yb3+ codoped β-NaLuF4 hexagonal nanoplates with a size of 250 nm × 110 nm were synthesized by a solvothermal process. X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the crystal structure and morphology of the materials. The visible and near infrared spectra as well as the decay curves of Pr3+:3P0 level were used to demonstrate the energy transfer from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions. The downconversion phenomenon has been observed under the direct excitation of the 3P2 level of Pr3+. According to the analysis of the dependence of the initial transfer rate upon Yb3+ ion concentration, it indicates that the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions is only by a two-step ET process when the Yb3+ concentration is very low; however, with the increase of the Yb3+ concentration, a cooperative ET process occurs and gradually increases; when the Yb3+ ion concentration increases to 20 mol%, the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions occurs only by the cooperative ET process. When the doping concentration of Yb3+ ions reaches 20 mol% at a fixed concentration of Pr3+ ions (1 mol%), the theoretical quantum efficiency is 192.2%, close to the limit of 200%. The current research has great potential in improving the conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells.
Introduction
Among the green energies, solar power is one of the most sustainable energies due to its abundance and renewability. At present, the best commercial solar cells based on single-crystal silicon have an efficiency of only 18%.1 Such a low efficiency is caused by the spectrum mismatch between the solar spectrum and the response spectrum of silicon solar cells.2,3 The solar spectrum spectral distribution covers from 300 nm to 2500 nm.4 However, the available absorption band is around 500–1100 nm for the silicon solar cell.5,6 For wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, the external quantum efficiency of silicon solar cells decreases significantly due to higher reflection and absorption by the antireflection coatings optimized for longer wavelength and due to increased emitter recombination caused by the high P-doping levels. Meanwhile, for wavelengths longer than 1100 nm, the excess energy is lost as heat to cause the excessive heating of conduction band electrons. Thus it can be seen that the current silicon solar cells only utilize a relatively small fraction of the solar spectrum. In order to increase the efficiency of silicon solar cells, the range of the available wavelength for silicon solar cells should be widened to reduce the spectral mismatch losses. Downconversion (DC) is considered as a promising method to solve the problem. Through the DC process, a high energy photon with a wavelength shorter than 500 nm can be divided into two or more low energy photons with the wavelength available for absorption of silicon solar cells.7
Recently, trivalent rare earth ion doped fluoride DC nanoparticles have attracted more and more attention. DC has been realized with Er3+/Yb3+, Pr3+/Yb3+, Ce3+/Yb3+, Tb3+/Yb3+ and Ho3+/Yb3+ couples to convert visible photons into near-infrared (NIR) photons.8–12 It is interesting that Yb3+ is chosen as an acceptor in almost all of the DC couples. This is because the Yb3+ ion has an only excited state approximately 10000 cm−1 just above the band edge of crystalline silicon. Nowadays, the luminescence properties of Pr3+ doped phosphors are of considerable interest because of its special energy configuration and the energy match between Pr3+ and Yb3+. Zhang et al. have reported the excellent DC luminescence properties of β-NaYF4: Pr3+, Yb3+ microcrystal with a maximum quantum efficiency of 181.6%.13
β-NaLuF4 is an efficient UC host material with the same crystalline phase as β-NaYF4. Recently, Qin et al. have found that β-NaLuF4 is an excellent host for phosphors with efficient UC luminescence properties.14 But beyond that, it also shows good performance in DC, as reported for the bright green emitting β-NaLuF4: Tb3+, β-NaLuF4: Ce3+/Tb3+ and NIR emitting β-NaLuF4: Er3+, Yb3+ with high quantum efficiency.15,16
In the current work, we present the efficient NIR DC in β-NaLuF4: Pr3+/Yb3+ nanocrystals (NCs) which, as far as we know, have not been reported before. The dependences of Yb3+ concentration on the visible and NIR emission spectra, decay time, and energy transfer (ET) efficiency have been investigated in detail. The mechanism of the DC process has been discussed. Results show that β-NaLuF4 NCs are excellent hosts for DC and promising materials for application in solar cells.
Experimental
Chemicals
NaOH, NH4F, HCl, methanol and ethanol were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company. Hexane was obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Reagent Company. Lanthanide (Ln) oxides of SpecPure grade (Yb2O3, Pr6O11, Lu2O3, 99.99%), were purchased from Yangkou state-run rare earth company. 1-Octadecene (ODE, 90%) and oleic acid (OA, 90%) were supplied by Alfa Aesar. All of the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. LnCl3 was prepared by dissolving the corresponding lanthanide oxides in hydrochloric acid at an elevated temperature followed by evaporating the water under vacuum conditions.
Preparation of β-NaLuF4 NCs
All of the doping ratios of Ln3+ are molar in our experiments. In a typical procedure for the synthesis of β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ (x = 0, 1, 5, 10, 20), 1 mmol RECl3 were added to a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask containing ODE (15 mL) and OA (6 mL). The solution was magnetically stirred and heated to 140 °C for 30 min to form the lanthanide oleate complexes and remove residual water and oxygen. The temperature was then cooled to 50 °C with a gentle flow of argon gas through the reaction flask. Meanwhile, a solution of NH4F (4 mmol) and NaOH (2.5 mmol) dissolved in methanol (10 mL) was added to the flask and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min to evaporate methanol from the reaction mixture. The temperature was then increased to 300 °C in an argon atmosphere for 90 min and then naturally cooled to room temperature. The resultant solid state products were precipitated by the addition of ethanol, collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times, and finally redispersed in cyclohexane.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) on a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer equipped with a linear position-sensitive detector (PSD-50 m, M. Braun), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a step size of 0.01° (2θ) in the range of 10°–70°. The morphology was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800). The excitation and emission spectra were measured using a FLS920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments, U.K.). In fluorescence lifetime measurements, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) was used as an excitation source, and the signals were detected using a Tektronix digital oscilloscope (TDS 3052). The lifetimes were calculated by integrating the area under the corresponding lifetime curves with the normalized initial intensity.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures and the phase purity of the as-prepared products were examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The positions and relative intensity of the diffraction peaks for β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ (x = 0, 1, 5, 10, 20) can be indexed well to the standard cards of the β-NaLuF4 (JCPDS 27-0726). No second phase is detected in all XRD patterns, demonstrating that Pr3+ and Yb3+ substitutions for Lu3+ sites have no effect on the phase structure of the β-NaLuF4 host. SEM was used to evaluate the morphology of the prepared NCs. Fig. 1(b–f) shows the SEM images of β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ NCs. The samples doped with different concentrations of Yb3+ ions exhibit the same morphology, displaying uniform hexagonal nanoplates with a size of 250 nm × 110 nm.

In order to investigate the DC properties of Pr3+ and Yb3+ codoped β-NaLuF4 NCs, the excitation and emission spectra of the samples, which are the direct evidence of Pr3+ → Yb3+ ET, were measured and are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. For monitoring Pr3+:3P0 → 3H6 at 608 nm, the excitation spectrum consists of three bands centered at 443 nm, 467 nm and 482 nm, which are assigned to Pr3+:3H4 → 3P2, 3H4 → 3P1, 1I6 and 3H4 → 3P0, respectively. While, the three excitation bands of Pr3+ ions are also observed by monitoring Yb3+:2F5/2 → 2F7/2 infrared emissions at 985 nm, which indicates the presence of ET from Pr3+ to Yb3+.

 Fig. 3  Visible and NIR emission spectra of the samples doped with various concentrations of Yb3+ under 443 nm excitation. 
The emission spectra covering the visible and near infrared spectral range for samples with a fixed Pr3+ concentration at 1 mol% and various concentrations of Yb3+ are presented under 443 nm excitation corresponding to Pr3+:3H4 → 3P2 transition. For the range from 600 nm to 650 nm, the spectra exhibit two emissions peaked around 608 nm and 640 nm, which are assigned to the 3P0 → 3H6 transition and 3P0 → 3F2 transition of Pr3+, respectively. In the NIR region, a strong emission band around 985 nm is observed for the Pr3+ and Yb3+ codoped samples, which is assigned to Yb3+:2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition. The phenomenon of NIR emission of Yb3+ under the direct excitation of the 3P2 level of Pr3+ is another evidence for ET from Pr3+ to Yb3+.
It is noticed that the intensity of the 3P0 → 3H6 transition and 3P0 → 3F2 transition of Pr3+ is reduced with the increased Yb3+ ion concentration. In the meantime, the intensity of the NIR emission of Yb3+ is firstly increased and then decreased when the Yb3+ concentration over 5%. It is also a proof of ET from Pr3+ to Yb3+. Additionally, the obvious decrease of the NIR emission intensity when the Yb3+ concentration reaches 10 mol% is due to the concentration quenching. In the present material, 5 mol% represents the optimal Yb3+ doped concentration.
To understand the DC mechanism more clearly, the schematic energy level diagram with the involved ET process is depicted in Fig. 4. Upon excitation by 443 nm wavelength, the Pr3+ ion in the ground state 3H4 is excited to the 3P2 level. From the 3P2 level the ion relaxes to the 3P0 level by nonradiative relaxation processes induced by the narrow energy gap between the 3P2 and 3P0 multiplets. The Pr3+:3H4 → 3P0 transition is located at approximately twice the energy of the Yb3+:2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition and the Pr3+:3H4 → 1G4 transition is located at approximately the same position of the energy of the Yb3+:2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition. In addition, Yb3+ has no other levels up to the UV region. Thus, the ET from the Pr3+ ion in the 3P0 level to Yb3+ ions has two possible routes: (1) two-step ET, as shown in Fig. 4(a): the first ET step involves the transfer of energy of the Pr3+ ion in the 3P0 level to one Yb3+ ion through cross relaxation [3P0 (Pr3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 1G4 (Pr3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+)]; next, the second ET step involves the de-excitation of the Pr3+ ion in the 1G4 level to the ground state which then transfers its energy to another Yb3+ ion [1G4 (Pr3+) + 2F7/2 (Yb3+) → 3H4 (Pr3+) + 2F5/2 (Yb3+)]. (2) Cooperative ET, as shown in Fig. 4(b): the Pr3+ ion in the 3P0 level transfers its energy to two Yb3+ ions simultaneously and then the Yb3+ ions are excited to the 2F5/2 level.
 Fig. 4  Schematic energy level diagram of Pr3+ and Yb3+ with the involved ET process. 
To judge the process of the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions, we analyzed the dependence of the initial transfer rate upon Yb3+ ion concentration. For the first step of the two-step ET process, the Pr3+ ion in the 3P0 level transfers its energy to only one Yb3+ ion. Thus the transfer rate from a donor (Pr3+) at site 0 to an acceptor (Yb3+) at site i in the surroundings (i ≠ 0) can be written as X0i = xf(R0i)X0.(1)
Here x is the concentration of the acceptor and thus the probability of an acceptor at site i is x; f(R0i) is a function of the distance, R0i is the distance from the donor at site 0 to the acceptor at site i; X0 is the radiative decay rate of the 3P0 state of Pr3+ in β-NaLuF4. Consequently, for all Yb3+ neighbors at distances R0i, the initial transfer rate can be taken as (2)
This leads to 〈X0〉CR ∝ x.(3)
For the cooperative ET, the donor transfers its energy simultaneously to two acceptors adjacent to itself at site i and j (i < j) respectively. Refer to eqn (1), then the transfer rate from the donor to a pair (i, j) of acceptors is X0(i,j) = x2f(R0i)f(R0j)X02.(4)
For all the pairs (i, j) of acceptors, the initial transfer rate is (5)
This leads to 〈X0〉COOP ∝ x2.(6)
So it can be concluded that eqn (3) approximately fits for the two-step ET process and eqn (6) approximately fits for the cooperative ET process.
At present, we need to get the values of the initial transfer rate. Fig. 5 shows the decay curves of Pr3+:3P0 level in the initial period of 8 μs. The initial transfer rates were obtained by the slopes of the curves from the maximum intensity to 70% of the maximum intensity. To be specific, the initial transfer rates equal the slopes of the curves of Pr3+ and Yb3+ codoped samples minus the slope of the curve of Pr3+ singly doped sample. In this way, we obtained the Yb3+ ion concentration dependence of the initial transfer rates and plotted in a double logarithmic diagram, as shown in Fig. 6. When the concentration of Yb3+ ions changes from 1 mol% to 10 mol%, the slope n1 value is 1.3, indicating that the two-step ET process and the cooperative ET process coexist simultaneously but the two-step ET process is dominant. When the concentration of Yb3+ ions increases to 20 mol%, the slope n2 value is 2, indicating that the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions is only by the cooperative ET process. On the basis of above data and analysis, we propose that the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions is only by the two-step ET process when the Yb3+ concentration is very low; however, with the increase of the Yb3+ concentration, the cooperative ET process occurs and gradually increases; when the Yb3+ ion concentration increases to 20 mol%, the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions is only by the cooperative ET process.

 Fig. 6  Plot (log–log) of the initial transfer rate versus the Yb3+ concentration in β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ NCs. 

Fig. 7 shows the decay curves of Pr3+:3P0 level in β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ (x = 0, 1, 5, 10, 20) NCs. With increasing Yb3+ concentration, the decay of the 3P0 level of Pr3+ rapidly speeds up, which can be explained by the existence of extra decay pathways due to the Yb3+ doping: ET from the 3P0 level of Pr3+ to the 2F5/2 level of Yb3+ accelerates the decay rate of the 3P0 level of Pr3+. All decay curves exhibit nonexponential characteristics. For the Pr3+ singly doped sample, it is due to cross relaxation between Pr3+ ions. For the Pr3+ and Yb3+ codoped samples, it is attributed to the variation in distribution of Yb3+ ions around the Pr3+ ion, leading to a variety of ET rates.
 Fig. 7  Decay curves of Pr3+:3P0 level in β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/x% Yb3+ NCs (λEX = 482 nm, λEM = 608 nm). Inset, decay time and ηETE as functions of Yb3+ concentration. 
The decay time τ is calculated by (7)where I(t) is the luminescence intensity as a function of time t and I(0) represents the initial intensity at t = 0. The energy transfer efficiency (ηETE) and theoretical quantum efficiency (ηTQE) can be determined from decay curves. The ηETE is defined as the ratio of Pr3+ depopulated by ET to Yb3+ over the total number of the Pr3+ excited. By dividing the integrated intensity of the decay curve of Pr3+ and the Yb3+ codoped sample by that of the Pr3+ single doped one, the ηETE is obtained as a function of Yb3+ concentration (8)where τx%Yb represents the decay time of Pr3+:3P0 level with various concentrations of Yb3+. For the samples doped with x mol% Yb3+ ions (x = 1, 5, 10), the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions occurs in two ways (the two-step ET process and the cooperative ET process) and the proportion of the two processes cannot be obtained, so the theoretical quantum efficiency cannot be calculated. However, for the sample doped with 20 mol% Yb3+ ions, the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions occurs only by the cooperative ET process. That is to say, in the sample doped with 20 mol% Yb3+ ions, two infrared photons (around 985 nm) are emitted by Yb3+ ions per absorbed one blue photon (around 482 nm) by Pr3+ ions in theory. The ηTQE of this sample, defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons that are absorbed, can be obtained as ηTQE,x%Yb = ηPr(1 − ηETE,x%Yb) + 2ηYb(ηETE,x%Yb),(9)where ηPr and ηYb represent the quantum efficiencies of Pr3+ and Yb3+ ions, respectively.17 They are set to 1, assuming that all excited ions decay radiatively.18 This assumption leads to an upper limit of the quantum efficiency. The τ and ηETE are listed in the inset of Fig. 7 according to the formulas mentioned above. With the increase of Yb3+ concentration from 1% to 20%, the ηETE increases obviously from 16.4% to 92.2%. For the β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/20% Yb3+ NCs, ηTQE reaches 192.2%, close to the limit of 200%.
Conclusions
In summary, we conclude that an efficient NIR DC in β-NaLuF4: Pr3+/Yb3+ NC has been demonstrated and the mechanism of the DC process has been investigated carefully. On the basis of the analysis of the dependence of the initial transfer rate upon Yb3+ ion concentration, we propose that the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions occurs only by the two-step ET process when the Yb3+ concentration is very low; however, with the increase of the Yb3+ concentration, the cooperative ET process occurs and gradually increases; when the Yb3+ ion concentration increases to 20 mol%, the ET from Pr3+ ions to Yb3+ ions occurs only by the cooperative ET process. For the β-NaLuF4: 1% Pr3+/20% Yb3+ NCs, the theoretical quantum efficiency (ηTQE) reaches 192.2%, close to the limit of 200%. The current experiment results indicate that β-NaLuF4: Pr3+/Yb3+ NCs are promising DC materials for application in solar cells.
