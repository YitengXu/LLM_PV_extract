    , Accepted 15th October 2014First published on 16th October 2014AbstractPursuing a high power conversion efficiency with no sacrifice of cost-effectiveness has been a persistent objective for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). One promising solution to this impasse is increased light harvesting. Previous efforts in light harvesting have been made on setting blocking layers or reflecting layers, or adding a light harvester, resulting in tedious procedures without reducing the expenses. We present a mild solution strategy for synthesizing transparent Ru–Se alloy counter electrodes (CEs) for bifacial DSSC applications, displaying optimal front and rear efficiencies of 8.76% and 5.90%, respectively. In comparison with pristine Pt-based solar cells, the maximum power output has also been markedly enhanced. Moreover, fast start-up, high multiple start capability, and good stability are observed in the bifacial DSSCs with transparent Ru–Se binary alloy electrodes. The impressive efficiencies along with simple preparation of the cost-effective Ru–Se alloy CEs demonstrates their potential application in robust DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Utilization of solar energy has been one of the promising solutions to energy depletion, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction.1 Among various modes of solar energy conversion, photovoltaic techniques are the most efficient approach. In comparison with commercial silicon solar cells,2,3 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) display attractive merits of easy fabrication, zero emission, and cost-effectiveness.4–8 So far, the best efficiency of 12.3% has been measured for a DSSC device comprised of a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)-based redox electrolyte, platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE), and zinc porphyrin dye-sensitized TiO2 anode.9 A previous conversion efficiency of 11.1% has also been certified by Han et al. by sandwiching the liquid electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple between a black dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Pt CE.10 However, in other reports, the light-to-electric conversion efficiencies of liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs are always lower than 10%.11–13 All of these measurements originate from front irradiation (irradiated from side of TiO2 anode). Because of an excessive loss of incident light within the dye-sensitized TiO2 film, the irradiation and therefore excitation of dye molecules are incomplete, resulting in a low electron density on the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 nanocrystallite.14,15 Therefore, it is not surprising that a much lower efficiency than the theoretical value is determined. Recently, a pioneering bifacial concept, developed by Grätzel, was considered as a promising approach in elevating the electricity generation and reducing the cost of solar energy conversion.16,17 Although there are follow-up studies on bifacial DSSCs irradiated either from front-side or rear-side,18–20 the dilemma of modest rear efficiency and low maximum power output (Pmax) has been unchanged. Inspired by the bifacial silicon solar cells,21 in which front and rear irradiations are both applied in a cell, front efficiency of 17.0%, a rear efficiency of 7.1% and a total efficiency of 24.0% are generated (front: 100 mW cm−2; rear: 42 mW cm−2). We suppose that when the DSSC device is simultaneously irradiated from both front- and rear-sides, the incident light from the CE will compensate for the loss of light from the TiO2 anode, leading to a markedly enhanced dye excitation and consequentially Pmax.22 Therefore, the selection of CE materials seems to be crucial for the penetrating incident light. Traditional Pt and its composites show strong light reflection because of their metallic luster, yielding high optical loss. Although some alternative CEs from graphene or polyaniline are transparent or semi-transparent in the visible-light region, their stabilities and catalytic activities are still unsatisfactory.23
In the current study, we report a mild solution approach for synthesizing transparent ruthenium–selenide (Ru–Se) alloys on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates with the aim of increasing rear efficiency and Pmax of DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on transparent Ru–Se alloy CEs for bifacial DSSC applications. More recently, Au–Ag binary alloys have been employed as CE materials in DSSC devices, demonstrating an optimal conversion efficiency of 7.85%.24 We have also developed Co–Pt alloys using an electrochemical co-deposition method, generating a front efficiency as high as 10.23% in the cells.25,26 Although the research on alloy CEs is at a preliminary stage, the promising properties especially the high transparency in the visible-light region highlight the potential application in bifacial DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of Ru–Se alloy CEs
The feasibility of synthesizing Ru–Se alloy CEs was confirmed using the following experimental procedure: A mixed aqueous solution consisting of Se powder, RuCl3, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at stoichiometric ratios was made by agitating Se ultrafine powder (0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, and 0.01 g), 5 ml of 5 mM RuCl3 aqueous solution, and 1 ml of pure PVP at 60 °C. The total volume of the reagent solution was adjusted to 38 ml by adding deionized water. 2 ml of hydrazine hydrate (85 wt%) was dropped into the above solution. After vigorous agitation for 15 min, the reactant was transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and the clean FTO glass substrate (sheet resistance 12 Ω sq−1, purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA), with the FTO layer facing downward, was immersed in the solution. After the reaction at 120 °C for 12 h, the FTO substrate was rinsed using deionized water and vacuum dried at 50 °C. As references, the pure Se and Ru CEs were also prepared according to the above approach with a Se dosage of 0.004 g or a RuCl3 dosage of 5 ml. The Pt CE was purchased from Dalian HepatChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd and used as a standard.
2.2 Cell assembly and measurements
A TiO2 film on an FTO glass substrate with a thickness of 10 μm and an active area of 0.25 cm2 was prepared according to our previous reports.14,15 The resultant TiO2 film was sensitized by immersing it in a 0.50 mM ethanol solution of N719 dye (purchased from DYESOL LTD) for 24 h. A DSSC device was fabricated by sandwiching the redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Ru–Se alloy CE. The liquid electrolyte in this study was a mixture containing 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2 and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile.
The photovoltaic performances were characterized when the cell devices were irradiated from either front, rear or both sides. A simulator with a 100 W xenon arc lamp under ambient atmosphere was used as the light source. A self-designed light-splitting device with a silver mirror coated inner surface was employed to split the incident light into two beams. Both of the incident light intensities were controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell) by adjusting the working current. A black mask with an aperture area of around 0.25 cm2 was applied on the surface of the DSSCs to avoid stray light. Each photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve was measured at least five times and a compensating curve was utilized.
2.3 Characterization
Optical transmission spectra of the resultant CEs were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the resultant alloys were recorded using an X-ray powder diffractometer (X'pert MPD Pro, Philips, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å) in the 2θ range from 20 to 60° operating at 40 kV (accelerating voltage) and 40 mA (current). The morphologies were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-3500N, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010, JEOL).
3. Results and discussion
The resultant CEs were subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, as shown in Fig. 1a. The peak positions can be indexed well to Ru–Se alloys (Pa3(205), PDF# 03-1198). Some diffraction peaks corresponding to unreacted Se and Ru are also detected. Ru is a typical transition metal, having unfilled valences in the 4d orbitals. Therefore, by alloying Ru with Se, Ru can accept electrons to form coordinated intermediates, which is a prerequisite for robust CE materials. To realize the bifacial irradiation from both front and rear sides, high optical transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions is crucial for designing such peculiar bifacial DSSCs. The optical transmission spectra in Fig. 1b reveal high optical transparency (>∼60% in the visible region) for the resultant CEs. As a reference, the standard Pt electrode has a transparency of only ∼20% because of light reflection on the glossy surface.

The top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photograph in Fig. 2a suggests a high surface coverage of the Ru0.33Se alloy on the FTO substrate. Deeper examination shows a homogeneously nanoporous structure with an average pore size of ∼100 nm. As shown in Fig. 2b, the porous structure provides a large surface area and facile channels for I−/I3− species transportation.

The low-resolution transmission electron micrograph in Fig. 3a demonstrates a loose structure for the Ru0.33Se alloy, providing a large active surface for I3− diffusion and therefore accelerating the reduction reaction of I3− → I−. From the high-resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 3b, lattice fringes are clearly observed, indicating that the resultant Ru0.33Se alloy has a good crystallinity. Moreover, lots of lattice distortions are observed in the crystal lattices. This result indicates that alloying of Ru with Se can form defects, which provide active sites for I3− adsorption and reduction.

Fig. 4a shows J–V curves of the DSSCs using the Ru–Se alloys, Pt, Se, and Ru as CE materials. The detailed photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. The cell with the Ru0.33Se alloy CE yields an optimal front efficiency of 8.76%, Jsc of 17.86 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.722 V, and FF of 67.9%, which are much higher than the values of the pure Pt, Se and Ru electrodes. The results demonstrate that alloying with Se may effectively tune the electron structure of Ru and result in favorable electronic perturbation. A similar synergistic effect has been found widely in CoPt and NiPt alloys for fuel cell applications.27,28Fig. 4b shows the characteristic J–V curves of the devices applying rear irradiation; all the photovoltaic parameters including η, Jsc, Voc, and FF are lower than those received for front irradiation, and a maximum rear-efficiency of 5.90% is measured for the cell with the Ru0.33Se electrode. However, the rear-efficiency is much higher than 3.56% for the cell with a pristine Pt electrode. Jsc is highly dependent on the accumulative electron density on the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 injected with excited dyes. As shown in Fig. S1,† the incident light intensity for the illumination of adsorbed dyes is decreased step by step (viewed from anode to CE) under front irradiation, leading to reduced electron distribution. In the process of transportation through the TiO2 nanocrystallite network, the electrons will suffer longer lengths under rear irradiation in comparison with that under the front irradiation. The average electron may experience a million trapping events before percolating to the collecting FTO electrode.29 Therefore, the electron density on the CB of TiO2 and consequentially Jsc are granted as higher applying front-side irradiation. Moreover, the maximum Voc is determined by the difference between the quasi Fermi energy of the electrons in TiO2 and the redox potential energy of the electrolyte,30 whereas the real Voc of a DSSC device is generally smaller than the theoretical limit; a main reason is the backward reaction between dye molecules and electrolyte.31 The recombination of electrons by front irradiation with the oxidizing species, predominantly I3− in the electrolyte, can be effectively restricted, giving an elevated Voc. From the computational formula η (%) = Pmax/Pin × 100%, one can see that Pin (the incident light power) should be 200 mW cm−2. Surprisingly, the Pmax values of all devices have been markedly increased by two-side irradiation, an impressive Pmax of 12.72 mW cm−2 is measured for the DSSC with the Ru0.33Se alloy CE in comparison with 8.78 mW cm−2 for the pristine Pt-based solar cell, as shown in Fig. 4c. Statistical data for a larger batch of five bifacial DSSCs is shown in Fig. S2.† From a compromised η of 6.36 ± 5% with a small standard deviation, we infer that DSSCs with promising photovoltaic performance and high reproducibility can be realized using the method reported here.

To determine the catalytic activity of the CEs, comprised of the alloys, Se, Ru, or Pt, toward the I−/I3− redox couple, cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As plotted in Fig. S3a,† two pairs of redox peaks corresponding to interconversion reactions between the I− and I3− species are observed, along with similar shapes and peak positions compared to those of the pure Pt electrode,32 indicating catalytic behavior of the resultant Ru–Se alloy CEs in the liquid electrolyte. With respect to the function of the CEs, the peak current density of Red1 and peak-to-peak separation (Epp) between Red1 and Ox1 are key parameters for assessing the catalytic activity.33,34 All the alloy CEs have a higher peak current density for Red1 than that of the pure Pt electrode. Among six alloy CEs, Ru0.33Se has the highest current density. Moreover, the Epp of the Ru–Se alloy CEs (ca. 48.32 mV) is significantly smaller than 63.40 mV of the Pt electrode, suggesting that the overpotential losses of the Ru–Se alloy CEs are lower than that of the pure Pt CE in DSSCs. Moreover, we compare the Bode electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of symmetric dummy cells from various CEs, and the lifetimes of the electrons on the CEs are calculated. Once the electrons migrate from the external circuit to a CE layer, they participate in the reduction of the I3− species, therefore, the average lifetime of the electrons can be employed to compare the reaction kinetics of Red1. From Fig. S4 and Table S1,† the Ru0.33Se alloy exhibits a lifetime of 8.94 μs, which, in comparison, is shorter than those of the other alloys and the Pt electrode (85.11 μs). A higher peak current density, lower Epp, and shorter electron lifetime demonstrate that the Ru0.33Se alloy electrode presents a superior catalytic activity in reducing I3−, which is a prerequisite for a robust CE in efficient DSSCs. From the stacked CV curves of the Ru0.33Se alloy electrode, as shown in ESI Fig. S3b,† we can make a conclusion that the cathodic and anodic reactions are diffusion-limited for the I3− transportation due to the linear relationship between the square root of the scanning rate and peak current density (ESI Fig. S3c†). The results account for the fact that the diffusion layer becomes thinner and the electrochemical polarization degree is larger at an elevated scan rate, therefore leading to an increasing overpotential and poor reversibility.35
Nyquist EIS plots of the symmetric dummy cells using two identical CEs are presented to demonstrate the intrinsic interfacial charge-transfer kinetics at the CE/electrolyte interface. As presented in Fig. 5a, the Rct value of the Ru0.33Se alloy CE is 2.77 Ω cm2, smaller than that of 7.23 Ω cm2 for the pure Pt electrode (Table S1†). Compared with the Pt electrode, the Ru–Se alloy CEs have lower Rct values, which follow the order Ru0.33Se < Ru0.5Se < Ru0.25Se < Ru0.2Se < RuSe < Ru2Se < Pt < Se < Ru. The sequence is consistent with the results of the CV curves. Enhanced electrocatalytic kinetics and the charge-transfer ability could accelerate dye regeneration and therefore increase Jsc of the cells. Fig. 5b displays the Tafel polarization curves measured for the symmetrical cells for further elucidating the catalytic activity of the CEs. The slopes for the anodic or cathodic branches are in the order of Ru0.33Se > Ru0.5Se > Ru0.25Se > Ru0.2Se > RuSe > Ru2Se > Pt > Se > Ru. A larger slope in the anodic or cathodic branch indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) of the CE, resulting from high alloy loading and the porous structure. J0 can be calculated using an equation related to Rct:36J0 = RT/nFRct, where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday's constant, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from the EIS plots. Apparently, the calculated Rct values follow the same order compared to the results in the EIS analysis. Additionally, the intersection of the cathodic branch with the Y-axis shows the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), a parameter that depends on the diffusion coefficient of the I−/I3− redox couple. The diffusion coefficient (Dn) of the redox species is in a linear relationship with Jlim:37Dn = lJlim/2nFC, where l is the distance between the electrodes in a symmetric dummy cell, C is the concentration of the I3− ions, n is the number of electrons involved in the I3− reduction reaction. Apparently, both Jlim and Dn follow the order Ru0.33Se > Ru0.5Se > Ru0.25Se > Ru0.2Se > RuSe > Ru2Se > Pt > Se > Ru. Alternatively, Dn can also be described using the Randles–Sevcik theory:38Jred = Kn1.5ACDn0.5v0.5, where Jred is the peak current density for Red1, K is a constant, n is the number of electrons participating in I3− + 2e → 3I3−, A is the active area of a dummy cell, and v is the scan rate for the CV curves. As shown in Fig. S3a,† the obtained Dn of the CV measurement is in good agreement with that of the Tafel analysis.

Critical requirements for engines and vehicles driven by solar panels are high power conversion efficiency, cost-effectiveness, fast start-up, multiple start capability, and operational stability. The efficiency and expenses greatly depend on the design of the CEs, in which Pt-free or low-Pt materials are always required. However, a robust catalyst in the CE is desirable for fast start-ups, multiple starts, and stability.39–41 As shown in Fig. 6a, the photocurrent of the cell device employing the Ru0.33Se alloy electrode has an abrupt increase at full irradiation from front, rear, and both sides. No time delay is detected in starting the cell, this observation supports the fact that the alloy CEs are robust in catalyzing the I−/I3− redox couple. Under sustained irradiation in each “on” state, there is no failure or even attenuation in the photocurrent density, suggesting low electron recombination with the I3− species. The conclusion can be supported by the J–V curves measured in the dark in Fig. 4d. As a reference, the on–off switch of a cell device with a standard Pt electrode is also provided. As shown in Fig. 6c, the decreased photocurrent density demonstrates the recombination of electrons and the I3− species. The photocurrent density in every on–off cycle remains stable, which is an essential prerequisite for multiple starts of a solar cell. Additionally, the photocurrent density versus time plots, measured over 5 h, demonstrate photocurrent stability upon prolonged exposure to light irradiation (100 mW cm−2). As displayed in Fig. 6b, no obvious decrease in current density could be detected in comparison with an apparent decrease in the photocurrent density of the Pt CE-based solar cell (Fig. 6d), referring to a relatively good stability.
 Fig. 6  The on–off plots, applying irradiation from the front, rear, or both sides, were achieved by alternately irradiating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) the DSSCs with (a) Ru0.33Se and (c) Pt electrodes at 50 s intervals of illumination and 0 V.

4. Conclusions
In summary, transparent and cost-effective Ru–Se binary alloys have been fabricated using a mild solution strategy, free of any surfactant or template, and employed as CE materials in DSSCs. The Ru0.33Se alloy CE displays lower Epp and Rct values, and a higher peak current density than those of the pure Pt electrode. Notably, the DSSC employing the Ru0.33Se alloy CE displays front and rear efficiencies of 8.76% and 5.90%, respectively, superior to the cell performance of the pristine Pt electrode. Moreover, the Pmax has been markedly enhanced for the DSSC with the Ru0.33Se alloy CE under bifacial irradiation in comparison with the pristine Pt-based cell. Additionally, the merits of quick start-up, low electron recombination, high multiple-start capability, and high photocurrent stability, motivate the potential application of such bifacial solar cell systems in engines, vehicles, and power sources. These promising results along with the bifacial irradiation technique may pave the way for developing cost-effective, efficient, and practical DSSCs.
