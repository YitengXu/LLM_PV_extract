    , Accepted 9th May 2019First published on 21st May 2019AbstractIf we wish to sustain our terrestrial ecosphere as we know it, then reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 is of critical importance. An ideal pathway for achieving this would be the use of sunlight to recycle CO2, in combination with water, into hydrocarbon fuels compatible with our current energy infrastructure. However, while the concept is intriguing such a technology has not been viable due to the vanishingly small CO2-to-fuel photoconversion efficiencies achieved. Herein we report a photocatalyst, reduced blue-titania sensitized with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles that generates a substantial amount of both methane and ethane by CO2 photoreduction under artificial sunlight (AM1.5): over a 6 h period 3.0 mmol g−1 methane and 0.15 mmol g−1 ethane are obtained (on an area normalized basis 0.244 mol m−2 methane and 0.012 mol m−2 ethane), while no H2 nor CO is detected. This activity (6 h) translates into a sustained Joule (sunlight) to Joule (fuel) photoconversion efficiency of 1%, with an apparent quantum efficiency of φ = 86%. The time-dependent photoconversion efficiency over 0.5 h intervals yields a maximum value of 3.3% (φ = 92%). Isotopic tracer experiments confirm the hydrocarbon products originate from CO2 and water.

Broader context
The 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly details how rapidly Earth's climate is changing due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Maintaining a recognizable ecosphere will require, by 2030, a decrease in global CO2 emissions by 45% from their 2010 levels, with zero net global emissions by 2050. Our interest lies in the use of sunlight to efficiently recycle CO2 from a waste combustion product, and water vapor, into hydrocarbon fuels, readily stored and transported, that can be used within the current energy infrastructure. Using a photocatalyst comprised of blue-colored reduced titania in combination with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles, under 1 sun illumination we obtain significant rates of fuel, methane and ethane, by photoreduction of CO2 and water. Notably, over a 6 h period we obtain a Joule (sunlight) to Joule (fuel) photoconversion efficiency of 1%. Just as photovoltaics went from niche market devices of low photoconversion efficiency to highly-efficient devices enabling a global industry, the sunlight-to-fuel photoconversion efficiencies we achieve suggest utility-scale implementation of a sunlight-powered recycled-CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel technology is realistically achievable in the near future.

1. Introduction
Hydrocarbon fuels are energy-dense (e.g. gasoline 45.7 MJ kg−1), inexpensive, relatively safe, easily stored and transported, and thus in significant demand;1,2 according to the International Energy Agency the total worldwide oil consumption is approximately 93 million barrels per day (or ≈15 billion litres per day). It is recognized that CO2 is a waste product of hydrocarbon fuel combustion, which is largely vented to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an infrared absorbing greenhouse gas that is now approaching a global concentration of 410 ppm in the atmosphere, a value soon to be surpassed, the negative consequences of which have been well-documented.3,4 A number of ideas have been considered to slow the growth of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere including, for example, a possible switch to a hydrogen economy. However, while hydrogen can be sustainably generated via photovoltaic or wind-powered electrolytic water splitting a hydrogen economy is predicated upon rebuilding our entire energy infrastructure, a prohibitively expensive and thus unlikely prospect.
The world energy infrastructure is clearly based upon the use of hydrocarbon fuels. Since there is an abundance of sunlight, water, and CO2, we have a vested interest in utilizing semiconductor photocatalysis, or electrocatalysis powered by wind/photovoltaic-power, to efficiently and effectively transform CO2 and water (i.e., artificial photosynthesis) into hydrocarbon fuels that can be readily used within our current energy infrastructure. Ultimately, we need CO2 photoconversion efficiencies large enough for translation of the technological concept from laboratory to industrial-scale application.
Although a variety of semiconductors have been investigated for their ability to mediate CO2 photoreduction under solar light, the overall yield of hydrocarbon products, typically CH4, has generally remained in the range of several μmol (g catalyst h)−1, the common units of the field,5,6 with overall photoconversion efficiencies, Joules of sunlight (in) to Joules of utilizable fuel (out) much too small for practical application. Due to the diversity of light sources used for CO2 photoreduction, and so too the common lack of specificity with regards to illumination intensity, establishing a historical timeline record of maximum photoconversion efficiency, akin to that tabulated for photovoltaics by the National Renewal Energy Laboratory (USA), is quite difficult. As a starting point, in 2009 Varghese and co-workers7 reported the use of sunlight and N-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays, co-catalysed with spatially separated Cu and Pt nanoparticles, for promoting CO2 photoconversion, achieving a photon-to-fuel photoconversion efficiency of ≈0.015%. Roy and co-workers subsequently reported, under artificial sunlight (AM1.5) CO2 to fuel photoconversion efficiency of 0.03% using TiO2 nanotube arrays uniformly deposited with copper nanoparticles.8 Clearly, if a CO2 to fuel photoconversion technology is ever to become a meaningful reality a significant advance is required in photoconversion efficiency.
Recently there have been reports of bias free approaches for CO2 conversion into hydrocarbon products. For example, silicon heterojunctions, with optimized cathode and photoanode, in a single reactor assembly were utilized for producing synthesis gas.9 Electrochemical reduction has been used to generate carbon monoxide by utilizing SnO2 deposited-CuO nanowires.10 Investigations have also considered the photovoltaic electrolysis of water for producing hydrogen,11–13 although there remains a significant trade-off between the required number of photovoltaic modules and electrolyser overpotential.14 Further, considering a solid–liquid reaction mode for CO2 reduction, the requirement of direct contact of liquid H2O and the modest solubility of CO2 in H2O limits the overall photocatalytic activity.15 With gas-phase approaches the rate of H2 production from H2O reduction is decreased with the additional possibility of photocatalyst re-usability.6 Therefore, we believe gas-phase photoconversion of CO2 and water vapor under concentrated sunlight the most promising route for developing a viable CO2 to fuel conversion technology. In the current work, photocatalytic CO2 reduction tests are conducted using an online flow-through system.16,17 Briefly, 40 mg of photocatalyst was evenly spread over a porous fritted glass disc of 2.5 cm diameter, making a photocatalyst layer approximately 19 μm thick, that was placed at the centre of the photoreactor. Moist CO2 gas was then continuously passed through the photoreactor, passing through the photocatalyst upon the porous fritted glass disc, at a flow rate of 40 cc min−1. After a 1 h purge the flow rate was decreased to 1 cc min−1 at which it was maintained over the entire photocatalytic reaction cycle. A 100 W Xe solar simulator (Oriel, LCS-100) with an AM1.5 filter was the light source, 100 mW cm−2. The schematic representation of our flow-through photocatalytic reactor is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the setup used for CO2 to fuel photoreduction experiments. 
Recently we reported on the application Pt nanoparticles attached to blue titania16 to promote CO2 photoreduction under sunlight (i.e., artificial photosynthesis) (6 h, AM1.5, 80.3 μmol g−1 h−1 CH4, 0.15% photoconversion efficiency), and how graphene wrapping switches the output product from CH4 to both CH4 and C2H6 (7 h, AM1.5, 37 μmol g−1 h−1 CH4, 11 μmol g−1 h−1 C2H6, 0.12% photoconversion efficiency).17 While these sunlight-driven rates of product output represent a benchmark for CO2 photoconversion efficiency, they are approximately 100 times lower than that needed, at least today, to achieve a commercially-viable technology.
Herein we present a significant improvement (∼10 times) in CO2 photoconversion efficiency, achieving remarkable rates of hydrocarbon fuel products under AM1.5 illumination (natural sunlight equivalent given an average path length through the total atmosphere) using a reduced, blue-colored titania16 photocatalyst sensitized with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles. Copper is known to adsorb CO2,18–20 while Pt nanoparticles are known to act as electron scavengers helping to prevent unwanted electron–hole recombination.21–23 Attached to the reduced titania, the synergistic effects of the bimetallic nanoparticles dramatically improve CO2 to fuel photoconversion efficiencies. While the overall photoconversion efficiency of the photocatalyst varies as a function of time, a recognized but as yet unsolved problem with active photocatalysts,24 over 0.5 h increments we find a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 3.3% with an apparent quantum yield 92%, and a 6 h average value of 1.0% (6 h, AM1.5, 3.0 mmol g−1 CH4, 150 μmol g−1 C2H6, or on an area normalized basis 0.244 mol m−2 CH4 and 0.012 mol m−2 C2H6, apparent quantum yield 86%). The obtained hydrocarbon yield is superior to recent works on CO2 photoreduction, see Table S1, ESI.† The photoconversion efficiencies that we achieve are an important milestone in the field of artificial photosynthesis, making it significantly more realistic to envision utility-scale implementation of a sunlight-powered CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel future.
2. Preliminary investigations
With respect to sample identification, BT denotes blue titania, Cu and Pt concentrations are given in wt%; Cux%–Pty%–BT denotes Pt was deposited upon BT with subsequent deposition of Cu. Based upon our earlier reported results16 a fixed value of 0.35 wt% Pt was used. To help elucidate the role of oxygen vacancies inherent to blue titania Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–P25 (TiO2) and Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT samples were tested for their ability to promote CO2 photoreduction of methane, see Fig. 2a. Over the course of 6 h AM1.5 illumination sample Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–P25 generated 1.04 mmol g−1 CH4, while sample Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT produced 3.0 mmol g−1 of CH4. The relatively poorer light absorption of P25 (a mixture of anatase and rutile TiO2), see Fig. 2b, and the lack of oxygen vacancies result in a significantly lower CH4 yield. We next investigated the effect of nanoparticle deposition sequence by comparing the performance of Pt0.35%–Cu1.00%–BT, to find 1.81 mmol g−1 CH4 evolved over 6 h.
 Fig. 2  Comparative methane evolution, UV-visible DRS, and PL spectra. (a) Effect of sample composition and structure on CO2 photoconversion to CH4 yield. (b) UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) indicate an enhancement in optical absorption with Cu–Pt nanoparticles, with absorption increasing with Cu content, and (c) PL spectroscopy indicates a better charge separation is observed for bimetallic deposited blue titania sample. 
As seen in Fig. 2a, the order in which the metal co-catalysts are deposited has a significant impact on product formation rates, with deposition of the Cu atop the Pt being optimal. These results indicate that the presence of oxygen vacancies and positioning of the bimetallic nanoparticles play significant roles in determining CO2 photoreduction efficiency, as has been earlier noted, for example, by Ovcharov and co-workers.25Fig. 2b shows the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of various samples. An enhanced absorption λ > 400 nm is observed for Pt0.35%–BT due to interband transitions in the Pt nanoparticles.26 Furthermore, on depositing Cu nanoparticles over Pt, a slight shift in the absorption tail in the 400–500 nm region is perceived, a behaviour primarily attributed to interfacial charge transfer (IFCT) phenomenon.27,28 It occurs because of photogenerated electrons being extracted from the blue titania by the Pt nanoparticles and then being transferred to the Cu nanoparticles; similar IFCT behavior was observed in Pt coated Ag nanoparticles.29 The IFCT behavior is confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), where superior charge separation is observed for the Cu–Pt (nanoparticle) deposited BT (Fig. 2c).
To obtain deeper insight into the charge transfer mechanisms we performed time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†). TRPL decay traces were fitted using the bi-exponential fitting model described by eqn (1);30,31A1 and A2 are the corresponding amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 are, respectively, the fast and slow components originating from the free exciton states and bound exciton states.32 We found P25 nanoparticles to have the shortest lifetime of 1.12 ns. With the BT samples the carrier lifetime is extended to 2.90 ns, which we attribute to carrier relaxation in the oxygen vacancies before undergoing recombination. It is evident from the fitting data that both τ1 and τ2 have decreased with BT metal sensitization, 0.35 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Cu, which leads to a decrease in charge carrier lifetimes (τBT = 2.90 ns, τCu–BT = 2.56 ns, τPt–BT = 2.53 ns, τPt–Cu–BT = 2.41 ns, and τCu–Pt–BT = 2.39 ns). The calculated rates of charge transfer32,33 for each sample are: 13.59 ns for Cu–Pt–BT, 14.26 ns for Pt–Cu–BT, 21.83 ns for Cu–BT, and 19.82 ns for Pt–BT. Faster charge transfer times correspond to superior photoinduced charge transfer efficiency (η): 17.58% for Cu–Pt–BT, 16.9% for Pt–Cu–BT, 11.72% for Cu–BT, and 12.76% for Pt–BT. The TRPL analysis unambiguously confirms faster photoinduced charge transfer for the Cu–Pt–BT samples, as well as increased electron transfer efficiency. (1)
3. Material analysis

Fig. 3(a)–(c) provide HR-TEM images of a Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample, while Fig. 3(d) shows a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained from Fig. 3(c). The diffraction rings are not continuous, which may be due to individual nanoparticles being crystalline.32 The presence of Pt, Cu and Cu–Pt nanoparticles is confirmed from the d-spacing of the lattice fringes, which are 0.23 nm for Pt(111),33 0.21 nm for Cu(111)34 and 0.22 nm for Cu–Pt(111).35,36 The anatase phase of blue titania with a d-spacing of 0.34 nm, corresponding to the (101) plane, is confirmed through the high resolution lattice fringes.33 Additional HR-TEM images with SAED and EDS data are given in the ESI,† see Fig. S2 and S3. The HR-TEM results confirm the presence of Cu, Pt and Cu–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles in intimate contact with the blue titania. TEM elemental mapping (Fig. S4, ESI†) confirms the uniform presence of Cu and Pt nanoparticles over the surface of a Cu1.00–Pt0.35%–BT sample. Fig. S5 (ESI†) of the shows the XRD of different wt% deposited blue titania samples, the spectra of which indicate Cu–Pt nanoparticle deposition did not affect the original crystalline phase of the blue titania nanoparticles. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum given in Fig. S6 (ESI†) confirms the presence of Ti3+ states in the blue titania due to oxygen vacancies.

XPS analysis of a Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample, Fig. 4, provides additional insights into photocatalyst properties. The two peaks in Fig. 4a and b are assigned to Cu 2p3/2 (932.9 eV) and 2p1/2 (952.2 eV).24 As compared with pure Cu (933.0 eV and 952.8 eV), both peaks are shifted to lower binding energies due to an interplay of electronic and geometric factors.37,38 Electronic factors include changes in hybridization, electron transfer from Pt to Cu,29,37 and changes in charge density.38 Geometric factors play a role in core-level binding energy shifts by affecting electronic structure, to include changes in bond length and coordination.38 Since the diameter of a Cu atom (≈145 pm) is smaller than Pt (≈177 pm), the interaction between them induces an expansion of the Cu lattice.35 XPS analysis of Pt revealed a peak at 71.4 eV, a value close to that of metallic Pt (71.0 eV) but of a slightly higher binding energy (Fig. 4c). Fig. 4d shows XPS results for BT, Pt0.35%–BT, and Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT samples; a reduced Pt 4f signal intensity is observed as well as a positive shift in binding energy. This can be attributed to the Pt surface being deposited with Cu.39 XPS analysis of Pt nanoparticles gives no indication of a negative peak shift, which suggests that all extracted photogenerated electrons are transferred onto the Cu, with no reverse electron migration,29 confirming the IFCT behavior, resulting in an enriched electron density within the Cu and as a consequence preventing it from oxidation.

4. CO2 photoreduction

Fig. 5a and b show product formation rates during CO2 photoreduction (AM1.5 illumination) over different Cu weight percent Cux%–Pt0.35%–BT samples. Over a 6 h period the optimum sample, Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT, produces 0.15 mmol g−1 C2H6 and 3.00 mmol g−1 CH4. The hydrocarbon yield for Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT is ≈6 times higher than Pt0.35%–BT. Fig. 5c shows a sustained stability test of a Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample, which is vacuum annealed (0.1 MPa) for 2 h at 100 °C every 12 h. Sample stability far exceeds previous reports.16,17,40,41Fig. 5d shows the time-dependent sunlight-to-fuel photoconversion efficiency, in 0.5 h increments (the GC sampling rate), of sample Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT. A peak efficiency of 3.3% is reached. In common with many but not all photocatalysts there is a distinct activation stage, generally due to the temperature of the sample increasing due to illumination, a rapid nonlinear deactivation stage commonly due to co-catalyst oxidation,42 and then a slow gradual deactivation due to formation of unwanted intermediates, typically HCOOH, CO2˙, and HCO3˙ on the surface of the photocatalyst.18

Isotopic studies (Fig. 6a and b) and control tests (Fig. S7, ESI†) confirm CO2 as the hydrocarbon source.40,43–45 Further, an isotopic tracer experiment using H218O labelled water was also conducted to confirm oxygen evolution during the photocatalytic process. The results are given in Fig. 6c and d. As compared with non-labelled water, quite a large amount of 16O18O and 18O2 is generated when tests are conducted using H218O labelled water.46,47 Control sample results are given in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). The isotopic tests and control tests confirm the reaction is entirely due to solar-spectrum photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The stability of the Cu and Pt nanoparticles under photocatalytic CO2 reduction was verified by performing XPS analysis of used Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample. The results, see Fig. S10 (ESI†), confirms the Cu and Pt nanoparticle chemical states remain unaltered even after 12 h photocatalysis under AM1.5 illumination. To confirm the reproducibility of our results, a freshly prepared Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample was tested in a separate GC unit having similar experimental set-up as described in the previous section. The result obtained are shown in Fig. S11, ESI:† the fuel product formation rates obtained confirm the reproducibility of the photocatalytic activity.

5. Effect of photocatalyst hierarchical structure
Comparing the photoreduction activity of Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT (6 h CH4 yield = 3.00 mmol g−1) and Pt0.35%–Cu1.00%–BT (6 h CH4 yield = 1.81 mmol g−1), wherein the hierarchical order of the metal nanoparticles is switched, superior performance is obtained with the Pt nanoparticles in direct contact with the BT. To obtain insight into the charge transfer mechanism, we performed TRPL analysis comparing the results of a Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample with a switched bimetallic counterpart, i.e. Pt0.35%–Cu1.00%–BT. The TRPL results (Table S2, ESI†) clearly indicate superior charge transfer efficiency when Pt is in direct contact with the blue titania. As confirmed by the XPS analysis, electrons collected by the Pt are readily transferred to the Cu which is known for its excellent CO2 adsorption properties.48,49 Further, Cu nanoparticles enhance the alkalinity of the photocatalyst thereby increasing adsorption of the acidic CO2 molecules.50 Previous work by Ovcharov and co-workers25 have highlighted the significance of the hierarchical structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles, investigating the photoreduction of CO2 on TiO2 modified with Ag/Cu or Cu/Ag bimetallic nanoparticles. Under UV illumination they found a significant variation in methane formation rates, a factor of ≈3.5, depending upon the hierarchical structure of the bimetallic nanoparticle, with TiO2/Ag/Cu demonstrating superior performance over TiO2/Cu/Ag. They suggested the improved performance of the TiO2/Ag/Cu structure was due to enhanced transfer of photogenerated electrons from highly conductive Ag to Cu. Similarly, Tada and co-workers51 showed significantly greater photocatalytic activity of a TiO2/Au/CdS composite than for TiO2/CdS and TiO2/Au, a behavior attributed to enhanced separation of the photogenerated charges due to electron transfer from highly conductive Au to CdS. Thus, in our case there appears to be a synergistic effect between the charge separation and transfer properties of Pt to Cu and the CO2 adsorption properties of both reduced titania and Cu that enables the photosynthesis of hydrocarbons with high yield.
6. Mechanism of CO2 photoreduction into C1 and C2 hydrocarbons
Generally, there are two possible pathways accepted for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into hydrocarbons. One is hydrogenation of the CO2 molecule which occurs in the presence of CO and H2 to yield the hydrocarbon product (R1); this is called the Fischer–Tropsch reaction.20 However, in the present study we did not observe H2 or CO evolution, see Fig. 7. The absence of these gases suggests an alternative pathway in which CO2 reduction proceeds via successive transfer of electrons to CO2 followed by its protonation, thus leading to hydrocarbon formation.6 Furthermore, we conducted FTIR analysis of Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT after photocatalysis (Fig. 7c). A control sample was tested which was subjected to photocatalytic reaction for 6 h under He. The second test was conducted in the presence of CO2 + H2O mixture. The control test did not reveal any peaks that could be ascribed to intermediates of CO2 photoreduction. On the other hand, the test conducted under moist CO2 showcased C–H stretching bands52,53 at 2857 cm−1 and 2925 cm−1. The FTIR signals were similar to those reported by Lee et al., who also found the presence of CH3 during CO2 photoreduction tests.54 The experiments confirm CH3 as an intermediate, enabling us to propose the mechanism by which CO2 is photocatalytically converted into hydrocarbon products.
 Fig. 7  GC-TCD results for detecting (a) H2 and (b) CO in output from photocatalytic CO2 + H2O conversion test of a Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample. The results demonstrate no detectable levels of H2 or CO are formed during the CO2 photoreduction experiments. (c) FTIR analysis of Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT sample confirming the presence of –CH3 due to photoreaction under CO2. 
Initially, CO2 photoreduction proceeds via activation of CO2 which can be strongly adsorbed at oxygen vacancy sites (VO) on the surface of reduced titania.55,56 With CO2 molecules being introduced into the photoreactor, they are adsorbed and photo-activated to generate CO2˙−, the CO2 radical anion, from the oxygen vacancy sites of reduced titania6(R2). Computational studies by Indrakanti and co-workers57 have proven such defect sites favours the adsorption of CO2 molecules leading to lowering of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of CO2 from its gas phase value, by decrease of the linear O–C–O bond angle. Under illumination photogenerated mobile electrons and holes are created, respectively, in the BT conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB). The CB electrons are captured by the Pt nanoparticles due to its higher Fermi energy difference58 and lower Schottky energy barrier.16,59 Once collected by the Pt these photogenerated electrons are subsequently transferred to Cu via IFCT29,60 phenomenon where excess adsorbed CO2˙− in turn reacts with multiple hydrogen atoms (H˙) to generate CH3˙ (R3).6,61–63 The formation of CH3˙ and its stability is promoted by direct and efficient collection and transport of BT-generated electrons through Pt to Cu. This favours the stabilization of CH3˙ thus generating not only a C1 product CH4(R4), but also C2 product C2H6 due to a CH3˙ radical self-reaction20,64 (R5). CO + H2 → CH4/C2H6(R1) CO2 + e− → CO2˙−(R2) CO2˙− + nH˙ → CH3˙(R3) CH3˙ + H˙ → CH4(R4) CH3˙ + CH3˙ → C2H6(R5)
7. Conclusions
In summary for the first time a series of bimetallic nanoparticles have been used with reduced blue-colored titania, and under AM1.5 illumination applied to the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 and C2 products. The Cu content has a notable effect on the Pt-sensitized blue titania. Specifically, over a 6 h period we find 1.0 wt% Cu over Pt0.35%–BT is enough to yield C2H6 at a rate of 0.15 mmol g−1 and CH4 at 3.00 mmol g−1 (0.244 mol m−2 CH4 and 0.012 mol m−2 C2H6) with a sunlight to fuel (methane, ethane) photoconversion efficiency of 1%. The Cu nanoparticles provide sites for CO2 adsorption, while the Pt effectively prevents electron–hole recombination. With a sufficient number of CO2 adsorption sites and a sustained supply of electrons we have been able to significantly improve the yields of hydrocarbon products. Over repeated 12 h test cycles we achieve an apparent quantum yield of 50%. Absence of H2 and CO production suggests the proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway is favoured for CO2 photoreduction.
As seen in Fig. 5c, the photocatalyst demonstrates non-optimal but yet significant performance through 12 h of operation, with full performance regained upon exposure to reduced atmosphere at 100 °C, an as yet unoptimized recovery treatment. If we may be allowed to speculate, a commercial CO2 photoreduction system would presumably need to work with concentrated sunlight to minimize costs associated with gas handling apparatus. Fig. 5c suggests we already have sufficient photocatalyst stability to get through the day, after which during the night a relatively inexpensive mechanical pump could be used to draw a modest vacuum thereby recovering sample performance. Put this way, we have an intrinsically stable sunlight-active CO2 photoreduction photocatalyst and system capable of converting, at approximately 1% photoconversion efficiency over the course of a day, CO2 and water to a fuel compatible with our current energy infrastructure. We believe our present work serves as an important stepping-stone towards the development of robust, highly efficient photocatalysts suitable for utility-scale application of CO2 photoconversion with corresponding reduction of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Recent studies utilizing hybrid tandem device structure for achieving bias-free photoelectrochemical water splitting65 and energy storage66 could serve as guiding tool for conversion of CO2 into fuel by converging two different technologies. Further we believe our system, suitably refined, has the potential to be used in application for normalizing nitrous oxide (N2O), which is also an important greenhouse gas.67,68 Looking forward to translation of the technology from laboratory scale to real world conditions, the most logical path for achieving such a commercial/utility-scale photocatalytic system for CO2 to fuel is conversion by using concentrated sunlight. The idea being, to clarify, many suns worth of energy coupled with one set of plumbing. Parabolic light concentrators are readily available and inexpensive. How many suns are optimal per given reactant flow rate remain to be determined and can be a separate topic for research. We also note that a great variety of reactor designs have been utilized for CO2 photoreduction, e.g. photocatalyst dispersed upon a glass slide and this placed upon the floor of a batch reactor,62 photocatalyst coated on the outside of a fiber optic through which light is passed and over which gas flowed,69,70 calcinated titania nanoparticles coated on stainless steel mesh,71 and integration of solar cells with photoelectrochemical system.9 The idea of utilizing a photocatalyst fabricated in the form of gas permeable wafers that are thick enough to absorb all incident light, and have a sufficient degree of mechanical integrity to enable handling appears a practical approach. In closing, we note the many unsolved systematic variables that require elucidation. Diligent and sustained effort is required to achieve scalable technologies able to meaningfully convert CO2 into usable fuel thereby preventing chaotic climate change.
Methods
(1) Photoconversion efficiency calculation, example.
After 1.0 h a total of 0.80 mmol g−1 CH4 and 0.034 mmol g−1 C2H6 had been produced. Over the next 0.5 h (1.0 h to 1.5 h), an additional 0.79 mmol g−1 CH4 and 0.049 mmol g−1 C2H6 were produced. Fuel energy (Joule) output during that incremental 0.5 h is calculated by:
Methane: (0.79 mmol g−1) × 40 mg sample = 31.6 × 10−6 mole × 810 kJ mol−1 = 25.6 J
Ethane: (0.049 mmol g−1) × 40 mg sample = 1.96 × 10−6 mole × 1560 kJ mol−1 = 3.1 J
Energy content of fuel produced by CO2 photoreduction during 0.5 h period: 28.7 J
AM1.5 energy input for 0.5 h = (4.88 cm2) (100 mJ s−1 cm−2) (3600 s h−1) (0.5 h) = 878 J
AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 incident upon 4.88 cm2 surface area.
Solar energy in to fuel energy out (Joules to Joules) = (28.7/878.4) × 100 = 3.3%
(2) Apparent quantum yield (AQY) calculations
(a) AQY calculation for 6 h
Apparent quantum yield (AQY) is defined as the ratio of number of reacted electrons to the number of incident photons. It is given by the below equation58,72 (A.1)As given in eqn (E.1), photocatalytic CO2 reduction stoichiometrically requires 8 electrons and 8 protons to generate one molecule of CH4 CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O(E.1)Therefore, number of reacted electrons can be calculated by directly multiplying 8 with mole of CH4 produced during the photocatalytic reaction58 Number of reacted electrons = [CH4] × 8 × NA(E.2)Mole of CH4 produced is given by [CH4] in time (t) and NA is the Avogadro's number (6.022 × 1023 mol−1). Herein, we will describe the calculation particularly for the photocatalyst Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT, which yielded 0.5 mmol g−1 h−1 CH4 over a 6 h run. The number of reacted electrons = 2.4 × 1021(E.3)The number of incident photons is same as the photon flux density,72 which is given by eqn (E.4), (E.4)“t” is the photoreaction time (s). Thus, light absorbed by the photocatalyst is given by: Light absorbed by the photocatalyst = H × A = 0.49 J s−1(E.5)H is the apparent light input at the photocatalyst (W m−2) of 100 W xenon solar simulator (Oriel, LCS-100) with an AM1.5 filter used in the present study (H = 1000 W m−2).58,73,74 Similar evaluation conditions were reported by Grätzel et al.10 The geometric irradiation area of the photocatalyst placed inside the photoreactor is given by A, which is 0.00049 m2. (E.6)where h is Planck's constant (h = 6.626 × 10−34 J s), c = 3 × 108 m s−1 and the value of λ is found as average wavelength of the broadband light source (352 nm). Since the bandgap of BT-30 as estimated from UV-visible DRS analysis is 2.85 eV, unbound and free electron–hole pairs cannot be generated for λ > 435 nm. Thus photons with wavelength 250–435 nm can excite electrons, whose average photonic wavelength (λ = 342 nm) is used to calculate the apparent quantum efficiency.74,75 Combining values from eqn (E.5) and (E.6) and substituting in eqn (E.4) we have: Number of incident photons = 3.0 × 1021(E.7)Substituting values from (E.3) and (E.7) in eqn (A.1), the AQY of sample Cu1.00%–Pt0.35%–BT for methane is found to be 80%.
A similar calculation for ethane was done, where the number of reacted electrons can be calculated by directly multiplying 14 with mole of C2H6 produced during the photocatalytic reaction, from which we find the number of reacted electrons = 2.0 × 1020.
Substituting this value, and that of (E.7), into eqn (A.1), AQY for C2H6 is we find AQY = 6%.Total AQY = AQY (CH4) + AQY (C2H6) = 86% (Over 6 h).
(b) AQY calculation for 0.79 mmol g−1 CH4 over 0.5 h increment
Considering the 0.79 mmol g−1 increase in CH4 over 0.5 h, we find the number of reacted electrons = 25.05 × 1020. Substituting this value and that of (E.7) into (A.1) we find the AQY for CH4 is AQY = 83%. After 1.5 h, the next 0.5 increment of ethane is 0.032 mmol g−1 h−1, thus the number of reacted electrons = 2.8 × 1020. Substituting this value and that of (E.7), into (A.1) we find the AQY for C2H6 is 9.0%. Hence the total AQY for 0.5 h increment = 92%.

Broader context
The 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly details how rapidly Earth's climate is changing due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Maintaining a recognizable ecosphere will require, by 2030, a decrease in global CO2 emissions by 45% from their 2010 levels, with zero net global emissions by 2050. Our interest lies in the use of sunlight to efficiently recycle CO2 from a waste combustion product, and water vapor, into hydrocarbon fuels, readily stored and transported, that can be used within the current energy infrastructure. Using a photocatalyst comprised of blue-colored reduced titania in combination with bimetallic Cu–Pt nanoparticles, under 1 sun illumination we obtain significant rates of fuel, methane and ethane, by photoreduction of CO2 and water. Notably, over a 6 h period we obtain a Joule (sunlight) to Joule (fuel) photoconversion efficiency of 1%. Just as photovoltaics went from niche market devices of low photoconversion efficiency to highly-efficient devices enabling a global industry, the sunlight-to-fuel photoconversion efficiencies we achieve suggest utility-scale implementation of a sunlight-powered recycled-CO2 to hydrocarbon fuel technology is realistically achievable in the near future.
