    , Accepted 4th September 2019First published on 26th September 2019AbstractOwing to their prominent thermal stability, inorganic halide perovskites have been deemed as promising substitutes for organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites; however, their application is hindered by their mediocre efficiency. High exciton binding energies in inorganic perovskites have been considered to be one of the main obstacles, which lead to insufficient separation of bound excitons and low photocurrent output. Herein, we demonstrated an effective strategy to enhance the exciton dissociation efficiency in inorganic perovskites by incorporating layer-structure-tunable two-dimensional black phosphorous. Importantly, the energy-level configuration and work function alignment of multi-layer black phosphorous can be tuned by adjusting the number of layers, which induces built-in electric field formation and boosts interfacial charge carrier transfer. Furthermore, it is revealed that multi-layer black phosphorous can increase relative permittivity due to its efficient dielectric screening effect in a local dielectric environment, thus diminishing the exciton binding energy, enhancing the exciton dissociation efficiency and leading to a significant increase in the free carrier density of inorganic perovskites. The multi-layer black phosphorous–CsPbI3 heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the inorganic CuSCN hole-transport-layer (HTL) exhibit the current density of 19.3 mA cm−2 and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.17%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for PSCs with all-inorganic materials.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite semiconductor materials comprise a unique set of intriguing optoelectronic attributes such as high optical absorption coefficient, extra-long carrier diffusion length and low exciton binding energy, achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices.1–5 Despite their high efficiency, the commercialization of PSCs is still restricted by thermal and moisture instability originating from the degradation of organic components in perovskite active materials and hole transport materials.6 To address this obstacle, all-inorganic PSCs, with inorganic halide perovskites CsPbX3 and inorganic carrier transport materials, are deemed as promising alternatives due to their native inorganic structure stability and equally excellent photoelectric properties.7–9 However, the PCE enhancement of inorganic PSCs is significantly restricted by poor short-circuit current density.10,11 Even for room-temperature-stable cubic CsPbI3 PSCs possessing bandgaps and optical absorption ranges similar to those of their organic–inorganic counterparts, the effective current outputs are not more than 15 mA cm−2.12 Therefore, it is extremely urgent to understand the photocurrent generation process for the realization of inorganic PSCs with higher short-circuit current density and high efficiency.
The exciton dissociation limitation in photovoltaic materials can be one of the foremost reasons for the poor photocurrent output of these materials. Theoretically, the photogenerated electrons or holes in optical absorbing materials can be transferred to the interface between an active layer and carrier extraction layers in the form of both free carriers and bound excitons.13 However, compared to the low exciton binding energy of 2–20 meV in organic–inorganic perovskites,14–16 inorganic perovskites possess a higher binding energy of around 86 meV,17 representing a large energy barrier for exciton dissociation through intrinsic thermal energy activation at room temperature (kT ≈ 25 meV). The relatively high exciton binding energy in inorganic halide perovskites causes insufficient exciton dissociation at room temperature, increasing the possibility for the radiative/nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes.18 On the other hand, nearly full ionization of excitons occurs in organic–inorganic halide perovskites due to their extremely low binding energy; therefore, it is of great importance to design a heterostructure interface to boost exciton dissociation and carrier transfer in inorganic PSCs.
Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials have shown significant potential for application in optoelectronic conversion devices due to their unique physical properties.19 It has been reported that the introduction of 2D materials, such as WS2 or MoS2, into perovskite solar cells and organic solar cells can significantly affect the exciton binding energy via modulation of the built-in field across photovoltaic layers.20,21 2D black phosphorous (phosphorene) has recently received extensive attention due to its high carrier mobility, anisotropic photoelectronic properties and ambipolar transport characteristics.22 Especially, 2D black phosphorous is uniquely endowed with a layer-dependent electronic band structure owing to its puckered orthorhombic lattice and the synergistic effect of quantum confinement and interlayer interactions.23 The energy-level configuration and work function band alignment of 2D black phosphorous can be tuned by adjusting the number of layers; thus, 2D black phosphorous exhibits strong light–matter interactions in visible-infrared frequencies and potential for application in the synthesis of a variety of photoelectronic structures;23 recently, Lin and Muduli et al. have reported that as a carrier transport medium with a cascade band structure, liquid exfoliated few-layer black phosphorous can facilitate carrier extraction and enhance the transport efficiency in organic and organic–inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.24,25 In addition, the strong broadband light absorption and scattering effect in few-layer black phosphorous were demonstrated to significantly enhance the power conversion efficiency when few-layer black phosphorous as an additive was introduced into organic photovoltaics.26
Herein, we proposed a novel heterostructure based on cubic-phase CsPbI3 and multi-layer black phosphorous, where the energy-level configuration and work function alignment could be accurately tuned by adjusting the layer-structure of black phosphorous. The built-in electric field in the heterostructure led to enhanced interfacial carrier transfer and reduced recombination loss. Furthermore, the introduction of multi-layer black phosphorous increased the relative permittivity due to its efficient dielectric screening effect in the local dielectric environment, thus diminishing the exciton binding energy, enhancing the exciton dissociation efficiency and leading to a significant increase in the free carrier density of inorganic perovskites. The multi-layer black phosphorous–CsPbI3 heterostructure solar cell with the inorganic CuSCN HTL exhibits the current density of 19.3 mA cm−2 and the power conversion efficiency of 14.17%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for PSCs with all-inorganic materials.
Results and discussion
2D black phosphorous has a puckered orthorhombic crystal structure with a 0.53 nm interlayer spacing, as shown in Fig. 1a.23 Each phosphorous atom is connected to three neighboring atoms; this leads to the formation of four atomic structural units with two symmetry-inequivalent P–P bonds. By the liquid-phase ultrasonication method and adjusting the solvent composition, concentration and ultrasonic aging time, we could accurately manipulate the layer numbers of multi-layer black phosphorous samples, which were labeled as bulk BP, BP1–2, BP3–4 and BP6–7, respectively, depending on the number of layers. The exfoliated multi-layer black phosphorous flakes were further deposited between the CsPbI3 light-active layer and the CuSCN hole-transport layer in all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, with the thickness of around 50 nm (Fig. 1a and b). Fig. 1c presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the BP and CsPbI3 samples. The diffraction peaks at 16.8°, 34.1°, 34.9° and 52.1° for bulk BP are preserved in the diffraction pattern of the black phosphorous sample, corresponding to the (020), (040), (111) and (060) planes of the orthorhombic black phosphorous crystal structure. The same diffraction peaks appeared in the heterostructured multi-layer black phosphorous–CsPbI3 sample, demonstrating no damage to the 2D black phosphorous structure after coupling with the CsPbI3 perovskite. Fig. S1† displays the SEM images of film surface morphologies, which confirm the excellent coverage, homogeneity and smoothness of the pristine perovskite film and a uniform coverage of multi-layer black phosphorous on the perovskite film.

The layer structures of exfoliated multi-layer black phosphorous flakes were further studied using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Fig. 1d depicts a low-magnification TEM image, displaying an ultrathin 2D nanoflake structure with obvious wrinkles and distinguishable edges as well as hundreds of nanometers of lateral dimensions. The electron diffraction pattern confirms that the multi-layer black phosphorous sample exhibits a high-quality single-crystal structure with a [010] crystal zone axis of orthorhombic character. Furthermore, the diffraction intensity ratio of (110) and (200) has been found to be greater than 1, suggesting that the structure is monolayer.28 To further study the morphology and crystal structure characteristics of multi-layer black phosphorous, Raman spectroscopy and AFM measurements were carried out. Fig. 2a shows the Raman spectra of bulk black phosphorous and the deposited multi-layer black phosphorous films under different exfoliation conditions. Compared to those of bulk BP, the three vibrational modes Ag1, B2g and Ag2 of exfoliated BPs show slight red-shifts, confirming the formation of multi-layer black phosphorous dispersions and a gradual decrease in thickness for BP6–7, BP3–4 and BP1–2.27 Especially, the vibrational modes Ag1, B2g and Ag2 for the BP1–2 film are approximately 362, 439 and 467 cm−1, respectively, corresponding well to those of the previously reported monolayered black phosphorous material; this demonstrates that the black phosphorous films retain the intrinsic 2D layered structure.27Fig. 2b–d show the typical AFM images of BP1–2, BP3–4 and BP6–7 as well as the histogram of the thickness distributions of multi-layer black phosphorous counted from the height profiles of 100 individual flakes (Fig. S2†). In the case of BP1–2, over 80% of probed samples are thinner than 1.5 nm, indicating adequate exfoliation. For BP3–4 and BP6–7, the probed flakes represent a normal distribution centered at around 2 and 3.5 nm, corresponding to the layer numbers of 3–4 and 6–7. Moreover, with a decrease in the number of layers, the 2D black phosphorous sample exhibited shrinkage in size, elevation in the degree of dispersion, and a decrease in the number of overlapping nanoflakes, as shown in the AFM images.

The energy-level configuration of the all-inorganic perovskite solar cells based on multi-layer black phosphorous–CsPbI3 was investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. The fabrication processes of the multi-layer black phosphorous samples for the UV-vis-NIR and UPS measurements are consistent with the process employed in solar device fabrication. Fig. 3a and b show the full view and magnified view of the secondary electron cut-off region, in which the work function is determined by the difference between the incident photon energy (21.2 eV) and the binding energy of the secondary electron cut-off. The difference between the work function and the valence band was determined by the intersection of the linear portion of the spectra near the low binding energy region with the baseline. As observed from Fig. 3b, as the layer number reduced, the Fermi level of the multi-layer black phosphorous sample decreased, whereas the valence band increased. Fig. 3c presents bandgap variation with the layer numbers of black phosphorous determined from the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S2 and S3†). With a decrease in the layer number, the bandgap values increased from 0.3 eV for bulk BP to 1.2 eV (BP6–7), 1.6 eV (BP3–4) and 1.7 eV (BP1–2). The corresponding energy level diagrams of CsPbI3, multi-layer black phosphorous and CuSCN are depicted in Fig. 3d. The energy-level alignment (for both the valence band and the conduction band) of CsPbI3–BP1–2 is feasible for holes to be extracted by CuSCN along 2D black phosphorous and electrons to be blocked under the potential barrier of 2D black phosphorous.

Due to the coexistence of free carriers and bound excitons in perovskite materials, it is of fundamental importance to study the exciton dissociation efficiency by varying the exciton binding energy. Since photoluminescence (PL) measurements at low temperatures are sensitive to the interaction between excitons and free carriers, the analysis of the temperature dependence of PL spectra is essential to understand the generation and transport mechanism of excitons and free carriers in multi-layer black phosphorous and perovskites.29,30Fig. 4a–d show a comparison between the temperature-dependent PL spectra obtained at temperatures ranging from 80 K to 280 K of pristine CsPbI3 and CsPbI3–BP heterostructures. At first, heterostructured CsPbI3–BP showed lower PL emission intensity when compared with pristine CsPbI3 at same temperature. Moreover, in the temperature range of interest, the normalized PL intensities exhibited a distinct decrease on changing the multi-layer black phosphorous. The variation tendency originated from the addition of a new non-radiative decay channel, benefiting the electron–hole separation and carrier transfer towards the CsPbI3–BP interface. Then, the emission peak of CsPbI3–BP (especially for CsPbI3–BP1–2) represented an obvious red-shift when compared with that of pristine CsPbI3 (shown in Fig. 4e–h). The change in the emission wavelength for heterostructured CsPbI3–BP indicates decreased defect states and increased exciton dissociation efficiency induced by 2D black phosphorous.29

(e–h) Corresponding steady-state PL spectra for pristine CsPbI3, CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2 heterostructures at various temperatures from 80 to 280 K. (i–l) Corresponding temperature-dependence of the integrated PL intensities of CsPbI3, CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2 heterostructures. The red lines are fitting curves from the integrated intensity-temperature points. 
Furthermore, exciton binding energies in the CsPbI3–BP heterostructures could be estimated via the temperature dependence of integral PL intensities following the Arrhenius equation:31 (1)where I(T) is the integrated PL intensity at temperature T, and I0 is the integrated PL intensity at the phase transition onset of 120 K. kB is the Boltzmann constant, and EB is the exciton binding energy. From the fittings shown in Fig. 4a–d, the exciton binding energy for CsPbI3 has been found to be 103.0 ± 8.2 meV, the same magnitude of the values of organic–inorganic perovskite materials.14,15 The deposition of CuSCN on CsPbI3 had nearly no influence on the exciton binding energy (100.5 ± 4.9 meV, Fig. S5†). However, the exciton binding energies for CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2 were reduced to 63.2 ± 8.1 meV, 56.2 ± 7.4 meV and 47.2 ± 9.0 meV, respectively. The decreased exciton binding energies of the CsPbI3–BP heterostructures demonstrated that the excitons were effectively dissociated into free charge carriers as the layer numbers of the coupled multi-layer black phosphorous decreased. To quantitatively determine the enhanced exciton dissociation efficiency, we calculated the difference values of integral photoluminescence measured at 280 K and 120 K for these four samples. Herein, we discarded the experimental data measured at 80 K and 100 K due to the transformation of the phase structures of these samples and irregular PL intensity variations at these temperatures. Because the free carriers dissociated from excitons exhibited different thermodynamic states at low or high temperatures, we reasonably speculated that the PL at low temperatures totally originated from carrier radiative recombination and the PL at high temperatures originated from the recombination of the remaining carriers extracted by BPs. Therefore, we regarded the PL difference at low and high temperatures as the effective exciton dissociation efficiency. The exciton dissociation efficiency for pristine CsPbI3 was 86%. After the incorporation of BP flakes, the exciton dissociation efficiencies increased to 93%, 96% and 98% for CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2, respectively.
To further understand the effect of the local environment on the excitons and the variation mechanism of the exciton binding energy in CsPbI3–BP heterostructures, the interfacial exciton dynamics models representing Coulomb interactions between electrons and holes were fabricated, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. Theoretically, the strong Coulomb interactions of bound electron–hole pairs originate from a low dielectric constant and weak dielectric screening limit.32 Moreover, since the electric field between Coulomb-bound electrons and holes permeates both the interior of the material and the local environment, the interactions of the bound electron–hole pairs are highly sensitive to the local dielectric environment, and the screening effect for electron and hole separation is increasingly dominated by the dielectric properties of the environment.32 Consequently, the exciton binding energy is expected to be tunable via a deliberate change in the environment such as under the influence of 2D nanostructures including WS2 and graphene;21,32 moreover, the Mott–Wannier model can be used to determine the exciton binding energy in a 2D semiconductor where Coulomb interactions are substituted by the Keldysh potential describing a nonlocally screened electron–hole interaction.32 Herein, the Coulomb potential energy created by point charges in 2D semiconductors follows the expression33 (2)where H0 and Y0 are the Struve function and the second kind Bessel function, respectively. e is the charge of an electron, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and  is the average dielectric constant of the surrounding media. r0 represents the screening length, and r is the distance between charges in the crystal plane. In this expression, r0 plays the important role of screening length and determines the boundary between two different behaviors of the potential. For r < r0, the potential takes the simplified form i.e. the Keldysh potential, (3)where γ is the Euler constant: 0.5772. For r > r0, the potential becomes the standard Coulomb potential in a 3D system, which can be transformed into the Cudazzo potential as follows: (4)

To comprehensively determine the effect of multi-layer black phosphorous on the variation of exciton binding energy for CsPbI3, we conducted electrochemical measurements to characterize the dielectric properties at the interface between the light active layer and the hole transport layer, as shown in Fig. 5b. The relative dielectric constant at low frequencies and high frequencies corresponds to the motion dynamics of the charge species at the interface between the light active layer and the electron transport layer and the interface between the light active layer and the hole transport layer, respectively.34 The relative dielectric constant εr (i.e. ) of the CsPbI3–BP heterostructure is higher than that of CsPbI3 in the high frequency region. Moreover, a decrease in the number of layers of 2D black phosphorous can induce a lager dielectric constant. The results indicate that the interaction between charge carriers is highly sensitive to the local dielectric environment. Due to the strong out-of-plane dielectric screening effect of 2D black phosphorous,35,36 the introduction of multi-layer black phosphorous mitigates the electric field at the light active layer/hole transport layer interface, resulting in a reduced Coulomb interaction in the aggregated perovskite domain (Fig. 5a) and thereby facilitating the separation and transfer of piled-up excitons in the vicinity of the perovskite/BP interface. Moreover, the dielectric screening effect is gradually enhanced as the layer number of 2D black phosphorous decreases; this further mitigates the electric field and boosts stronger polarizablity for the efficient delocalization of electron–hole pairs.

Fig. 5c presents the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the CsPbI3, CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2 heterostructures. In the high-frequency regime, the pure CsPbI3 device exhibits the maximum impedance value of 712 Ω. At the same voltage bias, the CsPbI3–BP6–7, CsPbI3–BP3–4 and CsPbI3–BP1–2 heterostructures show the impedance values of 524, 430 and 392 Ω, respectively. The decrease in the impedance at high frequencies demonstrates enhanced charge transfer kinetics and reduction in exciton accumulation at the interface between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer.37,38Fig. 5d depicts the Mott–Schottky plots of the three samples, from which we can obtain the charge carrier density of semiconductor devices.39 Compared to the carrier density of 1.92 × 1014 cm−3 for the CsPbI3 active layer sample, the carrier density of the CsPbI3–BP1–2 heterostructures can be enhanced to 2.82 × 1014 cm−3. The increase in the charge carrier density suggests that the dielectric screening effect in CsPbI3–BP heterostructures can effectively promote the dissociation of bound excitons and thus result in the generation of more free charge carriers.
To gain an insight into the interfacial charge transport process, we obtained the steady PL and time-resolved PL spectra, as displayed in Fig. 5e and f; after combining the perovskite with multi-layer black phosphorous, the PL intensities further decreased, which indicated that 2D black phosphorous enabled more efficient hole transport from the perovskite to the HTL. Fig. 5f further shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) characterization result of the CsPbI3–BP heterostructures. For the fabricated semi-devices in the absence and presence of an exciton-quenching layer and modeling of the PL decay to a diffusion equation, it is possible to accurately determine the exciton dissociation and diffusion rate.40 The pristine CsPbI3 film exhibits a lifetime of 20.3 ns after the deposition of the HTL of CuSCN. For heterostructured CsPbI3–BP–CuSCN, the PL decay lifetimes are 18.2 ns, 12.1 ns and 7.0 ns for BP6–7, BP3–4 and BP1–2, respectively. The decreased PL lifetimes indicate that the hole transfer process is more efficient in the CsPbI3–BP heterostructure due to the enhanced exciton dissociation in perovskite.41 Furthermore, we performed the TRPL characterization based on CsPbI3–TiO2 (shown in Fig. S11†) to detect the electron transfer efficiency as compared to the hole transfer efficiency in CsPbI3–BPs. The obtained average PL lifetime for CsPbI3–TiO2 is 6.2 ns. Note that the BP1–2-modified sample shows a more balanced fast decay lifetime (7.0 ns at the hole transport interface and 6.2 ns at the electron transport interface), indicating balanced hole and electron extraction abilities at the interfaces. The balanced charge-carrier extraction abilities at the interfaces could lead to balanced charge-carrier transport in the device, which was beneficial for suppressing the space-charge formation and carrier recombination, thus resulting in an increase in the fill factor.
On the basis of the experimental results, we proposed the mechanism of the exciton/free carrier generation-and-transfer in CsPbI3–BP heterostructures. As is known, free carriers and excitons coexist in bulk perovskite semiconductor materials under photoexcitation. For free carriers and excitons, there are mainly two effective approaches to produce photocurrent: (i) photoexcited free carriers are transferred to counter interfaces and are extracted by carrier transport layers and (ii) excitons move to counter interfaces and dissociate into free carriers through a multiphoton process.18 The carrier/exciton ratio can be largely affected by the interfacial potential, energy alignment and polarization intensity. For CsPbI3 all-inorganic PSCs, photocurrent generation is mainly derived from free carriers extracted at the interface between the perovskite layer and the transport layer. On the other hand, the excitons dissociate insufficiently, inducing the recombination of bound electron–hole pairs at the interface. However, when the perovskite is blended with multi-layer black phosphorous, the excitons are significantly relaxed at the perovskite/HTL interface due to the reduction of the exciton binding energy, indicating that the exciton density decreases and free carrier density increases. Moreover, the energy level alignment for BP1–2 and CuSCN can offer a transport channel for holes and a potential barrier for electrons, benefiting the enhancement of the photocurrent output.
The photovoltaic performances based on the CsPbI3–BP heterostructures are depicted in Fig. 6a. The all-inorganic PSCs with CsPbI3 as the light active layer and CuSCN as the hole transport layer showed the highest PCE of 10.48% with the open-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.8 mA cm−2 and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V. However, after the introduction of the multi-layer black phosphorous, Jsc significantly increased, especially for the CsPbI3–BP1–2 devices (19.3 mA cm−2), with a slight increase in Voc (1.08 V). This change can be attributed to sufficient exciton dissociation due to the decrease in the exciton binding energy as well as the efficient hole extraction by the hole transport layer. In addition, we did not observe an appreciable J–V hysteresis in the corresponding device, as shown in Fig. 6c. Fig. 6d shows the histogram of the reproducibility distribution accounting for 30 devices, exhibiting excellent reproducibility with a normal distribution center located at around 13% and the highest PCE of 14.17% for the CsPbI3–BP1–2 devices. This is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for PSCs with all-inorganic materials, as presented in Table S1.†Fig. 6b shows the incident photovoltaic conversion efficiency (IPCE) of all-inorganic PSCs based on the CsPbI3–BP heterostructures. Compared with pristine CsPbI3, CsPbI3–BP shows an obvious increase in the range from 320 to 720 nm, demonstrating an improvement in exciton dissociation and high yield of free carriers after being blended with multi-layer black phosphorous. Moreover, the integrated Jsc of 18.7 mA cm−2 for the best-performance device is in good agreement with the current density acquired via the J–V measurement (Table 1).

The stability measurement, as shown in Fig. 6e, was carried out for transitional organic–inorganic PSCs with the organic hole transport material Spiro-OMeTAD, inorganic PSCs with Spiro-OMeTAD and all-inorganic PSCs with multi-layer black phosphorous. The measurement was conducted at 80 °C in air (a humidity of ca. 45%) without encapsulation. The maximum power point tracking was carried out to estimate the long-term operational stability. Compared to the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material, the inorganic perovskite as the active layer exhibited an obvious improvement in stability. Moreover, the inorganic PSCs with CuSCN as the hole transport layer were more stable than those with the organic material Spiro-OMeTAD. Both the all-inorganic PSCs based on CsPbI3–CuSCN and the all-inorganic PSCs based on CsPbI3–BP–CuSCN exhibited the best thermal-stability of 85% efficiency retention, demonstrating that CsPbI3, CuSCN and multi-layer black phosphorous possessed excellent stability in a relatively high temperature and humidity environment.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed an effective strategy to enhance the exciton dissociation efficiency by constructing multi-layer black phosphorous–perovskite heterostructures. We achieved the precise and controllable manipulation of layer-variable black phosphorous and investigated the relationship between layer numbers and energy level configuration as well as its effect on the exciton binding energy in the CsPbI3 perovskite. We demonstrated that the introduction of multi-layer black phosphorous could diminish the exciton binding energy and increase the exciton dissociation efficiency of CsPbI3, thus significantly enhancing the photocurrent output. The exciton dissociation and energy photocurrent improvement originated from the increase in the relative permittivity in the multi-layer black phosphorous–perovskite heterostructure due to the efficient dielectric screening effect in tailoring the local dielectric environment and mitigating the electric field at the interface between multi-layer black phosphorous and perovskite. The fabricated multi-layer black phosphorous–CsPbI3 heterostructure solar cell using the inorganic CuSCN HTL exhibits the current density of 19.3 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency of 14.17%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for PSCs using all-inorganic materials.
Methods
Multi-layer black phosphorous and CsPbI3 perovskite film preparation
Bulk black phosphorous powder of around 10 mg was immersed in a 20 ml mixed solution of DMSO (Aladdin, anhydrous) and NMP (Aladdin, 99.5%). The samples were then sonicated for a certain time. For the BP6–7 samples, the ultrasonic experiment was conducted for 10 h with a 3:1 ratio of DMSO and NMP. A further decrease in the thickness of multi-layer black phosphorous flakes was realized by varying the ratio of the mixed solution to 1:1 and 1:3 as well as increasing the ultrasonic aging time to 20 and 30 h. After this, the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm to discard precipitation and 12000 rpm to obtain the centrifugal product. The samples were washed several times with isopropyl alcohol (Aladdin, 99.9%) to remove the solvent residue and finally dispersed in isopropyl alcohol at 5 mg ml−1. The preparation of cubic CsPbI3 was conducted following the method reported by our group. Specifically, 20 w% of PVP (Aladdin, K13-18) was dissolved in the DMF/DMSO mixed solvent and stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The CsPbI3 precursor solution (0.6 M) was synthesized by dissolving stoichiometric CsI (Aladdin, 99.9%) and PbI2 (Aladdin, 99.9%) in the abovementioned solution and stirring at 90 °C for 1 hour. The perovskite precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 film at 2500 rpm for 45 s and sintered at 300 °C for 5 minutes to form the CsPbI3 film.
Device fabrication
FTO substrates (OPV Tech) were first ultrasonically washed and then subjected to oxygen plasma treatment. A compact TiO2 layer (about 50 nm) was deposited on the substrate by spin-coating the mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol (2000 rpm, 30 s) and annealing at 500 °C for 30 minutes. Then, the CsPbI3 light-absorbing layer was deposited on the compact TiO2 layer. To increase the surface coverage of the inorganic perovskite, the substrates coated with TiO2 were preheated at 150 °C. After being cooled down to room temperature, the substrates were immersed in isopropanol for 5 minutes to remove redundant PVP. The multi-layer black phosphorous sample (5 mg ml−1 in isopropyl) was spin-coated onto the CsPbI3 light-absorbing layer at 2000 rpm for 45 s about 12–15 times for fabricating an around 50 nm black phosphorous films. The inorganic hole transport layer of CuSCN was prepared by dissolving 40 mg of CuSCN (Aladdin, 99%) salt in 1 ml of diethyl sulfide (Aladdin, 98%) and deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 50 nm gold counter electrode was prepared by thermal evaporation. The optical active layer and hole transport layer were fabricated in a glove box.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction spectra of the prepared multi-layer black phosphorous samples and inorganic perovskite films were obtained by the Phillips Rigaku D/Max-kA X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation. The HORIBA XploRA instrument was used to obtain the Raman spectra of the multi-layer black phosphorous films. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm with 1.0 mW and a 100× microscope objective. The cross-section morphologies of the perovskite solar cells were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU-70). A high-resolution transition electron microscope (HRTEM, Phillips, Tecnai 20U-Twin) was used to characterize the structures and morphologies of the multi-layer black phosphorous. AFM (Veeco, Icon ScanAsyst) was performed on drop-cast multi-layer black phosphorous samples with Si/SiO2 substrates. The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the multi-layer black phosphorous films and perovskite films were obtained using PerkinElmer LAMBDA 1050. The temperature-dependent PL measurement and time-resolved PL measurement were conducted using FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) equipped with a photomultiplier tube and a Xe lamp. The excitation wavelength was set at 470 nm. A picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-470, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) was employed to detect PL lifetimes with a pulse width of 91.5 ps, a repetition rate of 0.2 MHz, an excitation fluence of 30 nJ cm−2 and a maximum power of 5 mW. The time-constants were acquired by fitting the PL decay curve using the fitting software F900 installed in the time-resolved photoluminescence measurement system FLS980 all functional fluorescence spectrometer. The electrochemical measurements were carried out under 1 sun light using Princeton Parstate 2273A with an alternating current amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 100 to 0.01 kHz, and the equivalent electrical circuit was fitted using the impedance data. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained by the 2400 Series SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments, under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 solar simulator). The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. The J–V measurements were carried out in ambient air. The sweep speeds and delay time of J–V curves were fixed at 40 mV s−1 and 500 ms. The active area was defined as 0.09 cm2. The incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2400) at 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G illumination, and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the NREL. Stability measurements were performed under ambient conditions without encapsulation. Maximum power point tracking was carried out to estimate long-term operational stability. The PCE was obtained using a source meter (Keithley 2400) under a simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. The environmental conditions during operation were maintained at 80 °C with a relative humidity of around 45%.
