    , Accepted 8th June 2017First published on 8th June 2017AbstractA new non-fullerene small molecule acceptor, MPU2, that incorporates dicyano-rhodanine moieties on the edges of thiophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole was designed and prepared. In films MPU2 showed a broad absorption in the 550–850 nm region with an optical energy gap of 1.59 eV. MPU1 and MPU2 were used as small molecule acceptors to construct solar cells. DTS(QxHTh2)2, which has a D1–A–D2–A–D1 structure and complementary absorption in the 470–700 nm region of the solar spectrum, was selected as the electron-donor. All small molecule solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were prepared using these small molecules as acceptors along with a small molecule donor. In these devices, MPU2 showed higher power conversion efficiency than MPU1. The morphology of the active layer was improved by applying thermal annealing and vacuum drying methodologies. The devices for which the latter methodology was used showed 6.28% (MPU1) and 7.76% (MPU2) power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the latter value being one of the highest PCEs for all small molecule fullerene-free solar cells. The results of this study show that vacuum drying treatment of the active layer is better than thermal annealing to achieve high PCE values.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction active layer consisting of a blend of donors (conjugated polymers or small molecules) and acceptors (fullerene derivatives) have progressed significantly in the last decade.1–7 These devices are considered to be one of the effective and sustainable technologies for the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy due to their many advantages, which include easy fabrication, low weight and capability for flexible devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has recently been increased from 5% (ref. 8) to 11.5% (ref. 9) for single BHJ junction OSCs. In most of the high efficiency OSCs based on BHJ active layers, fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM) have been the dominant electron acceptors due to their high electron mobility even in blended films, high electron affinity and isotropic charge transport.10–12 Despite the enormous advances, fullerene derivatives suffer from some inherent drawbacks that include costly purification, weak absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum, difficulty in modifying their energy levels and poor stability.13–16 Therefore, the development of novel alternative acceptors, which not only overcome the aforementioned shortcomings but also imitate the superior electron transport behaviour of fullerenes, is needed. In order to overcome these problems, significant efforts have been devoted to the development of non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs) due to their exclusive properties, which include strong absorption in the visible and near infrared regions of the solar spectrum, readily tunable energy levels and low cost synthesis and purification.17–21 During the past few years, research into NFSMAs has progressed rapidly and PCEs in the range of 9–12% have been achieved.22–28
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based organic semiconducting materials have been shown to be promising donors for OSCs due to several attractive properties of the DPP units,29,30 especially their high electron mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1), good photochemical stability, strong light absorption and facile modulation of their properties by synthesis. Due to their low lying LUMOs, several functionalized DPP-based molecules have been used as the acceptor component in OSCs31–35 although low efficiencies (≤5.0%) were obtained.36,37
An interesting approach to enhance the electron-acceptor ability of the molecules is to conjugate them with 3-ethylrhodanine, which has been widely used as a capping moiety in small molecule donors for OSCs.38–44 The presence of the ethyl group not only inhibits the hydrogen bonding associated with non-alkylated rhodanine but also increases the solubility.
OSCs based on NFSMAs with a polymer donor have shown an impressive PCE of over 12%, which is higher than PCEs of fullerene-based OSCs.25 Nevertheless, several disadvantages of polymer donors hamper their applications in the development of large area NF-polymer solar cells, such as huge molecular weight distribution and inconsistent batch quality. On the other hand, when compared to polymers, small molecule materials are promising for OSCs due to their attractive advantages such as well-defined chemical structure, easily tunable absorption spectra and energy levels, controllable crystalline properties and stable batch quality.1,45,46 However, OSCs based on NFSMAs and SM donors have shown relatively low performance,47–52 with PCE values of 6.03% (ref. 47) and 7.14%.52 Therefore, NF all SM OSCs consisting of bulk heterojunction active layers of both electron donor and electron acceptor conjugated small molecules indeed have a promising future due to the unique properties of small molecules for large area devices.
Recently, we designed an A2–D–A1–D–A2 NFSMA molecule containing a DPP acceptor unit as a core linked to a rhodanine (Rh) acceptor via a thiophene donor linker (denoted as MPU1) and used this material as an acceptor in PSCs along with a D–A polymer as a donor. A PCE of 7.52% was achieved after optimizing the donor to acceptor weight ratio and solvent additive.53 Herein we report the design and synthesis of a new A2–D–A1–D–A2 small molecule comprising a DPP acceptor unit as a core linked to a dicyanomethylene-3-ethylrhodanine–rhodanine (Rh–CN) acceptor via a thiophene donor linker (denoted as MPU2) and the investigation of its optical and electrochemical properties. Dicyanomethylene units were incorporated into the rhodanine moiety in an effort to improve the light harvesting ability of the resultant molecule by extending the π-conjugation further through the molecular backbone.54 The double electron-withdrawing units of both rhodanines and dicyanomethylene fragments may enhance the electron accepting ability of MPU2 as compared to MPU1.

MPU1 and MPU2 were used as electron acceptors along with a D1–A–D2–A–D1 small molecule consisting of dithienosilole and quinoxaline as donor and acceptor units, respectively, denoted as DTS(QxHTh2)2 (chemical structure shown in Scheme 1)55 as the donor for the fabrication of all SM OSCs.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of MPU1, MPU2 and DTS(QxHTh2)2. 
After optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratios and concentration of the solvent additive DIO, the thermally annealed and vacuum dried MPU1:DTS(QxHTh2)2 active layer showed overall PCE values of 5.69% and 6.98%, respectively, whereas the thermally annealed and vacuum dried MPU2:DTS(QxHTh2)2 active layer exhibited overall PCE values of 6.28% and 7.76%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge this is one of the highest values reported to date for all small molecule, fullerene-free BHJ solar cells.56 These results indicate that vacuum drying treatment of the active layer is better than thermal annealing treatment to achieve high PCE.
Experimental and methods
Synthesis of MPU2
To a solution of 5,5′-(2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-dioxo-2,3,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl)dithiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1)57 (0.07 mmol, 40 mg) in glacial acetic acid (12 mL), 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-ethylrhodanine (0.48 mmol, 93 mg) and ammonium acetate (1.34 mmol, 103 mg) were added under an Ar atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 125 °C for 8 hours. The mixture was allowed to cool and the solution was poured into cold water and extracted with chloroform. The organic phase was washed with NaHCO3 and dried with Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting crude mixture was purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluent: 8:2 dichloromethane:toluene). The solvent was removed and the solid was washed with ethanol to give 36 mg (39%) of a greenish brown solid (mp: 290 °C). UV/vis λmax (CH2Cl2)/nm (logε): 714 (4.27), 657 (4.74).

Device fabrication and characterization
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned first with detergent and then ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol sequentially for 10 minutes in each step and dried in a vacuum oven for 1 hour. The anode consisted of glass substrates percolated with ITO, modified by spin coating with a PEDOT:PSS layer (40 nm) as a hole transport layer and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. The photoactive layer was prepared by blending DTS(QxHTh2)2 with MPU1 or MPU2 (total concentration of 16 mg mL−1) with weight ratios of 1:05, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in DIO (3 v%)/CF. The active layer blend solution was spun onto the top of PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 20 s to achieve a thickness of 90 nm ± 5 nm. The films were either dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 2 hours (VD) or thermally annealed (TA) at 100 °C for 10 minutes. A methanol solution of PFN with a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was then spin-coated on top of the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the aluminium (Al) (60 nm) top electrode was thermally deposited onto the active layer at a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask area of 0.20 cm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in an ambient atmosphere without encapsulation. Optimized active layers, i.e., 1:2 weight ratio and DIO/CF solution, were used for the VD and TA. The hole-only and electron-only devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al architectures were also fabricated in a similar way in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with the optical filter was used to give the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. A single crystal Si photovoltaic cell was used as reference for the calibration of the solar simulator. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the device through the light source and the monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with single crystal Si-solar cells.
Results and discussion
Synthesis

MPU1 was prepared as described previously.53 The synthetic procedure for MPU2 is shown in Scheme 2.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic procedure for MPU2. 
Firstly, N,N-dialkylated-thiophene–DPP was converted into bisaldehyde 1 in 76% yield by reaction with LDA followed by treatment with DMF. Dicyanorhodanine (Rh–CN) 2 was prepared in 85% yield from isothiocyanatoethane and malononitrile in the presence of DBU and subsequent addition of ethyl 2-bromoacetate.58 Subsequently, Knoevenagel condensation was carried out between compounds 1 and 2 to produce MPU2 in 39% yield after purification (for full analytical and spectroscopic data, see the ESI†).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (normalized signals) of the MPU1 and MPU2 thin films were recorded to analyse the effect of different terminal acceptor groups on the structural ordering and crystallinity of SMs in the solid state (see Fig. 1). The MPU1 and MPU2 acceptors showed diffraction peaks at 2θ = 6.18° and 6.02°, respectively, corresponding to lamellar spacings of 1.12 nm and 1.04 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 1  X-ray diffraction patterns of MPU1 and MPU2 films. 
Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peak for MPU2 is stronger than that for MPU1, indicating that the molecular ordering and crystallinity of MPU2 is better than that of MPU1, which is beneficial for charge transport and hence increased charge carrier mobility. These results indicate that higher Jsc and FF values for the OSCs based on MPU2 may be expected. Moreover, both MPU1 and MPU2 showed another wide diffraction with peaks centred at 2θ = 22.86° and 22.98°, respectively, corresponding to the (010) π–π stacking with a distance of 0.43 and 0.39 nm for MPU1 and MPU2, respectively. The shorter π–π stacking distance is beneficial for the charge transport.
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework, at the B3LYP/6-31G* level (in vacuo), to determine the optimized geometry for MPU2 (see Fig. S7†). The molecule is almost totally planar, with dihedral angles of less than 5.0° and the rhodanine fragments are almost coplanar with the conjugated system (θ < 1.5°). The distance between the rhodanine sulphur atom and the sulphur of the thiophene ring is 3.23 Å, which is smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radius of sulphur atoms (3.60 Å) and suggests that the interactions between the two S atoms contribute to the planarity of the molecule.
The theoretically calculated HOMO and LUMO energy level values are −5.65 eV and −3.83 eV, respectively. Their isovalue contours for the ground state were also calculated (Fig. S8†) and it was found that both orbitals are spread over the whole π-conjugated system. The optical band gap values for MPU1 and MPU2, 1.57 eV and 1.54 eV, respectively, were calculated using time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the same level (B3LYP/6-31G*).
The broad absorption bands centred at 791 nm (MPU1) and 806 nm (MPU2) obtained from the theoretical UV-vis spectra (Table 1) originate from the S0 → S1 transition and they correspond to excitation from the HOMO to LUMO, thus confirming the charge-transfer character of these absorption bands. In addition, the red shift of the CT band observed for MPU2 with respect to MPU1 is due to the extension of the conjugation in MPU2 by the dicyanovinylene groups.

In solution, MPU2 shows two absorption bands in the wavelength region from 400 to 750 nm. The absorption band at a shorter wavelength, at around 400–500 nm, is attributed to the π–π* transition in the MPU2 backbone whereas the main absorption band from 550 nm to 800 nm is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor moieties in the MPU2 backbone. The ICT band has a well resolved vibronic structure with two maxima at 718 nm (λ0–0) and 686 nm (λ0–1), which are characteristic of a DPP-based SM.59,60 The energy difference of 0.08 eV between the two maxima is consistent with the CC stretching mode strongly coupled to the electronic structure.61
The peaks corresponding to the ICT absorption band in thin film are red-shifted (about 68 nm) when compared to solution and this can be ascribed to the enhanced intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state of SMs in the J-aggregates; this fact is very positive for OSC behavior, as shown recently.62 As compared to MPU1, the ICT absorption band of MPU2 is red-shifted in both solution and thin film as a consequence of the lower band-gap in MPU2, which is due to the higher electron-withdrawing ability of Rh–CN vs. Rh. The optical bandgap for MPU2, estimated from the absorption edge of the absorption spectrum for the thin film, is 1.41 eV (Eoptg = 1240/λonset (eV)). There is a 0.07 eV decrease in Eg when compared with MPU1 (1.48 eV). As the absorption band of MPU2 is located in the near infrared region, suitable polymer or small molecule donors with complementary absorption in the visible region of the spectrum should be chosen carefully to absorb more photons from solar radiation when MPU1 or MPU2 are used as the acceptor for OSCs. As a consequence, a D1–A–D2–A–D1 small molecule was selected as the donor SM and this consisted of dithienosilole and quinoxaline as donor and acceptor units, respectively, denoted as DTS(QxHTh2)2.63 The optical absorption spectra of a DTS(QxHTh2)2 film (Fig. 2) showed a strong absorption band in the range of 470–700 nm where either MPU1 or MPU2 showed low absorption, therefore the blend of DTS(QxHTh2)2 with either MPU1 or MPU2 was expected to display a broad absorption from 350 to 900 nm, which is beneficial for the light harvesting ability of the OSCs.
The normalized absorption spectra of DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 blended films of similar thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 (1:2) and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 (1:2) thin films. 
The DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 (90 nm) and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 (90 nm) blended films both show strong absorption in the wavelength range of 700–900 nm, with the main contribution coming from MPUs in their respective active layers. The absorption efficiency (ηA) of all active layers with the same thickness is determined by using the following expression:54,64  where S(λ) is the photon flux, i.e., the number of photons available at wavelength λ in the AM 1.5G solar spectrum, α is the absorption coefficient and d is the film thickness of the active layer. The values of ηA estimated from the integration of the absorption spectra of blended films from 350 nm to 900 nm are about 36.54% and 38.32% for DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2, respectively. Thus, the number of photogenerated excitons may be expected to be higher for DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 than DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 and one may also expect a higher Jsc value for the OSC based on the former active layer.
To obtain information about the exciton dissociation and transfer in the OSCs, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine DTS(QxHTh2)2, MPU2, MPU1 and their blended thin films were measured (Fig. 4). Excitation at 580 nm led to significant quenching of the PL intensity of DTS(QxHTh2)2 in DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 or MPU1. Moreover, when the blends were excited at 740 nm, the PL intensity corresponding to both MPUs was also significantly quenched. The PL quenching in DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 is slightly better than that in DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1.
 Fig. 4  PL spectra of (a) MPU1 and MPU1DTS(QxHTh2)2 and (b) MPU2 and MPU2DTS(QxHTh2)2 (blue and green colour correspond to excitation wavelengths of 520 nm and 720 nm, respectively). 
These results show that exciton dissociation and charge transfer are efficient in both of the blended active layers. The PL quenching efficiency was obtained by calculating the ratio of the integrated area of the PL peak between the blend films and pure film (donor or acceptor) and a higher value was obtained for DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 than for DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1; this fact may be attributed to the larger LUMO offset in the former compound when compared to the latter.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic (CV) voltammetry measurements (Fig. 5) were performed using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as the standard to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials of MPU1 and MPU2 (Table 2).
 Fig. 5  Cyclic voltammetry of compound MPU2, cathodic (up) and anodic (down) windows. 
Based on these data, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of MPU2 were estimated to be −5.72 eV (HOMO) and −4.15 eV (LUMO) (Fig. 6). The HOMO energy level is up-shifted with respect to that of MPU1, due to the more extended conjugation by the presence of the cyano groups, and the LUMO energy level is down-shifted for MPU2 compared with the values for MPU1 (HOMO = −5.81 eV and LUMO = −3.99 eV). Consequently, the HOMO–LUMO electrochemical gap is lower in MPU2 (1.57 eV) than in MPU1 (1.82 eV). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for DTS(QxHTh2)2 are −5.42 eV and −3.68 eV, respectively, and the optical bandgap is 1.64 eV. The energy offset between the HOMO of DTS(QxHTh2)2 and LUMO of the acceptors is around 1.43 eV and 1.27 eV for MPU1 and MPU2 and, correspondingly, high Voc can be expected for both acceptors.
 Fig. 6  HOMO and LUMO energy levels (calculated from electrochemical data) for MPU1, MPU2 and DTS(QxHTh2)2. 
Moreover, the LUMO offset between DTS(QxHTh2)2 and MPU1 (0.31 eV) or MPU2 (0.47 eV) is higher than the empirical value needed for efficient exciton dissociation (0.30 eV)21 (as shown in Fig. 5). These results indicate that the chosen donor–acceptor combination for OSCs is energetically suitable for efficient charge separation.
Photovoltaic properties
The OSCs based on DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 or MPU1 were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 or MPU1/PFN/Al. The photovoltaic properties of these devices were optimized by changing the different D/A weight ratios and concentration of the DIO solvent additive in the host CF solvent (the photovoltaic parameters for the 1:2 weight ratio and 3 v% DIO/CF processed devices are summarized in Table S1 (ESI)).† It was found that the weight ratio of 1:2 and 3 v% DIO additive gave rise to the best photovoltaic performance, i.e., 4.53% (Jsc = 8.72 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.53) and 5.31% (Jsc = 9.95 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.58) for MPU1 and MPU2 based OSCs, respectively.
In order to improve the PCE of the devices further, two different methods were employed to dry the active layers. The active layers were either thermally annealed (TA) at 100 °C for 10 minutes or dried under vacuum (VD) at room temperature for 2 hours. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimal OSCs based on DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 are shown in Fig. 7a and 8a, respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. It can be seen from the results in Table 3 and Fig. 8a that a high PCE of 6.28%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, Jsc of 11.23 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.59, was obtained for the OSC based on the optimized thermally annealed DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 active layer. For the OSC based on the optimized thermally annealed DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 active layer, an even higher Voc (1.02 V) was obtained and the PCE is about 5.69% with lower Jsc (9.97 mA cm−2) and FF (0.56) values.

The higher Voc value for the OSC based on the MPU1 acceptor may be related to its higher HOMO energy level than MPU2, since the Voc in the BHJ OSC is related to the difference between the energy of the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. Moreover, all the devices showed rectification effect (as shown in dark J–V characteristics in Fig. S9, ESI†).
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1- and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2-based OSCs are presented in Fig. 7b and 8b, respectively. Both devices showed strong IPCE spectra from 350 nm to 850 nm and these closely resemble the absorption spectra of blended films. The IPCE in the 350–650 nm region may be due to a contribution from the DTS(QxHTh2)2 and that at 650–850 nm is due to the MPUs. The IPCE value for the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 device is slightly higher and broader than that for the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 counterpart.
The Jsc values estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra of the device are 9.86 mA cm−2 and 11.09 mA cm−2 for DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1- and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2-based devices, respectively. The higher Jsc value for the MPU2-based OSC than that for the MPU1 counterpart might be attributed to the high ηA value for the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 active layer and also to the higher driving force (large LUMO offset between DTS(QxHTh2)2 and MPU2) for exciton dissociation into free charge carriers. Although it was reported in the literature that a small LUMO offset may also be effective for exciton dissociation into free charge carriers,65 we assume that the large LUMO offset may be one of the reasons for higher Jsc.
The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blended active layers based on MPU1 and MPU2 acceptors were estimated from the dark J–V characteristics of electron-only and hole-only devices (Fig. 9a and b, respectively) using the space charge limited current model.
 Fig. 9  Dark current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of (a) hole-only and (b) electron-only devices based on active layers processed under different conditions. 
Relative to the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 film (μh = 9.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 3.96 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μh/μe = 2.50), the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 film possesses higher mobilities (μh = 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 5.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and more balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 1.97). The higher electron mobility for MPU2 when compared to MPU1 may be related to the higher electron withdrawing ability of RhCN as compared to Rh.66,67 It has been reported in the literature that the introduction of a highly electron deficient terminal A group into the A–π–D–π–A SMs would increase the ground state dipole moment and enhance the intermolecular electronic coupling, which in turn would reduce the molecular carrier reorganization energy68,69 and lead to higher electron mobility for MPU2. The higher and more balanced mobilities in the DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 device could also be the reason for the high Jsc and FF values of the corresponding OSC.
In order to obtain further information about the exciton dissociation and charge collection process, the charge dissociation probability P(E,T), P(E,T) = Jph/Jphsat, was investigated by the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 10) as reported in the literature.70,71 The Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and darkness, respectively, and Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and V is the applied voltage. Jph = Jphsat at high reverse bias voltage, at which all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by the electrodes. The device based on the MPU1 acceptor showed a flat plateau in the region of relatively low Veff and could not saturate at high Veff even up to the maximum measurement voltage. Under short circuit conditions, the calculated charge dissociation probability (Pc = Jsc/Jphsat) is 0.91 for the device with MPU2, which indicates that effective exciton dissociation occurred at the interface between MPU2 and DTS(QxHTh2)2 with suppressed charge recombination. Conversely, the MPU1 device showed a lower Pc value of 0.84, which indicates ineffective exciton dissociation and more charge recombination. Since the Veff is related to the electric field for the extraction of free charge carrier, Veff is not sufficient for the extraction of all the free charge carriers by the electrodes for the device based on DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1.
 Fig. 10  Variation of photocurrent (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) for the PSCs based on different active layers processed under different conditions. 
In an effort to improve the PCE of the OSCs further, rather than using thermal annealing, the optimized active layer processed with the solvent additive was dried under vacuum for 2 hours at room temperature. The J–V characteristics of these devices are shown in Fig. 7a and 8a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. The OSC based on vacuum processed DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU1 and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 active layers showed overall PCE values of 6.98% (Jsc = 11.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.02 V and FF = 0.62) and 7.34% (Jsc = 12.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V and FF = 0.68), respectively. The trends in the difference in the PCE for both acceptors are the same and the effect of different treatments will therefore only be discussed for MPU2-based OSCs. It can be seen from the results in Table 3 that the Jsc and FF values for the OSC based on a vacuum dried active layer are higher than those with thermally annealed active layers, but the Voc value is the same. Moreover, the IPCE values obtained are higher for vacuum dried devices than for thermally annealed devices, thus confirming the higher Jsc value for the MPU2-based device.
The hole and electron mobilities for the vacuum dried active layers were measured in the same way as described above (Fig. 9a and b) and it was found that μh changed slightly (μh = 1.19 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) but μe increased from 5.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the thermally annealed to 7.14 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the vacuum dried MPU2-based blended active layer. This difference may contribute to the improvement in FF from 0.59 for thermally annealed to 0.66 for vacuum dried devices. Moreover, the lower value of μh/μe = 1.66 also indicates the more balanced charge transport in the vacuum dried OSC than in the thermally annealed counterpart.
The Pc values of the OSCs also increased from 0.92 for the thermally annealed active layer to 0.96 for the vacuum dried active layer and this indicates that exciton dissociation and charge extraction are more efficient for the vacuum dried OSC, which leads to an increase in Jsc.
The difference in the charge recombination processes in the OSCs processed with thermally annealed and vacuum dried active layers were investigated by measuring the J–V characteristics at different illumination intensities.
The variation of Voc with illumination intensity (Pin) as the semi-logarithmic plot is shown in Fig. 11a. The slopes of these plots define the degree of trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in BHJ OSCs.72,73
 Fig. 11  Variation of (a) open circuit voltage (Voc) and (b) short circuit current (Jsc) with incident illumination intensity for the solar cells based on TA and VD optimized MPU2:DTS(QxHTh2)2 active layers. 
In the case of trap-assisted recombination, Voc strongly depends on light intensity with a slope close to 2kT/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the electronic charge.74,75 The OSC based on the thermally annealed DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 active layer shows a slope of 1.52kT/q, which indicates strong SRH recombination, while the vacuum dried counterpart gave a smaller slope of 1.38kT/q. The lower kT/q value indicates that OSCs based on a vacuum dried active layer exhibit less charge trapped recombination, which is consistent with the higher Jsc and FF values. The variation of Jsc with Pin is shown in Fig. 11b and follows the relationship Jsc ∝ Pinγ.76 The values of γ estimated from the slope of the Jsc–Pin plots for thermally annealed and vacuum dried layers were around 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. The higher γ value obtained for the vacuum dried active layer OSC signified that the bimolecular recombination was insignificant for this device when compared to the thermally annealed counterpart. These results may indicate that bimolecular recombination and the space charge effect were suppressed for the devices based on vacuum dried active layers.
Finally we have investigated the effect of TA and VD processing on the crystallinity of the active layers, via the XRD measurements, to get information about the difference in the PCE of the resulting devices for MPU1:DTS(QxHTh2)2 and DTS(QxHTh2)2:MPU2 active layers (Fig. 12).
 Fig. 12  XRD patterns of TA (black) and VD (red) processed (a) MPU1:DTS(QxHTh2)2 and (b) MPU2:DTS(QxHTh2)2 thin films. 
It can be seen from this figure that both the active layers showed two diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 6.08° and 2θ = 22.95°, corresponding to the lamellar spacing (100) and π–π stacking (010), respectively. The intensities of both diffraction peaks are higher for the VD processed active layer than the TA counterpart, indicating the higher crystallinity and molecular ordering in the former active layer than in the latter, which is beneficial for charge transport, resulting in a higher PCE of VD processed devices. The values of π–π stacking (010) for TA and VD processed MPU1:DTS(QxHTh2)2 are 0.46 nm and 0.41 nm, respectively, whereas for TA and VD processed MPU2:DTS(QxHTh2)2 are about 0.44 and 0.38 nm, respectively. The smaller value of π–π stacking (010) for VD processed thin films is beneficial for efficient charge transport. From TEM images (Fig. 13), more defined phase separation of donors and acceptors with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network was observed in the VD processed films compared to TA processed thin films.
 Fig. 13  TEM images of TA (left) and VD (right) processed MPU2:DTS(QxHTh2)2 thin films and the scale bar is 100 nm. 
This fact benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport, and thus high FF and PCE.
Conclusions
A new small molecule acceptor, MPU2, has been synthesized and characterized (optical and electrochemical properties). MPU2 incorporates dicyano-rhodanine moieties at the edges of thiophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole and it was used as an electron acceptor along with a small molecule electron donor for the fabrication of solution processed all SM-BHJ organic solar cells. The results were compared with those of devices fabricated with the electron acceptor MPU1 under identical conditions. After optimization of the active layer morphology by thermal annealing of the active layer/vacuum dried active layer processed with the DIO/CF solvent, the MPU1 and MPU2 based devices showed overall PCE values of 5.69%/6.28% and 6.98%/7.76%, respectively. The higher value obtained for the vacuum dried active layers has been ascribed to the improved FF related to the suppression of bimolecular recombination and improved charge transport. Moreover, the PCEs of devices based on MPU2, which are higher than those of MPU1, have been related to the enhanced light absorption, molecular ordering and crystallinity.
