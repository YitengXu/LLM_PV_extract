    , Accepted 18th March 2016First published on 18th March 2016AbstractA new tetrafluoridequinoxaline electron accepting block from a quinoxaline core, which is substituted with a fluorine atom onto its backbone and side chains, was designed. A new copolymer (PBDTT-ffQx) was synthesized from tetrafluoridequinoxaline and benzodithiophene. The copolymer was characterized in detail. The photovoltaic properties were well investigated. A high PCE of 8.6% based on the single junction device was obtained.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention over the last two decades due to a simple device structure, flexibility and low cost fabrication.1–5 To date, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single junction device have risen to 10% in PSCs using a donor–acceptor molecular structure, with a polymer semiconductor as the electron donor (D) and a fullerene derivative as the electron acceptor (A).6–9 High PCEs have been achieved by rationally designing the molecular structures of the conjugated polymers using fusion of aromatic rings,10,11 optimization of side chains12 and extending π-conjugation systems.13,14
In terms of designing new polymeric materials, we paid attention that quinoxaline (Qx) is a unique building block with interesting optoelectronic properties, since Qx can be easily modified by hosting various side chains, such as alkyl chains, aromatic rings and functional groups, etc. Previous research indicated that Qx-based polymers as light-harvesting and electron-donating materials have shown PCEs from 2% to 6%.15–17 However, compared with other popular electron accepting units such as benzothiadiazole (BT) or thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), Qx-derivatives usually harvest solar radiation less efficiently, which results in a lower short circuit current (Jsc).18,19 Lower PCEs of Qx-derivatives should be due to a lower fill factor (FF). High mobility is critical for efficient charge extraction and transport, which is also a precondition for a high FF.20,21 The introduction of fluorine atoms on the conjugated polymer backbone has been successful in improving PCEs in the past few years. Improved molecular ordering by an induced dipole and strong C–F⋯π and F⋯S interaction from inter- and intramolecular interactions can enhance charge carrier mobility, resulting in a higher Jsc and FF.22,23 Recently, it has been reported that conjugated polymers based on fluorinated Qx-derivatives exhibited high PCEs over 7%.24 However, compared to their polymeric counterparts (thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7)), the fluorinated-Qx polymers still do not obtain satisfactory PCEs.25 Meanwhile, the development of interface layers applied in fluorinated-Qx polymeric photovoltaic devices has been little explored. It still remains challenging to fabricate highly efficient and stable devices through interface engineering and new photovoltaic materials.
Recently, our group has reported a conjugated polymer–BDT–m-FPO, comprising 4,8-bis(4-ethylhexyloxy-1-mata-fluorophenyl)-benzodithiophene and di(5-bromothien-2-yl)-5,6-dioctyloxybenzo-[c][1,2,5]-oxadiazole, which reached a promising PCE of 8.0%.26 Compared to similar fluorine-free counterparts, our findings indicated that the introduction of a fluorine atom on the phenyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) unit hardly affected the optical characteristics, but dramatically influenced the active layer's charge mobility, morphology and molecular packing behavior, resulting in a significant improvement of Jsc and FF.27 Inspired by this successful strategy, we envisioned a similar modification strategy by introducing F atom at the meta-position of phenyl substituted fluoroquinoxaline. Meanwhile, in order to collect charges efficiently from the active layer, suitable interface layers are necessary to make the charge collection rate higher than the bimolecular recombination rate.28,29 Zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)30 and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives (PDIN and PDINO) as electron transporting layers (ETLs) have been well applied in conventional devices with Al as the cathode.31,32
Based on the above considerations, we reported a new D–A polymer using 4,8-bis(2-ethylhexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′] dithiophene (BDTT) as the electron donor unit and 5,8-bis(5-thiophen-2-yl)-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(4-ethylhexyloxy-1-mata-fluorophenyl) quinoxaline (ffQx) as the electron acceptor unit, namely PBDTT-ffQx (Scheme 1). Moreover, the molecular structure, film morphologies and optoelectronic properties of the synthesized polymer were well investigated. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated from PBDTT-ffQx:PC71BM blends, using two types of ETLs, ZrAcac or PDIN or PDINO. All devices exhibited PCEs over 8% (8.0% for PDIN, 8.3% for PDINO and 8.6% for ZrAcac) with high FFs of ∼70%.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of PBDTT-ffQx. 
Detailed experimental procedures for the synthesis of the monomers and copolymer are shown in the ESI.† As shown in Scheme 1, PBDTT-ffQx was synthesized through a typical Stille coupling reaction in toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The polymer was carefully purified using continuous Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane and chloroform; the chloroform fraction was recovered and the solution was filtered through a silica gel column. Then, the polymer was precipitated into methanol and collected via filtration. A high polymerization yield of 87% was obtained. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTT-ffQx is 23.5 kDa with a corresponding polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.6, as determined via gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent. Good thermal stability of the copolymer can prevent deformation of the film morphology and ensure the devices' operating temperature under an applied electric field. The thermal stability of the polymer was investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). PBDTT-ffQx possesses excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 351 °C (Fig. S6, ESI†). The molecular weights and thermal data for the polymer are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The absorption spectra of PBDTT-ffQx in solution and solid film were recorded using UV-vis spectroscopy (Fig. 1). The maximum absorption peak for PBDTT-ffQx in chloroform and film states is located at 583 nm and 638 nm, respectively. Compared to the solution state, a 55 nm red shift in the film state indicates strong π–π interaction in the polymer chains. The absorption edge for PBDTT-ffQx is located at 729 nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.7 eV. The electrochemical properties of PBDTT-ffQx were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTT-ffQx can be calculated according to the empirical formula: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) (eV) and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.4) (eV), respectively, corresponding to a HOMO level of −5.36 eV and a LUMO level of −3.56 eV. The low HOMO energy level can mean that PBDTT-ffQx based device would achieve a high Voc. The optical and CV data of the polymer are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).

The typical current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the PBDTT-ffQx based devices are shown in Fig. 3. The devices were fabricated with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/ETLs/Al. Usually, low work function (WF) materials, such as Ca, are used as ETLs for forming efficient hole-blocking and electron injection. Unfortunately, Ca/Al is very chemically active in air, restricting the devices integrating into large-area solar arrays. In order to solve the air-sensitive problem, two types of ETLs (PDIN, PDINO and ZrAcac) with high conductivity and electron affinity have been used as cathode interlayers to replace Ca according to our previous work.31,33,34 The photosensitive layer of PBDTT-ffQx:PC71BM blend was spin coated. The polymer:fullerene ratio, processing solvent (o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) or CHCl3) and processing additive concentration were carefully optimized. As shown in Fig. 3(a), using PDIN as the ETL, under the optimized conditions with the 1:1 D/A weight ratio and a 3% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) volume amount, a PCE of 8.0% was obtained with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 13.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.70. Replacing a PDIN layer with a PDINO layer, the PCE was improved to 8.3%. When ETL was substituted by the ZrAcac film, the device showed a similar FF (∼0.70) but a slightly higher Jsc (14.5 mA cm−2). As a result, a PCE of 8.6% was obtained. The key device parameters and all detailed photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 1 and Table S3 (ESI†). The long-term stability of the polymer:PC71BM based PSCs with PDIN/Al, PDINO/Al and ZrAcac/Al cathodes were investigated by testing the evolution of the PCE parameters as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The devices with PDIN/Al, PDINO/Al and ZrAcac/Al cathodes were found to have good stability and after 192 hours (8 days) retained 87%, 82% and 85% of their initial PCEs; after 8 days, the PCEs keep almost stable. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to verify the accuracy of the above devices under the optimal conditions and the plots are shown in Fig. 3b. According to the results of the EQE spectra, the Jsc calculated value of all the devices are close to the Jsc obtained from the J–V measurement. It is interesting to note that the BDTT-ffQx devices still possess a similar FF (∼0.70) with different kinds of ETLs, which should be ascribed to the balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the polymer. The efficiency of photocurrent generation depends on the balance between charge carrier generation, recombination and transport. Using a space charge limited current (SCLC) method, the μh of BDTT-ffQx with and without DIO were evaluated to be 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobilities of the PBDTT-ffQx blend film with and without DIO were estimated to be 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI†). The higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities of PBDTT-ffQx will reduce the steady state carrier density and suppressing photocurrent loss from charge recombination, which benefits the Jsc and FF.35,36

As shown in Fig. 4a–d, the morphology of the optimized photoactive layer was measured through atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface of the PBDTT-ffQx:PC71BM blend obtained without DIO showed a smooth film, with a root-mean-square (RMS) as low as 0.96 nm. With the addition of DIO, the surface roughness of the film got improved (1.98 nm). The above AFM results indicated that the crystallinity of PBDTT-ffQx:fullerene can be properly enhanced by using a solvent additive, which is beneficial to charge transport.6 As shown in Fig. 4c, without DIO, a little larger phase separation in the PBDTT-ffQx/PC71BM blend film could be observed, which would be harmful for the charge transport/separation at the interface between the donor and acceptor.37 Better nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks can be formed with 3% DIO treatment as shown in Fig. 4d, resulting in a higher Jsc and FF.38

In conclusion, based on a popular electron acceptor unit, quinoxaline, a reasonable introduction of fluorine atoms onto its conjugated backbone and side chains has been reported for the first time in this work. Through Stille coupling copolymerization with the typical electron donor unit (BDTT), a highly efficient D–A conjugated polymer–PBDTT-ffQx has been developed for photovoltaic applications. In order to pursue a suitable WF material for collecting electrons and alleviating the air-sensitive problem, two types of ETLs (PDIN, PDINO and ZrAcac) have been used as cathode interlayers. The photovoltaic results indicated that all PBDTT-ffQx/PC71BM based devices with different ETLs exhibited PCEs over 8.0%, and finally, a PCE of 8.6% is realized with ZrAcac as the ETL. It is also interesting to note that the PBDTT-ffQx based devices still possess the high Voc and FF with different kinds of ETLs. The investigations indicate that ffQx is a new and promising electron accepting unit for constructing high performance photovoltaic materials.
