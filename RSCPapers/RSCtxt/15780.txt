    , Accepted 19th October 2020First published on 19th October 2020AbstractPhotovoltaic–thermal (PV/T) solar collectors convert solar radiation into electrical power and heat. Part of received solar energy can be lost to the atmosphere from the top surface of the PV/T module, especially in windy regions. Thus, in this study, a new vacuum-based photovoltaic thermal (VPV/T) collector is designed and comparatively analyzed with the conventional PV/T collector. The new design differs from the conventional PV/T design by including a vacuum layer above the silicon wafer. Besides, to enhance the heat dissipation from the silicon wafer in the VPV/T design to the thermal absorber, the thicknesses of ethylene-vinyl acetate and tedlar polyester tedlar layers underneath the silicon wafer are decreased. A comprehensive 3D conjugate thermal model is developed and validated. The comparison is conducted under steady and transient conditions. The effects of Reynolds number (Re), wind speed, glass emissivity, and vacuum pressure are investigated. And finally, exergy analysis results for both designs are compared. The results showed that the new VPV/T collector has accomplished a 26.6% increase in the thermal power without changing the electrical power gain at Re of 50 and solar irradiance of 1000 W m−2. In addition, the vacuum pressure degradation from 0.01 Pa to 10 Pa slightly decreases the gained thermal power of the new VPV/T collector. A further increase in the vacuum pressure from 10 Pa to 1.013 × 105 Pa significantly decreases the gained thermal power with a slight increase in the electrical power. Furthermore, the total predicted VPV/T and the conventional PV/T exergy efficiency are 39.6% and 32%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Solar thermal energy is the most popular renewable source of energy.1 Approximately 3.85 million exajoules of energy is received from the sun and absorbed by the Earth annually.2 Solar radiation can be harnessed with two main techniques: (i) solar electricity generation using photovoltaic (PV) technology3 and (ii) solar thermal systems using solar thermal collectors. Both techniques exploit sun rays, on a small- or large-scale solar park. PV/thermal (PV/T) systems simultaneously generate electricity and thermal energy.4,5 Thermal energy is gained through the cooling of the PV system.6 Therefore, the overall conversion efficiency of the PV/T system can be improved. Hence, the PV/T system consists of a PV module attached to a thermal absorber. PV/T systems are utilized for domestic heating and electricity supply. Sultan and Efzan7 extensively reviewed recent PV/T advances and applications. However, a further improvement in the overall conversion efficiency must be done.
The performance of PV/T systems can be enhanced by improving the PV electrical performance or the thermal heat gain by the cooling fluid or both.8 Pang et al.9 performed a comprehensive analysis of the performance of PV/T systems regarding the working fluid, geometry, and terrestrial conditions. Fuentes et al.10 experimentally compared the commercial PV and the PV/T systems. They reported an overall conversion efficiency (thermal and electrical) for the PV/T system up to 80%.
The main challenge in PV/T systems is to enhance the usability of the existing source of energy in a reliable and effective way. Several studies compared different operating conditions and working fluids for PV/T collectors.7 Numerous review papers considered the application of nanofluids in PV/T systems.11,12 Khanjari et al.13 numerically studied the performance of Ag and alumina nanofluids and compared them with the base fluid (water). The influence of the nanoparticle loading ratio and coolant velocity on the thermal and electrical performance was considered and exergy analysis was performed. They reported that both the energy and exergy efficiencies were enhanced by increasing the nanoparticle loading. Sardarabadi et al.14 studied the utilization of SiO2-water nanofluid in the PV/T system. The total conversion efficiency with 1 wt% and 3 wt% nanofluids was improved by 3.6% and 7.9%, respectively.
Recent advancements led to modifying the structure of the PV/T system for improving the overall performance. Hassani et al.15 theoretically evaluated the life cycle exergy of PV/T for three different system configurations. In their work, water and Ag/water nanofluids were employed as optical filters. They proved that using the optical filter provided a substantial quantity of thermal energy. Ahmed and Radwan16 used a nanocomposite to modify the PV structure in the PV/T system. Higher heat dissipation from PV was reported with higher system efficiency. Sopian et al.17 studied an improved PV/T system design with double passes of air. The double-pass PV/T showed superior overall performance compared to single-pass PV/T. Nahar et al.18 introduced an innovative PV/T system by excluding the absorber plate. Consequently, the thermal part was attached directly to the rear side of the PV module by thermal grease. The performance of the PV/T system under different operating conditions was evaluated. The data showed that the overall efficiency of the new system reaches 84.4%.
Literature shows that the PV/T technology has much potential for a broad range of applications as it generates electricity and thermal energy with high overall performances. Moreover, the PV/T technology has the benefit of a limited carbon footprint in comparison with two separated PV systems and thermal collectors. However, it is evident that PV/T is not a mature technology yet. Previous literature was mainly concentrated on two main aspects. First, it focused on finding an optimal PV cooling method; second, it focused on enhancing the structure of PV materials for higher electrical efficiency.
In recent PV/T investigations, the backside of the thermal absorber was isolated to increase the thermal energy. However, the heat loss from the top surface of the PV/T module can be a dominant factor, especially in windy regions with higher solar radiation whilst moderate or lower ambient temperatures. Under these weather conditions, a substantial amount of heat can be lost to the atmosphere from the upward surface of the PV/T module. And due to the transparency requirements of the top PV/T surface, no conventional opaque thermal insulation can be utilized. Furthermore, the conventional structure of the polycrystalline PV module has two layers of EVA and TPT. These two layers are located underneath the silicon wafer and cause an increase in the PV module temperature and lower heat dissipation to the water in the thermal absorber. Consequently, a significant decrease in the system's total efficiency may occurs.
Therefore, this study focuses on decreasing the thermal energy loss from the top surfaces of the PV modules in PV/T systems. This target can be achieved by utilizing a vacuum layer above the PV module. This idea reduces the heat loss from the top surface of the PV module. Therefore, a higher thermal efficiency can be accomplished. It is worth mentioning that the new approach could lead to slight reduction in the gained electrical power. Therefore, the conventional layers of the polycrystalline PV cell are adjusted. The proposed VPV/T collector is compared with the conventional design of the PV/T collector under the same conditions. Hence, a comprehensive 3D conjugate heat transfer model with detailed exergy analysis is developed. The model is validated with results in the literature. The results of steady-state, transient, and exergy analyses for both designs are compared under different operating conditions. Furthermore, the effect of vacuum pressure on the thermal performance of the VPV/T design is estimated.
2. Physical model
In this study, the conventional PV/T and the new VPV/T systems are presented in Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. In the conventional PV/T design, the PV module is attached to a thermal absorber. This thermal absorber is used to regulate the module temperature using pure water as a circulating fluid. The PV module contains a glass layer, a top EVA layer, a silicon wafer, a bottom EVA layer and finally a TPT layer with thicknesses of 3 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.2 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.3 mm, respectively.19 The silicon layer generates electricity and it is surrounded by a transparent EVA layer to protect it and accomplish electrical insulation.20 The EVA and TPT layers have thermal conductivities of 0.311 W m−1 K−1 and 0.15 W m−1 K−1, respectively which cause a significant decrease in heat transfer to the water in the thermal absorber.19 Besides, this results in a higher PV cell temperature and lower heat gain and high thermal energy loss. The higher the cell temperature, the lower the gained electric power and the lifetime. Furthermore, in windy regions, the thermal energy loss to the atmosphere from the PV top surface decreases the system's thermal efficiency.

The modified VPV/T module is illustrated in Fig. 2. The two main differences between the conventional PV/T and the VPV/T designs are the vacuum layer above the silicon wafer and different EVA layer thicknesses. The 0.3 mm thickness vacuum layer is used to decrease the heat loss from the top surface of the silicon wafer, especially in windy regions. In addition, this allows the increase in the thermal heat gain in the VPV/T design. However, this vacuum layer could result in a higher photovoltaic module operating temperature in the VPV/T design and decreases the gained electrical power. To avoid this risk, a high heat dissipation rate from the silicon wafer to the cooling water should be achieved. Therefore, the thermal resistance for EVA and the TPT layer underneath the silicon wafer should be decreased. This forces the heat generated in the silicon wafer by solar radiation absorption to rapidly dissipate to the water in the thermal absorber. Recently, the first author of this paper investigated two different methods to accomplish this target. The first method involved the use of a nano-composite EVA layer underneath the silicon layer. In addition, the TPT layer was replaced with an aluminium tedlar sheet. The nano-composite layer was formed by adding boron nitride nanoparticles into the EVA matrix.16 This enhances the conduction heat transfer through the EVA layer underneath the silicon wafer without affecting the light characteristics and the electrical insulation characteristics. The second method is decreasing the thickness of this layer from 0.5 mm to 0.2 mm.19 The latter thickness is commercially available in the market for this application and cost-effective compared to the larger thickness. Also, the smaller thickness decreases the thermal resistance at the backside. The second method is most effective compared to the first one. Therefore, it has been applied in this work.
A composited edge sealed vacuum insulated glazed enclosure is proposed to keep the vacuum pressure for longer life without performance degradation. An array of pillars made of stainless-steel with a diameter of 6 mm and spaced at 50 mm are used to sustain the vacuum gap and prevent glass breakage. These dimensions are achieved based on the real fabrication of a vacuum-based solar thermal collector in ref. 21. The module area used in the present study is 455 × 455 mm2. The composite edge seal of 10 mm for the vacuum enclosure utilized was the invention of Dr Memon who ultrasonically soldered the primary seal, at low-temperature around 200 °C, made of composite CS-186 or Sn–Pb–Zn–Sb–AlTiSiCu in the ratio of 56:39:3:1:1 by wt% and the secondary seal made of reinforced steel epoxy.22–24 This 10 mm wide composite edge sealed vacuum glazing was integrated in the VPV/T module. Therefore, the active PV area in both designs is around 435 × 435 mm2. This area includes the cross-sectional area of 7 × 7 support pillars spaced at 50 mm. The edge sealing with 10 mm in the VPV/T design is considered as the EVA interval to avoid the silicon wafer fracture at the sides in the PV/T design. Therefore, the solar cell areas in both designs are nearly the same (with neglecting the pillar effect in the VPV/T design). A serpentine flow field with a channel height and width of 1 mm and 50 mm respectively is used for cooling the PV in both the PV/T and the VPV/T modules. An aluminum channel with 1 mm wall thickness and 5 mm separation between each flow channel is used for the thermal absorber. Table 1 shows the detailed dimensions of the PV/T and the VPV/T systems along with the thermophysical properties of each layer.

3. Theoretical analysis
In the present analysis, the complete computational domains shown in Fig. 1 and 2 are modelled. In the PV/T and VPV/T systems, the received solar radiation is partially absorbed, transmitted, and reflected based on the optical properties of each layer. The incident solar radiation on the glass cover is partially absorbed and mostly transmitted to the top EVA layer due to the higher transparency of the cover. The absorbed part causes an increase in the glass cover temperature while the transmitted part is partially absorbed by the top EVA and mostly transmitted to the silicon wafer due to the higher transparency of the top EVA layer. Also, the absorbed portion increases the top EVA temperature. The transmitted solar radiation from the top EVA is mostly absorbed in the silicon wafer. This absorbed part is partially converted to electricity in the silicon wafer and the remaining is converted to heat. The portion converted to heat increases the cell temperature and declines the electrical efficiency. To keep a safe PV operating temperature, an efficient thermal management technique should be applied.
In the proposed design, conduction, convection, and radiation heat exchanges should be simultaneously considered. The following assumptions are adopted.
1. The solid domains were considered homogeneous and their properties were temperature independent.
2. The contact resistance resulting from the attachment of the module components is neglected.
3. The back sides of the PV/T and VPV/T modules are completely isolated to achieve the maximum benefit of thermal energy for domestic hot water supply.
4. The flow in the mini-scale serpentine channel thermal absorber is assumed to be laminar (the maximum used Reynolds number is 150) and incompressible.
5. Temperature-dependent water properties are assumed considering higher order polynomial equations from ref. 25.
The unsteady three-dimensional energy equation from the solid layers is represented as follows:26 (1)where ki, Ti and qi are the thermal conductivity, elemental temperature, and heat generation, respectively. The heat generation represents the absorption of solar radiation in the glass, the top EVA, and the silicon wafer. The heat generation in the layers below the silicon wafer is neglected due to the low transparency of silicon wafer. Therefore, eqn (1) is solved for all the solid domains, including the edge sealing, pillar aluminium channel materials. The values of qi in the glass, top EVA, and silicon layer are calculated by eqn (2)–(4), respectively. The absorptivity, reflectivity, and transmittivity of each layer are presented in Table 2. (2) (3) (4)where V is the layer volume, A is the surface area of the layer and G is the solar radiation falling on the top surface of the module. The cell electrical efficiency is expressed as follows:27 ηsc = ηref(1 − βref(Tsc − Tref))(5)where ηref is the PV efficiency at a standard temperature Tref of 25 °C. And Tsc is the solar cell operating temperature. For the thermal modelling of the PV/T and VPV/T modules, eqn (5) is used to estimate the cell efficiency as a function of silicon wafer temperature. The PV specifications under standard testing conditions (STC) for crystalline silicon solar cells are a typical reference efficiency of 20% (AM1.5) at a reference temperature of Tref = 298 K with a βref of 0.0045 K−1.28 These parameters were used as the same for both PV/T and VPV/T to clarify the effect of vacuum layer addition. Based on eqn (4) and (5), the term qsc depends on the electrical efficiency of the cell. This efficiency is a function of the PV module temperature. And this operating temperature is also a function of the internal heat generation in the silicon wafer. Therefore, to solve this problem, an iterative technique is applied. The details of this iterative technique are explained in the author's earlier work.16

For the fluid domain in the mini-scale serpentine thermal heat absorber, the governing equations of the unsteadiness, laminar flow, and incompressibility can be written as follows:
Continuity equation: (6)
Momentum equations in x, y, and z directions: (7) (8) (9)
Energy equation:
The fluid energy equation is expressed in the following form (10)where ρ, μ, U, V, W and P are the water density, viscosity, velocities in x, y, and z directions, and the coolant pressure, respectively.
The surface to surface (S2S) model is used to account for the radiation process in the vacuum gap as reported in ref. 30. In this region, the heat exchange between the top surface of the EVA layer and the bottom surface of the glass layer mostly occurs with radiation, especially at low pressure as explained in ref. 21 and 31. This model considers the emissivity effect and the view factor in the calculations. The view factors are automatically estimated from the model dimensions and ordinates from the computational domain geometry. Therefore, the heat exchange mostly occurs by radiation through the vacuum and by conduction in support pillars and the edge sealing. The gas conduction effect can be neglected if the internal pressure is less than 0.1 Pa.32 In this work, the gas thermal conductivity is considered as a function of pressure, as shown in eqn (11). The inner surface of the tempered glass cover is assumed to have an emissivity of 0.18 as usually used in vacuum glazing. The vacuum layer thermal conductivity is estimated as follows:33 (11)where T is the absolute average temperature between the two sides of the vacuum layer, lvacuum is the vacuum gap thickness (0.0003 m in this study), and P is the vacuum pressure in Pa. Besides, ko is the reference air conductivity (0.026 W m−1 K−1). The S2S model details exist in the ANSYS theory guide.30
To investigate the effect of vacuum pressure on the module temperature, eqn (11) is used to estimate the vacuum layer thermal conductivity as a function of vacuum pressure and vacuum gap average temperature. The vacuum layer thermal conductivity increases with increasing the vacuum pressure at the same vacuum gap thickness and vacuum temperature. This estimated thermal conductivity is updated for the vacuum layer at each simulation and then all governing equations are iteratively solved until reaching the convergence criteria.
3.1. Module characterization
To compare the performance of each design under specific operating conditions, several characterization parameters are used.34 The electrical PV power is estimated using: Pel = ηsc × G × αsc × τtop × Asc(12)where the electrical efficiency, ηsc, is estimated by eqn (5). And G, αsc, τtop and Asc are the received solar radiation by the collector, solar cell absorptivity, PV module packing factor, and solar cell area, respectively. The solar radiation receiving area which is occupied by the solar cell is about 0.188 m2 and 0.189 m2 for the PV/T and VPV/T systems, respectively. This small difference has resulted from the area occupied by 49 support pillars.
The cooling heat sink attached to the photovoltaic thermal collector consumes a pumping power to overcome the friction. The friction power is estimated as follows: (13)where ṁ and ΔP are the coolant flow rate and the pressure drop in the thermal absorber, respectively. The net gained electric power generated by the PV module is estimated as follows: Pnet = Pel − Pfriction(14)
The thermal heat gained by the collector can be estimated as follows: Pth = ṁ × Cp,w × (Tout − Tin)(15)where Tout and Tin are the water outlet and inlet temperatures, respectively. The module thermal efficiency can also be estimated as follows:35 (16)
The heat loss from the top surface of the VPV/T and PV/T modules is estimated using the following equation: Qth,loss = hw × Ag × (Tg − Ta) + εg × σ × Ag × (Tg4 − Ts4)(17)where hw, Ag, Tg, Ta, εg, and Ts are the heat transfer coefficient due to the wind effect in W m−2 K−1, glass area in m2, glass temperature in K, ambient temperature in K, glass external emissivity, and sky temperature in K, respectively.
The term hw is estimated using the correlation as follows.36 hw = 5.7 + 3.8 × Uw(18)where Uw is the wind speed in m s−1. Based on eqn (18), it is evident that increasing the wind speed significantly increases the convection heat transfer coefficient from the top surface of the PV module. Hence, it could influence the thermal performance of both designs. Therefore, the performance of both systems is compared at a wide range of wind speeds up to 6 m s−1.
The simulation is conducted at various values of inlet water velocities. And the results are depicted as a function of flow Reynolds number expressed as flows: (19)where Vin and Dh are the water velocity normal to the inlet section and channel hydraulic diameter, respectively.
3.2. Exergy assessments
Exergy assessment is used to estimate the exergy losses and estimate the total system exergy efficiency. The electrical energy (Exel) is considered as pure exergy.37,38 The thermal exergy (Exth) is estimated as follows:37,39 (20)Tf,in and Tf,out are the coolant inlet and outlet temperatures, respectively. The Carnot factor is also expressed as a function of Tm. The term Tm is calculated by:37 (21)
Then, the term Exth is expressed as follows: (22)
The coefficient of radiation exergy (Ψs) is used to calculate the exergy gain from the solar radiation. Ψs is described as follows:40 (23)The term TSun is the Sun solar radiation temperature of 6000 K.1,39 At that point, the solar radiation rate of exergy per unit surface area (esol) is estimated as follows: esol = Ψs × G(24)
Hence, the electrical, thermal, and total exergy efficiency ξel, ξth, and ξ are calculated using eqn (25)–(27),37 respectively: (25) (26) (27)
The climatological parameters are considered variable with time for the transient simulation, while for steady-state conditions, these values are considered constant corresponding to each simulated case.
3.3. Boundary conditions
Steady-state and transient boundary conditions of the PV/T and VPV/T systems are applied as two different conditions. In the steady-state, uniform water velocity with a temperature of 30 °C is assumed at the inlet of the thermal absorber for both designs. The heat generation in each layer of the PV/T and VPV/T systems was estimated at fixed solar radiation of 1000 W m−2. The values of the coolant velocities are changed according to flow Reynolds numbers ranging from 10 to 150. Zero (gauge) pressure is defined at the absorber outlet. Heat loss by convection and radiation is applied at the top surface. Thermally coupled boundary conditions are used to share the temperatures and heat fluxes at the interfaces between every two consequent layers. Furthermore, no-slip conditions are considered for faces between the fluid and solid regions. Finally, adiabatic boundary conditions are taken at the sides and the back side of the thermal absorber to achieve the highest possible thermal energy gain. This assumption can be experimentally confirmed by efficient thermal insulation. In the transient boundary condition, a typical summer day with variable weather conditions is taken to compare the collector's performance in Cairo, Egypt (30.0444° N, 31.2357° E) on 10th of July 2019. These conditions are applied as transient profiles.
3.4. Mesh independence test
Before conducting the simulation work, a mesh independent test is performed for both the conventional PV/T and new VPV/T designs at a Reynolds number of 10 and 150. This test confirmed that the extracted results are not affected by changing the number of elements. Generally, it is noticed that changing the number of elements slightly changes the gained thermal energy. However, increasing the number of elements to 1.36 and 1.23 millions for the PV/T and the VPV/T systems respectively changes the predicted pressure drop. And further increasing the number of elements beyond these values slightly influences the anticipated results of the pressure drop and gained thermal energy. However, this increase in the number of elements increases the computational time. Therefore, these numbers of elements are adopted to simulate the two cases of the PV/T and the VPV/T systems as seen in Table 3.

3.5. Model validation
The developed thermal model is validated in several pieces of research conducted by the author.41 Additionally, the predicted results of this simulation are compared with experiments of ref. 42 and numerical work of ref. 43. During the validation, the current model is modified to simulate the same problems in ref. 42 and 43 with the same dimensions, flow conditions, and meteorological conditions. Fig. 3 shows the predicted results of PV temperature, coolant outlet temperature, and PV electrical power in Fig. 3a, b and c, respectively. A high accuracy is observed with a maximum relative deviation from the results in ref. 42 around 3.3%, 1.6% and 2.4% for the estimated PV temperature, coolant outlet temperature, and generated PV electrical power, respectively.

The flow length in the last serpentine turn is around 420 mm. Therefore, the ratio of the flow length and the flow channel hydraulic diameter is 210 mm. Thus, fully developed flow can be considered. For a rectangular cross-sectional channel, the fully developed analytical velocity profile for a channel has an aspect ratio of 50, and the maximum velocity is located at the channel centre with a magnitude of 1.5 times the inlet mean velocity.44 For all the simulated results, the ratio between the maximum outlet velocity and the uniform inlet velocity is checked and found to be around 1.496 times the inlet mean velocity.
4. Results and discussion
The results section is divided into five subsections. In Section 4.1, the effect of changing the water flow rate on the performance of the conventional PV/T and the new VPV/T systems is presented. Section 4.2 presents a comparison between both systems under different wind speed conditions. Section 4.3 describes the effect of different design parameters such as the emissivity of surfaces facing the vacuum gap and the effect of vacuum pressure on the thermal analysis of the vacuum VPV/T system. Section 4.4 describes the transient comparison of the new VPV/T system and the conventional PV/T system. Finally, detailed exergy analyses for both numerically validated designed models are presented in Section 4.5.
4.1. Effect of flow rate

Fig. 4 shows the comparative analysis of the composite edge sealed VPV/T collector with the conventional PV/T collector at different cooling water flow rates and a constant value of solar irradiance (G) of 1000 W m−2, vacuum pressure (P) of 0.01 Pa, ambient temperature (Ta) of 30 °C, and wind speed (Uw) of 2 m s−1 as an example. The variation of average silicon layer temperature with the flow rate is presented in Fig. 4a. It can be seen that, at low values of water flow rate, the PV temperature is higher by 20 °C when the VPV/T system is applied, and this is due to the vacuum gap which reduces the amount of heat loss through the glass and thus the cell temperature is increased. The difference in cell temperature between both systems decreases with the increase in the water flow rate. This is due to the increase of the convective heat transfer coefficient accompanying the increase of Reynolds number. It is worth mentioning that with the increase in the flow Re number to more than 50, relatively the same PV temperature is achieved while the coolant outlet temperature for the VPV/T is much higher. This clarifies that for the new VPV/T system, the same electrical power can be generated with higher heat gain at this Re number.

The maximum PV temperature has a similar trend to the average cell temperature. For instance, in Fig. 4b at Re = 10, VPV/T predicts the maximum solar cell temperature which is 30 °C higher than that of the PV/T collector system. Fig. 4c shows the variation of the top glass surface temperature with Re. The glass temperature decreases with the increase of Re and becomes lower when the VPV/T system is employed for all values of Re. This is due to the insulation implemented by the air gap, which prevents the heat from moving towards the glass wall and forces it to move through the bottom EVA layer. The result of this effect can also be seen in Fig. 4d that represents the water outlet temperature at various Re. As the heat is forced to move through the EVA layer to the cooling water, the temperature of water increases when VPV/T is used compared to the PV/T system. This is also due to the width reduction of the EVA layer.
The variation of gained thermal power, collector top surface heat loss, and the gained heat gain versus Re is depicted in Fig. 5. The gained thermal power, calculated by eqn (15), increased with the increase of mass flow rate, ṁ and outlet temperature, Tout. It can be seen from Fig. 5a, at the same Re, thermal heat gained is higher when the VPV/T is used compared to the PV/T system due to the increase of water outlet temperature resulting from lower heat loss. Heat loss from the PV system depends on the convection and radiation from the top glass layer to the surroundings as seen in eqn (17). Fig. 5b shows the variation of heat loss versus Re. Under the same conditions, VPV/T shows a reduction in the heat loss compared to the conventional PV/T system, and this is due to the decrease of the top glass temperature because of the vacuum gap.
 Fig. 5  Influence of (a) thermal heat gain, (b) heat loss power, and (c) cell net gain at different Re. 
Water cooling is achieved using a pump. To estimate the power consumption by this pump, the friction power is estimated. In addition, the variation of the photovoltaic cell net gained power with Re is shown in Fig. 5c. The photovoltaic net gained power is estimated as the difference between the photovoltaic power and friction power consumed by the pump for the same module area and is estimated by eqn (14). From the calculated data, the ratio of the friction power consumed by the pump to the generated electrical power represents a maximum of 0.03% at Re of 150 for the conventional PV/T. The friction power is very small and nearly the same for both PV/T and VPV/T designs because of the same flow conditions and heat sink design are used.
Moreover, the conventional PV system gives higher solar cell power gained compared to the vacuum VPV/T system at lower Re. This is because, for the same value of solar radiation, cell power gained depends on cell efficiency which decreases with the increase of cell temperature that is lower in the case of the conventional PV/T system. However, when increasing the Re number up to around 70, no significant difference in the electrical gained power can be depicted. This means that at higher Re, VPV/T collectors are favourable compared to the PV/T collector because of the accomplishment of higher thermal energy gain.
The local temperature distribution provides an indication of the system performance and thermal stress. Therefore, the temperature distributions of the top glass layer for the new VPV/T system and the conventional PV/T system are presented in Fig. 6 with dynamic values of Re. As can be seen in Fig. 6, when conventional PV/T is used, the local temperature is lower at the left top corner at the cooling water inlet and increases along with the top glass cover and reaches its highest value at the right top corner near the water outlet. When the VPV/T system is employed, the temperature is distributed uniformly along with the cell with higher values around the edges due to the edge sealing made by indium sealing and at the supported stainless-steel pillars. This thermal bridge formed by pillars and edge sealing results in a large percentage of heat loss in the VPV/T systems to the surface. This amount of heat loss can be decreased in large area collectors with lower conductive edge sealing and ultra-fine pillars. The local temperature declines with the increase of Re. At Re of 10, the maximum and minimum detected temperatures are 55 °C and 34 °C, respectively. It is found that increasing Re to 150 decreases the maximum and minimum observed temperature to 40 °C and 30 °C, respectively.

4.2. Effect of wind speed
The effect of wind speed on the performance of the VPV/T system compared with the conventional PV/T system is discussed at Re of 10, G = 1000 W m−2 and cavity vacuum pressure of 0.01 Pa. The effect of wind speed on the average solar cell, maximum solar cell, top glass, and outlet water temperatures is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from Fig. 7a and b that the average solar cell temperature and maximum solar cell temperature decrease with the increase of wind speed, as the heat transfer losses increase through the glass layer. The conventional PV/T system shows lower average solar cell temperature compared to the new VPV/T system. Top glass surface temperature is dependent on the convection heat transfer coefficient of the surrounding air. Increasing the wind speed increases the convective heat transfer coefficient from the top glass surface to the atmosphere. Therefore, increasing the wind speed leads to a decrease in the top glass surface temperature as shown in Fig. 7c. Fig. 7d shows the variation of cooling water outlet temperature with wind speed. Cooling fluid outlet temperature declines with the increase of wind speed as the thermal power decreases. It is worth mentioning that increasing wind speed significantly decreases all these parameters, whilst these parameters are slightly affected by the wind speed in the VPV/T system. This verifies that the proposed VPV/T system provides stable output parameters at different wind speeds.
 Fig. 7  Comparison between VPV/T and PV/T for (a) average PV temperature, (b) maximum PV temperature, (c) top glass surface temperature, and (d) water outlet temperature at different wind speed. 

Fig. 8 shows the impact of wind speed on the gained thermal power, heat loss, and photovoltaic cell net gained power at Re of 10, G of 1000 W m−2 and cavity vacuum pressure of 0.01 Pa. From Fig. 8a, the gained thermal power decreases with increasing the wind speed as the water outlet temperature decreases. The gained thermal power is higher when the VPV/T system is used compared to the conventional PV/T system. The heat loss increases with the wind speed, as depicted in Fig. 8b. The conventional PV/T system shows higher heat loss compared to the new VPV/T system. Fig. 8c indicates the variation of the photovoltaic cell net gained power, calculated from eqn (14), at various wind speeds. The cell net gained power increases with the increase of wind speed as it depends on the solar cell efficiency that increases with the decrease of the solar cell temperature. The conventional PV/T system shows higher values of photovoltaic cell net gained power compared to the VPV/T system. Furthermore, at a wind speed of 1 m s−1, Re of 10 and G of 1000W m−2, the generated electric power is around 32 W and 28 W for the conventional PV/T and the new VPV/T systems, respectively. A total of 12.5% of reduction in the generated electric power is observed with the new VPV/T collector system, whilst the thermal heat gain increased from 39 W to 68 W for the conventional PV/T and the new VPV/T systems, respectively. An increase of total 74.35% in the thermal heat gain is accomplished by using the new VPV/T system. The heat loss under this condition of lower Re is higher than the heat gain and much dominant in the conventional PV/T system. For instance, the heat loss is around 96 W and 67 W for the conventional PV/T and the new VPV/T system, respectively. This higher heat loss is attributed to the lower Re number of 10 through this simulated part.

The wind speed effect on the local temperature distribution of the top glass surface is illustrated in Fig. 9 at Re of 10. At Uw = 1 m s−1 and with the conventional PV/T system, the maximum temperature is located at the outlet of the cooling channel whereas the minimum temperature is located at the cooling water inlet position. However, using the VPV/T system leads to a gradual decrease in temperature from the maximum to the minimum temperature. The local temperature decreases with increasing the wind speed, and the VPV/T system shows more uniformity in the temperature distribution compared to the conventional system.

Table 4 shows the variation of the difference between the water outlet and inlet temperature at different Re and wind speeds for both designs. It is evident that the new VPV/T system achieved higher coolant rise temperature compared to the conventional PV/T system under the same conditions.

4.3. Design parameters for the new VPV/T system
In this section, the effect of different design parameters, namely top EVA emissivity, glass coating emissivity, and air gap vacuum pressure on the performance of the vacuum PV/T system is discussed. Experiments in this section are conducted at Re = 10; wind speed of 2 m s−1, and solar radiation of 1000 W m−2.

4.3.1. Effect of the emissivity coating on the top EVA layer. 
In the VPV/T collector system, the cavity vacuum gap separates the top EVA and the glass layers. The emissivity of the top EVA layer affects the heat transfer from the EVA layer to the glass layer through the vacuum layer. Fig. 10 shows the effect of changing the top EVA layer emissivity of the coating on the average solar cell, maximum solar cell, top glass layer, water outlet temperatures, and thermal and electrical power. In the current section, the emissivity of the EVA layer changes from 0.18 to 0.9 whilst the inner glass layer was coated with L-e coating with an emissivity of 0.18. It is noticed that an average PV temperature slightly decreases with the increase of EVA emissivity, as shown in Fig. 10a. This is because of the enhancement that occurs in the heat transfer from the EVA layer by the increase of the emissivity. However, the difference in the average cell temperature is predicted to be 1.1 °C when the emissivity changes from 0.18 to 0.9. Consequently, the maximum cell temperature decreases with the increase of EVA emissivity as the heat transferred from the layer increases. The top glass layer temperature increases with the increase of EVA emissivity as the heat loss increases and more heat transfers through the glass layer as depicted in Fig. 10c. Water outlet temperature is dependent on the solar cell temperature, so it decreases with the increase of EVA layer emissivity as the solar cell temperature decreases. The thermal and electrical net power variation with the EVA emissivity is shown in Fig. 10d. Thermal power decreases from 62.76 W at ε = 0.18 to 61.31 W at ε = 0.9, and this is due to the decrease in the water outlet temperature, while electrical net power increases from 28.54 W at ε = 0.18 to 28.63 W at ε = 0.9 and this is because of the reduction of solar cell temperature with the increase of EVA emissivity that leads to an increase in the solar cell efficiency. Based on these results, it is favourable to use the common available EVA layer without further coating for lower cost.

4.3.2. Effect of coating emissivity of the glass cover. 
The effect of the emissivity of the glass side facing the vacuum layer on average solar cell temperature, maximum solar cell temperature, top glass surface layer temperature, water outlet temperature, thermal power, and net electrical power is illustrated in Fig. 11. This simulation is also conducted at an EVA emissivity of 0.9, which is cost-effective. The heat loss from the glass layer increases with the increase of the glass surface emissivity and hence decreases the average cell temperature, maximum cell temperature, and water outlet temperature, as shown in Fig. 11a, b and d, respectively. However, the top glass layer temperature increases with the increase of heat loss from the surface that increases with emissivity as shown in Fig. 11c. Fig. 11e presents the variation of thermal power and electrical net power with emissivity. The thermal power decreases with the increase of emissivity as the water out temperature decreases. The net electrical power increases with the increase of emissivity. Therefore, it can be concluded that using an Le coated glass with cost-effective EVA emissivity results in higher thermal performance of the VPV/T system.

4.3.3. Effect of vacuum pressure. 
Heat transfer through the cavity vacuum layer is transferred by radiation and conduction. Fig. 12 shows the effect of vacuum pressure on the water outlet, average solar cell temperature, and thermal and electrical net power. The PV temperature decreases with the increase of the cavity vacuum pressure because of the increase of the cavity thermal conductivity of the vacuum layer. Additionally, increasing the vacuum pressure increases the heat loss. Hence, the water outlet temperature and the PV temperature decrease with a small value until the vacuum pressure reaches 10 Pa and then sharply decrease with an increase of vacuum pressure. It is worth mentioning that a stable performance of the new proposed VPV/T system is attained even with vacuum pressure degradation up to 10 Pa.

The variation of the local top glass layer temperature with vacuum pressure is presented in Fig. 13. Increasing the vacuum pressure leads to an increase in the local temperature and hence increases the heat loss from the glass layer. In addition, the thermal bridge impact through the pillars and sealing can be highly detected at higher cavity vacuum pressure.

4.4. Transient analysis of PV/T and VPV/T collectors
This section gives a comparison between the real instantaneous thermal performance of the conventional PV/T collector system and new proposed VPV/T collector system under the meteorological conditions of Cairo (30.0444° N, 31.2357° E), Egypt. The transient simulation is conducted on a typical day for this city on the 10th of July 2019. Fig. 14 shows hourly variation of weather conditions for that day. These data are imported using the transient profile option. This profile is used to estimate updated boundary conditions in the transient simulation every hour. The current transient simulation is conducted at Re of 50 where a comparable solar cell temperature for both designs exists with higher thermal energy for the VPV/T collector system.

Fig. 15 provides a transient comparison between the new VPV/T system and conventional PV/T system for average solar cell temperature, maximum solar cell temperature, top glass surface temperature, water outlet temperature, and gained thermal power at a vacuum pressure of 0.01 Pa, Vwind of 2 m s−1 and Re of 50. Average PV temperature increases with time due to the increase of solar irradiance, and it reaches its maximum and then decreases again with time as shown in Fig. 15a. The new VPV/T system shows relative similar values to the PV/T systems during the first three hours of the simulation, and then the difference increases with time until it reaches its maximum and decreases again with time. The same behaviour is noticed for maximum solar cell temperature and water outlet temperature, as shown in Fig. 15b and d. Top glass surface temperature is lower in the case of VPV/T system compared to the PV/T system as shown in Fig. 15c. The gained thermal power is higher in the VPV/T systems with nearly similar gained electrical power as illustrated by Fig. 15e and f.

4.5. Exergy assessment

Fig. 16a shows the variation in the electrical, thermal, and total exergy (Ex) of the VPV/T system with Re. As Re increases, both thermal and electrical exergies improve the total exergy consequently, and both reach the peak at Re = 50. At high Re values, the thermal exergy is decreased. The considerable reduction is dominant, considered to be a consequence of Tm reduction. A decrease of Tm at high Re occurs because of the smaller temperature difference between the inlet and outlet. Hence, the low-temperature difference produced shallow exergy content. Furthermore, the improved electrical exergy led to low-grade heat energy. The maximum total exergy of the VPV/T system is about 78 W which is achieved at Re = 50, while with increasing Re, the amount of heat transfer to the coolant increases. This trend is shown by the conventional PV/T, as shown in Fig. 16b. When the VPV/T design is compared to the conventional PV/T design, it is evident that a 33.6% improvement in the total exergy content can be accomplished by using the VPV/T at the lowest Re = 10. Besides, the total exergy content is improved by approximately 5.8% at the highest Re value of 150. Furthermore, the electrical, thermal, and total exergy efficiencies for both designs are shown in Fig. 16c and d, respectively. It is evident that the maximum overall exergy efficiency is obtained at Re of 50 and 150 for VPV/T and PV/T, respectively. The maximum total exergy efficiency values are predicted to be 39.63% and 35.91% for VPV/T and PV/T collector system designs, respectively. Other exergy results at different wind speeds are displayed in the ESI.†

5. Conclusions
In the present study, a new composited edge sealed vacuum glazed photovoltaic thermal (VPV/T) solar collector system is proposed. This design is compared with the conventional PV/T module. Using a 3D validated thermal model. Major conclusions are summarised into the following points.
(1) The VPV/T module achieved higher outlet water temperature and consequently, higher thermal energy gain compared to the conventional PV/T system over the investigated Re numbers.
(2) At Re greater than 60 and solar radiation of 1000W m−2, the gained electrical and thermal power from the VPV/T design is higher than that of the conventional VPV/T system under the same conditions.
(3) The VPV/T gained thermal energy is much higher than that of the conventional PV/T system even at higher wind speed. For instance, at a wind speed of 5 m s−1 and Re of 10, the gained thermal energy for the PV/T and the new VPV/T system is 22 W and 53 W, respectively. Around 140% enhancement in the thermal energy gain was accomplished while the electrical power was slightly changed from 33.7 W to 29.3 W for the PV/T and the VPV/T designs, respectively.
(4) Stable thermal performance of the VPV/T module is accomplished at a wide range of vacuum pressures up to 1 Pa.
(5) Based on the exergy analysis, the new VPV/T achieved higher total exergy efficiency up to 39.63% at Re of 50, while it is around 35.91% for the conventional PV/T system at Re of 150.
A serpentine flow field heat sink is used in this study. This design was selected based on recent studies that used sheet and tube serpentine thermal absorbers. However, the contact between the tube surface and the sheets causes a big problem in the heat transfer and CFD meshing of this thermal absorber. Therefore, a wide channel with the serpentine flow field is used. However, the temperature difference across the silicon wafer is still high especially at lower Re. Therefore, it is recommended, in future investigations, to use different designs of thermal absorbers with a shorter flow path to accomplish better silicon wafer temperature uniformity. In addition, the performance of both conventional PV/T and VPV/T systems should also be discovered at various ambient temperatures, solar radiation levels and various heat sink designs in future studies.
