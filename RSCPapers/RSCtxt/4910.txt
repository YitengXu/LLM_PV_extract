    , Accepted 12th July 2021First published on 13th July 2021AbstractIn the realm of perovskite-based solar cells, the quest for lead-free absorber materials is the epicenter of research. The search has led to the development of various lead-free compounds that have the potential to deliver efficient, air-stable, low-cost, and environment-friendly perovskite solar cells. Inorganic lead-free halide double-perovskites (IHDPs) like Cs2M+M3+X6 (M+ = metal, M3+ = pnictogen, X = halide) are consistently being reported to demonstrate long carrier diffusion lengths, large free-charge mobilities, and longer thermal stability. They are easy to synthesize and are compositionally tuneable for desired structural and electronic band structure. The experimental power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of solar cells based on these inorganic materials have not yet exceeded 3%, thus keeping up hopes of research on double-perovskite-based photovoltaics. A detailed track record against a set of qualities for developing efficient Cs2M+M3+X6 type materials or in general inorganic hybrid double perovskites (IHDPs) will help us look ahead in the right direction. This minireview discusses the theoretical assessment of the electronic band structures of IHDPs, stability with respect to their phonon dispersion relations and thermodynamics, and strategies employed for tunability of their optical band gaps and for enhancement of carrier lifetimes and mobility, followed by listing figures of merit for using them in solar cells. Finally, current challenges and perspectives for use of these materials for the said application are presented.Altaf PashaAltaf Pasha received his Masters in Physics from National College, where he conducted research on non-linear optical activity in rare-earth doped glasses.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) top the chart of efficiencies in the class of standalone emerging photovoltaics.1 The low-cost of materials, easy fabrication processes, and ever-increasing efficiencies place them well above their commercially available contending technologies such as silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and cadmium telluride (CdTe).2–8 In a typical PSC, the light absorber is a perovskite material with a general ABX3 structure, where A and B are metal cations and X is the anion.9 Recently, Al-Ashouri et al. (2020) demonstrated a triple-cation Cs0.05(FA0.77MA0.23)0.95Pb(I0.77Br0.23)3 inorganic–organic perovskite top cell combined with a silicon bottom cell that yields a PCE of 29.1% which is the highest among all the literature reports.10 Despite these attractive figures, two major environmental concerns that deter the commercialization of Pb(lead)-based perovskites are the fear of leaching of lead (Pb2+) due to the long-term instability of photovoltaic devices and hazards of toxic solvents that arise during large scale manufacturing.11–18 Of the two, lead leakage from the modules was tackled by improved encapsulation using self-healing materials of high mechanical strength.19 Alternatively, Pb ions could be replaced with suitable nontoxic elements in the perovskite material while keeping its properties unaffected. This will completely avoid human exposure to lead and contribute hugely to the public health missions of many countries in reducing the pollution level due to lead exposure.11,15,20–27 The focus to replace the Pb2+ ion in the perovskite material structure has paved the way for extensive iterative screening of the periodic table using arrays of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to hunt the elements of ideal electronic properties for stable PSCs. As a result of this high throughput screening, the first option is a homovalent replacement of Pb2+ with Sn2+(stannous), a group IV metal. The compound becomes unstable due to rapid oxidation of the Sn2+ to Sn4+ (stannic) state,28,29 and leads to vacancy ordered A2M4+□X6 (□ = vacancy) type compounds where A = Rb, Cs; M = Sn, Pd, Pt; and X = Cl, Br, I.30,31 They contain isolated octahedral units with rock salt ordering of MX6 and □X6 octahedra and, the absence of polyhedral connectivity bestows the vacancy ordered double perovskites with additional degrees of dynamic freedom that results in anharmonic movement away from equilibrium geometry and this can alter the electronic energy band gap and phonon induced loss of coherence, slowing down the non-radiative recombinations.32,33 This family of perovskites has gained the spotlight after a recent DFT study illustrated that interactions across vacancies generate disperse conduction bands and indicated that Rb2PdBr6 (1.31 eV) and Cs2PtI6 (1.22 eV) possess optimum bandgaps for photovoltaic applications.34 Currently, these materials stand at the nuances of functional similarities with Cs2M+M3+X6 type perovskites.35 Another family of perovskites for photovoltaics are A3M2X9 type compounds where A = K, Rb, Cs, Methylammonium (MA); M = Sb, Bi; and X = I.36–39 Despite their attractive optoelectronic properties, very few compounds like Rb3Sb2Br9−xIx have shown PCE >1%.40 Dimensionality of 2D Rb3Sb2I9 tends to have more preferred electronic transport symmetry compared to its 0D or 3D cationic analogues.41 The direct bandgap and lower exciton binding energy of this material are promising features for photovoltaics. Currently, their progress is hindered with a need to optimize device fabrication techniques. A recent approach for Pb2+ ion replacement is a split cation technique achieved by heterovalent substitution of two Pb2+ ions with a pair of monovalent and trivalent cations, to preserve the average oxidation state on the B site. This leads to compounds called elpasolites or double perovskites with the 3D structure A2M+M3+X6, where M+ and M3+ are monovalent and trivalent cations respectively. Although there are many possible metal element candidates chosen for M+ and M3+ cations, the theoretical first principles calculations suggest that only a handful of compounds with a suitable decomposition enthalpy (ΔH), bandgap, carrier effective masses, and exciton binding energy could be suitable for the design of solar cells.42–44 In this regard, numerous theoretical and experimental results have nominated Sb3+, In3+, and Bi3+ for the M3+ site, and metals such as Cu+, Ag+, and Tl+ for the M+ site to form double perovskite materials.42,44–50 Furthermore, the chemical trends of these materials give clear insights for the tunability of their properties according to the requirements. For instance, the stability of these double perovskite materials is determined by the choice of A and X elements while the band gaps are determined predominantly by X, M+, and M3+ elements.51 The material becomes stable as X becomes lighter (from I to Cl) and A becomes heavier (from Li to Cs). Also, the bandgap decreases monotonically as X becomes heavier and changes non-monotonically as M+ and M3+ are varied. Even with a plethora of knowledge, PSCs based on double perovskites are yet to achieve satisfying results which leaves a huge room for improvement at the material, cell, and module levels. Important developments that have come about in the field of Pb2+ free perovskite photovoltaics and the scope of such material systems need elaborate assessment. The review articles published so far present diverse perspectives.52–74 Many of them focus on material synthesis and their properties with regard to various double halide perovskites.55–62,71,73,74 Very few of them discuss their utilization in solar cells and in that, just a handful of them have dedicated only a small portion of their review on Cs2M+M3+X6 type perovskites and their use in solar cells.56,57,61,67,71,72,74 They reported the cell performances reached without much discussion (i) on the other cell parameters achieved, (ii) their low performances and (iii) the structure–property optimizations devised for better cell performance, because of which the present review stands relevant. We discuss the specific intrinsic properties of only Cs2M+M3+X6 perovskite materials in terms of figures of merit required to be qualified as a good solar cell absorber, with a more in-depth picture of its influence on device performance, to arrive at conclusions on the reliability of these materials for solar cells.
Optoelectronic properties
1. Electronic band structures
Of all the desirable properties a good photovoltaic absorber material possesses, the flexibility to tune its bandgap to an optimal absorption range (between 1.1 and 1.7 eV) is pivotal. Metal-halide perovskites are known for the easy tunability of band structures75 to either obtain a bandgap close to the optimal for a single-junction solar cell or to obtain a bandgap for optimal performance in tandem or multi-junction solar cells. Fig. 1 illustrates a comparison of the bandgaps of all Cs2M+M3+X6-type absorber materials that are claimed to be potential candidates for PSCs. The relatively large spread of the reported bandgap energy values most likely originates from different synthesis conditions and measurement methods used in the different studies.76 Of all the materials mentioned in the graph, AgBi based double perovskites, owing to other important optoelectronic attributes stands most explored with reports ranging from 1.83 eV to 2.19 eV.28,45 Both halide variants, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are reported to show indirect bandgaps, with electronic properties that resemble the well-known CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) and CZTS (copper zinc tin sulfide) in terms of high absorption coefficients and tunable band gaps.77,78 The results based on rigorous DFT calculations reveal that the band structure of Cs2AgBiX6 has a fundamental mismatch of Ag-d and Bi-s orbitals at the band edges, pushing the VBM (valence band maxima) to the X point which leads to an inherently indirect bandgap.44,45,79 Although DFT often severely underestimates the band gaps of semiconductors,80 the theoretically assessed band gaps for these materials have matched well with experimentally measured values. It is well established for Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) compounds that the VBM is derived from the antibonding states of X-4p and Ag-4d. Transitioning from Cl to Br will cause the valence band to narrow and upshift in energy, while the conduction band expands and downshifts, resulting in bandgap narrowing.47,50,79Fig. 2A shows a comparison of bandgaps between the two halide variants of AgBi materials, however direct and much smaller bandgaps are desired for efficient visible light absorption. Replacing Bi-s states from the VBM with In-s states will lead to a direct but large bandgap (>3 eV) Cs2AgInCl6 material.48 Bifold substitutional doping with isoelectronic K or Rb at the Cs site and non-isoelectronic Sn, Cu, and Ga co-doping at Ag and In sites could be employed. This may lead to compounds with a range of indirect and reduced bandgaps up to 0.65 eV. For example, in Cu and Ga co-doping, the valence band maximum is mainly composed of the Cu-d state with small contribution from In-s/p states. However in the conduction band, the In-s state shifts towards the Fermi level significantly reducing the band gap.81 However no experimental work has been reported so far. This leaves with Cs2AgBiBr6 as a potential material, to begin with.

Efforts to reduce the band gap and restore its direct nature can be realized by introducing ns2 ions such as of Tl, that will make s–s nearest neighbour cation interactions possible.79Fig. 2B shows the effect on the band structure of Cs2AgBiCl6 when Tl+ and Tl3+ are individually substituted for Ag+ and Bi3+ respectively. The schematic is evidence that the Ag+Tl3+ combination yields reduced direct band gaps because the CBM (conduction band minima) is dominated by overlapping Tl-s and Ag-s orbitals and at Γ.82 The Tl+Bi3+ combination enables further narrowing of the band gap since s contribution from Tl matches the Bi s contribution.79 Despite the success of this scheme for photovoltaic application, it remains unsuccessful since Tl is also toxic.83 This leads to further exploration of nontoxic substitutions for Ag+ that can mimic the band characteristics offered by Tl+. Shi et al. (2020)84 reported the band structures and projected density of states (DOS) [Fig. 3A] for a series of monovalent cations (Cu, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) substituted at the Ag+ site in the Cs2AgBiCl6 compound. In the case of Cs2CuBiCl6 the indirect bandgap obtained is very small 0.68 eV, whereas the same cubic phase of Cs2NaBiCl6 shows a very large indirect bandgap of 2.98 eV. In Na substituted compounds the d-orbitals of the Na atom are absent, unlike in Ag or Cu substituted, where strong orbital hybridizations occur between Ag-5s, Ag-4d or Cu-4s, Cu-3d and Bi-6p, Cl-3p orbitals. This results in reduced frontier s-d orbital interactions leading to minimized Na-contribution to the CBM. Similarly, orbital interactions between Bi/Cl ions and other alkali metal ions like K, Rb and Cs are minimal, resulting in compounds of a very large indirect bandgaps of 3.02 eV, 3.03 eV, and 3.06 eV, respectively.84 This limits the range of options available for M+ site substitution. M3+ substitution could also be realized by complex dual-metal like the one reported by Du et al. (2017).85 In this scheme, Sb3+ and In3+ ions are simultaneously substituted at the Bi3+ site of Cs2AgBiBr6 crystals (with right composition stoichiometry) and a bandgap reduction is achieved. Thin films of this composition Cs2AgSbxBi1−xBr6 too showed proportional bandgap reduction with an increased substitution of Sb,86 but they are still far from the desired range for photovoltaics. Further for the same material, Lindquist et al. (2019)87 formulated simultaneous substitution of Sn2+ at the Ag+ site and Sn4+ at the Bi3+ site, collectively generating anionic Ag+ vacancies as the dominant charge-compensating defect. This revealed the introduction of new bands with Sn4+ 5s0 impurity characteristics, below the CBM of the host lattice which reduces the bandgap to 1.58 eV (from 2 eV). However, the strong tendency of Sn4+ to convert its oxidation state is a big disadvantage. A high-pressure treatment can also narrow the bandgap of bulk Cs2AgBiBr6, as demonstrated by Li et al. (2017)88 and recently by Yang et al. (2020).89Fig. 3B illustrates the changes in band structures of bulk Cs2AgBiBr6 upon pressure treatment. With a compression of 15 GPa, a 22.3% bandgap reduction that leads to 1.7 eV (comparable to that of MAPbI3) was achieved.88 With increasing pressure it is evident that the valence band widens, while the conduction band narrows and is accompanied with a significant overlap. The bandgaps presented in the graphs are 1.69, 1.55, 1.41, 1.29, 1.17, 1.06, 0.95, 0.84, 0.74, 0.65 in eV for corresponding values of pressure in GPa. Also, compressing the lattices of Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2SbAgCl6 by nearly 11% has reduced the bandgaps from 2.3 eV to approximately 1.55 eV.89 Although this technique works on the bulk of the material, it would be interesting to see if the corresponding thin-films could undergo high-pressure treatment and be usable for devising a solar cell. Also, synthesis of low bandgap materials like Cs2CuSbCl6 nanocrystals (with bandgap of ∼1.66 eV)90 and theoretical studies91,92 on Cs2LiGaBr6, Cs2NaGaBr6, and Cs2InGaBr6 (with band gap values 0.731 eV, 0.45 eV, and 1.01 eV respectively) have further widened the selection range of absorber material candidates. Successful fabrication of PSCs based on these materials is yet to be achieved.

2 Optical properties
Study on the optical absorption edges of perovskite materials allows one to gather information about the states near the VB and CB, as well as their corresponding energy separation (or forbidden energy bandgap Eg). Both these parameters essentially decide the capabilities as absorbers for solar cells. Collectively, the extent of optical absorption, the nature of the bandgap, and the overall theoretical efficiency of absorber materials can be tied by a metric called spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) proposed by Yu and Zunger (2012).93Fig. 4 shows the effect of change in band characteristics on SLME for selected Cs2M+M3+X6 type perovskite materials. Evidently, the materials with higher SLME are toxic Pb and Tl based. It is evident from the figure that lowering bandgaps of materials that are thermally stable (materials having high decomposition energies, discussed in the later section) will lead to efficient absorbers.79 A halide variation scheme for AgBi materials can be exercised to tune the optical absorption in a desired range. Computed optical absorption spectra of such a scheme are shown in Fig. 5A.94 The absorption curves for all compounds with varying Br and Cl concentrations show a similar shape and sharp inflection point owing to their indirect bandgap. It can be observed that the absorption curve of Cs2AgBiBr6−xClx will blue-shift with the increasing Cl− content and the bandgap increases from 2.1 to 2.7 eV with a slope of 0.1 eV per Cl− being incorporated. Along with optical and electronic properties, the structure also changes with increasing x values as shown in Fig. 5B using various DFT calculation models. In the graph, it is also interesting to note that the band gap of the one with higher structural symmetry is always slightly smaller, and all these are indirect band gap materials with the HSE (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof) calculated band gap in the range of 2.1–2.7 eV. In support of the halide mixing scheme, even in double perovskites it is reported that any ratios of Cl− and Br− mixing will lead to phase pure compounds on photoirradiation. However, I− inclusion in Cs2AgBiBr6/Cs2AgBiCl6 is restricted to very low concentrations (<3 mol%) since any higher I− doping will lead to silver-rich and bismuth-rich non-perovskite phases.95 The next scheme for tuning optical properties, thereby bandgap narrowing, is a partial/complete interchanging of Bi3+ with Sb3+ and In3+. Fig. 6A(a) illustrates an interplay of optical absorption and bandgap transitions with changing concentrations of In and Sb. Tauc plots suggest that Cs2AgSbCl6 has an indirect bandgap and an absorption edge value 2.54 eV very similar to its Bi counterpart, Cs2AgBiCl6. However, indirect to direct bandgap transition happens when more than 40% of Sb3+ is incorporated in Cs2AgSbxIn1−xCl6 and such a crossover is shown in the phase diagram Fig. 6A(b).96 In and Sb substitution in Cs2AgBiBr6 is reported to weaken the PL intensity, which reflects deeper defect states and symmetry-forbidden transitions from the VB to CB.85 Similarly, Li et al. (2020)97 reported the synthesis and accurate bandgap evaluation of pure phase Cs2Ag(SbxBi1−x)Br6 films with x varying over a range of compositions. As shown in the graphs in Fig. 6B, the bandgap energies of Cs2Ag(SbxBi1−x)Br6 films reveal that 50–90% of Sb demonstrate smaller bandgaps than pure Sb-based and Bi-based films. Such a mechanism of bandgap reduction can be understood through photoemission spectroscopy results, as an interplay occurs between increasing electron affinity and decreasing ionization potential with changing Sb and Bi compositions in Cs2Ag(SbxBi1−x)Br6 films. Although the band gap narrowed up to 170 meV, it is still far from the desired range. As predicted theoretically in the previous section, the experimental results for various M-site doping or halide replacement schemes for Cs2AgBiBr6 do not effectively yield optical absorption in the visible range.

Recently, compound Cs2NaFeCl6 has gained attention with new possibilities of bandgap narrowing by introducing Ag+ in place of Na+. The parent Cs2NaFeCl6 compound has an optimum direct bandgap of ∼2 eV but suffers from poor charge carrier mobilities restricting its use in optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Xian et al. (2020)98 evaluated the favourable impacts of partial/complete Na+ replacement in single crystal Cs2NaFeCl6 with Ag+ towards bandgap narrowing (from 2.1 eV down to 1.5 eV) and improving electron mobility (from 1.06 up to 15.3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Upon increasing Ag+ in Cs2AgxNa1−xFeCl6, a red shift of the absorption edge (from 600 nm to 800 nm), increase of the decomposition temperature (up to 536 °C), and the charge carrier diffusion length (from 3.7 to 311 nm) and constriction of the perovskite lattice are observed. The computed DOS of Cs2AgxNa1−xFeCl6 (for x = 0, 0.5 and 1) is presented in Fig. 7 to rationalize such improvements. For, Cs2NaFeCl6 despite the VBM and CBM (dominated by Fe-3d and Cl-3p orbitals) overlapping with Na-3s states, the conductivity originated from Cl–Fe–Cl interactions. However, when Na+ ions are completely replaced by Ag+ ions, conductivity improves in spite of the small contribution of Ag states to the VBM and CBM. It is interesting to note that such behaviour occurs with no interaction of Ag-d states with Cs-3d, Fe-2p, and Cl-2p orbitals. Such a behaviour is evidence for stable inner orbital environments. Although this compound has set a new direction towards Pb-free double perovskites for photovoltaics, studies on their thin-film counterparts are yet to be realized. In a comparison of the optical properties of single crystals, powder, thin-films, and nanocrystal solution (NCs), a significant difference can be expected. For instance, Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs show a weak and blue-shifted PL from that of bulk Cs2AgBiBr6, possibly due to the quantum confinement effect.99,100 PL emission of such NCs is broad and weak, and could be attributed to phonon-assisted recombination of self-trapped excitons such as in Bi vacancies and Ag-Bi antisites.100 In the case of films, a strong exciton absorption peak and a blue-shifted highly intense PL peak is observed for Cs2AgBiBr6 films as compared to its powder form. This is because the films are subjected to thermal annealing which significantly reduces the defect trap density. Enhancement of optical absorption in these perovskite films is also possible by additional heating steps during film coating. For instance, when the Cs2AgBiBr6 solution and the substrate are heated to 75 °C before spin-coating, a steep onset at about 550 nm (corresponding to a direct bandgap of 2.21 eV) is observed in the absorbance spectra, which is otherwise absent for thin-films coated at room temperature.101 This enhancement is due to an improvement in surface coverage and quality of films. Increase in the optical absorption due to an increased surface coverage on the substrate comes from the larger amount of deposited perovskite, caused by the faster solvent evaporation at elevated temperatures. Such improvements in synthesis protocols along with doping strategies could be crucial in device fabrication. Employing doping strategies to tune the optoelectronic properties is promising for single crystals or NCs, but becomes limited because fabricating thin-films of uniform composition is extremely challenging. Following the materials and techniques discussed so far, it is clear that carefully alloying pure compounds of AgBi, AgSb, CuSb, and NaFe combinations will lead to desired Cs2M+M3+X6 type absorbers for solar cells. However, to substantiate this and utilize their enhanced properties in solar devices, many more pieces have to be put together, which are discussed in the following sections.

Charge carrier dynamics
1. Carrier lifetime (τ)
Conversion of absorbed light into electricity by these perovskite materials comprises several elementary processes, notably the generation of excitons, their dissociation into interfacial charge-transfer states, the split-up of these interfacial excitations into pairs of free electrons and holes, and finally free charge extraction in competition to non-geminate recombination. This makes the task of curtailing charge carrier recombination in all stages of solar cell fabrication fundamentally important. Firstly, in the absorber material, recombination issues can be dealt with by understanding the charge carrier kinetics in terms of their lifetimes, diffusion lengths, and the associated recombination pathways. An extensive report on charge carrier kinetics of Cs2M+M3+X6 type perovskites by Bartesaghi et al. (2019)102 utilizes time-resolved microwave conductance (TRMC) to probe the generation of mobile charges upon pulsed irradiation followed by subsequent decay. The results led to a comprehensive kinetic model to track the generation, trapping, and recombination of charges in Cs2AgBiBr6 films, both close to the surface and in the bulk of the material. The schematics of the proposed model are shown in Fig. 8A(a). The excitons are expected to recombine quickly due to a large number of electron and hole trap states present in the bandgap. However, observation of mobile charges several microseconds after the excitation in the bulk of the material (as shown in Fig. 8A(b)) evidences that the recombination happens slowly because the trap states in this material are energetically low.102 This is a good sign for an absorber material since such mobile charges could be extracted by carefully tuning the thin-film thickness and morphology. Besides the trap states, the relaxation can also happen via band-to-band, auger, and surface recombination pathways that could further be separated as radiative and non-radiative. The study also showed that the recombination of charges at surface states is fast and the dominant recombination pathway in these materials. A scheme of the interplay between different charge carrier relaxations and luminescence recombination was discussed in depth recently by Schmitz et al. (2020).103 A fine structure revelation of the prominent 2.83 eV absorption peak in Cs2AgBiBr6 shows a distinct energetic substructure ranging over 100 meV, consisting of at least three individual transitions. Among them, one of the transitions was reported to be luminescent with a short effective lifetime, while the other transitions are shown to suffer from fast relaxation into long-lived luminescent states around the indirect band edge energy of approximately 1.8–2.0 eV. The results are schematically illustrated in Fig. 8B.

Charge carrier transport is temperature dependant and most of the charge carriers decay through a fast trapping process at room temperature.102–104Fig. 9A shows two sets of PL intensity images of the Cs2AgBiBr6 single crystal at various delay times obtained at 298 K and 123 K. At 0 ns, the PL spot shows an initial carrier distribution produced by laser beam excitation. As time evolves, the diameter of the spot becomes larger, with carriers diffusing away. The time evolution of the PL image and distribution profile [Fig. 9B(a and b)] at 298 K and 123 K indicates an accelerated carrier transport at a lower temperature. It is evident that, at room temperature, the portion of carriers that can perform a long-distance transport is significantly limited by the presence of a defect. These defects are deactivated at low temperatures because of which diffusion lengths reach up to 2.4 μm at 123 K from 0.7 μm at room temperature.104 This means that Cs2AgBiBr6 based PSCs will be poor performers even indoors where typical Pb-based PSCs are now beginning to venture. Although recent reports show 1 μm diffusion length and 1 μs career lifetime for Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgTlBr6 single crystals, despite the large trap densities of 1017 cm−3 particularly near the surfaces, these values are well behind the centimetre and millisecond regimes demonstrated by their lead-based analogues.105,106 Greul et al. (2017)101 with demonstrating a 2.5% efficient solar cell based on Cs2AgBiBr6 as the absorber, reported PL decay times in the range of hundreds of nanoseconds claiming high defect tolerance of this material. Clearly, low device efficiency is due to fast and dominant carrier recombination at the film surface. The study on the influence of the annealing temperature reveals that longer carrier lifetimes can be expected for the films that were annealed at 250 °C compared to unannealed films. This is most likely because of a reduction in undesired side phases that will form when the films are not annealed.101 A comparative study of carrier mobility of solution-processed and vacuum processed films of Cs2AgBiBr6 reveals similar lifetimes of rapid and intermediate PL decay components. Accompanied by this, a prolonged PL decay component for solution-processed films was observed. This is due to a well-established fact that the intrinsic charge carrier recombination holds a monotonic relation with the degree of crystallinity of films. Since the degree of crystallinity is better in the solution-processed films, they exhibit longer recombination lifetimes.107 Enhancement of charge career mobility is also observed by avoiding the formation of Ag vacancies and formation of side phase Cs3Bi2Br9via crystal synthesis in a Ag rich environment.108 Furthermore, low effective masses that are required for longer mobilities are reported to be achievable through substitution of monovalent Ag, Cu, and Na cations at the M+ site in the Cs2M+M3+Cl6 crystal.84,98Table 1 depicts the reported values of the average carrier lifetime (τ) and mobility (μ) for various Cs2M+M3+X6 type materials for solar cells. Although the average carrier lifetime in single-crystal materials is appreciable, their thin-film derivatives show poorer lifetimes. In thin film solar cell, it means that there is an inflated loss of carriers through non-radiative recombination, consequently reducing both the carrier injection and transport efficiencies and leading to an inefficient charge extraction from the absorber. So far, none of the Cs2M+M3+X6 based thin-films have shown remarkable carrier lifetime and mobility values that could have made these materials on par with conventional Pb-based halide thin films. Films of Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reveal very short electron diffusion lengths (70–200 nm), attributed to the presence of energetic disorder at the interface and high density of electron traps leading to low Jsc values in these solar cells. This is well substantiated by Longo et al., who demonstrate the presence of high density of electron traps using photothermal deflection optical absorption spectroscopy and external radiative efficiency calculations.109 In thin film solar cells, this means that there is an inflated loss of carriers through non-radiative recombination across these traps, consequently reducing both the carrier injection and transport efficiencies, resulting in an inefficient charge extraction from the absorber and low photocurrent density.

2. Mobility (μ) and phonon scattering
For double perovskite structures, compared to their single perovskite counterparts, the lattice dynamics will be inherently more complicated due to the addition of a second vibrating B-type metal-halide sublattice, leading to a complex environment where the interaction between charge carriers and the Coulomb potential induced by the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonons can exist. This interaction is referred to as the Fröhlich interaction, and in the case of Cs2AgBiBr6, it arises via a highly harmonic and vibrationally dominant (AgBr6)5− sublattice, as well as from a collection of strongly resonant electronic states distributed above the CBM. Three important parameters can quantify Fröhlich interactions, namely the LO phonon energy ħωLO, the electron-phonon coupling constant ϒLO, and the Huang–Rhys factor S, which characterizes interactions between optical centers and LO modes. The Huang–Rhys factor represents (i) the average number of vibrations emitted after an optical transition between excited and ground states, and (ii) the coupling strength. It is related to the Stokes shift energy via ΔEStokes = 2S ħωLO where ΔEStokes is the energy shift seen between the emission and excitation bands in the Raman spectra. With an accurate assessment of these three parameters, one can comment on the suitability of Cs2AgBiBr6 for solar cells since the strong electron-phonon coupling is detrimental and typically leads to increased carrier scattering during transport.
Steele et al. (2018)110 for Cs2AgBiBr6 reported LO phonons to have A1g symmetry and energy of ħωLO = 175 cm−1 (∼22 meV) with a Huang–Rhys factor S = 15.4, confirming the presence of strong Fröhlich interactions. Zelewski et al. (2019),111 further supported the fact that carrier scattering is dominated by LO phonons corresponding to an energy of 22.4 meV (180 cm−1) with S = 11.7. The PL emission in Cs2AgBiBr6 was reported to originate from colour-centers (or F-centres) rather than band-to-band recombination. An electron coupling constant ϒLO = 226 meV was observed, which is several times larger than that reported for popular organic lead halide perovskites, namely, the four variants of (FA, MA)Pb(I, Br)3, having ϒLO values in the order of 40 meV to 60 meV.112 To assess the temperature dependence of phonon scattering, Fig. 10A depicts the temperature-dependent linewidth analysis of PL experiments. The red line referring to PL linewidth broadening measured at 160 K is induced by acoustic and LO phonon couplings, which are otherwise parsed in blue and green for lower temperatures, respectively. This indicates that the magnitude of ϒLO is indeed sensitive to a thermal treatment, reducing from 226 meV to 201 meV on annealing. A 10% drop in the measured coupling strength strongly supports the notion that lattice disorder influences Fröhlich interactions within Cs2AgBiBr6 which is also dominant at room temperatures. In a satisfactory agreement, Fig. 10B illustrates a full assessment of the non-resonant Raman spectrum with a dominant peak for the longitudinal optical A1g phonon mode (177 cm−1) that mainly involves concerted motion of the Br atoms (symmetric stretching of the Bi–Br and Ag–Br bonds of the octahedral cages). It is observed that the A1g peak becomes intense when excited near the absorption edge (437 nm) of this material. This resonance of incident and scattered photons evidences the presence of excitonic contributions near the absorption edge (437 nm) of Cs2AgiBr6, which is also detrimental for a good absorber. With the temperature dependence of carrier phonon interactions, it is reasonable to expect doping to significantly influence the carrier mobility too.113 Hutter et al. (2018)114 studied the influence of both the increase in temperature and Sb content on transport properties of Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6 using the pulse radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (PR-TRMC) technique. On partially replacing the Bi3+ with Sb3+, slightly reduced mobilities are observed, although at each temperature, the absolute values stay within the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, independent of x, the mobility decreases with increasing temperatures in between 140 and 420 K as shown in Fig. 9B(c). Further analysis reveals that ∑μ scales with T−1.15 for x = 0, T−1.62 (x = 0.05), T−1.19 (x = 0.1), and T−1.34 (x = 0.4), with negative powers, indicating that phonon scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism influencing the charge-carrier mobility.

Overall, the charge mobility of the Cs2AgBiX6 compound is more than 1 order of magnitude lower than that of lead halide perovskites, which is likely due to strong phonon scattering.111,115 Intuitively, the large Fröhlich interaction can be ascribed to the difference in the electronegativity of the Ag–Br or Bi–Br bonds, which is absent in the case of Pb–I perovskites.110,113 However, there is evidence of a strong electron-phonon coupling in the Ag-free system Cs3Bi2Br9, which consists of just the corner-sharing BiBr6 octahedra, yet forming corrugated layers similar to Cs2AgBiBr6.113 Collectively, it is reasonable to say that Bi-based110 and Sb-based116 compounds come with strong electron-phonon coupling via Fröhlich interactions which is undesirable for a good solar cell absorber.
Stability & performance
Stability is the first complex challenge in the domain of PSCs which can revolutionize photovoltaics. As a reference point for practical definition and best suited for the current stage of PSC development (with respect to a solar cell module), stability can be defined as the ability of a cell module to retain its initial efficiency under continuous operational conditions. Their instability can arise from a hierarchy of three major sources: (i) material: component materials and interfaces (perovskite absorbers, charge selective contacts, and electrodes), (ii) cell: operating conditions and stresses in devices (working PV cells under the stress of external factors), (iii) module: module and packaging (including encapsulation, interconnects, etc.). In this section the first two are discussed, since the Pb-free compounds are still in the cell development stage of their evolution.
1. Material
Perovskites are basically salts and can take on water effortlessly if they are not packaged well. However many researchers have verified the excellent stability of Cs2M+M3+Br6 in the ambient environment.46,50 Its optoelectrical properties show no evident degradation up to 6 months storage in the ambient environment.117 Very similar to Pb perovskites, light exposure can break relatively weak bonds in these perovskites, and create halogen vacancy-halogen interstitial pairs that facilitate halogens to migrate.118,119 Thus various important components that can be from the internal dynamics, like the intrinsic stability of perovskite material itself, play an important role in sustaining the initial performance of cells. Isolating the effect of each important parameter on each device component is a challenging task. However, decluttering this complex puzzle will lead to an understanding of the stability of PSCs to some extent. A preliminary assessment of the material stability is measured using Goldschmidt's tolerance factor, an empirical criterion, which is straight but an insufficient method. A detailed study of the stability of a perovskite material would require the calculation of the phonon dispersion relations (dynamic stability) and the quaternary convex hulls (thermodynamic stability).120 Xiao et al. (2016)50 reported the thermodynamic stability and defect properties of Cs2AgBiBr6, using DFT. It was shown that the stable chemical potential region of pure Cs2AgBiBr6 is narrow, which means the stoichiometry and chemical conditions must be carefully controlled to avoid unwanted phases. To qualify as a stable candidate for solar cells, the double-perovskite films should retain their structure and optical response in experimental testing methods which involve long exposure to both the ambient atmosphere and visible light. McClure et al. (2016)47 reported the darkening of the exposed surface of the Cs2AgBiBr6 compound in response to one month of exposure, wherein the samples received only about six hours of direct exposure each day. XRD and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy after two and four-week exposure to sunlight revealed that the reflectance spectrum for Cs2AgBiBr6 changed drastically after two weeks, accompanied by the appearance of unidentified phases in the XRD pattern. This shows that the double perovskite phase had degraded over time. However, for Cs2AgBiCl6, the overall features of the reflectance spectrum remain more intact, accompanied by the total reflectance decrease in agreement with the visual darkening of the surface of the sample. Nevertheless, XRD patterns show no apparent change for the Cs2AgBiCl6 compound that was exposed to both light and air.47 It has been observed that with over 100 days of exposure to fluorescent lighting, pure Cs2AgBiBr6 (stored at ambient atmosphere) decomposes into Cs3Bi2Br9 and CsAgBr2 type phases which are the side products of Cs2AgBiBr6.85,121 The stability of perovskite materials can be better understood by an accurate evaluation of decomposition products and their formation energies. For instance, a typical decomposition pathway for Cs2AgBiBr6 may be:Cs2AgBiBr6 → 2CsBr + AgBr + BiBr3      for which the calculated decomposition enthalpies (ΔH) are 0.64, 0.24, 0.16, and 0.11 eV per formula unit (f.u.), respectively. These positive ΔH values indicate that Cs2AgBiBr6 will not decompose spontaneously. For MAPbI3, the ΔH value estimated by various reports for the decomposition reaction into MAI and PbI2 secondary phases is around 0.027 eV f.u−1.50 Hence, the larger ΔH value of Cs2AgBiBr6 renders it a more stable material than the conventional MAPbI3 for PSCs. Fig. 4 shows the decomposition energies of other double perovskites in which the In and Tl based compounds are unstable while Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 are comparatively stable.79 Slavney et al. (2016)46 backs the claim for the stability of Cs2AgBiBr6 by reporting a lack of mass loss in the thermogravimetric traces, up to 430 °C, which is well above the decomposition limit of MAPbI3. For Cs2AgBiI6, the lowest ΔHd was estimated to be negative 0.4 eV f.u−1 indicating that it may decompose spontaneously, and can be hardly synthesized under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, which explains why there is no experimental report on its successful synthesis.122
2. Device
In the PSC field today, stability testing protocols are not unanimous. This situation makes interlaboratory comparisons essentially impossible. Even compiling or comparisons of intralaboratory studies are doubtful due to variations in test protocols within individual research groups. As can be seen in Table 2, attempting a direct comparison of some of the most notable literature results reveal the differences and cautions in each measurement which shows that a direct comparison is perplexing. Hence, to assess the stability of the cells with the Cs2M+M3+X6 type absorbers, one is forced to look at them with an independent yardstick. In the assessment until now, it is evident that some of these materials could be promising alternatives for conventional Pb-based perovskites. Table 3 presents the performance comparison of PSCs based on different Cs2M+M3+X6 materials, among themselves and with the best performing Pb-halide PSCs reported to date. It must be noted that all the layers of the cell are thin films and differ only in deposition techniques. The effects of different precursor synthesis techniques,123,124 the film thickness, and deposition protocols124,125 are undoubtedly important factors that impact the cell performances and should be discussed in length. However, these factors are beyond the focus of this discussion and are carefully bypassed. Also, it must be noted that both the solution126 and vacuum deposition techniques127–129 are more or less equally efficient for small scale processes.
Table 2 Direct comparison of key PSC stability results adapted from data presented in reference literatures. Different conditions of each experiment must be noted and it must be realized that direct comparison of these stability data is not possible for both Cs2M+M3+X6 based PSCs and Pb-based PSCs

Therefore, it would be fair to compare the cell performances by the most fundamental aspects such as the choice of materials and the cell architecture. Greul et al. (2017)101 reported the first solar cell based on Cs2AgBiBr6 films with an Eg (>2.5 eV) comparable to that of single crystals and polycrystalline powders and demonstrated PCEs close to 2.5% with Voc exceeding 1 volt. This confirms a good alignment of the conduction band of the perovskite with TiO2 as predicted from the energy level diagram and in the computational studies. Even though the SLME of Cs2AgBiBr6 is reaching 7.92%, the wide bandgap of Cs2AgBiBr6 limits its exploitation to the full potential. As a result, low currents are expected from these devices. The bandgap could be lowered by Sb doping and one may expect an enhanced absorption and thereby Jsc. However, such cells do not show a considerable increase in PCE86,130,131 whereas material stability shows improvement.87 Apart from the reported obvious causes like poor thin-film qualities, Sb doping could have formed trap states, which can act as recombination centers thereby reducing the overall performance. The loss of more than two thirds of the absorbed photons due to very low electron diffusion lengths evolving from high electron trap density as demonstrated by Longo et al. clearly indicates the surface traps to be the origin of these photocurrent losses.99 Appropriate passivation of these defects becomes necessary. Current limiting processes in Cs2AgBiBr6 cells were also analysed by deriving IQE from measurements of EQE, and they suggest the importance of a built-in potential and non-selective contacts. Charge collection depends on the electric field which is affected by ion migration and high recombination rates at contacts. So reducing surface recombination will allow for higher photocurrents and voltages.132 Along with this, A site doping with alkali metal ions133,134 has shown to improve the perovskite film morphology, and X site doping with S135 has shown excellent stability. However, Sb doping at B the site, alkali at the A site, and S at the X site, and so on will just make the compound complex and result in difficulty in achieving desired stoichiometric ratios on a larger scale. Alternatively, Gao et al. (2018)136 claimed that the morphology of the film achieved by Greul et al. (2017)101 is poor, and could have led to ineffective charge extraction with a significant hysteresis effect. Hence the fabrication of high-quality Cs2AgBiBr6 films was realized by a fast-crystalline procedure using anti-solvent isopropanol (IPA) resulting in a smooth and uniform film morphology with micro-sized grains by controlling the post-annealing temperature. An efficient charge extraction by replacing TiO2 with Cu-NiO as the electron transport layer (ETL) and spiro-OMeTAD with C60/bathocuproine (BCP) as the hole transport layer (HTL) has also played an important role to achieve a PCE of 2.23% with no hysteresis. Moreover, owing to enhanced thermal and ambient stability of Cs2AgBiBr6, the solar cell device exhibited long term stability over 10 days when stored in air (50% RH).136 In a comparison of deposition techniques, Igbari et al. (2019)107 reported solution and vacuum processed devices presenting PCEs of 2.51% and 1.41%, respectively. The solution processed device showed a negligible hysteresis, possibly due to higher crystallinity, a lower bandgap, a longer charge carrier lifetime, and higher mobility compared to the vacuum-processed one. It must be noted that the effect of using a metal oxide HTLs (MoO3 in this case) rather than regular organic compound could have a beneficial influence on the stability as well.
Concerning the influence of the ETL, Ning et al. (2018)61 reported that the removal of the TiO2 layer did not change Jsc values of the cells, which shows that charge extraction is not affected. However, higher Voc values of the device with TiO2 defends its use to prevent carrier recombination at the ITO side. Similarly, thermally annealed Cs2AgBiBr6 films reported by Wu et al. (2018)137 showed a PCE of 1.44% when P3HT was used as the HTL, unlike the HTL-free device which showed a PCE of 0.86%. However, the cells with P3HT showed a reduction of PCE in the ambient atmosphere, compared to the HTL-free device with no obvious degradation for up to four months.120,137 Efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to HTL needs smooth transfer and was attempted via a gradient energy level. This could be realized by employing a set of HTLs using P3HT, MoO3, and PTAA.138 Here MoO3 protects the substrate (P3HT) and does not hinder the hole transport, because it is a p-type semiconductor. Further, Zn-chlorophyll was used as the HTL for the Cs2AgBiBr6 cell to achieve a PCE up to 2.79%, the second-highest value for double perovskite-based solar cells to date,139 with a Jsc of 3.83 mA cm−2, which is 22–27% higher than that of the devices with conventional HTLs such as spiro-OMeTAD, P3HT, and PTAA. This shows that the influence of charge transport layers on PCE and the stability of the cell is significant.
The presence of multiple layers leads to multiple interfaces. In the case of PSCs, the four interfaces (perovskite/ETL, perovskite/HTL, ETL/anode, and HTL/cathode) have a great impact on the performance. Interfaces are dynamic sites that host energy barriers, defects, charge/ion accumulation, migration, interdiffusion of molecules, bulk charge recombination, and many such events that make it necessary for the careful engineering of interfaces and interfacial materials. For instance, Cs2AgBiBr6 thin-films exhibit an unusual dual-migration of Ag and Br across other layers due to low formation energies of Ag and Br vacancies as well as low diffusive energy barriers.140 To tackle such interface activities, Luo et al. (2020)141 demonstrated dual interfacial engineering in Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells with C60/TiO2 as the ETL and hydrophobic PCDTFBT as the HTL, and this showed improved stability in the ambient environment, heat, stress, and light illumination and achieved 1.5% PCE. The highest efficiency reported to date for a Cs2M+M3+X6 type material is by Yang et al. (2020)142 by using the multifunctional interlayer of N719 dye between the Cs2AgBiBr6 absorber and the HTL. This reduces the charge carrier recombination and accelerates the hole extraction by an appropriate energy level alignment. In terms of stability, interfacial layers are protective shells for perovskites and can act as transit barriers for intermolecular diffusion and moisture. Hence, the right composition stoichiometry of perovskite, high quality of thin-films, the choice of charge transport layers, and the presence of an interfacial layer have all added up to achieve ∼3% PCE. This performance is way behind the benchmark set by Pb-halide counterparts.
Finally, though achieving the highest PCE is the first focus of the Pb-free PSC community, efforts to make them sustain their performance are also of paramount importance. In this regard, unlike the conventional ways of discussing strategies to improve PSC performance and their stabilities separately, integrating the two will make the studies meaningful.
Conclusions
Here, an assessment of the figures of merit for 3D Cs2M+M3+X6 type absorbers is presented to check their reliability in perovskite-based solar cells. The analysis was based on theoretical and experimental findings concerning band structures, optical absorption, charge carrier mobility and lifetimes, and the stability of these materials. There are over 30 variants in Cs2M+M3+X6 type materials that have been reported as potential candidates for solar cell absorbers. The Cs2M+M3+X6 family has revealed promising optoelectronic properties, portrayed by visible to near IR absorption and fairly small carrier effective mass. Of these, less than 10 have been realized into working devices. And none of the cells have shown PCE more than 3%. Despite a good theoretical efficiency rating, all the variants of Cs2M+M3+X6 type absorbers come with a myriad of limiting factors whose details are discussed in each section.
We find that 3D Cs2AgBiX6 is to-date an extensively studied material in the field of lead-free perovskite solar cells. Fundamental drawbacks of such AgBi based materials are the presence of energetic disorder, a high density of electron traps, large indirect band gaps that imply weak oscillator strengths for optical absorption, and strong electron-phonon coupling via Fröhlich interactions that limits carrier mobility. Although a single-crystal carrier lifetime up to 1 μs, with average charge-carrier mobility, and an absorption-edge in the visible region are achievable, the best films still report PCE of devices below 3%. The devices show very small Jsc, revealing loss of more than 80% of the absorbed photons, which is not usual, even for incipient materials and hence study on the origin of these photocurrent losses becomes very important. We suggest that the electron diffusion lengths in Cs2AgBiBr6 must be improved as a matter of priority by reducing electron traps, in order to achieve better performance. When these materials are drawn into films, the recombination increases due to the high density of surface defects. Diffusing them by appropriate passivation can seemingly be a solution to this problem. Improvements, possibly driven by reduction in trap densities, can also increase Voc and reduce hysteresis. Although such device engineering problems could be solved, the intrinsic properties that are the hallmark of AgBi based materials are not suitable for a robust, efficient absorber. Hence, early-stage researchers in this field are advised to look for new classes of materials that are in their preliminary stage of investigation. New materials include A2AgCrCl6 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), Cs2CuSbCl6, Cs2LiGaBr6, Cs2NaGaBr6, Cs2InGaBr6, Cs2TiBr6 and the others mentioned in the above sections.
Apart from Cs2M+M3+X6 types, materials that are in the race for use as Pb-free perovskite absorbers are AM2+X3 halide single perovskites, AM4+X3 chalcogenide single perovskites, and A3M2X9 and A2M3+M5+X6 chalcogenide double perovskites. All these material suggestions come from a tight screening process after high-throughput calculations. Such AI-assisted techniques have been under rapid development in recent years to accelerate materials discovery.
Based on our assessment, the answer to the question ofwhether 3D Cs2M+M3+X6 type absorbers are a reliable Pb-free alternative to highly efficient perovskite-based solar cells is negative. With the current alternatives, researchers have managed to fabricate solar cells; however, expecting performances on par with Pb-based perovskites will need alternative options.

 	Fig. 10  (A) Temperature dependence of the Cs2AgBiBr6 emission linewidth. The FWHM of single crystal Cs2AgBiBr6 steady-state PL spectra as a function of temperature; measured spectra provided in the inset for several different temperatures. The red line is made using the parameters Γ0 = 171.8 meV and ħω0 = 22 meV, while the measured contributions to the linewidth broadening induced by acoustic and LO phonon coupling are parsed via the blue and green traces, respectively. Reproduced with permission from ref. 110. (B) (a) Coherent oscillations for mentioned compounds. (b) Fourier amplitude map over the complete spectral range for Cs2AgBiBr6/PMMA. (c) Line positions and intensities from the non-resonant Raman experiments (λexc = 808 nm) and DFT calculations (blue) including assignments. (d) Visualization of the calculated intense Raman-active phonon mode of Cs2AgBiBr6 at 169 cm−1 having A1g symmetry (blue: bismuth, grey: silver, red: bromine, magenta: cesium). Displacement vectors are indicated as small light-green arrows. Reproduced with permission from ref. 113.
