Compared to conventional DSCs that can only be operated under front-side illumination, bifacial design will allow DSCs to generate up to 50% more electrical power. Besides, bifacial DSCs can be easily made transparent and may find broad applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) as power-generating windows and roof panels. Transparent counter electrodes (CEs) are key to the fabrication of bifacial DSCs. However, despite the fact that conventional Pt CE can be made transparent, its high cost and scarce source may hinder the large-scale application of DSCs. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop low-cost alternative CEs based on carbon materials, conducting polymers, inorganic compounds and their composites.

1. Introduction
With advantages of low-cost, easy-fabrication and reasonable conversion efficiency, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) offer a promising alternative to conventional Si-based photovoltaic devices.1–3 State-of-art DSC is composed of a mesoporous TiO2 film covered by a monolayer of sensitizer (dye-sensitized photoanode), an electrolyte containing a redox couple e.g. I−/I3− used as a mediator in regenerating the sensitizer and a counter electrode (CE) typically made of platinized fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass.4,5 As one of the basic components of DSCs, CE functions to catalyze the reduction of oxidative species in the electrolyte by passing them electrons collected from the external circuit; therefore, a competent CE material should be of sufficient conductivity and catalytic activity to fulfill such a function.4–6
When DSC works, if the incidental light is introduced through the photoanode, it is called front-side illumination and if through CE, it is then called rear-side illumination. DSCs that are able to work under either front- or rear-side illumination are referred as bifacial DSCs7 (see Fig. 1). With the ability to utilize the incidental light from both sides, bifacial design is a smart way to improve the power generation efficiency of DSCs.7,8 Compared to conventional DSCs that can only be operated under front-side illumination, bifacial DSCs are able to generate up to 50% more electrical power, especially when they are applied with reflecting devices.9,10 Besides, bifacial DSCs can be easily made transparent and may find broad applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) such as power-generating windows and roof panels. Therefore, the development of bifacial DSCs is of great importance for the practical application of DSCs.

The fabrication of bifacial DSCs requires a transparency of CEs. In addition, the characterization of bifacial DSCs is similar to conventional DSCs. Typically, the photovoltaic characteristics of a bifacial DSC are measured under front- and rear-side illumination separately, and the device performance is evaluated by the front- and rear-side power conversion efficiencies (PCEfront and PCErear, respectively) and the PCErear/PCEfront ratio. For given photoanode and electrolyte, the PCEfront and PCErear/PCEfront ratio are mainly determined by the catalytic activity and the transparency of the CE. A well-performed bifacial DSC should exhibit both high PCEfront and PCErear/PCEfront ratio, which means high catalytic activity and transparency are both required for CEs.
Traditional Pt CE can be made transparent or semitransparent by reducing the amount of Pt deposited on the FTO glass. The first bifacial DSC was fabricated by Ito et al. with a transparent Pt CE and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼6% that was obtained corresponding to front- or rear-side illumination.7 However, Pt is not an ideal material for the mass production of DSCs due to its scarce source and high cost (0.1 g m−2 Pt is needed in DSCs corresponding to a 5 nm film thickness, which costs about 4.6 USD m−2 without considering the production cost and the methods used for preparing Pt CE are typically highly energy-consuming).11–13 On the other hand, the high reflectance of Pt film could also hinder the preparation of high performance bifacial DSCs.10 Tremendous efforts have been made to develop low-cost Pt-free CEs based on carbon materials,14–16 conducting polymers,17–19 inorganic compounds20–22 and their composites23–25 (the costs of these CEs, which vary with the different materials and methods used for preparing them, are 10–10000 orders of magnitude lower than that of Pt CE), from which transparent Pt-free CEs are also expected. In this feature article, we intend to pay special attention to the recent advances in Pt-free transparent CEs and highlight their applications in bifacial DSCs. In some cases, these CEs were not characterized under rear-side illumination but promising application of them in bifacial DSCs could still be expected.
2. Pt-free transparent counter electrodes
2.1. Carbon materials
Carbon materials are the most extensively studied alternative CEs to Pt. However, in most cases, carbon-based CEs should be made very thick (typically in the range of 1–150 μm) to get the desired conductivity and catalytic activity, which obviously makes them optically non-transparent.14,26–30 It was found that a CNT film with a transmittance of 40% at 550 nm (T550 = 0.4) could exhibit comparable charge transfer resistance (Rct) (1.8 Ω cm2) for the reduction of I3− to ∼10–20 μm opaque carbon black films. However, the Rct values were increased to 4.2 and 13.5 Ω cm2 corresponding to thinner CNT films with higher transmittance of 74% and 88%, respectively. Nevertheless, these CNT films were not tested in DSCs.31 In a similar study, Lee et al. showed that transparent CNT CEs could be simply prepared by reducing the film thickness, but a compromise in the device performance was inevitable.32 Realizing that it was naturally difficult to simultaneously obtain high transparency and good catalytic activity from conventional CNTs, Cha and coworkers proposed to prepare highly transparent CNT CEs using CNT micro-balls in which CNTs were densely packed, so as to provide sufficient active area. Meanwhile, the transparency of the CNT film could be tuned by controlling the density of the CNT micro-balls. The PCE of DSC using CNT micro-balls CE approached 80% of that using Pt CE (6.37%) at T550 = 0.7.33 Recently, Seo et al. prepared a highly transparent (T550 = ∼0.8) CE by self-assembly of single-walled CNT (SWNT) on a FTO substrate, which showed a PCE of ∼4.7% under front- or rear-side illumination in a [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+(bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) mediated bifacial DSC (Fig. 2).34 The method they used seems to be an attractive way to prepare transparent CNT electrodes with high catalytic activities.

Graphene, a 2-dimentional allotrope of carbon, is believed to be a promising electrode material for electronic devices due to its excellent conductivity and transparency.35 However, it is recognized that defect-free bulk graphene is not an ideal CE material for a lack of active sites, which could be a limiting factor for preparing transparent graphene CEs.12,30 Instead of using bulk graphene, small graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) that have a large number of active edges were proposed for better catalytic activity. PCEs of ∼5% were obtained with highly transparent CEs (T550 = 0.87) prepared from GNPs, which were over 70% that of Pt-based devices.30 Though these CEs were not tested under rear-side illumination, their promising application as bifacial DSCs can still be expected. In another study, nitrogen-doping was used to prepare highly catalytic and transparent graphene CEs, which produced PCEs of 6.12% and 5.23% under front- and rear-side illumination, respectively, at T550 = 0.77. In comparison, a PCE of 6.89% was achieved with Pt CE under the same conditions.36 Besides, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was also used to prepare transparent CEs for DSCs, but their performance was much lower than Pt CEs.37,38 Typically, it is hard for graphene based CEs to achieve comparable performance to Pt CE in I-mediated DSCs for graphene's intrinsic low catalytic activity for I3− reduction.12 However, performance comparable or even superior to Pt CE is achievable for graphene CEs in Co-mediated DSCs.39–41 PCEs > 9% were achieved with transparent GNP CEs (T550 = 0.66) in DSCs using [Co(bpy-pz)2]3+/2+ (bpy-pz = 6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) or [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couples in combination with a triphenylamine-based dye coded Y123, which were higher than that (∼8%) obtained with Pt CE (Fig. 3a and b).39,40 However, one major problem for such CEs is the poor adhesion of GNP onto the FTO substrate, which would increase the dark current in DSCs and thus lower the open-circuit voltage, causing concerns for the device's long-term stability. In a further study, this problem was solved by incorporating GO into the GNP film, as the strong interaction of GO with FTO could dramatically improve the mechanical stability of graphene electrodes. The pristine GO exhibited almost no catalytic activity towards [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ before heat treatment in inert atmosphere (GO-HT) or chemical reduction with hydrazine (RGO) was applied. The former treatment was found to be better and used for the activation of GO/GNP CEs. The optimal GO/GNP CE contained 50 wt% of GO, which led to PCEs of 9.1% and 9.3% under 1 sun front-side illumination at T550 = 0.8 and 0.69 (according to different carbon loading), respectively, almost the same as that achieved with pure GNP CEs. Besides, an 8.8% PCE was obtained with pure GO-HT CE at T550 as high as 0.86, comparable to 9% of Pt CE (Fig. 3c and d).41 These efficiencies are much higher than that obtained with similar CEs in I-mediated DSCs, suggesting the importance of a good match between the CEs and redox couples,12,42 highlighting the prospect for preparing highly efficient Co-mediated bifacial DSCs with transparent graphene CEs.

Apart from the carbon-based transparent CEs mentioned above, our group has developed a novel transparent carbon CE with excellent catalytic activity and mechanical stability by in situ carbonization of an organic precursor coating on FTO glass in an argon atmosphere (Fig. 4) at 500 °C. Under optimal conditions, carbon CEs with ∼70% transparencies over the whole visible spectrum were prepared and used to fabricate bifacial DSCs. The best performing device showed a PCEfront of 6.07%, which was slightly lower than that using Pt CE (6.89%), while the PCErear (5.04%) approached 85% that of front-side illumination (Fig. 4). Due to the good connection between the carbon layer and FTO, the device also exhibited promising long-term stability.43 This work provides a new solution for preparing high performance transparent carbon CEs and better results are expected by a further optimization of the composition of the organic precursor.

In summary, CNT and graphene can be used to prepare transparent CEs, but their catalytic activities are strongly dependent on the film thickness when a I3−/I− electrolyte is used, which will blur their applications in I-mediated bifacial DSCs. In contrast, promising applications of highly transparent CNT and graphene CEs in Co-mediated bifacial DSCs are highlighted. Interestingly, transparent carbon CE prepared by an in situ carbonization method has shown considerable performance in I-mediated DSC and its application in Co-mediated DSCs is expected.
2.2. Conducting polymers
In recent years, conducting polymers such as polyaniline (PANI),17,44–49 polypyrrole (PPy),18,50–52 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)53–57 and poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT)58–60 (Fig. 5) have drawn much attention as alternative CEs for DSCs for their excellent catalytic activities, good conductivity, low cost, easy preparation, low-temperature processability, flexibility as well as good transparency. Among them, PANI is most favorable for high performance bifacial DSCs, because it is quite transparent in visible region (that is complementary with most of the dyes used in DSCs), which helps to reduce the light loss on the rear side and its excellent catalytic activity and conductivity allow the PANI film to be made as thin as possible to get high transparency.17 It should be noted that PANI can exist in forms of leucoemeraldine (fully reduced state), emeraldine (half oxidized state) and pernigraniline (fully oxidized state), but only emeraldine PANI has shown appropriate catalytic activity and the conductivity of emeraldine PANI can be remarkably improved by acid doping.44,61 Therefore, acid doped emeradine PANI has been preferentially used for CEs in DSCs.

It was typically difficult to prepare PANI film via simple solution-based methods, due to PANI's poor solubility in most organic solvents. However, camphorsulfonic acid (CSA)-doped PANI are soluble in m-cresol, which makes it possible to prepare transparent PANI CE by a facile spin-coating method.45 Moreover, the CSA-doped PANI film prepared from m-cresol was found to exhibit excellent conductivity that enabled Sung et al. to prepare a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)-free transparent PANI CE.46 At optimized conditions, PANI CE presented a promising PCEfront of 5.5% and PCErear of 2.67% in a bifacial DSC. In a study conducted by Zhang et al.,47 nanostructured PANI films were grown on FTO by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the film thickness was controlled by changing the number of sweep segments i.e. the deposition time. The PANI film prepared with moderate sweep segments (25 segments) was quite transparent (the transmittance was not shown by the authors) and produced a PCE of 4.73% in DSC, which was just slightly lower than that of DSCs assembled with PANI CEs prepared with more sweep segments.
Our group has prepared a highly transparent PANI film (T550 = 0.7) on FTO by an in situ chemical polymerization method and used it as a CE to fabricate a bifacially active transparent DSC.17 The as-prepared PANI film appeared quite uniform and smooth when looked at with naked eyes but showed a porous microstructure at nanoscale as revealed by SEM (Fig. 6a and b), which rendered it with a high surface area and thus good catalytic activity that was comparable to Pt CE. Fig. 6c shows the bifacial DSC prepared in our work, which gave a 6.54% PCEfront comparable to 6.69% of Pt-based devices and the PCErear was 4.26% (Fig. 6d), approaching 65% that of front-side illumination. The high PCErear/PCEfront ratio benefited from the complementary absorption properties of the PANI and N3 dye used in our work.

With a similar in situ chemical deposition method used for preparing transparent PANI CE, transparent PPy CEs were also successfully fabricated in our group and PCEs of 5.74% and 3.06% were obtained with front- and rear-side illumination, respectively, compared to 6.76% of the device using a Pt CE (Fig. 7).18 Recently, ultra thin PPy nanosheets were synthesized and coated on FTO glass as CEs for DSCs in Im's laboratory.51 With a T550 of ∼0.6, the pristine PPy CE exhibited a 5.7% PCE, close to that obtained in our work. HCl vapor treatment was applied to improve the conductivity of the pristine PPy CE, which led to an increase in PCE to 6.8%. However, the rear-side performance of the device was not shown in their work.

Though PEDOT is known for its good transparency, there are few reports presenting the application of transparent PEDOT CEs in (bifacial) DSCs. Pringle et al. studied the electrodeposition of PEDOT on plastic ITO-PEN substrates as CEs for DSCs.54 They found that the electrochemical activity of the PEDOT film linearly increased with deposition time (5–30 s), but no significant influence of deposition time on the performance of DSC was observed. This phenomenon was explained by the sufficient electrochemical activity of PEDOT CE that was no more a limiting factor in determining the efficiency of DSC. Thus, it can be inferred that with short deposition time (<10 s), transparent PEDOT CEs are available for bifacial DSCs. Han et al. demonstrated a bifacial DSC with a highly transparent electrodeposited PEDOT CE (transmittance > 91%) and a new thiolate/disulfide (AT−/BAT) electrolyte.62 The new redox couple AT−/BAT was designed to replace the traditional I−/I3− couple, which has a strong absorption in the visible region and thus hinders the rear-side efficiency of bifacial DSCs (Fig. 8a). With advantages of transparent PEDOT CE and a colorless electrolyte, the device showed PCEs of 6.07% and 4.35%, according to front- and rear-side illumination, respectively. In comparison, the I−/I3− electrolyte was also tested, and a lower PCErear was obtained (3.93%) (Fig. 8b). Except for increasing the transparency of CEs, Han's work proved that the reduction of the light loss in the electrolyte (by developing a colorless iodine-free electrolyte) was also an efficient way to improve the rear-side efficiency of bifacial DSCs.

Park et al. reported a Pt- and TCO-free CE based on a highly conductive (800 S/cm) PEDOT film prepared by a pre-solution/in situ polymerization method. A thin PEDOT film of ∼60 nm thickness showed a surface resistivity of 130 Ω cm−1 and a T550 = 0.88, gave a PCE of 5.08% in DSC, which was comparable to Pt CE (5.88%).63 In a recent work, Shiratori et al. prepared a flexible, TCO-free, transparent CE by combining PEDOT/PSS and a Ag network substrate, where the Ag network functioned as a conductive layer, while the PEDOT/PSS served as both catalyst and barrier against the corrosion of Ag by iodine. With transmittance of ∼60% at 450 nm, CE did not perform well in DSCs, only 1.02% and 0.61% PCEs were obtained for front- and rear-side illumination, respectively, due to the lack of catalytic surface. After incorporating TiO2 nanoparticles into the PEDOT/PSS layer, PCEfront was remarkably improved to 5.13%, which was close to the 5.36% of Pt-based DSC. However, the influence of TiO2 on the transparency of CE was not mentioned.64
Although encouraging progress has been made towards the development of cost-effective transparent polymer CEs for bifacial DSCs, there much effort is still needed before they can be used in practical applications, including the stability test, development of flexible and TCO-free polymer CEs as well as seeking new polymers with better performance than the current materials.
2.3. Inorganic compounds
Recently, inorganic metal compounds including sulfides,20,65–72 carbides,21,22 nitrides,22,73 and oxides22,74 are emerging as a new class of Pt-free CEs for DSCs. Among the number of papers that have been published, only a few of sulfides were reported to be able to be made transparent. Meng et al. for the first time prepared a transparent electrodeposited NiS CE with a periodic potential reversal (PR) technique,65 which yielded a 6.82% PCE in DSC employing a I−/I3− electrolyte that competed with Pt CE (7%). However, the performance of this kind of NiS CE, found by Han et al.,66 was insufficient in thiolate/disulfide mediated DSCs (PCE = 4.1%). By changing the PR period from 10 to 1, they produced a highly transparent (T550 = 0.9) NiS CE containing a greater content of sulfur, which showed better catalytic activity towards the thiolate/disulfide redox couple, resulting in a much higher PCE of 6.25%. Lin et al. did serial research to prepare transparent CEs with CoS nanosheets and NiCo2S4 nanoparticles,67–69 which have a general transmittance of 60–80%, yielding PCEs around 6%, which were comparable to that of DSCs using Pt CEs.
In a study by Li et al.,70 the morphology dependence of MoS2 transparent CEs was investigated with multi-layered MoS2 (ML-MoS2) sheets, few-layered MoS2 (FL-MoS2) sheets and MoS2 nanoparticles (MoS2-NPs). They found that FL-MoS2, with the highest BET surface area, gave the lowest PCE (1.74%) in DSC, which was much lower than that of ML-MoS2 (2.92%) and MoS2-NPs (5.41%). Further, it was proposed that the catalytically active sites of layered MoS2 lay only on edges; therefore, ML-MoS2 contained more active sites than FL-MoS2, and the MoS2-NPs composed of small particles of ML-MoS2, had the largest number of active sites, which explained their performance in DSCs. However, with a similar film thickness, the FL-MoS2 CE showed the highest transparency. With high catalytic activity and moderate transparency, MoS2-NPs CEs may have promising applications in bifacial DSCs. In order to improve the catalytic activity of MoS2 CE, active edge sites were artificially created by patterning holes on MoS2 atomic layers, which led to a dramatic improvement of the device performance from 2% to 5.8%. Besides, the transmittance of MoS2 CE was also greatly enhanced (T550 = 0.7 vs. 0.8).71 However, the method used for preparing hole-patterned MoS2 CE is somewhat complicated.
In a recent study,72 Chen et al. prepared a semitransparent FeS2 film (T550 = 0.6) from FeS2 nanocrystal (NC) ink by spin-coating and used it as CE to fabricate a bifacial DSC (Fig. 9a). The as-synthesized FeS2 NCs were covered by long alkyl chain ligands (oleic acid and oleylamine), which would impede the charge transport of FeS2 CE. Thus, FeS2 CE was treated with ethanedithiol to remove the insulating ligands. This led to an improvement in the device performance from 5.74% to 7.31%, under front-side illumination, comparable to 7.52% of DSC using Pt CE (Fig. 9b). The corresponding PCErear was 4.17%, which approached 57% of that from front-side illumination (Fig. 9c). They also demonstrated a flexible transparent FeS2 CE on an ITO/PET substrate, which exhibited a 6.36% PCE in DSC (Fig. 9d). These results suggest the versatile application of FeS2 in bifacial DSCs.

So far, the reported transparent CEs based on inorganic compounds are still limited to sulfides such as NiS, CoS, MoS2 and FeS2, and most of them have not been tested in DSCs with rear-side illumination. Consequently, more study is expected to evaluate their performance in bifacial DSCs with illumination from both sides and to explore new transparent CEs from carbides, nitrides and so on.
2.4. Composite materials
Except for using the above-mentioned materials alone, composites of two or more of them were also used as CEs in DSCs.11 Combining the advantages of all materials, composite CEs usually performed better than their individual components. The strategy of using composite materials is especially beneficial for fabricating high performance transparent CEs. Because a major problem in the preparation of transparent CEs is that it is usually difficult to get desired transparency, conductivity and catalytic activity from a single material, which is supposed to be solved by using composite materials.
In 2008, Shi et al. reported a transparent CE made of a graphene/PEDOT/PSS composite film, which showed a 4.5% PCE in DSC.75 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a Pt-free transparent composite CE. However, very little work has been done on the fabrication of Pt-free transparent composite CEs since then. Recently, Lin et al. prepared a transparent MoS2-graphene nanosheet (GNS) composite film by electrophoretic deposition and used it as CEs in DSCs.76 The MoS2-GNS CE showed a transmittance over 70% in the visible region, and the DSC using this CE gave a PCE of 5.81%, which was higher than that of cells using MoS2 CE (4.15%) and GNS CE (2.68%) and comparable to Pt-based DSC (6.24%). The superior performance was achieved by the synergistic effect of the intrinsically high electrochemical activity from MoS2 and facile electron transport from GNS. More recently, transparent PANI/RGO CE was fabricated by a two-step method, which involved a pre-polymerization of aniline onto GO and electrostatic deposition of them onto FTO, followed by a chemical reduction of the PANI/GO film with hydroiodic acid. A 15 min deposition time was found to be optimal, the corresponding PANI/RGO CE (T550 = 0.9) showed a PCEfront of 7.84% and a PCErear of 6.08% (PCErear/PCEfront = 0.78) compared to 6.7% and 4.63% (PCErear/PCEfront = 0.69) of PANI CE (T550 = 0.7) prepared under similar conditions. The better performance of the PANI/RGO composite CE was attributed to the improved transparency, conductivity and catalytic activity. Moreover, the stability of PANI CE was also improved after introducing RGO.77
One challenge of preparing high quality graphene CEs is their poor electronic connection to the FTO substrates, which could undermine their performance in DSCs. To overcome this, Mendes et al. introduced Ni NPs between graphene and the FTO substrate, where the Ni NPs helped to restore the graphene double bonds and thus improved electronic contact at graphene/FTO interface.78 In their study, the transparent graphene/Ni CE was prepared by spray-deposition of oxidized GNP on Ni NPs decorated FTO, followed by thermal annealing under an inert atmosphere. Both water and ethanol were used as solvents for the deposition of oxidized GNP. The graphene/Ni CEs prepared with both solvents showed similar PCEs in DSCs (7.51% in water vs. 7.54% in ethanol) that competed with the Pt CE (7.45%) (Fig. 10), while the CE prepared with ethanol was more transparent than the one prepared with water (T550 = 0.92 vs. 0.81) due to the different solvation effect on oxidized GNP. As no corrosion of Ni NPs was observed by the authors, this kind of CEs should be promising in real applications.

As discussed before, the performance of Pt-free CEs are often limited to their insufficient catalytic activity. To this point, small amounts of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) (1–2 μg cm−2)79,80 are often incorporated into these CEs to get better photovoltaic performance. The quantity of Pt used is almost an order of magnitude lower that of pure Pt CE (according to our calculation in the previous section), which means a minor increase in the total cost of CEs. Therefore, though our focus is on Pt-free transparent CEs, the progress of low-cost, Pt-loaded transparent composite CEs and their applications in bifacial DSCs is also reviewed.
By using an ionic liquid-assisted sonochemical method, Su et al. synthesized composites of CNT (MWNT, SWNT) supported Pt NPs and electrospayed them on FTO glass as CEs for DSCs.81 The CNT/Pt composite CEs exhibited excellent catalytic activity for I3− reduction with a weak dependence on film thickness. With a thickness of about 100 nm, MWNT/Pt CE showed a transparency of ∼65% at 550 nm, resulting in a PCE of 8.81%, which is close to that of the Pt-based DSC (8.84%), while the SWNT/Pt CE gave a ∼70% transparency and a PCE of 8.52%. They also demonstrated a PCE as high as 8.43% with a flexible MWNT/Pt CE on a ITO/PET substrate, but the transparency of the flexible CE was not illustrated. Wang et al. reported a self-assembled monolayer of graphene/Pt as CE for DSC with a PCE of 7.66% was obtained.82 Though not shown in their work, the transparency of the graphene/Pt CE was claimed by the authors. Recently, Choi et al. also made an effort to prepare Pt-loaded graphene as transparent CEs for DSCs.83 In their study, the graphene layer was constructed by chemical vapor deposition and then transferred onto FTO glass, followed by the deposition of Pt NPs using dry plasma reduction (DPR) under atmospheric pressure at near room temperature (Fig. 11a). The graphene/Pt composite film showed almost the same transparency (T550 = 0.8) as pure graphene film in the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm (Fig. 11b). The bifacial DSC with such a graphene/Pt CE exhibited PCEs of 6.55% and 5.17% under front- and rear-side illumination, respectively (Fig. 11c). This low temperature processed graphene/Pt CEs should be possibly prepared on flexible substrates. Instead of sequential deposition of graphene and Pt, a hybrid of GNP and Pt NPs was prepared using poly(oxyethylene)-segmented oligo(imide) (POE-imide) as the dispersant and spin-coated onto FTO to fabricate transparent GNP/Pt CEs (Fig. 11d and e). DSC using such GNP/Pt CE reached an optimized PCEfront of 8% at 5:1 weight ratio of Pt (H2PtCl6) and GNP for optimized size and distribution of the Pt NPs, which was higher than 7.14% of the Pt based cell. Meanwhile, the DSC maintained 88% of its efficiency (PCErear = 7.01%) when irradiated from the rear side (Fig. 11f).84 However, this method is not applicable to plastic substrates, since high temperature sintering is required to remove the dispersant. More recently, Kim et al. fabricated a transparent GO/Pt composite CE, in which the Pt particles were deposited onto the surface of GO by pulse current deposition. The corresponding DSC showed a 7.1% PCE.85

Peng et al. spin-coated the composites of PANI/Pt on plastic ITO/PET substrates and used them as transparent CEs for flexible bifacial DSCs.86 The PANI/Pt composite CE showed excellent transparency in the visible region (T550 ≈ 0.7) and produced PCEs of 5.4% and 4.0% in the corresponding DSC under front- and rear-side illumination, respectively, which were higher than that of the Pt-based device (5.1% and 3.8%). In a further study,80 they prepared PANI/Pt CEs on FTO and investigated the influence of Pt loading on their catalytic performance with quasi-solid state DSCs using a PVDF-HFP/TiO2 electrolyte. They found that a 1.5 μg cm−2 Pt loading was enough to get a high catalytic activity, which produced PCEs of 6.34% and 3.85% in the solid-state device under front- and rear-side illumination, respectively. Brown et al. reported a highly transparent CoS/Pt composite CE (T550 = 0.8) for rear-illuminated DSC and bifacial DSC,87 which was prepared by the simultaneous electrodeposition of CoS and Pt on FTO from a mixture solution of both precursors. The bifacial DSC using such a CoS/Pt CE reached PCEs of 6.15% and 4.45% under front- and rear-side illumination, respectively, compared to 6.15% and 4.15% of the device using electrodeposited Pt CE of a similar transparency.
We noticed that graphene has been widely used as a functional component to prepare transparent composite CEs with other materials, which can be attributed to its excellent conductivity and transparency. It is noteworthy that though pure Pt CE is unfavorable in DSCs, the development of Pt-loaded CEs could be a practical option as the amount of Pt needed is extremely low. Considering the large number of CE materials, except for the composite CEs mentioned above, there should be far more possible combinations, which are expected in future exploration.
3. Conclusions and outlook
Bifacial DSCs that are able to harvest the incidental light from both sides have attracted much attention in recent years for their enhanced power generation efficiency and possibility to be made transparent for see-through applications compared to state-of-art monofacial DSCs. CEs of good catalytic activity and transparency are crucial for the fabrication of efficient bifacial DSCs. Though conventional Pt CE can be made transparent, its application in DSCs is unfavorable for its high cost and limited source. Many efforts have been made to prepare alternative transparent CEs based on carbon materials, conducting polymers, inorganic compounds and composites of them with some of them showing promising applications in bifacial DSCs as listed in Table 1.

Traditional carbon materials such as carbon black, activated carbon, mesoporous carbon are unlikely to be made transparent. CNTs and graphene can be used to prepare transparent CEs; however, their performance is poor in conventional I-mediated DSCs for their intrinsic low catalytic activity towards the reduction of I3−. Better performance is expected by modifying them and/or by using other redox shuttles. Very encouraging results (PCEfront ≈ 9%) have already been achieved with transparent graphene based CEs in Co-mediated DSCs. Noticeably, in situ carbonization of organic precursors offers a promising way to prepare highly transparent carbon CE with excellent catalytic activity and mechanical stability. Conducting polymers such as PANI, PPy, PEDOT etc. are promising candidates for flexible and transparent CEs due to their excellent transparency, catalytic activity and low-temperature processability. Amongst the kinds of inorganic compounds (sulfides, carbides, nitrides, oxides and phosphides) that have been explored as alternative CEs in DSCs, only a few sulfides e.g. NiS, CoS, MoS2 and FeS2 have been made transparent. Further study is needed to figure out whether it is possible to prepare transparent CEs from other compounds. Except for using a single material, the strategy of using composite materials offers a new opportunity to fabricate high performance transparent CEs. Moreover, graphene has shown its versatile application in fabricating transparent composite CEs for its good transparency and conductivity. It will be arbitrary to conclude which one these CEs is better because each of them has unique advantages and is worthy of further exploration.
However, most of these CEs have only been tested in I-mediated DSCs, study of them in DSCs using other redox couples is expected to see if there is any room for further improvement of the device performance because a better match with other redox couples maybe possible and the light absorption of the I3−/I− electrolyte that will reduce the rear-illuminated efficiencies of DSCs could be overcome using its colorless alternatives. Prior to real application, the long-term stability of these CEs in DSCs should be further explored especially for polymer-based CEs. Besides, the development of other low-cost transparent CEs and the preparation of these CEs on flexible and/or TCO-free substrates are also desired.
