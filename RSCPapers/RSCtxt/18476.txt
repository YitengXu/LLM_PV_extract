Despite significant narrow band absorption enhancements in the visible region, the reported enhancements in the overall performance of the cell under standard AM1.5 sunlight illumination are not significant. We numerically design an array of Au stripes on the surface of an extremely thin layer of hematite to maximize the number of charge carriers that can reach the hematite–water interface and explore the optical processes involved. The lateral dimensions and in particular the thickness of the Au stripes turn out to be influential parameters for the overall enhancement that Au stripes provide. In general, the thickness of Au stripes for the optimized structure needs to be larger than 100 nm to obtain overall enhancements higher than 25% at incidence angles of up to 40°. The optimized structure is robust against edge bluntness, which is usually an artefact of the fabrication process. However, the presence of a 5 nm SiO2 insulating layer decreases the enhancement of the optimized configuration to 16%. These insights give important clues to design efficient plasmonic enhanced light harvesting structures for extremely thin layers of hematite.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting1 establishes a process to simultaneously capture and store the energy of sunlight inside the chemical bonds of hydrogen molecules. Hydrogen can be either used directly as a fuel or can be alternatively transformed into higher density fuels such as methanol or formic acid in a green process that reduces the carbon dioxide emission.2 A standard PEC device usually comprises an n-type semiconductor that absorbs light and oxidizes the water to oxygen. Water reduction (2H+ + 2e− → 2H2) takes place at the counter electrode.
Recently, visible light absorbing semiconductors such as nitrides,3 oxynitrides,4 hematite,5–7 and bismuth vanadate8 have attracted attention due to their potential of achieving 10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency.1 Among these compounds, the α-phase of Fe2O3, also known as hematite, is the most appealing due to its wide availability at low-costs as well as its significant optical absorption of visible light. However, its short carrier transport distance of about 10 nm and relatively large visible light absorption depth of 100 nm pose significant design challenges to achieve efficient hematite photoanodes.5
To circumvent the above-mentioned problem, one can control the nanostructure so that all the material is within 10 nm of the electrolyte interface while the optical thickness remains large enough to absorb a significant amount of sunlight energy. Mesoporous cauliflower structures of hematite possess such a feature and hence they deliver the highest recorded photocurrent of 3.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential when IrO2 oxygen evolution catalysts are used.7 Another route involves using dense layers of extremely thin layers in which the absorption is enhanced through using guest–host configurations,9 resonant light absorption,10 or plasmonic effects in nanostructures of noble metals.11–13
Nanostructures of noble metals such as Au and Ag support surface plasmon polariton (SPP) resonances in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. These SPP resonances can trap light at the metals immediate vicinity by coupling the optical oscillations into the collective oscillation of the free electrons in the metal.14 Such an effect is called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and it can provide near-field enhancements of up to 105 within a distance of 5 to 10 nm from the metallic nanostructures.15,16 Several efforts have been made to use the LSPR of nanoparticles to enhance the absorption in hematite photoanodes.11–13 However, the majority of these efforts do not show improvements in the overall performance of the photoanode under AM1.5 sunlight illumination. Nevertheless, at certain wavelength ranges, significant enhancements in the absorption and optoelectronic conversion efficiencies have been reported.
The importance of designing appropriate dimensions of plasmonic nanostructures has been recently highlighted in Au-core silica-shell nanoparticles12 and in Au discs patterned onto the hematite surface. Iandolo et al. recently reported about 6% enhancement in the overall performance of hematite layers having a carefully designed, ordered array of Au discs on the surface.13 So far, interspacing and lateral dimensions of the Au features have been considered as important design parameters whereas little attention has been paid to the thickness of Au features.
Here we report on the design of an ordered array of Au stripes with a rectangular cross section placed on the surface of a 10 nm thick layer of hematite (Fig. 1a) to maximize optical absorption within its charge collection volume. The effective charge collection volume is depicted in Fig. 1b. Such stripes can be produced in large-scale processes such as interference lithography17 or nano-imprint18 techniques. Nevertheless, the insights obtained are useful in absorption enhancement strategies that involve near field of plasmonic nanostructures placed on the surface of hematite.11–13 At optimized width and interspacing of Au stripes, the absorption in hematite dramatically decreases as Au thickness is reduced below 100 nm. Under the transverse electric (TE) light incidence, Au stripes enhance the optical absorption within hematite over the entire wavelength range. On the other hand, the transverse magnetic (TM) light incidence deteriorates the optical absorption of hematite in ultraviolet whereas it significantly enhances the absorption at plasmonic resonance wavelengths of Au stripes. An insulating silica layer is usually placed between Au and hematite to prevent charge recombination at the Au–hematite interface. The presence of a 5 nm thick silica layer, however, deteriorates the absorption enhancement from 28 to 16%.

Cell structure and computational tools
The reference hematite cell consists of a dense 10 nm thick hematite layer deposited onto fluorinated tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass, as shown in Fig. 1a. A 2 nm thick Nb2O5 layer is placed between FTO and hematite to prevent back injection of the photogenerated holes into the FTO.19 Such layers can be produced in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) or in a chemical vapor deposition process in which film thickness and surface roughness can be controlled at the sub-nanometer range.20 On top of the hematite layer, there is the electrolyte—usually an aqueous KOH solution. The plasmonic structure, placed at the hematite–water interface, consists of a periodic array of Au stripes of width w, spacing T, and thickness h. We optimize the interspacing, thickness, and width of the stripes to determine the ideal conditions maximizing the optical absorption within the charge collection volume of hematite (Fig. 1b). The cell is illuminated from the glass side because, under TE polarized light, incidence front-side illumination results in a significant light reflection from and dissipation in Au stripes (see electronic supplementary information, Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). The portion of optical absorption in hematite that takes place within 10 nm distance from the water–hematite interface, i.e. within the carrier collection volume, is taken into account for performance evaluation. In our calculations, we keep the widely used assumption of neglecting heating or charge injection of Au features into hematite.21 We should mention that the absorbed light in Au may contribute to the water splitting process due to the generation of hot-electrons, although we do not include the generated photocurrent due to this effect into our calculations.22
The interaction of light with the structure is modeled by Maxwell's equations numerically solved using the finite elements method. Literature data of dielectric permittivity (ε′ + iε′′) are used for Au, hematite, and niobium oxide.23 Sunlight illumination is simulated as an equal combination of TM and TE polarizations impinging on the structures from the glass side. The light absorption in hematite is calculated as the dissipation loss of the electromagnetic field inside the carrier collection volume (Fig. 1b) described by A(λ) = (1/Pinc) × ∫(1/2)ωε′′hematite|E(,λ)|2d3, where |E(,λ)| is the magnitude of the electric field, ε′′hematite is the imaginary part of the dielectric constant of hematite,24 and Pinc is the power carried by the incident wave. The integration is carried out over those parts of hematite that are within 10 nm of the hematite–water interface. This absorption is an interband photon absorption process in which a photon moves an electron away from the hematite valence band to its conduction band, thus creating an electron–hole pair.
To evaluate the overall performance of the plasmonic structures we define and compare the integrated optical absorption weighted by AM1.5 irradiance. Integrated optical absorption is calculated from the optical absorption in hematite by Ja = (e/hc)∫A(λ).ΦAM1.5(λ).λ.dλ, where ΦAM1.5(λ) describes the AM1.5 irradiance. We refer to these Ja values as absorbed current densities. The water splitting photocurrent density JH2O is a product of the generation rate of the carriers due to optical absorption (Ja), the separation efficiency of photogenerated carrier (ηCS), and the transfer efficiency of charge carriers cross hematite/water interface (ηCT); JH2O = Ja × ηCS × ηCT.25 Charge separation efficiency as well as the charge transfer efficiency is determined from the electronic properties of hematite and the kinetic energy of charge transfer across the hematite–water interface.
Results and discussion
Fig. 2a–2c show the enhancements in Ja values calculated as the stripe widths (w) vary from 20 to 60 nm, at stripe interspacings (T) of 100 to 400 nm and Au thicknesses of 50, 100, and 150 nm. The (w, T) = (20, 100) nm case provides the largest enhancement at all Au thicknesses. Fig. 2a–2c reveals that enhancement maxima and their trends vary with Au thickness. Therefore we calculate the enhancements for four different Au dimensions of (w, T) = (20, 100) nm, (60, 400) nm, (80, 400) nm, and (100, 400) nm as Au thickness varies from 50 to 200 nm. Fig. 2d shows that a different optimized Au thickness exists in every case. The enhancement takes the highest value of 30% for (w, T) = (20, 100) nm and 140 nm thickness.

(d) Ja enhancements for a few optimized values of w and T as h varies from 50 to 200 nm. Spectra of absorptance within hematite at different thicknesses of Au stripes under (e) TE and (f) TM polarized light incidence for the optimized lateral dimensions of (w, T) = (20, 100) nm. 
To further elucidate the effect of Au thickness, we investigate the absorption spectra of hematite under both TE and TM polarized light incidence for different thicknesses of (w, T) = (20, 100) nm of Au stripes. Fig. 2e shows that for TE illumination, the absorption spectra of hematite loaded with Au stripes acquire the same shape as the standard cell (without Au) does but the plasmonic enhanced cell has larger absorptance values over the entire wavelength range. The absorptance amplitude monotonically increases as Au thickness increases up to 140 nm whereas any further increase in Au thickness deteriorates the optical absorption in hematite. In addition, the optical absorptance of hematite for 60 nm thick Au stripes is significantly smaller than for other cases with thicker Au stripes.
Fig. 2f shows that under TM illumination, two peaks at 630 and 700 nm appear in the absorption spectra of the hematite loaded with Au stripes. These peaks are attributed to the surface plasmon resonances of Au stripes and their origin and modal profile are explained later in the text. At plasmon resonance, these resonance modes possess a strong near-field profile that strongly interacts with hematite and hence significantly improves the optical absorption in hematite. The absorptance amplitude of the peaks enhances with Au thickness. Above the plasma frequency of Au, the absorptance decreases when Au stripes are present because at these frequencies, Au functions as a lossy dielectric. The main conclusion of these findings is that Au stripes thinner than 100 nm lead to a dramatic decrease in the enhancements obtained under both TE and TM polarized light incidence.
Fig. 3 shows the profile of the electric field amplitude (top) and the profile of the electromagnetic energy absorption (Qe = (1/2ω)ε′′hematite|E(,λ)|2) in the device for TE and TM polarized light incidence at certain wavelengths. For TE polarized light, the profile at 550 nm shows that light passes through the Au stripes without being diffracted, however, its wave front is partially distorted. At the other wavelength, similar profiles are observed. In this case Au stripes function as a homogeneous layer with an effective permittivity determined by the permittivity values of Au and water.26 Increasing Au thickness basically leads to a reduced optical transmittance from this grating layer, hence increasing the reflectivity from the Au grating interface with water. However when Au thickness becomes too large, the reflectance from the top surface of Au grating is reduced due to large dissipation within this layer (Fig. 1f).
 Fig. 3  Profile of the electric field amplitude (top row) and dissipation loss or electromagnetic energy absorption (bottom row) within the plasmonically enhanced extremely thin layers of hematite. These parameters are normalized to the electric field amplitude and power of the incident wave. 
Under TM polarized light incidence at 400 nm, the amplitude of the electric field in hematite relative to the electric field amplitude of the incident wave is smaller than unity. This indicates that under these conditions, no field enhancement takes place in hematite. The reason is that at about plasma frequency, Au behaves like a dissipative dielectric because its real part of permittivity (ε′) is positive.27 As the result, the electric field of the TM wave interacting with an array of these stripes, as shown in Fig. 3, has most of its electric field distributed over the spacing between stripes and does not interact strongly with hematite. Above plasma frequency, surface plasmon resonances are not excited in the metal.
Below Au plasma frequency, localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) are excited in Au stripes. According to the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2f) under TM light incidence, two surface plasmon resonances are excited in the stripes at 630 and 700 nm. Profiles of normalized electric field and dissipation loss, depicted in Fig. 3, reveal that the stripes effectively concentrate light in their vicinity providing strong interaction with the hematite layer. The localized electric field enhancements reach maxima of 24- and 51-fold enhancements at 630 and 700 nm, respectively.
The wavelength of these surface plasmon resonances depends on the stripe geometry and its dielectric environment. A configuration, similar to ours, but with an insulating SiO2 layer between Au stripes and silicon has been used for thin film silicon solar cells.28 In that structure, observation of only one surface plasmon resonance is reported, however, it has been pointed out that reducing SiO2 thickness below 10 nm results in the build up of polarization charges in silicon that interact with the collective oscillation of electrons in Au. It is likely that a situation similar to the reported modal hybridization of Ag cubes near dielectric substrate occurs.29 Further investigation of the origin of these resonances requires in-depth electromagnetic wave formulations that lies out of the scope of this article.
To evaluate the enhancement under diffused light illumination, we calculate the overall enhancements as the incidence angle varies from 0 to 40° from normal incidence. Fig. 4a shows that with increasing the incidence angle, the performance is improved under TM polarized light incidence whereas it slightly decreases for TE polarized light. In general, the enhancements are slightly improved at larger incidence angles. This shows that Au stripes do not deteriorate angular acceptance of the thin hematite layer.
 Fig. 4  Variations in the Ja enhancements of the optimized (w, T, h) = (20, 100, 140) nm versus (a) incidence angle and (b) thickness of the SiO2 insulating layer at normal incidence. Evolution of absorptance profiles of (c) TE and (d) TM polarized incident light as the thickness of the SiO2 layer varies. 
An SiO2 layer is sometimes placed between Au and hematite to avoid charge recombination at the Au-hematite interface by insulating Au from hematite. Therefore we investigate the influence of an SiO2 insulating layer on the enhancement. Fig. 4b shows that enhancement is a decreasing function of SiO2 thickness. The influence of thickness is negligibly small for TE whereas it is significant for TM polarized light incidence. A 5 nm SiO2 layer decreases the optimized enhancement by 12%. In most solution-processing techniques, a minimum of 5 nm thickness is required to ensure complete coverage of Au, however, if a sophisticated method like atomic layer deposition is used, thinner SiO2 layers might be enough for insulation.
Under TE polarized light incidence, the SiO2 layer influences the hematite absorptance significantly below 400 nm whereas its influence on longer wavelengths is trivial (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, under TM polarized light incidence, the influence of the SiO2 layer is negligible in the UV region. However, it significantly influences the near-field enhanced peaks at 630 and 700 nm. As the SiO2 thickness increases, the peaks red-shift and their amplitudes significantly decrease. The amplitude of the absorption peak due to the asymmetric mode decreases dramatically with SiO2 thickness whereas this decrease is smaller for the symmetric mode. It can be attributed to the electric field profile of these modes because the asymmetric mode is highly localized while the symmetric mode is delocalized. Upon increasing the SiO2 thickness, the overlap of the highly localized asymmetric mode with hematite strongly decreases whereas the electric field profile of the delocalized symmetric mode still maintains a significant overlap with hematite. The red-shift in the peaks position is caused by the lower average refractive index of the surrounding medium of Au stripes, which occurs due to the presence of the low index SiO2 layer.
The effect of edge bluntness is studied by rounding the upper edges of Au stripes for the optimized (w, T, h) = (20, 100, 140) nm Au stripes. Variations of the bluntness up to completely turning the top rectangle into a dome do not markedly affect the overall performance. This shows that the enhancements reported are robust against artifacts of the fabrication process. The corresponding results are reported in Table S1, ESI.†
Conclusions
Design and optimization of rectangular Au stripes is carried out to enhance light absorption within extremely thin layers of hematite. The results highlight that the precise choice of the dimensions of the stripes is crucial to achieve enhancement in the overall performance of the cell under AM1.5 illumination. Our results reveal that enhancement is maximal at a certain thickness of Au stripes. Under TE polarized light incidence, the enhancement mechanism lies in the improved reflectance of Au grating by increasing the grating depth. The enhancement under TM waves is attributed to the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances that significantly enhance the absorption in the visible and near infrared. Since a significant part of the enhancement is caused by near-field enhancement, adding a 5 nm thick SiO2 insulating layer between hematite and Au stripes deteriorates the enhancement of the optimum design by 12%. Under ideal conditions, the Au stripes can provide 28% enhancement of the overall AM1.5 photocurrent.

Spectra of absorptance within hematite at different thicknesses of Au stripes under (e) TE and (f) TM polarized light incidence for the optimized lateral dimensions of (w, T) = (20, 100) nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Profile of the electric field amplitude (top row) and dissipation loss or electromagnetic energy absorption (bottom row) within the plasmonically enhanced extremely thin layers of hematite. These parameters are normalized to the electric field amplitude and power of the incident wave.	 

 	Fig. 4  Variations in the Ja enhancements of the optimized (w, T, h) = (20, 100, 140) nm versus (a) incidence angle and (b) thickness of the SiO2 insulating layer at normal incidence. Evolution of absorptance profiles of (c) TE and (d) TM polarized incident light as the thickness of the SiO2 layer varies.
