    , Accepted 20th April 2022First published on 20th April 2022AbstractManipulating the donor:acceptor (D:A) energetics, e.g., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offset, is the key to balancing the charge separation and charge recombination for high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we designed and synthesized a non-fullerene electron acceptor, i.e., BTP-H2, which shows strong intermolecular interaction and near-zero HOMO offset when pairing with polymer donor PM6. Transient absorption spectroscopies unveil that BTP-H2 exhibits a long-lived intra-moiety charge-separation state, which contributes to efficient hole transfer or charge generation, irrespective of the small HOMO offset. In addition, the small energetic offset reduces the non-radiative loss for a high open-circuit voltage (Voc). As a result, we demonstrate high-performance OSCs with the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5%, a high Voc of 0.932 V and a peak photon-to-electron response of ∼ 90%. Furthermore, ternary OSCs comprising PM6:BTP-H2:L8-BO exhibit a champion PCE of 19.2% (certified value of 18.8%) due to the improved balance between charge generation and charge recombination, and this represents the best among PCEs of single-junction OSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn extensive attention due to the features of flexibility, light weight, transparency and potential low cost. Recent progress in non-fullerene acceptors enables OSCs to experience breakthroughs constantly in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Though promising, the PCEs of OSCs are inferior compared to those of the inorganic counterparts, e.g., silicon photovoltaics (PCE 26.7%) and GaAs photovoltaics (PCE 29.1%). Hence, further breakthrough in device performance is the urgent priority. However, OSCs suffer from large voltage loss due to the non-radiative recombination; in this context, simultaneously achieving efficient charge separation and low voltage loss becomes the key to further PCE improvement. Herein, we designed and synthesized a non-fullerene electron acceptor, i.e., BTP-H2, which shows suppressed voltage loss and efficient charge separation when pairing with polymer donor PM6. The PM6:BTP-H2 based device demonstrates a high efficiency of 18.5% with a high Voc of 0.932 V. BTP-H2 also enables the ternary device to yield a champion efficiency of 19.2%, ranking the highest among those of single-junction OSCs so far.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantages of light weight, good flexibility, potential low-cost production, variable light absorption for visible transparency, diverse colors, etc., and are regarded as a promising renewable energy harvesting technology.1,2 Recently, the rapid progress in OSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to ∼ 19%,3 shedding light on their future commercialization. The ongoing PCE breakthroughs mainly benefit from material evolutions, particularly the invention of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).4–7 Joint efforts on device optimization including morphology control, interface engineering, and device architecture design also equally contributed to the rapid progress in PCE, where the tandem structure and ternary strategy are particularly prominent.8–17
Nevertheless, the efficiency of OSCs lags behind those of their inorganic counterparts, and developing high-performance OSCs is still one of the key issues to resolve. In this context, simultaneously achieving efficient charge separation and low voltage loss becomes an urgent priority for further PCE improvement, and the donor:acceptor (D:A) interfacial energetics plays an important role in the above processes.18,19 Generally, it is observed that a small energetic offset favors high open-circuit voltage (Voc), while the larger one can better facilitate the charge separation. For example, Gao et al. identified lowering the energy offset between the donor and acceptor molecular states as one of the rules to minimize the voltage losses.20 Nelson et al. further unveiled that low energy offsets can result in hybridization between charge-transfer and lowest donor or acceptor exciton states, and this leads to a strong suppression in the non-radiative voltage loss.21
The energetic offset has long been regarded as the driving force for charge transfer (or exciton dissociation), but this conclusion is currently challenged by the recent development of NFAs, where charge transfer occurs even under negligible energetic offset. For example, in our previous work,22 the NFA-based OSCs maintaining efficient hole transfer when operating at the near-zero highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy offset have been demonstrated, and this has also been confirmed by a variety of systems, including the current Y-series acceptors.18,23–25 Unveiling the working mechanism is a hot topic in the community of OSCs. In Y6-based devices, it is revealed that long exciton lifetimes,18 large quadrupole moments,25 distinctive molecular packing and well-organized morphology26 could afford efficient charge separation under small energetic offsets. Furthermore, the hole transfer process has been generally observed to be mediated by long-lived excited state species, e.g., intra-moiety excited state (i-EX),27,28 which serves as the intermediate to enable efficient hole transfer at low energy cost. However, the formation of the i-EX state is expected to highly rely on the intermolecular interactions.27
Hence, modulating the energy offset and intermolecular interaction is feasible to simultaneously achieve efficient charge separation and low voltage loss for high-performance OSCs. A variety of strategies have been proposed to tune the energy levels of NFAs, including modulating the core conjugation,29,30 introducing electron withdrawing/donating side-chains,31,32 and adjusting the number or species of halogen atoms on the terminals.3,23,33 Particularly, tuning the terminal group halogen has also been demonstrated as an effective way to adjust the packing behavior of the NFA, which provides a rational way to simultaneously manipulate the D:A interfacial energetics and the molecular packing.16,23,34,35
Taking the above understanding into consideration, in this work, based on the state-of-the-art L8-BO NFA,36 a newly designed electron acceptor, BTP-H2, has been synthesized by substituting the double-fluoro groups with mono-bromo groups for fine-tuned energy levels. This design dramatically up-shifts the HOMO level to ∼−5.5 eV and induces stronger molecular packing. However, BTP-H2 is found to exhibit very efficient charge separation, regardless of the near-zero HOMO offset when pairing with polymer donor PM6. This can be attributed to the formation of long-lived intra-moiety charge transfer states induced by the strong intermolecular packing of BTP-H2, as unveiled by transient absorption spectroscopies and the grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. However, the low HOMO offset of PM6:BTP-H2 dramatically increases the Voc. Therefore, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP-H2 deliver a high Voc of 0.932 V (or a reduced energy loss from 0.563 eV to 0.534 eV, compared to PM6:L8-BO) and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 90%. The corresponding device exhibits a high efficiency of 18.5%, which stands as the only system realizing over 18% PCE with a high Voc over 0.9 V. Furthermore, by incorporating BTP-H2 into the PM6:L8-BO blend, efficient charge generation is achieved, as well as reduced Voc loss. As a result, a champion PCE of 19.2% (certified value of 18.8%) has been demonstrated, representing the best among those of single-junction OSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the electron acceptors, i.e., L8-BO, the newly designed BTP-H2, and the polymer donor (PM6) are displayed in Fig. 1a. The synthetic route of BTP-H2 is depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The mono-bromo-substituted 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (Br–INCN) is used as the electron withdrawing terminal, attached to the central core through Knoevenagel condensation. Acceptors with mono-fluoro/chloro terminals, namely L8-BO–F and L8-BO–Cl, were also synthesized for comparison. Detailed structure characterization including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and mass spectra (MALDI-TOF-MS) is presented in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†). The optical properties of the two acceptors were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1b and Fig. S7, Table S1, ESI†). BTP-H2 and L8-BO exhibit similar maximal peaks located at 735 nm and 732 nm in their respective chloroform solutions. When solidified into thin films, the maximal peaks are red-shifted by 70 nm for both BTP-H2 and L8-BO. Particularly, the BTP-H2 film shows a steeper absorption edge than the L8-BO film, suggesting more ordered molecular packing in the solid-state.37,38 Cyclic voltammetry was conducted to measure the energy levels of the thin films and the related results are displayed in Fig. 1c and Fig. S8, Table S2 (ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO levels were determined to be −3.90 eV and −5.63 eV for L8-BO, and −3.88 eV and −5.54 eV for BTP-H2. Thus, both the LUMO and HOMO levels of BTP-H2 upshift slightly compared with those of L8-BO. Particularly, the HOMO offset (HOMOPM6 − HOMONFA) between PM6 and BTP-H2 is as low as 40 meV. As previously reported, narrowing the HOMO offsets (even to near zero) between the donor and acceptor is an effective way to reduce non-radiative voltage loss.21

A conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D:A blend/Bis-FIMG39/Ag was applied to investigate their photovoltaic properties. Detailed device fabrication and characterization procedures are provided in the ESI,† Table S3. The J–V curves of the optimal OSCs are shown in Fig. 2a, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2b shows the PCE statistics of 20 cells for each D:A blend. The averaged device performances show a similar trend to the champion ones. All of the three blends show very narrow distribution, suggesting the good reproducibility of our devices. The PM6:L8-BO based champion device delivers a PCE of 18.5%, with a Voc of 0.877 V, a Jsc of 26.32 mA cm−2, and a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 80.3%. These results are consistent with the literature reports.36,40 However for the PM6:BTP-H2 blends, an outstanding Voc of 0.932 V is obtained, accompanied by a Jsc of 25.33 mA cm−2, and an FF of 78.5%, and these lead to a champion high PCE of 18.5%, which is comparable to that of PM6:L8-BO OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only system delivering over 18% PCE with Voc surpassing 0.9 V, as shown in Fig. 2c. Besides, PM6:L8-BO–F and PM6:L8-BO–Cl based devices deliver a PCE of 17.2% and 17.7%, respectively (Fig. S9 and Table S4, ESI†), suggesting that bromo is the best choice for high-performing device in this case. In order to combine their respective advantages of PM6:BTP-H2 OSCs’ high Voc and PM6:L8-BO OSCs’ high photo-current density, ternary devices were fabricated by incorporating 25 wt% BTP-H2 into the PM6:L8-BO blend. This leads to an improved balance between the Jsc and Voc, (26.68 mA cm−2 and 0.892 V), while the FF values retain over 80%, as similar to that of PM6:L8-BO. As a result, the best PCE of 19.2% (18.8% certified by the Chinese National Photovoltaic Industry Metrology and Testing Center (NPVM)) is reached, and this represents the best result among those of single-junction OSCs, as presented in Fig. 2c. Importantly, the 18.8% certified efficiency represents the highest among those of single-junction OSCs with certification.

The corresponding EQE curves of the optimized devices are displayed in Fig. 2d. The integrated Jcal values from the EQE curves are 25.97 mA cm−2, 25.05 mA cm−2, and 26.31 mA cm−2 for OSCs based on PM6:L8-BO, PM6:BTP-H2, and PM6:L8-BO:BTP-H2, respectively, close to those derived from the J–V curves. Notably, the EQE peak of PM6:BTP-H2 can also reach around 90%, even though the energetic offset is very small. The PM6:L8-BO devices exhibit a higher EQE response in the range of 600–700 nm while PM6:BTP-H2 devices exhibit a higher EQE response in the range of 430–550 nm. The ternary system combines the advantages of both devices, thus achieving the highest Jcal, which suggests that the ternary device exhibits more efficient photon-to-electron conversion.
To gain insight into the photon-to-electron process, the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities of the devices under illumination and in the dark, respectively.) and effective voltage (Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied voltage bias.) of the devices was studied to investigate the bias-dependent charge separation and collection behavior (Fig. 2e).41 The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) and charge collection efficiency (Pcoll) could be calculated from the Jph/Jsat values under short circuit and maximal power output conditions, respectively, where Jsat refers to the saturation current at a high Veff. As shown in Fig. 2e, the ternary system possesses the highest Pdiss and Pcoll values (98.79% and 91.12%), which are higher than the binary systems, indicating that the introduction of BTP-H2 contributes to both the exciton dissociation and charge collection.
Furthermore, the charge recombination behavior was then investigated using light intensity (Plight) dependent Jsc and Voc. Through the relationship between Voc and Plight, i.e., Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight) (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge. Larger n value means more component of monomolecular recombination.), charge recombination behavior can be identified. Besides, the correlation between Jsc and Plight, i.e., Jsc ∝ Plightα (the closer α value is to 1, the less component of bimolecular recombination exists) describes the charge extraction capability.42 As shown in Fig. 2f, from the n values (1.10 for PM6:L8-BO, 1.05 for PM6:BTP-H2, and 1.01 for PM6:L8-BO:BTP-H2) derived from the Plight dependent Voc, it is suggested that the BTP-H2 can suppress the monomolecular recombination in OSCs, and the ternary blend exhibits the lowest monomolecular recombination, due to the dilution effect as proposed in our previous work.8 Also, the α values of current density versus Plight (0.97 for PM6:L8-BO and 1.00 for both PM6:BTP-H2 and PM6:L8-BO:BTP-H2) indicate that the BTP-H2 can facilitate the charge extraction. Therefore, it is concluded that the BTP-H2 can suppress the trap-mediated monomolecular charge recombination and improve the charge extraction, and this contributes to the high Voc and Jsc in the ternary device.43
Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were conducted to study the exciton lifetimes (Fig. S10, ESI†), and the results show small differences (0.83 ns, 0.77 ns and 0.82 ns for L8-BO, BTP-H2 and the mixed film, respectively). To further investigate the charge generation process and resolve the puzzle of high charge generation under a small energetic offset, we carried out transient absorption (TA) measurements. Basic information regarding the attribution of each absorption feature is present in the ESI.† The excitation wavelength at around 800 nm was used here to selectively excite the acceptors in the D:A blends, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S11–S16 (ESI†). Fig. 3a–c show the photo-induced bleaching (PB) of PM6:L8-BO,

PM6:BTP-H2, and the ternary blend, respectively, and Fig. 3d shows the excited state absorption spectra of acceptors in the ternary blend (Fig. 3h provides profiles at different delay times). After excitation, the signal located at ≈ 630 nm PB signal of PM6 arises, following the NFA (either BTP-H2 or L8-BO) PB signal located at ≈810 nm, as shown in Fig. 3e–g. This is a clear sign of the hole transfer from acceptors to polymer donor PM6. By comparing the PB signal at 630 nm, hole transfer dynamics is traced for three different blends, i.e., the PM6:L8-BO, PM6:BTP-H2, and the ternary blend (Fig. 3i). Details on the interpretation of the TA spectroscopy feature can be found in previous studies.27,44 By fitting it to a biexponential function, the charge transfer lifetimes are derived to be τ1 = 0.08 ± 0.01 ps and τ2 = 8.71 ± 0.87 ps in PM6:L8-BO; τ1 = 0.05 ± 0.01 ps and τ2 = 14.8 ± 1.48 ps in PM6:BTP-H2; and τ1= 0.07 ± 0.01 ps and τ2 = 9.70 ± 0.97 ps in the ternary blend, respectively. The fast component τ1 is commonly assigned to the dissociation of the acceptor exciton formed at the D:A interface, while the second component τ2 is attributed to diffusion-limited dissociation of bulk excitons. It is interesting to observe that the PM6:BPT-H2 exhibits faster hole transfer compared to PM6:L8-BO, even though its HOMO offset is smaller. Besides, PM6:BTP-H2 presents a larger proportion of the exciton diffusion mediated transfer process and a longer τ2 ∼15 ps. However, for the ternary blend, the hole transfer lies in between the two systems. These results suggest that BTP-H2 shows little negative effect on charge separation, but dramatically facilitates the charge transfer at the D:A interface, irrespective of the near-zero HOMO offset.
Previous work has shown that a long-lived excited state forms in NFAs, which might serve as an important intermediate during the charge transfer.27 This long-lived excited species, which is termed as i-EX in previous work, has also been observed in both L8-BO and BTP-H2, as shown in Fig. S12 and S13 (ESI†). The excited-state absorption feature at 900 nm and 1550 nm can be attributed to the generation process of i-EX from photoexcited LE states due to the intermolecular interaction in neat acceptor domains. It is interesting to observe that the kinetics of the BTP-H2 probed at 1550 nm exhibit a longer i-EX lifetime (216.6 ps) compared to that of the L8-BO (163.0 ps) as shown in Fig. 3k and Fig. S16 (ESI†), and lifetimes of both were shortened to ∼ 9.0 ps when blended with PM6 (Fig. 3l and Fig. S16, ESI†). The longer i-EX lifetime of BTP-H2 also explains the retarded peak positions in the kinetics of PB at 630 nm in PM6:BTP-H2 films. Besides, the faster charge transfer at the PM6:BTP-H2 interface might also be associated with the long-lived i-EX, which might be more weakly bounded compared to that of L8-BO. If we consider that the i-EX lifetime shortening has been solely contributed by hole transfer, the hole transfer efficiency can be extracted to be 92.4% and 96.0% for PM6:L8-BO and PM6:BTP-H2 systems, respectively (Fig. S16, ESI†). Hence, it is suggested that the longer i-EX lifetime in BTP-H2 based thin films might contribute to the high charge separation efficiency despite the small energetic offset.
Furthermore, the effect of BPT-H2 on the energy loss of OSCs was studied, and detailed calculations and classifications are shown in the diagram in Fig. 4a and the ESI.†45 The energy bandgap (Eg) has been calculated via the derivatives of the EQE spectrum (Fig. 4e and Fig. S17, ESI†).46 The Egs values of PM6:L8-BO, PM6:BTP-H2 and PM6:L8-BO:BTP-H2 blends were determined to be 1.440 eV, 1.466 eV, and 1.450 eV, respectively. Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) and electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) experiments were performed for energy loss analysis (Fig. 4b–d, f and ESI†), and the detailed energy loss data are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2g. There is no big difference in the inevitable energy loss (ΔE1). The PM6:BTP-H2 OSC exhibits the lowest non-ideal radiative decay value (ΔE2), which could be ascribed to its steep bandtail, as consistent with the absorption spectra of both the pristine and blend films. Among the three devices, the PM6:BTP-H2 device delivers the lowest total energy loss of 0.534 eV. Compared to the control PM6:L8-BO device, the ternary device appears to have lower energy loss (0.558 eV vs. 0.563 eV), and this has mainly originated from the decreased non-radiative decay loss (ΔE3) (0.209 eV vs. 0.195 eV), which could be calculated from the EQEEL curves (Fig. 4f and ESI†). It can be inferred that the introduction of BTP-H2 could help in suppressing the non-radiative decay in the controlled device. Interestingly, the ternary device exhibits the brightest luminescence, which could be ascribed to the dilution effect in a multiple-component system as proposed in our previous work.8

To investigate the top surface morphology, we first performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Fig. 5a and Fig. S18, ESI†). For the two binary system, PM6:L8-BO presents smaller domain sizes and a smoother surface (RMS of 0.82 vs. 1.08), while the PM6:BTP-H2 system delivers larger domain sizes (Fig. S18, ESI†). The ternary system exhibits in-between situation with delicate surface morphology and an RMS of 0.92. This suggests that the introduction of BTP-H2 could fine-tune the phase domain sizes to improve the charge recombination properties, which is consistent with suppressed charge recombination in the ternary system mentioned above. GIWAXS characterization was further carried out to study the morphological factor (Fig. 5 and Fig. S19, ESI†), which is intimately related to the carrier dynamic processes in OSCs.47 For the pristine L8-BO and BTP-H2 films, strong signal peaks at qr = ∼0.410 Å−1 (d = ∼15.3 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction and at qz = ∼1.68 Å−1 (d = ∼3.74 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction could be observed, indicating a dominant face-on orientated molecular stacking in both films. Detailed parameters of peak intensity profiles along with IP/OOP directions are summarized in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). Notably, from the coherence length (CL) values of the π–π stacking in the OOP direction of L8-BO and BTP-H2 (16.1 Å vs. 23.6 Å), we observe that BTP-H2 shows higher crystallinity or stronger intermolecular interaction (there is a strong contrast in Fig. S19, ESI†), and this is consistent with the observation in absorption profiles and the larger domain sizes in AFM results. Previous work demonstrated that the i-EX feature is observed in the film sample but not the solution sample, implying that the molecular packing is essential for the intermediate i-EX state.27 Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations unveil that Y-series molecules in the film tend to form 3D net-working stackings, or good intermolecular interactions,26,36 which account for the formation of i-EX states with loosely bonded exciton features for facile charge separation under a low driving force.27 Hence, higher crystallinity or stronger intermolecular interaction of BTP-H2 could contribute to the longer duration of the i-EX state mentioned above. After blending with PM6, the differences in the IP direction become negligible, while the differences in the OOP direction remain in blends. The PM6:BTP-H2 blend possesses larger CL values compared with PM6:L8-BO. However, the ternary blend also shows CL increment after introducing BTP-H2. Such results indicate that the presence of BTP-H2 induces a higher degree of molecular packing, and thus benefits both the charge transfer and charge transport. These findings help in explaining the long-lived excited state species of BTP-H2 and the distinguished Jsc and FF achieved in the ternary device.

Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new NFA, namely BTP-H2, with up-shifted energy levels and stronger crystallinity compared with the widely studied L8-BO molecule. After pairing with PM6, the OSCs exhibit the best PCE of 18.5%, which is comparable to that of L8-BO, but show great advantages in Voc. It is worth noting that the outstanding performance and high charge generation are achieved at a near-zero HOMO offset, and this can possibly be attributed to the longer i-EX state duration of BTP-H2 as a result of the strong intermolecular packing. Furthermore, a ternary device was prepared by incorporating BTP-H2 into the PM6:L8-BO blend, which effectively modulates the interplay between charge generation and charge recombination. The resulting ternary device exhibits a record PCE of 19.2% and a certified efficiency of 18.8%, which represents the best among those of single-junction OSCs so far.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn extensive attention due to the features of flexibility, light weight, transparency and potential low cost. Recent progress in non-fullerene acceptors enables OSCs to experience breakthroughs constantly in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Though promising, the PCEs of OSCs are inferior compared to those of the inorganic counterparts, e.g., silicon photovoltaics (PCE 26.7%) and GaAs photovoltaics (PCE 29.1%). Hence, further breakthrough in device performance is the urgent priority. However, OSCs suffer from large voltage loss due to the non-radiative recombination; in this context, simultaneously achieving efficient charge separation and low voltage loss becomes the key to further PCE improvement. Herein, we designed and synthesized a non-fullerene electron acceptor, i.e., BTP-H2, which shows suppressed voltage loss and efficient charge separation when pairing with polymer donor PM6. The PM6:BTP-H2 based device demonstrates a high efficiency of 18.5% with a high Voc of 0.932 V. BTP-H2 also enables the ternary device to yield a champion efficiency of 19.2%, ranking the highest among those of single-junction OSCs so far.
