    , Accepted 9th April 2020First published on 9th April 2020AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) mono-elemental materials from group IV–VI have aroused great interest in the scientific community on account of their intriguing optoelectronic properties. Integration of elements from the same group into binary hetero-structures is of great significance for their diversified properties and potential multifunctional applications. In this contribution, a 2D selenium (Se, VI) coated tellurium (Te, VI) nanosheet (NS) binary heterostructure (Te@Se) is constructed and demonstrated as a promising material for a photodetector (PD) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type photodetection system. The experiments confirm that the Te@Se-based PD exhibits pH-sensitivity in a wide pH range from 1 to 14 with many other advantages such as self-powered, repeatable fast dynamic pH response, and long-term stability over 30 days. Theoretical calculations are performed to understand the mechanism of the pH-sensitive optoelectronic effects in 2D Te@Se in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is anticipated that the presented work expands a new concept for the applications of 2D binary heterostructure-based multifunctional devices, combining photo-detection and pH sensing.
Introduction
The breakthrough discoveries of two-dimensional (2D) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN),1 graphene,2 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),3,4 and a series of mono-elemental 2D materials,5–7 have aroused enormous interest of researchers all over the world. Among them, mono-elemental materials from group IV–VI have become promising materials for various applications owing to their outstanding electronic and photonic properties.8–10 Graphene, the most studied mono-elemental material from group IV, has an extremely high carrier mobility (∼105 cm2 V−1 s−1), but the no band gap nature has greatly limited its applications.11–14 Black phosphorus (BP), a star mono-elemental material from group V, has been widely investigated for bio-medicine,15,16 energy storage,17,18 electronics,19–21 and optoelectronic devices22,23 thanks to its tunable bandgap (0.3–2.0 eV), high hole mobility (∼103 cm2 V−1s−1), and anisotropic characteristics. However, the intrinsic easily-oxidized property of BP has greatly limited its wide practical applications.24,25 As a typical representative of group VI, tellurium (Te) has similar properties to BP, such as a layered folded structure, tunable bandgap (0.35–1.05 eV),26 and high carrier mobility (∼103 cm2 V−1s−1),27 with, however, better environmental stability than BP,28 arising as a promising candidate to replace BP in many fields. Te has a strong tendency to grow into a one-dimensional (1D) nanoarchitecture due to its chain-like structure and the inherent structural anisotropy.29,30 A wealth of previous studies have reported the formation of 1D Te nanomaterials like Te nanotubes (NTs) and nanowires (NWs), while there are fewer for 2D Te and its related properties.31–35 The reliable preparation of 2D Te is of great significance for developing new technologies based on this layered chalcogen, and which has become the urgent challenge of frontier focuses. For example, He et al. synthesized hexagonal Te nanoplates (NPs) through the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy method on flexible mica sheets.36 The Te NP-based photodetector (PD) shows great potential in flexible and wearable optoelectronic devices with a high photo-response after bending 100 times. In 2018, Te nanoflakes (NFs) were prepared via the hydrothermal reduction of sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3) by Ye et al.30 The Te NF-based transistor exhibits a high ON/OFF ratio with an order of 106 and a high carrier mobility of about 700 cm2 V−1s−1. Immediately afterwards, Javey et al. demonstrated that Te NFs can be used as short-wave infrared (SWIR) PDs, and the carrier mobility can be further increased to 1430 cm2 V−1s−1 at 77 K.27 Our group prepared Te nanosheets (NSs) through the liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) method, and the obtained Te NSs possess a lateral dimension ranging from 41.5 to 177.5 nm with a thickness ranging from 5.1 to 6.4 nm, which exhibit good photo-response behaviors from the ultraviolet (UV) to the visible regime in a photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type photodetection system.37 Well synthesized 2D Te offers the base to build 2D Te-based heterostructures, which in turn introduce diversified properties for potentially multifunctional device applications beyond photodetection.
2D heterostructures, which are composed of two or more components, usually possess the advantages of each individual building block and also generate extra novel physical properties that provide opportunities to overcome the limitations of mono-component materials, thereby meeting the demands of fabricating high-performance multifunctional optoelectronic devices.38–40 In particular, binary hetero-structures constructed from mono-elemental materials from the same group, such as IV–IV and V–V heterostructures, are extremely interesting due to their exceptional properties.41–43 For example, a 2D graphene/n-type silicon heterostructure (graphene/n-Si) was prepared and applied for photodetection by Fang et al.44 The graphene/n-Si-based PD shows a specific detectivity of 5.77 × 1013 Jones, a high responsivity of 0.73 A W−1, and a high ON/OFF ratio up to 107 at 890 nm in a vacuum. Zeng et al. reported 2D black arsenic/phosphorus (α-AsP) heterostructures.19 α-AsP shows a direct band gap of 1.54 eV and a high electron mobility of 14380 cm2 V−1 s−1. More importantly, the maximum power conversion efficiency of α-AsP-based excitonic solar cells (XSCs) can reach up to 22.1%. Nevertheless, at present, studies on 2D VI–VI iso-group heterostructures are rare, and the most adopted strategies for preparing heterostructures are usually based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD),45–47 physical vapor deposition (PVD),48,49 and the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) methods,50–52 which suffer from high fabrication costs, strict preparation conditions, and the risk of forming undesired byproducts. Therefore, it is desired to explore cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods, like the solvothermal method, to prepare 2D VI–VI heterostructures for device applications with enhanced performance.53,54
In this work, we aim to prepare 2D selenium (Se) coated Te binary heterostructures (Te@Se) through the solvothermal method. It is found that the Te@Se-based PD shows excellent photo-response behaviors in a PEC-type photodetection system, which shows a high photocurrent (Pph) of 19.64 μA cm−2, a high responsivity (Rph) of 432.72 μA W−1, and a specific detectivity (D*) up to 4.82 × 108 Jones. Furthermore, systematic studies reveal that the measured Pph is very sensitive to the pH value of the applied electrolyte in a wide range from 1 to 14. The Te@Se-based PD exhibits a special self-powered pH detection capability due to the emerging built-in electronic field generated at the interface. Moreover, the investigations display the excellent repeatable dynamic pH detection, fast pH response (about 1.5 s), and pronounced long-term stability (over 30 days) of such a prepared pH-sensitive PD. The pH-sensitive photo-response behaviors of Te@Se are further demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We believe that the present work not only provides new ideas for the development of VI–VI heterostructures, but also suggests novel applications of PDs based on 2D materials.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the morphology characterization of Te@Se, and the details of the preparation process can be found in the Experimental section (ESI†). Fig. 1a shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of Te NSs with the surface area over 3 × 5 μm. The atomic force microscope (AFM) image (Fig. 1b) shows that the thickness of Te NSs is about 25 ± 3 nm. Fig. 1c shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of a single Te NS with a clean surface. The lattice spacing of the Te NS is calculated to be 0.19 nm, which can be assigned to the (200) plane of Te (PDF #36-1452),55,56 and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern reveals the good crystallinity of the prepared Te NSs as shown in the high-resolution TEM image (HR-TEM, Fig. 1d). Fig. 1e shows the TEM image of the synthesized Te@Se. It can be seen that Te@Se shows a smaller size than the pristine Te NSs, which can be attributed to the breakage of Te NSs during the preparation process. The AFM image (Fig. 1f) shows that Te@Se is about 8 nm thicker than the pristine Te NSs, which is consistent with the HR-TEM images as depicted in Fig. 1g and h. The lattice spacing in Fig. 1h is identified to be 0.21 nm, which is consistent with the (102) plane of Se (PDF #06-0362), and the inserted SAED pattern further demonstrates the existence of Se.57Fig. 1i shows the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM image of Te@Se, and the relative energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results obtained from Area #1 are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that only Te and Se can be detected, suggesting the successful preparation of Te@Se. The element mapping was carried out to better understand the structure composition. It can be clearly seen that Te@Se exhibits a typical coated structure with inner Te and outer Se as shown in Fig. 1j–l.

A UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum was measured to study the optical absorption of Te@Se (Fig. 2a). It can be seen that Te@Se exhibits broadband optical absorption from 300 to 800 nm, and almost no obvious change can be found after 2 weeks. Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the optical absorption of pristine Te and bulk Se. The optical absorption of Te@Se is significantly improved compared to the pristine Te NSs, which can be attributed to the extra optical absorption of the coated Se layer.28,58 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) was carried out to further examine the crystal structure of Te NSs and Te@Se (Fig. 2b). Typical characteristic diffraction peaks of [100], [101], and [110] can be detected and assigned for the pristine Te NSs (PDF #36-1452), while additional peaks of [100], [101], and [102] can be found and attributed to the outer Se (PDF #06-0362) of Te@Se. Fig. S2b (ESI†) shows the XRD pattern of fresh Te@Se and after 2 weeks, and no new peaks can be detected in the XRD pattern, indicating the good stability of Te@Se. Fig. 2c presents the Raman spectra of pristine Te NSs and Te@Se. Three vibrational modes at 92.58, 120.02, and 140.82 cm−1 can be detected in the pristine Te NSs, which can be assigned to the A1 and E2 peaks of Te, respectively.30,59 For Te@Se, an additional peak located at 232.59 cm−1 can be observed and attributed to the E2 mode of Se.60 In addition, the elementary composition of Te@Se was characterized through high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 2d–f). The regions of Se 3d and Te 3d are fitted and shown in Fig. 2d and e. Only one peak with the binding energy located at 55.1 eV in Fig. 2e can be detected and assigned to Se (3d5/2). Two strong peaks with the binding energies located at 572.9 and 583.3 eV can be observed and assigned to Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2, respectively. The other two peaks located at 576.1 and 586.4 eV can be assigned to oxidized Te (TeO2), revealing the presence of a small amount of oxygen contamination.61

The photo-response behaviors of Te@Se were studied by depositing Te@Se on ITO-coated glass as the working electrode in a PEC-type photodetection system (ESI,† Experimental section). The light power densities (Pλ) of different wavelengths used in this work are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of the Te@Se-based PD with bias potential from 0 to 1 V in the dark and under simulated light (SL) at level IV, respectively. The current shows an increasing trend with the gradually increasing bias potential, and the enhanced current at level IV can be explained by the extra current generated by the photoelectric conversion of Te@Se. No obvious redox peaks can be observed, indicating that Te@Se can remain stable under the bias potential from 0 to 0.6 V applied in this work. As is well known, the photocurrent (Pph), photoresponsivity (Rph), and detectivity (D*) (Jones or cm Hz1/2 W−1) are the three mainly adopted parameters to evaluate the performance of PEC-type PDs, which can be calculated according to the equations below:62,63 Pph = (Ilight − Idark)/S(1) Rph = Pph/Pλ(2) D* = Rph × S1/2/(2q × Idark)1/2(3)where Ilight and Idark are the current of the PDs with and without light; S is the effective area of Te@Se on the ITO glass; and q is equal to the electron charge constant of 1.60 × 10−19 C. Fig. 3b shows the photo-response behaviors of the PDs in different electrolytes with a pH of 1 (HCl), 7 (KCl), and 14 (KOH) under 0 and 0.6 V, respectively. The detailed values of Pph, Rph, and D* are calculated and listed in Table 1. It can be seen that typical ON/OFF signals can be detected, and Pph shows an increasing trend with the continuously increasing Pλ in each case, suggesting the excellent photo-response behaviors of Te@Se-based PDs. Taking PD in KOH electrolyte (pH 14) with a bias potential of 0 V as an example, Pph gradually increased from 4.97 μA cm−2 (level I) to 7.16 μA cm−2 (level II) and further increased to 10.1 μA cm−2 (level V), revealing that the Te@Se-based PD possesses a special self-powered capability. Additionally, it is worth noting that Pph shows an increasing trend with the increase of the pH value. For example, Pph obtained at level IV under 0.6 V increased from 3.31 μA cm−2 (pH = 1) to 9.68 μA cm−2 (pH = 7), and further increased to 19.31 μA cm−2 (pH = 14).

Fig. 3c and d show the curves of Pph and Rph as functions of Pλ in different pH electrolytes. Pph shows an increasing trend with the continuously increasing Pλ in all cases. For example, Pph increased from 11.29 μA cm−2 (level I) to 14.8 μA cm−2 (level II), 19.01 μA cm−2 (level III) and 19.31 μA cm−2 (level IV), and further increased to the highest value 20.08 μA cm−2 (level V) at a pH of 14, which is about 147 and 15 times higher than that of the previously reported pristine Te and Se NS-based PEC-type PDs.37,64 Nevertheless, Rph shows a decreasing trend with the continuously increasing Pλ as can be seen from Fig. 3d. The highest Rph is calculated to be 423.72 μA W−1 (level I), and then Rph decreased to 284.62 μA W−1 (level II), 228.76 μA W−1 (level III), 166.44 μA W−1 (level IV), and 164.59 μA W−1 (level V) at a pH of 14, revealing that the Te@Se-based PDs have more potential in electrolytes with higher pH values for a lower Pλ regime. Compared to the previously reported mono-element-based PEC-type photodetectors, including BP,65 Sb,66 Bi,67 Se,64 and Te,37 as shown in Table 2, the 2D Te@Se-based PD shows higher Pph and Rph. Moreover, the values of D* were calculated to further evaluate the Te@Se-based PDs according to eqn (3). An order of magnitude of 108 can be obtained with a potential of 0.6 V, suggesting weak dark current generated during the experiments. The highest D* is calculated to be 4.82 × 108, which outperforms pristine Te and Se-based PEC-type PDs,37,64 demonstrating the better performance of Te@Se.

As discussed above, the Te@Se-based PDs show increased Pph (level IV) with the increased pH value of the applied electrolytes. We further investigate the photo-response behaviors of the Te@Se-based PDs in different pH electrolytes ranging from 1 to 14 to further elucidate the relationship between Pph and pH as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the detailed area of the ON/OFF signals intercepted from level IV of Fig. 4a, and the values of each Pph calculated at level IV are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It can be seen that Pph shows an increasing trend with the gradually increasing pH values in each case. For example, the Pph values are calculated to be 3.31 ± 0.21 μA cm−2 (pH = 1), 5.05 ± 0.11 μA cm−2 (pH = 4), 12.81 ± 0.30 μA cm−2 (pH = 8), and 17.63 ± 0.29 μA cm−2 (pH = 11), revealing obvious changes in Pph as the pH value increased. To quantitatively evaluate whether the pH-sensitive change in Pph could be applied for pH sensing, the values of Pph measured in different pH electrolytes were compared and are plotted as a function of pH in Fig. 4b. Interestingly, the plot of pH versus Pph became almost linear in the pH range from 1 to 14.

(a and b) The photo-response behaviors in different pH electrolytes ranging from 1 to 14 under SL and the corresponding fitted curve. (c and d) The photo-response behaviors in different pH electrolytes ranging from 1 to 14 under 475 nm and the corresponding fitted curve. 
To better evaluate the pH-sensitive capability of the Te@Se-based PDs, the photo-response behaviors of the PDs at different illumination wavelengths (350 nm, 400 nm, 475 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm) were studied under 0.6 V in different pH electrolytes ranging from 1 to 14 as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The values of Pph under level IV are calculated and are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It can be found that all the Pph values calculated under different wavelengths gradually increase with increasing pH value from 1 to 14, which shows the same trend as Pph obtained under SL. The collection of the photo-response behaviors of the PDs under 475 nm is shown in Fig. 4c to better understand the relationship between Pph and pH under different illumination wavelength. Pph is calculated to be 0.16 ± 0.022 μA cm−2 (pH = 1), then increases to 1.17 ± 0.030 μA cm−2 (pH = 7), and further increases to 2.61 ± 0.028 μA cm−2 (pH = 13). The characteristic curves of Pphversus pH are fitted and depicted in Fig. 4d, which exhibits a similar linear tendency. To further verify the pH detection of the Te@Se-based PD, the relationships between Pph and pH under 400 and 550 nm were studied. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), Pph shows the same linear trend as that under 475 nm in each case. Such relationships of Pphversus pH indicate that the Te@Se-based PD possesses great potential for pH detection under both SL and selected illumination wavelengths.
Previously reported work has demonstrated that heterostructure-based PDs possess self-powered photodetection capability owing to the built-in electric field generated at the interface of each building block.68,69 Self-powered PDs can operate under an ambient environment by directly absorbing and converting sunlight, which can not only reduce the consumption of energy, but also simplify the design of the external circuit. As discussed above, Te@Se-based PDs exhibit excellent self-powered photodetection in electrolytes with different pH values. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore the self-powered pH-sensitive capability of Te@Se-based PDs. Fig. 5a shows the self-powered photo-response behaviors of the PDs in different pH electrolytes with a bias potential of 0 V. Typical ON/OFF signals can be observed, indicating the excellent self-powered photodetection capability of Te@Se-based PDs. The details of the Pph calculated at level IV in each case are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It is worth noting that Pph shows an increasing trend with the continuously increasing pH of the applied electrolyte, which is consistent with the results under 0.6 V above. For example, Pph is calculated to be 2.15 ± 0.12 μA cm−2 (pH = 1), 2.63 ± 0.18 μA cm−2 (pH = 3), 4.71 ± 0.12 μA cm−2 (pH = 6), 7.91 ± 0.22 μA cm−2 (pH = 9), and 9.69 ± 0.21 μA cm−2 (pH = 12). Fig. 5b shows the relative self-powered characteristic curve of Pphversus pH under SL. It can be seen that the fitted curve is similar to the ones above (Fig. 4b and d), indicating that the Te@Se-based PD can be used for self-powered pH detection.

A dynamic pH response, reversibility, and long-term stability are essential for practical applications. In order to better evaluate the self-powered pH-sensitive capability of the Te@Se-based PDs, dynamic pH response experiments were further implemented. Fig. 6a and b show the dynamic pH responses of Pph of Te@Se-based PDs in different pH electrolytes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a that as the pH decreases from 7 to 5 and further decreases to 3 and 1, the corresponding response time (tres) is calculated to be 0.85, 1.12, and 1.83 s, respectively, indicating the fast self-powered dynamic pH response of Te@Se-based PDs. More importantly, the obtained Pph values during the experiments are calculated to be 3.71 μA cm−2 (pH = 5), 2.77 μA cm−2 (pH = 3), and 2.21 μA cm−2 (pH = 1), which are within the error range. The same phenomenon can also be found in Fig. 6b as the pH increased from 7 to 9 and further increased to 14. Fig. 6c shows the dynamic pH response of the Te@Se-based PDs with the pH increasing from 1 to 14. An excellent dynamic pH response can also be detected, and the Pph values are calculated to be 2.76 μA cm−2 (pH = 3), 5.75 μA cm−2 (pH = 7), and 10.11 μA cm−2 (pH = 14), which are still within the error range. Fig. 6d and e exhibit the reversibility test of the Te@Se-based PDs. It can be seen that Pph can reach its original value after the pH returns to its initial value, and no significant degradation of Pph can be detected, which further demonstrates the great potential of Te@Se-based PDs for self-powered pH detection.

The long-term stability is another important parameter to evaluate the performance of PDs. Fig. S6a and c (ESI†) show the long-term stability tests of the PDs over 30 days operating for 10000 s under SL in electrolytes with a pH of 1 and 14 under 0 V, respectively. Fig. S6b and d (ESI†) exhibit the selected area of the ON/OFF signals intercepted from 8000 to 8500 s in each case to better observe the reproducibility of the PDs. Excellent reproducibility of the PDs can be found, and the Pph of the PDs is calculated to be 1.98 μA cm−2 (pH = 1) and 9.27 μA cm−2 (pH = 14). There is about 7.91% and 8.67% attenuation of Pph in each case, which is possibly caused by the peeling off of Te@Se from the ITO glass. Although a certain attenuation of Pph can be detected, it is within an acceptable range, showing the great potential of Te@Se for self-powered PDs as well as pH detection.
As discussed above, Pph shows an increasing trend with the gradually increasing pH of the electrolyte under SL or selected illumination wavelengths. According to previously reported work, the increased Pph can be attributed to the reduced interfacial resistance between the materials and electrolytes.65,70 To get deep insight into the detailed optoelectronic properties of Te@Se in electrolytes with different pH values, we performed DFT calculations for sandwich Te@Se heterostructures as shown in Fig. 7a. The projected band structure of Te@Se is depicted in Fig. 7b, showing that the Te states and Se states are strongly hybridized. The valence band maximum (VBM) state of Te@Se mainly consists of Te 5p orbitals as well as Se 4p orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mainly contributed by Se 4p orbitals and a part of Te 5p orbitals, indicating that the charge distributions of the CBM and VBM states are separated on the different layers of Te@Se (Fig. S7, ESI†), which can effectively separate photo-induced electrons and holes to avoid carrier recombination, resulting in the increased Pph of the devices. Therefore, Te@Se-based PDs could have significantly improved optoelectronic performance compared to pristine Te or Se-based PDs. It should also be emphasized that the Se atoms are exposed to the external environment in Te@Se, which provides more possibilities of electronic structure modulation through surface functionalization, external fields, and the pH value of electrolytes. In addition, Fig. S8 (ESI†) illustrates the band structure of 2D Te and Se, indicating the formation of a type II hetero-junction. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, due to the diffusion of intrinsic carriers in Te and Se, a built-in electric field will be generated at the interface. Under illumination, photoinduced carriers are generated. Driven by the built-in electric field, electrons move toward the conduction band of Se, while holes diffuse to the valence band of Te, which can facilitate photoinduced electron–hole pair separation and suppress the rapid recombination of carriers. In type II hetero-junction-based devices, the photocurrent can transport and recirculate multiple times within their lifetimes, leading to an enhancement in photo-response behaviors.

(f and g) Partial density of states (DOS) and optical absorption coefficient of Te@Se with adsorbed O2 under alkaline conditions. 
The observed pH-dependent photo-response behaviors of Te@Se could be explained by the existence of surface O2 chemisorption/desorption. It is well known that O2 chemisorption/desorption play a significant role in modulating the photo-response process, which was found for other materials before.71–73 Here, we investigate the adsorption behaviors of O2 molecules on the Te@Se surface under acidic and basic conditions. In acidic electrolytes, the proton H+ can be attached to the Te@Se surface, leading to the formation of Se–H bonds by capturing electrons from Te@Se (Fig. S9a, ESI†). When the dissolved O2 molecules approach the Te@Se surface, they could be adsorbed by the surface. The adsorption energy is further calculated (see the Experimental section, DFT calculation, ESI†) with a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell to evaluate the interaction between an O2 molecule and Te@Se. The relaxed configuration and differential charge density of Te@Se with adsorbed O2 under acidic conditions are presented in Fig. S9b and c (ESI†). The adsorption energy is calculated to be 0.078 eV, suggesting a very weak physisorption of O2 on the surface. The distance between the bottom O atom and its nearest Se atom is 3.008 Å. The O–O bond length is 1.254 Å, which is similar to that of the isolated O2 molecule (1.223 Å). The differential charge density showed that there is no obvious charge transfer between the O2 molecule and Te@Se. With the gradually increasing pH, the amount of OH− increases in the electrolytes, and exceeds the H+ ion content in the basic condition. The OH− ions attach to the Te@Se surface to form Se–O bonds with electron migration from Te@Se (Fig. 7c). The O2 adsorption energy is calculated to be 0.433 eV, which is much larger than that in the acidic electrolytes, indicating a much stronger interaction between the O2 molecule and Te@Se. The larger adsorption energy corresponds to a more stable configuration, where O2 molecules are almost parallel to the surface (Fig. 7d). The distances between the O atom and its nearest Se atom are 2.017 Å and 1.804 Å, respectively, which are shorter than those in the acidic electrolytes (3.008 Å and 3.873 Å). The O–O bond is also elongated to 1.539 Å. As shown in Fig. 7e, we can observe an apparent charge accumulation region in O2 and Te@Se and an considerable amount of electron transfer from OH− terminated Te@Se to the O2 molecule, forming negatively charged ions [O2(g) + ne− → O2n− (ad.), n = 1–2]. From the projected DOS, as depicted in Fig. 7f, we can observe the hybridization of O2 2p states and Se 4p (Te 5p) states in a wide energy range below the Fermi energy, reflecting the strong adsorption of O2 molecules on OH− terminated Te@Se. In comparison to pristine Te@Se (Fig. 7g), the optical absorption coefficients of Te@Se with adsorbed O2 hardly changed after O2 absorption, spanning the whole regime concerned from infrared to ultraviolet in the alkaline electrolytes. However, in the light process, the adsorbed negatively charged O2n− ions could be desorbed from the OH− terminated Te@Se to form dissolved O2 molecules in the electrolytes again, releasing electrons, which leads to a significantly increased Pph of Te@Se under basic conditions (Fig. 3a–d).
Apart from Pph, it is found that the photo-response speed of the Te@Se-based PDs is also affected by the pH value of the electrolytes. We intercept one typical ON/OFF signal from level IV of the PDs in different electrolytes and obtain the typical response and recovery time for different pH values. As can be seen from Fig. S9d and e (ESI†), the response and recovery time gradually increase with the increase of the pH. In the weak acidic electrolyte (pH = 2), the measured photo-response and recovery time are 0.03 and 0.04 s, respectively. As the pH of the electrolyte increases to 10, the response and recovery speed get slower (0.06/0.09 s). The response and recovery time are calculated to be 0.43 and 0.89 s with a further increase of the pH, which are almost 10–20 times longer than those in the weak acidic solutions (pH = 2). It is worth noting that the decreased photo-response speed stems from the absorption/desorption of O2. For example, in the weak acidic electrolyte (pH = 2), due to the very weak interaction between the O2 molecule and Te@Se (with a calculated adsorption energy of 0.078 eV), the absorption/desorption process proceeds very quickly, resulting in a fast photo-response speed. In the basic electrolyte, OH− ions become dominant, and the calculated large adsorption energy (0.433 eV) suggests that the absorption/desorption process will be slowed due to the strong O2 absorption on the OH− terminated Te@Se, resulting in long response and recovery times, which is in good agreement with our observations in experiments.
Conclusions
In summary, a 2D VI–VI Te@Se binary heterostructure was successfully prepared through the hydrothermal method. The structure, composition, and optical absorption of Te@Se were thoroughly investigated. The studies show that Te@Se is considered as a promising nanomaterial for PEC-type photodetection with pH-sensitivity in a wide range from 1 to 14. Additionally, Te@Se-based PDs also possess advantages like self-powered pH-sensitive capability, fast dynamic pH response and pronounced long-term stability (over 30 days). DFT calculations further evidence that the pH-sensitive photo-response behaviors of Te@Se can be attributed to the different O2 chemisorption/desorption behaviors on the Te@Se surface in different electrolytes. It is believed that the presented work paves the way for designing novel VI–VI binary heterostructures for multifunctional applications of both photodetection and chemical sensing.
