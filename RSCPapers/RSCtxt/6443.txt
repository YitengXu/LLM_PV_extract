    , Accepted 6th March 2012First published on 9th March 2012AbstractHigh-aspect-ratio TiO2 nanotube arrays formed by anodic oxidation have drawn extensive attention due to their easy fabrication and various excellent optical, electrical and biomedical properties. In contrast to conventional single-layer TiO2 nanotubes prepared via constant-voltage anodization, we synthesize multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays with high surface area by using alternating-voltage anodization steps. This work presents synthesis and growth mechanisms of single-layer smooth TiO2 nanotubes, bamboo-type nanotubes and double-layer nanotubes, by tuning various parameters such as voltage, time, and water content in the electrolyte. It is found that ion diffusion inside the nanotubes dominates growth of these three structures. A stable pH and ion-diffusion profile allows the steady growth of smooth TiO2 tubes in NH4F-containing ethylene glycol (EG). The addition of a low-voltage anodization step reduces the pH and ion-diffusion gradient in the nanotubes and induces formation of bamboo-type nanotubes and double-layer nanotubes when a second high-voltage anodization is conducted. Ion diffusion through a nanotube takes time; thus formation of lower-layer TO2 nanotubes costs more time if longer nanotubes are grown in the upper layer, since ions diffuse through these longer nanotubes. This ion-diffusion controlled growth mechanism is further confirmed by tailoring the water content (0–20 vol%) in the electrolyte and the voltage gaps to control the time needed for initiation of lower-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays. The fundamental understanding of the growth characteristics of double-layer TiO2 nanotubes presented in this paper offers us more flexibility in engineering morphology, tuning dimensions and phase compositions of multilayer TiO2 nanotubes. In addition, we synthesize double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays composed of one layer of anatase phase and another layer of amorphous phase.
1. Introduction
Since ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays were first prepared by anodic oxidation of titanium in 2001, this nanomaterial has attracted tremendous interest due to its large surface area and various properties.1 In the past decade, anodic TiO2 nanotubes have been widely used in gas sensing,2,3 photocatalysis,4,5 solar cells,6,7 biomedical materials,8,9 and rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,10,11 One advantage of TiO2 nanotubes is their easy controllable fabrication via anodic oxidation. The length, diameter and wall features of TiO2 nanotubes can be adjusted by tuning preparation conditions, such as applied oxidation voltages (constant12 or alternating13,14), electrolyte composition and anodization time. Such controbility in synthesis allows easy optimization of tube morphologies for targeted properties and application performances. To date, three generations of anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays have been synthesized and studied: The first-generation nanotubes only have a length up to 500 nm, due to a high dissolution rate of TiO2 in acid HF-based aqueous electrolytes.2,15 The second-generation nanotubes are fabricated in neutral fluoride-based aqueous solutions where the fast oxide dissolution is alleviated, and thus their length extends to 6.4 μm.15,16 Afterwards, water in the electrolyte is found to play a significant role in the TiO2 dissolution, and organic liquids start to replace water as the main solvent in the electrolyte, yielding smooth or bamboo-type (with ridges on outer tube walls) TiO2 nanotubes with a length up to 500 μm.17–20 These nanotubes formed in organic electrolyte are denoted as third-generation TiO2 nanotube arrays, which have much more flexibility in their tube length.
Numerous efforts have been made to further increase the surface area of anodic TiO2 nanotubes, which is favorable for surface reactions and related applications. For example, Chen et al.21 and Butail et al.22 synthesized hierarchically branched TiO2 nanotubes with tailored diameters and branch numbers by adjusting anodization voltages. To improve the surface area of long TiO2 nanotubes grown in water-poor organic electrolytes that have smooth outer and inner walls, Schmuki et al. fabricated bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes with regular ridges on the outer tube walls by anodizing titanium sheets under alternating voltages;23 this bamboo structure delivers more dye loading per unit volume when used in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs), and yields a photo conversion efficiency which is 55% higher than that of smooth-walled tubes with identical film thickness,13 Other methods include coating anodic TiO2 nanotubes with nano-sized TiO2 particles, and such hierarchical nanostructure delivers higher power conversion efficiencies than uncoated nanotubes when used in DSSCs.24
Likewise, multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays will also have higher surface area due to extra layers or interfaces present between two neighbouring nanotube layers, while retaining the vertically ordered one-dimensional nanostructure. In addition, multilayer nanotubes provide more light scattering when used in DSSCs and offer more flexibility for dimension tuning and morphology engineering.13,25 Yasuda et al. have prepared four layers of zirconium titanate nanotubes by using a multi-step anodization process of Ti-Zr alloys.26 Li et al. and Wang et al. both fabricated multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays by applying high and low voltages alternately for anodization steps.27,28 Macak et al. and Yang et al. obtained multilayer TiO2 nanotubes via anodizing Ti sheets in different electrolytes alternately.29,30 To date, there are only a few short papers about synthesis of multilayer nanotubes arrays as summarized above; there are no fundamental explorations of growth mechanism underlying these synthesis and no clear understanding of factors that control the formation of different nanostructures.
In this paper, we employ ethylene glycol-based electrolyte containing a small amount of NH4F and H2O to synthesize various TiO2 nanotube structures such as single-layer nanotubes, bamboo-type nanotubes and multilayer nanotubes; this electrolyte is different from those used in previous reports27,28 and offers more flexibility for tuning voltage/time and water content to explore growth mechanisms of various TiO2 nanotube structures. We present the first description of double-layer nanotubes with closed-bottom tubes in the upper layer, and bamboo-type nanotubes with concave waists are synthesized for the first time by adjusting the high and low voltages in the alternating anodization sequence.‡ It is found that growth of different TiO2 nanotube structures is ion-diffusion controlled. Fundamental understanding of the growth characteristics of double-layer TiO2 nanotubes presented in this paper offers us more flexibility in engineering the morphology, tuning dimensions and phase compositions of multilayer TiO2 nanotubes. In addition, we achieve double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays with different phases in different layers.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Effect of anodization time ratio
To synthesize multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays, we use a multi-step anodization process by applying high and low voltages alternately as shown in Fig. 1. The ratio of high-voltage anodization time (t1, t3) to low-voltage anodization time (t2) affects the structural features of TiO2 nanotube arrays. To simplify our investigation, t1 is set equal to t3 and thus the ratio of t2 to t1 is under our consideration. Fig. 2a shows SEM images of double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays formed by an anodization sequence with 60 V for 2 min followed by 10 V for 2 min and 60 V for 2 min, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. The two nanotube layers have the same thickness of 500 nm, and there is a rough porous barrier layer in between. The upper-layer nanotubes have an outer diameter of 80 nm and nanotubes underneath have a larger outer diameter of 120 nm. Nanotubes in both layers are well-organized and cylindrical, with spheric bottoms as a characteristic of the closed ends of anodic TiO2 nanotubes. As we increase the anodization time to 10 min but keep t2/t1 ratio (=1:1) unchanged, as shown in Fig. 2d, double-layer TiO2 nanotubes are yielded with a longer tube length; the total thickness of the upper layer and lower layer reaches ∼3.5 μm (Fig. 2c); and the nanotubes in both layers have a larger outer diameter of ∼140 nm (Fig. 2c). Fig. S1a† presents the top-view SEM image of these double-layer nanotubes, showing the upper layer with open entrances.

The length of the TiO2 nanotubes can be further increased by using an even longer anodization time. To study the growth mechanism of multilayer TiO2 nanotubes, we use a long anodization time which allows for variation of the t2/t1 ratio, and to prepare single-layer TiO2 nanotubes for comparison purposes. When a constant voltage (60 V for 2 h) is applied, the absence of low-voltage anodization (t2 = 0) leads to the formation of single-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays (Fig. 3a–b). The formed tubular structure is composed of hollow nanotubes that are well-aligned with an open entrance (Fig. S1b†) and a closed bottom. The tubes have smooth inner walls and outer walls, with an outer diameter of 170 nm and a length of ∼13 μm. When low-voltage anodization is applied for a short time (t2 = 10 min, t2/t1 = 1:6), bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays are yielded with ridges (or bamboo rings) in the middle of outer tube walls and a total tube length of ∼9.5 μm (Fig. 3c–d). The ridges form a connecting layer to bind the nanotubes together above and underneath; the ridges also divide a whole tube into two sections. The upper section is formed during the t1 period, and the lower section during the t3 period. The outer diameter of the nanotubes in the upper section (170 nm) is smaller than that in the lower section (200 nm), though the inner tube walls of two sections are both smooth and vertical to the substrate. Open entrances are also found in the upper-section TiO2 nanotubes, as shown in its top-view SEM image (Fig. S1c†). Gaps among nanotubes are much wider in the upper section, indicating that dissolution of oxides in the inter-tube cavities becomes much more difficult due to the block of the ridge-layer and thus there is less dissolution of oxides when growing nanotubes in the lower section during anodization in the t3 period.

When t2 is increased to 60 min with t1 and t3 kept at 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1), a double-layer structure composed of smooth TiO2 nanotubes in each layer emerges, with a total thickness of two layers at 9.0 μm (Fig. 3e–h). In each layer, all nanotubes have open entrances (Fig. S1d†) and a closed bottom. The outer diameter of the upper-layer nanotubes is about 170 nm, while the more closely-packed lower-layer nanotubes have a slightly larger outer tube diameter. This difference in nanotube diameters is ascribed to different current densities between the first and second high-voltage anodization steps. The higher the current density, the larger the tube diameter.31–33 These two layers of nanotubes are connected by a thin porous barrier layer in between, which is considered to be the origin of lower-layer nanotubes.26 Based on these results, it could be concluded that layer structure of TiO2 nanotube arrays is largely affected by the duration of the anodization voltages. Constant-voltage anodization in an organic electrolyte usually gives single-layer smooth-walled nanotubes. When a low-voltage anodization step is added, ridges will be formed on the outer tube walls initially, leading to formation of bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes. If the low-voltage anodization step proceeds for sufficiently long time (e.g., t2/t1 ratio increased from 1:6 to 1:1), the previous single layer turns out to be two distinct layers of smooth nanotubes with closed bottoms, which are connected by a thin porous layer in between.
The evolution of a layered structure with the anodization time ratio can be confirmed in other cases where t1 (t3 = t1) and t2 are changed but using the same t2/t1 ratios as above. For example, anodization of titanium at 60 V for 60 min leads to formation of single-layer smooth TiO2 nanotubes (Fig. S2a–b†), while an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 30 min followed by 10 V for 5 min (t2/t1 = 1:6) and 60 V for 30 min results in bamboo-type nanotubes with ridges in the middle (Fig. S2c–d†). When the anodization time at 10 V is increased to 30 min (t2/t1 = 1:1), two layers of smooth nanotubes with closed bottoms are formed (Fig. S2e–f†). Hence, it can be concluded that a t2/t1 ratio equal to 1:1 is a critical electrochemical parameter for initiation of double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays in EG electrolytes with an addition of 0.3 wt% NH4F and 5 vol% H2O at room temperature. It should be noted here that tube length in each layer is dependent on the corresponding anodization time,16 and thus the thickness of the double-layer TiO2 nanotubes can be adjusted simply by tuning the anodization time.
TEM and EDAX are used to analyze the morphological features and chemical composition of anodic TiO2 nanotubes. Fig. S3† shows the TEM image of a single TiO2 nanotube and EDAX signals are captured from three different spots of this nanotube. All the EDAX spectra from the three spots are similar (inset of Fig. S3†), revealing the presence of Ti and O from the nanotube in addition to Cu and C from the TEM sample membrane consisting of a copper grid and carbon film. To examine further the composition of the nanotubes, the Ti2p and O1s XPS spectra of as-synthesized single-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays and double-layer nanotube arrays are given in Fig. S4.† These tubular oxide films are scratched off the metal substrate, and then put face-up on conductive adhesive copper tapes for elemental analysis of the top surface or face-down for analysis of the nanotube base. Two characteristic peaks of Ti 2p1/2 at 464.3 eV and Ti 2p3/2 at 458.5 eV (ΔE = 5.8 eV) are clearly seen in XPS spectra of both the surface and base of single-layer nanotubes, which correspond to Ti4+ (Fig. S4a†).34,35 Meanwhile, O1s peaks taken from the top and base of nanotubes have the same binding energy of 530.1 eV, corresponding to the Ti–O bond of TiO2.34 Similarly, the Ti2p and O1s XPS spectra taken from the surface of upper-layer nanotubes and the base of lower-layer nanotubes in the double-layer nanotubes also reveal the formation of fully oxidized Ti and resultant Ti4+ oxides (Fig. S4b†). Therefore, it can be concluded that titanium is fully oxidized during formation of either a single-layer or double-layer structure via anodization, yielding TiO2 nanotubes.
2.2 Barrier layer in multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays
In order to investigate the growth process of lower-layer nanotubes (the second layer), the upper layer nanotubes are removed by bending the sample and the upper layer is delaminated and peeled off. We fabricate double-layer nanotubes via an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 10 min followed by 10 V for 10 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 10 min. After the upper-layer nanotubes are removed, a porous barrier layer is revealed to cover the lower-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays, as shown in Fig. 4a. The barrier layer is formed during the low-voltage anodization stage. It can be seen that the barrier layer has a very rough surface, full of regular concave regions. These concave regions correspond to the semi-spheric bottoms of upper-layer nanotubes. Besides, numerous fine pores or pits exist in the barrier layer, which function as channels for ion diffusion into or out of the lower layer. The pores or pits may also act as origins of new layers of nanotubes below. This is confirmed by a tubular barrier layer in the double-layer structure formed via a longer anodization sequence (60 V for 30 min, then 10 V for 30 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 30 min), as shown in Fig. 4b (upper-layer nanotubes are removed). This barrier layer has a thickness of about 150 nm and is composed of a large amount of directional small nanotubes. The small tubes cover the entrance of the large tubes below, and some of them even become part of walls of large tubes. Similarly, such tubular barrier layer also exists in the double-layer structure formed via an even longer anodization sequence (60 V for 60 min, then 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min), as shown in Fig. 4c (upper-layer nanotubes are removed). These results indicate that a thin layer of small nanotubes is formed at low voltage (10 V) for a certain period, leading to a sandwiched structure. To confirm this, an anodization sequence containing a very long low-voltage anodization time (even longer than high-voltage anodization time) (60 V for 10 min, then 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 6:1) and 60 V for 10 min) is carried out on titanium. The layer of small nanotubes formed at 10 V is clearly seen between the upper-layer and the lower-layer of nanotubes formed at 60 V (Fig. 4d). The outer diameter of small nanotubes is 37 nm, much smaller than that of the upper-layer nanotubes (∼111 nm) and lower-layers (∼170 nm) tubes grown at high voltage. The much smaller diameter of nanotubes grown during the low voltage anodization is due to the smaller current density when the low voltage is applied.32,33

All samples are synthesized in EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 5 vol% H2O using different anodization sequences: (a) 60 V for 10 min followed by 10 V for 10 min and 60 V for 10 min; (b) 60 V for 30 min followed by 10 V for 30 min and 60 V for 30 min; (c) 60 V for 60 min followed by 10 V for 60 min and 60 V for 60 min; (d) 60 V for 10 min followed by 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 6:1) and 60 V for 10 min, with t2 much longer than t1. 
2.3 Growth mechanism of multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays
It is well-known that the growth of anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays is divided into three stages. Initially, a compact oxide layer is formed once voltage is applied; later, pits and pores emerge in the compact layer and turn this layer into a porous film; finally, the pores are separated by inter-pore cavities, eventually resulting in an ordered tubular layer.36 In fact, this morphological evolution of anodic TiO2 film is a result of the competition between electrochemical etching process and chemical dissolution process on titanium.37 The two processes involves three simultaneously occurring chemical reactions as follows:38(1) Field-assisted oxidation of Ti: water molecules decompose near the metal and produce O2− ions and H+ ions;39 the O2− ions then travel through an electrolyte-oxide interface to oxidize Ti. The reactions are described as: H2O → 2H+ + O2−(1) Ti + 2O2− → TiO2 + 4e(2)(2) Field-assisted dissolution of titanium oxides: due to electric field, the Ti–O bond undergoes polarization and is weakened, promoting dissolution of the oxides. (3) Chemical dissolution of titanium oxides: herein, Ti4+ cations become soluble hexafluorotitanium complexes [TiF6]2− that go into the electrolyte, while the free O2− anions transfer to the oxide–metal interface and react with Ti. The reaction is described as: TiO2 + 6F− + 4H+ → TiF62− + 2H2O(3)
Under the applied electrical field, three chemical reactions occur simultaneously at the anode. Fig. 5a presents the ion profiles inside a tube or a inter-tube cavity present in an oxide film on a Ti substrate.40 In the neutral electrolyte, H+ ions mostly come from water decomposition at the tube bottom (eqn (1)), which partly diffuse towards bulk eletrolyte and establish a pH profile. After the anodization starts, ion diffusion gradients are gradually established in the first two stages that finally allow a stable growth of TiO2 nanotubes under a high voltage.23 The shaded area in Fig. 5b represents the stable pH gradient decreasing from the tube bottom to tube entrance. Under constant-voltage anodization (60 V), Ti is continuously oxidized (eqn (2)) and the oxide/metal interface moves towards the substrate, while tube-bottom oxides are dissolved (eqn (3)) and the electrolyte/oxide interface moves towards the substrate as well. This system would result in formation of single-layer TiO2 nanotubes with controllable lengths and an oxide barrier layer (thinner than the tube walls) below the nanotubes.
 Fig. 5  Schematic showing growth of single-layer, bamboo-type and double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays via anodic oxidation: (a) ion diffusion profiles inside nanotubes; (b) pH gradient profile in nanotubes during their steady growth stage at a high voltage; (c) less-steep pH gradient and pit or pore formation after the voltage is altered to a low value; (d) formation of bamboo-type nanotubes; (e) further less-steep pH gradient and tube formation when the low voltage is kept for a longer period; (f) formation of double-layer TiO2 nanotubes. 
Once this system is altered to a lower voltage (10 V), fewer H+ ions are yielded and the pH profile is changed to a less steep gradient (Fig. 5c). This should slow down dissolution of oxides at the tube bottom, yielding a thicker compact barrier layer there. After a certain period of time, the appearance of small pits and pores in the barrier layer occurs under low voltage, just like the first stage of tube formation introduced above. In this situation, a subsequent step back to the high voltage (60 V) would restart the growth of previous tubes and cavities toward the substrate, and the formed pits and pores in the barrier layer are eaten or consumed by them. However, part of the thick barrier layer between two neighbouring nanotubes survives and residues on the tube walls to form ridges as shown above, yielding bamboo-type tubes (Fig. 5d). If the low-voltage anodization is kept for longer time (e.g. t2/t1 ratio ≥ 1), the barrier layer becomes thinner and the pits and pores grow to become small tubes (Fig. 5e). As a result, the H+ ions become much fewer due to outward diffusion and participation in the oxide dissolution, and the pH gradient is much less steep. At a critical point, this system is able to induce a second formation and growth of bigger TiO2 nanotubes under a subsequent high-voltage (60 V), as shown in Fig. 5f, yielding double-layer nanotube arrays. The existing small nanotubes cover the newly-formed lower layer, and some of them are even integrated into the walls of bigger nanotubes in the lower layer.
This model can be used to explain the effect of the anodization time ratio t2/t1 on the morphology of anodic TiO2 nanotubes. The key to the formation of double-layer nanotubes is an adequate change of the ion concentration inside the tubes and cavities. As the anodization voltage is reduced, the yield of H+ ions and diffusion rate of ions are decreased accordingly, and the ion concentration profiles in the nanotubes tends to be similar to that in the bulk electrolyte, which brings a greater probability for the formation of new nanotubes during the second high-voltage anodization (t3). If t1 is longer, nanotubes in the upper layer (first layer) are longer; thus it takes ions outside more time to diffuse through these longer nanotubes to reach the bottom of tubes, and more time for ions inside nanotubes to move out the tubes, hence, the ion concentration profiles need a longer time to change to the critical point for initiation of subsequent nanotube formation. In addition, the tube length is linear to the anodization time, and the diffusion time for ions that travel through the tubes is proportional to the tube length, so the variation of ion concentration profiles in tubes during t2 period is related to previous anodic time (t1). Therefore, it can be seen that the low-voltage anodization time t2 needs to be extended until the t2/t1 ratio reaches a critical value (e.g., 1:1) to grow the double-layer nanotube arrays, if the first high-voltage anodization proceeds for a longer time.
2.4 Effect of water content in organic electrolyte
The variation of ion concentration profiles inside TiO2 nanotubes largely depends on the ion diffusion through the tube, and more exactly on the diffusion coefficients of ions in the electrolyte. The diffusion coefficients are further influenced by the viscosity of electrolytes used.17Fig. 6a shows the TiO2 nanotubes grown via an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 60 min followed by 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min in anhydrous EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F. The resulting structures are single-layer smooth nanotubes, rather than the bamboo-type nanotubes or double-layer nanotubes formed using the same anodization sequence in electrolyte containing 5 vol% water shown earlier. This is attributed to few variations occuring in the ion concentration profiles inside the tubes and cavities. In such an anhydrous electrolyte, traces of water decompose at the tube bottom to support oxidation of metal and dissolution of oxides. Diffusion of various ions, including H+ ions, is quite slow in the tubes. Even though the duration of low-voltage anodization is as long, as in high-voltage anodization, the ion concentration profiles remain almost unchanged. As a result, the formation of bamboo-type or double-layer nanotubes is suppressed. Once the high voltage is applied again, traces of water are decomposed merely to continue the nanotube growth.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of TiO2 nanotube arrays synthesized (a) under 60 V for 60 min, 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min in anhydrous EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F; and under 60 V for 60 min, 10 V for 10 min (t1/t2 = 6:1) and 60 V for 60 min in EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and (b) 10 vol% H2O, (c) 15 vol% H2O, (d) 20 vol% H2O. 
In contrast, more water in the electrolyte allows faster ion diffusion and concentration change in nanotubes when switching voltages. Fig. 6b presents SEM images of bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes via an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 60 min followed by 10 V for 10 min (t2/t1 = 1:6) and 60 V for 60 min in EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 10 vol% H2O. The resulting nanotubes become shorter due to faster dissolution of oxide on tube walls by water. When the water content in electrolyte is increased to 15 vol%, the double-layer TiO2 nanotube array emerges, rather than bamboo-type TiO2 nanotube arrays (Fig. 6c). This is ascribed to the accelerated ion diffusion in a less viscous electrolyte, and efficient ion diffusion and ion concentration variation inside nanotubes to induce the production of a new layer of TiO2 nanotubes during the t3 period. The upper layer is composed of well-ordered nanotubes with closed bottoms, but the nanotubes in the lower layer have ordered bottoms but disordered tops, indicating that a certain instability occurs during growth of the lower layer. This instability becomes more distinct when the water content in the electrolyte is increased to 20 vol%, resulting in a very disordered sponge-like structure under which some small and short nanotube rudiments appear randomly (Fig. 6d).
2.5 Effect of voltage gaps
Our model discussed in section 3.3 can also explain the effect of voltage gap on the layer structure of anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays. Fig. 7a shows cross-section SEM images of TiO2 nanotubes grown via an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 60 min followed by 40 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min (Fig. 7b). This process with increased low voltage (40 V instead of 10 V) yields bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes with outer ridges that connect all nanotubes, while the same anodization sequence for a voltage pair of 60 V and 10 V results in double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays as shown in Fig. 3e earlier. The reason for the difference is that the gap or difference between high voltage and low voltage is too small in the case of 60 V and 40 V to cause drastic change of the ion concentration profiles in nanotubes for the electrolyte used. In other words, when voltage becomes 40 V, the production of H+ ions and ion diffusion inside nanotubes is still fast in the electric field,39 and the pH gradient and ion concentration profiles do not change much.40 As a result, the barrier layer becomes a little thicker for the formation of ridges on outer walls, but the subsequent tube growth during t3 period maintains the initial tubular structure. Moreover, it is worthy noting that a concave waist appears under the ridge of each nanotube, because the tube diameter becomes smaller due to the smaller current density when a low voltage of 40 V is applied.
 Fig. 7  (a) Cross-section SEM images of bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes synthesized in EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 5 vol% H2O via (b) a anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 60 min followed by 40 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min. 
2.6 Phase control of multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays
Controllable synthesis of multilayer TiO2 nanotubes via anodic oxidation allows us to optimize the morphology and phase structure of the material. Fig. 8a shows XRD patterns of two types of double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays. Both are produced via an anodization sequence composed of 60 V for 60 min followed by 10 V for 60 min (t2/t1 = 1:1) and 60 V for 60 min in EG electrolyte containing 0.3 wt% NH4F and 5 vol% H2O. However, one sample is annealed in air at 300 °C for 1 h prior to the low-voltage anodization at 10 V. The XRD pattern of the unheated sample only shows diffraction peaks from the Ti substrate, indicating that both the upper-layer and low-layer TiO2 nanotubes are amorphous.11,41 On the other hand, the annealed sample shows crystalline structure of anatase TiO2. In its XRD pattern, typical peaks (101) and (200) of metastable anatase are found to be at 2θ = 25.2° and at 2θ = 47.9° respectively.42,43 Since the lower-layer nanotubes are as-prepared one, the anatase crystallites must exist in the heated upper-layer nanotubes, and thus multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays composed of anatase upper layer and amorphous lower layer are successfully obtained, as shown in Fig. 8b.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized three types of layer structures: single-layer smooth TiO2 nanotubes, bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes, and double-layer TiO2 nanotubes. Growth mechanisms of the three are introduced and compared based on variations of pH and ion concentration profiles inside tubes and cavities. A sufficient ion concentration change is the key to the formation of bamboo-type and double-layer TiO2 nanotubes. The ratio of low-voltage anodization time to high-voltage anodization time (t2/t1) affects the morphology of TiO2 nanotubes. The higher the time ratio, the easier the formation of double-layer TiO2 nanotubes. Likewise, for a proper electrolyte, a bigger gap between the high voltage and the low voltage is favorable for the formation of double-layer nanotubes. An appropriate water content in electrolytes is also beneficial for the formation of double-layer nanotubes, but too much water renders the tubular structure unstable and even converts the ordered tube arrays to a disordered sponge-like structure. Based on the controllability of the synthesis of double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays, the phase composition of each layer can be manipulated through heating, and multilayer nanotubes with different phases in different layers can be achieved. Additionally, our work can be generalized to grow multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays consisting of more layers (e.g., three or four layers and so on), by tuning the voltages, anodization time ratio, and electrolyte composition.
Double-layer TiO2 nanotubes with closed bottoms have a higher surface area due to the extra layers or interfaces present between two neighbouring nanotube layers and offer more flexibility for morphology engineering and dimension tuning, while retaining the vertically ordered structure of a one-dimensional nanostructure. Furthermore, double-layer nanotube arrays provide more light scattering when used in DSSCs. Therefore, double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays can find wide applications as anodes in lithium-ion batteries and photo-anodes in dye-sensitized solar cells. In particular, for the double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays with different phases (anatase phase in the upper layer and amorphous phase in the lower layer), the anatase upper layer has higher mechanical strength and stronger corrosion resistance, which may facilitate growth of ultra-long nanotubes in the lower layer. In addition, the amorphous lower layer is more vulnerable to some solvents (e.g., H2O2) and thus its dissolution readily yields free-standing anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays that can be transferred to conductive glass or plastic substrates for DSSC assembly. The related work is currently in progress in our laboratory.

Prior to any electrochemical treatment, Ti foils were degreased and rinsed by sonicating in ethanol and deionized water. A two-electrode cell with a Pt mesh as the counter electrode was assembled for electrochemical anodization. Electrolytes were anhydrous ethylene glycol (EG) with 0.3 wt% NH4F and 0–20 vol% H2O. Water content was varied from 0 to 20 vol% for the synthesis of different TiO2 nanostructures and understanding of the growth mechanisms. All the solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals and deionized water. The voltage was supplied by a DC power supply with digital display (Model 1623A, PK Precision). To prepare multilayer TiO2 nanotubes, the anodization process consists of three sequences, as shown in Fig. 1. The voltage is first increased from zero to Vhigh with a ramp rate of 1 V s−1 and remains for a time t1, then drops to Vlow and is kept at Vlow for a time t2, followed by increasing to Vhigh with a rate of 1 V s−1 and being kept at Vhigh for a time t3. For comparison purpose, single-layer TiO2 nanotubes were prepared by anodizing Ti sheets at 60 V for 1 h and 2 h, respectively. Except that one sample was annealed at 300 °C for 1 h between the first and second anodization steps, all the experiments were carried out at room temperature. After anodization is completed, the samples were immediately rinsed in deionized water and dried in air. A FEI Quanta 3D FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of TiO2 nanotube arrays. The crystallographic structure of TiO2 nanotube arrays was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku MiniFlex diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation operated at 30 kV and 15 mA with a scan rate of 2° min−1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd) coupled with EDAX was used to characterize the morphology and composition of a single TiO2 nanotube. The chemical composition of the nanotubes was also analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, AXIS 165, Kratos Analytical Ltd.) with an AXIS 165 spectrometer from Kratos Analytical LTD by using a twin-anode Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All the XPS spectra were calibrated according to the binding energy of C1s peak at 284.8 eV.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012
