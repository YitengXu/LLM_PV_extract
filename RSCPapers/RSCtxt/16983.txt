    , Accepted 5th May 2013First published on 9th May 2013AbstractThe effect of solvent additives on the performance of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) field effect transistors (FETs) was investigated. Hole mobilities increased from 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for pristine devices to 0.73 or 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1, when TIPS-pentacene FETs were processed with diphenyl ether (DPE) or chloronaphthalene (CN), respectively. In order to examine the impact of additives on the surface morphology, molecular ordering and crystallinity of TIPS-pentacene, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy measurements were carried out. Appropriate amounts of additives were found to induce the formation of well-ordered crystalline domains in TIPS-pentacene films, resulting in enhanced hole transport as well as consistent device performance. Additionally, reduced contact resistances were observed in devices processed with additives compared to neat TIPS-pentacene FET devices. Our findings indicate that the use of solvent additives constitutes a new and effective methodology for the fabrication of OFETs with improved performance.
Introduction
Solution processed organic field effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted much attention due to their low temperature, solution-based fabrication without the requirement for high-vacuum processing steps, and their potential application in low-cost, flexible and large-area electronics.1–4 In particular, 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) has been the subject of intensive investigation as an OFET active material owing to its good hole transport properties and high solubility in common organic solvents.2–30 However, the crystalline order in TIPS-pentacene films is typically highly anisotropic with highly localized crystalline domains which lead to great deviations in device performance.5 To date, control of crystallization, film uniformity, and crystal orientation of small molecule films deposited via solution processing routes remains a significant challenge.
In order to address this issue, an abundance of experiments have been carried out using a variety of architectures, materials and processing methods. These attempts have included; (i) various gate dielectric materials such as cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOPs), polyvinylphenol (PVP) and methyl-siloxane-based spin-on glass (SOG),2,6–10 (ii) various deposition methods including drop casting, solution-sheared deposition, hollow-pen-writing and double-shot inkjet printing,3,11–14 (iii) various solvents (chlorobenzene, chloroform, anisole, toluene, etc.)15–19 and solvent mixtures (isopropanol–toluene, acetonitrile–toluene, chloroform–toluene, p-xylene–toluene, tetralin–toluene, and acetophenone–anisole),20–23 and (iv) TIPS-pentacene:polymer blends such as poly(α-methyl styrene) (PαMS), poly(triarylamine) (PTAA), poly(4-diphenylamino)styrene (PDAS) and polystyrene.16,18,24–30 Among these processing methods, a mobility of up to 1.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved with a TIPS-pentacene:PTAA blend FET, while the solution-sheared method led to a peak mobility of 4.59 cm2 V−1 s−1 at an optimized shearing speed. These processing strategies revealed well-ordered π–π stacking and excellent crystallinity in both thin films and bulk crystals.4 Although many research groups have devoted significant effort to achieving well-ordered crystalline films and improved hole mobilities in TIPS-pentacene FETs by various means, they still suffer from unresolved problems such as irregular crystalline formation and poor reproducibility of device performance under identical experimental conditions.
The use of high boiling point processing additives has been accepted as a simple and effective way to modify the phase separation of photoactive layers and to improve the power conversion efficiency in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on both polymers as well as small molecules.31–36 A variety of solvent additives have been demonstrated as an effective means to achieve morphological tuning and optimal phase separation without the need for thermal annealing in blends of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers, where their performance is largely determined by crystallization in the BHJ layer. Given the ability of solvent additives to control and enhance the crystallization in solution-processed organic semiconductors, solvent additives may have great utility and impact in the fabrication of solution processed OFETs such as those based on TIPS-pentacene. However, to our knowledge, solvent additives not yet been investigated in this context and the effects of solvent additives on the electronic properties of OFETs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate solvent processing additives as an alternative to polymer additives and troublesome fabrication methods, as a route to achieve crystallization and high device performance in TIPS-pentacene FETs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy were used to investigate the film morphology of TIPS-pentacene films processed with additives, and bottom-contact OFETs were fabricated to evaluate the device performance. Microscopy of films processed with additives reveals that 0.5% diphenyl ether (DPE, boiling point (B.P.) of 258 °C) and 0.2% chloronaphthalene (CN, B.P. 263 °C) can appropriately improve crystal geometry while maintaining a high degree of crystallinity. XRD and UV-Vis absorption spectra reveal enhanced optical absorption after additive incorporation, which provide evidence for TIPS-pentacene molecular aggregation. The improved crystallization and film morphology obtained by processing with solvent additives lead to considerably improved hole mobilities in TIPS-pentacene FETs. This work demonstrates that additives provide a novel means to mediate the crystallization of solution processed small molecules and may be used to effectively reduce variations in the performance of solution-processed organic FETs.
Results and discussion
A bottom-gate, bottom-contact OFET configuration was used throughout this work with a 340 nm polyvinylphenol (PVP) gate insulator. Fig. 1a shows typical transfer characteristics of TIPS-pentacene FETs processed using 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% DPE (see Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI†). The OFET based on pure TIPS-pentacene exhibits a hole mobility (μ) of 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to the values measured in earlier work.11 The performance of TIPS-pentacene FETs processed with DPE shows a strong dependence on the concentration of DPE; examination of the transfer curves reveals increased source–drain current (IDS) for OFETs processed with 0.25% DPE, and an even greater increase in IDS for devices processed with 0.5% DPE. The extracted hole mobilities in the saturation mode are 0.56 (for 0.25% DPE) and 0.73 cm2 V−1 s−1 (for 0.5% DPE). The total resistance (RT) was reduced for devices processed with 0.5% DPE relative to devices prepared without additives (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). In contrast, high loadings of DPE, i.e. 1%, decreased the IDS and resulted in an increased contact resistance (RC) of 2.76 MΩ (compared to 1.52 MΩ for the neat TIPS-pentacene FET), accompanied by poor charge transport properties (μ ∼ 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1). No strong dependence on additive concentration was observed for the threshold voltage (Vth) of devices with 0–0.5% DPE, which remained in the range of 0.4 to 1 V in all cases.
 Fig. 1  Transfer characteristics of TIPS-pentacene FETs with (a) DPE and (b) CN additives. TIPS-pentacene layers were drop-cast from anisole solutions using various additive concentrations: 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% DPE and 0.2%, 0.25% and 0.5% CN. Insets show the chemical structures of DPE and CN additives used in this work. 
To investigate the effect of other additives on the electronic transport in TIPS-pentacene FETs, CN was chosen as a processing additive which has been successfully used in BHJ solar cells while possessing a boiling point close to that of DPE. TIPS-pentacene FETs were fabricated using the same procedure used with DPE involving various CN additive concentrations in a solvent of anisole. Table 1 provides a summary of the device characteristics of TIPS-pentacene FETs. Similar to DPE, a small amount of CN enhances the device performance of TIPS-pentacene FETs (Fig. 1b), leading to an increase in μ from 0.12 to 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon incorporation of 0.2% additive. In contrast to DPE, the IDS of TIPS-pentacene FETs drops with increasing CN concentration, i.e. 0.25% and 0.5%. The RC increased to 5.44 MΩ and 9.30 MΩ for devices prepared with 0.25% and 0.5% CN, respectively, compared to an RC of 3.27 MΩ for the device without additive. Additionally, 0.5% CN induced an increase in off current relative to other concentrations. The calculated hole mobilities are 0.29 for 0.25% CN and 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 0.5% CN. As with DPE, the Vth was not strongly affected by the additive concentration. In addition, the current on/off ratio exhibited little dependence on the CN concentration in the range of 0–0.25%. It is noteworthy that the measured variation in μ decreases dramatically when TIPS-pentacene FETs are processed with additives compared to the neat TIPS-pentacene device. As shown in Table 1, the pure TIPS-pentacene FET exhibits μ varying by one order of magnitude (ranging from 10−2 and 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas the μ values of the TIPS-pentacene FETs with DPE or CN are relatively consistent. For instance devices processed with 0.5% DPE show mobilities in the range of 0.6 to 0.8 cm2 V−1 s−1 with low standard deviations of ±0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Overall, these results demonstrate that incorporation of appropriate amounts of solvent additives leads to enhancements in device performance in solution processed TIPS-pentacene FETs.

In order to understand how solvent additives are able to influence the device behavior, we examined how the additives modify the surface morphology of TIPS-pentacene by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2). As in the FET devices, the TIPS-pentacene films were prepared from anisole with various concentrations of DPE on pre-heated substrates at 46 °C. The surface morphology of the pristine TIPS-pentacene film exhibits layered lamellar crystal structures which radiate from central points in larger spherule structures. Interestingly, small volumes of DPE lead to significant changes in the surface morphology. The surface of TIPS-pentacene with 0.25% DPE features needle-like crystallites spread in all directions, while the introduction of 0.5% DPE results in V-shaped microcrystals with widths of greater than 10 μm. In contrast, high DPE loading (1%) leads to large, relatively even domains and shredded ribbon-like features. In general, it is accepted that carrier mobility is highly sensitive to the crystallinity of the active layers in OFETs due to the efficiency of charge transport across crystal domains and diminished trap sites. Thus, relatively well-ordered crystal structures lead to increased carrier mobility in OFETs, where such observations confirm the improved hole mobilities of TIPS-pentacene devices with 0.25% and 0.5% DPE compared to the control device and the device prepared with 1% DPE.
 Fig. 2  SEM images (×1000) of TIPS-pentacene films processed from anisole solutions with various concentrations of DPE: (a) 0%, (b) 0.25%, (c) 0.5%, and (d) 1% DPE. All films were prepared on substrates preheated at 46 °C. 
Similar changes in morphology were observed when small amounts of CN were used, as displayed in Fig. 3. TIPS-pentacene films prepared on a preheated substrate at 60 °C show a somewhat differing microstructure, with more elongated micro-crystal features, compared to films prepared at 46 °C (Fig. 2a). In the case of 0.2% CN (Fig. 3b), the surface topography shows highly packed domains and crystal structures which are similar to those observed using 0.5% DPE (Fig. 2c). The addition of 0.25% CN (Fig. 3c) results in the appearance of more needle-like crystallites radiating in all directions, comparable to the topography of the TIPS-pentacene film with 0.25% DPE (Fig. 2b). At 0.5% CN (Fig. 3d), one observes large, smooth domains and without micro-needle-like features. Similar to the results observed using DPE, the formation of well-ordered crystallites using CN supports the observed increase in carrier mobility in OFET devices. The overall surface morphologies observed by SEM confirm that a moderate concentration of solvent additives positively affects the formation of crystalline domains in TIPS-pentacene films, concomitant with improved device performance.
 Fig. 3  SEM images (×1000) of TIPS-pentacene films processed from anisole solutions with various concentrations of CN: (a) 0%, (b) 0.2%, (c) 0.25% and (d) 0.5% CN. All films were prepared on substrates preheated at 60 °C. 
Optical micrographs were obtained at the channel regions of completed FET devices in order to observe how the charge transporting region of the FET devices is affected by changes in the microstructure of the TIPS-pentacene films. Pristine devices show a highly anisotropic film with large variations in the grain width of TIPS-pentacene crystallites (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†), where the channel regions are spanned by multiple, relatively small crystallites. When small amounts of additives are used, the TIPS-pentacene crystals exhibit larger grain widths and more uniform grain size distribution. TIPS-pentacene films with 0.5% DPE and 0.2% CN, which exhibited the highest mobilities in this study, show channel regions which are largely filled by single crystalline domains with relatively few grain boundaries. As the concentration of DPE is increased to 1%, the films exhibit disordered domains, whereas 0.5% CN induced an amorphous and smooth surface; these device films yielded the lowest carrier mobilities out of the conditions investigated.
XRD results from TIPS-pentacene thin films with different additive loadings are shown in Fig. 4. The diffraction patterns consistently exhibit strong (00l) type reflections, which agree with results reported previously for TIPS-pentacene films.37 The (001) peak of the pristine TIPS-pentacene film (preheated at 46 °C) was observed at 2θ = 5.31°, which is attributed to an interplanar distance of 16.62 Å, due to the fact that the TIPS-pentacene molecules are oriented with the pentacene backbone parallel to the substrate surface. The scattering contributions from (00l) planes, which are characteristic of out-of-plane stacking in such crystalline matrices, exhibit significant differences upon the utilization of additives. This indicates that the introduction of additives varies the structural properties of the TIPS-pentacene films. A close examination of the (001) peak (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†) reveals gradual shifts with increasing DPE concentration, indicating slight changes in the interplanar distance of 16.56, 16.50 and 16.56 Å for 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% DPE. The (001) peak for the 0.25% DPE sample exhibits a subtle increase in full width at half maximum (FWHM) without change in intensity relative to the neat TIPS-pentacene film, (Fig. 4c). Notable changes in both intensity and peak width are observed from the sample processed with 0.5% DPE, corresponding to enhanced coherence length and increase in the crystallite size. The film prepared at the highest concentration of DPE (1%) exhibits reverse variations in both intensity and FWHM. These findings indicate that the use of an appropriate DPE concentration acts to enhance the ordering of the out-of-plane π–π stacking contribution within these films.

Different changes in structural properties are observed as a function of CN concentration varying between 0% and 0.5% (v/v). A strong scattering peak at 2θ = 5.37° (interplanar distance of 16.44 Å) is observed for the neat TIPS-pentacene prepared at 60 °C, which is distinguished from the pristine film prepared at 46 °C. The (001) peak moves to 5.35° (interplanar distance of 16.50 Å) when 0.2% CN is added, and no additional shift is observed upon increasing CN concentration. Fig. 4b and d show that at low CN concentration, the (001) peak width is minimally impacted, while at an intermediate concentration of CN a pronounced decrease in its value is found. As in the case of DPE, the FWHM increases significantly at a high CN concentration (0.5%), which can be attributed to reductions in both the coherence length and the crystallite size.
Finally, the optical behavior of the TIPS-pentacene films was investigated and also found to be strongly dependent on the choice and concentration of additives. UV-Vis spectra were obtained for the same films evaluated by SEM and XRD (see Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The insets show zoomed spectral features in the range of 500 to 800 nm. Each film processed using either DPE or CN exhibits absorption peaks characteristic of TIPS-pentacene at 589, 646, and 698 nm. No spectral shift or additional peaks are observed when the concentrations of DPE and CN are changed. However, changes in the relative intensity of absorption peaks are observed as the concentration of additives is changed. Increased intensities are associated with the enhanced packing of TIPS-pentacene molecules within ordered crystalline domains.7,28,30 The highest intensities are obtained from films processed with 0.5% DPE and 0.2% CN, the same conditions which showed the greatest crystalline order as deduced from the XRD analyses and the highest charge carrier mobilities.
It is worthwhile to consider how these differences relate to the concentration of each additive, their boiling points (BPs) and the rate of solvent evaporation. When films are fabricated from neat anisole (BP 154 °C), TIPS-pentacene shows a tendency to form relatively short layered lamellar structures during the short time period it takes for the anisole to evaporate. FETs with 0.25% and 0.5% DPE (BP 258 °C) show improved p-type device performance, indicating that DPE promotes self-assembly and the formation of elongated crystalline domains with fewer defects; likely by slowing the evaporation rate of the solvent as the film dries. However, higher loading (1% DPE) does not promote desirable self-assembly in this material. Similarly, TIPS-pentacene films processed with CN (BP 256 °C) show similar improvements in morphology and performance upon adding small quantities (0.2%) of CN and poor performance when too much CN is used. It is apparent that optimal films are formed when the concentration of additive (0.2–0.5%) is small compared to the concentration of TIPS pentacene (3%). Considering the state of the film after the anisole has evaporated, the remaining additive and TIPS pentacene are present in such a ratio that the additive would behave less like a solvent and more like a solute dissolved in TIPS pentacene. When the amount of additive approaches the quantity of TIPS pentacene, the additive may be present in sufficient amounts to behave as a solvent for the TIPS pentacene; leading to poor morphology and poor performance.
Based on our FET performance, microscopy and diffraction results, small quantities of processing additives are found to cause positive changes in the TIPS-pentacene crystalline films, effectively modifying anisotropic films. Well-ordered grains are obtained using a small amount of additives, where TIPS-pentacene crystals grow and organize along a uniform direction. This in turn leads to improved performance, however, excessive additive concentrations reduce the TIPS-pentacene crystallinity and grain size, which results in poorer hole mobilities. The fact that the solvent additive only functions when its concentration is significantly less than the TIPS pentacene concentration suggests a fundamentally different mechanism than that which occurs in mixed solvent systems.
Conclusions
TIPS-pentacene FETs processed with the solvent additives DPE and CN at judiciously chosen concentrations show improved device performance, including increased carrier mobilities and considerably more consistent behaviour in comparison to neat TIPS-pentacene FETs. At 0.5% DPE and 0.2% CN, the measured hole mobilities are 0.73 and 0.71 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the corresponding OFETs made from TIPS-pentacene without additives exhibit a μ of 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1. Excessively high concentrations of DPE or CN were found to cause increased contact resistances and result in poor device performance. SEM and optical microscope images reveal large, uniform crystalline domains for films processed with 0.5% DPE or 0.2% CN. Both XRD and UV-Vis absorption results confirm the improved crystallinity under these conditions. In this work, we offer a facile strategy for the improvement of device performance in small molecule based semiconductor devices using solvent additives.
Experimental
The transistor architecture was based on a bottom gate-bottom contact configuration. First, Al of 100 nm was evaporated on a glass substrate and patterned by photolithography to provide gate electrodes. A gate dielectric layer of PVP was next spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 s from propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) on the gate electrode, then annealed for 10 min at 110 °C and subsequently for 20 min at 200 °C yielding a 340 nm thick film. 45 nm thick Au source and drain electrodes were then evaporated onto the PVP layer and patterned by a lift-off process. The channel length (L) and width (W) were 40 and 200 μm, respectively.
TIPS-pentacene was dissolved in anisole (from Aldrich) at a concentration of 3 wt% and processing additives (DPE and CN) were added at various concentrations. The solutions were drop cast onto substrates which were preheated for 30 min prior to deposition. Substrates were preheated at 46 °C for DPE and 60 °C for CN. For devices with 0.25%, and 0.5% DPE, 16 devices were fabricated, while 8 devices were made for the OFETs with 1% DPE. For devices with 0.2%, 0.25%, and 0.5% CN, 28 devices were fabricated.
Transfer and output characteristics were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley SCS-4200). Fabrication and characterization procedures were performed in a class 1000 clean room. The channel length dependence of the total resistance was measured for the pristine TIPS-pentacene and FETs incorporated with various DPE and CN concentrations and contact resistances were derived from total resistance vs. channel length plots.38 Error margins are reported as the standard error of the mean at a 95% (2σ) confidence interval.
SEM was carried out using a JEOL JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscope, while X-ray diffractograms were obtained using a Phillips Panalytical X'pert Pro MRD diffractometer.
