    , Accepted 18th October 2012First published on 18th October 2012AbstractWe report efficient and stable polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) and various fullerene derivatives using solution processed, cost effective molybdenum oxide (s-MoOx) as an anode interfacial layer. The chemical structure of the obtained s-MoOx was characterized by FTIR and XPS. The s-MoOx layer exhibits high light transmittance and effective hole collection properties. The PSCs with the s-MoOx anode buffer layer show enhanced performance in comparison with PEDOT:PSS modified devices. The power conversion efficiency of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA with the s-MoOx anode buffer layer reached 6.57% under an illumination of AM1.5G at 100 mW cm−2. In addition, compared with PEDOT:PSS modified devices, PSCs with the s-MoOx anode buffer layer exhibit a much superior stability and longer lifetime.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are very attractive as a promising solution to energy and environmental issues due to the potential of a low cost roll-to-roll manufacturing process.1–8 The performance in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability for PSCs is rapidly approaching the key 10–10 target (10% efficiency and 10 years of stability).9 The properties of the interface between the electrodes and the active layers can significantly affect the device characteristics such as fill factor (FF), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and open-circuit voltage (Voc) as well as the cell lifetime.10 Therefore, numerous modifications of electrodes by the introduction of an interfacial layer have been studied intensively for high-performance and stable PSCs.5–8 As a promising interfacial layer, several key factors such as transparency, conductivity, morphology, stability, and processability should be considered.10,11
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most commonly used anode interfacial layer for improving anode contact and increasing hole collection in organic electronics. However, highly acidic PEDOT:PSS can etch an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, resulting in poor long-term stability.12 To solve these problems, inorganic materials such as V2O5 and MoO3 were developed by vacuum deposition to replace PEDOT:PSS.13 However, expensive vacuum techniques are incompatible with the concept of low-cost, solution-processable and roll-to-roll fabricated PSCs. Therefore, there is urgent demand for the development of cost-efficient and simply processed interfacial materials.
For this purpose, solution-processed molybdenum oxide has drawn great attention as an interfacial layer for high-performance PSCs,14–22 owing to its relatively good hole mobility, environmental stability, and transparency in the range of visible light. Recently, Meyer reported on MoO3 films spin-coated from a suspension of MoO3 nanoparticles,14 in which the aggregation of nanoparticles lead to excessive film roughness and significantly thicker films were required to prevent leakage in devices. Girotto et al. and Yang et al. developed solution-processed MoO3 as a hole injection layer using the sol–gel technique.15,16 However, this process requires relatively high temperatures (higher than 250 °C) to crystallize the MoO3 film, rendering it incompatible with polymer substrates for future roll-to-roll manufacturing. Hammond et al. reported using Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3 as a precursor for fabricating continuous MoOx.17 However, the obtained MoOx requires O2 plasma treatment, and the precursor is oxygen-sensitive. It's incompatible with high throughput and scale-up technologies in an ambient atmosphere. Liu et al. reported using ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24) as a precursor to prepare an MoO3 thin film.18 However, the resulting MoO3 consists of islands of big MoO3 crystals instead of a smooth thin film. Murase and Yang modified the synthesis procedure with the same precursor and obtained a continuous MoO3 thin film with a low annealing temperature.19 Bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum(VI) dioxide (MoO2(acac)2) is another promising precursor for preparing MoOx.20 Very recently, Zilberberg et al. and Jasieniak et al. reported sol–gel processed MoOx from this precursor for PSCs application.21,22 However, the obtained MoOx layer must be maintained at ambient conditions in air for a long time to hydrolyse or age the sol–gel solution for a couple of days. These procedures are time-consuming and incompatible with high throughput and scale-up technologies.
In this study, we report a very simple and time-saving procedure to prepare a continuous and uniform molybdenum oxide layer. The molybdenum oxide film was prepared by spin-coating MoO2(acac)2 isopropanol solution on pre-cleaned ITO glass, and then baking in air at 150 °C for 10 min to complete the transformation into MoO3 (named s-MoOx). Obviously, the preparation procedure of the s-MoOx layer is extremely simple and cost-effective, employing a cheap and commercially available precursor, isopropanol as a solvent and a low temperature process under ambient conditions, in which no additional sol–gel synthesis is needed. The obtained s-MoOx layer is highly transparent in the visible range and exhibits effective hole collection properties. To investigate the general suitability of the s-MoOx buffer layer in PSCs, standard poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was selected as an electron donor and three soluble fullerene derivatives, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM), indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA), and indene-C70 bisadduct (IC70BA), were selected as electron acceptors to fabricate the PSCs.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co., Ltd (China). Bis(2,4-pentanedionato)molybdenum(VI) dioxide (MoO2(acac)2) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. P3HT was purchased from Rieke Metals. PC60BM was purchased from Nano-C. IC60BA23 and IC70BA24 were synthesized according to the literature. PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark company. All these commercially available materials were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Instrumentation
The transmittance spectra of the ITO, ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO/s-MoOx were measured by a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The PEDOT:PSS film was prepared by spin-coating (2000 rpm) PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on pre-cleaned ITO glass. The s-MoOx film was prepared by spin-coating (4000 rpm) MoO2(acac)2 isopropanol solution (5 mg mL−1) on pre-cleaned ITO glass. Both the PEDOT:PSS and the s-MoOx films were baked in air at 150 °C for 10 min. FTIR studies were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer. The surface morphologies and phase changes of the modification layer on the ITO and the active layers were analyzed using a VEECO DICP-II atomic force microscope (AFM) operated in the tapping mode under ambient conditions at room temperature. XPS data were obtained with an ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300W Al Kα radiation. The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. XRD patterns were obtained with a Siemens D5005 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 20 mA. The thickness of the film involved in the device was measured by an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer.
2.3. Device fabrication
Seven types (devices A–G) of PSCs were designed. The device structures were: (A) ITO/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (B) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (C) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (D) ITO/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al, (E) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al, (F) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al, and (G) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:IC70BA/Ca/Al. The ITO glass was cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The pre-cleaned ITO substrate was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Ultraviolet Ozone Cleaner, Jelight Company, USA) for 20 min. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS was around 30 nm. The s-MoOx film was prepared by spin-coating (4000 rpm) MoO2(acac)2 isopropanol solution (5 mg mL−1) on the pre-cleaned ITO glass, and then baking in air at 150 °C for 10 min to complete the transformation into s-MoOx. Subsequently, the substrate was transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove-box and the photoactive blend layer was prepared by spin coating (800 rpm) a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT and a fullerene derivative (PC60BM, IC60BA, or IC70BA) (1:1 w/w, polymer concentration 20 mg mL−1) on the modified ITO electrode for 30 s, then drying in covered glass Petri dishes for slow growth of the active layer. The thickness of the active layer was around 240 nm. Finally, the substrate was transferred to a vacuum chamber and 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al were thermally deposited on the photoactive layer under a base pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa. The active area of the device was ca. 4 mm2.
2.4. Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit (SMU). Device characterization was done in a glove-box under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a xenon-lamp-based solar simulator (from Newport Co., Ltd). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and 500W xenon lamp. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The IPCE measurements were performed under ambient conditions at room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical components of s-MoOx
The chemical changes in the MoO2(acac)2 films that occurred during thermal annealing were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, shown in Fig. 1. For the as-prepared MoO2(acac)2 without annealing, the existence of a split band at 940 cm−1 and 904 cm−1 is observed. This spectral region is characteristic of MoO bonds, and the split band indicates the existence of cis MoO bonding.25 The broad band around 3430 and 1182 cm−1 as well as the strong peak at 800 cm−1 are attributed to C–H vibrations. The IR peaks at 2923, 1413, and 1020 cm−1 are attributed to the vibration of –CH3 in the acetylacetonate ring. The high intensity peaks at 1585 and 1506 cm−1 are assigned to stretching vibrations of delocalized CO in acetylacetonate rings. The high intensity IR absorptions at 1361 and 1265 cm−1 are the stretching vibrations of delocalized C–CC in the acetylacetonate ring. The peaks at 574, 549 and 412 cm−1 are attributed to the deformation vibrations of the acetylacetonate ring. The peaks at 673 and 455 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of Mo–O. The IR spectra of MoO2(acac)2 observed in our study is in good agreement with that reported in the literature.22,25,26 Compared with the unannealed sample, the IR peaks of the sample after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min are dramatically different to those of the unannealed sample, in which the characteristic peaks of the acetylacetonate ring are very weak and nearly invisible, indicating the decomposition of MoO2(acac)2 into molybdenum oxide. Our findings are in accordance with previous studies.21,22

Further evidence for the purity and composition of the molybdenum oxide film was obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as shown in Fig. 2. The binding energies (BE) obtained in the XPS analysis are corrected for specimen charge by referencing the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the survey scan performed in the 0–1000 eV BE range shows characteristic peaks of the elements Mo, O, and C. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the XPS spectrum of the core level of Mo(3d) for the unannealed sample has a strong spin–orbit doublet due to Mo 3d5/2 at 232.9 eV and Mo 3d3/2 at 236.0 eV.25,26 The XPS spectrum is constrained by the Mo 3d5/2–Mo 3d3/2 spin–orbit separation being 3.1 eV, and the area ratio of the two peaks of each doublet being 3:2. These features are characteristic of Mo6+ ions in MoO2(acac)2.25,26 In the XPS spectrum of the annealed sample, the peaks corresponding to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 are unchanged at 232.9 eV and 236.0 eV, respectively, with an Mo 3d5/2–Mo 3d3/2 spin–orbit separation of 3.1 eV and an intensity ratio of 3:2. The results indicate that the molybdenum in the annealed sample is in the Mo6+ oxidation state.25,26 The O 1s XPS spectra for the unannealed and annealed samples are shown in Fig. 2(c). For the unannealed sample, the O 1s spectrum is resolved into two peaks at 531.2 eV, corresponding to the oxygen bonded with molybdenum,27 and at 532.9 eV, corresponding to the oxygen in the acetylacetonic ligand cycle.28 While for the annealed sample, there is just one high intensity peak at a binding energy of about 531.1 eV, which can be assigned to the oxygen atoms in stoichiometric MoO3.25,26 The results from the XPS investigation further confirm the decomposition of MoO2(acac)2 into MoO3.

3.2. Structure design of the PSCs
The obtained s-MoOx layer is highly transparent in the visible range as shown in Fig. 3, and this will be of benefit for light harvesting. The s-MoOx layer has an amorphous structure as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as shown in the inset of Fig. 3. The sandwiched structure of ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:fullerene/Ca/Al is employed in the fabrication of the PSCs, with ITO as the positive electrode, s-MoOx as the interfacial buffer layer, P3HT:fullerene blends as the photoactive layer, and Ca/Al as the negative electrode. To investigate the general suitability of the s-MoOx buffer layer in PSCs, we selected three soluble fullerene derivatives, PC60BM, IC60BA, and IC70BA as electron acceptors. The device structure is shown in Fig. 4(a), and the molecular structures of the P3HT, the fullerene derivatives, and the MoO2(acac)2 precursor are shown in Fig. 4(b).

The energy levels of the materials involved in the PSCs are given in Fig. 4(c). The electronic energy levels of s-MoOx,22 P3HT,29 PC60BM,23 IC60BA23 and IC70BA24 were taken from the literature. When light irradiates the photoactive layer of the PSCs through ITO glass, the photoactive layer will absorb photons to produce excitons, and the excitons will diffuse towards and dissociate at the P3HT–fullerene interface resulting in electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor and holes in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor P3HT. Meanwhile, it can be predicted that the s-MoOx layer will strongly extract holes from the P3HT layer due to the high work function of s-MoOx (4.9 eV).22 Because of the band bending at the s-MoOx–P3HT interface, the hole collection process should be very efficient.22
3.3. Morphology of the thin films
The tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) image at a 5 μm × 5 μm scan size of the bare ITO is illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The root mean square (rms) roughness of the ITO surface is 4.8 nm. After modification with the s-MoOx layer, the surface become flatter and the rms roughness decreases to 1.9 nm (as shown in Fig. 5(b)), which is comparable with that (1.8 nm) of the PEDOT:PSS modified ITO substrate. Fig. 5(c) shows the AFM height image of the surface of the P3HT:PC60BM active layer on the s-MoOx modified ITO substrate with an rms roughness of 8.5 nm. While the rms roughness of the P3HT:IC60BA active layer on the s-MoOx modified ITO substrate is only 7.5 nm (shown in Fig. 5(e)). It can be seen that the photoactive layer (P3HT:PC60BM or P3HT:IC60BA) has a much greater roughness than that of the substrate, whether the substrate was modified with s-MoOx or not. The increase in roughness is attributed to P3HT self-organization and phase separation of the blend (as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (f)). P3HT chains self-organizing into an ordered structure can significantly enhance the hole mobility. Meanwhile, the aggregation of fullerene molecules can form separate paths for electron transport.30 The nanoscale phase separation can finally result in the enhancement of Jsc of the PSCs.30

The scan size is 5 μm × 5 μm. 
3.4. Effect of the s-MoOx buffer layer on the performance of the PSCs
To investigate the effect of the s-MoOx buffer layer on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, we selected three soluble fullerene derivatives and constructed seven types of device structures: (A) ITO/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (B) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (C) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:PC60BM/Ca/Al, (D) ITO/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al, (E) ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al, (F) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:IC60BA/Ca/Al and (G) ITO/s-MoOx/P3HT:IC70BA/Ca/Al. Devices A and D are control samples without a buffer layer, devices B and E are control samples with a PEDOT:PSS layer. The device structures are summarized in Table 1.

Fig. 6(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices in the dark, and the rectification ratio of the devices was calculated based on the J–V curves at ±1.0 V. For devices A and D without the buffer layer, the rectification ratio is 1.9 × 102 and 2.6 × 102, respectively. While that of devices C and F with the s-MoOx buffer layer reached 4.5 × 104 and 1.0 × 104, respectively, two orders of magnitude higher than those of the devices without the buffer layer. These values are also higher than those of devices B and E with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (7.9 × 103 and 5.6 × 103 for device B and device E, respectively). The higher rectification ratio of the s-MoOx modified devices could result from the higher injection current at the positive voltage and lower leakage current at the negative voltage.5–8,11

J–V curves of devices A–G under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6(b) and the device performance parameters (average of 16 devices) are summarized in Table 1. For device A without buffer layer, it shows a PCE of 2.16% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.48 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.40 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 56.9%. In contrast, the four parameters, Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, of device C with the s-MoOx buffer layer are all increased to 0.58 V, 11.16 mA cm−2, 66.8%, and 4.32% (the PCE is double that of device A), respectively. In comparison with the PEDOT:PSS modified device B, the Voc is almost unchanged, while the Jsc and the FF are all increased, resulting in an overall increase in the PCE of 15%.
As for the PSCs with IC60BA or IC70BA as the acceptor, device D without the buffer layer has a PCE of 4.41%, a Jsc of 9.66 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V, and an FF of 55.4%. As expected, device F and device G with the s-MoOx buffer layer have dramatically enhanced performances. The Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for device F are 0.85 V, 10.43 mA cm−2, 72.1%, and 6.29%, respectively, and those for device G are 0.84 V, 11.09 mA cm−2, 70.5%, and 6.57%, respectively. These values are among the best among the P3HT-based PSCs. In comparison with device E with the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (the Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE are 0.85 V, 9.52 mA cm−2, 74.9%, and 6.06%, respectively), the Voc is almost unchanged and the FF has changed just a little, while the Jsc has increased significantly and the overall PCE is improved. The increased Jsc of the s-MoOx modified devices could be ascribed to the improved hole mobility of s-MoOx and enhanced charge collection at the s-MoOx–P3HT interface (Fig. 4(c)).21,22
Comparing the devices with or without the s-MoOx interfacial layer, the Voc for the P3HT/PCBM based devices changed a lot (0.4 vs. 0.59 V), while for the device based on P3HT/ICBA, the Voc difference is very small. This could be due to the fact that the maximum Voc ((Voc)max) in bulk heterojunction PSCs depends on the characteristics of the organic–metal contacts.31 In the case of non-ohmic contacts, which follow the metal–insulator–metal model, (Voc)max is given by the difference between the work functions of the anode and the cathode. While for devices with ohmic contacts, (Voc)max is governed by the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor. For the P3HT/PCBM based devices in our research, device A without the interfacial layer shows a low Voc of 0.40 V, indicating non-ohmic contact between the photoactive layer and the ITO interface. Inserting a thin s-MoOx layer in device C can not only build an ohmic contact (increase Voc), but also decrease the charge recombination at the interface (increase Jsc). For the P3HT/ICBA based devices, the ICBA acceptor probably helps to improve the ohmic contact between the active layer and ITO electrode in device D without the anode buffer layer. The main effect of the s-MoOx buffer layer in devices F and G is to decrease the interface charge recombination (improve Jsc). Therefore, the influence of the anode buffer layer on the Voc is small for the devices based on P3HT/ICBA.
We compare the incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices A–G in Fig. 6(c). The IPCE results agree well with the Jsc of the PSCs mentioned above. The higher IPCEs of the devices with the s-MoOx buffer layer could also be ascribed to the enhanced transmittance of the ITO/s-MoO3 (as shown in Fig. 3) and the suitable aggregated morphology of the active layer as shown in Fig. 5.
3.5. Stability of the PSCs
The long term stability of nonencapsulated PSCs with s-MoOx and PEDOT:PSS interfacial layers were investigated by testing the degradation of the characteristic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) with time in a nitrogen filled glove-box as shown in Fig. 7. After 840 hours (35 days), the PCEs of the PEDOT:PSS modified devices stored under N2 drop to about 88% of the initial PCEs. The observed decrease in the PCE is mainly due to a deterioration of both Jsc and FF, with an almost unchanged Voc. In agreement with our observation, in a recent study the degradation of PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS was found to occur even under an inert atmosphere, due to residual moisture in the PEDOT:PSS, which causes corrosion of the cathode layer.32 A similar mechanism may be responsible for the decay of our PEDOT:PSS based devices in an inert atmosphere. On the contrary, the devices with s-MoOx were found to show dramatically improved stabilities and after 35 days retained 94% of their initial PCEs under N2. This is in excellent agreement with the stability of PSCs using thermally evaporated and solution processed MoO3 layers reported previously.21,33 These results indicate that the s-MoOx interfacial layer can effectively improve the long term stability of PSCs.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate efficient and stable polymer solar cells using solution-processed molybdenum oxide (s-MoOx) as an anode interfacial buffer layer. The s-MoOx layer can be easily obtained from a MoO2(acac)2 precursor with thermal annealing. The s-MoOx layer exhibits high hole mobility and high light transmittance. The PSCs with the s-MoOx anode buffer layer show enhanced performance in comparison with the PEDOT:PSS modified devices no matter which fullerene derivative is used as the acceptor. The PCE of the PSC based on P3HT:IC70BA with the s-MoOx anode buffer layer reached 6.57% under illumination by AM1.5G light at 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best values for P3HT-based PSCs. In addition, compared with the PEDOT:PSS modified devices, PSCs with the s-MoOx layer exhibit better long term stabilities. These results demonstrate that the s-MoOx layer obtained from our approach is a promising interfacial material and a strong candidate to replace conventional PEDOT:PSS for producing high-efficiency and high-stability solar cells.
