    , Accepted 30th June 2011First published on 8th August 2011AbstractA new redox flow battery using Fe2+/Fe3+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples in chloride-supporting electrolyte was proposed and investigated for potential stationary energy storage applications. The Fe/V redox flow cell using mixed reactant solutions operated within a voltage window of 0.5–1.35 V with a nearly 100% utilization ratio and demonstrated stable cycling with energy efficiency around 80% at room temperature. Stable performance was also achieved in the temperature range between 0 °C and 50 °C. The improved stability and electrochemical activity over a broader temperature range over the current technologies (such as Fe/Cr redox chemistry) potentially eliminate the necessity of external heat management and use of catalysts, making the Fe/V redox flow battery a promising option as a stationary energy storage device to enable renewable integration and stabilization of the electrical grid.

Broader context
A redox flow battery (RFB) is a type of reversible energy storage system which converts the chemical energy to electrical energy while the electrolyte containing dissolved electroactive species is circulating through the electrochemical cell. RFBs are considered among the most promising technologies for up to multi-megawatt levels of renewable and grid energy storage. However the current technologies cannot meet the performance and cost requirement matrices for broad market penetration. For example, the all vanadium sulfate flow battery (VRB) is concerned with limited operation temperature windows, high V5+ corrosiveness, and a relative high cost. In comparison, the Fe/Cr flow battery uses relative low cost elements, yet the active heat management, catalyst enhanced electrode, and gas balance system are required due to the inferior electrochemical activity and low redox reaction potential of the Cr2+/Cr3+. We propose and investigate a new RFB system utilizing Fe2+/Fe3+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples in chloride supporting electrolyte aiming to combine the advantages of the Fe/Cr and VRB systems and avoid their drawbacks. Experimental tests have achieved stable cycling with an energy efficiency of ∼80% at room temperature and a comparable performance in the temperature range from 0 to 50 °C making it a promising candidate for electrical energy storage.

1. Introduction
With the growing concerns of environmental consequences and ecological sustainability over the consumption of fossil fuels, there has been increasing interest in renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar. However, the varied nature of the power from the intermittent renewable sources makes it quite challenging for its use and dispatch through the aging grid. One effective way to smooth out the intermittency is to use electrical energy storage. Among the most promising technologies are the redox flow batteries (RFBs) that are capable of storing a large power or energy (up to multi-MW and MWh, respectively) in a pair of reduced and oxidized species dissolving in two separate liquid electrolytes. The conversion between the electrical energy and chemical (or electrochemical) potential occurs as the electrolytes are flowing through electrodes. Between the electrodes is an ionic conducting membrane or separator that allows the transport of selective species in a cell. As such, the energy and power can be designed separately. Storage of energy in flow liquid electrolytes, instead of electrodes in conventional batteries such as Li-ion batteries, also makes RFBs cycle without incurring mechanical or structural stress in their electrodes. With improved thermal management, the flowing electrolytes carry away the heat generated during operations, resulting in improved safety.
The first true redox flow battery was invented in 1975 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.1 NASA used the Fe2+/Fe3+halide solution electrolyte at the cathode-side (positive electrolyte) and the Cr2+/Cr3+halide solution electrolyte at the anode-side (negative electrolyte). The early redox flow batteries suffered from cross-contamination that was later minimized by employing a mixed electrolyte at both the anode- and cathode-side.2 An alternative approach to overcome the cross-contamination issue was to use the same element, such as vanadium, in both negative electrolyte and positive electrolyte. The all-vanadium flow batteries (VRBs) with a V3+/V2+sulfate solution as the negative electrolyte and V5+/V4+sulfate solution as the positive electrolyte were developed and demonstrated by Maria Skyllas-Kazacos in the mid 1980s at the University of New South Wales.3–6 In addition, a number of other redox chemistries were reported, including V2+/V3+vs.Br−/ClBr2,7–9Br2/Br−vs. S/S2−,10,11Br−/Br2vs.Zn2+/Zn,12,13Ce4+/Ce3+vs.V2+/V3+,14Fe3+/Fe2+vs.Br2/Br−,15Mn2+/Mn3+vs.Br2/Br−,16Fe3+/Fe2+vs. Ti2+/Ti4+,17etc.18
While significant progress was made in advancing RFBs, challenges remain to fully meet the performance and cost-requirement matrices for broad market penetration. For example, the low electrochemical activity of the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox reaction demands catalyst loading on the electrode. The Fe/Cr system usually operates at elevated temperatures (∼65 °C) with an active heat management system to further facilitate the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox reactions, resulting in significant parasitic energy loss,19 complexity of the system, and cost increase. On the other hand, the low-potential (−0.41 V) of the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox reaction is often accompanied with hydrogen evolution during charging, limiting fuel use (∼60%), and lowering the coulombic efficiency. An H2 rebalance cell is required to manage the gas evolution. In comparison, VRBs were demonstrated with excellent electrochemical activity and reversibility along with much mitigated cross-transport. However, the V5+ species in the positive electrolyte solution tends to precipitate out as solid V2O5 at elevated temperatures, and V2+ in the negative electrolyte precipitates to VSO4 at lower temperatures, limiting the VRB operational temperature windows to only 10–40 °C at a V concentration of 1.6 M or higher. Besides, the high-oxidation reactivity of V5+ species in positive electrolyte solution limits the material choices for a membrane. Although promising progress has been made in the development of non-Nafion membranes, the high oxidation ability of V5+ still remains a concern for VRB systems.
In our work, we proposed and investigated the electrochemical performance of a new redox flow battery that employs a V2+/V3+ chloride solution as the negative electrolyte and a Fe2+/Fe3+ chloride solution as the positive electrolyte. A standard voltage of 1.02 V can be obtained through the following redox electrode and cell reactions: (1) (2) (3)The Fe/V system was intended to make use of benefits from both Fe/Cr and all vanadium systems while circumventing their intrinsic issues. Compared with the Cr2+/Cr3+ redox reaction, the V2+/V3+ pair possesses a much better electrochemical activity, which would free the system from using the catalyst and the high-temperature management system. Moreover, the evolution of H2 gas during charging can be curtailed since the working potential of V2+/V3+ (−0.25 V) is considerably higher than that of Cr2+/Cr3+ (−0.41 V). On the positive side, the V4+/V5+ is replaced with the less oxidative and electrochemically reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple. Thus, the Fe/V system was expected to demonstrate an improved stability at elevated temperatures and also offers the flexibility to use low-cost materials to make components such as membranes. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed flow battery, the Fe/V redox couples in chloride-supporting electrolytes were investigated for electrochemical properties, temperature stability, and performance. This paper reports the details of the work.
2. Experimental
The electrolyte for the Fe/V redox flow battery test was prepared by dissolving VCl3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and FeCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in concentrated HCl (Sigma-Aldrich, 38%). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in an Fe/V + HCl solution with various concentrations to identify redox couples and electrochemical reversibility using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat (Solartron Analytical, USA). A graphite felt strip and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A graphite felt disk (ϕ = 5.5 mm) was sealed onto a metal current collector with a polymer gel and was used as the working electrode. The fabrication of the graphite felt working electrode is engineered in such a way that the metal current collector is fully covered by the polymer film to prevent it from contacting the solution during the CV test. The scan rate was 0.5 mV s−1. The identical graphite felts without catalysts were used in both CV and flow cell testing.
The cell performance was measured under a constant current using an in-house-designed flow cell system that was connected with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Arbin Inst., College Station, TX). Details of the flow cell setup were described in a previous paper.20 The apparent area (i.e., the area in contact with the membrane) of the graphite felt was 10 cm2 (2 cm × 5 cm). Cells with (2 M Fe, 3 M HCl) positive electrolyte and (2 M V, 3 M HCl) negative electrolyte were tested and compared with cells that used 1.25 M Fe/V in 2.3 M HCl mixed solution as both the positive electrolyte and the negative electrolyte. Nafion membrane was used in the tests. An electrolyte volume of 50 mL in each half-cell and a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 were used during the tests. The flow cell was charged to 1.35 V and then discharged to 0.5 V at a current density of 50 mA cm−2. The composition of the electrolytes after cycling was determined by inductively coupled plasma/atomic emission spectrometry (ICP/AES, Optima 7300DV, Perkin Elmer) techniques after appropriate dilution. Three emission lines were chosen for each element as a crosscheck for spectral interference. The calibration standards were matrix-matched in water. The detection limit of the ICP instrument is 10−3 mg L−1.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the electrochemical performance of an Fe/V redox flow cell using (2 M Fe, 3 M HCl) positive electrolyte and (2 MV, 3 M HCl) negative electrolyte. The charge/discharge voltage curves with respect to the cell capacity are shown in Fig. 1(a). The cell demonstrated columbic efficiency, voltage efficiency, and energy efficiency at ∼93%, ∼85%, and ∼80%, respectively, at room temperature [see Fig. 1(b)]. A stable performance with the aforementioned efficiencies was achieved over 100 cycles. However, drastic capacity fading was observed over cycling, which is also shown in Fig. 1(b). The rapid fading in the cell capacity was caused by the crossover of the Fe/V ions through the membrane during repetitive charge/discharge processes, which also caused a loss in columbic efficiency throughout the cycling. The diffusion of the Fe and V ions gradually reduced the active materials accessible for oxidation and the reduction reaction leading to the drastic capacity drop. This was confirmed by the ICP analyses on the positive electrolyte and negative electrolyte solutions after cycling, indicating an increase of ∼0.006 M V in the positive electrolyte and ∼0.004 M Fe in the negative electrolyte per cycle over the 100 cycles.

(b) Cyclic Coulombic efficiency, voltage efficiency, energy efficiency, and charge/discharge capacity as a function of cycle number. 
To avoid the crossover contamination, mixed reactant solutions were employed as both negative electrolyte and positive electrolyte. Fig. 2 shows the CV results of 1.5 M Fe and 1.5 M V mixed reactant in the supporting electrolyte of 1 M hydrochloric acid solution using graphite felt electrodes. The current density was normalized to the geometrical area of the working electrode. Similar CV spectra were also observed on the glassy carbon electrode. Two pairs of redox reaction peaks were observed, corresponding to eqn (1) at the positive side and eqn (2) at the negative side, respectively. The formal potentials for each half-reaction were calculated by averaging the oxidation and reduction peak potentials. Based on one-electron disproportionation of V and Fe ions, the CV results indicate that the RFB system using Fe2+/Fe3+vs.V2+/V3+ redox couples would yield a 0.94 V equilibrium cell potential. Importantly, hydrogen evolution peak was not observed within the range of −0.8 to 0.8 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). Given the Fe/V cells are typically operated with a voltage window of <1.0 V, the gassing at the V2+/V3+ negative electrode during the charging process should be significantly mitigated or prevented at reasonable specific currents. This validates one of the advantages expected of the Fe/V system over the Fe/Cr system as previously discussed. On the other hand, oxidation and reduction peaks appear in the forward and reverse scans on the positive side, which revealed a reversible redox couple of Fe3+/Fe2+ with a potential at approximately 0.5 V (vs.Ag/AgCl). Similarly, there was no anodic peaks observed that corresponded to the evolution of the Cl2 and/or O2 gas. Evidently, the Fe3+/Fe2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples in chloride-supporting electrolyte showed an adequate reversibility to be used as the negative electrolyte and positive electrolyte for the proposed redox flow battery system.

Multiple Fe/V flow test cells were thus set up to further evaluate the performance and cycling behaviors. Fig. 3 shows the electrochemical cycling results of a flow cell that used a Nafion 117 membrane. A typical plot of cell voltage versus time is given in Fig. 3(a). Fig. 3(b) is the cell voltage profile with respect to the cell capacity and the cell state of charge (SOC). The SOC was calculated against the maximum charge capacity. From Fig. 3(b), it is evident that the Fe/V redox flow cell was capable of charging and discharging with an SOC in the range of 0–100%. A utilization ratio of close to 100% was thus achieved in a single cell. The high utilization was attributed to the fact that the Fe/V redox flow battery system was free from hydrogen evolution, as indicated by the CV study and the flow cell voltage profile. Eliminating the gas evolution also simplifies the cell stack systems, leading to a lower capital cost. In comparison, the utilization ratio of the Fe/Cr redox flow battery system is usually limited to ∼60% because of the hydrogen evolution. The Fe/V cell demonstrated a stable higher columbic efficiency of ∼97% than that of the separate reactant system, a voltage efficiency of ∼80%, and thus an energy efficiency of ∼78% [see Fig. 3(c)] at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 during the 50 cycle tests. The Fe/V cell also showed an excellent capability to retain its capacity and energy density [see Fig. 3(d)] with 0.1% loss per cycle in charge capacity over 50 cycles, which is about 5 times lower than that of the all-vanadium flow battery using the same test protocol and Nafion 117 as the membrane.20 The capacity retention performance over extended cycling of the Fe/Cr flow battery is rarely reported in the literature. However, in one NASA report,2 the electrolyte had to be rebalanced 3 times within 70 cycles to maintain the performance, indicating a rather high capacity fading. The significant improvement in the capacity retention of the Fe/V flow battery will enable the system to operate with minimal maintenance of electrolyte rebalance.

The stability of the RFB systems with the temperature variance is of primary importance in practical use. In this regard, active thermal management systems are required for both VRB and Fe/Cr flow battery systems. For a conventional VRB sulfate system, an active thermal management system is employed to maintain the system temperature between 10 and 40 °C to prevent precipitation of V5+ at higher temperatures and V2+ and V4+ at lower temperatures21,22 In contrast, the Fe/Cr flow battery systems are usually operating at ∼65 °C to maintain adequate electrochemical activity at the negative electrode. The active thermal management system not only is costly, but also causes significant parasitic energy loss.19 The thermal stability of the Fe/V system was therefore evaluated. An Fe/V redox flow battery with 1.25 M Fe/V in 2.3 M HCl solution as both positive electrolyte and negative electrolyte was placed inside a temperature-controlled environment chamber. The cycling test was then carried out at 0, 5, and 50 °C. The flow battery was cycled at each temperature over ∼20 cycles (roughly 10 days). The electrolyte reservoirs were periodically examined, and no precipitation was found. Fig. 4 shows the cycling performance of an Fe/V redox flow battery at different temperatures with the mixed solution as both positive electrolyte and negative electrolyte. Compared with the room temperature operation, a higher energy efficiency of ∼83% was obtained at 50 °C. Similarly, a higher capacity fading rate of ∼0.4% was also observed because of the increased crossover, which was also corroborated by the lower columbic efficiency of ∼93%. But the increased voltage efficiency due to enhanced electrode reactions and reduced polarization at the elevated temperature compensated the loss in the columbic efficiency for an overall improved energy efficiency. As the temperature decreased, the system demonstrated lower energy efficiencies of ∼72% at 5 °C and ∼70% at 0 °C because of the more sluggish reaction and the increased solution impedance with the electrolyte at lower temperatures. On the other hand, at lower temperatures, the reactant crossover was reduced, enabling the system to deliver higher columbic efficiencies of ∼97% at 5 °C and ∼98% at 0 °C. Corresponding to this, the capacity fading rate was lowered to ∼0.1% at both 5 °C and 0 °C. The thermal stability of the electrolyte from each half-cell at the SOC state of 0 and 100% is tested at temperatures of 0 and 50 °C, respectively. The temperature stability test results are summarized in Table 1. No precipitation was observed in the electrolyte over 10 days in the designated temperature range, indicating an excellent thermal stability of the electrolyte. Given the generation of waste heat and the subsequent system heating during operation, RFBs are more concerned with and limited by the stability of electrolytes during high-temperature operations. Extension of operational temperatures from 10–40 °C to 0–50 °C would enable the Fe/V flow battery systems to be deployed in most areas in the world without the need of active heat management, leading to overall improved energy storage efficiency and reduced cost.

In addition to the Nafion membrane, commercially available low-cost alternatives were evaluated for potential use as a membrane or separator in the Fe/V redox batteries. Preliminary results have shown that a low-cost hydrocarbon membrane [sulfonated poly(phenylsufone) (S-Radel®) membrane] achieved satisfactory performance over 100 cycles on a test condition identical to that of a Nafion membrane. The investigation and optimization of the alternative membranes are currently under way, and the results will be reported in future publications.
At room temperature, the proposed Fe/V redox flow battery system with excellent cycling stability delivered a similar energy efficiency to that of the Fe/Cr redox flow battery operating at 65 °C with a catalyst loaded electrode and a hydrogen gas rebalance system. Moreover, the Fe/V system possesses advantages in performance and cost-effectiveness. The intrinsic electrochemical properties of the Fe/V redox couple unleash the system from using external heat-management devices, expensive catalysts, and complicated gas managing balance of plant. Vanadium sources used in the Fe/V system can and should be reclaimed and recycled to further reduce the system cost. Compared with the VRB system, the leniency of the Fe3+ compared with V5+ not only increases the possibility to construct the system with cost-effective materials, but also mitigates graphite felt corrosion. For example, the possible substitution of a Nafion membrane with a low-cost membrane significantly reduces the system cost because a membrane costs about 40% of the cell stack cost according to an Electric Power Research Institute report.19 Moreover, the excellent capacity retention over long cycling reduces the need for electrolyte rebalancing compared to the VRB system, and thus, the system only requires low operational maintenance. Free from the gas evolution issue, the Fe/V redox flow single cell demonstrated a near 100% utilization ratio, which will benefit the flow battery system design and integration, leading to a higher efficiency than that of the Fe/Cr and VRB systems.
The major challenge of the Fe/V redox flow battery is its energy density, which is slightly lower than that of the Fe/Cr system due to a lower cell voltage. That, however, can be compensated for by increasing the reactant concentration in the negative electrolyte and positive electrolyte. Previous studies with a supporting electrolyte of hydrochloric acid have shown that V2+/V3+ ion concentrations as high as 4 M can be achieved in the chloride systems.8 The main hurdle is that the Fe2+/Fe3+ ions have a low solubility in hydrochloric acid. Preliminary research on the solubility of Fe2+/Fe3+ ions in a modified chloride-base electrolyte has shown very encouraging results and will be published subsequently. The energy density of the Fe/V system is expected to be improved with further optimization, making it a promising electrochemical device for stationary energy storage.
4. Conclusions
A novel redox flow battery based on Fe2+/Fe3+vs.V2+/V3+ redox couples in halide solution electrolytes was successfully demonstrated in a laboratory-scale flow cell. With 1.25 M Fe and 1.25 M V in 2.3 M chloride acid solution, the redox flow cell achieved an energy efficiency of ∼80% and a sustained relatively low capacity fading over 50 cycles when employing Nafion 117 as the membrane. The electrochemical cycling that was performed at different temperatures suggested that the Fe/V flow battery can be operated in the temperature window between 0 °C and 50 °C.

In comparison, the Fe/Cr flow battery uses relative low cost elements, yet the active heat management, catalyst enhanced electrode, and gas balance system are required due to the inferior electrochemical activity and low redox reaction potential of the Cr2+/Cr3+. We propose and investigate a new RFB system utilizing Fe2+/Fe3+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples in chloride supporting electrolyte aiming to combine the advantages of the Fe/Cr and VRB systems and avoid their drawbacks. Experimental tests have achieved stable cycling with an energy efficiency of ∼80% at room temperature and a comparable performance in the temperature range from 0 to 50 °C making it a promising candidate for electrical energy storage.
