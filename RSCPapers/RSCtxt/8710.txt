    , Accepted 5th January 2017First published on 5th January 2017AbstractPaper-like electrodes with high conductivity and flexibility hold great potential for assembling high-performance flexible electronic devices. In this study, a flexible conductive film was fabricated via vacuum filtration using highly conductive MoO3−x ultralong nanobelts. This film has low sheet resistance of 5.1 Ω sq−1 and exhibits a stable three-dimensional structure even under 1000 times of bending test. Significantly, this free-standing film has a high volumetric capacitance of 652 F cm−3. Moreover, a symmetric device based on this electrode demonstrates good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 85.7% after 25000 cycles. We anticipate that this strategy can also be applied to other three-dimensional flexible porous films based on one-dimensional conductive nanostructure, which could open up new opportunities for energy storage and conversion.
Introduction
The ever-increasing consumption of flexible/wearable electronics promotes rapid development of high-performance flexible power sources.1–6 Paper-based energy storage, due to its low-cost and environmentally-friendly nature, attracts extensive research interest in solar cells,7 Li-ion batteries,8 metal-air batteries,9 and supercapacitors.10 Traditional paper, which is made via the dewatering of a dilute suspension of cellulose fibers and a filtration process followed by pressing and heating, has a porous network structure with interconnected hydrophilic cellulose fibers.11 Inspired by this ancient papermaking technique, various paper-like electrodes, such as graphene nanopaper, carbon nanotube (CNT) nanopaper, and MXene nanopaper, were successfully fabricated.12–15 These electrodes increase the total volumetric capacitance by eliminating the occupancy of cellulose fibers, which have no contribution to energy storage. However, these nanopapers have the disadvantages of either sluggish ion diffusion (2D-based materials nanopaper) or low-specific energy storage issues (CNT-based nanopapers). To address these limitations, developing porous paper-like electrodes with high conductivity and specific capacitance materials is necessary.
Metal oxides are a class of widely used energy storage materials due to their high specific theoretical capacitance, rich electrochemical properties, and controllable preparation.16–19 However, their relatively low conductivity impedes their further application in many fields.20,21 For example, molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is regarded to be a promising candidate for energy storage and has been extensively studied over the past decades.22,23 However, most of the previous studies have reported that MoO3 electrode exhibits sluggish faradic redox kinetics, rapid degradation of cycling performance, and low volumetric capacitance, due to its poor intrinsic conductivity (10−5 S cm−1).20 Various methods have been employed to increase the overall performance of MoO3via the rational design of electrode configuration (using a more conductive core to construct the core/shell structure or mixing MoO3 with carbon materials such as graphene and CNT) or enhancing the conductivity of MoO3 through ethanol reduction, ion-intercalation or oxygen and nitrogen doping.20,23–32 Nevertheless, these electrodes still require an insulate binder or a low electrochemical performance carbon support, which are disadvantageous for their overall performance. Therefore, development of a paper-like conductive film by just assembling pure electrode material without conductive substrate or agent holds great potential for creating a high performance electrode.
Herein, for the first time, we used hydroiodic acid (HI) as both a reducing agent and an intercalation agent to obtain highly conductive 1D ultralong MoO3−x nanobelts. These 1D nanobelts could easily assemble into a flexible and free-standing conductive film via vacuum filtration and a pressing process. This highly conductive porous HI-treated ultralong MoO3−x (HI-ULM) nanopaper exhibits a high conductivity of 163.4 S cm−1 and robust mechanics characteristics under 1000 times of bending test. Moreover, when employed as an electrode for a supercapacitor, this nanopaper can deliver a high volumetric capacitance of 652 F cm−3. This excellent volumetric capacitance can be ascribed to the efficient ion diffusion in the 3D network structure, fast electron transfer in the highly conductive network, as well as the compact nature of the nanopaper after the pressing treatment. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitor device assembled from this nanopaper shows an excellent cycling performance of over 25000 cycles with a retention rate of 85.7%.
Results and discussion
Highly conductive MoO3−x nanobelts were synthesized via a hydrothermal method followed by HI reduction. Ultralong MoO3 (ULM) nanobelts with a length up to several hundred micrometers were synthesized after the hydrothermal reaction at 220 °C for 7 days (Fig. S1, ESI†). The width and thickness of these nanobelts are about 200 nm and 50 nm, respectively. HI, which is widely used in the preparation of reduced graphene, was found to be an effective reductant for MoO3, since MoO3 is an acid stable metal oxide and its morphology can be well maintained under strongly acidic conditions.33,34 As seen from Fig. 1a, the morphology of ultralong MoO3 did not show significant change after HI treatment, which will be beneficial for the assembling of free-standing film. Moreover, these belts have good dispersibility in water (insets in Fig. 1a). High-resolution transmission electron spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1b and c) revealed the single crystal characteristic of these nanobelts with perpendicular interplanar spacing of 0.37 nm and 0.40 nm, which is consistent with the (200) and (002) d-spacing of MoO3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) further confirmed that the nanobelts before and after the HI treatment were all orthorhombic MoO3 (JCPDS no. 05-0508) (Fig. 1d). The high intensity of (020), (040), and (060) manifests that the nanobelts have a highly ordered orientation in the nanopapers. Importantly, compared to those of MoO3 nanobelts, the peaks of (020), (040), and (060) in HI-ULM nanobelts display an obvious shift to lower angles (Fig. 1e), which is due to the expansion of the interplanar spacing along the [010] direction after H+ intercalation.35 In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the detailed chemical composition (Fig. 1f and S2, ESI†). The spectrum of Mo 3d displays four peaks in HI-ULM nanobelts, which correspond to Mo6+ (236.6 eV and 233.5 eV) and Mo4+ (234.7 eV and 231.4 eV).30 The two strong Mo4+ peaks in the spectrum of HI-ULM nanobelts show a significantly enhanced intensity, whereas they were almost negligible in the spectrum of MoO3, indicating partial reduction of Mo in the HI-ULM nanobelts. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that HI-ULM nanobelts are thermochemically stable up to 792 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Inspired by the ancient papermaking technique invented 2000 years ago, cellulose fibers were recently replaced with functional materials, such as graphene, CNT, and other functional materials, to make some paper-like electrodes.11–14 Similar to making regular paper, free-standing flexible conductive MoO3 nanopaper was fabricated via the vacuum filtration of a homogeneous HI-ULM nanobelts suspension, followed by a pressing and peeling-off process (Fig. 2a).17 A side-view of the nanopaper shows that the thickness of the nanopaper is tens of micrometers, and it can also be tuned by simply adjusting the mass of the materials to be added (Fig. 2b). Consisting of interconnected ultralong MoO3−x nanobelts, with a length of hundreds of micrometers (Fig. 2c), the porous structure and 3D conductive pathway in the conductive HI-ULM nanopaper would facilitate the efficient ion diffusion and fast electron transfer during an electrochemical reaction. Importantly, the nanopapers are mechanically robust and can endure several times of folding and unfolding (Fig. 2d). As can be seen in Fig. S4,† no cracks were found in the flexible HI-ULM nanopaper after folding for four times, and then fully recovering, revealing its excellent mechanical flexibility. Moreover, this film is very hydrophilic with an initial contact angle of 24.0°, and the droplet completely permeates the film within 0.2 s (Fig. 2e). The interpenetrating network architecture of the HI-ULM nanopaper with the hydrophilic features allows aqueous electrolytes to quickly permeate through the whole film and creates interconnected pore channels for facile ion diffusion, leading to faster kinetics and sufficient utilization of the active materials.

To probe the intrinsic conductivity change of MoO3 nanobelts before and after HI treatment, focused ion beam (FIB) lithography was applied to fabricate single-nanobelt devices. The current–voltage (I–V) curves of MoO3 and HI-ULM devices are shown in Fig. 3a. The current response significantly increases with the voltage ranging from −0.5 to 0.5 V, implying a significantly increased conductivity of MoO3 nanobelts after HI reduction. The specific conductivities of MoO3 nanobelts and HI-ULM nanobelts were calculated based on the following equations: (1) (2)where R is the resistance, ρ is the resistivity, l is the length of the nanobelt, A is the cross-sectional area of the nanobelt, and σ is the conductivity of the nanobelt. The conductivity of MoO3 was 10 S m−1, whereas that of HI-treated MoO3−x was 2 × 105 S m−1, which is much higher than that of the SnO2-coated hydrogen molybdenum bronze nanobelt (1350 S m−1), hydrogen treated MoO3−x nanobelt (210 S m−1), and even higher than that of the commercial CNT (104 S m−1).30,32 This exceptionally high conductivity ensures the effective electron transfer on the free-standing 3D network nanopaper electrode.

The lower right inset shows the optical image of HI-ULM nanopaper as electrical connections to light a blue LED by a commercial 3 V battery. 
Pure MoO3 nanopaper is almost insulated with a sheet resistance of over 107 Ω sq−1. However, it could become highly conductive after the HI reduction. As shown in Fig. 3b, the sheet resistance decreased to below 200 Ω sq−1, which was about 177.8, 22.8, 11.4, and 5.1 Ω sq−1 for the 6, 12, 24, and 48 h HI-ULM-assembled nanopapers, respectively. The lowest sheet resistance of 5.1 Ω sq−1 for the HI-ULM nanopaper is even lower than those of CNT paper (10 Ω sq−1), Au paper (7 Ω sq−1), and comparable to that for poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) paper (2.60 Ω sq−1).10,36,37 The calculated electrical conductivity was about 4.7, 35.6, 73.1, and 163.4 S cm−1 for the 6, 12, 24, and 48 h HI-ULM nanopapers, respectively (Fig. S5†). The conductivity of the 48 h treated HI-ULM nanopaper is much higher than that of the DC-sputtered MoOx films (1.6 × 10−5 to 3.22 S cm−1), ethanol-reduced MoO3−x film (10−5 S cm−1), PPy/MoO3 film (10−3 S cm−1), PANI/MoO3 film (10−2 S cm−1), and MoO3−x/CNT film (4 S cm−1).31,38,39 Interestingly, by linking with a commercial 3 V button battery, the HI-ULM nanopaper can also be used as a flexible connecting lead to light a blue light-emitting-diode (LED) (the lowest working potential is 2.5 V), just as shown in the bottom right inset of Fig. 3c. The conductivity stability of the HI-ULM nanopaper at different curvatures (state I to V, upper insets) was examined by monitoring the current under a fixed voltage of 0.5 V (Fig. 3c). It can be observed that the current was almost unchanged at different bending states, revealing that the conductance of the HI-ULM nanopaper is barely affected by the bending stress. Moreover, compared with the initial state, the conductance of the HI-ULM nanopaper remained almost constant after 100, 200, 500, and 1000 cycles with the bending state V (left bottom inset). These excellent results indicate the promising potential of the nanopapers in flexible electronics. To interpret the experimental results, density functional theory calculations were carried out to understand the structures and properties of the pure and H-intercalated MoO3 materials (HxMoO3−y). As shown in Fig. S6,† a 2 × 1 × 2 periodic super cell of HxMoO3−y was employed to study the density of states (DOS) changes of MoO3. It can be found that the Fermi energy level of HxMoO3−y increases and moves to the conduction-band minimum (CBM) with H intercalation. Moreover, the band gaps are narrowed down since the generation of impurity peaks within the band gap results in the improvement of electrical conductivity of MoO3 (Fig. S7†). This is confirmed by the I–V testing of a single wire of HI-ULM.
The unique structural advantage and outstanding conductivity make HI-ULM nanopaper a suitable electrode for application in supercapacitors. First, compared with the traditional electrode, which is composed of active materials, conducting agent, and binders, the binder-free and conducting agent-free 3D conductive network could effectively eliminate the conductivity decrease resulting from the non-conductive components such as various polymeric binders. Second, the high conductivity characteristics of this 3D conductive network could accomplish rapid electron transfer inside the film and have the potential to realise a high-performance thick film-based electrode. Third, the porous structure in this 3D nanostructured electrode could facilitate fast ion diffusion and achieve high-rate ability under a high charging and discharging process. Furthermore, the flexible characteristic of both the nanobelt and nanopaper could serve as a buffer for volume extension/contraction during the ion intercalation and deintercalation of electrolyte ions.
The electrochemical performance of HI-ULM nanopaper was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration in a 5 M LiCl electrolyte. As described in Fig. 4a, the CV integral area of HI-ULM nanopaper is much larger than that of the untreated MoO3 nanopaper at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, demonstrating much enhanced capacitance after HI treatment. Compared with the MoO3 nanobelt paper electrode, two pairs of redox peaks (a/a* and b/b*) appear in the CV curves after HI treatment, which can be ascribed to the multistep Li+ intercalation into the interlayer and intralayer of the MoO3 layered nanostructure (Fig. 4a and b). Two charging and discharging steps in these curves also correspond to the Li+ intercalation and deintercalation process during the electrochemical reaction (Fig. S8, ESI†).18,25 The maximum specific capacitance is calculated to be 550 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, with a capacitance of 280 F g−1 at a higher current density of 20 A g−1 (Fig. S8c, ESI†). This value is similar to the specific capacitance calculated from the CV curves. Then, the cycling life of this free-standing electrode was tested. As shown in Fig. S8d,† the capacitance retention is around 82% after 10000 cycles as compared to the initial performance with a coulombic efficiency of 94.3%, suggesting a very stable structure of this film. EIS spectra further display both the reduced equivalent series resistance (0.288 Ω for HI-ULM vs. 0.442 Ω for ULM) as well as greatly decreased charge transfer resistance (0.172 Ω for HI-ULM vs. 3.742 Ω for ULM) in HI-ULM compared with bare ULM nanobelts, which enable HI-ULM nanopaper to achieve highly-efficient electron transportation and less polarization (Fig. 4c). The CV curves show that the HI-ULM nanopaper electrode delivers a high volumetric capacitance of 652 F cm−3 at 5 mV s−1, more than twice as high as that of the pure MoO3 nanopaper electrode (200 F cm−3) (Fig. 4d). This is the best volumetric capacitance reported for the Mo-based supercapacitor electrodes, which is higher than that of the MoS2 nanopaper (650 F cm−3) and much larger than that of the KyMoO3−x/CNT film (306 F cm−3), HyMoO3−x/CNT film (308 F cm−3), and MoO3−x/CNT film (420 F cm−3).30–32,35,40 The corresponding specific capacitance of the HI-ULM nanopaper electrode is 435 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which is also much larger than those of the most previously reported Mo-based supercapacitor electrodes (Table S1, ESI†).22,24,26,29–32,35,40–50 The excellent volumetric capacitance can be ascribed to the porous 3D conductive network of the HI-ULM nanopaper, fast ion intercalation/deintercalation in the enlarged interlayer space, and high mass density of the electrode after the pressing treatment (1.5 g cm−3). Moreover, the thickness of the HI-ULM nanopaper electrodes can also be easily tuned by controlling the materials to be added for vacuum filtration. As expected, the volumetric capacitance of these electrodes slightly decreased from 652 F cm−3 (12 μm nanopaper) to 510 F cm−3 (25 μm nanopaper) and 380 F cm−3 (52 μm nanopaper) at a fixed scan rate of 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 4e). These results are much higher than those of the paper-based supercapacitor electrodes with a similar thickness (Table S2, ESI†).13,14,32,34,51–55

(f) Cycle performance of the symmetric device based on the HI-ULM nanopaper electrode measured at 100 mV s−1 for 25000 cycles. 
A symmetric device assembled with two HI-ULM nanopaper electrodes was also investigated in a 5 M LiCl aqueous electrolyte. The CV curves maintained a good rectangular shape when the scan rate increased from 5 to 100 mV s−1, demonstrating good supercapacitor performance of the device (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor device was calculated to be 90 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and it slowly decreased to 46 F g−1 when the scan rate was increased to 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S9d, ESI†). The device also exhibits excellent cycling stability and retains 85.7% of its initial capacitance over 25000 cycles, which is much more stable than the previously reported MoO3-based supercapacitors (Fig. 4d, and Table S1, ESI†).24–29,32,41–44,49,50 This high stability of the HI-treated MoO3−x-based supercapacitor can be ascribed to the excellent conductivity of the 3D conductive network with uniform polarization, which can effectively transfer electrons that are generated during the electrochemical process, as well as flexible nanopaper electrodes, which could act as a stress buffer for the volumetric change during ion intercalation and deintercalation, preventing morphological damage.
In summary, highly conductive MoO3−x nanobelts were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction followed by HI reduction. Single-nanobelt device tests showed that the conductivity of the HI-ULM nanobelts can reach a value of 2 × 105 S m−1, which is six orders higher than that of the untreated MoO3 nanobelts. Flexible nanopaper based on this HI-ULM nanobelts assembly shows a low sheet resistance of 5.1 Ω sq−1 and exhibits a stable conductive characteristic over 1000 cycles of bending. This binder-free and conducting agent-free HI-ULM nanopaper electrode delivers an excellent volumetric capacitance of 652 F cm−3 and a long-term stability over 25000 cycles with a retention rate of 85.7% due to its fast electron transfer and ion diffusion within the 3D porous conductive network. The HI-ULM nanopaper with an outstanding flexibility, high conductivity, and excellent electrochemical performance holds promising potential for applications in flexible electronics. Furthermore, this facile strategy can also be applied to fabricate other flexible conductive nanopapers for energy storage and conversion.
Experimental section
Synthesis of ultralong MoO3 nanobelts
Ultralong MoO3 nanobelts were synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction. Typically, 2 g molybdenum metal powder was added to 10 mL deionized water and stirred to form a uniform mixture. Then, 20 mL H2O2 solution (30 wt%) was added dropwise to this solution until the solution became light-yellow to obtain a peroxo-polymolybdic acid solution. Stirring of the peroxo-polymolybdic acid solution was continued for 30 min to allow for a thorough reaction. After this, the solution was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to undergo a hydrothermal reaction at 220 °C for 7 days. The precipitate was rinsed using deionized water and ethanol several times.
Synthesis of HI treated MoO3 nanobelts
HI treated MoO3 nanobelts were synthesized via a reduction reaction in an acidic aqueous solution. MoO3 nanobelts (0.2 g) were added to 10 mL acetic acid and stirred for 1 h to allow full dispersion. HI solution (1 mL) was injected to the abovementioned solution and reacted for 6 to 48 h. The resulting precipitates were collected and washed with acetic acid, ethanol, and deionized water.
Preparation of the free-standing HI-treated MoO3 nanopaper
A vacuum filtration method was used to prepare the free-standing flexible HI-treated MoO3 nanopaper. HI-treated MoO3 nanobelts were added to deionized water and stirred to make a uniform suspension. The as-obtained solution was filtered through a filter membrane with 0.22 μm pore size and washed several times with deionized water. The obtained filter cake was pressed under 2000 psi for 30 s, dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight, and then peeled off to obtain a free-standing nanopaper.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Philips X' Pert Pro) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The morphology of the ultralong MoO3 nanobelts and HI treated MoO3 nanobelts was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Nova 450 Nano) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G20). Thermogravimetric (TG) data were obtained using a Netzsch STA 449 F3 thermoanalyzer with air as the carrier gas at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using electrochemical workstation (EC-lab VMP-300 and CHI 660). The single nanobelt device was fabricated via a focused ion beam (FIB, Quanta 3D FEG) with Pt as the electrode. The test was carried out with an Agilent 2400 instrument. For the typical three-electrode test, a piece of MoO3 or HI-treated MoO3 nanopaper film was used as the working electrode, whereas Ag/AgCl (CHI, USA), YP-50 (Kuraray Chemical, USA), and Celgard membrane (Celgard, USA) were used as reference electrode, counter electrode, and separator, respectively. The mass loading for the electrode was 1.8 mg cm−2. The two-electrode symmetric device was constructed based on two pieces of HI-treated MoO3 nanopaper films with the same area and mass as those of the electrode. All the electrochemical tests were conducted using Swagelok cells (Swagelok, USA).
Calculations
For the three-electrode system and two-electrode supercapacitor devices, the specific capacitance is calculated from the CV area by the following equations:56,57    where Cs is the specific capacitance (F g−1), Cv is the volumetric capacitance (F cm−3), I is the applied current (A), ν is the scan rate (V s−1), m is the mass loading (g), V(Vf − Vi) is the working potential, and ΔV is the volume of the electrode.
