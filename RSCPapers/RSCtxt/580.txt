1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) that can be fabricated by simple solution processing techniques are under intense investigation in academic and industrial laboratories because of their potential to enable mass production of flexible, light-weight and cost-effective devices.1 During the past decade, solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs have attracted much attention with encouraging power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 9%.2 Fullerenes and their derivatives have been the dominant electron acceptor materials in BHJ OSCs due to their large electron affinity, isotropy of charge transport and high electron mobility.3 However, fullerenes have a few disadvantages, such as restricted electronic tuning and weak absorption in the visible region. Furthermore, in a typical BHJ system of poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM), energy level mismatching between the donor and the acceptor results in low open-circuit voltage (VOC) and energy loss. To solve these problems, new electron acceptor materials with strong and broad absorption spectra and appropriate energy levels are desirable. Recently, non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have been developed;4 however, very few reports on solution-processed fullerene-free OSCs have shown PCEs approaching or exceeding 2%.5 High anisotropy in light absorption and charge transport is of critical concern for linear non-fullerene acceptor materials. To our knowledge, there have been very few reports on multi-branched or star-shaped electron acceptors so far.6
5,5-Bibenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT) is a 5,5-connected dimer of a widely used electron deficient building block benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT). Due to several attractive properties of the BBT unit, such as easy molecular structure tailoring and facile electronic structure manipulation, we have firstly synthesized BBT based organic semiconductors, and demonstrated their application in organic electronics, and so far BBT based organic semiconductors have been used in organic field-effect transistors,7 phototransistors,8 solar cells9 and light-emitting diodes.9b Recently, several BT based molecules have shown promising photovoltaic performance in OSCs as electron acceptors with the PCE up to 2.54%,5e,i which is among the highest values reported for small molecule non-fullerene acceptors. Relative to BT, BBT has stronger electron-accepting ability due to two BT units, therefore BBT could also be a promising building block for the synthesis of electron acceptors.
Triphenylamine (TPA) has a special propeller starburst molecular structure due to the sp3 hybrid orbital of the nitrogen atom.10 As a result, amorphous materials with isotropic optical and charge-transporting properties could be expected when combining TPA with π-conjugated systems. In the field of designing star-shaped TPA-based molecules for OSCs, Roncali and coworkers have carried out systematic research.1c,11 We also reported several solution-processed star-shaped donors and acceptors with TPA as the core for promising OSCs.6,12
Here we design and synthesize a novel star-shaped small molecule based on TPA as the core and BBT as arms (S(TPA-BBT), Scheme 1) and demonstrate its application in OSCs as the first example of BBT-based non-fullerene electron acceptors. S(TPA-BBT) exhibited excellent thermal stability and appropriate energy levels matching with P3HT. Solution-processed BHJ OSCs based on P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) showed PCEs of 0.81%.

2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
A synthetic route towards S(TPA-BBT) is shown in Scheme 1. BBT was brominated by bromine in hydrobromic acid to yield compound 1. The intermediate compound 2 was synthesized through Stille coupling reaction between compound 1 and tributyl(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)stannane using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. Compound 2 was brominated by N-bromosuccinimide to afford compound 3. Finally, S(TPA-BBT) was synthesized by a Stille coupling reaction between compound 3 and tris(4-(tributylstannyl)phenyl)amine. S(TPA-BBT) was fully characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and elemental analysis. S(TPA-BBT) is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and dichlorobenzene at room temperature, owing to three solubilizing n-dodecyl substituents. The thermal properties of S(TPA-BBT) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This star-shaped molecule exhibits excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 353 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 1a). The DSC traces for this compound show no melting peak from room temperature to 250 °C (Fig. 1b), suggesting that it could be amorphous.

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1c shows the normalized spectra of optical absorption of S(TPA-BBT) in chloroform solution (10−6 M) and in thin solid film. S(TPA-BBT) in solution exhibits two absorption peaks at 326 nm and 450 nm, which exhibits red shift to 334 and 482 nm in thin film, respectively. The optical band gap (Eg) estimated from the absorption edge (568 nm) of the thin film is 2.18 eV, similar to that of the widely used electron acceptor PC61BM.3
The electrochemical property of S(TPA-BBT) was investigated by a cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in film on a glassy carbon working electrode in 0.1 M [nBu4N]+[PF6]− CH3CN solution at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 1d, S(TPA-BBT) exhibits quasi-reversible reduction and irreversible oxidation waves. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials versus FeCp2+/0 are 0.68 and −1.70 V, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies were estimated to be −5.48 and −3.10 eV from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, assuming the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 to be 4.8 eV below vacuum. The HOMO and LUMO energies are lower than those (−4.76 and −2.74 eV) of P3HT, respectively.13 The LUMO gap (0.36 eV) and HOMO gap (0.82 eV) between P3HT and S(TPA-BBT) are large enough to guarantee efficient exciton dissociation.14 The difference between the LUMO of S(TPA-BBT) and the HOMO of P3HT is as large as 1.66 eV, which could result in high VOC of solar cells.
Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential application of S(TPA-BBT) in OSCs, we used S(TPA-BBT) as an electron acceptor and classical polymer P3HT as an electron donor, and fabricated BHJ OSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:S(TPA-BBT)/Ca/Al. Table 1 summarizes VOC, short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the devices at different donor/acceptor weight ratios. These devices yielded relatively high VOC values of 0.84–0.87 V, and the blend at donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 gave the best performance: VOC, JSC, FF and PCE reach 0.87 V, 1.51 mA cm−2, 0.312 and 0.41%, respectively. Thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min improves VOC to 0.99 V, JSC to 1.81 mA cm−2, FF to 0.452, and ultimately results in an enhanced efficiency of 0.81%, 98% enhancement compared to that for the as-cast device (Table 1, Fig. 2a). In contrast, OSCs with the same structure using compound 2 without the star-shaped structure as the acceptor instead of S(TPA-BBT) show very poor performance (PCE = 0.024%) with VOC of 0.40 V, JSC of 0.19 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.32. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) of the P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) blend film with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 without and with annealing at 150 °C is shown in Fig. 2b. These blend films show IPCE spectra from 300 to 650 nm with a peak at 515 nm and a shoulder from 330 nm to 400 nm. The shoulder has a similar profile to the absorption spectrum of the neat S(TPA-BBT) film, suggesting that the S(TPA-BBT) acceptor in the BHJ blend also considerably contributes to IPCE and JSC. Thermal annealing improves IPCE maximum at 515 nm from 11% to 14%, which is consistent with the enhancement in JSC. However, the relatively low electron mobility (μe) of 2.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 of S(TPA-BBT), which was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of Mg/S(TPA-BBT)/Mg/Al (Fig. 3), could limit further improvement in JSC and FF.

The active layer morphology was examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique in tapping mode. The surface morphology of blend films of P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) (1:1, w/w) as cast and after annealing is shown in Fig. 4. The film as cast exhibits crystalline domains with a root-mean-square roughness of 2.5 nm. After thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min, the crystalline grains change to larger size domains, and the roughness slightly increases. The crystalline grains or domains are probably due to self-organization of P3HT, which is beneficial to ordered structure formation and charge transport in the thin film.15

Compared to its diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based analogue (S(TPA-DPP)) previously reported by our group,6 the P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) blend shows a smoother surface and smaller domain size, leading to a higher FF (0.452 vs. 0.379 for P3HT:S(TPA-DPP)) in OSCs. However, S(TPA-BBT) exhibits a broader optical band gap (2.18 eV) and lower electron mobility (2.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) relative to those (Eg = 1.85 eV, μe = 6.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) of S(TPA-DPP), which restrict harvesting of the low energy photons and charger transport in thin film, and lower Jsc (1.81 mA cm−2 for P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) vs. 2.68 mA cm−2 for P3HT:S(TPA-DPP)) of solar cells.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel star-shaped non-fullerene acceptor (S(TPA-BBT)) with TPA as the core and BBT as arms was synthesized and applied in BHJ OSCs as the first example of BBT-based non-fullerene acceptors. S(TPA-BBT) has excellent thermal stability and appropriate energy levels matching with P3HT. The BHJ OSCs based on the P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) blend after annealing at 150 °C for 10 min gave a PCE of 0.81%. This preliminary work demonstrates that BBT unit may be a promising building block of non-fullerene acceptors for OSCs.

Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz or 600 MHz spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a GCT-MS micromass spectrometer in electron impact (EI) mode or on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF Analyzer in MALDI mode. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed with a Bruker Tensor 27 using a thin KBr pellet. Elemental analyses were carried out using a FLASH EA1112 elemental analyzer. Solution (chloroform) and thin film (on quartz substrate) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JΛSCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were carried out under nitrogen with a deoxygenated solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in CH3CN using a computer-controlled CHI660C electrochemical workstation, a glassy-carbon working electrode coated with samples, a platinum-wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag wire anodized with AgCl as a pseudo-reference electrode. Potentials were referenced to ferrocenium/ferrocene (FeCp2+/0) couple by using ferrocene as an internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed using a METTLER differential scanning calorimeter (DSC822e) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The nanoscale morphology of the blend film was observed by using a Veeco Nanoscopy V atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode.
Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic cells
Photovoltaic cells were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) or 2/Ca/Al. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 30 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 30 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 30 min. An o-dichlorobenzene solution (30 mg mL−1 for donor/acceptor) of the blend of P3HT:S(TPA-BBT) or P3HT:2 was subsequently spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at the speed of 4000 rpm to form a photosensitive layer. Calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminium (ca. 50 nm) layers were subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to converted current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured by using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp.
Fabrication and characterization of electron-only diodes
Electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: Mg/S(TPA-BBT)/Mg/Al. Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the SCLC method (eqn (1)).18 J = 9ε0εrμeV2/8L3(1)where J is the current density, L is the film thickness of the active layer, μe is the electron mobility, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), V = Vappl − Vbi, where Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes (for this device architecture, Vbi is 0 V).
