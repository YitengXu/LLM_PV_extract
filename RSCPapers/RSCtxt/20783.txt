    , Accepted 29th July 2019First published on 30th July 2019AbstractGraphene has many superlative thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. However, the thermoelectric performance of graphene is limited by its high thermal conductivity and small Seebeck coefficient. To address this problem, monolayer and bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons together with graphene/MoSSe heterostructures have been investigated in this work. The electron and phonon transport, and the thermoelectric properties of the monolayer and bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons, together with the graphene/MoSSe heterostructures, have been analyzed by first-principles methods in conjunction with non-equilibrium Green's function and the Landauer equation. The results indicate that figure of merit (ZT) values of 2.01 and 1.64 can be achieved for graphene/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons and symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons respectively at 300 K, which are much higher than the ZT value of prime graphene (ZT ∼ 0.05). The maximum ZT values of these structures increase at T < 350 K, while the maximum ZT decreases at high temperatures (T > 350 K). However, the maximum ZT values of the symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons show an increase with temperatures up to 550 K. From our analysis, phonon thermal conductivity and temperature are key factors determining the ZT values in MoSSe nanoribbons. The significantly enhanced ZT values make graphene/SeMoS stacking nanoribbons and symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons promising candidates for application in thermoelectric devices.
Introduction
Since 2009 there has been a surge of research interest in reducing the demand for fossil fuels by developing renewable energy resources. Among many energy conversion techniques, thermoelectric conversion offers a green option for harvesting electrical power from waste heat.1–3 The energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric devices is characterized by the figure of merit ZT = S2GeT/(ke + kph), where S, Ge and T are the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the temperature, respectively and ke and kph are the thermal conductivity of the electrons and the phonons, respectively. A good thermoelectric device should have low thermal conductivity, high electrical conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient. However, according to the Wiedemann–Franz law and the Mott formula, increasing electrical conductivity usually leads to enhancement in the thermal conductivity of the electrons, hence reducing the Seebeck coefficient, which means that it is very difficult to control the thermal conductivity, the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, independently.4 As a result, the key to improving the thermoelectric performance of a device is to find a trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity.
In previous studies, a relatively high in-plane Hall mobility (over 34000 cm2 V−1 s−1),5 a wide tunable range of Seebeck coefficient (−4 × 102 to −1 × 105 μV K−1),6 and a relatively low thermal conductivity (62.2 W m−1 K−1)7 of monolayer MoS2 have been reported, which indicates that transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are particularly suitable for thermoelectric applications.8–11 In 2017, the first true Janus TMD was discovered - MoSSe, which was fabricated by fully replacing one S atom with a Se atom within the monolayer MoS2 using chemical vapour deposition (CVD).12 Compared with traditional TMD materials, monolayer MoSSe exhibits greater stability in its out-of-plane structure asymmetry, which yields a large intrinsic dipole,13,14 spin–orbit coupling dependent band structures12 and piezoelectric properties.12,15 Although some theoretical and experimental studies have been reported on the relevant applications of the monolayer MoSSe including natural doping,16,17 solar water splitting,18–20 optoelectronic devices,21,22 and bandgap engineering,23 the thermoelectric performance of MoSSe nanostructures has not been fully explored. Experiments demonstrating the synthesis of MoSSe monolayers and TMDs/graphene heterostructures have been reported in some previous papers.12,13,24 MoSSe nanostructures have shown great potential for application in thermoelectric devices but have not been explored in experiments. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct some theoretical studies, which can serve as design guides for further experimentation.
In this work, the electron and phonon transport and thermoelectric performance of monolayer MoSSe nanoribbons, bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons are systematically researched using the first-principles calculations along with non-equilibrium Green's function and the Landauer equation, which have been applied in previous studies on TMD thermoelectric performance.25–29 It has been discovered that the phonon contribution to the overall thermal conductivity is much more important than the electron conductivity in these MoSSe nanostructures. Moreover, ZT values of 2.01 and 1.64 can be achieved for the graphene/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons and the symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons at 300 K.
Computational procedure
In the present model, ab initio simulations are performed using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Atomistix ToolKit (ATK2018) simulation tools.30 The exchange–correlation functional chooses the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the parametrization of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) used in the structure optimization. In the bilayer MoSSe nanostructures, in order to consider the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between the two layers, we used semi-empirical corrections in the Grimme DFT-D2 model.31 In the optimization simulation, the cutoff energy of 150 Ry and 15 × 15 × 1 k-points grid were used in the Brillouin zone. The structure is fully relaxed until the force on each atom becomes smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1, and the stress error tolerance is 0.001 eV Å−3. In our electron and phonon transport calculations, a vacuum spacing of at least 20 Å in the normal direction to the electron transport plane was used to avoid interactions of the periodic boundary conditions. The Brillouin zone of the MoSSe nanoribbon device is sampled using a 1 × 1 × 200 k-mesh and a double-zeta polarized for all atoms. In the transport regime, the electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the electronic thermal conductivity are calculated using the first-principles calculations along with non-equilibrium Green's function. The phonon thermal conductivity is calculated based on the Landauer equation. First, the electron (Te) and phonon (Tp) transmission functions are deduced from Green's functions of the electron Schrodinger equation and the lattice dynamic equation, respectively. Then, the current across the MoSSe nanoribbon device can be calculated as: (1)where h is Planck's constant, μL and μR are the chemical potentials of the left and right electrodes, fL(E) and fR(E) are the Fermi distribution functions of the left and right electrodes. The electrical conductivity (Ge) is calculated from a function of the Fermi energy μ as: (2)The Seebeck coefficient and the electronic thermal conductivity can be calculated from the intermediate function Ln: (3)where f is the Fermi distribution function at temperature T. In the end, the Seebeck coefficient (S) and the electronic thermal conductivity (Ke) can be calculated as: (4) (5)The phonon thermal conductivity (Kp) is calculated from the Landauer equation: (6)where n(ω,T) is the Bose–Einstein distribution function at temperature T, ω is the phonon frequency and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The phonon thermal conductivity can be rewritten in a temperature dependent form: (7)where kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1, to construct the models of MoSSe nanoribbons, we firstly optimized the lattice parameters of the monolayer MoSSe. For the monolayer MoSSe, the optimized lattice parameters are a = b = 3.22 Å. The distance between the S and Se atoms is 3.23 Å and the angle between the Mo–S and Mo–Se bonds is 81.4°, which are consistent with previously reported experimental results.12 Because the GGA-PBE method usually underestimates the bandgap, we used the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) method in our band structure simulations. The HSE bandgap of the monolayer MoSSe is 2.04 eV, which corresponds well with the 1.77 eV optical bandgap obtained from experimental measurements.12Fig. 1c shows the band structures of the Brillouin zone of high symmetry points along the path through Γ–M–K–Γ and the projected density of states (PDOS) of the monolayer MoSSe. The calculation results show that monolayer MoSSe exhibits a direct bandgap with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM) located at the K point in the Brillouin zone. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1d, the PDOS of the CBM and the VBM of the monolayer MoSSe are contributed mainly from the Mo-d orbital. Moreover, we calculated the electron affinity of the monolayer MoSSe to be 3.71 eV.

Fig. 2 shows the relaxed structures and band structures of monolayer MoSSe nanoribbons, which can be obtained by cutting the monolayer MoSSe. Depending on the edge shape of the nanoribbons, we classify them into armchair MoSSe nanoribbons and zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons. Moreover, based on the edge symmetries of armchair MoSSe nanoribbons, they can be constructed as: symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons (ac-s) and asymmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons (ac-u). Similarly, zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons can be constructed as symmetric zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons (zz-s) and asymmetric zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons (zz-u). In order to improve the stabilities of the nanoribbons, we induce hydrogen-passivation at the edge of the MoSSe nanoribbons in our transport simulation. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the calculated band structures of ac-s and ac-u show that they are direct bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.29 eV and 0.12 eV, respectively, while Fig. 2c and d show that zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons are metallic. These electronic properties of MoSSe nanoribbons are similar to those of MoS2 nanoribbons.32 These various band structures indicate different electronic conductivities and Seebeck coefficients, which influence the thermoelectric performance of these MoSSe-based nanoribbons. From ref. 33, it is seen that the bandgap of MoSSe nanotubes is about 1.44 eV, which is far larger than that of symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons (0.29 eV). Moreover, the different band structures will induce different electronic conductivities of MoSSe nanotubes and nanoribbons.

The electron and phonon transmission spectra of the MoSSe nanoribbons are provided in Fig. 3a and b and show that the electron and phonon transmission values of zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons are far higher than the those of armchair MoSSe nanoribbons, which is consistent with the band analysis results that zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons are metallic while armchair MoSSe nanoribbons are semiconducting. Fig. 3c and d show the calculated I–V and dI/dV curves for armchair and zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons. In the −1 to +1 V bias voltage range, the I–V curves of zz-s and zz-u exhibit behaviors similar to those of a normal transistor, while the ac-s and ac-u show back-to-back p–n junction behavior. These results mean that the electronic transport performance of MoSSe nanoribbons strongly depends on their edge shapes, which is similar to other 2D materials, such as graphene and MoS2.32,34,35 Moreover, zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons have a stronger current than armchair nanoribbons over the whole voltage range. When the bias voltage is varied from 0 V to 1 V, zz-s has the largest current in the four nanoribbons (Izz-s > Izz-u > Iac-s > Iac-u). As shown in Fig. 3d, the dI/dV curves of MoSSe nanoribbons are asymmetric, which is due to the atoms of the MoSSe nanoribbons have shifted positions slightly after the structure was relaxed. Similar results were shown in previous studies.32,36

By integrating the calculated transmission spectra and rearranging eqn (2), (4)–(6), the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the ZT values of MoSSe nanoribbons can be readily obtained at 300 K. As shown in Fig. 4, the chemical potential (μ) is indicated by the difference between the Fermi energy (EF) and the DFT-predicted Fermi energy (EDFTF). For p-type doping the chemical potential is negative while it is positive for n-type doping. In Fig. 2, the band structures of ac-s, ac-u, zz-s and zz-u are different, which results in the peaks and valleys in the electrical conductivity curves. Fig. 4a shows that the electrical conductivity of zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons is higher than that of the armchair MoSSe nanoribbons, which exactly matches with the results obtained from the I–V and dI/dV curves. The development of thermal conductivity of ac-s, ac-u, zz-s and zz-u has a similar behavior to the electrical conductivity. Because of the metallic properties of zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons, the heat transport performance of zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons is better than that of the armchair MoSSe nanoribbons. The Seebeck coefficients of ac-s, ac-u, zz-s and zz-u are shown in Fig. 4c. In our band structure simulation (Fig. 2), bandgap opening is shown in ac-s and ac-u, which results in a higher Seebeck coefficient maximum than those of zz-s and zz-u. In ac-s, the maximum value is about 0.58 mV K−1, which is slightly below the symmetric armchair MoS2 nanoribbon (∼0.70 mV K−1) value.26 The ZT values of ac-s, ac-u, zz-s and zz-u are shown in Fig. 4d. It is clear that the thermoelectric performance of armchair MoSSe nanoribbons is far superior to that of zigzag MoSSe nanoribbons. Two high ZT values at 300 K are about 1.64 and 1.25 for ac-s and ac-u respectively, which are around 150 times higher than those of zz-s and zz-u. In Fig. 4a and b, the development of electrical conductivities of ac-s, ac-u, zz-s and zz-u shows similar trends with thermal conductivities, which illustrates that the high Seebeck coefficient induces high ZT values in ac-s and ac-u.

As shown in Fig. 5, we construct bilayer MoSSe (MoSSe–MoSSe) and graphene/MoSSe heterogeneous nanoribbons. The bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons are constructed by attaching two monolayer MoSSe nanoribbons together with AA stacking type,37 while graphene/MoSSe heterogeneous nanoribbons are constructed by attaching the monolayer MoSSe and graphene together with the Generalized Lattice Match (GLM) method.38 Because the monolayer MoSSe has one S atom and a Se atom on each side, we construct two stacking types with graphene, named as C/SMoSe and C/SeMoS. Since the size of the monolayer MoSSe and graphene cells is not commensurate, 0.63% strain needs to build up at the graphene face to tune the lattice constant for matching with the MoSSe layer. In previous studies, the mismatch strains of heterostructures are usually less than 3%,39–41 and our 0.63% strain means an acceptable lattice mismatch between graphene and monolayer MoSSe. Fig. 5a shows the fat band structure of the bilayer MoSSe. The red and blue lines indicate the band projection on the top and bottom layers of the bilayer MoSSe nanoribbon, respectively. Obviously, adding a layer on the monolayer MoSSe induces a band-shift of about 0.5 eV. In the bilayer MoSSe stack, the intrinsic electric field of individual layers induces a p–n junction across the systems.42 As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the purple and green lines represent the bands of MoSSe and graphene, respectively. The Dirac cone at the K point comes from the bands of the graphene layer. Moreover, the CBM and the VBM of the MoSSe layer shift from the K point (pristine monolayer MoSSe) to the Γ point, which is attributed to the band dispersion subjected to the vdW interaction. Interestingly, the Dirac cone position of C/SMoSe stacking is on the Fermi level about 0.11 eV, which means that the graphene layer has a carrier density of 8.95 × 1011 cm−2 hole doping.43 The monolayer MoSSe has an intrinsic dipole on the surface, inducing an electrostatic potential difference of 0.77 eV from the Se atom to the S atom. In the C/SMoSe stacking, the electrons can be easily moved from the Dirac cone to the valence band under the build-in electric field of MoSSe because the electron affinity of the monolayer MoSSe (3.71 eV) is close to the work function of the graphene (4.30 eV).44 However, in the C/SeMoS stacking, the build-in electric field strength is not enough to support the electrons overcoming the bandgap of MoSSe (2.03 eV) and moving from the conduction band to the Dirac cone.

Fig. 6 shows the plots of the calculated electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and ZT values as a function of chemical potential (EF − EDFTF), at 300 K which corresponds to the doping type of the system. We see from Fig. 6a and b that the graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons show much larger values compared with the bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons. The detailed examination of the band structures indicates that the bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons have an open bandgap of 0.71 eV, while the bandgap of graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons are closed. As a result, we observe a much lower electrical conductivity in the bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons. Moreover, graphene has a high thermal conductivity (4000 W m−1 K−1),4 which induces a stronger heat transport capability in the graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons. We investigate bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and vertical graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons because the vdW interaction can limit the thermal conductivity in the normal direction to the 2D plane. In our paper, the thermal conductivities of bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and vertical graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons are only about 0.013 nW K−1 and 0.067 nW K−1, respectively, which are far lower than those of monolayer graphene (>4000 W m−1 K−1)4 and MoSSe (345 W K−1).45 We see from Fig. 6c that the Seebeck coefficients of bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons show two clear peaks around 0 eV. The absolute value is about 0.48 mV K−1 for bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons, which is larger than the graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons (0.39 mV K−1). Similar to electrical conductivity, the maximum of Seebeck coefficient also depends on the bandgap of three systems. Fig. 6d shows the room temperature ZT values of bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and graphene/MoSSe heterostructure nanoribbons. The ZT values of bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons, C/SMoSe stacking and C/SeMoS stacking heterostructure nanoribbons were determined to be 1.28, 1.16 and 2.01 by applying appropriate doping levels.

To evaluate the thermoelectric performance of MoSSe nanoribbons, we calculated the corresponding transport coefficients of ZT > 1 MoSSe nanoribbons in Table 1. The Seebeck coefficients of five MoSSe nanoribbons at the ZT peak are very close, which means that the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are the two key contributing parameters which lead to a promising figure of merit for the MoSSe nanoribbons. Compared with the monolayer MoSSe nanoribbons (ac-s and ac-u), the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are much lower in the bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons (C–S, C–Se and MoSSe–MoSSe), which indicates that the vdW interaction between the two layers limits the electron and phonon transport in the normal direction to the 2D plane. The thermal conductivity calculations show that the phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity is much more than the electron contribution in the chemical potential range around the high ZT peaks. Our research suggests that symmetric armchair MoSSe and C/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons are better candidates for achieving better performance thermoelectric devices.

To investigate the effect of temperature on the thermoelectric performance of symmetric armchair MoSSe and C/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons, we calculated the variation of maximum values of ZT (Max ZT). As shown in Fig. 7a, the Max ZT of C/SeMoS stacking nanoribbons increases to the maximum when T < 350 K, while the Max ZT reduces at high temperatures (T > 350 K). However, in Fig. 7b, the Max ZT of the symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbon monotonically increases with the increase of temperature until 550 K. The highest ZT values of the symmetric armchair MoSSe and C/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons can reach 2.01 and 2.31 at 550 K and 350 K, respectively. To explain the reason for the different ZT-temperature relations in the above two structures, we calculated kp, Ge, S2Ge and S2GeT as shown in Fig. 7c–f. Obviously, the electrical conductivity and the phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity increase with the rise in temperature, and then tend to be stable at high temperatures. Moreover, the electrical conductivity and phonon thermal conductivity of the C/SeMoS stacking nanoribbons are weaker than those of the symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons from 50 K to 550 K because the vdW interaction hinders the electron and phonon transport between the two layers. In the C/SeMoS stacking nanoribbon (Fig. 7e), the extreme point in the S2Ge curve appears at 300 K, while it shifts to 450 K in the S2GeT curve, which means the transition of the Max ZT at 350 K (Fig. 7a) is induced by the variation of the phonon thermal conductivity. In the symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbon (Fig. 7f), although the extreme point in the S2Ge curve appears at 300 K, the relation of S2GeT with temperature is nearly linear. Therefore, the Max ZT of this type monotonically increases with the increase of temperature. These results indicate that phonon thermal conductivity and temperature are key factors in the variation of MAX ZT values.

A good thermoelectric device should have an optimized trade-off between the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient. Although graphene has a high electrical conductivity, the thermoelectric figure of merit was unsatisfactory because of its high thermal conductivity (>4000 W m−1 K−1) and small Seebeck coefficient (<100 μV K−1).4 For monolayer MoS2, it has a large theoretical thermoelectric power factor of 28 mW m−1 K−2 at 300 K.25 Based on this thermoelectric power factor and the experimentally obtained lattice thermal conductivity (34.5 ± 4 W m−1 K−1), a ZT value of 0.5 is reported at 300 K.46 With the same width as our MoSSe nanoribbon, the theoretical results showed that the ZT values of MoS2 nanoribbons were only 1.3 and 0.8 for n type and p type doping, respectively.26 In previous theoretical research, a high ZT value of about 7.4 can be obtained in the MoS2/MoSe2 nanoribbons, while the temperature was around 800 K.29 A recent study showed that the lattice thermal conductivity in the MoSSe monolayer is 345 W K−1 at room temperature, which is much lower than that of the MoS2 monolayer.45 In our manuscript, the Seebeck coefficient of graphene/SeMoS stacked layers and symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons is calculated to be 0.24 mV K−1, which is nearly 2.4 times higher than that of the pristine graphene. Moreover, a strong reduction of thermal conductivity for graphene/SeMoS stacked layers (0.058 nW K−1) compared with the monolayer graphene and MoS2 has been demonstrated, which is due to the fact that the van der Waals interaction limits the thermal conductivity in the normal direction to the 2D plane. The ZT values of 2.01 and 1.64 can be achieved for graphene/SeMoS stacked layers and symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons at 300 K, which demonstrates better thermoelectric performances than graphene, MoS2 monolayer, MoS2 nanoribbons, and the MoSSe monolayer. Hence, the symmetric armchair MoSSe and C/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons are better candidates for application in thermoelectric devices.
Conclusions
In this work, for the first time, the electron and phonon transport and thermoelectric performance of monolayer MoSSe nanoribbons, bilayer MoSSe nanoribbons and graphene/MoSSe heterogeneous nanoribbons have been systematically researched using the first-principles methods with non-equilibrium Green's function. It was determined that ZT values of 2.01 and 1.64 can be achieved for graphene/SeMoS stacked layers and symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons at 300 K respectively. It was found that the Max ZT values of C/SeMoS stacked nanoribbons increase to the maximum when T < 350 K and show a decreasing trend at high temperatures (T > 350 K). However, the Max ZT values of symmetric armchair MoSSe nanoribbons monotonically increase with increasing temperature up to 550 K. The results indicate that phonon thermal conductivity and temperature are key factors in the variation of Max ZT values in MoSSe nanoribbons. The present study paves the way for future design and implementation of high-performance thermoelectric devices.
