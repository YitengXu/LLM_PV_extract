    , Accepted 19th July 2022First published on 3rd August 2022AbstractQuantum dots (QDs), also known as “artificial atoms”, are a new class of engineering nanoparticles. They are semiconductor nanocrystals composed of a few atoms and have good optical, electrical, electrochemical, and catalytic properties. Due to their excellent properties, QDs have been used in biological imaging, electronic devices, solar cells, electrochemical sensing, and other fields. Although QDs have valuable social benefits, a growing number of QDs are being released into the environment in different ways, migrating and transforming in the environment, and interacting with biota, which may pose risks to the environment and human health. Therefore, it is extremely significant to understand the behaviors, potential release pathways, sink, final fates, and action mechanism of QDs under various environmental conditions. This review paper introduces the properties and applications of QDs, summarizes the potential release pathways, behaviors, and final fate of QDs in the environment, and expounds on the impact of different QDs on the environment and human beings, to provide a reference for scientists engaged in QDs research to better understand the challenges of QDs in the natural environment and their impact on human health.

Environmental significance
Quantum dots (QDs) are high-performance fluorescent nanomaterials with a wide range of applications in the biomedical and electronics industries. Despite the recent significant interest in studying the toxicity mechanisms of QDs, little is known about the sources of environmental exposure, transport, transformation, and effects of environmental factors on their properties, and the ecotoxicity of QDs has not been elucidated. The knowledge gap hinders risk assessment. This review describes the possible sources, transport, transformation and ultimate fate of QDs in the environment and their effects on biology, and suggests requirements for future QD risk assessment: developing new monitoring tools to determine specific concentrations; shifting from descriptive to predictive toxicology; and studying the synergistic effects of real-world QDs and different substances.

1. Introduction
Quantum dots (QDs) are highly fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals consisting of elements in atomic groups II–IV or III–V of the periodic table that have a smaller size than the exciton Bohr radius for this material1 and have valuable characteristics for medical use and industrial applications2–4 on account of their excellent optical, electrical, electrochemical, and catalytic properties.5 Since the start of the 21st century, the further expansion of the technology for synthesizing QDs has laid the foundation for their large-scale production. Data shows that the global output of QDs is estimated to be between 0.6 and 55 tons,6 with an estimated annual growth rate of 58% from 2015 to 2025, and that commercial applications of this product have already generated significant revenues, with the global QDs revenue in 2015 standing between $400 million and $600 million.7 However, the potential cost of this economic efficiency is that it may lead to the unintentional or intentional release of QDs into the environment at each stage of the product life cycle (the production process, the use stage, and the end of the life cycle), increasing risks to human health and contributing to the pollution of terrestrial and aquatic environments. The environmental costs associated with QDs are a sensitive subject that needs due consideration, especially when many products containing QDs are developed from the test bed to the consumer without sufficient safety evaluation.
In recent years, there has been growing attention to nanoparticles (NPs) due to rising concerns over their health and environmental risks, and there have been increasing efforts to understand, identify, and address the potential sources of such risks. The negative effects of the accidental release of QDs and their contents into the environment have become a prominent problem. Numerous studies have investigated the occurrence, ultimate fate, and ecotoxicity of QDs, which are crucial to understand for a proper evaluation of the existence of these contaminants in the environmental context.8–10 The majority of QDs are transferred between different environmental media through different physical and chemical interactions; for example, QDs on the land surface can be transferred to surface water and groundwater or transported to the water system through rainwater runoff,9,11 and finally distributed in the land, surface water, groundwater, and seawater,12–14 thus polluting the environment and resulting in ecological toxicity to biota through the release of heavy metals.10,15–17 The composition and characteristics of QDs in the environment are affected by environmental factors (pH, UV, temperature, etc.).10,18,19 Humans in the natural environment can be exposed to QDs through the air, soil, or water, or by eating plants or animals, and it has been demonstrated in vitro, in vivo, and in model organisms that QDs are hepatotoxic, enterotoxic, neurotoxic, and nephrotoxic. However, the research literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. Based on a brief discussion of the properties and applications of QDs, this review introduces the release pathways related to QDs in the environment and discusses what is known related to their behavior and fate. Finally, the effects of QDs on the environment and human beings and their mechanisms are introduced. The significance of this paper is that it fills a gap in the understanding of the environmental risk assessment of QDs and provides a reference for scientists engaged in QDs research to better understand the challenges posed by the presence of QDs in the natural environment and their impact on human health.
2. Types and applications of QDs
The discovery of QDs can be traced back to the first proposal of cadmium sulfide (CdS) QDs by the American scientist Louis Bruce and the Russian scientist Alexander Efros in the early 1970s and 1980s,20 following which a series of QDs were prepared. Their diameter is usually 2–10 nm, and their structure includes a crystal core composed of various metal complexes (such as semiconductors, precious metals, and magnetic transition metals) that determine their optical properties and semiconductivity,21 and a “cover” or “shell”,1 which improves the solubility (Fig. 1). In the process of QDs synthesis, organic compound ligands including but not limited to alcohol, primary amine, carboxylic acid, mercaptan, and long-chain organic phosphate5 can be added to the surface of QDs through electrostatic interaction, adsorption, multivalent chelation, or covalent bonding to modify QDs,22 which affects their growth, morphological stability, and fluorescence properties.23–26 According to the classification of the core elements of QDs, they can be divided into QDs with heavy metals as the core (cadmium-based QDs) and those with non-heavy metals as the core (silicon (Si) QDs, graphene QDs (GQDs), and carbon dots (CDs)). The methods for classifying QDs are shown in Fig. 1, and the types, grouping, full name, abbreviation and composition of QDs involved in this review are shown in Table S1.†

In parallel to their ability to emit light of different colors in the 400 to 4000 nm wavelength range,27,28 QDs also have a narrow and symmetrical emission spectrum and a wide absorption spectrum, a huge absorption extinction coefficient, a high fluorescence quantum yield, a large Stokes shift, photochemical stability, an anti-photobleaching effect, and fluorescence intermittence,5 leading to their wide application in industry, biomedicine, and other fields (Fig. 2). In industry, the first application of QDs is for solid-state lighting and display screens, which are mainly found in televisions (TVs), computers, and mobile phone screens. The second is QD solar cells.29 Using QDs as the material for solar cells improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells, mainly through the formation of the intermediate band in the bandgap after the excitation of a single photon with sufficient energy to produce multiple excitons. Moreover, by slowing down the cooling of hot electron–hole pairs, improving the Auger recombination process and Coulomb coupling between charge carriers, and by three-dimensional restriction of carriers, the transition process does not have to satisfy momentum conservation, which improves the conversion efficiency.30 The third is QD lasers for computing and communications,29 which are the main QD devices in computer and communication systems and have the main advantages of high output power, high-temperature resistance, and stable performance.31–33 QDs have other industrial applications, such as QD detectors.

They have many excellent properties (including but not limited to size-adjustment luminescence, a narrow and symmetrical emission spectrum, a wide absorption spectrum, a huge absorption extinction coefficient, and a high fluorescence quantum yield), enabling wide application of QDs in industry and the biomedicine field. 
In biomedical fields, QDs have been widely used for applications in imaging, drug detection and delivery, medical diagnosis, photodynamic therapy, and tissue engineering. Compared with existing organic fluorescent agents, QDs have the advantages of anti-bleaching properties, good stability, a wide absorption spectrum, and high quantum yield, making them the best fluorescent materials for biomedical imaging.34,35 Currently, researchers perform biological imaging by forming complexes; for example, cadmium telluride (CdTe) QDs with red fluorescence emission are encapsulated in silica nanoparticles, and yellow fluorescence emission QDs are deposited on the surface of silica nanoparticles to form a dual-color QD-encoded nanoprobe, or conjugation of CdTe QDs with ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for imaging.36–39 QDs can also be used to diagnose cancer by detecting disease biomarkers; for example, CdTe QDs with different emission wavelengths can detect MMP-2 (a protease associated with tumor invasion and metastasis) in vitro and in vivo.40 QD-based drug delivery systems are mainly used to treat tumors and have the advantages of targeted drug delivery and high efficacy.41,42 Peptide-coated QDs and carboxylated GQDs are used to achieve targeted drug delivery.43,44 A promising application of QDs is photodynamic therapy (PDT), where QDs are applied for light-induced generation of reactive oxygen (ROS) to destroy key components of tumor cells, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), proteins, and ventricular membranes,45,46 causing tumor cell death.
3. Environmental behaviour and characteristics of QDs
3.1 Release sources of QDs in the environment
The nanomaterials industry, regulatory agencies, toxicologists, and risk assessors are able to detect the presence of QDs in the environment using the environmental substance concentration prediction model47,48 and fluorescence spectrometry.49 The effect of environmental exposure of QDs is dependent on the material zoning (e.g., air, water, soil type) as well as how the substances are produced and used, and the environmental exposure concentration is directly proportional to the half-life. In this section, we summarize the possible sources of release of QDs, bearing in mind that the sources of release of QDs are a significant factor for environmental risk assessment and taking into consideration the different types of QD products and their complete life cycles (Fig. 3).50
 Fig. 3  Release sources of QDs in the environment. Release of QDs at the stages of the chain supporting QD products (including upstream: design and production of QD materials; midstream: QD intermediate products; and downstream: QD products) and the end of product life. The light green arrow represents the whole process of the QD product industrial chain from beginning to end. At all stages of the life cycle, QDs will inevitably be released into the environment, including air, soil, and water. The gray arrow indicates the release. 
Environmental release of QDs may occur at various stages of the chain supporting QD products (including upstream: design and production of QD materials; midstream: QD intermediate products; and downstream: QD products) and disposal at the end of the product's life (Fig. 3).22,51 Upstream of the industrial chain, suppliers are mainly responsible for the design and production of QD materials. At this stage, due to material loss, the yield of synthesized QDs can be 9–90%,52–54 and it should be noted that not all the mass lost in the production process (based on yield) is actual QDs, as some of them may be precursors and other by-products;54 for example, during the synthesis of CDs, the loss from high-temperature decomposition into flue gas, or the loss of CDs during methanol or ethanol cleaning.55 Finally, the lost QDs are discharged, together with other by-products, wastewater and waste. Although, as regulators strengthen waste discharge supervision, the released wastewater and waste are treated, we cannot be sure that companies adjust the waste treatment according to the relevant laws and regulations to deal with the possible release of lost QDs. The revised data show that 0.057–1.14 metric tons of QDs are released into the environment annually through synthesis and major manufacturing activities.56–58 In addition, the biggest risk of QD release at this stage comes from accidental leakage related to the transportation of manufactured QDs from production facilities to other manufacturing sites, as in the case of package damage.
In the middle of the industrial chain, QD intermediate products, including QD light conversion film (QLCF), QD light conversion modules (QDLCM), and QD plates (QD-Plates), have also been industrialized. For example, Najingtech has an annual production capacity of 150 tons of QD materials and an annual production capacity of 4 million square meters of QD films.59 QD films and plates usually use two layers of a high-resistance diaphragm and special polymer materials to wrap QDs to form a sandwich structure.60 This is a multilayer composite material composed of pet film, the QD layer, oxygen, a water barrier layer, and nano-microstructure surface material. In the process of film-forming or plate-forming, a small number of QDs may be released due to heating, hydrolysis, and oxidation.61,62 The fabricated QD-Plates, QDLCM, and QLCF can face environmental stress due to improper storage, such as natural light irradiation, high temperature, or humidity, resulting in QD instability and release.61,62 Of course, there may also be accidental leakage caused by transportation at this stage.
Downstream of the industrial chain, after the QD-Plates, QDLCM, or QLCF is applied to the product (including LCD TVs, LCD mobile phone screens, lighting lamps, QD chips, displays, lasers, LEDs, and sensors),48 and the QDs in such products have been encapsulated in multilayer glass and plastic and are well sealed, they will not release QDs due to physical effects such as wear or scratches.61,62 However, it is difficult to be sure that this will continue to be the case if they come into contact with corrosive liquids.
At the end of the life of commercial products containing QDs, their fate is the landfill, incineration, recycling, or being simply discarded.48 By simulating a landfill environment, scientists found that equipment containing QDs with heavy metals releases soluble metals, and by detecting the concentration of soluble metals released, they predicted the concentration of QDs and found that good packaging can contribute to a low release of QDs in the landfill.62 However, with the increasing prevalence of QD products, the concentration of QDs in landfills may become higher and higher. Unlike landfills, the incineration of QD products causes the release of QDs in their initial size and form, although QDs under severe combustion may agglomerate and transform. After combustion, QDs may enter the atmosphere.63 Recycling products containing QDs can save resources and reduce environmental release, but it also involves an occupational risk of exposure for recycling personnel.64 Finally, for unmanaged waste of commercial products containing QDs, long-term physical and chemical effects in the natural environment may lead to the release of QDs into the waste stream or to environmental hazards in the natural environment.48 Importantly, in this series of processes, the synthesis, surface modification, and cleaning of cadmium-containing QDs and products containing cadmium QDs produce cadmium-containing waste. After entering groundwater and soil, this waste may have long-term adverse effects on the environment and toxicity to organisms. Notably, in addition to the industrial release, QDs are also released by medical applications and laboratory research, such as QD devices in clinical applications, medical waste caused by QD drugs, and improper treatment of waste containing QDs by scientific research institutions.
3.2 Environmental sinks of QDs
The elements and substances released during the application of QD products basically follow two ways: stored in the sink or dispersed in the environment, and many sinks will lead to the slow migration of matter.65 Therefore, it is necessary to review the environmental sink of QDs before discussing and summarizing the migration of QDs.
The dynamic environmental exposure assessment model based on material flow analysis (MFA) was applied to estimate the flows and release concentrations of QDs in seven European regions, and it was found that QDs are released by using various categories of QD products ((use release: catalyst) and (EOL release: QD chips, displays, laser, LEDs, sensors, etc.)) and existed in effluent, sludge, landfill waste, incinerated waste, bottom ash, fly ash, air, soil, surface water, and sediment.48 Therefore, the currently predicted sinks of QDs include landfill, surface water, incineration, and agricultural soil.48 Surface water is the common sink of electronic and optical equipment, medical waste, packaging materials, paper and paperboard and sensors, for example, CdSe and CdSe/ZnS QDs flow into aqueous medium due to matrix degradation or weathering in the preparation of polymer nanocomposites.51 QDs have different concentrations in different geographical regions, and the concentration range of QDs was about 9.6–530 fg L−1 in the water of EU 27, Switzerland, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Northern Europe, and South-eastern Europe in 2014,48 and the flow is mainly from the sewage of the intermediate “sink” sewage treatment plant (WWTP). A total of about 0.0057–0.456 tons per year of QDs enter the sewage treatment plant globally, and the medical release accounts for more than 50%.56 Soil is the largest environmental sink of QDs generated from the release of QDs, which is mainly caused by the arbitrary discarding of electronic products containing QDs,61,62 and a total of estimates of global emissions of about 6.0715–30.89403 tons per year of QDs entered the soil in 2021.56 However, the QDs discharged from the “intermediate sink” sewage treatment plant and stored in the sludge are much higher, and estimates of global emissions were about 55.29 tons per year in 2021.56 The landfill disposal and incineration of QD devices make the landfill another important environmental sink of QDs. During incineration, CdSe QDs are released in the form of particles, and some QDs remain in bottom ash or flue ash after incineration.63 It is reported that Paul Westerhoff et al. used the US EPA toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) SW-846 method to evaluate the potential release of QDs and their constituent metals in a landfill disposal scenario in 2019, and found that the QD display screen of the landfill released about 0.077 μg L−1 QDs, while the Amazon tablet containing CdSe QDs in the landfill released about 1.34 μg L−1 Cd in America.61
3.3 Migration of QDs in the environment
Once QDs are released into the environment, they may stay in their original environmental compartment, unchanged, or they may migrate through physicochemical action (Fig. 4). In general, nanomaterials are discharged into the atmosphere through human activities and atmospheric dry/wet deposition or exchanged between the ground surface (both surface and water) and the atmosphere. Nanomaterials in the atmosphere may also migrate and diffuse over distances with atmospheric circulation. However, QDs are not readily transported through the air,66 and there is no literature to support the presence of QDs in the atmosphere or definitive data on the atmospheric concentrations of QDs; what is known is that QDs can be transported in water and soil. QDs that enter the soil through various sources (e.g., waste landfills, degradation of QD photovoltaic panels) have limited migration through penetration of soil particle interstices, which increases when chelators are present in the soil or when the soil is degraded.67 Further, the aging of soil leads to partial degradation and transformation of QDs, which can be attributed to the decrease of the QDs' stability.67 Particles entering the subsurface environment may accumulate on various rocks and form agglomerates where the pH and ionic strength of the rock affect the size of the aggregates68 – or they may interact with natural minerals in the subsurface environment such as alumina in clay ores (mainly electrostatic versus chemisorption).69 QDs in the soil can also move out of the soil due to infiltration into the groundwater layer, entering the water body through surface/underground runoff, or being absorbed and accumulated by terrestrial organisms (including animals and plants).70 QDs entering an aquatic environment will have complex water environment behaviors. They may be dispersed and suspended stably in the water or may settle in the bottom mud due to agglomeration;71 QDs in the sediment may be resuspended due to disturbances and other reasons; and QDs in water may be transformed or degraded by physical, chemical, and biological factors. QDs before and after transformation may be absorbed by aquatic organisms, producing a biological amplification effect.72,73

3.4 Transformation of QDs in the environment
Whether QDs are dispersed in the water environment, adsorbed on the soil, or transported between compartments in different environments, they may undergo various transformations, including physicochemical interactions and interactions with macromolecules. The transformation of QDs in the environment has been reviewed, but the impact of environmental factors on QDs has not been well evaluated, and the final fate of QDs is closely related to specific environmental conditions. In the following section, we summarize the factors influencing QDs in the environment, such as ionic strength, pH value, visible light, and ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation, in an attempt to provide a basis for a comprehensive understanding of their behavior and fate in the environment (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Environmental transformation of QDs and the influence of environmental factors. After being released, QDs undergo physical and chemical transformations under the influence of various environmental factors, including light, pH, ionic strength, and NOM, resulting in changes in their properties and toxicity. 

3.4.1 The influence of pH on the environmental behaviour of QDs. 
During the industrial preparation of QDs and their release into different environments, a change in the pH value of the dispersion medium affects their optical properties, stability, and aggregation. Generally speaking, good luminescence of QDs is observed in environments with high pH values, whereas luminescence quenching of QDs is observed in environments with low pH values.74,75 When CDs prepared from starch are dissolved in different pH solutions, it is found that when the pH value is 7, their fluorescence intensity is high, which provides reference applicable conditions for their biomedical application.76 In contrast, it has also been reported that the luminescence of QDs is enhanced at acidic pH levels.77–79 For example, after improving the preparation conditions and preparing CDs with lignin, there is a change from fluorescence quenching under acidic conditions to good fluorescence characteristics and high quantum yield under acidic conditions, thus greatly expanding the application conditions80 and showing that the effect of pH values on the luminescence of QDs is related to the preparation method. Furthermore, the influence mechanism of pH values on QDs luminescence can be attributed to protonation. Specifically, with an increase in pH value, QDs neutralize excess positive charge through electrostatic action or chemical modification, providing a surface local proton pool for a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction on the surface of the QDs, resulting in a change in the ground state spectrum of the QDs.81,82 In conclusion, the influence of pH values on the fluorescence characteristics of QDs enables QDs to be used as pH-sensitive fluorescent probes.
The stability of QDs in different pH environments is contradictory. Chen et al.83 placed cadmium selenide/silica (CdSe/SiO2) QDs in environments with different pH values (pH 4.8 vs. 7.4), detected free Cd2+ by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and found no leaching, indicating that these QDs were very stable in various pH environments. However, Wang et al.84 found that a low-pH environment can lead to the loss of QD integrity and the release of free Cd2+. Therefore, the chemical composition of QDs seems to be a factor affecting the stability of QDs in a low-pH environment. The influence of pH values on the aggregation state of different QDs can be seen, on the one hand, by changing the surface charge of QDs; protonation/deprotonation is caused to make QDs aggregate. A study of the aggregation and deposition behavior of cadmium selenide/zinc sulfide (CdSe/ZnS) QDs in seawater and freshwater showed that QDs aggregated and were deposited more readily in seawater with a pH of 8, forming QD aggregates with a negative surface charge.85 Bayati et al.18 studied the effect of pH values on the aggregation of CDs in water and found that when the pH value was 9, the negatively charged CDs were well dispersed in the suspension, whereas when the pH value was low, the surface charge of the CDs increased and aggregates were formed. Li et al.86 investigated the aggregation kinetics of GQDs in an aqueous solution and found that by adjusting the pH of the solution, the surface charge of the GQDs was affected to achieve protonation/deprotonation, and complex aggregation occurred; conversely, the aggregation state can be changed by changing the interaction between QDs or between QDs and media. The protonated GQD nanoplates were interconnected into a plate-like structure that was stable in a solution with a pH of 2; however, in alkaline solutions, GQDs are isolated by electrostatic repulsion.87 In a soil environment, by simulating the aggregation, deposition, and migration processes of CDs in the subsurface environment, CDs are deposited on acanthite and form heterogeneous aggregates; the aggregation size varies with different pH values, and electron gravity dominates the interaction forces.68


3.4.2 The influence of illumination on the environmental behaviour of QDs. 
Light, including ultraviolet and natural light, can change the structure of QDs, affecting the ability of core ions to release and produce ROS and further affecting luminescence, degradation, and toxicity. Long-term UV irradiation can ameliorate the surface defects of QDs, possibly due to surface passivation and/or changes, or may accelerate the formation of ROS, form oxides on the surface, and passivate the surface state not blocked by the capping agent,88 thus affecting the luminous intensity of QDs. Importantly, the accelerated formation of rROS can cause cell damage in people when such QDs are used in biomedical applications.
Ultraviolet radiation with different intensities increases the soluble products of QDs in an aqueous solution, which may be due to the photooxidation of the C18H33 chain on the surface of the QDs by hydroxyl radicals in air to form water-soluble oxygen-containing groups, such as acids, ketones, and alcohols.19 Ultraviolet light can also lead to the degradation of QDs exposed to air, and then release free cadmium ions, destroying the stability of the QDs and increasing their toxicity.89 Natural light can cause the photodissociation of QDs. Research shows that CDs, a carbon structural material, form optically inactive carbon nanoparticles in natural sunlight, and then carry out indirect photolysis through a ˙OH reaction with natural organic matter (NOM) and other aqueous components (e.g., metal ions, nitrates, dissolved oxygen), where some of the carbon atoms are converted to volatile carbon (CO2/acetone), others are oxidized to nitro, and the remaining atoms are mineralized until the mineralization of the CDs is complete.90,91 It is important to know whether the products formed cause environmental pollution and personal injury as secondary pollutants. The researchers found that after 8 days of light, CDs degraded, in which the main mechanism is that under light irradiation, light generation of electrons and holes would occur on the surface of CDs, leading to the formation of hydroxyl and alkyl radicals and the conjugated π bonds, surface defects and functional groups of CDs may also participate in the generation of radicals, and the radicals attack CDs. After degradation, the products containing benzene, carbonyl, or hydroxyl-related structures are toxic to HEK-293, HeLa, and HepG2 cells.92 Moreover, researchers have investigated the presence of the heavy metal ions Pb2+ and Cu2+ released during the photodegradation of lead sulfide (PbS) and copper sulfide (CuS) QDs and found that heavy metal ion release is responsible for ecotoxicity, the exact mechanism of which will be discussed in section 5.93


3.4.3 The influence of natural organic matter on the environmental behaviour of QDs. 
The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) also affects the conversion of QDs. NOM is an essential factor in altering the coalescence of nanoparticles in water and their aggregation in soil. It has been demonstrated that natural organic compounds increase the stability of nanoparticles in water mainly by enhancing the spatial potential resistance between nanoparticles. It has also been observed that natural organic compounds improve the stability of nanoparticles by increasing electrostatic repulsion, which in turn reduces the coalescence rate of nanoparticles. For QDs, a luminescent nanomaterial, NOM adsorbs onto the surface of the QDs upon contact between the QDs and NOM. This adsorption is mainly through the hydrophobic interaction between the two, which affects their transport in water and the intensity of the luminescence.94–96 Humic acid, as a hard-to-degrade natural organic substance, has been shown to stabilize QDs and to play a mediating role in their conversion between environmental compartments.72,97 These studies all suggest that NOM can adsorb onto the surface of QDs, give more negative charges to QDs, and then increase the electrostatic force between particles. At the same time, NOM can also increase the spatial repulsion between particles through adsorption, and finally increase the stability and mobility of QDs.


3.4.4 The influence of ionic strength on the environmental behaviour of QDs. 
The behavior of QDs is also influenced by ionic strength. The two main cations present in most natural water are Na+ and Ca2+, therefore NaCl and CaCl2 are mostly used when studying the effect of ionic strength on QDs.98 By simulating natural water, it has been found that the deposition and transport behavior of GOQDs is mainly influenced by the concentration of NaCl, and the higher the ionic strength, the higher the deposition rate, which may be due to the increase in NaCl concentration producing an ionic bridge effect. A Na+ bridge between the hydroxyl groups on the surface of GOQDs and NaCl leads to the gradual deposition of electronegative GOQDs, a phenomenon that may be unique to carbon-based materials. When CaCl2 is present, the deposition rate is lower, which is caused by the small diffusion coefficient of CaCl2 and the existence of spatial repulsion between particles;96 moreover, the aggregation of CDs is also inhibited in the presence of CaCl2.72 However, another study showed strong aggregation of GQD nanoplates in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, and this aggregation was mainly due to the protonation/deprotonation of GQDs at different pH values, the primary charge interaction controls the self-assembly, and the coexisting Ca2+ induces the small pieces of GQDs to self-assemble into large pieces, which are then transformed into 3D structures through π–π stacking.86 The aggregation of CDs suspended in CaCl2 solution increased with increasing CaCl2 concentration due to the higher charge shielding of divalent ions than that of monovalent ions.68 The polyethylene glycol-modified (PEG-) CdSe/ZnS QDs form stable dispersions in solutions with ionic strengths ranging from 0.1 to 10 mM, and the polyethylene glycol-modified other QDs can form stable dispersions in most freshwater systems, which can be attributed to coupling with carboxylate end groups.72 It has also been shown that the stability of QDs depends on ionic composition rather than ionic strength. QDs remain stable in a KCl solution, but divalent (Mg2+&Ca2+) or trivalent (Al3+) cations can induce aggregation, probably by the reaction of multivalent metal cations (or their species) with capping ligands to form complexes that bridge the QDs or neutralize the surface charge.99 These studies indicated that ionic strength mainly affects the stability and aggregation of QDs in water; however, their conclusions are not consistent and the mechanism of influence is inconclusive; the functional groups of QDs may be one of the influencing factors.

3.5 The fate of QDs in the environment
QDs that enter or persist in the environment can be taken up by biological agents in environmental compartments, dissolved in vivo, or biomagnified and nutrient transferred. Studies have shown that QDs in the soil can enter rooted plants through nutrient absorption or water absorption.14,100,101 When QDs were exposed to bluegrass inoculated with fungi, it was found that QDs were transferred to the plant roots through the organic nitrogen absorption pathway.101 In other studies, CdSe/ZnS QDs in the soil were transported into the plant by the rooted plants onion, ryegrass, and chrysanthemum through a pulse tube through the water.14,100 QDs entering plants have different biological distributions.
Polyethylene glycol-(PEG-) COOH–CdS/ZnS QDs and mercaptopropionic acid-(MPA-) CdS/ZnS QDs were found to aggregate on the surface of taproots, lateral roots, and fibrous roots, and conjugated C–C bonds between lignin and QDs-MPA modulate this aggregation behavior.102 Moreover, compounds such as proteins, amino acids, organic acids, sugars, and phenol produced by the root may combine with or react with QDs to extinguish them.14,100 Polyacrylic acid-ethylene glycol-(PAA-EG-) coated CdSe/CdZnS QDs are relatively stable and evenly distributed in Arabidopsis leaves after uptake through petioles and roots, while polyethyleneimine-(PEI-) and anionic polymaleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene-(PMAO-PEG-) coated QDs are aggregated in Arabidopsis tissues.103 QDs in plants can be transferred through the food chain. QD fluorescence was found in the intestines of four different Lepidoptera insects,14,100 and complete QDs were found after caterpillars were fed on Arabidopsis leaves containing QDs,103 suggesting that insects ingesting water, plants, and animals containing QDs may be carriers of QDs in the environment.
The above studies show that QDs in the soil can enter rooted plants via water flow and then achieve transfer from the plant to the insect. QDs in freshwater environments can enter algal plants through pinocytosis,104,105 with a small fraction dissolving and another fraction being taken up by daphnia and mussels;105–107 QDs in microorganisms that are taken up and enter the organism have a biomagnifying effect. For example, the cadmium concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa accumulating CdSe QDs could increase by about five times after being fed into protozoan predators.108 Fungi can degrade functionalized QDs via the Fenton reaction.109 Of course, more than fungi can biodegrade QDs, human myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase expressed in neutrophils and eosinophils can biodegrade GQDs;110 CDs can also undergo peroxide catalyzed degradation in the presence of a lipase.111 However, there is no in-depth study on the evaluation of the biodegradability of QDs in life systems. QDs can also be transferred from freshwater protozoa to zooplankton and fish;112,113 similarly, the transfer of QDs from algae to marine organisms has also been found in seawater.114
4. Environmental health risks of QDs
In view of the increasing production of various QDs and the increasing possibility of their release into the environment, the subsequent impact on ecosystem health is becoming an increasingly urgent problem. To this end, it is necessary to determine the impact of QDs on various types of biota, such as plants, microorganisms, and animals, as this will provide information necessary to make ecosystem protection risk assessments.
4.1 Effect of QDs on plants

Table 1 shows some studies on the effects of QDs on soil plants. Soil-plant species have been studied more than aquatic plant species because they are not only an essential part of the soil–plant system but also producers in the biosphere. QDs in the soil can enter soil plants. Ecologists have used model crops (e.g., Arabidopsis, Allium cepa L., Tobacco) to study the impacts of QDs that enter soil plants, and the impacts can be divided into negative and positive effects. Most ecotoxicity studies have considered the following four aspects: 1. behavior and state of QDs in plants (adsorption, transport, and aggregation);115–117 2. alteration of plant organ structure;118,119 3. inhibition of respiratory efficiency and photosynthesis;120,121 3. oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.120,122 The absorption of QDs by plant roots has been proven to be an important way for QDs to be exposed through the food chain.

The distribution of QDs in plants can be determined by detecting the fluorescence of different parts of plants or detecting the distribution of elements,103,123,124 and it has been found that after exposure to QDs of white mustard, Arabidopsis, Allium cepa L., wheat seedling, and soybean, the QDs are adsorbed or accumulated in the roots.103,115–117,120,121,123 The entry of QDs into plant roots leads to root deformation, swelling, and fracture, which may be caused by root blockages caused by the entry of QDs into the root epidermis.115,120 Cadmium-based QDs will release cadmium into plants, and cadmium is mainly accumulated in plant roots.125 QDs flowing into the root can also continue to be transported to the leaves through the conduit, resulting in yellowing103 of leaves or other tissues, causing structural changes and affecting plant development; for example, PAS-CdSe QDs can adhere to the plant, resulting in the reduction of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm.116 Chlorophyll is an important part of photosynthesis. After soil plants come into contact with heavy metal QDs, studies have found that chlorophyll generally decreases.120,121 The consequence of this decrease is that plant photosynthesis is affected, followed by plant growth and development.
Plants have complex antioxidant defense systems to protect against oxidative stress, including antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). O2− existing in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, and cell wall of subcellular organelles is reduced to H2O2. Then, H2O2 participates in the redox reaction to form H2O, that is, oxidative stress occurs in plants exposed to QDs.122 The oxidative stress of soil plants caused by heavy metal QDs is a typical consequence of the interaction between nanoparticles and plants. This is mainly due to the release of heavy metals producing ROS, leading to lipid peroxidation, which is manifested in the decrease in SOD and the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition to the conventional research scheme, modern science can also use the omics method to study the ecotoxicity of QDs. The metabolites and gene expression in soybean tissue exposed to 200 mg L−1 have been analyzed using proteomics. It was found that the metabolic pathways, such as glutathione metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid acid and amino acids, were disturbed.117 This proteomics and metabolite spectroscopy can provide a perspective on the mechanism of its complex process. The positive effects of QDs on plants are mainly reflected in the promotion of growth. For example, CDs can promote the growth of cabbage126 and the photosynthesis and drought resistance of mung bean and tobacco mung beans,127,128 and SiQDs129 can improve the root water absorption of cucumber seedlings and promote the growth of cucumber seedlings. This may be because QDs lead to the overexpression of aquaporins, which improves the growth rate, transpiration rate, stomatal density, and photosynthetic efficiency, or because good dispersion of QDs promotes plant cell differentiation.
The research on QDs in aquatic plants and marine plants focuses on algae (Table 2). Algae are primary producers in the aquatic food chain and play an important role in the stability and functioning of the ecosystem structure. The cell wall is the main barrier of algal cells and can protect cells from the internalization of pollutants (including nanoparticles). This is because the pore size of the algal cell wall is usually 5–20 nm.9 Although QDs are small, the hydrodynamics may be larger than the pore size of the cell wall; that is, their aggregation in water will affect the interaction with algae.141 Algae can be used as a carrier of toxic metals and transport them into the body. QDs can produce several recognized different effects on algae,8 such as growth inhibition,142 decreased photosynthesis,143 oxidative stress,122,144,145 and decreased metabolism.146 However, a study has concluded that low-dose QDs can promote algae growth, which is hidden in the toxic excitation effect.144 Several studies have found that QDs reduce the content of chlorophyll in algae,122,145,146 mainly because the toxicity of QDs reduces the production of chlorophyll after cell fragmentation. The effects of QDs on algae are related to their nano characteristics, the composition and structure of cell walls, and the species of algae. The secretion of algae will, in turn, affect the behavior and stability of QDs.9 Algae also have nutrient transfer and biomagnification properties,104,105,147 as discussed above.

4.2 Effect of QDs on microorganisms, microbial communities and microbial community functions
The study of the impact of QDs on microorganisms is crucial because microorganisms are the decomposers of ecosystems, breaking down complex organic matter into simple inorganic matter and returning the inorganic matter to the abiotic environment for reuse by green plants, i.e., they play an irreplaceable role in the material cycle of ecosystems. Research has examined the interactions between microorganisms (including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and some small protozoa) and QDs. Bacteria are single-cell prokaryotes and are ubiquitous. They are the primary tool for assessing the environmental impact of environmental nanoparticles.154 Due to the lack of a phagocytosis mechanism, bacteria cannot ingest uncoated QDs.155 However, QDs can be absorbed into the body of bacteria after functionalization. The effect of QDs on bacteria is reflected in the inhibition of their growth rate, increase in death rate,15,156 production of excessive ROS, and lipid peroxidation, resulting in oxidative damage.157 This makes QDs an alternative material for sterilization and disinfection; QDs can also be used to label and detect bacteria to provide a reference for the composition of bacteria.
Protozoa are single-cell eukaryotes and can be used to evaluate the nutrient transfer of nanomaterials. There is little data on the ecotoxicity of QDs to protozoa: among ciliated protozoa, only the effects on Tetrahymena thermophila and cyanidin long shrimp have been studied. Studies have shown that protozoa mainly ingest QDs through endocytosis and phagocytosis.108 QDs accumulate, transfer nutrients, and biomagnify in protozoa. The biomagnification effect is related to the clearance rate. The effect of QDs on fungi is different from that of protozoa.158 It is mainly adsorbed on the surface of fungi and can lead to decreased cell viability, cell wall damage, and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. The type of QD, shell/coating, culture medium, and exposure conditions all affect their toxicity.85 The effects of CdS QDs on Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied using omics, and it was found that the gene changes related to stress response, the metabolic process, mitochondrial tissue, transport, and the DNA repair pathway were related to the nano characteristics of QDs.159
We have understood the effects of QDs on individual microorganisms; nevertheless, microorganisms in the natural environment usually co-exist and communicate with each other in the form of sophisticated communities.160,161 Microbial communities are part of natural ecosystems and play an important role in biogeochemical cycles.162 In recent years, engineered nanomaterials have been considered to present a substantial potential risk to the normal function of microbial communities in both natural and engineered ecosystems.163–165 Most studies in the elucidation of the effects of engineered nanomaterials on microbial communities have focused on the changes in microbial community composition.163–165 Commonly used analytical techniques include PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE),166,167 T-RFLP, quantitative real-time PCR,168,169 phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis,170–172 functional multisubstrate induced respiration (MSIR) analysis,173,174 and Catalyzed Reporter Deposition (CARDFISH).175 Although PCR-DGGE is still the most widely used tool for community analysis, there is a general trend to apply sequencing and omics technologies to study the effects of engineered nanomaterials on microbial communities.176
There are only a few studies based on the effect of QDs on microbial community diversity; for example, CdSe/ZnS QDs had little effect on the diversity of soil microbial community structure.177 However, it is worth noting the impact of heavy metals such as As, Cu, Cd, Zn and Pb leaked from QDs on the microbial community. Metal contamination reduced the biomass, activity and diversity of microorganisms. Soil ATP concentration is an essential and effective index for assessing soil microbial biomass.178 Liu et al. have demonstrated that soil ATP concentration decreased, and bacterial and fungal communities were altered when the metal trace elements Cd, Cu, and Zn increased in the soil.179 Sheik et al. studied the concentration of soil microbial community by pyrophosphate sequencing and found that the abundance of microbial communities in the soil polluted by Cr decreased significantly.180 In addition, scientists have analyzed heavy metal stress through soil and plant microbiomics. For example, a study reported the effect of heavy metal contamination on the abundance and composition of bacterial communities in Portugal, where most of the altered species belonged to Actinobacteria, thick-walled bacteria and Aspergillus, and the main species belonged to Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter and Bacillus.181 In short, QDs reduce the diversity and abundance of microbial communities, and there are data gaps, such as the lack of omics research results, which is also the direction of future development.
Whether exposure to QDs affects microbial ecological functions, including nitrogen fixation, denitrification and methanogenesis, is another important aspect that has been relatively less explored. When Pseudomonas stutzeri is exposed to PMAO-QDs, PEI-QDs, and COOH-QDs, the denitrification gene is up-regulated, which speeds up the denitrification activity and affects its denitrification reaction;182 when nitrifying bacteria (i.e., Nitrosomonas europaea), nitrogen fixation bacteria (i.e., Azotobacter vinelandii, Rhizobium etli, and Azospirillum lipoferum) and denitrifying bacteria (i.e., Pseudomonas stutzeri) are exposed to QDs, nitrifying bacteria are more susceptible.183 Another study found that CDs enhanced the nitrogen fixation activity of Azotobacter chroococcum, mainly because CDs were bound to nitrogenase, affecting the secondary structure of nitrogenase and improving the electron transfer in the biocatalytic process.184 However, the effect is unlikely to be felt outside the local scope, because the frequency and concentration of QDs released into the environment are unlikely to reach a level sufficient to significantly affect the global nitrogen cycle and climate change.183 In addition, CDs have a positive effect on methane production by anaerobic digestion. After adding 5 g L−1 Zn doped CDs, the CH4 yield of ethanol increased by 24.59%, while adding 5 g L−1 N doped CDs, the CH4 yield of ethanol significantly increased by 230%, which was mainly due to promotion of electron transfer.185 As a nano photocatalyst, ZnO–ZnS/Ag2O–Ag2S decomposes waste-activated sludge and increases methane production by 54% through anaerobic digestion.186 We cannot help but ask whether QDs as photocatalysts can achieve methanogenesis. Another study told us the answer that Rhodopseudomonas palustris hybridized with CdS QDs without significant damage, and its biomethanation performance was improved by about 79% compared to bare cells.187 To sum up, QDs have an impact on microbial ecological functions, but there is a data gap. For example, the impact of QDs on carbon fixation has not been studied, so it is necessary to carry out further and more comprehensive research.
4.3 Toxicity of QDs in animal studies
QDs can accumulate in the bodies of mammals in the terrestrial environment through feeding or nutrient transfer,14,100 resulting in toxicity to them. At present, toxicologists mainly use mice and rats to evaluate the toxicity of QDs; Tables 3 and 4 summarize some studies on the toxicity of QDs using mice and rats since 2017. Using “QDs”, “toxicity”, and “mice” as subject keywords, more than 150 relevant studies published since 2017 were found in the Web of Science database. Considering the possible actual contact modes of QDs in different scenarios, the exposure methods used in these studies included oral administration,188–191 tracheal inhalation,192–194 and injection,188,195,196 with different exposure methods leading to different accumulation sites. Intravenously administered QDs were found to accumulate mainly in the liver and kidney, while subcutaneously administered QDs were found to more easily accumulate in lymph nodes, and QDs administered by oral exposure was found to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract. Oral administration studies show that ingestion of different types and doses of QDs has different effects on different tissues, but they mainly cause damage to the intestine. One study showed that oral administration of GQDs can lead to intestinal injury in mice, including enhanced intestinal permeability, shortening of villi, and the disappearance of the recess.189 However, QDs did not accumulate in the testis and epididymis, which may be because the mice excreted the QDs through urine and/or feces.188

High-dose oral administration of CdTe QDs leads to intestinal tissue damage, while medium- and low-dose oral administration of CdTe QDs leads to changes in the structure of intestinal microbiota.191 However, a study has shown that oral QDs do not cause any damage to the intestine.190 Inhalation exposure to nanomaterials has potential effects on lung function. The inhaled QDs can enter the circulation through the blood–gas barrier and accumulate in the lungs, causing alveolar septal congestion.194 After mice were exposed to QDs at occupational-related doses, they developed acute pneumonia and impaired pulmonary dynamics.192 In addition, QDs exposure of dust mites can exacerbate allergic airway diseases.193 QDs injected intravenously into a mouse model first interact with blood and its components.197 Subsequently, the QDs are quickly removed by the blood, although the removal time can vary.195,198 According to a report, the blood half-life of QDs of different sizes varies greatly, ranging from 48 minutes to 20 hours.199 The remaining QDs enter the body fluid circulation with the flow of fluid bodies, targeting the distribution and accumulation in different tissues and organs; they can accumulate in the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, testis, and brain,195,196,200 causing hepatotoxicity,201–203 reproductive toxicity,204–210 immunotoxicity,211,212 and neurotoxicity.213–219 The mechanism will be summarized in section 5.
The main model animals that have recently been used in the study of QD toxicity are zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans. Zebrafish, as aquatic animals, are small and simple to handle, highly fertile, and fast-developing with short test cycles; they have transparent embryos, their organs and tissues are easily visualized, and they have high genetic homology with humans, allowing them to be used for genetic and chemical screening.238–240 Zebrafish were applied to evaluate the bioaccumulation, embryotoxicity, developmental toxicity, and genotoxicity of QDs (Table 5).241–244 The data indicate that QDs are absorbed and bioaccumulated in zebrafish embryos, larvae, and adults and subsequently become developmentally toxic, as evidenced by reduced survival, hatchability, and motility (shorter total travel, reduced movement speed, etc.) in fish.245–247 The reduced motility may be due to the Ca2+-ATPase and Na+/K+-enzymes, which are closely linked to energy supply and motility,245,248 or related to the change of oxidative stress state of embryos.249–255

The magnitude of QDs toxicity correlates with surface functionalization and can greatly affect embryos and larvae.256 COOH–CdSe/ZnS QDs have a higher effect on cardiac development than aminated and PEG-QDs but QDs are less toxic to multiple organ development, possibly due to the positively charged amino group protonation resulting in reduced uptake and toxicity.245,247,257 The consensus view on the bioaccumulation of QDs demonstrates that QDs in fish embryos mainly gather on the surface of the chorion, and the integrity of the chorion is damaged, which has an adverse impact on embryonic development.252,258–260 When QDs spread through the chorionic pore channels of the embryo, they are deposited in the retina, brain, heart, gills, and behind the tail, causing malformations of the heart, respiratory system, and head.260 QDs in the fish gut are mainly introduced by ingestion and spread further to other parts of the body, causing organ toxicity.261–263

Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a free-living soil nematode that usually feeds on bacteria, has a short life cycle, a transparent, hermaphroditic body, and a high reproductive capacity, and has been used to study nanotoxicology.271Table 6 summarizes studies published since 2017 on the effects of QDs on nematodes. C. elegans are primarily exposed to QDs by feeding. When C. elegans are exposed for a short duration, QDs can be ingested into the alimentary tract, fill the pharynx, travel through the intestinal tract, and exit the organism through the anus and vulva, with a few remaining in the digestive and reproductive systems.272–274 However, when exposed for a long time, QDs are engulfed by the intestinal cells. Once inside the organism, QDs are mainly found in the pharynx and small intestine, with QDs also accumulating in parts of the rest of the body, such as the nematode head, anterior muscles, and tail. Internalized QDs are distributed in the pharynx, intestinal lumen, and enterocytes, and internalization is proportional to the concentration of QDs exposed.272–275 Based on the uptake and distribution of QDs in C. elegans, enterotoxicity is the primary toxic effect of concern for C. elegans caused by QDs. When C. elegans are exposed to GOQDs, the physiological function of the intestinal barrier is dysfunctional, pathological changes such as increased defecation cycle length and increased intestinal fat are observed, and genes are required for intestinal development and defecation behavior are altered. Furthermore, GQDs can be transferred into the enterocyte in the absence of intestinal microvilli and distributed near or around intracellular mitochondria.276,277

Long term exposure (OP50)





C. elegans is also a useful experimental model for investigating neurotoxicity, as an adult C. elegans has 302 neurons and 7000 synapses, belonging to two distinct and separate nervous systems. Exposure to high concentrations of QDs over a long period results in abnormal foraging behavior, slows down the locomotor behavior of the nematode, reduces learning and memory capacity, and leads to developmental and functional impairment and reduced lifespan of motor neurons in RMEs.275,278 QDs can also cause reproductive toxicity in C. elegans. The nematodes are divided into hermaphrodites and males, and studies have shown that exposure to QDs is reproductively toxic to hermaphroditic nematodes. The transfer of QDs from the digestive system to the nematode's uterus and vulva, often under prolonged exposure conditions, results in early egg-laying, increased egg-laying mortality, and egg-laying defects, which may be associated with QDs disrupting specific motor neurons that control the contraction of the nematode's egg-laying activity.274,279 In addition, prolonged exposure to QDs leads to reproductive defects in wild-type nematodes, dysregulated proliferation and differentiation of germ cells, abnormal meiosis, reduced production and expulsion of fertilized eggs, and reduced brood size and egg production rates, resulting in an oogenesis imbalance.274
4.4 Factors affecting the toxicity of QDs
QDs have a small size effect, quantum effect, and surface effect. The toxic effect is mainly affected by the size, composition, surface charge, surface modification, and other factors.
The size of QDs is much smaller than that of cells, which easily enter cells or various organelles, and small changes in size may affect the toxic effect of QDs, so size is one of the factors affecting toxicity. Generally, small-size QDs are more toxic.280 After L929 cells were exposed to MPA-CdTe QDs of 2.2 nm and 3.5 nm, it was found that the oxidative stress, apoptosis and DNA damage caused by MPA-CdTe QDs of 2.2 nm were significantly higher than those of MPA CdTe QDs greater than 3.5 nm, and the reason may be that small-size CdTe QDs can enter the nucleus and cause DNA damage, while large-size CdTe QDs are basically distributed only in the cytoplasm,281 which is consistent with the research conclusion of Chang et al.282 The chemical composition of QDs is another important factor affecting their toxicity. At present, it is believed that the toxicity of heavy metal QDs represented by cadmium-based QDs is significantly higher than that without heavy metals, which may be related to the leakage of heavy metals.283 Liu et al. found that the contents of CdTe QDs and Cd2+ in cells increased in a time and dose-dependent manner, and the oxidative stress and apoptosis were mainly attributed to the toxicity of Cd2+.284 A common measure to reduce its toxicity is to add a shell to slow the release of cadmium and other metal ions from the core.285 The surface charge of QDs is also an important factor affecting their toxicity. The more surface charge QDs carry, the greater the zeta potential, and the more stable the QDs are, and the toxicity of positively charged QDs is greater than that of negatively charged QDs.286,287 Surface modification can affect the toxic effect of QDs by acting on different targets.288–291 Compared with 2-mercaptoacetic acid–(TGA-) CdTe QDs, MPA-QDs have a stronger effect on mitochondrial MPT because TGA-CdTe QDs have better stability, so the amount of Cd2+ released is lower and the toxicity is also lower,288,290 which explains the difference in the damage of subcellular organelles by QD modification. Both carboxyl and amino-modified CdSe/ZnS QDs reduced the survival rate, hatching rate, and embryo movement of zebrafish, but COOH–CdSe/ZnS QDs were more toxic, which may be due to the higher affinity and release of carboxyl groups to embryos and larvae.247 Finally, environmental factors can also affect the toxicity of QDs, which we have reviewed in section 3. It should be noted that the release of QDs' core metal caused by environmental factors may reduce their bioavailability.97,292
5. Toxicity mechanism of QDs
According to the existing research results, the main mechanism of QD-induced toxicity involves the release of heavy metal ions, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and DNA damage, eventually leading to cell death. These mechanisms do not stand alone but are interrelated (Fig. 6).
 Fig. 6  Toxicity mechanisms of QDs. The nano characteristics of QDs or the release of heavy metal ions lead to the excessive production of ROS, which leads to oxidative stress, cell DNA damage, inflammation, and death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy) through different signal pathways. 
5.1 Release of heavy metal ions
The release of heavy metal ions is closely related to the toxicity of QDs. Cadmium-based QDs, which are sometimes referred to as first-generation QDs, are the most commonly used QDs. Long-term exposure to the environment or human body may release Cd2+ due to degradation and biological oxidation; the release rate is related to time, concentration, environmental pH, type of QDs, and other factors.294 During the preparation of QDs, cadmium ions may be closely adsorbed onto the surface of QDs and then released into the environment or organisms.285 As cadmium is a primary carcinogen recognized by the International Center for Cancer Research, toxicologists have long paid attention to the relationship between QDs toxicity and Cd2+ release. By setting a CdCl2 control group, it was found that the toxicity of CdTe QDs is greater than that of CdCl2 when releasing the same concentration of Cd2+, which indicates that the toxic effect of QDs is related to Cd2+.295 Taking primary hepatocytes as the biological model, it was found that surface oxidation leads to cadmium ion release and cell death of CdSe QDs, which is due to the sulfhydryl binding of cadmium and key mitochondrial proteins. Sulfhydryl inactivation leads to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to liver injury.89 Cd2+ acts directly on DNA, such as by binding with the phosphoric acid and base in DNA molecules, causing harm to the body. Cd2+ can also replace iron and copper on the cytoplasm and cell membrane, further leading to lipid peroxidation through the Fenton reaction, causing the destruction of the cell membrane or mitochondrial membrane and leading to cell apoptosis.296 In conclusion, cell damage is related to the release of heavy metal ions. Based on this theory, researchers have begun to use core–shell protective structures to prevent Cd2+ from escaping from QDs and to reduce their cytotoxicity. The research shows that the coating of the shell can effectively prevent the release of Cd2+ and improve histocompatibility.297–299 In a certain range, the more shell, the lower the toxicity.300 Interestingly, when the shell is too thin, although the release of Cd2+ from QDs may be reduced under neutral conditions after QDs enter the cell, the acidity in lysosomes and other organelles increases and the dissociation rate of Cd2+ from QDs increases significantly, resulting in higher cytotoxicity.201,301
5.2 Oxidative stress and production of ROS
Living organisms have significant oxidative and antioxidant systems for maintaining oxidative homeostasis. The antioxidant system is composed of enzymes and non-enzymes, the non-enzymes being glutathione (GSH) and vitamins, and the enzymes being SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and CAT. Under stimulation by adverse conditions, the cellular antioxidant capacity is weakened and the redox balance is disrupted, leading to oxidative stress, which can mediate organelle damage and lead to cell death. Studies have identified oxidative stress as one of the toxicity mechanisms of QDs and cadmium-based QDs have been shown to cause excessive accumulation of ROS, indirectly triggering adverse outcomes.302–305 CdTe QDs can trigger mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes via ROS, leading to apoptosis,306 and CdSe/ZnS QDs can lead to ROS accumulation, altered phagocytosis, and increased apoptosis in macrophages.211 The excessive accumulation of ROS generated by QDs which can mediate not only the induction of apoptosis but also other forms of ROS-mediated cell death can also be triggered, such as autophagy,307–312 inflammation,201,203,216,313–316 pyroptosis,203,214,316 necrosis,317–319 and ferroptosis.320
The uptake of CdTe/CdS QDs and their internalization into lysosomes results in abnormal activation of lysosomal enzymes, leading to excessive production of ROS and activation of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy significantly mitigates the cytotoxicity of QDs, whereas autophagy induced by N-CDs at high concentrations (i.e., 400 μg mL−1) increases their cytotoxicity after inhibition with 3-MA,307,312 illustrating that autophagy is a double-edged sword. CdSe/ZnS, CdTe, CdTe@ZnS, and MoS2 QDs make cells produce excessive ROS, converting the inactive precursor of Caspase-1 into an activated form by activating NLRP3 inflammatory vesicles on cells and leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and finally to the production of Caspase-1-dependent cellular pyroptosis.203,214,316 Notably, there is only one reported case of QD-induced ferroptosis in the literature, where N-GQDs led to cytoplasmic iron overload in microglia, GSH depletion, excess ROS production, and lipid peroxidation (LPO), a typical hallmark of ferroptosis. Application of the mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger Mito TEMPO treatment revealed that ferroptosis was reversed, indicating an increase in ROS in the mitochondria due to mitochondrial oxidative stress, resulting in ferroptosis. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the production of mitochondrial ROS in addition to total ROS.320 The above is a consequence of the persistence of oxidative stress in the organism. In contrast, when a low concentration of QDs causes oxidative stress, the cells first protect the organism and adapt to the adverse environment through a compensatory response, for example, by increasing GSH synthesis, which is a survival mechanism.
5.3 Inflammatory reaction
Inflammation is an organism's reaction to defend against both endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Macrophages are the first line of defense following the intrusion. They can be mobilized to secure several cytokines, including interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokines, and are mediated by a multitude of signaling pathways. At the cellular level, normal forms of inflammation are productive, while excessive inflammation can lead to cell death. Studies have shown that QDs can cause inflammatory reactions in the liver,201,203,321,322 kidney,323,324 and lung,325–327 which is related to the mode of contact with QDs. QDs entering the body can also cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the nervous system to trigger an inflammatory reaction of neuromicroglia.214,316 The inflammation induced by QDs is closely related to the NLRP3 inflammasome. In microglia, after an NLRP3 inflammatory activation, pre-IL-1β expression mediates NF-κB and leads to Caspase-1 activation and pre-IL-1β transforms into mature IL-1β201 and causes inflammatory cell death.214,316 MPA CdTe QDs significantly secrete pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β after exposure to BV-2 microglia.314 In this inflammatory mechanism, the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB-signaling pathway is first activated and then promotes pre-IL-1β, and then NLRP3 is activated to cleave to Caspase 1 and IL-1β matures.314 In this process, it was found that ROS were highly induced with the activation of NLRP3, but the upstream and downstream relationships between ROS and inflammation need to be further studied. Another study showed that water-soluble CdTe QDs could block IKK α and IKK β kinase, inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce the inflammatory response.328 This effect is noteworthy. For example, ZnO QDs have an anti-inflammatory effect and are applied for sterilization and anti-inflammatory uses. In a report on inflammatory reactions caused by cadmium-free metal QDs, it was found that both Ag2Se QDs and MoS2 QDs can activate NLRP3 inflammatory bodies on microglia, and MoS2 QDs can further lead to focal death.313,329 Many cadmium-free metal QDs containing heavy metals can, like cadmium-based QDs, cause inflammation, but the degree of the former is much lower than that of the latter.
5.4 DNA damage
The explanatory rationale for the toxic mechanism of action of QDs may be their induced genotoxicity, i.e., DNA damage. Currently, the comet assay is the most commonly used method to detect cellular DNA damage, usually using indicators such as comet tail length, tail DNA content, tail moment, and Olive tail moment to reflect DNA damage, which can be found to be increased in data from studies on QD-induced cellular DNA damage.281,330,331 The DNA damage caused by QDs is reflected by DNA base damage,332 DNA single-strand breaks,333 double-strand breaks,332 increased DNA degradation,334 and so on. This damage can also cause cell cycle changes.314 A study also showed that UV-C radiation enhances the effect on DNA.334
In summary, QDs can cause damage to cellular DNA in concert with environmental effects, but the mechanisms of DNA damage have not yet been sufficiently explored, and no reports have been made of QDs affecting DNA repair.
6. Summary, outlook, and future needs
As a new light-emitting material, QDs are widely used in medicine and industry, and related industries are flourishing. During the development and rapid commercialization of QDs, it is crucial to fully understand their environmental and health-safety impacts. The current review emphasizes the significance of the release and migration of QDs and the effects of environmental factors on QDs (alterations in physicochemical properties, bioavailability, and increased release of toxic metal ions), systematically describes the risks of exposure of different organisms to QDs, and summarizes the toxicity mechanisms of QDs in an effort to better understand the environmental behavior and environmental change characteristics of QDs and to provide a reference for conducting an environmental health risk assessment of QDs. QDs may be released into terrestrial and aqueous environments during the industrial chain and at the end-of-life stage and then migrate and transform in different environmental compartments. The transformed nanoparticles have different surface properties and toxicity from the original particles. Upon entering the environment, QDs biomagnify within the food chain, posing ecological risks to microorganisms, plants, and animals.
Although many studies have investigated the transformation and ecotoxicity of QDs in the environment, there are various knowledge gaps and challenges in assessing the environmental exposures and environmental health risks of QDs. For example, at present, there is a serious lack of research on the impact of microbial community and function, which is an important part of ecotoxicity assessment and should be paid attention to. Environmental health risk assessment focuses on understanding the nature of environmental exposure (exposure concentration, exposure duration). Due to technical limitations, the actual environmental concentrations are inconclusive. Therefore, there is a need to develop new instruments capable of monitoring and analyzing (including real-time integrated assessment of multiple exposures, as well as dynamic assessment with high temporal and quantitative resolution) the actual concentration of QDs in the natural environment.
The present literature review has shown that although the hazard assessment of QDs has matured and that there are an increasing number of studies on the potential impact of QDs on life systems, there are data still missing. This means that toxicity cannot be predicted based on the characteristics of QD materials alone. Therefore, we hope to use the QDs library or strictly characterized QDs to reveal the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) in an ideal situation. In addition, moving from describing toxicology to predicting toxicology is a major step in human technological progress.
Scientists can predict the physical and chemical properties of QDs through high-throughput screening or identify molecular initiation events and key events at the tissue level through omics methods, so as to establish the AOPs of QDs. In addition, the toxicity and toxicity mechanisms of QDs after environmental transformation are not clear. Further research is needed to clarify the impact of the transformation process on the toxicity of original QDs and the difference in the toxic effects between original QDs and their transformation products. Moreover, the mixed exposure in the “real world” differs from the biological effects of individual exposure in the laboratory environment. The synergistic effects of QDs and hazardous substances in landfills such as lead, nickel, zinc, tin, antimony, beryllium, and copper should not be ignored. Finally, green nanoscience should become the goal in the application of QD products. There should be a commitment to eliminating harm in their life cycle or reducing the sense of insecurity in the application of QDs by designing and processing QDs with better environmental protection characteristics.

Environmental significance
Quantum dots (QDs) are high-performance fluorescent nanomaterials with a wide range of applications in the biomedical and electronics industries. Despite the recent significant interest in studying the toxicity mechanisms of QDs, little is known about the sources of environmental exposure, transport, transformation, and effects of environmental factors on their properties, and the ecotoxicity of QDs has not been elucidated. The knowledge gap hinders risk assessment. This review describes the possible sources, transport, transformation and ultimate fate of QDs in the environment and their effects on biology, and suggests requirements for future QD risk assessment: developing new monitoring tools to determine specific concentrations; shifting from descriptive to predictive toxicology; and studying the synergistic effects of real-world QDs and different substances.


 	Fig. 1  Structure and classification of QDs. Illustration of the basic structure of QDs and the classification basis and content of QDs.	 

 	Fig. 2  The superior performance and applications of QDs. They have many excellent properties (including but not limited to size-adjustment luminescence, a narrow and symmetrical emission spectrum, a wide absorption spectrum, a huge absorption extinction coefficient, and a high fluorescence quantum yield), enabling wide application of QDs in industry and the biomedicine field.	 

 	Fig. 3  Release sources of QDs in the environment. Release of QDs at the stages of the chain supporting QD products (including upstream: design and production of QD materials; midstream: QD intermediate products; and downstream: QD products) and the end of product life. The light green arrow represents the whole process of the QD product industrial chain from beginning to end. At all stages of the life cycle, QDs will inevitably be released into the environment, including air, soil, and water. The gray arrow indicates the release.	 

 	Fig. 4  Migration of QDs in the environment. QDs migrate and biomagnify in different environmental compartments, including air, soil, and water. The black arrow represents the migration direction of QDs.	 

 	Fig. 5  Environmental transformation of QDs and the influence of environmental factors. After being released, QDs undergo physical and chemical transformations under the influence of various environmental factors, including light, pH, ionic strength, and NOM, resulting in changes in their properties and toxicity.
