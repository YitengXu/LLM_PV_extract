    , Accepted 24th March 2009First published on 21st April 2009AbstractA new series of tridentate bipyridine pyrazolate coupled Ru(II) complexes CK1, CK2, HY1 and HY2 were strategically designed and synthesized. In comparison to N719, CK2 and HY2 achieved the original proposal of obtaining an absorption extinction coefficient ranging from 350 to ∼550 nm, accompanied by lowering of the lowest lying energy gap. These advantages allow us to reduce the thickness of the TiO2 layer, resulting in great suppression of the dark current and hence an increase of Voc. Upon optimization, HY2 attained η = 8.07, Jsc = 15.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 753 mV and FF = 0.678, the results of which are equivalent to that of N719 (η = 8.02, Jsc = 15.70 mA cm−2, Voc = 765 mV and FF = 0.668) maximized in this study.
Introduction
Owing to their versatility and low cost,1dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered practically as a feasible alternative to conventional amorphous silicon solar cells. Typical DSSCs consist of a TiO2 semiconductor electrode chemisorbed with sensitizers, a Pt doped counter electrode and an I−/I3−redox mediator immersed in an electrolyte solution. From a chemistry viewpoint, numerous organic and organometallic sensitizers have been designed and synthesized, among which the most common sensitizers should be ascribed to cis-dithiocyanato bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) and trithiocyanato-4,4′,4″-tricarboxy-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine ruthenium(II) complexes, known as N3 and black dye, respectively.2,3 However, numerous other Ru(II) metal-containing di- (tri-) carboxy bipyridine (terpyridine) based sensitizers, which were reported to have decent efficiency and/or latent potential for further expansion, have also been well documented.4–9
Recently, we reported a new family of ruthenium complexes suited for DSSC applications.10 The core design lies in the introduction of a novel tridentate bipyridine pyrazolate (bpz) ligand, while the bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) bidentate is retained to ensure the same electron ejection site as that of e.g.N3. A prototype can be referred to complex 1 depicted in Scheme 1. Due to the strong σ-donor property of the pyrazolate unit, the concomitant tridentate binding properties offered by the bpz ligand render a more stable complexation than that of the terpyridine moiety on a similar ruthenium platform.11 This, together with the good π-accepting ability of the second pyridyl fragment, provides a synergistic electron delocalization over the ligand π conjugation and metal dπ orbitals, hence an extension of the lower lying absorption to the red. Unfortunately, the associated lower absorption extinction coefficient made 1 inferior to N3 in terms of conversion efficiency (η) and IPCE performance.10b Nevertheless, the great thermal and light-soaking stability of 1 warrant future expansion, in that rational modification of the bpz ligand may lead to a new series of sensitizers possessing superior stability and conversion efficiency.
 Scheme 1  Structural drawing of various tridentate bipyridine pyrazolate coupled Ru(II) complexes 
To achieve the above goal, we redesigned intuitively the framework of 1 so that the trident bpz was functionalized by carboxylic groups. Due to the greater π-electron conjugation, the carboxylic groups attached to the bpz moiety were expected to cause further red-shift (cf.1), mainly contributing to the lower lying states for coupled TiO2. In light of its chemical versatility, the ancillary 2,2′-bipyridine motif is then modified with the aim of greatly enhancing the absorptivity in the higher-lying electronic states (e.g. 350–550 nm). This combination should enhance the entire visible absorption extinction coefficient, as well as extend the absorption to presumably near infrared. In accord with this strategy, a new series of Ru-bpz complexes, CK and HY (see Scheme 1), which are structurally different in their number of carboxylic groups anchored at bpz, are synthesized, among which HY2 proved to be superior to N719 (bis(tetrabutylammonium)-cis-di(thiocyanato)-N,N-bis(4-carboxylato-4′-carboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium(II)) in terms of Jsc and hence the conversion efficiency. Details of our results and the corresponding discussion are elaborated in the following sections.
Experimental
General procedures
All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. All reactions were monitored using pre-coated TLC plates (0.20 mm with fluorescent indicator UV254). Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL SX-102A instrument operating in electron impact (EI) or fast atom bombardment (FAB) mode. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury-400 or an INOVA-500 instrument. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Heraeus CHN-O Rapid Elementary Analyzer. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-570 UV/Vis/NIR.
Materials
Commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 were prepared by heating of RuCl3·hydrate with phellandrene in methanol.12 Following the procedures documented in the literature,13[(bpy)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl and [(MS-bpy)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl were prepared by reacting [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 with 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) and 4,4′-bis(4-methoxystyryl)-2,2′-bipyridine (MS-bpy), respectively. The monomethyl substituted tridentate pyrazole (2a) was prepared according to the procedures documented in literature,14 while the respective dimethyl substituted (2b) was prepared from Claisen condensation employing 4,4′-dimethyl-6-acetyl-2,2′-bipyridine and CF3CO2Et, followed by treatment with hydrazine hydrate in refluxing ethanol solution, for which the corresponding 4,4′-dimethyl-6-acetyl-2,2′-bipyridine was prepared employing 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine-6-carbonitrile and MeMgBr in THF.15 Finally, the carboxyl-substituted terdentate chelates (3a) and (3b), were prepared from perchromate oxidation in conc. sulfuric acid at elevated temperature (Scheme 2).16 The conversion to their respective ethyl ester derivatives (4a) and (4b) was then achieved by treatment of carboxyl complexes 3a and 3b with anhydrous ethanol in the presence of catalytic amount of conc. sulfuric acid.
 Scheme 2  Conditions and reagents: (i) K2Cr2O7, H2SO4, 60 °C, 2 h; and (ii) EtOH, refluxed, 24 h. 
Preparation of CK1
In a typical experiment, 4a (85 mg, 0.23 mmol) and [(bpy)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl (100 mg, 0.23 mmol) were first dissolved in a DMF solution (15 mL). The mixture was heated at 160 °C for 8 h under constant stirring. Then, KNCS (180 mg, 2.3 mmol) was added and the mixture was refluxed for additional 8 h at 160 °C. Next, the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue was dissolved into a mixture of 5 mL of acetone and 5 mL of 1.0 M NaOH solution and heated at reflux for 24 h. Finally, the solution was concentrated to one-half of its original volume and neutralized with 2 M HCl solution to pH = 3 to afford a brown precipitate. The solid product was then taken into a minimum amount of methanol and purified on Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as the eluent. The main band was collected and solvent was evaporated to dryness. The resulting brown precipitate was then washed with deionized water, acetone and diethyl ether in sequence, giving CK1 as a powdery material (45 mg, 30%).

Preparation of HY1
Same procedure as preparing CK1 but 4b (100 mg, 0.23 mmol) instead of 4a was used, resulting in dark brown powder (30 mg, 25%).

Preparation of CK2 and HY2
These dyes were synthesized using the multi-step procedures described for CK1 and HY1, but employing [(MS-bpy)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl instead of [(bpy)RuCl(p-cymene)]Cl as key starting material. After removing solvent, the product was dissolved in minimum amount of methanol and purified on Sephadex LH-20 column eluting with methanol. The main component was collected and precipitated by removing solvent. The product was then washed with deionized water, acetone and diethyl ether in sequence, and then crystallized from methanol to afford CK2 and HY2 as powdery material (30 mg, 23.4% and 30 mg, 21.6%), respectively.

Fabrication of DSSC and photovoltaic measurements
TiO2 anatase nanoparticles of 20 nm were prepared using published procedures.17 TiO2 particles were dispersed in α-terpineol with ethyl cellulose as a binder. The TiO2 thin films of 12 μm or 18 μm were prepared by a doctor-blade method on a transparent conducting oxide (F-doped SnO2, FTO). These films were dried at 150 °C for 15 min and then a 4 μm thick layer of 200 nm TiO2 particles (ST-41, particles were obtained from Ishihara Sangyo, Japan) was deposited again by a doctor-blade method with a dimension of 0.4 × 0.4 cm. Afterwards, the double-layered films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After sintering, the TiO2 films were treated with 50 mM of TiCl4 solution, rinsed with water and ethanol, and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2electrode was coated with dyes by dipping into a solution of 3 × 10−4 M of the targeted dye, together with 3 × 10−4 M of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in a mixture of DMF and tert-butanol (volume ratio: 1:1) overnight. After being rinsed with EtOH, the dye-coated TiO2electrode was assembled into a sandwich-type cell with a Pt-coated FTO as counter electrode and a film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm) as a spacer between the electrodes. The electrolyte solution was then injected into the cell through a drilled hole in the back of the counter electrode. Lastly, the hole was sealed using a hot-melt ionomer film and a cover glass.
The Pt counterelectrode was prepared by spin-coating a 0.05 M H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol solution on FTO glass, followed by sintering at 385 °C for 15–30 min. The liquid electrolyte contained 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in the mixed acetonitrile and valeronitrile solution (volume ratio: 85:15).18 Light-to-electricity conversion efficiency values were measured using a modified light source, 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel, 6266), an Oriel 81088 Air Mass 1.5 Global Filter and a digital source meter purchased from Keithley Instruments Inc. The incident light intensity was calibrated by using a standard solar cell composed of a crystalline silicon solar cell and an IR cutoff filter (Schott, KG-5), giving the photoresponse range of amorphous silicon solar cell. The applied potential and measured cell current were measured using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter.
Theoretical approaches
All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 03 package.19 Geometrical optimization of the electronic ground state was carried out by the hybridized DFT functional, PBE0 and the basis set 6-31G* for all atoms except for Ru atom.20 The calculation of Ru was based on the “double-ζ” quality basis set consisting of the effective core potential SBKJC.21 Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations were then performed with the same functional and basis set at the optimized geometry to obtain electronic transition energies. Oscillator strengths were deduced from the dipole transition matrix elements (for singlet states only). The Hartree–Fock method with the same basis set was applied to calculate the molecular volume, which is defined as the electron density inside a contour of 0.001 electrons bohr−3. Furthermore, as recommended by the Gaussian 03 package, the radius was selected to be 0.5 Å larger than that deduced from the computed volume.
Results and discussion
General synthetic strategy
In the synthetic protocol (see Scheme 3 and the Experimental section), quite different from N3 (for which two pyridyl groups of the bis(4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridine) chelates are equivalent), due to the addition of a pyrazolate fragment in bpz chelate we notice that two pyridyl groups are no longer equivalent. Thus, positioning the carboxylic acid is pivotal in guiding the electron flow to TiO2. The computational approach (vide infra) indicates that electron density at the LUMO is mainly populated at the terminal p-carboxylic pyridine. This makes the design of CK2 meaningful. It is noteworthy that anchoring only one carboxylic acid, such as in CK1 and CK2, for the use of sensitizer is not uncommon. A similar strategy has been made in most of the organic donor–acceptor22 as well as Zn(II)-based porphyrin and phthalocyanine sensitizers.23 On the other hand, the HY series possess two carboxylic groups, which in theory should enhance the attachment between dye and TiO2nanoparticles and hence favor electron injection from excited HY dyes to the TiO2electrode.

Photophysical spectra and electrochemical data
The absorption characteristics and molar extinction coefficient of a dye play a crucial role in the performance of a DSSC. Fig. 1 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CK and HY series dyes in dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, while pertinent data are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of the CK1 sensitizer in DMF shows a lower lying absorption maximum at 517 nm, and with the molar extinction coefficient being 8800 M−1 cm−1. Thus, its origin can reasonably be assigned to metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition. The higher lying absorption band maximized at 345 nm with ε value as high as 20000 M−1 cm−1 is ascribed to the π–π* transitions of the 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid. Under similar conditions, HY1 exhibits absorption peaks at 521 nm (ε = 10400 M−1 cm−1) and 350 nm (ε = 21500 M−1 cm−1), both of which are red-shifted relative to that of CK1. In yet another approach, introducing 4,4′-di(4-methoxystyrenyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (MS-bpy) to CK1 and HY1 congeners, forming CK2 and HY2, respectively, greatly extends the conjugation length of the ancillary bpy ligand, such that the light-harvesting ability is expected to be enhanced.

 Fig. 1  
Absorption spectra of various Ru(II) dyes in DMF. 
The spectrum of sensitizer HY2 reveals two absorption peaks at 437 and 550 nm. It is reasonable to assign the 437 nm band to the intraligand π–π* transition mixed, in part, with MLCT, while the 550 nm band is ascribed to the lowest-lying MLCT transition. One remarkable feature in absorption is that the molar extinction coefficient is measured to be as high as 19800 M−1cm−1 at the peak wavelength of 550 nm, which is apparently higher than standard N3dye of 14000 M−1cm−1 at peak wavelength of 530 nm.24 The results support the design strategy first proposed by Wang et al.,25 in that elongation of the conjugation together with the introduction of styrenyl and electron donating methoxyl group indeed enhance the absorption capability across the entire visible range.
Prior to making the solar devices, cyclic voltammetry was performed to ensure that the LUMO of these complexes is suited for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, as well as the HOMO of the complexes match the energy level of the redox electrolyte. The Eox of the dyes adsorbed on a 6 μm thick TiO2 nanocrystalline film on FTO glass was hence measured with cyclic voltammetry (see Table 1). The results reveal that the redox potential of I−/I3− (ca. 0.4 V vs.NHE) is more negative than the HOMO and is able to regenerate the dyes from electron donation. The LUMO levels of these dyes are also sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2electrode (−0.5 V vs.NHE at pH 7).

Fig. 2 shows the frontier molecular orbital configuration of CK2 and HY2 deduced from the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The results reveal that HOMOs of CK2 and HY2 have similar localizations and both possessing an antibonding interaction between the t2g orbital of Ru(II) metal center and the π-orbital of thiocyanate. The LUMO of HY2 is localized on the two p-carboxylic groups of the bpz. Nevertheless, the LUMO of CK2 only concentrated in the p-carboxylic group of terminal pyridine. It is thus interesting to know the comparison of device performance between CK and HY series, which anchor to the TiO2 surface based on single and dual carboxylic acid, respectively.

Photovoltaic data
We then fabricated CK1, CK2, HY1, HY2 and N719 sensitized solar cells on the TiO2 film (0.16 cm2 in area) using I−/I3− as the electrolytes (see the Experimental section for detailed configuration). With a higher molar extinction coefficient, it is feasible to produce much thinner solar cells for CK2 and HY2 with optimal efficiency. Accordingly, a 12 + 4 μm thickness of TiO2 film was used for CK2 and HY2-sensitized solar cells. Note that a 15 + 4 μm thickness of TiO2 film was commonly utilized for solar cells made by N3 and N719, which was also used for the CK1 and HY1-sensitized solar cells due to their lower extinction coefficient. The electrolyte contains 0.8 M PMII, 0.03 M iodine, 0.13 M GuNCS, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v). The N719-sensitized solar cells were made according to the optimized parameters of the literature.18
Typical photocurrent density–photovoltage curves of CK1, CK2, HY1 and HY2-sensitized solar cells are depicted in Fig. 3 and pertinent performance data are summarized in Table 2. Under standard AM 1.5 G irradiation, the maximum efficiency for the HY2-sensitized TiO2 solar cell was calculated to be 8.07%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 15.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 753 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.678. In comparison, the CK2-sensitized TiO2 solar cell, possessing only single carboxylic group, showed lower Jsc (14.40 mA cm−2) and hence a lower η value of 7.15%. The result is plausibly due to the narrower spectral response in CK2 (cf.HY2), resulting in lower photocurrent. For both CK1 and HY1, poor performance of extinction coefficient forces us to increase the thickness of the TiO2electrode, which further generates the charge recombination, hence the lost photovoltage.26–29 As a result, the device based on HY1 showed a lowered η value of 6.70%. Moreover, the device based on CK1 rendered an even lower η value of 4.39%. For a fair comparison, the N719 sensitized TiO2 solar cell showed an efficiency of 8.02%, with a Jsc of 15.70 mA cm−2, a Voc of 765 mV, and an FF of 0.668 in this study.

The onset of the IPCE spectra based on HY2 is ∼800 nm, and high IPCE performance (> 60%) was observed from 400 to 660 nm, with the highest value, 82%, at 530 nm. In contrast, despite the onset of the IPCE spectra of DSSCs of ∼800 nm in CK2, it exhibited lower IPCE with maxima of 74% at ∼530 nm. Similarly, better η value and IPCE was resolved for HY1 (cf.CK1). Compared with CK2 (CK1), the better IPCE for HY2 (HY1) may be attributed to relatively strong coupling of dual carboxylic groups upon anchoring on TiO2, resulting in either extension of spectral red shift or the enhancement of the dye uptake. Since the four studied compounds possess similar IPCE spectral onset (∼800 nm, see Fig. 4), the latter, i.e.dye uptake, may play a role to rationalize the differentiation.

To gain more insight into the above issue, we further performed the measurement of dye uptake for CK2 and HY2 and the results are listed in Table 3. The uptake data for N719dye are also shown in Table 3 for comparison. As listed in Table 3, the dye uptake of CK2 and HY2 onto a TiO2 film (12 μm thick) was determined to be 1.02 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 1.12 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively, the result of which clearly indicates a better uptake value for HY2, most plausibly due to its dual carboxylic functionality versus single carboxylic functionality in CK2. Moreover, the carboxylic group in CK2 is resided cis to the bulky MS-bpy chelate. Thus, a much greater steric replusion is expected if CK2 solely relies on its single carboxylic group to interact with the surface of TiO2nanoparticles, which, in part, could also lead to the lower dye uptake.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a series of new trident bipyridine pyrazolate coupled Ru(II) complexes CK1, CK2, HY1 and HY2 were strategically synthesized. In comparison to the N719 standard, CK2 and HY2 achieved the original proposal of gaining absorption extinction coefficient ranging from 350 to ∼550 nm, accompanied by lowering of the lowest-lying energy gap. These advantages allow us to reduce the thickness of the TiO2 layer, greatly suppressing the dark current and hence increasing Voc. Upon optimization, HY2 has attained η = 8.07, Jsc = 15.81 mA cm−2, Voc = 750 mV and FF = 0.678, the results of which are equivalent to that of N719 (η = 8.07, see Table 2) optimized in this study. The inferiority of CK2 (cf.HY2) is attributed to only a single carboxylic acid of the anchoring ligand, resulting in weaker coupling toward TiO2, hence the reduction of DSSC performance. Based on this framework and versatility of the synthesis, further improvement of the transition strength and spectral coverage is promising. We thus believe that this class of bpz-based sensitizers with higher power conversion efficiency can be added into a new research forefront on DSSC.
