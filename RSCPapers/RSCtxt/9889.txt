    , Accepted 3rd December 2019First published on 20th December 2019AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising method for converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in the form of hydrogen. Nanostructured hematite (α-Fe2O3) is one of the most attractive materials for highly efficient charge carrier generation and collection, due to its large specific surface area and shortened minority carrier diffusion length required to reach the surface. In the present work, PEC water splitting performance of α-Fe2O3 prepared by anodization of thin iron layers on FTO glass and subsequent annealing in a low O2–Ar atmosphere with only 0.03% O2 was investigated. The key finding is that annealing anodic nanostructures with a low oxygen concentration provides a strongly enhanced PEC performance compared with classical air annealing. The photocurrent of the former at 1.5 V vs. RHE results in 1.1 mA cm−2, being 11 times higher than that of the latter. The enhancement of the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere can be attributed to the controlled morphology, Sn doping, and introduction of oxygen vacancies, which contribute to the enhancement of the hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive surface and additionally lead to an enhanced hole transfer at the interface between α-Fe2O3 and the electrolyte. From the obtained results, it is evident that low oxygen annealing is a surprisingly effective method of defect engineering and optimizing α-Fe2O3 electrodes for a maximized PEC water splitting performance.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen with zero CO2 emission ranks among the most promising, clean, and renewable energy vectors that can replace fossil fuels, which still represent the main energy source but have a detrimental impact on the environment. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in the form of hydrogen.1 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda first demonstrated the electrochemical photolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen by using TiO2 as a semiconductor photoanode.2 Since that seminal work a large range of metal oxide semiconductors have been investigated for PEC water splitting applications.3–6 Among them, hematite iron oxide (α-Fe2O3) is one of the most attractive materials due to many favorable properties such as a suitable band gap (1.9–2.2 eV) for absorbing a significant portion of visible light, high chemical stability in many electrolytes, stability against photocorrosion, abundance, and low cost.7,8 Nevertheless, the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 is still limited by several key factors such as a short excited state lifetime (<10 ps),9 a short diffusion length (2–4 nm) of minority charge carriers (holes),10 a low carrier mobility (10−2 to 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1),11,12 and a poor electrical conductivity (10−14 S cm−1).13 These detrimental optical and electronic properties lead to a poor collection of photogenerated holes and to their fast recombination with electrons in the hematite bulk. In order to enhance the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes, a wide range of approaches have been explored, including nanostructuring,14 elemental doping (e.g., by Sn, Ti, and Si),15–17 and the decoration of the hematite surface by various oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co-catalysts (e.g., IrO2, Co-Pi (Co-phosphate), and FeOOH).18–20 Sivula et al.15 reported that nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 photoanodes deposited on FTO glass (transparent fluorine doped tin oxide layer coated on a glass substrate) that are annealed at 700 °C or below exhibit no photocurrent for PEC water splitting. However, upon annealing at 800 °C, the photoactivity of α-Fe2O3 was drastically improved as a result of thermally driven diffusion of Sn ions from the FTO substrate into the hematite lattice, acting here as the donor dopant. Similarly, the introduction of oxygen vacancies has also been reported to enhance the photoresponse of α-Fe2O3via a self-doping mechanism.21 Furthermore, nanostructuring of α-Fe2O3 provides a highly improved efficiency in charge carrier generation and collection due to the enhancement of the specific surface area and drastic shortening of the minority carrier diffusion length.14 The α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have been synthesized using a variety of techniques including sol–gel processing,22 electrodeposition,23 spray pyrolysis,24 hydrothermal synthesis,25,26 magnetron sputtering,27,28 and electrochemical anodization.29,30 Among them, anodization is considered to be a viable technique for the fabrication of nanostructured α-Fe2O3 from the viewpoint of large-scale production and cost reduction.30 The anodically fabricated oxide films are typically amorphous and need to be thermally treated in order to convert them into the crystalline form (hematite α-Fe2O3). However, if the nanostructured layers are formed on metallic iron substrates, thermal annealing leads to the formation of gradient oxide layers consisting of wustite (FeO), magnetite (Fe3O4), and α-Fe2O3 crystalline phases.31 The presence of these phases cannot be avoided because of the complex additional thermal oxidation of underlying metal substrates during the annealing. The FeO and Fe3O4 phases are not suitable for the photolysis of water as they behave either metal-like or as a narrow band gap (<1 eV) semiconductor,21,29 therefore, plain α-Fe2O3 is the desired phase for PEC water splitting applications. A complete anodization of a magnetron sputtered metallic iron film on the FTO substrate prior to thermal annealing is an efficient strategy to avoid the creation of the unwanted iron oxide phases.32,33 Furthermore, the preparation of photoanodes on a transparent substrate enables back side illumination, i.e., the irradiation of the sample from the direction of the substrate/semiconductor interface, which, in many cases, has led to an improved PEC activity.34,35 It is also well known that annealing conditions such as temperature and atmosphere affect the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 layers.15,30,32,36–38 Ling et al.36 reported that the photoresponse of hydrothermally grown α-Fe2O3 nanowires was activated by annealing in an oxygen deficient atmosphere achieved in an evacuated furnace refilled with pure N2. It was shown that the generation of oxygen vacancies considerably increased the electrical conductivity. On the other hand, it was also described that α-Fe2O3, under these reducing conditions, can be easily converted into undesired Fe3O4. In the present work, we create a fully converted α-Fe2O3 nanostructure on an FTO substrate by the aforementioned approach. Key is the use of a defined low oxygen annealing environment to obtain a highly active nanostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanode. First, high-quality iron films with carefully controlled thicknesses were deposited on an FTO substrate by a modified magnetron sputtering technique. Subsequently, the films were fully anodized to amorphous nanostructured iron oxide. Finally, we investigated the effect of annealing of these nanostructures on their PEC performance in a defined gas environment containing a very low concentration of oxygen (Ar + 0.03% O2 atmosphere). We demonstrate that controlled annealing in a low oxygen atmosphere can drastically improve the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoelectrodes (more than tenfold compared with classical air annealing).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of α-Fe2O3 layers
The α-Fe2O3 photoanodes were prepared by anodization of a thin Fe layer deposited on FTO glass supports, followed by ambient controlled annealing. Initially, thin Fe layers were prepared on FTO glass (TOC22-15, Solaronix) by a high-energy magnetron sputtering method known as high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Before the deposition, the FTO substrates were carefully cleaned by subsequent sonication in isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and water. The HiPIMS depositions were carried out in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) reactor continuously pumped down by a turbo-molecular pump providing a base pressure of 10−5 Pa. The metallic target of pure iron (99.995%, Plasmaterials) with an outer diameter of 50 mm and an argon atmosphere were used as the iron source and a working gas, respectively. The working gas was fed to the reactor with a flow rate of 30 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute). The FTO substrates were not externally heated during the deposition, so the temperature of the FTO rose up to ∼80 °C owing to the energy bombardment. The operating pressure was 1 Pa. The pulsing frequency of the DC HiPIMS discharge was 100 Hz with a duty cycle of 1%. The sputtering time was adjusted so that the thickness of the deposited Fe layers on FTO became 300 nm.
In the next step, the Fe films were converted into amorphous iron oxide nanostructures by the electrochemical anodization procedure. The anodization was performed in a solution of ethylene glycol (EG, ≥99.5%, Carl Roth) containing 0.2 M NH4F (≥98%, Carl Roth) and 3 vol% H2O at 50 V and at room temperature. A two-electrode system, in which the Fe layer on the FTO and a Pt sheet served as the working and counter electrodes, respectively, was used. After the anodization the samples were rinsed with water and dried in a nitrogen stream. The anodized layers were then annealed at 600 °C for 40 min and 750 °C for 20 min in air and in a 0.03% O2–Ar atmosphere using a tube furnace (Linn High Therm, FRH-40/250/1500). The 0.03% O2–Ar atmosphere was provided by a continuous flow through the furnace using a commercial gas cylinder (VARIGON® S, Linde) prior to and during the annealing process. The samples were labeled based on the annealing temperature-atmosphere (i.e., 600-Air, 750-LO (Low Oxygen)). As control samples, compact α-Fe2O3 layers were prepared by magnetron sputtering as described earlier.27,28,39 Additionally, the layers were annealed in the 0.03% O2–Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 40 min in order to be compared with anodized layers. The compact layers annealed in the low oxygen atmosphere were labeled “CO-600-LO”. Finally, in order to explore the effect of a typical OER co-catalyst on α-Fe2O3 layers, 600-LO samples were decorated with FeOOH. For this, a 5 mM FeCl3 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution was prepared into which the samples were immersed for 15 h (the front sides of the α-Fe2O3 layers faced the bottom), followed by rinsing with distilled water and drying in a nitrogen stream.
2.2 Layer characterization
The morphology of the layers was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed with an X'pert Philips MPD (equipped with a Panalytical X'celerator detector) with graphite monochromatic CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The chemical composition and the oxidation state were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5600), and the peak positions were calibrated based on the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Solid-state conductivity measurements were carried out in an adapted scanning electron microscope (SEM, TESCAN LYRA3 XMU) by 2-point measurements using a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 4200-SCS). Tungsten tips were used as electrical contacts between the α-Fe2O3 layer surface and the FTO substrate. Resistivity values were then obtained from the I–V curves by ramping the potential from −2 V to 2 V at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1. The electron Paramagnetic Response (EPR) spectra were recorded on a JEOL continuous wave spectrometer JES-FA200 equipped with an X-band Gunn diode oscillator bridge, a cylindric mode cavity and a N2 cryostat. The samples were measured in the solid state under an argon atmosphere in quartz glass EPR tubes at 95 K with a similar loading of ≈20 mg. The spectra shown were measured using the following parameters: temperature: 95 K, microwave frequency ν = 8.959 GHz, modulation width: 0.1–0.01 mT, microwave power: 1.0 mW, modulation frequency: 100 kHz and a time constant of 0.1 s. Analysis and simulation of the data was carried out using the software “eview” and “esim” written by E. Bill (MPI for Chemical Energy Conversion, Mülheim an der Ruhr).
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
The PEC performance of the α-Fe2O3 photoanodes was measured in a three-electrode PEC cell, where a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte were used. The photocurrent–potential (J–V) properties were studied by scanning the potential from −0.5 to 0.7 V at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 under periodic illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) light. The potentials versus Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the Nernst equation. ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0Ag/AgCl + 0.059 pH(1)where ERHE is the converted potential versus RHE, EAg/AgCl is the experimentally measured potential, and E0Ag/AgCl = 0.209 V at 25 °C for a Ag/AgCl electrode in 3 M KCl. The O2 evolution was measured under the illumination of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) light at 1.5 V vs. RHE. A gas chromatograph (GCMS-QO2010SE, SHIMADZU) with a TCD detector was used to measure the amount of O2 generated. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was acquired in the range from 300 to 700 nm with 5 nm steps at an applied potential of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Mott–Schottky measurements, and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out using a Zahner IM6 (Zahner Elektrik) with a tunable light source TLS03. The EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at 1.5 V vs. RHE with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV and a 452 nm light source with an intensity of 10 mW cm−2. The Mott–Schottky measurements were conducted at a frequency of 10 kHz under dark conditions. The donor density (Nd) was calculated by the following eqn (2). Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(2)where e0 is the electron charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), ε is the dielectric constant of α-Fe2O3 (80),17ε0 is the permittivity vacuum (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), and C is the capacitance derived from the electrochemical impedance at each potential (V). The IMPS responses were recorded in the range of 1.0–1.7 V vs. RHE with 0.1 V steps under 452 nm light illumination with an intensity of 10 mW cm−2. The light intensity was modulated by 10% between 1 kHz and 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
In order to produce nanostructured phase-pure α-Fe2O3 photoanodes without forming Fe3O4 and/or FeO phase impurities, a thin metallic Fe layer with a thickness of 300 nm was deposited on FTO glass by magnetron sputtering. Next, the Fe layer was anodized at room temperature in an EG electrolyte containing 0.2 mol L−1 NH4F and 3 vol% H2O using a voltage of 50 V. The end point of the anodization was detected by an increase in the anodic current recorded on-line during the anodization process (Fig. S1†).32 The anodization procedure completely transformed the non-transparent iron layer into a fully transparent iron oxide nanostructure, as evident from Fig. 1(a-1). Fig. 1(b) shows the surface SEM image of the layer after anodization, and the morphology exhibits a nanoporous structure. Subsequently, the anodized layers were annealed at 600 and 750 °C in air and the 0.03% O2–Ar atmosphere. All the annealed layers had a thickness of 450–520 nm. The surface appearance and SEM images of these layers are shown in Fig. 1(a-2, c–f). The layers were transparent even after the annealing. However, the color of the layers changed from yellow to red after anodization and subsequent annealing, as it is apparent for the α-Fe2O3 photoanode annealed at 600 °C in a low oxygen atmosphere (600-LO) (Fig. 1(a-2)); other samples also exhibited a similar red color, which indicated the transformation of the amorphous structure into the α-Fe2O3 phase.40 The morphologies of these layers changed depending on the annealing conditions. Larger particles were formed in the layers annealed at 750 °C (750-LO, 750-Air) compared with those annealed at 600 °C (600-LO, 600-Air) under the same ambient conditions. Similar coarsening of the particles at higher temperatures has also been reported in the literature.15 Interestingly and importantly, the coarsening of the particles was inhibited in low oxygen annealing (600-LO, 750-LO) compared with air annealing (600-Air, 750-Air). In the case of the 600-LO sample, the nanoporous structure obtained during the anodization was fully maintained. The SEM images verified that the lower temperature and low oxygen concentration annealing were able to retain the desired nanostructured morphology.

The crystal structure of the layers after the annealing process was determined by XRD, and the resulting XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2. Clearly, only peaks corresponding to α-Fe2O3 and SnO2 attributed to the FTO substrate were identified. In other words, a layer that fully consists of only α-Fe2O3 can be fabricated by completely anodizing an iron thin layer on the FTO glass followed by annealing.

The layers were further analyzed by XPS. Fig. 3 shows the survey spectra as well as the high-resolution Sn 3d, O 1s, and Fe 2p spectra of α-Fe2O3 after annealing under various conditions. The survey spectra revealed that α-Fe2O3 contained not only Fe and O but also Sn dopants due to diffusion from the FTO substrate during the annealing process (Fig. 3(a)).15,33 The high resolution Sn 3d spectra indicate an increase in the Sn concentration after annealing at a higher temperature and in a low oxygen atmosphere (Fig. 3(b)). The atomic concentrations of Sn quantified from the XPS spectra are shown in Table 1. Remarkably, α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen environment shows a higher Sn concentration compared with air annealing. This can be attributed to the acceleration of Sn diffusion from the FTO substrate into α-Fe2O3 by grain boundary diffusion, since α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere provides a fine crystalline nanostructure, as shown in Fig. 1. The spectra of O 1s show that the binding energy centered at around 529.7 eV for 600-Air is shifted to a slightly higher value compared with the α-Fe2O3 samples having a higher Sn concentration (Fig. 3(c)). This suggests that Sn doping would influence the Fe–O lattice and increase the binding energy.41 In the Fe 2p spectra, Fe 2p3/2 peaks around 711 eV, Fe 2p1/2 peaks around 724 eV, and satellite peaks of Fe3+ around 719 eV can be clearly identified (Fig. 3(d)). These values have been reported as typical binding energies for Fe2O3.36,40,42–44 In addition to these peaks, a variation of peak intensity at 716 eV, which corresponds to a Fe2+ satellite peak,36,40,42–44 can be observed, depending on the annealing conditions. Peak deconvolution was performed on each Fe 2p spectrum (Fig. S2†),45,46 and the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio was obtained from the area ratio of each satellite peak, as shown in Table 1. The ratio of Fe2+ increased for low oxygen and higher temperature annealing. These results suggest that oxygen vacancies that act as shallow donors are created in α-Fe2O3.36 In order to characterize the oxygen vacancies, EPR spectroscopy measurements were carried out (Fig. S3†). The EPR spectrum of 600-Air shows only one species present with giso = 2.31. In contrast the 600-LO sample shows a characteristic signature with g1 = 4.20, g2 = 2.10, and g3 = 1.80. These results clearly show the different nature of oxygen vacancies in the LO sample. Since the Sn dopants as well as the oxygen vacancies can act as electron donors, they can improve the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3via a polaron hopping mechanism.47,48

In order to confirm the conductance of the α-Fe2O3 layers and FTO glass substrates, solid state conductivity measurements were carried out in an adapted SEM by 2-point measurements using a semiconductor characterization system. The measured I–V curves for the α-Fe2O3 layers are shown in Fig. S4† and the corresponding electric resistance data are shown in Table 1. As a reference, additional data were taken on FTO only glass substrates annealed under each ambient condition – the results are shown in Fig. S5.† The FTO substrate annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere (750-LO, 600-LO) exhibits a slightly higher resistance value compared with the FTO substrate annealed in air (Fig. S5†). Nevertheless, the α-Fe2O3 layers annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere (750-LO, 600-LO) show a higher conductivity compared with samples annealed in air (750-Air, 600-Air) (Fig. S4† and Table 1). This can be ascribed to an increased donor density by Sn doping and the introduction of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, annealing in a low oxygen atmosphere is an effective method for enhancing the electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3. However, it should be noted that 600-LO shows the best conductivity despite the fact that 750-LO has the highest Sn concentration and Fe2+ ratio. Yang et al.49 reported on the conductance of α-Fe2O3 doped with various concentrations of Sn and revealed that the electrical conductance of α-Fe2O3 can be improved by increasing the Sn concentration only up to a certain critical concentration level (in fact, corresponding to the solubility limit of Sn in Fe2O3); above this level the overall conductivity decreases significantly. Similarly, in the case of 750-LO in our experiment, Sn seems to act as a scattering center that reduces the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 once the solubility of Sn is reached. Therefore, exceeding the optimal annealing temperature (with excessively high Sn concentrations) leads to the conductivity deterioration of α-Fe2O3.
The PEC water splitting performance of the fabricated α-Fe2O3 layers was measured in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The corresponding photocurrent–potential (J–V) curves recorded under the chopped light illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4(a). The 600-LO sample that shows preserved nanostructuring and has the highest conductivity also exhibits the best PEC water splitting performance. The photocurrent value reaches 1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which is 1.8 times and 11 times higher than that of 750-Air (0.6 mA cm−2) and 600-Air (0.1 mA cm−2) samples, respectively. Furthermore, the quantum yields of the reactions represented as the IPCE values were measured at 1.5 V vs. RHE as a function of the incident light wavelength; the results are shown in Fig. 4(b). The IPCE values of all α-Fe2O3 layers gradually drop to zero at wavelengths above 610 nm, in accordance with the bandgap of α-Fe2O3.7 Importantly, the 600-LO shows significantly enhanced IPCE magnitude compared with all the other α-Fe2O3 layers over the entire wavelengths that are in accordance with the J–V curves. The highest efficiency is 18.8% at a wavelength of 330 nm. It was reported in the literature15,50,51 that the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes on FTO glass was greatly improved by their annealing at above 750 °C or at a lower temperature for a long time (e.g., 600 °C for 8 h). The enhancement of the PEC performance was attributed to the increased electrical conductivity as a result of the incorporation of Sn as a donor doping element coming from the FTO substrate due to the thermal diffusion. This phenomenon occurred in our samples annealed in air – we observed a better performance for the 750-Air sample, which provided a higher Sn concentration and conductivity compared with the 600-Air sample. In contrast, the results for low oxygen annealing (600-LO, 750-LO) revealed the best PEC performance for the α-Fe2O3 annealed at 600 °C for 40 min. The conversely degraded PEC performance of 750-LO can be attributed to a combination of a larger particle size of α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 1) and lower conductivity (Table 1) compared with 600-LO. This indicates that the enhancement of the photoresponse of the α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere can be achieved even at a lower temperature of 600 °C and by shorter annealing times. Annealing at a lower temperature and simultaneously for a shorter time gains practical significance because it can reduce the damage to the structure and electrical conductivity of the FTO substrate as well as reduce the energy cost of the annealing process.52 Additionally, the photoelectrochemical stability of 600-LO and the amount of oxygen generated during the test were measured in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at 1.5 V vs. RHE under illumination. Faraday efficiency was calculated using eqn (3). (3)where e0 is the electron charge (1.60 × 10−19 C), NA is the Avogadro constant (6.02 × 1023 mol), Jphoto is the photocurrent density, A is the surface area of the electrode, T is the reaction time. Over the entire time period the 600-LO sample exhibits a stable photocurrent and nearly constant oxygen generation as shown in Fig. S6.† Furthermore, the PEC performance of compact α-Fe2O3 layers was studied to evaluate the effect of the nanostructure. Comparing the compact layer (CO-600-LO) and the anodized layer (600-LO), the compact layer shows a lower photocurrent and IPCE value even though both were annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere (Fig. 4 and S7†). This can be ascribed to the effect of the nanostructure of the anodized α-Fe2O3 layers.

In order to investigate the donor densities of α-Fe2O3 layers annealed under each condition, Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte under dark conditions. The Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Fig. 5(a). The slopes of Mott–Schottky plots for all α-Fe2O3 samples are positive, which indicates that they are n-type semiconductors with electrons as majority carriers. The donor densities estimated from the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots are shown in Table 1. Importantly, the 600-LO sample, which exhibited the best PEC water splitting performance, shows the highest donor density of 4.88 × 1019, which is more than one order higher than that of the 600-Air sample (4.86 × 1018). Since the donor density of α-Fe2O3 can be increased by Sn doping and the introduction of oxygen vacancies,36,50 the improvement of the donor density of the 600-LO can be attributed to these effects. The donor densities are also consistent with the conductivity measurements (Table 1 and Fig. S4†). In other words, low oxygen annealing promotes Sn doping and introduction of oxygen vacancies, and increases the donor density of α-Fe2O3. As a result, the improvement of electrical conductivity of α-Fe2O3 leads to an excellent PEC water splitting performance. However, it should be noted that 750-LO shows a lower donor density than 600-LO in spite of exhibiting the highest Sn concentration and Fe2+ ratio. Aroutiounian et al.53 investigated the donor density of Sn doped α-Fe2O3 and suggested that the donor density of α-Fe2O3 drastically increased until 1.0 at% of Sn, and then decreased sharply to 1.5 at%. As described above for the change in the conductivity of Sn doped α-Fe2O3, it has been reported that the donor density and the conductivity of α-Fe2O3 decrease when the Sn concentration exceeds a certain level. Our results agree well with these findings.
 Fig. 5  (a) Mott–Schottky plots measured under dark conditions and (b) EIS Nyquist plots measured under illumination at 1.5 V vs. RHE for α-Fe2O3 layers annealed under various conditions. The inset is an equivalent circuit model for fitting the experimental data. 
Furthermore, EIS measurements of the α-Fe2O3 layers were carried out in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at 1.5 V vs. RHE under visible light illumination (a wavelength of 452 nm, 10 mW cm−2). The EIS results in the form of Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 5(b). The experimental data were fitted by using the equivalent circuit model depicted in the inset image of Fig. 5(b), and the fitting results are summarized in Table S1.† The equivalent circuit consists of a series resistance, Rs, bulk resistance of α-Fe2O3, R1, charge transfer resistance at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, R2, the space charge capacitance of the bulk α-Fe2O3, C1, and the space charge capacitance at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface, C2.54,55 Sample 600-LO exhibits the smallest semicircle and smallest values of R1 and R2 compared with all other α-Fe2O3 layers. The smallest value of R1 for 600-LO coincides with the results of the conductivity and the Mott–Schottky measurements, which show the highest conductivity and the highest donor density, respectively, for 600-LO. In other words, the electrons, which are majority carriers of the α-Fe2O3 electrode, can be rapidly transferred within the bulk α-Fe2O3, which has a high conductivity. This, in turn, reduces their recombination with photoexcited holes. Therefore, R1 can be assigned to the recombination resistance inside the bulk α-Fe2O3, and the smallest R1 for 600-LO denotes a reduced recombination and an easy extraction of the holes from the bulk α-Fe2O3 through the electrode surface. On the other hand, a smaller value of R2, which means charge transfer resistance, indicates that the holes extracted into the electrode surface easily transfer from α-Fe2O3 to the electrolyte and contribute to the OER, which is in line with the results reported in the literature for Sn doped α-Fe2O3.56–58 Therefore, the smallest R2 for 600-LO can be attributed to Sn doping into α-Fe2O3.
IMPS measurements for 600-LO and 600-Air were carried out in order to understand the effect of low oxygen annealing on the kinetics of electron–hole recombination and hole transfer in greater detail. The variations of IMPS responses as a function of applied potential were measured in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte under illumination (a wavelength of 452 nm, 10 mW cm−2). The theoretical background of IMPS measurements has been described in-depth by Peter et al.59–62Fig. 6(a) shows a typical IMPS response for 600-LO at 1.1 V vs. RHE. Two semicircles can be identified in the complex plane plots. The lower semicircle corresponds to the high frequency part that arises from RC attenuation by series resistance of the FTO glass and the space charge capacitance of the α-Fe2O3 layer, whereas the upper semicircle corresponding to the low frequency part indicates the competition between the recombination and hole transfer. Therefore, the rate constant of recombination, krec, and the rate constant of hole transfer, ktrans, can be evaluated by analyzing the upper semicircle. Typically, when the α-Fe2O3 electrode is irradiated by illumination, instantaneous photocurrent is observed, which corresponds to a hole current. The instantaneous hole current is not associated with charge transfer across the interface between the electrode/electrolyte. Under continued illumination, the photocurrent exponentially decays due to the hole build-up and the recombination of the holes and electrons until it reaches steady-state (Fig. S8†). In the IMPS response shown in Fig. 6(a), the maximum real photocurrent at a high frequency, jHF, and the minimum real photocurrent at a low frequency, jLF, correspond to the instantaneous photocurrent when the light is irradiated and the steady-state photocurrent under illumination, respectively. The ratio of these photocurrents represents the transfer efficiency, ηtrans, which is the fraction of holes that successfully transferred to the electrode/electrolyte interface and contributed to the OER, as shown in eqn (4). (4)
 Fig. 6  (a) Typical IMPS response for 600-LO at 1.1 V vs. RHE, variations of (b) low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) limits of the IMPS response, (c) transfer efficiency, and (d) rate constants of electron–hole recombination and hole transfer as a function of applied potential. 
Furthermore, the radial frequency at the maximum point of the upper semicircle corresponds to the sum of ktrans and krec as expressed in eqn (5). ωmax = ktrans + krec(5)
Consequently, ktrans and krec can be derived from eqn (4) and (5). The variations of jHF and jLF for 600-LO and 600-Air as a function of applied potential are shown in Fig. 6(b). The variation of jLF shown by open symbols in Fig. 6(b) is consistent with the J–V curves displayed in Fig. 4(a) because both of these photocurrents represent the situation under steady-state photocurrents. Importantly, 600-LO exhibits a greatly higher jHF over the entire potential range compared with 600-Air conditions. Considering that jHF corresponds to the hole flux without recombination, this trend thus indicates that the photogeneration and transport of holes are significantly improved for 600-LO. Since nanostructuring reduces the diffusion length required for holes to reach the electrode surface, in addition to improving the light harvesting, it is plausible that the nanostructure morphology of 600-LO (see Fig. 1(c)) contributes to the increase of jHF. Fig. 6(c) shows the variation of ηtrans for 600-LO and 600-Air derived by eqn (4). Also in this case 600-LO exhibits much higher ηtrans values compared with 600-Air. The increase in the transfer efficiency, ηtrans, can be explained in terms of the competition between the interfacial hole transfer and the electron–hole recombination at the surface. In other words, a higher ηtrans means an enhancement of the interfacial hole transfer and/or suppression of the electron–hole recombination at the surface. Therefore, in order to discuss the kinetics of hole transfer and recombination, the variations of both rate constants as a function of potential in the range of 1.0–1.3 V vs. RHE are summarized in Fig. 6(d). It should be noted that the extraction of reliable rate constants becomes difficult for the potential of equal or greater than 1.4 V vs. RHE as the upper semicircles for 600-LO become extremely small. The rate constants of surface recombination, krec, depend on the applied potential for both α-Fe2O3 layers, which is expected to be related to the electron concentration at the surface of α-Fe2O3.63 600-LO clearly exhibits smaller values of the rate constant of recombination compared with the 600-Air sample, this suggests suppression of electron–hole recombination at the surface. EIS measurements indicate suppression of recombination in the bulk α-Fe2O3, as described above. The suppression of recombination both on the surface and in the bulk of α-Fe2O3 can be attributed to the improvement in the conductivity for 600-LO due to Sn doping and the introduction of oxygen vacancies in α-Fe2O3. The rapid transport and transfer of electrons leads to a reduction in the recombination rate of the photoexcited holes with electrons. 600-LO exhibits higher values of the rate constant of hole transfer, ktrans, compared with 600-Air. As shown in Table S1,† EIS measurements revealed the smallest value of R2 (a charge transfer resistance at the α-Fe2O3/electrolyte interface) for 600-LO. Both the results suggest a significant enhancement of the hole transfer at the interface between α-Fe2O3 and the electrolyte. Dunn et al.62 also reported an increase in the rate constant of the hole transfer for the Sn doped α-Fe2O3. Thus, the enhancement of the hole transfer in 600-LO can be attributed to Sn doping in α-Fe2O3, indicating an effective catalysis of the OER on the surface of α-Fe2O3. It can be concluded from the IMPS measurements that the low oxygen annealing improves the hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive surface because of the nanostructuring of α-Fe2O3. In addition, the electron–hole recombination at the surface of α-Fe2O3 is suppressed due to the improvement in the conductivity of α-Fe2O3, and the hole transfer at the interface between the α-Fe2O3 and the electrolyte is enhanced due to the Sn doping in α-Fe2O3.
Finally, in order to explore the effect of a typical OER co-catalyst we explored FeOOH decoration which is often used on α-Fe2O3 layers.64 The results of PEC water splitting measurements and IPCE for 600-LO samples are shown in Fig. S9.† The α-Fe2O3 layer decorated with FeOOH (FeOOH-600-LO) exhibits an excellent PEC water splitting performance and IPCE. It provides a lower onset potential and a higher photocurrent than those of the plain 600-LO sample. Compared with the literature results (Table S2† summarizes recent reports on the photocurrent density of α-Fe2O3 layers prepared by anodization),32,33,65–72 the results of this study exhibit an excellent photocurrent density. Therefore, it is shown that the low oxygen annealing is a surprisingly effective method to improve the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 layers.
4. Conclusions
In the present study, we investigated the PEC water splitting performance of nanostructured α-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared on FTO glass and particularly the effect of annealing in a low oxygen content environment, which was a 0.03% O2–Ar atmosphere. The α-Fe2O3 layer produced by anodization of a sputtered metallic iron film followed by annealing at 600 °C for 40 min in a low oxygen atmosphere exhibits a strongly enhanced PEC performance compared with conventional air annealing. The photocurrent under illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 for the α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere was found to be 1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.5 V vs. RHE, which was 11 times higher than that of the air annealed reference. From the results of multiple analyses and evaluations, the following mechanistic facts can be deduced: The improvement in the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 annealed in a low oxygen atmosphere can be attributed to a coordinated action of nanostructuring, Sn doping, and introduction of suitable oxygen vacancies. Low oxygen annealing avoids coarsening of the α-Fe2O3 nanostructure. This allows maintaining a short diffusion length of holes, and supports the hole flux from the photogenerated site to the reactive surface. Sn doping from FTO into α-Fe2O3 and introduction of oxygen vacancies are enhanced by the low oxygen annealing. These effects contribute to an increase in the donor density and result in an improvement of the conductivity, which leads to a low electron–hole recombination rate. Additionally, Sn doping into α-Fe2O3 also enhances the hole transfer at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. On the basis of these results, it is evident that low oxygen annealing of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures is a very effective method for enhancing their PEC water splitting performance. It also demonstrates that low oxygen annealing can activate a strong photoresponse of α-Fe2O3 on FTO glass even at a significantly lower temperature and for shorter times than previously reported, which is of high practical significance.
