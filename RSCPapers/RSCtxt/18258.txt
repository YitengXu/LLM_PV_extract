China. E-mail: liguobao@pku.edu.cnReceived 29th October 2012, Accepted 20th February 2013First published on 21st February 2013AbstractAnatase TiO2 nanotubes have been successfully synthesized via a topotactic chemical transformation from H2Ti3O7 nanotubes, in which the primary H2Ti3O7 nanotube frameworks can be preserved. The TiO2 nanotubes have an average outer diameter of around 8 nm and the inner diameter around 3–4 nm with 2 micrometers in length. Importantly, the nanotubes' shells are mainly formed by (113) planes perpendicular to the long axial of nanotubes, which is different from the structures found in the literature. The electrochemical properties are investigated by constant current discharge/charge measurements. There are potential plateaus at 1.75 and 1.93V in the process of Li insertion and extraction of the TiO2 nanotubes, and the initial Li insertion/extraction capacity is 590 and 298 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1, respectively. In the charge–discharge capacities of TiO2 nanotubes (calcination at 500 °C) at different current rates, the reversible capacity still remains at about 165 and 139 mA h g−1 at current density of 480 and 960 mA g−1, respectively with excellent coulombic efficiency of approximately 100%.IntroductionTitanium dioxide (TiO2) is an important n-type semiconducting material with excellent physical properties, chemical stability, environmental compatibility and low production cost. It has been highlighted by its myriad potential applications in multiple fields, such as photocatalysis,1–4 dye-sensitized solar cell5,6 and water splitting.7,8 Recently, TiO2 nanomaterials have also been intensively investigated as a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries due to its high storage ability of lithium ions, high rate capability and operation safety during charge/discharge cycling.9–17 TiO2 nanomaterials with variable polymorphs, morphologies and pore structures, such as nanocrystals, 1D nanostructures and porous nanostructures, have been synthesized by a variety of physical and chemical methods and were evaluated as electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries.18 As an alternative electrode material for Li-ion batteries, TiO2 possesses a much higher operating voltage (∼1.7 V vs. Li+(1M)/Li) than conventionally used materials of carbon-based electrodes (∼0.1 V vs. Li+(1M)/Li).It is widely accepted that the properties of nanomaterials are not only closely related to their sizes but also to their shapes. Therefore, controlling the morphologies of nanomaterials is one of the most important issues and effective ways to obtain desirable properties. One-dimensional (1D) nanoscaled materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), semiconductor nanowires and nanobelts exhibit interesting and useful properties and may be applied as building blocks for the integration of the next generation of nanoelectronics, ultrasmall optical devices, biosensors, etc. In recent years, many one dimensional TiO2 nanomaterials, such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods have been successively synthesized. Among them, TiO2 nanotubes are particularly interesting because of their large specific surface areas and their tube-like structure, which may supply sufficiently reactive points for the reaction. There are three main methods for the preparation of TiO2 nanotubes: the template method.19–21 anodic oxidation22–24 and the wet chemical method.25–27 The last technique has been proved useful to produce layered nanostructures.Herein, we report the fabrication of unique crystalline TiO2 nanotubes by a thermal decomposition from precursory H2Ti3O7 nanobelts based on the topotactic relationship between the (204) H2Ti3O7 and (113) TiO2 planes. During the formation of crystalline TiO2, the nanobelt frameworks could be maintained, as was expected based on previous work from titanate to anatase structured TiO2 nantubes.28 This topotactic growth will provide an effective and versatile route to controlled fabrication of nanostructured oxides with optimizable properties. The electrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanotubes as anode in Li-ion batteries will be presented.ExperimentalSynthesis of titanium dioxide nanotubes by hydrothermal synthesisSynthesis of the precursor. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received. Titanate nanotubes were prepared by hydrothermal reaction of titanium powders with a NaOH aqueous solution. In a typical experiment, about 0.4 g titanium powders were dispersed in 40 mL of 10 M NaOH aqueous solution. After sonication in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, the solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. The autoclave was maintained at 200 °C under autogenous pressure for 24 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally. The purpose of the ultrasonic treatment is to make the titanium powder better dispersed and wetted in the solution. The reaction product was washed with distilled water until a pH value of about 7 was reached to get sodium titanate nanotubes. The obtained sodium titanate nanotubes treated with a solution of 0.1M HCl for 10 h, and then rinsed with deionized water several times until a pH value of about 7 was reached. The washed samples were dried at 80 °C for 24 h and hydrogen titanate nanobelts were produced.Preparation of TiO2 nanotubes. In a typical preparation of TiO2 nanotubes, the as-synthesized H2Ti3O7 precursor was converted into pure TiO2 phase by calcination. The heating process was carried out in a crucible without using any inert gases for protection and the temperature was increased up to 500 °C at 10 °C min−1, and then maintained for 2 h.CharacterizationFinal products were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out with a Japan Rigaku D/max-rA X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation (α = 1.54178 Å) and an accumulative detector. The scan rate of 0.05° s−1 was used to record the patterns in the 2θ range of 20–70°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken with a JEOL-5600LV scanning electron microscope, using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) and the select area electron diffraction (SAED) images of TiO2 nanotubes were taken with a JEOL HRTEM (JEM2010 electron microscope) with 200 kV accelerating voltage.Electrochemical performanceFor the electrochemical measurements, coin cells (CR 2032) were constructed in a dry room to investigate Li-ion intercalation behavior. The active materials were mixed with acetylene black and LA132 (Indigo, China) at a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The dried material was coated on a copper foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 130 °C for 10 h and was pressed and then cut into a disc of diameter of 14 mm. The 2032 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box, and pure Li foils were used as the counter electrodes, a Celgard 2400 as the separator. The electrolyte was made of 1 M LiPF6 in the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with the volume ratio 1:1. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged over a voltage range of 1.0–3.0 V vs. Li+(1M)/Li at room temperature (25 °C) on a program controlled test system (CT2001, Land Battery Co., China).Results and discussionNa2Ti3O7 precursor nanotubesThe reaction of titanium powders and a NaOH aqueous solution at 200 °C can yield layered monoclinic-structured Na2Ti3O7. As shown in Fig. 1a, XRD pattern of the as-synthesized products exhibits an intense and sharp diffraction peak at ca. 10.5°, which is indicative of highly oriented growth. The main diffraction peaks are indexed as the (001), (102), (300), (112), (310), (303) and (122) reflections of monoclinic Na2Ti3O7 (JCPDS, 31-1329) with lattice constants a = 0.913 nm, b = 0.380 nm and c = 0.856 nm, which is in good agreement with the literature values. No reflection peak from crystalline Ti is observed in the as-prepared Na2Ti3O7. The above result also indicates that the typical product obtained here are fully monoclinic Na2Ti3O7 with high purity and crystalline quality, which is further proved by the SEM and HRTEM investment, as shown in Fig. 1b, 1c and 1d. A SEM image of Na2Ti3O7 nanotube sample is given in Fig. 1b. It indicates that the Na2Ti3O7 sample is an assembly of closely packed wires with lengths of several micrometers in scale. Scaling up by TEM images, Fig. 1c indicates that these tiny wires are composed of uniform nanotubes, while impurities including two-dimensional sheets or panels are not observed. The product's high purity and crystalline quality are further proved by the HRTEM investment. As shown in Fig. 1d, the lattice interplanar spacing has been determined to be 0.216 nm, corresponding to the (213) plane of monoclinic Na2Ti3O7, which suggests that the nanotubes grow preferentially through (213) plane stacking. Each nanotube thus obtained has an outer diameter of about 8 nm and an inner diameter of 3–4 nm. It is clear that the Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes have a highly oriented growth behavior and fairly high aspect ratio, which may improve their physicochemical properties, thus enhancing their practical applications. Fig. 1  (a) XRD pattern of as-obtained product. (b), (c) and (d) SEM images, TEM images, and HRTEM image of the as-prepared Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes. H2Ti3O7 precursor nanotubesThe as-obtained Na2Ti3O7 nanotubes were acidified with 0.1 M HCl and transformed into H2Ti3O7 nanotubes with similar sizes, as shown in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized products exhibits an intense and sharp diffraction peak at ca. 11.2° (Fig. 2a), which is assigned to the (200) reflection of monoclinic H2Ti3O7 (PCPDF 47-0561), indicative of highly oriented growth. The other main diffraction peaks are indexed as the (202), (203), (601), (113), (114) and (114) reflections, which is in good agreement with the literature values for the monoclinic H2Ti3O7. The nanotubes observed here are with an average outer diameter of about 8 nm and inner diameter of 3–4 nm in the ion-exchange-treated sample (Fig. 2c, 2d), similar to the sizes of Na2Ti3O7 before ion-exchange treatment (Fig. 1c, 1d). No change is observed in the porous structure of the nanotubes. Fig. 2  (a) XRD pattern of as-obtained product. (b), (c) and (d) SEM images, TEM images, and HRTEM image of the as-prepared H2Ti3O7 nanotubes. Thermal decomposition of H2Ti3O7Next, the above hydrogen titanate nanotubes were calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air to transform them into titanium dioxide nanotubes expected by us. The as-prepared TiO2 nanotubes are several micrometers in length with the outer diameter of about 8 nm, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3  (a) XRD pattern of as-obtained product after annealing at 500 °C. (b), (c) and (d) SEM images, TEM images, HRTEM and SAED image of the as-prepared TiO2 nanotubes. The overall crystallinity and purity of the as-synthesized samples were investigated by XRD, SEM and HRTEM measurements. The XRD pattern of the as-obtained TiO2 is presented in Fig. 3a. The main diffraction peaks are indexed as the (101), (004), (200), (105), (211), (204) and (116) reflections of tetragonal TiO2 (anatase phase) with lattice constants a = b = 0.379 nm and c = 0.951 nm, which is in good agreement with the literature values for the bulk TiO2 (JCPDS, 89-4203). No reflections of rutile and brookite phases are observed in the products. The above result indicates that the products obtained here are fully tetragonal TiO2 (t-TiO2) with high purity and crystalline quality, which is further proved by the SEM, HRTEM and SAED investment, as shown in Fig. 3b, 3c and 3d. SEM image in Fig. 3b and TEM image in Fig. 3c of the products exhibit the uniform nanotubes, which have an outer diameter of about 8 nm and an inner diameter of 3–4 nm. The above result also indicates that the products obtained here are fully t-TiO2 with high purity and crystalline quality, which is further proved by the HRTEM investment. As shown in Fig. 3d, the lattice interplanar spacing has been determined to be 0.204 nm, corresponding to the (113) plane of t-TiO2, which suggests that the nanotubes grow preferentially through (113) planes stacking vertical to the nanotube's axial lead. This special lattice structure is different from previous reports about anatase TiO2 nanotubes, whose shells are mainly composed of (101) planes.29–31 This new lattice structure may result in the difference in the properties of anatase TiO2 nanotubes.In this experimental process, we found that the pure anatase nanotubes with a tetragonal structure are formed when the titanate nanotubes are calcined at 500 °C for 2 h in air, which is also confirmed by the above observation. But in the products after the calcination at 400 °C, the anatase phase seems to coexist with the metastable monoclinic β-TiO2 (JCPDS 35-0088), which is proved by the XRD result, as shown in Fig. 4a. The SEM image (Fig. 4b) and TEM image (Fig. 4c) show tubular morphology clearly and no distinct morphological difference compared with TiO2 nanotubes calcined at 500 °C. As shown in Fig. 4d, the lattice interplanar spacings have been determined to be 0.203 nm and 0.201 nm, corresponding to the (113) plane of t-TiO2 and (11) or (01) plane of β-TiO2, which further confirms the XRD result.

Topotactic formation mechanismsThe formation mechanism of TiO2 is via a topotactic conversion process, which involves dissolution–crystallization process as shown in the schematic diagram (Scheme 1). Titanium particle precursor is initially dissolved and hydrolysed into titanate under the hydrothermal reaction. During the alkali-hydrothermal reaction, the titanium particle reacts with high concentration NaOH to form sodium titanate. Subsequently, the sodium titanate is washed with HCl to form hydrogen titanate and by-product sodium chloride. The Na+ cations distributing in the interspacing of the octahedra titanium complexes can be substituted with H+ cations by ion exchange when sodium titanate is immersed in HCl for a sufficient time, as reported in the literature.32 Anatase titania then is obtained under dehydration process at 500 °C. The entire chemical process that takes place is as follows:  3Ti + 2NaOH + 3O2 → Na2Ti3O7 + H2O(1) Na2Ti3O7 + 2HCl → H2Ti3O7 + 2NaCl(2) H2Ti3O7 → 3TiO2 + H2O(3) Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of titania and titanate phase transitions by the wet-chemical reactions through a topotactic conversion route. Thus, upon oxidation of titanium particles using NaOH and adequate acid washing (by ion exchange), metal Ti is conversed to form “Ti–O framework”—titanate and anatase titania. It is noted that the titanate and anatase titania have a common structural features, with crystal lattices consisting of the octahedra sharing four edges and the zigzag chain-like structure (Scheme 1). These chains are joined together by sharing edges to form layers and protons or Na+ ions can be incorporated between the layers. The distance between the layers is variable, which resulted in the high flexibility of these high aspect ratio nanostructures. In the reaction with the acid, the zigzag chain-like structural units of TiO2 nanotubes remain relatively unchanged other than lattice rotation and rearrangement of the [TiO6] octahedra to form anatase lattice.33 Thus, it is postulated that anatase titania phase formed on the basis of the parent titanate nanostructures. It is interesting to note that the produced titania and titanate nanostructures retain essentially the similar morphologies and interplanar crystal spacings (2.16 nm, 2.06 nm and 2.04 nm) along the nanotube's axial lead, even after intervention of different chemical processing steps, such as acid washing and high temperature treatment. This observation confirms that the titanate structural host motifs are easily intercalated with alkali metal with slight lattice rotation and rearrangement of crystal structures without modifying its final morphology. In addition, their similar interplanar crystal spacings and tube-like structures also increase the difficulty in direct observation of the topotactic conversion process through HRTEM and SAED measurements. But the above detailed structural measurements and analysis have proved the topotactic conversion mechanism adequately.Electrochemical performanceIn this work, the feasibility of TiO2 nanotubes for use in lithium electrochemical insertion has also been explored. As shown in Fig. 5a, the first discharge capacities of the products calcined at 500 °C and 400 °C are 221 and 591 mA h g−1, respectively, at a current density of 30 mA h g−1. For the 400 °C calcined products, during the first discharge (Li insertion), a total capacity of 591 mA h g−1 is achieved at the end of the first discharge with a reversible capacity of 298 mA h g−1, leading to an irreversible capacity of 293 mA h g−1. Its first discharge reaches 591 mA h g−1, much exceeding relevant theoretical capacity (335 mA h g−1). However, a big irreversible capacity loss of 293 mA h g−1 merges from first discharge cycle (591 mA h g−1) to first charge cycle (298 mA h g−1), corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 50.4%. Because β-TiO2 has better Li storage capacity than that of t-TiO2, it is obvious that after the first discharge most metastable β-TiO2 in the samples calcined at 400 °C transforms into stable t-TiO2, which has also been proved by XRD and HRTEM measurements (see ESI†). Their final capacity similar to that of the samples calcined at 500 °C also confirms the above speculation. As for the 500 °C calcined products, during the first discharge (Li insertion), a total capacity of 221 mA h g−1 is achieved at the end of the first discharge with a reversible capacity of 213 mA h g−1, leading to an irreversible capacity of 8 mA h g−1, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency of 6.4%. The potential rapidly drops to a well defined plateau at 1.73 V associated with the intercalation of Li+ through two phase equilibrium of a Li-poor (tetragonal) and a Li-rich (orthorhombic) phase. During charging, the lithium extraction from interstitial and octahedral sites of crystalline anatase takes place, which is identified from the plateau at 1.88 V. The loss of capacity may be due to the formation of a thin surface film at the electrode surface and irreversible reaction of Li+ with traces of water.19 In the first discharge process of calcined at 500 °C products, the potential rapidly drops and reaches a plateau of about 1.73 V, and then gradually decreases to 1.0 V. A short voltage plateau near 1.53 V can also be observed within the sloped region from 1.73 to 1.0 V. There is very small amount of lithium ions inserted into the TiO2 nanotubes before the plateau, and the lithium insertion capacity at the voltage plateau of 1.73 V is about 80 mA h g−1. Within the sloped region from 1.73 to 1.0 V there is also a large insertion capacity (about 140 mA h g−1). The Li-ion insertion/extraction reaction in TiO2 nanotube electrodes can be written as:  xLi+ + xe− + TiO2 ↔ LixTiO2(4) Fig. 5  (a) First potential-capacity profiles of TiO2 nanotubes at the charge/discharge current density of 0.1 C (30 mA g−1); (b) representative cyclic voltammogram plots of anatase TiO2 nanotubes electrodes at 0.05 mV s−1; (c) variation of discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency with the number of cycles for the anatase TiO2 nanotubes of 400 °C at the different current densities; (d) variation of discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency with the number of cycles for the anatase TiO2 nanotubes of 500 °C at the different current densities. The insertion coefficient, x, in anatase is usually close to 0.5.34 The first lithium insertion capacity of products calcined at 500 °C and 400 °C is observed to be 221 and 590 mA h g−1, corresponding to the lithium insertion coefficient of 0.66 and 1.76, respectively. The larger capacity obtained may be ascribed to a shorter diffusion length for both the electron and Li+ and a larger electrode/electrolyte contact area of TiO2 nanotubes compared with traditional materials, which facilitate the lithium ions' insertion and extraction. The subsequent Li+ extraction, proceeding up to 3.0 V, shows a capacity of 213 and 298 mA h g−1, with a relatively low coulombic efficiency (ratio of exaction to insertion capacity) of 96.4% and 50.4%, respectively. The lithium extraction capacity is only about 50 and 130 mA h g−1 within the charging potential window of 1.0–1.88 V in the first cycle, which is smaller than the capacity in the discharging potential region of 1.73–1.0 V, indicating that the irreversible capacity mainly occurs within the sloped region (1.73–1.0 V). The maximum extraction coefficient of lithium is calculated to be 0.77 and 0.56 from the extraction capacity. The potential plateaus at 1.73 and 1.93 V correspond to Li-ion insertion into and extraction from the interstitial octahedral sites of the TiO2 nanotubes and these Li ions are easily reversible. The long discharging potential plateaus imply a transformation from a Li-poor to a Li-rich phase during Li insertion, as a flat voltage response is characteristic of a two-phase electrochemical reaction. The main reason for the capacity drop during the first discharge/charge cycles is that a small part of the insertion/extraction of Li+ into/from TiO2 nanotubes is irreversible. This irreversibility should be related to the size, morphology, crystallinity of the as-synthesized samples.Fig. 5b shows an example of a cyclic voltammogram at the conditions of Li+ insertion into the products calcined at 500 °C and 400 °C. This voltammogram exhibits an unusual shape of the product calcined at 400 °C compared with that of the product calcined at 500 °C. The voltammogram is dominated by a pair of peaks denoted s, which is characteristic pseudocapacitive behavior of lithium storage in β-TiO2. Additionally, the remaining pair of peaks (formal potential 1.60 V and 2.16 V; denoted a) is the typical behavior expected for solid-state diffusion of lithium intercalation in anatase. Because the peak current of the s peak scales with the first power of scan rate and that of the peak a scales with square root of the scan rate, the peak current increment of peak s is much higher than that of peak a with the increase of scan rate.35 This implies that the fast pseudo-capacitive lithium transport dominates the lithium storage process at high currents.For comparison, Fig. 5c and Fig. 5d show the charge–discharge capacities and coulombic efficiency of the TiO2 nanotubes at different current rates. The results show the high discharge rate capability and excellent cycling stability of this nanostructured electrode, although an obvious drop of discharge capacity can be observed during the first several discharge–charge cycles. As shown in the Fig. 5c, the first discharge capacity can reach 591 mA h g−1. When changing the charge/discharge current density, the capacity still can keep stable to a corresponding level. Here the electrode has shown a relative high average cycling discharge capacity of 272 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 current density and can keep a very high capacity, even at high discharge rates (165 and 139 mA h g−1 at current density of 480 and 960 mA g−1, respectively). Those charge/discharge current densities are already much larger than those in commercial lithium ion batteries nowadays. For the Fig. 5d, the first discharge capacity can reach 221 mA h g−1. The TiO2 nanotubes calcined at 500 °C show a similar reversible capacity as found for the TiO2 nanotubes calcined at 400 °C. However, at high rate, the TiO2 nanotubes calcined at 500 °C display a much lower electrochemical capacity compared to TiO2 nanotubes calcined at 400 °C.ConclusionsIn summary, the calcination at high temperature leads to the formation of inner hollow nanotubes with pure anatase t-TiO2, which has a special planes stacking via a topotactic conversion route. It is demonstrated that the notable changes in the structure and tubular morphology have profound influence on the electrochemical lithium storage of the resulting products, as well as the reversible capacity, potential plateau, cycle stability and lithium intercalation mechanism. By comparison, the nanotubes calcined at 400 °C deliver the optimal electrochemical lithium storage performance, where the mixed process of the faradaic pseudo-capacitance and diffusion-limited reaction is observed due to the coexistence of β-TiO2 and anatase phases. Therefore, the fabrication of new materials with the delicate and functional 1D nanostructure is important for electrochemical lithium storage, and this study acquires useful knowledge for developing new lithium electrode materials.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, China (Nos.
