    , Accepted 31st July 2017First published on 1st August 2017AbstractHerein, an unprecedented monomeric bowl-like coordination complex, Ti12PgC3 (PgC3 = C-propylpyrogallol[4]arene), has been successfully synthesized. To the best of our knowledge, Ti12PgC3 not only presents the first pyrogallol[4]arene-based titanium coordination complex, but also the highest nuclearity titanium coordination complex in the metal–calixarene system. In addition, this titanium coordination complex can effectively degrade the methylene blue (MB) dye under sunlight.
The exploration of metal-coordinated macrocyclic assemblies is currently a fertile topic in chemical society not only because of the architectural beauty of metal-coordinated macrocyclic assemblies1 but also due to their immense technological applications in catalysts,2 optics,3 molecular magnets,4 and so on.5C-Alkylpyrogallol[4]arenes (PgCns, where n is the associated alkyl chain length), which contain four pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene; abbreviated as Pg) moieties linked together by –CHR– units to form bowl-shaped molecules, are members of the same family of macrocycles known as calixarenes.6 In recent years, PgCns have been shown to self-assemble into a variety of structural motifs such as supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs),7 hydrogen-bonded nanotubes/nanocapsules,8 as well as metal-seamed organic nanocapsules (MONCs).9
About a decade ago, Atwood and co-workers first reported that PgCn could coordinate with Cu(II) ions to form MONCs.10 Since then, a large number of PgCn-based coordination complexes with different structures and properties, depending on the kind of metal ions utilized, have been reported.9 According to their structural characteristics, these coordination complexes can be divided into three types: (1) dimeric Co-, Ni-, Cu- and Zn-seamed MONCs;11 (2) hexameric Mg-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, Zn- and Ga-seamed MONCs;12 and (3) K-, Rb- and Cs-based coordination polymers (Fig. 1).13 However, the coordination complexes based on PgCn are relatively unexplored as compared to the structurally related bowl-shaped polyphenolic calix[4]arenes and thiacalix[4]arenes. The latter form coordination complexes with various structures, such as clusters, MONCs, and coordination polymers, by chelating different metal centers including main group ions, transition metals, as well as lanthanide species.14 Thus, there is still a wide research space to prepare new PgCn-based coordination complexes and explore their properties.

The design and syntheses of sensitized crystalline polyoxotitanate clusters (PTCs) functionalized with different elements and chromophore moieties have attracted significant attention in recent years not only due to the precise structural information of PTCs but also due to their potential applications in solar energy conversion15 and decomposition of environmental pollutants.16 To the best of our knowledge, Power and coworkers have reported the first Ti–calixarene coordination complex, which is a dinuclear cluster capped by two tail-to-tail p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene ligands.17 After this, a variety of titanium clusters with different structures supported by different kinds of calixarenes, including calix[n]arenes (n = 4, 5, 6, and 8), thiacalix[4]arenes, and their derivatives, have been prepared.18 However, the nuclearity of these clusters has usually been very low (less than 4). Before this study, very recently, a Ti8 cluster is reported as the highest nuclearity titanium coordination complex, which is linked by two p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene ligands in a double cone conformation.19 In the present study, we have successfully obtained a novel high nuclearity titanium coordination complex, Ti12(O)4(PgC3)(OiPr)28 (abbreviated as Ti12PgC3; PgC3 = C-propylpyrogallol[4]arene, and OiPr = isopropoxide), supported by the PgCn macrocycle. Herein, the synthesis, structures, and photocatalytic properties of this Ti12PgC3 are presented.

C-Propylpyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3, Fig. 2) was prepared according to the previously reported condensation reaction of Pg and butanal catalyzed by concentrated hydrochloric acid.12a Solvothermal reactions of Ti(OiPr)4 with organic ligands, such as carboxylate, phosphonate, and azole, in HOiPr have been documented as an excellent synthetic method to prepare PTCs in recent years.15,16 In this study, this synthetic method has been extended to prepare a titanium coordination complex based on a macrocyclic ligand for the first time. Specifically, the reaction between PgC3 and Ti(OiPr)4 (1:30) in a HOiPr solution at 100 °C for three days affords red crystals of Ti12PgC3 in 55% yield.‡ Notably, the reaction of PgC3 and Ti(OiPr)4 with the ratio of 1:12 results in a product with low yield. Hence, an excess of Ti(OiPr)4 is necessary for this reaction. X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis shows that Ti12PgC3 crystallizes in the monoclinic system with the space group P21/c,§ and comprises a PgC3 ligand and twelve Ti ions. All upper-rim phenoxyl oxygens of the PgC3 ligand are occupied by Ti(IV) ions to form a bowl-shaped monomeric coordination complex with the height and diameter being about 1.5 nm and 2.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). Notably, the structure of Ti12PgC3 is significantly different from that of the previously reported PgCn-based coordination complexes with a dimeric/hexameric capsule and polymer structures. Further inspection reveals that twelve Ti centers are arranged in four trinuclear Ti3 clusters. Thus, we have only provided one structure of the Ti3 cluster (Ti1, Ti2, and Ti3) as a generic description because these four clusters are structurally analogous and show similarity in their coordination environments. The Ti3 cluster is linked by a μ3-oxygen atom, three phenoxyl oxygen atoms from two neighbouring Pg units, and seven OiPr groups (Fig. 3c). Every Ti center is six-coordinated by oxygen atoms and adopts distorted octahedral coordination geometries. Interestingly, Ti3 ion in the cluster is connected by the nearby phenoxyl oxygen from different Pg units; this has never been observed in the previously reported isolated coordination compounds in the metal-pyrogallol system. Further analysis shows that three Ti centers situate at the vertices of a nearly equilateral triangle with the Ti–Ti–Ti angles ranging from 59.16 to 61.03° and Ti⋯Ti distances ranging from 2.953 to 2.993 Å (Fig. 3d). The extended view of Ti12PgC3 along the a axis reveals that the coordination complexes are organized in a skewed bilayer structure (Fig. S1, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, this Ti12PgC3 represents the first example of a PgCn-based coordination complex with tetravalent metal ions, and the PgC3 ligand in this coordination complex is fully deprotonated.

Ti12PgC3 is significantly different from the previously reported coordination complexes with metal ions in monovalent, divalent, and trivalent states, in which the PgCn ligands are partially deprotonated and strong O–H⋯O hydrogen bonds exist. We noted that the ratio of the metal ions and PgC3 ligands in this Ti12PgC3 is 12:1, which represents the highest value in the calixarene system (Table 1). Moreover, this is also the first titanium coordination complex based on the ligands derived from Pg. In contrast, the ligands that comprise the closely related pyrocatechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene; abbreviated as Pc) units have been used to assemble with Ti(IV) ions by adopting different kinds of coordination modes to form many coordination complexes, as reported in the literature (Fig. 4).20

The solid-state absorption spectrum of Ti12PgC3 has been obtained at room temperature. It displays an intensive light absorption from the ultraviolet region up to 600 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The optical bandgap of Ti12PgC3 has been calculated via the Kubelka–Munk equation and is about 0.92 eV,21 revealing that the complex is a narrow bandgap semiconductor. Thus, the sunlight-driven photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) by Ti12PgC3 has been investigated. Typically, 20 mg of the finely ground powder of Ti12PgC3 was added to 20 mL of 30 ppm aqueous MB solution. Then, the mixture was stirred in the dark for 30 minutes to achieve the adsorption equilibrium before being exposed to sunlight (23 March 2017; North latitude 26°08′ and east longitude 119°30′). A sample solution of 3 ml was obtained at regular time intervals and separated by centrifugation to remove the suspended catalyst particles. Then, the filtrate was monitored by measuring the characteristic absorption of MB at about 665 nm (Fig. 3a and Fig. S3, ESI†). It can be found that the blue solutions of MB fades gradually to pale blue in 5 h, and the catalytic efficiency of Ti12PgC3 is about 99%. In our control experiments, the commercial TiO2 (P25) and blank solution have been measured under the same conditions. Both of them show low degradation efficiencies (Fig. 3b and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†); this indicates that the PTC functionalized with PgC3 indeed has an important influence on the photocatalytic process. The influence may be ascribed to charge transfer from the Pg units to the titanium oxo-core because a similar phenomenon has been reported with the PTCs with the similar Pc units, and they exhibit a red colour that originates from charge transfer from Pc to the PTCs.22 To test the photocatalytic stability of Ti12PgC3, recycling experiments were also performed. We noted that Ti12PgC3 retained high degradation efficiency even after 6 cycles (Fig. 3c). These very high values make this coordination complex an attractive recyclable photocatalyst in the field of degradation of pollutant organic dyes in water to address the environmental issues.
In conclusion, we have presented the first example of a PgCn-based bowel-like titanium coordination complex (Ti12PgC3), which has the highest nuclearity titanium coordination supported by the calixarene ligand to date. Moreover, this cluster shows high degradation activity and good recycling ability in solar-driven dye degradation. Further work will be focused on introducing other metal ions or auxiliary ligands to create different types of PgCn-based titanium compounds and exploring their photocatalytic abilities.

‡ Synthesis of Ti12PgC3: a mixture of Ti(OiPr)4 (0.92 ml, 3.0 mmol), PgC3 (0.10 mmol, 72 mg) in HOiPr (6 ml) was sealed in a 25 mL Teflon-lined bomb at 100 °C for 3 days. After cooled to room temperature, red block crystals of Ti12PgC3 were isolated by filtration, washed with isopropyl alcohol, and air-dried (yield: 55% based on ligand). Anal. calcd for Ti12PgC3 (C124H232O44Ti12): calcd C, 49.62; H, 7.80. Found: C, 48.69; H, 7.96. Upon mounting a number of the obtained crystals, it was observed that they had the same unit cell parameters, which revealed the uniformity of the sample.
