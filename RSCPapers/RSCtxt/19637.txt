    , Accepted 16th January 2023First published on 7th February 2023AbstractAqueous rechargeable nickel//bismuth batteries have surfaced as a prospective energy storage and conversion system because of their merits of good safety, high power density, and low cost. Their electrochemical performances, however, are heavily dependent on the electrode active materials. Herein, high-performance aqueous rechargeable nickel//bismuth batteries were assembled with Bi2MoO6@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as the anode active material and Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO as the cathode active material. Introducing rGO could effectively enhance the utilization of the electrode active materials, improving the specific capacity and rate performance. The Bi2MoO6@rGO delivered a specific capacity of 198.0 mA h g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and rate property of 75.9% in 1–20 A g−1. Additionally, the Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO exhibited specific capacities of 150.5 and 110.8 mA h g−1 at 1 and 15 A g−1, respectively. Accordingly, the nickel//bismuth batteries afforded a maximum energy density of 53.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 351.6 W kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1. This research demonstrates the great prospects for aqueous nickel//bismuth batteries and enriches the field of battery electrochemical systems.
1. Introduction
It is imperative to exploit high-performance battery technology to store and convert renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar, tidal, biomass, geothermal) to assist effectively tackling the issues from the excessive consumption of non-renewable fossil energy resources and environment pollution.1–8 Among the assorted energy-storage devices, commercialized lithium-ion batteries have been widely applied in our daily lives in view of their various merits, such as high energy density, no memory, high voltage, and small self-discharge.7,9–14 Nevertheless, the limited lithium reserves, stringent requirements for battery assembly, and especially, safety risks associated with the toxicity and flammability of organic electrolytes cannot be ignored. For instance, incidents including the Tesla Model S combustions in 2019, Samsung Note 7 explosions in 2016, and Boeing 787 battery fires in 2013 all posed serious threats to human life and property safety.11 Therefore, extensive attention has been paid to high-performance aqueous rechargeable batteries because of their long-term safety together with low budget.15–17
Alkaline aqueous nickel//metal batteries (mainly including nickel//iron, nickel//cobalt, nickel//zinc, nickel–metal hydride, etc.) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties. Bismuth, in aqueous KOH electrolyte, demonstrates a relatively negative potential window (−1.0–0 V), and has been reported to undergo multi-electron Faraday reactions. Also, bismuth-based materials are considered as promising anode active materials for aqueous rechargeable batteries. Originally reported in 2015, Yang et al.15 designed nickel//bismuth (Ni//Bi) batteries with (BiO)4CO3(OH)2 microspheres as the anode active materials and Ni(OH)2 as the cathode active materials, which delivered a high power density of 670 W kg−1 together with an energy density of 77 W h kg−1. Almost at the same time, Liu et al.10 evaluated the electrochemical performance of bismuth in 1 M LiOH, NaOH, and KOH aqueous electrolytes, and the corresponding capacities reached up to 121, 145, and 170 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, respectively. Afterwards, research on aqueous rechargeable Ni//Bi batteries was initiated. Up to now, multiple redox couples for aqueous Ni//Bi batteries have been successfully exploited, such as Ni/NiO//Bi@C,16 NiCo-LDH//Bi2O3,17 Ni/NiO//rGO/Bi,18 NiCo2O4//Bi,19 and CoNi3O4@C//Bi@C4), all delivering decent electrochemical performances. Our group also explored high-performance redox couples of NiMoO4@NiCo-LDH//Bi2O2CO3,20 and Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@NiCo-LDH//Bi2MoO6,21 and found that the characteristics of the electrode active materials play an essential role in enhancing the electrochemical properties of Ni//Bi batteries. Designing active materials with a high electron conductivity, developed pore structures, and more exposed active sites is necessary to enhance the electron-transfer ability, electrolyte ion-diffusion efficiency, and specific capacity of electrodes.
Bi2MoO6, as an n-type of semiconductor materials, is widely used as a photocatalyst.22–25 Interestingly, it can also exhibit excellent electrochemical properties as electrode active materials.26–29 In our previous work,21 a Ni//Bi battery using Bi2MoO6 microspheres as the anode active materials and Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@NCLDH nanoarrays as the cathode active materials exhibited a high energy density of 41.5 W h kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1, whereby the Bi2MoO6 microspheres displayed good electrochemical performance (163.2 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) owing to their highly porous structure. However, the low conductivity restricts the further improvement of the electrochemical performances for Bi2MoO6-based anode active materials and many challenges still remain, including the specific capacity, rate, and cycling performance of the electrode active materials together with improving the whole Ni//Bi batteries.
One of the effective ways to overcome the above limitations is by hybridizing electrode active materials with carbon materials (carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and graphene) as composite electrodes,30–35 which can make full use of the advantages of the active materials and carbon materials and increase the charge accommodation.36,37 Kong et al.28 investigated the electrochemical performances of a composite electrode composed of Bi2MoO6 and carbon spheres, which displayed an excellent specific capacity of 521.42 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte with the potential range from −0.2 V to 0.5 V. Also, a Bi2MoO6/polyaniline composite electrode29 also manifested a high specific capacitance of 826 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte within the potential range of −0.2–0.6 V. The above results both confirmed that the composite of Bi2MoO6 and carbon materials could be expected to achieve excellent electrochemical performance. However, it should be noted that Bi2MoO6-based active materials can manifest better electrochemical performance in a negative potential window than in a relatively positive potential range.21 Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is considered to be an excellent two-dimensional (2D) carbon material for improving the electrochemical performance of electrodes on account of its large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good mechanical properties.34,35 Thus, it can be expected that combining Bi2MoO6 with rGO would further enhance the electrochemical performances of electrode materials in the negative potential window and the corresponding Ni//Bi battery.
Herein, anode active materials composed of Bi2MoO6 and rGO were designed for Ni//Bi batteries, and delivered a largest specific capacity of 198.0 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 150.3 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1. Meanwhile, rGO was also hybridized with the screened Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 as a cathode active material. With the optimal dosage amount of graphene oxide (GO), the cathode exhibited a specific capacity of 150.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. The aqueous rechargeable Ni//Bi battery model assembled with the above electrode active materials demonstrated outstanding electrochemical performances, such as a high specific capacity of 75.4 mA h g−1 with a maximum energy density of 53.1 W h kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
All the reagents used are of analytical grade, and they were used directly without further purification. The GO for the anode was obtained from the Shanxi Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The GO solution for the cathode was prepared according to the literature.38
2.2 Preparation of the anode active materials
Graphite oxide (10, 25, and 50 mg) was first added into a mixed solution consisting of 50 mL ethanol and 20 mL ethylene glycol, respectively. After homogeneous dispersion, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (970.1 mg) and Na2MoO4·2H2O (242 mg) were added into the above mixed solution in turn and subjected to ultrasonication and stirring. Then, the solution was treated by a solvothermal method at 180 °C for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the anode active materials were obtained by filtering, washing, and freeze-drying. According to the amount of graphite oxide added, the corresponding anode active materials were designated as Bi2MoO6@rGO-X (X = 10, 25, and 50).
2.3 Preparation of the cathode active materials
The cathode active materials were synthesized by a hydrothermal method followed by annealing. First, GO solution (the mass of GO was 5, 10, and 15 mg) was dispersed into 70 mL H2O, respectively, and sonicated in an ice-water bath for 3 h to obtain homogeneous GO dispersion solution. Afterwards, 1 mmol Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 1 mmol Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 2 mmol Na2MoO4·2H2O, and 12 mmol hexamethylenetetramine were dissolved into the above GO solution. After continuous agitation, the hybrid solutions were hydrothermally reacted at 150 °C for 6 h, followed by filtering, washing, and freeze-drying. Finally, the materials were obtained by calcinating in a tube furnace at 400 °C for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The samples prepared at different GO masses were named as Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X, where “X” stands for the GO mass. (For example, the sample Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-5 was prepared with 5 mg GO).
2.4 Material characterizations
The structure, surface elemental constituents, micromorphology, and specific surface area, along with the pore-size distribution of the electrode active materials were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 ADVANCE), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, 250Xi), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6390LV, JEOL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai-12), and a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ-MP analyzer.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical performances of the electrode active materials were tested in a three-electrode configuration with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. Herein, platinum plate was used as the counter electrode, and mercury/oxidized mercury with a double-salt bridge was adopted as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the electrode active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone coated on the nickel foam, followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h and pressed under 10 MPa. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using an electrochemical working station (CHI660e) at room temperature, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The mean mass loading for the three-electrode test was about 3.36 mg cm−2 for Bi2MoO6@rGO-10, 3.28 mg cm−2 for Bi2MoO6@rGO-25, and 3.76 mg cm−2 for Bi2MoO6@rGO-50, respectively. The average mass loading for the cathode active materials was about 4.56 mg cm−2 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-5, 4.24 mg cm−2 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10, and 3.76 mg cm−2 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-15, respectively.
2.6 Assembly and measurement of the Ni//Bi battery
A two-electrode battery was assembled into one PTFE mold using Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 as the anode (1 cm × 1 cm), Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 as the cathode (1 cm × 1 cm), and 6 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The cathode and anode were activated for 100 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 before assembly. The total mass of the electrode active materials for this Ni//Bi battery model was approximately 9.2 mg.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the anode active materials
The crystal structure and phase composition of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X were characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 1a, which was in accordance with the standard pattern of Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no. 71-2086)39. Also, the specific XRD pattern of Bi2MoO6 can be clearly seen in our previous work.21 The characteristic peaks of rGO could not be observed, which may be ascribed to the better exfoliation, lower content, and weaker diffraction peak intensity of rGO.40–42 The full spectrum of XPS in Fig. 1b indicated the presence of Bi, Mo, C, and O elements in the Bi2MoO6@rGO-25. The Bi 4f spectrum (Fig. 1c) could be fitted into two peaks centered at 164.5 and 159.3 eV, corresponding to Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2, respectively, which indicated Bi was in the +3 oxidation state.27,43,44 Two characteristic peaks situated at 232.3 and 235.5 eV could be observed and were assigned to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, suggesting that the element Mo existed in the form of Mo6+ (Fig. 1d).21 The high-resolution spectrum of C 1s displayed three peaks at 284.5, 285.2, and 288.2 eV, representing the Sp2 hybridized carbon, C–O, and CO, respectively (Fig. 1e).39,45,46 From the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 1f), three types of oxygen-containing functional groups at 529.5, 530.2, and 531.2 eV were detected, corresponding to Bi–O,21 Mo–O,28 and CO,46 respectively.

The specific surface area and pore structure of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X were determined by N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, as shown in Fig. 2. The apparent hysteresis loops indicated that the Bi2MoO6@rGO-X compounds were predominantly mesoporous. The specific surface areas of Bi2MoO6@rGO-10, Bi2MoO6@rGO-25, and Bi2MoO6@rGO-50 were 43.7, 48.2, and 51.8 m2 g−1, respectively, which were all lower than the pristine Bi2MoO6 microspheres (55 m2 g−1) in our previous work,21 but still higher than 2D Bi2MoO6 nanosheets@rGO (15.54 m2 g−1)40 and Bi2MoO6 nano-petal@charcoal spheres (37.1 m2 g−1).28 The above results demonstrate that the introduction of rGO can affect the specific surface area and pore-size distribution of Bi2MoO6.

The SEM images in Fig. 3a and b clearly showed that GO possessed typical 2D sheets with some degree of agglomeration. Bi2MoO6@rGO-X presented an irregular granular morphology. The hybridizing state of rGO with Bi2MoO6 could be clearly seen in Bi2MoO6@rGO-50, where Bi2MoO6 particles were anchored onto the surface of rGO (Fig. 3e and f). From Fig. 3g, it could be observed that Bi2MoO6 was tightly bound to rGO in Bi2MoO6@rGO-25. Note, the micromorphology of pristine Bi2MoO6 can be observed in our previous work.21 As displayed in Fig. 3h, the selected area electron diffraction pattern reflected the polycrystalline nature of Bi2MoO6.21 The HRTEM images (Fig. 3i) showed lattice spacings of 0.315, 0.385, 0.378, 0.811, and 0.326 nm, which were in agreement with the (131), (130), (111), (020), and (140) crystal planes of Bi2MoO6, respectively.

The electrochemical behavior of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X was studied using a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 4a depicts the CV curves of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The significant redox peaks indicated that energy storage mainly relies on a Faraday redox reaction.47 As exhibited in Fig. 4b, apparent charge/discharge voltage platforms could be observed in the GCD curves of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X at a current density of 1 A g−1. Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows the CV curves of Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 at a series of scan rates, which were similar to other bismuth-based anode active materials, like Bi2O2CO3,20 Bi2MoO6,21 Bi2O3,17 and Bi2WO6.47 Meanwhile, two oxidation peaks (Peak 1 and Peak 3) together with one reduction peak (Peak 2) could be observed, and moved toward the two ends of the potential window, respectively, with increasing the scan rate from 1 mV s−1 to 30 mV s−1. The redox reactions of Bi2MoO6 can be expressed as follows:48,49 BiO2− + e− → BiO22−(1) (2) Bi0 → Bi(metal)(3)Additionally, the peak currents of the redox peaks gradually increased, and the geometry of the CV curve was well sustained, fully demonstrating the superior rate performance of Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 as an anode active material. The corresponding b-values for Peak 1, Peak 2, and Peak 3 were calculated to be b1 = 0.5412, b2 = 0.50201, and b3 = 0.71648, respectively (as shown in Fig. S1b, ESI†), suggesting the electrochemical behaviors of Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 were mainly dominated by a diffusion-controlled process, and Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 belonged to a typical battery-type electrode active material.21,50,51 Apparent charge/discharge voltage plateaus in the GCD curves of Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 at different current densities were observed, corresponding to the redox peaks on the CV curves. The CV and GCD curves of Bi2MoO6@rGO-10 together with Bi2MoO6@rGO-50 can be seen in Fig. S2 (ESI†). With increasing the current density, the mean specific discharge capacity decayed gradually. However, the specific capacities of Bi2MoO6@rGO-X were higher than for Bi2MoO6 at every single current density, and Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 presented the largest specific capacity. The average specific capacities could reach up to 198.0, 186.3, 179.8, 175.2, 171.3, 167.8, 163.9, 162.4, 157.0, and 150.3 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 A g−1, respectively. The electrode displayed good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 56.8% at 15 A g−1 after 1500 cycles, which was higher than that of the hierarchical Bi2MoO6 nanosheets27 but less than that of the pristine highly porous Bi2MoO6 (Fig. 4e), which may be ascribed to the micromorphology change after the introduction of rGO. To further demonstrate the electrochemical behaviors of Bi2MoO6@rGO-25, EIS tests were executed and the Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 4f. A semicircle and real axis intercept in the high-frequency region could be clearly seen, representing the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and internal resistance (Rs), respectively.52–54 Compared to Bi2MoO6 in our previous work,21 Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 exhibited a higher value of Rs (0.92 Ω) as well as Rct (13.1 Ω). During the preparation process, Bi2MoO6 adopted GO flakes as a growth substrate, then nucleated and grew into a granular material. In addition, the conductivity of the composites also increased after the introduction of rGO, which could improve the utilization of the active materials.

3.2 Characterization of the cathode active materials
As illustrated in Fig. 5a, Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X possessed a similar diffraction pattern to Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 in our previous work.21,47 Also, no significant diffraction peak of rGO was found, which was similar to Bi2MoO6@rGO-X. The XPS survey spectrum (Fig. S3, ESI†) revealed the presence of Ni, Co, Mo, O, and C elements on the surface of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10. Fig. 5b displays the high-resolution spectrum of Co 2p. The main peak at 781.6 eV and the satellite peak at 786.4 eV were related to Co 2p3/2, and the main peak at 797.6 eV and the satellite peak at 802.7 eV could be assigned to Co 2p1/2, indicating the element Co existed in the Co2+ state.55 In the high-resolution spectrum of Ni 2p shown in Fig. 5c, the main peak at 856.2 eV and the satellite peak at 861.6 eV corresponded to Ni 2p3/2, and the main peak at 874.6 eV together with the satellite peak at 879.8 eV could be assigned to Ni 2p1/2, indicating the element Ni was in the divalent oxidation state.55,56 Two characteristic peaks of Mo 3d5/2 (232.2 eV) and Mo 3d3/2 (235.3 eV) were observed with an energy difference of 3.1 eV, indicating that Mo existed in the form of Mo6+(Fig. 5d).57–59 As shown in Fig. 5e, the high-resolution spectrum of O 1s was split into four fitted peaks: the O1 peak at 530.2 eV, associated with the metal–oxygen bond, and the O2, O3, and O4 peaks at 531.6, 532.6, and 534 eV corresponding to OH−, O–CO and H2O, respectively.60 As demonstrated in Fig. 5f, the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s fitted the sp2 hybridized carbon peak at 284.4 eV, C–O peak at 285.4 eV, and CO peak at 286.8 eV,46 respectively.

GO for the cathode active materials (Fig. S4, ESI†) presented a 2D lamellar morphology, which means it could provide a growth substrate for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4. As exhibited in Fig. 6, introducing GO significantly changed the micromorphology of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4. Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 microspheres, composed of intertwined nano-thin “ribbon-like” layers (shown in our previous work47), turned into irregular particles after introducing GO. The 3D porous microspheres disappeared and the structure became more compact. Based on our previous work,21 it is speculated that Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 could assemble into nanosheet arrays onto nickel foam adopted as the growth substance, and Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 could self-assemble into porous microspheres when there is no substrate during the hydrothermal process. When GO was adopted as the growing substance, Ni2+ and Co2+ were attracted by the oxygen functional groups with negative charges. The lower content GO led to Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 agglomerating into irregularly particles scattered on the carbon sheet surface. The TEM images in Fig. 6d and e showed that Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 was thicker in the middle parts and more transparent at the edge portions, further verifying the irregular granular morphology of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10. The SAED pattern (Fig. 6f) revealed the polycrystalline characteristic of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10.61,62

Fig. 7 illustrates the adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore-size distribution profiles of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X. The evident hysteresis loop indicated the presence of a large number of mesopores.63 The specific surface area and total pore volume were 68.9 m2 g−1 and 0.1398 cm3 g−1 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-5, 103.2 m2 g−1 and 0.2144 cm3 g−1 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10, and 46.9 m2 g−1 and 0.07886 cm3 g−1 for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-15, respectively, which were smaller than those of the pristine Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 (293 m2 g−1, 0.8997 cm3 g−1),47 but the specific surface area for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 was still larger than hollow NiMoO4 nanorods (37.79 m2 g−1),56 NiMoO4 (39.8 m2 g−1),64 and NiMoO4-rGO (50.8 m2 g−1),33 suggesting that the introduction of rGO not only changed the morphological structure, but also impacted the specific surface area and pore-size distribution of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X.

The electrochemical behaviors of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X were evaluated by CV, GCD, and EIS tests. Significant redox peaks were observed in the CV curves at 5 mV s−1 (Fig. 8a), implying the energy storage of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X mainly relied on Faraday redox reactions.65,66 As displayed in Fig. 8b, the GCD curves of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X at 2 A g−1 possessed visible charge/discharge voltage platforms, which corresponded well with the redox peaks on the CV curves. Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 exhibited the longest voltage plateau, indicating the introduction of rGO efficiently improved the utilization of the active materials and enhanced the specific capacity. As presented in the CV curves of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 ((Fig. 8c), the redox peaks were shifted toward the ends of the potential window, respectively, with increasing the scan rate, suggesting the movement rate of the electrolyte ions was limited at higher scan rates.67 The reversible redox reactions for Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 can be expressed as the following equation:64 Co0.5Ni0.5MoO + 0.5OH− ⇔ Co0.5Ni0.5MoOOH0.5 +0.5 e−(4)The b-values were calculated as b1 = 0.8143 and b2 = 0.7357, respectively (Fig. S5a, ESI†), illustrating the electrochemical behaviors of the Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 cathode were influenced simultaneously by diffusion-controlled processes and the surface capacitive effects.52,62 In addition, it was found that the GCD curves of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 in various current densities possessed a distinct charge/discharge voltage plateau, which gradually moved toward the lower potential as the current density increased (Fig. 8d). Additionally, the CV and GCD curves of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-5 together with Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-15 can be seen in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Fig. 8e displayed the specific capacity of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-X, which exhibited a gradual decay with increasing the current density. Also, the average specific capacities of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 could reach up to 150.5, 148.2, 145.7, 143.3, 140.7, 138.0, 135.3, 129.2, and 110.8 mA h g−1 at current densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 15 A g−1, respectively. Besides, Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 showed the smallest charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of about 0.37 Ω, which could be ascribed to the introduction of rGO improving the charge-transfer efficiency during the electrochemical reactions.61 However, the Rs (around 0.79 Ω) of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 was larger than that of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4 (0.69 Ω),47 which may be related to the change of the morphology and structure after introducing rGO (Fig. 8f). Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 acquired an excellent capacity retention ratio of 52.2% after 2500 cycles at 15 A g−1, exhibiting superior structural stability (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The introduction of rGO would increase the utilization of the composite and enhance the specific capacity. However, similar to anode active materials, the cyclic stability of Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO was also not further improved compared to the pristine electrode active materials. This may be related to the micromorphology change from 3D porous microspheres to an irregular granular morphology after introducing rGO, which is not conductive to maintaining superior cycling stability.

3.3 Performance of the Ni//Bi battery
To further investigate the practical application of these electrodes, a Ni//Bi battery model was assembled with Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO-10 as the cathode active materials, Bi2MoO6@rGO-25 as the anode active materials, and 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte. Fig. 9a shows the CV curves of the Ni//Bi battery at various scan rates, where we can observe clear and discernible redox peaks, exhibiting that the battery primarily relied on Faraday redox reactions to store energy.68 The CV curve became polarized with the increase in scan rate, which was associated with the internal resistance of the battery.69–72 The typical GCD curves at different current densities ranging from 0.5 to 10 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 9b and Fig. S7a (ESI†). The charge/discharge voltage plateau agreed well with the redox peak of the CV curves. As shown in Fig. 9c, the specific capacities of the Ni//Bi cell were 75.4, 69.8, 63.7, 59.2, 57.1, 54.0, 51.0, 45.1, and 40.0 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 A g−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9d, the small quasi-semicircular diameter and high angle straight line indicated a low internal resistance and fast electrolyte ion-diffusion behavior of this Ni//Bi battery. The cycling performance of the cell is shown in Fig. 9e. It delivered a capacity retention of 47.9% after 1400 cycles at 2 A g−1 with a corresponding Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98.6%. The Ni//Bi battery exhibited a maximum energy and power density of 53.1 W h kg−1 and 3471.2 W kg−1, which were comparable to other energy storage devices reported in the literature, such as 34.29 W h kg−1 and 329 W kg−1 of NiO//Bi2O3@C Ni//Bi batteries8, 21.8 W h kg−1 and 660 W kg−1 of Ni(OH)2@3D Ni//AC SCs,73 and 36.2 W h kg−1 and 160 W kg−1 of CoNiO2//AC SCs,74 and other energy storage devices.75–82 As shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†), two Ni//Bi batteries models connected in series could light up a red LED bulb. From the above electrochemical tests, this aqueous rechargeable Ni//Bi battery shows potential applications in energy storage and conversion.

4. Conclusions
In summary, aqueous rechargeable Ni//Bi batteries based on Co0.5Ni0.5MoO4@rGO and Bi2MoO6@rGO were assembled. The introduction of rGO could effectively improve the utilization efficiency of the electrode active materials, partly improving the electrochemical performances of electrodes together with the full cell. The Ni//Bi battery manifested excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 75.4 and 40.0 mA h g−1 at 0.5 and 10 A g−1, respectively. Also, the energy density and power density at 0.5 A g−1 were about 53.1 W h kg−1 and 351.6 W kg−1. This work indicates the promising application prospects of this novel aqueous rechargeable Ni//Bi battery system.
