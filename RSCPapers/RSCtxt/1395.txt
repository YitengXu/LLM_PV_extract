Introduction
In the last decade, photovoltaic devices fabricated using low-cost semiconductor materials and facile routes, such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic photovoltaics (OPV), and quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), have been substantially researched.1–4 Benefiting from solution processing, printing, and roll-to-roll manufacturing, these types of solar cells are more cost-effective in converting solar energy to electricity when compared with their conventional inorganic counterparts, such as Si or GaAs.5–7 A recently emerging class of solid-state hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite-based solar cells, which have evolved from conventional DSSCs, has demonstrated remarkably high power conversion efficiencies of over 19%.8 Most state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells typically have a device structure that is based on a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold on which organometal halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), are grown as light-harvesting materials.9 This metal oxide scaffold is particularly crucial for the pure iodine based perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells for achieving high power conversion efficiencies because of the relatively lower carrier diffusion length (∼100 nm) of CH3NH3PbI3 compared to its chlorine incorporated counterpart (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) which had been demonstrated to have a carrier diffusion length of over 1 μm.10,11 Mesoporous TiO2 films, typically used in DSSCs, are the most popular scaffold materials for perovskite-based solar cells, and are responsible for accepting electrons from the absorber and transporting them to the electrode. The synthesis of mesoporous TiO2 films typically requires sintering at high temperatures (450–550 °C) prior to their use, which may cause the limitation of perovskite solar cells being deposited on flexible substrates and affect their compatibility with fabrication processes in multi-junction solar cells. Several studies have focused on identifying new scaffolds or interlayer materials and developing low-temperature deposition processes for perovskite-based solar cells.12–18 For example, a perovskite-based solar cell with a mesoporous Al2O3 thin film as the scaffold fabricated at temperatures under 150 °C has been reported.15 A solution-processable ZnO-nanoparticle thin film requiring no sintering was reported to be an efficient electron-transport layer in CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells.16 In this work, inspired by the device concept of a “bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)” in polymer solar cells, which consists of an intimate donor–acceptor interpenetration morphology in photoactive layers for creating large interfaces,19 we propose a new device structure for bulk intermixing (BI)-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 nanorod (NR) hybrid solar cells as shown in Fig. 1(a). Instead of using high-temperature sintered scaffold materials, the dispersed TiO2 NRs from chemical synthesis were intermixed with the perovskite absorbing layer to form a BI-type perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid for device fabrication using spin coating. Through interface engineering between the TiO2 NR surface and the photoactive perovskite material of CH3NH3PbI3, a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 12% was achieved using the simple BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid device structure. Compared with the conventional mesoporous TiO2 scaffold used in perovskite-based solar cells, the proposed hybrids not only provide great flexibility for deposition on various substrates using spin coating at low temperature but also enable layer-by-layer deposition for the future development of perovskite-based multi-junction solar cells.

Experimental
Preparation and characterization of TiO2 NRs

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic device structure of a BI-type perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cell. High-aspect-ratio anatase TiO2 NRs were synthesized through hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide according to the literature but with modifications20 (see the ESI†). The as-synthesized TiO2 NRs were typically capped with oleic acid (OA) surfactants, which contain long alkyl chains, to preclude aggregation. The dimensions of TiO2 NRs were approximately 30–40 nm in length and 4–5 nm in diameter, as shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of Fig. 1(b) and (c). The representative TiO2 NR HRTEM image reveals the TiO2 anatase phase along the [010] zone axis. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the TiO2 nanocrystals (Fig. 1(d)) exhibits the typical signature of an anatase crystal structure. The more intense and narrower full width at half maximum of the (004) diffraction peak compared with that of the (200) and (211) peaks indicates the anisotropic nanocrystal growth of TiO2 NRs with a rod-like geometry, which is consistent with the HRTEM image.
Ligand exchange treatment of TiO2 NRs
The interface engineering between the TiO2 NR surface and the photoactive perovskite material of CH3NH3PbI3 was accomplished by surface ligand exchange on TiO2 NRs with different molecules, such as pyridine (PYR) and acrylic acid (ACR). To remove the original surface ligand of OA on TiO2 NRs, the as-synthesized TiO2 NRs were first sonicated with methanol and extracted using repeated centrifuge separation. The extracted product was dispersed into PYR or ACR solutions and sonicated for 30 min for homogeneous dispersion. For TiO2 NRs in the PYR solution after sonication, it was further stirred at 75 °C until the solution turned clear. Accordingly, the original ligand molecules of OA were removed, and the pyridine molecules of a weakly bonded ligand that were on the surface of the TiO2 NRs could be removed by heating. The ACR-capped TiO2 NR powder was extracted after sonication by centrifuge separation with acetone and was re-dispersed into the DMF solvent for device fabrication. The detailed ligand exchange process is provided in the ESI.†
Fabrication of BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cells
For device fabrication, a thin compact layer of TiO2 was first deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate, which formed an electron selective collection layer. We modified the sequential deposition processes (also known as a two-step process)21 to deposit the iodine perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)/TiO2 NR hybrid film, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The as-synthesized OA-capped TiO2 NRs of various concentrations were mixed with the PbI2 precursor dissolved in a dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent (0.7 M); the solution was mildly stirred at 90 °C overnight to obtain homogeneous nanocrystal dispersion. The stirred solution of PbI2 and TiO2 NRs was then deposited as a film of approximately 250 nm thickness on the substrate using spin coating (step 1, Fig. 2(a)). Subsequently, a methylammonium iodine (MAI, CH3NH3I) solution (10 mg ml−1 in isopropyl alcohol) was deposited on the pre-coated PbI2/TiO2 thin film for further reaction, resulting in the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid layer (step 2, Fig. 2(a)). The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hybrid thin film was annealed at 90 °C before depositing an organic hole transport layer, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). The BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid layer was fabricated at a relatively low temperature of 90 °C compared to the fabrication temperature of conventional perovskite solar cells using mesoporous TiO2 or Al2O3 scaffolds.9,15Fig. 2(b) shows a planar scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid layer, where a favorable surface coverage of perovskite crystalline domains with 200–500 nm grain size is observed. Fig. 2(c) shows the color-enhanced cross-sectional SEM image of a BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cell with a multilayered device structure consisting of FTO/compact TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3–TiO2 NR hybrid layer/spiro-OMeTAD/Au.

Results and discussion
To gain more insights into the nanoscale morphology of the perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film, we employed electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode (Fig. 3(a)–(c)) to investigate the correlation of the morphology and elemental mapping of the hybrid layer. We examined the PbI2/TiO2 hybrid film at the first step, before an MAI solution was added, to avoid potential mixing of the elemental mapping signals of iodine from PbI2 and MAI. Fig. 3(a) shows the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM image of the hybrid thin film. In a HAADF-STEM image, contrast is proportional to atomic number; heavier atoms scatter more electrons to the annular detector and therefore appear bright in the image. Conversely, regions with lighter atoms are dimmer, and the empty region in the sample (e.g., a crack) is black. EELS spectra were recorded while the STEM probe was scanning the region indicated in Fig. 3(a). By filtering the energy-loss signals of electrons scattered by Ti and I, the distributions of Ti and I elements were determined as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), representing the TiO2 NRs and PbI2 distributions respectively. The elemental maps clearly indicate that the TiO2 NRs and PbI2 phases during the first-step process are intermixed and form an interpenetrated morphology. After the MAI solution was added to the PbI2/TiO2 NR hybrid film at the second-step process, a CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid layer is formed. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) depth-profile analysis was further used to investigate the vertical distribution of TiO2 NRs in the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film. Fig. 3(d) shows the evolution of Ti 2p core level spectra from the top surface to the bottom of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid layer. No Ti 2p signal was observed from the top surface to a depth of 100 nm, indicating the absence of TiO2 NRs near the top surface. From a depth of 100 nm to the bottom of the hybrid layer, Ti 2p core level photoemission signals with binding energy peaked at 458.8 eV (Ti 2p1/2) and 464.3 eV (Ti 2p3/2) corresponding to the Ti4+ bonding were clearly observed.22 The depth-profiled XPS spectral signatures of the fabricated CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film suggest that the vertical distribution of TiO2 NRs was the consequence of the two-step deposition. In the first step, TiO2 NRs were mixed with PbI2 solution to form a PbI2/TiO2 hybrid thin film of approximately 250 nm thickness. In the second step, MAI solution was drop-cast onto the hybrid thin film to form the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 hybrid; after this reaction, the thickness of the hybrid thin film increased from 250 to 350 nm which is probably due to the volume expansion from the intercalation of MAI and the framework transformation from the edge-sharing octahedral structure in PbI2 to the corner-sharing octahedral structure in perovskite.23 Most TiO2 NRs were distributed in the region between the bottom and 250 nm from the bottom, whereas the region closer to the top surface of the hybrid film contained pure iodine perovskite of CH3NH3PbI3. The combined results of STEM-EELS elemental mapping and XPS depth profile analyses suggest that iodine perovskite and TiO2 NRs formed an interpenetrated morphology (except in the top 100 nm) based on a low-temperature solution process, which is similar to the morphology of conventional bulk-heterojunction polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells.24,25

Typically, the as-synthesized TiO2 NRs are capped with an insulating OA surfactant containing long alkyl chains and it may be a potential charge transfer barrier at the perovskite/TiO2 NR interface. In addition, the solubility of the as-synthesized TiO2 NRs in DMF was limited by the difference in polarity arising from the nonpolar molecules of the OA ligand and the polar molecules of the organic DMF solvent; this may cause difficulty in the deposition of high-quality thin films. To further improve the charge transfer efficiency and compatibility of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids, ligand exchange treatment was performed to modify TiO2 NR surfaces by removing the original OA ligand or replacing it with a more effective interfacial molecule. Two different kinds of ligand molecules of pyridine (PYR) and acrylic acid (ACR) were used to replace the OA ligand. Fig. 4(a) shows the corresponding chemical structures of these surface ligands on TiO2 NRs. To remove the insulating ligands, OA-capped TiO2 NRs were first sonicated with methanol and extracted using repeated centrifuge separation. The extracted product (TiO2 NR powder) was re-dispersed into PYR or ACR solutions and stirred at a heated temperature until the solution turned clear to obtain PYR-capped and ACR-capped TiO2 NRs, respectively; the details related to ligand exchange processes are provided in the ESI.† Ligand-exchanged TiO2 NRs were extracted using centrifugal separation with hexane and subsequently re-dispersed into the polar DMF solvent. The DMF solution containing nonpolar OA-capped TiO2 NRs is slightly turbid, whereas those containing PYR- and ACR-capped TiO2 NRs are clear and transparent, which is a result of the improved solubility of TiO2 NRs in DMF after the ligand exchange treatment. Fig. 4(b) shows the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) transmission spectra of TiO2 NRs before and after ligand exchange treatment with PYR and ACR, respectively. In the spectra, the bands at 2930 and 2850 cm−1 are assigned to the antisymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching vibrations of the –CH2– groups in the hydrocarbon moiety of the long alkyl chain, respectively.26 After ligand exchange treatment with PYR, a substantial reduction of the absorption intensity corresponding to C–H vibrations of the long alkyl chain was observed, suggesting that a certain amount of the original insulating OA ligands was removed. The characteristic peaks of PYR are at 1581, 1437, 1030, and 991 cm−1, which are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric ring breathing and the C–C and C–N stretching modes, respectively. Because the PYR molecules bind weakly to the surface of TiO2 NRs, the amount of PYR on TiO2 NRs was expected to be low because it is easily removed by heating.27 The non-vanished bands at 2930 and 2850 cm−1 indicate that a certain proportion of OA remains on the TiO2 NR surface after PYR ligand exchange treatment. For the ACR-capped TiO2 NRs, almost no C–H vibrations of long alkyl chains were detected and the COO– vibration modes shifted from the original bands centered on 1525 and 1420 cm−1 for OA molecules to 1529 and 1433 cm−1 corresponding to the vibration modes of ACR molecules, indicating that the ligand exchange treatment nearly completely removed the insulating OA with a high coverage of small ACR molecules. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching spectra were further used to reveal the charge transfer efficiencies of the perovskite solar cells before and after the ligand exchange treatment.28 The inset of Fig. 4(c) shows the PL emission yields of the three CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids with different interfacial ligands on the TiO2 NR surface. The PL quenching efficiencies Q for the three samples were QACR > QPYR > QOA, indicating that a more efficient charge separation can be achieved at the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR interface by either removing the insulating surfactant or replacing it with a more effective ligand. The influence of these interfacial modifiers on the charge transfer efficiencies of CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids through interface engineering can be further revealed using time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectroscopy measurements, as shown in Fig. 4(c); the PL lifetime of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 is displayed for comparison. The measured PL lifetimes for pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids with OA, PYR, and ACR surface ligands were τpristine = 24.71 ps, τOA = 20.10 ps, τPYR = 14.29 ps, and τACR = 5.85 ps respectively. The addition of TiO2 NRs in CH3NH3PbI3 results in a new relaxation process, which provides the donor a further non-radiative process, leading to shortening of the measured lifetime τ. The PL lifetimes for the three CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid films were τACR < τPYR < τOA, indicating that more efficient charge transfer can be achieved at the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR interfaces after ligand exchange treatment.

The corresponding photovoltaic devices based on these CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids with different surface modifiers were fabricated. A planar iodine perovskite solar cell without intermixing with TiO2 NRs was fabricated for comparison. Fig. 4(d) shows the current–voltage characteristics of devices with various interface modifiers measured under AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). All the BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR solar cells clearly exhibited higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies than those of a pristine CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell without intermixing with TiO2 NRs. For a planar CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell with an approximately 350 nm thick active layer, the photo-generated carriers are not effectively collected by the electrodes because the diffusion length of pristine CH3NH3PbI3 is only about 100 nm,10 and the carriers undergo loss via radiative and non-radiative annihilation. It was reported that holes are extracted considerably more efficiently than electrons in tri-iodine CH3NH3PbI3 so that CH3NH3PbI3-based cells therefore require more mesoporous electron conductors to achieve high efficiencies,29 as compared to their chlorine incorporated counterpart where the diffusion lengths for both charge types are comparable.11 This phenomenon explains why CH3NH3PbI3−xClx planar devices can achieve a much higher efficiency (>15%) as compared to CH3NH3PbI3-based cells with a similar planar device structure (approximately 4%).11 The BI morphology consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 NR hybrids substantially reduced the probability for carrier recombination and improved the carrier transport of devices, as a result of the increased short circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of devices after intermixing CH3NH3PbI3 with TiO2 NRs. The device containing as-prepared OA-TiO2 NRs as electron acceptors showed an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.97% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.89 V, a JSC of 12.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.53, which are higher than the corresponding values for a planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 4.01%, a VOC of 0.87 V, a JSC of 11.2 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.40, respectively. Further improvement in device performances can be achieved by either removing the original OA ligand or replacing it with more effective surface modifiers. Because the number of OA ligands on the TiO2 NR surface was substantially reduced after ligand exchange treatment with PYR, the device consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and PYR-TiO2 NR hybrids showed an improved power efficiency of 7.56% with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 13.7 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.59. The device consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 NR hybrids after ligand exchange treatment with ACR molecules exhibited a further enhanced performance on the PCE of up to 9.97% with a VOC of 0.99 V, a JSC of 15.5 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.65, which is attributable to the increased charge transfer and transport efficiencies after replacing the original OA ligands with the more effective ACR molecules. Table 1 summarizes the detailed parameters of the photovoltaic performances of all devices. All of these devices were fabricated using the same concentration of TiO2 NRs of 0.5 mg ml−1. The device consisting of a CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 NR hybrid film with ACR molecules as the interface modifier exhibited superior overall charge transfer efficiency and device performance, consistent with the enhanced PL quenching efficiency and reduced TRPL lifetime. Fig. 5(a) shows the optimization of the BI-type perovskite solar cells containing various amounts (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg ml−1) of ACR-TiO2 NRs dissolved in PbI2 solution. Increased PCEs were observed when ACR-TiO2 NRs were added to the CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 NR hybrids. The device containing 1.0 mg ml−1 of ACR-TiO2 NRs demonstrated the optimal device performance and achieved a PCE of 12.32% with a Voc of 1.00 V, a Jsc of 17.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.70. The corresponding external quantum efficiency EQE spectrum for the best-performing solar cell is shown in Fig. 5(b) and the integrated photocurrent density was consistent with the measured current–voltage curve under AM 1.5 illumination. Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic performances of the devices containing various amounts of ACR-TiO2 NRs. As the concentration of ACR-TiO2 NRs was higher than 2.0 mg ml−1, the aggregation of TiO2 NRs resulted in a rough surface morphology of the perovskite thin film (as shown in the ESI†) and consequently a deteriorated device performance. It is worth noting that owing to the relatively longer diffusion length of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (approximately 100 nm) compared with that of polymers such as P3HT (approximately 10–20 nm),30 the optimal TiO2 concentration required for BI-type perovskite solar cells is substantially lower than that in typical BHJ polymer solar cells using TiO2 NRs as electron acceptors, which typically required 10 mg ml−1 for a favorable BHJ morphology.25

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated a new device structure for a BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cell, where dispersed TiO2 NRs were intermixed with a perovskite absorbing layer to form a BI-type perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid for device fabrication. The proposed structure eliminates the need for the high-temperature sintered metal oxide scaffold materials used in conventional CH3NH3PbI3-based perovskite solar cells. Using the ligand exchange treatment to replace the insulating OA ligands with the more effective ACR molecules on TiO2 NR surfaces, the low-temperature solution-processable BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cells achieved a remarkable PCE of over 12%, which is considerably higher than that of planar CH3NH3PbI3-based devices fabricated without TiO2 NRs. The BI-type perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid has the unique advantage of being able to be deposited on various substrates using spin coating at low temperature; in addition, it provides great flexibility on layer-by-layer deposition for the future development of perovskite-based multi-junction solar cells. The device performances of BI-type perovskite/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cells can be further improved by optimizing the TiO2 NR dimensions, improving their crystalline quality, and modifying their surface ligands.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Device architecture of a bulk intermixing (BI)-type perovskite solar cell. The active layer consisted of the CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2 NR hybrids. (b) TEM and (c) HRTEM images of TiO2 NRs. (d) XRD diffraction pattern of TiO2 NRs showed good consistency of the anatase crystal structure with anisotropic geometry.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Sequential deposition processes of a BI-type perovskite layer. A PbI2/TiO2 hybrid solution was spun-coated in the first step and a CH3NH3I solution was then drop-cast onto the PbI2/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film in the second step to grow the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film. (b) Top-view surface morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR intermixed hybrid layer and (c) SEM cross-section image of a BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid perovskite solar cell.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Planar-view HAADF-STEM image of the PbI2/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film. (b and c) EELS elemental maps of Ti and I, respectively. (d) XPS depth profile of the Ti 2p binding energy of a BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid thin film.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Chemical structures of surface ligands of oleic acid (OA), pyridine (PYR) and acrylic acid (ACR). (b) FTIR transmission spectra of TiO2 NRs before and after surface ligand exchange treatments. (c) TRPL spectra and the inset of PL spectra of the pristine CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrids with various surface ligand exchange treatments. (d) The corresponding current–voltage curves of the photovoltaic performances of these devices under AM 1.5 solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Device performances of BI-type CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 NR hybrid solar cells with various ACR-capped TiO2 NR concentrations. (b) EQE spectrum of the best-performing solar cell. The verified photocurrent density by integrating the EQE spectrum is also shown.
