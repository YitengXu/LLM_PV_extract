Newman, Andrew J. Orr-Ewing and Michael N. R. AshfoldAbstractCavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a laser-based absorption spectroscopy technique that is starting to find extensive application as a consequence of the very high sensitivity of the method compared with more traditional absorption spectroscopy techniques. We describe the experimental implementation of CRDS and its application to a number of areas of research including laser diagnostics of hostile environments, reaction kinetics and spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on our ongoing studies of the fast (sub-nanosecond) predissociation of electronically excited states of small molecules and radicals.
