    , Accepted 17th July 2022First published on 23rd July 2022AbstractWith the rising need for energy resources, considerable work has done for building novel energy storage technologies. Supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries are a highly competitive choice for electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) due to their ultrahigh power density, improved rate capability, long-term cyclability, and remarkable safety. Because of their novel properties such as high mechanical flexibility, large specific surface area (SSA), chemical stability, and superior electric and thermal conductivities, graphene-based nanomaterials (NMs) have attracted considerable attention as alternative electrode materials for EESDs. Graphene is gaining a lot of interest since it has amazing qualities including 230000 cm2 V−1 s−1 charge mobility, 3000 W m−1 K−1 thermal conductivity, 2.3% visible light absorption, 130 GPa mechanical strength, and 2600 m2 g−1 specific surface area (SSA). Mechanical exfoliation, reduction of graphene-oxide, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and epitaxial growth of graphene–NMs are some of the synthetic procedures that can change these characteristics. Despite much effort, the detailed screening of high-performance electrode materials, such as graphene-based NMs, is still necessary. We covered the recent advancements in graphene-based NM research and development for high-performance batteries and SCs for specific applications in the next generation and smart electronics in this study. First, we discuss rechargeable batteries, a new-concept based on graphene with high energy density, longer life, improved safety, and shape-diversity capabilities in order to meet the needs of future electronics. Second, we discuss SCs for the present advanced nanotechnologies that outperform batteries with respect to power density, cyclability, quick charging/discharging rates capability, straightforward principles, high activity of the charge circulation, and low maintenance expenditure, including electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs). Finally, graphene-based electrodes used in ESDs with their prospects and problems are briefly reviewed.
1. Introduction
Most of the worldwide power generation is accounted for by hydrocarbon fossil fuels such as petroleum oil, coal, and natural gas. For the past several decades, however, the fast depletion of fossil fuels due to their rising use has shifted the research dominantly to the progress and usage of renewable energy resources, for example wind, tidal, solar energy, and hydrogen.1–105 Energy storage technologies must be efficient for renewable energies to be broadly used at domestic as well as industrial levels. Portable electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric car applications are being extensively expanded to meet the needs of our information-rich, mobile culture. Electrochemical systems for energy storage devices (ESDs), e.g., lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), metal–air batteries (MABs), and electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also known as supercapacitors (SCs) and ultracapacitors,106 are being conceived and developed for enhanced energy storage in ESDs.107–109
Advanced electrode materials with optimized structure, chemistry, and morphology have been synthesized to develop the energy/power density of ESDs. Significantly, incorporating nanostructured active nanomaterials (NMs) into a highly conductive matrix provides desirable functionality as well as the possibility of good energy storage, high rate capabilities, and extended electrode material lifespan.110 Due to the abundant resources, bending nature of bonds, light weight, cost-effectiveness, and environment friendliness of carbon-based electrode materials, they stand out among other prospective possibilities. Carbon compounds provide a crucial and closely related role in sustaining life on earth, despite the fact that everyone must lead a “low-carbon” lifestyle. The three distinct hybridizations of carbon, namely, sp, sp2, and sp3, make it an extremely alluring element.111 In the past two decades, research on full carbon materials (CMs) has accelerated at the cutting edge of synthetic organic chemistry. Researchers today are producing novel two-dimensional (2D) CMs, and the application of these materials depend on the types of carbon atoms that are mixed with various morphologies, including fullerenes (0D, 1985),112 carbon nanotubes (1D, CNT, 1991),113 and graphene (3D, 2004),114 as well as different characteristics. Different C-allotropes, such as CNTs, fullerene (sp2), G (sp2), and diamond (sp3), have been created over the past two decades by the hybridization of various carbon atoms. These materials have been successfully used in a variety of applications. Carbon-enriched molecules and substances (such as G,114 graphite,115 diamond, fullerene116 nanostructures, and amorphous carbon117,118) exhibit a wide range of electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties that enable several superior functionalities, but herein, we will concentrate only on graphene NMs.53–56,65,69,71,72,76,79,80,86,119–126
The design and synthesis of novel low-dimension CMs is one of the hottest subjects that scientists have been pursuing in recent years, and G, a two-dimensional (2D) NSs made up of the sp2 linked single-layer (SL) carbon (C) atoms with a honeycomb lattice configuration, has sparked considerable interest in advanced nanotechnology because of its extensive novel application possibilities.127 G, a single-atomic thick 2D nanosheet (NSs), has long been thought as the foundation material of all other dimensional C-compounds as well as 2D materials.127,128 G-NMs have a number of prominent intrinsic chemical and physical properties due to their novel structure, including high mechanical strength (1 TPa),129 extremely high electrical/thermal conductivities,130 and large SSA (2675 m2 g−1),131 which may compete with or even exceed both those of single-walled C-nanotubes (SW-CNTs) as well as multiwalled C-nanotubes (MW-CNTs). Novel SL NSs, high-performance NCs,132 and transparent conducting films,133 are suitable for sensors,134 actuators,135 nanoelectronics,136,137 ESDs, etc., which are just a few of the uses for this incredibly versatile 2D-C NM.138 Because of the advantageous combination of outstanding mechanical and electrical qualities and huge SSA, using G-based NMs as SCs and secondary batteries electrode has attracted significant scientific investigation in the direction of renewable energy nanotechnological devices.139 As a consequence of the current modern society's requirements and developing environmental concerns, research into creative, economical, environment-friendly, and high-performance ESDs has become important.140 G-NS have been employed as a suitable building block for G-based NMs with attractive functionalities as alternative electrode materials due to their novel nanostructural qualities of large SSA, flexibility, chemical stability, and better electric and thermal conductivity. The current breakthroughs in the use of graphene and graphene-based NMs for few frontier electrochemical ESDs systems, namely LIBs, sodium ion batteries (SIBs), Li-sulfur batteries (LSBs), Li/Zn-air-batteries (LABs/ZABs), and SCs, are the main subject of this review article.105,123–126,141–193
2. Preparation of graphene
It is worth noting that G-NMs, as 2D flexible NSs type novel NMs, have the ability to provide additional active sites for carriers at the basal plane as well as at the edges as compared to graphite. Depending on the intended size, purity, and efflorescence of the particular product, the term “synthesis of G-NMs” refers to any procedure for synthesizing or extracting G-NMs. Several synthesis procedures have been established to create thin graphitic films and few layer (FL) G-NMs since the discovery of G-NMs in 2004. The most widely utilized techniques are mechanical cleaving (exfoliation),194 chemical exfoliation,195 chemical synthesis,196 and thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD).197 Microwave synthesis198 and unzipping nanotubes199 are two more approaches that have been documented. Although it has been discovered that mechanical exfoliation using AFM cantilever could fabricate FL G-NMs, this method is limited by the thickness of G-NMs, which range from *10 nm to 30-layer G-NM.
By introducing heavy alkali ions between the graphite layers, solution-dispersed graphite is exfoliated using the chemical exfoliation process. Similar procedures include creating graphite oxide, dispersing it in a solution, and then reducing it using hydrazine. This method is known as chemical synthesis. Similar to the synthesis of CNTs, catalytic thermal CVD has been shown to be the most important method for producing huge amounts of G-NMs. Thermal CVD is the name given to the thermal CVD method that uses a resistive heating furnace. Plasma enhanced CVD or PECVD is the name given to the thermal CVD technique that uses plasma-assisted growth. Since each method has its limitations, each synthesis process varies depending on application of the obtained G-NMs. For instance, the mechanical exfoliation approach can fabricate monolayer to FLs of G-NMs, but the likelihood of successfully getting a structure like that structure is relatively low. In addition, chemical synthesis methods are low-temperature methods that make it easier to build G-NMs on a variety of substrate types at room temperature (RT), particularly on polymeric substrates. However, the large-area synthesized G-NMs that result from this technique are scattered and non-uniform. Again, graphite oxide is often only partially reduced by the G-NMs made from reduced G-oxides (rGOs), which causes sequential degradation in the electrical characteristics based on the degree of reduction. In contrast, thermal CVD techniques are more suited for fabricating large-area devices and are useful for complementing metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology in the future.36 Another way to create G-NMs is by the process known as epitaxial G-NMs, which involves thermally graphitizing an SiC surface. However, this approach has some drawbacks, including a high process temperature and the difficulty to transfer onto other substrates. A homogeneous layer of thermally chemically catalyzed carbon atoms may be produced on metal surfaces and transmitted over a variety of substrates, making the thermal CVD process distinct. The flow chart in Fig. 1(a) provides an overview of G-NM production methods.

The epitaxial development of G-NMs on metal or SiC substrates, CVD, chemical reduction, thermal reduction, electrochemical synthesis, and liquid phase exfoliation are some of the synthesis techniques that have been established to manufacture G-based materials.200 Another scalable and effective way for the formation of graphene with an increased yield is the reduction of G-oxide (GO). GO is a highly oxidized type of G-NMs that contains hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl, and epoxy functional groups. The occurrence of the oxygen functional groups at the edges and basal plane of the G-NSs transforms sp2-bound G-NSs into a hybrid of sp2 and sp3 C. The defects in the sp3 regions alter the G-NS's natural conjugated structure, lowering its overall strength and conductivity. The existence of several functional groups in GO, on the other hand, promotes processability and creates a center of attention for a broad variety of uses as a multifunctional material. Marcano et al.201 reported an enhanced version of the Hummers’202 technique for producing GO from graphite with elevated yield and efficiency in 2010 (Fig. 1(b)). The enhanced approach replaces NaNO3 with KMnO4, and the process is carried out in a 9:1 combination of H2SO4 and H3PO4, as opposed to the Hummers’ method. The ability to successfully convert the GO to a G-like structure by removing the oxygen functional groups while retaining the conjugated structure was a key property (Fig. 1(c)). rGO is a term used to describe the product obtained when GO is reduced. Laser light modifies GO by removing the oxygen-containing groups, turning GO into a more graphene-like nanomaterial, which is one of the potential methods. Thermochemical or thermal methods can be used to reduce GO. The heat treatment, calcination temperature, and annealing environment have a direct impact on the thermal reduction of GO.
The abrupt generation of CO and CO2 gases that grow into the gaps in the G-NSs causes the exfoliation of the GO-NSs. The C to oxygen ratio (C/O) of the resultant rGO might surpass 13 if the calcination temperature goes over 750 °C, according to Schniepp et al.203 However, the C/O ratio is barely 7 when annealing is done below 750 °C. Li et al.204 used XPS to monitor the chemical structure when the annealing temperature changed, and they determined that a high heat treatment is required to obtain a satisfactory reduction of GO. Wu et al.205 studied the arc-discharge technique to reduce GO at temperatures exceeding 2000 °C, and G-NSs had an electrical conductivity of roughly 2000 S cm−1 with the C/O of 15–18. Aside from heat treatment-based calcination conditions, the applied environment during heat treatment is also important in the reduction of GO-NMs. Oxygen should be removed during reduction because the etching of oxygen is substantially intensified at elevated temperatures. As a result, thermal reduction takes place in a vacuum or in an inert environment. Due to the great reducing ability of H2 under a high heat treatment, Wu et al.208 were able to produce a conductivity of 1103 S cm−1 with C/O of 14.9 by the calcination of GO for 2 h in Ar-H2 ratio of 1 at a comparatively low heat treatment of about 450 °C. The utilization of chemical reagents (reducing agents) at room temperature (RT) or reasonable heat treatment can also be employed to reduce GO. N2H4, NaBH4, and HI are the most widely utilized reducing agents.209 However, while utilizing these compounds, caution must be used exercised as they are dangerous to the human health and environment as well as introduce contaminants into the C matrix. Fernandez-Merino et al.210 suggested a harmless GO approach including vitamin-C (ascorbic acid) to circumvent these drawbacks. With a C/O ratio of 12.5, the resultant rGO had an electrical conductivity of about 77 S cm−1. Another successful approach for reducing GO is electrochemical reduction, which involves reducing GO in an electrochemical cell at RT. Zhou et al.211 electrochemically generated an rGO film, which had a conductivity of 85 S cm−1 with a C/O ratio of 23.9. Solvothermal reduction is an emerging environment-friendly chemical reduction method, in which reduction is done within a sealed system, and the solvent is heat-treated at its boiling point by raising the pressure during heat treatment. Zhou et al.212 described a method for converting GO to a stable G-NSs solution by controlled hydrothermal method-based reduction. The reducing agent in the hydrothermal reduction is overheated supercritical H2O, which changes the characteristics of the resultant rGO substantially due to the increased pressure and temperature. Wang et al.213 used N,N-dimethylformamide as the solvent and a minor amount of hydrazine to perform solvothermal reduction at 180 °C for 12 h, yielding rGO with a C/O ratio of 14.3. In the next section, we will elaborate on ESDs applications of G and G-based NMs. For further details about the synthesis method, readers are referred to our recently published article.98
3. Graphene applications in ESDs: secondary batteries
3.1 Graphene-based anode NMs for Li-ion batteries (LIBs)
First time, Sony Company promoted the LIBs in the early 1990s as a result of its elevated voltage, high energy density, long cycle life, light weight, and ecological friendliness as compared to traditional batteries. As a result, LIBs have become an important EESD for a broad range of electronic uses.214,215 LIBs are typically fabricated by a negative electrode (anode), a positive electrode (cathode), and an electrolyte between these electrodes. During charging, the cathode discharges Li-ions, which flow to the anode, and during discharging, the reverse happens. Graphite is a frequently utilized anode material due to its economical, low voltage, and long cycle life.216,217 However, it has a low theoretical specific capacity (372 mA h g−1) and a high volume change.218 Furthermore, because of the short graphite interlayer spacing of 0.34 nm, Li ion diffusion is sluggish during rapid charge–discharge cycles.219 Electric cars and portable electronic gadgets will suffer as a result of sluggish Li ion diffusion. LIBs have piqued attention as an efficient EES technology because of their high energy density (120–170 W h kg−1), long-life, and improved safety over previously established traditional batteries. However, despite their high energy density, LIBs have a substantially lower power density than ECs, an additional key energy storage technology; for example, few hours charging period is often required for mobile phones or laptops with LIBs on the market today. The development of LIBs still faces a significant scientific and technical challenge in achieving high power and energy density at quick charging/discharging rates ranging from several minutes to seconds.
The de-intercalation/insertion of Li-ions that travel in cathode and anode materials show how the LIBs’ charging and discharging mechanism works.214 The pace at which Li ions and electrons travel all the way through the electrolyte and electrode determines how powerful the LIB is. As a result, finding novel materials with elevated conductivity for rapid electron transport, high specific surface area (SSA), and strong nanostructures with shorter Li-ion diffusion length is critical for creating high-power LIBs, which we are using these days. In this regard, G-based NMs is believed to be a promising contender due to its higher conductivity, outstanding mechanical flexibility, strong chemical stability, and large SSA (2630 m2 g−1).220 In the next sections, recent G-based research work in LIBs and the achieved advantages will be summarized.

3.1.1. Application of pristine graphene in the LIBs as anode. 
As previously stated, graphite is an often used anode material in LIBs. Recently, abundant research has been performed in the development of LIBs for the replacement of electrode materials. G-NM has been recognized as a viable anode replacement material. This is because G-NM has outstanding features such as a large SSA, broad electrochemical window, higher conductivity, higher theoretical capacity, and strong chemical diffusivity for Li ions.221 It has been claimed that G-based NMs can replace graphite because it can house Li-ions, increasing the lithiation sites and storage capacity with a theoretical capacity of about 744 mA h g−1,222 which is superior to that of graphite and carbonaceous materials.222,223 The most extensively researched G-based NMs are generated from GO, which have been described as anodes for the LIB.224 Electrical conductivity was thought to be poorer in graphene with considerable defects and disorder.
As the G-based NMs may have great thermal and electrical conductivity, the large SSA, strong mechanical strength, and broad electrochemical window, make it a viable contender for anode materials in LIBs.225 However, LIBs with pure G-NMs-based anodes have been observed to be unable to deliver steady potential outputs, posing a barrier to their practical deployment. On the other hand, when using pristine G-NMs as an anode material, Li atoms quickly form clusters, resulting in dendrite formation and a significant loss in the charge/discharge capacity.226 As a result, precise approaches such as altering the G-NM's surface, edge, grain boundary, point defects, complementary synergy effects, doping, and alloying have been used to tackle these aforementioned problems. Variable solutions have been arrived at to overcome this difficulty and boost the performance of G-based ESDs electrodes, whose benefits and difficulties will be explored in the next section.139


3.1.2. Defected graphene NSs (DG-NSs)-based LIBs electrodes. 
Pan et al.227 used DG-NSs to accommodate Li-ions in their experiment. GO-NSs were prepared using three distinct synthesis methods, i.e., hydrazine reduction, pyrolytic de-oxidation, and electron beam irradiation. The electrochemical data of G-NMs-supported anode NMs were obtained (Fig. 2). Fig. 2(a and b) shows the first-cycle charge/discharge curves for graphite, pristine-GO, hydrazine rGO, pyrolytic GO, and electron beam rGO (I to VI). As a result, defective graphene has large reversible capacities (794 mA h g−1) and strong cycle stability, making it a suitable candidate for LIBs.

Hu et al.228 conducted another investigation on DG-NSs with a hole structure. The DG-NSs were generated utilizing a simple and scalable technique in which Co was utilized as a C gasification electrocatalyst. This gap will allow Li to be inserted into the graphene creases and overlap. Fig. 2(d) demonstrates the first seven charge/discharge patterns of the produced DG-NSs at 100 mA g−1. The first discharge and charge capabilities of the DG-NSs were quite impressive, reaching up to 1595 mA h g−1 and 1009 mA h g−1, respectively. The outcome also discloses the development of a solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) on the electrode surface of DG-NSs, and the reaction of a residual O-containing functional group with Li ions, resulting in irreversible capacity (RC) after the 1st cycle. The specific capacities of DG-NSs and G-NSs are shown in Fig. 2(e). At the second and seventh cycles, the specific capacity of DG-NSs drops to 1009 mA h g−1 and 968 mA h g−1, respectively. After five cycles, the specific capacity of G-NSs dropped to 800 mA h g−1. Furthermore, at current densities (J) of 300 mA g−1, 500 mA g−1, and 1000 mA g−1, DG-NSs had reversible specific capacities of 898 mA h g−1, 667 mA h g−1, and 453 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 2(f)). The high rate charge/discharge features are caused by the short diffusion distance of the Li ions to DG-NSs. After 40 cycles, the reversible capacities of DG-NSs remained 804 mA h g−1. The obtained findings show that the generated DG-NSs are suitable anode material candidates. Thus, other techniques have been employed to overcome these difficulties, which we will explain in the next section.


3.1.3. Alloying graphene-based LIBs electrodes. 
3.1.3.1. Silicon (Si)/graphene alloy-based LIBs electrodes. 
Since the present marketable traditional anode material (graphite), which has a small theoretical capacity of about 372 mA h g−1,230 more research into new NMs for anodes in the LIBs has been ongoing. To improve the anode performance in the LIBs, scientists experimented alloying graphene with Si, Sn, and Ge. Hu et al.231 compared Si/G nanocomposite (NC) to Si-wolfram carbide/G (Si-WC/graphene) NCs. Si/G-NCs was shown to have a high capacity, outstanding cyclability, and great high rate capabilities. After 200 cycles at 0.4 mA cm−1 between 0.01 and 1.5 V, the discharge capacity loss was just 0.21% cycle−1 with a capacity retention of 866 mA h g−1 and a Coulombic efficiency (CE) >99.0%, while a significantly low decay-rate of 0.07% was achieved at 0.02 and 2.0 V. Ren et al.232 also investigated Si/G anode in the LIBs, in which crystalline Si was prepared via the CVD technique and subsequently placed onto the G-NMs to generate a Si/G anode. Si/G-NCs have been discovered to have high use of Si in the charging/discharging operations, which improves the electrochemical performance of the LIBs. In addition, the half cells obtained capacity retention of 553 mA h g−1 after 500 complete cycles and an average CE of over 99.5%. Another important technique to take G-based NMs to the commercial level was alloying it with other materials.
3.1.3.2. Tin (Sn)/graphene alloy-based LIBs electrodes. 
In addition to Si, an Sn alloy incorporating the G-based NM was investigated. Chen233 developed two batches of Sn/G-NSs NCs with different weight ratios by means of the collective treatment of the microwave hydrothermal effect and H2 reduction. The Sn/GNS-1 ratio was 1:1, whereas the Sn/GNS-2 ratio remained about 1:4. The electrochemical performance of the G-NSs and Sn/G-NSs was evaluated using galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles with voltages in the range of 0.005–3 V and J of 80 mA g−1. Fig. 3(a–c) illustrates the TEM images at different magnifications and EDS mapping of NSG. The G-NSs have a high Li storage capacity due to the presence of edge-type sites, nanocavities, or defects that provide active sites. The Sn/G-NSs-2 electrode that has an elevated initial reversible specific capacity (946 mA h g−1), a large J at a specific capacity of ∼1600 mA h g−1, and an elevated specific capacity of ∼542 mA h g−1, displayed the greatest and most stable cycle performance after 30 cycles among the samples tested. The tolerance of the Sn/G-NSs electrode may be tested using different J. Sn/G-NSs-2 was further investigated by cycling it at various J values of 0.1C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, and 5C, and then back to 0.1C. When J grows, the capacity of the system decreases, which demonstrates that the Sn/G-NSs-based NCs can withstand high current charge and discharge.

3.1.3.3. Germanium (Ge)/graphene alloy-based LIBs electrodes. 
Germanium (Ge) has a larger Li-ion diffusivity than the other Group-IV elements, resulting in improved rate performance. The results of the study by Gao234 showed that Ge/G/CNTs may be used as the LIBs anodes. The sample's electrochemical characteristics were examined at 1 A g−1, and the results revealed that the reversible specific capacity of Ge/G/CNTs was 1524 mA h g−1 at the 10th cycle, which was closer to the predicted capacity of Ge (1600 mA h g−1). However, when the J increased from 1 to 40 A g−1, the reversible specific capacities of Ge/G/CNTs fell, but they could still be maintained after 111 charge/discharge cycles when it was adjusted back to 1 A g−1. The electrode was still distributed at elevated specific capacity of about 1245 mA h g−1 with just 0.18% capacity degradation for each cycle, indicating superior rate capacity and structural stability. The cycling performances of Ge/G/CNTs were studied at 0.5 A g−1, and it was discovered that the Ge/G/CNTs anode specific capacity remained at 1315 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with elevated capacity retention of 91%. The reversible specific capacities recorded after 200 cycles at 1 A g−1 and 2 A g−1 were 1586 mA h g−1 and 1517 mA h g−1, with capacity retention of 57% and 51%, respectively. Ge/G/CNTs also have high rate capability of 803 mA h g−1 at 40 A g−1. As a result, the Ge/G/CNTs anode has elevated cycling stability and rate capability. Similarly, doping G-based NMs techniques were also employed to enhance the performance of ESDs.


3.1.4. Doped graphene-based LIBs electrodes. 
Doping is the most convenient and efficient way for enhancing the Li adsorption on the G-based NMs among the methods listed above. When dopants are introduced into graphene, characteristics such as thermal, electronic, magnetic, mechanical, chemical reactivity, and transport properties can be altered. As a result, graphene's application originality has expanded.235 Ullah et al.236 investigated Be-doped graphene (Be-G) as an LIBs anode material. Because Be acts as a dopant in graphene, it provides superior Li adsorption than pristine graphene and B-doped graphene. After Be was developed, graphene was shown to be an electron-deficient system using a DFT technique-based research. When one Be is inserted in the center of graphene,237 Li I ons (mono-vacancy case) and ref. 206 Liions (di-vacancy scenario) may be easily accommodated. This shows that a modest amount of doping in graphene can hold a huge number of Li ions. Furthermore, with the assistance of Be doping, a significant increase in Li storage capacity (∼2393.295 mA h g−1) was recorded.
Cai238 conducted another work in which nitrogen and S co-doped graphene (nitrogen/S–G) NSs was compared to pure graphene as the anode. The N/S–G NSs was made by combining G-NSs, benzyl disulphide, and melamine in a simple thermal annealing technique. Fig. 3(d) shows that the charge/discharge capacities of the nitrogen/S–G-NSs-based electrode were about 2157 mA h g−1 and 1016 mA h g−1, respectively, at a constant current of 100 mA g−1 based on electrochemical testing. The reported findings are significantly higher than the predicted graphite capacity of 372 mA h g−1. The quantity of the edge defects introduced by the nitrogen/S–G NSs, as well as the huge SSA and number of mesopores, are thought to be the causes of the high reversible capacities. Fig. 3(e) shows the N/S-G based electrode's cycling behavior and CE at a J of about 100 mA g−1 at 0.01 and 3.0 V. The nitrogen/S-G NSs RC specific capacity was 759.5 mA h g−1 in the 8th cycle, and it continues to improve in the 10th cycle, reaching 788.2 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle, resulting in greater cycling stability. The rate capability of nitrogen/S–G–NSs and pristine graphene was examined at different J values in the range of 0.5–20 A g−1 (Fig. 3(f)). The reversible capacities attained at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15 A g−1 with the 10th cycles at each step were 642.3, 526.3, 352.1, 299.8, and 272.3 mA h g−1, respectively. Further testing was done on the nitrogen/S–G–NSs with a J of 20 A g−1, yielding a capacity of 250.1 mA h g−1. Furthermore, after the 70th cycle, when the J was reset to 0.5 A g−1, the specific capacity was 712.3 mA h g−1, which was greater than the first 10th cycles regardless of the same J. As a result, the author believes that N/S–G NSs were considered to be used as an anode in the LIBs with the addition of nitrogen and S dopants to improve the performance. Similarly, other types of secondary batteries were also introduced because of limitations of Li–metal availability and high cost.
Liang et al.240 show that manufacturing nitrogen-doped G/SnO2 NCs improves the performance of the N-doped LIBs electrodes. The doped NCs have superior charge transfer kinetics and conductivity. Ternary NCs based on the nitrogen-doped G, SnS, and SnO2 have been proven for LIBs applications with good cycle stability.241 The doping technique created a significant number of defects, resulting in electrodes with a large SSA and a greater number of active sites for Li ion accommodation, leading to the improved LIB performance. The LIBs are the most extensively employed secondary batteries, but their moderate energy density has motivated researchers to research different battery types (LSBs, SIBs, etc.). Because doped G-based electrodes were demonstrated to have higher electrochemical properties, it was believed that they would increase the battery performance. Table 1 shows the summary of G-NMs-based LIB anode (non-carbon).

3.2. Graphene-based anode NMs for SIBs

3.2.1. Na storage method of graphene. 
The comparison in functioning between the LIBs and the SIBs has greatly aided SIBs research and improvement. Theoretical studies on an equilibrium voltage and voltage profile, theoretical capacity and energy-density, phase stability, and Na-ion diffusion kinetics have all been conducted to analyze the essential features of SIBs.200 Dahn and Stevens254 suggested the “insertion-adsorption” method after studying the Li and Na storage behavior of hard C (h-C). They studied the resemblance in the Li and Na insertion methods in the C-materials by examining the Li and Na storage method of h-C. They observed the C-configuration as a “house of cards” concept, wherein numerous layers were produced equivalent to each other, while others were orientated at random directions, resulting in nanoscale micropore areas. The introduction of Na+ or Li+ in C-layers is ascribed to the sloping potential profile in the high potential range, whereas the adsorption of Na+ or Li+ into the nanopores randomly stacked layers is attributed to the low-potential plateau, according to the suggested mechanism. However, several researchers discovered that this model could not explain a variety of experimental consequences.255
Cao et al. studied the extraction/insertion method of Na+ and Li+ in hollow C-nanowires (HC-NWs) and found that the electrochemical properties of Na+ in the small voltage area are comparable to Li+ insertion into graphite.256 The charge transfer on the surface of graphitic clusters was ascribed to the reaction in the high potential range (0.2–1 V), whereas the reaction in the low voltage range of 0–0.2 V was credited to Na+ introduction in the graphitic-C interlayer. This is called the adsorption-insertion mechanism. Their theoretical study also showed that Na+ can be simply intercalated into layered C-materials with an interplanar spacing of 0.37 nm or less. Ding et al.257 used ex situ XRD data to show that when carbonized peat moss (CPM) was discharged from 0.1–0.001 V, the mean interlayer spacing increased in the range of 3.96–4.16 Å. Zhang et al.258 studied how the architecture of h-C nanofibers (C-NFs) influences their ability to store Na+. Electrospinning was used to prepare C-NFs, and carbonization at different temperatures was used to customize their microstructure. The Na+ storage method in the C-NFs was anticipated as
(i) Na+ uptake via defects due to heteroatoms
(ii) Na+ adsorption on disordered G-NSs in proportion to the sloping area at 1 and 0.1 V
(iii) Mesopore filling that occurs at ∼0.1 V, according to their systematic study
Li et al.259 used electrospinning to make P-functionalized h-C with a “honeycomb briquette” configuration and examined the relationship between the microstructure and the electrochemical behavior. They discovered that functionalizing h-C with P enhanced the capacity in the slope area at 0.1 and 1 V, but the plateau capacity of the P-functionalized h-C was not dominant because the interlayer spacing has a modest rising affinity subsequent to P functionalization. Wu et al.260 investigated the Na+ storage method of biomass-derived h-C generated from the carbonization of lotus seed-pots, varying the interlayer spacing and porosity by varying the carbonization heat treatment. The h-C formed at high temperatures (1400 °C) has a constricted d-space (3.70 Å) and a smaller pore volume, making it unable to tolerate Na+ through intercalation or adsorption onto the pore surface. The C-material configuration and shape have a significant impact on the salt storage performance. Na-storage is mostly accomplished by insertion and adsorption in most C-compounds.
A diffusion-controlled intercalation technique (DIP) drives Na+ intercalation into graphite layers with interlayer spacing greater than 0.37 nm. DIP does not contribute much to the high rate capacity because of the big atomic size (Z) and slow diffusion capability of Na+. On the contrary to the surface-induced capacitive process (SCP) that includes double layer capacitance and Na+ adsorption into voids, defects, and functional groups, results in rapid Na+ diffusion and improved structural stability over time. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves acquired at various scan speeds may be used to assess the contribution of DIP and SCP. The relationship of maximum current I and scan rate (v) may be explained using I = avb,261 with variables a and b. When b = 0.5, the current was subjugated by the semi-infinite linear diffusion, but when b = 1, the current is dominated by surface capacitance. Zhang and his colleagues262 created a hierarchical-layered G/amorphous-C (a-C)-based NCs anode and quantified both the DIP and SCP contributions. After 2500 cycles, the multilayered (ML) structure showed an RC of 120 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 and 142 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. They claimed that DIP and SCP may operate together to give large capacities, with SCP being able to deal with poor Na+ diffusion at high rates.
In addition, theoretical computing tools have revealed important details about underlying processes that govern Na-electrode materials during electrochemical cycling. A number of DFT investigations verified the instability of Na graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), for example, NaC6 or NaC8, which was explained by the small energy required to create the C and Na chemical bond.263 Wang et al.264 estimated the intercalation energy in Na, Li, K, and graphite, where they found that the Na-GICs were actively unstable because of insufficient charge transfer from Na to C-atoms to induce an exothermic enthalpy of development of the 1st-stage of Na GIC. To explain why Na-graphite has positive formation energy, Liu et al.265 divided the development method of the M-graphite compounds (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) into 3-different categories, namely, binding, straining, and decohesion. They determined that poor binding in Na and graphite leads to low cathodic voltage, in contrast to other metals after studying the pattern of each contribution. They also projected that pre-strained graphite with increased interlayer spacing due to the intercalation of other species would boost the capacity. To examine the method of Na intercalation, Tsai et al.266 studied the ab initio model for the disordered-C. Their findings show that greater interlayer spacing and different point defects (mono/di-vacancies, and Stone-Wales) may successfully beat vdWs interaction in the G-layers, allowing for Na intercalation through NaC8 formation.


3.2.2. Pure graphene-based SIBs electrodes. 
Because of reversible intercalation of Li-atoms in the layers and the synthesis of stable LiC6, graphite was broadly used in the, with a specific capacity of about 372 mA h g−1. However, as a result of the creation of the NaC64267 that is a consequence of the larger size of Na+ and elevated ionization potential,268 graphite has only a very low capacity of 35 mA h g−1 for SIBs. Birte and Philipp269 demonstrated that the graphite constraint may be circumvented utilizing a C6H14O3-based electrolyte to reversibly co-intercalate Na+ and solvent molecules. After 1000 cycles, their electrode had an RC of 100 mA h g−1 and the CE of about 99.87%. Kang's270 team created an ether-based graphite anode electrolyte that had an RC of 150 mA h g−1 and a cycle stability of about 2500 cycles. On the other hand, as a result of the large volume in co-intercalation development, the graphite anode was pulverized, thus restricting its realistic applicability.
Wen et al.271 used a different way for graphite utilization by increasing the interlayer spacing to 0.43 nm. After 2000 cycles, the enlarged graphite had an RC of 284 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1. Due to the high interlayer spacing, Ding et al.257 studied the G-like configuration produced from peat-moss that displayed excellent Na-storage capability (0.388 nm). Cabello et al.272 used the fast heating of graphite bisulfate at 1400 °C to produce extended graphite with an interlayer spacing of about 3.39 Å, which had enough area to co-intercalate the Na ions. When thermally expanded graphite was cycled at about 1C rate, the introduction of the C6H14O3-based electrolyte increased the electrochemical performance, producing a capacity of about 115 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles with a CE of 96%. Wang et al.273 demonstrated that Na could be stored in the rGO with an interlayer spacing of 0.371 nm and an anode capacity of ∼174 mA h g−1 at 0.04 A g−1 and an RC of 95.6 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. The unusual structure of rGO, in which the linked NSs drastically lowers the diffusion length of Na ions, is credited with the electrode's increased performance.
Chang's group used a modified Staudenmaier technique to make rGO (G-NSs) with an interlayer spacing of 0.375 nm, and the anode had an RC of about 220 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1.274 The G-NSs anode has a capacity of 105 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1. The improved storage capacity was because of the high electroadsorption/desorption area (550 m2 g−1) and the wide interlayer spacing of G-NSs. Although expanded graphite and rGO outperformed graphite in terms of the electrochemical performance, they nevertheless had a lower RC than other anode materials. Also, novel structures, such as the 3D porous-G (p-G) with an interconnected framework, DG-NSs, and heteroatom-doped-G (h-G) NSs can be constructed to improve the graphene's Na+ storage capacity, which we will explain in detail in the coming sections.


3.2.3. Porous graphene-based SIBs anodes. 
In addition to the G-NM's intrinsic features, p-G offers a distinct advantage over other porous-C (p-C) materials. For instance, the porous framework's great mechanical strength and superior conductivity may be employed as a wonderful current collector for the quick diffusion of electrons/ions. The porous framework increases the electrochemical efficiency of the secondary batteries when used as an electrode because the diffusion distance for carrier ions is reduced. p-G is a very talented anode material for SIBs as a result of its unique characteristics. p-G may be made with or without a template.275 The template approach276 transforms the G-NMs into p-G nanostructures using diverse inorganic and organic materials as templates. Defects are added to the p-G basal plane by several means in the template-free approach. Chemical etching, also known as chemical activation, is one such process for creating p-C compounds. It is a facile and successful way for the formation of p-G NSs without the need of a template. Template-free chemical activation strategies to build numerous holes in the G-basal plane include KOH activation277 and HNO3 oxidation278 (Fig. 4(a)). Despite organic and inorganic substances, the amphiphilic characteristic of GO may be exploited to construct foam-like configurations of macroscopic graphene by an easy hydrothermal method. These 3D macroscopic structures have pore diameters ranging from sub-micron to several microns. They have strong mechanical strength, compressibility, good conductivity, and adsorption qualities due to their macroscopic nature.279 When hydrothermal production method is done in an acidic media, it revealed that rGO-NSs may form a dense compact porous configuration with wide and tiny pores (Fig. 4(b)).279 Furthermore, graphene hydrogels (G-Hs) generated at an acidic pH have a high mechanical strength because of dense compact configuration with thick porous walls and a strongly connected 3D structure impacted by strong pi-pi interaction. These G-Hs have a high conductivity regardless of a low C/O ratio of 6 due to their unusual linked pore structure with extensive percolating channels linking the isolated sp2 clusters.

First-principles investigations have shown that adding defects to the C-matrix can boost G's Na capacity, with the greater adsorption of DG-NSs being mediated by increased charge transfer between the ad-atoms and defects.281 When utilized as an anode in SIBs, Xiaoting et al.282 created p-G films by inducing defects into the G-NMs using GO and ferric nitrate by a simple filtering approach, and they reported an RC of 195 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. Special pore construction and defects give extra reaction sites for Na-ion storage, which might explain the enhanced performance. Luo et al.283 used a modified Staudenmaier approach to make holey G-NSs with pores and surface functional groups on G-NSs. The functional groups not only supply redox sites but also enhance the interlayer spacing, allowing the Na ions to be accommodated more easily. The holey G-NSs achieved RCs of 220 mA h g−1 and 85 mA h g−1 at rates of 0.03 and 10 A g−1, respectively, when used as an anode material. A simple template-driven approach utilizing polystyrene nanospheres was used to make N-doped 3D p-G, which was then thermally treated at about 700 °C in a nitrogen environment.284 The 3D porous construction can provide quick ion transport channels, while also allowing for substantial volume changes during the charging/discharging cycles. After 500th cycles at 0.2 A g−1, the as-synthesized p-G anode has a high specific capacity of 310 mA h g−1. Because micro/mesopores provide a huge SSA for electrochemical reactions and macropores provide quick diffusion paths for carrier ions, a 3D porous configuration with broad pore dimension allocation is particularly useful as an anode material.285
Liu et al.286 used a template technique that included the self-assembly of G-NSs, elimination of polystyrene spheres (PSs)-used templates, and thermal creation to produce a 3D porous design of G-NWs attached to the 3D G-foam (GF). Over 1000 cycles at 1C, the binder-free anode had an RC of about 301 mA h g−1, and even at 20C, it had an RC of 200 mA h g−1. The multidimensional conductive arrangement produced by G-NWs distribution on GF, expansible graphene interlayer spacing allowing fast ion extraction/insertion, and the light-weight binder-free anode with high energy density could all be attributed to the improved performance. Yan and his colleagues280 created a sandwich-like NCs with p-C on both sides of graphene, and the NCs anode supplied 250 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 4(c)). Zhang et al.287 used Ag-NPs as a template to create 3D p-G grids (p-GGs) that were made up of many stacking graphene structures. After 1000 cycles, the p-GGs showed specific capacities of 160 mA h g−1, 50 mA h g−1, and 112 mA h g−1 at 1 Ah g−1. The porous structure with ultrahigh SSA is responsible for the exceptional electrochemical performance.


3.2.4. Heteroatom doped-graphene-based SIBs electrodes. 
The heteroatom-doped-G (H-G) NSs were also extensively investigated as the anode material for SIBs with notable progress. The physiochemical and electrical characteristics of graphene can be considerably altered by doping it with heteroatoms. When a heteroatom is introduced into the graphene's hexagonal-C (h-C) matrix, structural and electrical changes occur, resulting in changes in charge transport, band gap (B.G.), optical, thermal stability, and magnetic characteristics. The type of dopants, their position, bonding arrangement, and concentration all affect the characteristics. The CVD, ball milling, thermal annealing, and hydrothermal procedure were used for the heteroatom doping of G-NSs. Because B and N have comparable Z to C, incorporation into the G-NSs basal plane was quite simple. Using H3BO3 and CH4N2O as the solid starting materials, Wu et al.288 synthesized B-G NSs with a doping level of 4.3% and nitrogen-doped G NSs with a doping quantity of 4.8% using the CVD approach, one of the novel technique used for the bottom-up synthesis of 2D NMs. Li and his colleagues289 used C2H6O as the C source and B-powder as the starting materials to accomplish B-doping. In the CVD-produced B-G NSs, two bonding topologies of B-atoms can be seen, namely, BC4 and BC3. BC3 is the most typically seen form, whereas BC4 is produced by defects and edge sites. In the C-lattice, B with electrical configuration of 2s2 2p1 produces sp2 hybridization and is deficient of one electron relative to C. The electron-deficient character of B causes a p-doping effect, which results in a Fermi level downshift. Wei et al.292 used the CVD technique to fabricate the nitrogen-doped G NSs, injecting a combination of CH4 and NH3 gases into the flow when heat treated at about 800 °C. The N-atoms were found to be in three distinct bonding configurations, according to XPS analysis, namely, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N. The nitrogen-doped G-NSs differ from the B-doped G-NSs because of the electron configuration of nitrogen (1s22s22p3). N-doping creates a B.G. at the Dirac point, giving G-NMs semiconducting characteristics. The N-doping effect is imposed by graphitic-N, which forms three bonds with surrounding C-atoms, whereas the P-doping effect is imposed by pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N generated at defect sites. In addition, heteroatoms such as Cl, P, S, I, F, Se, O, and Br have been described in the literature.200 Incorporating TMs, such as Co, Fe, Ni, and Cr into the G-matrix can also result in the hybrid materials with improved electrochemical characteristics.200 By the pyrolysis of dry hydrogels consisting of GO, PANi, and C6H18O24P6, Li et al.293 synthesized nitrogen-P co-doped G-NSs utilizing pyrimidine and thiophene as precursors. Xu and colleagues294 investigated the production of the S,N co-doped FLs GO nanofilms using the CVD technique. By chemically activating polypyrrole-functionalized G-NSs with KOH, Zhang et al.290 created a nitrogen-p-C anode (Fig. 5(a)).

It has an elevated RC of 349.7 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 because of its distinctive composition and structural properties. By heat-treating free-dried GO in NH3, Xu's group295 created 3D N-doped GF with 6.8% N-doping. It has an RC of 852.6 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 when employed as an anode in SIBS. They compared its Na storage performance to that of the GO-foam (GOF), rGO, and nitrogen-doped G NSs, and discovered that the electrochemical performance of the nitrogen-doped 3D mesoporous structure could be greatly improved. Synergistic properties connected with the 3D porous configuration, with greater interlayer spacing paired with nitrogen-doping produced defects to enhance the Na-ion transport, are credited with this anode's better performance. Due to its electrical characteristics and approximately similar covalent radius to C, B-doping was also considered as an efficient dopant for carbonaceous materials. Wang's group291 used a one-pot hydrothermal effect by combining GO and H3BO3 to generate B-functionalized rGO (BF-rGO) with increased interlayer gap (0.37 nm) and defect rich configuration (Fig. 5(b)). The BF-rGO-based anode that resulted had an RC of 280 mA h g−1 at 0.02 A g−1 that was much greater than that of rGO. Table 2 gives a review of h-G NSs utilized as an SIBs anode material.

Furthermore, the DFT calculations showed that the doped G-NMs with pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N, B, and F boosted electrochemical Na storage as a result of the electronic effect caused by electron deficient locations on the G-NMs basal plane (specifically, defects or electron-deficient atoms).306 As a result of the geometric impact generated by the bond length mismatch, P-doping might boost the G-NSs storage capacity of Na. Also, G-doping with two distinct elements (pyrrolic-N and P) increased the electrochemical performance much more due to the abundance of adsorption sites resulting from both electrical and geometric effects. Even though the pure G-NM's capacity to store the Na+ is restricted, increasing the interlayer spacing, creating 3D porous configurations, initiating defects, and heteroatom doping can considerably improve the electrochemical performance. On the other hand, as a result of the development of the SEI layer and the irreversible interaction in Na+ and the remaining functional groups of the G-NMs, the G-based anodes have a poor initial CE.307 Furthermore, the G-NM's low packing density leads to a low volumetric energy density.308 As a result, graphene is frequently mixed with other electrode materials to fulfill its full potential, resulting in significantly higher Na+ storage capacities than pure G-anodes. Even though G-NMs has a low capacity role in SIBs,309 it is an important supporting and conducting agent because of its higher conductivity and structural stability, and the synergistic effect of G-NMs and active NMs improves the anode's electrochemical performance.310


3.2.5. Graphene NCs-based SIBs anodes. 
Alternative anode materials for SIBs were/are the focus of intense investigation in the advanced NMs field. To avoid the formation of dendrites, an anode material is supposed to contain an elevated specific capacity, higher rate performance, strong cycle stability, and reaction potential. Anode materials were characterized as intercalation (insertion)-, conversion-, or alloying-based on the reaction process during the charge/discharge of SIBs (Fig. 6). Under the aforementioned categorization, the recent advancement of G-based NCs anodes is evaluated in this part. There are different techniques such as intercalation materials, conversion materials, graphene/TM sulfides (TMSs), graphene/TM oxides, graphene/TM phosphides, and other conversion anodes that are used to boost the performance of SIBs. Now, we will give a short summary of these techniques applied in the past. Titanium (Ti)-based materials exhibit an intercalation process in G-NSs when used as the SIB anodes at a low voltage. The less conductivity and considerable volume change in the charging/discharging method have hampered the performance of Ti-based anodes, for e.g., TiO2, NaTi2(PO4)3, and Na2Ti3O7. Using a conductive substance such as G-based NMs to increase the electrochemical performance of the Ti-based anodes has been shown to be a highly effective method.319 Hyun Ae Cha et al.320 created a TiO2 anode anchored on the nitrogen-doped G NSs that showed an elevated RC of about 405 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1. The open pore channels of the nitrogen-doped G NSs that enhanced ion transport and electron transfer were credited with the increased performance. Superior rate capability (265, 187, and 90 mA h g−1 at about 50, 200, and 12000 mA g−1, respectively) and exceptional durable cyclability (120 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 for 4300–cycles) were found in the G-coupled TiO2 sandwich-like hybrid anodes.312

First-principles simulations also showed that partly attaching G-NMs to TiO2 might lower the diffusion energy barrier, boosting Na+-intercalation development. CQDs were also used for the first time as “designer additives” in the creation of the G-rich petal-like rutile TiO2 anodes with the functionalization resulting in a petal-like arrangement made up of nanoneedles.321 Nanoneedles made of TiO2 were useful for shortening the Na-ion diffusion paths, and ultrathin graphitic C improves the ensemble's conductivity. Using electrostatic interaction-induced self-assembly, Xu et al.311 created a 3D TiO2-G hybrid anode. Strong vdWs forces between G-NSs and TiO2 not only aided Na+ intercalation but also improve Na storage across the interface. The hybrid anode maintained 90 mA h g−1 long-term cycle stability over 5000 cycles at 10 C and high capabilities of 20 C.
The TMs mix with chalcogens, chemical elements from Group-VIA (S, O, Te, and Se), to generate TM chalcogenides (TMCs) that have an adjustable B.G, ultrathin thickness, and unusual electrical and mechanical characteristics. TMCs store Na+ by the conversion reactions as follows: MxRy + 2yNa+ + 2ye−x → M + yNa2R, where M = W, Fe, Mn, Mo, Co, Ni, Cu, etc., and R = S, Te, O, and Se. Though the TMCs-based anodes have high reversible capacities, low electrical conductivity limits their rate capabilities. Furthermore, poor cycle stability is caused by substantial volume changes throughout the discharge/charge operation. Developing hybrid anodes with G-based NMS to address the aforementioned difficulties with the TMCs-based anodes is an attractive option in this area. Because of its distinctive G-like configuration and huge interlayer gap of 6.15, MoS2 has obtained a lot of attention as TMSs. The Na+ storage process in MoS2 has two stages—in the high voltage range, Na+ intercalates into the interlayers, and then in the low voltage region, a conversion reaction occurs.
In layered MoS2, increasing interlayer separation can improve Na+ intercalation and diffusion. On the other hand, the low conductivity between the MoS2 layers makes it unsuitable for use as SIBs anode materials. By preventing the stacking of MoS2 and establishing the conductive network, G-based NMs plays a significant role in the hybrid architectures.275 David et al.315 used an acid-functionalized MoS2 and rGO-NFs to create a self-standing flexible anode. At a constant J of 25 mA g−1, the NCs anode delivers a capacity of 338 mA h g−1 on the 1st cycle and 218 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles. Static uniaxial stress testing also demonstrated an elevated mechanical strength of 2–3 MPa and a high failure strain of 2%. After 600 cycles at 1.5 A g−1, a new anode material composed of 3D-G-based NMs with microspheres coated with FLs of MoS2 by the one-pot spray pyrolysis technique demonstrated a discharge capacity of 322 mA h g−1 with an elevated CE of about 99.9% (Fig. 7(a and b)).322 The 3D structure of p-G provides gaps for volume increase and rapid electron transportation channels in cycling, while the decreased stacking of the MoS2 layers eases the strain and lowers the barrier for Na-insertion.

Che et al.323 constructed a hierarchical MoS2–rGO anode with vertically-attached MoS2 NSs on both sides of rGO. At 100 mA g−1, a hybrid anode with a 92% MoS2 loading yielded an elevated RC of 420 mA h g−1. A simple technique consisting of in situ development of MoS2 on the rGO, and an a-C covering step (Fig. 7(c–e))324 was used to create a sandwich-like configuration with the MoS2-NSs vertically interacting with rGO by direct coupling. More active sites and small diffusion paths for Na+ were supplied by the vertical structure, allowing for rapid reaction kinetics. After 110 cycles, the hybrid anode verified improved RC of 520 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Various nanostructured MoS2–rGO NCs anodes with higher performance were constructed to give additional Na diffusion channels.325 Because of their chemical, physical, and mechanical stability, cobalt sulphides, such as CoS, CoS2, and Co3S4, have been employed as SIB anode materials. However, their practical applicability is hampered by weak conductivity and pulverization caused by repeated volume increase. One way to avoid aggregation and improve the electrochemical performance is to combine them with G-NMs. Zhao et al.326 used a self-assembly technique to produce CoS nanoflowers wrapped in rGO, and the h-CoS@rGO anode sustained a high RC of 620 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. By preventing NPs pulverization and retaining the electrode integrity, the rGO-NSs significantly improved the kinetic characteristics of CoS. 10 nm thick CoS nanoplates were evenly produced on rGO frames with good adhesion using an efficient in situ solvothermal process to offer a structurally robust host for Na-ion transport.327 The hybrid anode displayed exceptional cycle stability of 420 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles due to the 2D conductive network and thin CoS nanoplates. A simple solvothermal reaction and subsequent C-coating technique were used to make CoS@rGO@C-NCs.328 The as-synthesized hybrid anode displayed enhanced RC of 706 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 due to the synergistic impact of the conductive rGO system and additional outer C-coating.
Because of its high theoretical capacity, availability, and lack of toxicity TM oxides (TMOs), e.g., Fe2O3 has been shown to be one of the main talented anode materials for SIBs. Valvo et al.329 described Fe2O3 NMs as a probable feasible anode for SIBs for the first time, with the conversion process Fe2O3 + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Fe + 3Na2O. The synergistic impact of incorporating G-NMs into the Fe2O3 NM considerably enhanced the electrochemical performance of the electrode, resulting in good Na-storage qualities.330 The Fe2O3 nanorods/rGO NS-based NCs anode produced utilizing a scalable hydrothermal method revealed an Na storage capacity of about 332 mA h g−1 at 0.2C over 300 cycles with long term cycling stability, as reported by Kong et al.331 The direct development of 1D Fe2O3 nanorod arrays on rGO NSs prevents G-NSs from stacking again, thus increasing the electrode's RC. The roughly porous shape minimizes resistance and increases ion and electron transfer diffusion, resulting in increased rate capability. A-Fe2O3@G-NSs-NCs were effectively synthesized by Li's group332 using a simple technique, in which Fe2O3 with 5 nm diameter were evenly fixed to the graphene surface by strong C–O–Fe oxygen linking (Fig. 8(a)). After 500 cycles at 2000 mA g−1, the Fe2O3@GNS NC anode displayed a specific capacity of 110 mA h g−1 (Fig. 8(b)). Spinel Co3O4 has a theoretical capacity of 890 mA h g−1 for storing Na+ through the conversion reaction.333 The high theoretical capacity, however, causes harmful effects by huge particle volume change during charging/discharging that causes the material characteristics to fade quickly. After 50 cycles, Sun's group334 coupled graphene with mesoporous Co3O4 particles, resulting in a hybrid anode with an excellent capacity (523.5 mA h g−1) and cycle stability at 25 mA g−1. For the first time, Kim et al.335 experimentally proved that the creation of the intermediate phase (CoO1−x) during conversion and reconversion operations causes substantial voltage hysteresis (Fig. 8(c)). Their hybrid anode of Co3O4 and graphene nanoplatelet had high capacity (756 mA h g−1) and good reversibility (Fig. 8(d and e)). It produced 96 W h kg−1 energy when paired with the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode in a complete cell. The TM phosphides (TMPs) such as CoP, Ni2P, and FeP have been formed by combining TMs, including Co, Ni, and Fe with P. Because of their complicated production procedures, phosphides have received little attention. A majority of the reported phosphides are manufactured at high temperatures using organic solvents, and controlling the shape of the nanostructures at high temperatures is difficult. The M–P (where M = Fe, Ni, Co) electrodes experience conversion response and generate Na3P after complete sodiation of the metal phosphide. Though metal phosphides have high theoretical capacities, phase breakup causes large volume variations and rapid capacity fading. Thus, producing G-NCs can increase the electrochemical performance of these materials. Li and colleagues336 used a low-temperature phosphorization technique to create novel core-shell CoP@FeP microcubes linked through rGO NSs (Fig. 8(f)). The linked rGO-NSs create a conductive expressway that improves charge transfer kinetics while also serving as shielding layers to reduce volume increase in phase transition. After 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1, the NC anode had a final capacity of 456.2 mA h g−1 (Fig. 8(g)).

X.Miao et al.337 created core-shell structured Ni2P@C-NPs implanted in 3D G-aerogel (GA), with the hybrid anode preserving a capacity of 124.5 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The numerous holes and wide SSA of the GAs allow for efficient Na+ transport while limiting contact with the electrode and the electrolyte. It also creates a conductive matrix along the electrode and inhibits Ni2P NPs from aggregating and pulverizing. The TM selenides and tellurides store Na+ through conversion processes in addition to TMSs, TMOs, and TMPs. By establishing stable C–Se connections, Wu et al.338 created a Tremella-like CoSe–rGO hybrid with increased conductivity and mechanical stability. The C–Se bonds have a high mechanical stretch, which prevent Se dissolution and reduce volume expansion in the charging/discharging method. After 100 cycles, the CoSe–rGO anode showed a high RC of 400.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1.


3.2.6. Alloying materials as anode for SIBs. 
Alloys are anodes materials with elevated specific capacities and safety qualities because they can store a considerable quantity of Na+ at a low sodiation potential (eqn (1)). M + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxM(1)However, because of the elevated Na+ storage capability, alloy anodes experience significant volume expansion and contraction for the period of sodiation/desodiation, which results in a considerable boost of the tension within the battery design's geometrical restrictions. As a result, using G-based NMs has shown to be a successful technique for addressing this essential issue. The alloy anode's structural stability was enhanced by G-NSs with high mechanical strength, while its better electrical conductivity promotes electron transport in the electrode. Because it can alloy up to 3.75 Na, Sn is one of the most useful SIB anode materials with a potential charge capacity of 847 mA h g−1. However, a 420% volume increase from Sn to Na15Sn4 causes the pulverization of active components and the loss of electrical contact with the current collector, resulting in a significant reduction in the capacity.339 Anchoring the Sn-NPs in the G-NMs, where the C-matrix efficiently buffers volume changes and inhibits particle aggregation, should increase the cycle stability. Jeon et al.340 used a camera flash reduction approach to create a porous scaffold of the rGO and G-based NMs to host Sn. The Sn volume change and mechanical stability were accommodated by the porous structure with vast open gaps. As a result, the NCs-based anode displayed a high RC of about 615 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, with sustained capacity retention of over 84%. The Na+ ions were stored in Sn and Sb-based oxides by a combination of conversion and alloying processes. Patra et al.341 also used supercritical CO2 fluid to make SnO2-NPs with a diameter of 1 nm on G-NSs and CNTs. The electrochemical characteristics of the anode improved because SnO2-NPs were evenly disseminated and strongly linked to the C-framework. Na+ transfer and buffering SnO2 volume fluctuation were greatly increased by high electrical conductivity and SSA. Chen et al.342 employed a facile method to generate SnO2-NPs evenly on G-NSs via Sn–O–C bonding to further minimize agglomeration and buffer the high volume change.
A porphyrin derivative was recently employed as an interfacial linker for the layer-by-layer (LBL) production of SnO2 NMs anchored on the nitrogen-doped G and S–G NSs. The hybrid anode displayed a high initial capacity of about 791.7 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a high RC of 180.2 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g−1 as a result of the bonding effect and increased conductivity. Su et al.343 employed an in situ hydrothermal synthesis technique to create a SnO2@G-NCs, with the FE-SEM/TEM result confirming the homogeneous distribution of the octahedral SnO2 NPs (∼60 nm) on G-NSs. According to them, the reaction, which took place was 4SnO2 + 31Na+ + 31e− → Na15Sn4 + 8Na2O. At 20 mA g−1, the NCs show a high RC of 700 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles. The SnS2 nanoplatelet@G-NSs-based NCs with a novel 2D platelet-on-NSs nanoarchitecture were synthesized by Xie et al.,344 and when used as the anode, they acquired a discharge capacity of about 1339 mA h g−1 in the 1st cycle and an initial RC of about 725 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1. The enhanced performance might be attributed to the SnS2/G-hybrid nanostructure's synergistic effects, in which the G-based NMs boosts the conductivity and accommodates SnS2 volume variation during the charging/discharging mechanism. An ML SnS2–rGO NCs was made from a combination of SnCl4, thioacetamide (TAA), and GO using a simple hydrothermal method.345 Even after 400 charge/discharge cycles, the SnS2/rGO anode maintained a specific capacity of about 500 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. The capacity retention of SnS-NP electrostatically attached to the 3D nitrogen-doped G NSs was 87.1% for 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 with a capacity of 509.9 mA h g−1. The significant affinity of 3D nitrogen-doped G NSs for SnS and its discharge products maintains structural integrity throughout cycling, preventing electrode pulverization and active material aggregation. After the annealing stage in an argon environment, Zhou et al.346 discovered that the hexagonal-SnS2 phase could be converted into the orthorhombic-SnS phase (Fig. 9(a)). After 250 cycles at 810 and 7290 mA g−1, the as-synthesized h-SnS@G nanostructure produced a good specific capacity of 940 mA h g−1 and rate capability of 492 and 308 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 9(b)). As a consequence of its large theoretical capacity of 660 mA h g−1 to generate Na3Sb and a safe working voltage of about 0.4 V vs., Na+/Na,348 Sb stands out as a promising choice for SIBs. Hu et al.347 reported a chemically-connected Sb-ML graphene hybrid (Fig. 9(c)), where the Sb–O–C bond produced close contact in Sb and G-NMs. The conductive and flexible graphene, and the homogeneous allocation of the Sb not only increase Na+ transport but also stabilize the SEI layer during cycling (Fig. 9(d and e)).

Qin's group349 prepared an SnSb alloy nanoconfined 3D N-doped p-G NCs using a simple top-down technique, in which nitrogen-doped G NS boxes were securely implanted with ultrasmall SnSb nanocrystals. The electrode's structural integrity and electron conductivity were greatly enhanced by the strong connections between graphene and G-NSs, and the in-plane confinement of SnSb by the G-NSs. At 0.1 A g−1, the hybrid anode maintained a specific capacity of almost 400 mA g h−1 after 100 cycles. Because it accommodates Na+ by conversion and alloying, Sb2O4 has an elevated hypothetical capacity of about 1227 mA h g−1. The mutual reaction process is given in eqn (2) and (3). Sb2O4 + 8Na+ + 8e− → 2Sb + 4Na2O(2) 2Sb + 6Na + 6e− → 2Na3Sb(3)On the other hand, because of the considerable voltage hysteresis, poor reversibility, and high redox potential of Sb2O4, its practical applicability is limited. To address these challenges, Ramakrishnan et al.316 developed an Sb2O4@rGO-based NCs used as an anode, in which nanowrinkled rGO NSs served as a template for Sb2O4-NPs cycling and efficiently relieving volume expansion strain. The synthesized NC-based anode has an RC of 626 mA h g−1 at 0.6 A g−1. Zhou et al.350 described a simple amorphous-to-crystalline method for making a densely-packed Sb2O3-NSs/GA. The hybrid anode showed a high capacity of about 657.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 even after 100 cycles caused by the synergistic effects of densely-packed Sb2O3-NSs and GA with robust support to both the structure and stability. Because of its low molecular weight and high electron transport number (3e−), P has a theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1.
As SIB anode materials, allotropes of phosphorus (P), a-RP, and orthorhombic BP were extensively studied. RP's poor electrical conductivity (110–14 S cm−1) and large volume expansion (490%) make it difficult to use as an anode. The P-NPs enclosed in the G-based NM scrolls (P–G) and loaded on planar G-NSs were created by Pei et al.351 Because the scroll configuration with full-encapsulated P could successfully constrain the volume change, the P–G based NCs anode demonstrated a high capacity of 2355 mA h g−1 with capacity retention of 92.3% across cycles. B.P is a graphite-like material with an excellent electrical conductivity of about 3 S cm−1. However, because of the huge anisotropic volume change, it has poor cycle performance. Liu et al.352 chemically connected 4-nitrobenzene-diazonium-modified B.P with rGO to make a hybrid structure, which demonstrated a high RC of about 1472 mA h g−1 in the 50th cycle at J of 0.1 A g−1. The interaction between B.P and G-based NMs enhances the electrode's stability, while the expanded channel between P and graphene stores more Na+, resulting in improved cycle performance. Shuai et al.353 studied a sandwich like the structured B.P./G NCs with P–C and P–O–C bonds introduced simultaneously by chemical activation. The flexible space formed by graphene, which alleviates the volume expansion of P, resulted in a high specific capacity of 2311 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 83.9% after 100 cycles that can be credited to the flexible space formed by the G-NMs, which can be attributed to the high specific capacity of 2311 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 83.9% after 100 cycles. Sn and P may be combined to generate Sn4P3, a promising anode that combines the benefits of Sn (high conductivity) and P (low conductivity) (high capacity). An in situ low-temperature solution-based phosphorization reaction method was used to make Sn4P3/rGO hybrids. Over 100 cycles, the hybrid anode with the 3D microporous design produced an RC of 656 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. In other study, researchers produced an Sn4P3-P@G (Sn:P = 1:3) NC with a high-rate capacity retention of >550 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 1000 cycles using a simple mechanochemical technique. The strong connections between P and the G-NMs (P–O–C link) provide effective electrical conduction, while the G-based matrix inhibits segregation and provides accommodation to considerable volume expansion that occurs when Na+ is absorbed. Despite the above-mentioned components, a variety of NMs have been combined with G-NMs and tested as the SIB anodes. Table 3 summarizes the electrochemical performance and synthesis of the reported G-NC-based anodes.275

In the case of SIBs, a hydrothermal-assisted freeze-drying approach was used to make co-doped nitrogen-P GA.376 When used as an anode material, this aerogel demonstrated improved rate capability and quick Na-ion storage. The scientists attributed the improved SIB performance to the carbonaceous material's higher SSA, increased conductivity, and larger capacitive contribution. The anodes of the SIBs were made from nitrogen-doped G-based materials. Zhang et al.377 used laser scribing and CH4N2O and polyimide NSs to create binder-free nitrogen-doped G-based anodes. The higher SIB performance of this doped electrode was attributed to its elevated SSA, 3D porous configuration, and improved conductivity at comparably high doping levels (12.8 at%). The use of SG as an anode material for SIBs was described by Quan et al.378 As a precursor, the researchers employed solvothermal-derived graphene, which had a very disordered configuration than pristine G-NMs. As the S-source, DMSO, a common organic solvent, was utilized. The doped anode material displayed steady capacity retention up to 1000 cycles as a result of its greater degree of disorder. Furthermore, the doped anode outperformed the undoped anode electrochemically because of the existence of a significant number of active sites for Na-storage. The anode material for SIBs was also suggested as a 3D free-standing NG aerogel.379 By anchoring metal sulphides on the surface of nitrogen-doped G, the problem of low conductivity of metal sulphides as electrode materials was overcome. Fe7S8 NPs anchored on the nitrogen-doped G surface was proven as an anode material for SIBs.380 The authors also studied how dopant loading affects NCs anode battery performance. Low mass loading resulted in lesser capacity, whereas excessive mass loading resulted in the uneven distribution of metal sulphide particles. Electrolyte breakdown and unstable SEI development, which impeded ion/electron transport, were blamed for capacity loss after the first few cycles. Despite these issues, the NC electrodes demonstrated superior rate capability and cycle stability by improving the charge-transfer kinetics.

3.3. Graphene-based anode NMs for lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs)
In the 1940s, researchers began researching Li–S batteries (LSBs). Since then, several efforts have been made to commercialize them. The entire redox reaction with Li (S8 + 16Li = 8Li2S, which occurs at 2.2 V with regard to Li+/Li) might theoretically give an elevated capacity of about 1672 mA h g−1 and a specific energy of 2600 W h kg−1.109 The LSBs with theoretical energy density rely not only on the performance of the S-cathode but also on the use of an Li–metal anode with a high theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g−1).381 The Li–metal, on the other hand, has a high rate of dendrite development that limits its use in commercial batteries owing to safety concerns. The other benefits of LSBs are their natural abundance, low cost, and minimal S toxicity. However, there are still considerable obstacles to the commercialization of this technology. The poor electrical conductivity of S (510–30 S cm−1) is a key issue, resulting in low active material usage efficiency and rate capability.382 An additional difficulty was the extremely soluble polysulfide anions created as reaction intermediates in the charging/discharging route.383 They can travel through the separator to the Li anode during cycling and be reduced to solid precipitates (Li2S2 and/or Li2S), resulting in active mass loss. Furthermore, the large volumetric change (80%) of S throughout the charging/discharging operation would gradually reduce the electrode's mechanical integrity and stability over time.
To date, the best answer to the foregoing problems has been to enclose S in a C matrix, which is expected to improve the conductivity of the S-based cathode, trap-soluble Li2S intermediates, and provide accommodation to electrode volume fluctuation during cycling. As a result, nanostructures made of various C-based NMs, for instance, controlled mesoporous-C, hollow-C spheres, and MW-CNTs, have received considerable attention. Because of its distinctive 2D configuration, elevated conductivity, and great flexibility, G-based NMs are one of the most useful carbonaceous materials for use in LSBs. Furthermore, during the cycling process, the surface functional groups of G-NSs may be adjusted flexibly to immobilize S/Li2Sx on the G-NS surface. The microstructure of G-NM-based electrode materials must be designed rationally in order to exploit their full potential for LSBs. Furthermore, during Li-plating and stripping, dendrites and the production of an unstable SEI create isolated Li with no activity, sometimes known as “dead” Li, which has a poor CE and is a barrier in the utilization of Li-based anodes.384 PG-NSs, for example, show considerable promise in stabilizing the Li–electrolyte interface, reducing dendrite development, and homogenizing the ion flow. Here, we will define in detail the factor, e.g., SEI stabilization and electric field homogenization, space confinement and dendrite growth prevention, and anode hosts with flexibility, which are very important for boosting the efficiency of LSBs.
An SEI is widely acknowledged to occur on the surface of the Li-based anode as a result of an interaction between the electrolyte and Li at a low voltage. Dendrites develop and partially dissolve during the Li plating/stripping cycles, but the SEI stays unaltered because to its great mechanical strength. On account of the stripping/plating process, some of the Li metal loses contact, leading to the creation of inactive Li and a poor CE of the anode.384 To tackle this problem, the volume change of Li must be limited in order to avoid SEI formation iteratively. To restrict dendrite formation and maintain the SEI, Mukherjee et al.385 used P–G NSs as a basic cage. Wang et al.386 prepared wrinkled G-cages that served as an Li host, with Li loaded in the cage's corners. The SEI formed solely inside the G-cages after Li deposition, and the SEI structure remained stable after Li removal. The HR-TEM results revealed that the graphene layer and interface remained stable after lithiation, preventing recurring SEI formation.
Another way the P–G-based NSs helped to stabilize Li–metal structures was by homogenizing the electric field, which allows for uniform Li-ion deposition. To direct Li deposition, Zhang et al.387 built a 3D Cu current collector with an nitrogen-doped G NSs layer. The SEI was produced on the surface of G-NSs during the Li plating procedure. The SEM results showed that Li deposition does not disrupt the SEI structure, resulting in a smooth Li coating that is attributable to uniform Li+ flow induced by strong interaction in nitrogen-doped G NSs and Li. Dendrite development happened on the Li metal on the pure 3D Cu current collector without the G-NS layer's protection. A layered rGO-NS structure, wherein the electric field was detoured to the margins of the patterned anode, was used to allow horizontal centripetal Li plating.388 p-rGO not only inhibited dendrite formation but also homogenized the field, allowing homogeneous Li plating and structural stabilization. To tackle the problem of non-uniform Li-plating, Deng et al.389 prepared a 3D G/Li-based NCs. Li metal was linked to the interior of the pores in the PG-NSs in their sample. The electrons travel fast across the network due to G's high conductivity, and the electric field is homogenized. Furthermore, the P-G NSs in this sample inhibited dimension shift of the Li metal, thus preventing surface dendrite formation. A 3D G/Li NCs-based symmetrical cell demonstrated higher improvement provided by the P–G NSs.
The dendrite issue in Li-based anodes has greatly hampered the use of the Li-based secondary batteries. This is most probably due to the inhomogeneous J and Li-ion concentration during the charging/discharging. Uncontrolled dendrite production and growth on the Li anode, with constant striping and plating, roughens the surface during cycling, resulting in poor battery performance. It gets worse if dendrites continue to develop; they may enter the separator, causing an unanticipated short circuit and posing a safety threat. To address this safety issue, a variety of techniques have been employed. Ex situ approaches for anode improvement have been applied additionally to the in situ produced SEI films that have already been introduced to stabilize the Li anode. Kim et al.390 for example, employed ML G-NSs in Li anode and used electrolyte additives to greatly reduce Li-dendrite formation. The layered G-NM structure functioned as a barrier to Li-dendrite penetration due to its Young's modulus of 0.5 TPa that was greater than that of the Li metal (3.4 GPa).391 After 50 cycles, a symmetric cell with a Cs+ electrolyte additive had a CE of about 90.6%. Furthermore, when compared to the bare-Li battery, Kim et al.390 utilized this in a practical LSB that demonstrated a minimal overpotential and relatively steady performance. In addition to their outstanding mechanical performance, the P-G NSs have a high SSA, which minimizes local J and thereby the dendrite development. The 3D hexagonal shape of unstacked G-based NMs is for the Li anode described by Zhang et al.392 The J of the anode was one thousandth that of a standard Cu foil because of the G-NS framework's high SSA and pore volume of about 1666 m2 g−1 and 1.65 cm3 g−1, respectively. As a result, relatively tiny Li clusters (about 50–100 nm) were deposited to prepare a dendrite-free surface.
Batteries with this G-based anode attained a, CE of 93% at 2.0 mA cm−2 and long cycling stability of 800 cycles when employed with LiTFSI–LiFSI, dual-salt electrolyte, which improved the SEI layer, and LiTFSI–Li. P–G NSs limits dendrite formation by directing Li nucleation and deposition, while exerting pressure on the Li surface and lowering the local Kang et al.393 made an FL nitrogen-doped G NMs was prepared by combining it with a polymer binder and coating it on a Cu foil to create a pattern of FLs nitrogen-doped G NM-based islands that separate the insulating polymer binder. The Li nucleated on the FLs nitrogen-doped G NS site and the polymer layer hindered further development. As a result, the consistent FL nitrogen-doped G NM distribution governed Li deposition, and no dendrites developed. After 120 cycles, the FL nitrogen-doped G anode maintained about 100% CE, but the Cu-foil battery failed after just 25 cycles. Because the PG-NSs have a high conductivity, Zhang et al.392 employed N-PG-NSs as an Li anode substrate and current collector to replace the usual Cu foil and lower the electrode's mass. N-containing groups are lithiophilic so guide and regulate Li nucleation and deposition, inhibiting dendrite formation, in addition to have a high energy density. The SEM pictures reveal a considerable reduction in Li dendrite formation. After roughly 200 cycles, this dendrite-free battery maintained exceptional electrochemical performance, with a CE of 98%.
As flexible electronic gadgets grow more common, flexibility is becoming increasing vital. The flexibility of the electrodes must be considered while producing viable flexible LSBs. Because the cathode's flexibility has already been explored, here we will concentrate on the anode. Even though Li–metal has some flexibility, it is too soft to recover from bending and twisting, which might cause surface fractures, leading to Li loss and a worsening dendrite issue. Li-based NCs used as anode materials have been investigated in order to increase the anode's mechanical performance. A flexible Li anode might be made from G-based NMs with outstanding mechanical capabilities for constructing a freestanding scaffold and a porous structure for Li deposition and storage. D.Lin et al.394 presented an Li–rGO anode wherein thermal infusion created stacked alternating layers of Li and rGO. This anode possessed exceptional flexibility, which was attributable to the superior mechanical characteristics of rGO in addition to the layered configuration, which diffused the inner stress. With Li stripping and plating, the anode demonstrates great stability, with just 20% thickness shift. Furthermore, the rGO exhibited excellent lithiophilicity, resulting in consistent Li deposition throughout cycling. Consequently, when cycling at about 3 mA cm−2, the anode displayed only a tiny and constant hysteresis, suggesting exceptional stability. Wang et al.395 used rGO to create a flexible anode in a similar way. The rGO NS superior mechanical characteristics, in addition to their lithiophilicity and stress dispersion, assist constrain fracture propagation. The anode's surface area was also greatly enlarged by the layer structure, which reduced local J and slowed dendrite formation. This layered arrangement not only helps to balance Li deposition and development, but it also improved the anode stability under bending.
In LSBs with an CNT/S cathode, this NC anode has been employed. When the pouch cell bent at 180°, the battery had a capacity of roughly 600 mA h g−1, but the Li anode battery failed after 35 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Because of its high reactivity and instability, making a flexible Li anode is more challenging than making a flexible S cathode. Zhao et al.396 employed a layered configuration to generate flexible anodes that were stable in air as a result of this. Impermeable G-NSs encased LixM (M = Si, Sn, or Al) NP-based alloys in their unique nanostructure, which shielded them from air exposure. The material was employed to substitute bare Li–metal in the LSBs with a discharge capacity of 858 mA h g−1 and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 110 cycles at a J of 0.5C. In addition to its excellent cycling ability, the XPS results revealed that the structure reduced the shuttle effect by drastically lowering the intensities of the Li2S/Li2S2 peaks. Three elements of PG-NSs are utilized in the Li anodes, based on the preceding discussion. First, P–G NSs acts as a physical barrier that effectively limits dendrite development for the chemical reaction control because of its strong mechanical performance. The P–G NSs are a current collector as a result of their elevated SSA and conductivity, which minimizes local J and smoothens Li development. The P-G NSs doped with lithiophilic groups were employed to direct Li nucleation and deposition, further suppressing dendrite formation. A dendrite-free morphology with uniform Li-plating were maintained in the P–G NSs/Li NC-based formed anode, which performs well in LSBs. Second, the pores in PG-NSs enclose the Li metal, limiting its volume change and stabilizing the SEI. It also provides great protection for the Li metal as a flexible 3D free-standing host. More investigation into the structure of the p-G/Li-based NCs might result in increased stability and CE. Third, the Li/PG-NS-based NCs employed as anodes have high flexibility and electrochemical stability, and the G-NSs may also produce air-stable anodes due to their hydrophobicity and gas impermeability. Despite these advantages, the high reactivity of the Li metal poses various obstacles in its application. Improving the stability of Li anodes and fully exploiting the high capacity of Li metal remain fundamental issues that must be addressed before LSBs can be commercialized.
Taking advantage of the strong affinity between S and C, one method for depositing S onto G-based NMs is to directly impregnate aggregated G-NSs with molten S. This approach was shown to be efficient in the boosting conductivity but not in restricting polysulfide intermediates since they may still diffuse out of the irregular holes generated by the aggregated G-based NMs, thus jeopardizing cell stability. Microsized S-NPs enveloped by rGO were produced via a scalable solution-based oxidation approach397 that yielded a high loading quantity of S (87%) contained in the rGO matrix, in contrast to this direct melting technique. The highly conductive network was shown to successfully trap the polysulfides due to strong hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions. However, due to partial oxidation during the charge process, insulating domains of Li2S may develop on the microsized particles, resulting in poor cycling stability and severe capacity fading after 50 cycles.
Another key method explored to improve the interaction between G-NMs and S/polysulfide species and obtain optimal performance for LSBs is the chemical alteration of the surface structure. NanoS was coated onto GO-NSs via chemical reaction in a microemulsion method, according to Zhang et al.398 The modified GO-NS surface's epoxy and hydroxyl groups were shown to be effective in immobilizing the S to C–C bonds and avoiding the polysulfides species from dissolving. As a consequence, the cell maintained an RC of 954 mA h g−1 for 50 cycles (with an elevated CE of roughly 96.7%), showing extremely steady reversibility of the electrochemical processes and exceptional capacity retention. Dense nanopores (pore size of about 3.8 nm) were generated on the surface of the G-NSs as a “microreactor” to restrict the S and polysulfide species by tailoring the chemical activation of hydrothermal rGO, resulting in increased cycle stability.399 Furthermore, Nazar et al.400 has shown that the polymer alteration of the C-surface can create a chemical gradient that slows the passage of large anions out of the electrode, thus allowing for further absolute response.
A number of h-G-based polymer/S NCs have been created as a result of this research.401 As an example, Dai et al. reported that S-NPs were first coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then enfolded in C-black-adorned GO-NSs. The G-NM coating layers and the PEG cushions worked together in this architecture to minimize polysulfide dissolution and diffusion, accommodate volume expansion, and eventually led to a stable capacity of 600 mA h g−1 at 0.2C (1C = 1672 mA g−1) over 100 cycles.402 In addition, two stable interfaces relying on rGO/S-NCs were constructed, and the customized cathode structure demonstrated an excellent long cycle life. Polydopamine (PD) molecules were initially coated on rGO/S-based NCs as a soft buffer to accommodate volume expansion and prevent polysulfide leakage during cycling, and then a crosslinking reaction in the PD buffer and the poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) binder was built to integrate the individual rGO/S-NCs into a whole system. Two reliable interfaces in the rGO/S and the buffer layer, as well as between the buffer layer and the binder, were created in this fashion. When this system was tested as a cathode material for LSBs, it obtained a specific capacity of 530 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g−1 because to its unique interface property. Another study worth mentioning in terms of long cycle stability is an ML and coaxial G–S–C nanofiber (G–S–CNF)-based NCs, which sustained 1500 charge/discharge cycling at 1C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) with a very low decay rate and a discharge capacity of 273 mA h g−1 (0.043% per cycle after 1500 cycles).403 However, in order to generate the ML hybrid structure, the S loading quantity reduced by 33%, which may not be ideal for achieving a high overall energy density for NCs.
The porous structure and intrinsic benefits of G-NSs, transforming the 2D G-NSs into a distinct 3D macroscopic structure, has recently turned out to be well-liked because it can give huge SSA, elevated mechanical strength, and quick mass and electron transport. Catalytic growth on layered double hydroxide at an elevated temperature, for example, was used to make a 3D G/SW-CNT) hybrid. Even at an elevated current rate of 5C, a highly conductive route was built, and the interior voids in the stacked G-NSs and SW-CNTs provided area for S storage, resulting in a capacity of 650 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (1C equals 1675 mA g−1). Similarly, by a simple two-step manufacturing procedure, MW-CNT@S NCs with a core-shell structure were effectively inserted into the interlay galleries of G-NSs.404 In addition, the 3D hierarchical sandwich-type design demonstrated an elevated initial capacity of about 1396 mA h g−1 at 0.2C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) when S active material was used efficiently (83%). Cheng's group has revealed hybrid G/S-NMs containing S nanocrystals anchored on interconnecting fibrous graphene.405 The formed structure may be cut as well as pressed into pellets form, which can be directly employed as the LSB cathodes without the use of a metal current collector, binder, or other conductive additive utilizing a freeze-drying technique. The porous network and S nanocrystals that enable rapid ion and Li+ transport, the highly conductive electron pathway offered by interconnected fibrous G-NMs, and strong binding between polysulfides and oxygen-containing groups all contributed to the hybrid's high capacity and outstanding high-rate performance.
Kang et al.406 investigated aerogels comprising 3D nitrogen-doped G/S NCs for LSBs. The fundamental purpose of this project was to form a stable, conductive-linked network structure for the battery cathode, with S acting as a stabilizer. The authors employed C2H8N2 as the nitrogen source, and they used a hydrothermal-assisted melt diffusion technique to achieve the doping. The nitrogen-doped G reduced the suspension of polysulfides in the electrolyte and reduced transport effects during cycling while battery testing, resulting in electrodes with high RC. They also showed that nitrogen-doped G/S-NCs outperformed acetylene black/S-NCs in terms of rate capability and cycle stability. Su et al.407 developed nitrogen-doped G/CNT hybrid NCs from Prussian blue for LSB uses. A substantial number of faults were found in hybrid electrodes, resulting in long-term cycling stability up to 1000th cycles. Furthermore, the 2D structure reduced the shuttle effects and avoided polysulfide dissolution. According to Shi et al.408 the B.G is very effective in improving the LSBs. The electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in the LIBs (oxalato)borate/dimethyl methyl-phosphonate electrolyte was used to obtain G-doping. In the LSB cathode, this doped-G displayed higher capacity and long-term cycle stability due to its high conductivity, great number of active sites, and improved strength. Table 4 summarized the results related to the use of G-NMs in the LSBs.

3.4. Graphene-based anode NMs for air batteries
The Li air/oxygen batteries (LABs), as prospective next-generation energy storage systems, do away with intercalation electrodes seen in the standard LIBs. In a porous electrode, Li ions react immediately with oxygen. The theoretical specific energy of such a unique battery chemistry and electrode design is significantly higher (3500 W h kg−1), offering tremendous potential to reach the objectives established for secondary batteries in automotive applications (1700 W h kg−1). Eqn (4)–(7) shows the essential electrochemical processes for aqueous and non-aqueous LABs. Anode: Li ↔ Li+ + e−(4) Cathode: Alkaline O2 + 2H2O + 4e− ↔ 4OH− × (E0 = 3.43 V vs., Li/Li+)(5) Acid O2 + 4e− + 4H+ ↔ 2H2O (E0 = 4.26 V vs., Li/Li+)(6) Non-aqueous 2Li++ 2e− + O2 ↔ Li2O2 (E0 = 2.96 V vs., Li/Li+)(7)Non-aqueous LABs have gained far more interest than aqueous LABs because they offer a greater theoretical energy density and less parasitic corrosion of Li at the anode, in contrast to aqueous LABs. The intended electrochemical reaction product for rechargeable LABs is shown in eqn (7), which should be Li2O2, the sole product that allows the LABs to be recharged. However, intermediates formed during the oxygen reduction, including O2−, O22−, and LiO/LiO−, are very reactive and may quickly destroy most organic electrolytes.447 As a result, instead of Li2O2, the discharge products of LABs are often made up of numerous side products. When carbonates are used as electrolytes, the major products are Li2CO3, Li alkylcarbonates, and LiOH.448 Furthermore, the slow kinetics of ORR (during discharge) and OER (when charging) in the Li+-containing aprotic electrolytes is a key obstacle that restricts the practical use of this technology.449 The creation of efficient electrocatalysts is critical for LAB development. This not only prevents side reactions but also encourages sluggish kinetics in the oxygen processes.
As electrocatalysts, p-C materials (i.e., C-black, active-C (AC), and diamond-like C), C-support precious (i.e., Pt, Au, and CuFe), and non-precious metals (i.e., RuO2, Co3O4, and MnO2) have been extensively studied. On account of its great chemical stability, outstanding conductivity, and huge SSA, 2D G-NSs have been shown to be very useful in improving the cathode performance. As a result, G-based NMs and their derivatives have been intensively studied as LAB electrodes. In most cases, G-NSs were used as a support to facilitate charge transfer and achieve the effective dispersion of metal/metal oxides (MOs) during the charging/discharging process. RuO2.3.4H2O-based NM support on rGO, for example, were studied in Li/oxygen cells as catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, Li2O2 production) and oxygen oxidation reaction (OER, Li2O2 reconversion).449 Although the rGO alone did not improve the Li2O2 production and oxidation processes, the scientists stated that the hybrids, particularly the hydrated RuO2·0.64H2O@rGO, demonstrated an improved catalytic activity. Its charge potential was decreased to 3.7 V and provided a high capacity of 5000 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1.450 As the chemically generated G-NMs includes multiple edge and defect sites, several scientists have attempted to investigate the catalytic activity of G-NSs without the inclusion of additional active elements (metal/MO-NPs), a process known as metal-free G-NMs. Metal-free G-NSs, for example, have been investigated as air electrodes in LABs with a hybrid electrolyte at 0.5 mA cm−1.450 The G-NSs had a high discharge voltage that was similar to 20 wt% Pt/C-black materials.451 Heat-treated G-NSs, for instance, not only had appealing catalytic activity in reducing oxygen but they also had substantially greater cycle stability than non-annealed G-NSs. The increased performance was related to the existence of sp3 bonding at the edge and defect locations, as well as the removal of certain adsorbed functional groups during the heat-treatment process, according to scientists. Interestingly, utilizing high-temperature annealed 3D GFs as electrodes significantly increased the electrochemical performance of Li-oxygen batteries, as revealed in a recent study.452 The improvement was attributed to the high temperature treatment's effective elimination of structural defects. Heat-treated 3D-GFs, on the other hand, had no catalytic impact on the ORR or OER in the system. As a result, further research is needed to confirm many hypothesis about G-based oxygen cathodes.450
G doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen and S has shown to have better catalytic activity for ORR.453 The nitrogen-doped G NS-rich NCs, for example, were made by graphitizing a heteroatom polymer called PANI.454 The NCs had a larger degree of quaternary and pyridinic-N than the metal-free G-catalysts, which corresponded to their considerably improved catalytic activity for ORR.
G-NMs have been considered for the customized design of the microstructure for LABs, in addition to their role as an electrocatalyst. P-C, which has a huge SSA and a large number of active sites, was formerly considered to be an appropriate component for obtaining the elevated performance of LABs. On the other hand, additional research found that the volume of mesopores with pore sizes in the range of 2–50 nm is directly connected to the discharge capacity of the LABs. Because of the small pore size, the excessive deposition of Li2O2 might clog the pore channels. Electrolytes may be poured into large pores, resulting in a two-phase zone rather than a three-phase region. The production of Li2O2 is hampered by this condition. Xiao et al.455 created a dual pore system using hierarchically p-G-based NMs as an electrode. Numerous huge tunnels allow continuous oxygen flow into the air electrode, while other small “pores” provide excellent tri-phase areas for oxygen reduction. The capacity of such a three-dimensional air electrode is extraordinarily high. The capacity of a 3D air electrode of this type was roughly 15000 mA h g−1. As shown in the previous studies, using graphene and its derivatives (i.e., annealing 2D-G and doped-G NMs) to develop the cathode performance of LAB was somewhat effective. However, it is unclear if the improvement was due to the G's catalytic action or other properties of the material (e.g., high SSA, high conductivity, and well-defined porosity) that aid in maximizing the effect of catalyst particles. The existence of active sites, pore size/structure of the support, and conductivity of the reaction products may all have an impact on the performance of the present LAB system. However, determining the most limiting issue remains challenging. Various test circumstances or air electrode configurations used by differing research organizations might sometimes result in different LAB findings. After all, the LABs are still in their infancy, and many basic challenges have yet to be resolved in the near future.
A 3D N, Fe, S-doped G-NM-based network was employed as an oxygen catalyst for ZABs in another study. Doped-G NSs has a greater output power density than commercial Pt/C electrodes when used as an air electrode. The doped electrode's hydrophilic character promoted electron adsorption throughout the electrochemical process, which improved the battery performance. The electrochemical behavior of Cl–G electrodes for vanadium redox flow batteries was investigated by Gursu et al.456 This doped G-based positive electrode was created using CVs and performed better in a V-containing mixed electrolyte (a mixture of 2.0 M VOSO4 and 5.0 M H2SO4). Vanadium redox flow batteries have also employed S-G NSs as a positive electrode. The S-doped electrode outperformed its undoped counterpart in terms of battery performance due to its larger electrochemical active surface area.
4. Graphene applications in ESDs: supercapacitors
Supercapacitors (SCs) are another rapidly growing type of ESDs for present advanced nanotechnologies that outperform batteries in terms of power density, cyclability, quick charging/discharging rates capability, straightforward principles, high activity of charge circulation, and low maintenance expenditure. Furthermore, the SCs need a simple charging circuit and have no memory effect, making them highly interesting candidates for upcoming renewable energy applications. SCs are also known as ECs and ultracapacitors106 that are thought to be a talented candidate for another ESDs.107 SCs have a greater energy density than ordinary dielectric capacitors, although they have an analogous cell structure to traditional capacitors, with the exception that the metal electrodes are restored by very porous electrodes457 so that the SCs might supplement the scarcity of traditional power sources.107 As a result, since its demonstration and patent by the General Electric in 1957,458 SC has piqued the attention of scientific communities and has created significant attention for a broad and emergent variety of uses requiring high power density, for example, energy backup systems, consumer portable devices, and electric/hybrid automobiles.459 The SCs are further divvied in two main groups, depending on their energy storage methods.
(1) Electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) that can store energy through the adsorption of both anions and cations; and
(2) PCs, which store energy through quick surface redox processes.
The performance of EDLCs that are non-Faradaic ultracapacitors is derived from a so-called double-layer capacitance.460 The capacitance is stored in the layers of the electrical double-layer generated at the interface in high-SSA electrode and electrolyte in these EDLC devices.461 The p-C materials, such as AC,462 xerogels,463 CNTs,464,465 mesoporous-C,466 and carbide-derived Cs,467 were calculated as electrodes in EDLCs. Several aspects of C-based materials are critical for achieving high-performance EDLCs, such as, according to extensive research, SSA, pore-size/distribution, and conductivity. Although porous C-based materials can achieve a high SSA in most instances, the poor conductivity of p-C materials limits their use in high-power-density SCs.468
The CNT-based SCs cannot satisfy acceptable performance despite their high electrical conductivity and huge SSA,469 which is likely owing to the experienced contact resistance in the electrode and the current collector.470 Furthermore, the CNTs' inherent impurities from electrocatalysts and a-C, as well as their expensive cost, have limited their use in SCs to far. As a result, much effort is still being put into creating new C-based SC-electrode materials with good overall performance. Few other types of electroactive materials have been studied extensively, TMOs or TM-hydroxides, for instance, RuO2, MnO2, and Ni(OH)2; conducting polymers, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, and polythiophene; conducting metals, for instance ruthenium oxide, manganese oxide, and Ni(OH)2, and materials with surface functional groups comprising oxygen and N.460 Still, more research is required and we will discuss in the coming section about G-NM applications in SCs.
PCs are another family member of SCs, which may reach substantially greater pseudo-capacitance than the EDLC capacitance. However, the low power density resulting from the poor conductivity limited quick electron transport as well as deficient in pure cycling stability because of the straightforwardly damaged configuration of the materials through the redox method, limit additional sensible uses of these electroactive materials in PCs. To tackle these issues, C-based NMs with elevated conductivity and big SSA are commonly employed as backbone materials for PC electrodes in combination with these active materials. The G-NSs is one of the most ideal substrate materials for creating PC's electrodes due to their numerous good qualities, including elevated conductivity and high mechanical strength. Fortunately, G-based NMs have emerged as a viable replacement to previous EDLC electrode materials. G-NM has a high electrical conductivity, large SSA, and dense interlayer structure when compared to typical p-C materials. As a result, the G-based NMs are extremely advantageous for use in EDLCs.27 PCs, unlike EDLCs, store energy by a Faradaic method involving quick and reversible redox reactions in the electrolyte and electroactive materials on the electrode surface.460 Here, we will review the development made until now in G-based SCs by examining the two basic types of SCs (EDLCs and PCs). We will summarize their mechanism and investigate the efficient ways to accomplish high SC performance. Fig. 10 shows the classifications as well as comparison of different ESDs.

4.1. Novel SCs electrode materials
While the marketed SCs can only reach 5–10 W h kg−1 of energy density, which is lesser than that of the batteries, which can produce 120–170 W h kg−1 of Li-ion cells.472 The current advances and challenges in developing SCs with high power and energy densities relied on G-based NMs, and their NCs will be reviewed in the sections below. The EDLCs are SCs that use the reversible adsorption of electrolyte ions onto active materials to store charge electrostatically. The key to charge the double layer with high capacitance is to use electrodes with a large SSA and elevated conductivity. G-based NMs are appealing in this aspect because of their unique mechanical and electrical capabilities, with their extremely elevated SSA. Pure G-NSs, metal, metal hydroxide, layered double hydroxide, MO, and foreign elements (B, N, S, or P)-doped pure G-NSs are the most-often investigated materials (Table 5).

In typical SCs electrode performance investigation, liquid or gel-like electrolytes, such as KOH, NaOH, and H2SO4, were utilized, and a small number of cases were approved using Na2SO4 solution. The GA/TiO2 electrode demonstrated significant specific capacitance in the simulated saline H2O (0.1 M NaCl solution) in the range of 50–150 F g−1 under varied scanning rates (5–1000 mV s−1) in the study by Yin et al.516 However, after 1000 cycles of operation in 0.1 M NaCl, it had essentially little capacitance retention in simulated salty H2O. After achieving equilibrium at 200 s, the GA/TiO2 electrode demonstrated great desalination efficiency with strong regeneration efficiency over 10 cycles, which was substantially stronger than that of pure GA and plain AC. Fig. 11 represents these outstanding achievements. Even though El-Deen-AG et al.515 demonstrated that the low specific capacitance retention (4.9%) of Gr/SnO2 in NaCl solution was short-lived (50 cycles), it still achieved 83% salt removal efficiency from NaCl solution. Such trials revealed the feasibility of utilizing MO/GA as fresh H2O-generating materials via SCs operation for the desalination of salty H2O. Now, we will explain in detail about SCs electrode materials based on G-NMs.

4.1.1. Heteroatom doped-graphene NS-based materials. 
Heteroatom doping, in addition to an increase in B.G., causes major modifications in G-based NMs. The structural deformation of G-NSs and charge polarization between the dopant and C-atoms are two examples of these modifications. The following are some additional repercussions (and advantages) of heteroatom-doping G-based NMs for ESD applications.
(1) The addition of heteroatoms increases the reactivity by generating an elevated quantity of active sites, notably in the G-NS basal plane.
(2) G's electronic conductivity may be improved by adding heteroatoms.
(3) When heteroatoms are doped into G-NMs, defects are formed, which make the structure more porous and increase the accessibility of electrolyte ions.
(4) Synergistic effects among dopants can develop the electrochemical characteristics by producing more non-neutral sites during the co-doping process.
(5) The heteroatoms provide pseudocapacitance in the SCs, which contributes to the device's overall capacitance.
(6) Heteroatom doping enhances the SSA of G-NMs by producing edge entanglement. The vast SSA and more active sites of nitrogen-doped G-NSs, for example, are dependable for enhancing ORR.
Doping increases the G-NMs' wet ability that is not only important for device uses but also advantageous for majority chemical methods. Fig. 11 depicts some of the key results of doping in G-NMs, with an emphasis on their use in ESDs. Each dopant atom's relevant features in the electrode materials are given. The improved capabilities of doped G-based NMs for SC devices are due to the pseudocapacitive role of the dopants with superior EDLC nature of the G-NMs, and the increased conductivity. As the SC electrodes, doped and co-doped G-NMs have been used. N, among the many heteroatoms, is thought to be the most important dopant for improving the capacitive characteristics of C materials since it creates more sites for faradaic redox processes. Aside from the pseudocapacitive effect, N-doping changes the electrical configuration of the G-NMs, resulting in a higher charge carrier density. Several investigations on the manufacture of N/G-NSs for SC electrodes have been reported. Because of their pseudocapacitive effect, both pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N forms tend to increase the specific capacitance. Graphitic-N, on the other hand, tends to boost the G's NM conductivity and significant concentrations of the N-atoms on the basal plane also raise the specific capacitance. Yu et al.520 report the hydrothermal synthesis of nitrogen-doped G NSs employing (NH4)2HPO4 as a doping agent. The authors proved the role of nitrogen at the margins of graphene layers and its influence on the capacitive characteristics. They also demonstrated that quinine oxygen contributes to pseudocapacitive characteristic of the doped electrode.
In aqueous electrolytes, the materials showed excellent capacitance and improved the cycle stability. To make porous nitrogen-doped G-NSs, Liu et al.521 utilized CH4N2O as a doping agent. After N-doping, the BET-based calculated SSA of the N/G-NSs increased thrice, according to the researchers. The scientists increased the energy and power density of the doped G-based symmetric SCs (SSCs) using a non-aqueous electrolyte. There have also been reports of flexible solid-state SCs electrodes founded on nitrogen/G-NM monoliths.522 CH8ClN5 was used as a nitrogen dopant and a reducing agent for GO-NSs. The material was mechanically strong and had good cycle stability. The SC electrodes were also treated with nitrogen-doped G-As. The electrochemical performance of the nitrogen-doped G-NM cathodes for Al-ion hybrid SCs was improved by Lei et al.523 The scientists also created co-doped G-based NMs for SC electrodes by combining the superior characteristics of nitrogen-doped G-NMs with other dopants. Cheng et al.524 for example, described the radiolytic production of N,S co-doped G-NMs with long-term cycling stability of up to 25000-charging/discharging cycles. The pseudocapacitive contribution was dramatically increased by the uniform dispersion of MO and metal sulphide particles over the conductive network of nitrogen-G NMs. The multiple components' synergistic effects led to a high RC and remarkable electrochemical characteristics.
Zhang et al.525 used a simple heat treatment approach to manufacture the co-doped B/nitrogen-doped G NMs. The scientists used electron-beam irradiation to synthesize the co-doped B/nitrogen-G from GO, utilizing C3H7NO2S as nitrogen-S co-dopant. The higher SSA and pyrrolic-N content were attributable to the larger irradiation dosage, which enhanced the SSA and the pyrrolic-N content. As a result of the large atomic radius of S that inhibited its integration into the C-network, the S-concentration in the co-doped electrodes was lesser than the nitrogen-content. Chen et al.526 exhibited good SC performance for the co-doped B/nitrogen-G such as C with long-term cycle stability. The ball-milling technique with H3BO3 and nitrogen gas was used to prepare the electrodes.
Nanohybrids based on doped G have also been prepared to boost the electrochemical characteristics of the electrodes for high energy/power density SC ESDs. Wu et al.527 used a hydrothermal technique to prepare NCs based on nitrogen-G NMs and Fe2O3, utilizing a number of amino acids as N-sources, such as C4H7NO4 (acidic), C2H5NO2 (neutral), and C6H14N2O2 (basic). The N/G-NMs from aspartic acid treatment were shown to have a 3D porous structure. Electrostatic repulsion in the negatively charged GO and the negatively charged C4H7NO4 has prevented G-based NM aggregation. Through effective proton transfer in the hybrid's 3D-structure, SSCs relied on these electrodes, which demonstrated higher cycle stability and energy density. Cui et al.528 investigated the electrochemical performance of the hybrid electrodes based on MnO2/Mn3O4 with nitrogen/G-NMs. Hydrothermal processing was employed to make the electrode materials, with C2H8N2 as the nitrogen source for doping. MnO2-NSs coated with Mn3O4 octahedrons obtained high capacitance using nitrogen/G-NMs as an anchoring substrate. The improved electrochemical capabilities can be attributed to the NCs electrode's lower bulk resistance, in addition to the morphological component. A similar study concentrating on free-standing binder-less SC electrodes based on nitrogen/G-NMs and MnO2 was also published. The SCs electrodes based on a-MnS and co-doped nitrogen/S-rGO were produced by Mohamed et al.529 The obtained cycling stability was more than 100% after 10000 cycles using C2H8N2 and CS2 as nitrogen and S sources, respectively. Li et al.530 created hollow NiCo2O4 nanorods on the surface of nitrogen/G-NSs, which performed well in an aqueous electrolyte with a high concentration. Wang et al.531 used nickel oxide/nickel ferrite-based NPs to decorate the surface of the nitrogen/G-NMs to produce high-performance SC electrodes. CH4N2O was also used as a source of nitrogen for G-NMs doping in their study.


4.1.2. Hybridized graphene for SCs. 
Considerable research efforts are dedicated for the production of hybridized-G (h-G) electrodes with high SSA, improved conductivity, and enhanced capacitance to improve the performance ahead of the limitations of pristine G-NMs, guided by different hybridization principles. Here, we will focus on the recent developments in h-G electrodes for SC applications.
4.1.2.1. Hybridized graphene with improved SSA. 
As mentioned before, in this study, we will focus on the hybridization of the spacers, e.g., C-based spacers may be further classified according to their dimensions, for instance, 0D, 1D, and 3D C spacers. C-Quantum-dots (CQDs), a type of 0D C-NMs, have shown promise in the domains of photoluminescence, photocatalysis, bioimaging, and biosensing. CQDs have recently been employed in SC applications as electrode materials. CQDs have comparatively high oxygen content due to their low-temperature production from C hydrates, which gives them hydrophilicity and increases the wettability when attached to electrode materials. In 2017, Zhao et al.532 employed a facile one-pot hydrothermal technique to create linked 3D rGO-NS networks adorned with CQDs (rGO/CQDs), as shown in Fig. 12(a). The hydrothermal approach not only caused simultaneous GO reduction and 3D-rGO framework self-assembly but also encouraged homogeneous in situ decoration of the CQDs onto the G-NSs, resulting in a hybrid structure with a larger concentration of meso and macrosized holes. Despite the fact that the SSA of rGO/CQDs (44.52 m2 g−1) was lower than that of pristine rGO electrodes (165.95 m2 g−1), the larger meso/macropores with diameters >20 nm vastly increased the utilization of available SSA for G-NSs (Fig. 12(b)). Given that larger holes promote easy ion transport with a shorter ion diffusion distance, this predicts an increase in ion-accessible SSAs, which might improve the capacitance and rate capability at the same time. The high oxygen content of CQDs (33%) aided the hybridized rGO frameworks that were predicted to provide further surface-active sites, for example, carbonyl (CO) and carboxylic (O–CO) groups. These surface-active sites (particularly, the numerous CO groups) are important for initiating redox reactions with electrolyte ions, resulting in additional pseudocapacitance in the system. The rGO/CQDs hybrid electrodes in the KOH electrolyte achieved a greater capacitance value of 308 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 balance to the rGO electrodes (200 F g−1) and outstanding capacitance retention of over 92% after 20000 charging/discharging cycles at 10 A g−1.

The low toxicity and cheap cost of CQDs,533 combining graphene with CQDs derived from biomass wastes, provides a long-term option for fabricating SC electrodes with large accessible SSAs and consequently promising electrochemical performance. Hoang et al.534 suggested new h-G electrodes based on zucchini-derived CQDs later in 2019. In the two-step hydrothermal procedures, environmentally benign bio-derived CQDs were used as spacers to successfully avoid the G-NSs from restacking, resulting in a two-fold increase in the SSA and total pore volume over rGO. A subsequent simple reduction by hydrogen iodide (HI) vapor was anticipated to increase the conductivity, develop active sites of oxygen/iodine containing groups to increase the pseudocapacitance (Cp), and aid ionic penetration in an alkaline medium in the quest of maximal electrochemical performance. The resulting rGO/CQDs contain 6.1 wt% I, have an SSA of 185 m2 g−1 and highest specific capacitance of 374 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 due to controlled HI reduction.
Wang et al.535 recently proposed adding AC-NPs to rGO-NSs to enhance the electrochemical results of the G-based formed electrodes. The AC-NPs are made from discarded C filters that have been activated. When SSA and micropores were hybridized into the G-based materials, an increase in both was found. This was because the addition of AC-NPs separates the neighboring G-NSs. The micropores are thought to offer active sites for ion adsorption, whereas mesopores and macropores are thought to give ion diffusion routes, hence improving pore distribution, which helps enhance the capacitive behavior. The rGO/AC-NP electrodes have a higher capacitance (116.9 F g−1) than rGO electrodes (107.5 F g−1). The modest progress in the SSA and the shrinking of meso/macropores might explain the weaker improvement. Adding 15 portions of economical AC-NPs into 1 section of graphene electrodes, on the other hand, might boost the unique capacitance given by rGO up to 541 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which was closer to the theoretical limit of pure G-NMs. While the use of bio-waste demonstrated the economical nature of this hybridization, future research would need to look into the one-step manufacture of h-CQDs/G electrodes with desirable attributes, for instance, acceptable CQD sizes, and optimal C:O ratio in CQDs and G-NMs.
For almost a decade, 1D-CNTs have been the preferred graphene hybridization material to boost the conductivity and enhance the SSA of electrodes in SC applications. When used in electrodes to build the EDLCs, its distinctive hollow nanotubes structure enables for the easy movement of both ions and electrons. In-plane intercalated CNTs or out-of-plane orientated CNTs may be effectively hybridized with G-NSs using structural designs to prevent unwanted aggregation (Fig. 12(c)). Cui et al.536 suggested a binder-free rGO/CNT hybrid film synthesizing technique based on sonication and low-temperature thermal treatment in 2015. The CNTs were found intercalated into packed rGO-NSs, functioning as spacers to prevent the rGO NSs from colliding in the basal planes. The CNTs might also provide channels for rapid ion transport along the 2D planes of the packed rGO structure, resulting in a considerable rise in the rate capability. As a consequence, in a 1 m Na2SO4 solution, the specific capacitance of the rGO/CNT hybrid could reach 272 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1.
Efforts were made to develop the structural design and electrochemical performance not only in gravimetric values, but also at the volumetric scale, which is much more relevant in expressions of practical application of C-based SCs. Densely-packed G-NSs in combination with rationally-designed “spacers” in between the NSs can efficiently raise the bulk density of the produced electrode materials, hence increasing the volumetric performance. On the other hand, while in-plane ion diffusion may be significantly addressed, interlayer ion transportation/diffusion in dense graphene-based NSs remains a serious difficulty. Jiang et al.537 developed a simple graphene etching procedure and vacuum-assisted filtering technique to produce densely packed graphene nanomesh-CNT hybrid films (G/nitrogen-CNTs). The pores on G-NSs produced paths for the electrolyte ions to transit in the interlayer direction, as seen in Fig. 12(d), while the intercalated CNTs promoted channels for rapid in-plane diffusion and the transportation for both ions and electrons.
This endows G/nitrogen–CNT hybrid films with 3D rapid ion-transport network and considerably improves the ion accessibility while charging/discharging at high rates. The SSA value of 220 m2 g−1, which was nearly nine times greater than that of densely packed rGO films, was combined with a large pore volume of 0.369 cm3 g−1 in the G/nitrogen-CNTs films. Ion transport was facilitated by the electrode material's high porosity and SSA, which also offered enough available contact sites in electrode materials and electrolyte ions. The effective hybridization of CNTs in tightly packed graphene nanomeshes resulted in a high volumetric capacitance of 331 F cm−3 and an energy density of 26 W h L−1. The vertical development of CNTs on the G-NM's planes necessitates greater manufacturing accuracy. Hybridizing CNTs vertically onto individual G-NSs will greatly minimize graphene restacking, while also acting as channels to promote ion/electron transport in all directions in the 3D-G/CNTs network due to their 1D architecture. However, the perfect control of the CNTs’ perpendicular development generally necessitates time and energy-intensive CVD methods. Balamurugan et al.541 studied on the easy vertical assembly of Co-encapsulated CNTs over nitrogen-G NSs in 2016. The high SSA of 469 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.38 cm3 g−1 might explain the unique 3D structure's promise for electrolyte accessibility and electron transport. The Co-NPs enclosed in CNTs let CNTs grow vertically and improve electron transfer between the CNTs and nitrogen-doped G-NSs. As a result of the successful combination of the pseudocapacitive Co-NPs and ion-accessible G/CNT framework, a capacitance of about 2568 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte was attained and retained 96.64% of its capacitance at 50 A g−1. Abdollahi et al.539 used the KOH activation method to create nanoscale holes in the G-layers, followed by the plasma-enhanced DC-CVD method to grow vertically-aligned CNTs over activated rGO-NSs (Fig. 12(e and f)). The active pores on the rGO plane provide growth sites for direction-guided CNT deposition, and the new 3D structure obtained a large available SSA of 169.6 m2 g−1 with a huge pore diameter of about 41.67 nm. The insertion of both nanopores and vertical CNTs channels onto the parallel-packed rGO-NSs ensured both in-plane and interlayer easy ion transport. As a consequence, a remarkable capacitance of 412 F g−1 was attained at 0.5 A g−1. However, the intricacy of the manufacturing process, as well as the necessity for severe temperatures to meet the demands of alkali activation and CVD deposition, hindered its use in practical devices.
Interlayer hybridization attempts are often more difficult to execute than in-plane CNT/G hybridization and require more precise controls in synthesis procedures, despite the fact that their structural designs might increase the interlayer spacing between the G-NSs to a greater amount. As a result, easy and straightforward methods for realizing the vertical growth of CNTs onto the G-planes are highly desired, but remain difficult to achieve in the field of SC electrodes. The necessity for developing sustainable and environmentally acceptable electrode materials has prompted researchers to combine G-NMs with 3D-C networks, particularly those formed from biomass sources. Huang et al.540 for example, created a linked 3D framework consisting of electrochemically rGO-NFs and cellulose in 2015. Fig. 12(g and h) shows the fabrication and SEM of hierarchical porous framework. The 3D networks rich in micro/meso/macropores on the G-NFs and macropores formed in the framework with ultrahigh SSA of 1533 m2 g−1 were achieved after template-free low-temperature activation of the cellulose/G-hybrids. The hierarchical 3D-porous material provided stable macroporous frameworks for good electrical contact and ion/electrolyte diffusion paths, and thermal and chemically durable backbones to survive severe circumstances over time. In KOH, the cellulose/G-hybrid electrode had a specific capacitance of 300 F g−1 and high gravimetric (180–200 F g−1) and volumetric (145–160 F cm−3) specific capacitances. When the 3D hybrid electrode was built into the SCs systems using the EMIMBF4IL electrolyte, a consistent energy density of 67 W h kg−1 was achieved. The use of a rich renewable biomass cellulose precursor and a low-temperature activation procedure, in particular, were capable of reducing the manufacturing costs and provide a method for creating long-lasting h-G electrodes with higher performance (Table 2). Hybridizing G-based electrodes with 0D, 1D, and 3D C spacers is useful not simply for increasing the ion-accessible SSA by raising the interlayer spacing and refining the pore structure, but also for further improving the conductivity and initiating pseudocapacitance. The CQDs, for example, often have a larger percentage of the oxygen-containing functional groups (OCFGs), which can introduce redox-active pseudocapacitance into G-based NMs electrodes, whereas the CNTs, as a result of their unique 1D C structure, can function as spacers and interlayer electrical conductors.
4.1.2.2. Hybridized graphene with improved conductivity. 
Because of their high inherent electrical conductivity, anchoring noble metal elements such as Au and Ag onto the G-NMs-based electrodes has been thought to be a viable way to improve interlayer conductivity. They function as conductive roadways for electrons to travel between the graphene layers. Furthermore, the exceptional interactions in nanosized precious metal-based compounds and electrolyte ions can improve the h-G system's electrochemical performance. The performance of h-G electrodes is affected by both the nanomorphology and the bulk loading of Ag-NWs. Simple coating procedures can usually spread Ag-NWs onto G-NSs; however, the interaction between the Ag-NWs and G-NSs may be disrupted. The Ag-NPs are often made using more difficult processes and can create a firmer bond with G-NSs. Furthermore, their 0D shape indicates that the G-NSs and electrolyte ions are exposed to larger SSAs. This is needed in order to improve the G-NSs surface contact and introduce Cp into the system. However, with high mass loading ratios, Ag-NPs tend to cluster, blocking the pores in the G-electrodes and increasing resistances instead. The conductivity of the G-based electrodes may be considerably improved using highly conductive Ag-NWs. For example, due to the insulating nature of the GO-NSs, GOs are typically not ideal for direct use as the SCs electrodes, even if decorated OCFGs might inject Cp into the system and improve the wettability of the electrode surface. Patil et al.542 used Ag-NWs to create an LBL GO/Ag-NWs hybrid electrode (Fig. 13(a)). The linked Ag-NWs formed a conductive channel and coupled the nearby GO together to enable rapid electron transport (Fig. 13(b)), as evidenced by the substantial reduction in charge transfer resistance (Rct) from 20.58k in pristine GO to 7.18k in the GO/Ag-NWs hybrid film. Aside from allowing the use of OCFG redox processes (eqn (8)), Ag-NWs were also supplied the Cp (eqn (9)), resulting in a high specific capacitance of 273 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. The successful employment of the pseudocapacitive species lacking the necessity to reduce the GO-NSs to restore the conductivity of the G-NSs was possible by a simple LBL drop-casting approach, which opens up a new path for constructing highly conductive SCs in a highly efficient way. >C–OH ↔ >CO + H+ + e−(8) Ag ↔Ag+ + e−(9)Khamlich et al.543 hypothesized in 2017 that hybridizing graphene with Ag-NPs might increase electron transport kinetics. When placed onto G-NSs, Ag-NPs have showed double the conductivity of GFs, owing to the huge SSA to volume ratio at the nanoscale. The uniform and homogeneous attachment of Ag-NPs onto G-NMs by a simple procedure, on the other hand, remains a challenge. Ag-NPs with an average size of 40 nm were densely deposited onto the 3D graphene network surfaces using a simple microwave-assisted growing technique (Fig. 13(c)). When submerged in KOH electrolyte, the uniformly-anchored Ag-NPs shifted the porosity configuration of the GFs toward a mesopore-dominant morphology that was sought by ion diffusion, and therefore enhanced the electrochemical performance of G-NSs. Furthermore, the Ag-rich electrode induced Ag-NPs (Ag2+ ↔ Ag3+) redox processes, resulting in an outstanding capacitance of 528 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The inserted Ag-NPs considerably increased the conductivity of the G-NMs networks, with the internal resistance (Rs) of the electrode falling to just 0.99 compared to 4.74 in the original graphene networks (Fig. 13(d)).

Sarno et al.544 presented a unique one-step solution technique for producing rGO/Ag-NPs electrodes that is “green”. An outstanding electrical conductivity of 1.3107 S m−1 was attained because of good G-NSs exfoliation and homogenous dispersion of tightly packed Ag-NPs, which is comparable to the CVD-grown graphene values. When using rGO/Ag-NPs as the SCs electrodes, a low RS of just 0.97 and an equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 1.5 were produced, and an exceptional capacitance value of 776 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Unlike the easy scattering of Ag-NWs on the GO-NSs by quick drop-casting, Ag-NPs were securely connected to the top of the G-NSs by either ionic bonds or weak vdWs forces, and the negative charge of G-NMs stabilized them. In comparison to just combining Ag with “G-NMs”, the greater contact between Ag and G-NMs imparted synergetic effects to the h-G material, resulting in higher electrochemical performance, as reported by Luan et al.545 in Ag-NWs/rGO-Hs. The introduction of the -NWs into the rGO-Hs networks increased the conductivity and pore size of the 3D-rGO networks, indicating a high specific capacitance of about 369 F g−1 for the SCs electrodes. The development of easy, rapid, and cost-effective hybridization procedures to manufacture well-incorporated Ag/G electrodes was described recently, motivated by the considerably increased electrical conductivity and charge storage capacity.
Sahoo et al.546 suggested a single-step, easy, and surfactant-free freeze-casting process for making cellular 3D-G/Ag-NCs as SCs electrodes in 2018. The strong contact in the Ag-NPs and the G-matrix, as well as the covalent coupling between the G-NSs sp2 C and Ag-NPs (Ag–O–C), provided quick and efficient charge transmission and storage from the chemical redox reaction of Ag-NPs. Thus, the attained ultrahigh capacitance and exceptional cyclic stability were about 845 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with a retention of 97% after 1000 cycles, respectively. On the other hand, if the number of Ag particles is not adequately regulated, the hybridization of Ag onto the rGO is not always helpful. In 2019, a simple and one-pot immediate reducing technique was used to explore the influence of Ag-NPs loading in the rGO (Ag-NPs/rGO) hybridized electrodes on electrochemical performances. In order to obtain greater conductivity and electrochemical performance, the loading ratio of Ag-NPs was discovered to be crucial. Although the Ag-NPs and rGO-NSs are both intrinsically highly conductive, the aggregation of Ag species and the obstruction of ion diffusion channels in the rGO networks would result in higher resistance in the hybridized electrodes (Fig. 13(e)). While improving the Ag-NPs loading ratio into the rGO-NSs could considerably increase both electron transport and ion diffusion to the electrode system, the produced Ag-NPs/rGO SCs could achieve high rate capability and cycle stability.
Au-NPs have also been hybridized with G-NSs in addition to Ag-NPs to increase the conductivity of the G-NMs-based electrodes. Ankamwar et al.548 used high-energy gamma radiation to produce G/Au-NPs electrodes. On G-NSs, the Au-NPs with a mean particle size of 12 nm were uniformly disseminated. Even when the scan rate was raised from 5 to 500 mV s−1, no change in the specific capacitance of the as-synthesized graphene/Au-NPs electrodes was detected. This suggests that the deposition of Au-NPs resulted in high electrical conductivity and ion transportation. When the scan rate was raised to 500 mV s−1, the pure G-NMs-based electrodes suffered significant 50% capacitance loss. Hg-NPs and Au-NPs are effective hybridization agents for improving the G-NMs-based electrode interlayer conductivity, preventing G-NSs from restacking and increasing the capacitance by adding Cp. The scarcity of noble metals, however, limits the growth of Ag and Au species in h-G NMs based electrodes, which greatly supports the development of cost-effective hybridizing agents to further increase the conductivity of G-NMs networks.
Heteroatom doping is frequently employed to increase G-NMs-based electrodes' in-plane conductivity. The N and P atoms for n-type doping and B atoms for p-type doping are the most often employed dopants. The N atoms in the nitrogen-doped G-NMs are typically doped into the graphene lattice in one of the three bonding configurations, namely, quaternary nitrogen (or graphitic-N), pyridinic-N, or pyrrolic-N. When nitrogen atoms are doped into the C-matrix, local electron-rich sites are predicted since nitrogen has one more electron than C according to its atomic structure. Pyrrolic-N, on the other hand, supplies two p-electrons to the C-matrix whereas pyridinic-N interacts with two C-atoms and adds one p-electron to the structure. Because these doped nitrogen atoms supply additional charge carriers, the electrical conductivity of the G-NSs would be greatly increased. The nitrogen dopants, which generate the “activation area” in the G-NSs, will also affect the spin density and charge allocation of the C-matrix.549 The G-NSs' catalytic and electrochemical reactivity might be considerably improved by the assisted activation areas. There is a widespread understanding that the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N can contribute to pseudocapacitance, resulting in increased total capacitance, whereas quaternary nitrogen can significantly improve the electronic conductivity, based on practical and theoretical study. However, selective G-NMs doping has only been achieved in a few cases.
Yen et al.550 achieved perpendicularly-associated epitaxial G-nanowalls (G-NWls) doped with dominant pyridinic C-nitrogen bonding in 2015. The “all edge-plane” exposure of perpendicularly aligned nanowall structure of G-NSs, the more stable nature of the six-member rings compared to the five-member pyrazole ring, and the lower formation energy of pyridinic-N compared to pyrrolic-N and graphitic-N could all contribute to the dominant pyridinic-N doping. The ESR and Rct were both decreased following nitrogen doping, according to the Nyquist plots. This indicates that G-NSs have improved conductivity, which might be related to the increased charge density within the G-NSs. Despite the fact that the SSA remained nearly unchanged after nitrogen doping, the capacitive response of the nitrogen-doped G-NWls was much enhanced due to better electron transportation, introduction of Cp, and enhancement of G-NMs surface electrolyte wettability. Further experimental research into the precise regulation of nitrogen-doping at the atomic level has been spurred by this pioneering investigation of selective nitrogen doping, and further studies into the mechanisms of C-nitrogen electrochemical behaviors are predicted.
Despite substantial study into nitrogen-doped G-NMs-based electrodes, nitrogen-atom incorporation is mostly accomplished using CVD, nitrogen plasma, supercritical reaction, and arc discharge. These methods need high-cost machinery and low manufacturing efficiency. As a result, simple and straightforward nitrogen-doped G-NSs production processes are in high demand in the SCs sector. Lin et al.80 described a simple and one-step pyrolysis technique for porous nitrogen (PN)-doped G/CNTs-based NC-based electrodes. When urea was used as the nitrogen donor during the pyrolysis process, it was combined with economical lignosulfonate to form ion pathways when degraded. CNTs were used as an added “spacer” to boost the SSA of this porous electrode in addition to the nitrogen-doped G-NSs structure. When compared to the raw rGO electrodes in terms of charge transfer and ion transportation capabilities, the PN-G/CNTs electrodes show a noticeable improvement in internal conductivity. This showed that nitrogen doping and the development of pores efficiently reduced electrode resistance, with holes providing more channels for ion transport and nitrogen doping providing more active sites to increase the electrical conductivity. The addition of additional electroactive sites increased the materials' durability, as the specific capacitance of the PN-G/CNTs only reduced by 3.5% after 2000 rapid cycles, compared to 7.8% for electrodes without nitrogen doping. On the other hand, there was a trade-off in the efficiency of producing nitrogen-doped G-NSs and the effectiveness of nitrogen-doping in terms of enhancing the electrochemical performance.
Though the inexpensive and time reduction nitrogen-doping procedure signaled mass fabrication possibilities in the SCs sector, the PN-G NMs-based CSs electrode only had a modest capacitance of 250 F g−1. Similarly, Haque et al.551 studied a simple thermal treatment of GO/N-containing donors for the creation of nitrogen-doped G-NSs-based electrodes, with a capacitance of roughly 210 F g−1 and significantly increased electrical conductivity and ion-accessibility over pristine G-NMs. Gao et al.552 increased the rate capability and electrochemical capacitive performance by adopting the acid purification procedure following hydrothermal nitrogen doping of the G-NMs system with the intention of producing greater capacitance using an inexpensive production strategy. Apart from removing excess o-phenylenediamine (oPDA) molecules, acid treatment causes some of the pyridinic-N to be oxidized into nitrogen-oxygen species, increasing the relative concentration of NH2 and quaternary-N. Purified electrodes have a conductivity of about 66.8 S m−1 that was greater than the conductivity of pure rGO-Hs (9.23 S m−1) and nitrogen-doped electrodes before purification (3.69 S m−1). Purified nitrogen-doped rGO-Hs have a capacitance of up to 519.8 F g−1, indicating that they might be used in ultrahigh power density SCs.
P-Doping is another way to improve the G-NM's electrochemical performance without resorting to n-type doping. The addition of electrons from the P-atoms might develop the in-plane conductivity of G-NSs. Incorporating P-rich groups into the C-matrix, for example, might considerably increase the wettability of G-NSs in aqueous solution while also expanding the voltage window of the SCs electrodes based on such materials. Furthermore, the larger P-atom size and the favorable sp3-orbital with a pyramidal shape may result in a more deformed and wrinkled morphology with many open edge sites that is advantageous for surface redox reactions and ion transport. Traditional P-doping, on the other hand, is highly reliant on the high-temperature calcination of triphenylphosphine (TPP), where P-doping was discovered to be inhomogeneous in the C-lattice. Excessive P-doping on G-NSs might result in morphological changes and a reduction in the electrical conductivity owing to the presence of sp3 P-atoms. Therefore, homogenous and controlled P-doping technologies are in high demand, although they are still difficult to achieve.
Intriguingly, when more than one heteroatom is doped into C-materials, the benefits of synergistic coupling effect have been discovered, attracting increasing interest. Wang et al.553 showed the in situ production of nitrogen, P dual-doped mesoporous-G frameworks using strong electrostatic interactions between GO-NSs and the P-containing microgels generated from TPP in 2017. The continuous mesoporous structure and greater SSA, resulting from the deformed morphology generated by the inclusion of C-P bonds, were predicted to result in a significant boost in the capacitance when compared to nitrogen-doped G-NSs frameworks not including P doping. The enhancement in electron transport and ion diffusion in the nitrogen, P co-doped G-NSs also resulted in a relatively low internal resistance and charge-transfer resistance, suggesting outstanding rate capability and power performance.
The heat treatment of G-NMs with (NH4)3PO4 has been proposed as the activation of (NH4)3PO4 progressively releases NH3 and phosphoric acid to provide nitrogen and P atoms for the G-NMs matrix, motivated by the necessity to find facile techniques to accomplish N, P co-doping of graphene. Xia et al.554 advocated the use of pre-functionalized G-NMs with greater oxygen content in thermal annealing using (NH4)3PO4 instead of the commonly-used thermally-annealed G-NMs to further improve this simple procedure. It was discovered that the high-concentration oxygen resulting from a simple thermal exfoliation procedure might promote N and P doping into G-NSs, providing insight into the precise tuning of the G-NMs to ensure N, P co-doping efficacy. The quaternary-N synthesized improved the electrical conductivity, whilst the P-containing groups enhanced the surface wettability and increased the electro-oxidation resistance of the C-electrodes, resulting in a 1.5 V wider cell voltage in 6 m KOH aqueous electrolyte.
Given the nature of the SC energy storage equation, this co-doping technique has a high potential for increasing the electrochemical capacitance while also expanding the possible window of viable devices. This might push the practical energy density to the top level. To improve the electrochemical behavior of the G-NMs-based electrodes, p-type doping with boron-based precursors has recently been used. When boron (B) is added into the G-NMs layers, it causes fascinating changes in both the electrical structure and oxidation levels because it has one less electron and lower electronegativity than C-atoms in the valence layer.555 Because there are less valence electrons in the “B” atoms in G-NSs, fewer electrons are obtained, which enhanced the p-type charge carrier quantity. As a result, increased electrical conductivity is envisaged. The synthesis of borates such as B2O3 or BCxOy and substitutional B in the C-matrix, on the other hand, may bring Cp into G-NMs-based electrodes and increase the overall capacitance.556 Unlike nitrogen-doped G-NSs, which are affected by the adsorption of oxygen and H2O molecules from the atmosphere, B-G NSs have consistent electrical characteristics regardless of the external surroundings. However, successfully doping B into the G-NSs remains a big difficulty since extended reaction times or elevated temperatures are frequently needed, and only 1% B doping can be obtained.
Yeom et al.493 presented a facile heat treatment technique of the GO/B2O3 combination to achieve high-concentration B doping of rGO in 2015. The XPS spectra revealed a high concentration of about 6.04 at% B atoms, indicating that the simultaneous doping and reduction procedure enabled the elevated efficiency of B–G NSs synthesis. Because the doping enhanced the carrier concentration of materials, the insertion of uniformly-anchored B atoms boosted the conductivity considerably.557 A larger SSA was obtained as a result of B incorporation into the G-NMs-based matrix since defect-like tiny holes in the basal plane of the G-NSs were produced, inhibiting the creation of a graphitic structure. The resulting electrodes achieved a high capacitance of about 448 F g−1 without the use of conductive additives due to the increased electrical conductivity and high SSA acquired from B doping.
Pan et al.558 advanced the manufacture of h-G NSs electrodes even closer to the practical level in 2018. With a commercial G-NMs mass loading of about 10 mg cm−2, a binder-free 3D B–N–P tertiary-doped holey G-Hs (BNP-HG-Hs) electrode was produced. The ternary doping of B, N, and P elements improved the compatibility of the produced electrode materials with both H2SO4 and EMIMBF4 IL electrolytes in a synergistic manner. The capacitance performances did not degrade sharply when the mass loading was improved considerably from 1 mg cm−2 to 10 mg cm−2 owing to the high conductivity and fast ion diffusion of the BNP-HG-Hs electrodes, ensuring excellent overall performance when accumulated to commercial-level mass loading of the SCs. The total energy density of the SCs device (containing all electrodes, current collectors, electrolyte, separator, and packaging) was determined to be 57.4 W h L−1, which is equivalent to lead-acid batteries currently on the market (50–90 W h L−1).
As demonstrated in Table 6, hybridizing the G-NMs-based electrodes from heteroatoms doping results in a boost in the charge carrier numbers following both n-type and p-type doping, leading to an increase in the conductivity. The increased electrical conductivity encourages electron transport inside the G-NMs-based electrodes, which increases the capacitance performance of the h-G electrodes. Doping heteroatoms into the G-NSs could provide a number of additional benefits, including the increase in Cp, changes in surface active sites, and changes in surface morphology, all of which could improve the electrochemical capacitance of the h-G electrodes. In recent years, h-G NSs have been used as superconductive frameworks to load pseudocapacitive species (for instance, MOs) in order to push the electrochemical capacitance and energy density of the SCs to even superior levels due to improvements in electrical conductivity and surface active sites within the G-NSs.559

4.1.2.3. Hybridized graphene with improved pseudocapacitance. 
The MOs and conducting polymers are the two primary groups that can produce the Cp in general. In SCs applications, MOs, especially TMOs, are commonly hybridized into the G-NSs. By interacting with electrolyte ions produced by redox processes, they provide pseudocapacitance to the electrode system. An NC with high conductivity, specific capacitance, and outstanding cyclic stability is produced by the synergistic combination of G and TMOs. The applications for these hybrid NCs in SC devices are crucial. A 3D-NCs of the G-NMs-wrapped CuCo2O4 hollow spherical electrodes with large SSA and nanopores was reported by Kaverlavani et al.,568 and this NCs produced an extremely high capacitance of about 1813 F g−1 at 2 A g−1. In GW-CuCo2O4/rGO asymmetric arrangement, they also attained a superior energy density of 45.2 W h kg−1 and a power density of up to 15 kW kg−1. In a 3 V symmetric gel SC, Jadhav et al.569 evenly disseminated MnO2 nanorods across the G-NMs using an in situ hydrothermal technique, yielding an energy density of about 64.6 W h kg−1 and a high power density of up to 15 kW kg−1. MnO2 is a very useful pseudocapacitive material among MOs, and was broadly studied in PCs electrode applications due to its high theoretical capacitance, abundant nature, and environment friendliness. It is also one of the most broadly used MOs in SC applications. Mn-oxides/G with reasonable SC performance have been reported by Annamalai et al.,570 Beyazay et al.,571 and Liu et al.,572 highlighting the potential of MnOx/G-NMs as a desired electrode system.
The weak electrical conductivity and cyclic stability of MnO2, on the other hand, severely limit its use as high-capacitance electrodes.509 As a result, despite the theoretical capacitance of MnO2 being as high as 1100 F g−1,573 fabricating MnO2 electrodes with the capacitance exceeding half of its theoretical value remains a tremendous difficulty. It was suggested that nanoscale MnO2 might provide larger surface-active sites for redox reactions; however, pure nanoMnO2 could be quickly degraded during the redox reactions, implying poor cycle stability. As a result, anchoring nanoMnO2 atop highly conductive G-NSs might effectively improve the electrical conductivity of MnO2 while also improving the hybrid electrode cycle stability. Due to the presence of Cp, the insertion of MnO2 into the G-based electrodes might greatly improve the capacitance value when compared to pure graphene electrodes. To acquire the increased capacitance of MnO2, nano-MnO2 with various morphologies has been hybridized with G-NMs either before the creation of G-NMs (pre-MnO2 hybridization) or by controlled deposition onto the formed G-NMs surfaces (post-MnO2 hybridization). Chen et al.574 for example, suggested using a simple co-precipitation approach to prepare nano-MnO2 with various crystallographic forms and morphologies (nanoneedles, nanorods, and nanospindles) (eqn (10)). 3MnCl2 + 2KMnO + 2H2O → 5MnO2 + 2KCl + 4HCl(10)The capacitance of MnO2 with nanoneedle forms was found to be greater. Later, Kim et al.575 hybridized the nano-MnO2 generated using this technique with G-NSs and found that using OCFGs as anchor sites, pre-MnO2 hybridization with GO, followed by a chemical reduction procedure, could form a homogenous allocate over G-NMs. Pang et al.576 changed this simple co-precipitation technique in 2015 by injecting alkali species into the solution, resulting in a simple reaction that occurred at ambient temperature rather than requiring heating to reflux. The G/MnO2 that resulted from tweaking the feeding ratio has a high specific capacitance of 367 F g−1, compared to 327.5 F g−1 in Kim's study.575 This simple technique, however, hampered the capacity to precisely regulate the shape and size of the synthesized MnO2 particles since the resulting MnO2 particles were often larger in size and suffered from local aggregation (Fig. 14(a)). As a result, the available SSAs of the G-NMs and MnO2 have not been fully used. Furthermore, using this method, the synthesis of MnO2 h-G often needed two steps—GO reduction and MnO2 synthesis—resulting in restricted G/nanoMnO2 production efficiency.

Singu et al.577 studied a one-step easy method to generate rGO–MnO2–NCs in 2017 to simplify the production of G/nanoMnO2 hybrid electrodes (Fig. 14(b)). Nano-MnO2 particles were progressively deposited onto G-NSs by a stoichiometric reaction (eqn (11)) in acid conditions, whereas OCFGs on GO-NSs were thermally removed. 4KMnO + 3C + 2H2SO4 → 4MnO + 2K2SO4 + 3CO2 + 2H2O(11)In comparison to the two-step production and mixing techniques, this one-pot etching approach delivered a more homogenous distribution of nano-MnO2 onto G-NMs (Fig. 14(c)). Thus, from a 3-electrode arrangement, the resultant hybrid electrode had a high energy density of 25.7 W h kg−1 and retained 87.5% capacitance after 5000 rapid charge–discharge cycles. The reported power performance of these one-pot derived electrodes, on the other hand, was moderate, limiting their potential usage in real SC devices. The electrochemical deposition of MnO2 particles onto G-NSs has been described in the manufacture of MnO2@h-G electrodes, in addition to the widely-explored chemical synthesis techniques for MnO2.
El-Kady et al.578 reported in 2015 that MnO2-induced capacitance might be very effective when placed upon highly conductive and highly porous laser-scribed G (LSG) foams (Fig. 14(d–f)). The mass loading of nanoflower-shaped MnO2 could be accurately and simply regulated by modulating the deposition current and duration, which was a unique benefit of the electrochemical deposition manufacturing technique. Based only on the active materials, an ultrahigh capacitance of over 1100 F cm−3 was produced from the LSG-MnO2 hybrid film. This resulted in a capacitance of 1145 F g−1 for the ingredient MnO2 (Fig. 14(g)), which is close to the predicted value of MnO2. The stack capacitance of the LSG/MnO2-based SC greatly outperformed commercially available AC SC, PCs, and Li-ion hybrid capacitors when evaluated at the whole-device scale (Fig. 14(h)), providing a viable approach toward a high-energy and high-power MnO2 h-G SC device. This superior G/MnO2 hybrid electrode in aqueous electrolytes is heavily required for high rate/energy density SCs. Several criteria must be met in order to achieve the desired results.
(1) High conductivity and accessibility SSA of graphene frameworks;
(2) Homogeneous distribution of pseudocapacitive-active nano-MnO2 onto graphene; and
(3) Firm G/MnO2 bonding in hybrid electrodes to ensure hybridization stability.
Although G/MnO2 has been hailed as a promising electrode material for high-capacitance SCs in recent studies, issues, for instance, low bonding strength and poor stability, have been highlighted and remain unsolved. Lv et al.579 published a hybrid system consisting of CQDs, MnO2, and GAs in 2018. The 3D net-structured MnO2/CQDs/Gas-based NCs electrodes with large SSA and abundant electron pathways due to the connection function of CQDs indicated superior rate capability of 89.2% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1 and remarkable cycle stability of 92.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1. A good energy density of 38.2 W h kg−1 was observed when constructed into an SSC device, equaling a power density of 1 kW kg−1.
Liu et al.580 recently showed the direct deposition of MnO2 on G-like C-NSs (G-CNs) using a simple hydrothermal process after the interaction between C and KMnO4. The generated MnO2 was evenly deposited atop G-CN NSs in an LBL-stacked structure, giving a high SSA for charge storage and additional ion-transport routes. Fast charge transfer was achieved within the hybrid graphene electrode due to its outstanding conductivity (711 S m−1), resulting in high-rate performance of the produced electrodes. In 1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte, high capacitance of 438 F g−1 was achieved due to the synergistic impact of G-CNs and MnO2. This improved electrode was then combined into an aSSC device for practical use, achieving a high energy density of 50.2 W h kg−1 and a high power density of 26.1 kW kg−1 at the same time. Despite the widespread usage of MnO2, Ni, Mo, Fe, and other valence-stated Mn-based oxides–hydroxides have also been extensively investigated to introduce Cp into the G-based electrodes. However, combining the aforementioned materials with G-NMs-based electrodes at a cheap cost and with ease remains a challenge. Furthermore, while extensive research has demonstrated high capacitance based on active materials from a single electrode, device-scale advances in capacitance and energy density have not been thoroughly examined.
In the single-step manufacture of MOs-h-G electrodes with outstanding electrochemical performances, simple and easy light-assisted manufacturing procedures offer distinct benefits. In 2017, Hwang et al.581 suggested using a simple laser scribing process to fabricate the LSG/Fe3O4 electrodes in a single step. During laser irradiation, the reduction of GO to LSG and the oxidation of FeCl3 to Fe3O4 were accomplished concurrently. The LSG/Fe3O4 displayed exceptional specific capacitance of ∼691 F g−1 due to the introduction of Cp, which greatly surpasses the theoretical limit of pure-G. With a cell voltage of 1.8 V and two-electrode SC devices, an unusually high energy density of 121 W h kg−1 was attained in aqueous electrolyte. Conducting polymers have been shown to be pseudocapacitive electrode materials, including polypyrrole (PPy), polyacetylene (PAc), PANI, and PEDOT:PSS, among others. A doping process might be characterized as the interactions between conductive polymers and electrolyte ions. To preserve charge neutrality, doping is a reversible procedure that turns the backbone of conductive polymers into positive (p-doping) or negative charge carriers (n-doping). Conductive polymers are less expensive and have greater mechanical strength than MOs. However, substantial cycling stability issues resulting from instable chemical structures caused by swelling and shrinking during charging and discharging cycles prevent conductive polymers from being used in real SCs systems. Furthermore, due to their compact shape, the crosslinking nature of conductive polymers may limit the interaction of electrolyte ions with electrode surfaces. Because of the synergistic effects, combining conductive polymers with G-NMs might greatly increase the cycle stability of the conductive polymers as well as the overall energy storage performance.
In 2017, Mao et al.582 demonstrated the preparation of PEDOT/rGO NCs for SC electrodes using a simple electrochemical polymerization and laser reduction procedure. The suggested synthetic technique allowed for the creation of a crumpled NF network structure of the rGO set in a granular PEDOT polymer matrix, resulting in wide open regions between the electrode and the electrolyte for improved interfacial interactions. The laser-scribed rGO placed on the PEDOT considerably enhanced the mechanical properties of PEDOT as a buffer material, and efficiently prevented PEDOT wrinkling and shrinking during charging and discharging. After 1000 charge–discharge cycles, the capacitance retention was increased to 83.6% due to the synergistic effect, up from 74.2% for pure rGO and 60.8% for pure PEDOT. Furthermore, with an energy density of roughly 0.0067 W h cm−2, the capacitance of the as-derived PEDOT/rGO electrodes was found to be nearly three times greater than that of pure PEDOT. Recent research has succeeded in producing hybrid graphene/polymer/MO electrodes to further increase the impact of Cp in order to obtain higher-quality h-G electrodes. Zhou et al.,583 for example, presented a 3D rGO/MnO2/PPy ternary film electrode using a simple repeating filtering process. Under a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, the freestanding and flexible hybrid film has a specific capacitance of 682 F g−1, which is much higher than that of pure PPy (410 F g−1), MnO2 (125 F g−1), and rGO electrodes (225 F g−1). The LBL-filtrated films of the rGO and pre-mixed MnO2 + PPy NCs could improve the electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated electrodes even more than LBL rGO/MnO2/PPy films because the MnO2 + PPy hybrid NPs effectively prevent the rGO-NSs from restacking and successfully hinder the agglomeration of each component. In comparison to pure MnO2 and PPy electrodes, the hybrid electrodes showed a considerable improvement in the cycle stability. Although the introduction of Cp from conductive polymers has been reported to increase the capacitance and energy density, high power density SC devices are still difficult to obtain. This might be owing to the polymers' compact crosslinking nature, which inhibits ion dispersion and transport inside the electrodes. Conducive polymers, on the other hand, are often mechanically robust, flexible, and lightweight, indicating their special promise in thin-film or fiber-like SC devices with excellent flexibility. For example, Chen et al.584 showed a simple and scalable method for making flexible and binder-free C-NF yarn@polypyrrole@rGO (CNY@PPy@rGO) core-shell fiber electrodes for high-performance SCs in 2018. The rGO shell served as a physical buffering layer and bundled CNY@PPy fiber together to promote electrical conductivity and cycle stability. The PPy coating atop CNY fibers provided Cp and increased the electrode's flexibility, and as a consequence, an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 80.46 F cm−3 was achieved, which retained nearly 100% of its initial capacitance at bending angles ranging from 0° to 90°. The C-spacers, conductors/heteroatoms, and pseudocapacitive materials have been used to create h-G with increased SSA, higher electrical conductivity, and improved capacitance. It is worth noting that certain hybridization strategies may offer synergistic benefits in terms of system performance. Hybridizing the G-NMs with CQDs, for example, aims to increase the SSA while simultaneously introducing Cp into graphene electrodes due to the surface-active sites on CQDs. To increase interlayer electrical conductivity, nanosilver conductors are hybridized between G-NSs, and redox processes are used to introduce Cp and improve the capacitance performance. The interlayer spacing between neighboring G-NSs would likewise rise as a result of the hybridization with noble metal conductors and MOs.
A lot of research has been done on iron oxides and their derivatives as SC electrodes. Different hybrids of FeOx with G-NMs have been examined by Zhu et al.,585 Bhujel et al.,586 Chodankar et al.,587 and Ghaly et al.588 They all reported a high E-P density. As an electroactive component for SCs, rare-earth metal oxides and layered double hydroxides are being investigated. In order to increase the rGO's effective conductive surface and permit satisfactory performance in small current EDLC SC, Zhang et al.589 recently deposited La2O3 on rGO. By adopting an A-SC configuration with an NiCoFe-LDHS anode and an Fe2O3/rGO cathode, Pourfarzad et al.590 observed extremely high energy and power densities of about 101 W h kg−1 and 91 kW kg−1 as well as high cyclic stability of 82.5% after 5000 cycles. ZnO@NiCo LDH on a 3D G-scaffold was reported by Patil et al.591 to have higher cycle stability. In a symmetric device arrangement, ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3/N-IC:GA) was reported by Farbod et al.592 to have been coated over a porous matrix of N-doped linked G-As with 98.4% capacitance retention over 4000 cycles.
The promise of TMOs and polymer/G NCs for SC devices is the result of these investigations. By leveraging their inherent pseudocapacitive properties and strong redox potentials, TMOs utilized as active materials provide excellent capacitance in the NC form. Their combination through sturdy connections, which maintains structural deterioration minimally over the electrochemical cycles, is the key to obtaining a respectable performance out of the G/TMO system. The literature that has been addressed above offers fascinating new information on how TMOs contribute to the total NC's increased capacitance. However, one of the unanswered questions is how to explain the system's chemistry, which accounts for the enhanced performance. In other words, the entire electrochemical process of the G/TMO NCs would be made simpler if the intricate architectures and the significance of each structural component in the electrode performance were explained.

5. Summary and outlook
SCs and batteries are a very competitive option for ESDs due to their ultrahigh power density, higher rate capability, long-term cyclability, and incredible safety. Due to their novel properties of high mechanical flexibility, large SSA, chemical stability, and superior electric and thermal conductivities, G-based NMs have received a lot of attention as alternative electrode materials for ESDs. G is gaining popularity because of its excellent features, which include charge mobility of 230000 cm2 V−1 s−1, thermal conductivity of 3000 W−1 m−1 K−1, visible light absorption of 2.3%, mechanical strength of 130 GPa, and SSA of 2600 m2 g−1. Mechanical exfoliation, GO-reduction, CVD, and epitaxial growth of G-NMs are just a few of the synthetic techniques that can alter their properties.
In this study, we look at the latest developments in G-based NM research and development for high-performance and new-concept batteries and SCs for specialized applications in next-generation and smart devices. First, rechargeable batteries, a revolutionary idea with numerous high-voltage and shape-diversity features, are being studied to meet the demands of future devices. The charge storage mechanism was secondly summarized in terms of the high-performance SCs, such as EDLCs and PCs, and their design and fabrication. Finally, the possibilities and problems of G-NM–based electrodes used in ESDs are reviewed briefly.
6. Future aspects
Numerous methods for converting and storing energy have developed quickly during the last several decades. In particular, LIBs, SCs, LSBs, and LABs are among the cutting-edge ESDs that have seen significant advancements due to the addition of G-NMs and its derivatives to conventional active materials. Conventional LIB energy density for battery development can reach 200–250 W h kg−1. In the foreseeable future, it could still be difficult to grow its value significantly. The development of LABs and LSBs resulted in a notable increase in the energy density and a striking decrease in battery cost. Although the theoretical specific energy density of the LABs is said to be 5200 W h kg−1, only a value of 500–900 W h kg−1 can currently be anticipated in practice. The LSBs’ theoretical specific energy density of 2567 W h kg−1 predicts a value of about 600 W h kg−1. The clarification of several fundamental concerns, such as the charge storage mechanism, efficiency of the catalyst, structure–property connection, and others, may lead to further advancements in the practical energy density of these two types of batteries. G's clearly defined 2D structure may hold some information in this regard. For instance, improving the performance appears to be highly dependent on the architecture of the interface between the G-NMs and the sulfur or Li2S species. Previous research has shown that the electrochemical performances are significantly influenced by the size of the sulfur compounds on the G-NSs surface. If we could fine-tune the morphology of the sulfur compounds on the surface of G-NMs, it would be exciting. The construction of various interfaces between G-NSs and nanoscale sulfur material based on various crystal planes may result in more desirable qualities and offer some basic insights into LSBs. To better understand the mechanism of the challenging and perplexing Li–S and Li–O2 systems, theoretical calculations in conjunction with experimental data would also be highly beneficial.
Future 3D structures based on the self-assembly behavior of 2D G-NSs and their subsequent hybridization with active materials (such as metal oxides and metal sulfides) may hold great promise for the design and development of SCs. As a result, the structure has the ability to achieve huge surface areas, rapid mass and electron transport, and customizable pore size and topologies. However, it is still necessary to prevent the G-NSs from restacking while designing the eventual 3D structure. In addition, it will be important in future research to clarify the method by which these 3D structures are formed. Large-scale, inexpensive, and straightforward manufacturing procedures that do not significantly reduce the benefits of G-NM's inherent properties are always preferred in practical applications. As mentioned above, microscale G-NM–based SCs are ready to be commercialized in flexible electronics such as roll-up displays and TVs, e-paper, and even wearable electronics. This is due to the microfabrication techniques that keep up with the miniaturization trend in the current portable electronics market.
The most difficult obstacles for SCs in the industry are their low energy density and the cost-to-performance issue. To achieve the desired performance, the problem of low energy density may be efficiently overcome by hybridizing the electrode materials into diverse structural compositions. Many intriguing conformations and functionalized structures have been added to the realm of G-NM-based SC. G-NM's primary qualities of high SSA and inherent capacitance, superior conductivity, low resistivity, and outstanding mechanical stability make it a promising contender for flexible, smart, and potentially wearable high-performance SC devices. However, certain essential mechanisms must still be properly stated to avoid discrepancies, such as standardizing the methods for the lab to pilot scale synthesis of diverse structures. For a better understanding of the electrochemical behavior of the designed electrodes, the “black-box” zone between structure and ultimate performance must be revealed. The following are some more serious issues that require immediate action.
(I) Facile preparation and procedure unification to manufacture high-quality G-NM products with a regulated number of the NSs, surface potential, lateral size, structural defects, conductivity, and unstacking to give a well-ordered electrode structure for SCs and batteries.
(II) Lowering the cost of large-scale production of diverse G-based SC and battery materials with required composition and surface characteristics.
(III) Creating a well-conductive network of G-NMs for use as active electrode materials in various types of SCs and batteries, which will aid in reducing electrode imbalance, thus impacting the performance.
(IV) Increasing the packing density of the G-based NMs while preserving their intrinsic capacitive and flexible properties to achieve high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance for wearable devices.
(V) Rationalizing the design of ESD components such as electrolyte, electrodes, current collector, separators, substrate, and insulating packing since the performance of the SC device is based not only on the electrode but also on the combination of other device characteristics.
(VI) Clearly describing the electrochemical behavior of G-NM-based electrodes in various electrolytes in order to offer a dependable basis for response mechanism so that the “black box” can be revealed for a breakthrough in continuing research. Long-term possibilities include an unlimited number of demanding problems and opportunities for worldwide researchers to advance basic science at the forefront of this research hotspot.
G-based ESDs unquestionably have the potential to improve our lives in every aspect. It may, however, take some time for them to go from the lab to commercial items and then to cheap consumer products. In practical battery applications, monolayer G-NMs somehow suffers from shortcomings. There is substantial attention to assemble 2D to form 3D porous or hybrid NMs. These 3D G-NM structures might also solve the practical shortcomings of G-NMs ESDs. These are also the main issues in structure characterization. Quick G-NM growth demands the joint hard work of researchers in the respective areas. Advancement can be achieved by considering the catalytic property of G-NM-based materials with different morphologies through both theoretical and experimental characterizations, merging with the introduction of suitable fabrication technology.
We anticipate that this review paper will serve as a beneficial foundation for future research foci, not only in ESD electrode materials but also in the multidisciplinary domains of other renewable energy conversion devices. Overall, the research issues in this review article will undoubtedly be overcome with unwavering dedication and huge efforts from a varied range of scientific groups and various industrial sectors.
