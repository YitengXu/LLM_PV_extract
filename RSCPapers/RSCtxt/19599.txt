    , Accepted 19th January 2015First published on 21st January 2015AbstractThe electronic structures, optical properties and hole mobilities of 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine and its five derivatives are investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of all molecules is almost fully delocalized throughout the whole molecule, and the substituents –N(CH3)2 and –C6H5 denoted as molecules 6 and 2, respectively, have the largest contribution to the HOMO, which is favorable for hole transfer integral and hole mobility. Spectrum analysis indicates that all molecules have large Stokes shifts based on absorption and emission spectra. In addition, it is found that the hole reorganization energy of all molecules is about 0.5 times compared to that of electrons, which implies that hole mobility is bigger than electron mobility. On the basis of predicted packing motifs, the hole mobilities (u) of all molecules are also obtained. The largest hole mobility of molecule 2 (0.1063 cm2 V−1 s−1) is found to be higher than that of other molecules due to the face-to-face stacking mode, which suggests that –C6H5 is a good substituent group for improving hole mobility compared to other electron releasing groups. We hope that our results will be helpful for the further rational molecular design and synthesis of novel hole transport materials (HTMs) for high performance perovskite-type solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have received increasing attention beginning with their incorporation as sensitizers into dye-sensitized solar cells by Miyasaka et al. in 2009.1 A significant efficiency of 3.81% was obtained from CH3NH3PbI3 with a photocurrent onset of ∼800 nm. This work opened a new frontier in the development of solar energy harvesting technologies. The perovskite-type solar cells represent a new class of electrochemical solar cells based on sensitized mesoporous TiO2 and a liquid electrolyte in a sandwich-like architecture. In 2011, N. G. Park and coworkers2 obtained an efficiency of 6.54% through a careful optimization of the mesoporous layer thickness, perovskite concentration and surface treatment. Despite the efficiencies achieved in such configurations, the overall instability of the solar cells due to the dissolution of the perovskite in the liquid electrolyte appeared to be a challenge. In 2012, N. G. Park, M. Grätzel and H. J. Snaith3,4 achieved a breakthrough in both efficiency and stability through utilization of a solid-state hole transporter 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-p-dimethoxy-phenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) with CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx light absorbers. Extremely rapid progress was made during 2013 with energy conversion efficiencies reaching a confirmed 16.2% by using the mixed-halide CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (10−15% Br) and a poly-triarylamine HTM (S. I. Seok, personal communication) at the end of the year. In early 2014, an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.7% was obtained based on mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au solar cells, and the PCE is the highest value reported for perovskite-based solar cells to date with spiro-OMeTAD.5
To date, perovskite-type solar cells with and without HTMs have been developed. The perovskite solar cells without HTMs exhibit a PCE of just over 10%.6 This is because HTMs play a key role in hole-transportation and retardation of charge recombination. So far, typical HTMs have spiro-OMeTAD, poly-triarylamine (PTAA), and poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and so on. Although spiro-OMeTAD continues to be the best performing candidate for HTMs, the high cost of spiro-OMeTAD impedes the growth and advancement of high efficiency cost-effective perovskite solar cells. So, it is important and urgent to study the mechanism of hole transport and develop new HTMs with good hole mobility, a compatible HOMO energy level relative to organolead halide perovskites and low cost for commercialization from experimental and theoretical perspectives. Recently, some excellent HTMs have been synthesized and characterized. Prof. Xudong Yang and coworkers synthesized tetrathiafulvalene (TTF-1), and compared to cells on the well-known doping spiro-OMeTAD, perovskite solar cells based on dopant-free TTF-1 gave a comparable efficiency of 11.03%.7 Prof. Mohammad Khaja Nazeeruddin's group designed and synthesized a new HTM called Fused-F in their paper, and the device based on this new material achieved a high PCE of 12.8% under the illumination of 98.8 mW cm−1, which was better than the well-known spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions.8 Prof. Subodh G. Mhaisalkar's group also synthesized three novel new hole-conducting molecules (called T101, T102, and T103) based on a triptycene core, and the mesoporous perovskite solar cells fabricated using T102 and T103 as the HTMs showed PCEs of 12.24% and 12.38%, respectively, which are comparable to that obtained using the best performing HTM spiro-OMeTAD.9 Two new triphenylamine-based HTMs were employed in CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells, and a PCE of 11.63% was achieved by the Qingbo Meng group,10 and their typical advantages are easy synthesis, low cost and a relatively good cell performance, which indicated that 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine (Fig. 1, named (1)) is an excellent parent molecule for HTMs. To our knowledge, although a large number of experimental studies have been performed on new HTMs, no theoretical study on HTMs based on perovskite solar cells has been reported to date.

As is well known, triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives have been widely used in HTMs because of their efficient hole mobilities. In the present study, different electron releasing substituent groups (–C6H5, –CH3, –OH, –OCH3, and –N(CH3)2) are introduced into the 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine skeleton to design some new potential HTMs (see Fig. 1). We focus on the effects of different donor groups on molecular orbitals, absorption and emission properties, and hole transport behavior in order to obtain excellent HTMs with high hole mobility to further develop efficient perovskite-type solar cells. The structural, electronic and optical properties, and hole transport properties of these new HTMs are first predicted and characterized by density functional theory (DFT). We hope that the results will be useful for the synthesis study and reasonable design of high performance HTMs with high hole mobility, and also hope that it will be applied to organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells.
2. Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to optimize the ground state based B3LYP functional with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set, which can provide a more accurate description of neutral states in extended π-conjugated systems.11 All optimized geometries show no imaginary frequency, which ensures energetic minima. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software package.12 The absorption spectra and corresponding excitation energies were evaluated using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) based on the Coulomb-attenuating method CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p).13 The solvent effects were also taken into consideration here using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) with the dielectric constants of chlorobenzene (ε = 5.6968).
There are mainly two mechanisms describing carrier transport in organic semiconductors, namely, the band model and the hopping model.14,15 In inorganic semiconductors, charge transport is governed by the energy band, due to strong covalent interactions. However, in many cases, the charge transport of organic semiconductors can be well described by the thermally activated hopping and diffusion model since they have weak intermolecular electronic coupling (reorganization energy > transfer integral).16–20 So in this study, we deal with the charge transport process by the semi-classical Marcus theory,21 and the charge hopping rate (k) is expressed as (1)where v is the transfer integral, λ is the reorganization energy, h is the Planck constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and kB is the Boltzmann constant, respectively.
In general, λ can be estimated by the adiabatic potential energy surface approach.22,23 λ = λ0 + λ± = (E0* − E0) + (E±* − E±)(2)E0 and E± respectively represent the energies of neutral and charged species in their lowest energy geometries, while E0* and E±* are respectively the energies of the neutral molecule with a charged geometry and a charged molecule with the ground state geometry.
To achieve high carrier mobility, λ needs to be minimized, and v needs to be maximized. v, which measures the strength of electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor states, depends on the relative arrangement of the molecule in the solid state.24 In this work, we adopt a direct approach to investigate the charge transport properties,25,26 which can be written as V = 〈ΨHOMO/LUMOi|F|ΨHOMO/LUMOf〉(3)where F is the Fock operator, Ψi and Ψf represent the frontier orbitals of molecules 1 and 2 respectively in the dimer. The superscripts denote the frontier orbitals in which the charge hopping occurs, which are mostly at the HOMO level for holes and the LUMO level for electrons.
Assuming a Brownian motion of a charge carrier in the absence of the applied electric field, electron mobility can be calculated from the diffusion coefficient D with the Einstein equation.27 (4)where e is the charge, D is the diffusion coefficient which can be approximately evaluated as28 (5)where i is a given transfer pathway and ri represents the charge hopping centroid to the centroid distance, d is taken as 3 since the diffusion is regarded in three dimensions for compounds investigated and  is the relative probability for charge hopping to the ith pathway.
Crystal structure prediction was performed for molecules 1–6 by using the polymorph predictor module in Materials Studio,29 a single molecule was optimized by the DMol3 module and electrostatic potential charges of all atoms were obtained. Then the crystal structure prediction was carried out by employing the PBE functional and the Dreiding force field,30 which was considered to be more appropriate force field for molecular crystal prediction.31 For molecules 1–6, the polymorph predictor calculations are restricted to the five most probable space groups, P21/C, P1, P212121, P21, and P.32 We sorted the obtained crystal structures in terms of their total energies. Finally, crystal structures of molecules 1–6 with the lowest energies were selected for further DFT calculations on their hole mobilities.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Frontier molecular orbital
It is useful to examine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of molecules under investigation. The FMO is one of the key factors to illustrate the carrier transport properties, and the calculated FMOs of molecules 1–6 are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 indicates that both the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) possess π features. The HOMOs of molecules 1–5 spread over the whole molecule, while the HOMO of molecule 6 is localized on the phenylamine unit. The LUMOs of molecules 1, 2, 4–6 mainly localize at the 4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadienyl unit, while the LUMO of molecule 3 mostly distributes on the phenylamine unit. In other words, their HOMOs are almost fully delocalized while their LUMOs are not fully delocalized throughout the whole molecule. The good HOMO delocalization is favorable for hole transport and hole transfer integral. The result of FMO analysis suggests that all of the six molecules have good hole transport properties, and they are potential candidates as HTMs.

Another way to understand the influence of the electronic properties is to analyze the HOMO energy (EHOMO), LUMO energy (ELUMO) and energy gap (ΔH–L) values. Here, our calculated ΔH–L is the orbital energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO. The calculated and experimental data are listed in Table 1. From Table 1, we can see that the calculated EHOMO of 3 and 4 are −4.76 and −4.65 eV, respectively, while the corresponding experimental values are −5.35 and −5.23 eV. This result suggests that although we cannot obtain accurate EHOMO by DFT, the changing trend between calculated and experimental values of EHOMO is consistent. Moreover, the same trend can also be found in ELUMO and ΔH–L. The contrast results show that our calculation method is reliable. From Table 1, it is clear that EHOMO is in the order of 6 = 4 > 5 > 3 > 2 > 1, the sequence of ELUMO is 6 > 5 = 4 > 1 > 3 > 2. Thus, one can conclude that the compounds with stronger donor groups (–OCH3, OH, and –N(CH3)2) have higher EHOMO and ELUMO compared to compounds with weaker donor groups (–H, –C6H5, and –CH3). The sequence of ΔH–L is 1 > 6 > 2 = 3 > 5 > 4. These results indicate that EHOMO, ELUMO, and ΔH–L are affected by the introduction of different donor groups to 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine.

To further study the substituent effect, the contribution of substituent groups to the HOMO and the LUMO of the six molecules is further analyzed and relevant data are also listed in Table 1. From Table 1, we can see that substituents –N(CH3)2 and –C6H5 have the largest contribution to the HOMO and the LUMO, respectively, and H has the smallest contribution to the HOMO and the LUMO among all substituent groups. The sequence of the contribution value to the HOMO is –N(CH3)2 > –C6H5 > –OCH3 > –OH > –CH3 > H and the LUMO is in the order of –C6H5 > –N(CH3)2 > –OCH3 > –OH > –CH3 > H. These results also indicate that the stronger the electron-donating ability, the bigger contribution to the HOMO and the LUMO. Otherwise, it is also found that the contribution of substituent groups to the HOMO is much bigger than that of the LUMO. Therefore, it is clear that substitution of 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine with an electron-donating substituent makes the molecule more effective in hole transport than electron transport.
3.2 Absorption spectrum and the Stokes shift
To gain an insight into the electronic transition and excitation properties, the absorption and emission properties were characterized using the CAM-TD-B3LYP method on the optimized ground and excited state geometries, respectively. The solvent effect for the investigated system was considered in this work. Fig. 3 shows the absorption spectrum. The absorption wavelengths (λabs) and emission wavelengths (λem) of molecules 1–6 are listed in Table 2. The λabs of molecules 1–6 are 381, 384, 384, 387, 387, and 397 nm, respectively, corresponding to the dominant transition from the HOMO to the LUMO (1: 88%, 2: 83%, 3: 86%, 4: 83%, 5: 84%, 6: 75%). The trend of the λabs value is 6 > 5 = 4 > 3 = 2 > 1, the λabs of molecules 2–6 have slight bathochromic shifts compared to that of 1. In other words, the stronger the electron-donating ability, the larger the λabs of the molecule. For all molecules, the π–π* transition feature around 380–400 nm is presented. It can be seen from Table 2 that molecules 2–6 have larger oscillator strengths than molecule 1. The sequence is 2 > 6 > 4 > 5 > 3 > 1. fabs strength for an electronic transition is proportional to the transition dipole moment. The results show that molecules 2–6 have larger absorption intensity than molecule 1.

The λem of molecules 1–6 are 490, 488, 487, 479, 480, and 474 nm, respectively, which indicates that λem of molecules 2–6 are slightly blue shifted compared to that of molecule 1, the deviations are 2, 3, 11, 10, and 16 nm, respectively. In addition, it is also found that the emission spectra of molecules 1–6 show large Stokes shifts of 109, 104, 103, 92, 93, and 97 nm, respectively. Prof. Mhaisalkar and Grimsdale anticipated that the large Stokes shift, lower glass transition temperature and smaller molecule size versus spiro-OMeTAD would be synergistically beneficial to the infiltration and pore-filling of a hole-transporting material for perovskite-type solar cells by simple annealing or light soaking post-treatment.33 The large Stokes shift reflects a big structural difference between ground and excited states of the molecule, which indicates that the molecule may be flexible. Perhaps it is beneficial for pore-filling of a hole-transporting material. For this reason we conjecture that molecules 1–3 are more favorable for improving power conversion efficiency than 4–6.
3.3 Reorganization energy, electron affinity, and ionization potential
Reorganization energy is one of the key parameters to determine the carrier hopping rate. It comes from the contributions of external reorganization energy and internal reorganization energy. As is known that the external reorganization energy is significantly lower than that of the inner part based on a polarized force field calculation,34 the external part is not considered in this research. The calculated reorganization energies for holes and electrons are listed in Table 3. From Table 3, we can find that the λh of molecules 1–6 (1: 0.14 eV, 2: 0.12 eV, 3: 0.12 eV, 4: 0.10 eV, 5: 0.10 eV, 6: 0.16 eV) are much smaller than that of a typical hole transport material N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TPD) with λh = 0.29 eV. This means that their hole transfer rate should be higher than that of TPD, thus molecules 1–6 could be good hole transfer materials, in addition, for 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine with an electron releasing group, the substituent effect for reorganization energy has the following order: 6 > 1 > 2 = 3 > 4 = 5. This shows that the λh values of molecules 1–5 are decreasing with the increase of electron-donating ability of substituent groups. But molecule 6 is a particular case, although it contains the substituent group with the strongest electron-donating ability, it has the biggest λh among all molecules. The reason may be that the nitrogen atom is more electronegative than oxygen and carbon atoms and the lone pair electrons of the nitrogen atom are undesirable for the stability of molecule 6 in neutral and charged species in their lowest energy geometries. For λe, it is found that the effect of the substituent is not pronounced, and the λh of all molecules are bigger than λe, which implies that the hole mobility is larger than the electron mobility.

The stability is also a useful criterion to evaluate the nature of devices for carrier transport materials. To our knowledge, the adiabatic ionization potential (IPa) is directly relevant to the stability of p-type materials. From the IPa given in Table 3, molecule 1 (4.77 eV) has the biggest IPa value and 6 (4.25 eV) has the smallest IPa value compared with other four molecules. Additionally, the IPa values of molecules 1–6 decrease as the electron-donating ability increases. Furthermore, the absolute hardness (η) also has been calculated using operational definition35,36 given by: η = (IP − EA)/2. η is the resistance of the chemical potential to the change in the number of electrons. The η values of all molecules are also listed in Table 3. From Table 3 we can conclude that molecules 1–5 have similar stability, while 6 has the smallest η value, which indicates that molecule 6 has the lowest stability among all molecules.
3.4 Exciton binding energies and hole mobilities
To achieve high efficiencies, the bound electron–hole pairs should be dissociated into the fully separated positive and negative charges to escape from the Coulomb attraction. It is directly related to the charge separation in solar cells. The exciton binding energy (Eb) is defined as the potential energy difference between the neutral singlet exciton and two free charge carriers, and it can be expressed as37,38Eb = Eg − Ex = ΔH–L − E1. Eg is the electronic band gap and can be replaced by the energy gap (ΔH–L), and Ex is the optical gap and is generally defined as the first singlet excitation energy (E1). The relevant data are listed in Table 4. From Table 4, we can see that the trend of Eb is 1 > 2 = 3 > 5 > 4 > 6, and this shows that the stronger the electron-donating ability, the easier the separation of electron–hole pairs from Coulomb attraction. From the value of Eb, we can conjecture that introduction of electron releasing groups can efficiently improve carrier (hole and electron) mobility.

The calculated crystal structures of all molecules with the total energies belong to space groups P21/C. Thus, we predict the hole mobilities of molecules 1–6 in P21/C. Recently, Hui-xue Li and coworkers16 have verified the reliability of the predicted crystal structures by comparing experimental crystal structures. Their results show that the predicted packing structure is the same with dinaphtho-tetrathiafulvalene (DN-TTF) except for the volume and density of the unit cell. So we think that the method of predicting crystal structures is reliable for molecules 1–6. We arbitrarily choose one molecule in the crystal as the carrier donor and take all its neighboring molecules as paired elements. Each pair is defined as a transmission path. Fig. 4 shows the most important pathways. Here, we neglected some pathways with transfer integrals less than 1 meV, which make little contribution to mobility. Transfer integral is important for determining charge carrier mobility. It represents the orbital coupling of the neighboring molecules. The value of transfer integrals is also dependent on the relative position of interacting molecules and their FMO distribution patterns.39 The M06-2X functional is a high nonlocality functional with double the amount of nonlocal exchange (2X), and it is parametrized only for nonmetals. Donald G. Truhlar has pointed out that M06-2X is the best functional for noncovalent interactions by comparing 12 other functionals and Hartree–Fock theory.40 In addition, Zhong-Min Su also proved that M06-2X/6-31G(d,p) can provide a better description of the non-covalent interaction than the PW91PW91 functional.41 Thus, the M06-2X functional was employed to calculate the transfer integrals of all hopping pathways based on the direct coupling approach. By combining the Marcus formula with the Einstein relation, the hole mobilities of molecules 1–6 based on their crystal structures are obtained. The centroid to centroid distance of the dimer, the hole transfer integrals, hole hopping rates, and hole mobilities of the main hopping pathway are listed in Table 5. From the u of molecules 3 and 4 given in Table 5, it is found that the calculated u (the calculated u of molecules 3 and 4 are 0.0600 and 0.0483 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.) has the same trend as experimental (the experimental u of molecules 3 and 4 are 2.98 × 10−3 and 1.27 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively), which indicates that it is reliable to have a qualitative comparison between the experimental values and the theoretical results at the present theoretical level. It is worth noting that the theoretical method we used to describe charge transport is based on some sound approximations and assumptions, so the accurate absolute hole mobility is not the aim of this work. Importantly, the aim of this work is to reveal the structure–property relationship and look for excellent HTMs with high hole mobility to further develop efficient perovskite-type solar cells. From Table 5, we can find that molecule 2 has the biggest hole mobility (0.1063 cm2 V−1 s−1) due to the large hole transfer integral and hole hopping rate, which are favorable for obtaining high performance carrier transport materials, and the face-to-face stacking also increases the effective π-orbital overlap and enhances the hole mobility between conjugated molecules. Molecule 6 has the smallest hole mobility (0.0011 cm2 V−1 s−1). Prof. Snaith and Grätzel pointed out that the HTMs containing a N atom have low hole mobility due to the sp3 hybridization of the N atom; the inherent triangular pyramid configuration leads to a large intermolecular distance, and therefore suffer from low hole mobility, low conductivity, or both in their pristine form.42,43 However, our results show that the intermolecular distance of molecule 6 is shortest, except for pathways 2 and 4 of molecule 5, among all molecules. So, we conjecture that the low hole mobility of molecule 6 originates from two possible reasons: higher reorganization energy and cross packing of the dimer. In addition, it is found that molecules 1 and 4 have similar packing modes leading to a very similar hole mobility. From Fig. 4 and Table 5, we know that among all selected pathways, the largest transfer integral of all investigated systems corresponds to molecule 2 (such as pathway 1) with the slipped π–π packing. This finding further proves the traditional view that the pathway with cofacial π–π packing in general possesses a relatively large transfer integral compared to the other pathway with edge-to-face (such as pathway 4 of molecule 3), edge-to-edge stacking (such as pathways 1 and 3 of molecule 5), or cross packing (such as pathways 1 and 2 of molecule 6). From molecules 1 to 6, the hole mobilities did not show regular changes as the electron-donating ability of the substituent group increased.

As pointed out above, the π–π packing mode of the dimer plays an important role in determining hole mobility, and substituent –C6H5 is a better substituent group for improving hole mobility compared to –OCH3 and –CH3, which are well-known substituent groups experimentally for HTMs. As discussed above, we hope that our results will be helpful for the design of highly efficient HTMs in perovskite-type solar cells.
4. Conclusions
We have presented a theoretical investigation based on DFT and TD-DFT calculations to elucidate the effects of introducing substituents of different electron-donating abilities on the crystal packing and transport properties of 4-(4-phenyl-4-α-naphthylbutadieny)-triphenylamine derivatives. The electronic structures, transfer integrals, reorganization energies, exciton binding energies and hole mobilities are discussed as summarized below.
(1) The FMO analysis results show that they have a similar distribution of the frontier orbitals where the HOMOs are delocalized over the entire molecule while their LUMOs are not fully delocalized throughout the whole molecule, and the stronger the electron-donating ability, the bigger the contribution to the HOMO and the LUMO. Moreover, the electron releasing substituents increase the HOMO and LUMO energies of all molecules.
(2) Spectrum analysis indicates that the λabs of molecules 1–6 correspond to dominant transitions from the HOMO to the LUMO, and all compounds have large Stokes shifts based on absorption and emission spectra.
(3) Moreover, the λh of all molecules are bigger than λe, which implies that the hole mobility is larger than the electron mobility, and we can also find that molecules 1–5 have similar stability, molecule 6 has the lowest stability among all molecules from the viewpoint of absolute hardness.
(4) The hole mobilities of molecules 1–6 in space ground P21/C are 0.0465, 0.1063, 0.0600, 0.0483, 0.0221, and 0.0011 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which indicates that phenyl is an outstanding substituent group for improving hole mobility compared to methoxyl and methyl. And the π–π packing mode plays an important role in determining hole mobility.
We expect that our research findings would give support to researchers who design and develop high performance hole transport materials for perovskite-type solar cells.
