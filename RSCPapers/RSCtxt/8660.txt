    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractTo meet the demand for low-cost, lightweight, portable and building-integrated solar cells, developing flexible and cost-efficient photo-active hybrid films is of significant interest. In this work, we investigate the mechanical properties of hybrid layers consisting of mesoporous TiO2 filled with poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as a function of the number of bending cycles. The TiO2/P3HT layers are deposited on flexible PET substrates at low temperatures (≤140 °C), which is beneficial for reducing the processing energy input and in turn lowering the production costs. Non-filled and partially filled mesoporous titania films are studied for comparison. The surface morphology is examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after the bending tests. The inner film morphology is characterized with grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). Based on the observed morphology, micromechanical models are used to analyze the mechanical properties of the investigated films. The results show that the TiO2/P3HT layers have a low elastic modulus and P3HT helps to stabilize the titania nanostructures against fracture. The SEM observations are well explained with the established models in a quantitative way.
Introduction
Over the last few decades, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as a promising photovoltaic technology for the production of clean energy due to their low-cost, lightweight and ease of production in combination with mechanical flexibility and adaptability to large-scale manufacturing.1–7 Within the endeavor of progress and development, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have recently been pushed to over 14%, which demonstrates their great potential towards practical applications.8,9 However, the inherent drawbacks of shorter lifetimes, as compared to their inorganic counterparts, have so far hindered the implementation of PSCs in commercial applications to a large extent. To overcome this problem, one of the efficient approaches is to substitute fullerene and/or non-fullerene acceptors with inorganic semiconductors.10–12 Inorganic acceptors typically are physically and chemically more stable than polymers, and therefore provide the hybrid devices with high stability of the active layer morphology.13–15 By having additional advantages like improved lifetimes, hybrid solar cells, which combine conjugated polymers with inorganic nanocrystals, have been in the focus of increasing research interest.10–17
The semitransparent nature and tunable colors of hybrid solar cells allow their use in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) and electronics-integrated photovoltaics (EIPVs).18–20 For these applications, flexible devices are also highly desirable. However, conventionally, the transparent electrodes of hybrid solar cells such as indium tin oxide (ITO), silver nanowires and carbon nanotubes are supported by glass sheets, which are heavy, fragile, rigid and inconvenient for use in roll-to-roll production techniques. Replacing the glass support with a flexible plastic one allows the device to be more cost-effective and of lower weight, which is both beneficial for applications in portable and bendable power sources. As a consequence, great efforts have been made for the development of photovoltaics on flexible plastic substrates.21–23 For example, Xue et al. reported flexible solar cells on top of a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) support, using mesoporous TiO2 as an inorganic acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the hole transport material, with a PCE of 1.93%.22 You et al. demonstrated an efficiency of 9.2% in flexible perovskite solar cells using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as the device support.23 Although the practicability of functionalized hybrid solar cells based on flexible plastic supports has been verified in the literature, the aging and failure behavior of hybrid photovoltaics upon bending is only rarely studied and not well understood.
Studying full devices is problematic for a fundamental investigation, as it will be difficult to remove all layers surrounding the active layer of a hybrid solar cell. Therefore, the present work investigates the mechanically induced aging and failure behavior of flexible photo-active layers for hybrid solar cells during bending. The additional layers needed to form the final devices are typically supposed to be more flexible as the hybrid active layers. PET foils are used as flexible supports and the active layers are made of mesoporous titania nanostructures which can be produced with many methods,24–27 filled with P3HT. These active layers require to be deposited on the PET substrates at low temperatures (T < 150 °C) as PET is not heat resistant.21,28 This requirement poses a challenge in device preparation, since a high-temperature calcination step (above 400 °C) is typically needed to produce crystalline, mesoporous titania films.29–32 To address this issue, ethylene glycol-modified titanate (EGMT) is used as the titania precursor in this work because it was reported in previous work that EGMT could directly impart crystallinity to titania during the sol–gel process at low temperatures.33–35 The diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide (PS-b-PEO) is applied as a structure-directing agent, which assists the formation of mesoporous titania nanostructures via a self-assembly process.36,37 The so-called block-copolymer-assisted sol–gel synthesis allows a precise control of the size of the titania nanostructures and mesopores.38–44 The ready-to-use mesoporous titania films are then filled with P3HT to finalize the hybrid layer. The surface and inner layer morphology of the hybrid samples are investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements, respectively. The morphological difference before and after the bending tests are compared to study the failure behavior of the hybrid layers via SEM. In order to obtain quantitative information about the flexibility, the elastic moduli of the investigated samples are determined from models.
Experimental section
Materials
PS-b-PEO (Mn (PS) = 20500 g mol−1, Mn (PEO) = 8000 g mol−1, polydispersity index = 1.02) was purchased from Polymer Source Inc., Canada. EGMT was synthesized according to a method reported in the literature.45,46 P3HT (Mw = 53000 g mol−1, regioregularity = 92%, polydispersity index = 2.3) was obtained from Rieke Metal Inc. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and HCl (12 M) were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
Sample preparation
A diblock copolymer template assisted sol–gel synthesis was used to produce nanostructured titania films. Firstly, PS-b-PEO was dissolved in DMF by vigorous stirring at room temperature for 30 min. Then EGMT was added to the polymer solution, followed by dropwise addition of HCl. Afterwards, the obtained solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, followed by 30 min at 90 °C. The final weight ratio was wDMF:wPS-b-PEO:wEGMT:wHCl = 20:1:1:2. Directly after the sol–gel process, the solution was spin coated (2000 rpm, 30 s) on solid substrates to obtain titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid films prior to an annealing process at 90 °C for 30 min. For GISAXS measurements silicon substrates are used, while PET substrates are taken for the SEM measurements and bending tests. After deposition, the composite films were treated with oxygen plasma (250 W) for 30 min to obtain the partially extracted titania films. Alternatively, the composite films were immersed in a DMF bath at 50 °C for 10 min to completely remove the PS-b-PEO template and to obtain the fully extracted titania films.33 The backfilling process started from pre-soaking of the fully extracted titania films in chlorobenzene for 1 h. This step is essential for P3HT backfilling as it has been proven to increase the filling ratio of P3HT into mesoporous titania films.47 Subsequently, the P3HT solution (20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene) was added dropwise onto the fully extracted titania films (60 s waiting), followed by a spin-coating process (900 rpm for 9 s prior to 2500 rpm for 50 s) under ambient conditions. Finally, the backfilled films were annealed at 140 °C for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent degradation and finalize the ready-to-use hybrid layers.
Film characterization
SEM measurements were carried out using an NVision40 field emission SEM (Carl Zeiss AG). The working distance and accelerating voltage were set to 3 mm and 5 kV, respectively. The GISAXS measurements were performed at the 1W2A beamline of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) in Beijing, China. The X-ray wavelength was 1.54 Å. A grazing incident angle of 0.52° and a sample-to-detector distance of 2.99 m were set for the measurements. The scattering signal was recorded using a Pilatus 1 M detector with a pixel size of 172 μm × 172 μm and a 981 × 1043 pixel array. To protect the detector from oversaturation, both the direct and specular X-ray beams were shielded with a beamstop. The bending measurements were performed using a custom made two-point bending test setup. The used setup is shown in Fig. S1.† The probed sample was mounted between a fixed aluminum block and a moving Teflon block. A rotating disc drove the Teflon block moving back and forth. The rotating speed was set to 18 rpm for the bending test.
Results and discussion
Film morphology
A schematic illustration of the polymer-template extraction and the fabrication of the hybrid layers is depicted in Fig. 1. First, a PS-b-PEO/TiO2 hybrid film is fabricated on a PET substrate via spin coating (Fig. 1a). To obtain mesoporous titania nanostructures, O2 plasma and a solvent bath treatment are used to extract the polymer template at low temperature, resulting in a partially extracted film (Fig. 1b) and a fully extracted film (Fig. 1c), respectively. After a complete removal of the PS-b-PEO by using the solvent bath, the obtained mesoporous titania film is filled with P3HT to achieve the hybrid layer (Fig. 1d).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration: (a) the initial, pristine PS-b-PEO/TiO2 hybrid film is treated with (b) O2 plasma to prepare the partially extracted mesoporous TiO2 film, or with (c) a solvent bath to prepare the fully extracted mesoporous TiO2 film, which is (d) backfilled with P3HT to make the hybrid TiO2/P3HT film. Cyan, yellow, white, and orange indicate TiO2, PS-b-PEO, empty pores, and P3HT, respectively. 

Fig. 2a shows a plan-view SEM image of the titania film with a sponge-like morphology of an interconnected titania network with mesopores after the O2 plasma treatment. The related cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2b) shows a film thickness of about 170 nm. The mesoporous structure is only found at the upper part of the film close to the surface (around 50 nm from the surface), whereas the PS-b-PEO/TiO2 hybrid structures remain at the bottom part of the film. After the O2 plasma treatment the samples are denoted as partially extracted titania films. These samples are regarded as a transition state towards the fully extracted titania films and will be used to investigate how the polymer gradually influences the mechanical properties of mesoporous TiO2. After the solvent bath treatment, the block copolymer is fully removed as seen with SEM in Fig. 2c and d. A mesoporous network structure is observed in the fully extracted titania films with pore sizes from 40 to 60 nm. This size range is beneficial for backfilling with conducting polymers as reported earlier.10,48,49Fig. 2d shows an interconnected mesoporous titania network being present across the sample as well, indicating a complete removal of the polymer template by the solvent bath. In the following, the films after solvent bath treatment are denoted as fully extracted titania films. These fully extracted titania films are backfilled with P3HT via spin coating to achieve the hybrid active layers as they are used in hybrid solar cells. The surface and cross-sectional morphology of such hybrid layers is mapped with SEM as well (Fig. 2e and f). The results demonstrate a rather good infiltration of P3HT into the mesoporous titania films. Moreover, a P3HT overlayer is found on top of the hybrid layer after the backfilling process, which can act as the electron-blocking layer in hybrid solar cells and thereby will be beneficial for the device performance. Moreover, the prepared hybrid layers have a thickness of about 170 nm, which matches well with the optimal thickness of the active layer used in hybrid solar cells (range of 100 nanometers).50–52

Since SEM measurements only provide morphological information on a local scale, GISAXS measurements with a high statistical relevance are performed on the aforementioned samples to gain insights on the inner film morphologies.
This advanced scattering technique allows for characterizing the inner film structures from the micrometer scale down to the nanometer scale by probing samples over macroscopic areas.53–55 In order to achieve good alignment during GISAXS measurements, the samples were prepared on silicon substrates following an identical route. The 2D GISAXS data of the partially extracted titania film, the fully extracted titania film and the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer are displayed in Fig. S2† with a detailed feature description in the ESI.† To obtain quantitative information along the surface normal, vertical line cuts are performed along the qz direction at qy = 0 (Fig. 3a). The specular beam is located at the position of incident angle (αi) + exit angle (αf) = 1.06° and αi being set to 0.53° in the present work. The specular X-ray beam is shielded with a beamstop to protect the detector from oversaturation. Due to the enhanced diffuse scattering by the Fresnel transmission functions at the critical angle of a material, local intensity maxima are observed in the region of αi + αf < 1.06°, which are called Yoneda peaks.56
 Fig. 3  (a) Vertical and (b) horizontal line cuts of the 2D GISAXS data of the partially extracted titania film (blue), fully extracted titania film (green) and TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer (red). All curves are shifted along the y axis for clarity of the presentation. In (a): the positions of the Yoneda peaks of Si (black), PS-b-PEO (yellow), TiO2 (cyan) and P3HT (orange) are marked with arrows, respectively. Detector gaps and the area shielded by a beamstop are shown in gray bars. In (b): the solid black lines are the fits based on a model explained in the text. 
For all vertical line cuts, there are Yoneda peaks located at αi + αf = 0.76°, which are assigned to the contribution from the silicon substrate as silicon has a critical angle (αc) of 0.23° in the present work. For the partially extracted titania film, the Yoneda peak of PS-b-PEO at αi + αf ≈ 0.68° is identified as PS and PEO have a critical angle of 0.15° and 0.16°, respectively. The existence of the PS-b-PEO Yoneda peak confirms the SEM observation of a partial extraction of the polymer template. The inflection point in the vertical line cut of the fully extracted titania film is recognized as the Yoneda peak of mesoporous titania as only titania remains on the substrate after polymer extraction. The absence of the PS-b-PEO Yoneda peak indicates a complete removal of the PS-b-PEO template. From the Yoneda peak position, the porosity of the fully extracted titania film is determined to be (76 ± 3)%, which agrees well with the value of 76% derived from the refractive index of 1.28 from white light interferometry. The detailed calculation of the porosity is provided in the ESI.† The left peak at the vertical line cut of the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer (indicated with the orange arrow) is identified as the P3HT Yoneda peak, as the position matches with the critical angle of P3HT. To obtain information about lateral structures (parallel to the substrate), horizontal line cuts of the 2D GISAXS data are performed at the Yoneda peak position of titania for all samples and displayed in Fig. 3b. For a quantitative analysis, all horizontal line cuts are modeled within the framework of the effective interface approximation of the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA),57,58 assuming three cylindrically shaped scattering objects (form factor) distributed on a one-dimensional paracrystal lattice (structure factor).54,59 The extracted structural length scales are depicted in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† All samples have similar structure sizes and center-to-center distances within the error bars, suggesting that the polymer extraction method and backfilling do not significantly impact the titania nanostructures. Deformation of mesoporous titania nanostructures can be induced during backfilling as reported when using e.g. water or humidity.60,61
Mechanical aging
The partially extracted titania films, the fully extracted titania films and the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layers are subjected to bending tests to study mechanically induced aging. Each type of sample is bent 10, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 times, respectively. In the present work, a two-point bending apparatus is used to periodically apply flexural stress to the films. The used setup is custom made and shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† To determine the bending parameters, a sample is shown in Fig. 4 at the moment of the highest curvature during the bending test. It can be seen that the bending radius (R) is (3.0 ± 0.2) mm, the length of the bent middle region (L) is (6.4 ± 0.5) mm, and the angle between the sample and the vertical (ψ) is (43 ± 2)°. Accordingly, the maximal strain on the bent film (ξmax) is determined to be (2.8 ± 0.2)% following the equation1 introduced by Gulati et al.62 (1)
 Fig. 4  Photo of a sample fixed in the custom-made two-point bending test setup. At the point of the strongest bending of the sample, the spacing between the points of zero curvature (L), the angle between the sample and the vertical (ψ) and the bending radius (R) are determined. 
In order to examine the fatigue or eventual failure of the samples, all films are measured with SEM after different numbers of bending cycles. Fig. 5 depicts the partially extracted titania film with different magnifications after 10, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 bending cycles. No failure is observed after 10 times bending, whereas a few cracks on the sample surface are visible after 100 times bending already. In addition, inside the crack (Fig. 5b3) the polymer template PS-b-PEO underneath the mesoporous titania layer is visible and appears to be stretched across the crack. After 500 bending cycles, the cracks increase in number, which can be clearly seen at low magnifications (Fig. 5d1). When the number of bending cycles increases to 1000 and 5000 times, a further propagation of the cracks is found. Moreover, the SEM images with the highest magnification show that the width of the cracks broadens with increasing bending numbers.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of partially extracted titania films bent (a) 10, (b) 100, (c) 500, (d) 1000 and (e) 5000 times. Three different magnifications of each sample are shown for clarity. 
The failure of the fully extracted titania film is demonstrated in Fig. 6 after different bending cycles. The 10 times bent sample shows no cracks in all SEM images with different magnifications, suggesting that mesoporous titania films are tolerable to 10 bending cycles with a maximal strain of (2.8 ± 0.2)%. After 100 bending times, small cracks appear on the sample surface. Moreover, Fig. 6b2 reveals no clear orientation of these cracks. From 500 bending times on, long and oriented cracks are present on the sample surface and the number of cracks increases with increasing bending numbers. For comparison, Fig. 7 shows the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer after different bending cycles. Unlike the partially extracted and fully extracted titania films, no cracks are observed on the sample surface irrespective of bending cycle numbers. In order to get a better view of the titania nanostructures in the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer, P3HT is completely removed by soaking the hybrid samples in chlorobenzene for 3 h after bending. The resulting samples are measured with SEM again and the results are displayed in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the titania nanostructures do not fail even after 5000 times bending. Thus, the hybrid layers exhibit a strongly enhanced stability against the applied mechanical load. However, the surface structures appear to be slightly different compared to the films before the backfilling process. These differences are caused by the interaction between the solvent and TiO2 nanostructures induced by capillary forces, when the films are backfilled with the P3HT solution and soaked with chlorobenzene.60

For a more quantitative and comparative analysis, the cracks are investigated regarding their cover ratio, length and width. The obtained results are plotted as a function of bending cycle number in Fig. 9. The cover ratio of the cracks gradually increases to about 3.5% with increasing bending numbers for the partially extracted titania film, whereas a larger crack cover ratio is found in the fully extracted titania film after 500 bending cycles. For instance, the cover ratio of cracks for the fully extracted titania film is about 11% after 5000 bending cycles, which is three times larger than that of its partially extracted counterpart. No cracks are present in the hybrid layer. Thus, the cover ratio and width of cracks are zero for all bending cycle numbers. The crack width shows an increase with increasing bending cycle number for both the partially extracted and fully extracted titania films. However, the absolute values differ. The crack width increases from around 50 nm (100 bending cycles) to about 120 nm (5000 bending cycles) for the partially extracted titania film, while it increases from approximately 90 nm to about 140 nm for the fully extracted titania film. The analysis on the cover ratio and width of the formed cracks suggests that the hybrid layers have strong stability against bending and do not age during the entire bending tests. In the case of the film with the polymer partially removed, aging causes cracking of the mesoporous titania films, whereas the nanostructures are most destroyed in the fully extracted titania films.

Modeling
The stress and strain behavior of the investigated films is modeled to find rules that will help to evaluate the elastic behavior of similar hybrid materials. According to the SEM images of the mesoporous films, the titania nanostructures are modeled as cellular solids comprised of uniform unit cells distributed over a 3D lattice. A single unit cell of an open-cell foam is shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† The inert mechanical properties of titania, the topology and shape of the network structure, and the thickness of the structures are considered to model the mechanical behavior of the film. Projected in a 2D plane, the modeled lattice is sketched as shown in Fig. 10. The lattice is assumed to be isotropic. Thus, the elastic modulus of the lattice is independent of the direction of an applied force.63 Within this assumption, the elastic modulus of the lattice structure (E) is defined by equation2 (2)where Es is the elastic modulus of compact titania, ρs is the density of compact titania, and ρ is the relative density of porous titania. In the present work, a porosity of (76 ± 3)% is determined for the fully extracted titania films (GISAXS measurements). Thus, ρ is equal to (24 ± 3)% of ρs. As bulk titania has an elastic modulus of (250 ± 30) GPa,64 the effective elastic modulus of the fully extracted titania films (Emeso) is calculated to be (14 ± 4) GPa.

The orange line refers to a strut with a moderate stress. The red region indicates the load shared by PS-b-PEO. (d) Failure model of the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer during bending. The pink line refers to a strut with a low stress and the red region indicates the load shared by P3HT. The blue network, yellow plane and orange plane indicate the titania scaffold, PS-b-PEO and P3HT, respectively. 
The titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid films are considered as polymer-matrix composites with a titania network reinforcement. Furthermore, the titania network is approximated as a distribution of randomly orientated and short titania cylinders inside the PS-b-PEO matrix. Typically, short fiber reinforced composites are modeled with the semi-empirical Halpin–Tsai model,65 based on which the effective elastic modulus of the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid films (Etitania/PS-b-PEO) is calculated by using eqn (3) (3)where Em and Ef are the elastic moduli of the PS-b-PEO matrix and the titania filler, Vf is the volume fraction of the filler and ξ is an empirical parameter. For short fibers, ξ can be written as ξ = 2(l/d) with the fiber length l and the fiber diameter d.65 According to the structure sizes and pore sizes obtained from GISAXS, l and d are approximated to be 35 nm and 38 nm, respectively. Then ξ is estimated to be 1.84. In this work, the PS and PEO blocks account for 72% and 28% (weight fraction) of PS-b-PEO, respectively, with an elastic modulus of (3.4 ± 0.2) GPa for PS and about 0.07 GPa for PEO.66,67 Accordingly, the value of Em is approximated to be (2.5 ± 0.2) GPa via taking into account the contributions from both PS and PEO blocks. As the porosity of mesoporous titania films is (76 ± 3)% after polymer extraction, the nanostructured titania has a volume ratio of (24 ± 3)% in the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid films. Consequently, the Etitania/PS-b-PEO is calculated to be (4.7 ± 0.5) GPa. Although this model was established for nanofibers rather than an interconnected network, Coldea et al. observed a good agreement between the theoretical values predicted with this model and the experimental data in a polymer-infiltrated-ceramic-network (PICN).68 For the partially extracted titania films, the vertical composition consists of mesoporous titania nanostructures with a thickness lmeso of about 50 nm and titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid composites with a thickness ltitania/PS-b-PEO of around 120 nm (obtained from the cross-sectional SEM image). Therefore, the effective elastic modulus of the partially extracted titania films (Epartial) can be determined to be (7.4 ± 1.6) GPa using the equation4 (4)
The effective elastic modulus of the hybrid layer (Eactive) is calculated following the same method as for the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid films. The elastic modulus of P3HT (EP3HT) is (1.3 ± 0.2) GPa,69 and thus Eactive is determined to be (2.4 ± 0.2) GPa. The obtained values of the elastic moduli suggest that the hybrid layer and the fully extracted titania film have the highest and lowest degrees of flexibility, respectively. Therefore, the approximated differences in the elastic moduli explain well the SEM observations on the film aging during the bending tests.

Fig. 10b shows a failure model of the fully extracted titania films. It is assumed that the failure of the investigated films is mainly due to the failure of the titania lattice. According to the stress–strain curve of a cellular solid introduced by Ashby,63 the foam lattice first shows a linear elastic behavior until the cell walls begin to fracture. Upon fracturing, additional loads from broken areas are transferred through the interconnected lattice network to the surrounding struts, leading to a high stress (indicated with a red strut in Fig. 10b). The overload may result in a fracture of the highly stressed strut and a propagation of the high stress and failure occurs down from the sample surface. For the partially extracted titania films, the top layer and the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid part are expected to have similar failure mechanisms to the fully extracted titania films and the hybrid layer, respectively. For the hybrid part, the polymer matrix carries a part of the stress during the bending, and the load on the titania network is reduced (Fig. 10c). Therefore, high stress concentrations at the struts of the foam lattice are relieved as compared to the fully extracted titania films. The observation of the stretched polymer across the cracks in the SEM measurements (Fig. 5b3) confirms that PS-b-PEO shares the load induced by the bending test. As a consequence, the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid part is prevented from cracking down to the bottom, showing a higher durability than the fully extracted titania films under continuous bending. Similar to the titania/PS-b-PEO hybrid part, for the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer, the P3HT matrix carries a part of the stress during the bending, and therefore the load on the titania network is reduced (Fig. 10d). Since the elastic modulus of P3HT ((1.3 ± 0.2) GPa) is smaller than that of PS-b-PEO ((2.5 ± 0.2) GPa), the P3HT matrix is able to share more stress than PS-b-PEO. In this work, no failure was observed on the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layer after 5000 bending cycles, suggesting that the foam lattice undergoes an elastic deformation under the reduced load. As compared to the partially extracted titania films, the titania/P3HT layer is more durable under continuous bending. One can expect that in the case of other conjugated polymers a similar stability of the hybrid active layer can be achieved, in case the same high degree of backfilling of the pores can be realized and if the polymer has a smaller or similar elastic modulus.
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the mechanical stability of mesoporous titania films (fully extracted films), partially extracted titania films and TiO2/P3HT hybrid layers on PET substrates upon continuous bending. The film failure is mainly studied by means of SEM measurements. For the partially extracted titania films and the fully extracted titania films, a growth in the crack number and width is observed with increasing bending cycle numbers. However, the extracted values of the cover ratio and width of cracks are larger for the fully extracted titania films, suggesting a lower mechanical stability of the mesoporous titania films. The TiO2/P3HT hybrid layers show a high flexibility as no cracks are observed after 5000 times bending, which demonstrates their great potential for practical application in flexible hybrid photovoltaics. For a quantitative analysis, micromechanical models are established to describe the mechanical properties of the investigated films. The determined elastic moduli of the films in turn explain the SEM observation that the TiO2/P3HT hybrid layers are highly flexible. The failure model shows that the titania struts in an open-cell foam suffer from very high stress in the fully extracted titania films, which causes the structure fracture and the propagation of cracks. In the context of titania composites, polymers share a part of the applied load, which results in a reduction of the stress on the titania struts and thereby prevents the fracture of titania nanostructures.
This work offers a facile way to characterize the film durability under continuous bending cycles, which illustrates enormous potential for the study of flexibility over other hybrid electronic devices, as for example in hybrid solar cells, which would use TiO2/P3HT hybrid layers as active layers in the devices.
