    , Accepted 22nd June 2023First published on 23rd June 2023AbstractThe organic molecules in hybrid perovskites can easily rotate within the inorganic lattice at room temperature, leading to a crystal-liquid duality. The liquid-like behavior of the organic molecules is commonly believed to play a critical role in the dynamical stability, but the microscopic mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, the presence of dynamically rotating molecules raises concerns regarding the reliability of assessing the stability of hybrid perovskites based on simple yet commonly used descriptors such as the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. Here we assess the finite-temperature phonons of hybrid perovskites by mapping ab initio molecular dynamics configurations onto an equivalent dynamical pseudo-inorganic lattice and extracting the effective force constants. We find that as compared to the formamidinium or cesium cations, stronger anisotropy and wider range of the thermal motion of the methylammonium molecule are essential for enhancing the dynamical stability of hybrid perovskites. The cation radius that determines the tolerance factor is, in fact, less important. This work not only enables a pathway to further improve the stability of hybrid perovskites, but also provides a general scheme to assess the stability of hybrid materials with dynamical disorder.
Since their emergence in 2009, the power conversion efficiency of hybrid-perovskite solar cells has soared from 3.8%1 to ∼ 25%.2,3 As they can also be relatively cheaply fabricated, they are considered exceptional solar absorbers for next-generation photovoltaic devices. However, the black phases of hybrid perovskites are often unstable, and may transition to yellow non-perovskite phases;4,5 when this happens, the excellent photovoltaic performance vanishes.
Many factors may critically impact the phase stability of hybrid perovskites. For instance, highly mobile point defects in hybrid perovskites may cause phase degradation.6,7 However, even for defect-free hybrid perovskites, their stabilization mechanisms are still unclear.
It has been empirically established8–10 that as compared to CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 [FA = CH(NH2)2], MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) is overall more stable against transition to non-perovskite phases; phase transitions are mainly between different photoactive perovskite phases [i.e., cubic (α), tetragonal (β), and orthorhombic (γ)]. This stabilization has oftentimes been rationalized in terms of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t),11i.e., (1)where rA, rB, and rX are the radii of the A-site, B-site, and X-site ions, respectively. MA has a relatively suitable effective ionic radius (2.16 Å12) that stabilizes cubic MAPbI3 perovskite (t = 0.9513). The ionic radius of FA is slightly too large (2.53 Å12), while that of Cs is too small (1.88 Å12); hence, cubic perovskites of FAPbI3 (t = 1.0313) and CsPbI3 (t = 0.8913) are both unstable.
The tolerance factor provides a geometrically intuitive explanation. However, there are still limitations with this analysis: (i) the standard tolerance factor could correctly capture the phase stability of only ∼74% perovskite materials;14 (ii) unlike more conventional perovskites with static all-inorganic lattices, the organic molecules in hybrid perovskites can more or less freely rotate at room temperature.15,16 The dynamical disorder and lattice anharmonicity are so strong17–20 that the simple geometric consideration may break down; and (iii) the tolerance factor is useful to assess qualitative phase stability,21,22 but the sophisticated microscopic mechanisms for phase stabilization are missing.
A physically more rigorous approach to the dynamical phase stability of a material would be examining its phonon spectrum, for which finite-displacement23,24 and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT)25,26 methods have been well established and commonly utilized. Nevertheless, these methods cannot be directly applied to compute the phonons of cubic hybrid perovskites at room temperature. “Blindly” applying the finite-displacement or DFPT approaches to cubic hybrid perovskites at T = 0 K would yield phonon spectra that contain many imaginary phonon modes. This result is, however, irrelevant because two important contributions have been ignored: temperature and dynamical disorder. Cubic (or “pseudocubic”) MAPbI3 is only dynamically stable above a critical temperature, which is close to room temperature. Hence, temperature effects need to be considered. This could, in principle, be addressed by using, e.g., the temperature-dependent effective potential (TDEP)27 or self-consistent phonon (SCP)28–31 methods. However, the organic cation is dynamically disordered and is commonly phrased “liquid-like”.32 Hybrid perovskites have thus a crystal-liquid duality, the phonons of which are conceptually and technically challenging even with TDEP and SCP.
In this work we rigorously investigate the dynamical stability based on finite-temperature phonons of hybrid perovskites, and assess the impact of dynamically rotating organic molecules on the phase stability of hybrid perovskites. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, and map the AIMD configurations onto an equivalent pseudo-inorganic lattice; the effective force-constant matrix is extracted with an optimization scheme. By applying this scheme to MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, we show that the crystal-liquid duality substantially enhances the dynamical stability of hybrid perovskites. The major advantage of MA in stabilizing pseudocubic perovskite is not only a suitable ionic radius, but more importantly, its special rotation dynamics, that is characterized by anisotropic and wide-range spatial motion of the mass center, which is much less pronounced in FA- and Cs-based halide perovskites.
To demonstrate the importance of the dynamical disorder of the organic A-site cation on the stability of hybrid perovskites, we first analyze the phonon spectra of MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and CsPbI3 at T = 0 K. As shown by the orange dashed lines in Fig. 1a–c, there exist pronounced imaginary modes in the phonon spectra at T = 0 K for all three perovskite compounds, which implies their dynamical instabilities. In particular, FAPbI3 and CsPbI3 are severely unstable with imaginary modes extending through the entire q-point path depicted.
 Fig. 1  Computed phonon spectra of three cubic perovskites at 0 K and 300 K: (a) MAPbI3, (b) FAPbI3, and (c) CsPbI3. The insets show the corresponding crystal structures of the unit cells. 
There are primarily two types of instabilities for the pseudocubic α phase here: (i) transition to β or γ perovskite phase, and (ii) transition to yellow hexagonal (δ) phase, which may also occur through β and γ phases as intermediate steps. We show the eigenmodes associated with the imaginary frequencies of CsPbI3, FAPb3 and MAPb3 at 0 K in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†). The imaginary phonon modes are mainly located at the M and R points. For CsPbI3, its instability originates from octahedral rotation; in-phase-tilt (+) of subsequent layers of octahedra noted as a0a0c+ in the Glazer notation33 at the M point induces phase transition from the α to β phase (Fig. S1, ESI†) and the a+b−b− tilt at the R point leads to transition from α to γ phase (Fig. S2, ESI†). Compared to CsPbI3, MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 have additional sources of instability due to the existence of organic molecules. The imaginary phonon modes of FAPbI3 are mainly due to vibrations of the molecule at the M point (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the relative displacements of the Pb and I atoms coupled by the organic molecule at the R point (Fig. S4, ESI†). Molecular vibrations also induce phase instability of MAPbI3 at the R point (Fig. S5, ESI†) and the a0a0c+ tilt mode at the M point causes MAPbI3 to transition from α to β phase (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Nevertheless, of actual relevance is the dynamical stabilities of the three compounds at room temperature, for which we need to take into account temperature and dynamical-disorder effects.
The liquid-like dynamical rotations of the organic cations introduce severe disorder for the organic sublattice, which is difficult to be described within the perturbation picture. However, the vibrational modes of the molecules have anyway very high frequencies. What we are concerned with here is actually the stability of the inorganic sublattice under the dynamical rotations of the organic molecules, which is analogous to the impact of magnetic disorder on the lattice dynamical stability.34,35 Motivated by this consideration, we suggest an improved approach to computing the finite-temperature phonons of hybrid materials, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the present approach to computing the phonon spectra of hybrid perovskites. The organic cations (MA in this case) are substituted with a pseudo-atom A at their respective mass centers. 
Specifically, we first perform AIMD simulations for hybrid perovskites at an elevated temperature (T) for N steps. Afterwards, we extract N atomic configurations from the AIMD trajectory and substitute the organic cations with an equivalent (i.e., identical atomic mass) pseudo-atom A at the respective mass center for each organic cation, namely, (2)where RAi is the mass center of the ith organic cation for the pseudo-atom A to substitute. mj and Rij are the atomic mass and Cartesian coordinate of atom j in the ith organic cation.
The atomic forces derived from the AIMD simulations are utilized in this way: the forces on the inorganic sublattice (here Pb and I) are retained and the forces on the organic cation are vectorially summed to achieve the equivalent forces on the pseudo-atom A. We thus obtain the complete atomic forces [Ft(T)] on the equivalent pseudo-inorganic lattice. Finally, we extract an effective force-constant matrix (Φeff) that best describes the relation between atomic displacements [ut(T)] (referenced to ideal cubic perovskite APbI3) and the associated atomic forces [Ft(T)], i.e., (3)The phonon frequencies can be obtained by Fourier transforming the real-space force-constant matrix to reciprocal space and matrix diagonalization.
Employing the improved scheme, we obtain the phonon spectra for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 at room temperature (blue lines in Fig. 1a and b). In the case of CsPbI3 the phonon spectrum can be obtained in a similar way, but no cation substitution is required (blue line in Fig. 1c).
Three interesting observations can be made from these results. First, the imaginary modes in the phonon spectrum of MAPbI3 at T = 0 K vanish, demonstrating its dynamical stability at room temperature. Second, despite using the same methodology, the room-temperature phonon spectrum of FAPbI3 still exhibits pronounced imaginary phonon modes in the vicinity of the M and R points; nevertheless, the dynamical stability of FAPbI3 has been drastically improved as compared to the situation at T = 0 K. Third, in the absence of organic molecules, temperature-induced lattice vibrations and fluctuations in CsPbI3 also help to enhance its dynamical stability, but it is still unstable.
The above results well capture the actual dynamical stabilities of the three perovskite compounds at room temperature,36 demonstrating the reliability of our approach. To further elucidate the microscopic mechanism of how the A-site cation impacts the dynamical stability of the perovskite compounds, we carefully analyze the imaginary modes. Using the imaginary mode at M as an example, we extract its eigenvector, through which we generate a series of displaced atomic configurations of CsPbI3; the eigendisplacements mainly involve the Pb and I atoms. The black lines in Fig. 3 show the potential energy surface along the displaced direction, which is quantitatively described by a one-dimensional configuration coordinate (37), where mα is the mass of atom α in a displaced configuration. Rα (R0;α) is the Cartesian coordinate of atom α in the displaced (undisplaced) configuration. The sign of Q implies parallel or anti-parallel to the direction of the eigenvector. A double-well potential with the undisplaced configuration at the saddle point (Q = 0) that characterizes the dynamical instability can be clearly observed.
 Fig. 3  Potential energy surfaces of CsPbI3 as a function of a configuration coordinate (Q) derived from the imaginary phonon mode at M and the impact of displacement of the Cs atom along different directions on the potential energy surfaces: (a) [100], (b) [110], and (c) [111]. The displacements of Cs shown in the legend correspond to the ones along principal directions. For instance, a displacement of 0.01a for the [111] case means that the Cs atom is displaced by 0.01a along x, y, and z; the total magnitude of displacement is . 
To quantitatively study the interplay between the motion of the A-site cation and the displacements of the Pb and I atoms (associated with the eigenmode), we move the Cs atom by different magnitudes along three high-symmetry directions: [100], [110], and [111] for all configurations on the double-well potential. In the case of [100] (Fig. 3a), the displacement of Cs breaks the symmetry of the double-well potential: lifting one side of the potential up and bringing down the other while increasing the Cs displacement. Still, it does not help to remove the instability at Q = 0. When Cs is displaced along [110] (Fig. 3b) or [111] (Fig. 3c), the double-well potential is symmetrically lifted up on both sides, which effectively removes the imaginary frequency at Q = 0. The critical displacements are around  (0.69 Å) and  (0.53 Å) for [110] and [111], respectively, where a is the lattice constant (6.1 Å). This implies that displacing Cs along [111] is more effective to stabilize cubic CsPbI3.
After identifying the effective directions and critical magnitudes for the displacement of the A-site cation in stabilizing the cubic perovskite, we peer into the dynamical motions of the three types of A-site cations at room temperature. To intuitively visualize the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the A-site cations, we convert the Cartesian coordinate of the mass centers of MA, FA, and Cs to a spherical coordinate, i.e., x = rsinθcosϕ, y = rsinθsinϕ, and z = rcosθ. The spatial distributions as a function of r and ϕ for the three types of A-site cations are shown in Fig. 4a–c. MA exhibits two important features: (i) the radial range of the mass center of MA is larger than those of FA and Cs, and (ii) the spatial distribution of the mass center of MA is anisotropic, whereas those of FA and Cs are more or less isotropic.
 Fig. 4  (a)–(c) Molecular dynamics trajectory of the mass center of the A-site cation projected onto spherical coordinates (r, ϕ) in (a) MAPbI3, (b) FAPbI3, and (c) CsPbI3. (d)–(f) Molecular dynamics trajectory of the mass center of the A-site cation projected onto spherical coordinates (θ, ϕ) in (d) MAPbI3, (e) FAPbI3, and (f) CsPbI3. 

Fig. 4d–f shows the spatial distributions projected onto θ and ϕ, which allows the extraction of the preferential (if exists) displacing directions of the A-site cations. In the case of MA, we see strong intensities for ϕ close to 45° and 225°; further taking into account the dependence on θ the preferential displacing direction of MA should be between {111} and {110}, both of which are beneficial for stabilizing the perovskite lattice, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b and c. Also, as shown in Fig. 4a the displacement of MA can reach 0.8 Å with relatively high probabilities, well exceeding the critical magnitudes of displacement along [110] (0.69 Å) and [111] (0.53 Å) in Fig. 3b and c. The direction preference of FA is less pronounced compared to MA; there are higher intensities close to [111] and [110], but the magnitude of displacement as depicted in Fig. 4b is smaller. Consequently, the dynamical motion of FA is not sufficient to stabilize the perovskite lattice. The spatial range of Cs is slightly greater than that of FA, but the direction preference is weak. The relatively stronger intensities close to [00] also do not help. For both Cs and FA, higher temperatures would be required in order to further expand their spatial motions and thus to stabilize the perovskite lattice.
To conclude, we have studied the influence of the thermal motions of the A-site cations on the finite-temperature phonons of halide perovskites using a rigorous first-principles scheme. We have elucidated the microscopic mechanisms of how liquid-like organic cations help to enhance the dynamical stability, which clearly shows the limitation of the simple empirical tolerance factor. Instead, the anisotropy and range of the thermally induced spatial motion of the organic cation play a vital role in dynamically stabilizing hybrid perovskite MAPbI3, which inhibits the transformation of MAPbI3 from α to β phase. The mechanistic insights are critical for resolving the severe instability issues of halide perovskites, and improve our understanding of the phase stability of hybrid materials with dynamically disordered sublattices in general.
Methods
First-principles calculations
Our first-principles calculations are based on density functional theory with the local density approximation (LDA)38 for the exchange–correlation functional; we note that the use of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional39 yields similar results. We adopt projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials40 as constructed in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).41 A plane-wave energy cutoff of 500 eV and Γ-point sampling are used for 3 × 3 × 3 supercells of the three cubic-perovskite compounds.
Phonon calculations
For the computation of the phonon spectrum at T = 0 K, we employ the finite displacement method as implemented in Phonopy42 in conjunction with first-principles force evaluations in VASP. For the finite-temperature phonon calculations, we perform AIMD simulations for the three perovskite compounds using 3 × 3 × 3 supercells. We employ a canonical ensemble (NVT) with the Nosé–Hoover thermostat43,44 for temperature equilibration at 300 K. A time step of 1 fs is used and the AIMD simulations are iterated for 5000 steps, which ensures thermodynamic equilibrium and a robust convergence of the phonon spectra.
