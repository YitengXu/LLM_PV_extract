    AbstractWe scrutinize the energetic and kinetic interplays in oligothiophene dye-sensitized solar cells via analyzing electrical impedance as well as transient emission and absorption spectroscopies.

Broader context
Dye-sensitized solar cell technology has been attached with ever-increasing significance since the breakthrough Nature paper by O'Regan and Grätzel. To date, this photovoltaic device has been validated with the highest efficiency of 11.2% with a ruthenium dye. With recognition of the limited resources of ruthenium, metal-free organic photosensitizers have been extensively explored in recent years. In this context, special efforts have been devoted to the design of many new dyes with different π-conjugation units, which can influentially affect not only the electronic structure of the molecule, but also the critical physicochemical properties of the dye/titania/electrolyte interface which essentially determines the cell performance. Herein, we systematically investigate the photovoltaic features of organic dye-sensitized solar cells in combination with a series of push–pull oligothiophene dyestuffs. Transient emission and absorption as well as electrical impedance spectroscopies are deployed to scrutinize the energetic and kinetic interplays in the oligothiophene dye-sensitized solar cells.

The ever-increasing demand for energy and the environmental deterioration due to the usage of fossil fuels are compelling our scientists and engineers to seek for benign alternatives, which are fundamental to maintain the steady growth of the future economy.1 Amongst various renewable resources, solar is the most abundant one to meet our future energy supply. The present challenge consists in searching for a viable method, by which humankind can exploit solar energy at an affordable cost. Conventional solar cells made from crystalline silicon have attained a power conversion efficiency of ∼25%,2 but their price per kilowatt-hour with respect to that of the routine electricity grid has restricted widespread application. In the family of various cutting-edge photovoltaic technologies, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has attracted considerable attention owing to its perceivable merits of low cost, low weight, coloring and easy processing.3 On the basis of continuous materials innovation, a state-of-the-art DSC with a ruthenium sensitizer has achieved a validated efficiency of 11.2%4 measured at the AM1.5G conditions.
During the past years, a mass of endeavours have been focused on the development of metal-free organic dyes and a consecutive device enhancement has been witnessed.5 The advantages of an organic sensitizer are the low cost of production, a lack of pollution and resource limitation and feasible modification of their molecular structure to tune the photophysical and electrochemical properties. Thiophene and its related fragments have been frequently utilized as building blocks in the construction of organic sensitizers. In this context, a large number of chromophores have been synthesized but insightful physical analysis is relatively rare on device operation. Moreover, to some extent it is not feasible to evaluate the structure–property relationship of so many reported new dyes, partially because of the inevitable discrepancies of material purity, device processing and testing conditions in different groups.
In this contribution, we study the evident influence of the oligothiophene length, in a series of push–pull dyes characteristic of the electron-rich alkoxyl-substituted triphenylamine donor and the electron-deficient cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, upon the photocurrent action spectra and cell photovoltage. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. To simplify the following discussion, these dyes will be denoted as Tn (n = 1, 2, 3 and 4) wherein n means the number of thiophene units. Note that T1 and T2 are the compounds named C2136 and D21L67 in the previous publications. The synthetic details of T3 and T4 are described in the ESI.† The complicated energetic and kinetic interplays at the titania/dye/electrolyte interface will be analyzed by means of measurements of electrical impedance as well as transient emission and absorption spectroscopies.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of oligothiophene dyes: T1 (n = 1), T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 3) and T4 (n = 4). 
We first roughly evaluate the light absorption, charge generation and carrier collection of DSCs with T1–T4 via measuring their photocurrent action spectra. If we assume that all the photons of a certain wavelength are harvested by these cells to generate free electrons and holes absolutely, which then traverse through the respective titania and electrolyte phases to current collectors, the incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE or EQE) at that particular wavelength should equal one. As illustrated in Fig. 2, T2–T4 all confer a plateau of EQEs upon the dye-stained titania films, owing to the saturated light-harvesting in a certain wavelength region. It can also be perceived that the larger the conjugated thiophene block, the longer the onset wavelength of photocurrent. This scenario is intimately related to a stepwise reduction of energy gap in this series of oligothiophene sensitizers, as revealed by measuring the absorption spectra (Fig. S1 of the ESI†) of dye-coated titania films. Charge collection at the short-circuit condition for IPCE measurements is not a big concern in our cells because the electron diffusion lengths (Ln)8 shown in Fig. S2† are much larger than our film thickness.
 Fig. 2  Photocurrent action spectra of T1–T4. An antireflection film was adhered to a testing cell during measurement. The cell was tested using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. The electrolyte composition is 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 30 mM iodine (I2), 50 mM lithium iodide (LiI), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GNCS) in the 85/15 mixture of acetonitrile (AN) and valeronitrile (VN). 
To investigate the yield of electron injection at the dye/titania interface, which is one of the other decisive parameters of external quantum efficiency apart from the light-harvesting capacity,9–12 we first employed the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique to track the photoluminescence decays of the oligothiophene dye-coated alumina film as a blank reference. It is well documented that the electrolyte components can have remarkable impacts on the conduction band edge movement thus altering the energy offset at the semiconductor/dye interface.13,14 This is actually the case in our oligothiophene dye-sensitized solar cells, which will be detailed in the subsequent electrical impedance characterization. Thereby we constructed dummy cells loaded with the practical DSC electrolyte for emission measurements. Upon laser excitation at 488 nm, strong emissions were probed for T1–T4 dyes anchored on mesoporous alumina films even if the lifetimes are pretty short. Because charge generation is not possible to arise owing to the absence of a favorable energy offset at the alumina/dye interface, we ascribed the dashed decay traces presented in Fig. 3 to the deactivation of excited-state dye molecules. Deactivation stemming from the dye aggregation can be ruled out, because a three times higher concentration (90 mM) of the cheno additive in the dye-bath solution does not alter the decay trace any more. However, the emission intensities (I) are remarkably attenuated by simply replacing alumina with titania, which implies the occurrence of electron injection from excited dye to titania. Through comparing the integral of the emission trace of a dye-coated titania film with respect to that of alumina, we derived the electron injection efficiencies (ηinj) of T1–T4, which are all close to unity. In further combination with the fitted mean photoluminescence lifetime of oligothiophene dye-coated alumina films, being in the range of 44.9–62.5 ps, we could deduce that the rate constants of electron injection from these oligothiophene dyes in our working cells should be larger than 2 × 1012 s−1.
 Fig. 3  Time-correlated emission decay traces of T1–T4 grafted on the mesoporous titania or alumina film immersed in the electrolyte for cell fabrication. Excitation wavelength: 488 nm. Detection wavelength at the wavelength of maximum emission intensity: T1, 639 nm; T2, 674 nm; T3, 687 nm; T4, 700 nm. The emission intensity (I) was corrected in terms of the film absorbance at 488 nm and further normalized with respect to the emission maximum of a dye-coated alumina film (Imax,alumina). 
We further carried out nanosecond transient absorption measurements to scrutinize the interfacial kinetic competition between dye regeneration and charge recombination of dye cations with electrons in the titania film, which is considered to make a remarkable contribution to the IPCE height.15–17 As presented in Fig. S3,† spectroelectrochemical measurements manifest that the oxidized states of T1–T4 grafted on a nanocrystalline film all possess a strong absorption in the infrared region, in comparison with their neutral counterparts. Thereby we chose a monochromatic light at 782 nm to probe the dual-channel charge-transfer kinetics of dye cations, on otherwise account of the signal sensitivity of the detector in our measuring system. Excitation fluences were carefully controlled in our kinetic measurements to ensure that ∼4.74 × 1013 photons cm−2 (i.e. ∼0.8 photon per TiO2 nanoparticle) were absorbed by the dye-coated titania films during every laser pulse. The absorption signal decays could be well fitted to a stretched exponential decay function (ΔmOD ∝ exp[−(t/τ)α]) to afford a half-reaction time (t1/2).
As shown in Fig. 4, in the presence of an inert electrolyte with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anions, the absorption signal decays could be ascribed to the charge recombination of dye cations with electrons in the titania film. The half-reaction times (t1/2,rec) are correspondingly 2506, 1598, 1477 and 2000 μs for T1, T2, T3 and T4. The formal redox potentials of T1–T4 are −5.455, −5.401, −5.392 and −5.373 V versus vacuum, respectively, and are not obviously correlated with the rates of interfacial charge recombination, probably due to this reaction lying near the peak of the Marcus free energy curve. This phenomenon is generally consistent with the result reported by Durrant et al.18 on a series of ruthenium sensitizers. In their work, there is a strong dependence of recombination rate on the mean spatial distance between the HOMOs of dye cations and the titania surface. If the electron tunneling theory also applies to our experimental observation on T1–T4, we may derive that the oligothiophene-dye HOMOs do not depart too far from titania, along with the extension of conjugation length. Comprehensive quantum calculation and kinetic simulation will be performed to address this issue in our future work.
 Fig. 4  Transient absorption kinetics of 7-μm-thick nanocrystalline titania films coated with T1–T4 immersed in the inert (a, c, e and g) and electroactive (b, d, f and h) electrolytes. Inert electrolyte: 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, 50 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 0.5 M TBP in the 85/15 mixture of AN and VN. Electroactive electrolyte: 1.0 M DMII, 50 mM LiI and 0.5 M TBP in the 85/15 mixture of AN and VN. Absorbance changes (ΔmOD) were measured at a probe wavelength of 782 nm upon pulsed laser excitation. The pulse fluence and excitation wavelength: a, 34.5 μJ cm−2 at 574 nm; b, 35.9 μJ cm−2 at 564 nm; c, 33.3 μJ cm−2 at 601 nm; d, 33.6 μJ cm−2 at 591 nm; e, 32.6 μJ cm−2 at 619 nm; f, 32.3 μJ cm−2 at 613 nm; g, 31.5 μJ cm−2 at 638 nm; h, 32.3 μJ cm−2 at 630 nm. Smooth black lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 3000 laser shots. 
When bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is replaced with iodide, the absorption decays depicted in Fig. 4 for titania films grafted with T1–T4 are greatly accelerated, indicative of efficient electron transfer between iodide anions and dye cations. The overall reaction free energy (ΔG0) and half-reaction time (t1/2,dr) for dye regeneration are collected in Table S1.† Along with the extension of oligothiophene conjugation, the value of reaction free energy gradually becomes small owing to the negative shift of the formal potentials (Fig. S4†) of oligothiophene dyes. Obviously, there is a positive correlation between thermodynamic driving force and reaction rate, suggesting that the dye regeneration kinetics locates in the normal Marcus region.19,20 Despite that the regeneration rate is remarkably attenuated from T1 to T4, the interception yield (ηinter) of dye cations with iodide is only marginally diminished from 100% to 98%, which were calculated with the following equation: (1)Note that the 1/t1/2,dr and 1/t1/2,rec correspondingly represent the reaction rate constant for dye regeneration and dye cation recombination with titania electrons.
We further measured the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 5) of cells based upon the oligothiophene sensitizers under an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2.† In good agreement with the integral of the preceding IPCEs over the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) gradually increases with the augmentation of the conjugated thiophene number. It is noticeable that the conjugation extension exerts an adverse impact on the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), featuring an almost 80 mV diminishment from T1 to T4. Also, a gentle decline of fill factor (FF) is perceived along with prolongation of dye molecules. Amongst these sensitizers, T4 delivers the highest Jsc of 15.35 mA cm−2, which overwhelms the unfavorable joint effect of Voc and FF, exhibiting a relatively high efficiency (η) of ∼8%. With more thiophene units, it is also possible to get a higher efficiency.

The cell was tested using a metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2. Electrolyte composition: 1.0 M DMII, 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M GNCS in the 85/15 mixture of AN and VN. 
We also measured the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)21,22 to scrutinize the influence of dye-grafting on the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and interfacial charge recombination kinetics involving the titania electrons and triiodide in the electrolyte, which in turn can have implications for the observed photovoltage variations. Herein Ec can be acquired via numeric analysis on the titania electron transport resistance (Rt), which is derived through fitting the experimental impedance spectra with a proper equivalent circuit.21 The dependence of Rt on the titania quasi-Fermi level (EF,n) under illumination is23 (2)wherein R0 denotes the electron transport resistance in the conduction band and is considered to be constant provided that the geometrical dimensions of our cells are invariable. EF,redox is the electrolyte Fermi level and that (EF,n − EF,redox) = eV, where V represents the applied potential bias in the EIS experiments. e is the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. In this work, we applied a modified formulation: (3)
Natural logarithm treatment of eqn (3) gives (4)Herein β is introduced as an empirical factor correcting the discrepancy between the practical fitting slope (usually from −32 to −36 V−1) of eqn (4) and the theoretical counterpart (−38.9 V−1). As shown in Fig. S5A,† fittings on Rtversus Voc explicitly give Ec relative to EF,redox through calculation with the fitted intercepts. As indicated in Table S3,† the titania conduction band edge undergoes a gradually downward movement from T1 to T4. We note that this stepwise shifting of Ec away from vacuum is partially responsible for the gradual decrease of Voc.
Further effort is made to resolve the kinetics of charge recombination with triiodide in the electrolyte, which has a significant influence on the cell open-circuit photovoltage. Considering the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rr) and the recombination current density (jr):24 (5)wherein A is the active cell area, the recombination current can be further correlated with the charge recombination rate (Un) through jr = edUn(6)where d is the titania film thickness. Also note that in a DSC, the interfacial charge recombination rate is not linearly proportional to the free electron density (n), suggesting a non-unit reaction order γ and thus24 Un = k0nγ(7)wherein k0 is the reaction rate constant, and n is well described by the Boltzmann statistics assuming that (Ec − EF,n) ≫ kBT as (8)wherein Nc is the density of accessible states in the conduction band. Combining eqn (5)–(8) gives (9)
Fittings in Fig. S5B† with eqn (9) afford two critical parameters (Table S3†) concerning the interfacial charge recombination, k0 and γ, which collectively contribute to the charge recombination rate (eqn (7)). As shown in Fig. 6, we note that the recombination rate Un essentially followed the tendency of the reaction order γ which is related to the surface state distribution in titania,24 rather than that of the reaction rate constant k0. The gradually accelerated recombination rate likely makes another contribution to the photovoltage shrinkage with the increase of oligothiophene length.
 Fig. 6  Plots of the simulated charge recombination rate under open-circuit condition versus the free electron density. 
In summary, we have investigated the energetic and kinetic interplays in oligothiophene dye-sensitized solar cells via a joint photophysical and electrical analysis. Electron injection from the excited-state oligothiophene dyes to titania nanocrystals is ultrafast, ensuring almost quantitative exciton dissociation yields in spite of short exciton lifetimes. The charge recombination rate of oxidized dye molecules with the titania electrons is nearly independent of the structural variation in this series of sensitizers. However, there is an apparent Gibbs free energy dependence of the interception rate of dye cations by iodide. The sharp kinetic contrasts of these two charge-transfer channels for T1–T4 guarantee excellent net charge separation yields. Analysis of electrical impedance spectra reveals that the rate of charge recombination between the titania electrons and triiodide strongly depends on the reaction order, which is noticeably augmented with the dye length. A synchronous downward shift of the titania conduction band edge is also noted for dyes with more thiophene units, contributing to a gradually declining open-circuit photovoltage, along with a remarkably accelerated interfacial charge recombination.
