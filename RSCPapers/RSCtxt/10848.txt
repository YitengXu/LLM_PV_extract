    , Accepted 28th May 2020First published on 29th May 2020AbstractThe low laser damage threshold of commercial infrared nonlinear optical materials is the main bottleneck that hinders their high-power coherent source applications. Here, a new compound Rb2CdBrI3 was successfully synthesized in a controlled manner by using a rational halogen substitution. It features a zero-dimensional [CdBrI3]2− tetrahedron and inserted Rb+ cations were used as the counter cations. In contrast to the isomorphic Rb2CdBr2I2, Rb2CdBrI3 exhibits an anomalously enlarged bandgap of 4.01 eV and an unprecedented high laser damage threshold up to 46 times that of AgGaS2. Theoretical calculations determine that the abnormal bandgap attributes to weak conduction band dispersion from the reduced net dipole moment and the enhanced halogen s–p orbital mixing when Br is replaced by I. This work not only promotes Rb2CdBrI3 as a promising infrared nonlinear converter, but also supplies new modulating viewpoints for the band-sensitive optoelectronic devices, such as hybrid perovskite solar cells with mixed halogen.
1. Introduction
Over the years, second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal materials have received increasing attention and are facing urgent demand in optoelectronic and photonic frontiers. Specifically, the practical mid-infrared (MIR) nonlinear optical crystal is an indispensable part of the MIR laser applied in modern sensing, monitoring, detecting and defense security.1–6 However, the commercial MIR chalcopyrite NLO crystals, including AgGaS2 (AGS),7 AgGaSe2 (AGSe)8 and ZnGeP2,9 suffer from an intrinsic narrow bandgap and low laser damage thresholds (LDTs), thereby hindering their wide applications in high-power mid-infrared nonlinear frequency conversion. Therefore, searching for novel MIR NLO materials with ultrahigh LDTs is becoming a new scientific hotspot in the functional materials community.10–13
In previous reports, an “all in one” strategy, combining the different acentric building units into one structure, has been demonstrated to make MIR NLO materials with large nonlinearity and complex chemical composition.14–21 However, this route often results in a strong structural distortion and a reduced laser damage threshold of the subsequent crystals. Therefore, urgent exploration of NLO materials with a wide bandgap as well as high LDTs using simple systems is required.
Besides metal chalcogenides, metal halides are also promising MIR NLO crystal candidates due to their relatively large NLO effect, wider IR transparency and higher laser damage threshold (LDT).22 However, compared with chalcogenide compounds, halides are less used candidates in MIR nonlinear optical crystal materials. Meanwhile, it is known that mixing halogens or replacing halogens in halides is a very effective strategy to regulate the band gap and the nonlinear optical effect which is conducive to exploring new types of nonlinear optical crystal materials with excellent comprehensive performance. Recently, Gong et al. summarized the nonlinear optical materials of metal halides and found that compounds with linear and tetrahedral anionic groups can achieve a better balance between band gap and nonlinear performance.22 Rb2CdBr2I2, with a [CdBr2I2]2− tetrahedron, has been reported as a potential mid-infrared (MIR) nonlinear optical crystal material.23 Therefore, we considered whether it is possible to adjust the band gap and the nonlinear optical effect by suitable replacement of the halogen to explore new MIR nonlinear optical crystal materials based on the following considerations: (i) to enrich the composition and structural diversity of halides, (ii) to further reveal the internal relationship between the band gap and the nonlinearity, especially the design of the large band gap and (iii) to further complement the candidate library of the halide nonlinear optical crystal materials. Fortunately, we successfully obtained a new compound Rb2CdBrI3 by replacing one bromine with one iodine in Rb2CdBr2I2. Subsequently, extensive research on the NLO properties of Rb2CdBrI3 has been made through experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show that the powder of Rb2CdBrI3 has moderate phase-matching NLO effects, ultrahigh LDT, wide IR transparency and good thermal stability, thus suggesting Rb2CdBrI3 could be a good candidate for the MIR NLO crystal. Furthermore, the abnormal bandgap enlargement in Rb2CdBrI3 in contrast to isomorphic Rb2CdBr2I2 was evaluated by first principles calculations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and methods
RbI and CdBr2·4H2O were purchased from Shanpu Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used with no further treatment. RbI and CdBr2·4H2O were used without further purifying. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the crystals was performed using a Bruker D8 Advanced diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54186 Å) with the angular range of 2θ = 10°–70° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1 at room temperature. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for the single crystals was performed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an FEI Quanta 200 X-ray spectrometer. The IR spectrum was performed using a Nicolet iS5 Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The dried KBr was mixed thoroughly with the samples and pressed into a slice to test. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum was collected by using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer with a scan range of 200–800 nm. Select spectrally pure barium sulfate as the standard plate, add a small amount of sample on the surface of the standard white board, and then flatten the sample with a glass cylinder to obtain a sample plate. The absorption spectrum was calculated from the reflectance spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function: α/S = (1 − R)2/2R, where α is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient, and R is the reflectance, respectively.24 The thermal analysis was performed by using a STA 449 F5 simultaneous analyzer instrument. The samples were heated from 30 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 K min−1 by using nitrogen as a protective gas. The SHG measurement was performed on the sieved polycrystalline samples using a modified Kurtz–Perry method.25 Polycrystalline samples of the compound were ground and sieved into several particle size ranges (20–40, 40–60, 60–80, 80–100, 100–125, 125–150, 150–200 and 200–300 μm) for the measurement. Microcrystalline KH2PO4 (KDP) served as the standard and was sieved into the same particle size ranges. The final SHG efficiency was the evaluation comparing oscilloscope traces of the SHG signals of KDP and Rb2CdBrI3 at the powder size of 200–300 μm. The powder LDT of the grounded polycrystalline samples was tested by using a single-pulse powder LDT method,26–28 and AgGaS2 with the same particle sizes was used as the comparison. The powder samples were fixed on the bracket, the laser emission energy was adjusted, and the samples were made to endure gradually increasing radiation until the sample surface changed.
2.2. Synthesis
Colorless millimeter-scale single crystals of Rb2CdBrI3 (Fig. S1, ESI†) were grown using a simple solution method, which was synthesized by the reaction between RbI and CdBr2·4H2O in the ratio of 3:1. Specifically, 3 mmol RbI (0.6371 g) and 1 mmol CdBr2·4H2O (0.3443 g) were dissolved in a mixture composed of 6 mL acetone and 1 mL distilled water to form a colorless transparent solution, and the solution was then stirred at room temperature for 12 h followed by slow evaporation at room temperature. A few days later, several colorless block crystals of Rb2CdBrI3 were obtained. The reaction equation is:3RbI + CdBr2·4H2O → Rb2CdBrI3 + RbBr + 4H2O
The purity of the compound was confirmed by using powder X-ray diffraction technology (Fig. S2, ESI†). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental analyses gave an average Rb:Cd:Br:I molar ratio of 1.7:1:1:2.5, which is close to that determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (2:1:1:3) (Table S2 and Fig. S3, ESI†).
2.3. Computational methods
The first-principles simulations at the atomic level for Rb2CdBrI3 and Rb2CdBr2I2 crystals were carried out using the Material Studio package29 based on the density functional theory (DFT),30 which has been successfully applied to metal halides.31,32 The kinetic energy cutoff of 700 eV and dense Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes33 spanning less than 0.03 Å−3 in the first Brillouin zone (4 × 4 × 6) were chosen to guarantee sufficient accuracy of the simulated results. The exchange–correlation (XC) functionals were described by using a generalized gradient density approximation (GGA-PBE) functional34 and the ion–electron interactions were modeled by using the norm-conversing pseudopotentials35 for all the elements. In this model, Rb 4s24p65s1, Cd 4d105s2, Br 5s25p5 and I 6s26p5 electrons were treated as the valence electrons. In order to obtain an accurate band dispersion, an ultrafine smearing value of 0.001 Å−1 was selected.
2.4. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data of the compound were collected at 293(2) (K) on a XtaLAB Mini II diffractometer. Using Olex2, the structure was solved with the ShelXT36 structure solution program using Intrinsic Phasing and refined with the ShelXL37 refinement package using Least Squares minimisation. Relevant crystallographic data and structure refinement information for the compound are summarized in Table 1, selected bond distances are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The CCDC number for Rb2CdBrI3 is 2005524.†

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
In order to better understand the controllable substitution, it is necessary to discuss its synthesis method in detail. From previous literature, it is known that the synthesis of Rb2CdBr2I2 is obtained by the reaction of RbBr and CdI2 in a molar ratio of 2:1. Since it is 4-coordinated Cd, 2 moles of Br− are directly connected to the central metal ion Cd2+ to form [CdBr2I2]2−, which does not involve any ion substitution. According to the hard and soft acid–base principle (HSAB principle), Cd2+ is a soft acid, Br− is a junction base, and I− is a soft base, leading to Cd2+, which is prone to combine with I−, that is, I− easily replaces Br− in CdBr2 completely, and Br− is difficult to replace the I− in CdI2. Based on the above ideas, in this paper, a 3:1 molar ratio of RbI and CdIBr2·H2O is used. First, 2 moles of I− will be directly linked to Cd2+ to form [CdBr2I2]2−, then an excess of 1 mole of I− will easily replace 1 mole of Br− in [CdBr2I2]2− to obtain [CdBrI3]2−. Therefore, based on the HSAB principle, we can prepare our desired compounds through rational halogen substitution, which will provide important synthetic ideas for the subsequent exploration of halide-based nonlinear optical materials.
3.2. Structure description
Rb2CdBrI3 crystallizes in the NCS orthorhombic crystal space group Ama2 (No. 40). Within one asymmetric unit, there are two 1/2 of Rb, one 1/2 of I, one 1/2 of Br, and one 1/2 of Cd. The Cd atom is coordinated by one bromine and three iodine atoms, forming a distorted [CdBrI3]2− tetrahedron with a Cd–Br bond length of 2.667(3) Å and a Cd–I bond length of 2.741(3)–2.768(2) Å, respectively (Fig. 1a), which are similar to the related bond lengths in Rb2CdBr2I2. Moreover, the distortion of [CdBrI3]2− is slightly smaller than that of [CdBr2I2]2−, thereby resulting in the dipole moment of [CdBrI3]2− which is smaller than [CdBr2I2]2−, which can be confirmed by the dipole moment calculation results (Table S4, ESI†). As Rb2CdBrI3 is isomorphic to Rb2CdBr2I2, the arrangement of their anionic groups is similar. For Rb2CdBrI3 reported here containing the novel [CdBrI3]2− unit (Fig. 1b and c), all [CdBrI3]2− are aligned along the bc plane, while adjacent [CdI4]2− are staggered and stacked along the a-axis direction. The dipole moments of the two adjacent [CdBrI3]2− are not completely offset, but there is a coupled dipole moment almost parallel to the c-axis direction. Furthermore, the two adjacent [CdBrI3]2− are completely repeated in space to form a crystal structure. Therefore, the arrangement leads to a net dipole moment along the c axis, thereby making substantial SHG responses.

3.3. Optical properties
The IR results indicate that there are no absorption peaks in the range of 4000–500 cm−1 (Fig. S4, ESI†). This result is consistent with our design idea, and thus the transmission range is wider than that of the isomorphic Rb2CdBr2I2. Although there are some deviations in the measurement of the powder samples and the single crystal samples, the infrared absorption edge can basically determine the light transmission range of the compound. These data show that Rb2CdBrI3 is transparent in the mid-infrared region of 3–5 μm (an important atmospheric window), which is favorable for reconnaissance and other civilian applications.
From the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (Fig. 2), the UV cutoff edge of Rb2CdBrI3 is 309 nm, relating to the optical band gap of 4.01 eV, which is consistent with the result calculated by using the tauc plot method (inset of Fig. 2).38 This further proves that halides containing cadmium are often colorless and have a large band gap, resulting in a high LDT. Therefore, this type of halide is a potential candidate for high-laser damage threshold nonlinear optical materials in the mid-infrared band. Notably, this value is larger than that of the isomorphic Rb2CdBr2I2. This is not consistent with the common tendency in the halide family, namely heavy halogen making a narrowed forbidden gap, as evaluated in mixed hybrid perovskite halides. The cause of the abnormal band gap will be revealed and discussed in the following theoretical calculations.

3.4. SHG measurement
The SHG intensity of the compound Rb2CdBrI3 was performed under a 1064 nm irradiation laser by using a modified Kurtz–Perry method. From Fig. 3, it can be noted that the SHG intensity of Rb2CdBrI3 increases with the increase of particle size. When the particle size exceeds 200 microns, it quickly reaches a relatively flat trend, thereby indicating that it can implement a good phase matching behavior under a 1064 nm SHG process, which is very important for the application. At the largest particle size (200–300 μm), the SHG intensity of Rb2CdBrI3 is about twice that of KDP. Therefore, as one iodine substitutes one bromine in Rb2CdBr2I2, the band gap increases but the nonlinearity weakens, which is also consistent with the fact that the band gap and nonlinear intensity are a contradiction. Moreover, we can explore NLO materials with high LDTs by sacrificing certain nonlinearities to improve the band gap. As is known, besides nonlinearity, the crystal length and phase-matching conditions are also the key factor to determine the conversion efficiency. Moreover, a promising nonlinear optical material needs to be able to balance the nonlinear effects and the laser damage threshold. Considering that the large band gaps often lead to weak nonlinear optical coefficients, Rb2CdBrI3 with moderate SHG intensity (2× KDP) in this case can meet basic demands of laser conversion.

3.5. LDT measurement
Since Rb2CdBrI3 exhibits a large band gap, moderate SHG effects and wide transparency, the preliminary LDT value should be obtained to evaluate its potential as an MIR NLO material. Therefore, by using the LDT test method, we measured the powder LDT of Rb2CdBrI3 with a Q-switched laser source (1064 nm, 10 ns, 1 Hz). At the same time, AgGaS2 was used with the same particle size as comparison. The measured powder LDT value was 115 MW cm−2, which was approximately 46 times that of AGS (2.5 MW cm−2). For Rb2CdBr2I2, it is only six times that of AGS (CAUTION: the LDT measurements for the Rb2CdBrI3 and Rb2CdBr2I2 compounds were done under different conditions). Therefore, our synthesized Rb2CdBrI3 is a potential crystal for MIR NLO applications benefiting from its wide transparency, large nonlinearity and especially ultrahigh LDTs.
As is known, 1.06 μm is an important pumping source to obtain a 3 μm laser by IR NLO crystals, which features wide applications in environment monitoring, surgical operation, remote sensing and so on. Here, we measure the basic NLO properties and LDT value of Rb2CdBrI3 under 1.06 μm, providing a feasible evaluation for it. When it is applied in a wide IR region, some issues would be different under various wavelengths, including LDT, SHG coefficients and refractive indices. Even so, our work is still significant in promoting Rb2CdBrI3 as a possible NLO material.
3.6. Thermal analysis
To understand the thermal properties of the crystal, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed. The thermal analysis (Fig. 4) shows that Rb2CdBrI3 is thermally stable at temperatures up to 556 °C, which is superior to most halide NLO materials (CAUTION: the DSC measurement should be carried out to rule out other thermally induced transitions).
 Fig. 4  The TGA of Rb2CdBrI3. 
3.7. Theoretical calculations
To investigate the origin of ultra-high LDTs in Rb2CdBrI3, the theoretical calculations were performed by using density functional theory. As stated before, the LDT is positively dependent on the forbidden gap value, especially for isomorphic compounds with a similar anionic group. Generally, the electronegativity of halogen gradually decreases from Cl (χ = 3.16) to Br (χ = 2.96) to I (χ = 2.66), thereby leading to a narrowed bandgap in iodine-rich compounds. This has been observed in many organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3)SnBr3−xIx39 and (NH4)3Sb2Br9−xIx.40 However, the abnormal forbidden gap enlargement in iodine-rich Rb2CdBrI3 is evaluated using experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. As depicted in Fig. 5, both compounds are direct gap semiconductors, where the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum locate at the G point spontaneously. The simulated bandgap of Rb2CdBrI3 and Rb2CdBr2I2 is 3.76 eV (Fig. 5a) and 3.61 eV (Fig. 5b), respectively. Despite of slight underestimation owing to the shortcomings of PBE functional, this trend is still consistent with the UV-vis diffuse reflection results that Rb2CdBrI3 exhibits an enlarged bandgap. In addition, the top valence bands of the two compounds are basically the same, while the bottom conduction band exhibits divergent dispersion along the three principle axis direction, especially the G–Z direction. Despite of average down-shifted conduction band in Rb2CdBrI3 (see the top blue dot line and top yellow dot line), its conduction band minimum is abnormally up-shifted (see the bottom blue dot line and bottom yellow dot line). In other words, the dispersion energy region (ΔE1) in Rb2CdBrI3 is reduced in contrast to that in Rb2CdBr2I2 (ΔE2), thereby leading to the enlarged bandgap of 0.15 eV (3.76 eV vs. 3.61 eV). Taking into account that they are polar compounds, we also try to build the relationship between band dispersion and dipole moments. The net dipole moments of Rb2CdBrI3 and Rb2CdBr2I2 along the G–Z direction is 0.559 Debye and 1.532 Debye, respectively. Generally, the large polarization induces high carrier mobility and small effective mass, corresponding to the strong band dispersion. Therefore, the reduced polarization may play a significant role in modulating the band dispersion of Rb2CdBrI3.

Furthermore, the partial density of states of Rb2CdBr2I2 and Rb2CdBrI3 are plotted in Fig. 6. The electronic states below the Fermi level of Cd and halogen are basically identical. However, the electronic states in the conduction band are totally different. The Cd 5s orbitals are strongly localized in Rb2CdBrI3 and the peak intensity is slightly higher than that in Rb2CdBr2I2. Meanwhile, the s–p mixing of coordinated halogen is dramatically decreased in Rb2CdBr2I2. As aforementioned, the s–p mixing intensity in the valence band is a core descriptor to evaluate the lone pairs activity, such as Pb(II), Bi(III).41 The large s–p mixing relates to local lone pair with high activity, thereby leading to a weakened valence band dispersion. Here, we try to propose that the s–p mixing intensity in the conduction band may be a representative factor to describe the anti-band states and conduction band dispersion. The larger the s–p mixing intensity, the more enhanced the anti-bond states will be, which is relative to more localized electronic states and weakened band dispersion. This point could be also supported by Mulliken population χmp of Cd–X bond (X = halogen). The χmp of longest Cd–I bond is −0.22, which is lower than the corresponding Cd–Br bond (−0.08). The visualized molecular orbitals in Fig. S5 (ESI†) also display divergent anti-orbitals on changed Cd–X bonds. Therefore, the proposed s–p mixing intensity is a rational and acceptable viewpoint to explain the abnormal bandgap enlargement in Rb2CdBrI3. This changed s–p mixing may be attributed to the bond length difference between Cd–Br and Cd–I bonds, and the special coordination environment of (CdX4) tetrahedron in metal halides.

The calculated refractive index at 1064 nm of Rb2CdBrI3 is 1.888, 1.850, and 1.889 along the x-, y- and z-axes, respectively. The birefringence value between nz and ny is 0.039, comparable to the commercial IR NLO crystal AgGaS2 (0.035) and ZnGeP2 (0.037), which is favourable for broadband phase-matching. Combining with its ultrahigh LDT and wide IR transparency, Rb2CdBrI3 would find many promising applications in the IR NLO frequency conversion and parametric oscillation.
4. Conclusions
In summary, by substituting halogen, a new compound Rb2CdBrI3 with a fundamental building block [CdBrI3]2− was successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. In addition, the simple chemical composition and structure, low cost, easy synthesis method, high LDT and wide MIR transparent window make Rb2CdBrI3 a good candidate for MIR nonlinear optical crystal materials. Moreover, it is further proved that the rational substitution of halogen is a good strategy for regulating the band gap and nonlinearity, which will attract more research interest, and it is expected that more promising members of the simple halide as MIR NLO material will be found. More interestingly, the abnormal bandgap provides a new modulation perspective for the band-sensitive optoelectronic devices, such as hybrid perovskite solar cells with mixed halogens.
