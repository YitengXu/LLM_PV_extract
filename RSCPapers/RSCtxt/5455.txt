    , Accepted 24th January 2021First published on 10th February 2021AbstractColloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks towards the development of cost-effective and high-efficiency photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Unfortunately, the frequent use of QDs possessing heavy metals (e.g. Cd and Pb) in state-of-the-art QD-based PEC technologies is a major obstacle regarding their future commercial perspective. In this work, we synthesized heavy metal-free quaternary CuZnInS3 (CZIS) with variable Cu:Zn ratios and fabricated corresponding QDs-PEC devices via a facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. It is revealed that the tuned CZIS (1Zn) QDs (i.e. Cu:Zn ratio of 1:1) can result in optimized optical properties including enhanced quantum yield, suppressed nonradiative recombination and extended excitonic lifetime. Accordingly, as-fabricated CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoanodes demonstrated increased charge transfer rate and decreased electron transport resistance for improved PEC performance. The results indicate that tuning the composition of heavy metal-free multinary QDs is one of the promising pathways to achieve eco-friendly and high-performance PEC systems for solar hydrogen production.
Introduction
Solar energy has attracted great attention due to its abundance and renewable nature. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells enable efficient solar energy harvesting by converting it into a chemical fuel such as hydrogen, thus representing a promising pathway to address the global energy crisis.1 Numerous semiconducting materials have been widely employed as photoelectrodes in PEC applications; examples include TiO2, CdS, Fe2O3, BiVO4 as photoanodes2–5 and Cu2O, CuBi2O4, Cr2O3, Si as photocathodes.6–10 Specifically, TiO2 has received considerable attention due to its physical/chemical stability against photo-corrosion and suitable conduction and valence band positions with respect to the water redox potential.11 However, the wide band gap of TiO2 (∼3.2 eV) restricts its light absorption to the ultraviolet (UV) region (∼5% power density of the total solar spectrum),12 making it impossible to exploit the visible and near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum.
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are emerging photosensitizers that can largely improve the light absorption of TiO2 due to their size-tunable band gap and broad absorption spectra.13 QD sensitization also results in the formation of suitable electronic band alignment for efficient transfer of photoinduced electrons from QDs to TiO2.14,15 To date, significant progress has been made in the solar-driven PEC devices based on QDs comprised of group II–VI and IV–VI elements (e.g. CdS/Se, PbS).16–19 Photoanodes decorated with PbS/Mn–CdS core/shell QDs reached a photocurrent density as high as ∼22.5 mA cm−2 under one sun illumination (standard air mass 1.5 global, 100 mW cm−2).20 Unfortunately, the highly toxic heavy metals (such as Pb, Cd etc.) give rise to serious environmental and human health issues, hampering their large-scale exploitation.21
Multinary heavy metal-free QDs made up of group I–III–VI,22,23 I–II–III–VI24 and I–II–IV–VI25 elements have attracted a great deal of attention because of their merits, including non-toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and tunable optical properties upon tailored composition,24–28 serving as potential candidates for numerous optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells, PEC cells and photodetectors.12,13,25,27 Among them, as compared to typical ternary heavy metal-free CuInS2 QDs commonly used in eco-friendly optoelectronic devices,24,29 quaternary CuZnInS3 (CZIS) QDs demonstrate outstanding properties with facile composition-tunable optical characteristics,29,30 improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs)31,32 and broader light absorption/emission from UV to NIR,29,33 which are favorable for light emitting and solar energy conversion devices.
So far, CZIS QDs were well developed from the viewpoint of the synthetic techniques24 and their integration in display devices.29 Previous studies have shown optimized optical properties of CZIS QDs, including prolonged excitonic lifetime and increased PLQY, when increasing the content of Zn within a certain range,29,30,34,35 which indicates gradually suppressed non-radiative recombination and is beneficial to solar energy conversion applications such as PEC cells.29 However, by increasing the content of Zn, the enlarged band gap of QDs would limit the range of light absorption, further reducing the device performance due to insufficient photon harvesting. As a result, an optimal value of Zn content is required to maximize the efficiency of CZIS QD-based PEC devices. Understanding the correlation between the Zn content and functionality is still challenging in such quaternary heavy metal-free QDs for solar energy conversion applications.
Herein, we present the synthesis of heavy metal-free quaternary CZIS QDs with tunable optical properties by varying the chemical composition (i.e. the molar ratios of Cu:Zn:In:S = 1:0.5:1:3, 1:1:1:3 and 1:2:1:3, marked 0.5Zn, 1Zn and 2Zn, respectively). We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first-time fabrication of CZIS QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes using a TiO2 mesoporous film and chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach for PEC hydrogen generation. Among different compositions of these heavy metal-free CZIS QDs, CZIS (1Zn) QDs exhibited optimized optical properties including suppressed nonradiative recombination, enhanced PLQY and prolonged PL lifetime. The as-fabricated QD-sensitized PEC device also demonstrated improved charge transfer rate and decreased electron transport resistance, leading to a photocurrent density of ∼3.7 mA cm−2 with a hydrogen generation rate of 34 μmol h−1 cm−2 under standard 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Further optimization by depositing different ZnS passivation layers on CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoelectrodes could achieve a maximum photocurrent density of ∼4.4 mA cm−2 with good device stability as well as a hydrogen production rate of 52 μmol h−1 cm−2. These results suggest that tuning the composition of heavy metal-free quaternary QDs can lead to high-efficiency, cost-effective and eco-friendly PEC cells for solar-driven hydrogen generation.
Results and discussion
A brief description of the experimental processes including synthesis of CZIS QDs, TiO2 mesoporous film preparation and QD-sensitized photoanode fabrication is shown in Scheme 1. Typically, CZIS QDs are synthesized via a facile one-step hot-injection approach (Scheme 1a). Subsequently, the TiO2 blocking layer and mesoporous film were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using spin-coating and tape-casting approaches followed by sintering in air at 500 °C (Scheme 1b). The CZIS QDs were then deposited into mesoporous TiO2 films via the CBD method (Scheme 1c), passivated by ZnS using the SILAR technique36 and covered with epoxy (excluding the active area) to finalize the fabrication of QD-sensitized photoanodes (Scheme 1d).

The representative morphology and crystal structure of CZIS QDs and QDs/TiO2 heterostructure are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1a exhibits the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CZIS (1Zn) QDs, showing a pyramidal shape with an average particle size of (4.2 ± 0.7) nm, as depicted by the corresponding QD size distribution histogram (inset image in Fig. 1a). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of an individual QD is displayed in Fig. 1b, further confirming the pyramidal shape of the as-synthesized QDs, which is consistent with the typical morphology of CuInS/Se QDs.12,37,38 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1c) pattern proves the chalcopyrite structure of CZIS (1Zn) QDs with obvious (112), (220) and (312) planes and corresponding diffraction intensity, which is similar to that of chalcopyrite CuInS2 (Table S1†). The lattice spacing measured from HRTEM images and fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (inset image in Fig. 1b) is 0.316 nm, which lies between 0.319 nm ((112) plane of chalcopyrite CuInS2, JCPDS no. 75-0106) and 0.309 nm ((111) plane of zincblende ZnS, JCPDS no. 03-0570), indicating the successful incorporation of Zn inside the chalcopyrite CuInS2 crystal lattice to form alloyed CZIS QDs.

(d) XRD patterns of CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs with standard XRD profiles of CuInS2 (JCPDS no. 75-0106) and ZnS (JCPDS no. 03-0570). (e) TEM image of the CZIS (1Zn) QDs/TiO2 heterostructure with uniform distribution of CZIS (1Zn) QDs (white dashed circle) on the surface of TiO2. (f) HRTEM of the CZIS (1Zn) QD/TiO2 heterostructure. 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 1d) further provide the evidence for the formation of alloyed CZIS QDs. All the three dominant diffraction peaks in the XRD spectrum are located between the diffraction peaks of CuInS2 (JCPDS no. 75-0106) and ZnS (JCPDS no. 03-0570).39 Such shifted XRD peak maxima towards higher 2θ angles in samples containing Zn, as compared to pristine CuInS2, are indicative of the formation of alloyed quaternary CZIS QDs. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of CZIS (1Zn) QDs (Fig. S1†) further reveals the presence of all the elements including Cu, Zn, In and S. Fig. S2–S4† exhibit the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs, respectively. The detailed chemical states and compositions of CZIS QDs are estimated by analyzing the XPS peak position/shift (Table S2†), which are consistent with previous studies.39,40 The quantitative analysis (Table S2†) based on the semi-quantitative atomic ratio of Cu, Zn, In and S in QDs demonstrated that the stoichiometric ratio of Zn in CZIS QDs is tunable by controlling the amount of the Zn(Ac)2 precursor during the QD synthesis.

Fig. 1e depicts the TEM images of CZIS (1Zn) QDs/TiO2 heterostructures assembled using the CBD technique, showing the intimate attachment and uniform distribution of QDs on TiO2 nanoparticles in mesoporous TiO2 film, which are quite beneficial to the electron transfer from QDs to TiO2.12,41 Besides, the HRTEM image of the CZIS (1Zn) QDs/TiO2 heterostructure (Fig. 1f) shows no observable lattice distortion of QDs, indicating that the CBD method is a mild, safe and efficient approach to sensitize the QDs into TiO2 mesoporous film, as compared to the conventional electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique using a typical 50–200 V bias voltage,42 which requires high voltage equipment as well as dangerous operation during device fabrication.
Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image (Fig. 2a) of the CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode shows that the thickness of the QDs/TiO2 film is ∼21.6 μm. The relevant EDS line profile is exhibited in Fig. 2b, which demonstrates the presence of Cu, Zn, In, S, Ti and O elements in CZIS QD-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 film and their relevant composition variation. Fig. 2c–h present the elemental mapping of all the elements in the CZIS (1Zn) QD-decorated TiO2 photoanode, suggesting the homogeneous distribution of QDs throughout the entire mesoporous TiO2 film.

Optical properties of CZIS QDs with different Zn contents are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a–c exhibit the normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra (under 420 nm excitation) of CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs, respectively, showing broad and asymmetric PL peaks, which are consistent with similar previously reported AgZnInS2 and CuInS2 QD systems.43–46 We fitted these PL peaks using Gaussian functions and obtained two well-fitted peaks marked Peak 1 (purple line) and Peak 2 (brown line), and the parameters including the position, full width at half maximum (FWHM) and area of peaks are summarized in Table S3†. It is observed that each Peak 1 exhibited a smaller FWHM (less than 90 nm) while Peak 2 showed larger FWHMs of more than 110 nm, therefore, Peak 1 and Peak 2 can be attributed to emission from intrinsic trap states43,46 (e.g. Cu vacancies) and surface-related or impurity-related trap states (e.g. Zn substitution at Cu sites),47 respectively. Herein, the CZIS (1Zn) QDs have demonstrated the higher intensity of Peak 1 and lower intensity of Peak 2 as compared to CZIS (0.5Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs, suggesting the presence of less surface-related or impurity-related trap states in CZIS (1Zn) QDs.

Fig. 3d displays the absorption spectra of CZIS QDs with variable Zn content, illustrating the blue-shifted light absorption spectra with increasing Zn concentration, which is indicative of band gap expansion via Zn alloying and consistent with the trend of the blue-shifted PL peaks in Fig. 3a–c. Specifically, the optical band gaps of these CZIS QDs were estimated via Tauc plots14 and found to be 2.0, 2.2, and 2.3 eV for CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs, respectively.
The PL decay of CZIS QDs was measured under 420 nm excitation and the average lifetime was calculated by a fitting procedure, applying the following tri-exponential decay function with decent mathematical convergence (R2 > 0.998):48I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + A3exp(−t/τ3) (Fig. 3e).34,48,49 The fast decay time constants τ1 and τ2 (in the order of few nanoseconds) can be assigned to the non-radiative recombination derived from surface trapping.30 The longer decay time constant (τ3) is ascribed to the radiative recombination between delocalized conduction band electrons and localized holes originating from intrinsic defect states.29,30 The constants A1, A2 and A3 represent the fitting coefficients of the PL decay and the average lifetime τav is calculated as ∑Aiτi2/∑Aiτi.35,46,50 The detailed fitting results are summarized in Table 1, in which the CZIS (1Zn) QDs show smaller values of A1 and A2 together with a larger value of A3 when compared to CZIS (0.5Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs, manifesting the suppressed non-radiative recombination that results in prolonged lifetime of CZIS (1Zn) QDs.30,34 To investigate the dependence of the emission lifetime on the excitation wavelength, we also measured the PL decay of CZIS (1Zn) QDs under 510 nm excitation, as shown in Fig. S6†. We fitted and compared the PL decay under 420 and 510 nm by using identical tri-exponential decay function (Table S4†), which demonstrates no significant change of the emission lifetime, indicating that the optimized CZIS (1Zn) QDs possess emission lifetime independent of the excitation wavelength.

The PLQY of QDs was measured (Fig. S7†) and among different compositions of CZIS, CZIS (1Zn) QDs exhibited higher PLQY. The prolonged lifetime and higher PLQY of CZIS (1Zn) QDs indicate that the Zn incorporation can effectively passivate surface defects and increase intragap impurity trap states (mainly copper vacancy (VCu)), thus resulting in suppressed non-radiative recombination and enhanced radiative recombination.29,34 However, when more Zn cations are introduced into the QD lattice, severe lattice distortion and more complex defects (e.g. ZnCu and ZnIn) appear and lead to more non-radiative recombination paths for shorter PL lifetime and lower PLQY.34,35,45,51 It is worth noting that the suppressed non-radiative recombination and prolonged lifetime of optimized CZIS (1Zn) QDs can result in efficient separation of photoexcited charge carriers, which is much favorable for enhancing the photoelectric conversion efficiency of corresponding QD-based PEC devices.11
A conventional three-electrode configuration is used to assess the PEC performance of CZIS QD-sensitized photoanodes. Fig. 4a shows the corresponding schematic diagram of the CZIS QD-based PEC system, wherein the electrolyte composed of a mixture of Na2S (0.25 M) and Na2SO3 (0.35 M) was utilized as a sacrificial hole scavenger.12,52 The band alignment of CZIS QDs with respect to TiO2 was deduced using the optical band gaps calculated from the absorption spectrum (Tauc plot) (Fig. 3d) and the conduction band position obtained from Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. S8†).53 The positive slopes of Mott–Schottky plots imply that the CZIS QDs are n-type semiconductors, and the positions of the conduction band minimum of the CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QDs were estimated to be −1.28 V, −1.30 V and −1.33 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), respectively. All the CZIS QDs form a type II band alignment with TiO2, which is beneficial for the efficient charge separation and transfer from QDs to TiO2 in such QD-based PEC systems.

Besides, the donor density (ND) of the quantum dot samples can be estimated from the equation:54ND = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1, where e0, ε0 and ε represent the electron charge, the permittivity of vacuum and the dielectric constant of materials, respectively, and [d(1/C2)/dV]−1 represents the reciprocal of the slope from Mott–Schottky curves. It is indicated that a smaller slope of Mott–Schottky curves represents a higher donor density. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S5,† CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoanodes exhibit higher ND due to the smaller slope of the relevant Mott–Schottky curves, thus demonstrating both improved conductivity and increased electric field for enhancing photogenerated charge collection and separation efficiency.55,56
To understand the charge dynamics between QDs and TiO2, the electron transfer rate constants (ket) of various CZIS QD-sensitized photoanodes were estimated via transient fluorescence spectroscopy (under 420 nm excitation)57,58 (Fig. 4b–d) and calculated using the equation42,57–59 1/τQDs/TiO2 − 1/τQDs/ZrO2, where τQDs/TiO2 and τQDs/ZrO2 represent the average lifetime of QDs deposited in TiO2 and ZrO2 films by the CBD method, respectively. Herein, ZrO2 can be used as a benchmark material to inhibit the electron injection from the QDs due to its high conduction band edge, thus resulting in longer decay time of charge carriers in QDs/ZrO2 as compared to QDs/TiO2 and enabling quantitative calculation of electron transfer rate.42 The fitting parameters (Table S6†) and calculated results in Table 2 show a higher ket of the CZIS (1Zn) QD sample than that of CZIS (0.5Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QD samples, indicating more effective charge transfer from CZIS (1Zn) QDs to TiO2, matching well with the optimized optical properties of CZIS (1Zn) QDs including suppressed non-radiative recombination and prolonged PL lifetime. As the longest lifetime of the PL emission is an important factor for the radiative recombination, we further calculated the charge transfer rate constants using the fitted longest lifetime constant of τ3, as shown in Table S6†. The results demonstrated more effective charge transfer from CZIS (1Zn) QDs to TiO2, which is consistent with the charge transfer kinetics calculated using the average PL lifetime.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 5a) was further used to investigate the electron transport property of CZIS QD-based photoelectrodes. The CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanode exhibits 50% lower electron transport resistance among all the samples in the fitted equivalent circuit (inset of Fig. 5a), where R0 consists of the sheet resistance of device substrates, contact resistance and external circuit resistance in the system, R1 represents the charge transfer resistance of QD-photoanodes and CPE1 is the chemical capacitance,60 summarized in Table S7†. The lower electron transport resistance is in accordance with the smaller slope in the Mott–Schottky curves of the CZIS (1Zn) QD sample (Fig. S8†), indicating the higher donor density (improved conductivity), enhanced electron transport and suppressed electron–hole recombination.41,61 Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) photoanodes were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b, wherein the CZIS (1Zn) QDs/TiO2 photoanode exhibits the highest photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies in the visible region (from 380 to 560 nm). Note that the CZIS (0.5Zn) QDs/TiO2 photoanode shows slightly higher conversion efficiencies over 560 nm than the CZIS (1Zn) QDs/TiO2 photoanode, which can be due to the broader light absorption of CZIS (0.5Zn) QDs with lower Zn content. All these results suggest that heavy metal-free quaternary CZIS (1Zn) QDs having an optimized composition are favorable for boosting the PEC performance.

(f) H2 yield from theory and experimental data measured using CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes during 2 h illumination under an applied bias of 0.6 V (vs. RHE). 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of CZIS (0.5Zn), CZIS (1Zn) and CZIS (2Zn) QD-based photoanodes are measured under standard 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), as displayed in Fig. 5c–e. It can be noted that there are still distinct dark currents from −0.2 V to 0.6 V (vs. RHE) in the J–V measurements of all the QD-based photoanodes without light illumination. To identify the nature of the dark current, we further carried out the J–V measurement of bare TiO2/FTO substrates, as shown in Fig. S9†, which exhibits similar dark current obtained from an identical potential range, indicating that such dark currents originate from the TiO2/FTO substrates other than the QDs. These dark currents may be due to the side reactions of TiO2/FTO substrates (e.g., residual polymer in TiO2 paste) during the electrochemical measurements.62
The CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes show a maximum photocurrent density of ∼3.7 mA cm−2, which is comparable to other multinary heavy metal-free QDs (Table S8†) and higher than CZIS(0.5Zn) and CZIS(2Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes exhibiting photocurrent densities of ∼2.8 mA cm−2 and ∼2.1 mA cm−2, respectively. We attribute the enhanced photocurrent density of the CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoelectrode to the optimized composition-dependent optical properties and electron transfer dynamics of such quaternary QDs.
As compared to the PEC performance of the CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanode assembled via the EPD method (Fig. S10 and Table S9†), the CBD-deposited devices show comparable saturated photocurrent density without applying any bias voltage during device fabrication, indicating that the CBD is a promising technique to realize high performance QD-based solar energy conversion applications. The experimental and theoretical hydrogen generation rates of CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes (Fig. 5f) were measured and estimated using the gas chromatography (GC) system and as-obtained I–t curves for 2 hours (Fig. S11†), respectively, showing theoretical and experimental hydrogen production rates of 44 μmol h−1 cm−2 and 34 μmol h−1 cm−2 with calculated Faraday efficiency of 77%.
In order to further improve the PEC performance of CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoanode, various ZnS monolayers were deposited to passivate the device via the SILAR method, as demonstrated in our recent work.36 As displayed in Fig. 6a, the CZIS (1Zn) QD sample with 6 ZnS monolayers exhibits optimized photocurrent density of ∼4.4 mA cm−2 compared to those of 4.1 and 3.9 mA cm−2 (Fig. S12†) with 4 and 8 ZnS monolayers, respectively. Fig. 6b shows the corresponding device stability (normalized photocurrent density as a function of time) of CZIS (1Zn) QD-based devices with various ZnS monolayers, in which the optimized 6 ZnS monolayer sample retained 71% of its initial photocurrent density after 2 hours.
 Fig. 6  (a) PEC measurements of CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes coated with 6 ZnS monolayers in the dark, and under continuous and chopped illumination, respectively (AM 1.5 G illumination, 100 mW cm−2). (b) Normalized photocurrent density as a function of time for CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes coated with 2, 4, 6 and 8 ZnS monolayers, respectively, which were tested during 2 h illumination under an applied bias of 0.6 V (vs. RHE). (c) H2 yield from theory and experimental data measured using CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes coated with 6 ZnS monolayers during 2 h illumination under an applied bias of 0.6 V (vs. RHE). 
EDS spectra were obtained to provide the quantitative elemental data of the QD-based photoanode samples with different ZnS passivation layers, as shown in Fig. S13 and Table S10†. The atomic concentrations of Zn and S increase for 2, 4, 6 and 8 ZnS monolayer-treated samples, indicating the growth of thicker ZnS passivation layers on CZIS (1Zn) QD-photoanodes. As exhibited in Fig. 6b, the device stability is improved from 2 ZnS to 8 ZnS monolayer samples, demonstrating that the thicker ZnS passivation layers are more efficient in preventing the photocorrosion of QD-photoanodes for enhanced device durability. For the effect of different ZnS passivation layers on the photocurrent density of QD-photoanodes (Fig. 5d, 6a and S12†), the deposition of 2 and 4 ZnS monolayers on QD-devices yields lower photocurrent densities than that of 6 ZnS monolayers, which is still insufficient to passivate the photoanodes and provide the effective transfer of photo-induced electrons from QDs to TiO2. The 6 ZnS monolayer sample can provide optimal charge transfer and the highest photocurrent densities, while the 8 ZnS monolayer sample further showed a lower photocurrent density, which is ascribed to the fact that the thicker ZnS monolayers can act as a blocking barrier to reduce the charge transfer efficiency from the QDs to TiO2.36
Such a PEC performance of the 6ZnS-treated CZIS (1Zn) QD PEC device including saturated photocurrent density and device stability is also comparable to other state-of-the-art multinary copper-based heavy metal-free QD-based PEC devices, as listed in Table S8†. Fig. 6c exhibits the relevant hydrogen production rates of 6 ZnS monolayer-treated CZIS (1Zn) QD-sensitized photoanodes, showing theoretical and experimental hydrogen production rates of 57 μmol h−1 cm−2 and 52 μmol h−1 cm−2 with a calculated Faraday efficiency of 91%.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. S14a†, the device can still show a saturated photocurrent density of ∼1 mA cm−2 in neutral and mild electrolyte solutions (Na2SO4, pH ∼ 7) other than a corrosive electrolyte solution (Na2S/Na2SO3, pH ∼ 12.5) acting as hole scavengers.
Conclusions
In conclusion, eco-friendly quaternary CZIS QDs with various Zn contents were synthesized and employed for solar-driven PEC H2 generation. As-synthesized QDs showed composition-tunable optical properties and were homogeneously deposited inside mesoporous TiO2 films to fabricate PEC photoanodes via a facile CBD method. As compared to the CZIS (0.5Zn) and (2Zn) QDs, the higher saturated photocurrent density of the CZIS (1Zn) QD-based photoanode is ascribed to the composition-tuned optical properties of QDs (e.g. prolonged PL lifetime) and enhanced charge transfer of corresponding QD-decorated photoanodes. The results provide insights into the role of composition tuning towards heavy metal-free multinary QDs for high performance eco-friendly QD-based PEC applications. Future work may focus on the surface passivation of CZIS (1Zn) QDs using core/shell structures to further alleviate the surface defects, obtain better charge separation by engineering the band alignment of core/shell QDs (i.e. type II band alignment) and restrain non-radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs for improved PEC performance.
