    , Accepted 27th September 2016First published on 28th September 2016AbstractBroad absorption spectra and small optical bandgaps of polymer electron acceptors are very important for the sunlight harvesting of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). Conjugated polymers based on the double B ← N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit are a new class of polymer electron acceptors, which suffer from narrow absorption spectra and large bandgaps. In this manuscript, we report a new polymer electron acceptor (P-BNBP-DPP) based on the BNBP unit and the dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit with a small bandgap and improved sunlight-harvesting capability. P-BNBP-DPP exhibits a broad absorption band with the onset absorbance at 796 nm and a small optical bandgap of 1.56 eV. Moreover, P-BNBP-DPP shows the low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of −3.87 eV/−5.45 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. An all-PSC device with P-BNBP-DPP as the acceptor and poly[(ethylhexyl-oxy)-benzodithiophene-(ethylhexyl)-thienothiophene] (PTB7) as the donor produces a power conversion efficiency of 2.69% with a broad external quantum efficiency response in the range of 300–800 nm. These results suggest an effective approach to tune the absorption spectra of BNBP-based polymer electron acceptors.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which use a blend of a polymer electron donor and a polymer electron acceptor as an active layer, have received great attention.1 Compared with conventional polymer solar cells with fullerene derivatives as the electron acceptors, all-PSCs have the great advantage of enhanced sunlight absorption of polymer electron acceptors.2 In contrast to the weak light absorption in the visible range of fullerene derivatives, e.g. phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), polymer acceptors always show strong absorption in the visible/near infrared region, which improves sunlight harvesting and enables high power conversion efficiency (PCE).2 For example, the state-of-the-art polymer electron acceptor, (poly((N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2-bithiophene))) (N2200 or P(NDI2ODT2)), exhibits two strong absorption bands at 392 nm and 700 nm with a low bandgap of 1.48 eV.3 Li et al. have demonstrated a PCE of over 8% for all-PSCs using N2200 as the polymer electron acceptor.4
Efficient polymer electron acceptors use rylene diimides, such as perylene diimide (PDI) and naphthalene diimide (NDI), as the electron-deficient building blocks.2,5 We have proposed a novel strategy to develop polymer electron acceptors using the boron–nitrogen coordination bond (B ← N).6 We have also developed a new kind of polymer acceptors based on double B ← N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) as the electron-deficient building block.7 BNBP-based polymers exhibit delocalized LUMOs over the whole conjugated polymer backbones, which are different from the localized LUMOs of the state-of-the-art NDI-based polymer electron acceptors. As a result, BNBP-based polymer electron acceptors exhibit tunable LUMO energy levels and consequently show remarkably high open-circuit voltage (Voc) at extremely small photon energy loss.7 However, all the reported BNBP-based conjugated polymers exhibit narrow absorption spectra and large bandgaps (Eg = ca. 1.9 eV), which are not desirable for sunlight harvesting. It remains a challenge to develop BNBP-based polymer electron acceptors with wide absorption spectra and small bandgaps.
Dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is a well-known small-bandgap unit and has been widely used to design polymer electron donors.8 Conjugated polymers based on the DPP unit generally show Eg in the range of 1.3–1.5 eV. Very recently, Janssen et al. and Li et al. have demonstrated the utility of DPP-containing polymers as electron acceptors for all-PSCs.9
In this manuscript, we copolymerize the BNBP unit and the DPP unit to develop a new polymer electron acceptor with a small bandgap and improved sunlight-harvesting capability. The resulting polymer, P-BNBP-DPP, exhibits a broad absorption band with the onset absorbance at 796 nm and a small optical bandgap of 1.56 eV. An all-PSC device with P-BNBP-DPP as the acceptor shows a broad external quantum efficiency (EQE) response in the range of 300–800 nm. Since low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels and high electron mobilities have already been demonstrated for BNBP-based polymers, the excellent sunlight-harvesting capability reported here indicates that BNBP-based polymers are a series of promising electron acceptors for all-PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route of P-BNBP-DPP is shown in Scheme 1. The two monomers were prepared following the literature methods and the polymer was synthesized under Stille-polymerization conditions.7,10 The chemical structure of P-BNBP-DPP is verified by high-temperature 1H NMR and elemental analysis. According to gel permeation chromotography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI) of P-BNBP-DPP are 11.0 kDa and 2.05, respectively. P-BNBP-DPP shows good thermal stability with thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight loss of 400 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere according to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (ESI†). The polymer shows good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).

Photophysical properties
The UV/Vis absorption spectra of P-BNBP-DPP and P-BNBP-T in CHCl3 solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and the characteristics are listed in Table 1. In CHCl3 solutions, while P-BNBP-T shows a narrow absorption band with the main peak at 589 nm and a shoulder at 545 nm,7aP-BNBP-DPP shows a redshifted and broad absorption band with the absorption maximum at 760 nm and a shoulder at 688 nm. Two vibronic bands observed for both of P-BNBP-T and P-BNBP-DPP are probably assigned to 0 → 0 and 0 → 1 transitions.11 While P-BNBP-T shows the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of 40 nm of the absorption spectrum, P-BNBP-DPP shows a shoulder FWHM of 116 nm. This indicates that the incorporation of the DPP unit into the backbone greatly changes the electronic structure of the resulting polymer. In thin films, P-BNBP-DPP shows a similar absorption spectrum to that in solution, suggesting that the polymers have already formed aggregation in solution. P-BNBP-DPP exhibits the onset absorption at 796 nm, corresponding to the optical bandgap of 1.56 eV, which is smaller than that of P-BNBP-T (Eg = 1.92 eV). Eg of P-BNBP-DPP is fairly comparable to that of the widely-used polymer electron acceptor, N2200 (Eg = 1.48 eV).3,4 The redshifted and broad absorption spectrum of P-BNBP-DPP is favourable for sunlight harvesting in polymer solar cells.

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was employed to estimate the LUMO/HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/HOMO) of P-BNBP-DPP and P-BNBP-T. As shown in Fig. 2, P-BNBP-DPP shows the reduction and oxidation processes with the onset reduction/oxidation potentials (Eredonset/Eoxonset) of −0.93 V/+0.65 V. According to the empirical formula (ELUMO/HOMO = −(4.80 + Eredonset/Eoxonset) eV),7 the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of P-BNBP-DPP are estimated to be −3.87 eV/−5.45 eV. As listed in Table 1, P-BNBP-DPP exhibits the lower ELUMO and higher EHOMO than those of P-BNBP-T (−3.50 eV/−5.77 eV), which is attributed to the incorporation of the DPP unit into the polymer backbone.

Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory were performed to investigate the molecular configuration and electronic structure of P-BNBP-DPP.12 To simplify the calculation, a model compound with four repeating units and methyl side chains was employed. As shown in Fig. 3, P-BNBP-DPP exhibits a pseudo-straight polymer backbone configuration. The HOMO is localized on the DPP units and the LUMO is delocalized over both the BNBP units and the DPP units. This indicates that the DPP unit can affect both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P-BNBP-DPP, which is consistent with the CV measurements. BNBP-based conjugated polymers always exhibit delocalized LUMOs,7 which is totally different from the localized LUMO on the naphthalene diimide units in the state-of-the-art polymer electron acceptors based on the NDI unit.3,5 The delocalized LUMO is also observed in the model compound of P-BNBP-DPP.

Charge transporting properties
The electron mobilities (μe) of P-BNBP-DPP and P-BNBP-T were estimated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the current density–voltage curves of the electron-only devices (ESI†).13μe is 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P-BNBP-DPP, which is higher than that of P-BNBP-T (μe = 6.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) (Table 1). The high μe of P-BNBP-DPP may be attributed to the planar DPP unit and the pseudo-straight polymer configuration, which improve the solid state stacking of polymer backbones. μe of P-BNBP-DPP is fairly comparable to the hole mobilities of many polymer donors, suggesting that μe of P-BNBP-DPP is adequate for application in all-PSCs.
Photovoltaic properties and characterization
Poly[(ethylhexyl-oxy)-benzodithiophene-(ethylhexyl)-thienothiophene] (PTB7) is a widely-used polymer donor and exhibits high PCEs in PSC devices with fullerene derivatives as acceptors (Scheme 1).14 We select PTB7 as the polymer donor to blend with P-BNBP-DPP to fabricate all-PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4a, PTB7 shows strong absorption in the range of 500–700 nm. The absorption spectrum of P-BNBP-DPP with the absorbance maximum at 760 nm is complementary with that of PTB7. The complementary absorption spectra of the PTB7 and P-BNBP-DPP blend are very desirable for efficient harvesting of sunlight. The PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP (w:w, 2:1) blend film exhibits a broad absorption band from 300 to 800 nm. Moreover, the ELUMO/HOMO values of P-BNBP-DPP are lower than that of PTB7 by 0.56 eV/0.22 eV (Fig. 4b), which could enable efficient photo-induced electron/hole transfer between the two polymers.

All-PSC devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP/LiF/Al (Fig. 4c). The active layer was spin-coated from the solution of polymer donor:acceptor in CHCl3 without any additive. Fig. 5 displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices. The device characteristics are summarized in Table 2.

The PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP (w:w, 1:1) device shows a PCE of 2.11% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.48 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.45. Optimization of the donor:acceptor weight ratios produces the optimal PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP (w:w, 2:1) device with an enhanced PCE of 2.69% and an increased Jsc of 7.54 mA cm−2. The three all-PSC devices all show the broad EQE response from 300 nm to 800 nm, contributed from both the absorptions of the polymer donor and the polymer acceptor. The optimal device has a maximum EQE of 0.37 at 692 nm. The Jsc values calculated from the integration of EQE spectra agree well with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V scans within an error of 5%. The charge transport properties of the PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP (w:w, 2:1) blend were investigated using the SCLC method with the electron-only and hole-only devices (ESI†). The electron mobility and hole mobility (μh) of the blend are 1.38 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.37 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively low electron mobility and unbalanced charge carrier mobilities are in accordance with the moderate Jsc and FF values of the all-PSC devices.
The morphology of the PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP (w:w, 2:1) blend was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6). The AFM phase image reveals the uniform blend morphology and no phase separation can be observed. The AFM height image shows the smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.84 nm, suggesting that the polymers are well mixed in the film. In the TEM image, the nanostructures with worm-like fibrous aggregation are observed, indicating that the polymers are partially crystallized in the blend film.

The molecular packing of the donor:acceptor polymers in the blend film was monitored by the grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and in-plane X-ray diffraction (IP-XRD) (Fig. 7). The GI-XRD pattern of the pristine P-BNBP-DPP film shows the (010) diffraction at 2θ = 23.23° along the out-of-plane direction, and the IP-XRD pattern of the pristine film exhibits the intense (100) diffraction at 2θ = 4.08° along the in-plane direction. The (100) and (010) diffractions indicate a lamellar packing distance of 2.16 nm and a π–π stacking distance of 0.38 nm, respectively. Moreover, P-BNBP-DPP adopts the face-on orientation in the pristine film. The PTB7 pristine film exhibits weak crystallinity with the (010) diffraction at 2θ = 22.30° (dπ–π = 0.40 nm) along the out-of-plane direction. For the PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP blend film, the (010) diffraction at 2θ = 22.73° along the out-of-plane direction and the (100) diffraction at 2θ = 4.10° along the in-plane direction are observed, suggesting that the donor and acceptor polymers adopt the face-on orientation in the blend film. The (100) diffraction peak of the blend is broad and weak compared to that of pristine P-BNBP-DPP, indicating the decreased crystallinity of P-BNBP-DPP in the blend. This is in accordance with the well mixed morphology in the AFM phase and height images. Further optimization of the blend morphology is in progress to improve the all-PSC device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a novel low-bandgap polymer electron acceptor based on the BNBP unit and the DPP unit for all-PSCs. Owing to the DPP unit, the polymer exhibits a broad absorption band from 500 to 800 nm with an optical bandgap of only 1.56 eV, which is much lower than that of typical BNBP-based polymers. P-BNBP-DPP shows the low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of −3.87 eV/−5.45 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The all-PSC devices with P-BNBP-DPP as the acceptor and PTB7 as the donor produce a PCE of 2.69% and a broad EQE response in the range of 300–800 nm. These results suggest an effective approach to tune the absorption properties of BNBP-based polymer electron acceptors.
Experimental section
Materials
Bis(trimethylstannyl)dithienyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole monomers, dibromo-substituted BNBP monomers and P-BNBP-T were prepared according to the reported literature procedures.7a,10 Commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification unless stated otherwise.
Measurements and characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz for 1H) spectrometer in C6D4Cl2 at 100 °C. Elemental analysis was performed using a VarioEL elemental analyzer. The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a PL-GPC 220-type at a temperature of 150 °C. 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene (TCB) was used as the eluent and monodisperse polystyrene was used as the standard. UV/Vis absorption spectra were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer in spectral grade solvents. Thermal analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 7 instrument under nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image was obtained using a JEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a SPA300HV (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) in tapping mode. GI-XRD data were obtained on a Bruker D8 Discover reflector (Cu Kα, λ = 1.54056 Å) under 40 kV and 40 mA tube current. The IP-XRD data were obtained by using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and a 30 mA tube current. The measurement was obtained in a scanning interval of 2θ between 2° and 30°. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660a electrochemical workstation using Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M) in acetonitrile as the electrolyte solution and ferrocene as an internal reference at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The CV cell consisted of a glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The polymer was cast on the working electrode for measurements. The redox potentials were calibrated with ferrocene as an internal standard. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the materials were estimated by the equations: EHOMO/LUMO = −(4.80 + Eoxonset/Eredonset) eV.
Synthesis

Polymer P-BNBP-DPP. 
Starting materials of the BNBP monomer (109.1 mg, 0.123 mmol), the DPP monomer (104.7 mg, 0.123 mmol), Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (2.6 mg, 0.0025 mmol) and P(o-Tolyl)3 (6.0 mg, 0.02 mmol) were placed in a two-necked flask under argon, and then dried toluene (10 mL) was added. After the mixture being stirred at 120 °C for 24 h, the end-capping reaction was carried out by adding the DPP monomer (5.2 mg, 0.006 mmol) and then bromobenzene (200 mg, 1.28 mmol). After cooling, the resulting organic phase was extracted with CHCl3 (100 mL) and washed with water. After the solvents being removed, the residue was dispersed in acetonitrile and the precipitate was collected. The polymer was purified by the Soxhlet extraction with acetone, hexane and CHCl3. The polymer P-BNBP-DPP in the CHCl3 solution was collected and dried in a vacuum overnight.

Fabrication and characterization of all-polymer solar cells. 
PTB7 was purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. and used as received. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by drying at 120 °C for 30 min and treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. Then PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P Al 4083) was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrates at 5000 rpm for 40 s to give a thickness of 40 nm, followed by baking at 120 °C for 30 min. The substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. A solution containing a mixture of PTB7:P-BNBP-DPP in CHCl3 was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to produce an active layer (∼100 nm). The active layer was annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. Finally, the device was transferred to a vacuum chamber, and LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) was sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of about 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of each device was 8 mm2. The current density (J–V) curves were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G simulated solar light illumination provided by a XES-40S2-CE Class Solar Simulator (Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd). The EQE spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a calibrated monosilicon diode.
