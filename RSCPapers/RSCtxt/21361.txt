    , Accepted 9th February 2022First published on 9th February 2022AbstractAlthough organic photovoltaic (OPV) molecules containing non-covalent conformational locks (NCLs) are demonstrated with superior device scale charge transport, the NCLs’ working mechanism at the molecular level has not been directly addressed or revealed. Herein, three widely used OPV building blocks DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT were prepared and comparatively researched for their intra-molecule charge transport (ICT) based on single molecular conductance measurements and theoretical calculation. The measured conductance (G) of the three molecules displays an order of GDT-BT < GDT-FBT < GDT-OBT, contradicting the conductivity order predicted by tunnelling theory. Further research demonstrated that this change was mainly caused by NCLs embedded in DT-FBT and DT-OBT, resulting in more efficient charge transporting pathways, evidenced by their HOMOs showing hyper-conjugation characteristics.
With recent advances in organic photovoltaic materials and device engineering, especially the development of non-fullerene acceptors,1–4 rapid progress has been made in this field and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved an unprecedentedly high level. In order to match well with the non-fullerene acceptors, the donor materials also need to be rationally designed and synthesized to improve the charge mobility. Compared with other widely adopted electron-deficient building blocks in donor materials,5,6 benzothiazide (BT) can be flanked with different electron-affinity side chain groups, offering flexibility to tune the energy levels and absorption range. Difluorobenzothiazide (FBT)7 or dialkoxybenzothiazine (OBT)8a utilized electron-deficient fluorine atoms or electron-rich alkoxy group units as substitution groups. After connecting two thiophene π bridging units to the BT, FBT, and OBT core at the 1,4 position, DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT (Scheme 1) are often used in the structure of the donor materials for OSC applications.8–11 There are several fascinating features for this molecular structure designing strategy. Apart from the substituent groups’ potential to well-tune their energy levels and band gaps to form well-matched energy alignment with the acceptor materials,10,12 multiple NCLs featuring S–F and S–O interatomic interactions are introduced into the backbone, which is thought to facilitate π-electron delocalization and π–π stacking.9 Consequently, NCLs were employed with great success to prepare various types of functional materials of highly efficient charge transporting ability, which had been mostly evaluated through investigation of their charge transport behaviour in the condensed solid state.13–16 However, the influence of NCLs on charge transfer at the single molecule level has not been directly addressed and revealed before, which could potentially provide new insights into the role of NCLs to improve the charge transport of solar cells at the molecular scale.
 Scheme 1  The structure of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT. 
Single molecular conductance measurement (SMCM) is a powerful tool to examine the charge transport properties of single molecules between two metal electrodes, such as mechanically controlled break junction (MCBJ),17 scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) based break junction (BJ)18,19 and fixed junction (FJ)20 techniques. As an important prerequisite for carrying out such research, introducing extra linker groups into the target molecules was required to form stable and robust metal-molecule linkage,18b dedicated to ensuring reproducible junction formation. However, the externally added linkers would unavoidably cause molecule orbital deviation relative to the initial structures, and thus obscure the study of their intrinsic electronic characteristics. Fortunately, thiophene not only constitutes the basic units in the OSC structures, but also was extensively used as a linkage to bind the Au electrode via its electron-rich S atom.21 Motivated by this, we designed three model molecules DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT (Scheme 1) which are often adopted as building units in OSC structure design. These molecules were obtained via one step Suzuki reaction (see the ESI,† Scheme S1). More importantly, they can be directly used to research their single molecule level charge transport properties via SMCM without the need of functionalizing external anchors. Given that the F and alkoxy substitution groups in DT-FBT and DT-OBT led to NCLs formed based on F–S and O–S interatomic interaction, these structures thus provide a desired platform to examine NCLs’ influence on their ICT capacity, which could be directly reflected by the measured conductance.
Here, we employ the STM-based fixed junction (FJ) method20,22,23 to measure the conductance of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT. In contrast to the STM-BJ technique, the FJ method could provide a relatively stable fixed-gap for the detection of single molecules with less disturbance to the molecular conformation. The measurements were carried out at an initial set-point current of 5 nA (corresponding to a gap distance of ∼0.83 nm,22 very close to the molecular length of 0.76–0.78 nm as listed in Table 1). The choice of gap size was dictated by the optimized signal frequency measured at a series of gap conditions, as depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Typical current switching signals can be observed in measurements of DT-BT, DT-FBT or DT-OBT, while no signals are shown in the blank control experiment (Fig. S2, ESI†). Statistical analysis of the signal amplitudes shows conductance values of 8.8 ± 4.4 nS, 11.1 ± 6.2 nS and 14.3 ± 7.8 nS, respectively, for DT-BT, DT-FBT and DT-OBT, as shown in Fig. 1a. Repeated experiments are also carried out to show the reproducibility of the single molecule conductance of three molecules measured in these fixed-gap junctions (Fig. 1b). A conductivity order of GDT-OBT > GDT-FBT > GDT-BT is clearly shown. In addition, we find that the signal frequency for DT-BT is much higher than the other two molecules with the additional side groups (Fig. S1, ESI†), which might suggest an effect of steric hindrance of the side groups in the formation of single molecule junctions.

 Fig. 1  (a) The conductance of DT-BT (8.8 ± 4.4 nS), DT-FBT (11.1 ± 6.2 nS), and DT-OBT (14.3 ± 7.8 nS) at a set-point current of 5 nA, and (b) the repeated results for their conductance. 
To rationalize the conductivity trend of the three molecules, we first compared the planarity of the three molecules by scanning the molecular energy at different dihedral angles using the B3LYP method within the Gaussian package (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The resulting dihedral angles θ1 and θ2 for the energy-favoured geometries of the three molecules are listed in Table 1. In contrast to the anticipation that NCLs improve the molecular planarity, we find that DT-BT and DT-FBT are almost flat with their dihedral angles close to zero (Fig. 2), while DT-OBT exhibits the largest dihedral angle, which is undoubtedly related to the long alkyl chain that could cause steric hindrance. According to the conductance prediction of dihedral angles with a cos2θ relation,24 the conductance ratio for GDT-BT:GDT-FBT:GDT-OBT should be 1:1:0.76, which is obviously different from the experimental findings. This excludes the molecular planarity as a possible explanation for the conductance difference between the three molecules.

Next, we investigated the electrochemical properties of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT with cyclic voltammetry to examine their energy levels. From the cyclic voltammograms shown in Fig. 3a, we obtained the redox onset potential to be 1.35 eV, 1.53 eV, and 1.31 eV (marked with an arrow) for DT-BT, DT-FBT and DT-OBT. According to the equation of HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.8 − EFc) (eV),25 where the measured EFc = 0.53 eV, the HOMO energy levels for DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT are estimated to be −5.62 eV, −5.80 eV, and −5.58 eV. The optical properties of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). All three molecules show two similar absorption peaks at 315 and 400–460 nm, which originate from the absorption of their molecular skeleton and the intra-molecular charge transferring state, respectively. Correspondingly, their optical band gaps (Eoptg) inferred from their absorption edge are 2.41, 2.56, and 2.48 eV for DT-BT, DT-FBT and DT-OBT. Consequently, their lowest unoccupied molecule orbital (LUMO) levels can be calculated from the sum of HOMO and Eoptg, which are −3.21 eV, −3.24 eV, and −3.10 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels for the three molecules are summarized in Fig. 3b together with the Au Fermi energy level (EF).26 From the diagram, we see that the HOMOs lie closer to the EF rather than their LUMOs, implying that their HOMOs are the dominant charge conducting channels.26,27 Although there are many uncertainties in such estimates, the qualitative CV-based conclusions that the HOMOs are closer to EF are supported by calculations (see below). In addition, the tunnelling barrier (ε0) for DT-FBT, DT-BT, and DT-OBT is gradually lowered (Fig. 3b), and thus the electronic coupling intensity (Γ) between the HOMO and EF would increase.26 According to the single-Lorentzian model: G = G0/[(ε0/Γ)2 + 1], the conductivity trend for the three molecules would be: GDT-OBT > GDT-BT > GDT-FBT. This trend agrees with the experimental findings that DT-OBT yields the highest conductance among the three molecules but displays a reversed trend for DT-BT and DT-FBT. Intuitively, the electron-deficient F substituents generally lower the HOMO level, which widens the hole tunnelling barrier and thus impairs the HOMO-mediated charge transport.28 However, the experimental results show otherwise for DT-FBT. This suggests that some undetermined factors associated with NCLs could be involved in their conductance.
 Fig. 3  (a) The cyclic voltammetry curve of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT, and (b) the experimental energy level diagram of DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT relative to the Au Fermi energy level. 
As summarized in Table 1, the S–F and S–O distances for the optimized structures of DT-FBT and DT-OBT are 2.73 and 2.77 Å (SI), which increased to 2.88 and 2.85 Å after the molecules were immobilized between two electrodes. This implies that the coordination of S towards Au affects the S–F and S–O interactions, yet the distance is still shorter than the standard van der Waals radius (3.17 Å and 3.25 Å) in the newly formed stable conformation, confirming that the NCL effect still exists in the two molecules.29,30 Inspired by the fact that hydrogen bonds, a type of electrostatic force, are able to conduct charges,31,32 the NCLs based on S–F and S–O electrostatic interaction may also be able to transport charges. As a result, the skeletons of DT-FBT and DT-OBT could sustain charge transporting more efficiently with the assistance of NCLs. In addition, we find direct evidence in the HOMO distribution of the three molecules (Fig. 4a), which shows an obvious molecular orbital overlap between the S–F and S–O atoms for DT-FBT or DT-OBT, as noted in the circled region in Fig. 4a. These hyper-conjugation characteristics will provide additional charge tunnelling ability.19,22 Therefore, a higher conductance for DT-FBT than for DT-BT could be rationalized by both basic organic chemistry and calculation chemistry. DT-OBT also benefits from NCLs for charge transport. Together with its best energy level alignment between its HOMO and EF (Fig. 3b), we can explain its highest conductance among the three molecules. Thus, instead of the molecule planarity as the driving force for improving device scale charge transport,13,16 the more efficient charge conducting channels contributed to improving intra-molecule charge transport in the case here. This work may contribute to providing new insights into the role of NCLs to improve the charge transport of solar cells at the molecule level.

Finally, the transmission spectra of the corresponding molecular junctions (see Fig. S5, ESI†) are calculated, which are shown in Fig. 4b. The transmission peaks located at two sides of EF correspond to the resonance tunnelling between the Fermi level of electrode and molecular orbitals.33,34 Clearly the Au Fermi level E = EF lies closer to the HOMO at ∼−0.5 eV instead of the LUMO at ∼1.1 eV. This is in good agreement with our energy level analysis using the CV method (Fig. 3b), and consistent with the previous reports showing that molecules terminated by thiophene anchors generally display HOMO-mediated charge transport.35 The calculated conductance values for DT-BT, DT-FBT, and DT-OBT are 9.5 nS, 12.2 nS, and 21.0 nS, producing the same trend as our experimental results.
In summary, a molecule group of DT-BT, DT-FBT and DT-OBT was prepared and the influence of NCLs on their single molecule conductance was evaluated. Different from the predicted conductance order of DT-OBT > DT-BT > DT-FBT determined by their charge tunnelling barrier, the measured conductance for DT-FBT exceeded that of DT-BT. This is caused by NCLs in DT-FBT resulting in more efficient charge transporting channels, as evidenced by the hyper-conjugation characteristics found in its HOMO distributions. DT-OBT, benefitting from both energy level alignment and NCL promoted charge transport, gives rise to the highest conductance. In conclusion, this work proved NCLs to be able to enhance the charge conduction, contributing to explaining NCLs’ mechanism for improving device-scale charge transport from the perspective of single molecules.
