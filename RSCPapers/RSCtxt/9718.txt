    , Accepted 25th February 2019First published on 14th March 2019AbstractFor optimum coverage of the optical spectrum and further enhancement of the carrier transport, ternary and even more multi-composition strategies have been universally explored. As PC71BM and PC61BM are both compatible with PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F takes advantage of optical absorption in the near-infrared region, we combined PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM quaternary compositions to fabricate high-efficiency polymer solar cells (PSCs) with good tolerance ratios of the fullerene acceptors. After blending the fullerene alloys PC71BM and PC61BM into the host PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F system, the optical response in the whole wavelength regime has been strengthened with significantly enhanced electron mobility. Concomitantly, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) surged from 22.07 to 24.37 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) ascended from 58.24% to 69.30%, which finally resulted in a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.52%, which is much higher than that of the binary control device (9.67%). This significant improvement is attributed to the fine-tuning of the morphology of the photo-active layer and feasible carrier transport. Interestingly, this finding implicates the synergistic effect of PC71BM and PC61BM to successfully enhancing the carrier transport. In addition, it demonstrates a broad tolerance of the acceptor proportions, resulting in higher PCE values for the quaternary devices as compared to the ternary devices. Lastly, generality for other systems evidences and provides guidelines for quaternary strategy utilization. Thus, the simplicity of quaternary strategies could be greatly beneficial to not yet elaborate commercial processes.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been prevalently investigated for their obvious advantage of solution processing, low material consumption, and great potential in photovoltaic devices1,2 and stretchable applications.3,4 Under this circumstance, the crucial standards of the devices, especially the higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and easier fabrication, are what competitors are chasing. Through material innovations and synthesis, many efficient and popular molecules have emerged. For instance, PTB7-Th5,6 and PBDB-T,7–9 the modified D–A conjugated polymers based on BDT unity as donors paired with various non-fullerene small molecular acceptors, including ITIC.7 Recent acceptors with distinguished red-shifts achieved notable absorptions in the near-red to infrared regime, such as IEICO-4F and i-IEICO-4F.10,11 To further realize outstanding performance of PSCs, general methods like thermal treatment and special additives were utilized in most polymer systems.12–15 Another strategy is the structure improvement based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture.16 Simple methods based on one-step PSCs are widely developed, including multi-composition design17–19 and interface engineering.20–23 As an approach to replenish solar light whilst also keeping the accessibility of the process,24 ternary and even more multi-composition blends have been proven to be a simple and highly efficient method to further pump the device achievements.25 Except for the well-preserved miscibility of the components, exciton generation and dissociation, carrier transport and collection were also able to improve the photovoltaic properties of PSCs. Even though the PCE of the binary systems was continuously pushed to another peak because the efficient non-fullerene molecules sprung up, the ternary adoption still found an efficient method to utilize the best of fullerene derivatives actively.25–30 Fullerene derivatives tend to harvest photons in the short wavelength regime. In contrast, non-fullerene molecules dominate in the near-infrared region thus offering more possibilities to maximize the utilization of spectral absorption. Hence, building on the foundation of ternary solar cells, more attempts emerged for utilizing complementary multi-acceptors like quaternary or even more component blends to pursue high-efficiency solar cells.31–33
In general, the desirable third or fourth component was able to improve the morphology of blend films and the enhanced crystallinity led to favorable charge carrier transport in devices. So far, only a few non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been selected as the multiple components due to the more complex complementarity of respective absorption spectra and the modulation of energy levels. Fullerene derivatives with extraordinary solubility and the ability of isotropic electron transport, like PC61BM and PC71BM, suggest the priority in the multi-acceptors option. Herein, the fullerene derivatives PC71BM and PC61BM have similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, this combination was chosen as sensitizers into the primary PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend film. PTB7-Th was considered as a kind of narrow band gap donor, which was compatible with both the fullerene derivatives and specific non-fullerene small molecule IEICO-4F.
When quaternary devices based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM were fabricated, the excellent isotropic ability to transport the electrons of fullerene derivatives compensated the anisotropic transport properties of non-fullerene linear conjugated chains. In this work, we mainly worked on quaternary PSCs and achieved the champion device with a PCE of 12.52%, which was about 30% higher than that of its binary control device. Even compared to the highest PCE (11.32%) of ternary devices (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM), the quaternary strategy still increased by 10%. Interestingly, the coordinating effect of PC71BM and PC61BM cooperation not only revealed an enhanced carrier transport compared to the binary system, it also showed high PCEs all around about 12% in a relatively big region of added PC71BM and PC61BM. Finally, we applied this strategy to other systems based on PTB7-Th:NFAs:PC71BM:PC61BM, where NFAs represented the respective ITIC, IT-M, and IT-4F. The present results demonstrate the generality of the synergistic effects of PC71BM and PC61BM, thus enabling high-efficiency quaternary devices. The present work is expected to provide a broader choice for PSCs in industrial production.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Chemical structures and energy levels
The chemical structures of the components used are shown in Fig. 1. PTB7-Th is a classic conjugated polymer donor with narrow band gap, which was widely used to match with various fullerene derivatives. The non-fullerene acceptor IEICO-4F is designed as an A–D–A-type small molecule, which possesses a narrow band gap due to the introduced alkoxy and fluorine atoms. Although PC71BM and PC61BM have similar structures, the larger size and shape of PC71BM differentiates them from each other. The energy levels of the materials are presented in Fig. 1e. The fullerene derivatives have energetically aligned LUMOs that may offer a tendency to form alloy structures34,35 upon addition into the binary host. The induced energy levels match well, thus a cascade was formatted between PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, which is beneficial for high-efficiency charge separation and charge transfer.36 In Fig. 1f, the optical absorption of the host PTB7-Th and IEICO-4F neat film peaked at about 700 nm and 900 nm, respectively. In contrast, the PC61BM absorption is mainly located in the violet region with weak extension into the visible region and PC71BM films mainly harvested light in the region from 300–500 nm. Thus, the combination of PC71BM:PC61BM was proposed as a helpful component that easily avoids excessive spectral overlap and complementarily covering the comprehensive spectrum.

2.2 Photovoltaic performance
The detailed data about the performance of PSCs based on binary and quaternary (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM) devices are summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the binary fullerene devices took advantage of a high FF of over 65%, but the values of Jsc were moderate. In contrast, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F devices had the opposite tendency (high Jsc of 22.07 mA cm−2, low FF of 58.24%, and PCE of 9.67%). From the binary to quaternary devices, the booming performance is mainly attributed to the increased Jsc of 24.37 mA cm−2 and surged FF of 69.30%, which finally resulted in a champion PCE of 12.52%. Concerning further details, the best performance derived from PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM devices was achieved at an optimized proportion of 1:1.1:0.2:0.2 (w/w). Other devices, including binary, ternary, and quaternary, were fixed at D/A (total ratio) = 1:1.5 ratios. Also, the performance of the ternary devices with varying proportions of either PC71BM or PC61BM (Table S1 and Fig. S1†) more clearly exhibited a gradual increase in Jsc and FF as a bridge connecting the binary and quaternary devices. As shown in Table S1,† the optimized ternary devices showed a PCE of 11.32% (with PC71BM added only) and 11.13% (with PC61BM added only). The ternary PSCs with PC61BM caused smaller series resistance (Rs) than that of PC71BM based ternary devices, producing the high FF in devices. In return, the main contribution from PC71BM in ternary devices was the significantly enhanced Jsc. When combining the merits of PC61BM and PC71BM, the expected quaternary devices have improved Jsc and FF values, generating a PCE in the respective quaternary devices beyond 12% under the high tolerance ratios of fullerene components (Table S1 and Fig. S2†).

To explore the reasons for the increased Jsc in the quaternary devices, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all the devices were measured in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100 nm. From the EQE spectrum, the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F device was fully elevated to a higher level rather than a certain specific region, which could correspond to more intensive light response in quaternary devices (Fig. 2b). Especially, the notable response values were maintaining about 80% from 700 to 900 nm for the quaternary devices. This seems to be the prominent contribution to the enhanced Jsc (Fig. 2a). PC71BM and PC61BM were nearly without absorption in this wavelength region, but both of them showed favorable electron mobility. Incorporating them into PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, the newly formed quaternary devices qualified for better exciton separation and charge transport. As expected, the quaternary devices obtained high EQE values in the whole response area.

To evaluate our study on the whole, we summarized a series of relevant references and skeletonized their performances in Fig. 3 and Table S5.† Although the result presented in this work does not stand on the top of this research field (red star in Fig. 3) it demonstrates that the performances of quaternary devices increase by about 30% compared to the binary control devices. The highest increase is about 34% in a ternary device compared to its binary device, marked as the black star in Fig. 3. The results indicate that the quaternary strategy is competitive to ternary or other multi-components methods to further pump the PCE in the IEICO-4F-based system.

2.3 Film morphology
The performance of PSCs is closely correlated to the blend morphology, phase aggregation, and molecular orientation in the photo-active layer.27,37–39 To better understand the relationship between the morphology and performance when going from binary to quaternary devices, we utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the morphology change. The AFM and TEM images of different components are displayed in Fig. S3.† The binary PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film exhibits the smallest root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.15 nm and a similar surface roughness of 1.30 nm was acquired in the PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM films. For the quaternary compositions, the surface RMS value (2.31 nm) was about twice as high as that of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F. In contrast, the TEM images implied more apparent aggregation in the fullerene-containing binary films. Due to the good planar conjugated structure and high steric hindrance of IEICO-4F, the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F films tended to be amorphous, as shown in Fig. S3g.† So when PC71BM and PC61BM joined the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F film (Fig. S3h†), the quaternary blend built up a more suitable nanoscale interpenetrating network. In addition, the phase separation exhibited a more moderate aggregation in favor of exciton dissociation.
To obtain detailed information on blend films, the grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was utilized to explore the crystallinity and molecular packing. Fig. 4a–d display 2D GIWAXS patterns for various blend films. The corresponding line cuts for the in-plane and out-of-plane profiles are plotted in Fig. 4e and f, respectively. From the out-of-plane profiles, we find the characteristic π–π stacking peaks around 1.80 Å−1 corresponding to π–π distances about 3.49 Å, implying a prominent “face-on” feature in all blend films. However, the different blend films show some discrepancies around 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane profiles. Although the films possessed the obvious lamellar stacking, the calculated full width at half maximum (FWHM) of different component films changed upon incorporation of the fullerene. The FWHM of host PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F has the largest value of 0.11 Å−1, indicating the smallest coherence length of 4.95 nm on the basis of the Scherrer equation.40,41 The FWHM of the two fullerene blend films had a small value of about 0.05 Å−1, indicating a coherence length of about 11.78 nm. For the optimal quaternary blend film, the FWHM values were 0.08 Å−1, corresponding to a coherence length of 6.82 nm. Considering that a larger coherence length affirms a positive impact40,42 on the quaternary device in the presence of PC71BM:PC61BM, we conclude on a more efficient exciton separation and carrier transport resulting in the enhancement of Jsc and FF. The mobilities derived from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) (Table S2 and Fig. S4†) also support the above description. The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of PTB7-Th:PC61BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM revealed subtle differences, whereas the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F and quaternary showed relatively big variation. The μh and μe values of the quaternary devices approached the highest values around 9.3 × 10−4 and 1.0 × 10−3 (cm2 V−1 S−1) and balanced μh/μe value compared to the other three devices, evidently displaying superior charge transport. On the other hand, high and balanced carrier mobility could decline the charge accumulation and built-in electric field erosion so that the Jsc and FF of the quaternary devices would reach the values of expectation.

2.4 Carrier transport
As is known, the morphology could affect exciton dissociation and charge transport. To better understand the exciton dissociation process when going from the binary to quaternary device, the exciton dissociation probabilities (P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat) were measured (Fig. 5a). The binary fullerene devices had a high P(E,T) above 0.97, indicating that the excitons in PTB7-Th:PC61BM and PTB7-Th:PC71BM quickly dissociated into free carriers, thus quickly achieving the saturation regime. The P(E,T) of PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F IEICO-4F was only 0.93, but the combined quaternary device maintained the merit of binary fullerene devices with P(E,T) up to 0.98 leading to improved exciton dissociation. To get further insight the carrier recombination was measured by Jscversus light-intensity (Plight) as dependent on a function of Jsc ∝ Plightα, (Fig. 5b). The slope of quaternary devices considerably raised to 0.98 compared to PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (α = 0.93) based devices. Obviously, the suppressed bimolecular recombination should be attributed to the PC71BM:PC61BM addition for the similar refrained recombination in PTB7-Th:PC61BM (α = 0.97) and PTB7-Th:PC71BM (α = 0.98). Thus, with generating dissociated excitons more efficiently and restrained increased loss of charge recombination, this lays a solid foundation of later carrier extraction thereby resulting in better upward Jsc and FF values in quaternary based devices.

Subsequently, to verify a deep understanding of the device under operation conditions, the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were explored (see Fig. 5c and d). The extracted data are summarized in Table S3.† From the fitted TPC curves (Fig. 5d), the calculated times of charge extraction (ts) were 0.22, 0.23, 0.34, and 0.26 μs for the devices based on PTB7-Th:PC61BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, and quaternary devices, respectively. Concurrently, the carrier lifetime (τR) from TPV test (Fig. 5c) under open circuit condition was analyzed as 0.65, 0.70, 0.96, and 1.21 μs for the same device sequence (PTB7-Th:PC61BM, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, and quaternary). We may suspect that the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F blend has a higher photo-generated quantum yield among the investigated binary systems due to its higher light response.43 Evidently, the integration of the enlarged carrier lifetime and fastest collection to the electrodes supports the quaternary devices performing with the best carrier transport behavior. In addition, it could be roughly inferred that carrier diffusion length ∝ μτR (where μ represents the mobility as discussed above),44–47 the enhanced carrier diffusion length is thus able to increase the valid charge transport in the more efficient devices.
2.5 Generality
To explore the wider application of quaternary strategies, we fabricated other quaternary devices with other NFAs systems. Therein, we choose popular NFAs, such as ITIC, IT-M and IT-4F. The detailed performance parameters of different quaternary PSCs in comparison with their corresponding binary devices are listed in Table S4.† Like the quaternary systems based on IEICO-4F, the other systems only tolerated a negligible loss of Voc, which is attributed to the gap between the HOMO value of the donors and the lowest LUMO from NFAs, too.27,48 Overall, the synergistic effects of balanced PC71BM:PC61BM impacted positively on the different host binary compositions mainly resulting from the improvement of Jsc. It is worth noting that the PSCs based on the PTB7-Th:IT-4F:0.2PC71BM:0.2PC61BM device showed considerable FF of 71.27% and Jsc of 18.59 mA cm−2 increasing by almost 15% in the PCE compared to binary pristine IT-4F based devices. This agrees well with the results of the PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM devices. In addition, we found the light response from the EQE spectrum became stronger with the change of ITIC, IT-M, and IT-4F (see Fig. S5–S7†). Most importantly, it is promising as a general and efficient method for promoting the performance of those NFAs systems suffering from the inferior carrier transport by optimized quaternary components in blend films.
3. Conclusions
In summary, the photovoltaic performance of the champion quaternary (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F:PC71BM:PC61BM = 1:1.1:0.2:0.2) devices achieved a PCE of 12.52%, due to both the device current density Jsc and the fill factor FF. Upon PC71BM:PC61BM additions to PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F binary blends, the quaternary devices combined the merits of high FF from PTB7-Th:PC71BM or PC61BM and high Jsc from PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F. The addition of the fullerenes induces fine-tuning of the morphology of these triple acceptors and a higher degree of structural order in the molecular packing. The quaternary systems are found to form better interpenetrating networks, enhancing the exciton dissociation and the carrier transport. Moreover, because the Voc of the quaternary devices is adhered to those of the devices based on PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, enhanced carrier transport and suppressive recombination could easily explain the effects that would embody the considerably improved Jsc and FF in comparison. Although the complexity of the device compositions slightly increased, our study on quaternary PSCs could offer more references to collocate and develop photovoltaic materials for high-efficiency polymer-based solar cells.
