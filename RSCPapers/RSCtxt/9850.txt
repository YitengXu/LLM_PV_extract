    , Accepted 19th May 2020First published on 19th May 2020AbstractFour fused-ring electron acceptors composed of the same naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-based core and 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone end groups without or with hexyloxyl groups on the core and/or phenyl side chains are compared to systematically study the effects of alkoxylation position on the molecular packing, optical, electronic, and photovoltaic properties of the nonfullerene acceptors. Alkoxylation on the core red-shifts absorption and reduces bandgap, while that on side chains has little effect on absorption and bandgap. Alkoxylation on the core up-shifts the HOMO and down-shifts the LUMO, while that on side chains shows very little effect on the energy levels. Alkoxylation on the core slightly improves electron mobility relative to that on the side chains. Both methods of alkoxylation decrease open-circuit voltage, but increase short-circuit current density and fill factor, leading to improved efficiencies of the organic solar cells. Finally, when blended with the polymer donor PM6, IOIC3/IOIC4 with alkoxylation on the core or side chains yields efficiencies of 11.1–12.8%, which are higher than that of IOIC2 without alkoxylation (10.5%). IOIC5 with alkoxylation on both the core and side chains yields the highest efficiency of 13.8%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered to be one of the promising next-generation solar energy technologies because they present unique features, such as being light-weight, flexibility, portability, semi-transparency, and fast mass production by roll-to-roll printing, and therefore they have received widespread attention in the last 30 years.1–9 Fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) have been traditional electron acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 12% have been achieved for the fullerene-based devices.10,11 However, fullerene acceptors suffer from several shortcomings, such as insufficient absorption in the visible and near infrared (NIR) regions, morphological instability, and limited adjustability of energy levels, which constrain the sustainable development of OSCs.12–14 In consequence, nonfullerene acceptors have been developed as alternatives to overcome these deficiencies of fullerene acceptors.15–21
In 2015, we reported a series of high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) represented by the star molecule ITIC.22 Since then, the development of the FREA family has flourished, and the OSCs based on FREAs have continually broken PCE records that are over 18% now.23–32 FREAs feature several advantages, such as facile synthesis, variable energy levels to fit various donor materials, a strong photoresponse in the visible-NIR regions, high exciton diffusion coefficients, 3D exciton and charge transport, and excellent stability.33–39 Most endeavors to enhance the performance of FREAs have focused on modifications of fused-ring cores,40–43 side chains,44–48 and end groups.49–52
Modification of the side chains has also been widely used to optimize the performance of FREAs through affecting the optoelectric properties and film morphology.53,54 For example, introducing alkoxyl groups onto phenyl side chains55–58 or central cores44,59–61 can not only modulate energy levels and enhance absorption, but also regulate morphology and enhance charge mobility of the FREAs. Nevertheless, there have been no works that compared the effects of alkoxyl substituents located on the core and side chains of FREAs on their performance.
In this work, we construct a small family of homologous FREAs consisting of the same core, naphtho[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (NDT) condensed with two cyclopentadienylthiophenes, and the same end groups, 3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-5,6-difluoro-1-indanone (2FIC), without or with hexyloxyl groups on the core and/or side chains, to systematically probe the impacts of alkoxylation position on the properties of the FREAs. In our previous work, we synthesized IOIC2 with hexyl groups on the core and the side chains (Fig. 1a).62 Then, we synthesized IOIC3 (Fig. 1a) by replacing the hexyl groups on the core of IOIC2 with hexyloxyl groups.59 Herein, we used hexyloxyl to replace hexyl groups on the phenyl side chains of IOIC2, and synthesized IOIC4 (Fig. 1a); we used hexyloxyl to replace the hexyl groups on the core and the phenyl side chains of IOIC2, and synthesized IOIC5 (Fig. 1a). The alkoxylation on the core results in bathochromic-shifted absorption spectra and a reduced optical bandgap, while the alkoxylation on the side chains has little effects on the absorption and bandgap. The alkoxylation on the core up-shifts the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and down-shifts the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, while the alkoxylation on the side chains has little effects on the energy levels. The alkoxylation on the core slightly increases electron mobility, while the alkoxylation on the side chains has little effects on electron mobility. OSCs based on the IOIC series and the wide-bandgap polymer donor PM663 (Fig. 1a) yield PCEs of 10.5% to 13.8%. Both methods of alkoxylation on the core and side chains improve the PCEs; by combining both the core and side-chain alkoxylation methods, the highest PCE of 13.8% is found with IOIC5.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of IOIC4 and IOIC5 are shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), and the detailed synthesis procedures are provided in the ESI.† The molecular structures of IOIC4 and IOIC5 were confirmed through 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis (see ESI†). The normalized optical absorption spectra of the IOIC series of compounds in chloroform solution (10−6 M) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†); all compounds have similar maximum molar extinction coefficients of 1.6–1.9 × 105 M−1 cm−1. In the thin films, IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 show absorption peaks at 730, 765, 748 and 758 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b); their optical bandgap (Eg) values are 1.45–1.54 eV (Table 1). Compared with IOIC2 without hexyloxyl groups, IOIC3 with hexyloxyl groups on the core shows markedly red-shifted absorption and a narrower Eg, while IOIC4 with hexyloxyl groups on the side chains shows slightly red-shifted absorption and a similar Eg.

We used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to measure the energy levels of the IOIC series of films (Fig. S2, ESI†). The HOMO levels of IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 measured by UPS are −5.70 eV, −5.64 eV, −5.70 eV and −5.65 eV, respectively (Fig. 1c); from the HOMO and Eg, the LUMO levels were determined to be −4.16 eV, −4.19 eV, −4.17 eV and −4.19 eV, respectively. Compared with IOIC2 without hexyloxyl groups, IOIC3 with hexyloxyl groups on the core shows an up-shifted HOMO and down-shifted LUMO, while IOIC4 with hexyloxyl groups on the side chains shows a very similar HOMO/LUMO.
Space charge limited current (SCLC) measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†) were used to study the IOIC series as neat films. Compared with IOIC2 without hexyloxyl groups (1.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), IOIC4 with hexyloxyl groups on the side chains has a similar electron mobility of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, while IOIC3 and IOIC5 with hexyloxyl groups on the core have slightly higher electron mobilities of 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Photovoltaic properties
The mid-bandgap polymer donor PM6 and the four FREAs exhibit complementary absorption in the 350–850 nm region (Fig. 1b) and the energy levels of PM6 fit those of the IOIC series of acceptors (Fig. 1c). Thus, BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PM6:acceptor/MoO3/Ag. The effects of donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive content on the device performance were investigated, and the optimization details are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†).
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices based on the IOIC series are shown in Fig. 2a. The open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE of the best cells are listed in Table 2. The VOC of the IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5-based cells is 0.970, 0.920, 0.964 and 0.920 V, respectively. The effects of hexyloxyl substituents on the core and phenyl side chains are responsible for different trends in VOC. The hexyloxyls on the core lead to a smaller VOC; taking IOIC2/IOIC3 as an example, the VOC decreases by 0.05 V upon alkyloxylation; a similar decrease is observed on going from IOIC4 to IOIC5. This decrease in VOC is caused by the down-shift of LUMO upon alkyloxylation of the core. In contrast, hexyloxyl substituents on the phenyl side chains have little effect on the VOC; very similar VOC values were found for IOIC2/IOIC4 or IOIC3/IOIC5. This trend is also in accordance with the LUMO, which is almost completely unaffected by the presence of hexyloxyls on the side chains.

J
SC varies from 16.3 to 20.9 mA cm−2, and alkyloxylation on either the core or side chains leads to a higher JSC. The JSC also depends on the alkyloxylation position. When comparing the IOIC2–IOIC4 series, both hexyloxylated acceptors IOIC3/IOIC4 have a higher JSC than IOIC2; however, hexyloxyl substituents on the core (IOIC3, JSC = 20.0 mA cm−2, a 23% improvement) lead to a larger increase than on the side chains (IOIC4, JSC = 17.3 mA cm−2, a 6% improvement). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best cells are shown in Fig. 2b. A similar trend was found: alkyloxylation leads to higher EQE values and core alkyloxylation leads to a larger increase than that of side-chain alkyloxylation. These trends in JSC and EQE are consistent with the absorption spectra in which the side-chain alkyloxylation does not cause a notable red-shift that is observed with core alkyloxylation.
The FF varies from 66.1% to 71.5%, and alkyloxylation on either the core or side chains leads to a higher FF. The FF is also sensitive to the alkyloxylation position. In the IOIC2–IOIC4 series, both hexyloxylated acceptors IOIC3/IOIC4 have a higher FF than IOIC2; however, hexyloxyl substituents on the core (IOIC3, FF = 69.7%) lead to a larger increase than on the side chains (IOIC4, JSC = 66.7%). Finally, when both core and side chains are alkyloxylated, the highest FF of 71.5% is found for IOIC5. The charge mobilities of the blends were measured by using the SCLC method (Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†). The hole mobilities of all the blends are on the same magnitude (1.6–4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), while the highest μe is found for the IOIC5 blend, contributing to the highest FF.
Finally, the increase in the JSC and FF outweighs the decrease in VOC, which are caused by alkyloxylation, leading to a PCE enhancement from 10.5% to 13.8%. When comparing IOIC3 (core alkyloxylation, PCE = 12.8%) to IOIC4 (side-chain alkyloxylation, PCE = 11.1%), the large increase in JSC from core alkyloxylation drives the higher PCE. However, compared to IOIC2 without hexyloxyls (PCE = 10.5%), both methods of alkyloxylation lead to an overall increase in PCE. Additionally, by combining both core and side-chain alkyloxylation methods, the highest PCE of 13.8% is found with IOIC5.
Variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff) was investigated to probe the charge extraction properties (Fig. 2c).64Jph of the devices approaches saturation (Jsat) under Veff > 2 V; the value of JSC/Jsat can reflect the degree of charge extraction. The JSC/Jsat values of the devices based on IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 are 0.94, 0.95, 0.94 and 0.96, respectively, suggesting efficient charge extraction in all devices and slightly better charge extraction for IOIC5.
We also measured JSC under different incident light intensity (Plight) to study the charge recombination behavior (Fig. 2d), and the correlation between JSC and Plight is expressed by JSC ∝ Pαlight.65 For IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 based devices, the values of α are estimated to be 0.95, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.97 under short-circuit conditions, respectively, suggesting weak bimolecular charge recombination in all devices and slightly better bimolecular charge recombination in IOIC5.
Film morphology
The morphology of the blended films was studied by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the AFM images (Fig. S5, ESI†), all the blends present fibril features (about 15–20 nm in diameter) with a large root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 7.90–8.68 nm. As can be seen from the TEM images (Fig. S6, ESI†), all the blend films present dense and continuous networks.
To study how the alkoxylation position affects the crystalline packing of the thin films, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed.66,67 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding intensity profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions of the pure and blend films are presented in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 3a, b, respectively. The pure IOIC4 film is preferentially edge-on oriented with the (100) lamellar peak concentrated at qz = 0.31 Å−1. The pure IOIC2 film is bimodal with strong egde-on and weak face-on order. In contrast, pure IOIC3 and IOIC5 films exhibit preferential “face-on” stacking features with the lamellar peak located at qr = 0.29 Å−1 and 0.31 Å−1 and the π–π peak at qz = 1.74 Å−1 and 1.78 Å−1, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†), contributing to higher electron mobilities relative to those of IOIC2 and IOIC4 in neat films. Consequently, the PM6:IOIC4 blend films exhibit the strongest “edge-on” orientation with the lamellar peak at qz = 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) compared with the other blend films. This is expected to be unfavorable for vertical charge transport; both μh and μe are indeed lower in the blend. The PM6:IOIC2 film presents a weaker edge-on orientation, with a ring-like lamellar peak located at q = 0.30 Å−1. There was no obvious π–π peak identified for the PM6:IOIC2 and PM6:IOIC4 films. The PM6:IOIC3 and PM6:IOIC5 blend films exhibit a dominant “face-on” orientation with a lamellar peak appearing at qr = 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) and the π–π peak at qz = 1.72 Å−1. Based on Scherrer's equation,68 the crystallite coherence lengths (CCLs) of the lamellar peaks of the PM6:IOIC3 and PM6:IOIC5 blend films are calculated to be 79.4 Å and 84.5 Å, respectively, and the corresponding CCLs of the π–π peaks are 27.8 Å and 33.5 Å.
 Fig. 3  (a) 2D GIWAXS patterns and (b) in-plane (dashed lines) and out-of-plane (solid lines) scattering profiles for the blended films, and (c) the in-plane GISAXS profiles for the blended films. 
Besides, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements were also performed to study the domain sizes of the blend films. The in-plane intensity profiles and best fittings are presented in Fig. 3c. Using the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model, the correlation lengths of the amorphous intermixing phases were fitted to be 16.4, 15.2, 19.4 and 18.7 nm for the IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 blend films. The acceptor domain sizes were fitted using the fractal-like network, and were found to be 19.4, 6.0, 7.5 and 20.4 nm for the IOIC2, IOIC3, IOIC4 and IOIC5 blend films, respectively. Despite all the blend films having appropriate pure acceptor domain sizes for exciton dissociation, a relatively larger acceptor domain size, such as in the IOIC2 and IOIC5 blend films, could more easily form connected pathways for electron transport. Thus, the PM6:IOIC5 film exhibits the largest CCLs, a favorable face-on orientation and connected electron transport pathways, consistent with the observed higher mobilities and FF.
Conclusion
Based on the same NDT-based core and 2FIC end groups, four IOIC compounds with/without hexyloxyls on the core and/or side chains were compared to probe the effects of alkoxylation position on their absorption, energy levels, charge transport, film morphology and photovoltaic performance. The main effects of alkoxylation are summarized as follows. (a) Alkoxylation on the core red-shifts the absorption spectrum and reduces the bandgap, while alkoxylation on the side chains has little impact on the absorption and bandgap. (b) Alkoxylation on the core up-shifts the HOMO due to the π-conjugative effect of the hexyloxyls and down-shifts the LUMO due to the σ-inductive effect of the hexyloxyls; while alkoxylation on the side chains shows very little effect on the energy levels. (c) Alkoxylation on the core leads to a slightly higher electron mobility due to higher molecular ordering relative to the side-chain alkoxylation. (d) Compared to IOIC2 without hexyloxyls, both methods of alkyloxylation enhance PCE; the core alkyloxylation leads to a larger increase than that on the side chains primarily due to the larger increase in JSC. Finally, by combining both side-chain and core alkyloxylation methods, the highest PCE of 13.8% is achieved with IOIC5. These results demonstrate that alkyloxylation location has notable impacts on the molecular packing and basic properties of the FREAs and alkyloxylation on both core and side chains is an effective approach towards high-efficiency nonfullerene acceptors.
