    , Accepted 2nd October 2013First published on 3rd October 2013AbstractTungsten trioxide (WO3) is being investigated as one of the most promising materials for water oxidation using solar light. Its inherent surface-related drawbacks (e.g., fast charge recombination caused by surface defect sites, the formation of surface peroxo-species, etc.) are nowadays being progressively overcome by different methods, such as surface passivation and the deposition of co-catalysts. Among them, the role of surface passivation is still poorly understood. Herein, transparent WO3 (electrodeposited) and Al2O3/WO3 (prepared by atomic layer deposition, ALD) thin film electrodes were employed to investigate the role of an alumina overlayer by using both photoelectrochemical and laser flash photolysis measurements. Films with a 5 nm-alumina overlayer (30 ALD cycles) showed an optimum photoelectrochemical performance, portraying a 3-fold photocurrent and Faradaic efficiency enhancement under voltage biases. Moreover, IPCE measurements revealed that alumina effect was only significant with an applied potential ca. 1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), matching the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation at pH 1 (0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl). According to the investigation of electron accumulation through optical absorption measurements, the alumina overlayer dominantly decreased the number of electron trapping sites on the WO3 surface, eventually facilitating photoelectron transfer to the external circuit in the presence of a positive bias. In addition, the laser flash photolysis measurements of WO3 and Al2O3/WO3 thin films clearly showed that the electron trapping decreased in the presence of the alumina overlayer whereas the hole trapping relatively increased with alumina, facilitating water photooxidation and rendering a more sluggish recombination process. These results provide a physical insight into the passivation process that could be used as a guideline for further development of efficient photoanodes in artificial photosynthesis.

Broader context
Water oxidation as a supply of electrons and protons is currently considered a major problem in realizing artificial photosynthesis and water splitting for solar energy conversion and storage. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is being investigated as one of the most promising materials for water photooxidation. Its inherent surface-related drawbacks (e.g., fast charge recombination caused by surface defect sites, the formation of surface peroxo-species, etc.) are being progressively overcome nowadays by means of different methods, such as surface passivation and the deposition of co-catalysts. Among these, the role of surface passivation is not well understood. In this study, a systematic investigation was tried to find out the role of an Al2O3 overlayer. Al2O3/WO3 (overcoated by atomic layer deposition) showed marked enhancements in both the photocurrent (ca. 3 times) and the Faradaic efficiency (ca. 3 times) for O2 photogeneration in the presence of an applied bias. We suggest that the alumina overlayer not only suppresses the formation of surface peroxo-species but also affects the surface defect sites (both electron and hole trapping sites) in WO3. By means of laser flash measurements, we proved that the electron trapping decreased in the presence of the alumina overlayer whereas the hole trapping relatively increased with alumina, facilitating water photooxidation and rendering a more sluggish recombination process. These results provide a physical insight into the passivation process that could be used as a guideline for further development of efficient photoanodes in artificial photosynthesis.

1. Introduction
Artificial photosynthesis is being intensively investigated for storing solar energy as fuels as well as recycling CO2.1–3 In this process, the photooxidation of water as an electron donor is currently considered the major bottleneck in the practical synthesis of solar fuels.4–8 Extensive efforts have been made to understand and achieve efficient water oxidation under visible irradiation using earth-abundant materials.5–8 Among them, WO3 has been frequently studied as a photoanode,9–11 despite its limitations such as: (i) the formation of parasitic peroxo-species which can compete with water oxidation, (ii) stability limited only to acidic conditions,12 and (iii) a fast charge recombination caused mainly by surface defect sites.13–16 Moreover, the competitive photooxidation of the electrolyte anions,14,15 as well as the effect of cations14 and additives15 (e.g., redox mediators, such as Ag+/Ag or Fe3+/Fe2+) has been recently found to substantially affect the oxygen production yield. To circumvent some of these limitations, many strategies have been reported such as the optimization of the electrolyte conditions (i.e., type of ions, pH, etc.),14 the modification of the surface with co-catalysts14 and hydrogen treatment16 that prevents the accumulation of surface peroxide, and the enhancement of the charge separation by coupling WO3 to other semiconductors (e.g., TiO2, BiVO4, etc.)17–20 or tandem water splitting systems.21,22
Overcoating base photoanodic materials with metal oxides (e.g., Al2O3 and TiO2) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a common and easy surface modification method23–28 that has been employed in solar fuel production,24–26 water splitting,27,28 and solar cells29,30 among others. For water oxidation, this method has been employed with Al2O3/Fe2O3,24 TiO2/Cu2O,25 and TiO2/TiO226(ALD oxide/bare oxide) showing promising results. However, the deposited overlayer did not have the same effects in all cases, since its performance depends on many experimental variables, such as the applied potential, film thickness, pH, etc. Thereby, there is a paucity of fundamental studies aiming at understanding the interplay of all parameters in the observed behavior.
In this contribution we tested the photoactivity of Al2O3/WO3 transparent electrodes from both steady state and transient time domains. In the first case, we used conventional photoelectrochemical measurements31–33 to obtain information about the interfacial charge transfer processes occurring on the semiconductor/solution interface, and in the latter case, laser flash photolysis was used to directly monitor the generation and recombination of charge carriers34–36 under open-circuit (OC) and biased conditions. Through the combination of both measurements, we can gain deeper insight into the role of the alumina overlayer on WO3 thin films for water photooxidation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first fundamental studies investigating the charge carrier dynamics in surface passivated WO3 thin films under biased conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
The following reagents were used as received: tungsten powder (Acros, 12 μm, 99.9%), isopropanol (Aldrich, Junsei, 98%), H2O2 (Junsei, 35%), trimethylaluminum (TMA; Aldrich), and HClO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS Reagent, 70%). All working solutions were prepared with deionized ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm) that was obtained by a Barnstead purification system.
2.2 Preparation and characterization of Al2O3/WO3 thin films
Tungsten oxide thin films were prepared on conducting FTO-coated glass plates (Pilkington, 15 Ω per square) according to previous reports.37,38 Briefly, tungsten powder (2 g) was dissolved in a concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution (10 mL). Once the exothermic reaction was completed, ultrapure water (100 mL) and isopropanol (30 mL) were added to obtain the working solution in which the deposition was carried out in the conventional three-electrode cell. A clean piece of FTO glass (2 × 2 cm2 for electrochemical measurements or 1 × 1 cm2 for laser flash photolysis) was used as the working electrode, a coiled Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat.) electrode as the reference electrode. A potential value of −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied to the FTO substrate for 25 min, which led to the formation of a thin film with thickness ca. 1.0 μm as measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, see below). During the deposition process, the film acquired an intense blue coloration typical of WO3 in the electron accumulation region. At the end of the deposition process, a potential of 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was applied, which removed the blue coloration. Finally, the electrode was washed with ethanol and water and annealed in air for 1 h at 450 °C. For thin Al2O3 deposition on the WO3 electrode, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (National Center for Nanomaterials Technology) was used with trimethylaluminum (TMA) as a precursor. The ALD was performed at a temperature of 100 °C. Each ALD cycle consisted of successive pulses of TMA (0.5 s), Ar-purging (10 s), O2 plasma (3 s), and Ar-purging (10 s). To control the thickness, the number of ALD cycles was varied among 3, 30, and 300, which corresponded to thicknesses of 0.5, 5, and 50 nm, respectively (as measured by ellipsometry on a Si reference under the same conditions). The actual ALD film thickness on WO3 was estimated from the cross-sectional TEM images: ca. 5.3 nm (for 30 cycles) and ca. 49.6 nm (for 300 cycles). Polyimide tape was used to mask the bare-FTO area in the electrode and to fix them on the top of silicon wafers (substrate in the ALD chamber). The prepared electrodes were stable enough for repeated electrochemical measurements in this work. WO3 film samples were prepared to secure the transparency for laser measurements, which implies that films were not optimized with respect to light absorption, surface area and charge transfer properties. SEM images were obtained using a field-emission HITACHI S-4800 microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (MAC Science Co., M18XHF) were acquired using Cu Kα radiation (0.15418 nm). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer. Electrode cross-sectional images were obtained using a Hitachi HD-2300 scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Experiments were performed using a computer-controlled potentiostat–galvanostat (Gamry Instruments Reference 600) that was connected to a three-electrode electrochemical Pyrex cell with a quartz window for light exposure. The cell consisted of 3 compartments, which held the reference, counter and working electrodes, respectively. The working electrode compartment had a total volume of 150 mL. A Pt coiled wire was used as a counter electrode. Potentials were measured and referred against an Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat.) electrode (E0 = +0.197 V vs. NHE). The electrolyte was a 0.1 M HClO4 solution, purged with Ar gas for 30 min prior to measurements. Ar was continuously purged throughout all electrochemical measurements. The light source was an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Abet Technologies, LS1-10500), with an in-built ozone-free 150 W Xe arc lamp (model LS150). The electrode was illuminated at the front side, through the electrolyte–electrode interface (EE illumination). The incident light intensity was measured with a thermopile head (Newport 818P-001-12) connected to an optical power meter (Newport 1918-R), yielding (120 ± 15) mW cm−2 (ca. 1 Sun). For measuring the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE), a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport, 6258) was coupled to a grating monochromator (Newport, 74125) operating in the wavelength range from 330 to 550 nm, and the incident light intensity was measured with a UV silicon detector (Newport, 71675). The photoelectrode was biased at +0.6 or +1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) during all IPCE measurements.
2.4 Oxygen evolution measurements
The amount of photogenerated O2 in the reactor headspace (71 mL) was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (GC, HP6890A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a 5 Å molecular sieve column. Ultra high purity argon (Linde, 99.9995%) was used as the carrier gas. 100 μL of gas samples were intermittently withdrawn every 30 min with a glass syringe (Hamilton 81030). All cell compartments were thoroughly sealed with rubber septa, glycerine and parafilm to prevent any gas leakage. Prior to any measurement, the electrolyte (ca. 79 mL) was Ar-purged for 1 h. The electrode was continuously held at +1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and it was illuminated for 2 h.
2.5 Laser flash photolysis
The laser flash photolysis measurements with transmission detection were performed with the use of the third harmonic generation (355 nm, 250 μJ per pulse, 5 ns FWHM, 10 Hz) from a Q-switched Nd3+:YAG laser (Continuum, Surelite II-10) for the excitation operated with temporal control by a delay generator (Stanford Research Systems, DG535).39 The transmitted probe light from a pulsed 450 W Xe arc lamp (Ushio, UXL-451-0) was focused on a monochromator (Nikon G250). The output of the monochromator was monitored using a silicon avalanche photodiode detector (Hamamatsu Photonics, S5343) with an amplifier (Femto, DHPVA-100). The transient signals were recorded by a digitizer (Tektronix, TDS 580D). To avoid any damage to the sample solution by the probe light, a suitable cutoff filter was used in front of the sample. The reported signals were the averages of 100 events. Prior to any measurement, the electrolyte (ca. 5 mL) was Ar-purged for 15 min. The photoelectrode was biased with a potential of +0.6 or +1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) during the laser flash photolysis. The electrode was illuminated at the front side, through the electrolyte–electrode interface (EE illumination). A custom-made cell was used to simultaneously perform the laser flash photolysis and electrochemical measurements. Counter and reference electrodes were the same as in the previous photoelectrochemical measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photoelectrochemical activity
Thin alumina on WO3 can alter the photoactivity of the bare material in many ways, including: (i) the electrode absorption yield of solar light, (ii) the efficiency of hole transfer to generate oxygen (eqn (1)) and/or surface peroxo-species (eqn (2)), and (iii) the population of surface defect sites. 2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+, E0 = 1.229 V (vs. NHE)(1) 2H2O + 2h+ → H2O2 + 2H+, E0 = 1.763 V (vs. NHE)(2)
The light absorption by WO3 was not reduced at all by the alumina overlayer (Fig. S1†), which means that the photogeneration of charge carriers was not influenced by the ALD modification. However, it should be considered that the different surface properties of WO3 and Al2O3 (the point of zero charge (pHpzc), the density of hydroxyl group, water adsorption, etc.) might influence both the formation and removal of peroxo-species and the distribution of surface defect sites (i.e., electron and/or hole trapping sites). The formation of surface peroxo-species, which competes with the water photooxidation process, might be different on WO3 and Al2O3 surfaces. On the other hand, surface defect sites can act as trapping states for both photogenerated electron and holes.40–44 Excess electron trapping can inhibit its collection in the conduction band by recombining with trapped holes, and hence the photocurrent is also suppressed. The interplay between these two charge carrier trapping modes will determine the final overlayer effect.
We first tested the photoelectrochemical behavior of the bare and composite films by voltammetry (Fig. 1). Upon alumina deposition, the photocurrent is enhanced up to 3 times after 30 cycles (ca. 5 nm-thick alumina layer, Fig. 2) at the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation (0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 1.0); however, there is a slight photocurrent decrease at low potential regions (from the onset potential up to 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Apparently, upon 300 cycles (ca. 50 nm) the surface blockage for the water photooxidation sites is complete,45 whereas for a lower number of cycles (3 cycles, ca. 0.5 nm) this blocking effect is less significant. The onset potential was 0.14 V vs. Ag/AgCl (−0.06 V vs. NHE)46 in all cases, pointing out that the conduction band edge (flat band potential) remains fixed (pinned) upon alumina deposition (Fig. S3†).47 This result is opposed to that of the alumina/Fe2O3 films modified by the same ALD method,24 as the onset potential of Fe2O3 was drastically changed in the presence of alumina. This suggests that the effect of alumina passivation highly depends on the parent materials and also on the surface coverage achieved. In addition, UV-visible spectra and XRD patterns show that the alumina overlayer induces no significant changes in the optical (i.e., bandgap width) and structural properties of the host material (Fig. S1 and S2†).

The photocurrent (Iph) was obtained by correcting the capacitive contribution in the dark. Inset: normalized photocurrent values taken at 0.97 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (thermodynamic potential of water oxidation at pH 1.0) as a function of ALD cycles.

The alumina effect on the photocurrent was also confirmed by measuring the IPCE of WO3 and Al2O3/WO3 films (Fig. 3). The alumina effect was only significant with a high applied potential (ca. 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl), matching the thermodynamic potential for water oxidation at pH 1 (0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Similarly, the IPCE onset wavelength did not change either. Both voltammetry and IPCE data confirm that the electrode with 30 ALD cycles shows an optimum behavior in terms of photocurrent generation. The different enhancement factors of the alumina effect between the voltammetric (Fig. 1) and IPCE data (Fig. 3) are ascribed to the different light intensities and the wavelength-dependences of the photoelectrochemical behavior of the film.

3.2 Water photooxidation Faradaic efficiency
To further ascertain the alumina effect in terms of interfacial charge transfer and water oxidation, we performed simultaneous photocurrent and oxygen evolution measurements at 1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 4). As observed, the photocurrent with the alumina modified electrode (30 ALD cycles) shows an initial value that is 2 times larger than that without alumina. However, the photocurrent quickly decays during 2 hours of continuous illumination reaching a value that is closer to that of the WO3 electrode. In contrast, the unmodified electrode shows a slower photocurrent decay curve and a more stable signal. In addition, the amount of photogenerated oxygen is 4 times larger in the presence of alumina than in its absence. To quantitatively assess the yield of the process, the corresponding oxygen generation Faradaic efficiencies (η) (i.e., the photocurrent-to-oxygen conversion efficiencies13,14) were calculated according to: (3)where 4 is the number of exchanged electrons in the water oxidation process, F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol−1), n is the amount of generated oxygen (mol) and Iph is the collected photocurrent (A). The calculated efficiency values were 17.7% for WO3 and 54.1% for Al2O3/WO3 (see Table S1†). Consequently, upon alumina deposition the oxygen production Faradaic efficiency increased 3 times. This means that trapped holes can be more efficiently utilized for the oxidation of H2O to O2 in the presence of the alumina overlayer and this can be probably ascribed to that the formation of peroxo-species is more hampered by the alumina overlayer (Scheme 1). The 3-fold enhanced Faradaic efficiency implies that alumina passivation induces not only an increased photocurrent but also the suppression of peroxo-species formation to a significant extent. Incidentally, it should be noted that the oxygen production in this reactor was low due to a high recombination rate between the photogenerated O2 on the photoanode and H2 generated on the Pt wire (counter electrode), as both were in the same cell compartment.

For the sake of clarity, electrons (red full circles) and holes (blue open circles) are represented as free on the conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands, respectively. Likewise, blue and red arrows represent hole and electron mediated processes, respectively. Green arrows represent the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs. Black arrows represent recombination losses. Relative arrow thicknesses represent the rate of the processes (the thicker the arrow, the faster and more effective the process). 
3.3 Electron trapping
For unveiling the role of surface defect sites on WO3 and Al2O3/WO3, we investigated the electron and hole trapping within defect sites. To understand photoelectron accumulation and release from trapping sites (i.e., W5+ centers, surface dangling bonds, and defects, etc.),48 the visible-NIR absorption spectra were measured in the dark with an applied potential of 0 V and 1.3 V, which is below and above the photocurrent onset potential, respectively (Fig. 5). The absorption at 800 nm (i.e., electron trapping signal34) was not significantly changed in the presence of the positive potential (1.3 V) regardless of the presence of the alumina overlayer. Upon the application of 0 V (voltammetric electron accumulation region,49 see Fig. S4†), however, a marked increase in the light absorption occurs with both WO3 and Al2O3/WO3 (i.e., the electrode acquires a blue coloration due to electrochromism). The electron accumulation continuously increased in the bare-WO3 case whereas it was drastically decreased (ca. 60% reduction) in the presence of the alumina overlayer, reaching a steady state after ca. 50 s. This clearly demonstrates that the alumina overlayer dominantly decreases the number of electron trapping sites on the WO3 surface, eventually facilitating photoelectron transfer to the external circuit in the presence of a positive bias (see Scheme 2). Hence, decreasing the amount of trapped electrons with the alumina overlayer might affect the population of trapped holes.

The alumina overlayer was deposited by ALD for 30 cycles. Electrolyte: Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution (pH 1.0).

Electrons (red full circles) and holes (blue open circles) are represented as free on the conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands, respectively, or trapped at surface electron traps (red lines) or surface hole traps (blue lines) below and above the CB and VB edges, respectively. In both cases, the same total number of photogenerated electrons and holes (18) are depicted for a fair comparison. 
3.4 Hole trapping and charge carrier population
To directly observe the photohole population on the hole trapping sites on WO3 and Al2O3/WO3, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was carried out under biased and unbiased (i.e., open-circuit) conditions. Recently, the photohole spectrum and lifetime of WO3 was reported in the presence of Ag+ as a sacrificial electron acceptor.36 In this study, the electrical bias was used as an electron acceptor instead of Ag+. Employing a biased condition is better for observing the real electron transfer dynamics, as Ag+ might induce various side effects such as Ag deposition and O2 generation through Ag2+ species.15 Initially, we checked the applied bias effect over WO3 electrodes (Fig. S5†). As observed, the generation yield (i.e., the initial optical density change upon illumination, ΔOD) of the trapped holes increased as the applied bias was successively more positive (1.3 V), whereas it decreased when the potential was held negative (−0.1 V). The increase of trapped hole population with an applied potential above the photocurrent onset (i.e., at 1.3 V) is assigned to the efficient removal of photoelectrons through the external circuit, lowering the charge recombination. No signal appeared in the case of bare FTO glass without WO3 (data not shown).
Finally, we probed the photohole dynamics with TAS to investigate on the alumina effect (Fig. 6). The trapped photohole generation (i.e., charge separation yield) for Al2O3/WO3 drastically increased in the presence of an applied positive potential (1.3 V) while that of bare WO3 is less effective (Fig. 6a). This result is in line with our previous hypothesis that alumina passivation significantly increases the population of trapped holes on WO3. The time-resolved spectrum (i.e., ΔOD at 2 μs after the laser flash) of WO3 still contains the trapped electrons as well as holes, which shows a broad absorption spectrum even in the presence of the positive potential (black squares in Fig. 6b). However, the alumina overlayer on WO3 leads to a much higher concentration of photoholes at the earliest time examined (2 μs) in the presence of the positive bias (1.3 V, red circles in Fig. 6b). Thus, the dramatic enhancement of hole trapping (A − B, blue triangles in Fig. 6b) can be, at least in part, one of the reasons for the increased water oxidation efficiency in the presence of Al2O3.
 Fig. 6  (a) Absorption time traces observed at 480 nm (photoholes in WO3)36 and (b) time-resolved absorption spectra at 2 μs after laser flash photolysis (355 nm, 250 μJ pulse−1) of WO3 (B, black squares) and Al2O3/WO3 (A, red circles) thin films in Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution and in the absence (OCP conditions) (for a) and presence of an applied bias (at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) (for a and b). The difference between both spectra (A − B) is represented by blue triangles. The alumina overlayer was deposited after 30 ALD cycles. 
As hole transfer kinetics depends on their population, a direct estimation of the number of trapped holes from TAS decay curves would be useful to understand the observed behavior. However, the long-lived water oxidation process (μs–s) does not fit well with our transient laser measurement time range due to a low signal-to-noise ratio stemming from the thin nature of our films. Therefore, to estimate the total charge carrier population we deconvoluted the time-resolved spectra under biased conditions (Fig. 6b), splitting them into the contributions from free electrons, trapped electrons and trapped holes in each case (Fig. 7 and Table S2†). As shown (see Table S2†), the trapped hole population in the alumina overcoated WO3 is around 3 times larger than that of bare WO3, but that of trapped electrons is about 1/5 as much as in Al2O3/WO3. Consequently, from a semi-quantitative perspective we confirm that the alumina overlayer on WO3 influences the number of intra bandgap surface traps and subsequently their population to change the water photooxidation kinetics.

Contributions from trapped electrons (red) and trapped holes (blue) are taken into account, using Gaussian peak functions for their modeling. The broad free electron contribution in the whole wavelength range was compensated in both cases using a power-type baseline.50 All fittings had regression coefficients (r) larger than 0.9800. Relative contributions of trapped holes (Ah) and trapped electrons (Ae) are highlighted on each case, taking the unmodified WO3 electrode as a reference. 
4. Conclusion
Transparent tungsten trioxide thin films with an alumina overlayer showed marked enhancements in both the photocurrent and the Faradaic efficiency for O2 photogeneration in the presence of an applied bias that mimics the role of common sacrificial electron scavengers (i.e., Ag+). We suggest that the alumina overlayer not only suppresses the formation of surface peroxo-species (Scheme 1) but also affects the surface defect sites (both electron and hole trapping sites, Scheme 2) in WO3. By means of laser flash measurements, we showed that the electron accumulation decreases whereas the trapped hole population relatively increases in the presence of both the alumina overlayer and an applied bias (at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl). This study provides detailed information regarding the various effects that the alumina overlayer can have on a WO3 photoanode for solar O2 production. The alumina overlayer influences the surface states which are critical in determining the processes occurring on the photoanode. The experimental evidence (photocurrent, Faradaic efficiency, TAS, etc.) can explain such observed behavior, which guide us to better design photoanodes and passivation layers for water oxidation.

Broader context
Water oxidation as a supply of electrons and protons is currently considered a major problem in realizing artificial photosynthesis and water splitting for solar energy conversion and storage. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is being investigated as one of the most promising materials for water photooxidation. Its inherent surface-related drawbacks (e.g., fast charge recombination caused by surface defect sites, the formation of surface peroxo-species, etc.) are being progressively overcome nowadays by means of different methods, such as surface passivation and the deposition of co-catalysts. Among these, the role of surface passivation is not well understood. In this study, a systematic investigation was tried to find out the role of an Al2O3 overlayer. Al2O3/WO3 (overcoated by atomic layer deposition) showed marked enhancements in both the photocurrent (ca. 3 times) and the Faradaic efficiency (ca. 3 times) for O2 photogeneration in the presence of an applied bias. We suggest that the alumina overlayer not only suppresses the formation of surface peroxo-species but also affects the surface defect sites (both electron and hole trapping sites) in WO3. By means of laser flash measurements, we proved that the electron trapping decreased in the presence of the alumina overlayer whereas the hole trapping relatively increased with alumina, facilitating water photooxidation and rendering a more sluggish recombination process. These results provide a physical insight into the passivation process that could be used as a guideline for further development of efficient photoanodes in artificial photosynthesis.

2H2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4H+, E0 = 1.229 V (vs. NHE)	(1)
2H2O + 2h+ → H2O2 + 2H+, E0 = 1.763 V (vs. NHE)	(2)

 	Fig. 1  Voltammetric response of transparent Al2O3/WO3 electrodes, under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (120 mW cm−2). The alumina overlayer was deposited by ALD, for 0 cycles (black), 3 cycles (green), 30 cycles (red) and 300 cycles (blue). Electrolyte: Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 (pH 1.0). Scan rate: 20 mV s−1. The photocurrent (Iph) was obtained by correcting the capacitive contribution in the dark. Inset: normalized photocurrent values taken at 0.97 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (thermodynamic potential of water oxidation at pH 1.0) as a function of ALD cycles.	 

 	Fig. 2  Cross-sectional TEM images (a and c) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (b and d) of transparent Al2O3/WO3 prepared by atomic layer deposition (300 cycles for a and b; 30 cycles for c and d).	 

 	Fig. 3  IPCE spectra of WO3 (triangles) and Al2O3/WO3 (circles) electrodes measured at 1.0 V and 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The alumina overlayer was deposited by ALD for 30 cycles. Electrolyte: Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution (pH 1.0). Illumination: a 300 W Xe arc lamp coupled to a monochromator.

 	Fig. 4  Photocurrent transient (left) and concurrent oxygen evolution (right) using illuminated WO3 (black) and Al2O3/WO3 (red, 30 cycles) electrodes. Electrolyte: Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 (pH 1.0). The potential was fixed at +1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl.	 

 	Scheme 1  Illustration of hole and electron mediated charge transfer occurring on (left) WO3 and (right) Al2O3/WO3 illuminated electrodes biased at a potential around the thermodynamic water oxidation potential (0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The purple rectangle on the right side represents the alumina overlayer. For the sake of clarity, electrons (red full circles) and holes (blue open circles) are represented as free on the conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands, respectively. Likewise, blue and red arrows represent hole and electron mediated processes, respectively. Green arrows represent the photogeneration of electron–hole pairs. Black arrows represent recombination losses. Relative arrow thicknesses represent the rate of the processes (the thicker the arrow, the faster and more effective the process).	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Evolution of absorption spectra and (b) time traces of absorbance at 800 nm of WO3 and Al2O3/WO3 electrodes in the presence of an applied bias (at 1.3 V or 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the dark. The alumina overlayer was deposited by ALD for 30 cycles. Electrolyte: Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution (pH 1.0).	 

 	Scheme 2  Illustration of the population of electrons and holes trapped on (left) WO3 and (right) Al2O3/WO3 illuminated electrodes biased at a potential around the thermodynamic water oxidation potential (0.97 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Electrons (red full circles) and holes (blue open circles) are represented as free on the conduction (CB) and valence (VB) bands, respectively, or trapped at surface electron traps (red lines) or surface hole traps (blue lines) below and above the CB and VB edges, respectively. In both cases, the same total number of photogenerated electrons and holes (18) are depicted for a fair comparison.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Absorption time traces observed at 480 nm (photoholes in WO3)36 and (b) time-resolved absorption spectra at 2 μs after laser flash photolysis (355 nm, 250 μJ pulse−1) of WO3 (B, black squares) and Al2O3/WO3 (A, red circles) thin films in Ar-purged 0.1 M HClO4 solution and in the absence (OCP conditions) (for a) and presence of an applied bias (at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) (for a and b). The difference between both spectra (A − B) is represented by blue triangles. The alumina overlayer was deposited after 30 ALD cycles.	 

 	Fig. 7  Deconvoluted TAS spectra at 2 μs after laser flash photolysis of WO3 (a) and Al2O3/WO3 (b), 30 cycles of ALD films, under biased conditions (1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl) taken from Fig. 6b. Contributions from trapped electrons (red) and trapped holes (blue) are taken into account, using Gaussian peak functions for their modeling. The broad free electron contribution in the whole wavelength range was compensated in both cases using a power-type baseline.50 All fittings had regression coefficients (r) larger than 0.9800. Relative contributions of trapped holes (Ah) and trapped electrons (Ae) are highlighted on each case, taking the unmodified WO3 electrode as a reference.
