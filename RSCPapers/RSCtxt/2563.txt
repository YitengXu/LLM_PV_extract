China. E-mail: chenge@bjut.edu.cnReceived 7th July 2013, Accepted 21st August 2013First published on 27th August 2013AbstractWe fabricated a sandwich-like branched-polyethyleneimine (b-PEI)/TiO2/Au/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite through a biomimetic layer-by-layer co-mineralization approach, and the polymer b-PEI was believed to act as both an inducing agent for the hydrolysis of titanium bis(ammonium lactato)-dihydroxide (Ti-BALDH) and a reducing agent for the reduction of HAuCl4 in the synthetic procedure. Upon organic pyrolysis in air at 500 °C, a TiO2/Au nanosheet was formed; and gold nanocrystals were observed uniformly dispersed on TiO2 nanosheet. Moreover, the obtained TiO2/Au nanosheets demonstrated an enhanced lithium storage performance when they are used as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), particularly, a high capacity of 205 mA h g−1 and 189 mA h g−1 was obtained at 5 C and 10 C rate, respectively, indicating the high rate capability of the material. The greatly improved rate performance might be attributed from both the sheet-like nanostructure and the existence of uniformly dispersed gold nanocrystals, which facilitate electron transfer and lithium ions diffusion in the material. The result suggests that the TiO2 electrode performance can be improved through a design of sheet-like nanocomposites using a bio-inspired route, which is desirable for both “green synthesis” and application for high power LIBs, moreover, such a benign bio-inspired route can be developed into a general pathway to synthesize many other TiO2 based nanocomposites for broad applications in the fields of batteries, photoelectrochemistry, photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells.IntroductionSince the world is to face the upcoming threat of the exhaustion of fossil fuels and the continuing deterioration of global environment, it is very important to synthesize and control the inorganic material under an environmentally benign and energy efficient pathway. Recently, biomineralization inspired syntheses have emerged as alternatives to the harsh synthetic conditions traditionally used in inorganic material synthesis, as nature produces biominerals with exquisite nanostructures under benign conditions such as low temperature, ambient pressure and near-neutral pH.1 However, a majority of the known biominerals do not possess compositions that are particularly attractive for many man-made devices; thus, researchers have employed known biomineralization agents or analogous molecules to prepare non-natural but technologically interesting materials by emulating the chemistry of these natural mineralization pathways.2 In particular, a bio-inspired approach to synthesize TiO2 has attracted much attention due to its unique properties and many promising applications.3 Compared with the conventional polymer template method, the used bio-inspired agents (protein, peptide, long chain polyamine etc. derived from natural biomineralization or its analogous polymer) possess the ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of a titanium precursor (Ti-BALDH) rapidly at room temperature and neutral aqueous environment;4,5 also, the bio-inspired approach provides a new pathway to tailor the physicochemical properties with significant advantages over conventional methods. For example, the amino acid side chain functions were shown to be of particular importance with regard to the modification of the TiO2 structure and morphology;6 TiO2 mineralized by a β-sheet peptide nanofiber template forms fiber-like shapes that were not observed for mineralization by peptides in the shape of random coils;7 a monodispersed titania nanoparticle was obtained through the mineralization in the virus capsid;8 and a highly crystalline rutile phase can be obtained at room temperature and neutral pH when using recombinant silaffins as biomineralization agents.9 Although these achievements have benn made, the bio-inspired approach to synthesize TiO2 based nanocomposites was rarely reported; however, such structure has attracted tremendous attention because it integrated the diverse properties from different building blocks, which demonstrates the enhanced properties in the applications from energy conversion/storage to photocatalysis.10–13 Very recently, N doped CNTs/TiO2 core/shell nanowires were obtained through a biomimetic mineralization pathway;14 and a TiO2–SiO2–Ag nanocomposite was obtained by utilizing lysozyme as both an inducing agent of TiO2 and a reducing agent of Ag+; both materials exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity in catalyzing the decomposition of dyes under visible light irradiation.15 Thus, it is interesting to synthesize various TiO2 based nanocomposites with tailored properties through bio-inspired approaches.Herein, we have showed the use of aqueous, branched polyethyleneimine (b-PEI)-mediated layer-by-layer (LBL) titania/gold co-deposition to prepare b-PEI/titania/gold composite coatings on graphene oxide, so that a TiO2/Au nanosheet is formed after organic pyrolysis in air at 500 °C. The LBL mineralization of titania is a recently-developed technique which is often used to prepare conformal Ti–O coating, and protamine is often used as a mineralization agent for inducing the formation of TiO2 coating from a Ti-BALDH-bearing solution,16 and the deposition process was carried out on various templates in prior works, such as diatom frustules,17 calcium carbonate spheres,18 aluminum oxide template,19 silica spheres,20 nickel foam21 and graphene oxide.22 In our experiment, b-PEI was chosen to replace protamine for two reasons: firstly, as a mimic of biopolyamine in a diatom, b-PEI demonstrates the ability for biomineralization of TiO2 from a Ti-BALDH-bearing solution as well as protamine; secondly, it was reported that the b-PEI induced the reduction of HAuCl4 at room temperature.23,24 Thus, it is reasonable to assume the b-PEI would induce both the hydrolysis of Ti-BALDH and the reduction of HAuCl4 at the same time, resulting in the titania/gold composite in one deposition; and a sandwich-like b-PEI/titania/gold/GO composite nanosheet was synthesized through a LBL deposition approach on graphene oxide; after a heat treatment in air, the b-PEI and graphene oxide were removed, and a TiO2/Au nanosheet was obtained. Except for the annealing, the whole procedure was carried out under mild conditions such as room temperature, neutral environment aqueous system and no corrosive chemicals, which was desirable from the point view of “green” synthesis; also, the thickness of the nanosheet can be easily tailored by a change in the LBL cycles. More importantly, not only is the TiO2/Au nanosheet obtained using 2D graphene oxide as substrate, but the method could be expanded to fabricate 1D TiO2/Au nanotube and hollow TiO2/Au nanospheres when using carbon nanotubes and a carbon sphere as substrates, respectively. Also, the method could be expanded to prepare other TiO2/metal oxide nanocomposites for the used bio-inspired agents (b-PEI)'s strong complex ability with many metal ions.TiO2 is regarded as one of the ideal electrode materials for high power lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to advantages in terms of low cost, nontoxicity, structural stability and safety.25 Compared with graphite or other carbon-based materials, the best advantage of the TiO2 anode is its safety for the high working voltage (above 1.7 V vs. Li+/Li) avoiding lithium plating and formation of dendrite, which is very important for the fast charging/discharging process in the high power LIBs. However, the poor rate capability of TiO2 electrodes, which results from their low electrical conductivity and lithium diffusion coefficient, seriously hinders their practical application. Different strategies have been proposed to mitigate the above mentioned problem; one effective protocol is to create designed nanostructured TiO2 that can facilitate lithium diffusion of the material;26–29 another approach is to introduce conductive materials such as carbon nanotube, graphene and noble metals to improve the electron transport in the materials.30–34 Particularly, the gold nanocrystal was often used as a conductive agent to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode materials due to its excellent electronic conductivity and stability.35–38 In this paper, the obtained TiO2/Au nanosheets possess both sheet-like TiO2 nanostructure and uniformly dispersed gold nanocrystals, making them suitable for fast lithium storage; when used as anode material for LIBs, the TiO2/Au nanosheets electrode demonstrated enhanced rate capability, holding potential as electrode material for high power LIBs. To the author's knowledge, this is the first report on designing 2D TiO2/Au nanocomposite to improve LIBs performance through a bio-inspired route. And we anticipate that such a benign bio-inspired approach can be developed into a general pathway to synthesize TiO2 based nanocomposites for broad applications in the fields of photoelectrochemistry, photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells.ExperimentalSynthesis of TiO2/Au nanosheetGraphene oxide solution (Graphene-supermarket) was used as the 2D substrate/template and branched polyethyleneimine (b-PEI, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an inducing agent; first, the b-PEI was adsorbed on graphene oxide (GO) by mixing the graphene oxide solution (0.5 mg mL−1, 25 mL) and buffered b-PEI solution (Tris–HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mL, 6 wt‰) through an electrostatic interaction; and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h; the obtained GO/b-PEI composite was then centrifuged and rinsed twice with deionized water to remove the residual b-PEI and re-dispersed in 20 mL of deionized water homogeneously, followed by dropwise adding of the mixed aqueous solution containing 9.0 mL titanium bis(ammonium lactato)-dihydroxide (Ti-BALDH) (11 g L−1, pH 6.8, Alfa Aesar) and 4.5 mL HAuCl4 (3.3 g L−1) to obtain the Au–Ti–O layer upon the surface of GO/b-PEI. After centrifuging and washing with deionised water twice, a GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O composite was obtained. Through repeating the b-PEI adsorption and Au–Ti–O layer formation procedure for 5 cycles, a sandwich-like GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheet was obtained; and the product TiO2/Au nanosheet was formed after organic pyrolysis in air at 500 °C for 3 h. For comparison, a pure TiO2 nanosheet was prepared using a similar procedure without adding HAuCl4 species in the Ti-BALDH aqueous solution.Materials characterizationThe X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were measured by a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The zeta-potentials were measured in deionised water using a Zetasizer NS instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern). Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were recorded on a Seiko Instruments 6300 TG-DTA device. A SHIMADZU UV-2450 spectrophotometer was used for UV-vis measurements. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were performed on a Hitachi S-4300 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) were taken with a Tecnai F20 microscope equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive spectroscopy analyzer at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on an Axis Ultra (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) instrument with monochromated Al-Kα radiation and an energy resolution of 0.48 eV. The ratio of Au/TiO2 was characterized by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (IRIS Intrepid ER/S).Electrochemical measurementFor preparing the electrodes, the anatase TiO2 nanosheets, Carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (Aldrich) binder in a weight ratio of 75:15:10 were mixed to a slurry with N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP), then the slurry was pasted on to pure Cu foil. The active material loading was 1.5–1.7 mg cm−2. The electrodes were vacuum dried for 12 h at 100 °C. Glass fiber (Whatman) was used as a separator. Pure lithium foil (Aldrich) was used as the counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF6-ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DMC, 50:50 v/v) was used as an electrolyte. The coin cell (CR2032 type) assembly was carried out in a re-circulating argon glove box (H2O < 1 ppm, O2 < 1 ppm). Galvanostatic chronopotentiometries were tested on a Neware Battery Tester (Shenzhen, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the electrodes were carried out on an electrochemical workstation, (VMP3) and the impedance spectra were obtained by applying a sine wave with an amplitude of 5.0 mV over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz to the TiO2 and TiO2/Au nanosheet electrodes after 5 cycles at 1 C.Results and discussionThe layer-by-layer titania–gold co-mineralization approach is schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. Zeta potential measurements demonstrated oscillation after each alternating exposure to the buffered b-PEI solution and the mixed solution of Ti-BALDH and HAuCl4 (Fig. 1), which agreed well with the positively-charged b-PEI molecules or negatively-charged titania, respectively. The LBL deposition process was also monitored by a UV-vis spectrum, a major peak at 250–270 nm was observed which was attributed to the existence of Ti–O deposition; besides, there is a minor peak at 550–570 nm, indicating the existence of Au species; and both peaks increase with the deposition procedure repeating, suggesting the increasing amount of Ti–O deposition and Au species (Fig. 2). However, the red shifts in the absorbance maximum are observed both in the Ti–O deposition at the wavelength range from 250 to 270 nm and Au species at 550–570 nm, it may be due to the growth of the Ti–O deposition and Au species. The GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheets were then annealed at 500 °C in the air for 3 h.

Fig. 2  UV-vis spectrum of GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheets after the deposition of each layer. TGA (Fig. 3) showed that the weight loss below 150 °C for GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheets was 12.4%, which might be considered the loss of adsorbed water; and a large weight loss (32.2%) was observed between 150 °C and 650 °C which might be attributed to the decomposition of b-PEI and GO. Fig. 3  Thermogravimetric analysis of the GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheets upon heating at 5 °C min−1 to 800 °C in air. Fig. 4 showed the XRD pattern of the obtained materials before and after organic pyrolysis; while the as prepared material displayed an amorphous structure, the diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 and gold were clearly observed after organic pyrolysis, which matches well the standard patterns of anatase (JCPDS card no. 21-1272) and gold (JCPDS card no. 04-0784). The calculated average crystallite sizes (using the Scherrer formula) for the anatase in the (101) direction and gold in the (111) direction are estimated to be about 8 and 5 nm, respectively. Fig. 5 demonstrated the SEM image of a GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheets via an exposure to 5 deposition cycles before and after organic pyrolysis; a large amount of nanosheets with a thickness of about 35 nm were observed, and there are numerous nanocrystals uniformly dispersed on the nanosheets, which was believed to be Au nanocrystals (Fig. 5b); the homogeneous distribution of Au nanoparticles in TiO2 nanosheets was also confirmed by EDX mapping results (Fig. S1†), which displayed a uniform distribution of Au signal on the nanosheets; however, the Au nanocrystals were not observed on the nanosheets before organic pyrolysis (Fig. 5a), which could be explained by the partial reduction of Au species (cluster) buried into the polymer/Ti–O bearing nanosheets, and the heat treatment facilitates the crystallization and growth of Au species, making it observed on the titania nanosheets.

Fig. 5  Scanning electron microscopy images of the samples before (a) and after pyrolysis (b), bar: 500 nm. Fig. 6a revealed the TEM images of samples after the organic pyrolysis, It can be observed that the Au nanoparticles with a size of 5–8 nm are well-dispersed on the anatase TiO2 sheet-like structures without agglomeration. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) showed a typical multiple rings pattern (inset in Fig. 6a), and lattice planes of the anatase TiO2 (101), (200), (211) and Au (111) were clearly indexed in the SAED patterns. Fig. 6b showed a high resolution TEM image, a lattice spacing of 0.352 nm is observed, which corresponds to the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2; and the lattice spacing of 0.235 nm is attributed to the (111) plane of the Au nanocrystals. Fig. 6  (a) Transmission electron microscopy image of TiO2/Au nanosheet, bar: 50 nm; inset: selected-area electron diffraction of TiO2/Au nanosheet. (b) High resolution transmission electron microscopy image of TiO2/Au nanosheet, bar: 5 nm; the lattice spacings of 0.352 and 0.235 nm were attributed to the (101) reflections from the anatase TiO2 and the (111) reflections from the gold nanocrystal, respectively. Fig. 7a showed the XPS full spectrum of a nanosheet before and after pyrolysis, which demonstrates that the C, O, Ti, Au and N species were only observed in the sample before pyrolysis, indicating the obtained TiO2/Au nanosheet is free of b-PEI. The C 1s spectrum (Fig. 7b) before pyrolysis has four main peaks corresponding to the following bonds: aliphatic C*H–CH (284.83 eV) that may have originated from adventitious carbon, and the peaks at 285.88, 286.41 and 288.38 eV might be attributed to –C*–NH2, –C*–OH and –C*O, respectively, which was believed to come from the b-PEI and graphene oxide. After pyrolysis, only the peak at 284.81 eV was observed, indicating the b-PEI and graphene oxide were removed after pyrolysis. The Au 4f spectra (Fig. 7c) for the sample before pyrolysis showed two pairs of peaks, which corresponds to the Au (0) and Au(III) species, respectively; and only one pair of Au 4f peak was observed after pyrolysis, corresponding to the Au (0) species. It can be explained that the b-PEI induced partial reduction of HAuCl4 in the LbL depositing procedure, and the Au(III) species was further reduced to Au (0) species in the pyrolysis process; note the Au 4f7/2 binding energy of the sample after pyrolysis (83.19 eV) was a little higher than that before pyrolysis (83.04 eV), indicating a strong interaction between Au and TiO2. And the atoms content of Au nanocrystals after pyrolysis in TiO2/Au nanosheet was 8.9 at.%, which is close to the compositional analysis result (9.3 at.%, equals to 20.2 wt%) using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Note that the Au/TiO2 ratio can be easily tailored by a change of HAuCl4 concentration in the Ti-BALDH solution. Fig. 7  (a) XPS of the samples before (GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheet) and after organic pyrolysis (TiO2/Au nanosheet); (b) high-resolution spectra of the C 1s sample before and after organic pyrolysis; (c) and (d) high-resolution spectra of Au 4f and Ti 2p the samples before and after organic pyrolysis. Fig. 7d demonstrated the Ti 2p spectra, where it can be observed that the binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 shifted from 458.13 to 458.59 eV after pyrolysis. The slightly increased binding energy might be attributed to the stronger Ti–O bond after crystallization.Galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements of TiO2/Au nanosheet were performed over the potential range of 1.0 to 3.0 V (versus Li+/Li) by a standard method based on a TiO2/Au nanosheet/Li half-cell, which TiO2/Au nanosheet and lithium foil served as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. For comparison, the electrochemical performance of TiO2 nanosheet was also evaluated. A high initial discharge capacity of 375 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 311 mA h g−1 were obtained for TiO2/Au nanosheet, corresponding to only 17.1% initial capacity loss; while the TiO2 nanosheet demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 312 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 254 mA h g−1, corresponding to 18.6% initial capacity loss (Fig. 8a). Note the initial charge capacity of 311 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency (82.9%) for TiO2/Au nanosheet were both superior to many other reported materials,25,30,32,33,38–42 which are important for LIBs practical applications. A typical plateau was observed at a potential of 1.7 V, where a Li-rich phase (LixTiO2, 0.15 < x < 0.5) was expected to coexist with the anatase TiO2 phase, this plateau signified a biphasic region, which is typical of Li insertion into the anatase TiO2 electrode.43–45 Note that the plateau for the TiO2/Au nanosheet is obviously longer than that for the TiO2 nanosheet, which leads to a higher capacity for the TiO2/Au nanosheet. Fig. 8  (a) Initial galvanostatic discharge/charge profiles for TiO2/Au nanosheet and TiO2 nanosheet electrodes; (b) charge/discharge curves for the TiO2/Au nanosheet and TiO2 nanosheet electrodes at 5 C and 10 C current rates, respectively; (c) cycling performance of TiO2/Au nanosheet and TiO2 nanosheet electrodes at 5 C and 10 C current rates; (d) cycling performance of TiO2/Au nanosheet electrode at a high rate of 40 C; (e) impedance spectrum for TiO2/Au nanosheet and TiO2 nanosheet electrodes. Fig. 8b demonstrated the charge/discharge curves at high rates for TiO2/Au and TiO2 nanosheets, respectively; while the TiO2/Au nanosheet showed a capacity of 205 and 189 mA h g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively, which was higher than those of TiO2 nanosheet (178 and 153 mA h g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively). Note that the polarization of ΔE (defined as the difference between the potential of the plateau of discharge and charge) of TiO2/Au nanosheet (5 C is 0.308 V, 10 C is 0.335 V) was obviously smaller than that (5 C is 0.436 V, 10 C is 0.504 V) of TiO2 nanosheet; the lower ΔE of TiO2/Au might be attributed to its low Ohmic resistance of the electrode, resulting from the existence of Au species, and leading to the enhanced rate performance in LIBs. The cyclability at high rates for TiO2/Au and TiO2 nanosheet was also investigated (Fig. 8c). In the case of TiO2/Au nanosheet, the reversible capacities were retained at 189 and 179 mA h g−1 at 5 and 10 C, respectively, after 100 cycles. In contrast, the capacity of TiO2 nanosheet without gold nanocrystals only exhibited 163 and 154 mA h g−1 under the same testing conditions. Even at high rate of 40 C, a capacity of 124 mA h g−1 can still be delivered after 2000 cycles for TiO2/Au nanosheet (Fig. 8d). Apparently, such rate performance of TiO2/Au nanosheet was superior to that of most of the previously reported TiO2-based nanomaterials25,33 under similar testing conditions. The high rate capability of the material might be attributed to both the sheet-like nanostructure and the existence of uniformly dispersed gold nanocrystals, which facilitates electrons transfer and lithium ions diffusion in the material; and the different performances between TiO2/Au and TiO2 nanosheet also emphasized the improved efficiency of the electrochemical properties of titania by incorporation of gold nanocrystals. In order to understand the remarkable rate performance of the TiO2/Au nanosheet as compared to the TiO2 nanosheet, AC impedance spectra measurements were carried out. Fig. 8e demonstrates the Nyquist plots for both samples. It can be observed that the diameter of the semicircle for the TiO2/Au nanosheet in the high-medium frequency region was much smaller than that of the TiO2 nanosheet, which suggested that the TiO2/Au nanosheet possesses lower contact and charge-transfer resistances. The exact kinetic differences between the TiO2/Au and TiO2 nanosheets were inspected by modeling the AC impedance spectra based on the modified Randles equivalent circuit. The values of the ohmic resistance (RΩ) and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) were 2.2 and 24.3 Ω, respectively, for TiO2/Au nanosheet, which was lower than those of the TiO2 nanosheet (3.9 and 36.2 Ω). This result further confirmed that the gold nanocrystals in titania nanosheets enhance the electrochemical activity of TiO2 during the cycle processes.ConclusionIn summary, we have fabricated a sandwich-like b-PEI/Au–Ti–O/GO nanocomposite using a biomimetic layer-by-layer co-mineralization process on GO, and the polymer b-PEI was believed to act as both an inducing agent for the hydrolysis of Ti-BALDH and a reducing agent for the reduction of HAuCl4 in the synthesis procedure, a TiO2/Au nanosheet was formed after organic pyrolysis in air at 500 °C; and gold nanocrystals were observed uniformly dispersed on the TiO2 nanosheet. The GO/b-PEI/Au–Ti–O nanosheet and TiO2/Au nanosheet were characterized by various techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. More importantly, the obtained TiO2/Au nanosheets demonstrated high specific capacity and rate capability when they were used as anode material for LIBs, suggesting that the battery performance of TiO2 can be improved through a design of sheet-like nanocomposites using a bio-inspired route. The result is interesting for both “green synthesis” and application of high power LIBs, moreover, such a benign bio-inspired route can be developed into a general pathway to synthesize many other TiO2 based nanocomposites for broad applications in the fields of batteries, photoelectrochemistry, photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC 21001012) and the Beijing Nova Program (2009B06) and the Scientific Research Common Program of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education (KM201210005005).ReferencesS.
