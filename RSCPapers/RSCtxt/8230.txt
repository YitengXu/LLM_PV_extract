    , Accepted 10th April 2022First published on 19th April 2022AbstractPhotocatalytic hydrogen evolution is one promising method for solar energy conversion, but the rapid charge recombination limits its efficiency. To this end, in this work, grain size, and hence the charge carrier migration path, is reduced by lowering the synthesis temperature of two-dimensional visible light-responsive La2NiO4 perovskite. Interestingly, the hydrogen yield for the piezoelectric response of La2NiO4 under only 40 kHz ultrasonic vibration is as high as 680 μmol h−1 g−1, which is 80 times that under only 600 mW cm−2 visible light irradiation. More surprisingly, the hydrogen production rate under both light illumination and ultrasonic vibration is 129 times higher than under visible light irradiation alone. Clearly, a synergistic effect exists between piezocatalysis and photocatalysis. The hydrogen production activity of the samples with water splitting can reach 1097 μmol h−1 g−1 without any sacrificial reagent or co-catalyst, when the light intensity reaches about 1000 mW cm−2, which is a much higher hydrogen evolution rate by piezo-photocatalysis than is achieved by either piezocatalysis or photocatalysis individually. Further analysis indicates that the internal electric field generated by deformation of the La2NiO4 edge under piezoelectric action facilitates the directional separation and migration of photogenerated charges, which in turn significantly enhances the efficiency of use of photogenerated charges for hydrogen production. The investigation here provides a novel approach to design a new reaction system for hydrogen production by coupling multiple external physical fields.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, alongside the huge daily energy consumption, burning of fossil fuels has caused serious environmental pollution. It is an urgent issue to seek clean and renewable energy.1,2 Different technologies, such as photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, are used to produce hydrogen by water splitting.3 Photocatalytic technology has the advantages of mild reaction conditions and direct use of sunlight to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen.4 However, the development of photocatalytic technology depends on efficient light utilization, appropriate choice of semiconductor catalyst and inhibition of photogenerated charge recombination.5
In recent years, researchers have found that piezoelectric nanoparticles and nanocomposites can achieve hydrogen evolution under excitation from mechanical vibration.5,6 This not only greatly improves the migration rate of charge carriers, but also broadens the path of hydrogen production. The piezoelectric effect is a physical phenomenon of the transformation of mechanical and electrical energy following the deformation of piezoelectric materials with asymmetric crystal structures.7 Tiny vibrational energies can drive the deformation of nanometer/micrometer-sized materials, resulting in uneven distribution of positive and negative charges and producing a piezoelectric potential.8 Under the action of pressure or tension, charge carriers can achieve directional separation driven by a depolarized electric field and can further participate in the reaction.9,10
Perovskite oxides have been widely studied in the field of catalysis due to their ferromagnetism, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties and their electron/ion conductivity in complex oxide structures containing a variety of metallic elements.11–13 La2NiO4 perovskite has various advantages, such as narrow band gap, low cost, easy preparation, high chemical stability, pollution free, etc.14 It has been employed as a semiconductor photocatalyst with good visible light response for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, water splitting and CO2 reduction. However, its low specific surface area and rapid recombination of photogenerated charges lead to unsatisfactory photocatalytic efficiency.15 For the past few years, scholars have carried out considerable research to solve these shortcomings. Tiwari et al. obtained LaNiO3 catalyst with high specific surface area by sol–gel sintering at lower temperatures, and its catalytic activity for the oxygen precipitation reaction was found to be prominent.16 Luo et al. prepared the Z-scheme La2NiO4/g-C3N4 composite material, which promoted the separation of photogenerated charges, and enhanced the degradation of methyl orange under visible light.17 Nevertheless, the mechanical and electrical energy conversion ability of La2NiO4 have frequently been overlooked. There is an asymmetric structure in the crystal structure of La2NiO4, which makes the local centers of positive and negative charges asymmetric. The structure of the asymmetric center produces macroscopic electric dipole moments that accumulate different kinds of charge on the surface of the material.18 This piezoelectric effect can generate a voltage potential field inside the material, and the internal electric field can be used to promote separation of the charge carriers.19 At present, some polar piezoelectric materials, such as SrTiO3,20 PbTiO3,21 and BiOIO3,22 have been applied in the field of catalysis.23 Hong et al. first reported the use of ultrasonic vibration to induce bending of BaTiO3 dendrite microwires and ZnO nanowires to induce the generation of piezoelectric charges for the complete decomposition of aquatic hydrogen to produce oxygen.24 Wu et al. achieved fast degradation of dyes in an ultrasonic bath by using a self-assembled flower-bulb structure of single-layer MoS2 nanosheets.25 Xue et al. used ZnO nanowires to improve the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes by generating a potential through rolling friction, and they found that the photocatalytic degradation rate showed a slight increase with increasing frequency.26 In brief, the internal electric field generated when an external pressure is applied to the piezoelectric material can be used as an accelerator for charge separation27 to improve the separation efficiency of the carriers,28 while ultrasonic force can be used as a simple and feasible pressure source. Huang et al. used PbTiO3 coated with CdS particles, which exhibited a much higher H2 production rate at 849.0 μmol h−1 g−1 by piezo-photocatalysis.29 Zhao et al. used CdS nanorods combined with the piezoelectric effect and visible light to achieve a high H2 production rate of 20 mL h−1 under an optimized coupling field.30 However, the coupling of piezoelectric catalysis and photocatalysis in hydrogen production is still less reported.
In this study, a two-dimensional (2D) La2NiO4 perovskite was prepared by a modified citric acid method. The piezoelectric effect of La2NiO4 was combined with the light response of La2NiO4. In particular, the factors affecting photocatalytic performance were studied by structural characterization and optical measurements. Furthermore, the mechanism of the piezoelectric field in La2NiO4 catalytic hydrogen production was explored by adjusting the intensity of the ultrasonic field. On this basis, the effects of grain size, light intensity, and ultrasonic frequency on the hydrogen production performance were studied in detail. Meanwhile, a new catalytic hydrogen production route was explored. This coupled effect of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis can be widely used in the development of multifield coupling hydrogen production devices in the future.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials preparation
The analytical grade reagents, La(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, C6H8O7·H2O, HNO3, and NH4OH, were purchased from Sino-Pharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

2.1.1 La2NiO4 preparation. 
La2NiO4 powders were synthesized by a modified citric acid method and a simple calcination route. La(NO3)3·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 100 mL dilute nitric acid and continuously stirred by a magnetic stirrer. After the solution become clear, NH4OH was added to adjust the pH value of the solution to 8.5. The C6H8O7·H2O complexing agent was then gradually added under stirring. A blue gel was obtained by heating the solution at 100 °C in an oil bath for 8 hours under continuous stirring. The gel was then allowed to dry completely in an oven at 90 °C for 10 hours. Finally, the precursor powder was calcined in a muffle with different temperatures for 6 h to obtain La2NiO4 with different grain sizes.

2.2. Catalyst characterization
The lattice parameters and chemical composition of the material were determined using a Panalytical X’ Pert MPD Pro X-ray diffractometer (XRD) at 40 mA current and 40 kV voltage. A JEOL field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM7800F) was used to determine the particle size and micromorphology of the samples. The particle distribution of all the samples was obtained using an FEI Tecnai G2F30 S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 300 kV. The absorbance of the sample was measured using a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) to obtain the ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PTI Quanta Master 40) at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 porosity analyzer and used to obtain the pore structures and specific surface area of all samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements were recorded using an accelerated specific surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA) with N2 adsorption analysis.
2.3. Photoelectric and piezoelectric measurements
In the three-electrode cell (fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the working electrode, platinum plate as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution with pH = 6.8 as the electrolyte), the transient current density was recorded at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl voltage under light irradiation to obtain the photoelectric response of the material. The piezoelectric response of the material in an ultrasonic field was measured using an ultrasonic machine (100 W and 40 kHz) under dark conditions. The working electrode was prepared as follows. A well-dispersed suspension was formed by using 1 mg of catalyst sample, 250 μL deionized water, 250 μL ethanol, and 10 μL 10 wt% Nafion solution, and was treated with ultrasound for 30 minutes. After that, the 100 μL of dispersion mixture obtained was dropped onto a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 FTO glass and then dried at room temperature.
The piezoelectric response of the as-prepared sample was characterized using a piezoresponse force microscope (XE7, Park Systems). After the La2NiO4 powder had been well dispersed with alcohol, a drop of the liquid was dropped onto the Pt-plated silicon wafer to keep the test surface flat. After the alcohol had evaporated, the surface was swamped by nitrogen to confirm that there was no moving powder. The silicon wafer was then fixed onto the sample platform with carbon glue. The sample platform and Pt on the surface of the silicon wafer were connected with the carbon glue to form a test loop.
2.4. H2 evolution tests
The hydrogen production performance from an aqueous solution under gas-tight conditions was measured in a side-irradiated PYREX cell. The simulated visible light source was obtained using a 300 W xenon lamp and the pressure source for the mechanical energy was acquired using an ultrasonic machine (100 W and 40 kHz). The hydrogen production performance in the piezoelectric field was tested by adjusting the power (70–100 W), temperature (40–70 °C), and frequency (20–40 kHz) of the ultrasonic machine. The hydrogen obtained was extracted every hour with a syringe, and detected using a thermal conductivity detector gas chromatograph with a NaX zeolite column and Ar as carrier gas. In the H2 production test, 10 mg catalyst and 80 mL deionized water were placed into a gas-tight hydrogen production bottle. Ar was used to fully purge the air for 40 minutes before each hydrogen production cycle. Gas was collected three times for each measurement and the average value was taken for the experimental data to eliminate test errors.
2.5. COMSOL simulation
In order to have a deeper understanding of the piezoelectric catalytic performance of La2NiO4 nanoplates, the piezoelectric potential distribution generated under ultrasonic vibration was simulated using the finite element method (FEM) with COMSOL Multiphysics software. The geometrical parameters of width, length, and height were set as 40 nm × 80 nm × 20 nm, respectively, for the La2NiO4 model. Taking into account the acoustic pressure generated by the ultrasonic vibration, which can reach as high as 105 Pa, for simplicity the FEM simulations were carried out at 105 Pa along the x- and y-axes, respectively. The results were shown in the rainbow color range.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystalline structure and composition analysis
The XRD patterns of La2NiO4 synthesized at 750 °C–1000 °C are shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks of samples at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C exhibit characteristics of only the La2NiO4 perovskite structure, and no impurity diffraction peaks can be observed. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of the sample synthesized at 1000 °C are sharper with the half-peak width being smaller than at the other two temperatures, indicating the increasing grain size with increasing calcining temperature for the samples.31 However, impurity phase LaNiO3 diffraction peaks begin to appear when the temperature drops to 850 °C, and the characteristic peaks of La2NiO4 gradually become less sharp, which indicates that the phase formation temperature of the La2NiO4 samples is above 900 °C. The XRD patterns were indexed using standard cards of the orthorhombic crystal system La2NiO4 (PDF file 01-079-0951) and the rhombohedral crystal system LaNiO3 (PDF file no. 00-033-0711). The diffraction peaks at 27.858° and 31.283° belong to (110) and (103) crystal faces of La2NiO4, respectively. In addition, the lattice parameters and single-cell volumes are shown in Table 1. The above results demonstrate that La2NiO4 perovskite can be successfully prepared by the improved sol–gel method at a calcination temperature of more than 900 °C.

To further verify the effect of the phase formation temperature on sample morphology, Fig. 2 shows SEM images displaying the morphology and particle size of the La2NiO4 formed at different temperatures, which were calculated using the Scherrer formula:  L = K·λ/(β·cosθ)(1) where L is the crystallite size along the normal direction of the crystal plane, K is Scherrer's constant (0.89), β is the full width at half-maximum of the diffraction peak, θ is the grazing angle, and λ is the wavelength of the incoming ray, which is Scheller's constant 0.15406 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the La2NiO4 phase formed at 1000 °C presents a nanoplate shape, and the particle size is 54.96 nm according to Scherrer's formula. Likewise, the particle sizes of the nanoplates decreased with decrease in the calcining temperature, and the particle sizes calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula are about 33.58 nm and 23.48 nm for calcination at 950 °C and 900 °C, respectively. However, in addition to the two-dimensional La2NiO4, granular LaNiO3 was also formed when the temperature was reduced to 850 °C, as shown by the dotted area in Fig. 2g. According to Fig. 2, the particle size decreases with decreasing phase-forming temperature. On the other hand, the impurity phase exists in the sample at 850 °C, which is consistent with the XRD patterns.

The BET surface area and pore diameter of La2NiO4 synthesized at different temperatures were measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. 3. The samples were kept at 230 °C for 4 h to remove water and impurity gases before testing. The specific surface areas of La2NiO4 synthesized at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C were about 5.4992, 5.7390, and 5.9240 m2·g−1, respectively. The surface area increases with decrease in particle size of the photocatalyst. Enhanced surface area and more reactive sites increases the probability of the photogenerated carrier interacting with the reactants, and thus increases the hydrogen production activity.32,33 All these properties indicate the potentially improved catalytic activity for La2NiO4 synthesized at 900 °C compared to other temperatures.

Furthermore, the samples synthesized at 900 °C have more abundant pore structures than those synthesized at 950 °C and 1000 °C, according to the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. In general, the porous structure can provide quantities of active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.34 In addition, as the grain size of the catalytic material decreases, the time for the photogenerated charge to diffuse from the inside of the grain to the surface is shortened, which makes it possible to improve the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, although the specific surface area increases with the decrease in sintering temperature, the degree of improvement is limited. In addition, the hydrogen production efficiency is determined not only by the number of reactive sites, but also by other factors.
To investigate the surface composition and valence states of the elements in La2NiO4, samples were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The O 1s XPS spectrum in Fig. 4a can be divided into two symmetrical peaks. The lattice oxygen (Olat.) positioned at 531.7 eV, 531.8 eV, and 531.9 eV for the different synthesis temperatures, can be related to the La–O and Ni–O bonds in La2NiO4. The surface-adsorbed oxygen species (Oads.) corresponds to the peaks positioned at 533.1 eV, 533.1 eV, and 533.4 eV, respectively.35 The XPS peaks of La 3d5/2 in La2NiO4 synthesized at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C are located at slightly different binding energies, namely 834.9 eV, 834.9 eV, and 834.2 eV (Fig. 4b), respectively. Similarly, the La 3d5/2 peaks are located around 855.1 eV, 855.1 eV, and 854.7 eV, respectively. This indicates that La exists in La2NiO4 as La3+. The high-resolution Ni 2p spectrum of the sample displayed two conspicuous peaks that could be assigned to the characteristic peaks of Ni 2p3/2, indicating that the chemical state of Ni is present as Ni2+ in La2NiO4. Shifts of the XPS peaks have been observed with increase in the synthesis temperature. This could be attributed to the change in the local coordination environment of the atoms in compounds, which affects the binding energy of the atomic electrons.36 The binding energy of the sample synthesized at 900 °C moved to a slightly lower energy position, which tends to shorten the charge transfer pathway.17

3.2. Optical and piezoelectric properties
The optical absorption properties of La2NiO4 sintered at different temperatures were compared according to their UV-visible absorbance spectra. Pure La2NiO4 has spectral absorption in the whole visible range, as shown in Fig. 5a, which means that La2NiO4 perovskite has excellent light absorption properties. Below a wavelength of 350 nm, the samples sintered at 1000 °C and 950 °C have similar light absorption properties, while the sample sintered at 950 °C has better light absorption properties than the sample sintered at 1000 °C when the wavelength is above 350 nm. Specifically, when the synthesis temperature is reduced to 900 °C, La2NiO4 exhibits the best light absorption activity. The band gap difference for La2NiO4 synthesized at different temperatures is not obvious. At the same time, La2NiO4 with a narrower band gap has a better visible light response than conventional oxides.37–39

Photoluminescence is commonly used to reveal the migration, transfer, separation, and recombination processes of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in photocatalysts.40,41 Thus, steady-state PL spectral analysis was carried out on the samples and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. La2NiO4 has an emission peak at about 400 nm, which is due to carrier recombination. It can be seen that for the PL emission peaks located at 400 nm, their intensities decrease with decrease in the sintering temperature. What is more, the PL emission peak intensity of samples sintered at 900 °C is the weakest, indicating that the charge recombination within this material is the lowest. The results reveal that reduction in grain size can effectively reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers and improve the separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers.
The transient photocurrent and piezocurrent responses of La2NiO4 are shown in Fig. 6a and b. The largest photocurrent, which was observed for La2NiO4 synthesized at 900 °C, further proves the highest separation efficiency of photogenerated charges. For the transient current under an ultrasonic field, high-frequency vibration in the ultrasonic field causes current fluctuation. Meanwhile, turning the ultrasonic field on and off has a duration of 5 seconds for both processes, which means there is some residual fluctuation when the ultrasonic machine is turned off. Residual fluctuation in the water resonates with the nanoplates, causing the current to bounce back. The piezoelectric response of the La2NiO4 nanoplates absorbs this mechanical energy to produce electron–hole pairs, induces directional separation of electron–hole pairs, and inhibits their internal recombination.42 Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out in the dark condition with frequencies of 1 kHz and 500 Hz, and are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The potential versus the reversible hydrogen electrode was converted from the potential versus Ag/AgCl by using the equation below: (2)where EAg/AgCl is the applied voltage and  is 0.1976 V at 25 °C. It can be seen in Fig. 6c and Fig. S1† that the flat band potential is −1.13 V, −1.10 V, and −1.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which corresponds to La2NiO4 synthesized at 900 °C, 950 °C, and 1000 °C, respectively. These values were adjusted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) scale as −0.53 V, −0.50 V, and −0.45 V, respectively. The flat band potential approximates to the conduction band (CB) position.43 The corresponding optical band gap of La2NiO4 was estimated to be 2.4 eV from the UV-visible spectrum. Thus, the valence band (VB) can be deduced to be 1.87, 1.90, and 1.95 eV according to ECB = EVB − Eg, respectively. In addition, according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 6d), the slope of the curve for the sample synthesized at 900 °C was the lowest, indicating that the carrier concentration was high and the charge transfer fast, both of which could contribute to improving the activity of photocatalytic hydrogen production.44

The piezoelectric property of La2NiO4 synthesized at 900 °C was confirmed by piezoelectric force microscopy measurements. Fig. 7a shows the clear lamellar morphology, which is consistent with the SEM image analysis. The more stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) atomic force microscopy image shows the stacked lamellar structure, with a thickness of about 20 nm, as can be seen in Fig. 7b. Moreover, the oscillation signals of the cantilever were read out as phase and amplitude signals by applying a voltage range of −10 V to 10 V to the sample. As shown in Fig. 7c, the local polarization–electric field loop (P–E) of the La2NiO4 nanoplate shows obvious hysteresis, indicating a strong ferroelectric response.45 Furthermore, in Fig. 7d, the typical butterfly shape of the amplitude curve verifies the excellent local piezoelectric response.46

To further explore the separation effect of the polarization field generated by the piezoelectric effect on the carrier, 1% Pt particles were photodeposited and piezodeposited on the surface of the La2NiO4 from the precursor H2PtCl6·6H2O for 5 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8a, photodeposited Pt was deposited on the surface and edge of the material without any selectivity. On the other hand, the piezodeposited Pt particles were deposited at the edge of the material, as seen in Fig. 8b. The electrons selectively migrate to the edge of the material under the action of the piezoelectric field generated by the ultrasonic treatment. The reduction site of the Pt particles provides the location for the active site for electron enrichment. A large number of electrons reduce Pt4+ to Pt particles. Therefore, the position of the platinum particle can be used as the direction of electron migration.34 The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and the corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer elemental mapping for La, O, Ni, and Pt elements are shown in Fig. 8c, which further reveals that the distribution of Pt is closer to the edge in the corresponding region. Furthermore, the atomic percentages of La, O, Ni, and Pt were 72.9%, 19.6%, 6.1%, and 1.4%, respectively.

3.3. Hydrogen production
To measure the photocatalytic hydrogen production properties of La2NiO4 synthesized at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C, the optimal loading of La2NiO4 was studied under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm) without noble metal co-catalysts. Methanol (20 vol%) was used as a sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic hydrogen production. La2NiO4 synthesized at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C exhibited 5.81, 6.93, and 8.48 μmol h−1 g−1 hydrogen production rates, respectively, as shown in Fig. 9a. The amount of photocatalytic hydrogen production tended to increase when the synthesis temperature was reduced. Compared with the sample synthesized at 1000 °C, the hydrogen production per hour for the sample synthesized at 900 °C increased by 46%. However, the overall amount of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was still very inferior, which indicates that, although the samples have good visible light response, serious recombination of photogenerated carriers leads to unsatisfactory hydrogen production activity. On the other hand, piezoelectric catalytic hydrogen production was carried out under the condition of no sacrificial reagent, and the pressure source was from an ultrasonic machine. As shown in Fig. 9b, similarly to the photocatalytic hydrogen production, the amount of hydrogen production also increased with decrease in the synthesis temperature. It is worth noting that the hydrogen production was much higher than that for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. La2NiO4 synthesized at 1000 °C, 950 °C, and 900 °C showed hydrogen production rates of up to 454, 534, and 680 μmol h−1 g−1, respectively, in the ultrasonic machine (40 kHz, 100 W). Meanwhile, the hydrogen production of anatase phase TiO2 (without a piezoelectric response) under ultrasonic conditions was tested as a control, to exclude the influence of the cavitation effect, which shows that almost no hydrogen was produced by cavitation. The internal polarization of La2NiO4 can be generated under ultrasonic vibration, and the charge carrier can be separated and migrated directionally with the function of the polarization field.47 As the synthesis temperature decreases, the carrier migration path decreases and the carrier migration efficiency is improved, so that piezoelectric catalytic water splitting without any additive or sacrificial agent can be realized. In addition, it was found that the piezoelectric catalytic activity was closely related to the polarization of ferroelectric materials, which undergo a structural phase transition when the reaction temperature exceeds the Curie temperature, resulting in an abrupt change in spontaneous polarization around this temperature.48,49 Zhou et al. found that the crystal structure of La2NiO4 changed from an orthogonal to a tetragonal phase near the Curie temperature (427 °C).50 Therefore, to make use of the ferroelectric polarization properties of materials, the materials need to be in the crystalline phase below the Curie temperature. The water in the ultrasonic machine will heat up with the reaction, and the temperature can reach up to 60 °C, which will not lead to phase transformation of La2NiO4.

(f) The amount of H2 production of both ultrasonic vibration and full spectrum light irradiation versus different light intensity from water splitting. 
To explore whether the reaction conditions below the Curie temperature lead to material phase transition, Fig. 9c shows the amount of piezoelectric catalytic hydrogen production over time at different temperatures without any sacrificial agent. There is no difference in the amount of hydrogen evolution at different temperatures, which rules out the influence of temperature on the hydrogen production activity of the material. The influence of the piezoelectric field intensity on hydrogen production activity of water splitting was investigated by changing the frequency and power of the ultrasonic machine. Combined with Fig. 9d and e, it can be seen that when the ultrasonic power is higher than 70 W, the factor that determines the hydrogen production rate is the ultrasonic vibration frequency alone. This is not consistent with the literature, where the factor contributing to the increase of hydrogen production is stated as the increase of input energy.51 The coupling of light irradiation and ultrasonic vibration with different light intensities and the relationship between hydrogen production of the La2NiO4 catalyst with time and without any sacrificial agent is shown in Fig. 9f. The amount of hydrogen evolution increased with increase in light intensity. It can reach 1097 μmol h−1 g−1 at about 1000 mW cm−2, which is 61.32% higher than that of piezoelectric catalysis only. Due to the asymmetric crystal structure of the orthorhombic phase of La2NiO4, photogenerated carriers can be effectively migrated to different crystal planes with the ultrasonic function, and the efficiency of the electron–hole separation is greatly improved.52

Fig. 10a shows the hydrogen evolution of La2NiO4 for three cycles. It can be seen that the amount of hydrogen production is still stable after three cycles, indicating the good stability of La2NiO4. Meanwhile, the samples were dried in an oven at 90 °C after the cycle stability test. The XRD pattern (Fig. 10b) of the dried sample showed that no impurity peak had appeared, which further confirmed the good chemical stability of the La2NiO4. The group of three peaks in the O 1s, La 3d, and Ni 2p spectra of the La2NiO4 samples before and after the stability test are shown in Fig. 10c–e, respectively. The position of each peak before and after the reaction did not shift significantly, indicating the good chemical stability of the La2NiO4. In addition, as the reaction progresses, the adsorbed oxygen peak shifts slightly toward higher binding energy, and the metal cation peaks of the samples after the reaction shift slightly toward lower binding energy. This is helpful to the H+ adsorbed onto the active sites, which are beneficial for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

In addition, no oxygen was detected in the oxidized end products of water splitting. Subsequently, a prepared solution of 0.002 mol L−1 potassium permanganate acidified with sulfuric acid was dropped into the solution following the hydrogen evolution reaction and clarified by centrifugation, as can be seen in Fig. S2a.† After the first addition of 100 μL acidic potassium permanganate solution, the solution after the hydrogen evolution reaction remained colorless and transparent, as shown in Fig. S2b.† After 100 μL acidic potassium permanganate solution was added a second time, the solution after the hydrogen evolution reaction showed a slight pink color, as can be seen in Fig. S2c.† Then, after letting the solution stand for 10 minutes following the hydrogen evolution reaction this color faded and the solution became clear again (Fig. S2d†). Subsequently, after adding a further 100 μL of acid potassium permanganate solution, the solution became pink after the hydrogen evolution reaction, and did not fade, as shown in Fig. S2e,† confirming that the oxy product was hydrogen peroxide. This is due to a small amount of ˙OH being obtained by the cavitation effect of water (eqn (3)). Meanwhile, free holes on the VB react with H2O to form ˙OH (eqn (4)), and H2O2 is generated by radical reactions (eqn (5)).53 H2O → ˙OH + ˙H(3) H2O + h+ → ˙OH + H+(4) ˙OH + ˙OH → H2O2(5)
3.4. Simulation of the piezoelectric effect
The size and shape of nanoparticles have significant effects on the piezoelectric properties of the catalysts and should be considered in the design of piezoelectric nanomaterials.54,55 The La2NiO4 nanoplate model with a width of 40 nm, length of 80 nm, and thickness of 20 nm was established to simulate the effects of different coaxial pressures on the piezoelectric effect. The distribution of the piezoelectric potential was simulated using the FEM and COMSOL software. Fig. 11 shows the charge distribution caused by deformation of the La2NiO4 nanoplate model at 105 Pa acoustic pressure (the acoustic pressure generated by ultrasonic vibration can be as high as 105 Pa in liquid phase propagation).5,55 The two-dimensional material can easily deform on the exposed (010) surface because there is no direct restriction along the y-axis. As a result, the maximum potential difference is higher when the sound pressure is applied to the y-axis than to the x-axis. When the acoustic pressure is applied parallel to the (100) or (010) plane, the resulting positive and negative charges are, respectively, distributed at the ends of the material, which is consistent with the Pt particle distribution at the edges of La2NiO4.

3.5. Proposed mechanism
The surface of the material is the end of the ordered structure of the crystal, and the electronic state of the surface is obviously different from that of the bulk phase due to the completely different atomic ratio. This difference in electron state structure results in different carrier distributions on the surface and in the bulk phase.56 After charge is redistributed and the surface electric layer is formed, the material surface forms a stable structure with the outside phase (liquid, gas, solid), and an unbalanced space charge region is formed under the surface charge layer. This imbalance makes the energy band of the material in the space charge region bend to some extent, which makes the physical and chemical state of this region different from that of the bulk phase.57 The electric potential generated by such energy band bending can build an internal electric field in this region and realize the separation of charge carriers.58 Schematic mechanisms for the photo- and piezo-electric-induced charge migration over 2D La2NiO4 perovskite are shown in Fig. 12. When there are no other charged ions adsorbed onto the surface, the energy band of the material surface is flat. When the surface accumulates positive charge, the negative charge distribution in the space charge region is more, thus showing electronegativity and band bending. When the surface accumulates negative charges, the positive charge distributed in the space charge region is more. The energy band will bend in the opposite direction and even reversal of the carrier concentration will occur when the surface charge accumulation continues to increase.59 This was confirmed by TEM observation of the Pt particle distribution at the edges of La2NiO4, and COMSOL simulation of the piezoelectric potential distribution. The introduction of an ultrasonic field significantly promotes the separation of photogenerated carriers and reduces recombination. Thus, electrons produced in the CB of La2NiO4 have enough time to participate in the H2 evolution, and the holes produced in the VB can also generate H2O2 effectively. This study provides a new reference for the catalysis of water splitting under conditions of multifield coupling.

4. Conclusions
In the present work, La2NiO4 nanostructures were prepared by a modified citric acid method, and their catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution was investigated. With decrease in the synthesis temperature to 900 °C, the sample has a smaller grain size and more active sites. The hydrogen production activity was greatly improved when the piezoelectric and photocatalytic effects of La2NiO4 were combined. The hydrogen production activity increased with increase in the ultrasonic frequency and light intensity below the Curie temperature and the rated ultrasonic power range. The hydrogen production activity of the samples with water splitting can reach 1097 μmol h−1 g−1 without any sacrificial reagent or co-catalysis, when the light intensity reaches about 1000 mW cm−2. This work provides further understanding of coupling of multiple fields and a promising approach for the preparation of efficient catalysts.
