    , Accepted 10th October 2016First published on 11th October 2016AbstractTwo acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type oligomers 1 and 2 comprising dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole as a central unit and dicyanovinylene (DCV) or 1,3-indanedione as terminal acceptor groups have been synthesized for use as a donor in a solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell in combination with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor. By employing PEDOT:PSS as a HTL and two-step annealing treatment i.e. thermal annealing followed by solvent vapor annealing (TSA) of the active layer the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were significantly improved from 3.72% to 6.95% for 1 and 4.18% to 7.54% for 2. The improvement of the PCE was mainly due to the increase in JSC and FF values which can be attributed to the re-organization of the donor material within the blend leading to balanced charge transport and improved crystallinity of the donor in the active layer. The influence of TSA on the degree of crystallinity and blend morphology was investigated by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When PEDOT:PSS was replaced by CuSCN as the HTL, a further enhancement of the photovoltaic parameters is realized leading to an increase in the PCE to 7.63% for 1 and 8.22% for 2. These results not only provide important insight into the influence of the two-step annealing process on molecular packing and charge transport properties, but also reveal the significance of CuSCN as the HTL on the device performance of tailored molecular materials.
1. Introduction
During the last few years, research on solution-processable acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) oligomers often referred to as “small molecules” has contributed largely to the field of organic solar cells (OSCs).1–9 The successful design strategies for the development of A–D–A oligomers offer fine tuning of the absorption properties, electronic energy levels and packing in the solid state. Employing these functional oligomers as donors and fullerene derivatives as acceptors a remarkable increase in device performance has been realized within the last few years and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been reported for single junction solar cells.10–15 This success is mainly due to the judicious design and synthesis of new photoactive materials in combination with optimization of the morphology of the photoactive layers by the development of new processing methods.
The molecular design of A–D–A oligomers includes combination of various central donor blocks, such as oligothiophenes, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole, benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole, and terminal acceptor units, for example, dicyanovinylene, alkyl cyanoacetate, 3-ethylrhodanine, 1,3-indanedione, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine, and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole linked by alkylated oligothiophenes.11,13,16–28 Combining stronger donors with stronger acceptors in the conjugated chain results in a red-shift of the charge transfer absorption band and an increase of the molar extinction coefficient.29 Recently, Bäuerle and co-workers have demonstrated the successful use of the dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole moiety to develop new conjugated A–D–A oligomers, which in combination with PC61BM and PC71BM as acceptors exhibited PCEs of up to 6.1% and 7.1%, respectively, after solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment.23,26 SVA is now a well-established method to fine tune the morphology of the photoactive layer. In this method, solvent vapor penetrates into the blend allowing for re-organization of the donor and/or acceptor materials affecting their crystallinity and therefore the phase separation in BHJ devices.23,30,31 Recently, by employing a two-step annealing process i.e. thermal annealing followed by solvent vapor annealing (TSA) significant improvement in the PCEs of up to 9% have been realised for oligomer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells.12,15,27,28,32,33
In addition to the photoactive materials other key components of solar cell devices are the hole and electron transport layers that are sandwiched between the active layer and the terminal electrodes. The most frequently used hole transport layer (HTL) is the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) due to its mild processing conditions, preparation of smooth films, deep work function (−5.1 eV), and good optical transparency. However, the hygroscopic and acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS are the major cause for the long term device stability due to the degradation of the active layer and the ITO anode. Thus, a pH neutral HTL is preferable in order to avoid the interfacial chemical reactions. It has also been reported that PEDOT:PSS is not a good electron blocking layer and can trap electrons thus reducing the device performance.34,35 Examples of some other solution-processable hole transport layer as a replacement for PEDOT:PSS include p-trichlorosilylpropyl-substituted triarylamine-based small molecules,34,36 graphene-based materials,37–39 and carbon nanotubes.40 Various metal oxides such as vanadium pentoxide (V2O5),25,41 molybdenum oxide (MoO3),42,43 tungsten oxide (WO3),44 and nickel oxide (NiO)45,46 have also been used as a replacement for PEDOT:PSS demonstrating promising results in solar cells. Very recently, copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) has been implemented as an efficient solution-processable HTL due to its high optical transparency over the visible to the near infrared region, high hole mobility (0.01–0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1), large bandgap (>3.5 eV) and a deep valence band edge (∼−5.35 eV).47,48 Furthermore, the high solubility of CuSCN in diethyl sulphide and diisopropyl sulphide and solvent orthogonality with a variety of organic materials enable its use as a successful HTL in solar cell applications. CuSCN was successfully used as a HTL in perovskite solar cells generating PCEs of up to 16%.49,50 OSCs employing CuSCN as a HTL delivered PCEs of up to 8.0% for polymer solar cells and 7.2% for small molecule OSCs.51–54
In this work, we report the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic performance of two A–D–A oligomers 1 and 2 which consist of a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) core and dicyanovinylene or 1,3-indanedione groups as terminal acceptors linked by hexylbithiophene units (Fig. 1). Previously, oligomer 1 was synthesized using a convergent route, which required preparative high performance liquid chromatography for its purification in order to remove the trace amount of homocoupling products and monoaldehydes as impurity.23 In OSCs, 1:P61BM based devices exhibited PCEs of 6.1% upon SVA treatment with chloroform. Based on our previous results for oligomer 1 we have now developed a divergent approach for the preparation of oligomers 1 and 2. These molecules allow for fine-tuning of the absorption properties and frontier orbital energies by variation of the terminal acceptor units, thus contributing to the effective charge transport and the photocurrent enhancement in the device. The improvement of the photovoltaic performance was further investigated by absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Photovoltaic devices were prepared using oligomers 1 and 2 as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor. In these devices either PEDOT:PSS or CuSCN was employed as the HTL. The best devices based on oligomers 1 and 2 generated PCEs of 7.63% and 8.22%, respectively, using solution-processed CuSCN as the HTL in combination with the dual annealing (TSA) process where THF was used as the annealing solvent. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is mainly ascribed to the reduced absorption of CuSCN and its better electron blocking properties.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route to compounds 1 and 2 is shown in Scheme 1. Dialdehyde 5 was synthesized in 70% yield by a Pd-catalyzed Stille-type cross-coupling reaction of 5′-bromo-3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5-carbaldehyde553 and bis-stannylated dithienopyrrole 4. Compound 1 was synthesized by a Knoevenagel condensation reaction of dialdehyde 5 with malononitrile in the presence of NH4OAC in high yield of 94%. This synthetic route to prepare oligomer 1 has a great advantage compared to the previously reported procedure,23 such as a higher yield and the avoidance of the formation of homocoupling products as trace impurities. Compound 2 was obtained in 81% yield by the reaction of dialdehyde 5 and 1,3-indanedione in the presence of piperidine as the base according to the procedure reported by Chen and co-workers.56 The structure of the target molecules was confirmed by NMR and HR-MS and the purity, which is important for device fabrication, was checked by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
Electronic absorption spectra of oligomers 1 and 2 were measured in dichloromethane solution and on thin films to determine the effect of acceptor groups on their electronic properties (Fig. 2) and the data are presented in Table 1. In comparison to the absorption maximum at 563 nm for DCV-derivative 1, a 22 nm red-shift was observed for oligomer 2 (λabs = 585 nm) comprising 1,3-indanedione as an acceptor. In addition, the molar extinction coefficient (ε) for 2 was found to be 66100 M−1 cm−1 which is higher compared to DCV 1 (55500 M−1 cm−1). The absorption band at 400 nm in oligomer 1 is assigned to the absorption of the oligothiophene backbone, which is red-shifted to 417 nm for 2.

Compared to the solution spectra, the absorption bands of oligomers 2 on thin films, prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solutions, were significantly red-shifted to about 654 nm (Fig. 2), indicating better delocalization and planarization of the conjugated backbone by inter-chain packing in the solid state. Moreover a wider shoulder observed around 694 nm may indicate the stronger intermolecular π–π stacking interactions. The optical energy gap (Eoptg) of oligomers 1 and 2 in thin films calculated from the onset of the absorption band is 1.59 eV and 1.54 eV, respectively, which is significantly low compared to that in solution. The lowering of the band bap for oligomers 2 compared to the DCV-derivative 1 further indicates the strong electron-accepting character of the indanedione-based acceptor.
Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the positions of the frontier orbitals of oligomers 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Both oligomers showed two reversible 1e− oxidation waves, which can be assigned to the stepwise oxidation of the oligomeric backbone and the formation of stable radical cations and dications, respectively. In the negative potential regime, oligomers 1 and 2 showed one irreversible reduction wave at around −1.54 V for 1 to −1.38 V for 2, which corresponds to the simultaneous reduction of the acceptor groups (Table 1). In comparison to the DCV-derivative 1, a negative shift of the oxidation wave and a positive shift of the reduction wave were observed for oligomer 2. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the oligomers were estimated from the onset of the first oxidation and reduction waves and were −5.31 eV/−3.75 eV for 1 and −5.25 eV/−3.78 eV for 2. A slight destabilization of HOMO and stabilization of the LUMO energy levels were observed for 2 in comparison to the DCV 1. The electrochemical band gap ECVg for 1 and 2 was 1.56 eV and 1.47 eV. The LUMO energy levels of both oligomers are sufficiently higher than the LUMO energy levels of PC71BM (−4.1 eV) for exciton dissociation, indicating their suitability as the donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor for BHJ organic solar cells.

2.3. Bulk-heterojunction solar cell performance of the as-cast films employing PEDOT:PSS as the hole transport layer
Solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated using 1 and 2 as the donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor with a conventional device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS or CuSCN/1 or 2:PC71BM with different weight ratios/Al. In a BHJ organic solar cell, the weight ratio between the donor and acceptor materials used in the active layer plays an important role in the observed photovoltaic response, since there should be a balance between the absorption ability and charge transporting network in the active layer. Therefore, first of all, we have optimized the donor to acceptor weight ratio and found that the 1:2 weight ratio results in the best PCE. Therefore, we are only discussing the photovoltaic properties of the active layers with a donor to acceptor weight ratio of 1:2. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices based on the active layers i.e.1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM processed with THF under illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The device based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM exhibits an overall PCE of 3.72% (JSC = 9.52 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.91 and FF = 0.43) and 4.18% (JSC = 10.34 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.88 V and FF = 0.46), respectively. Both the devices showed a reasonably high VOC, due to the deeper HOMO energy levels of 1 and 2. The relatively higher VOC of the 1:PC71BM based device than 2:PC71BM may be attributed to the deeper HOMO energy level of 1 compared to 2, since the VOC of BHJ organic solar cells is directly related to the difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor.57 The higher PCE of 2 based devices compared to that of 1 is mainly due to the higher JSC and FF values. The statistical data or the PCEs on a batch of five identical devices for oligomers 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 2. The small standard deviation in all cases points toward good device reproducibility. The higher JSC has been further confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE spectra of both the devices exhibit a broad response and match well with the absorption spectra of the respective active layers. The devices based on 2:PC71BM showed EQE values in the range of 25–41% in the wavelength range of 350–750 nm which are higher than those for 1:PC71BM under the same conditions. The JSC values estimated from the integration of EQE spectra (9.45 mA cm2 for 1 and 10.26 mA cm2 for 2) were consistent with the values measured from the J–V characteristics under illumination. Moreover, the LUMO offset between 2 and PC71BM is slightly larger than that for 1 and PC71BM which indicates that the driving force for the 2 based device is stronger than that for 1, which may be partly attributed to the higher JSC.

The charge transport within the active layer after the dissociation of exciton at D/A interfaces is an important factor for obtaining a higher PCE in BHJ organic solar cells. In this study the molecular structure of both the oligomers is the same except the end capping acceptor groups. In order to obtain information about the influence of the end capping group on the charge transport, we have measured J–V characteristics in the dark for the hole only devices i.e. ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au (Fig. 5) and fitted the curves by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. Although the thickness of the active layer influences the charge carrier mobility, we looked this carefully to ensure a similar active layer film thickness of 85 ± 5 nm and avoid the substantial influences of this parameter on the charge carrier mobility. We have estimated the hole mobility (μh) to be 1.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.82 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM, respectively. The hole mobility of the BHJ active layer is lower than that of pristine 1 (μh = 4.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and 2 (μh = 6.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), and may be related to the mixing of PC71BM and the donor, which slightly hinders the path of the holes. Similarly, we have also measured the electron mobility (μe) in the active layers using electron only devices which is about 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both the devices. The hole mobility is determined by the intramolecular interaction between the donor and acceptor units present in the backbone, intermolecular packing and π–π stacking. Since both the oligomers have the same molecular backbone except the end capping acceptor groups, the difference between their hole mobility might have been caused by the intramolecular interactions. The hole mobility for the 2:PC71BM active layer may be due to the strong intramolecular interaction between the donor and acceptor, since indanedione is a slightly stronger acceptor than DCV. In comparison to 1, oligomer 2 showed a stronger intramolecular interaction, as evidenced by the red-shift of the absorption band in both solution and solid state which contribute to its charge transport ability.27,58,59 The higher hole mobility for 2:PC71BM and more balanced charge transport (μe/μh = 9.0) as compared to 1:PC71BM (μe/μh = 12.83) are responsible for the higher JSC and FF for the device based on the former active layer. The current finding demonstrates that the charge carriers in the blends with higher mobilities can reach the electrodes before they recombine and therefore contribute to the overall enhancement in the photocurrent and FF.

2.4. Influence of the annealing process on device performance and active layer morphology
Although the VOC of the as-cast devices is quite high, the lower PCE is mainly due to the low values of JSC and FF. Since the JSC of BHJ solar cells is directly related to the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer, exciton dissociation and charge transport, we assume that all the excitons generated after the absorption of photons by the active layer are not dissociated into free charge carriers due to their poor morphology, which is common in the active layer based on small molecules.15,23,24,27,60 Moreover the ratio of the electron to hole mobility is quite high, leading to unbalanced charge transport due to the poor interpenetrating pathways for electrons and holes, resulting in a lower FF. In order to improve the morphology of the active layer, we have adopted TSA i.e. two-step annealing (thermal and subsequent solvent vapor annealing) as reported in the literature.15,27,61 The J–V characteristics of the devices based on active layers processed with TSA treatment are shown in Fig. 4a and the photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table 2. The PCE has been improved up to 6.95% (JSC = 12.88 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.87 V and FF = 0.62) and 7.54% (JSC = 13.88 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.84 V and FF = 0.65) for 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM based devices, respectively, which is mainly due to the enhancement in the JSC and FF values. The enhancement in the JSC is consistent with the EQE spectra of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, the EQE values for the TSA treated active layers were increased and slightly broadened compared to that for the as-cast counterparts. The JSC values obtained from the integration of the EQE spectra (12.80 mA cm−2 for 1 and 13.72 mA cm−2 for 2 based devices) were very close to the JSC values measured from the J–V curves, indicating that the J–V measurements were highly reliable.
The enhancement in the PCE may also be related to charge transport properties within the active layer, since the extraction of photogenerated charge carriers by the electrodes depends upon the competition between the carrier sweep out and recombination losses. We have estimated the hole mobilities in the active layers processed with TSA treatment using J–V characteristics of the hole only devices and the SCLC model (Fig. 5). The hole mobility was found to be 1.08 × 10−4 and 1.44 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM layers, respectively. The electron mobility measured using electron only devices was found to be about 2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both active layers. For efficient BHJ solar cells, the electron to hole mobility ratio close to unity is considered as optimal to achieve balanced electron and hole transport. When the active layer was processed with TSA treatment, the enhanced hole mobility matches well with the electron mobility (μe/μh = 2.24 and 1.68 for 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM, respectively), which signifies more balanced charge transport in the devices resulting in an overall increase in the JSC and FF.
In BHJ organic solar cells, the JSC value is directly related to the light harvesting ability of the active layer. In order to obtain information about the changes occurred in the absorption profile of the active layer, we have recorded the absorption spectra of the thin films only for 2:PC71BM (as cast as well TSA treated) (Fig. 6). The as-cast and TSA-processed 2:PC71BM blend film displayed two absorption bands, i.e. 350–450 nm resulting from both PC71BM and 2 and from 600–800 nm corresponding to the charge transfer band of 2. The absorption band of the blend film is slightly blue-shifted relative to its pristine film, indicating that the addition of PC71BM disturbs the intermolecular interaction of the donor molecules. However, after TSA treatment the absorption band of the active layer is red-shifted relative to that of the as-cast blend film, which is related to the enhanced intermolecular interaction giving rise to a stronger exciton coupling. Moreover, the absorption intensity of the active layer particularly for the donor also increased, indicating that the increased light harvesting ability of the active layer may also partly be attributed to the enhancement in the JSC of the TSA treated devices.
 Fig. 6  Normalized absorption spectra of the as-cast and TSA treated 2:PC71BM blended films. 
In order to obtain more information about the exciton dissociation and photocurrent generation in the devices using 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers processed under different conditions, the photocurrent density (Jph) is plotted as a function of effective voltage (Veff) for all the devices, as reported in the literature58,62 and is shown in Fig. 7. In the case of TSA-processed BHJ devices, Jph increases linearly with Veff at low voltages and gradually saturates at high voltages, where Jph is field-independent. However, the devices based on as-cast active layers do not show a fully saturated region for Jph even at high voltage of measurement. The continuous increase in Jph in these devices may be attributed to a decrease in the extraction of free charge carriers due to the fact that this internal field is not sufficient for extraction of free charge carriers. Moreover, the devices based on THF cast active layers showed a square root dependence on the effective voltages in the intermediate region that indicates a higher electric field dependence of charge carrier transport, which is consistence of low FF. We have estimated the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and charge collection efficiency (Pc) for the devices based on the as-cast and TSA treated active layer using the equation Jphsat = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (90 nm for all devices). The values Gmax for 1:PC71BM (as cast), 1:PC71BM (TSA treated), 2:PC71BM (as cast) and 2:PC71BM (TSA treated) are 5.13 × 1024 cm−3 s−1, 8.82 × 1024 cm−3 s−1, 5.65 × 1024 cm−3 s−1and 9.97 × 1024 cm−3 s−1, respectively. The Jphsat is related to the maximum exciton generation rate, which is a measure of the maximum number of photons absorbed.63 The increased values of Gmax for TSA treated active layer based devices suggest better absorption after TSA treatment, which is in agreement with the increased value of JSC. Under short circuit conditions, the Pc was estimated as Pc = JSC/Jphsat and is 0.72, 0.83, 0.75 and 0.87 for the devices based on 1:PC71BM (as cast), 1:PC71BM (TSA), 2:PC71BM (as cast) and 2:PC71BM (TSA), respectively, which indicates that the exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies are higher for the devices based on TSA treated active layers as compared to the corresponding as-cast devices.

The difference in the phase separation between the donor and acceptor component has also an important impact on the PCE of BHJ organic solar cells. In order to obtain further information about the change in morphology of the active layers, we have measured the surface morphology of as-cast and TSA treated active layers by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the TEM images are shown in Fig. 8 only for the 2:PC71BM blend. The film cast from the THF showed relatively flat and poor phase separation (∼5–10 nm) between donor 2 and PC71BM, which hinders the exciton dissociation and charge transport. However, for the TSA treated active layer, the phase separation is improved with a domain size of 15–20 nm, may be originated from enhanced intermolecular interactions of the oligomer during the film formation.24,26,60,64 Moreover, a better bicontinuous interpenetrating network of the donor and acceptor allows efficient charge separation and charge transport within the active layer.

The crystallinity of the active layer plays an important role in charge transport and collection, thereby affecting the overall PCE of an organic BHJ solar cell. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine 1 and 2 are displayed in Fig. 9a, which showed (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.12 for both oligomers resulting in a d-spacing of 1.86 nm, but the intensity of the diffraction peak of 2 is more stronger than that of 1, indicating a higher crystallinity for 2 compared to 1. The XRD patterns of as-cast and TSA treated 2:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 9b. Similar results have also been observed for 1:PC71BM films. The films of as cast 2:PC71BM display similar diffraction peaks with lower intensity, suggesting effective mixing of PC71BM and 2. However, this diffraction peak becomes more intense for the corresponding TSA treated film and the width at half maximum height is decreased. These results showed that the as-cast blended film has a low crystallinity, whereas in the case of the TSA treated blend film, the crystallinity is increased due to the enhanced π-conjugation of the oligomer in the blend film. The increase in crystallinity leads to an enhancement in the light harvesting properties of the active layer and a higher hole mobility in the blended thin film, leading to increases in JSC, FF and PCE.

2.5. Solar cell performance improvement using CuSCN as the hole transport layer
In order to further improve the PCE, we have used CuSCN as an HTL. Since both 1 and 2 exhibit a HOMO energy level of −5.31 and −5.25 eV, respectively, there could be an energy mismatch with the HOMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS, which probably form an energy barrier for hole extraction. Therefore, there is a possibility to further improve the PCE. We have used TSA treated active layers for the devices using CuSCN as the hole transport layer instead of PEDOT:PSS. The insertion of the CuSCN layer can enhance the electron blocking properties of the anode buffer layer. The J–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 10. The best performing devices based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM exhibited excellent PCEs of 7.63% (JSC = 13.95 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.90 V and FF = 0.65) and 8.22% (JSC = 14.06 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 V and FF = 0.68), respectively, which are higher than that of a PEDOT:PSS HTL. The devices showed excellent average PCEs of 7.51 ± 0.12% for 1 and 8.08 ± 0.14 for 2. These small deviations emphasize the reproducibility and reliability of our results. The JSC values are slightly higher than that of a PEDOT:PSS HTL, because both PEDOT:PSS and CuSCN have similar transparency in the visible and NIR regions of the solar spectrum. When PEDOT:PSS is replaced by CuSCN, there is an improvement in the FF in both the devices which may be related to the formation of better ohmic contact between the active layer and CuSCN, because of the deeper work function of CuSCN compared to PEDOT:PSS. The increase in VOC with respect to PEDOT:PSS could be explained by a better alignment between the HOMO energy level of the oligomer donor and the valence band edge of CuSCN (−5.35 eV) at the active layer/HTL interface, which acts as a good electron-blocking layer.53 Furthermore, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices were estimated from the inverse of the slopes of the J–V characteristics at VOC and JSC, respectively and the values are provided in Table 2. While Rs represents the intrinsic resistance of the active layer, Rsh reflects the degree of leakage current through the device. The decrease in Rs and increase in Rsh for the devices with CuSCN as the HTL confirm the formation of better ohmic contact and efficient hole extraction.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we have synthesised two novel A–D–A oligomers 1 and 2 consisting of a dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) core and dicyanovinylene or 1,3-indanedione groups as terminal acceptors linked by hexylbithiophene units and investigated their optical and electrochemical properties. The optoelectronic properties and energy levels of these materials suggest that the blended films of these compounds with PC71BM can effectively harvest photons from the visible to the NIR region of the solar spectrum and transfer electrons from the oligomer donor to the PC71BM acceptor. BHJ solar cells based on 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM processed from THF displayed PCEs of 3.72% and 4.18%, respectively. In order to further improve the PCE, we have adopted the TSA treatment of active layers and the PCE has been significantly enhanced up to 6.95% for 1 and 7.54% for 2, which is attributed to the enhancement in the light harvesting ability of the active layers and more balanced charge transport in the devices. Moreover, the PCE of the TSA treated active layers was further increased to 7.63% and 8.22% by employing transparent CuSCN as the HTL. The results demonstrate that the hole transporting CuSCN is an excellent replacement for the commonly used PEDOT:PSS to achieve high efficiencies in organic solar cells of tailored oligomers. Further improvement in the device performance can be anticipated by modification of the device architecture and processing conditions.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Materials and methods
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Chemical shift values (δ) are expressed in ppm using residual solvent protons (1H NMR, δH = 3.58, 1.73 for THF-d8; 13C NMR, δC = 67.57, 25.37 for THF-d8) as the internal standard. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), t (triplet) and m (multiplet). Melting points were determined using a Mettler Toledo DSC 823. EI mass spectra were recorded on a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS, MALDI-MS experiments were performed using a MS Bruker Reflex 2 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) using trans-2-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Hitachi instrument equipped with a UV-Vis detector L-7420, columns (Nucleosil 100-5 NO2 with a pore size of 100 Å) from Machery-Nagel using a dichloromethane/n-hexane mixture (40:60) as the eluent. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in 1 cm cuvettes with Merck Uvasol grade solvents on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled Autolab PGSTAT30 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell with a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All potentials were internally referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple. Tetrahydrofuran and N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck) were dried using a MB SPS-800 solvent purifying system (MBraun). All synthetic steps were carried out under an argon atmosphere.
4.2. Device fabrication and characterization
Organic solar cells were prepared with a conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass was cleaned subsequently in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. After drying the substrates, a thin layer (40 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin coated on the ITO coated glass substrate and baked at 110 °C for 10 min. The photoactive layers of the blends of different weight ratios of 1 or 2 and PC71BM were prepared from THF solvent and then spin cast on the top of the PEDOT:PSS film and then dried under ambient conditions for 5 h to remove the solvent residue. The concentration of solution was kept at 16 mg mL−1 for all the blends. For the two step annealing (TSA), first the active layer was thermally annealed at 120 °C for 10 min and then cooled down to room temperature. Next the active layer was placed in a glass Petri disc filled with 200 μL THF solution for 10 s. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by the spinning speed during the spin coating and was about 90 ± 5 nm. Finally, the aluminium (Al) top electrode was thermally deposited on the active layer at a vacuum of 10−5 Torr through a shadow mask of area 20 mm2. All devices were fabricated and tested in ambient atmosphere without encapsulation.
The hole-only and electron-only devices with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al were also fabricated in a similar way in order to measure the hole and electron mobility, respectively. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source meter in the dark and under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured by illuminating the devices through the light source and a monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short-circuit conditions. All the devices were tested using a metal mask (3 × 4 mm aperture) to minimize the parasitic current contributions. For devices based on a CuSCN HTL, a thin film of the CuSCN (30 nm) layer was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 60 seconds using diisopropyl sulphide as the solvent and annealed at 110 °C for 20 minutes, and then the active layer was deposited as described above.
