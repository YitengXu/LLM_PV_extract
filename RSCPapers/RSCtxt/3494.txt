    , Accepted 6th May 2022First published on 7th May 2022AbstractMetal oxide semiconductors are promising candidate photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical H2O2 production if the issues of poor efficiency and selectivity can be resolved. An unfavorable charge transport barrier causes poor carrier collection and kinetics, limiting their efficiency and selectivity. Herein, BiFeO3 was used as the model photocathode, and its interfacial charge transport barrier between fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates was modulated by introducing a LaNiO3 layer as the charge collection layer. Our findings show the significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical activity of the composite photocathode with an improved photocurrent by three times (−0.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE) and the H2O2 formation up to 278 μmol L−1 with doubled faradaic efficiency. It is shown that these enhancements are due to the promoted charge carrier collection and kinetics. This work demonstrates the significant role of the charge collection layer in improving the collection and usage of photocarriers to accelerate the application of solar-to-fuel conversion.

New concepts
An unfavorable charge transport barrier and related poor carrier dynamics are key factors that limited the performance of optoelectronic devices. To overcome this, a semiconductor thin film light absorber was sandwiched by an electron collection layer and a hole collection layer in a photovoltaic system to achieve efficient charge separation and collection. However, such a sandwich device architecture is rarely adopted in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices, especially for some emerging PEC materials. Moreover, nearly 90% of photocarriers were lost inside some ternary semiconductors due to poor kinetics caused by recombination. To this end, we developed a hole collection layer for p-type BiFeO3 to boost its application in solar-fuel conversion via carrier dynamics engineering. With the reduced charge transport barrier and enhanced kinetics, the optimized photoelectrode shows a state-of-the-art photocurrent and H2O2 production rate. These results open up a new strategy to improve the dynamics of photocarriers and provide appropriate guidance for the future photoelectrode design to target enhanced solar-fuel formation.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis is a promising approach for producing green hydrogen peroxide and is widely used in chemical synthesis, medicine, and wastewater treatment.1–3 This PEC approach takes advantage of the photocarrier generation ability of photoelectrodes and the water oxidation and dioxygen reduction capacities of photogenerated carriers.4,5 The two-electron reduction of O2 to produce H2O2 (ORR) is being intensively investigated using various photoelectrodes.6,7 However, the poor charge carrier collection and kinetics of photoelectrodes results in low selectivity and efficiency.8–10
The unfavorable energy barrier inside the photoelectrode is a critical factor that leads to the poor carrier collection and kinetics by blocking charge carrier transport across the interface and causes recombination.11,12 This barrier commonly appears at the interface of light-harvesting semiconductors and charge collecting substrates. For instance, p-type semiconductors, such as CuBi2O4 and BiFeO3 (denoted as BFO), have a work function of around 4.7–5.9 eV.12,13 However, the commonly used transparent conducting substrates are indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), and the work function is around 4.4–4.5 eV.14 Thus, a significant Fermi level mismatch and the resulting barrier will form at the interface.14–16 Such an unfavorable Schottky barrier may impede hole collection at the semiconductor and substrate interface and causes a severe carrier loss in photoelectrodes.15,16 Indeed, BFO has a suitable bandgap (2.2–2.8 eV) for visible light-harvesting, conduction, and valence band positions with thermodynamics favorable for the water redox reaction. However, the PEC performance of BFO is only several percent of the theoretical value of 4.78 mA cm−2 (using AM 1.5G solar illumination, with calculations based on the absorption coefficient and the layer thickness, Fig. S1, ESI†).17–20 Poor charge collection efficiency and charge kinetics are believed to be the main reasons for such a limited performance.21 So far, some ABO3-type substrates (such as SrTiO3, LaNiO3 (LNO), etc.) have been reported as the buffer layer to prepare BFO thin films with high quality.22–24 However, from the standpoint of the PEC synthesis of H2O2, a functional charge collection layer and its influence on charge collection and kinetics are critical.
To this end, BFO thin films as the model photocathode were used in PEC H2O2 production, and the collection efficiency and kinetics of the photocarrier were significantly promoted by introducing a thin LNO layer. As expected, the LNO layer rarely influences the morphology, crystal structure, and chemical environment of the top BFO layer but significantly improves its PEC performance, confirmed by current–voltage responses and H2O2 production tests. Solid-state electronic measurements and numerical simulations with device models proved the existence of the Schottky barrier at the interface of FTO and BFO. In addition, the barrier height can be significantly reduced by introducing the LNO thin layer. Transient absorption (TA) analysis confirmed the improved carrier kinetics as the extended carrier lifetime. This work reported a strategy to improve the efficiency and selectivity of PEC H2O2 production of photoelectrodes by introducing a functional charge collection layer by carrier dynamics engineering.
Experiment
Preparation of the LNO layer
The LNO layer was deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Sigma-Aldrich, 50 × 50 × 2 mm, ∼7 ohm per square) substrates by a spin-coating method. Before deposition, FTO substrates were thoroughly washed with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol, dried with an air gun, and treated for 5 min in an O2 plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, PDC-32G-2). Typically, 0.3 M nickel acetate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) and 0.3 M lanthanum nitrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) were dissolved in a mixed solution of acetate (AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) and water with a volume ratio of 21:4. The resulting solution was heated and stirred in a water bath at 80 °C for 1 h and stirred at room temperature for 3 h to obtain the precursor solution. Then, the precursor was filtered through a 0.25 μm PTFE filter (Jin Teng) and spun at 5000 rpm for 20 s. Next, the samples were pre-annealed for 5 min at 350 °C and then annealed at 700 °C for 3 min. This procedure was repeated three times to obtain the expected thickness.
Preparation of BFO thin films
BFO thin films were deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Sigma-Aldrich, 50 × 50 × 2 mm, ∼7 ohm per square) by a spin-coating method. Typically, bismuth nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, AR, Macklin) with a mole ratio of 1.05:1 were mixed and dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China) by ultrasonication and followed by stirring to form the precursor solution. The FTO substrates were thoroughly washed with detergent, deionized water, and ethanol, dried with an air gun, and treated for 5 min in an O2 plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, PDC-32G-2). The precursor was filtered through a 0.25 μm PTFE filter (Jin Teng) and spun at 4000 rpm for 10 s. After spin-coating, samples were pre-annealed for 3 min at 350 °C and then annealed at 600 °C for 3 min. This procedure was repeated five times to obtain the expected thickness. After the final sin-coating cycle, the samples were annealed for 8 min at 600 °C to achieve the last BFO samples.
Sample characterization
The crystalline structure of the samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips, X’pert pro, Cu Kα 0.154 nm). Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman microscope (HR800, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm laser source. The characteristic Si phonon peak calibrated the spectral position at 520.7 cm−1. Sample morphologies and roughness were characterized using an atomic force microscope (MFP-3D, Asylum Research). X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS) data were acquired using a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS instrument, with an Al Kα source (hν = 1486.68 eV) and He I (hν = 21.22 eV) illumination. The XPS binding energy was calibrated using adventitious alkyl carbon signals by shifting the C 1s peak to 284.8 eV. Transmission and reflection spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere (UV-3600 plus, Shimadzu) from 300–1100 nm. The surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) measurement was carried out using a home-built apparatus, equipped with a lock-in amplifier (SR830) synchronized with a light chopper (SR540), a 150 W xenon lamp (LSP-X150), and a monochromator (Omni-λ 320i). The Fermi level, conduction, and valence band edge of the prepared samples were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The work function can be extracted from the low kinetic energy cut-off in the secondary emission feature. Here, the photon energy of the UV source (He I discharge) is 21.21 eV.
Femtosecond transient spectroscopy
Transient spectroscopy was performed using a Coherent Legend Elite regenerative amplifier (<110 fs, 1 kHz, 800 nm) that was seeded using a Coherent Chameleon oscillator (75 fs, 80 MHz). The supercontinuum white probe light in the 330–600 nm range was generated on a CaF2 crystal excited by parts of the 800 nm laser beam from the amplifier. A portion of the laser beam was coupled to a Coherent OPerA-Solo optical parametric amplifier (285–2600 nm), which generated the 320 nm laser pump pulse with a beam size of around 0.3 mm. The pump was directly depolarized to remove the artifacts of orientational relaxation. The setup can detect the differential transmission or reflection signal separately. The data were fitted using the Surface Xplore software (Ultrafast Systems, LLC).
PEC measurements
PEC measurements were performed using an RST5210F (Zhenzhou Shiruisi Instrument Technology Co., LTD) potentiostat using a three-electrode system with a Pt counter electrode and a 3 M Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M potassium bicarbonate with 0.1 M sodium persulfate as the electron scavenger at pH 8.2. A homemade light source (light-emitting diode, LED, 300 nm) with a light density of 60 mW cm−2 was used to illuminate the samples. All potentials reported herein were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the following equation:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.21 V + 0.059 × pH
H2O2 production test
The H2O2 production test was performed using a standard three-electrode system with a homemade two-compartment cell separated by a Nafion membrane (Nafion Membrane N117). The prepared samples were used as the photocathode, a piece of Pt coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode, and 3 M Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution and purged with O2 (99.9%) gas for 30 min before and during the measurement. The electrolyte was kept at 5 °C using a chiller to prevent the decomposition of H2O2. Under AM 1.5G illumination and applying a constant potential (0.3 V vs. RHE) to the working electrode, the amount of produced H2O2 was quantified in the photocathode compartment using the iodometry method. Typically, 1 mL of potassium hydrogen phthalate (C8H5KO4, 0.1 M) and potassium iodide (KI, 0.4 M) aqueous solution were added to 2 mL of the reaction solution and stirred for 2 min. The produced H2O2 in the reaction solution may oxidize I− to I3−, which can be evaluated by measuring the absorption intensity at 351 nm using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy.
Results and discussion
BFO and LNO/BFO films were prepared by a spin-coating method, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The crystal structure, phase purity, and surface composition of films were checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The sharp and high-intensity diffraction peaks of bare LNO and BFO are well matched to LaNiO3 (JCPDS 33-0711), BiFeO3 (JCPDS 86-1518), and FTO with an excellent phase purity (Fig. 1(b)).25 The identical Raman spectra of the bare BFO and LNO/BFO films indicate that the added LNO layer rarely influences the crystal structure of the BFO layer. All these peaks matched well to the E (TO), A1-1 (LO), A1-2 (LO), and A1-3 (LO) reported Raman models of BFO, confirming the ideal phase purity of the prepared BFO films.26 XPS core-level spectra of Bi 4f (Fig. 1(d)) and Fe 2p (Fig. 1(e)) show splitting energies of 5.3 and 13.6 eV, confirming the Bi3+ and Fe3+ valence states in the BFO films.27 Other spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The exact location of BFO and LNO/BFO indicates that the underlying LNO layer has no observable effect on the chemical environment of the further deposited BFO layer.

The microstructure and elemental composition of the films were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Fig. 1(f) shows the top view SEM image of the LNO layer on the FTO substrate. Compared with the angular crystal facets on the order of 10–500 nm of the FTO surface (Fig. S3, ESI†), the LNO layer is composed of tiny particles covering the FTO facets with a smooth surface. The BFO films on FTO and LNO appear similar, indicating that the underlying LNO layer rarely changes the morphology of the deposited BFO film. The cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 1(g)) and the EDX map (Fig. S4, ESI†) clearly show the excepted bi-layer structure. The LNO and BFO layer thicknesses are around 110 nm and 145 nm, respectively. Thus, we declare the successful fabrication of BFO and LNO/BFO films.
In assessing the film as photocathodes, significantly improved PEC performance was achieved by adding the LNO layer. Fig. 2(a) shows the current–voltage (J–V) responses of the BFO and LNO/BFO films measured under blue LED (390 nm) illumination at 60 mW cm−2. An electron scavenger (0.1 M Na2S2O8) was added to the electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3) to avoid the influence of surface activity on intrinsic properties. The introduced LNO layer resulted in a 3 times increment in the photocurrent from −0.3 to −0.9 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE and a 110 mV positive shift in the onset potential from 1.27 to 1.38 eV (taken at −10 μA cm−2 of the photocurrent). Additionally, the fill factor, defined as the ratio of the J–V integrated area to the product of the maximum photocurrent and voltage, shows a 38.8% enhancement. The negligible photoresponse of the pristine LNO film indicates that the enhanced performance of the LNO/BFO film is not produced by the LNO layer itself (Fig. S5, ESI†). The transient photocurrent response reveals the higher and faster time response for the composite photocathode under chopped light illumination (20 Hz) at 0.9 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, the BFO photocathode displays current transients when the light switches on and off, labeled as A and B in Fig. 2(b).28 The cathodic photocurrent spike (A) is caused by the separation and transport of photocarriers inside the film (considering the surface screen effect of the electron scavenger): electrons move to the semiconductor surface and are captured by oxide species in the electrolyte, while the holes accumulate at the back contact or are transported to the counter electrode. The following photocurrent decay indicates that holes accumulate at the back contact and recombine with electrons from the conduction band, rather than being transported to the counter electrode and captured by reduced species. The anodic spike (B) can be observed due to the back reaction of conduction band electrons with holes accumulated at the back contact.29 In comparison, the composite photocathode shows a much better photocarrier collection efficiency.

The incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) gained further information about PEC performance. Fig. 2(c) reveals that the LNO charge collection layer rarely changes the onset wavelength (550 nm) but improves the IPCE performance. Furthermore, the maximum IPCE (at 350 nm) for the LNO/BFO photocathode is 2.7 times larger than the bare BFO photocathode. Taking these results together, we suggested that adding the LNO buffer layer can improve carrier dynamics (also improve the onset potential and the fill factor) and mitigated recombination (higher photocurrent and negligible current transients).30–32
Such an enhanced performance may be due to the increased light-harvesting of LNO/BFO films as LNO is light-dark by eye, studied by UV-vis absorption spectra. Fig. 2(d) shows an apparent increase in absorption for the composite film, especially in the wavelength longer than 550 nm. If the performance enhancement is only due to enhanced light absorption, the absorption photon conversion efficiency (APCE) should remain unchanged. However, the APCE improved similarly to that of IPCE after adding the LNO layer (Fig. 2(e)). This result indicates that the enhancement in PEC performance is mainly due to the improved charge collection efficiency,12,13 and, in addition, the absorbed photons rarely convert to electricity. Surface photovoltage spectra (SPS) further confirmed the above conclusions. The positive surface photovoltage shows that the photoinduced holes are traveling faster than the electrons and accumulating at the surface, which coincides with the p-type conductivity of BFO (downward band bending at the surface) (Fig. 2(f)). The smaller SPV of the bare BFO results from a relatively poor electron–hole separation efficiency. In contrast, the larger SPV after LNO addition indicates that the LNO layer promotes the charge separation in the BFO film.33
The enhanced charge collection efficiency and the resulting PEC performance improvement are mainly due to the reduced charge transport barrier at the FTO/BFO interface, which was investigated by measuring solid-state I–V responses. Samples were prepared by depositing BFO layers over the trenches in laser-cut FTO and FTO:LNO substrates, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S6 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3(b), the FTO/BFO/FTO film displays the I–V response such as back-to-back Schottky diodes, while the FTO:LNO/BFO/LNO:FTO film exhibits an approximately linear I–V response indicating a better ohmic contact of FTO:LNO/BFO. Here, FTO and LNO behave like metals rather than semiconductors since they are heavily doped. Fig. 3(c) shows the Fermi levels and valence band edges of FTO, LNO, and BFO films determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Considering that the work function of FTO (∼4.25 eV) is much different to the Fermi level of p-type BFO (∼4.84 eV), a Schottky junction will form at each FTO/BFO interface. As a result, the FTO/BFO/FTO sample is composed of back-to-back Schottky junctions. The inset in Fig. 3(b) shows the equivalent circuit, two diodes (J1 and J2) connected by a resistance (Rs) back-to-back. Rs is the total resistance from the circuit, which is dominated by the bulk resistance of the BFO channel. When a voltage (V) is applied, one of the diodes is reverse-biased, while another is forward-biased.34 The smaller current will limit the overall current in the reverse-biased diode. Considering the low turn-on voltage of a Schottky junction, we anticipate that the voltage is distributed to the reverse-biased junction. Based on the thermionic transport theory, the current of the equivalent circuit can be expressed by the following eqn (1) and (2).35 (1) (2)where Is is the reverse saturation current, T is the temperature in Kelvin, q is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, and n is the ideality factor. The ideality factor incorporated the influence of image force barrier lowering. Here, we focused on the positive V region since the samples show a symmetrical I–V response. Thus, eqn (1) can be arranged to eqn (3).35,36 (3)Fig. 3(d) displays the linear relationship of lnI/[exp(q (V − IRs)/kT) − 1] versus V − IRs in a positive V. The slope and y-axis intercept of the linear graph can be used to calculate n2 and Is2, respectively. Then, the Schottky barrier height is given by eqn (4) and (5). (4) (5)where A* is the effective Richardson constant, S is the junction area (2.5 × 10−9 m2), m* is the effective electron mass, and h is the Planck constant. Using the reported 0.37m0 for the m* of BFO and T at room temperature (300 K),37 the A* of BFO is 44.3 A cm−2 k−2. The Eb2 value for the FTO/BFO interface is determined to be 0.68 V. The FTO:LNO/BFO sample shows a higher current that increases nearly linearly with the applied voltage, indicating that the FTO:LNO/BFO contact is more ohmic without the Schottky barrier. Overall, these results in Fig. 3 provide direct evidence that the barrier for the charge carrier transfer is significantly lower at the FTO:LNO/BFO interface compared to the FTO/BFO interface.

Fig. 3(e) shows band alignments of FTO/BFO and FTO:LNO/BFO interfaces after forming solid–solid and solid–liquid junctions in the dark. The Fermi levels of FTO, LNO, and BFO are −4.25, −4.83, and −4.84 eV, respectively. The valence band edge of BFO is determined to be 1.08 eV. Taking the optical band gap of BFO (2.25 eV) into account (Fig. S7, ESI†), we constructed the relative band energy diagram of FTO, BFO, and LNO in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The significant mismatch in the Fermi level between FTO and BFO leads to a Schottky barrier at the FTO/BFO interface, which blocks photogenerated holes from passing through the interface and causes severe recombination. The LNO buffer layer makes photogenerated holes kinetic easier to pass through the interface and collected by FTO since LNO has a Fermi level close to BFO.
Carrier kinetics, like a lifetime, provides direct evidence of the reduced barrier height for charge transport using transient absorption spectroscopy (TA). Fig. 3(f) shows the transmission contour map (dT) of the bare BFO film. The central peak at 530 nm is attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transition between O and Bi (2.27 eV). The sharpness of signals from thin-film semiconductors is related to a modification of the semiconductor optical properties (the complex index of refraction) due to the perturbation of the charge carrier band population by the pump pulse.30,38 Kinetic traces at 530 nm with 400 nm excitation (Fig. 3(g) and 3(h)) were well fitted by three exponential functions with three-time constants. The first two time constants (τ1 and τ2) are related to hot carrier cooling and energy relaxation involving carrier-phonon scattering, respectively. The third time constant (τ3) is attributed to the trapping and recombination of charge carriers.39–41 The final carrier lifetime was calculated by summing up these three-time constants by weights. In comparison, the last carrier lifetime of the composite film is about 4 times that of the bare BFO. These results further elaborated the significant role of the LNO bottom layer in promoting the carrier collection in composite films.
Finally, the optimized BFO based photocathode was applied in the PEC system to synthesize H2O2 and performed in a homemade two-compartment cell. As shown in Fig. 4(a), a Nafion membrane was used to separate the working electrode (WE) and the counter electrode (CE). The electrolyte was 0.1 M KOH solution and purged with O2 (99.9%) gas for 30 min before and during the measurement. In the ORR process, O2 and H2O can be reduced to H2O2 by a two-electron pathway.5Fig. 4(b) shows the standard curve of H2O2 detection with an excellent linear correlation. Fig. 4(c) shows the production of H2O2 as a function of time under AM 1.5 irradiation at an applied bias at 0.6 V vs. RHE. The average H2O2 concentration of LNO/BFO was 278 μmol L−1, 2.8 times higher than that of BFO (100 μmol L−1). Additionally, recyclability tests revealed that the system could be used for stable H2O2 generation for 3 cycles without significant decay.

The faradaic efficiency (FE) for H2O2 formation was determined based on the typical calculation, as shown in eqn (6):8 (6)where N (H2O2) represents the produced H2O2 and Q refers to the total charge generated. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the LNO/BFO composite achieved a favorable FE of 36.5%, nearly 1.9 times larger than that of the bare BFO (19.2%). Such an enhanced selectivity to H2O2 production may be due to the increased reaction potential at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface for the composite film.42Fig. 4(e) shows the impedance data in Nyquist plots, where the composite film shows significantly reduced charge transport resistance.43 Therefore, reducing the resistance losses under a constant applied potential leads to an increased reaction potential, thereby increasing the selectivity for H2O2 production.
Conclusions
In summary, LNO as the functional charge collection layer was introduced between the FTO substrate and BFO film to modulate the interface charge transport barriers. J–V responses and IPCE measurements clearly showed the enhanced film performance by introducing the LNO layer, which improved the photocurrent by three times, an onset potential by 110 mV, and a fill factor by 38.8% compared to the bare BFO film. Solid-state electronic studies revealed the existence of unfavorable Schottky barriers at the interface of BFO/FTO and demonstrated that the barrier was reduced to zero with the introduction of the LNO layer. Furthermore, band alignment analyses indicate that LNO has a suitable Fermi level to form an ohmic contact with BFO. These results were confirmed by the prolonged carrier lifetime from ultrafast pump–probe spectroscopy analysis. Finally, the optimized LNO/BFO composite photocathode shows the great PEC H2O2 production activity of 278 μmol L−1 with a FE of 36.5%.

New concepts
An unfavorable charge transport barrier and related poor carrier dynamics are key factors that limited the performance of optoelectronic devices. To overcome this, a semiconductor thin film light absorber was sandwiched by an electron collection layer and a hole collection layer in a photovoltaic system to achieve efficient charge separation and collection. However, such a sandwich device architecture is rarely adopted in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices, especially for some emerging PEC materials. Moreover, nearly 90% of photocarriers were lost inside some ternary semiconductors due to poor kinetics caused by recombination. To this end, we developed a hole collection layer for p-type BiFeO3 to boost its application in solar-fuel conversion via carrier dynamics engineering. With the reduced charge transport barrier and enhanced kinetics, the optimized photoelectrode shows a state-of-the-art photocurrent and H2O2 production rate. These results open up a new strategy to improve the dynamics of photocarriers and provide appropriate guidance for the future photoelectrode design to target enhanced solar-fuel formation.
