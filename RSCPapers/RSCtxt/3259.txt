    , Accepted 10th October 2017First published on 10th October 2017AbstractPortable electronics powered by solar cells have become popular; however, they suffer from unstable power output of solar cells under fluctuating sunlight. Photocapacitors, integrated based on solar cells for photo-electricity energy conversion and supercapacitors for energy storage, are expected to solve the abovementioned problem. Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly achieved a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1%. On the other hand, polyaniline/carbon nanotube composite supercapacitors (PANI/CNT SCs) with an aqueous gel electrolyte have shown excellent energy storage performance. It's attractive to develop high-performance photocapacitors based on PSCs and PANI/CNT SCs, but is quite challenging because water from the aqueous electrolyte may get through the hydrophilic PANI/CNT to the PSCs and boost the degradation of the PSC absorber. In this study, a photocapacitor was integrated based on a PSC of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as an absorber and a PANI/CNT SC by fabricating a CNT bridge between the PSC part and the SC part. Owing to the large pseudocapacitance and great conductivity of the PANI/CNT electrode, this device showed a large specific area capacitance of 422 mF cm−2 (or specific mass capacitance of 103.4 F g−1), high coulombic efficiency of 96%, overall energy storage efficiency of 70.9%, and stable power output under complex illumination conditions such as fluctuating sunlight.

Introduction
Solar energy is clean and abundant and plays an important role in energy supply and environmental protection. To efficiently harvest solar energy, various solar cells have been developed such as junction solar cells,1 dye-sensitized cells,2,3 and organometal halide perovskite cells (PSCs).4 Portable electronics powered by solar cells have become popular, but suffer from unstable power output of solar cells under fluctuating sunlight. Photocapacitors, integrated based on solar cells for photo-electricity energy conversion and supercapacitors (SCs) for energy storage, are expected to solve the abovementioned problem and have attracted wide attention.5–19
It is important to enhance the energy conversion efficiency and energy storage performance of photocapacitors. Over the last few years, PSCs have been the focus of photovoltaic research and have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1% from 3.8% at an incredible rate,4,20–26 very promising in photovoltaic applications. To utilize the high PCE of PSCs, some self-powered devices were fabricated on PSCs. Xu et al. have presented a power pack combining a PSC and a polypyrrole-based SC in series using external lead wires,27 whereas integrated devices may have less energy loss and smaller footprint than separate devices.28,29 Zhou et al. demonstrated photovoltachromic SCs by integrating PSCs with MoO3/Au/MoO3 SCs, and a specific capacitance of 43 mF cm−2 was achieved.30 Xu et al. integrated photo-supercapacitors based on PEDOT-modified PSCs that contained a liquid organic electrolyte and showed a specific capacitance of 12 mF cm−2.31 Liu et al. demonstrated the integration of perovskite solar cell and solid-state supercapacitors for power packs, showing a specific capacitance of 61.01 mF cm−2.32 However, low capacitances of these storage parts limited their performance. Owing to the huge pseudocapacitance and great conductivity of the polyaniline/carbon nanotube composite (PANI/CNT), PANI/CNT SCs with an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte (PVA electrolyte) showed a large capacitance and excellent energy storage performance.33–37 It's attractive to develop high-performance photocapacitors based on PSCs and PANI/CNT SCs, but is quite challenging because water from the PVA electrolyte may get through the hydrophilic PANI/CNT to PSCs and boost the degradation of the PSC absorbers.
In this study, we successfully integrated a photocapacitor based on a PSC with CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as an absorber and a PANI/CNT SC by fabricating a CNT bridge between the PSC part and the SC part. This device showed a large specific capacitance, high coulombic efficiency, and energy storage efficiency. With a large capacitance, this device presented stable power output under complex illumination conditions such as fluctuating sunlight. Photocapacitors designed in this study provide a reference for the development of high-performance photocapacitors with a large capacitance.

Preparation of the PMMA/SACNT-PANI@acSACNT/PVA (PSP) electrode material
SACNT was heated at high temperatures in air to obtain active-SACNT (acSACNT). Then, the PANI@acSACNT paper was synthesized using a previously described in situ polymerization method.34 In brief, the acSACNT paper was prepared by filtering the acSACNT/ethanol solution and then soaked in an aniline/HCl aqueous solution and (NH4)2S2O8 aqueous solution to obtain the PANI@acSACNT paper. This step involves the so-called in situ chemical reaction and generated the PANI-coated acSACNT well. Then, the SACNT/ethanol solution was filtered through the abovementioned PANI@acSACNT paper. Conveniently, the side of the paper covered by the SACNT layer was marked as the S-side, and the other side was marked as the P-side. After coating the PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte (PVA electrolyte) onto the P-side, the paper was soaked in the PMMA/toluene solution. When the paper was dry, PMMA on the P-side was removed using acetone to obtain the PSP electrode material (Fig. S2a and b†).
Device fabrication
FTO glass was ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol (IPA) in sequence and dried with compressed nitrogen. After depositing a compact titanium dioxide (TiO2) block layer onto the FTO substrate, a PbI2 film was deposited by spin-coating PbI2/N,N-dimethylformamide solution, and a MWCNT film was deposited by drop-casting the MWCNT/chlorobenzene solution subsequently. Then, the CH3NH3I/IPA solution was dropped onto the abovementioned substrate and heated to obtain the organometal halide perovskite MAPbI3 as the light absorber. When the substrate was cooled down to room temperature, extra MAPbI3 was removed, and a MAPbI3 film with an area of 1.5 × 1.7 cm2 was left (Fig. S2c†). A PMMA film was deposited onto the substrate by spin-coating the PMMA/toluene solution, and the PSC part was prepared.
After fabricating the PSC part, a PSP electrode was placed onto the PSC substrate with the S-side of the PSP close to the PMMA film of the PSC. Then, some chlorobenzene was dropped onto the P-side of the PSP to dissolve and reshape the PMMA film between the PSC part and the PSP electrode (Fig. 2a). When the substrate was dry and glued with the PVA electrolyte, another PSP electrode was attached onto the substrate to complete the SC part. Finally, a PMMA film was coated onto the substrate to finish the photocapacitor (Fig. S2c and d†).
Characterization
Contact angle analysis (Dataphysics Instruments Gmbh OCA 20, Germany), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, EI Sirion 200, USA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2500PC, Japan) were used to characterize the samples. The current–voltage (J–V), current–time, and voltage–time characteristics were measured using digital source meters (Keithley Instruments 2410, USA) and a solar simulator (Zolix Solar Simulator SS1000A, with the standard solar cell of QE-B1, China) with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination by masking the active area of the PSC with a mask window (1 cm2) at room temperature. The electrochemical performances were studied by galvanostatic charging–discharging (Land Battery Testing System CT2001A, China) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments (PARSTAT 2273, USA).
Results and discussion
PSP electrode material and CNT bridge
As reported earlier, SACNT is a hydrophobic metallic hole conductor.38,39 After being heated at elevated temperatures in air, SACNT was oxidized and possessed good water wetting property.40 Herein, after being shaken sharply in water, SACNT floated on the surface of water. In contrast, acSACNT with hydrophilic oxygen functional groups40 was wetted by water and sank to the bottom (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1d shows the structure of the PSP electrode material. On the one hand, with a thickness of 100 ± 5 μm and a mass density of 2.04 mg cm−2 (Fig. S2b†), PSP could be fabricated into small integrated devices easily. On the other hand, with a continuous SACNT and PANI@acSACNT network (Fig. 1e and f) as a pathway for charge carriers, PSP presented good conductivity with a low sheet resistance of 1.35 ± 0.1 Ω cm−2. Moreover, the area of PSP was decided by the filter used during fabrication, and a larger PSP could be made with larger filters, used as electrodes for large-area electronics. On the S-side of PSP, the dense PMMA/SACNT film (Fig. 1g) had no pores and showed much better hydrophobicity than the pure PMMA film (Fig. 1b and c). On the P-side of PSP, after being coated with hydrophilic PANI, PANI@acSACNT showed a porous structure (Fig. 1f), which benefitted the PVA electrolyte to incorporate well into PANI@acSACNT (Fig. 1h). Therefore, H+ and SO42− in the PVA electrolyte could dope into or de-dope from PANI@acSACNT fast, and PANI@acSACNT showed a huge pseudocapacitance and good charge–discharge performance.35

It's attractive to develop high-performance photocapacitors on MAPbI3 PSCs and PANI/CNT SCs, but PANI@acSACNT could not contact MAPbI3 directly. Otherwise, hydrophilic PANI@acSACNT might act as a pathway for the transport of water from the PVA electrolyte to MAPbI3, and MAPbI3 would degrade fast (eqn (S18)–(S21)†). To solve this challenging problem, by constructing a CNT bridge as a common electrode to connect the PSC part and the SC part, a photocapacitor was integrated on a PSC and a PANI/CNT SC (Fig. 2a, S2c and d†). As abovementioned in the Experimental section, when the SC part was fabricated onto the PSC substrate, some chlorobenzene was used to dissolve and reshape the PMMA film between the PSC part and the SC part. When PMMA was dissolved, SACNT bundles on the S-side of the PSP electrode were driven by gravity and stretched into the PMMA film towards the MWCNT electrode of the PSC part. Once enough chlorobenzene was used, SACNT bundles would touch the MWCNT electrode, and a CNT bridge was formed. Since the shunt circuit has a much smaller resistance than the series circuit (Fig. S3†), integrated devices have less energy loss than non-integrated devices.29 After forming in the PMMA film, the CNT bridge could act as a pathway for holes to move between the two electrodes in an energy saving way (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the PMMA film is hydrophobic and tractable, often being used to prevent water from reaching PSCs and enhance the stability of PSCs.21,41,42 Herein, the entry of water from the PVA electrolyte was prevented by the PMMA film between the SC part and the PSC part.
 Fig. 2  (a) Schematic of the photocapacitor in this study and (b) behaviors and corresponding schematic circuits of the MWCNT electrode and the PSP electrode before and after CNT bridge formation. 
To understand how the CNT bridge worked, a simulated CNT bridge was constructed using the FTO glass as the substrate and MWCNT and PSP as two electrodes with an area of 1 cm2. As Fig. 2b shows, before the CNT bridge formed, the two electrodes behaved like a parallel plate capacitor, and use of more chlorobenzene brought the CNT bundles closer; this resulted in a larger capacitance C. After the CNT bridge formed, the two electrodes behaved like a resistor, and use of more chlorobenzene caused more CNT bundles to connect; this resulted in a smaller resistance R. When the volume of chlorobenzene used was more than 70 μL, the CNT bridge formed, and the resistance R was smaller than 15.2 Ω. Herein, 100 μL of chlorobenzene was used to reshape the PMMA film.
Performances of the PSC part and the SC part
Before investigating the performance of the photocapacitor, performances of the PSC part and the SC part were studied first. Fig. S4 and eqn (S1)† show the equivalent circuit and equation of the solar cells. Under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight of 100 mW cm−2, the output characteristics of the PSC part were studied by testing dozens of PSCs before and after integration with the SC part. Herein, PSC 1 represented PSCs before integration, and PSC 2 represented PSCs after integration. When light was on, as shown in Fig. 3a, photo-excited electron–hole pairs would generate in the MAPbI3 absorber, and electrons moved to TiO2 and FTO front electrode, whereas holes moved to the MWCNT electrode and the common electrode.

Fig. 3b shows the typical J–V curves of the PSC part. Without integration with the SC part, PSC 1 presented an open-circuit (VOC) of 0.711 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.645 mA cm−2, fill factor (FF) of 0.396, and PCE of 2.713%, not as good as the PSCs with PCE of 22.1% reported by Shin et al.20 In this study, MAPbI3 was deposited in air via a two-step spin-coating method. This method was easy to conduct, but difficult to obtain a high-quality MAPbI3 film.43 As shown in Fig. 3c, the XRD pattern of the MAPbI3/MWCNT film in this study suggested that there were some PbI2 and TiO2 in the MAPbI3/MWCNT film. These defects spoiled the quality of the MAPbI3 film and caused a photocurrent leakage problem in the PSC part that resulted in the shunt resistance (Rsh) of the PSC part to be as low as 303.7 Ω cm−2 and limited the energy conversion efficiency of the PSC part. After integration with the SC part, owing to the close connection of the CNT bridge between the PSC part and the SC part, PSC 2 showed almost the same VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE as PSC 1; this meant that it was practical to integrate PSCs with PANI/CNT SCs using the CNT bridge. Table 1 shows the performances of ten photocapacitors in this study, and more details are shown in Table S2.†

After fabrication, PSC 1 and PSC 2 were exposed to air for one week and showed similar J–V performances (Fig. S5†). Their VOC remained around 0.7 V, but JSC and PCE declined about 13%. Although the PMMA film could protect MAPbI3 from water and oxygen outside the PSC part, during fabrication in air, oxygen and water were absorbed onto the surface of MAPbI3/MWCNT, which boosted the degradation of MAPbI3 in the PSC part (eqn (S18)–(S21)†). As a comparison, other PSCs, whose MAPbI3 absorbers were not covered by the PMMA film, did not work after one week because their MAPbI3 absorber degraded fast in air. Herein, PSC 2 showed a stability similar to that of PSC 1, much better than that of PSCs without the PMMA film; this indicated the feasibility of fabricating photocapacitors with the CNT bridge. In this study, we focused on the feasibility of integrating photocapacitors on PSCs and PANI/CNT SCs and achieved satisfying results. However, some efforts could be made to improve the performances of the PSC part. For example, by adding a mesoscopic TiO2 thin film to the compact TiO2 block layer to enhance the Rsh, PSCs with a similar configuration achieved a high PCE of 12.67% and FF of 0.80 in this study.44 To improve the stability of the PSC part, some methods would help such as fabrication of PSCs in dry nitrogen or controlling the temperature.45
After integration with the PSC part, the electrochemical performance of the SC part was studied using a common electrode and a counter electrode. The redox peaks in the cyclic voltammetry curves indicated the presence of the pseudocapacitance of PANI (Fig. 4a). During the galvanostatic charge–discharge process (Fig. 4b), the SC part showed a maximum specific area capacitance CA of 422.0 mF cm−2 (or specific mass capacitance CM of 103.4 F g−1). Moreover, after 500 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, the SC part presented a good cycle performance and maintained a high coulombic efficiency ηcoul of about 96%, and the capacitance had a retention of over 70% (Fig. 4c). Owing to the good incorporation of the PVA electrolyte into the porous structure of the PANI/CNT network and the large pseudocapacitance of the PANI/CNT34,35 as compared to that of the earlier reported planar photocapacitors (Table S1†), this photocapacitor achieved a large CA (or CM) and high ηcoul at the same time.

Performance of the photocapacitor
After integrating the PSCs for energy conversion and the PANI/CNT SCs for energy storage, the power conversion and energy storage performances of the photocapacitor were studied. Under light, once the front electrode and counter electrode were connected, the PSC part began to charge the SC part; this process was named photo charging. Fig. 5a shows the typical photo charging process of this photocapacitor. It is suggested that during photo charging, the charging current density and rise speed of voltage both decline. That was logical. As the typical J–V curves of PSC 2 (Fig. 3b) show, when its voltage increased, the output current density of the PSC 2 declined. However, the output power density of the PSC 2 declined after increasing to the maximum value of PM of 2.548 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3b and eqn (S13)†); this indicated that this photocapacitor presented a power conversion efficiency ηphcha of 1.07–1.10% during photo charging (eqn (S17†)). When the voltage of the photocapacitor reached 0.7 V, the switch was turned off (Fig. 2a), and galvanostatic discharging experiments were conducted to the SC part at a different current density (Fig. 5b). During the whole photo charging–galvanostatic discharging process, this photocapacitor showed a high coulombic efficiency ηcoul of 95.8%, energy storage efficiency ηstorage of 70.3–70.9%, and overall energy conversion efficiency ηoverall of 0.76–0.77% (eqn (S15) and (S16)†). Since ηstorage is high, a low ηoverall mainly resulted from low ηphcha. As abovementioned, if the voltage of the PSC 2 is kept at VM, the output power would be PM, and ηoverall of the photocapacitor would be much improved.

(a) Current and voltage of the photocapacitor during photo charging; (b) photo charging and galvanostatic discharging processes; (c) and (d) output performances of PSC alone (PSC 1) and the photocapacitor respectively under different illumination conditions. 
However, when applied in portable electronics, photocapacitors might have to work under complex illumination conditions, such as fluctuating sunlight, which might be caused by clouds or buildings. By intermittently shading the devices, fluctuating sunlight was simulated. In this study, the output performances of the PSC 1 and the photocapacitor were studied under three illumination conditions – light, fluctuating sunlight, and dark (Fig. 5c and d). At the onset of charge under light, the voltage of PSC 1 rapidly increased to 0.7 V, whereas the photocapacitor was photo charged to 0.7 V after 80 s. Afterwards, when shade appeared, the voltage of the PSC 1 decreased down to 0, whereas the voltage of the photocapacitor declined much more slowly than that of the PSC 1. When under illumination again, the voltages of PSC 1 and the photocapacitor increased. Later, in dark, PSC 1 and the photocapacitor started to self-discharge. However, the voltage of PSC 1 reached 0 within two seconds, whereas the voltage of the photocapacitor declined slowly, approximately exponential with time. As Fig. S6† shows, because the switch was on, the PSC part and the SC part inside the photocapacitor formed an RC circuit in the dark. Owing to the large capacitance, the photocapacitor possessed a long discharge time and its voltage remained above 0.3 V for more than 300 s in the dark. Since PSC 1 represented solar cells alone, it is obvious that the photocapacitor showed a more stable output than solar cells alone under complex illumination conditions such as fluctuating sunlight. Therefore, photocapacitors might be more suitable than solar cells for solar-powered portable electronics.
Conclusions
In summary, we integrated a photocapacitor based on a PSC with CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) as an absorber and a PANI/CNT SC. By fabricating a CNT bridge as a common electrode, on the one hand, holes could move between the PSC part and the SC part in an energy saving way; on the other hand, water from the PVA electrolyte in the SC part was prevented from degrading MAPbI3 in the PSC part. Owing to the large pseudocapacitance and great conductivity of PANI/CNT, this device showed a large specific area capacitance of 422 mF cm−2 (or specific mass capacitance of 103.4 F g−1), high coulombic efficiency of 96%, and overall energy storage efficiency of 70.9%. With the large capacitance, this device showed more stable power output than PSCs alone under complex illumination conditions such as fluctuating sunlight. Therefore, photocapacitors might be more suitable than solar cells for solar-powered portable electronics. In this study, we focused on the feasibility of integrating photocapacitors based on PSCs and PANI/CNT SCs and achieved satisfying results. However, there still remain efforts to enhance the stability and the energy conversion efficiency of this device in the future. The photocapacitor designed in this study provides a reference for the development of high-performance photocapacitors with a large capacitance.
