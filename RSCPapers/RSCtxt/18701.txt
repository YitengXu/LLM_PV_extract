    , Accepted 14th July 2014First published on 14th July 2014AbstractIn this work, we demonstrated the dependence of crystallographic characteristics and electronic structures on indium amounts in the indium–zinc–selenium alloy fabricated by vapour-phase deposition. By taking advantage of molecular beam epitaxy and a synchrotron radiation apparatus, it is shown for the first time that the significant difference in vapour pressure between zinc and indium induced zinc deficiency in the solid state and resulted in a transition of five distinct phases in the whole range of the alloy from zinc selenide to indium selenide. The binary ZnSe with indium dopants, the ZnSe-rich alloy with a minority of ZnIn2Se4, the disordered structure owing to the comparable mixture of ZnSe and ZnIn2Se4, the ZnIn2Se4-rich alloy with a minority of ZnSe, and the binary In2Se3 phase are separated by indium incorporation ratios of 0.01, 0.02, 0.18, and 0.69, respectively. Moreover, a pronounced carrier localisation effect was observed in the ZnSe-rich and the disordered mixture. The widely distributed mid-gap states were attributed to a high density of zinc vacancies in the ZnSe-based lattice. In brief, these fundamental properties show the feasibility of Se-based II–III2–VI4 alloys for optoelectronics.
Introduction
Ternary and quaternary selenide compounds continuously act as promising materials for optoelectronic applications. One of the most attractive selenides is the chalcopyrite CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS), which is capable of replacing Si-based photovoltaic devices. Solar cells with a conversion efficiency of 20.3% had been achieved based on the CIGS absorbing layer.1 Besides the quaternary alloy, II–III2–Se4 ternary alloys gained considerable interest. Because of its high photosensitivity in the visible range, cadmium indium selenide (CdGa2Se4) encouraged potential applications in photodetection and radiation measurements.2 Cadmium indium selenide (CdIn2Se4) with a narrower bandgap makes it an alternative candidate for photovoltaic application.3 As for ZnIn2Se4, various feasibility studies have been reported, including the photoelectrochemical cells,4 the absorbing layer of solar cells,5 and the buffer layer6 between the p-type CIGS absorbing layer and the n-type ZnO window layer. However, although ZnIn2Se4 satisfies various potential fields, some uncovered problems remain. In particular, incorporating a group III element into group II–VI compounds shows a high probability of altering the crystalline order. Hence the exact stoichiometry for generating ordered ZnIn2Se4 in the indium–zinc–selenium alloy would be a critical technical challenge. In addition, the optical properties of not only ZnIn2Se4, but also of other phases in the In–Zn–Se alloy, are complicated and require comprehensive studies.
Recently, fabricating the ZnIn2Se4 compound has been attempted by using various processes such as spray pyrolysis,5 coevaporation,6 vertical Bridgman technique,7 and the selenisation of the Zn–In metal alloy.4,8 Nevertheless, almost all of the results exhibit a polycrystalline and non-stoichiometric nature. For instance, for the In–Zn–Se alloy fabricated by the selenisation process of the Zn–In metal alloy, one group found a dominant structure of polycrystalline ZnSe at the indium composition below 0.5,8 whereas another group found a polycrystalline ZnIn2Se4 structure at the indium composition between 0.24 and 0.39.4 To date, the discovery of these uncertainties is found lacking. Moreover, the electronic structure of the Zn–In–Se alloy exhibits similar uncertainties.
Previously, slight indium doping with a concentration of about 10 to 50 ppm was performed to raise the conductivity of ZnSe single crystals by several orders of magnitude.9–11 However, once the indium content reaches 0.1%, a large resistivity of 105 Ω cm and a pronounced yellow emission were observed as interpreted by the self-compensating effect. As for the abovementioned polycrystalline ZnIn2Se4, a direct transition of 1.68–1.81 eV at room temperature was observed.4 On the contrary, some results reveal a direct bandgap of 1.774 eV with an indirect bandgap of 1.624 eV.7 To overcome these uncertainties, accurate investigations on both the crystalline characteristics and the physical properties of the In–Zn–Se alloy as a function of the solid solubility of indium are required.
In this article, In–Zn–Se alloys were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on the GaAs(100) substrate, and the whole range of composition from zinc selenide to indium selenide was controlled by the vapour flux of each element. For precise characterization, a synchrotron radiation apparatus was used. The crystallographic transition of the vapour-phase-deposited In–Zn–Se alloy was demonstrated for the first time to accomplish the growth phase diagram of the alloy. Follow-up investigations on the corresponding electronic structures and optical properties of crystallographic transition were also performed. The origin of the variable stoichiometry, crystallography, and electronic structure is discussed in this work, which would provide effective fundamental knowledge of this material.
Experimental details
Thin films of In–Zn–Se alloys were grown on semi-insulating GaAs(100) substrates at 400 °C by using a home-made molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. For better crystalline quality, the reference binary ZnSe thin film was grown under Se-rich conditions. Under the same conditions, In–Zn–Se alloys were grown as the effusion cell temperature of indium was varied from 350 to 650 °C. As for another reference, an InSe specimen was grown at an indium cell temperature of 650 °C without zinc flow. The thickness of these specimens was revealed by scanning electron microscopy. In comparison to the binary ZnSe, the thickness decreases from 320 to 240 nm as the In cell temperature reaches 400 °C. A minimum thickness of 48 nm occurs at the temperature of 450 °C. Further increases of the indium supply result in a thickness between 120 and 150 nm. The stoichiometric properties of these alloys were measured by energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Crystallographic investigations were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), in which X-ray beams were generated by an in-house Cu Kα source (λ = 1.540 Å) and the wiggler synchrotron radiation beamline BL17B (λ = 1.549 Å) at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. For the investigations on local atomic structures and defects, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements above the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) were carried out at the wiggler synchrotron radiation beamline BL17C at NSRRC. Measurements were operated in fluorescence mode using a gas ionisation chamber with an energy resolution of about 1 eV. EXAFS spectra were analysed using the standard procedure of Athena 0.8.056 and Artemis 0.8.012 with the IFEFFIT package. Furthermore, the electronic structures and the recombination processes of the thin films were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and reflectance and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. XPS measurements were done at the WR-SGM synchrotron beamline BL24A at NSRRC under the conditions of an exciting energy of 750 eV with an energy resolving power of 10000. Reflectance and photoluminescence measurement samples were excited by a halogen lamp and a diode laser at 403 nm, respectively. The optical signals were analysed by a Horiba Jobin-Yvon iHR550 0.5 m monochromator and detected by a LN2-cooled charge-coupled device with an energy resolution of 0.3 meV.
Results and discussion
1 Transition of stoichiometry and crystallography

Table 1 shows the normalized atomic composition of indium, zinc, and selenium in the In–Zn–Se alloy and reference specimens. The incorporation ratio of indium to all cations, [In]/([In] + [Zn]), was introduced in this study as shown in Fig. 1. Under our growth conditions, the ZnSe thin film exhibits a Se-rich condition with a [Zn]/[Se] value of ~0.85. A clear decrease in [Zn]/[Se] to ~0.51 was found at an indium cell temperature of 450 °C in which the indium incorporation ratio is 0.02. When the indium cell temperature exceeds 600 °C, a large amount of incorporated indium atoms was observed in the solid state with a similar trend for selenium, whereas the relative composition of zinc dramatically decreased. It implies that indium incorporation hinders the solid composition of zinc. For instance, as the indium cell temperature reached 650 °C, a [Zn]/[Se] value of ~0.13 was observed. To our knowledge, this significant drop in the relative solid solubility of Zn during the vapour-phase deposition of Zn–In–Se alloy was not usually discussed. We proposed a reasonable explanation based on the different vapour pressures of each element. At a substrate temperature of 400 °C during growth, the vapour pressure of zinc is about 0.1 mmHg, which is significantly higher than that of indium (less than 10−8 mmHg).12 Therefore, during a simultaneous supply of indium and zinc, the latter exhibits much more opportunities to escape from the surface before forming a strong chemical bond, and thus zinc deficiency in the solid-state In–Zn–Se alloy is expected.

 Fig. 1  Indium incorporation ratios in the Zn–In–Se alloy as a function of In cell temperature. 
After justifying the atomic composition during vapour-phase deposition, the crystallographic properties corresponding to the various compositions in the In–Zn–Se alloy were demonstrated by using X-ray diffraction. Fig. 2(a) shows the radial (θ–2θ) scans along the surface normal by using in-house instruments. Pronounced diffractions of ~31.6° and ~66.0° from GaAs(200) and GaAs(400), respectively, were observed at 2θ. A broad hump at the high-angle side of GaAs(200) was considered as diffracted signals by the Cu Kβ line of the in-house X-ray source. Besides, some additional peaks from the thin film appear in the diffraction spectra. As the indium cell temperature is less than 450 °C, in which the corresponding indium incorporation ratio is 0.02, a shoulder centred at 2θ of ~65.8° was observed and attributed to the diffraction peaks from ZnSe(400). The centre position of the shoulder seems insensitive to the indium amount, which indicates that the crystal structure under low-level indium incorporation is dominated by the ZnSe phase. As the indium cell temperature increases from 450–600 °C, the indium incorporation ratio increases from 0.03 to 0.18 and the ZnSe(400) diffraction shoulder becomes weaker and more broadened, implying that a disordered phase transition occurred in the alloy. In addition, an apparent change in the alloy structure occurs once the indium cell temperature exceeds 630 °C. Within a 20 °C increment, it was found that there is an increase in the indium incorporation ratio from 0.30 to 0.69, together with three additional peaks at ~15.6°, ~47.5°, and ~65.0° in the XRD 2θ scans. It indicates that new crystalline phases could be created under high-level indium incorporation. According to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standard database (JCPDS), the peak at ~65.0° could be attributed to the diffraction from the (008) plane of tetragonal ZnIn2Se4 (JCPDS no. 75-0741). However, the peak at ~15.6° is similar to the diffraction from either the (002) plane of ZnIn2Se4 at ~15.4° or the (101) plane of γ-In2Se3 (JCPDS no. 65-3639) at ~15.0°. The peak at ~47.5° also shows a similar condition, in which ZnIn2Se4(006) and γ-In2Se3(208) reveal diffraction near ~47.6°. In order to identify the origins of the new generated peaks, off-normal XRD radial scans were also implemented. Diffractions from ZnIn2Se4 which were reported in the database of JCPDS were apparent, while those from γ-In2Se3 were not observed by either in-house or synchrotron radiation apparatus. Moreover, azimuthal scans shown in Fig. 2(b) reveal four 90°-separated peaks from ZnIn2Se4(112), which verified the four-fold symmetry of the tetragonal structure. The azimuthal scan from GaAs(111) was also plotted in Fig. 2(b) and the in-plane epitaxial relationship between the ZnIn2Se4 and the substrate follows [110]ZnIn2Se4∥[110]GaAs.

Furthermore, the effect of zinc incorporation on the crystalline properties in the indium-rich region of the In–Zn–Se alloy was also discussed. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the reference InSe specimen with a [In]/[Se] of ~0.39 exhibits diffraction peaks at ~18.5° and ~27.8°. The former is considered as the diffraction from the (004) plane of α-In2Se3 (JCPDS no. 34-1279). The latter could be attributed to α-In2Se3(006) as well as γ-In2Se3(006) (JCPDS 65-3639). However, on the basis of the relative intensity listed on the JCPDS database, the contribution from α-In2Se3 is minor. Although the diffractions from higher-order peaks of the (00l) family were too weak, the result reveals that the preferred structure of the InxSey thin film on the GaAs(001) substrate is the defect wurtzite structure γ-In2Se3,13 coexisting with the layered structure α-In2Se3.14 Once a small amount of zinc was supplied, the layered and hexagonal structures were destroyed and the tetragonal ternary ZnIn2Se4 dominates instead.
In brief, in-house XRD measurements reveal the rough characteristics of the crystals in the whole composition range of the In–Zn–Se alloy, including the alternation of the binary structures and the formation of phase-separated and disordered compounds. However, deep investigations on crystallographic characteristics were limited. The major limitation originates from the poor angular resolution of the in-house diffractometer. Because the separation of the Bragg angle between ZnSe(h00) and GaAs(h00) is less than the angular resolution, these two diffraction peaks could not be completely distinguished. In order to overcome this problem, synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction was also performed. Taking advantage of a photon flux of 1010 photons per second generated in BL17B and an angular resolution of 0.001° provided by the Huber diffractometer, not only could the minor phase be clearly identified, but also a more accurate determination of lattice parameters and the corresponding built-in strain could be demonstrated for developing a model of the crystallographic transition.
As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the radial scans along the L and H directions near the diffraction peaks from GaAs(004) and GaAs(111), respectively, were plotted for selected indium incorporation ratios. In this study, the L and H values are expressed in the reciprocal lattice unit (r.l.u.), which is referred to the lattice constant of GaAs (JCPDS no. 32-0389) with a = 5.6538 Å at room temperature. For the reference ZnSe thin film, based on the Bragg diffraction positions at L = 3.9837 and H = 0.9976, surface-normal and in-plane lattice constants of 5.6769 Å and 5.6626 Å were calculated. In comparison to the relaxed value of bulk ZnSe (JCPDS no. 80-0021), a = 5.6688 Å, a 0.10% in-plane contraction and a 0.14% surface-normal expansion were observed, owing to the residual mismatch strain between the ZnSe film and the GaAs substrate. As for the slight indium-doped conditions, in which the incorporation ratio is less than 0.01, the remaining diffraction position at the H-scan together with an obvious decrease at the L-scan reveals that the in-plane and surface-normal lattice constants change to 5.6582 Å and 5.6859 Å, respectively. An increased surface-normal tension of 0.32% was extrapolated together with an increased in-plane compression of 0.18%. A more pronounced increase of tension along the surface normal rather than that of in-plane compression indicates that the larger indium atoms tend to be distributed in the ZnSe lattice along the growth direction.

Once the indium solubility exceeds the detection limit to generate zinc-deficient sites in the lattice, several small crystalline features, which were not detected in Fig. 2, were discovered by using the synchrotron radiation apparatus. First, at an incorporation ratio of 0.02, together with the diffraction of ZnSe(111) at a higher H value of 0.9981, a much weaker peak located at H = 0.9884 was clearly distinguished. The new diffraction, reasonably attributed to the ZnIn2Se4(112) plane, indicates a small amount of phase separation in the alloy. In coincidence with the starting zinc composition revealed by EDX measurements, it is appropriate to expect the coexistence of indium incorporation and zinc loss in some unit cells which results in the defect-chalcopyrite ZnIn2Se4 structure containing two zinc vacancies.15 On the contrary, most other unit cells retain a similar structure to the indium-doped ZnSe. In comparison to the specimen with an incorporation ratio of less than 0.01, the variation of tensile strain in the ZnSe structure along the surface normal is negligible. Nevertheless, in-plane compression increases from 0.18% to 0.26%. The anisotropic feature of residual strain could also be attributed to phase separation. We propose that because the secondary ZnIn2Se4 structure exhibits a larger unit cell, it could provide an additional in-plane compression to the surrounding ZnSe:In structure. Owing to the small amount of ZnIn2Se4, the contribution to the surface normal could be relatively small. In addition, clear interferences were observed in Fig. 3(a). According to the theory of Laue oscillations,16 the relationship between the separations of the fringes Δθ and the thin film thickness d is expressed as d = λ/2 cosθΔθ, where λ is the wavelength of the excitation source. The extrapolated thickness is 46 ± 9 nm, which coincides with the value measured by scanning electron microscopy. Moreover, because other specimens are too thick, interference fringes were not observed.
On the contrary, the specimen with an indium incorporation ratio of 0.69 also exhibits a clear phase separation while the dominant structure is ZnIn2Se4 instead of ZnSe. As for ZnIn2Se4, L and H values of 3.9231 and 0.9887 exhibit lattice constants of a = 5.6957 Å and c = 11.5292 Å, respectively. In relation to the relaxed value, the ZnIn2Se4 phase was under an in-plane contraction of 0.24% and a surface-normal expansion of 0.70%. On the other hand, the minor ZnSe phase exhibits a peak at H = 0.9993. Although the diffraction is too weak to be distinguished in the L-scan, a more in-plane compressive feature of ZnSe could still be expected. We proposed that the in-plane compression applied on the amount-governed ZnIn2Se4 phase results from the lattice mismatch between ZnIn2Se4 and GaAs. On the other hand, the increased compressive strain of the secondary ZnSe:In structure was attributed to the induced stress from the surrounding ZnIn2Se4 matrix with a larger volume of unit cells.
Finally, for the specimen with an indium incorporation ratio between 0.03 and 0.18, synchrotron radiation measurements provide a more clear discussion on the disordered structures, which were found by in-house measurements. As shown in Fig. 3(b), in addition to a broad peak at the L-scan, two shoulders centred at H = 0.9981 and H = 0.9993 indicated that the ZnSe:In structure consists of two lattice parameters. These distinct lattice parameters coincide with the abovementioned results measured from specimens with incorporation ratios of 0.02 and 0.69. Therefore, we proposed that ZnSe:In structures are applied in two different magnitudes of in-plane compression at the same time. The coexistence of different in-plane strains was proposed by the non-uniform spatial distribution of ZnIn2Se4. According to the abovementioned discussion, the larger compression indicates that the ZnSe:In structures are surrounded by a denser amount of ZnIn2Se4. On the contrary, the smaller compression is attributed to the smaller amount of surrounding ZnIn2Se4. Therefore, the whole crystalline structure, which consists of ZnSe and ZnIn2Se4, would result in a long-range disorder. Moreover, it is interesting that the disordered structure was not found at the middle range of the composition in the ternary diagram. We suggested that the significant difference in vapour pressure between zinc and indium was a possible candidate. Because it is easier to produce zinc vacancies during vapour-phase deposition, the starting incorporation ratio of 0.02 for the formation of ZnIn2Se4 in the In–Zn–Se alloy is much lower. Owing to the synchrotron radiation studies, a more precise prediction of phase transition was demonstrated. In combination with stoichiometric and crystallographic results and discussions, a ternary phase diagram of the In–Zn–Se alloy was established as shown in Fig. 4. The stoichiometric ZnSe, In2Se3, and ZnInSe4 alloys, as well as the pseudo-binary tie line, were also plotted in the phase diagram as grey circles and dashed lines. One of the apparent features in vapour-phase deposition is that the Se-rich stoichiometry covers the whole composition range in the In–Zn–Se alloy. Another one is that the five distinct phases, including the pure ZnSe, the ZnIn2Se4 embedded in a ZnSe-rich matrix, the disordered mixture, the ZnSe embedded in a ZnIn2Se4-rich matrix, and the pure In2Se3, were demonstrated and labelled as regions (i) to (v), respectively. As indium solubility increases, the separation between each phase occurs at 0.02, 0.03, 0.18, and 0.69. To our knowledge, it is the first demonstration of the specific crystallographic structures and the transition in the In–Zn–Se alloy fabricated by vapour-phase deposition.

The abovementioned discussion was based on the presumption that the large difference in vapour pressure between zinc and indium would consequently induce zinc vacancies in the solid state. In order to provide experimental evidence, the local atomic structure surrounding a Zn atom was investigated by evaluating the EXAFS spectra at different indium incorporation ratios. Fig. 5 shows the k1-weighted EXAFS signals and their radial distribution function after Fourier transform (FT), where γ represents the magnitude of the oscillatory interference as a function of wave vector k in the range of 3.5 to 11.5 Å−1. The radial distribution function of the binary ZnSe reveals two peaks centred at 2.48 and 4.01 Å, which were attributed to the nearest Zn–Se bond and the next nearest Zn–Zn bond, respectively. The experimental results coincide with the theoretical bond lengths of zinc blende ZnSe based on the space group F3m. As indium atoms were doped with an incorporation ratio less than 0.02, the intensity of the next nearest Zn–Zn bond gradually decreases, while that of the nearest Zn–Se bond is unchanged. One possible candidate for this difference is supported by the formation of vacancies.17,18 The extrapolated coordination number of the nearest Zn–Se bond remains at about 3.96 to 4.01, while that of the next nearest Zn–Zn bond decreases from 12.09 to 11.17 with increasing indium incorporation ratio. Because the coordination numbers of a perfect ZnSe structure are 4 and 12 for the nearest and next-nearest bond, the decreasing value of the Zn–Zn bond indicates the formation of zinc vacancies after indium incorporation.

2 Electronic structures in the In–Zn–Se alloy
Following the investigations on crystallography, the discovery of the corresponding electronic structures of each phase in the In–Zn–Se alloy was demonstrated because the material could be a candidate for optoelectronics. First, to determine whether the alloy satisfies direct or indirect transition and the bandgap energy, reflectance spectra were measured at room temperature as shown in Fig. 6(a). Oscillations observed in some specimens were attributed to the interference between the thin film and the substrate. By considering the reflection from the surface of the thin film and the film/substrate interface, the absorption coefficient α of a thin film with thickness t was extrapolated from the reflectance spectra as expressed in the following formula,19 (1)where R(E) is the reflection as a function of incident photon energy hν and Rmax and Rmin are the maximum and minimum values of reflection in the spectrum, respectively. Therefore, the relationship between the absorption coefficient extracted by reflectance spectra and the incident photon energy could be expressed as, α ∝ (hv − Eg)n(2)where n = 1/2 (n = 2) follows a direct (indirect) transition. In Fig. 6(b), the square and the square root of energy-dependent absorption coefficient were plotted. The linear behaviour of energy-dependent absorption coefficient was found and the respective bandgap energies of direct and indirect transitions were calculated according to the intercept of the x-axis.
 Fig. 6  (a) Reflectance spectra measured at room temperature for specimens with selected incorporation ratios. (b) Calculated absorption coefficients based on eqn (1) for direct (black curves) and indirect (grey curves) absorption processes. 
For the alloy with an indium incorporation ratio of less than 0.01, the direct interband transition dominates with a bandgap energy of 2.628 eV for binary ZnSe and 2.587 eV for the alloy with an incorporation ratio of less than 0.01. Once the supplied indium flux is large enough to hinder zinc incorporation, a secondary ZnIn2Se4 phase forms. In region (i) both a direct transition of 2.624 eV and an indirect transition of 1.662 eV were extrapolated and contributed to ZnSe and ZnIn2Se4, respectively. In comparison to the crystallographic measurements, ZnSe with a major amount dominates the optical transition. For region (iv), the direct transition energies from ZnSe are 2.569 and 2.610 eV, and the indirect transition occurs at 1.743 and 1.734 eV for indium incorporation ratios of 0.30 and 0.69, respectively. In this region, the dominant optical transition occurs from the ZnIn2Se4 phase instead. In particular, for the disordered region (iii), in which the contribution from ZnSe and ZnIn2Se4 is comparable, the determination of the electronic structure is more complicated. Moreover, absorption processes out of the wide mid-gap states are more pronounced in this disordered structure. These results indicate that the reflectance measurement alone is not enough for understanding the origin of optical transition. Hence photoluminescence measurements at various temperatures were performed as shown in Fig. 7.

The binary ZnSe reference film exhibits a clear and narrow near-band-edge emission, labelled as emission A, with a transition energy of 2.8 eV at 10 K as well as the negligible detection of deep-level emission. The temperature-dependent peak positions of the near-band-edge emission satisfy Varshini's description as shown in Fig. 7(b). As for the slight incorporation of indium in ZnSe, in which the crystallographic structure remains as pure ZnSe, an additional broad deep emission, labelled as emission B, occurs. It is obvious that the relative intensity from the near-band-edge emission is suppressed. Furthermore, once the indium incorporation ratio is large enough to generate phase separation, the near-band-edge emission of ZnSe is almost negligible. In region (ii), where the ZnSe structure still dominates, the main emission centred at about 2.18 eV was labelled as emission C. Although the peak positions of emissions B and C at low temperature are similar and close to the theoretically predicted energy position of zinc vacancies at about 0.7 eV above the valence band maximum,20 the respective temperature dependence is quite different as shown in Fig. 7(b). The temperature-dependent behaviour of emission B obeys Varshini's prediction similar to that of emission A, whereas the behaviour of emission C exhibits a clear red–blue–red shift with increasing temperature. The monotonic behaviour implies that emission B originates from the separated point defects of zinc vacancies. In addition, the phenomenon is similar to the previously reported yellow emission of indium-doped ZnSe.10 On the contrary, the red–blue–red feature of emission C, also known as the S-shape, is understood in terms of localised carrier transition via extended states in the forbidden gap induced by a high density of zinc vacancies. At low temperature, the preferred carrier recombination occurs at the shallower levels of mid-gap states. As the temperature increases, localised carriers gain sufficient thermal energy to transport to adjacent lower levels of the states and the red shift of luminescence takes place. The following blue shift starting at 60 K is a result of the promoted thermal population of higher-energy levels in the extended states. Finally, as the temperature exceeds 120 K, the coincidence of Varshini's prediction occurs, which indicates the delocalisation process of carriers.
For the specimen within region (iii) where the disordered structure dominates, the main emission D of 1.9 eV at 10 K exhibits a stronger localisation effect. The temperature where the second red shift starts is about 200 K, indicating that the localisation energy is about twice as large as that of emission C. We proposed that in the disordered mixture, the non-uniform distribution of zinc vacancies together with the phase interface between ZnSe and ZnIn2Se4 would strongly destroy the whole periodic stacking of lattice; thus the spreading of mid-gap localised states is enlarged. Consequently, in combination with the reflectance and the temperature-dependent PL, it is suggested that the mid-gap localised states dominate the electronic structure in the disordered alloy.
In addition, for specimens within region (iv) where the ZnIn2Se4 phase dominates, a broad emission E centred at about 1.6 eV was found in the 10 K spectrum and marked by grey star symbols in Fig. 7(a). Some sharp peaks were also observed on top of this broad peak, which was attributed to the emission from the GaAs substrate. Because of the indirect nature of ZnIn2Se4 as revealed in Fig. 6, the luminescence intensity from the thin film is relatively lower than that from the substrate. Moreover, the localisation effect is not apparent within region (iv). The authors suggested that because the zinc vacancy is a crucial part of creating the defect-chalcopyrite ZnIn2Se4 structure,15 the probability of alteration of the periodic ordering and the resultant mid-gap states is smaller.
Based on EXAFS and optical investigations, it could be summarised that zinc vacancies distributed in the ZnSe-based structure have more opportunities to alter the zinc blende lattice. The highest density of localised states occurs in region (iii) where the global structure is disordered and dominates the optical transition. In general, such a high density of mid-gap states would promote carrier occupation and lower the Fermi level position as reported in the AlGaN thin film.21 In order to confirm this assumption, the energy difference between the Fermi level and the top of the valence band was extrapolated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 8 for selected specimens within regions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), with a magnified inset which reveals the low binding energy portion. The binding energy in this measurement was calibrated by using a core level emission of 11 eV from the Zn 3d subshell.22 The energy positions of the Fermi level and the valence band maximum were determined at the zero-energy point and the linear intercept of the steep incline from the base line, respectively. As shown in the inset, the energy difference between the Fermi level and the valence band maximum decreases from 1.79 eV for region (i) to 1.41 eV for region (iii). Such a 0.38 eV reduction of the Fermi level position indicates the significant increased density of the localised state. In summary, the EXAFS, temperature-dependent PL, and XPS results provided that heavy indium incorporation would cause zinc vacancies in the alloy, which act as self-compensating centres based on the previous literature.9–11

Furthermore, special characteristics of the disordered mixture in the In–Zn–Se alloy were pointed out for indium incorporation ratios between 0.03 and 0.18 in this work. The nature of the amorphous-like structure shows advantages in fabrication processes. For instance, the limitation of the substrate could possibly be overcome in the future. In particular, the light absorption occurs widely in the visible range. On the basis of these features, the disordered In–Zn–Se alloy could be a potential candidate for intermediate-band optoelectronic devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the fundamental characteristics of the transition, including the stoichiometry, the crystallography and the electronic structures, in the MBE-grown In–Zn–Se alloy were demonstrated. During vapour-phase deposition, the large difference in vapour pressures between indium and zinc results in zinc deficiency in the solid state. Once the indium incorporation is large enough, the phase-separated alloy consists of the ZnSe structure with Zn vacancy and the defect-chalcopyrite ZnIn2Se4 structure is generated. The competition of these two phases results in crystallographic transition which starts from the pure ZnSe, followed by the ZnSe-rich, the amorphous-like mixture, the ZnIn2Se4-rich, and the pure In2Se3, in sequence. The separation between each phase and the corresponding strain was also determined by using the synchrotron radiation apparatus. In particular, the disordered mixture occurs as the indium incorporation ratio ranges from 0.03 to 0.18, in which the amount of the two phases is comparable. Under these conditions, widely distributed localised states induced by the high density of zinc vacancies are observed in the forbidden gap. These results show the potential for applying the II–III2–IV4 alloy to next-generation optoelectronics devices.
