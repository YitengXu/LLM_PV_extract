    , Accepted 23rd March 2018First published on 24th March 2018AbstractHerein, we report all solution-processed green quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (G-QLEDs) by introducing a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI, Nafion 117) into quantum dots (QDs) to improve hole injection. To reduce the energy level mismatch between the hole transporting layer (HTL) and QDs and exciton quenching on the metal–oxide surface, a PFI-mixed copper-doped nickel oxide (Cu-NiO) HTL was introduced for G-QLEDs. Mixing Cu-NiO with a PFI increases the work function and induces phase separation between Cu-NiO and PFI; thus, energy band bending occurs on the surface such that effective hole injection can be possible. The phase-separated PFI molecules on HTL affect the thickness and compactness of G-QDs and make a smooth interface between G-QDs and HTL. The G-QLED with a PFI and Cu-NiO mixture HTL exhibits the maximum current efficiency (CEmax), power efficiency (PEmax), and external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 7.3 cd A−1, 2.1 lm W−1, and 2.14%, respectively, which are about 4 times those of the QLED with a Cu-NiO HTL.
Introduction
Quantum-dot (QD) LEDs (QLEDs) are one of the candidates for next-generation displays because of their advantages such as high color purity, low-cost process using a solution, and easier color tuning with the same material.1–3 Therefore, QDs can be used for various applications such as in color-conversion films for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and micro light-emitting diodes (μ-LEDs) and solar cells.4–6 Especially, QDs could be more stable to oxygen and vapor exposure than organic materials due to their inorganic structures such as cadmium selenide (CdSe), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and indium phosphide (InP).
Generally, QLEDs are fabricated by a hybrid process by combining spin-coating and thermal evaporation for highly efficient devices.7–9 A small molecule hole-transport or electron transport layer (HTL or ETL) is deposited on top of a QD emissive layer (EML) by thermal evaporation. However, organic semiconductors can be easily oxidized by exposing them to oxygen and vapor. Oxidation of an organic semiconductor degrades its device performance and lifetime. Therefore, metal oxides could be useful for fabricating stable devices. Moreover, a metal–oxide semiconductor has advantages such as high carrier mobility and solution processability.10,11 It is therefore noted that solution-processed metal–oxide can be a good candidate for a stable QLED with low manufacturing cost.
All inorganic QLED was first reported by M. G. Bawendi in 2008 using metal oxides by sputtering.12 Nickel oxide (NiO) and zinc oxide-doped tin oxide (ZnO:SnO2) were sputter-deposited for p-type and n-type semiconductors, respectively. The maximum luminance and external quantum efficiency (Lmax and EQEmax) were 1950 cd m−2 and 0.1%, respectively. The best inorganic device reported to date exhibits an Lmax of 20000 cd m−2 and a maximum current efficiency (CEmax) of 20.5 cd A−1, obtained using an ultrasonic spray process.13
One of the issues for high efficiency inorganic QLEDs is the large band offset between the metal–oxide HTL and QD EML that is due to the difference between the valence band maximum (VBM) (5.8–6.2 eV) of QD and that of metal–oxide hole injection/transport layer (HIL/HTL) (5.2–5.4 eV), for example 5.2 eV for NiO, 5.2 eV for MoOx, and 5.4 eV for CuO. This hinders hole transport into the QD layer and leads to the imbalance of charges in QDs. Moreover, the hydroxyl (O–H) bond is a well-known exciton quencher and can be generated during the metal–oxide sol–gel process.14 Another issue is the mixing and washing out of the QD EML during the solution processing of the upper layer on QDs. This inter-mixing can induce high leakage currents in QLEDs.15
In various methods used to reduce the energy barrier, an ultra-thin polymer coating is introduced using polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) or a perfluorinated ionomer (PFI, called Nafion). Introduction of PEIE at the interface can decrease the work function (WF).16,17 PEIE is introduced into an inverted QLED to match the energy levels between the VBM of QDs and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the HTL.18 However, there is an issue that a thin PEIE has a poor thermal stability at >130 °C; this limits the maximum process temperature of device fabrication.16,19
Generally, PFI is introduced for self-organization with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).20 The mixture of PFI with PEDOT:PSS increases the WF from 5.2 eV to 5.95 eV due to the self-organized CF2 on the surface. Moreover, the PFI-doped PEDOT:PSS HIL increases the operating lifetime of the polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) due to the reduced sulfonic acid concentration on the surface.
In this study, we investigated all solution-processed green QLEDs (G-QLEDs) by spin coating. The G-QLED exhibits the CEmax, maximum power efficiency (PEmax), and EQEmax of 7.3 cd A−1, 2.1 lm W−1, and 2.14%, respectively. To reduce the large band offset between Cu-NiO HTL and QDs, PFI is introduced to increase the WF by doping Cu-NiO, and the optimum PFI blending ratio in Cu-NiO is found to be 0.33. PFI doping induces phase-separation between the oxide and polymer; thus, energy band bending occurs on the metal oxide surface. The phase-separated HTL increases the hydrophobicity of the metal oxide by fluorine incorporation into the surface; this affects the layer thickness and compactness of G-QDs. The incorporation of PFI could be confirmed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) depth profile, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile, contact angle, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and photoluminescence (PL) intensity measurements. The current and power efficiencies of G-QLED increase 4 times upon introducing PFI into Cu-NiO HTL.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows (a) the molecular structure of PFI and (b–d) the effect of PFI blending in Cu-NiO on the film thickness and optical absorption. The concentration of Cu-NiO was fixed at 0.4 M, and the PFI volume was controlled from 1:0 (Cu-NiO:PFI, vol%:vol%) to 1:1, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Fig. 1(b) shows the optical band gap, and Fig. 1(c) shows the optical absorptions of a 180 nm Cu-NiO:PFI layer. The thickness of the Cu-NiO:PFI layer increases gradually from 55 to 75 nm with an increase in the PFI blending ratio, as shown in Fig. 1(d), and this can be explained as an anodizing effect.24,25 NiF2 can be formed on the nickel surface using NH4F and H3PO4 electrolyte by the anodizing effect. An electrolytic passivation process is used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer.26 The band gap of Cu-NiO increases from 3.37 eV to 3.60 eV with an increase in the PFI blending ratio.

(a) Molecular structure of PFI and (b) optical band gap, (c) Tauc's plot, and (d) thickness of the Cu-NiO:PFI films. The thickness and band gap of Cu-NiO increase with the increasing PFI blending ratio. Note that the Cu concentration in NiO is 5 at%. 
Exciton quenching at the HTL/QD interface should be minimized for high-efficiency LEDs. Exciton quenching by defect and trap sites can be confirmed from PL and time-resolved PL (TRPL) results.14Fig. 2 shows the PL characteristics of G-QDs on various under layers. Fig. 2(a)–(e) show the PL images obtained from QDs under 365 nm UV illumination, and the clear PL image can be seen in Fig. 2(e). G-QDs were deposited on glass, ITO, HIL, and Cu-NiO. Fig. 2(f) shows that the PL intensity drops by 50% on the Cu-NiO HTL (a deep green symbol). Note that the PL intensity obtained from the QDs on Cu-NiO is higher than that of G-QDs on Li-CuO (a light green symbol). However, as shown by the blue symbol in Fig. 2(f), the PL intensity of G-QDs on Cu-NiO increases significantly with PFI blending. We varied the blending ratio from 1:1 to 1:0.2 vol%, and the optimized blending ratio was found to be 1:0.33 vol%. The recovery of PL intensity is correlated with the TRPL results. This may be related to the O–H bonds on the metal–oxide surface or the QD thickness, which can be changed by PFI blending.27

PL images of G-QDs under 365 nm UV illumination on (a) glass, (b) ITO/glass, (c) Li:CuO/ITO/glass, (d) Cu:NiO/Li:CuO/ITO/glass, and (e) Cu:NiO + PFI/Li:CuO/ITO/glass. (f) PL intensities of the G-QD layers on various substrates. The PL intensity drops by 50% (green symbol) by Cu:NiO coating on ITO, but it becomes similar to that of the QD on glass when PFI is blended with the Cu-NiO layer (blue symbol). 

Fig. 3 shows the contact angles on the Cu-NiO:PFI HTL. DI water was dropped on the top of a Cu-NiO:PFI layer, as shown in Fig. 3(a–d). The contact angle increases from 17.8° to 69.2° with an increase in the PFI blending ratio. Note that 33 vol% PFI in Cu-NiO (1:0.33 vol%) shows 66.9° contact angle, as shown in Fig. 3(e). It is around 69.2° when the PFI concentration is higher than 33 vol%. More detailed wetting energy, work of adhesion, and spreading coefficient are summarized in Table 1. The decrease in wetting energy and work of adhesion and the increase in contact angle appear to be related to the QD layer thickness.28 It is predicted that mixing of Cu-NiO with PFI may increase the QD layer thickness; therefore, PL intensity of G-QDs on PFI-doped Cu-NiO is similar to that of G-QDs on glass, as shown in Fig. 2(f). The evidence can be confirmed from the TEM and EDS results.

Surface analysis was performed by XPS measurement, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a, b, c, d, and e) exhibit the XPS intensities of the Ni 2p, O 1s, Cu 2p, C 1s, and F 1s core levels, respectively. It is confirmed that Cu does not exist on the Cu-NiO surface. More detailed compositions on the surface are summarized in Table 2. C–F, C–F2, and CF3 exist on the Cu-NiO surface, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and (e), which well-match with the molecular structure of PFI shown in Fig. 1(a). To support the existence of PFI on the Cu-NiO surface, the XPS depth profile of the 3 kinds of samples with varying PFI blending ratio from 1:0.1 to 1:1 vol% (Cu-NiO:PFI) were measured, as shown in Fig. S2.† Note that C atoms are found on the sample surfaces, as shown in Fig. S2(a).† The existence of PFI on the Cu-NiO surface can also be supported by the existence of the F 1s core level, as shown in Fig. S2(b).† The concentration of C–F2 increases with the PFI blending ratio, but the NiF2 concentration remains constant. The concentration of C–F2 increases from 6 to 12% in C bonds and that of CF2 increases from 32 to 68% as the PFI blending ratio increases, as shown in Fig. S3.† Cu can be found at 10 nm depth and not on the surface (shown in Fig. S2(c)†), and it is noted that the ratio of CuO to Cu2O remains ∼30:70. The O–H, Vo, and O–M bindings are summarized in Fig. S2(d),† and the intensity ratio between O–H, Vo, and O–M is 44:36:20, as shown in Fig. S3(c).† The XPS results for Cu 2p, Ni 2p, and O 1s core levels are the same as those for Cu-NiO, even with PFI blending. Therefore, the recovered PL intensity of G-QDs with PFI mixture may not be related to O–H bonds on the metal oxide surface. However, the anodizing effect and insulating PFI mixture can affect the device performance.

Fig. 5 exhibits the UPS spectra of PFI-doped Cu-NiO with depth profile and the energy level diagram of all solution G-QLED. To check the change in the VBM in Cu-NiO:PFI with depth, UPS spectra were obtained after Ar etching on the surface. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the He(I) UPS spectra of the secondary-electron cut-off and the Fermi-edge region of Cu-NiO:PFI on the ITO substrate, changing from 4.50 to 3.99 eV and from 1.30 to 0.45 eV, respectively, as the Ar etching time varies from 0 (black line) to 1 min (red line). After 1 min Ar etching, it is found that ΔVBMs are almost unchanged at around 0.42 eV (from blue to green symbols). According to the UPS spectra with Ar etching time, we concluded that the phase-separated PFI layer in the mixed Cu-NiO:PFI induced energy band bending on the Cu-NiO HTL surface, which was consistent with previous studies.29,30 The UPS spectra of other PFI blending ratios in Cu-NiO (1:0.1 and 1:1 vol%) (see Fig. S4†) show that PFI blending causes significant VBM bending. The tendency with PFI doping in Cu-NiO is similar, as shown in Fig. S4(a–d).† The optical band gaps of Cu-NiO:PFI obtained by the Tauc's plot are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), and the energy band diagram and energy level of doped Cu-NiO are shown in Fig. 5(d) and Table 3, respectively. In our previous study,21 the VBM and CBM of Cu-NiO on the ITO substrate were calculated to be 5.25 eV and 1.88 eV, respectively. Therefore, it is confirmed that a small amount of PFI (10 vol%) can effect VBM bending from 5.25 to 5.58 eV.

TEM images of the QLEDs were obtained, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a–c) and (d–f) exhibit the cross-sectional TEM images of Cu-NiO HTL- and Cu-NiO:PFI HTL-based all solution-processed G-QLEDs, respectively. Fig. 6(a) and (d) show that the Li-CuO HIL thickness is ∼10 nm on ITO for both QLEDs, and clear interface between G-QDs and HTL can be seen only for the Cu-NiO HTL-based G-QLED (see Fig. 6(b)). However, Fig. 6(e) shows that the clear interface disappears with PFI doping in Cu-NiO; this is due to the change to a smooth interface. A thicker G-QDs layer is formed on Cu-NiO:PFI HTL (as shown in Fig. 6(e)), and its thicknesses in G-QLEDs with Cu-NiO HTL and Cu-NiO:PFI HTL are found to be ∼22 nm and ∼30 nm, respectively. These results support our previous results on recovered G-QD PL intensity by PFI doping (Fig. 2). According to the TEM results, the G-QDs layers have 2.0–2.5 and 3.0–3.5 multi-layers (MLs) on Cu-NiO HTL and Cu-NiO:PFI HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(c) and (f).

It is noted that the average diameter of G-QDs is 9–11 nm. 
Layer formation by PFI doping in Cu-NiO can be seen in Fig. 7 obtained from the EDS data. Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, F, and O are used to trace the depth profiles of LZO, G-QDs, Cu-NiO, PFI, and Li-CuO.
 Fig. 7  EDS data of (a) Cu-NiO HTL and (b) Cu-NiO:PFI HTL-based all-solution processed G-QLEDs obtained from the TEM results. The Zn, Cd, Ni, Cu, F, and O atoms are selected to identify the LZO, G-QDs, Cu-NiO, PFI, and Li-CuO layers. 
The infiltration of LZO into QDs can be confirmed by the coexistence of Zn, O, and Cd, and this is due to sol–gel-processed LZO on QDs. The thickness of LZO used for ETL is estimated to be ∼5 nm because of mixing with G-QDs, and it is confirmed that F diffuses through all layers during the annealing process. The XPS results of the Cu-NiO:PFI layer on glass indicate that PFI exists on the Cu-NiO surface (Fig. 4 and Fig. S2†), but it is mainly distributed in Cu-NiO:PFI, as shown in Fig. 7(b). F diffusion can affect the top layer thickness via the hydrophobic property of fluorine. As shown in Fig. S2 and S3,† it is confirmed that F, C, and O atoms exist on the Cu-NiO:PFI surface, whereas Cu atoms cannot be found on the surface. F atoms exist on the Cu-NiO:PFI surface at all levels of PFI blending.
The distribution of Cu also depends on fluorine. The XPS results with depth profile show that Cu diffuses gradually to the bottom of Cu-NiO:PFI HTL by phase-separation from fluorine (Fig. S2†), and the Cu profile can be seen from XPS results, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Cu exists almost uniformly throughout the Cu-NiO HTL (Fig. 7(a)), but it diffuses to the bottom when PFI is doped into Cu-NiO (Fig. 7(b)). Since the CuO layer is formed below NiO, there should be a large concentration of Cu atoms at the interlayer between NiO and ITO. Moreover, it is found that the concentration of F decreases gradually and the Cu concentration increases sharply closer to the ITO side. Through the analysis of the XPS depth profile, we confirm that NF2, C–Fx, and M–O bonds exist only on the surface of the Cu-NiO:PFI HTL (see Fig. 4, S2 and S3†), and F atoms exist on the surface of the Cu-NiO:PFI thin-film (see Fig. 4) and also in the QD and LZO layers. The F atoms appear to diffuse into the QD and LZO layers during the process of QLED fabrication (Fig. 7).

Fig. 8 shows the device performance of all solution-processed G-QLEDs with PFI-doped Cu-NiO HTL. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the current density and luminance characteristics as functions of voltage and power and current efficiencies as functions of luminance, respectively. The current density of G-QLEDs for the PFI/Cu-NiO mixture (red symbol) decreases due to the insulating property of PFI; however, both current and power efficiencies increase 3 fold. The increase in CE may be due to charge balance, and this is supported by the PL intensity curves shown in Fig. 2(f) and 8(b). Generally, PE decreases with the increasing bias voltage.31 However, it was shown that the PE of G-QLEDs with the PFI-doped Cu-NiO HTL was much higher than that of QLED with the Cu-NiO HTL. Therefore, the PFI-doped Cu-NiO HTL seems to improve hole injection to the VBM of QDsand results in charge balance in the QLEDs. To support charge balance in the QD layer with the Cu-NiO:PFI HTL, the electroluminescence (EL) spectra are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d). G-QLEDs with a Cu-NiO HTL show broad EL spectra with an FWHM of 54 nm, and this seems to originate from color mixing between G-QLED EL and Cu-NiO defect emissions.32 On the other hand, G-QLEDs with Cu-NiO:PFI HTL exhibit EL spectra with a narrow FWHM of 24 nm. This results from the formation of perfect exciton recombination within G-QDs. Therefore, the G-QLEDs with a Cu-NiO:PFI HTL show much higher EQE and deep green CIE coordinates than G-QLEDs with a Cu-NiO HTL, as shown in Fig. 8(e) and (f). More detailed G-QLED performances are summarized in Table 4.

Although QLED performance is improved with PFI doping in Cu-NiO HTL, it shows a higher turn-on voltage, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The high turn-on voltage appears to originate from the charge imbalance in the QD EML induced by the mobility difference between Cu-NiO and LZO and/or higher resistivity of Cu-NiO due to F mixing. Note that the mobility of p-type oxide is generally much lower than that of the n-type oxide semiconductor.33,34 Moreover, note that PFI doping can increase the resistivity of the thin film.35 Decrease in the conductivity in PEDOT:PSS by the PFI mixture is reported by Yeoh et al.35 It can be expected that F incorporation into Cu-NiO decreases the conductivity because F bonding is strong and thus reduces the carrier concentration in Cu-NiO.
By PFI doping in Cu-NiO HTL, the leakage current of the QLED decreases by one order of magnitude at −5 V (10−1 mA cm−2 for QLED with Cu-NiO HTL and 10−2 mA cm−2 for the QLED with PFI-doped Cu-NiO HTL). Reduction of leakage current appears to be due to the reduction of defect states at the interface. However, our QLEDs show a relatively high leakage current as compared to QLED using vacuum-processed HTLs. The layer inter-mixing during the solution process (see Fig. S5†) can increase the leakage current. The LZO sol–gel process on the QD layer induces intermixing, as shown in EDS results (Fig. 7). To overcome this intermixing, more studies should be conducted, for example, using nanoparticle (NP) HTL deposition, which can be performed at lower temperatures.
We fabricated all solution-processed G-QLED with varying PFI blending ratios in Cu-NiO HTLs, as shown in Fig. S6.† The optimum ratio between Cu-NiO and PFI is 1.00:0.33 vol%. The other G-QLEDs exhibit poor color purity with a broad FWHM, as shown in Fig. S6(c–f).† All solution-processed G-QLEDs fabricated under the optimum condition exhibit the CEmax of 7.3 cd A−1 and PEmax of 2.3 lm W−1. Table 5 summarizes the device performances of all solution-processed QLEDs reported in literature. Inorganic QLEDs obtained using sputtered metal–oxides show better performances than those obtained via solution process.12,13,36–42 However, our QLED with the solution-processed metal oxide HIL/HTL shows highest efficiency reported to date.

Conclusions
We developed all solution-processed G-QLED using PFI mixed with Cu-NiO for efficient hole transport. The optical band-gap of Cu-NiO increases from 3.37 to 3.60 eV with PFI doping. The existence of PFI is confirmed on the surface of Cu-NiO by XPS and thus increases its surface hydrophobicity, which is confirmed by the contact angle. VBM bending at the Cu-NiO and QD interface is confirmed by the UPS depth profile. It is confirmed that F atoms in PFI affect the top layer thickness by phase separation, and it makes a thicker G-QD layer. Moreover, the interface between G-QDs and HTL becomes smoother with PFI doping in Cu-NiO, and it increases the hole injection ability from HTL to QDs. The optimum blending ratio between Cu-NiO and PFI is 1.00:0.33 vol%. G-QLED using the optimum PFI exhibits the CEmax of 7.3 cd A−1 and PEmax of 2.3 lm W−1 with an FWHM of 24 nm. All solution-processed QLED developed in this study exhibits the EQEmax of 2.14%, which is the highest value reported to date.
Experimental
QD materials
The TEM top-view and optical properties of G-QDs used in this study can be seen in Fig. S1(a) and S1(b),† respectively. G-QDs with an average diameter of 9–11 nm were used. G-QDs dissolved in toluene at 10 mg mL−1 concentration have an absorption peak at 515 nm and PL peak at 525 nm, as shown in Fig. S1.† The G-QDs supplied from Nanosquare., Inc., CdSe/CdS/ZnS, show the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 23 nm and have a conduction band minimum (CBM) and VBM energy levels of 3.8 and 6.1 eV, respectively.
Synthesis of Cu-NiO
Copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(CO2CH3)2·H2O), nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O), monoethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH, MEA), and 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2, 2-ME) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The doping concentration of Cu in NiO was fixed at 5 at%.21 Ni precursor (1.493 g) and 0.063 g of Cu precursor were injected into a three-necked flask, and the mixed precursor was dissolved in 2-ME solvent. Subsequently, MEA was injected into the solution to obtain a stable Cu-NiO complex.22,23 Finally, a 5 at% Cu-NiO solution was refluxed at 60 °C for 9 h at a stirring speed of 300 rpm until a greenish transparent solution was obtained.
Synthesis of Cu-NiO:PFI
A perfluorinated ionomer (PFI, Nafion 117 solution) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The PFI solution was blended into Cu-NiO with varying PFI volume ratios. The blending ratio of Cu-NiO:PFI was between 1:0 and 1:1 (vol%). The Cu-NiO:PFI solution was stirred at 300 rpm for 2 h and filtered using 0.45 μm PVDF.
Fabrication of G-QLEDs
A 10 nm, 20 at% Li-doped CuO (Li-CuO) layer was used as an HIL formed by spin coating at 4000 rpm onto the ITO substrate with a sheet resistance of 8–10 Ω sq−1 and then annealed at 300 °C for 30 min in ambient air. Additionally, the air-annealed Li-CuO thin-film was treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. Subsequently, the 30 nm Cu-NiO or Cu-NiO:PFI layer was formed onto the Li-CuO layer as an HTL and then annealed at 300 °C for 30 min in ambient air. The G-QDs were spin-coated at 2000 rpm and then annealed at 190 °C for 10 min in a N2 filled glove box for EML. Then, a 30 nm thick 10 at% Li-doped ZnO (LZO) was formed by spin coating for ETL and then annealed at 160 °C for 10 min in a N2 filled glove box. Then, a 100 nm Al layer was evaporated onto the top as a cathode under vacuum (1 × 10−7 Torr). Finally, the G-QLEDs were encapsulated with glass in a N2 filled glove box.
Characterization and instrumentation
An Agilent 4156C semiconductor parameter analyzer was used to monitor the electrical characteristics of the QLEDs. The absorbance and PL of Cu-NiO:PFI and QDs were measured using a Scinco S-4100 UV-visible spectrophotometer and Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer, respectively. XPS results of Cu-NiO:PFI films were obtained using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (ULVAC PHI, Japan). UPS results of ITO/Cu-NiO:PFI layers were obtained using Ulvac-PHI (Japan). TEM images with EDS of green QDs and all inoragnic G-QLEDs were obtained using FEI Titan™ 80–300 operated at an accelerating voltage of 80–300 kV. The contact angle data of DI droplets on Cu-NiO:PFI thin films were obtained using Phoenix 600. The current density–voltage (J–V), luminance–voltage (L–V), EL spectra, and EQE characteristics were measured using a Konica Minolta CS100A luminance meter and a CS2000A spectrometer coupled with a Keithley 2635A voltage and current source meter.
