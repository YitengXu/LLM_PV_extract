    , Accepted 27th October 2021First published on 27th October 2021AbstractTiO2-based nanosheet materials with a core–shell structure are expected to be one of the promising photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollution. It is a challenge to synthesize TiO2 by the desired nucleation and growth process, so most reported TiO2 core–shell photocatalysts are prepared using TiO2 as a core material. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are considered ideal platforms to grow TiO2in situ and further serve as additional components to improve the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. In this work, we report the design and fabrication of anatase TiO2-coated ZnAl-layered double oxide (LDO@TiO2) nanosheets, which involve the in situ growth of TiO2 on ZnAl-LDH followed by subsequent calcination treatment. The resulting LDO@TiO2 photocatalyst yields typical core–shell nanosheet morphology with a mesoporous structure, exhibiting excellent photodegradation and mineralization efficiency for organic pollution.
1. Introduction
Photodegradation is a promising technology to remove organic pollutants from wastewater, which can directly utilize solar energy to mineralize pollutants (e.g., dyes, antibiotics and aromatic compounds) into CO2 and H2O.1–7 Photocatalysts play a key role in the photodegradation process, and many semiconductors (e.g., TiO2,8 α-Fe2O3,9 WO310 and BiVO411) have been studied as photocatalysts for photodegradation. Because of its excellent stability and catalytic activity, TiO2 is expected to be one of the promising photocatalysts. In recent years, TiO2 materials in forms such as nanosheets,12 nanorods,13 nanotubes14 and microspheres15 with control of crystallinity and exposed facets have been reported. The nanostructured TiO2 materials present efficient active sites and large surface area, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance.16–18 However, the inherent low electron mobility and short hole diffusion length of TiO2 bring about intense charge recombination, and hinder the photocatalytic activity.
The photodegradation process involves the generation and separation of charge carriers and the subsequent redox reactions of pollutants.19–23 To enhance the photocatalytic degradation performance of TiO2, it is efficient to fabricate TiO2-based composite photocatalysts. For example, building a TiO2/NiO heterojunction can enhance the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs,24 and introducing graphene oxide to TiO2 facilitates the generation of ˙O2− and ˙OH radicals, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity towards organic pollution.25 Among the composite photocatalysts, core–shell-structured materials attract lots of attention as they usually possess highly distinctive physical and chemical properties in the integrated system. For instance, TiO2@Bi2WxMo1−xO6 core–shell nanofibers can boost visible light absorption and reduce charge recombination rate, exhibiting good photocatalytic activity towards tetracycline hydrochloride,26 while CoTiO3 coated nanosheets-assembled TiO2 nanospheres can promote the photodegradation of antibiotics due to the enhanced charge separation efficiency and mass transfer.27 However, the reported TiO2-based core–shell photocatalysts mostly use TiO2 as a shell material, which is disadvantageous for the exposure of the catalytic activity sites of TiO2. In addition, nanosheet photocatalysts are recognized as ideal structures to reduce the charge migration distance and further suppress charge recombination.28–30 Therefore, it is attractive to fabricate TiO2-based core–shell nanosheet materials, especially TiO2 as shell-materials with enhanced photocatalytic performance. However, it is a challenge to synthesise a TiO2 shell on functional core materials by the desired nucleation and growth process.
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are typical two-dimensional cationic clays with the general formula [MII1−xMIIIx(OH)2]x+·(An−x/n)·mH2O, where MII and MIII are bivalent and trivalent metal cations, respectively, and An− denotes interlayer anions (CO32−, Cl−, SO42−, etc.). The structure of MIIMIII-LDHs is orderly formed by a positively charged metal layer [MII1−xMIIIx(OH)2] and interlayer anions for charge compensation.31–33 The unsaturated coordination state of the surface of LDHs is advantageous for the nucleation and growth of extrinsic components.34–37 The hydroxyl group in the metal layer can provide reaction sites for the hydrolysis of titanium precursors. After calcination of LDHs, the obtained layered double oxides (LDOs) are composite of mixed metal oxides and can be considered as a new type of semiconductor material. For example, ZnAl-LDO and NiTi-LDO have been reported as excellent photocatalysts.38,39 Therefore, nanosheets of LDHs are promising platforms for in situ growth of TiO2 and further serve as additional components to construct a heterojunction or other functional materials to improve the separation of photo-generated charge carriers.
Herein, we report the design and fabrication of anatase TiO2-coated ZnAl-LDO (LDO@TiO2) nanosheets, which involves the in situ growth of TiO2 on ZnAl-LDH, followed by a subsequent calcination treatment. The resulting LDO@TiO2 photocatalyst gives typical core–shell nanosheet morphology with a mesoporous structure. The ZnAl-LDO core material consists of zincite ZnO and amorphous Al2O3, and the TiO2 shell material is anatase TiO2. The ZnAl-LDO/TiO2 heterojunction in the core/shell interface facilitates charge separation and further promotes the photodegradation of dyes. Consequently, LDO@TiO2 photocatalysts exhibit excellent photodegradation and mineralization efficiency for organic dyes. This work provides an elaborate strategy for the preparation of TiO2 nanosheet heterojunction materials using LDHs as a platform, which has potential applications in the field of photocatalysis.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
ZnCl2, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, tetrabutyl titanate [Ti(OBu)4], urea, ethanol, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxidewere (DMPO), Na2SO4, rutile TiO2 were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. P25 TiO2 was purchased from Aeroxide Degussa, Germany. The water used in all experiments was purified through a Millipore system.
2.2 Preparation of ZnAl-LDH and ZnAl-LDO
ZnAl-LDH was prepared in a three-neck flask equipped with a reflux condenser under nitrogen flow.40 Typically, ZnCl2 (4 mmol), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (2 mmol) and urea (14 mmol) were dissolved in 400 mL of deionized water. The solution was then heated at 97 °C under reflux and continuously stirred for 24 h. The resulting product was washed with ethanol several times and finally dried in air.
The as-prepared ZnAl-LDH was placed in a ceramic boat and transferred to a muffle furnace. ZnAl-LDO-T (T = 200, 400, 600, 800 °C) were obtained with calcination temperatures at 200, 400, 600, 800 °C, respectively, in the air for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. ZnAl-LDO-600 was abbreviated as ZnAl-LDO.
2.3 Preparation of LDH@TiO2 and LDO@TiO2
LDH@TiO2 was synthesized using a solvothermal method. Typically, 1.2 g ZnAl-LDH was dispersed in 25 mL of 99.5% ethanol solution, and then 0.4 mL Ti(OBu)4 was added to the above solution under magnetic stirring at room temperature. Then, the solutions were aged in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 100 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the LDH@TiO2 samples were washed several times with deionized water and finally dried in air. For the preparation of LDH@TiO2-L and LDH@TiO2-H, 0.2 mL and 0.6 mL Ti(OBu)4 were added into the ethanol solution. The other processes were performed by the same method of LDH@TiO2.
LDO@TiO2-T was obtained by calcining LDH@TiO2 under the same calcination process as that of ZnAl-LDO. LDO@TiO2-600 was abbreviated as LDO@TiO2.
2.4 Characterization
The morphology was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi, S-4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan step of 10° min−1. Thermogravimetric (TG) curves were collected on a STA449F3/TENSOR27 TG/DTA instrument under N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo VG Escalab 250 with Al Kα X-rays as the excitation source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using a Philips Tecnai 20 and JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. X-ray spectrometry (EDS) elemental mapping was performed using a probe focused to 0.2 nm. The specific surface area, pore volume and size analysis were calculated using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, respectively, from the data collected on a Kubo-X1000 analyzer. Solid UV–Vis diffuse reflection spectra and UV–Vis absorption spectra were performed using an Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an RF-5301PC fluorospectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence spectra were recorded on an Edinburgh Instruments FL 900 fluorimeter with excitation and detection wavelength at 300 nm and 450 nm. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data were collected on a Bruker E500 EPR spectrometer at room temperature with a 300 W Xe lamp as the illuminant. Total organic carbon (TOC) was determined using TOC-L (Shimadzu, Japan).
2.5 Photocatalytic degradation experiments
Methylene blue (MB, cationic dye) and acid orange (AO, anion dye) were used as representative organic pollutants to investigate the photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples. The illumination source was a 150 W Xe lamp under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The degradation experiments were carried out using a homemade 250 mL glass reactor. The photocatalyst (50 mg) was first dispersed to 100 mL aqueous solution MB (10 mg L−1) or AO (25 mg L−1). The suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 40 min to ensure adsorption–desorption equilibrium. Then, irradiation was carried out, and this point was recorded as the initiation time. At certain time intervals, 4 mL of the suspension was removed and filtered using a 0.22 μm filter for analysis. The concentration of MB (or AO) was analyzed by measuring the absorbance at the maximum wavelength of 664 nm (484 nm) using a UV–vis spectrophotometer. The degradation or TOC removal ratios were calculated according to the equation: (C0 − Ct)/C0 × 100% or (TOC0 − TOCt)/TOC0 × 100%, where C0 and TOC0 are the initial concentrations of dyes; Ct and TOCt are concentrations of dyes at the reaction time. The pH of MB and AO solutions were adjusted to 4, 7 and 10 by adding 0.1 M HCl or NaOH.
EPR measurements were performed in aqueous solution to simulate the practical photodegradation environment. DMPO was used as a radical scavenger. 1 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst, 50 μL DMPO were dispersed in 1 mL H2O to form a homogeneous suspension. Then, ∼20 μL of the suspension was immediately transferred to the EPR capillary tube. Finally, the EPR data were collected at room temperature after 0-, 2- and 5 min irradiation.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical measurements
A homogeneous suspension was prepared by dispersing 10 mg of the as-prepared photocatalyst in 2 mL ethanol. Then, 50 μL of the suspension was dip-coated on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (2 cm × 2 cm) followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 2 h. Photocurrent measurements were conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution with a conventional three-electrode cell. The illumination source was a 150 W Xe lamp under AM 1.5G simulated solar irradiation with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. The as-obtained ZnAl-LDO and LDO@TiO2 working electrodes were immersed in the electrolyte. The Pt wire as a counter electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode were installed in the quartz cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Materials preparation and characterization
The preparation process of TiO2 coated ZnAl-LDO (LDO@TiO2) core–shell nanosheets is illustrated in Fig. 1a, which involves the in situ growth of TiO2 on ZnAl-LDH nanosheets, followed by a subsequent calcination process. ZnAl-LDH nanosheets were first prepared by a reported hydrothermal process, and it presents typical hexagonal platelets with a thickness of 100–200 nm and diameter of 2–5 μm (Fig. 1b). Then, amorphous TiO2 was in situ grown on the surface of ZnAl-LDH nanosheets by the controlled hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate [Ti(OBu)4]. The thickness of TiO2 coated on ZnAl-LDH nanosheets (LDH@TiO2) increases to 150–250 nm after the growth of the TiO2 shell (Fig. 1c). Finally, LDO@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets were obtained after the calcination process at 600 °C, which inherits the morphology of LDH@TiO2 (Fig. 1d). In addition, ZnAl-LDO sample was prepared for a comparison study by calcining ZnAl-LDH under the same conditions, which also showed a lamellar morphology (Fig. S1†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration for the preparation process of LDO@TiO2. SEM images of (b) ZnAl-LDH, (c) LDH@TiO2 and (d) LDO@TiO2. 
The phase structure of ZnAl-LDH, LDH@TiO2 and their derived calcined samples ZnAl-LDO, LDO@TiO2 were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 2a, ZnAl-LDH displays typical (003), (006), (009) peaks at 12.2°, 24.3°, 36.0°, respectively. No added reflections were observed in LDH@TiO2, indicating the amorphous phase of TiO2 shell. ZnAl-LDO showed a series of new reflections at 31.8°, 34.4° and 36.3° corresponding to (100), (002) and (101) planes of zincite ZnO (JCPDS no. 36-1451). The absence of Al2O3 peaks demonstrates that ZnAl-LDO is composed of zincite ZnO and amorphous Al2O3, which is consistent with the previous report.41 It is worth mentioning that the amorphous Al2O3 can enhance the structural stability of LDO nanosheets. For LDO@TiO2, the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 at 25.3° (JCPDS no. 21-1272) and peaks of ZnAl-LDO can be observed in the XRD pattern. The superimposition of ZnO and TiO2 phases in LDO@TiO2 demonstrate the effective combination of ZnAl-LDO and anatase TiO2. Furthermore, the effect of calcination temperature on the phase evolution of ZnAl-LDH and LDH@TiO2 was investigated. Thermogravimetric (TG) curves show that ZnAl-LDH presents three weight loss stages (Fig. 2b). The first step (20–220 °C) has a ∼13.5% weight loss corresponding to the removal of crystal water and the interlayer water. The second weight loss was ∼13.6% (220–350 °C), which can be ascribed to the dehydroxylation of the hydroxide layers and decomposition of the interlayer anions. The third step (weight loss ∼4.2% at 350–850 °C) is attributed to the dehydroxylation of the rest of the hydroxide layers.42 LDH@TiO2 also displays three weight loss stages as ZnAl-LDH. Because the phase conversion process of TiO2 has less weight loss during the heating process,43 the three-step weight losses of LDH@TiO2 were only ∼12.3% (20–220 °C), ∼8.5% (220–350 °C) and ∼2.6% (350–850 °C). The XRD patterns of the LDO@TiO2 sample at four calcination temperatures (denoted as LDO@TiO2-T; T is the temperature) confirmed the results of TG. As shown in Fig. 2c, LDO@TiO2-200 displays week peaks of LDH, indicating the maintenance of the lamellar structure of LDH. The (003) reflection of LDH at 12.2° disappears accompanied by the appearance of the (002) facet of zincite ZnO at 34.4° in LDO@TiO2-400, indicating dehydroxylation of the hydroxide layers. The peaks of ZnO and anatase TiO2 were both observed in LDO@TiO2-600 (denoted as LDO@TiO2). The (112), (103), (224) planes of Zn2TiO4 (JCPDS no. 19-1483) and (220) (311) planes of ZnAl2O4 (JCPDS no. 05-0669) were observed in LDO@TiO2-800, suggesting that TiO2, ZnO and Al2O3 converted to cubic spinel phase (Zn2TiO4 and ZnAl2O4). ZnAl-LDO-T samples show similar phases compared with the corresponding LDO@TiO2-T sample but without the phases containing the Ti element (Fig. S2†). For example, only (220) (311) planes of ZnAl2O4 were observed in ZnAl-LDO-800. These results indicate that ZnAl-LDO can maintain structural stability in a wide calcination temperature. The infrared spectra of LDH@TiO2 and LDO@TiO2 were also measured (Fig. S3†). In contrast with LDH@TiO2, the stretching vibration and bending vibration of OH− and the stretching vibration of the interlayer CO32− were almost disappeared in LDO@TiO2, demonstrating that ZnAl-LDH was converted to ZnAl-LDO.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a sliced LDH@TiO2 nanosheet confirmed the core–shell nanosheet structure. TiO2 shell layer was uniformly coated on the ZnAl-LDH nanosheet, and the thickness of the ZnAl-LDH core and TiO2 shell were ∼300 and ∼80 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). No lattice fringe appeared in the shell material, confirming that TiO2 was amorphous (Fig. S4†). LDO@TiO2 displayed a similar core–shell structure of LDH@TiO2 (Fig. 3b). Porous structures could be observed in the core and shell regions, deriving from the release of gaseous species (H2O, CO2, etc.) during the calcination process of ZnAl-LDH.44 The corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping verified the well-defined ZnAl oxides core and Ti oxide shell structure. Zn and Al elements showed a high density in the core region, while Ti element was located in the shell region (Fig. 3c). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of LDO@TiO2 revealed that ZnAl-LDH core and amorphous TiO2 shell of LDH@TiO2 were converted to ZnAl-LDO and anatase TiO2 phases (Fig. 3d). In the shell region, the interplanar distance of 0.352 nm corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2.45 The interplanar distances of 0.248 nm, 0.260 nm and 0.281 nm in the core region can be ascribed to (100), (002), and (101) planes of zincite ZnO, respectively.46 The surface area and pore size distribution of the prepared samples were investigated by N2-adsorption/desorption measurements. The type-IV isotherm with H3-type hysteresis loops (P/P0 > 0.4) was observed for both LDO and LDO@TiO2 (Fig. 3e). The specific surface area of ZnAl-LDH is relatively low (7.9 m2 g−1). ZnAl-LDO has an enhanced specific surface area (43.8 m2 g−1), and that of LDO@TiO2 further increases to 73.8 m2 g−1. ZnAl-LDO presents mesoporous distribution with the main pore size of 8–9 nm (Fig. 3f). For LDO@TiO2, the pore size distribution occurs with two peaks (4–5 and 8–9 nm). It can be inferred from the TEM images that the 4–5 and 8–9 nm mesopores of LDO@TiO2 should correspond to the porous TiO2 shell and ZnAl-LDO core, respectively. The distribution of mesopores in LDO@TiO2 is advantageous for the adsorption and desorption of dyes.

Furthermore, it was found that the growth of the TiO2 shell on ZnAl-LDH can be controlled by the concentration of Ti(OBu)4 in the hydrothermal solution (see details in the Experimental section). SEM images of the two samples obtained at low and high concentrations of Ti(OBu)4 (denoted as LDH@TiO2-L, LDH@TiO2-H) are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The thickness of the LDH@TiO2-L nanosheet is much thinner than that of LDH@TiO2, suggesting that a small amount of TiO2 was coated in ZnAl-LDH. The LDH@TiO2-H nanosheet displayed a thick TiO2 shell, and some TiO2 microspheres can be observed outside the core–shell material (Fig. S5†). These experimental results demonstrate that LDH@TiO2 fabricated under a middle concentration of Ti(OBu)4 can be considered an optimal sample in this work. Based on the hydrolysis mechanism of Ti(OBu)4, the in situ growth process of TiO2 on ZnAl-LDH is schematically shown in Fig. 4c. The –OH group and absorbed water molecules in the LDH surface provide a polar reaction environment, so the dealcoholization of Ti(OBu)4 preferentially reacts on the surface of ZnAl-LDH. The intermediate Ti(OH)4 continues the hydrolysis process.47 The hydrolysis process gradually reaches equilibrium with the consumption of Ti(OBu)4. Finally, amorphous TiO2 was grown in situ on the surface of LDH nanosheets to form the core–shell structure.

3.2 Photocatalytic degradation properties
The photocatalytic degradation of organic pollution was studied through degradation of methylene blue (MB, a typical cationic dye) and acid orange (AO, a typical anionic dye) in a neutral aqueous solution. The concentrations of MB or AO were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at maximum wavelength of 664 nm or 484 nm, respectively, using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Fig. S6 and S7†). It was found that the absorption properties of MB and AO for LDO@TiO2, ZnAl-LDO and commercial P25 were distinctly different (Fig. 5a). LDO@TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO displayed 9.9% and 9.1% adsorption percentage of MB in 40 min, respectively, which are slightly higher than that of P25 (5.4%). This can be attributed to the mesoporous structure of LDO@TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO. For the anionic AO, the adsorption percentage of LDO@TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO dramatically increased to 51.2% and 70.8%, respectively. The high adsorption percentages were derived from the regeneration of ZnAl-LDH accompanied by the chemical adsorption of anionic AO. ZnAl-LDO was converted to ZnAl-LDH due to the “memory effect” when it contacts water solutions containing anions,48 which was confirmed from the XRD patterns (Fig. S8†). The (003) reflection at 12.2° appears in the used LDO@TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO, demonstrating the regeneration of ZnAl-LDH. The interlayer spacing of the regenerated ZnAl-LDH is the same as that of pristine ZnAl-LDH, indicating that the adsorption of AO is a surface chemical adsorption. The reservation of the reflections of ZnO indicates that only a part of ZnAl-LDO converts to ZnAl-LDH. To eliminate the effect of dye adsorption, the used photocatalysts were mixed with dye solutions for 40 min to reach the adsorption–desorption equilibrium before the irradiation reaction.

Under the irradiation reaction, the MB photodegradation efficiency of ZnAl-LDO was 41.7% within 120 min, which is lower than that of P25 (Fig. 5b). This result indicates that the pristine ZnAl-LDO is a bad photocatalyst. LDO@TiO2 displays much-enhanced degradation efficiency (86.4%), derived from the synergy of the ZnAl-LDO core and TiO2 shell. For the anionic AO, the degradation efficiencies of the three samples were in the following order: LDO@TiO2 > P25 > ZnAl-LDO. The AO degradation efficiencies of the three samples are higher than that of MB, indicating that the adsorption of dyes on the surface of photocatalysts facilitates the degradation process. Furthermore, the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was measured to determine the mineralization efficiencies of dyes by the photocatalytic degradation reaction (Fig. 5c). The TOC removal efficiency of ZnAl-LDO was only 24.8% (MB) and 28.8% (AO) in 120 min, which is inferior to that of P25. The TOC removal efficiency of LDO@TiO2 dramatically increases to 63.7% (MB) and 70.9% (AO), suggesting that MB and AO can be mostly mineralized to H2O and CO2 by the photocatalytic process.
In addition, the effect of solution pH on the performance of LDO@TiO2 was investigated (Fig. S9†). The adsorption percentage of MB were 4.5%, 9.9% and 11.7% at pH = 4, 7, 10, respectively. The degradation efficiency of MB at pH = 10 was 84.3%, slightly higher than at pH = 7 (79.4%) and pH = 4 (69.9%). For AO, LDO@TiO2 exhibits a higher adsorption percentage (81.6%) in pH = 10 compared to that in pH = 4 and 7. But the photodegradation efficiency of AO had little difference in solutions of different pH values. The stability of LDO@TiO2 was carried out by a cycle photocatalytic degradation reaction of MB and AO. It exhibited nearly constant photodegradation performance after five cycles, indicating good stability of the photocatalyst (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, compared with similar type TiO2-based photocatalysts, the photodegradation performance of LDO@TiO2 is superior to most reported photocatalysts (Table S1†).49–57 The above results demonstrate that the LDO@TiO2 core–shell material is an excellent photocatalysis for the photodegradation of organic pollution.
3.3. Mechanism discussion
Further investigations were performed to give a deep insight into the enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance of LDO@TiO2. The elemental valence state of LDO@TiO2, ZnAl-LDO and commercial anatase TiO2 (TiO2-Anatase) were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The full spectrum of LDO@TiO2 revealed signals of Zn, Al, Ti and O elements (Fig. S10†). As shown in Fig. 6a, O 1s XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 530.0 eV and 531.7 eV, which are assigned to the lattice oxygen O2− and surface –OH group, respectively. The surface –OH group is considered as one of the main defects in metal oxides.58 A strong –OH peak is observed in ZnAl-LDO, which is consistent with the reports that LDO materials are hydrophilic on account of the “memory effect”.59 TiO2-Anatase displays a typical strong O2− peak. LDO@TiO2 presents the weakest –OH group peak and the strongest O2− peak, suggesting that surface defects in LDO and TiO2 are suppressive due to the synergy of core and shell components. Two dominant peaks at 1022.6 and 1045.7 eV corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, are observed in ZnAl-LDO (Fig. 6b). The binding energies of Zn2+ status are close to Zn–OH than Zn–O, which is consistent with the O 1s in the XPS spectrum. After the incorporation of the TiO2 shell, two peaks of Zn 2p decrease to 1021.7 and 1044.8 eV, indicating an increase in Zn–O and decrease of Zn–OH bonds in LDO@TiO2. TiO2-Anatase shows the binding energies of 458.6 and 464.3 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. A negative shift (0.5 eV) of Ti 2p peaks is observed in LDO@TiO2, indicating a distinct increase in the electron density of Ti (Fig. 6c). This remarkable negative shift suggests that the electron transfer from ZnAl-LDO to TiO2 in LDO@TiO2.

ZnAl-LDO displays a strong PL emission-wide peak at 400–500 nm, corresponding to the recombination of holes and electrons (Fig. 6d). The PL intensity of LDO@TiO2 has a decline, indicating that the construction of the heterojunction can suppress the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Time-resolved transient photoluminescence spectra are shown in Fig. 6e. The average fluorescence lifetime values are determined to be 37.6 and 85.4 ns for ZnAl-LDO and LDO@TiO2. The prolonged fluorescence lifetime of LDO@TiO2 demonstrates the long life of charge carriers. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of LDO@TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO in the aqueous solution are shown in Fig. 6f. Under light irradiation, only DMPO-˙OH (peak intensity ratio = 1:2:2:1) signals were observed in ZnAl-LDO and LDO@TiO2. The ˙OH signal intensities of LDO@TiO2 are obviously higher than those of ZnAl-LDO under the same irradiation time. ˙OH is generated in the process of water oxidation by the holes, the improved signal intensities of LDO@TiO2 also indicate a higher separation efficiency for the photo-generated electron–hole pairs.60 In addition, photoelectrochemical experiments under on–off cyclical light were further performed to probe the interface charge transfer behavior (Fig. S11†). ZnAl-LDO displayed a relatively low photocurrent response. The photocurrent density of LDO@TiO2 has a remarkable improvement, suggesting the lower recombination of photo-generated carriers.
The bandgap of ZnAl-LDO and LDO@TiO2 were estimated from UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. S12†). ZnAl-LDO showed a light absorption edge at 410 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 3.0 eV. The CB and VB positions of ZnAl-LDO are determined to be -0.96 V and 2.04 V vs. RHE.61,62 The absorption edge of LDO@TiO2 and TiO2-Anatase are both located at 390 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 3.2 eV. The conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions of TiO2 are located at −0.5 V and 2.7 V vs. RHE.63,64 Built-in electric field would form in the interface of ZnAl-LDO and TiO2. Given the results above, a mechanism for the enhanced photocatalytic degradation performance of LDO@TiO2 is proposed (Fig. 7). The organic dye molecules can diffuse across the mesoporous TiO2 shell to the interior ZnAl-LDO. Under illumination, electron–hole pairs would generate both in ZnAl-LDO and TiO2. Due to the band energy difference between ZnAl-LDO and TiO2, the photogenerated holes on the valence band of TiO2 tend to migrate to ZnAl-LDO, while the photogenerated electrons of ZnAl-LDO travel to TiO2. The opposite migration in the ZnAl-LDO/TiO2 heterojunction interface hinders the recombination of charge carriers. The generation of ˙OH on the surface of TiO2 and ZnAl-LDO can efficiently decompose organic dye molecules into smaller molecules (CO2, etc.). The mesoporous structure of nanosheets facilitates the diffusion of reactants and products. Therefore, LDO@TiO2 core–shell nanosheets exhibit excellent photocatalytic degradation performance.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, LDO@TiO2 core–shell nanosheet photocatalyst was designed and successfully prepared by the transformation of the LDH@TiO2 precursor. The fabrication process of the TiO2 shell and LDOs core can be facilely controlled by the concentration of Ti(OBu)4 and LDH processors. The prepared LDO@TiO2 photocatalyst gives typical core–shell nanosheet morphology with high specific surface area and the mesoporous structure. TEM and XRD analyses confirm the successful fabrication of ZnAl-LDO/TiO2 core–shell heterojunction, which facilitates the charge separation efficiency. Consequently, LDO@TiO2 photocatalysts exhibit superior photodegradation and mineralization ratio for organic pollution. It is expected that this LDO@TiO2 fabrication strategy can be applicable to the preparation of other core–shell metal oxide composite materials.
