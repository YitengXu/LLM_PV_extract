    , Accepted 4th July 2016First published on 21st July 2016AbstractA complete one- and two-photon spectroscopic and photophysical characterization of three diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)–porphyrin conjugates is reported. The increased conjugation introduced by the incremental addition of one, two and four DPP units on the meso porphyrin positions strongly affects the optical properties of the systems. Ground and triplet excited state absorption spectra show a gradual broadening and bathochromic shift and a trend to lower energies is also observed for both fluorescence and phosphorescence emission. Interestingly, the fluorescence quantum yield increases along the series, leading to remarkable NIR emission properties for the larger derivatives. Unlike the model porphyrin, all derivatives exhibit high two-photon absorption activity. An increase in two-photon absorption cross-section in the regions 800–840 nm and 910–930 nm is observed moving from one DPP to two DPP appended units, with a value of the order of 4000 GM at 910 nm for the latter system. The four compounds show high efficiency in generating singlet oxygen, with yields ranging from 0.7 to 0.5, envisaging favourable applications in both one- and two-photon photodynamic therapies. A detailed theoretical exploration of both linear (absorption and emission) and non-linear (two-photon absorption) properties proposes an analysis of the experimental spectra and a comprehensive interpretation of the two-photon activity within the series of compounds.
Introduction
Porphyrins are aromatic compounds displaying unique optical, electronic, redox and catalytic properties, thanks to their eighteen delocalised π-electrons. They are among the most widespread molecules in nature and the most versatile compounds for several applications, from materials science to medicinal chemistry. Natural photosynthetic systems rely on selected pigments related to porphyrins, chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls, as components of antenna systems and reaction centres.1–8 Because of their superior photo- and electrochemical properties, porphyrins have been used as photoactive units in energy conversion structures9–11 and thanks to their attractive optical and electronic properties, they have been widely explored as linear and non-linear materials for optoelectronics12,13 and biomedical research.14–17 Of particular interest is the dependence of these properties on the perturbation of the porphyrin electronic system via an enhanced conjugation. Extending the porphyrin π-system by the design of expanded porphyrins, conjugated-porphyrin oligomers or conjugated porphyrin-aromatic systems, is an interesting tool to control electronic coupling, to fine tune the HOMO–LUMO gap, to change absorption and emission features as well as triplet excited state properties and to modulate the redox characteristics. Such extended molecules are promising to develop biomimetic light-harvesting antennas and reaction centres, and photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells and molecular wires.10,18–37 In addition, the near-infrared (NIR) absorption and emission features of π-extended porphyrins render them particularly appealing for biomedical (imaging, sensing), optoelectronic and energy conversion applications.16,38–43
Conjugated porphyrin systems, moreover, have highly polarisable structures leading to strong non-linear optical properties such as two-photon absorption (TPA).44–54 The main advantages of TPA with respect to one-photon absorption (OPA), namely the use of lower excitation energies in conjunction with increased 3D spatial resolution, render two-photon excitation with great potential for application in materials sciences, such as three-dimensional micro-fabrication, data-storage and optical power limiting.18,55–59 Two-photon excitation performed in the NIR region is also appealing for medical applications due to the transparency of body tissues above 700 nm and the decrease of the photodamage, inherent in the use of a low energy light source. Molecules presenting high TPA have been thus developed for fluorescence imaging, spatial control of photoreleased drugs and photodynamic therapy.60–75
Understanding the structural–photophysical property relationships of π-extended porphyrins on the basis of both experimental and theoretical analysis is of considerable interest to optimize the design of efficient molecules characterized by NIR absorption and fluorescence, high triplet yield and high TPA cross-sections, as good candidates for both linear and non-linear biomedical applications.76–81 Theoretical analysis based on OPA and TPA simulated spectra and on calculated emission enables us to extract the electronic properties at the origin of photophysical processes not directly accessible experimentally.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is a red pigment, which was advantageously associated with porphyrins for dye-sensitized solar cells and materials science applications.82–85 Some of us have recently developed new hydrophilic diketopyrrolopyrrole–porphyrin conjugates, DPP–ZnP and (DPP)2–ZnP, as photosensitizers for two-photon photodynamic therapy (TP-PDT) (Fig. 1).86 These chromophores have shown high TPA properties in the near infrared region and strong oxygen generation ability. In order to explore in detail how the introduction of incremental DPP units into the porphyrinic π-system affects the photophysical properties, we have performed a comprehensive one-photon and two-photon characterization of the DPP–ZnP and (DPP)2–ZnP compounds, as well as of a newly synthetized porphyrinic system with four appended DPP units, (DPP)4–ZnP. A detailed fluorescence analysis in terms of radiative and non-radiative rate constants in three solvents (dichloromethane, DCM, dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, and H2O) is provided, together with a complete characterization of the triplet excited states of the compounds, both in terms of transient absorption and of phosphorescence emission. Singlet oxygen generation efficiencies in DMSO have been measured, to be compared to those obtained in less polar DCM. The detailed spectroscopic and photophysical studies have been integrated with extended theoretical studies that focus on the electronic charge transfer directionality at the origin of OPA and TPA activities. The non-routine computational approach used in the present work is validated by recent preliminary results93 reported for model systems of the DPP–Zn-porphyrin conjugates investigated here.

The results support the relevance of the design of DPP–ZnP conjugates to afford promising materials as efficient NIR emitters and one- and two-photon photosensitizers for PDT.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the compounds are represented in Fig. 1. Zinc(II) porphyrin ZnP has a moderate π-extended system given by the two meso trans ethynyl groups whereas the diketopyrrolopyrrole–Zn(II)porphyrin conjugates DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP and (DPP)4–ZnP present a higher π-conjugation due to, respectively, one, two and four DPP units meso linked to the porphyrin core through an ethynyl bridge. Extended conjugation of the porphyrin π-system to the two trans meso phenyl groups decorated with triethylene glycol chains is limited due to the twisting of the phenyl rings which aims at avoiding steric interactions with the meso porphyrinic protons. The synthesis of DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP and ZnP was already reported.86 The crystal structure of the model compound ZnP was obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis (see Fig. S16 and Table S9, ESI†). Compound (DPP)4–ZnP was prepared in 46% yield by a fourfold Sonogashira coupling reaction performed on the meso 5,10,15,20-tetraethylnylporphyrin and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry (Fig. S2–S4, ESI†).
Absorption and emission properties
One-photon spectroscopic and photophysical characterization of the four compounds has been performed in DCM, DMSO and H2O added with 1% DMSO.
The absorption spectra of ZnP, DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP and (DPP)4–ZnP in DCM are compared in Fig. 2, whereas those in DMSO are reported in Fig. S5 (ESI†), together with arbitrarily scaled absorption spectra of the four compounds in H2O + 1% DMSO.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the four compounds in DCM. 
A remarkable bathochromic shift of the absorption spectrum is observed, moving from the porphyrin precursor ZnP to the conjugates with one, two and four appended DPP units, due to the decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap of the transitions, as confirmed by theoretical investigations (see below and ESI†). The Soret region broadens by increasing the number of DPP substituents, becoming an extended envelop of bands ranging from 400 to 600 nm in (DPP)4–ZnP (Fig. 2 and Fig. S5, ESI†). The calculated transitions (see below) give evidence of various π–π transitions involving localised porphyrin states or delocalised DPP–ZnP states in this region. The solvent polarity has a limited influence on the energy of the transitions but in some cases affects their relative intensity. We can also observe that the intensity of the lowest-energy Q-band increases while it shifts to the red for the three “linear” compounds, in agreement with earlier reports on conjugated porphyrins.18,59,87,88
Normalized emission spectra of the four compounds in DCM at room temperature are shown in Fig. 3 (see Fig. S6 for the same comparison in DMSO and H2O + 1% DMSO, ESI†). Emission parameters (emission maxima, quantum yields, lifetimes, and radiative and non-radiative rate constants) are collected in Table 1.

In DCM and DMSO the conjugates show the typical features of porphyrin fluorescence with a bathochromic shift along the series that leads to emission in the NIR region for (DPP)4–ZnP (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6, ESI†). In H2O, the spectrum of ZnP, DPP–ZnP, and (DPP)2–ZnP keeps the typical porphyrin fluorescence features, whereas that of (DPP)4–ZnP shows a broad and structureless emission (Fig. S6b, ESI†) indicative of important aggregation phenomena.
Measurements in DCM with 1% pyridine were performed for the larger derivative (DPP)4–ZnP, in order to ascertain the occurrence of aggregation in pure DCM. Whereas the absorption spectrum is slightly perturbed by the addition of pyridine, an emission red-shift of ca. 20 nm is observed with respect to pure DCM, together with a fourfold increase of the fluorescence quantum yield (Table 1, Fig. S7, ESI†). The spectral shift can be ascribed to the axial coordination of pyridine to the central Zn(II) ion of the porphyrin, and the increased emission efficiency is ascribed to aggregate disruption by axial coordination.‡
The emission spectrum of each compound progressively shifts to lower energy when the polarity of the solvent increases (DCM < DMSO < H2O), and the extent of the shift increases along the series. This behaviour can be assigned to the increasing contribution of low-lying charge-transfer (CT) excited states in the emission with the increment of DPP units in the structure. This is confirmed by the calculated energies of the lowest singlet and triplet states reported in Table 2. The intense peaks observed in DCM at 636 nm (ZnP), 658 nm (DPP–ZnP), 684 nm ((DPP)2–ZnP) and 702 nm ((DPP)4–ZnP) (Fig. 3 and Table 1) are assigned to the lowest S1 states. This is corroborated in the case of m-ZnP with the presence of the S1 (a1Au) state calculated at 613 nm and corresponding to the HOMO–LUMO excitation.

Interestingly, the fluorescence quantum yield of the compounds in DCM and DMSO increases along the series (Table 1). This is almost unexpected considering the progressive decrease of the emission energy. The apparent contradiction with the “energy gap law”, predicting lower emission yield with the decrease of the emission energy, can be explained by considering that the oscillator strength increases along the series, due to the strong coupling between the central porphyrin and the appended DPP units.89 It can be noticed that the emission lifetime decreases and both radiative and non-radiative rate constants increase, moving from ZnP to (DPP)2–ZnP (Table 1). While the observed trend for lifetimes and radiative constants can be ascribed to the increased oscillator strength, the behaviour of the non-radiative constant is in accordance with the “energy gap law”.
Emission quantum yields of all compounds in H2O + 1% DMSO are of the order of 2–6 × 10−3 and lower than in the other two solvents, likely due to solubility and aggregation issues, confirmed by short or multi-exponential decays (Table 1).
The emission features of the four compounds at 77 K have been investigated in a DCM:MeOH (1:1) glassy mixture and in the same mixture containing 50% of ethyl iodide (EtI). Fluorescence spectra, recorded in the former matrix, show higher spectral resolution compared to those at room temperature and for the larger conjugates they extend far in the NIR region (Fig. S8, ESI†). Singlet excited state energies, determined from the fluorescence maxima in the solid matrix at 77 K, decrease from 1.96 eV for ZnP to 1.76 eV for (DPP)4–ZnP (Table S1, ESI†). In order to explore the phosphorescence features of the compounds and gain information on their triplet excited state energies we took advantage of an external heavy atom effect by adding EtI to the solvent mixture. Luminescence spectra collected at 77 K in DCM:MeOH:EtI (1:1:2) reveal a clear phosphorescence for precursor ZnP, with maxima at 872 and 996 nm, and weak bands emerging from the tail of fluorescence for the three derivatives (see Fig. S9, ESI†). Since these bands are not present in the luminescence spectra measured in the absence of EtI, we can safely ascribe them to phosphorescence emission. The triplet emission maxima are observed at 914, 1062 and 1220 nm for DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP, and (DPP)4–ZnP, respectively (Table S1, ESI†), revealing a decrease in the energy of the emitting triplet that follows the trend observed for fluorescence emission. It can be noticed that the singlet–triplet energy gap increases along the series, from 0.54 eV to 0.74 eV (Table S1, ESI†). The data indicate that all the examined compounds can sensitize singlet oxygen through a T–T energy transfer, given the energy level of singlet oxygen at 0.98 eV.
The model systems are characterized by the lowest triplet T1 (3Au) excited state calculated at 1000 nm for m-ZnP, and 1170 nm and 1177 nm for m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP, respectively (Table 2).
In view of the important role of the triplet excited state in singlet oxygen generation, this state has also been characterized by laser flash photolysis experiments in air-free DMSO. The end of pulse transient absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4 and triplet lifetimes are collected in Table S2 (ESI†). Ground state bleaching features in the region 400–800 nm and a pronounced absorption at 470 and 730 nm for ZnP and in the 800–1100 nm range for the DPP-containing molecules are observed. The triplet absorption spectra, representing T1–Tn transitions, follow the same trend to lower energies observed for ground state absorption spectra, due to the increased delocalization introduced by the conjugated DPP units, which decreases the gaps in the excited triplet manifold.

The S0 → Tn transitions calculated at the electronic ground state and lowest triplet T1 excited state optimized structures of m-ZnP, m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP are reported in Table S3 (ESI†), as well as the T1 → Tn transition energies directly contributing to the experimental transient absorption spectra depicted in Fig. 4. Five low-lying T1 → Tn transitions with significant oscillator strengths may contribute to the transient absorption spectra of ZnP and DPP–ZnP depicted in Fig. 4. These transitions are calculated between 1019 nm and 697 nm (m-ZnP) with intense absorptions at 765 nm and 705 nm in agreement with the experimental data (Table S2, ESI†). The series of T1 → Tn transitions in m-DPP–ZnP is calculated between 991 nm and 664 nm with oscillator strengths that never exceed 0.099 but within the experimental spectral range.
Singlet oxygen production
Singlet oxygen quantum yield determinations for the four compounds have been performed by direct measurements of singlet oxygen phosphorescence in DCM86 and by an indirect method in DMSO.90 Determinations in H2O (or D2O) were precluded by the low solubility of the compounds in this solvent.
Singlet oxygen luminescence spectra recorded from optically matched DCM solutions of ZnP, DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP86 and (DPP)4–ZnP and the chosen standard are reported in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The measured ϕΔ values are collected in Table 1 and show a decrease from 0.74 to 0.47 along the series.
The singlet oxygen quantum yields measured in DMSO (see Fig. S11, ESI† and the Experimental section for details) are reported in Table 1 and, notably, are almost identical to the values obtained in DCM, showing the same trend along the series.
The decrease of ϕΔ with the incremental addition of DPP units is consistent with a similar trend in the triplet formation yield, expected on the basis of the increase of the fluorescence quantum yield along the series. In addition, in the case of (DPP)4–ZnP, the weak driving force (ca. 0.04 eV) in the sensitization of singlet oxygen can also play a role. Overall, the values measured for the four compounds are significantly high, suggesting that the samples can be promising photosensitizers for PDT.
Two-photon absorption spectroscopy
The TPA properties were investigated by the two-photon induced fluorescence method, as already reported.86 The experimental two-photon excitation spectra of ZnP, DPP–ZnP and (DPP)2–ZnP in DCM (already reported)86 and the one of (DPP)4–ZnP in pyridine are represented in Fig. 5. In DCM, at the concentration (10−4 M) used for this experiment, aggregation of (DPP)4–ZnP was noticed even upon addition of 1–5% pyridine whereas in pure pyridine, (DPP)4–ZnP was soluble allowing two-photon excitation spectra to be recorded. For the last compound, σ2 has been determined beyond 890 nm to ensure a quadratic dependency of the fluorescence intensity on the excitation power, indicating a two-photon process. Compared to ZnP, showing a low two-photon absorption cross-section σ2 of less than 20 GM over the whole spectra, DPP–ZnP and (DPP)2–ZnP display significant two-photon absorption in two spectral regions, from 800 to 840 nm and from 910 to 930 nm (Fig. 5). A high increase in σ2 values is noticed on going from the one DPP to the two DPP conjugated systems, from 640 to 1360 GM at 810 nm and from 1950 to 4020 GM at 910 nm for DPP–ZnP and (DPP)2–ZnP, respectively. The same trend is observed in DMSO; however, the σ2 values obtained are much lower, as an example, a σ2 value of 935 GM was measured for (DPP)2–ZnP at 910 nm (see Fig. S15, ESI†). Moving to four conjugated DPPs, the spectrum of (DPP)4–ZnP in pyridine also displays a maximum at 910 nm, with a σ2 value of 1340 GM. Obviously, the polarity and coordination properties of the solvent have a limited effect on the energy of the two-photon induced absorption transitions but affect more strongly their probabilities, as already noticed in the linear absorption properties of these molecules (see above).

Theoretical analysis

Structural and electronic properties. 
The structures of the four ZnP compounds investigated experimentally were simplified as follows: all di- and triethylene glycol chains were cut and replaced either by methoxy groups on the phenylene units or by methyl groups on the DPP units. The main characteristics of the optimized geometries of the four model compounds, so-called m-ZnP, m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP in the electronic ground state, are reported in Table S4 (ESI†) and the corresponding coordinates are given in Table S5 (ESI†). The optimized structure of m-ZnP is compared to the X-ray structure of ZnP in Fig. S12 (ESI†) and the optimized structures of m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–Zn and m-(DPP)4–ZnP are depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†).
The geometrical parameters reported in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†) and the comparison between ZnP and m-ZnP validate the model structures. In addition, insignificant bond length variations are observed when going from the reference molecule to the extended systems for which no X-ray structures are available.
The frontier Kohn–Sham (KS) orbitals of the four model systems are depicted in Fig. S14a–d (ESI†). On going from the reference m-ZnP molecule to the fourfold DPP substituted system m-(DPP)4–ZnP the calculations evidence an important decrease of the HOMO–LUMO energy gap explained by a destabilization of the HOMO and a significant stabilization of the LUMO as soon as one branch is added (m-DPP–ZnP) due to an electronic delocalization over the new π-conjugated DPP component (Scheme 1). This explains the occurrence of an increasing number of low-lying excited states below 2.6 eV (∼480 nm) when adding extended ligands with generation of a high density of DPP centered transitions and porphyrin-to-DPP charge-transfer states.

One-photon absorption spectroscopy. 
The computed OPA spectra of the compounds in DCM solvent are represented in Fig. 6. The corresponding absorption wavelengths, associated transitions and oscillator strengths are reported in the ESI† (Table S6). The most intense 1Au transitions and the involved KS orbitals for all systems are reported in Tables S7 and S8 (ESI†).

The computed spectra of all systems are characterized by a low-energy band with a maximum at 596 nm (f = 0.536) in m-ZnP, 670 nm (f = 1.71) in m-DPP–ZnP, 720 nm (f = 2.45) in m-(DPP)2–Zn and 758 nm (f = 1.633) in m-(DPP)4–ZnP (Fig. 6). This observed red-shift within the series by substitution of extended ligands, also observed experimentally, is attributed to the HOMO–LUMO gap decrease. Six transitions calculated at 415 nm (f = 0.525), 431 nm (f = 0.05), 446 nm (f = 0.526), 467 nm (f = 0.12), 472 nm (f = 1.433) and 481 nm (f = 1.06) contribute to the intense Soret band observed in the model complex m-ZnP between 400 and 500 nm. These transitions lead to either π–π* states localized on the porphyrin ring or to less intense transitions corresponding to charge separated from porphyrin-to-DPP.
In the three DPP-substituted model molecules the theoretical spectra exhibit an intense Q-band remaining localized, similar to the experimental spectra of the title systems. The theory points to a significant broadening of the Soret band in m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP due to increasing charge transfer contributions and large mixing between excited states in this domain of energy, especially for the four-DPP substituted system. A detailed analysis of the theoretical absorption spectrum is provided in the ESI.†

 Fig. 8  Changes in electronic densities when going from the electronic ground state to the intermediate TP active 1Ag excited states of m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP (red: decrease of density; green: increase of density). 
In agreement with the experiments we observe a significant activity of m-(DPP)2–ZnP with a maximum at about 1065 nm, red-shifted as compared to the experimental value of 915 nm.
This intense band is composed of two peaks calculated at 1064 nm and 1170 nm with large theoretical cross-sections δTP = 4.43 × 106 a.u. (17700 GM) and δTP = 3.91 × 106 a.u. (12800 GM), respectively (Table 3). The weaker bands at 820–960 nm are composed of several bands at 821 nm, 882 nm, 898 nm, 939 nm and 964 nm of modest cross-sections (∼104–105 a.u.). m-(DPP)4–ZnP is characterized by three peaks calculated at 1040 nm, 1140 nm and 1200 nm of very high intensities (Table 3).
Only the active states with cross-sections greater than 10000 GM are reported in Table 3. The theoretical TPA values obtained for the ten lowest active intermediate states, as well as those of the less active molecules, namely m-ZnP and m-DPP–ZnP, are reported elsewhere.93
As illustrated by the changes in electronic densities depicted in Fig. 8, both charge transfers, either from the DPP entities to the porphyrin or from the porphyrin core to the DPP branches, give large TPA cross-sections (Table 3). Of course, charge transfer from the porphyrin core to the DPP branches is more favourable because it follows the natural trends, namely a donor to acceptor or to a neutral group CT. This is exemplified by the most intense TPA cross-sections obtained for the states |2〉 and |6〉 of the (DPP)2 and (DPP)4 substituted systems, respectively. Increasing the number of DPP entities does not necessarily improve the δTP cross-section. However, the directionality that will drive the transfer of electronic density along one axis in m-(DPP)2–ZnP or two axes in m-(DPP)4–ZnP is an important factor as this is illustrated in the case of the (DPP)4 substituted molecule (Fig. 8). Indeed, the two active states |6〉 and |5〉 are described by very similar electronic density changes. They correspond to excitations from the HOMO (Scheme 1) to low-lying vacant orbitals of Au symmetry depicted in Scheme 2. In the most intense |0〉 → |6〉 transition the directionality of the CT is identical for the four DPP branches generating four additive components along x and four additive components along y by projection of the transition dipole moment vectors on the x and y axis. This results in two large TP tensor terms, namely Sxx and Syy evaluated as ∼3000 a.u, each. In the less intense TP |0〉 → |5〉 transition the CT directionalities are different along the two axes of the DPP branches because of the change of the phase in the vacant accepting orbital (Scheme 2). In turn this results in non-additive contributions of the dipole transition moments and only one significant TP tensor term Sxy was evaluated to be ∼3000 a.u. As a consequence the δTP cross-section of the |0〉 → |5〉 transition is roughly half of the δTP cross-section of the |0〉 → |6〉 transition (Table 3).
 Scheme 2  Vacant accepting orbitals of symmetry au involved in the |0〉 → |6〉 (left) and |0〉 → |5〉 (right) transitions in m-(DPP)4–ZnP. Red arrows indicate the directionality of the CT in terms of dipole transition moments of components. 
A careful analysis of the changes in electronic densities of the active TP transitions in m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP (Fig. 8) indicates that an initial delocalized electronic density will drive the CT process along the π conjugation channel more efficiently. The relevance of these criteria is confirmed by the very similar nature of CT in the most active state |2〉 of m-(DPP)2–ZnP and |6〉 of m-(DPP)4–ZnP.
In contrast to the theoretical results the experimental spectra exhibit moderate cross-sections for m-(DPP)2–ZnP (<4000 GM) and m-(DPP)4–ZnP (<1500 GM) (Fig. 5). Moreover they do not show any TPA activity beyond 1000 nm whereas the theoretical TPA (Fig. 7) exhibits intense peaks between 1000 and 1200 nm with cross-sections greater than 10000 GM (Table 3).
A direct comparison between theoretical and experimental TPA properties is hazardous for several reasons. The solvent effects and the various conformers present in the real experiment are not realistically modelled by the present theoretical approach. Indeed the molecules are surrounded by a polarized continuum cavity taking into account implicitly the static solvent effects within the non-linear response theory. This is a crude approximation but the only one available nowadays. Alternative molecular dynamics simulations coupled to QM/MM approaches are not applicable to large molecular systems.94 Other important limitation is the occurrence of resonances that increase artificially the theoretical cross-sections by at least one order of magnitude because of the neglect of double excitations that is intrinsic to TD-DFT.95 Other effects such as vibronic coupling or the limited number of states requested in the non-linear response framework may overestimate the theoretical TPA cross-sections and underestimate the frequencies.
The theoretical results analysed above reflect an ideal situation of an isolated molecule in a totally transparent medium, which is a particular situation very different from the reality. Nevertheless the low TPA activity detected experimentally for m-(DPP)4–ZnP is difficult to interpret and rationalize according to the clear criteria developed above in terms of electron densities and generated dipole transition moments. One hypothesis is that the measured TP induced fluorescence is biased and does not reflect entirely the potential activity determined by theory. Indeed according to a detailed analysis recently published on the present systems93 several singlet states are accessible via TPA. The calculations put in evidence significant TPA activity at 1025, 1064 and 1040 nm for m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP, respectively. TPA at these wavelengths will populate singlet A states of m-DPP–ZnP and Ag states of m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP situated around 500 nm, nearly degenerate with A and Au OPA excited states calculated between 480 and 550 nm. We may expect very efficient internal conversion between the TPA and OPA singlet states by vibronic coupling. Consequently TPA will induce efficient fluorescence from the OPA states leading to the TPA signal detected experimentally at about 910 nm for the three systems. In contrast the theoretical TPA activity put in evidence around 1200 nm in m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP will potentially populate singlet excited states situated around 600 nm, in a region where the OPA activity is very weak with a low density of absorbing states not necessarily highly fluorescent. Moreover this low density of singlet excited states is less favourable to vibronic couplings at the origin of efficient internal conversion between TPA and OPA singlet excited states. This could explain the absence of experimental TPA signals beyond 1000 nm.
Further joined experimental/theoretical investigations should be pursued in order to conclude about possible correlation between measured TP induced fluorescence and potential TP activity determined by theory.
Conclusions
An in-depth study of the one- and two-photon photophysical properties and a detailed theoretical analysis of three DPP-substituted porphyrins, as well as a model porphyrin compound, are reported. The increased π-conjugation of the porphyrinic systems with one to four meso-attached DPP substituents has a notable impact on the ground and excited state properties and singlet oxygen production. Absorption and emission features are gradually shifted towards the infra-red region and despite the decrease in the energy of the emitting singlet, the fluorescence of the systems increases. This unusual behaviour is ascribed to the higher oscillator strength of the HOMO–LUMO transition with extended electron delocalisation, as confirmed by TD-DFT calculations. Phosphorescence of the compounds could be measured at low temperature, showing that the lowest triplet excited state decreases in energy with the increased conjugation. It remains nevertheless above that of singlet oxygen leading to efficient singlet oxygen sensitization. Significant values of the two-photon absorption cross-section were observed in the systems with one and two DPP appended units. In accordance with the experiments, calculated TP-absorption spectra evidence that these states can be reached efficiently by two-photon absorption from charge-transfer intermediate states involving the DPP branches. Increasing the number of DPP ligands does not necessarily improve the two-photon activity. More important is the directionality of the charge transfer along the acceptor–donor–acceptor axis, as illustrated in the two- and four-substituted DPP systems. Overall this study reveals the high potential of the DPP–ZnP conjugates as one- and two-photon photosensitizers and NIR emitters.
Experimental section
Spectroscopy and photophysics
DCM and DMSO were of spectroscopic grade from Merck and Carlo Erba, respectively. Tri-distilled (Millipore Milli-Q) H2O was used. 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF), Zn-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and pyridine were from Aldrich. Ethyl iodide was from Alfa Aesar.
Absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 650 UV-Vis and using a Lambda 9 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. In the mixture H2O + 1% DMSO, close to a pure aqueous environment, the compounds were found to be reasonably soluble but exact molar absorption coefficient determination was precluded.
Emission spectra were collected using an Edinburgh FLS920 fluorimeter equipped with a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 PMT (200–850 nm), and using an FLS920 fluorimeter (Edinburgh) equipped with an Hamamatsu R5509-72 InP/InGaAs photomultiplier tube supercooled at 193 K in a liquid nitrogen cooled housing and a TM300 emission monochromator with a NIR grating blazed at 1000 nm (sensitivity range: 300–1700 nm). The spectra have been corrected for the wavelength dependent phototube response. The fluorescence quantum yields have been determined with reference to TPP (tetra-phenyl-porphyrin) in aerated toluene (ϕfl = 0.11)96 for ZnP, DPP–ZnP, and DPP–ZnP, and with reference to (DPP)2–ZnP in aerated DCM (ϕfl = 0.16, Table 1) for (DPP)4–ZnP. Fluorescence lifetimes have been measured using an IBH Time Correlated Single Photon Counting apparatus with excitation both at 465 nm and 560 nm. The analysis of the luminescence decay profiles against time was accomplished using the DAS6 Decay Analysis Software provided by the manufacturer. Experiments at 77 K in frozen glasses made use of quartz capillary tubes immersed in liquid nitrogen contained in a home-made quartz dewar. Phosphorescence measurements made use of a Kimmon Koha Co. Ltd. HeCd laser as an excitation source (λexc = 442 nm, the power has been reduced to ca. 7 mW to avoid annihilation effects).
Estimated errors are 10% on exponential lifetimes, 20% on quantum yields, 20% on molar absorption coefficients and 3 nm on emission and absorption peaks.
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments were performed by systems based on Nd:YAG lasers: a JK laser (18 ns pulse duration, 532 nm, 3 mJ per pulse, UV-Vis detection) and a Surelite Continuum laser (6 ns pulse duration, 532 nm, 3 mJ per pulse, UV-Vis-NIR detection), using a right-angle analysis on the excited sample.97 The samples were bubbled with argon for ca. 15 min and sealed in homemade 10 mm optical path length cells.
Singlet oxygen production quantum yields in DCM have been measured in air equilibrated solutions with reference to Rose Bengal bis(triethyl-ammonium)salt (ϕΔ = 0.48 in DCM),98 by comparing the intensity of singlet oxygen phosphorescence spectra measured using the NIR fluorimeter described above. Excitation at 442 nm has been performed using a Kimmon Koha Co., Ltd. HeCd laser (with power reduced to ca. 7 mW). For (DPP)4–ZnP a concentration dependent study has been performed in DCM and DCM + 1% pyridine. The measured yields are almost unaffected by the concentration of the solution, with a mean value of 0.47 in DCM and 0.36 in DCM + 1% pyridine (Table 1).
Singlet oxygen production quantum yields in DMSO have been measured by a comparative method using DPBF as a singlet oxygen trap, which is oxidized by singlet oxygen and its degradation can be monitored by the decrease of its absorbance.99 ZnPc has been used as a standard (ϕΔ = 0.67).100 Solutions of the standard or of the compound containing DPBF 2.2 × 10−5 M, prepared in the dark, have been irradiated at 646 nm (A646 ∼ 0.3) by using an irradiation set-up composed of a 150 W xenon lamp (LOT) and an Omni-λ 150 monochromator (Zolix), under continuous stirring. The light intensity was 6 mW cm−2. The singlet oxygen quantum yield of the sample (ϕΔ) has been determined by using eqn (1): (1)where R and RStd are the DPBF degradation rates for the sample and the standard, respectively, and Iabs is the absorption at the excitation wavelength calculated as described previously.17 The absorption spectrum of DPBF at each irradiation step has been derived by subtracting the constant absorption contribution of the examined compound from the spectrum of the mixture. The decrease of DPBF absorption has been followed at 400 nm, a wavelength chosen to avoid distortion effects due to the high absorbance of some solutions around 450 nm.
Two-photon excitation spectra
The TPA cross-sectional spectra were obtained by the up-conversion fluorescence method as described previously101 using an Insight Spectra-Physics (680 nm/1300 nm) femtosecond laser. The excitation beam was collimated over the cell length (10 mm). The fluorescence, collected at 90° to the excitation beam, was focused into an optical fiber connected to a spectrometer. The incident beam intensity was adjusted to ensure an intensity-squared dependence of the fluorescence over the whole spectral range. Calibration of the spectra was performed by comparison with the published 800–950 nm Rhodamine B two-photon absorption spectrum.102 Below 800 nm, a significant contribution from one-photon absorption was noticed for (DPP)2–ZnP and (DPP)4–ZnP by a non-quadratic dependence of the emitted fluorescence vs. the laser power and points below this wavelength were discarded.
Computational details
The structures of model compounds for the four complexes ZnP, DPP–ZnP, (DPP)2–ZnP and (DPP)4–ZnP (Fig. 1) have been fully optimized in the electronic ground state at the density functional theory (DFT) level with the B3LYP functional22,103 with triple-ζ basis sets.104 With the size of the molecules depicted in Fig. 1 models have been built by replacing the N-diethylene-glycol chains by methyl groups and the phenyl–triethylene-glycol chains by methoxy groups. The model systems, the electronic densities of which should not differ dramatically from the one of the real molecules, are labeled m-ZnP, m-DPP–ZnP, m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP. All the calculations have been performed with no symmetry for m-ZnP, m-DPP–ZnP and m-(DPP)2–ZnP and with a center of inversion (CI) for m-ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP. Both series of results, with and without symmetry, are very similar for m-ZnP including structural and optical properties. All the results presented here are the one obtained without any symmetry, except for the 4-substituted molecule (DPP)4–ZnP system for which a CI has been kept due to the size of the molecule. A tentative interpretation of the emissive properties in the series is based on the optimized structures of the lowest singlet and triplet excited states at the same level of theory keeping the CI. The scalar relativistic effects are taken into account within the zero-order regular approximation (ZORA).105 The solvent effects have been taken into account by means of the conductor-like screening model, COSMO model106–108 (with ε = X for DCM) as implemented in ADF.109,110 On the basis of the electronic ground states' optimized geometries the theoretical one-photon absorption spectra of the four model molecules have been calculated at the time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) level of theory111,112 using the ADF-2013 quantum chemistry package113 whereas the two-photon absorption spectra of m-(DPP)2–ZnP and m-(DPP)4–ZnP have been computed using the poles and residues of quadratic response functions in the framework of TD-DFT as implemented in the DALTON program package.114 The details of the DALTON calculations for the whole series of Zn porphyrin conjugates are reported elsewhere.93
