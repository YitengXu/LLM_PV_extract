    , Accepted 4th July 2018First published on 5th July 2018AbstractA three-stage synthesis method was developed for the preparation of TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets by a solvothermal process. The formation mechanism of the TiO2 nanosheets was investigated by the variation of the solvothermal temperature and reaction time. In the three-stage synthesis process, assembled hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms were produced in the first stage, and then the hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms transformed gradually into cubic TiOF2 in the second stage. Anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets are formed from cubic TiOF2 after the third stage. The results reveal that the reaction time and temperature play important roles in controlling the transformation of the morphology and phase from the assembled hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms into the TiO2 nanosheets through cubic TiOF2. In addition, compared with hexagonal TiO2 prisms and cubic TiO2 calcined from HTiOF3 and TiOF2, the TiO2 nanosheets synthesized by the three-stage solvothermal strategy exhibited better photocatalytic performance. The finding of this work presents a distinctive formation mechanism of TiO2via intermediates HTiOF3 and TiOF2 to obtain TiO2 nanosheets with controllable morphologies and excellent properties.
Introduction
TiO2 is one of the most promising materials used in photocatalysts and it has been widely used in many emerging research fields, such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and dye-sensitized solar cells.1–5 Extensive research has been conducted to demonstrate that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 depended largely on its shape, size and exposed facets.6–8 Therefore, the synthesis of titanium dioxide with various morphologies and specific exposed surfaces has become a research hotspot for achieving excellent photocatalytic performance.9–11
To date, extensive experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the {001} facets with high surface energy of TiO2 present higher catalytic activity than the thermodynamically stable {101} facets.12,13 This is because the low coordination number of exposed atoms and the high density of unsaturated Ti atoms on the {001} surfaces are favorable for the dissociation and adsorption of reactants.14,15 Since Lu and co-workers first synthesized TiO2 nanosheets with 47% exposed {001} facets in 2008,16 various morphologies of TiO2 with exposed {001} facets have been explored.17–19 For instance, Yang et al. prepared anatase TiO2 spheres with exposed {001} facets via a solvothermal method, and the exposure ratio of the {001} facets was over 90%.20 Furthermore, in our previous research, the solvothermal method was adopted to synthesize carambola-like TiO2 consisting of nanosheets with exposed {001} facets.21 Numerous methods have been developed to fabricate anatase TiO2 nanocrystals dominated with {001} facets.22–24 Among them, surface fluorination based on first principles calculations to stabilize the {001} surface of anatase TiO2 crystals is supposed to be the most effective approach. HF is generally used as a capping agent for preparing TiO2 with exposed {001} facets due to its important roles of retarding the hydrolysis rate of the titanium precursor, lowering the surface energy of the {001} facet and suppressing the growth of the {001} facet during the exposure of {001} facets.25,26
As for the formation mechanism of TiO2 with exposed {001} facets, some research studies have reported that HF but not F and the pH of the reaction solution play vital roles in controlling the size, shape, morphology and {001}faceted surface area of TiO2.27 In addition, alcohols used as solvents are proven to serve as synergetic capping agents, which are beneficial to obtaining anatase TiO2 crystals with larger percentages of exposed {001} facets and uniform shapes and sizes.28 However, few papers focus on the intermediate phase of TiO2 with exposed {001} facets. For instance, Liu et al. obtained TiO2 nanosheets with 98.2% exposed {001} faceted surfaces via a distinctive two-stage formation mechanism by using a hydrofluoric acid vapor-phase hydrothermal method.29 The first stage produces a new intermediate crystal (orthorhombic HTiOF3) that is directly transformed into anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets during the second stage. Nonetheless, the general mechanisms for TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets are still needed to be explored.
In this work, a three-stage synthesis process was designed for the preparation of TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets by a solvothermal strategy. The formation mechanism of TiO2 was investigated by regulation of the solvothermal temperature and time. Moreover, the photocatalytic performance of the intermediates of assembled hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms, cubic TiOF2 and TiO2 nanosheets after calcination under air is tested.

Synthesis of samples
The synthetic process of the samples is further explored based on our previous work.30 2 mL of tetrabutyl titanate were added into 35 mL of n-octanol with stirring, then 0.8 mL of hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 wt%) was dropped slowly into the above solution with stirring. The solvothermal reaction was conducted at 230 °C for 10 h. After the Teflon-lined autoclave was cooled down to room temperature, the obtained samples were washed with ethanol several times, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. The solvothermal temperature and reaction time are investigated. The preparation conditions of the samples are listed in Table 1.

Characterization
The phase compositions of the samples were analysed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8-Advance, Cu Kα target, λ = 1.5406 Å). A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI, QUANTA FEG 250) was used to observe the morphologies of the samples. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (ESCALAB 250Xi) was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) by using a Thermo Electron Nicolet iS50 instrument was used to probe the surface functional groups of the samples. Thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) analysis curves were collected using a TGA/1600HT simultaneous thermal analysis instrument. The N2 physical adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using a BIAODE SSA-6000 apparatus at −196 °C. The samples were pretreated at 120 °C for 2 h before the analysis. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples were determined by the BET and BJH methods.
Photocatalytic performance
The synthesized samples were dispersed in methyl orange (MO) dye and their photocatalytic performance was tested under UV light irradiation; a Hg lamp (CEL-LAM500) with a power of 500 W was adopted as the UV source. In a typical experiment, 10 mg of the sample was mixed with 25 mL of a MO aqueous solution (10 mg L−1) and stirred in a dark environment for 30 min to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium before UV light irradiation. After that, 2 mL of the suspension solution was taken out at an irradiation time interval of 30 min and was centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst. Finally, a UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to obtain the absorbance spectra of the samples.
Results and discussion
The evolution of morphologies and phases with temperature

Fig. 1 shows the morphology evolution of the samples prepared at different temperatures for 20 h. The sample prepared at 120 °C exhibits an assembled hexagonal prism morphology as shown in Fig. 1(a1) and (a2). With the increase of the temperature from 120 °C to 140 °C, there is no transformation for the structure or phase of the assembled hexagonal prisms, and the size of the assembled hexagonal prisms grows larger (Fig. 1(b1) and (b2)). Some of the samples with the assembled hexagonal prism morphology were transformed into cubic boxes at 180 °C, as shown in Fig. 1(c1) and (c2). When the temperature increases to 190 °C in Fig. 1(d1) and (d2), the assembled hexagonal prism morphology disappeared and completely transformed into cubic boxes. After that, it is found that nanosheets started to grow from the side of the cubic boxes at 200 °C, as shown in Fig. 1(e1) and (e2). With the increase of the temperature to 230 °C, all the samples in Fig. 1(f1) and (f2) present only the nanosheet morphology. The sizes of the nanosheets are non-uniform, which are ca. 900 nm in length, ca. 500 nm in width, and ca. 40 nm in thickness on average.

The XRD patterns of the samples obtained at different temperatures for 20 h are shown in Fig. 2. It shows that the samples with the assembled hexagonal prism morphology are composed of HTiOF3 at 120 and 140 °C. The intensity of the diffraction peaks for ST140 becomes stronger than that of ST120, indicating that the crystallization of ST140 is enhanced. Besides, it is also found that the diffraction peaks of ST180 corresponded to HTiOF3. However, the morphology of ST180 in Fig. 1(c1) and (c2) consists of assembled hexagonal prisms and cubic boxes, and the peak located at 23.6° for TiOF2 is in line with the main peak of HTiOF3. Therefore, it could be deduced that the samples with the cubic box morphology are composed of TiOF2, which may be due to the diffraction peaks corresponding to HTiOF3 or the content of TiOF2 being too low to appear. Thereafter, the diffraction peaks of HTiOF3 completely disappeared and the samples have fully transformed into TiOF2 when the temperature increased to 190 °C, which exhibited the cubic box morphology. The diffraction peaks of anatase TiO2 located at 25.2° for ST200 arise, demonstrating that TiOF2 with the cubic box morphology begins to transform into TiO2 nanosheets. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of ST230 shows that all the diffraction peaks correspond to anatase TiO2 without other peaks, which indicates that TiOF2 with the cubic box morphology has completely transformed into TiO2 nanosheets. The evolution of morphologies and phases with different reaction temperatures is concluded in Table 2. The samples were prepared at different temperatures for 20 h.

ST230 with the nanosheet morphology is further confirmed by TEM, which is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The TEM images are consistent with the SEM images in Fig. 1(f1) and (f2). The high resolution (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3(c)) comes from the red triangle area in Fig. 3(b) which shows the (200) planes with a lattice spacing of 0.19 nm. The [001] zone of the anatase single crystal can be indexed to the diffraction spots from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (Fig. 3(d)). The above results indicate that the synthesized nanosheets are composed of anatase TiO2 with exposed {001} facets.

The evolution of morphology and phase with time

Fig. 4 shows that ST230 is further explored at different reaction times. Fig. 4(a1) and (a2) show that samples with the assembled hexagonal prism morphology are formed at a reaction time of 0.5 h and the sizes of the samples shown in Fig. 4(b1) and (b2) become larger as the reaction time increases to 1 h, indicating the growth of the crystals over the reaction time of 0.5 to 1 h. The cubic box morphology starts to appear at a reaction time of 5 h (Fig. 4(c1) and (c2)), indicating that the samples with the assembled hexagonal prism morphology gradually transform into cubic boxes. Besides, the samples with the assembled hexagonal prism morphology completely vanish and nanosheets appear on the side of the cubic boxes when the reaction time reaches 10 h as shown in Fig. 4(d1) and (d2).

Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the samples obtained at 230 °C for different times, which indicate that the evolution of the phase with reaction time changed. ST230 samples obtained at 0.5 h, 1 h, 5 h, 10 h and 20 h are composed of HTiOF3, HTiOF3, TiOF2, TiOF2 mixed with TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. The changes in the evolution rules of the morphologies and phases with reaction time are concluded in Table 3.

XPS spectra analysis
The chemical states of the element species in ST190 and ST230 are characterized by XPS in Fig. 6. The survey spectrum indicates that Ti, O, F and C elements all exist in ST190 and ST230 as shown in Fig. 6(a). In Fig. 6(b), the peaks of ST190 centered at 465.1 and 459.3 eV and the peaks of ST230 centered at 464.3 and 458.5 eV are assigned to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 core levels of Ti, respectively. The O 1s spectra shown in Fig. 6(c) indicated that both intermediates HTiOF3 and TiO2 are asymmetric and attributed to two different types of O atoms: one is lattice oxygen (Ti2O) which is located at around 530 eV; the other comes from hydroxyl groups.29 The high-resolution XPS spectra of F 1s are shown in Fig. 6(d). The peaks obtained from ST190 (TiOF2) reveal a symmetric peak centered at 684.7 eV, owing to the oxofluorotitanate type of Ti–F species. The presence of F 1s located at 684.4 eV can account for the surface-adsorbed Ti–F species in the anatase TiO2 nanosheets.

TG, DTG and FT-IR spectra analysis

Fig. 7 shows the TG and DTG analysis for ST120 (HTiOF3) and ST190 (TiOF2). It is found from Fig. 7(a) that the conversion process from HTiOF3 to TiO2 is composed of four sequential steps. In the first stage (180–260 °C), impurities such as octanol are removed. In the second step (260–360 °C), HTiOF3 is converted to TiOF2 with the loss of HF. In the third step (360–470 °C), titanium-containing impurities are apparently decomposed. Finally (480–700 °C), TiOF2 is converted to TiO2. Fig. 7(b) shows that TiOF2 is converted to TiO2 at around 480–650 °C, which corresponds to the fourth stage of the conversion process from HTiOF3 to TiO2.

Fig. 8 shows the FT-IR spectra of the samples prepared at different temperatures. It is observed that all the samples present common peaks at 3437 and 1628 cm−1, which are attributed to the stretch vibration of O–H and the bending vibrations of O–H groups. The peak centered at 920 cm−1 was due to the Ti–F vibrations in TiOF2 and HTiOF3. The peak centered at 534 cm−1 is assigned to Ti–O–Ti vibrations.

The formation mechanism of hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms to {001} faceted TiO2 nanosheets
Based on the above results, the formation mechanism of the hexagonal HTiOF3 prisms to {001} faceted TiO2 nanosheets are speculated in Fig. 9. At the first stage, tetrabutyl titanate is alcoholyzed to form titanium hydroxide and ether substances (eqn (1)).30 At the second stage, titanium hydroxide reacts with HF to form hexagonal HTiOF3 which is shown in eqn (2) and Fig. 9(a), indicating the formation of assembled hexagonal prisms through rapid nuclei growth, dissolution–recrystallization and a further growth process according to our previous research.31 At the third stage, HTiOF3 as the intermediate product further hydrolyzed to form cubic TiOF2 boxes through a dissolution–recrystallization process (eqn (3) and Fig. 9(b)). When TiOF2 reaches maturity, TiO2 nanosheets stretch from the side of the cubic TiOF2 boxes, which is accompanied by the dissolution of TiOF2 (Fig. 9(c)). Finally, the cubic TiOF2 boxes are completely dissolved and recrystallized to form TiO2 nanosheets (eqn (4) and Fig. 9(d)).

The morphologies and phases of the calcined precursors

Fig. 10 shows the SEM images of the precursors after calcination at 400 °C for 30 min under air. It can be found from Fig. 10(a) that the top facets of ST120 (HTiOF3) have disappeared after calcination, which was attributed to the decomposition of HTiOF3 accompanied by the release of HF, leading to the collapse of the top facets of ST120 (HTiOF3).31 In Fig. 10(b), the solid cubic boxes of ST190 (TiOF2) have transformed into hollow cubic boxes. The central core parts possess higher energy than the shell, which is prioritized to be broken down during the calcination process, causing the formation of hollow cubic boxes.32 The TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets are retained after calcination in Fig. 10(c), because the calcination temperature of 400 °C is not enough to damage their morphologies.31Fig. 10(d) reveals that all the products obtained from different reaction temperatures through calcination at 400 °C transform into TiO2.

Fig. 11 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution curve of ST120, ST190 and ST230 after being calcined at 400 °C for 30 min in air. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Fig. 11(a) displays the hysteresis loops of all the samples corresponding to type IV. The pore size distribution in Fig. 11(b) indicates that the size of most of the pores is in the range of 2–50 nm, which suggests that all the samples are mesoporous. The specific surface areas of ST120, ST190 and ST230 are measured to be 15.5, 20.5 and 25.7 m2 g−1, respectively.

Photocatalytic performance
To investigate the photocatalytic properties of the samples after calcination in air, the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange is carried out under UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 12(a), ST230 (TiO2) exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency, which could degrade methyl orange completely in 90 min, while ST190 (TiOF2) could degrade methyl orange completely in 120 min which is better than that of ST120 (HTiOF3). Fig. 12(b) shows the curve of UV-vis spectral evolution over time for ST230. The maximum absorbance intensity of the MO solution gradually decreased with the increase of time, indicating that MO could be degraded by ST230. The enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 could be attributed to the improved crystallinity of the samples, the exposure of active faces and the larger surface area.

Conclusions
The morphology and phase evolution of HTiOF3 assembled hexagonal prisms into {001} faceted TiO2 nanosheets through the intermediate TiOF2 cubic boxes has been elucidated by a three-stage solvothermal synthesis. The reaction time and temperature are key parameters in controlling the evolution of the morphology and phase from HTiOF3 assembled hexagonal prisms into TiO2 nanosheets through TiOF2 cubic boxes. All the different precursors were transformed into TiO2 with different morphologies through calcination under air and the TiO2 nanosheets after calcination exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency, which is attributed to the improved crystallinity and larger surface area. The finding of this work reveals a distinctive formation mechanism of TiO2via precursors HTiOF3 and TiOF2, which are highly significant for obtaining the TiO2 nanosheets with controllable morphologies and excellent properties.
