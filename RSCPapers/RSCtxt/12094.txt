    , Accepted 20th January 2023First published on 3rd February 2023AbstractCross-coupling by dual metal/photoredox catalysis is attractive for producing valuable chemical building blocks, where the photoredox catalysts lay the foundations for an efficient and sustainable operation. Herein a series of imine based hexagonal covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were developed as photoredox platforms to cooperate with a molecular Ni catalyst for the cross-coupling of aryl halides with alcohols. By varying the C2 and/or C3 symmetric molecular subunits, the catalytic performance was effectivity modulated with up to one magnitude difference in the solar-to-coupling product conversion efficiency. Combined (photo)electrochemical measurements and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed the essence of Ni speciation balance to sustain the level of active Ni(I) and the productive coupling cycle. Specifically, 4-[4-(4-formylphenyl)phenyl]benzaldehyde and planar 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline, upon assembling into TT–Ph3 COF, translated to band structures that ensure Ni(II) reduction by conduction band electrons to Ni(I) and minimal off-pathway deactivation, granting the best cross-coupling performance.
1. Introduction
In recent years, metallaphotoredox catalysis that orchestrates light-driven electron/energy transfer and the transition metal mediated construction of carbon–heteroatom bonds has emerged as a powerful approach to building valuable organic building blocks.1–12 Pioneered by iridium photosensitizers, diverse light-harvesting molecules and materials (e.g., organoborons,8 quantum dots,13 and polymeric carbon nitrides9,12) have been developed and implemented in metallaphotoredox catalysis for a broad range of (cross)coupling reactions, aimed at improving solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency, (metal) atomic efficiency and operational simplicity. In metallaphotoredox catalytic C–O or C–N coupling of aryl halides with OH/NH group-containing compounds, Ni(II) is developed as the active site, which is reduced by photogenerated electrons, and then enters a cycle of the oxidative addition (OA) and the reductive elimination (RE) (Scheme 1).3,4,14–16
 Scheme 1  Structural illustration of the hexagonal COF series (TT–Phn) with TT-(C3) and various C2 subunits, together with the working hypothesis for COFs/Ni dual catalysis involving reductive activation of Ni(II), and the Ni(I)/Ni(III) oxidative-addition/reductive-elimination cycle, and off-pathway Ni(I) deactivation. 
With regard to their advantages in terms of stability and separation, heterogeneous photocatalysts promise sustained and less waste-intensive protocols. Moreover, their feasible structural engineering offers a great opportunity to regulate the kinetics of key processes (e.g., reductive metal activation and oxidative addition, Scheme 1) to gain enhanced activity.9–14,17 Cyanamide modification of carbon nitride, for example, with an extended electron lifetime, substantially boosted the C–N and C–O cross-coupling efficiency.9 The surface functionalities of heterogeneous materials (sensitized TiO2,11 C3N4,9,12 or covalent frameworks5) that chemically link the metal catalysts, by promoting electron transfer to reduce the metal catalyst, typically Ni(II) complexes, exhibits faster conversion and turnover number/frequency. Of note, the accumulation of low-valent Ni species may lead to detrimental off-pathway dimerization or precipitation, which highlights the complexity arising from the interplay of multiple processes in dual metal/photoredox catalysis. Designing heterogeneous photoredox catalysts that can maintain the productive catalytic cycle and/or mitigate off-pathway deactivation is important for an efficient and sustained cross-coupling performance.10,15,16
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with ordered spatial arrangements of molecular subunits assembled via covalent bonds, and interlayer stacking, possess distinct energy bands/charge transfer channels.18–22 Variation in the condensation monomers (subunit precursor) furnishes COFs with progressively modulated electronic properties, topological structures and charge transport properties that govern their performance under irradiation.23–29 In imine-based COFs prepared from triphenylaryl-aldehyde and hydrazine (Nx-COFs), enhanced hydrogen evolution activity was observed with an increase in x from 0 to 3, exhibiting strong correlation with the dihedral angle of the C3 monomer. The planar triazine center promoting charge separation/transport also benefited the selective aerobic oxidation of sulfide in olefin based COFs.30 In addition, the C2 monomers of COFs can play important roles.25,26 These studies highlight the potential of COF editing in modulating both photoredox properties and the closely linked metal cycle to gain optimized performance in metallaphotoredox catalysis.
Herein, imine-based hexagonal 2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (TT-)COF series were successfully assembled, featuring phenyl-, biphenyl- or p-terphenyl- as the C2 subunit (Scheme 1, TT–Phn, n = 1–3). A reference COF, TB–Ph1, where the C3 subunit was replaced by 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was also prepared. Using the etherification of aryl bromide as the model reaction (C–O cross-coupling), the subunit-dependent activity was established in their collaboration with a molecular Ni catalyst. Other than the charge separation/transport property, the observed dependency is more relevant to the ability of the assembled COFs to sustain the productive Ni cycle, by activating Ni(II) to Ni(I), and/or inhibiting Ni deactivation. The best-performing TT–Ph3 showed good substrate/functionality capability and well-sustained activity in multiple reaction runs.

Methanol was purchased from J.T.Baker® Avantor VWR Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Ethyl cellulose was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
2.2 Preparation of COFs
All COFs were prepared by a previously published method.31 Taking TT–Ph3 COFs as an example, in a 20 mL pressure tube with a polytetrafluoroethylene vacuum piston, 4,4′,4′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (184 mg, 0.52 mmol) and 4-[4-(4-formylphenyl)phenyl]benzaldehyde (223.1 mg, 0.78 mmol) were dissolved in a ternary solvent mixture of mesitylene/1,4-dioxane/acetic acid (5.1/0.9/0.2 by vol., 12.4 mL). After three freeze–pump–thaw cycles with liquid nitrogen, the tube was degassed completely and filled with argon by a Schlenk line. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 3 days and then cooled down naturally to room temperature. The yellow precipitate was collected, washed with ethanol and DMAc (N,N-dimethylacetamide), and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.
2.3 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical Empyrean, Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation. FTIR (ATR) was measured on a Nicolet 8700 Research FT-IR Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The UV-vis diffuse-reflection spectra (DRS) were recorded on a UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer UH4150 (HITACHI, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured on a HT7700 transmission electron microscope (HITACHI, Japan). For a 13C basic CP/MAS experiment with total suppression of sidebands (CPTOSS), the sample filled a 4 mm rotor, and the spectrum was recorded by a AVANCE III 400 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). ICP-OES was investigated on an iCAP 6300 ICP Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Thermogravimetry (TG) spectra were measured on a TG/DTA 6300 analyser (Seiko, Japan). Gas sorption was detected with an Autosorb iQ sorption analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments, USA).
2.4 General procedures for photocatalytic reactions
In a typical procedure, 5 mg of COF, 5 × 10−3 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O, 5 × 10−3 mmol of 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy), 1.8 mmol of quinuclidine, 1 mmol of aryl bromide and 20 mmol of alcohol (or water) were added to 10 mL of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) with a Teflon magnetic stir bar in a quartz tube. The mixture was sealed, then purged with argon to remove oxygen under magnetic stirring in the dark for at least 10 min. The light source was a 420 nm LED (CEL-LAB200E7, Education Au-Light Co. Ltd., Beijing). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2. All reactions were run under these optimized conditions unless otherwise noted.
2.5 Product analysis
At given reaction time, a 0.7 ml aliquot of reaction solution was sampled, and the catalysts were removed by filtration through a 0.22 μm nylon membrane filter. The filtrate was analyzed on an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) equipped with an HP-5 column (30 m × 320 μm). The conversion/yield was calculated using calibration curves of the corresponding standards.
Product purification was conducted by chromatography with silica gel, eluted with a gradient of 0–20% diethyl ether/hexane to collect the analyte. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR were recorded with Bruker Fourier 300 and Bruker Avance 400 spectrometers. All chemical shifts in the spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm). 1H NMR data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets, br = broad); the number of protons (n) for a given resonance is indicated by nH. Coupling constants are reported as a J value in Hz.
2.6 Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical measurements were tested on an AutoLab Electrochemical Workstation PGSTA302N (Metrohm, Switzerland). To prepare the electrodes, 25 mg of COF and 20 mg of ethyl cellulose were mixed in a bottle and ultrasonicated for one hour. Then 400 μL of the suspension was dripped on a clean FTO glass over a 2 cm × 2 cm area. All tests were conducted in a one compartment cell, with a platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8). A 420 nm LED was used as the light source.
2.7 Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at 90 K on a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer. The samples for EPR measurements were prepared as follows: 10 mg of COF, 0.2 g of quinuclidine, 0.02377 g of NiCl2·6H2O, and 0.01562 g of 2,2′-bipyridine were added to 4.8 mL of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc). After ultrasonicated dispersion for 2 minutes, the mixture was purged with Ar for 5 minutes to remove air; then a 600 μL suspension (kept under stirring) was transferred into an NMR sample tube in a glove box and sealed. Each sample was irradiated by a 420 nm LED lamp for 30 min and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen, and then transferred to the EPR chamber. The center field was calibrated at 3200 G with a 2000 G sweep width. The settings for the receiver gain, modulation amplitude, and attenuation were respectively set at 60 dB, 2 G, and 20 dB (microwave frequency = 9.384–9.398 GHz, power = 2.0 mW). The modulation frequency and scan number were set to 100 kHz and 2, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst characterizations
All COFs were solvothermally synthesized following a previously reported method.31 FTIR spectra of the collected COF samples (Fig. 1a–c and S1†) exhibited the typical stretching vibration of the imine group centered at 1698 cm−1. The stretching/bending vibrations of H–N–H in wavenumber regions of 3200–3450 cm−1 and 1632 cm−1, as well as the CO stretching vibration at 1684–1670 cm−1 of the monomers are absent, corroborating the successful condensation of amine and aldehyde of the corresponding monomers.32–35 Their chemical structures were further described by a 13C basic CP/MAS experiment with total suppression of sidebands (CPTOSS). For TT–Phn, a distinct peak at 170 ppm arises from the triazine carbon atom (Fig. 1d–f and S2†). The 155 ppm peaks were overlapping signals attributed to imine carbon and one of the phenyl carbon atoms linked to the imine nitrogen (group b–c carbon atoms shown in the insets to Fig. 1d–f). Carbon atoms of the phenyl groups give complicated resonance signals between 110 and 150 ppm.23,33

Insets: enlarged patterns at 2θ = 2–10° of the corresponding spectra. 
The crystal structures of the COF series were assessed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD, Fig. 1g–i and S3†). The prominent (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 1.9–2.9° indicate the high crystallinity of the as-prepared COFs. Taking TT–Ph3 as an example, the diffractions at 2θ = 1.9°, 3.4°, 4.0° and 5.3° correspond to the (100), (110), (200) and (210) crystal planes.31,33,36 To further elucidate the lattice packing, all COFs (TB–Ph1 and TT–Phn) lattices were built semi-empirically and optimized.36,37 The peak position and intensity can be replicated using the simulated XRD patterns with AA stacking mode. Pawley refinement patterns coincided well with the experimental PXRD patterns at 2θ = 1–30° with good agreement factors, and gave a series of optimized unit cell parameters (Table S1†). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of all COFs showed piled multi-layer structures (Fig. S4†). The specific surface areas ranged from 7 to 589.5 m2 g−1 (Fig. S5†). Framework stabilities were revealed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles up to 500 °C (Fig. S6†).
The TB–Ph1 and TT–Phn series showed similar broad UV-vis absorption extending to 550–600 nm (Fig. S7†). The optical band gap extracted using the Kubelka–Munk function lies in a narrow range (2.50 eV and 2.46 to 2.59 eV).29 Mott–Schottky measurements revealed the n-type nature of these COFs (Fig. S8†). Taking the extracted flat band potentials as the conduction band levels, the valence band potentials and energy diagrams were obtained (Fig. 2). All the COFs bear sufficient negative conduction (flat band) potential to reduce an Ni catalyst to the active Ni(I), initiating oxidative-addition/reductive-elimination to produce C–O coupling products.38–41

3.2 Visible-light-driven C–O cross-coupling
Next these COF variants, in collaboration with Ni catalyst (1:1 NiCl2·6H2O and 2,2′-bipyridine), were used to catalyse coupling of 4-bromobenzonitrile with methanol under 420 nm irradiation (light absorbances at the irradiation wavelengths of all the synthesized COFs were close). Table 1 summarizes the results under standard conditions (0.5 g L−1 COFs, 0.5% equivalent of Ni catalyst and 1.8 equivalent of quinuclidine; please see the condition optimization in the ESI,† Tables S2–S5). For TB–Ph1, 9.3% of 4-methoxybenzonitrile (1) was produced with 100% selectivity after 5 h (the yield reached 21% by extending the reaction time to 10 h). With reference to TB–Ph1, TT–Ph1 gave a much higher product yield of 67.4% under otherwise identical conditions (Table 1, entry 2). Replacing phenyl (Ph1) by biphenyl (Ph2) resulted in a further enhancement in product yield (87.2%, Table 1, entry 3); and TT–Ph3 assembled using p-terphenyl (Ph3) as the C2 monomer demonstrated the best performance, yielding 94% of 1 (Table 1, entry 4, where the TON is 188 and the quantum yield is estimated to be 1.26%). The pseudo-first-order rate constants of the TT–Phn/Ni-mediated reaction further confirmed activity dependent on a C2 subunit (0.25 h−1, 0.44 h−1, 0.58 h−1, with n increasing from 1 to 3, Fig. S9†). Impressively, under 450 nm irradiation, TT–Ph3/Ni produced 24% of 1 despite its slightly larger bandgap, while the other two were inactive (Fig. S10†). The superior performance of TT–Ph3/Ni was also established in the hydroxylation of 4-bromobenzonitirle, affording the corresponding phenol in 61.7% yield, much higher than the yields in reactions catalysed by Ni with TT–Ph1 or TT–Ph2 (28.0% and 23.5%, Table S6†).

The reaction of 4-bromonitrozile and methanol was systematically evaluated under different conditions (Table 2). Visible irradiation, COFs, nickel salt, and quinuclidine were indispensable (Table 2, entries 2–4). 2,2′-Bipyridine (Table 2, entry 5) was also essential as the Ni ligand.42 The reaction with ≥10 equivalents of methanol exclusively produced 1; with a lower amount of MeOH, there were hydroxylation side product (Table S2†). The desired C–O coupling process correlated positively with temperature, and over 99% yield could be obtained above 313 K (Tables 2, entry 7 and S7†). As an aside, the temperature of the actual reaction was between 316 and 320 K (Fig. S11†). The catalysis was indeed heterogeneous, as confirmed by a hot filtration test (Table 2, entry 8).

The robustness of TT–Ph3 was also supported by its structural integrity after photoreduction. The XRD (Fig. S12†) and FTIR (Fig. S13†) patterns before and after the reaction showed no significant changes, which proved that the crystal structure and imine bonds of the COFs were preserved. Particulate species (less than 5 nm in diameter) were observed on the catalyst surface by TEM (Fig. S14†), and further EDX mapping suggested they are aggregated Ni (Fig. S15 and S16†). In addition to deposited nickel black, partial oxidation of the catalyst surface was observed after the reaction (0.93% to 16.89% via EDX-counted mass of the elements), but it did not affect the catalytic activity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S17†) displays Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks at 856.0 and 873.3 eV (satellite peaks at 862.5 and 880.9 eV) for Ni(II), together with 850.9 and 868.6 eV peaks for metallic Ni(0) (about 19%). It should be noted that the deposited Ni is not active for cross-coupling (Table S5,† entry 6). Nonetheless, the performance of TT–Ph3 was not affected and its high activity was sustained over five consecutive runs with a supply of Ni(II) (and bpy ligand) (Fig. S18†).
3.3 Origins of the activity dependency on COF subunits
An Ni/photoredox dual catalysis mechanism has been widely recognized for light-driven speciation evolution to form a C–O bond (Scheme 1). In a nutshell, quinuclidine devoured the photogenerated holes during irradiation, and the photogenerated electrons were available for the reduction of Ni(II) (ligated to bipyridine) to the active Ni(I) state. Ni(I) undergoes oxidative addition to aryl bromides, converting to BrNi(III)Ar, followed by –Br/–OR exchange and an energetically favoured reductive elimination, affording Ar–OR. However, the off-pathway deactivation of Ni(I) to Ni black proceeds alongside.
As shown in Fig. S7,† the light-harvesting efficiencies at the irradiation wavelengths of all the COF variants were quite close; and their photogenerated (conduction band) electrons can readily reduce the Ni(II) catalyst to trigger the Ni(I)/Ni(III) (oxidative addition–reductive elimination) cycle that forges C–O bonds. However, according to the onset oxidation potential of quinuclidine (1.1 VNHE),15 which supplies the reductive equivalents for Ni reduction (activation), the TB–Ph1 (EVB = 1.07 VNHE) mediated photoredox cycle is less favoured due to the thermodynamically uphill hole trapping and rapid non-productive charge recombination, which partially account for the low activity. All other COFs would enable smooth photoredox turnovers. In particular, TT–Ph3 bearing a deeper valence band is expected to enable faster hole trapping and more available reducing equivalents for Ni(II) to Ni(I) conversion.
To shed light on the Ni species evolution in the dual catalysis, semi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was conducted for TT–Phn/Ni/quinuclidine under irradiation in the absence of aryl bromide. As shown in Fig. 3a, a sharp g = 2.003 signal was observed for all COF variants, characteristic of the intrinsic localized electrons (in line with their n-type feature).43,44 An additional broad, anisotropic S = 1/2 signal in the g = 2.319 to g = 2.039 region appeared after irradiation; a g-tensor with close-to-axial principal values, [gxx, gyy] = [2.231, 2.114], pointing to monomeric Ni(I) with 3d9 configuration (the gzz value is shielded by the strong signal of photogenerated electrons at g = 2.003).45–47 TT–Ph3 exhibited the most notable Ni(I) signal followed by TT–Ph2, while TT–Ph1 barely showed an Ni(I) band. The higher level of Ni(I) in TT–Ph3 can be attributed to the valence band position (discussed above), which is beneficial for the oxidative addition to aryl halides and the productive Ni cycle. On the other hand, the deactivation processes in the three catalytic systems were estimated by the amount of Ni deposited in the recycled COFs. It was found that TT–Ph3 contained a much lower level of precipitated Ni black (0.3 wt%) than TT–Ph1 and TT–Ph2 (1.1% and 2.4%, Table S8†). Considering the Ni(I)/Ni(0) reduction potential (−1.05 to −1.25 VNHE) and the COF conduction potentials (−1.13 to −1.2 VNHE), the lower conduction band potential of TT–Ph3 might account for a less favored Ni(I) to Ni(0) conversion and the subsequent aggregation. Although the minimal Ni deposited in TT–Ph3 could also be related to its larger interior surface that decreases the probability of Ni(I)–Ni(I) disproportionation followed by metallic Ni aggregation/deactivation, the difference in the surface area (Fig. S5†) does not correspond to the activity (Table 1 and Fig. S9†), thus surface area is considered not to be the primary influencing factor for Ni speciation. Taken together, the interfacial charge transfer and balance of Ni speciation are essential for the well-cooperating and sustained dual catalytic cycles.

We further conducted transient photocurrent measurements to evaluate the charge separation/transport property of the COF variants (Fig. 3d). TB–Ph1 demonstrates lower photocurrent density than TT–Ph1, which is consistent with the charge transport facilitated by the higher degree of COF conjugation and better crystallinity of planar TT-COFs (the dihedral angle of the TT-molecule is 0°, while the value for TB- is 38.7°).23 However, the most active TT–Ph3 demonstrated the lowest photocurrent density in the TT–Phn series. The poor correlation of photocurrent density with activity implies that charge separation/transport is a subordinate process in dual COFs/Ni catalysis, trumped by an interfacial charge transfer process in the reaction studied here.
The results presented here collectively suggested for the COFs/Ni-catalysed C–O coupling that the performance was defined predominantly by the interfacial charge transfer processes that govern the Ni speciation under reaction conditions; the internal charge transport properties played a less important role. The energy band position is important to ensure the well-balanced formation and consumption of Ni(I) (by oxidative-addition) via interfacial electron transfer, to sustain both the photoredox and Ni cycles that are essential for efficient metallaphotoredox catalysis.
3.4 Photocatalytic substrate scope
With the best-performing TT–Ph3 recognized, we investigated the substrate scope of TT–Ph3/Ni. Good to excellent isolated yields (78–92%) of C–O coupling products were obtained for most aryl bromides with an electron-deficient group in the para-position. Various functional groups, such as nitrile, carbonyl, and ester were all compatible with the photocatalytic protocol (Table 3, 1–5). 5-Methoxypyridine-2-carbonitrile (6) was produced in a moderate yield of 62% in the reaction of methanol with a heteroarene bromide, 5-bromo-2-cyanopyridine. Substrates bearing an electron-donating methoxy group in the para position showed poor conversion to 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (7), even with the more easily activated aryl iodide (0.7% for 4-bromoanisole, 0.8% for 4-iodoanisole, 20 h). We also scrutinized the scope of the alcohol partners. Under standard conditions, primary alcohols, including trifluoroethanol, ethanol and benzyl alcohol, underwent smooth coupling with 4-bromobenzonitrile, with 88–93% yield of the corresponding ethers 4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzonitrile (8), 4-ethoxybenzonitrile (9) and 4-benzyloxybenzonitrile (12). The reaction with isopropanol gave a relatively lower isolated yield (62%) of 4-isopropoxybenzonitrile (10). Hydroxylation of 4-bromobenzonitrile also proceeded successfully, with 62% 4-hydroxybenzonitrile (11, GC yield) produced in the presence of 20 equivalents of water. When phenol was used, biphenyl ether product 4-phenoxybenzonitrile was produced (GC yield 13.1%) after 20 h of irradiation (14). Pyrrolidine was also tested as a N-coupling partner (13), and 97% 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl)benzonitrile was obtained.

Conclusions
In summary, imine-based COFs were successfully assembled from TT- and C2 symmetric –Ph1–3 monomers. These COF variants are attractive photoredox catalysts to work with an Ni catalyst, forging carbon–oxygen bonds from various aryl bromides and alcohols/water under mild conditions. Variation of the C3/C2 subunits resulted in different band energy diagrams and interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics/kinetics, which determines the Ni speciation that is relevant to the productive cycle as well as deactivation. TT–Ph3, with balanced interfacial charge transfer processes, well sustains the dual photoredox/Ni cycles, offering the best performance in light-driven C–O coupling. Future work will focus on the design of the next generation of integrated heterogeneous COF platforms with novel metal sites that are resistant to deactivation.
