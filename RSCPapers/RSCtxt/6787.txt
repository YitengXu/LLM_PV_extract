    , Accepted 23rd May 2018First published on 25th May 2018AbstractOver the past few decades, owing to their unique functional properties such as physical, chemical, optical and electronic properties, spinel materials have attracted significant scientific attention in heterogeneous photocatalyst research. Here, we review the main fundamental understanding of the correlations between the performance of spinel structures and their particle shape, size, chemical composition, and photo-Fenton reactions for photocatalytic applications; these include photocatalytic dye degradation for environmental remediation, photocatalytic hydrogen generation, CO2 reduction and photoelectrochemical water splitting. In addition, the key factors and essential strategies to improve their performance and functionality are discussed in detail. Future research pathways and perspectives on the progress of these high performance and cost effective renewable energy materials are provided, along with the improvements in material properties that are necessary to replace current commercial energy materials. It is envisioned that further investigations should focus on surface modification, integrating conductive matrixes and regulating the spinel composition, which will make spinels promising photocatalysts.Sundaram ChandrasekaranDr Sundaram Chandrasekaran received his Ph.D degree in 2013 from Gandhigram Rural University, India.

1. Introduction
Energy conversion and storage have attracted significant scientific and engineering interest as an important step to efficiently use clean and renewable energy, in particular for intermittent energy supplies.1,2 As a green and promising technology, energy conversion using semiconducting metal oxide photocatalysts has the potential to utilize clean and naturally abundant sunlight as an energy source, for the remediation of environmental pollutants by degradation and clean energy generation such as hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) production from water and reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2).3 Recently, these materials have attracted extensive interest in the fields of energy materials and environmental chemistry.4–8 Approximately 60 years ago, the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide (TiO2) was reported by Markham.9 However, a seminal note published in Nature in 1972 by Fujishima and Honda10 led to remarkable progress with respect to the potential of titania for water splitting, which is a potential candidate due to its photoactive properties, low cost, and durability. However, the wide band gap of TiO2 limits its use to harvest the ultraviolet (UV) region only. In order to harvest the whole solar spectrum including UV and visible regions, several types of semiconducting metal oxides have been examined, including d0 and d10 metal configuration based oxides, plasmonic materials, sulfides, nitrides, oxy-nitrides, etc.11–14 To date, no photocatalytic material completely fulfills all the practical necessities for successful operation which include high durability, an optimum narrow band gap for full utilization of the complete solar spectrum, long lifetime of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, low cost, eco-friendly nature, high efficiency and stability.15 Hence, it is utmost essential to develop well-organized and visible-light-driven photocatalytic materials with long term durability via optimizing existing synthesis strategies through coalescing the photocatalyst with low cost metal or metal oxide co-catalysts, and fashioning appropriate heterojunctions.16,17 Normally, the strategies to modify heterogeneous photocatalysts for enhanced activity include structural and chemical compositional optimization.18,19 The photocatalytic chemical reactions for heterogeneous photocatalysis occur mainly at the surface of the semiconductor material. The photocatalytic properties of semiconducting materials are highly reliant on their crystalline structure and nanometer sized structural features.20,21 Thus, the optimization and control of the structural properties of a known metal oxide semiconductor are essential to enhance photocatalytic activity. Till date, a number of promising nano- and micro-sized material structures and structural engineering approaches have been proposed to create efficient photocatalytic systems.22,23
One interesting class of materials that have the potential to meet these challenges includes nanostructured spinel oxides which include normal and inverse spinels, which have been shown to fulfill the demands described above. Compared to other materials, spinels revealed potential benefits of high energy density, and thus spinel structured materials have attracted great attention in energy conversion and storage applications.24 This interest originates from their ease of fabrication and their structural, physical and chemical properties can be readily tuned and optimized for a desired application. This can lead to low cost, efficient, eco-friendly, and versatile material systems for solar water splitting and environmental remediation (such as dye degradation).17,25
Notably, the mesoporous nature associated with the large surface area of hierarchical spinel structured low band gap photocatalysts is beneficial to (i) improve the light harvesting efficiency (ii) improve the rate of adsorption of reactants and (iii) ease the transport of guest species to the binding sites, as shown in Fig. 1. With these features, to date, a great variety of reports have described the fabrication of spinel materials with manifold porous structures and enhanced efficiency. Despite some excellent reviews devoted to spinels, only a small portion of studies refer to their preparation and applications in photocatalysis,17,26 photoelectrochemistry27,28 and environmental remediation.29 Thus, we believe that a broad and inspiring appraisal on this subject is timely to promote further growth in this significant, stimulating and emerging area of spinels for their application in photocatalysis and environmental remediation.

In this comprehensive review, we summarize recent advances in the area of nanostructured spinel materials for a range of photocatalytic applications. A distinct emphasis of the review is that it aims to provide a better understanding of the fundamental design, fabrication, mechanisms, performance and applications of both spinel oxides (normal and inverse spinels) for photocatalytic applications. The advantages of structural differences in spinel oxides are initially discussed in the context of spinel oxide based photocatalysis. The strategies to enhance the performance of spinels are then presented. We will review various applications with consistent mechanisms of spinel photocatalysts for the degradation of pollutants, H2 production, CO2 reduction and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Finally, future research challenges to improve the efficiency of the material systems are discussed.
2. Types and significance of spinels
Depending on the nature of crystalline structures, spinels are classified into two types, namely normal (or regular) spinels and inverse spinels.
2.1 Normal or regular spinel structures
Normal spinel structures have the general elemental formula of AB2X4, where A and B in the spinel structures can be divalent and trivalent (or tetravalent) cations respectively,30 for instance the A site represents the atom that has a valence of two including any one metal ion such as Cu(II), Zn(IV), Cd(IV), Mg(IV), Ni(IV), Co(IV), Fe(IV), Mn(IV), Ba(VI), Ca(VI), etc., and the B site represents the atom that has a valence of three including any one metal ion such as Ga(VI), In(VI), Cr(VI), Mn(VI), Al(VI), Zn(VI), Sn(IV), etc. Typically, octahedral interstices are larger than tetrahedral sites. Thus, smaller radius cations prefer to occupy the A sites, whereas larger radius cations prefer to occupy the B sites, i.e. simply, A and B are tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated cations in the spinel structure, respectively. Moreover, X can be either a chalcogenide or oxide. In regular (normal) spinel structures, the anions are arranged in close-packed arrays, as shown in Fig. 2. During the formation of the spinel, the A-site cations fill 1/8 of the tetrahedral holes and the B-site cations fill 1/2 of the octahedral holes; where the divalent AII ions fill the tetrahedral spaces and the trivalent BIII ions fill the octahedral spaces in a close packed arrangement of oxide ions. A regular spinel structure can be denoted as: (AII)tet(BIII)2octO4, e.g. ZnFe2O4, Mn3O4, FeCr2O4 (chromite) or MgAl2O4.

Atomic positions are exposed for the primitive unit cell only. Lattice arrangements and the nearest neighbors for (b) the tetrahedral A-site (8a), where the anion dilations are shown by solid blue colored arrows. (c) The octahedral B-site (16d), and (d) the tetrahedral anion X-site (32e), inspired by ref. 30. 
2.2 Inverse spinels
Inverse spinel structures are described by (B(AB)O4), where the divalent AII cations fill the octahedral voids (i.e. valence two metals), and half of the BIII ions (i.e. valence three metals) fill the tetrahedral voids. This spinel structure can be written as: (BIII)tet(AIIBIII)octO4, such as Fe3O4 (ferrite), CoFe2O4, or NiFe2O4. Inverse spinel structures can also be denoted as: CoFe2O4 = FeIII(CoIIFeIII)O4, Fe3O4 = FeIII(FeIIFeIII)O4 or NiFe2O4 = FeIII(NiIIFeIII)O4. In the inverse spinel structure, the number of octahedral sites occupied can be well-ordered or random, where the random occupation of cations leads to spinel defects in the structure. For example, NiAl2O4 can be written as (Al0.75Ni0.25)tet[Ni0.75Al1.25]octaO4; another example of a defective spinel is γ-Al2O3. The spinel structures of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have long been of scientific and technological importance. The cubic spinel structured MFe2O4, or MO·Fe2O3, represents a well-known and important class of iron oxide materials where oxygen forms a face centered cubic close packing, and M2+ and Fe3+ occupy either tetrahedral or octahedral interstitial sites. By adjusting the chemical identity of M2+, the magnetic configurations of MFe2O4 can be engineered to provide a wide range of magnetic properties. Depending on the M2+ cations (where M = Co, Li, Ni, Zn, etc.),31,32 spinels can either have high magnetic permeability and electrical resistivity or half-metallicity (for M = Fe).33,34 For instance, bulk ZnFe2O4 with a normal spinel structure exhibits a weak anti-ferromagnetic behavior with ∼10.5 K Neel-temperature,35,36 whereas epitaxial ZnFe2O4 thin films reveal a higher Neel temperature of about ∼43 K.37 However, recent investigations disclose that nanocrystalline ZnFe2O4 shows ferrimagnetic behavior with partial inversion of the spinel structure,38i.e. the extra occupation of tetrahedral A sites by Fe and octahedral B sites by Zn is most significant to a strong superexchange pairing of the intra sublattice Fe ions.39,40 Thus, the ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles are responsible for the hysteresis loop upon magnetization reversal. For easy comparison, the structural classifications are presented in Table 1.

2.3 Photocatalytic and PEC mechanisms
Typically, there are four familiar types of photocatalysis, specifically (i) plant photosynthesis (ii) microalgae photosynthesis (iii) photocatalysis by suspension and (iv) photoelectrochemical analysis or photoelectrocatalysis using photoelectrodes. Complete investigations of photocatalysts and assimilated photocatalytic schemes have been used to shed light on the dissimilar work functions of each constituent in an operational photocatalyst. Mainly, pollutant degradation and energy conversion by photocatalytic materials are of significant practical interest, and extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing novel photocatalysts to enhance the efficiency, especially under visible light. Photocatalysis is a process in which light absorption by a photocatalytic material results in the generation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which are then transported to other molecules at the surface of the photocatalyst. During this photocatalytic reaction, if the reduction–oxidation (redox) potential lies below the conduction band (CB) of the photocatalytic material, the electron can be transported to an acceptor molecule, whereas the hole can be transported to a donor if its redox potential lies above the valence band of the photocatalyst. A schematic of the photocatalytic mechanism is presented in Fig. 1. As an example, the stages typically involved in a photocatalytic reaction process are (i) generation of electron–hole pairs by light absorption (ii) separation of excited charge (iii) electron and hole transfer to the photocatalyst surface (iv) electron and hole recombination and (v) use of charges on the surface for redox reactions.
One of the least complex applications of photocatalysis is to simply suspend a photocatalyst in an electrolyte solution and expose it to light. Photocatalysts are mostly nanosized and/or micro-photocatalyst materials which can be considered as an integrated system consisting of a photoanode and/or photocathode for a photo-electro-chemical (PEC) system. In a PEC system, oxidation and reduction are the basic electrochemical reactions that occur during water splitting. Primarily, when a PEC semiconductor photoelectrode device with a well-defined set of functional properties is immersed in an electrolyte solution and irradiated with light, the photon (light) energy is converted into electrochemical energy that can split water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). For excellent H2 and O2 evolution reactions, the positions of the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the semiconductor photoelectrode are required to fit into the water reduction and oxidation potential region, respectively. Upon light irradiation, the excited electrons favor hydrogen generation, whereas oxygen is generated by holes.
The overall solar water splitting includes two half reactions taking place at the photoanode and/or photocathode instantaneously, as detailed below: 2H2O + hν → 2H2 + O2(1) 4H+ + 4e− → 2H2(2) 2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2(3)
It is well documented that nanostructured spinel catalysts are potential alternative materials to noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, enhanced activity at low temperature, eco-friendly nature, abundance and resistance to poisoning. From the aspect of environmental concerns, the major chemical wastes of hazardous materials from industries were found to affect aquatic and human life. Hence, it is necessary to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly methods to remove them from aqueous solution. The most effective pathway is to use spinel photocatalytic materials to solve this environmental problem.
3. Photocatalytic environmental remediation using spinels
The contamination of water resources by a range of potentially toxic dyes from industrial wastes such as plastic, paper, leather, cosmetics, chemicals and textiles has been considered an ecological problem. Many dyes used by commercial industries are synthetic complexes of aromatic molecules, which are highly stable pollutants and challenging in terms of achieving biodegradation. In this regard, dye degradation by photocatalytic processes has been widely explored using TiO2-based materials under UV irradiation.41,42 However, a disadvantage of TiO2 for this application is that it is active only under UV light illumination due to its wide band gap; it is impotent to harvest the incoming whole solar spectrum fully. In order to overcome this issue, using photocatalytic materials of metal oxide semiconductors is considered to be an alternative and environmentally benign approach. Various semiconductors have been verified as photocatalysts due to their photo-stability, non-toxicity, ease of use and low cost.18,43,44 Among them, gahnite (ZnAl2O4) is a face-centered cubic spinel-structured oxide, which has good chemical and thermal stability, large mechanical resistance and short surface acidity. In 2014, Battiston et al.45 reported the synthesis of ZnAl2O4 by co-precipitation. The photocatalytic activity was assessed by organic pollutant degradation (direct black 38 dye) in an aqueous solution under sunlight. Owing to its good thermal stability, the mesoporous zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4) particles exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity at an initial concentration of ∼80 mg L−1, which has been further verified by other research groups.46,47
Later, another class of metal oxides, spinel ferrites (MFe2O4), capable of utilizing a major portion of the incoming solar spectrum, was studied due to their energy gap being appropriate for absorbing visible light, see Table 1. These spinels are attractive for photocatalytic reactions due to the spinel nature and their exceptional optical, chemical and electrical properties. For example, Zhang et al.48 reported the production of radical species from peroxymonosulfate (PMS) using the CuFe2O4 spinel. A strong pollutant of iopromide was used as a model system and during the reaction, as a result of its crystalline nature, CuFe2O4 exhibited a greater activity of ∼1 mol mol−1 for oxalate degradation and it exhibited about ∼30 times lower Cu2+ leaching (1.5 μg L−1 per 100 mg L−1) than well-crystallized CuO at the same dosage, as shown in Fig. 3. The radicals of sulfates were described as the primary radical species responsible for iopromide degradation.

3.1 Reaction kinetics of spinel photocatalysts
The understanding of the reaction kinetics and mechanism of the photocatalytic activity is essential to enhance the performance. It is well known that photocatalytic oxidation and/or reduction have the benefit that habitually converts pollutants in water, carbon dioxide and inorganic materials through a facile way. Usually, during photocatalytic reactions, when the photocatalyst absorbs illuminated radiation from sun or a light source, it will create pairs of electrons and holes on its surface. The valence band electron of the photocatalyst becomes excited when illuminated by light. The excess energy of this excited electron directs the electron to the conduction band of photocatalysts, thus generating a negative-electron (e−) and positive-hole (h+) pair. The positive-hole of photocatalysts breaks apart the water molecule (or waste products, toxins and pollutants) to produce hydrogen gas and hydroxyl radicals. The negative-electron reacts with the oxygen molecule to create a super oxide anion. This reaction cycle persists when light is available. The possible products during the photocatalytic activity are shown in the following equations:49–51 AB2O4 + hν → AB2O4 (h+VB) + AB2O4 (eCB−)(4) O2 + AB2O4 (e−CB) → O2˙−(5) O2˙− + H+ → HO2˙(6) HO2˙ +O2˙− → HO2− + O2(7) 2HO2˙ → O2 + H2O2(8) H2O2 + hν → 2OH˙(9) H2O2 + e−CB → OH− + OH˙(10)
These are the basic reactions that can be useful to increase the photocatalytic activity through the understanding of reaction mechanisms. In eqn (4), “A” represents the divalent and “B” represents the trivalent (or tetravalent) cations. In addition, the spinel-type compounds of zinc chromite (ZnCr2O4)52 and zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4)53 were successfully used for the removal of dyes from wastewater via photocatalytic processes. The basic photocatalytic mechanism of ZnCr2O4 was described by the following equations: ZnCr2O4 + hν → h+ + e−(11) h+ + OH−→ OH (hydroxyl radicals)(12) OH + O2− (active oxygen species) + organic substances (such as dyes) → CO2 + H2O(13)
Moreover, the band gap of ZnCr2O4 was estimated to be ∼3.35 eV and ∼3.96 eV by UV-visible and luminescence spectroscopy respectively.54 This makes this particular material only responsive to UV light irradiation, as with the TiO2 band gap (∼3.2 eV). The wide band gap of ZnCr2O4 can be more active under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (λ < 387 nm), but this represents only ∼5% of the total solar energy. Therefore, doping of the material with transition-metal cations or organic materials, such as graphene, is necessary to extend its activity when illuminated by visible light. Among the various ferrites, MgFe2O4, a member of the spinel family, has a wide range of applications including electronic devices, heterogeneous catalysis, and sensor technologies.55 The excellent physical and chemical behavior of ferrite spinels makes them favorable candidates for photocatalytic applications. A number of studies on the photooxidation of methylene blue in aqueous solution using MgFe2O4 powder irradiated with UV (350 nm) and visible-light (>420 nm) and photo-electro-chemical water splitting experiments under visible light have been reported.56
The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of organic based impurities by semiconducting MgFe2O4 is the same as eqn (4). In this reaction, the semiconductor materials (e.g. MgFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, ZnCr2O4, etc.,) initially absorb incident light and, as a result of photoexcitation, an electron–hole pair is produced at the surface of the semiconducting photocatalyst; see eqn (4) and (11). During the photocatalytic dye degradation process, the high oxidation potential of the holes (h+CB) leads to the direct oxidation of the organic matter (such as a dye) and reactive and/or volatile intermediates are produced through the following route (eqn (14)): h+(VB) + dye → dye˙+ → dye oxidation(14)
Then, hydroxyl radicals (i.e. highly reactive species) can also be produced by either breakdown of H2O (eqn (15)) or by reaction of a hydroxyl ion (OH−) with a hole (eqn (16)).2,57 h+(VB) + H2O → H+ + ˙OH(15) h+(VB) + OH− → ˙OH(16)
During the above reactions, the produced hydroxyl radicals are usually highly oxidative and non-specific with a redox potential of E0 ∼ +3.06 V. If the hydroxide radicals react with organic compounds, incomplete or complete mineralization of organic compounds can occur. Further, superoxide anions are also produced by the reduction of oxygen molecules (eqn (10)), which can take place by the presence of electrons in the conduction band at the photocatalyst surface. Then, the existence of organic based scavengers leads to the creation of organic peroxides or hydrogen peroxide molecules with the use of radical peroxide anions. From these reactions it was confirmed that the conduction band electrons are also responsible for the generation of radicals of hydroxyl species, which have been validated as the main cause of organic complex degradation.
In contrast, it was found that for spinels of MgFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4, and orthorhombic CaFe2O4, the photocatalytic activity was found to be affected by the surface area and crystallinity of the photocatalyst.58 Also, it was evidenced that spinel structured materials are promising candidates for a range of applications59 including sustainable hydrogen production, catalysis, and electronic and magnetic device fabrication. Later, copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc and several mixed-metal and core–shell spinels have been applied in catalytic reactions.60 Most of them belong to the photo-Fenton process, which is now discussed below.
3.2 Photo-Fenton process on spinels
In the 1890s, Henry John Horstman Fenton developed a Fenton's reagent. This solution contains a catalyst of iron (Fe) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for environmental remediation and is used to oxidize pollutants or waste water.61 Fenton's reagent can be used to remove organic compounds such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). During the reaction, Fe2+ is oxidized by H2O2 into Fe3+, forming a hydroxyl radical and hydroxyl ion. Furthermore, the Fe3+ ion is then reduced back to Fe2+ by hydrogen peroxide, forming a hydroperoxyl radical and a proton as shown in the reactions below: Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + HO˙ + OH−(17) Fe3+ + H2O2 → Fe2+ + HOO˙ + H+(18)
Nowadays, photo-Fenton reactions have been advanced, which have the potential for the degradation of toxic chemicals, and have been considered in the presence or absence of ligands, which have been complexed to Fe(II) or Fe(III). Among the various materials, ferrite based spinel photocatalysts have attracted attention since their heterogeneous nature and iron (Fe) offer the possibility for catalyst reuse and ferrite catalysts can enrich the oxidizing power of photo-Fenton type reactions. Spinels are environmentally benign, inexpensive, and abundantly available. As extremely stable metal oxide photocatalysts with narrow band gaps, they have the potential to harvest the whole solar spectrum to degrade a variety of toxins and contaminants. This significant feature favors the development of the photocatalytic process of spinels for developing an efficient photochemical system for the purification of water and air.62
It is well known that combining photocatalysts in different mixtures and ratios leads to variable results, which are subject to the conditions used.17 Photocatalytic materials utilize photon energy (hν) to execute oxidation and reduction reactions. When the photocatalytic reaction occurs in aqueous solutions, water (H2O) and hydroxide ions (such as NaOH, KOH, etc.) react with photogenerated h+ to generate hydroxyl radicals (.OH); see eqn (15) and (16). The process of generating hydroxyl radicals can occur through two pathways; initially the oxygen (O2) present in water is reduced to form O2˙−, which then reacts with hydrogen (H+) to form ˙OOH, followed by rapid decomposition to ˙OH. The second pathway involves the oxidation of OH−. During this reaction the band gap of the photocatalyst determines the wavelength of light energy that can be absorbed. In this case, spinel ferrites are recognized to be effective photocatalysts and it was reported63 that ferrites can be effective in Fenton-type systems at neutral to basic pH and the MnFe2O4, CuFe2O4, CoFe2O4, and Fe3O4 spinels exhibited the production of ˙OH from H2O2 at pH = 4–8. In some cases the effective pH range can be extended further and depends on the chemical composition, for instance CuFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 are able to generate ˙OH at pH = 12 whereas this happens for MnFe2O4 at pH = 2. This is a significant improvement over the normal restrictive acidic conditions needed (pH = 2–4) for a classical Fenton system. Arifin et al.64 examined the solar thermal splitting CO2 cycle using nanosized CoFe2O4 and FeAl2O4 spinels. It was observed that the CO2 oxidation kinetics was slightly slower than the O2 oxidation kinetics in the CoFe2O4-coated Al2O3 system.
Recently, a Fenton-like nano-photocatalyst of Pt coupled ZnFe2O4 was reported by Kuan-Ting Lee et al.65 This photocatalyst shortened the photodegradation treatment time for Rhodamine B (RhB) to seconds from hours when exposed to visible light. The maximum reaction rate constant was 9.31 min−1 (where the RhB concentration was ∼5 ppm). In addition, the magnetic behavior is another benefit of spinel ferrite photocatalysts, which makes these materials easy to recover from the catalytic systems after the reaction finished, which is particularly useful for facile recycle of the catalyst.
Normally, spinel structures allow different metallic ions to enter their host lattice, thus modifying their structural, chemical, electrical and catalytic properties. The sharing of cations over the tetrahedral and octahedral sites is influenced by several factors such as substituent ion size, charge influenced by the substituent ion, atomic site preference of the substituent ion, synthetic strategy, conditions and the amount of substitute ions. A number of publications have reported the alteration of spinels via different methods66–70 to enhance the activity and performance of the final spinel materials.71 From the aspect of morphology control, compared with nanosphere and flower shaped ZnFe2O4 spinels, one-dimensional ZnFe2O4 porous nanorods with a diameter of 60 nm showed excellent photocatalytic degradation of Safranine-O (SO) and anionic Remazol Brilliant Yellow (RBY) dyes.72 The enhanced photoactivity was mainly due to the narrow band gap, as well as the nano-voids present in the assembled 1D nanorods which resulted in a porous structure with a high specific surface area. Futhermore, a micropeony structured ZnIn2S4 spinel was also used to promote the photo-degradation of methylene blue (MB).73 This peony structure revealed a high surface area with a specific benefit to prevent the combination of electrons and holes and thus improved the photocatalytic activity. As a result, 99.98% MB dye degradation was observed at ∼90 min for nano/micropeony structured ZnIn2S4. It was observed that these structural features might exhibit stronger absorbability and better photocatalytic reaction activity that increase the dye degradation efficiency. Also, photocatalysts of mixed-metals74–76 and heterostructures of core–shell spinels77–79 were used to enhance the dye degradation efficiency.
Spinel photocatalysts have been gaining particular research attention due to their unique structural, optical and catalytic properties. However, owing to their wide band gaps, some spinel photocatalysts still exhibit poor absorption in the visible light region and low electron–hole charge separation efficiency. In order to enhance the photocatalytic activity, the fundamental understanding of chemical physics behind spinels is crucial. Likewise, the appropriate choice of the synthesis method and selecting the appropriate materials for intrinsic doping such as carbon materials and/or other metals will control the particle size, band gap, optimum chemical composition with well-defined crystalline nature and also the morphology, thereby enhancing the performance of the final photocatalyst (see Section 7).
4. Clean energy generation by spinels
4.1 Hydrogen production by spinel photocatalysts
Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution by direct water splitting or by using sacrificial agents and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction are of interest in the energy conversion process. In a simplified form of water splitting, H2O is being reduced and oxidized at the same time, producing an oxidized product of O2 and reduced product of H2. Typically, it is common to introduce sacrificial reagents that would either afford electrons or holes to facilitate the overall water splitting reactions. Recently, using highly active electrocatalysts as co-catalysts has been recognized as an effective method to reduce the overpotential of water splitting; namely the splitting of H2O into H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 under light illumination in the presence of a photocatalyst. In this respect, a number of different metal oxide photocatalysts have been investigated.80–83 However, the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for practical application is typically low due to the need to overcome some important obstacles such as efficiency and long term durability. On the other hand, H2 production efficiency can be enhanced using high cost sacrificial agents (such as alcohols and glycerol).82 Hence, the research community has been recently focusing on spinels, since they have relatively narrow band gaps, large surface area, are easy to fabricate and are cost effective. To improve the efficiency for photocatalytic hydrogen production, methodologies similar to those for other photocatalytic applications have been used for spinels, namely porosity and surface area modification, optimization of the crystallinity, doping, and heterostructure formation.84
Lu et al.85 reported on hydrogen generation by H2S photodecomposition on a ZnFe2O4 photocatalyst. The system consisted of a dispersed photocatalyst, which was irradiated with visible light under different conditions. As a result, a high hydrogen generation rate of around ∼0.025 mL h−1 mg−1 was achieved. In that study, the dependences of H2 production rate on solution pH and sulfide concentration were also studied, remarkably the ZnFe2O4 spinel powder showed an excellent performance for H2S photodecomposition at pH = 8–12. Dom et al.86 prepared ZnFe2O4 spinels by various methods such as solid state reaction (SSR), polymer complex (PC), microwave sintering (μW) and self-propagating combustion (SPC) methods, as shown in Fig. 4, and a more negative flat band potential of ∼−0.543 vs. NHE and a high quantum yield of ∼0.19% for hydrogen evolution were observed for the microwave sample, i.e. ZnFe2O4 prepared by the microwave sintering method showed the best performance.

In addition, the photocatalytic H2 evolution of CuM2O4 (where M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co) spinels was also examined.87 These spinel oxides exhibited p-type semiconducting nature, which was confirmed by positive thermopowers and low onset photocurrents. Furthermore, it was revealed that electron jumping between similar sites resulted in a normal spinel with low activation energy; however larger energies were observed for an inverse spinel. Owing to these features, the CuCo2O4, CuFe2O4 and CuMn2O4 photocatalysts showed high efficiencies of ∼0.098%, ∼0.100% and ∼0.100%, respectively in 1 M KOH under a 200 W tungsten lamp. This enhanced activity was dependent on the synthetic conditions and band bending effect of spinels. Also, the enhanced photocatalytic activity was interpreted in terms of electronegativity and flat band potentials and the existence of cobalt in the spinel structure was the reason for the increased affinity of electrons. In addition, two narrow band gap spinel structured semiconductors CuMn2O4 and ZnMn2O4 were tested88 for hydrogen generation by visible light in aqueous solution containing sulfite SO32 or sulfide S2−. The platinized CuMn2O4 showed an enhanced H2 evolution rate of about ∼2.6 × 10−3 mL mg−1 h−1 in a 0.1 M SO32− alkaline solution, where platinum was used as a counter electrode and sulfide was used as a hole scavenger. Remarkably, the H2 production rate decreased over time and attained a zero value after 3 h; this was mainly due to the development of colored polysulfides Sn2−. Moreover, the energy gap of FeCr2O4 is ∼1.33 eV, which is lower than the driving force needed for water splitting.89,90 In aqueous electrolytes, the best photoresponse for H2 production was acquired in a S2− solution with an evolution rate of ∼8.26 cm3 g−1 h−1. Furthermore, for a comparative analysis, the photocatalytic activity of unreduced FeCr2O4 used towards a water–gas shift reaction (i.e. CO + H2O → CO2 + H2) at various temperatures ranging from 523–723 K was examined, and a H2-production rate and CO conversion of about ∼280 μmol g−1 s−1 and 44% respectively was achieved at 723 K.
A range of nanostructured spinels with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen production under light illumination have been studied. Cubic spinel samples of CdIn2S4 with marigold-like and nanotube structures were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method.91 Both samples exhibited good chemical stability. The aqueous and methanol mediated CdIn2S4 products displayed outstanding photocatalytic activity with quantum yields of 16.8% (for a marigold-like structure) and 17.1% (for nanotubes) at 500 nm, respectively, for H2 evolution under visible light. This enhanced performance was accredited to the well-defined crystalline nature and band structure of CdIn2S4.
Typically, for H2 generation by photocatalytic experiments, alcohols are used as a sacrificial reductant to donate electrons. Such methodologies are a challenge to execute for a simultaneous oxygen evolution reaction (OER) along with H2 generation. In addition, electron scavengers, such as AgNO3, were also used to support the OER analysis without disturbing hydrogen production.92 Thus, spinel materials with different nanostructures and morphologies have the potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production, PEC water splitting and other applications.
4.2 Photocatalytic CO2 reduction of spinels
The emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a major contributor to global climate change. In order to solve this issue, carbon dioxide reduction can be achieved in numerous ways, such as biological reduction by plants, and thermal, electrochemical, or photocatalytic reduction. Among them, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is a potential approach to convert CO2 into useful products such as carbon monoxide (CO), methane, ethane, methanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde93–95 as shown in Fig. 5. The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is a promising method to recycle CO2 as a fuel feedstock using solar energy, which is abundant, inexpensive, environmentally benign and safe. In order to develop highly efficient and active photocatalysts for CO2 reduction to hydrocarbon fuels, such as dye degradation, H2 generation and PEC water splitting, some essential conditions are (i) a narrow band gap to increase visible light absorption,96–98 (ii) proficient charge separation,99 and (iii) a shift in the conduction band (CB) to a more negative region than the standard CO2 reduction potentials.68 Moreover, these photocatalysts should be stable, cost effective and eco-friendly. In this respect, Wang et al.100 prepared porous ZnCo2O4 nanorods as a co-catalyst for photocatalysts to convert CO2 and water into H2 and CO fuels. Besides, Limei et al.101 prepared CoAl2O4, MgFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles by an inorganic salt sol–gel method and annealed at 800 °C for 4 h for application in producing formic acid via photocatalytic reduction of CO2. All three samples exhibited narrow band gaps, i.e. Eg < 1.55 eV. During photocatalytic CO2 reduction, Na2C2O4 was used as the electron donor. For the CoFe2O4 spinel, ∼4988.11 μmol h−1 g−1 of formic acid was produced at 5 h light irradiation time. It was shown that CoAl2O4, MgFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 spinel photocatalysts all possess high activity; where CoFe2O4 (∼4988.11 μmol h−1 g−1) was the best when compared to CoAl2O4 (∼3950 μmol h−1 g−1) and MgFe2O4 (∼3100 μmol h−1 g−1). The enhanced activity was attributed to the narrow band gap and the reductant Na2C2O4. The reductant of Na2C2O4 has a low redox potential, and can promote oxidation of the three spinel catalysts in the valence band holes. Moreover, the addition of Na2C2O4 in the photocatalytic system not only offers more carbon sources, but also promotes CO2 photoreduction to produce formic acid.

Spinels of CdIn2S4 micro-spherical structures were prepared by a hydrothermal method102 using three different sulfur precursors, such as L-cysteine and thioacetamide and thiourea. The samples were used to reduce CO2via photoactivity to valuable chemicals of dimethoxymethane (DMM) and methyl formate (MF). Notably, the catalyst prepared from L-cysteine revealed a unique photocatalytic activity in both chemical products of DMM (∼2968 μmol h−1 g−1) and MF (∼2857 μmol h−1 g−1). However the other two catalysts fabricated by thioacetamide and thiourea only stimulated the generation of MF, and the total chemical product formation rates were lower than that of CdIn2S4 produced from L-cysteine. To date, a large number of spinel photocatalysts including ZnFe2O4,103 NiCo2O4,104 ZnCo2O4,100 MnCo2O4,105 CuCo2O4,106 Co3O4,107etc. have been used as co-catalysts to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, there are only a limited number of reports on the use of pristine spinel materials as active catalysts in photoredox CO2 conversion reactions.
4.3 Photoelectrochemical water splitting of spinels
Ferrites often exhibit excellent chemical and thermal stability in aqueous environments.108 The desired properties for semiconductors employed as electrodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells and/or as photocatalysts include a narrow energy gap near ∼2 eV. Most of the spinel ferrites are semiconductors with a narrow energy gap that allows the absorption of a large part of the incident visible solar spectrum, and the energy gap permits excitation by visible light, and robust locations of the conduction and the valence bands favor both reduction of protons and/or oxidation of water. Notably, many MFe2O4 (ref. 108) type spinel ferrite photoelectrodes results water splitting activity with or without any external bias applied, where commonly for OER activity an alkaline environment is favored and for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity an acidic environment is favored.
Yang et al.109 tested the photoelectrochemical performance of porous CoFe2O4 nanosheets on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The electrodes were prepared from an aqueous solution of Co and Fe nitrate via a template-free electrochemical deposition method, followed by heat treatment at 933 K. In a 0.1 M aqueous Na2S solution at a zero bias voltage, the photoelectrode exhibited a small cathodic photocurrent of ∼0.3 μA cm−2 under illumination by visible light (λ ≥ 390 nm, 30 mW cm−2). Similarly, both amorphous and crystalline photocatalysts of mesoporous NiFe2O4 spheres were prepared by Hong et al.110 using aerosol spray pyrolysis, where Pluronic F127 was used as the structure directing agent. It was found that the final structure of NiFe2O4 depends on the amount of the structure-directing agent and calcination temperature. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution was measured in methanol/water under 450 nm visible light illumination. A long-term stability with a high H2 gas production rate of ∼0.09 μmol h−1 was obtained for crystalline NiFe2O4, which was mainly due to the highly crystalline nature of the nickel ferrites rather than the large surface area.
It has recently been discerned111 that photocatalytic water splitting can be a novel, green and economic way for water decomposition with a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion (SHF) efficiency. However, this SHF has yet to achieve efficiency above 46%. NiFe2O4 is one of the few materials reported for photocatalytic hydrogen production under irradiation by visible light in the absence of sacrificial reagents.111 Also, the enhanced electrical conductivity associated with the corresponding bare and/or pristine metal oxide (iron oxides, cobalt oxides, aluminum oxides, etc.) is due to the presence of different metal cations assisting the electron transport process and/or supporting the redox reactions at the electrolyte–semiconductor interface; this has a major significance in designing high performance water spitting systems and there are limited reports on PEC water splitting.108,112,113
Tahir et al.113 reported the photo-anodic behavior of the n-ZnFe2O4 photoelectrode. The electrode was prepared by aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition using different alcoholic solutions of a bimetallic precursor on an FTO substrate. The photoanode thin film thickness, surface morphology, and nanostructures were controlled during fabrication. It was found that nanocrystalline ZnFe2O4 showed an n-type nature, and the photoelectrode exhibited a maximum current density of ∼350 μA cm−2 at 0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl. This electrode was prepared at 450 °C with a deposition time of 35 min, where the precursors were prepared using an ethanol solution. It was revealed that the PEC performance of this ZnFe2O4 photoelectrode was dependent on the precursor solvent, deposition time and temperature, and the photoelectrode showed an incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of ∼13.5% at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl under 350 nm wavelength light irradiation.
A pure orthorhombic crystalline phase of MgFe2O4 exhibits a band gap of ∼1.91 eV for visible light absorption.108,112 The photoelectrochemical water splitting of MgFe2O4 was examined by using photocurrent–potential curves in 1 M NaOH electrolyte under AM 1.5 mW cm−2 illumination. At 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the MgFe2O4 photoelectrode exhibited a photocurrent density of ∼25 μA cm−2. The PEC analysis of a mixed phase of Co3−xMxO4 [where M = Al, Ga, and In] thin films was performed as a function of Al:Ga by Newhouse et al.67 Thin films of equal thickness were prepared by an inkjet method and during their PEC experiment, 0.1 M NaOH was used as an electrolyte. The optimized Co3−xMxO4 film with x = 0.4 (i.e. M = Al:Ga in ratios of ∼1.5:1:1.9 at x = 0.4) showed an enriched cathodic photocurrent as the potential was swept negative of ∼−0.1 V, and showed a maximum current density of −0.1 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl and exhibited diode features compared to the pristine Co3O4 film which displayed a substantial dark current. The high dark current could be due to the compensation of native defects in Co3O4 and low resistance of this material. This work validated the effect of band gap engineering in water splitting.
Cubic structured spinel chalcogenides have also been used as photoelectrode materials for water splitting. Since the general formula of a normal 1–3 spinel is M1/2+ M1/23+ (M2)3+ X42+ where the cations in the brackets occupy octahedral sites and the residual cations fill tetrahedral sites.114,115 Herein, the cubic spinel of CuIn5S8 is an n-type semiconductor and CuIn5S8 may be written as Cu1/2In1/2(In2)S4. This formulation can also be comprehended by replacing monovalent copper cations and trivalent indium cations for divalent cadmium cations in CdIn2S4, which is, however, a partially inverse thiospinel: Cd1/2In1/2(Cd1/2In3/2)S4. The photoelectrochemical behavior of n-type CuIn5S8 has been studied in various electrolytes. Scrosati and Fornarini116 reported the impact of the forbidden band gap of the CuIn5S8 photocatalyst on the performance for PEC water splitting. The forbidden band gap of CuIn5S8 was found to be ∼1.26 eV, which was nearer to the optimal value for solar energy utilization than its structural analogue CdIn2S4 (2.28 eV). The CuIn5S8 photoanode was more stable in the sulfide–polysulfide electrolyte. CuIn5S8 showed a negative value for the flatband potential of ∼−1.2 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) with a solar conversion efficiency of ∼0.4%. The most negative values have been observed in the sulfide–polysulfide solution, which was due to the specific adsorption of S2− ions on the surface of the electrode.
Moreover, an amorphous spinel CdCr2S4 photoelectrode was prepared using an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as the substrate through a chemical bath deposition method.117 The photoelectrochemical measurements were made at room temperature in 0.1 M polysulphide solution. Under light illumination, the electrode offered ∼5.5 mA cm−2 at −0.1 V vs. SCE. This performance was attributed to the film being composed of small elongated particles of length ∼100–150 nm and diameter ∼10–20 nm and they were aggregated into monodisperse 100–400 nm diameter spherical clusters. Moreover, numerous nano-sized photoelectrode materials based on Co3O4 spinels have been developed for PEC water splitting. Recently, large scale production of spinels of NiCo2O4 with an urchin-like nanostructure by a simple hydrothermal method was reported.118 Pristine urchins of NiCo2O4 had a diameter of 5 μm on which several small sized nanorods of NiCo2O4 with diameters of 100–200 nm and a length of 2 μm were radially grown from the center. NiCo2O4 with an urchin-like nanostructure showed a high surface area of ∼99.3 m2 g−1. As a result, a high photocurrent of ∼70 μA cm−2 with excellent stability was observed for this urchin-like nanostructured NiCo2O4/FTO substrate. This enhanced performance was due to the large surface area, structural features and conductive nature of the sample.
It is of interest to study the photoelectrochemical properties of spinels for water splitting applications. Aviles et al.119 reported that the fundamental band gap for Zn2SnO4 is about ∼3.6–3.7 eV with a direct-forbidden transition. The conduction band position was predictable from the flat band potential (Efb) using the photocurrent onset potential. In aqueous and non-aqueous media the flat band potential of n-Zn2SnO4 was found to be more positive than anatase by electrochemical analysis. In addition, in aqueous solutions the Efb of Zn2SnO4 was found to follow an ∼59 mV pH−1 slope with Efb extrapolated at pH = 0 of 0.08 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Under light illumination, Zn2SnO4 exhibited an excellent photocurrent density of ∼7 mA cm−2 V vs. NHE.
Photoelectrochemical water splitting by spinels under visible light remains the utmost desirable hydrogen and/or oxygen production method for fossil fuel energy. Low resistive spinel materials with chemical stability, light absorbing capability and aligned band edges to the water redox potentials have been the major focus for material scientists, but no solution has been revealed. Although tunable band gaps in the visible range were obtained, the material performance was restricted by reduced carrier transport properties connected with small polaron carriers.120 A systematic understanding of the foremost material factors restraining their performance is presently lacking. In order to disclose this, spinels of CuFe2O4, MgFe2O4 and ZnFe2O4 were prepared by a solution-based approach121 and their photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting activity was assessed, as shown in Fig. 6. Annealing post-treatments together with the deposition of NiFeOx over-layers were found to enhance the native n-type response, although dominant bulk charge recombination, especially in MgFe2O4, confines the saturation photocurrent below ∼0.4 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In addition, extended Fermi level pinning was observed, which was due to surface states at around 0.9 V vs. RHE. The NiFeOx overlayer was ineffective in modifying the pinning of the Fermi level, but evidently participated as an electrocatalyst to improve the overall activity.

5. Ways to enhance the overall photocatalytic performance
As shown in Table 1, the spinel photocatalysts are surveyed on the basis of their performance in environmental remediation, hydrogen generation, CO2 reduction and photoelectrochemical water splitting through an overall perspective. However, long term operational stability and efficiency are often compromised in these strategies, restricting the large-scale application of spinel photocatalysts. Hence, a desired amount of dopant species, heterostructure formation, enhancement in surface area with highly porous nature and highly crystalline nature were introduced by the scientific community in order to improve their applicability in practice as shown in Fig. 7.
 Fig. 7  Strategies to improve the performance of spinel photocatalysts. 
5.1 Selective doping on spinels
Substituting a small fraction of the cations/anions of “host spinels” is an effective method to improve the performance of spinels.122–125 Typically, a suitable dopant can act as an efficient scavenger to trap electrons, and hence significantly prevent the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, whereas subsequently the photocatalytic activity as well as photosensitivity will be enhanced tremendously. Besides, doping of spinel photocatalysts with an appropriate dopant can modify the surface structure, enhance the spectral response and also regulate the electrocatalytically active sites.126 Moreover, in some cases doping could potentially reduce the band gap. Also, the active centers in such an arrangement could be either the oxygen particles nearby the dopant, or the dopant itself. Recently, several research groups17,127,128 have prepared spinel oxides either with the formula AB2X4 and/or (B(AB)O4), which combine two (or more) different metal ions. However, only limited research studies129–132 have examined ternary transition metal oxides with a spinel oxide structure and their site-preferences, despite reports133 of enhanced activities for the photocatalytic performance. Mg doped CoFe2O4 was proposed as a photocatalyst to degrade RhB by Sundararajan et al.134 The maximum photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 99.5% was observed for 0.4 wt% Mg doped CoFe2O4 (i.e. Co0.6Mg0.4Fe2O4 sample), which was ∼1.37 times higher than that of the pristine CoFe2O4 (∼73.0%), i.e. after Mg doping the degradation efficiency was enhanced by about ∼26.5%. This was mainly due to the effective charge separation and prevention of electron–hole pair recombination. The photo-induced electron–hole pair recombination might be depressed due to the increase in the band gap value with addition of Mg and thus it was possible for the charge carriers to endure effective RhB dye degradation. Likewise, various dopants with spinels were used for photocatalytic degradation to enhance the performance. Cobalt mixed-metal spinel oxides, Co(Al1−xGax)2O4, are promising as photocatalysts for photodegradation of methyl orange and phenol,135 as shown in Fig. 8. This study showed that the dye degradation activity of Co(Al0.5Ga0.5)2O4 was dependent on both pH and the substrate. For Co(Al0.5Ga0.5)2O4, an efficiency of 46% and 72% was observed for the photodegradation of methyl orange and phenol respectively. Also, spinel ZnFe2−xCrxO4 nanoparticles were used to remove orange I azo dye from an aqueous solution.136

Anion doping is also effective in enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Lin et al.137 prepared sulfur anion doped Zn2SnO4 for RhB dye degradation under visible light. The doping of anion of S2− significantly reduced the band gap to 2.7 eV, compared to the band gap of pristine Zn2SnO4 (∼3.6 eV). Owing to the band gap shrinkage the sulfur doped Zn2SnO4 revealed excellent photodegradation of RhB in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. Similarly, taking advantage of the effect of anion (fluorine) doping, Huang et al.138 achieved ∼2.6 times enhanced photocatalytic RhB dye degradation activity for fluorine doped ZnWO4 (F–ZnWO4) compared to the pristine ZnWO4. Recently, nitrogen-doped carbon@NiCo2O4 (NC@NiCo2O4) was prepared by Wang et al.139 for the visible light photocatalytic reduction of CO2. This structural and functional properties of catalytically active Co and Ni with conductive nitrogen-doped carbon showed remarkable separation of photogenerated charge carriers, which enhanced the adsorption and concentration of CO2 molecules and also offered more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. These exceptional structural and compositional features greatly enhanced the performance for the deoxygenative reduction of CO2 by about ∼26.2 μmol h−1 with a high CO evolution rate of ∼2.62 × 104 μmol h−1 g−1 and good stability.
In order to enhance the water splitting efficiency, Xu et al.140 prepared ZnFe2O4, ZnFeGaO4 and ZnGa2O4 spinels.140 Among them, ZnFeGaO4 showed considerable absorption in the visible light region, with an energy gap of ∼1.9 eV. This spinel showed an improved hydrogen production rate of ∼971 μmol h−1 g−1 compared to pristine ZnFe2O4, i.e. ∼861 μmol h−1 g−1 under the whole solar spectrum. Doping of Ga into the ZnFe2O4 spinel structure enhanced the UV region light absorption and altered the electronic configuration, which enhanced the photocatalytic activity. An investigation found that the optical properties were subjected to d → d transitions caused by d orbitals of Co(II) split into Co ed and t2d states under the tetrahedral crystal field (i.e. A site in the AB2O4 spinel structure).120 In addition, the doping of Ga and In for Al at the B site was observed to reduce the energy gap through both enriched O 2p–Ga/In d coupling and an increased influence of group 13 cations states; moving the conduction band downward. While tunable band gaps in the visible range can be obtained, the material performance was limited by poor carrier transport properties associated with small polaron carriers. Similarly, it was found that the electronic structure of these cobalt based metal spinel oxides could be further tuned by establishing cobalt mixed-metal spinel oxides Co(AlxGayIn1−x−y)2O4 to shrink the energy gap and increase orbital mixing, which could lead to enhanced charge carrier mobility.141
Likewise, Woodhouse et al.142,143 prepared p-type Co3−x−yAlxFeyO4 spinel oxides with tunable band gaps from ∼1.6 to 2.0 eV by changing the Fe:Al ratio. This photoelectrode material showed weak cathodic photocurrent under a negative bias. The poor PEC activity was later ascribed to the poor electrical conductivity. Similarly, Miao et al.144 testified the ZnFe2O4/Fe2O3 composite as the photoanode for PEC water splitting, and after doping hematite with Ti, a photocurrent up to ∼0.15 mA cm−2 was obtained.
5.2 Heterojunction on spinels
It is well known that using photocatalytic or PEC systems is a simplistic way for the conversion and utilization of solar energy. To date, several semiconducting spinel photocatalysts have been developed for the aforementioned photocatalytic reactions. Nevertheless, photocatalysts of inorganic materials have certain disadvantages, such as a limited concentration of exposed active sites and poor stability. Hence, the development of efficient photocatalytic materials by forming a heterojunction has attracted enormous research interest. Also, the strategy of heterojunction formation is an effective way to improve the photocatalytic activity, due to the rapid separation of charge carriers by the built-in electric field. Moreover, the combination of appropriate spinel semiconductors can also provide improved photostability and photoabsorption.145,146 Recently, Nguyen et al.66 reported the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) using visible-light-sensitive ZnFe2O4–TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts. Under 465 nm light irradiation conditions, the reaction rate of BPA by ZnFe2O4–TiO2 was 42 times greater than that under 365 nm UV light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 9. The ZnFe2O4–TiO2 nanocomposite displayed outstanding recyclability and reusability and it could retain a stable photocatalytic performance for at least 10 reaction cycles, with a rate constant of ∼0.191–0.218 min−1 under visible light irradiation during the photodegradation of BPA. Later, Hamad et al.147 fabricated TiO2–SiO2–CoFe2O4 core–shells by a sol–gel/hydrothermal route, in which the middle layer SiO2 acts as an insulator between the CoFe2O4 core and the TiO2 shell, and facilitates the separation of the core and shell during the photocatalytic reaction. The TiO2–SiO2–CoFe2O4 composite has been tested for the degradation of dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) dye. During the dye degradation reaction, the highest performance of ∼95.32 and ∼87.27% was attained for the core–shell structure under UV and visible light respectively. Similarly, N-doped TiO2/ZnFe2O4 showed an enhanced performance compared with TiO2/ZnFe2O4 or ZnFe2O4 due to the construction of a heterostructure at the interface as well as the introduction of N species.148

(b) The recyclability and (c) photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A by 1 wt% ZnFe2O4–TiO2 in the presence of 1 mM radical scavengers including tert-butanol (t-BuOH), nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and Na2EDTA.66 Copyright permission@2017 from RSC. 
The NiFe2O4@TiO2 core–shell heterojunction was prepared by Kim et al.149 Owing to the synergetic feature between the heterojunction of NiFe2O4 and TiO2, it revealed effective charge transfer from TiO2 to NiFe2O4 and the suppression of electron/hole pair recombination significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity. As a result, H2 production from the photo-splitting of the core–shell NiFe2O4@TiO2 catalyst was ∼10 times higher than that of either pristine TiO2 or NiFe2O4. Moreover, core–shell photocatalysts of Fe3O4@ZnS and NiCoO4@ZnS were prepared and used for photocatalytic H2 production.135 It was observed that the performance of H2 production can be tuned by the alteration of the electronic structure and morphology of the core–shell materials. By adding different concentrations of ZnS into CoFe2O4, the CoFe2O4@ZnS core–shell photocatalyst was prepared by Chang et al.150 They achieved an improved H2 production rate of 1650 μmol g−1 h−1 for the CoFe2O4@ZnS photocatalyst calcined at 500 °C. This enhanced photocatalytic activity was accredited to the development of a heterojunction at the interface. Moreover, the formation of a heterojunction using organic materials holds several benefits, such as low cost, easy fabrication, and good flexibility. In order to photocatalytically degrade MB dye, the spinel of NiFe2O4/g-C3N4 was made by Liu et al.151 Owing to the higher number of catalytically active sites, 2 wt% of NiFe2O4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed an excellent degradation activity than pristine NiFe2O4. Besides, CoFe2O4/g-C3N4 (ref. 152) and Au/g-C3N4/NiFe2O4 (ref. 153) photocatalysts have also shown enhanced photocatalytic activities. In conclusion, as shown in Fig. 10, the enhanced activity was attributed to the heterojunction on photocatalysts that can accelerate the separation of electron–hole pairs and also enhance the fascinating optical properties.

Additionally, the spinel of ZnFe2O4 is stable in both acidic and alkaline environments,154 and the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge positions of ZnFe2O4 are more negative which favors the PEC water splitting application.154 Therefore, the heterojunction structure of ZnFe2O4 with Fe2O3 and Ti can improve electron–hole pair separation more efficiently than α-Fe2O3 and Ti. In this respect, Fe2O3:Ti/ZnFe2O4 heterojunction photoanodes were prepared by Miao et al.144, and they revealed a high photocurrent of ∼0.27 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Later, Luo et al.155 reported a highly oriented nanocolumnar heterojunction structure of α-Fe2O3/ZnFe2O4 using the atomic layer deposition technique. Owing to the heterojunction feature, the maximum photocurrent density of ∼0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE was achieved. In addition, Liu et al.156 prepared a nanorod array of α-Fe2O3 covered ZnFe2O4, which resulted in the formation of ZnFe2O4/α-Fe2O3 heterojunctions with a superior current density of ∼0.29 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. These outcomes demonstrate that heterojunction engineering can effectively promote charge separation, expose more active sites, increase the conductivity and thereby enhance the photocurrent density.
Developing efficient photocatalysts for solar-driven CO2 reduction is appropriate to improve CO2 photoreduction performance for real-world application. Due to their distinct physicochemical features, heterostructured spinels are excellent photocatalysts for CO2 conversion.157,158 To date, several spinel structures have been used to maximize the virtues of heterojunctions for photocatalysis with appropriate nanostructures.159 In this respect, very recently, Wang et al.132 prepared hierarchical tubular heterostructured ZnIn2S4–In2O3 by a hydrothermal method as shown in Fig. 11. This special structural feature exposed more active sites, and facilitated facile transfer of photogenerated charge carriers and a large surface area. As a result, the ZnIn2S4–In2O3 photocatalyst showed exceptional performance for deoxygenative CO2 reduction with a significant CO evolution rate of ∼3075 μmol h−1 g−1 and long term stability. Similarly, various kinds of heterostructured spinels such as ZnFe2O4–BiOCl,160 Co3O4–CeO2 (ref. 161) and ZnFe2O4/TiO2 (ref. 162) were tested for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction.

5.3 Porosity and surface area
The surface area and porosity also strongly influence the photocatalytic activity, as the porous structure is beneficial for the absorption and diffusion of target molecules into the active sites. The electron–hole recombination might also depend on the porosity and size of the nanoparticles. In addition, a higher surface area might increase light absorption and carrier collection and hence enhance the performance for PEC water splitting. Typically, common synthesis methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, co-precipitation, chemical etching, electrospinning (including sol–gel), and templating synthesis have been widely used to improve the porous nature with large surface areas of spinels. Benefitting from the porous nature, numerous research groups have achieved outstanding performances in photocatalytic systems.

5.3.1 Hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis. 
Hydrothermal and solvothermal synthesis are crystallization processes in high-temperature solutions (aqueous or organic solvents) at high vapor pressures, and are the most widely used methods for preparing metal oxides. Dhiman et al.72 prepared ZnFe2O4 with different morphologies i.e. porous nanorods, nanoparticles, nanoflowers and hollow microspheres using a hydrothermal method. The application of synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanostructures was studied in photo-Fenton degradation of dyes. The results indicated a shape dependent relationship with photocatalytic activity as the degradation of dyes followed the order of porous nanorods > nanoparticles > nanoflowers > hollow microspheres. Also, Liu et al.163 synthesized two-dimensional porous Co3O4 sheets through a hydrothermal route, which exhibited higher performance for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) than the bulk Co3O4. Foletto et al.164 synthesized ZnAl2O4 nanoparticles by co-precipitation, hydrothermal and microwave-hydrothermal methods and studied the effects of preparation methods on the pore size and photocatalytic efficiency. It was found that the pore size influences the catalytic performance significantly. The sample prepared by co-precipitation showed the highest activity due to its largest pore size. Similarly, Anchieta et al.165 prepared Zn2SnO4, ZnAl2O4 and ZnFe2O4 powders with large surface areas by hydrothermal, metal–chitosan complexation and solvothermal routes, respectively, in which Zn2SnO4 showed the highest performance for the photodegradation of phenol.
Porosity and surface area also influence the performance of other photocatalytic processes significantly. For example, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical cobalt ferrite/graphene aerogel (CoFe2O4/GA) composites were prepared by a hydrothermal process.166 The CoFe2O4/GAs composites revealed a 3D hierarchical pore structure with mesopores of about 14–18 nm, macropores of 50–125 nm, and a remarkable surface area of ∼177.8 m2 g−1. These functionalities provided this hybrid composite with high biodegradable photo-Fenton activity for methyl orange dye pollutant degradation. Further, the CoFe2O4/GAs could also operate in a wide pH range. When compared with the mechanically mixed composites of CoFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide (CoFe2O4/RGO), the CoFe2O4/GA composites exhibited an interconnected 3D porous structure with uniform deposition of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 12, which may capture electrons to ease the Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion in the photo-Fenton reaction. Thus, the CoFe2O4/GAs hybrid composites showed excellent degradation of the methyl orange dye pollutant. The porous 3D structure provided short diffusion pathways, an admirable conductive network and a large surface area, which are also beneficial for the photo-Fenton reactions. Furthermore, a mesoporous ultrathin ZnGa2O4 photocatalyst was prepared by a facile solvothermal route.167 Both the highly crystalline nature and high surface area (110.4 m2 g−1) inherited from the mesoporous nanosheets of the unique 3D hierarchical nanostructures resulted in a great CO2 photocatalytic performance. Besides, benefiting from the meso-ZnGa2O4 porous nature, the photo-excited carriers can persist for a longer period on the nanosheet, which also contributed to the high photocatalytic activity of the ZnGa2O4 nanosheets.

5.3.2 Chemical etching method. 
Chemical etching allows the selective removal of less stable regions in a bulk material, giving rise to porous structures. It has been extensively used for preparing porous materials such as activated carbons.168 This method has also been demonstrated to be effective in preparing porous spinels. For example, Pang et al.169 prepared porous ZnFe2O4 by etching ZnFe2O4 particles with oxalic acid, and the porosity was controlled by changing the etching time. As expected, they found that ZnFe2O4 particles with higher porosity and specific surface area exhibited a higher efficiency towards photocatalytic degradation of RhB. Similarly, benefiting from the etching technique, enhanced photocatalytic performances were achieved for the carbon dots/NiCo2O4 composite,170 N-doped carbon@ NiCo2O4,139 Co3O4 (ref. 171) and NiCo2O4 (ref. 171).


5.3.3 Electrospinning. 
Electrospinning works through stretching of a polymer solution (or melt) to an enormous draw ratio using an electrical force. It is a versatile technique to prepare one-dimensional nanostructures. Metal oxides prepared through such a process might possess large surface areas and high porosity after removal of the polymer matrix upon calcination. Porous spinel nanotubes and nanofibers have been prepared by this method. For instance, Jing et al.172,173 prepared porous tetragonal-CuFe2O4 nanotubes by electrospinning. In such a process, the precursor was first prepared through a sol–gel process, followed by air-annealing during which the polymers were removed as gases and metal ions diffused and pores were developed. The nanotubes displayed excellent performance for the photodecomposition of acid fuchsin. Using a similar method,173 they prepared hierarchical SrTiO3/NiFe2O4 composite nanotubes with an excellent light response and high performance for the degradation of RhB.


5.3.4 Template synthesis. 
Template synthesis involves the patterning and growth of building blocks of target materials on a template which could be in the form of a soft template, hard template or self-template. The formation of porous materials can be well controlled in this process, which usually results in ordered structures. Skliri et al.174 prepared 3D interconnected nanoporous ZnFe2O4 with a large internal surface area (up to 159 m2 g−1) through block copolymer-assisted cross-linking aggregation of colloidal nanoparticles, showing a photocatalytic rate five times higher than that of the bulk counterpart towards reduction of aqueous Cr(VI). Zhang et al.175 prepared a CuCr2O4 mesoporous structure by casting a mixed melt of Cu(NO3)2 and Cr(NO3)3 into a cubic Ia3d mesoporous silica template KIT-6, followed by removing the template using KOH. It was shown that the mesoporous CuCr2O4 exhibits significantly higher efficiency towards photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen production than the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, the stability under visible light was also enhanced in the porous structure than in the bulk material. Similarly, porous Co3O4 nanostructures have been prepared176,177 using polyvinyl pyrrolidone modified carbon spheres as the template, exhibiting higher performance than the bulk Co3O4 for the photocatalytic degradation of Congo red. Ni1−xCoxFe2O4 microcubes have also been prepared by pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks at 600 °C with the assistance of sacrificial templates.178 Hong et al.110 prepared mesoporous nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) spheres by an aerosol spray pyrolysis method using Pluronic F127 as a structure-directing agent, as shown in Fig. 13, and a high specific surface area (∼278 m2 g−1) with a highly crystalline framework was achieved by changing the quantity of the structure-directing agent and the calcination conditions. Also, spinel structured CuCr2O4 with a mesoporous structure has been successfully synthesized using a nanocasting method.179 Owing to the mesoporous nature, the spinel CuCr2O4 nanostructure was found to be active for low temperature CO oxidation.

5.3.5 Direct pyrolysis. 
Pyrolysis is an essential step for synthesizing spinels in most of the preparation methods, during which the precursor plays an important role in the morphology of the final products. Meng et al.180 prepared highly porous ZnFe2O4 through pyrolysis of a zinc–iron(III)–sulfate layered double hydroxide (LDH). They also prepared ZnFe2O4 by a conventional co-precipitation route followed by calcination under the same conditions for comparison. It was found that the sample prepared by the former method exhibits a higher efficiency and longer lifetime for catalytic degradation of phenol than the latter. Liu et al.181 prepared MnFe2O4 by co-pyrolysis of Mn(NO3)2, Fe(NO3)3 and rice hull. The complexation of metal ions with the polar group in rice hull and the carbonization of the latter gave rise to highly porous MnFe2O4. Furthermore, porous CoFe2O4 was also prepared through similar procedures, showing excellent performance for the degradation of methylene blue. Direct pyrolysis of carbonate precursors also resulted in highly porous CoMn2O4 and MnCo2O4 catalysts with high performances.182 The different porosity and surface areas derived from different precursors might be associated with the different thermal stability and ease of gasification of the precursor. The different morphologies of the precursors might also play a role as they can be inherited into the pyrolytic product.

5.4 Nanosize crystalline effect
The crystallite size is also a crucial factor that determines the photocatalytic performance. A reduced crystallite size would provide a shorter diffusion length for photogenerated carriers during the photocatalytic reactions, which could enhance the photocatalytic activity. Usually, an increase in particle size was observed in spinels annealed at higher temperatures due to a blending of neighboring particles. In some cases, their crystallinity is also increased.183 The annealing effect of ZnFe2O4 on the photodegradation of methyl orange was reported by Jadhav et al.184 ZnFe2O4 sintered at 500 °C showed the best methyl orange photodegradation activity, which was ascribed to the regular crystallization of zinc ferrite at this temperature. A further increase in the heat treatment temperature led to a decrease in performance, which was due to the increased bulk crystalline nature of the samples. Likely, ferrites of MFe2O4 (M = Co, Ni, Zn, and Cu) were prepared by Sharma et al.71 and their results indicate that the samples annealed at 400 °C had a higher efficiency when compared to the samples annealed at 1000 °C and also achieved high photodegradation activity. Moreover, one-dimensional ZnFe2O4 nanorods with a diameter of ∼40 nm and length of ∼400 nm were prepared on an FTO glass substrate by Kim et al.185 In order to enhance the crystalline nature and PEC performance, the prepared samples were subjected to normal thermal treatment and hybrid microwave annealing (HMA) from 550 to 800 °C for 3 h, and the 550 °C-annealed ZnFe2O4 photoanode showed an excellent PEC activity, which was ∼15 times higher than that of the 800 °C-annealed one (i.e. a conventionally annealed ZnFe2O4 sample). It was observed that hybrid microwave annealing enhanced the crystallinity of ZnFe2O4 nanorods compared to conventional annealing. In addition, these experiments revealed that improved hole injection for water splitting was probably due to reduced surface trap sites and increased crystallization of the bulk ZnFe2O4 spinel.
It should be pointed out that, however, the practical application of these spinel heterostructures is still at an early stage and has a long way to go. As shown in Table 1, several spinel materials can act as effective photocatalysts for environmental remediation, hydrogen generation, CO2 reduction reactions and PEC water splitting. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic performances of some of the above-mentioned spinels are still inferior to some of the non-spinel semiconductor photocatalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, CdS, etc., not to mention that preparation of some of the conventional semiconducting catalysts is more straightforward. Compared to spinel photocatalysts, the band gaps and energy levels of some non-spinel photocatalysts are more appropriate for harvesting solar energy, which results in excellent photocatalytic performances. However, as explained above, spinels as a rising catalyst platform could offer even richer space for tailoring the composition, morphology, crystallite structure and performance which could be fulfilled by doping, heterojunction formation, pore-creation, crystallite reduction and so on. In this sense, spinels would be promoting photocatalysts in future.
6. Conclusions
In summary, spinel materials are promising candidates for a wide range of applications including green and clean use of environmental remediation, photocatalytic hydrogen production, CO2 reduction and photoelectrochemical water splitting. A number of spinels including those based on cobalt, copper, nickel, zinc, iron and several other mixed-metal oxide spinels have been designed for a variety of photocatalytic reactions. Ultimately, spinel materials are cost effective, eco-friendly, highly stable and naturally abundant. However, the use of these spinels continues to develop, because of their relatively low efficiency towards generation of fuels, although the possibilities to exploit green methods for the production of fuels and chemicals while reducing the global CO2 level make them fascinating materials to be explored and advanced. Notably, some spinels such as ZnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, BaFe2O4, MnFe2O4 and MgFe2O4 exhibit a narrow band gap, photo-Fenton reaction, high porosity with large surface area, and fine nanostructure, which are beneficial for photocatalytic applications when exposed to the visible light spectrum. However, there remain potential challenges such as inadequate photoabsorption in the visible light region, poor efficiency, reduced chemical absorption and activation of CO2 reduction, and low electron–hole charge separation efficiency. Nevertheless, spinel nanostructures have shown great opportunities in environmental remediation and hydrogen production. The applications of spinels for the photoreduction of CO2 are less widely reported and most spinels were used as co-catalysts with high cost precious ruthenium compounds. Importantly, spinel materials offer a substantial platform for structural, electronic and surface modification, and doping with other transition metals or carbon materials. It is envisioned that these materials can fulfill their potential as photocatalysts for dye degradation, CO2 reduction, water splitting and applications in electronic and energy conversion, along with future storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells and hybrid electric vehicles.
