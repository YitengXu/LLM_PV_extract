The electrical properties depend mainly on the deposition temperature. Films deposited at high temperatures have much lower electrical conductivity but remarkably higher photosensitivity than those deposited at low temperatures. The deposition temperatures are found to affect the electrochemical properties, such as anodic photocurrent–potential characteristics and spectra dependence of anodic photocurrents. Some doping effects of Al, Cr and Fe on the both properties are also examined.
