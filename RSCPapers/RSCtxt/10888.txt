    , Accepted 23rd September 2022First published on 26th September 2022AbstractPhotoinduced charge separation and transfer has been recognized as one of the core factors affecting the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of BiVO4 based photoanodes. To achieve a higher charge separation efficiency, modulating the surface band edge of BiVO4-based photoanodes could be regarded as the best choice but still a challenge. Herein, first, it was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations that pristine BiVO4 could form a type-II heterojunction with BiVO4–VBi (replacing Bi sites with V in BiVO4), which could be used to enhance carrier separation. Then we use a gas-phase cation exchange (CA) method to in situ modulate the surface band edge of the BiVO4 photoanode by partially replacing Bi on the surface with V to form a V-rich surface. The charge separation efficiency of the optimized V-rich BiVO4 (V/BVO) photoanode is significantly enhanced from 56.5% to 81.5% compared to pristine BiVO4. As expected, it also displays a higher photocurrent density of 2.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (under AM 1.5G illumination), which is nearly 3.2 times higher compared with pristine BiVO4. Upon further loading the FeOOH cocatalyst, the photocurrent of the V/BVO/FeOOH photoanode reached 4.26 mA cm−2 due to the boosted surface water oxidation properties. This work sheds light on a simple strategy to regulate surface band edges for designing highly efficient photoanodes.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting can directly use solar energy to split water into clean hydrogen energy, which can then be used to address existing energy and environmental problems.1–8 This technique has great potential in practical applications because it can be integrated by thin-film photoelectrodes of photocathode and photoanode that act as a device with a self-biased independent structure.9,10 Among the candidate materials for the photoanode, n-type semiconductor materials, such as TiO2,11,12 ZnO,13 BiVO4,14–17 WO3,18,19 Fe2O3,20,21 and Ta3N5,22 have been widely used as photoanodes. BiVO4 in particular has attracted extensive attention due to its suitable band gap (2.4 eV with 10% theoretical photo-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency) and a reasonable energy band structure.20 However, the performance of the BiVO4 material in the existing reports is far below theoretical efficiency due to poor photogenerated carrier transport (carrier separation) and conversion efficiency (holes are used to oxidize water).14,23–27 In addition to poor surface water oxidation kinetics, the most important problem with BiVO4 photoanodes is the recombination of a large number of carriers at the photoanode solid/liquid interface (semiconductor/electrolyte).14,27 Therefore, it is important to develop effective methods to improve the charge carrier transport efficiency for preparing efficient BiVO4-based photoanode materials.
Recent work has focused on the additional hole transport layer with good results.15,28,29 For example, Zhang et al. used single-atom Ni–N4–O as the hole storage layer to modify BiVO4 photoanodes, which greatly improved the transport efficiency and the kinetics of surface water oxidation.28 Similarly, Song et al. used MoOX/MXene as a hole transport layer, which led to improved PEC performance.15 Similar work has been done for the construction of heterostructures. For example, Chen et al. constructed a TiO2/BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode that concurrently improved the carrier separation rate and stability.30 The same regulation idea has also been used on other photoanode materials such as WO3,31 ZnO,18 and Fe2O3.23 However, it should be noted that the hole transport layer is often covered directly on the surface of the photoanode, which inevitably introduces interfacial recombination centres that limit the performance of photoanodes.6
Considering the hindering effect of charged polarons in the process of carrier transport, some researchers have now focused on doping and vacancy regulation to improve carrier transport.32–34 For example, Jin et al. controlled O vacancies to maximize the carrier separation rate of BiVO4 photoanodes.35 Because BiVO4 is a multi-metal oxide semiconductor, Bi and V acted as hole and electron polarization centres, respectively.32 Therefore, to reduce severe carrier recombination on the surface of the photoanode, it is necessary to modulate the Bi sites to release the holes accumulated on the surface. In a recent study, Lu et al. used the deep solvent method to regulate Bi vacancies and improve the carrier transport. This strategy is more effective than the regulation of O vacancies.14 The defects or doping of semiconductor materials can be analysed by energy band structure engineering, and the fundamental improvements in performance can be explained by reasonable energy band bending on the inner surface of the material.36,37 Unfortunately, few studies have studied the influence of modulation methods on the band structure of the photoanode—especially work that combines the regulation of metal cations on the photoanode surface and the analysis of the energy band structure.
In the present work, we first used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to show that the Bi sites replaced by V sites in BiVO4 can tune the band structure. Then, an in situ gas-phase CA method was developed to replace Bi by V on the BiVO4 photoanode surface, resulting in the formation of a surface V-rich BiVO4 (V/BVO) photoanode. The photoanode with V-rich surfaces had a band structure similar to that predicted by DFT calculations. The charge transport efficiency was improved from 56.5% to 81.5% at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). Further loading of cocatalysts enhanced the charge transfer efficiency. The optimized V/BVO achieves a photocurrent density of 4.26 mA cm−2 (1.23 V vs. RHE) and a maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency of 2.03% under AM 1.5G illumination.
Experimental section
Reagents and materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, < 22 Ω sq−1) coated glass as the current collector and substrate was purchased from Yingkou Opivite New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. China. Vanadyl acetylacetonate (C10H14O5V), barium nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99.0%), sodium iodide (NaI, 99.0%), anhydrous ethanol, vanadium(III) chloride (VCl3, 97.0%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were bought from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co. The chemical raw materials used in the electrochemical test to prepare the electrolyte such as sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite come from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Company as well. All chemicals were used directly without any further purification. The used deionized water is self-made.
Preparation of the photoanodes

BiVO4 photoanode. 
Pristine BiVO4 photoanodes were prepared by electrochemical deposition of BiOI followed by a thermochemical conversion process. Briefly, 3.32 g of NaI and 0.5 g Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water and then the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 1.7 by adding HNO3. Then, the above solution was mixed with 20 mL ethanol containing 0.23 M p-benzoquinone under forceful stirring for several minutes. Subsequently, a typical three-electrode cell was used for electrodeposition. FTO was used as the working electrode (WE), Ag/AgCl (4 M KCl) acted as the reference electrode (RE) and a platinum electrode acted as the counter electrode (CE). The cathodic deposition was carried out at a constant potential of −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 4 minutes at room temperature. Then, 50 μL of DMSO solution containing 0.2 M VO(acac)2 was placed on the BiOI electrode (1 cm × 2 cm) and heated in air for 20 min on a heating plate at 120 °C until DMSO has been evaporated. Then, it was moved into a muffle furnace (HeFei-Kejing Furnace, KSL-1200X) and heated at 450 °C (ramping rate = 10 °C min−1) for 1 h to convert BiOI into BiVO4@V2O5. Finally, the excess V2O5 in the BiVO4 electrode was removed by immersing in 1 M NaOH solution for 30 minutes with gentle stirring. The obtained pure BiVO4 electrode was washed with deionized water and dried in a drying oven. The resultant sample was denoted as BVO.


V/BiVO4 photoanodes. 
The obtained BiVO4 photoanode was placed in the center of a quartz tube (50 mm in diameter) while VCl3 powder was placed at about 4 cm upstream from the center of the quartz tube. After the quartz tube was evacuated to a negative atmosphere, N2 gas (50 sccm) was flowed into the system. The air pressure was kept at 140 Pa during the whole reaction process. The furnace was heated to 340 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 and held for several minutes (2, 4, 6, and 8 min), respectively. Then, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The resultant samples were denoted as V2/BVO, V4/BVO, V6/BVO, and V8/BVO, respectively. For comparison, another two control samples were prepared without the V resource in the chamber at 340 and 400 °C, respectively. The reaction time was 30 min for these samples. The obtained products were marked as BVO-340 °C-30 min and BVO-400 °C-30 min, respectively.


V/BVO/FeOOH photoanodes. 
The FeOOH cocatalyst was deposited in 0.1 M FeSO4 solution under AM1.5G illumination and +0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl bias for 12 min. The resultant samples were denoted as BVO/FeOOH and V/BVO/FeOOH, respectively.

Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed by using a Hitachi S-4800 and EDS is performed by using a Bruker energy spectrometer equipped with a SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out by using a JEM-2100F microscope operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40 thousand volts, 20 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Fisher photo-electron spectrometer. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a UV-3100 spectrometer by using BaSO4 as the reference.
PEC tests
The photoelectro-chemical (PEC) properties were measured by using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI760D) with a standard three-electrode system. The illumination source was simulated sunlight AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), and a 0.2 M potassium borate (KBi) solution (pH = 9.2) was used as the electrolyte. Current–potential (J–V) characteristics were recorded by scanning the potential a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. M–S plots were recorded with a frequency of 500 Hz. The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using the relationship ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197 (at 20 °C). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the products were collected by AC impedance spectroscopy under the bias of 2.0 VRHE in the frequency range from 105 to 0.1 Hz without illumination. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured at 1.23 VRHE using the same three-electrode setup described above for photocurrent measurements. IPCE was calculated as follows:35IPCE = 1240 × I (mA cm−2)/(Plight (mW cm−2) × λ (nm))where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and Plight is the measured light power density at that wavelength. Assuming 100% faradaic efficiency, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) was calculated using the following equation:38ABPE = I(mA cm−2) × (1.23 − Vbias) (V)/Plight (mW cm−2)where I is the photocurrent density, Vbias is the applied potential, and Plight is the incident illumination power density (100 mW cm−2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots were obtained at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) with a small AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 10−2 to 105 Hz.
The charge injection efficiency (ηinjection) was calculated using the equation:38ηinjection = Jwater/Jsulfite
The charge separation efficiency (ηseparation) was calculated using the equation:38ηseparation = Jsulfite/Jabs.
PEC H2 and O2 evolution was studied in 0.2 M KBi after saturation with N2 gas for 30 min. Evolved H2 and O2 gas was collected and measured according to the standard H2 and O2 evolution curve using a gas chromatograph.
DFT computation part
All reaction energetics have been studied by the DFT method through the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). A 500 eV cutoff energy for the plane wave was set. All of the calculation models were geometrically optimized until the energy was converged to 1 × 10−5 eV and all the forces on the free atoms were less than 0.01 eV Å−1.
Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation analysis for the energy band structure
The BiO8 dodecahedron and VO4 tetrahedron in BiVO4 crystals are the polarization centres for hole and electron carriers, respectively (Fig. S1, ESI†).32 Therefore, it is possible to optimize semiconductor hole transport and optimize the energy band structure by controlling the Bi site cations, which is different from the previous regulation of defects on V or O sites.23 As a new kind of structure, we first constructed the atomic structure model of BiVO4 and the BiVO4–VBi model with V-substituted Bi sites and then used theoretical calculations to study the energy band structure relationship between them (Fig. S2, ESI†). The energy band structure of bismuth vanadate is shown in Fig. 1a. The Fermi level, which is set to 0 in the calculation, is closer to the conduction band region, thus indicating that the material is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.2 eV. This value is close to that reported for BiVO4.39 The calculation results of BiVO4–VBi show that it also an obvious n-type semiconductor with a band gap close to that of the BiVO4 material. The replacement of Bi by V modulates the Fermi level, thus making it farther from the low position of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and shifting it toward the valence band Fig. 1b.

(f) Schematic diagram of the energy band structure of the BiVO4/BiVO4–VBi/V2O5 ternary continuous heterojunction. 
To investigate situations where the Bi site is completely substituted, the V2O5 band structure was analysed using the same calculation parameters (Fig. S2, ESI†). Fig. 1c shows that V2O5 has distinct p-type semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 2.02 eV.40 The density of states (DOS) analysis shows (Fig. 1a and b) that for the BiVO4 and BiVO4–VBi structures, the conduction band energy levels are mainly composed of V atomic energy levels, and the valence band energy levels are mainly composed of O atomic energy levels. The conduction bands of V and O overlap significantly, thus suggesting hybridization of V–O.37 The DOS model of the V2O5 structure has similar results to V and O; these bands dominate the conduction and valence band energy levels (Fig. 1c). It can be concluded that introduction of V can modulate the energy level structure of BiVO4 and shifts the Fermi level to the valence band. Sufficient substitution leads to the conversion of the material from n-type semiconductor to p-type semiconductor.
To further analyse the influence of the surface introduction of V on the edge band structure of BiVO4, we next analysed the band edges of BiVO4, BiVO4–VBi, and V2O5, as well as the band structure of the resulting heterojunction. Fig. 1d shows that the band edges of BiVO4 are 0.19 eV, and −1.99 eV while those of BiVO4–VBi are 0.5 eV and −1.70 eV, respectively. In comparison, the CBM and valence band maximum (VBM) of BiVO4 are lower than those of BiVO4–VBi, which further confirms that a type-II n–n heterojunction can be formed between BiVO4/BiVO4–VBi. Similarly, the band edge of vanadium oxide is 1.82 eV and −0.2 eV for BiVO4 and V2O5, respectively, which is significantly higher than that of BiVO4. A typical type II p–n heterojunction can be formed between them (Fig. 1e). Therefore, if the surface Bi site of the BiVO4 photoanode is introduced by substitution of V, then a band structure similar to the hetero-interface shown in Fig. 1f can be formed. The built-in electric field is directed from the internal BiVO4 to the surface, thus driving hole carriers. The electrons move toward the photoanode surface, thus inhibiting their recombination.14,41
Structural and phase characterization
Guided by the prior DFT calculations, a surface V-rich BiVO4 (V/BVO) photoanode was designed for PEC water splitting. The basic preparation process is shown in Fig. 2a. The preparation of pristine BiVO4 is the same as in the previous report.15,42 First, BiOI was obtained by photo-deposition (Fig. S3, ESI†), and then sintered with a V source to obtain pristine BiVO4 (BVO). The excess vanadium oxide was removed by soaking in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.42 Prior work showed that Bi sites in bismuth vanadate are more prone to cationic defects than V sites, which are then preferentially replaced.38 Therefore, V can be used to replace the Bi sites on the surface of the BVO photoanode by the gas-phase CA method, and ultimately a V-rich surface photoanode can be obtained. The experimental replacement device is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI). Under vacuum and at a defined temperature, the VCl3 is evaporated and moved to the BVO photoanode under the drive of the carrier gas followed by a replacement reaction.43,44 The specific reaction mechanism is extraction of Bi ions from the Bi site and entry of V ions. Here, the O anion acts as a framework and stabilizes the framework (Fig. S5, ESI†).45,46

Fig. 2(b and c) present the SEM images of the BVO and V4/BVO photoanode, respectively. Both are composed of random mesoporous particles with a thickness of 1.11 μm (Fig. 2d). Further analysis of the V/BVO photoanode with different CA times showed that different replacement times of 4 min to 30 min had little effect on the morphology of the V/BVO photoanode (Fig. S6, ESI†). However, quantification of the EDS elements showed that the Bi:V atomic ratio (NBi/NV, EDS) in the V/BVO photoanode decreased from 1.02 to 0.79 with longer replacement times (Table S1, ESI†). When the V resource is absent in the reaction process, the Bi:V atomic ratio of the obtained sample is 1.01 (Fig. S7(a1–a2), ESI†), which is consistent with the bare BVO sample. This result reveals that the Bi atoms cannot automatically escape from the lattice at 340 °C while part of Bi can be evaporated at a higher temperature of 400 °C (Fig. S7(b1–b2), ESI†). Thus, this also confirms that the lost Bi atoms on the BVO surface are replaced by V through the in situ gas-phase cation exchange process rather than the escape from the lattice for the V/BVO photoanodes. The main XRD peaks of BVO and V4/BVO photoanodes are nearly the same with no new characteristic peaks (Fig. S8a, ESI†). This is mainly due to the low substitution ratio of V. In addition, the Raman characteristic peak positions of V4/BVO are nearly constant versus BVO because all of the Raman peaks are only related to the stretching or vibration of the V–O bond (Fig. S8b, ESI†).
The surface morphology changes of the V4/BVO photoanode were further analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image at low magnification (Fig. 2e) shows that it is almost identical to the BVO photoanode (Fig. S9, ESI†). In comparison, the high magnification TEM images clearly show that there is an obvious amorphous layer on the surface of the V4/BVO photoanode, which is caused by the large difference in the incoming V and outgoing Bi. Therefore, a surface V-rich layer appears, which also proves the successful replacement of Bi in BVO by V ions. EDS mapping showed that Bi, O, and V are the main elements and were uniformly distributed throughout the region (Fig. 2d). To further prove that V ions can replace BVO, we increased the replacement temperature and time for complete replacement of Bi in BVO by V. As a result, the Bi in the BVO were almost all replaced by V, but its morphology remains consistent with that of BVO (Fig. S10, ESI†). In addition, the replacement of Bi by V could be also carried out in the Bi2O3 surface through the gas-phase cation exchange process at 340 °C and 400 °C (Fig. S11, ESI†), thus further demonstrating the feasibility of cation replacement.
The chemical composition and elemental state of the photoanode can be determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra of all of the materials show obvious peak positions of Bi, V, and O (Fig. 3a). High-resolution spectral analysis showed that the Bi and V high-resolution XPS spectra of V4/BVO and V8/BVO had a significant shift in the direction of high binding energy versus BVO (Fig. 3b and c); this suggests the increased oxidation state of the two elements.15 The cation content of the photoanode before and after cation replacement was quantified by XPS spectroscopy (Table S2, ESI†). The results showed that the Bi content on the surface of the BVO photoanode was significantly higher than that of V. It is much larger than the quantitative EDS results because the NaOH immersion treatment during the preparation of the BVO photoanode corrodes the surface of the photoanode, thus resulting in the removal of excess V atoms (Table S2, ESI†). In contrast, the V4/BVO and V8/BVO photoanodes supplemented with V by CA had significantly higher V ratios. The Bi/V atomic ratio (NBi/NV, XPS) in the BVO photoanode decreased from 1.28 to 0.48 (V4/BVO) or even 0.41 (V8/BVO) (Fig. 3d). In general, the O 1s core-level XPS spectra exhibit asymmetric peaks that can be fitted into two components, corresponding to lattice oxygen (OL) and hydroxyl groups bonded to metal cations in the oxygen deficient region (OV).47,48 As shown in Fig. 3e, the O 1s peak of BVO is centered at 529.6 eV, in combination with other reported BiVO4 related studies.28 Similarly, the processing results of V4/BVO and V8/BVO electrodes show that the peak position of O 1s centered at 531.1 eV, showing a positive shift, which is more in line with the peak position of vanadium oxide.49,50 This is because the surface of the sample after CA of V consists of significantly more vanadium than bismuth, so its surface is dominated by vanadium oxide (Table S2, ESI†), which is also the reason for the positive shift in the center of the O 1s. These results further demonstrate that the gas-phase CA can successfully and selectively replace Bi with V. This substitution reaction is primarily carried out on the surface.

PEC performance test
The PEC test of the photoanode was performed in a typical three-photoanode system in which 0.2 M potassium borate solution (KBi, pH 9.2) was used as the electrolyte (Fig. 4a). A xenon lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used to simulate sunlight at 100 mW cm−2. Under illumination, the V/BVO photoanode exhibited obvious performance improvements (Fig. S12a, ESI†). V4/BVO had the highest photocurrent of 2.87 mA cm−2 (vs. RHE), which is 3.2 times that of pristine BVO (Fig. 4b). To further promote the PEC activity, the FeOOH cocatalyst was loaded on the surface of V/BVO photoanode. The SEM image analysis of the V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanode loaded with the FeOOH cocatalyst shows that its microstructure did not change significantly. The corresponding EDS spectrum shows an obvious Fe element peak, which proves that FeOOH was prepared (Fig. S13, ESI†). Under transient illumination, all BVO, V/BVO, and V4/BVO/FeOOH also exhibited a good photo-response (Fig. S12b, ESI†). The performance of V4/BVO/FeOOH is also significantly higher than that of BVO/FeOOH (Fig. S12c, ESI†), indicating that the modulation of the V-rich surface can substantially improve the photoanode performance. The archived photocurrent over the obtained V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanode is up to 4.26 mA cm−2 (vs. RHE), which is 4.73-fold that of pristine BVO and also comparable to most BiVO4 based photoanodes ever reported (Table S3, ESI†). To evaluate the efficiency in which electrical energy was subtracted, the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the representative photoanodes was studied. As shown in Fig. 4c, the maximum ABPE for V4/BVO at 0.82 V reaches 0.88% while the pristine BVO is only 0.32% at the same bias. After the deposition of the FeOOH cocatalyst, the ABPE can reach 2.03% at 0.68 VRHE for V4/BVO/FeOOH, which suggests that the V-rich surface and FeOOH cocatalyst can synergistically inhibit charge recombination and accelerated charge transport of BiVO4.

(e) Photocurrent density versus time curves of BVO and V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanodes under long-term illumination at fixed bias (1.23 V vs. RHE). (f) Time course curves of H2 and O2 evolution of the V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanode in a PEC cell at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation and the corresponding faradaic efficiency curves. 
As shown in Fig. 4d, all photoanodes have a light response at wavelengths beyond 520 nm, in agreement with the band gap of BiVO4. However, it can be found that introducing a V-rich surface on the BiVO4 photoanode leads to a dramatically enhanced IPCE value throughout the entire spectral range from 320 to 520 nm in comparison with the single one and the maximum IPCE value of about 48% is obtained at about 430 nm. This fact also confirms that more photogenerated carriers are utilized during the PEC reactions, leading to the enhanced IPCE value exhibited by the V4/BVO photoanode. After loading with the FeOOH cocatalyst, the IPCE of the BiVO4 photoanode has been significantly enhanced to 70% at 420 nm, which is 1.47-fold and 3.64-fold higher than that of the V/BVO and BVO photoanodes, respectively. The stability of the photoanode is also a vital reference for evaluating whether it has application value. As shown in Fig. 4e, we performed a 1 h long-term light stability test on the three photoanodes. The results show that V4/BVO has better stability than BVO. In addition, the overall stability is further improved with the addition of the FeOOH co-catalyst, because of the protective effect of FeOOH on BiVO4. The evolution rates of produced H2 and O2 over the V4/BVO/FeOOH sample electrode are shown in Fig. 4d. After ten hours of reaction, the photocurrent value of this photoanode only dropped by less than 5%, reflecting its good stability (Fig. S14, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4f, the produced H2 and O2 is 695.4 μmol and 347.6 μmol, respectively, suggesting that the molar ratio of H2 to O2 is approximately 2:1. The calculated faradaic efficiency for H2 and O2 production is about 92%, demonstrating that the photogenerated charges are almost entirely used to decompose water.
Band structure analysis
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was first performed on the BVO and V4/BVO photoanodes to study the energy band structure of the photoanode. The light absorption curves of the two samples (Fig. 5a) almost completely overlap with the absorption edge at 517 nm corresponding to a band gap of approximately 2.4 eV (Fig. 5b). Accurate band edge positions of the BVO and V4/BVO photoanodes were characterized using UV photoelectron spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the Ecut off of the BVO and V4/BVO photoanodes is 17.09 eV and 16.90 eV, respectively, corresponding to their Fermi levels (Ef) of −4.11 eV and −4.30 eV (vs. vacuum), respectively. The measured valence band edges are −6.25 eV and −6.28 eV, respectively. Combined with the bandgap of 2.4 eV, the positions of the conduction bands are −3.85 eV and −3.88 eV, respectively. From this, the overall band structure of BVO and V4/BVO can be obtained (Fig. 5e). When BVO and V4/BVO are combined together, a schematic diagram of the band structure similar to Fig. 5f can be obtained after the Fermi level is balanced. Accordingly, the built-in electric field (Ebuilt) generated by the upward energy band of BVO to V4/BVO drives the transport of whole carriers to the photoanode surface, which is also consistent with the previous DFT calculations.

PEC mechanism
To further analyze the PEC performance improvement mechanism, we first studied the water oxidation kinetics on the photoanode surface. As shown in Fig. 6a, the BVO and V4/BVO sample photoanodes have almost overlapping dark current water oxidation curves, thus indicating that the surface replacement of V cannot improve the water oxidation capacity of the photoanodes. However, the V4/BVO/FeOOH sample shows an obvious left shift of 211 mV at 2 mA cm−2, which suggests that FeOOH can improve the kinetics of water oxidation on the photoanode surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to study the water oxidation capacity of the samples during the electrochemical reaction. As shown in Fig. 6b, the semicircle diameter of V4/BVO/FeOOH shrinks sharply compared to the other two photoanodes. The corresponding fitting results (Table S4, ESI†) from the equivalent circuit mode (the inset in Fig. 6b) show that the Rct value of V4/BVO/FeOOH is 146.3 Ω, which is much smaller than that of BVO and V4/BVO (1647 and 1544 Ω, respectively). This further indicates that the formation of a V-rich surface of the BiVO4 photoanode cannot essentially change its water oxidation capacity while the introduction of the FeOOH layer can greatly lower the interfacial charge transfer resistance and enhance water oxidation activity.26,27 Moreover, the charge transport properties of the representative photoanodes are evaluated with Mott–Schottky (M–S) tests. The Mott–Schottky (MS) curves of BVO, V4/BVO, and V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanodes are shown in Fig. 6c. It is observed that all three photoanodes have obvious positive slopes, which indicates that they are all typical n-type semiconductors.15,51 In addition, the donor concentration (Nd) of the photoanodes can be obtained by fitting the M–S equation to the linear region of the M–S plots. The calculated carrier densities of BVO, V4/BVO, and V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanodes are 2.07 × 1020, 4.47 × 1020, and 7.50 × 1020 cm−2, respectively. This result reveals that both the surface replacement of V and introduction of FeOOH have a significant improvement of carrier density as compared to BVO. As high carrier concentration is beneficial for the charge transport due to increased conductivity, it will lead to an improved photocurrent on the BiVO4 photoanode.

(g) Schematic illustration of charge transfer kinetics on the electrode surface, in which I (I1 and I2) and S (S1 and S2) represent the FeOOH assisted and unassisted routes of the hole diffusion, respectively. 
The photocurrent curve (Jsulfite) of the photoanode in the electrolyte containing a sacrificial agent (Na2SO3 acts as the sacrificial agent) was tested to further analyze the carrier transport efficiency of the photoanode (Fig. S12d, ESI†). Typically, ηseparation can be calculated using the equation Jsulfite/Jabs, in which the Jabs is the theoretical maximum photocurrent calculated from the light absorption curve and the standard solar spectrum (AM1.5G) (Fig. S15, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 6d, the ηseparation of V4/BVO is calculated to be 81.5% at 1.23 V RHE, which is significantly higher than that of the BVO photoanode (56.5%). This result confirms that the edge band modulation caused by surface V enrichment could enhance separation of electrons and holes. Furthermore, the ηseparation value of the V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanode reaches 95.25%, suggesting that the loading of the cocatalyst could further improve the charge separation. As for the interfacial injection efficiency (ηinjection) of the photoanode, it can be calculated using the equation Jwater/Jsulfite to analyze the carrier injection efficiency of the photoanode surface. The results show that ηinjection of the V4/BVO photoanode could reach 71.78% at 1.23 V, which is almost 2.2 times that of the BVO (Fig. 6e), which is mainly due to the large enrichment of surface holes caused by the overall high energy band of the V/BVO photoanode that leads to higher carrier injection. After loading FeOOH, the ηinjection of the V4/BVO/FeOOH photoanode is further improved to 92.8%. It has an extremely high carrier injection efficiency at 0.6 V (vs. RHE), which is more than three times higher than that of the BVO photoanode. This is mainly due to the ultra-high catalytic activity of FeOOH for water oxidation.
For in-depth understanding of the carrier transport properties of the photoanode after surface V modification, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the BVO and V4/BVO photoanodes were recorded. As shown in Fig. 6f, the emission peak at 517 nm is from the bandgap PL luminescence, which is close to its bandgap energy of 2.4 eV.52 In addition, there is an extra emission peak at 710 nm belonging to the band that is related to the carrier recombination on the surface of the photoanode. The emission peaks of band-to-band recombination and inter-band recombination of V4/BVO are significantly increased versus pristine BVO. This phenomenon may be due to the inhibition of charge recombination by V4/BVO, which in turn leads to the recombination of more freely mobile carriers in the in-band state.14
A schematic diagram of the overall mechanism is proposed as shown in Fig. 6g. The electron–hole carriers are separated after light irradiates the V/BVO photoanode and the holes then move to the surface to oxidize water molecules. As compared to the BVO sample, the V/BVO photoanode shows improvement of the carrier transport ability, which mainly can be ascribed to the following two aspects: (i) the BiO8 site, as a hole polaron, is often not conducive to the enrichment of hole carriers on the electrode surface, resulting in a serious carrier recombination of the BVO. When a certain amount of Bi was replaced by V, more effective holes can reach the surface of the photoanode, leading to an improved carrier transport ability. (ii) the built-in electric field generated by the band bending caused by electrode regulation can effectively drive the recombination of carriers on the surface, thereby improving the carrier separation rate. After loading with FeOOH, there are two ways for holes to oxidize water on the photoanode surface. The first is the S2 route to the V/BVO surface and direct oxidation and splitting of water through I2. The second is to enter FeOOH through the S1 pathway, which reduces the recombination of carriers at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. This efficiently oxidizes and decomposes water from the FeOOH surface via I2 where the S1 rate is smaller than that of S2, but the I1 rate is much higher than that of I2 (OER kinetics). This leads to a high carrier separation rate of the final FeOOH pathway and ultimately high PEC performance.
Conclusion
In summary, a facile in situ gas-phase CA method has been demonstrated to induce the formation of a V-rich surface on BiVO4 photoanodes, that is Bi sites on the BiVO4 surface were partially replaced by V. The DFT calculations and experimental results confirm that the introduction of a V-rich surface can modulate the surface energy band of the BiVO4 photoanode to form a built-in electric field, resulting in promoted photogenerated charge separation. Impressively, the optimized V/BVO photoanode can improve the carrier separation rate from 56.50% of BVO to 81.56%. With the optimized interface charge separation, the V/BVO photoanode shows a photocurrent up to 2.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which is 3.2 times higher compared with the BVO counterpart. Furthermore, an amorphous FeOOH overlayer is introduced to enhance the water oxidation performance. As a result, the optimum V/BVO/FeOOH photoanode exhibits a significantly enhanced PEC performance of 4.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which is about 4.73 times that of bare BVO. This work provides a feasible way to in situ tune the composition of multi-metal oxide photoanodes, which can significantly improve the surface photogenerated charge carrier separation toward boosted solar energy conversion.
