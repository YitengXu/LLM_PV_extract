    , Accepted 12th March 2018First published on 14th March 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising lab-scale technologies to deliver inexpensive solar electricity. Low-temperature printable carbon counter electrode based planar-heterojunction PSCs are particularly suitable for future large-scale manufacturing, but suffer from an inferior efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the electron transport layer (ETL) for carbon counter electrode based planar-heterojunction PSCs together with micromolecule Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc) as the hole transport layer (HTL), yielding a high power conversion efficiency of 15.39% and an excellent stability over 1200 h. The improved performances are attributed to a better energy level transition, a suppressed electron–hole recombination, and a wider depletion region of the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer. Our work represents a great advancement in the fabrication and popularization of carbon counter electrode based PSCs. More importantly, the whole devices are processed at a temperature below 200 °C, providing potential application of PSCs in monolithic tandem devices and paving the way for the development of carbon based flexible PSCs.
1. Introduction
PSCs composed of organic–metal–halide materials have made impressive progress1–15 in just a few years with the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) skyrocketing from 3.8% (ref. 1) in 2009 to a certified 22.7% (ref. 16) in 2017. Such rapid advancement is unprecedented for any existing photovoltaic material causing much excitement in the photovoltaic field. Discouragingly, the use of conventional expensive and unstable macromolecule organic hole transport materials (e.g., spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA) and the consumption of noble metals (e.g., Au) as counter electrodes hinder the widespread implementation and large-scale production of PSCs.17,18 The emergence of mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite materials19–22 and small molecule organic hole transport materials,23–25 together with cost-effective carbon as the counter electrode,17,18,26–30 further enhances the stability and reduces the cost of PSCs, accelerating the process of future commercialization. The world's most efficient carbon based PSCs are reported to have a TiO2 scaffold layer, a porous ZrO2 or NiO insulating layer, and a porous carbon electrode, followed by the infiltration of a perovskite precursor solution,17,18,31,32 whereas they still need a ≥ 400 °C sintering process to volatilize the organic solvent, limiting their application on flexible plastic substrates. Soon after that, low-temperature printable carbon based PSCs which were fabricated by first depositing the perovskite layer and then printing the carbon electrode with a pre-prepared carbon paste were also studied.33–36 The whole process is conducted at low temperature and low cost, apparently more compatible with roll-to-roll production. However, the PCE of the printable carbon-based PSCs is relatively inferior in contrast. Besides, efficient low-temperature printable carbon based PSCs with a planar-heterojunction configuration are seldom reported, since devices with a relatively thick mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold seem to be more favorable to provide a higher PCE.34,37
As for typical planar PSCs composed of a working electrode (cathode)/electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite layer/hole transport layer (HTL)/counter electrode (anode), the ETL plays a dramatic role in charge separation and transportation, avoiding the electrical shunts between the FTO/perovskite and FTO/HTL interfaces. A uniform, pin-hole free and electrically well conductive ETL is highly demanded for well performing planar PSCs. Inorganic TiO2 (ref. 9 and 38–40) and ZnO41–43 are two commonly used ETLs due to their suitable energy band matching and high transmittance toward visible light. However, the electron recombination rate for the TiO2 ETL is very high due to low electron mobility and the ZnO ETL suffers from chemical instability. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as a promising candidate for the ETL, showing advantages of good antireflection, a low-temperature process, no ultraviolet (UV) photocatalysis effect, and much higher electron mobility in PSCs. Tingli Ma et al. first fabricated PSCs with a PCE of 6.87% using a solution processed SnO2 ETL in 2015.44 Since then, many groups, such as those of Prof. T. Miyasaka and Prof. G. Fang, have reported efficient PSCs using low-temperature processed ETLs.45–48 Grätzel and co-workers reported planar PSCs with efficiencies close to 21% using SnO2 ETLs synthesized by low-temperature chemical bath deposition in 2016.49 However, the fabrication of a compact SnO2 layer without pin-holes is still challenging. Any pinholes in the SnO2 layer can lead to shunt pathways and direct contact between the perovskite active layer and transparent conductive oxide substrate, resulting in high leakage current and serious charge carrier recombination at the interface. Due to these limitations, a single electron transport layer cannot suppress the carrier recombination effectively and may not be an optimal hole blocking layer for PSCs.50–52
Herein, carbon based planar-heterojunction PSCs fabricated by utilizing a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL together with micromolecule CuPc as the HTL were proposed for the first time. The TiO2/SnO2 bilayer was beneficial for electron extraction and transportation, thus resulting in a suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, devices with a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer had a wider depletion region, in favor of an enhanced photovoltaic performance. The champion device showed a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 23.28 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.67, an optimal PCE of 15.39% and an excellent stability over 1200 h. Our work represents an advancement in the understanding of the role of electron selective layers and provides a novel strategy for the realization of highly efficient, cost-effective, and stable planar-heterojunction PSCs.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the scheme of a PSC with a regular structure in this study: a FTO-coated glass as the anode, a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL, a mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite absorber layer, a CuPc hole transport layer and a carbon counter electrode. The corresponding energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 1b, where the work function of FTO is reported to be −4.9 eV.53 Fig. S1 and Table S1† display the ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements for analyzing the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) distributions of TiO2, SnO2 and the perovskite layer. Interestingly, we find that the CB of TiO2 (−4.1 eV) is higher than the CB edge of the perovskite layer (−4.2 eV). After coating SnO2, the CB of the photo-anode is adjusted to −4.5 eV, leading to a smoother energy level transition and benefits photoelectron extraction and transportation. A deep CB of the ETL is also critical to achieve high VOC in PSCs, since VOC is determined by the difference between the Efn (electron quasi-Fermi level) and Efp (hole quasi-Fermi level).37,54 As reported previously, the HOMO and LUMO levels of CuPc are ascribed to −5.2 eV and −3.5 eV,25 respectively. Under illumination, free charge carriers generated in the perovskite layer can be extracted by transferring electrons and holes to SnO2 and CuPc, respectively because of appropriate energy level alignments, thus avoiding undesired recombination. The −3.5 eV LUMO level of CuPc is higher than that of the perovskite layer, blocking the electron transportation from the perovskite to the carbon counter electrode and hence suppressing the carrier recombination. The final collection of holes is extracted using the carbon through the CuPc/carbon interface from the HOMO of CuPc (−5.2 eV) to carbon (Fermi level: −5.0 eV). Fig. 1c–h illustrate the synthetic process of our perovskite devices, including RF magnetron sputtered TiO2, SnO2 coating, perovskite coating, DMSO assisted annealing, CuPc evaporation and carbon printing. Each stage is simple and processed below 200 °C (for more details, please see the Experimental section).

Fig. 2a–d show the top-view SEM images of the FTO glass substrate, SnO2, TiO2 and TiO2/SnO2 films. AFM measurements are also conducted to evaluate the surface roughness of these films (Fig. S2 and S3†). As we can see, the surface of bare FTO is very rough which corresponds to a large root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 12 nm. In comparison, the SnO2 coated FTO exhibits a smoother surface and an improved optical transmission (Fig. 2e) in accordance with a previous report.47 Pinholes are still hard to eliminate, as depicted in Fig. 2b, due to the limitation of sol–gel spin-coating method. Surface defects such as pinholes will introduce the recombination center level into the band gap of the semiconductor, which can affect the charge transport. The RF-sputtered TiO2 is able to fully cover the surface of the FTO electrode, thus passivating the FTO surface defects and reducing the recombination at the interface whereas losing a small bit of light transmittance. Finally, the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer exhibits the lowest RMS roughness of 9.3 nm or the smoothest surface, which is beneficial to the formation of high-quality perovskite films.

Fig. 3a shows the top-view SEM image of the perovskite layer prepared by a solvent engineering two-step spin coating method. The film is quite uniform free of pinholes. The surface grain size is estimated to be approximately 2 μm according to a planimetric method involving the counts of the number of grains within a given area.55 As shown in Fig. S4,† with the assistance of DMSO vapor, the perovskite grain sizes enlarge efficiently from around 200 nm to 2 μm, beneficial for charge transport.56 When the amount of DMSO is increased to 7 μL, wide-range dissolution and irreparable damage of the perovskite layer appear. Here 5 μL DMSO is our optimized quantity. The surface morphology of the perovskite film is also characterized by the AFM measurement, as shown in Fig. 3b. The RMS roughness is calculated to be 20.63 nm. Fig. 3c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for the triple Cs/MA/FA cation mixed perovskite film. Strong diffraction peaks at 14.12, 20.01, 24.57, 28.43, 31.88, 35.01, 40.65 and 43.23 can be assigned to the (110), (112), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224) and (314) planes of the tetragonal perovskite structure.39,57,58 Peaks at 26.51 and 37.83 marked by rhombuses are attributed tothe FTO substrate. We can also observe a strong diffraction peak at 12.68, which may be assigned to the excess lead in this perovskite composition. It is worthwhile to point out that the perovskite film exhibits a more obvious PbI2 diffraction peak after being annealed under a DMSO vapor atmosphere (Fig. S5a†). During the annealing treatment, the DMSO vapor will erode the perovskite grain boundaries and reshape the film morphology as discussed previously, resulting in the formation of PbI2. And the existence of PbI2 has been demonstrated to have a positive effect for grain boundary passivation.19,59–62 As shown in Fig. 3d, the onset wavelength of the absorbance spectra for the triple Cs/MA/FA cation mixed perovskite film is around 766 nm, smaller than that of the traditional CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material (800 nm), exhibiting a blue-shift character. The perovskite material Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 applied in this study has a larger band gap of 1.61 eV in comparison to the traditional one (1.50 eV),18 owing to the incorporation of Br ions. The finished cell shows excellent uniformity, as seen in the cross sectional SEM image (Fig. 3e). The thicknesses of the FTO layer, sputtered TiO2, spin-coated SnO2 layer, perovskite layer and CuPc hole conductor layer are around 500 nm, 100 nm, 20 nm, 600 nm and 35 nm, respectively. Note that the perovskite grains can intersect the whole perovskite layer after annealing in DMSO vapor, as shown in Fig. S6,† avoiding carrier recombination around the grain boundaries.

The best performance of the PSCs with different ETLs is shown in Fig. 4a and S7,† and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSC with a 100 nm-TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL achieves a champion PCE of 15.39%, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 23.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.67. In contrast, the PSC with SnO2 as the ETL has a lower PCE of 9.96%, with a VOC of 0.8 V, a JSC of 22.1 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.56. The device using sputtered TiO2 as the ETL only exhibits an efficiency of 5.31%. Compared to our champion cell, the device with a 70 nm-TiO2/SnO2 ETL shows an inferior VOC of 0.92 V, while the device with a 130 nm-TiO2/SnO2 ETL displays a reduced JSC of 21.68 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.63. The 100 nm-TiO2/SnO2 bilayer is found to be the optimal ETL to prepare high-efficiency PSCs. Furthermore, devices with SnO2/100 nm-TiO2 ETLs are found to exhibit an inferior VOC and yield a final efficiency of 12.46%, which is consistent with a previous study.50 As illustrated in Fig. S8,† the electron extraction process of a n–i–p structural PSC can be divided into three steps: charge injection, charge transportation and charge collection, which are dominated by the energy difference (ΔG), electron mobility (μe) and physical contact, respectively. The SnO2/perovskite interface will contribute to a higher ΔG than the TiO2/perovskite interface due to the deeper CB of SnO2. Charge accumulation and VOC drop at the SnO2/perovskite interface can also be reduced due to the higher μe of the SnO2 ETL (1.19 × 10−3 cm2 (V−1 s−1)), which is reported to be 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the TiO2 ETL (1.59 × 10−5 cm2 (V−1 s−1)).50 Moreover, physical defects, which may lead to a reduction of the effective physical contact area (void areas), partial shortage (protruding areas), high back reaction (very thin areas), and inefficient electron transport (very thick areas), can be avoided by the novel bilayer ETL. All of this reveals the reasons why the device with the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer ETL exhibits a better overall photovoltaic performance.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum is shown in Fig. S9.† The integrated photocurrent density of the device from the IPCE spectrum (21.2 mA cm−2) is close to the JSC (23.28 mA cm−2) from the J–V curve. The spectrum starts at 300 nm with a cut off at 760 nm, consistent with the UV-Vis absorbance test result of the triple Cs/MA/FA cation mixed perovskite film. To check the reproducibility of the devices, we fabricated 58 cells using a 100 nm-TiO2/SnO2 bilayer and a SnO2 monolayer as ETLs, respectively. The corresponding histogram of the PCE is shown in Fig. 4b, indicating a good reproducibility. It is conspicuous that all the photovoltaic parameters of these devices have been notably improved after introducing the sputtered TiO2 as an underlayer. These prove the positive effect of the TiO2 underlayer on PSC performance enhancement. Fig. 4c shows the measured efficiency using maximum power point (MPP) tracking, i.e., monitoring the photocurrent at a varying bias voltage (∼0.74 V) corresponding to the maximum power output in the J–V curve. The initial photo current is 22.72 mA cm−2, giving a stabilized PCE of 14.92%. The stabilized power output sustained for 1800 s with an efficiency decrease of only 2.8% under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 intensity, indicating good stability under light soaking and no obvious charge accumulation caused by the imbalanced charge transport in the PSC. We measured the long-term stability of the PSC with the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer in ambient air under dark conditions, where the device was un-encapsulated and periodically tested at 30% RH and room temperature. As we can see from Fig. 4d, the PSC device maintained almost 100% of its initial PCE value after more than 1200 h, exhibiting excellent stability. CuPc and carbon layers are hydrophobic in nature, which is expected to protect the perovskite from moisture. We measured the static contact angles of a water droplet on the surface of bare perovskite, perovskite/CuPc, and perovskite/CuPc/carbon, as shown in the insets in Fig. 4d. The perovskite layer has a relatively hydrophilic character with a contact angle of 61°. When introducing a CuPc thin film, the sample displays a much larger contact angle of 101°, indicating the eminent ability of CuPc to serve as a moisture-proof layer. What's more, the carbon layer printed on CuPc is hydrophobic with a contact angle of 110.3° and thus can provide a dual protection for the perovskite layer, guaranteeing the stability of our perovskite devices. However, as shown in Fig. S10,† our PSC still suffers from a severe hysteresis effect, which needs to be solved in future improvements, such as interfacial modification or surface passivation.63–65 The digital photographs in Fig. 4e display a single PSC comprising a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL. The device with an active area of 3.75 cm2 is used to operate a portable fan under 1 sun conditions (ESI Video S1†). The photograph in Fig. 4f shows a 6 V and a 4 V tandem module with six or four single cells connected in series. The FTO substrates were patterned as shown in Fig. S11.† Patterned screen meshes were used to print the carbon electrode, as shown in Fig. S12.†J–V curves of our single cell, 4 V tandem module, and 6 V tandem module are recorded in Fig. 4g. Under illumination, a VOC of 4.2 V is obtained for the 4 V tandem module (active area: 8.4 cm2) and 6.7 V for the 6 V tandem module (active area: 7.2 cm2). The calculated efficiencies of these three devices are 1.67%, 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, much lower than the efficiencies in a small area (0.071 cm2). It is still challenging to achieve a high efficiency at such a large area. However, our tandem modules can still light 15 LEDs under illumination, as shown in the inset in Fig. 4g and ESI Video S1,† proving the feasibility of our fabrication process.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) characterization was carried out to further investigate the charge transport and charge recombination in the corresponding devices. As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film exhibits an emissive band peaked at around 770 nm. The PL intensity of the perovskite is significantly reduced upon using TiO2, SnO2 and TiO2/SnO2 as ETLs. The quenching efficiency is estimated to be 39%, 68% and 79%, respectively. The much lower PL intensity indicates that the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer plays an importance role in facilitating the charge transfer and hindering the recombination between electrons and holes.66 To gain more insight into the fundamental reason why the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer exhibits a better performance than the TiO2 and SnO2 single layer for the PSCs, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was performed as displayed in Fig. 5b. By biexponential fitting of the dynamic TRPL curves, the pure perovskite film exhibits a carrier lifetime of 360 ns, whereas the addition of TiO2, SnO2, TiO2/SnO2 ETLs accelerates the PL decay with reduced carrier lifetimes of 226 ns, 142 ns and 98 ns, respectively. The carrier lifetime in the perovskite film describes various radiative and non-radiative loss channels responsible for photoexcited carrier recombination. The faster electron injection rate from the perovskite to the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer is beneficial to charge separation at the perovskite/ETL interface. This shows that charge recombination will be effectively suppressed, leading to higher VOC, JSC and FF in device performance.67,68Fig. 5c displays the J–V curves of the PSCs measured in the dark. In the positive potential region, the VOC of the PSCs can be evaluated according to the intercept of the linear portion of the curve with the voltage axis.53 The results indicate that the PSC with the TiO2/SnO2 ETL exhibits higher VOC, in agreement with the result of Fig. 4a. In the negative potential region, the PSC with the TiO2/SnO2 ETL exhibits a more evident rectification property. The inset in Fig. 5c shows that the PSC with the TiO2/SnO2 ETL possesses smaller leakage current than the PSC with the SnO2 ETL. The lower dark current indicates that the TiO2 sputtered layer can prevent the current leakage, which is beneficial for the improvement of JSC and FF.69–71 Capacitance–voltage measurements were performed to further understand the effect of the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer. From the intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot shown in Fig. 5d, the built-in potential at the SnO2/perovskite contact can be obtained.31,33,72,73 The junction capacitance is calculated from the depletion approximation:74 there are no free carriers in the space charge region at the junction under investigation. (1)where C is the measured capacitance, A is the active area, V is the applied bias, ε is the static permittivity, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, q is the elementary charge, and N is the doping density of the donor. The ε of the perovskite is calculated to be approximately 30.75,76 The built-in potential is a direct signature of the presence of a built-in field that efficiently drives the separation of photo-generated carriers. Moreover, the built-in field of the depletion region suppresses the back reaction of electrons from the SnO2 film to the perovskite film. The depletion width is calculated according to.77 (2)where Na and Nd are the doping densities of the acceptor and donor, respectively. The values in previous literature for the doping density of SnO2 thin films start at Na = 1 × 1018 cm−3.78,79 Using eqn (2), the depletion widths on the n-side and p-side were calculated, as listed in Table 2. For the device based on SnO2, the depletion width on the n-side is 17.46 nm and that on the p-side is 4.23 μm. After introducing a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL, the depletion widths are extended to 18.91 nm on the n-side and 5.46 μm on the p-side. The schematic band bending diagram is shown in Fig. 5e. The thicknesses of the SnO2 layer and perovskite layer are 20 nm and 600 nm, respectively. This suggests that almost the whole SnO2 film and the entire perovskite layer are depleted after introducing TiO2/SnO2 as the ETL. Importantly, the built-in field in the depletion region can also assist in the charge separation of the photo-generated carriers, making a wider depletion region which is more beneficial for enhanced photovoltaic performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, by utilizing a TiO2/SnO2 bilayer as the ETL, improved device performance for the carbon based planar-heterojunction PSCs was demonstrated. The enhancement mechanism was studied systematically by using SEM, AFM, XPS, PL, Mott–Schottky and diode model calculations. It was found that the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer was beneficial to electron extraction and transportation, thus resulting in a suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, the device with the TiO2/SnO2 bilayer has a wider depletion region, in favor of an enhanced photovoltaic performance. VOC, JSC and FF are improved and an impressive PCE of 15.39% is obtained, much higher than those of reported carbon based PSCs.33–36,80–82 With the structure of FTO/TiO2/SnO2/perovskite/CuPc/carbon, the device showed almost no decrease of PCE after 1200 h when stored in ambient air. In addition, a large area single-junction PSC was applied to operate a portable fan and tandem modules were also used to drive LEDs, demonstrating a practical application for PSCs. More importantly, the whole device was processed at a temperature below 200 °C, facilitating potential application of PSCs in monolithic tandem devices and paving the way for the development of carbon based flexible PSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
An FTO substrate with a 14 Ω □−1 sheet resistance (NSG-14) was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co. Ltd. (NSG) in Japan. Anhydrous ethanol, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 37 wt% hydrochloric acid in water, zinc powder and SnCl2·2H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The anhydrous chlorobenzene (ACS, 99.5%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The N,N-dimethylformamide (≥99.9%) and copper(II) phthalocyanine (99%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin biochemical technology co. LTD. All the perovskite materials, including FAI, MABr, PbI2, PbBr2 and CsI, were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. The TiO2 target was bought from China New Metal Company with 5N purity. The low-temperature processed commercial carbon paste was purchased from Shenzhen DongDaLai Chemical Co., Ltd. All materials were used without further purification.
4.2 Device fabrication
FTO substrates were chemically etched with diluted hydrochloric acid (2 mol L−1) and zinc powder. After ultrasonically cleaned by acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water, respectively, the FTO substrates were further cleaned using UV-ozone for 30 min to remove organic residues. A TiO2 film was fabricated using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The TiO2 target has a purity of 99.99% and is 90 mm in diameter and 3 mm in thickness. The chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure of ∼1.3 × 10−3 Pa before deposition. The RF sputtering processes were performed in pure Ar gas (99.999%). The gas flow rate of Ar was controlled using a gas flowmeter and the chamber was kept at a working pressure of 0.5 Pa. A pre-sputtering process for 10 min was also necessary in order to clean the target surface. The flow rate of pure Ar was fixed at 20 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) and the applied power was set as 150 W. The film thickness was adjusted by the sputtering time. The SnO2 layer was prepared by double spin coating a 0.1 M SnCl2·2H2O ethanol solution with a 5000 rpm spin rate for 30 s, followed by heat-treatment at 195 °C for 1 h. Before the deposition of the perovskite layer, the sample was further treated using UV-ozone for 30 min since the SnO2 surface was hydrophobic. The preparation of the Cs/MA/FA perovskite film can be found everywhere. Briefly, the mixed-cation lead mixed-halide perovskite solution was prepared from a precursor solution composed of 1 M FAI, 1.1 M PbI2, 0.2 M MABr and 0.22 PbBr2 in a 4:1 (v/v) mixture of anhydrous DMF:DMSO. Then 1.5 M stock solution of CsI in DMSO was added to the above solution in a 5:95 volume ratio. This triple cation perovskite solution was deposited through a two-step spin coating program (10 s at 1000 rpm and 20 s at 5000 rpm) with dripping of chlorobenzene as the anti-solvent during the second step, 5 s before the end. The spin-coated perovskite film was transferred onto a hot plate for annealing at 100 °C for 1 h. During the heat treatment process, 5 μL DMSO was dropped into a small ceramic crucible, and then a glass Petri dish was used to cover the sample and crucible. The CuPc hole conductor layer was deposited on the perovskite film by vacuum evaporation (<1 × 10−3 Pa) using a quartz crystal monitor to determine the thickness and deposition rate. The deposition of the carbon CE was conducted by a doctor blade method, and dried at 80 °C for 15 min.
4.3 Measurement and characterization
The morphology of the perovskite surface and cross-sectional structure of the solar cells were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL). The formation of the perovskite absorber layer was further confirmed by XRD analysis (PANalytical PW3040/60) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) from 10° to 50°. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were carried out on a Kratos AXIS Ultra-DLD ultra-high-vacuum photoemission spectroscopy system with an Al Kα radiation source. A UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV 2600, Shimadzu) was utilized to obtain the transmittance spectra and the absorption spectra of different films. The morphologies and roughness of the perovskite surfaces were characterized by AFM (SPM9700). The contact angle measurements were performed on a JC2000D1 contact angle meter (Zhongchen digital technology equipment Co., LTD, Shanghai). The steady-state photoluminescence measurements were taken using a spectrometer (LabRAM HR800, Horiba JobinYvon) under an excitation laser with a wavelength of 532 nm. The time-resolved photoluminescence decay transients were measured at 770 nm using excitation with a 478 nm light pulse from a HORIBA Scientific DeltaPro fluorimeter. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight (Oriel 94043A, Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) with an electrochemical station (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands), previously calibrated with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. The measurements were performed with a black metal mask with a circular aperture (0.071 cm2) smaller than the active area of the square solar cell. The IPCE spectra were recorded by employing a xenon lamp coupled with a monochromator (TLS1509, Zolix) controlled using a computer. The Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out at the frequency of 5000 Hz in the dark with the PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation.
