, Accepted 1st March 2016First published on 8th March 2016AbstractPolymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention as a promising candidate for potential clean and renewable energy technology. Dramatic progress in bulk heterojunction PSCs has been achieved with power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 10%. As a promising cathode interfacial layer in practical device application, the solution-processable pure ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) always lead to surface charge recombination, and hence varied surface modification of the ZnO layer has been developed to enhance the device performance. Herein, we report single-junction PSCs with PCE as high as 10.04% in the conventional structure, employing pure ZnO as a cathode interlayer. It is found that the surface composition of ZnO NPs strongly affects the interfacial charge recombination and final photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. The fabricated PSCs employing the optimized pure ZnO NPs feature both a thick active layer and a thick ZnO interlayer, and demonstrate a negligible light-soaking effect and cathode selection. This work provides efficient PSCs in which all layers can meet the requirements of various printing techniques in practical large-scale manufacture.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on a conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor bulk heterojunction have been intensively explored in the past decades due to their attractive features such as mechanical flexibility, light weight and potential large-area roll-to-roll manufacturing via solution-processing.1,2 Synergetic efforts on the optimization of polymer donors, nanoscale donor/acceptor phase separation and interface engineering have strongly boosted the development of organic photovoltaics with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction PSCs surpassing 10%.3,4 However, the device configuration of some highly efficient PSCs is difficult to be transferred to the large scale roll-to-roll manufacturing of PSCs due to some limitations.5,6 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop effective strategies to fabricate high-efficiency PSCs with the device configuration meeting the requirement of practical manufacturing of PSCs. For the PSCs, the interfaces between the active layer and electrodes strongly influence the photovoltaic performance, and interfacial layers are always introduced to suppress charge recombination and enhance charge extraction.7–9 Various kinds of interfacial layers have been developed including polymers, solution-processed transition metal oxides and more complex structures, etc. Polymeric interlayers such as conjugated polyelectrolytes poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), ethanol-soluble poly[9,9-bis (6′-diethoxylphosphorylhexyl)fluorene] (PF-EP) and insulating polyelectrolyte polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) have been successfully applied as cathode interlayers to enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.10–13 However, the optimized thickness of the polymeric interfacial layers is typically less than 10 nm due to their low conductivity, and the PCE of the devices is very sensitive to the thickness of interlayers.14 Such thin interlayers are difficult to control precisely in current large-scale solution-processing techniques, and thus limit their practical application. Solution-processed transition metal oxides such as sol–gel TiOx and pure ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are also used as cathode interfacial materials in PSCs, but the resultant devices often exhibit obvious interfacial charge recombination and light-soaking effect.15–17 In addition, aluminum (Al) has been widely used as the cathode in PSCs prepared by thermal evaporation due to its low work function. Nevertheless, it is prone to oxidation and difficult to apply in practical solution-processed manufacturing of PSCs.18,19 These facts make clear and provide guidelines for the further development. Based on the above regards, an ideal cathode interfacial layer applicable in practical fabrication of PSCs should not only reduce effectively the possible charge recombination, but also show negligible thickness dependence and electrode selection. Crystalline ZnO NPs are a promising cathode interfacial material in practical device application due to its inherent advantages such as high transparency, environmental stability, low-cost preparation and solution-processability. However, the reported PSCs based on the pure ZnO cathode interfacial layer did not show very outstanding performance due to their surface charge recombination. Thus, post modification or passivation of the ZnO surfaces with conjugated polyelectrolytes, self-assembled monolayers and fullerene derivatives has been developed to restrain charge recombination and enhance the photovoltaic performance.20–23 This bi-layer structure not only increases the processing complexity, but also the thin modification layer is difficult to process in practical application.
Herein, we report the single-junction PSCs with PCE as high as 10.04% in conventional structure employing pure ZnO as a cathode interlayer. It is found that the preparation conditions of ZnO NPs strongly affect the interfacial charge recombination and final photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. The resulted regular PSCs do not show obvious ZnO-thickness-dependent effect and light-soaking phenomenon, and optical interference effect is also eliminated by employing thick active layer. In addition, the fabricated PSCs with optimized ZnO NPs interlayer do not show obvious cathode selection. The PSCs fabricated with Al, Ag and Au cathodes demonstrate comparable PCE values of 10.04%, 9.82% and 8.94%, respectively. This work provides the efficient PSCs in which all layers can meet the requirement of various printing techniques in practical large-scale manufacture.
2. Experimental section
Synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO NPs was synthesized by using modified Beek's method.24 Potassium hydroxide, zinc acetate and methanol were used as received. Potassium hydroxide (0.02 M) was dissolved in methanol to form a clear solution. Zinc acetate (0.01 M) was dissolved into methanol and heated to different temperatures (60, 64 or 66 °C). When the temperature of zinc acetate solution was stable, the potassium hydroxide solution was added dropwise into the zinc acetate solution under stirring. The reaction was stirred for about 3.5 h. Then the precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with methanol. The products were dissolved into 1-butanol with concentrations of 15 mg mL−1 or 20 mg mL−1, and were directly used to fabricate PSC devices.
Characterization of ZnO NPs
UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the ZnO NPs films were recorded using Agilent Cary 60 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and HITACHI F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded using a FEI TECNAI F20 system operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The AFM images of the ZnO films were obtained using a SPA-300HV instrument with a SPI3800N controller in tapping mode. XRD was carried out using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The XPS measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 using monochromatized Al Kα (hν = 1486.8 eV) excitation. UPS were carried out with a helium discharge lamp excitation (21.2 eV) and a hemispherical energy analyzer (Specs PHOIBOS 150). The samples were biased at −10 V to separate the sample and the secondary edge for the analyzer.
Fabrication and measurement of PSCs
PSCs in conventional structure were fabricated as follows. The ITO-coated glass substrate (15 Ω □−1) were cleaned with a standard procedure by ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol each for 15 min, and then rinsed with de-ionized water three times. The cleaned ITO substrates were dried in an oven at 130 °C for 1 h and subsequently were treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. A 30 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS (Baytron Al 4083) were spin-coated on the ITO glass substrate. PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were then annealed at 140 °C for 30 min. Next, the substrates were transferred into the glove box filled with high-purity N2 to spin-coat the active layer and ZnO interlayer. PTB7-Th (10 mg) and PC71BM (15 mg) were solubilized over 12 h in 1 mL chlorobenzene (CB) containing 3% (v/v) 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO). The as-prepared solution was spin-coated to form a 240 nm-thick PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM layers were aged for 45 min and then annealed at 50 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the samples were spin-rinsed with methanol at 3000 rpm for 30 s. ZnO layers with different thicknesses were prepared via spin-coating from its 1-butanol solution by changing the spin-coating rate. Finally, a cathode of Al, Ag or Au (100 nm) was thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure of 4 × 10−6 Torr. The active area of each device was 0.08 cm2 defined by the overlapping area of the ITO and metal electrodes. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter in the glove box. A Newport solar simulator with an AM1.5G filter was used to provide 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light for illumination of the photovoltaic cells. The light intensity was determined with a calibrated silicon diode with a KG-5 visible color filter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed with an Enlitech QE-R spectral response measurements system under short-circuit conditions in air. The thickness of various layers was measured with a Dektak 6M Stylus Profiler.
3. Results and discussion
A series of ZnO NPs were obtained through fine adjustment of the reaction temperature at 60 °C (ZnO-1), 64 °C (ZnO-2) and 66 °C (ZnO-3), respectively. The particle sizes and crystallography of the obtained colloidal ZnO NPs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† all the as-prepared ZnO NPs were indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite structure and appeared partial aggregates and rather monodispersity with the size of about 7 nm. UV-Vis absorption spectra of three kinds of ZnO NPs films were identical as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† and optical band gap (Eg) was calculated to be 3.5 eV based on the Tauc's formula. As depicted by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. S4,† the films of the three kinds of ZnO NPs were smooth with root-mean-square (r.m.s.) roughness of 2.98 nm (ZnO-1), 3.06 nm (ZnO-2) and 3.21 nm (ZnO-3), respectively.
Single-junction PSCs with a conventional structure were fabricated employing a blend of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), which was shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c) together with the chemical structures of PTB7-Th and PC71BM. It was mentioned that the thickness of all the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layers were fixed at about 240 nm to eliminate the influence of different ZnO thickness on the active layer absorption due to optical interference effect in the device structure.25 Fig. 2(a) shows the illuminated J–V curves of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs without or with 37 nm-thick ZnO NPs interlayers and Al as the cathode. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of these PSCs are summarized in Table 1. We can see that the device with bare Al cathode shows a VOC of 0.76 V, a JSC of 17.21 mA cm−2 and a FF of 59.8%, leading to an overall PCE of 7.83%. The insertion of ZnO NPs layer between the active layer and Al cathode enhances the photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices due to improved JSC and FF. The improvement of JSC and FF is strongly related to the prepared ZnO NPs. The PSC with ZnO-1 as cathode interfacial layer demonstrates a JSC of 17.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.3%, together with a VOC of 0.77 V to give a PCE of 8.89%. The JSC and FF are gradually increased to 18.85 mA cm−2 and 68.3% for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSC with ZnO-3 cathode interlayers and finally the PCE is enhanced to 10.04%, which is among the highest PCE for the conventional single-junction PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs. The increased JSC and FF indicate the possible charge recombination is suppressed and charge collection is improved. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 2(b). It can be seen that all the devices show very high quantum efficiency over 70% in a range of 350–750 nm. The calculated JSC from EQE curves shown in Table 1 are in good agreement with the measured JSC with an error less than 2%.

As mentioned above, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with ZnO NPs as cathode interfacial layer have an identical device configuration and the same thicknesses of various layers. The improvement of JSC and FF for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with various ZnO NPs are mainly attributed to the different nature of ZnO NPs prepared under different conditions. The higher JSC and FF imply that the interfacial recombination resulted from surface traps of ZnO NPs may be reduced for the PSCs with ZnO-3 as interfacial layer. Some literatures have disclosed that surface traps of ZnO may result in severe charge recombination in PSCs.15,21 To shed light on the possible changes of the ZnO NPs prepared under different conditions, the photoluminescence (PL) from the defects of ZnO NPs were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the ZnO NPs emit yellow-green light peaked at ca. 530 nm for three kinds of ZnO NPs films, which can be attributed to a singly ionized surface oxygen vacancy in ZnO as shown in Fig. 1(b).26 This kind of defects would trap charges and result in charge recombination in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 3, the fluorescence intensity of the three kinds of ZnO NPs films with the same thickness were gradually decreased from ZnO-1 to ZnO-3, implying that the concentration of oxygen vacancy was gradually reduced.
 Fig. 3  Fluorescent emission spectra of the three kinds of ZnO films with a same thickness of 37 nm excitated at a wavelength of 340 nm. 
To further understand the oxygen vacancies on ZnO NPs, we have investigated the surface elemental compositions and chemical state of three kinds of ZnO NPs using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the results are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f), the Zn 2p XPS spectra of the three kinds of ZnO NPs show one peak at 1021.60 eV for Zn 2p3/2 core level, which are deconvoluted with Gaussian–Lorentzian function and only one kind of oxidation state Zn2+ exists. The O 1s peaks of three kinds of ZnO samples shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c) were fitted into two peaks at 530.05 eV and 531.56 eV, assigning to Zn–O band and hydroxyl groups bonded to metal atoms (Zn–OH), respectively.25 The proportion of hydroxyl groups were decreased from 43.21% (ZnO-1), 40.65% (ZnO-2) to 39.14% (ZnO-3), demonstrating that O-vacancies were reduced gradually. These results are in consistent with fluorescence results of ZnO NPs.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed to detect the changes of work function (WF) of the three kinds of ZnO NPs prepared under different temperatures. The UPS spectra of the three kinds of ZnO NPs films are given in Fig. S5.† Accordingly, the WF decreased along with the decrease of oxygen-vacancy amounts. The WF of the three kinds of ZnO NPs is 3.84 eV (ZnO-1), 3.74 eV (ZnO-2) and 3.64 eV (ZnO-3), respectively, which is in concert with oxygen vacancies decreasing from ZnO-1 to ZnO-3 obtained from the XPS and fluorescence results.27 The ZnO NPs prepared with sol–gel chemistry always show n-type semiconductor characteristics. Since the Eg of the three kinds of ZnO NPs are same (3.5 eV), the decreased WF of the resultant ZnO indicates that n-type behavior becomes stronger from ZnO-1 and ZnO-2 to ZnO-3. Decrease of oxygen vacancies in ZnO would reduce the density of traps and move the Fermi level towards the conduction band. The enhanced n-type characteristic is assumed to improve its conductivity. When it is used as cathode interfacial layer in PSCs, especially for PSCs with thick interfacial layer, it would favor to reduce the series resistance and improve charge-collection efficiency. We have fabricated simple devices with a structure of glass/ITO/ZnO (97 nm)/Al (Au) to estimate the conductivity changes of the three kinds of ZnO NPs prepared under different temperatures. The dark I–V curves of these devices are shown in Fig. S6.† It can be seen that these devices show an ohmic behavior and the ZnO-3 based device show a lower ohmic resistance than the other two devices. These results indicate that the ZnO-3 film may possess a higher conductivity than the other two types of ZnO films.
The photocurrent–density (Jph) versus the effective bias voltage (Veff) of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs without or with different ZnO interfacial layer were further measured. Jph was defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represented the current density under illumination and in the dark condition, respectively. Veff was determined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage which photocurrent is zero, and Vbias is the applied external voltage.28 Therefore, Veff would reflect the capability of the carrier transport and the photocurrent extraction. The free charge carriers are assumed to be totally extracted to the corresponding electrodes at high Veff.29 As shown in the Fig. 5, the Jph reach the saturation at Veff = −2.44 V (no ZnO), −1.76 V (ZnO-1), −1.70 V (ZnO-2), and −1.61 V (ZnO-3), respectively. These results indicate that the insertion of ZnO NPs interfacial layers suppresses the charge recombination and improves the charge-extraction efficiency, and the charge-extraction capability are gradually increased from ZnO-1, ZnO-2 to ZnO-3.

The PSCs using solution-processed pure ZnO NPs and TiOx as cathode interfacial layers have often shown light-soaking effect.12,17 It is always argued that the traps or defects on the transition metal oxides result in low conductivity and poor contact with metal cathode.12,21,30 Upon exposing the devices under UV light for several minutes, the traps or defects are filled with photo-generated electrons and the charge-transport capability of the metal oxide interfacial layer together with the cathode contact are ameliorated.30,31 At this time, the photovoltaic performance of the devices is recovered to normal status. It has been reported a few effective approaches to eliminate this kinds of light-soaking effect by doping ethanolamine or PEIE in metal oxide films to passivate the traps or defects on metal oxides.12,32 Herein, the photovoltaic performance of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with optimized ZnO-3 cathode interfacial layer was measured under different light-soaking time and the results are shown in Fig. 6(a). It can be seen that the devices demonstrate an almost identical illuminated J–V characteristics with exposing time from 0 to 6 minutes, implying a negligible light-soaking effect. The current reported high-efficiency PSCs have always employed a thin interfacial layer to enhance the photovoltaic performance as it can reduce the series resistance. However, such a thin interfacial layer (less than 10 nm) is difficult to process other than the spin-coating method. The PSCs with thickness-insensitive interfacial layer have drawn attention from a viewpoint of further commercialization.33 We have fabricated a series of PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with ZnO interlayer thickness ranging from 15 to 96 nm. The illuminated J–V curves of these devices based on ZnO-3 interlayer are illustrated in Fig. 6(b) and the variation of the detailed photovoltaic parameters with ZnO thickness is plotted in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† Since the thickness of the active layer is up to 240 nm, the optical interference effect of ZnO interlayer on the active layer absorption in the device structure has been suppressed. These devices demonstrate almost the same illuminated J–V characteristics with ZnO interfacial layer ranging from 15 to 96 nm. In more details, the VOC keeps at 0.76–0.78 V, the JSC slightly varies between 18 and 19.2 mA cm−2, and the FF keeps at 64.7–66.3%. Accordingly, the PCE values are above 9.13% for all the devices. In other words, both the light-soaking effect and interlayer thickness dependence are negligible for the PSCs with optimized ZnO-3 interfacial layer.

The PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs using Ag or Au as the cathode were also fabricated to estimate the availability of the prepared ZnO interfacial layer to other metals. Al is prone to oxidation and impossible to be processed with solution-processing. Au and Ag are promising solution-processable cathode material in all-solution-processed PSCs. The illuminated J–V curves of PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs using Ag and Au as the cathode without or with three kinds of ZnO NPs as the cathode interfacial layer are plotted in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are summarized in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 7(a), the control device with bare Ag cathode showed very poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of merely 1.46% and a low VOC of 0.29 V. With the insertion of the three kinds of ZnO cathode interfacial layers, the photovoltaic performance was dramatically improved. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with Ag as cathode and ZnO-1, ZnO-2 and ZnO-3 as the cathode interfacial layer demonstrate PCEs of 9.24%, 9.58% and 9.82%, respectively. The device with ZnO-3 demonstrates the highest PCE, which is similar to that of the devices based on Al cathode. Au is also used as the cathode to fabricate the PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs, which possesses high work function and is commonly used to prepare the hole-only devices.34 As shown in Fig. 7(b), the photovoltaic effect was not observed in the device with Au cathode and without ZnO interfacial layer due to a low built-in potential. With the insertion of ZnO NPs interfacial layers, the photovoltaic performance was dramatically improved. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with Au as cathode and ZnO-1, ZnO-2 and ZnO-3 as the cathode interfacial layer demonstrate PCEs of 8.38%, 8.81% and 8.94%, respectively, with the ZnO-3 exhibiting the highest PCE. The achieved PCEs of 9.82% and 8.94% for the ZnO-3 based PSCs with Ag and Au cathodes are comparable to 10.04% of the corresponding device with Al cathode.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated conventional single-junction PTB7-Th:PC71BM PSCs with PCE over 10% by employing pure solution-processed ZnO NPs as the cathode interfacial layer. It is found that surface composition of ZnO NPs strongly affect the interfacial charge recombination and final photovoltaic performance of the resultant devices. In contrast to the previously reported high-efficiency PSCs, our reported PSCs are featured with both thick active layer and ZnO interlayer. In addition to the negligible ZnO interlayer thickness dependence, the PSCs employing this kind of ZnO interlayer show weak cathode metal selection. The PSCs fabricated with Al, Ag and Au cathodes demonstrate comparable PCE values of 10.04%, 9.82% and 8.94%, respectively. This work provides the efficient PSCs in which all layers can meet the requirement of various printing techniques in practical large-scale manufacture.
