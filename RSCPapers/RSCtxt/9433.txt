    , Accepted 10th April 2018First published on 10th April 2018AbstractNowadays, robustly coupling electroactive inorganics with bicontinuous graphene-based films is highly desirable for high-performance energy storage devices and electrocatalysts. Herein, free-standing heteroatom-doped edge-enriched 3D rivet graphene (H-3DRG) film with high flexibility and conductivity was obtained as a substrate to deposit vertically arranged NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanoneedles via a hydrothermal approach and hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanostructures by further in situ anion exchange process without destroying the original vertical architecture. The carbon nanoparticles located on the surface of bicontinuous 3D porous graphene show gradient and edge-enriched structure, which can provide much more nucleation sites and better attachment of electroactive inorganics than traditional 3D porous graphene films with interconnected carbon layers prepared by the chemical vapor deposition process. Such outstanding structural advantages accelerate the reaction kinetics and enhance electrochemical activities which mean that H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH- and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4-based asymmetric supercapacitor devices both show high energy densities of 39.4 W h kg−1 and 37.6 W h kg−1 based on the entire devices, respectively. Furthermore, these hybrids also favor the oxygen evolution reaction process, which deliver a mass oxygen production current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 289 and 264 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, alternative energy storage devices and electrocatalysts are being developed intensively because of the ever-increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy.1–3 Among them, asymmetric supercapacitors are the most favorable energy storage devices due to their large potential window, high specific capacitance, and high energy and power densities.4,5 Furthermore, electrochemical water splitting has drawn much attention as a promising conversion into chemical fuels from solar or wind energy.6,7 Nevertheless, the complex four-electron redox processes of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) greatly hinder the realization of efficient water oxidation reactions.8,9 An appropriate electrocatalyst is the critical requirement of efficient OER.
Recently, transition metallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and transition metallic sulfides (TMSs) as electroactive materials have been used to achieve large capacity due to their good anion exchange property and tuned active components.10–16 Importantly, the LDHs and TMSs also exhibit excellent catalytic activity for electrocatalytic water splitting to H2 and O2, which attract significant attention.17,18 Nevertheless, the LDHs and TMSs always suffer from poor conductivity and stability, especially LDHs, which limit their electrochemical performance during practical applications in energy storage and electrocatalysis.19–21 Recently, integrated architectures with electroactive inorganics and graphene combined have become highly desirable for high-performance energy storage and conversion devices, which can accelerate mass transport, promote electron transfer and improve stability.22–24
The oxygen-containing functional groups and edge sites on the surface of GO could act as anchoring sites for the nucleation and growth of electroactive inorganics, which can integrate a stable architecture.24–26 However, some serious drawbacks limit the practical applications of rGO-based composites. For example, the agglomeration and restacking of rGO sheets result in a severe decrease of electrochemical performances.3,27,28 Furthermore, the large interface resistance between each graphene sheet dramatically limits the conductivity and rate capability of hybrid electrodes under the high loading of electroactive inorganics.29–31 Free-standing 3D graphene films obtained by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process using porous metal foams as the substrate and catalyst display high conductivity and interconnected structure, which are ideal substrates to combine with electroactive inorganics even under a high loading condition. However, the bicontinuous architecture shows high crystallinity and has no obvious edges and defects, which makes it very difficult to introduce abundant heteroatom dopants to improve the compatibility of graphene films with electroactive inorganics. Therefore, an edge-enriched bicontinuous 3D porous graphene film which can provide abundant nucleation sites for electroactive inorganics is highly desirable for high-performance energy storage devices and electrocatalysts.32–36
Among various LDHs, NiCo-LDH is widely used as an electroactive material in energy storage or electrocatalysis due to the simple synthetic approach and richness of reserves.37,38 In addition, NiCo2S4 is also considered as an excellent faradic material in the electrochemical field because of its high electric conductivity which is ∼100 times as high as that of LDH materials.39,40 More importantly, NiCo2S4 is very easy to obtain through a simple anion-exchange approach.41 Herein, we design and fabricate heteroatom (nitrogen or oxygen)-doped edge-enriched 3D rivet graphene (H-3DRG) films with ultra-low weight, high flexibility and conductivity for the deposition of NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4. Abundant carbon nanoparticles located onto the surface of 3D porous graphene show gradient and edge-enriched structure, which can provide much more nucleation sites and better attachment of electroactive inorganics than traditional 3D porous graphene films with interconnected carbon layers prepared by the CVD process. In addition, the mechanical strength and integrity of the 3D graphene film would be effectively improved due to the existence of carbon nanoparticles. N and O heteroatom dopants are introduced to enhance the hydrophilicity and features of the surface of 3D rivet graphene to further improve the compatibility between inorganic active materials and graphene substrate. As a result, large amounts of vertically arranged NiCo-LDH nanoneedles were in situ assembled onto the inner and outer sides of H-3DRG film, and hierarchical NiCo2S4 nanostructures were fabricated based on anion exchange reaction and Kirkendall effects. The excellent structural characteristics and merits make both H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids as ideal electrodes for electrochemical applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of heteroatom-doped 3D rivet graphene (H-3DRG) and heteroatom-doped 3D graphene (H-3DG) structures
At first, the nanoporous copper substrate described in previous literature35 was transferred into the low temperature zone of a horizontal tube furnace. Subsequently, the furnace was directly heated to 900 °C under 20 Torr pressure with a mixed gas flow of Ar and H2 at 500 and 200 sccm, respectively. Then, the sample was pushed into the center of the furnace for 1 min. C2H2 (50 sccm) and NH3 (30 sccm) were introduced subsequently for 3 min to fabricate NPC@3DRG hybrids. The samples were pulled out to the low temperature zone and cooled rapidly at a rate of 100 °C min−1 under Ar gas flow at atmospheric pressure. For comparison, the as-prepared NPC substrate was annealed at 900 °C for 3 min under a mixed atmosphere of Ar and H2 to fabricate a bulky microporous copper with smooth surface. C2H2 (50 sccm) and NH3 (30 sccm) were introduced subsequently for 3 min to fabricate NPC@3DG hybrids. Free-standing 3DRG and 3DG films were obtained via acidic etching of NPC in 5 g FeCl3 + 10 mL HCl + 100 mL H2O mixture solution for 12 h, and then immersed in concentrated nitric acid solution for 4 h at room temperature. Finally, the H-3DRG and H-3DG films were washed by water rinsing and dried on a heating platform directly.
2.2 Synthesis of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH, NiCo-LDH, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4
The above mentioned H-3DRG was used as the substrate for the subsequent growth of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids. Vertically arranged NiCo-LDH nanoneedles were grown on the H-3DRG film using a hydrothermal approach. Briefly, 0.025 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.05 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.3 M urea were dissolved in 70 mL aqueous solution. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) and a piece of H-3DRG film was immersed into the solution and maintained at 90 °C for each of 5, 10, 15 and 20 h. The as-synthesized sample was collected and washed several times with water and ethanol, successively, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The samples are denoted as H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-xh, where x is the loading time (h) of NiCo-LDH. The pristine NiCo-LDH sample was fabricated under the same conditions without 3DRG. Then, 1 M Na2S was dissolved in 70 mL aqueous solution and transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (100 mL) after vigorous stirring for 10 min. The as-prepared H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h sample was dispersed into the Na2S solution and kept at 90 °C for 20 h. The as-synthesized H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 was collected and washed several times with water and ethanol, successively, and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The pristine NiCo2S4 sample was fabricated under the same conditions without 3DRG.
2.3 Synthesis of nitrogen and oxygen co-doped 3D hierarchical nanoporous graphene (NO-3DnpG) films
The as-prepared NPC was transferred into the center of a horizontal tube furnace and directly heated to the reaction temperature of HG under Ar (500 sccm) and H2 (200 sccm) flow. The HG growth was performed at 200 °C with a mixture of C2H2 (20 sccm), Ar (500 sccm) and H2 (200 sccm) for 20 min. Then, the samples were pulled outside of the center, and the furnace was heated to 800 °C under NH3 (10 sccm) and H2 (200 sccm) flow. After that, the samples were pushed into the center of the furnace for 3 min, and then pulled out. The furnace was opened immediately, and the inner quartz tube was cooled with a fan to room temperature. The NPC substrates were dissolved by 5 g FeCl3 + 10 mL HCl + 100 mL H2O solution for 12 h, and then immersed in concentrated nitric acid solution for 4 h at room temperature.
2.4 Computational methods
The projector augmented wave formalism of density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) was used for the system energy and electronic structure calculations, and the details are given in ESI.†
2.5 Electrochemical performance testing
The H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 and NO-3DnpG films were directly used as electrodes to test the electrochemical performances with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode cell in 6 M KOH aqueous solution, in which platinum foil and Hg/HgO electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The electrodes of NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 powder samples were fabricated by mixing the sample powder, carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene with ethanol in a mass ratio of 80:15:5. The mixtures were dried at 100 °C overnight under vacuum, and then pressed onto nickel foams to make electrodes. The specific capacities of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4, NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 powder samples at different current densities were calculated by the following formula: Qb = (IΔt)/(3600 × m)(1)where Qb is the specific capacity (mA h g−1), I is the discharge current (mA) and m is the mass of the active material (g).
The specific capacitance of a NO-3DnpG film was calculated by the following formula: CS = (IΔt)/(mΔV)(2)where CS is the specific capacitance of electrodes (F g−1), I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge time (s), ΔV is the voltage range after ohmic drop (V), and m is the mass of the electrode (g).
Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) were fabricated with the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid as the positive electrode and NO-3DnpG film as the negative electrode to fabricate H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG ASCs, and the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid as the positive electrode and NO-3DnpG film as the negative electrode to fabricate H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs. The mass ratios of the positive electrodes and negative electrodes were calculated by the specific capacity. The energy density (E) and power density (P) of ASCs were calculated based on the total mass of the positive and negative electrodes using the following formulas: Q = (I × Δt)/3600 × m(3) E = (∫V(Q) dQ)/M(4) P = E/Δt(5)where Q is the specific capacitance of ASC devices (mAh g−1) and M is the total mass of positive and negative electrodes (g).
2.6 Electrocatalyst performance testing
All the electrocatalytic measurements were performed in a three-electrode system with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation in 1 M KOH (pH = 14, saturated with pure Ar) using a SCE electrode as the reference electrode and a platinum foil electrode as the counter electrode at room temperature, and all the potentials were calibrated to a RHE. The H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 films were directly used as the electrodes to test the electrocatalytic performances. Electrodes of NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 powder samples were fabricated by dispersing 5 mg of the sample powder in a 1 mL water-isopropanol mixed solution (volume ratio of 3:1), which contains 30 μL Nafion solution by sonicating for at least 30 min to form a homogeneous link. Then 5 μL of the dispersion (containing 20 μg of catalyst) was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode with 3 mm diameter. Finally, the as-prepared catalyst film was allowed to dry at room temperature. All measurements were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 to minimize the capacitive current.
2.7 Characterization
The structures of H-3DRG, NiCo-LDH, NiCo2S4, H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 and NO-3DnpG were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800) and transmitting electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai G2 F20). A micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia microscope) with a 532 nm laser was used in the Raman study. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with frequency ranging from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz were conducted with an electrochemical station (CHI 660E). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms of H-3DRG and NO-3DnpG were measured at 77 K using an AutosorbiQ instrument (Quantachrome, USA). The total surface area was calculated with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution data were calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and DFT methods based on the adsorption and desorption data. The functional groups on the surface of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Axis Ultra DLD) with an Al Kα (mono) anode at an energy of 120 W in a vacuum of 5 × 10−9 Torr.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication and characterization of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids
The overall strategy for the fabrication of NiCo-LDH and derived sulfide on superhydrophilic H-3DRG is illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, the H-3DRG film was fabricated by the CVD approach using NPC as the template and catalyst (Fig. 1a). NiCo-LDH with vertically arranged nanoneedle structure was grown onto both the inner and outer surface of H-3DRG film through a facile hydrothermal process (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, NiCo-LDH was in situ transformed into NiCo2S4 by the ion-exchange method (Fig. 1c).

Fabrication and characterization of H-3DRG. 
In a typical experiment, NPC foil with pore size of 30–50 nm and thickness of ∼100 μm was obtained by a chemical de-alloying approach, which has been reported in our previous work.33,35 Then, the as-prepared NPC was annealed at 900 °C for 1 min under a mixed atmosphere of Ar and H2 to increase the size of NPC ligaments for the preparation of 3DRG material. After that, a rough graphene-based film was grown onto the surface of coarse NPC substrate at 900 °C under a mixed atmosphere of C2H2, NH3, Ar and H2 for 3 min. Furthermore, free-standing rough 3D graphene-based film with thickness of 70 μm and pore size of 1–2 μm was obtained after removing Cu backbone and further modifying with HNO3, which is shown in Fig. 2a and S1a (ESI†). Especially, the rough 3D graphene-based film shows a free-standing structure and high flexibility, which can be used directly as electrodes of energy storage devices (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The high-resolution SEM and TEM images show that abundant prismoid-like carbon rivets are attached onto the surface of 3D porous graphene (Fig. 2b and c). Interestingly, each carbon rivet displays straight layer structure (Fig. 2d) and provides a large amount of edges (inset of Fig. 2d), which is significantly different from the cage-structured carbon catalyzed by metal nanoparticles.36 To indicate and understand the advantages of the edge-enriched structure for the adsorption and combination with metal ions, DFT calculations were performed. A graphene layer with edges was constructed, and a Ni atom was placed near the carbon atoms located at each of the edge and center of the graphene (Fig. S2, ESI†). It was found that the carbon atoms located at the edge of graphene adsorb Ni atoms with much higher energy (2.56 eV) than those in the center (2.21 eV) because the boundary activity is dramatically increased due to the discontinuity of π bonds. Moreover, the charge density difference at C/Ni interface indicates strong chemical bonds between Ni and carbon atoms located at the edge of graphene (Fig. S2c, d, g and h, ESI†). Thus, the carbon atoms at the edge of carbon layers show much more activity and are easier to stably combine with metal ions than those in the center.

(f) HRTEM image of red area in (e). The insets show the selected area electron diffraction patterns. (g) HRTEM image of the interface between graphene and prismoid-like copper nanoparticle. 
Furthermore, to reveal the growth mechanism of H-3DRG, the microstructures of coarse NPC substrate and the interface between NPC and carbon rivet were studied in depth. Interestingly, large numbers of prismoid-like copper nanoparticles with size less than 100 nm remain on the surface of the reconstructed NPC substrates due to the insufficient diffusion time (Fig. 2e and S3, ESI†). The prismoid-like copper nanoparticles are easily oxidized into Cu2O under air atmosphere after the shifting of NPC from the tubular furnace due to the high activity. However, the crystal orientation of Cu2O is the same as that of Cu. Therefore, the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and corresponding selected area electron diffraction patterns reveal the existence of (111) and (200) lattice planes of Cu2O clearly, and the (111) plane of copper nanoparticle is parallel to the platform of prismoid (Fig. 2f). Carbon rivets were prepared with the CVD approach, and the interface between carbon rivet and Cu2O nanoparticle is clearly shown in Fig. 2g. The graphite layers and (111) lattice plane of Cu2O are parallel to the interface, indicating that the carbon rivets were catalyzed by the (111) planes on the platform of Cu2O nanoparticles (the oxidation of Cu nanoparticles under air atmosphere) and display a gradient structure. A schematic illustration and description of the formation process of 3DRG is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
For comparison, the as-prepared NPC substrate was annealed at 900 °C for 3 min under a mixed atmosphere of Ar and H2 to fabricate a bulky microporous copper with smooth surface (Fig. S5a, ESI†). Then, an H-3DG film (Fig. S5b, ESI†) without carbon nanorivets (inset in Fig. S5b, ESI†) was grown onto the surface of the microporous copper substrate at 900 °C under a mixed atmosphere of C2H2, NH3, Ar and H2 for 3 min. Clearly, the H-3DG films kept the free-standing structure in water after the removal of the Cu substrate and further modification with HNO3 (Fig. S5c, ESI†). However, the H-3DG film was broken and crimped after the traditional heat-dry process (inset in Fig. S5c, ESI†), indicating that the carbon nanorivets can improve the mechanical strength of 3D graphene dramatically.
Moreover, heteroatom (such as nitrogen and oxygen) dopants were introduced into 3DRG due to the presence of NH3 during the growth process and further treatment by HNO3. The Raman spectrum of H-3DRG film shows a high ID/IG ratio of 1.025 demonstrating that there are abundant of defects on the surface of H-3DRG film caused by the existence of edges and heteroatom dopants (Fig. S6a, ESI†). The BET and BJH analyses show that H-3DRG film has a specific surface area of 405 m2 g−1, which is favorable for the deposition of active materials, and the pore size of 30 nm is attributed to the spaces among the carbon rivets (Fig. S6b and c, ESI†). XPS shows that the elements contained in H-3DRG are C, N and O with concentration of 88.77 at%, 2.98 at% and 8.25 at%, respectively (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The N element is mainly present in four forms according to N 1s XPS spectrum: pyridine, pyrrole, graphitic and oxidized structures (Fig. S7b, ESI†). Furthermore, the scanning TEM (STEM) elemental mapping demonstrates that nitrogen and oxygen elements are homogenously dispersed in the H-3DRG film (Fig. S8a, ESI†). The contact angle for water on H-3DRG film decreases from 80.5° (Fig. S8b, ESI†) to 0° (Fig. S8c, ESI†) within 30 s, indicating that the H-3DRG film is quite hydrophilic due to the existence of edges and hydrophilic groups on the surface of 3D graphene caused by the existence of carbon rivets and heteroatom dopants, which is crucial for the robust growth of electroactive materials on the surface of H-3DRG substrate.10


Fabrication and characterization of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids. 
The as-prepared H-3DRG films were used as substrates to grow NiCo-LDH via a hydrothermal approach. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to characterize the crystallographic structure and phase purity of the obtained 3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid films (Fig. S9a, ESI†). The results show that all the diffraction peaks of the obtained H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids are indexed to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018) and (110) planes which are assigned to a LDH phase.42–44 Furthermore, the peak observed at ∼27° reveals the existence of H-3DRG substrate, which is also proved by Raman spectra.24 The peaks at 502 and 651 cm−1 of Raman spectra further indicate the fabrication of NiCo-LDH (Fig. S6a, ESI†).43 XPS was used to determine the chemical composition and the surface electronic state of the obtained H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids (Fig. S7a, ESI†). The Ni 2p XPS spectrum demonstrates that element Ni exists in the forms of Ni3+ and Ni2+ (Fig. S9b, ESI†), and the Co element also displays two forms of Co3+ and Co2+ (Fig. S9c, ESI†).45,46 Moreover, the higher binding energy of N peaks for H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids compared with those for pristine H-3DRG reveals the existence of strong electronic interactions between H-3DRG substrate and NiCo-LDH (Fig. S7b, ESI†).47,48
In addition, the hydrophilic and edge-enriched characteristics mean easy adsorption of metal ions onto the surface of H-3DRG film which results in large amounts of vertically oriented NiCo-LDH uniformly grown onto the inner and outer sides of H-3DRG substrate under hydrothermal conditions for 15 h (Fig. 3a and S10a and b, ESI†). High-resolution SEM and TEM images further reveal that the NiCo-LDH shows vertically oriented nanoneedle architecture with a diameter of 10–20 nm and length of ∼1 μm (Fig. 3b and c). The HRTEM image indicated that there are a large amount of mesopores on the surface of NiCo-LDH nanoneedles which means the hybrids have more active sites to improve the electrochemical performances (Fig. 3d, yellow arrows).49 Visible lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.23 nm, indexed to the (012) plane of the NiCo-LDH phase, can be seen from the HRTEM image (Fig. 3d). In addition, the STEM image of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids and the corresponding elemental mapping further reveal the uniform distribution of NiCo-LDH on the surface of H-3DRG films (Fig. 3e). For comparison, the SEM images of pristine NiCo-LDH obtained by free nucleation without H-3DRG substrate are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), which has a sphere-like aggregated structure composed of compact nanoneedles.

Fabrication and characterization of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids. 
The as-prepared H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids were in situ transformed into H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 by a second hydrothermal process (Fig. 1c). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, large amounts of nanorod-like products are uniformly located on both sides of the H-3DRG substrate, which still preserve the general array morphology of the NiCo-LDH precursors, but take on a different morphology at the nanoscale due to the reactions with Na2S under hydrothermal condition (Fig. S10c and, ESI†). The XRD spectrum of the as-made sample after anion-exchanging is completely different from that of NiCo-LDH. Moreover, the existence of a peak located at 280 cm−1 in Raman spectra further demonstrates that NiCo-LDH was transformed into NiCo2S4 structure (Fig. S6a and S9a, ESI†). Furthermore, the diffraction angle that indicates the presence of H-3DRG in H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 is slightly different compared with the case in H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH, revealing that the chemical character of H-3DRG was changed. XPS spectra demonstrate that nickel cobalt sulfide is formed as NiCo2S4 (Fig. S7a, S9b, c and d, ESI†), in agreement with the above Raman and XRD results.50,51 In addition, the N 1s XPS spectrum of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid shows that the peak intensities of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and oxidic N are decreased obviously compared with those of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid, which indicated that large amounts of nitrogen atoms at the active sites were replaced by sulfur during the anion exchange process (Fig. S7b, ESI†). The high binding energy of N peaks of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 matched with H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and partially sulfur-doped H-3DRG can improve the stability of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 more effectively.

(c, d) TEM images of NiCo2S4 hierarchical nanorods with different magnifications. (e) STEM image and corresponding elemental mapping images of C, N, O, S, Ni and Co. 
The low-resolution TEM image indicates that the NiCo2S4 products display hierarchical architecture which consists of many nanosheets attached onto the surface of nanorod-like backbones (Fig. 4c). The HRTEM image further reveals that the hierarchical NiCo2S4 products are polycrystalline in nature which show highly crystalline lattice fringes with different orientations.52 Furthermore, nanosheets with thickness of about 6 nm in the hierarchical products were also observed (Fig. 4d, yellow region). In addition, the STEM image of the hierarchical product and the elemental mapping images further demonstrate that NiCo-LDH is transformed into NiCo2S4 structure completely and uniformly deposited on the surface of H-3DRG substrate. Moreover, the nanosheet- and nanorod-like architectures are both NiCo2S4 (Fig. 4e). In addition, The O species are mainly attributed to the oxygen-containing functional groups in H-3DRG film, which is consistent with the elemental mapping data of H-3DRG (Fig. 2e). Similar to the pristine NiCo-LDH sample, the pristine NiCo2S4 product without H-3DRG substrate maintains the original sphere-like aggregated structure (Fig. S12, ESI†).
Based on the above discussions, the robust and free-standing H-3DRG films show high-quality edge-enriched structure and abundant heteroatom doping to strongly couple and be easily filled with the vertically oriented NiCo-LDH, which can decrease the resistance, increase the stability and fully improve the electrochemical performances of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids. Moreover, the easy fabrication of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 without loss of the above advantages will further enhance the rate capability and stability considerably as electrode materials of energy storage and conversion devices, such as supercapacitors, and in OER.

3.2 Electrochemical performances of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids
The electrochemical properties of the obtained samples were investigated in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte using a three-electrode cell with Pt counter electrode and Hg/HgO reference electrode. Clearly, the total specific mass of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids is increased with the extending of hydrothermal time from 0.8 mg cm−2 at 5 h to 1.3, 2.2 and 2.6 mg cm−2 at 10, 15 and 20 h, respectively (Fig. S13†). Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of H-3DRG for different NiCo-LDH loading times at a constant scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Clearly, the CV curves have similar shapes and a pair of well-defined redox peaks, which reveal that NiCo-LDH shows a Faradaic battery-type mechanism.42,53 These intense peaks are attributed to the reversible Faradaic redox process related to M(OH)2/MOOH (M represents Co or Ni) according to the following reactions: Ni(OH)2 + OH− ⇆ NiOOH + H2O + e−(6) Co(OH)2 + OH− ⇆ CoOOH + H2O + e−(7) CoOOH + OH− ⇆ CoO2 + H2O + e−(8)

(a) CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-xh hybrids at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. (b) The gravimetric and areal specific capacities of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids at a current density of 1 A g−1. (c) CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h hybrid electrodes at various scan rates of 5–50 mV s−1. (d) The specific capacity of the pristine NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid electrodes at different current densities. (e) CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid electrodes at various scan rates of 5–50 mV s−1. (f) The specific capacity of the pristine NiCo2S4 and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid electrodes at different current densities. 
The specific capacity is increased from 97.7 to 225 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with the loading time extending from 5 to 15 h, because there are much more electrochemical active materials grown onto the surface of H-3DRG backbone (Fig. 5b). Then, the specific capacity is decreased to 154.5 mA h g−1 at a loading time of 20 h because the excessive hydrothermal time will reunite the electrochemical active materials to decrease the specific surface area and the gravimetric specific capacity.54 Furthermore, the trends of areal and volumetric capacity of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid electrodes with loading time are similar to that of the gravimetric capacity, and thus the maximum areal and volumetric capacities are achieved at 15 h, which are 0.48 mA h cm−2 and 68.6 mA h cm−3, respectively (Fig. 5b).
The CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h hybrids at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 5c. The CV curves keep a pair of intense redox peaks, even at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, representing a typical battery-type electrochemical behavior of the LDH electrodes.55 The larger area of CV curve and more intense redox peaks of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid film compared with pristine NiCo-LDH electrode at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 indicate that the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid displays a much higher specific capacity and faster redox reaction kinetic processes due to the absence of polymer binder and strong connection between H-3DRG and NiCo-LDH (Fig. S14a†). The symmetric galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid film demonstrate the highly reversible faradic redox reactions between the hybrid electrode and electrolyte which result in a high coulombic efficiency (Fig. S14b†). The highly conductive H-3DRG backbone acts as an excellent transport channel for electrons and ions. Moreover, the vertically oriented NiCo-LDH nanoneedles can synergistically reduce the charge transfer resistance. The above outstanding structural characteristics make the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid film exhibit a high specific capacity of 227 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability of 175 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1, which are much higher than those of the pristine NiCo-LDH electrode at the same conditions (Fig. 5d). In addition, the high many-cycle stability shown in Fig. S14f† reveals that H-3DRG is well attached with NiCo-LDH nanoneedles and acts as a bicontinuous conductive network to accelerate ion/electron transport and increase the conductivity of hybrid electrodes.
Binary metal sulfides show great promise as an electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices whose electrical conductivity and stability are higher than those of LDH. Herein, the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid films obtained by a hydrothermal approach for 15 h were transformed into H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 by anion-exchange process. Fig. 5e shows the CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode at various scan rates ranging from 5 to 50 mV s−1. The better-defined redox peaks, lower voltage delay and resistance (Fig. S14c†) compared with H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h indicate a significantly improved conductivity and redox reaction kinetics processes. These intense peaks are attributed to the reversible redox process related to Co2+/Co3+/Co4+ and Ni2+/Ni3+ according to the following reactions:56–62 CoS + OH− ⇆ CoSOH + e−(9) NiS + OH− ⇆ NiSOH + e−(10) CoSOH + OH− ⇆ CoSO + H2O + e−(11)
The charge storage mechanism of the electrode materials was determined by the following formula:13 ip = avb(12)where ip is the peak current intensity (A g−1) and v is the scan rate (mV s−1). Generally, a value of b = 1 reveals that the electrode materials display a surface-controlled behavior, whereas b = 0.5 reveals a diffusion-controlled behavior. Determined from the slopes of the j versus v curve, the b values of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrodes are 0.85 and 0.66, respectively (Fig. S15†). This means that the surface of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH contributes more capacities than H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrodes.
Similar to the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h hybrid electrode, the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode displays symmetric GCD curves (Fig. S14d†). The H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode also shows higher specific capacity (217.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), rate capability (85% retention at 50 A g−1) and many-cycle stability (90% retention after 10000 cycles) compared with pristine NiCo2S4 electrode due to the free-standing structure and the interconnected electrons/ions transport channels (Fig. 5f, S14e and f†). In addition, although the specific capacity of the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode slightly decreases compared with that of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH-15h electrode, the lower internal resistance (Fig. S14c†) and better many-cycle stability (Fig. S14f†) of the former combined with high binding energy of N peaks (Fig. S7b†) and distinct XRD patterns (Fig. S9a†) reveal that NiCo-LDH was completely converted into NiCo2S4 after the second hydrothermal treatment and did not break the strong coupling interaction between NiCo2S4 and the H-3DRG backbone.
3.3 Electrochemical performances of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG asymmetric supercapacitors
ASCs with high energy density without sacrificing the power density are highly desirable for practical applications. Currently, carbon nanomaterials, especially active carbon (AC), are usually used as the negative electrode for ASCs.42 However, the relatively low specific capacitance and powder-like structure limit the electrochemical performance of entire ASCs devices. Heteroatom-doped free-standing 3D graphene films are ideal candidates for the negative electrodes of ASCs due to their large effective surface area, high wettability with electrolyte and high conductivity which can offer a high specific capacitance and long life-time.35
Hence, we constructed two kinds of ASCs: H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 were each used as the positive electrodes, and flexible nitrogen and oxygen co-doped 3D nanoporous graphene (NO-3DnpG) films (which are described in Fig. S16†) with high specific area of 1100 m2 g−1 (Fig. S17†) were used as the negative electrode. The mass ratio of the positive and negative electrode materials was balanced before making the full cell devices according to their individual electrochemical behaviors. The voltage of the ASCs was determined to be 1.6 V (Fig. S18a†). Evidently, the redox peaks of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 shift to a more positive potential, which indicates that NiCo2S4 needs a higher voltage to form NiSOH and CoSOH. Moreover, the redox reaction between CoSOH and CoSO is located at a much higher potential. Differently, the redox peaks of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH are at relatively low potentials.63–65 Therefore, the CV curves of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs show obvious shape changes (Fig. 6a and b). The CV curves with no obvious shape changes at scan rates from 5 to 50 mV s−1 indicate that the two ASCs both possess excellent electrochemical behavior. The nearly symmetric GCD curves of both ASCs demonstrate a high coulombic efficiency (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the lower internal resistance of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASC shown in EIS analysis demonstrates that the binary metal sulfides offer higher electrochemical activity and conductivity (Fig. S18b†).66–69

(e) Ragone plots of the as-fabricated H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG and previously reported ASCs. (f) Cycling performances of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs at a current density of 10 A g−1. 
The calculated specific capacities from GCD curves at different current densities based on the total mass of positive and negative electrodes are shown in Fig. 6d. The H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG ASCs show a higher specific capacity of 49.56 mA h g−1 than H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs (47.1 mA h g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, but the rate capability is lower than the latter limited by the relatively low conductivity of LDH, which remains at 34.7 mA h g−1 at a currant density of 20 A g−1 compared with that of H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs (36.5 mA h g−1). Although many works report excellent electrochemical performances based on the active materials, the large weight of current collectors will affect the entire performance of a device, such as Ni foam, graphite paper or carbon cloth. Therefore, a more comprehensive comparison of the device power and energy densities was conducted according to the area load amount of active materials and area density of current collectors listed in the literature, and summarized in Ragone plots in Fig. 6e. The H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs both have high energy density (the maximum values are 39.4 W h kg−1 and 37.6 W h kg−1, respectively) and power density (the maximum values are 10.8 kW kg−1 and 27.7 kW kg−1, respectively), which are comparable with the values reported in the literature, such as Ni–Co–S/G//PCNS,3 Ni(OH)2//AC,70 NiCo2S4/NCF//OMC/NCF,71 NiCo2S4@PPy-50//AC,72 NiCo2S4/CFP//AC73 and NiCo-LDH-NPs/CH-NWs//AC.15 More importantly, both kinds of ASCs display excellent cycling stability. H-3DRG@NiCo2S4//NO-3DnpG ASCs can retain 85% of the initial specific capacity after 10000 cycles, and the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH//NO-3DnpG ASCs show 80% retention after 10000 cycles (Fig. 6f).
3.4 OER catalytic activities of H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids
The OER catalytic performances of the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrids were evaluated as working electrodes without any further treatment in 1.0 M KOH solution. For comparison, free-standing H-3DRG film, and the pristine NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 catalysts on glassy carbon electrode were tested under identical conditions. Then, the OER activity was measured by liner sweep voltammetry (LSV).
Herein, we used the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slope (logj–η) to estimate the OER performance of the electrocatalysts. Fig. 7a shows the LSV curves for the samples mentioned above at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Clearly, the H-3DRG backbone has no measurable contribution to the measured signal. In contrast, the other samples all show a high performance toward OER. Particularly, the free-standing H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 and H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrids display low overpotentials of 264 and 289 mV versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much lower than those of the corresponding pristine NiCo2S4 (314 mV) and NiCo-LDH (388 mV) samples because the in situ uniform self-growth of the active nanomaterial arrays onto the surface of H-3DRG films with good separation and the absence of any binder will increase the kinetics of ion and electron transport between the catalysts and substrate.74 In addition, clear oxidation peaks are observed near 1.3 V prior to the onset of the oxygen evolution process, which could be assigned to the oxidation of NiII/NiIII/NiIV.75 Moreover, H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 exhibits the lowest overpotential for OER activity for two reasons: (a) the higher conductivity of sulfide than LDH results in a low charge transfer resistance and efficient electron paths and (b) NiCo2S4 displays hierarchical architecture consisting of many nanosheets attached onto the surface of nanorod-like backbones. The specific surface area of NiCo2S4 (82.4 m2 g−1) is much larger than that of NiCo-LDH (29.4 m2 g−1) (Fig. S19a, ESI†). Furthermore, hierarchical NiCo2S4 provides much more mesopores to improve the electrochemical surface area and surface roughness according to the pore distribution data (Fig. S19b, ESI†).

(c) Chronopotentiometry curves of NiCo-LDH, NiCo2S4, H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 catalysts at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. 
The Tafel plots obtained for the above samples are shown in Fig. 7b. The H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid electrode exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 80.3 mV dec−1, while the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid electrode shows a slightly higher Tafel slope of 93.5 mV dec−1 compared with the former but much lower than those of the pristine NiCo2S4 and NiCo-LDH electrodes, consistent with the LSV results. Another important concern is the long-term electrochemical stability of the electrodes for water oxidation. As shown in Fig. 7c, the stabilities of as-obtained catalyst electrodes for OER were tested in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm−2 for 20 h. Noticeably, over the duration of 20 h electrolysis, the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid shows the best many-cycle stability, followed by the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH hybrid. The morphology of the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode after long-term OER electrolysis is shown in Fig. S20.† Although the NiCo2S4 nanosheets attached onto the surface of the nanorod backbones became fluffy, the NiCo2S4 still shows the initial hybrid structures (Fig. S20a and b†). Moreover, the elemental mapping reveals that the elements of Ni, Co and S were uniformly distributed through the entire hybrids (Fig. S20c†), further indicating the stability of the H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 electrode. Such stabilities mainly correlate with the vertically aligned nature of the NiCo2S4 and NiCo-LDH nanostructures as well as the strong interconnection between the active nanowires and H-3DRG substrate which enhance the reusability of the catalyst electrodes.76–78 On the contrary, the pristine NiCo2S4 and NiCo-LDH electrodes lose their OER activity dramatically within 5 and 3 h, respectively.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a free-standing high-quality H-3DRG film with edge-enriched structure was obtained by the CVD approach using NPC as the substrate and catalyst. The existence of gradient carbon nanorivets improves the mechanical strength of 3D graphene layer and provides much more nucleation sites for electroactive inorganics, which make the H-3DRG film an ideal substrate for the deposition of electrochemical active materials, such as NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4. Furthermore, vertically orientated NiCo-LDH and NiCo2S4 were strongly anchored onto the inner and outer side of hydrophilic H-3DRG film due to the abundant heteroatom dopants. Such outstanding structural advantages can accelerate the reaction kinetics and enhance electrochemical activities which mean that the H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH- and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4-based ASC devices both show high energy densities of 78.8 W h kg−1 and 75.1 W h kg−1 based on the entire devices, respectively. Moreover, the binder-free self-assembled H-3DRG@NiCo-LDH and H-3DRG@NiCo2S4 hybrid films also favor the OER process, which deliver a mass oxygen production current density of 10 mA cm−2 at low overpotentials of 289 mV and 264 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively. The excellent electrochemical activity and superior stability of our composite electrodes corroborate the H-3DRG film as a promising candidate substrate for the deposition of electrochemical active materials to expand the range of applications.
