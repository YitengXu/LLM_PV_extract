    , Accepted 9th March 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractWe report here hybrid n-type Ta-doped SnO2 (Sn1−xTaxO2) nanowalls (as an electron-rich donor) bonded with graphene-like layers (Sn1−xTaxO2/C) as high performance electrocatalysts for flexible energy conversion devices. SnO2 possesses high electron mobility (125–250 cm2 V−1 S−1), and Ta doping is adopted to increase the electron concentration to further improve the conductivity of the SnO2 film to allow its use as a catalyst support. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the increased electrical conductance is mainly attributed to the increased intrinsic doping effect caused by the substitution of Sn by Ta. The Ta-doped SnO2 not only acts a well conductive support for the close coated graphene-like carbon layers but also pushes electrons to the carbon electrocatalyst to enhance its catalytic performance. Advanced features of these nanowall films include not only a high specific surface area, and good adhesion to substrates, but also flexibility. One application as a counter electrode in fully flexible dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) shows that the optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fully flexible DSSCs is 8.38% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is one of the highest PCEs for fully flexible DSSCs.
Introduction
Electrocatalysts for the oxidation–reduction reaction are crucial in fuel cells,1–3 water splitting,4–6 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),7–9 and other electrochemical devices. Platinum (Pt) is the most common choice for these electrocatalytic reactions due to its high conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, and chemical stability, but its scarcity and high cost limit its large-scale utilization. Replacing Pt catalysts with cheap and commercially available materials is a key issue in the development of renewable-energy technologies. Recently, intense efforts have been made to explore alternative materials to replace Pt materials, such as carbon materials,10–12 polymers,13,14 transition metal compounds and other hybrid materials.15,16 Among these materials, carbonaceous materials are the most promising substitute due to their wonderful conductivity, excellent catalytic activity, and low cost.
However, carbon materials often suffer from poor adhesion to the substrate, which will result in detachment of carbon from the substrate, leading to disadvantageous effects on device performance and long-term stability.11,17 For this reason, formation of a high quality carbon film on the substrate is crucial. To overcome this disadvantage, some studies were attempted to add TiO2 or SnO2 to improve this bonding strength.18,19 However, it was found that adding too much TiO2 can weaken the catalytic activity of the carbon counter electrode due to the low conductivity of TiO2.20 The general reaction mechanism of the triiodide reduction can be written as: I−3(sol) ↔ I2(sol) + I−(sol) fast(1) I2(sol) + 2* → 2I* fast(2) I* + e− → I−(sol) slow(3)where * represents the free site on the catalyst surface and sol indicates the electrolyte solution. Steps (1) and (2) have been verified to be usually fast and step (3) is relatively slow to play as the rate-determining step.21,22 So the ability to provide electrons has been considered to be a key factor for the catalytic activity. Furthermore, to enhance PCE, the thicknesses of these types of carbon counter electrodes need to be above ten micrometers. Such a thick carbon counter electrode increases the device internal resistance and thus hinders device performance by reducing the fill factor.23 Additionally, flexible devices are required to have high flexibility with good shape bending for daily use or transportation, therefore the adhesion problem will be more serious. Table 1 shows the reported high values of PCE obtained for fully flexible DSSCs based on TiO2 photoanodes and various counter electrodes. There is still much room for improvement of the performance of fully flexible DSSCs that can be achieved by developing effective methods.

Our work




Here, we designed new hybrid catalysts with the Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructure with attachment of graphene-like carbon layers onto Sn1−xTaxO2 nanowalls. Nanowall arrays of Sn1−xTaxO2 were grown on Ti foil, and the Ta doping can increase the electronic conductivity of the film, making it a good support for carbon catalyst materials. These nanowall films also have a high specific surface area, good adhesion to substrates, and flexibility. First principles calculations reveal that Ta-doping not only increases the electronic conductivity of SnO2 but also reduces the work function of SnO2 remarkably, which makes the electron transfer from SnO2 to graphene oxide easy. All these factors make this new Sn1−xTaxO2/C system exhibit good stability and electrocatalytic activity for electrochemical reduction. One example for its applications is: when used as a counter electrode in flexible DSSCs, the optimal PCE of DSSCs is 8.38% under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is close to that of control DSSCs with a platinized counter electrode prepared by pyrolysis (8.46%).
Experimental methods
Materials
SnCl4·5H2O (98%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), TaCl5 (99.8%, Alfa), glucose (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%, GC, Alfa), LiI (AR, Acros), I2 (AR, Acros) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, AR, Aldrich) were commercially available and used without further purification. 3-Hexyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide (HMII) was prepared according to the literature.38
Synthesis of Sn1−xTaxO2 nanowalls and the carbon coating process
Before growing SnO2, a Ti foil (0.1 mm thickness) was subjected to treatment in 0.5 M hydrofluoric acid aqueous solution for 2 min and subsequently ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water and acetone, respectively.
The SnO2 nanowalls were fabricated directly onto Ti foil by dipping into a deposition solution containing 0.3 M SnCl4·5H2O and 0.8 M thioacetamide in a mixture of ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (v/v = 1/3) in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. The solution was heated to 75 °C in a water bath for 3 h. Then, the substrates were removed and washed with water and ethanol, dried and calcined in air at 500 °C for 1 h. For preparing the Ta-doped samples, TaCl5 was added to ethanol (molar ratios of Ta and Sn were 2.5:100, 5:100, 7.5:100, and 10:100) to start the reaction. The obtained samples were denoted as Sn0.975Ta0.025O2, Sn0.95Ta0.05O2, Sn0.925Ta0.075O2, and Sn0.9Ta0.1O2, respectively.
The carbon coating process was realized in two steps. First, the as-prepared Sn1−xTaxO2 nanowalls were loaded into a sealed Teflon reactor containing 16 g glucose and 120 mL distilled water. A reaction temperature of 180 °C for 4 h was used. After the reaction was completed, the carbon-coated samples were carefully washed with ethanol and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 4 h. Then, carbonization was achieved in a tube furnace by calcining at 500 °C for 2 h in an Ar/H2 (v/v = 95/5) atmosphere.
Characterization
The morphology of the nanowall films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) at an operating voltage of 10.0 kV. The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by using a D/MAX-2500 diffractometer (Rigaku Co.) with Cu Kα radiation (k = 0.15406 nm) operated at 40 kV and 150 mA. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed with a Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was carried out using a VG Scientific Escalab 220i-XL spectrometer with standard Al KR radiation, and the working pressure is <3 × 10−9 mbar. The specific surface area was analyzed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020 HD88). The structure of the carbon layer in the hybrid was identified by Raman spectroscopy (iHR 320, Horiba Jobin Yvon, 532.1 nm Laser).
Synthesis of the TiO2 photoanode and cell fabrication for flexible DSSCs
TiO2 photoanodes were prepared according to the literature.39,40 TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa) were subjected to pre-sintering at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the contaminants on the surface. 0.6 g P25 was dispersed in a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and n-butanol (v/v = 1:1) by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 h. After 12 h magnetic stirring, the suspension formed a uniform TiO2 colloid (15–20 wt%), and 180 μL SITO-sol (Sb, In-doped SnO2 sol) was added into the P25 colloid to form a modified TiO2 paste.40
Before film coating, a very thin TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the well cleaned ITO/PEN substrates from tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBT) through spin-coating followed by hydrolysis in distilled water at 100 °C. The TiO2 paste was coated on the substrates by the doctor-blade technique. A 4–5 μm thick second layer of 300–500 nm sized light scattering rutile particles (the paste containing a certain amount of SITO-sol) was deposited using a doctor blade onto the first layer. The dried films were exposed to UV irradiation (300 W) for 30 min, followed by immersion in 100 °C distilled water for 30 min. The digital photograph of the as-prepared working electrode is shown in Fig. S1.† All films were dried in a 100 °C oven for 1 h before being sensitized in a 0.5 mM N3 dye/ethanol solution overnight for dye adsorption. The electrolyte was a mixture of LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), TBP (0.6 M) and HMII (0.6 M) in MPN. The reference counter electrode was Pt-coated FTO.
Electrochemical tests
The photocurrent density–voltage (j–V) measurement was performed using a Keithley 2611 Source Meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.). The light source was an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co.). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in an N2-purged acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 by using a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system. Platinum wire served as a counter electrode and the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode. Tafel polarization curves were measured with a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system in a dummy cell with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, using a perturbation of ±10 mV over the open-circuit potential by using a Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system. The specific resistivity was measured using a four-probe technique (KDY-1, Kunde Technology).
Computational details
In order to model the SnO2 doped by Ta, a 3 × 3 × 2 supercell based on the unit cell was constructed, allowing us to investigate different substitution degrees of Sn1−xTaxO2, with x ranging from x = 0 to 0.125 in steps of Δx = 0.025, as shown in Fig. S2.† The k-point mesh is set to 3 × 3 × 4. The k-point mesh is set to 5 × 5 × 8 to calculate the electronic properties. And we use six layers of SnO2 to simulate the SnO2 surface and build a supercell with graphene adsorbed on the SnO2 surface. SnO2 in the (110) orientation is chosen because it is observed in the experiment and is stable. To prevent spurious interactions between periodic images, a vacuum buffer space is set with the value of at least 15 Å. The x and y directions are fixed while the z direction can be relaxed during optimizing Sn1−xTaxO2/C. For optimizing graphene, graphene oxide and Sn1−xTaxO2, x, y and z directions can be relaxed. The Brillouin zone is sampled by 5 × 5 × 1 special k-points, using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.41 All calculations are performed using the plane-wave projector-augmented wave method42,43 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.44,45 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)46 form of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is chosen as the exchange-correlation potential. To obtain reliable optimized structures, the maximum residual force is less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and the energies are converged to within 5 × 10−6 eV per atom. An energy cut-off of 550 eV is used in all cases.
Because the absolute position of energy levels in a bulk calculation is ill-defined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, here we pick the deep core levels of a Sn atom (far from the doped Ta atom) to align the energy levels in different calculations.
Results and discussion
Design, preparation, and characterization of the Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructures
The design ideas of Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructures can be depicted as following: (1) compared with TiO2, SnO2 possesses much higher electron mobility (125–250 cm2 V−1 S−1 for SnO2vs. ∼1 cm2 V−1 S−1 for TiO2); (2) introducing n-type doping can increase the electron concentration to further improve the electronic conductivity; (3) as mentioned in the introduction part, carbonaceous materials are a promising substitute for Pt due to their excellent catalytic activity and low cost; (4) Sn1−xTaxO2 can serve as a good conductive support for such carbon electrocatalyst materials; (5) SnO2 nanowall structures not only have large surface areas but also facilitate the close carbon coating and its flexibility.

Fig. 1 presents the design and synthesis strategy of the hybrid Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructure. Ti foil was selected as the substrate material for the photocathode based on the following considerations: (1) it is a conductive material and can be replaced by Cu foil, stainless steel, or other materials; (2) it is a flexible material; and (3) it can be calcined at high temperatures. Hybrid structures were fabricated by coating Sn1−xTaxO2 nanowalls with carbon layers and the digital photographs of the prepared samples are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2(a)–(c) show the digital photographs of Ti foil, Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 grown on Ti foil and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C grown on Ti foil. Fig. 2(d) and (e) show field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) top-surface images of a typical as-synthesized carbon-coated nanowall array sample at both low and high magnification. A highly uniform array of nanowalls is obtained, with an average wall thickness of approximately 50–100 nm, and the spacing between the walls ranges from hundreds of nanometers to one micron. The inset of Fig. 2(d) is a cross-sectional view of the same film with a thickness of approximately 3.3 μm, indicating that the nanowalls adhere to the Ti substrate tightly without buffer layers and the walls are almost vertically aligned. Also, the nanowall film has a high surface-to-volume ratio that helps achieve more surface for carbon coating. The specific surface area calculated with the BET equation was 89.1 m2 g−1 for Sn0.925Ta0.075O2, and 119.7 m2 g−1 for Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 2(f) and (g) show the TEM images of the nanowall scratched from the Ti substrate. From Fig. 2(g), we can observe that the nanowalls are the aggregation of nanoparticles, which is confirmed by the electron diffraction pattern in the inset of Fig. 2(g). The TEM images in Fig. 2(g) and (h) indicate that the external surface of the nanowall was uniformly encapsulated with a 4–8 nm thick layer of carbon. Moreover, the HRTEM image in Fig. 2(h) shows the lattice structure of the nanowall in the sample. We can observe 0.335, 0.264, and 0.176 nm for the lattice spacing between (110), (101), and (211) planes, in good agreement with the strongest (110), (101), and (211) peaks in the above XRD measurements. From the HRTEM image of such a hybrid structure (Fig. 2(i)), we can see clearly the graphene-like carbon layers with several nanometer thickness. The Raman spectrum of the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C hybrid is shown in Fig. 2(j). There are two characteristic peaks at 1370 and 1596 cm−1, respectively, corresponding to the D band and G band of carbon (IG:ID = 1.7). The D-band illustrates the defects and disordered portions of carbon, while the G-band stands for the ordered graphitic crystallites of carbon.

Fig. 3(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the undoped SnO2, Sn0.925Ta0.075O2, and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C samples grown on the Ti substrate. Except for the peaks originating from the Ti substrate, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed to the standard SnO2 tetragonal rutile type phase, which is consistent with the values in the standard card (JCPDS card no. 88-0287).47,48 The crystallite size was estimated with the Scherrer equation. From the full width at half maximum of the strongest rutile diffraction (110), the crystallite size was calculated to be ca. 12 nm for SnO2 and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 samples. No diffraction peaks corresponding to carbon were observed in the XRD pattern of Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C, meaning that the carbon coating is amorphous.

To get clear information about Sn and Ta elements, samples without carbon coating were used here. (e) and (f) XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s for the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C sample. 
To analyze the elemental and chemical states of Sn and Ta in our samples, XPS measurements were employed. Fig. 3(b) shows the Sn 3d XPS spectra of the SnO2 and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 samples. The two peaks of the Sn 3d spectra of the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 show a slight negative shift compared with that of SnO2, which is likely attributed to the interaction between tin atoms, oxygen atoms, and tantalum atoms. Consistent with this result, the Ta 4f spectrum of Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 reveals a positive shift toward higher binding energy compared to those of SnO2 (Fig. 3(c)). This can be attributed to the variation in electronegativities of the Sn and Ta elements (Sn = 1.96, Ta = 1.5). These observations confirm the formation of the Sn–O–Ta structure in the Ta-doped SnO2, owing to the substitution of Sn by Ta. In the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 sample (Fig. 3(d)), the binding energy of the lattice oxygen is located at 530.71 eV, which is between 530.65 eV (Ta2O5) and 531.19 eV (SnO2), owing to the variation in electronegativities of the two metal elements.
As depicted in Fig. 3(e), Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C shows three distinctive C 1s binding energies, 284.8 eV for non-oxygenated C, 286.21 eV for carbon in C–O, and 289.2 eV for carboxylate carbon (O–CO), respectively.49–51 The percentage of oxidative carbon (C–O, CO) is 23.1%, confirming the existence of a mildly oxidative carbon overlayer.52 The O 1s spectra are decomposed using five different components: 533.23 eV for C–O, 533.88 eV for O–CO, 532.25 eV for –OH, 531.41 eV for CO, and 530.87 eV for Sn–O–Ta (Fig. 3(f)).
The resistivity measurements were conducted on the Sn1−xTaxO2 nanowall films to learn about the electrical conductivity. Fig. S4† shows the specific resistivity as a function of doping level for SnO2 nanowall films. The specific resistivity of the SnO2 nanowall film decreases significantly after the doping of Ta, and achieves the lowest level at the doping amount of 7.5 mol%. The high conductivity of the Ta-doped nanowall film guarantees its excellent performance for use as a catalyst support.
Electrochemical behavior of the Sn1−xTaxO2/C sample
As one example for the applications of Sn1−xTaxO2/C, its electrochemical properties were assessed in fully flexible DSSC devices. Fig. S5† shows the configuration of fully flexible DSSCs in this study. Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the photocurrent–voltage (j–V) curves of fully flexible DSSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters are displayed in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor of flexible DSSCs based on Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C CE are 16.53 mA cm−2, 705 mV and 0.72, respectively, yielding an overall energy-conversion efficiency of 8.38%, which is remarkably comparable to that of fully flexible DSSCs with Pt CE (8.46%). The fully flexible DSSCs based on bare SnO2 as the counter electrode showed a short circuit current density (jsc) of 8.13 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 435 mV, a fill factor (FF) of 0.40, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.40%. The lower values of photovoltaic parameters are attributed to the high Rct and Rs of SnO2 electrodes as studied by EIS. Compared with the bare SnO2 DSSCs, the SnO2/C DSSCs yield a dramatically improved PCE of 6.15%, which is due to the high catalytic activity of surface coated carbon. After Ta doping in SnO2/C, the photovoltaic performance is further enhanced. When 2.5 mol% Ta is doped into the electrode (Sn0.975Tax0.025O2/C), jsc increases from 14.17 to 15.79 mA cm−2. The optimal η reaches 8.38% at a Ta/Sn ratio of 7.5 mol% (Sn0.925Tax0.075O2/C). This can be partly attributed to the greatly improved electronic conductivity of SnO2 after Ta doping. Despite the fact that Voc only has a slight increase from 700 mV to 705 mV, η still obtains a certain degree of improvement owing to a substantial increase in the FF and jsc. If the percent of Ta is up to 10 mol%, photo-conversion efficiency begins to decline due to the decrease of FF and jsc. The long-term stability of fully flexible DSSCs assembled with Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C electrodes was evaluated. As shown in Fig. S7,† the efficiency of fully flexible DSSCs remains almost constant for 100 hours. This result indicates that the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C electrode based fully flexible DSSCs are a promising candidate for practical solar cells with good durability.

Cyclic voltammetry is a powerful tool to determine the catalytic activity of catalysts.53,54 The electro-catalytic activity of different counter electrodes was first evaluated by cyclic voltammetry for the triiodide/iodide under the same conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 4(b). Both curves exhibit two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks. The left and right pairs are assigned to eqn (4) and (5), respectively. Apparently, the left cathodic peaks are the focus of our analysis because the CE is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. I−3 + 2e− ↔ 3I−(4) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I−3(5)
The SnO2 based electrode exhibited the lowest response current density, in accordance with its poor PCE. After carbon coating, the SnO2/C electrode shows a greatly increased current density. Compared to the SnO2/C electrode, the current density was further increased (by 53%) when the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C electrodes were utilized as the working electrode, indicating that the triiodide reduction rate on the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C electrode is the highest. Especially, the redox peaks of Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C at low potentials exhibited a current density higher than that for Pt, indicating a better catalytic activity.
To provide electrochemical insight into the electrochemical activity of SnO2, SnO2/C, Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C, and Pt, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the charge transfer process in the DSSCs. The results are shown in the form of typical Nyquist plots, as illustrated in Fig. 4(c). The equivalent circuit model for fitting is described in the inset of Fig. 4(c) and the resultant parameters are summarized in Table 3, in which Rs is the series resistance and Rct is the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Rs and Rct values of SnO2 are 20.2 Ω and 8.2 Ω, respectively. In contrast to SnO2, smaller Rs and Rct of the SnO2/C can be observed, in which the Rs is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of SnO2/C, Ti foil, contact resistance and so on. Note that when compared to SnO2/C, the novel hybrid Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C nanostructure shows much lower Rs and Rct, which is close to those of the Pt electrode, indicating much higher conductivity and catalytic activity. Therefore, it can be revealed that the catalytic activity for I3− reduction would be significantly enhanced with the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C CE, which is in accordance with the CV results. To further characterize the properties of the counter electrodes, the electrical double-layer capacitance, which is related to the surface area, was obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots shown in Fig. 4(c). The chemical capacitances (Cm) of SnO2/C and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C are 2.10 and 2.36 mF, respectively, indicating a high surface area as compared to Pt which is advantageous for higher catalytic activity.

Tafel tests for Pt, SnO2, SnO2/C, and Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C CEs were performed to further confirm the catalytic activity. From the Tafel curves, we can obtain the exchange current density (j0) and the limiting diffusion current density (jlim), which are closely associated with the catalytic activity of the CEs. Fig. 4(d) shows the current density (j0) as a function of voltage (U) at 25 °C for the oxidation/reduction of triiodide to iodide. As shown in Fig. 4(d), SnO2 shows the smallest j0, indicating poor catalytic activity, in good agreement with the EIS and CV results. In contrast, the slope of the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C curve is slightly lower than that of Pt, indicating a roughly similar j0 in terms of the following equation. j0 = RT/nFRct(6)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday's constant and n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reduction of triiodide at the electrode. The jlim of Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C is higher than that of Pt, SnO2 and SnO2/C, indicating that Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C has a higher diffusion coefficient after doping and consequently a higher diffusion velocity for the redox couple in the electrolyte. Based on this systematic evaluation of electrocatalytic activity, it is clear that Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C demonstrates superior catalytic activity for I3− reduction and results in competitive photovoltaic performance. Sn0.925Ta0.075O2/C is expected to replace Pt as a potential CE catalyst in DSSCs.
Discussions about the high catalytic activity of Sn1−xTaxO2/C
First principles calculations are finally employed to understand the high catalytic activity of Sn1−xTaxO2/C. The effect of Sn atoms partially substituted by the Ta atoms was first studied by calculating the density of states (DOS) for bulk Sn1−xTaxO2. The calculated band gap of SnO2 is 2.13 eV, which is larger than that of the calculation result of 1.7 eV using the FP-LAPW method55 but is lower than that of the experimental value of 3.597 eV.56 It is well known that the GGA method underestimates the band gap, especially for the system with strong correlations or weak Coulomb screening. The band gap can be corrected to be 3.43 eV by using the HSE hybrid functional calculations (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 93765–93772), which is very close to the experimental value. However, both GGA and HSE results predict the same trend of variation for the band gap and the Fermi level shift under different doping concentrations. To keep the same method for the later calculations of SnO2/C systems, we all use the GGA method in this work due to the large cost to calculate the interface model by the HSE method.
We calculated the formation energies for the doping site of substituting a Sn atom and an interstitial site, respectively, and found that compared with Ta doping at an interstitial, Ta substituting a Sn atom will be energetically favorable. For each x value, we have considered at least four substitution structures and found out there is a little difference among them. Fig. S2† shows the doping model and the DOS for Sn1−xTaxO2 with different substitution degrees. Our calculations clearly revealed a gradual shift of the Fermi level toward the conduction band with Sn substituted by Ta. The Fermi level shift reaches up to 2.25 eV with the Ta doping content increasing from x = 0.0 to x = 0.075, and then nearly saturates (Fig. S2(c)†). By contrast, the band gap is nearly unchanged when the Sn atoms are substituted by the Ta atoms. The Fermi level shifts upward to the conduction band showing that there is an n-type doping effect when Sn is substituted by Ta for SnO2. From Fig. S2(b),† we can see that the Fermi level first locates at the valence band maximum for SnO2 and then locates very close to the conduction band minimum for Sn0.975Ta0.025O2, indicating that substitution of Sn sites by Ta introduces a shallow donor level. This is attributed to the fact that Ta atoms (5+) possess one more valence electron than Sn atoms (4+), which also accounts for the n-type doping effect. The n-type doping effect will increase the electron concentration and contribute to the electrical conductance, as suggested by our experimental results when Sn is substituted by Ta at a degree of x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1. In Fig. S4,† the electrical conductance first increased with the Ta content increasing from x = 0 to x = 0.075, and then decreased with the Ta content increasing from x = 0.075 to x = 0.1. When the Ta doping is under the level of x = 0.075, the increased electrical conductance is mainly attributed to the increased intrinsic doping effect caused by the substitution of Sn by Ta. The higher levels of Ta doping not improving the electrical conductivity can be attributed to three reasons: first, the Fermi level shift nearly saturates when the Ta doping level exceeds x = 0.075; second, the increasing Ta contents could introduce more impurity scattering centers, which will impede the electron transport and decrease the carrier mobility; third, it is possible that with the increasing Ta/Sn ratio, some of the Sn vacancies were formed to balance the valences of the sample's constituent elements, which will hinder the electron concentration from increasing. The increasing electronic conductance of Sn1−xTaxO2 will benefit the electron transport from the Sn0.925Ta0.075O2 support to carbon layers.
To further investigate the properties of Sn1−xTaxO2/C, the slab is built as shown in Fig. 5. We consider two high-symmetry initial configurations (Fig. 5(a) and (b)) of graphene on Sn1−xTaxO2 (110) surfaces. In general, a high-symmetry configuration is more stable than a low-symmetry one and often selected as the initial configuration. After optimization, the energy of the second configuration is lower, so we choose it for subsequent calculations. We calculate the SnO2/C and Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2/C systems to compare the effect of doping Ta and qualitatively analyze the effect using the result of doping Ta atoms to obtain the charge density difference. The equilibrium interfacial distance dO–C is defined as the difference between the average z-coordinates (vertical to the interface) of the C atoms and the topmost O atoms (Fig. 5(d)). The dO–C of SnO2/C and Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2/C systems is 2.96 Å and 3.18 Å, respectively, indicating that graphene is physically adsorbed on SnO2 and Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2. The difference of charge density between SnO2/C and Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2/C systems is shown in Fig. 5(e). It can be seen that after doping Ta atoms, the electron density of the upper surface of graphene is increased obviously, indicating that a big improvement in catalysis has been introduced by Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2/C than SnO2/C.

The work functions of graphene, graphene oxide, Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2, and SnO2 are calculated next, which are shown in Fig. 6. The work function of SnO2 decreases by 0.70 eV after doping Ta atoms, indicating that Ta doping can decrease the work function of SnO2. It is reasonable to assume that graphene is oxidized, because the C–O peak is observed in XPS spectra. We adopt the structure of graphene oxide from the result given by Li et al.57 C48O1, C48O2, C48O3, C48O5 and C48O7 are considered, and the optimized structures are consistent with Li et al.'s work.57 Obviously, the higher oxidation degree of graphene leads to higher work function. As shown in Fig. 6(a), we use a fitted linear model based on the work function of graphene oxide (C48O1, C48O2, C48O3, C48O5 and C48O7). The slope is 0.13, the intercept is 4.75, and the R2 = 0.983. The work function of C48O10.5 (O/C = 21.8%) will exceed that of Sn0.0975Ta0.0625O2 according to the fitted model. According to the experimental results, the ratio of O to C is larger than 20% (XPS data). So when the work function of graphene oxide exceeds that of Sn0.0975Ta0.0625O2, electrons will transfer from Sn0.0975Ta0.0625O2 to graphene oxide. Pushing more electrons from Sn0.0975Ta0.0625O2 to carbon layers will significantly improve the catalytic activity. According to the charge density difference and work function results, substitution of Sn atoms by Ta atoms will markedly reduce the work function of SnO2 which makes the electron transfer from SnO2 to graphene oxide easy. Increasing the number of electrons on carbon layers leads to a great improvement in catalytic activity.

The line is the fitted linear model based on the work function of graphene oxide. The slope is 0.13, the intercept is 4.75, and the R2 = 0.983. The work function of C48O10.5 will exceed that of Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2 according to the fitted model. (b) Structure of the slab of Sn0.9275Ta0.0625O2. 
Conclusion
Herein, a hybrid Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructure was fabricated which exhibits good stability and electrocatalytic activity for electrochemical reduction. As one example, flexible DSSCs based on this new type of counter electrode showed a comparable performance to those based on a Pt counter electrode. The high catalytic activity can be mainly attributed to the fact that the Ta doped SnO2 not only acts as a well conductive support for the close coated graphene-like carbon layers but also pushes electrons to the carbon electrocatalyst to enhance its catalytic activity. The as-developed hybrid Sn1−xTaxO2/C nanostructure is a highly promising material for use in flexible energy storage and conversion devices, and the design strategy described here could easily be extended to other transparent conductive oxides (e.g., doped-In2O3 and doped-ZnO) and catalytic materials.
