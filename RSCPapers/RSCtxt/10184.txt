    , Accepted 15th November 2021First published on 16th November 2021AbstractCharge transfer processes and space charge accumulation phenomena are fundamental topics concerning the technological applications of organic heterointerfaces. The possibility to achieve localized regions with enhanced charge density is, indeed, a powerful strategy to improve the performances of a vast plethora of electronic devices such as light emitting diodes, photodetectors and field-effect transistors. However, because of the complex structures of many organic compounds and the diversity of electronic interactions ruled by specific morphological features, the interfacial energy landscape of any combination of materials needs to be carefully investigated. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the surface potential landscape of P3HT/PDIF-CN2 donor/acceptor organic heterointerfaces. The electrical characterization, relying on the field-effect transistor configuration, outlined that the presence of a PDIF-CN2 overlayer induces a semiconductor-to-conductor transition in spin-coated P3HT OFETs. The mutual doping of the two organic materials was analyzed by Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) as a function of the PDIF-CN2 coverage and nominal thickness, with the results clearly pointing at the occurrence of charge transfer phenomena between the two materials. The related band bending at the interface leads to the formation of a hole rich area within the P3HT layer and an electron rich area within the PDIF-CN2 layer. The related thickness and charge density have been estimated as 15 nm and ≈1018 cm−3, respectively. Significantly, by tuning the PDIF-CN2 overlayer coverage, the P3HT work function can be tuned within 1 eV, opening an interesting perspective for the achievement of organic optoelectronic devices with improved functionalities.
1. Introduction
The alignment of energy bands in multi layered organic architectures1 is fundamental in determining the optoelectronic performances of organic light emitting diodes (OLED),2 the efficiency of organic solar cells (OPV) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJ),3,4 or in balancing the ambipolar response of Organic Field-Effect Transistors (OFET) for CMOS-like applications.5–7 Despite the great efforts put into the investigation of a multitude of organic systems, a comprehensive universal picture of the phenomena ruling the physics of organic/organic interfaces is far from being disclosed. The offsets between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of a donor species and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of an acceptor, in addition to the work function difference between two organic semiconductors, govern the mutual transfer of mobile charge carriers at the interface between an n-type and p-type organic semiconductor.8 The typical formation of an accumulation-type heterojunction, in contrast with the highly resistive depletion layer of the inorganic p–n counterpart, results in an overall shift of the vacuum level (VL) as high as 1 eV9,10 and the possible formation of a highly conductive space charge layer (SCL) across the organic interface: i.e. a hole rich area in the p-type and electron accumulation in the n-type material. Several examples have been reported in the literature during the last years. Early devices based on the archetypal system comprising bilayers of copper-phthalocyanine (p-type) and hexadecafluoro-copper-phthalocyanine (n-type) CuPc/F16CuPc were observed to have a normally-on mode of operation in OFET configuration.11 In this case, anomalous off-current and depressed gate modulation were ascribed to the band bending effect occurring at the interface. Transport measurements, corroborated by PES experiments,12 confirmed the formation of a highly conducting SCL with density exceeding 1017 cm−3 and confined within 40 nm from the organic/organic interface.13 On the other hand, within the large interest on fullerene-derived acceptor species, several works dealt with the band alignment and charge transport properties of C60/Pentacene heterointerfaces.14,15 Kyndiah et al.16 analyzed, for example, the correlation between the charge-transfer (CT) phenomena and threshold voltage values in ambipolar coplanar OFETs. Similar C60/pentacene bilayers have been more recently employed also as charge generation layers (CGL) for stacked emission layers in tandem OLED with improved power efficiency.17 Likewise, charge-separation at conductive CT interfaces appeared to be independent from the electrode material in Al/m-MTDATA/F16CuPc/Al–Ca multilayers,18 demonstrating the possibility to use CGL's also as all-organic buffer layers for the integration of low work-function anodes in light emitting devices.
In other cases, it has been found that the magnitude of the CT had driven crystalline organic system to exhibit even metallic properties. As demonstrated by Alves et al.,19 tetrathiofulvalene and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF/TCNQ) single crystal complexes showed band-like transport with ultra-low resistivity despite the single constituents being large-gap undoped organic semiconductors. The experimental results confirmed earlier indications found for analogous bulk CT salts firstly investigated in 1973,20 which paved the way to the possible technological breakthrough of organic conductors. More recently, 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene and N,N′-1H,1H-perfluorobutyl-1,6-dicyanoperylene-3,4:9,10 bis-(dicarboximide), or Rubrene/PDIF-CN2, stacked single crystal devices showed similar insulator-to-metal transition, elucidating the role of spatially confined electrons as highly mobile majority carrier in Schottky-gated vertical architectures.21 Despite the outstanding results and the consolidated use of PDIF-CN2 in reliable single layer electron-transporting organic devices,22–24 the investigation of CT phenomena for the PDIF-CN2 in organic thin film heterostructures has been limited so far. This study is aimed at giving a contribution in this direction by analyzing the prototypical p-type poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) polymer semiconductor (P3HT)25–27 and the n-type PDIF-CN2 as donor/acceptor pair. In this way, we extend also the previous analyses about CT phenomena occurring in different sequentially-evaporated dicyanoperylene-based bilayers.28,29
Here, we show a clear semiconductor-to-conductor transition in P3HT/PDIF-CN2 bilayers by investigating the related charge transport properties in equivalent OFET architectures. Surface potential landscape analysis via Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) was combined with the electrical characterization in order to quantitatively describe the vacuum level shift and interfacial band bending, particularly as function of the thickness of the PDIF-CN2 overlayer deposited on the P3HT substrate. Our final aim was to precisely discern charge density and spatial extension of the CT layer between these benchmark organic semiconductors.
2. Materials & methods
P3HT/PDIF-CN2 samples were fabricated starting from multi-layered substrates comprising a 200 nm thermal SiO2 dielectric layer, equipped with pre-patterned source/drain gold electrodes and grown onto a 500 μm Si++ substrate. The charge transport properties and the specific contribution of the field-effect response were so tested using this bottom-contact/bottom-gate configuration where Si++ acts as a distributed gate electrode. The related active channels were characterized by two different channel lengths (L = 20 and 40 μm), while the channel width was accordingly chosen in order to keep the W/L ratio fixed to 550. Prior to the deposition of the organic semiconductors, the dielectric SiO2 layer was treated with an Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) according to the procedure reported in ref. 24. The SiO2 treatment aims to limit the formation of trapping centers influencing the transport properties and to improve the overall morphological quality of the organic films.30–32
Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), regioregular with an average Mw of 20000–45000, purchased by Merck and used as such, was dissolved at concentration of 4 mg mL−1 in chloroform under magnetic stirring and filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE Whatman syringe. Then, the solution was spin coated onto the target substrate at a speed of 1000 rpm for 59 s by using a Laurell WS-650Mz-23NPP spin processor. Typical 26–30 nm thick P3HT films were so retrieved. The obtained polymer films were lastly annealed in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 1 hour.
The PDIF-CN2 (Flexterra™ N1100) was purchased in the form of powder and used without further purification. The related films (with thickness ranging from 5 to 45 nm) were evaporated onto the spun P3HT layers via Organic Molecular Beam Deposition (OMBD) technique. The deposition rate was set at R = 0.3 nm min−1 with a chamber pressure of P = 3 × 10−7 mbar. In order to enhance the PDIF-CN2 crystalline order, substrates were kept at Tsub = 110 °C during the deposition procedure.
The final P3HT/PDIF-CN2 heterostructures were electrically characterized in vacuum using a four-probe ST-500 Cryogenic Janis probe station via a Keithley 4200-SCS Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. Non-Contact Atomic Force Microscopy (NC-AFM) and Amplitude-Modulation Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (AM-SKPFM) measurements were carried out in air, using an XE-100 Park atomic force microscope, equipped with respectively PPP-NCHR by NanoSensors and NSC14 Cr/Au-coated conductive cantilevers by MikroMasch™. Conductive SKPFM probes have typical mechanical resonances of 170 kHz. SKPFM measurements were performed in dual frequency mode: i.e. acquiring both the height and the potential profile of the scanned surface at the same time. The potential signal is simultaneously demodulated by means of an external Stanford Research System SR830 DSP Lock-in amplifier, using a sinusoidal reference with a frequency of 18 kHz and a Vac amplitude between 1.8 V and 1.9 V. It should be remembered that, in the last years, SKPFM provided a versatile method to quantitatively investigate a vast gamut of physical systems such as organic heterostructures,33 inorganic or epitaxial correlated perovskite systems,34,35 graphene and TMD-based devices,36–38 or for a reliable and direct determination of contact resistances affecting the response of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).39–42
3. Results and discussion
Electrical, morphological and optical properties of P3HT/PDIF-CN2 heterostructures
AFM images in Fig. 1 describe clearly the morphological evolution of the PDIF-CN2 films overgrown on the P3HT substrates kept at 110 °C pointing at the occurrence of two distinct stages as a function of the nominal overlayer thickness (t). Starting from the AFM topography of Fig. 1(a) (t = 5 nm), the PDIF-CN2 film exhibited the almost complete lack of morphological structuring in comparison with analogous samples deposited on bare SiO2 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). This effect should be mainly ascribed to the action of the initially impinging PDF-CN2 molecules which can be thought as sufficiently mobile to vertically diffuse and form a disordered buffer layer of few nanometers.43 This phenomenon resembles the case of F4-TCNQ-doped P3HT layers,44,45 being also related to the very low glass transition temperature of P3HT (Tg ≈ 13 °C).46 More in general, it should be stressed that the role of the substrate temperature was found to be critical in the present study. Indeed, when thin PDIF-CN2 films were deposited on P3HT kept at room temperature, an unexpected de-wetting process of the overlayer was observed over time. Referring to Fig. S2 (ESI†), while an initial disordered morphology was achieved immediately after the deposition also in this case, the PDIF-CN2 overlayer undergoes a self-induced terracing after one month.47 The analysis of the equivalent PDIF-CN2 layer thickness, as deduced from the product between the average step heights and the overall coverage of the final terraced morphology, is compatible with the nominal t suggesting here the absence of the PDIF-CN2 diffusion within the P3HT substrate at room temperature. Conversely, for PDIF-CN2 films grown in the standard deposition conditions (Tsub = 110 °C), the de-wetting process was not encountered, and the film morphology was stable over time. Moreover, when PDIF-CN2 thickness was increased while Tsub was maintained at 110 °C, phase segregation and the polycrystalline order was restored, achieving the morphological features reported in Fig. 1(b) and (c). A more typical polycrystalline PDIF-CN2 structure similar to that of layers deposited on HMDS-treated SiO2 (Fig. 1(e)) is observed, although with an enhanced 3D character featuring smaller molecular grains having lateral size in the range of hundreds of nm. This effect could be mainly ascribed to a larger surface roughness of the P3HT (σRMS = 0.5 nm), in comparison with a HMDS-treated SiO2 surface (typically σRMS = 0.1–0.2 nm), as well as to its enhanced hydrophobic degree.48

(f) Transmission VIS spectra of a P3HT/PDIF-CN2 heterostructure and its comparison with the single-layer counterparts (green and red solid lines). 
For the sake of completeness, optical properties of the PDIF-CN2 and P3HT single layers, as well as of the corresponding bilayer, were also investigated by acquiring transmission VIS spectra, as those reported in Fig. 1(f). For this purpose, the organic layers were deposited on transparent glass substrates using the same procedures and identical parameters utilized for the deposition on the HMDS-treated SiO2 surfaces. From the P3HT and PDIF-CN2 single layer spectra (solid green and red line, respectively), in very good agreement with literature,30,49 optical band gaps of 1.96 eV and 2.11 eV were estimated as direct allowed transition cut-off's via α2vshν Tauc plots (Fig. S3, ESI†), being α the absorption coefficient. The P3HT/PDIF-CN2 bilayer absorption was qualitatively given by the sum of the two single materials with an enhanced electronic transition nearby 2.2 eV, accordingly with the first absorption peak of the PDIF-CN2. In this case, the absorption cut-off provided an optical bandgap being totally compatible with the value of the P3HT single layer, namely 1.95 eV.

Fig. 2(a) reports the output curves (drain–source current versus drain–source voltage at different applied gate–source voltages) acquired in vacuum for the P3HT and PDIF-CN2 single-layer transistors. In this case, films were 26 nm and 30 nm thick, respectively. As shown, the device responses appear to be quite standard for both materials. The P3HT (green solid lines) exhibits the classical hole-accumulation effect, with field-effect mobility in the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a well-defined current saturation region when Vds < −20 V. The n-type counterpart, represented by the PDIF-CN2 single layer (red solid lines), is characterized by maximum currents being three orders of magnitude larger than those achieved with P3HT and mobility values of approximately 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Gate-induced IDS current modulation provides final on/off current ratios of 103 and 106 for the P3HT and PDIF-CN2, respectively. When the two materials are brought in contact, on the other hand, the electronic characteristics of the heterointerfaces appeared to impact drastically the conduction mechanism in comparison to the single layer case. Comparing Fig. 2(a) and (b), it is possible to notice a neat transition from the pure semi-conducting behavior of the single layers to a highly-conducting response (symmetric in Vds) in the case of the bilayers. This feature suggests unambiguously the formation of an interfacial charged sheet parallel to the transport direction between the source–drain electrodes pair. In this framework, it is plausible to assume the accumulation of electrons in the n-type section of the interface inducing an equal and opposite hole density within the P3HT p-type substrate. Despite the maximum Ids currents flowing across the active channel were observed to increase with the nominal PDIF-CN2 thickness, conductivity (σ) of the interfacial charged layer appeared to saturate with t. Considering a rough estimation of , with L and W length and width of the active channel, respectively, a maximum average conductivity exceeding 10−2 S cm−1 was obtained in correspondence of t = 15 nm (Fig. 2(c)). This value gives a preliminary hint about the actual extension of the CT processes within both the donor and the acceptor layers, as further confirmed by the SKPFM analysis (see the next section). As outlined by the measured transfer curves (Ids–Vgs) reported in Fig. 2(d), the field-effect Ids current modulation was almost totally quenched when the PDIF-CN2 overlayer thickness overcame 5 nm. For the investigated 10, 15 and 45 nm thick PDIF-CN2 films, indeed, the corresponding transfer curves were basically flat (i.e. Vgs-independent). This clearly suggests that the conductive layer located at the P3HT/PDIF-CN2 junction is electrostatically independent from the dielectric/organic interface, or at least that the equivalent capacitive coupling between the charge carriers in the corresponding donor and acceptor material is considerably higher than the oxide capacitance (Cox = 17 nF cm2) as discussed in the following. In this sense, it is easy to consider the observed transfer characteristics as a degenerate case of an OFET response whose charge accumulation threshold voltages are far away from the investigated Vgs window. Conversely, for t = 5 nm, transfer curves showed the persistence of a p-type response, although the Ids current was one order of magnitude lower than those measured for the single-layer P3HT devices.

(b) Output curves acquired in vacuum for the P3HT/PDIF heterostructures as a function of the PDIF-CN2 overlayer nominal thicknesse. Blue and red lines correspond to N-branch (Vds > 0 V) and P-branch (Vds < 0 V), respectively. The curves are referred to Vgs = 0 V. (c) Conductivity of the bilayer as function of the PDIF-CN2 overlayer thickness t as retrieved from (b). Reported values are calculated considering σ averaged over |Vds| > 20 V. (d) Transfer-curves acquired in vacuum with Vds = +50 V, showing the quenched field-effect modulation. For t = 5 nm, it is still possible to observe a mild p-type behavior. 
For this case, the worse P3HT field-effect response for low PDIF-CN2 thicknesses is likely ascribable to the role of the previously mentioned intermixed buffer layer. Namely, diffused PDIF-CN2 molecules might act primarily as disorderly-distributed charge trapping50 rather than as acceptor sites supporting the early formation of the interfacial charge accumulation regions.
Space charge accumulation and band bending analysis
In the second part of our study, SKPFM was employed to infer quantitatively the effective spatial extension of the space charge layer, as well its influence on the overall energy band alignment at the heterointerface. The SKPFM technique51 is based on the direct evaluation of the contact potential difference (Vcpd) building up between the sample and a conductive AFM tip with high spatial resolution.52,53 When the two have a different work function, an electrostatic force applies to the AFM tip. The feedback of the SKPFM system counteracts the external force by applying an opposite DC voltage to the tip which nullifies pointwise the electrostatic contribution. In this way, the compensating voltage signal individuates the actual potential of the sample surface (Vsurf). Namely: (1)where ϕtip is the work function of the scanning probe and ϕs is the work function of the sample surface. SKPFM represents a valid PES complementary approach54 that overcomes the spatial resolution limits of the standard UPS/XPS methods and their sensitivity to surface photo-charge accumulation occurring for thick insulating samples as organic films. In our case, the specific work function difference (ΔΦ) between two organic materials, and its dependence with the overlayer thickness, gives direct indications to discriminate between a pure dipolar energy offset or CT-mediated band bending phenomena according to the observation of a proportional increase or of a saturating behavior of ΔΦ vs. t.55,56 Following those guidelines, we tested our P3HT/PDIF-CN2 heterointerfaces tracing the evolution of surface potentials as function of the PDIF-CN2 thickness. Several P3HT/PDIF-CN2 samples were fabricated for the scope with t ranging from 5 nm up to 45 nm. In this case, the deposited PDIF-CN2 was spatially confined through the use of a rectangular shadow mask (1 mm × 8 mm), in order to identify more clearly the single-layer/double-layer boundaries. Samples were analyzed by considering only areas in the proximity of the OFETs electrodes which shared a common ground connection with the AFM set-up so to have an absolute system of reference for the voltage signals to be compared to. Calibrated measurements allowed us to infer quantitatively the work function difference occurring between the two materials, or namely the VL shift as function of t, as well as the spatial extension of the charge accumulation At this regard, a reliable estimation of the tip work function (ϕtip) of the Cr/Au coated AFM probe was firstly acquired mapping the surface potential Vsurf of a freshly cleaved Highly Ordered Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG) sample. Assuming the calibrating surface as an ideal chemically inert surface with a known work function (ϕHOPG = 4.65 eV),57,58ϕtip was easily retrieved viaeqn (1), considering that ϕtip = 4.65 eV + eVsurf. The possible surface variability over the entire HOPG sample was effectively compensated considering multiple areas. A solid ϕtip reference value was lastly retrieved as a weighted average of the statistical distributions referred to multiple surface potential maps. For our experiments, we obtained ϕtip = 4.91 ± 0.02 eV which is totally consistent with values corresponding to air-exposed Au surfaces. The same AFM probe was used for the analysis of the entire dataset. Further details about the calibration procedure of the AFM tip on HOPG are reported in Fig. S4 (ESI†) for the sake of completeness. Once ϕtip was estimated, values for the surface work function under analysis were calculated as ϕs = ϕtip − eVsurf.
Surface potential (Vsurf) maps and their corresponding line profiles for t = 5, 10 and 45 nm are reported in Fig. 3(a). In Fig. 3(b), statistical distribution of the Vsurf maps for the different thicknesses (t) are displayed, setting the origin in correspondence of the P3HT bulk contribution and considering in this case the sole work function difference (ΔΦ expressed in meV). In correspondence of t = 5 nm, a small energy difference of about 60 meV is measured, as shown in the double-peaked black curve in Fig. 3(b), and the Vsurf boundary appears to be hardly discernible. As previously mentioned in the context of the morphological analysis of Fig. 1, such a feature is a further indication of the shallow electronic modification of the P3HT substrate as given by the vertically diffused PDIF-CN2 molecules forming a distributed intermixed mild doped P3HT layer. For increasing thickness of the PDIF-CN2 overlayer, conversely, the evolution of the work function difference between the two organic semiconductors, namely the vacuum level difference, follows a well-defined asymptotic growth up to ≈500 meV, as retrieved for t = 45 nm (black symbols in Fig. 3(c)). Analogously to the conductivity analysis of Fig. 2(c), ΔΦ saturates precisely in correspondence of t = 15 nm confirming the formation of a charged region with the same thickness and in accordance with similar results reported for different organic junctions.59–61 Following the arguments proposed by Rojas et al. for a similar P3HT/C60 structure,62 the overall observed behavior can be well-fitted by an empirical exponential relationship of the form ΔΦ(t′) = ΔΦmax(1 − e−γ(t′ − t0)) where t′ − t0 individuates the effective depth within the PDIF-CN2 overlayer (t0 = 5 nm being the starting point in our dataset, ΔΦmax = 510 ± 20 meV and γ = 0.4 ± 0.1 nm−1 as fitting parameter). Considering a mono-dimensional formulation of the Poisson equation as modeling the heterointerface, the charge density profile can be extracted according to: (2)where εr ≈ 3 is the dielectric constant of the PDIF-CN2 layer. As reported in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the space charge profile follows an inverted exponential behavior saturating within 15 nm where it can be assumed that most of the charge density is confined. Given that, we extracted an average value within the same range of N ≈ 2 × 1018 cm−3. Lastly, it is interesting to notice that the P3HT-related double-peak feature for ΔΦ ≈ 60 meV, which has been already discussed for t = 5 nm and that cannot be observed for a bare P3HT single layer (see the discussion in the following), followed the whole dataset as highlighted by the red symbols in Fig. 3(c). This effect may be related to a residual intermixed layer modification given by the highly efficient molecular diffusivity of the PDIF-CN2 molecules spanning also laterally at few hundreds of nm from the metallic mask boundary.

Upper panel shows the corresponding surface potential profile in the case of t = 5 nm and 45 nm (black and red dashed lines, respectively) (b) fitted height histograms of work function differences (ΔΦ) for different PDIF-CN2 overlayer thickness t. For the sake of clarity, curves are shifted over the vertical axis. (c) Summary of the work function differences of panel (b) expressed as function of t. It is possible to observe the asymptotic saturation from t = 15 nm highlighted in light blue. The red dotted line is a guide for the eyes referred to the almost t-independent diffused PDIF-CN2 term. 
All the above results are summarized in the schematic band diagram reported in Fig. 4. The SKPFM analysis indicated that band bending clearly occurs in the two materials near the heterojunction interface within 15 nm on both sides. The now holes-rich molecular level of the P3HT is subsequently bent upwards while the electron filled conduction band of the PDIF-CN2 bends downwards to reach the equilibrium across the donor/acceptor junction. The work function difference and HOMO/LUMO offset are the main driving elements inducing charge transfer between two different organic semiconductors.63 Moreover, the SCL conductivity might be favored by the band broadening and the possible overlap of the tail states of the HOMO (P3HT) and LUMO (PDIF-CN2) levels, given the enhanced morphological disorder at the interface due to the presence of the intermixed buffer layer of ≈5 nm. It should be highlighted that the precise estimation of the CT extension is a fundamental parameter. In OPVs and BHJs light power conversion efficiency is directly related to the excitonic dissociation. This feature mostly relies on the presence of an internal built-in potential which, in systems similar to our P3HT/PDIF-CN2 junctions, can be significantly affected by the occurrence of hole/electron accumulation layers localized at the interface.62 In this sense, the presence of a very thin SCL, with sizes comparable to those of the phase domains, is crucial in maximizing the interfacial area and reducing recombination processes within the donor/acceptor SCL.64 Moreover, in the light of the precise determination of the charge density characterizing the junction, a qualitative estimation of the interfacial capacitance coupling between the charge accumulated layers gives also a plausible key of interpretation of the observed lack of ambipolar transport, as deduced from the electrical characterization of Fig. 2(b). Considering no bias applied across the two organic layers, the Mott–Schottky equation gives an approximate assessment of the equivalent capacitance per unit of area of the space charge layer,65 namely  where Vbi = 500 mV is assumed to be the built-in voltage for a fully formed conducting layer as deduced from SKPFM experiments, ε is the dielectric constant and Navg = 2 × 1018 cm−3 is the average charge density accumulating at the interface: i.e. a capacitance value thus one order of magnitude higher with respect the cox of our OFET architecture (17 nF cm−2).
 Fig. 4  Band diagram of the P3HT/PDIF-CN2 heterointerface highlighting the band bending occurring along the organic boundary. At the equilibrium, it is possible to consider the organic heterointerface as characterized by the mutual interaction between the HOMO band of the P3HT and the LUMO band of the PDIF-CN2 layer. Each material acts as mutual donor of the majority carriers for the other. A volumetric charge density forms, which is qualitatively portraited in the right-end panel. 
Lastly, the volumetric effect of the PDIF-CN2 coverage, as well as its morphological structure over the doping state of the P3HT substrate, was more deeply investigated. For this type of analysis, a circular PDIF-CN2 spot with a diameter of about 8 mm was over deposited on the P3HT underlayer. Two different samples with a PDIF-CN2 thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm were considered (Fig. 5). During the PDIF-CN2 layer deposition, the mask was intentionally kept at about 1 mm over the target substrate in order to exacerbate the shadow effect along the circular border. This resulted in a boundary area with a progressively decreasing effective PDIF-CN2 coverage Fig. 5(a)–(c).

Four different scanning zones were identified and analyzed, ranging over the entire coverage spectrum (Fig. 5(g)). Potential maps of Fig. 5(d)–(f) allow to visually infer surface potential landscapes of the partially covered P3HT areas. Data are reported in terms of the work function (Φ) distributions in Fig. 5(h). Starting the analysis from the area where the PDIF-CN2 layer is compact (spot #1), a single peak value referred to bulk material was observed at ≈5.7 eV (≈5.5 eV for the 15 nm thick PDIF-CN2 sample). Considering the PDIF-CN2 as an intrinsic semiconductor, those values are totally compatible with the theoretical work function retrieved if EF would approximately fall in the middle of the PDIF-CN2 energy gap (≈5.65 eV).23 Conversely, bimodal distributions are observed for spots #2 and #3 where PDIF-CN2 coverage was estimated to be about 70%/80%. In this case, peaks corresponding to the exposed P3HT portions (green shaded areas) are centered at ≈5.15 eV and ≈5.25 eV, respectively. Far away from the heterostructure region (point #4), a narrow single peak centered at 4.75 ± 0.02 eV is retrieved for the bare P3HT surface. Focusing the attention on the doping magnitude for the P3HT, an overview of the ΦP3HT evolution as function of the overlayer coverage is summarized in Fig. 5(i). Starting from an ideal 0% coverage, P3HT can be already considered in a doped state. The interaction with the substrate,66 as well a partial oxidation possibly related to the atmosphere exposure occurred prior to the PDIF-CN2 deposition, determined an initial shift as high as 0.35/0.55 eV with respect to the values typically reported for intrinsic P3HT films (ΦP3HT = 4.2/4.4 eV).54,67 On the other hand, a further ΦP3HT increase up to values as high as 5.2 eV followed coherently the progressive transfer of electrons from the P3HT towards the acceptor PDIF-CN2 overlayer (Fig. 5(i)), bringing to a considerable increase of about 0.8/1.0 eV in comparison to the ideal P3HT case. It should be pointed out, however, that the PDIF-CN2 diffusivity during the early stages of the layer growth, as above described, might still influence the absolute estimation of ΦP3HT in the exposed areas, although it can be assumed to be limited to a maximum offset of ≈50/60 meV. We note that the control over the P3HT doping state here demonstrated could be promptly applied in polythiophene-based devices. The fine work function tuning, for example, can be applied to modulate the effective energy barrier from metal electrodes, that might alleviate contact effects in OFETs,68 or for the integration of a charge injectors with a specific energy offset in optoelectronic devices. Lastly, it is safe to assume that the electrostatic interaction is firstly mediated by the presence of strong electron withdrawing groups decorating the PDIF-CN2 molecules: i.e. the cyano groups (CN) and the perfluoroalkyl chain substitutions (–CH2C3F7) comprising multiple highly-polar C–F bonds.69 In this sense, the observed diffusivity of early deposited molecules, plays a major role for the consequent ΦP3HT shift fully occurring at increasing PDIF-CN2 thicknesses or coverages.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy experiments, relying on different approaches, provided a detailed insight over the charge transfer and the consequent band bending phenomena occurring at the organic/organic heterostructures comprising donor (P3HT) and acceptor (PDIF-CN2) semiconductors. The overlayer thickness dependence of the vacuum level shift clearly indicated the formation of a hole/electron rich volume upon contact. The presence of a densely-charged region was reflected into a neat semiconductor-to-conductor transition of the P3HT/PDIF-CN2 bilayer in corresponding field-effect transistors with planar architectures. The thickness of the charge accumulated area at the P3HT/PDIF-CN2 junction was estimated as 15 nm, extending on both sides of the interface, with an average charge density of ≈1018 cm−3. The volumetric interaction between the two organic semiconductors has been ultimately assessed considering the P3HT doping level as function of the PDIF-CN2 overlayer nominal coverage. P3HT work function as high as 5.25 eV was estimated, i.e. a difference of ≈1 eV with respect to typically reported values for the polymer in its intrinsic conditions. As whole, these experiments highlighted also the efficiency in tuning the P3HT electronic properties by exploiting the controlled deposition of n-type small molecules, paving the way for future application of perylene-diimide/P3HT heterostructures in organic optoelectronic devices with enhanced functionalities.
