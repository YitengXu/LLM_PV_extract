    , Accepted 18th April 2017First published on 18th April 2017AbstractIn this work, a novel catalytic system for the sunlight-driven water splitting reaction, which exploits the photocatalytic ability of BiVO4 coupled to a new kind of noble-metal-free organic dye molecules, is proposed. Hence, mono- and di-substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) were designed to have different functional groups that provide to them both tunable optical properties and adjustable HOMO/LUMO levels, and were selectively prepared (starting from 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid) achieving yields >69%. Smart anchoring groups (i.e. carboxylates or aromatic amines) were added to the dyes in order to allow them to covalently bond to acidic –OH groups present on the BiVO4 surface. An easy and low-cost room temperature dip-coating technique was used to dye-sensitize both BiVO4 powders and thin films. NMR, MS, FT-IR, TG, FESEM, XRD, XPS and optical analyses confirmed the successful organic synthetic routes and good dyes/BiVO4 linkages. Photochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction tests, together with DFT calculations, demonstrated that a proper alignment of the semiconductor/NDI-based dye energy levels is fundamental for enhancing the photocatalyst performance through a Z-scheme mechanism. The ability of the NDI organic molecules to delocalize the electronic charges was also a key factor for minimizing recombination processes and achieving more than a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent density of a 6 cm2 BiVO4 photo-electrode. The here reported results open new perspectives for the utilization of this new series of core-substituted NDIs, which are able to improve the activity of photocatalysts for different sunlight-driven applications, e.g. waste water treatment and organic contaminants’ degradation, other than the production of solar fuels by water splitting mechanisms.
1. Introduction
Light driven water-splitting into H2 and O2 is a topic of current interest,1–3 and the development of a photocatalyst that can utilize the entire electromagnetic spectrum, in order to enhance the overall efficiency of the process, is nowadays a challenging problem.4 In this context, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has recently gained increasing attention for its use as a photo-anode capable of promoting the oxidation of water to O2 in the half reaction of a complete PEC cell.5–8 BiVO4 is one of the most promising photocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of its relatively low band gap of 2.4 eV9 for the monoclinic phase, which enables a more efficient use of visible light, and due to the adequate position of the conduction and valence bands compared to the potential of water oxidation. Moreover, BiVO4 is nontoxic and is composed of relatively abundant elements. Regardless of the above quoted advantages provided by this inorganic semiconductor, bare BiVO4 powders and photo-anodes have usually shown relatively poor performances for photochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) O2 evolution due to slow O2 evolution kinetics, slow electron transport in the conduction band and, additionally, a significant electron–hole recombination at both the bulk and surface.10
Several attempts have been performed in order to obtain optimum crystal structures and morphologies that are capable of enhancing the oxygen evolution activity of BiVO4.11–15 Morphology control (heterojunction, homojunction, nanocasting, etc.)16–18 and doping techniques19–22 have been investigated with the aim to enhance the BiVO4 photocatalytic efficiency by improving both the surface area and electron/hole mobility, which are necessary to minimize recombination loses and facilitate the superficial charge transfer.
An alternative of this is the sensitization of the photocatalysts in order to use part of the solar spectrum that would not be exploited otherwise. In order to warrant a good electron/hole transfer between a sensitizer and the photocatalyst, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye must have higher energy than the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of the semiconductor, respectively. Regarding the last approach, several configurations for noble-metal-containing dyes have been reported (e.g. Ru, Rh- or Pd containing dyes).23,24 However, few metal-free dyes have been reported as efficient sensitizers for water splitting.25,26 Besides, surface functionalization could represent a more powerful and, at the same time, easily tunable approach able to improve the activity of BiVO4. Indeed, recent developments in this context deal with the use of functionalized carbon dots (CDs) for sensitizing semiconductor photo-electrodes.27,28 Recently, the photocatalytic enhancement of semiconductor based (i.e. TiO2) materials impregnated with a visible active polymer, i.e. polyaniline has also been reported.29 Nevertheless, investigations concerning the use of organic visible-light active species to provide dye-sensitized systems have received less attention so far. Although Ru complex photosensitizers have shown a very impressive conversion efficiency, their large-scale application is limited because of costs and environmental issues. In this context, metal-free organic dyes present many advantages, such as a large molar extinction coefficient, control of the absorption wavelength, facile design and synthesis, and lower cost that may make them competitive with noble-metal-based complexes, in the near future.
In this work, we report our efforts toward the preparation of a novel catalytic system for light-driven OER, which combines the proven ability of the inorganic BiVO4 in photochemical transformations with an organic visible-light active species, i.e. core substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs). Four mono- and di-substituted NDIs were selectively prepared with 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid as the precursor. Appropriate control of the reaction conditions, including bromination, condensation and bromide substitution, was performed in order to obtain four metal-free dyes having different functional groups, which provide them with tunable optical properties (for an efficient light-harvesting of all of the solar spectrum) and adjustable HOMO/LUMO levels. BiVO4, both powder and films, were impregnated with the dyes in order to investigate the effect of the dyes on the photocatalytic responses. BiVO4 powder and photo-anodes were prepared by previously optimized hydrothermal30 and spin-coating6 techniques, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 impregnated with four different NDIs was proven by evaluating both their photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical behavior for the OER from water splitting under simulated sunlight irradiation. The physico-chemical properties of all the prepared heterostructures were fully characterized, as well.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Syntheses of core-substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs)

2.1.1. General. 
Solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa-Aesar), unless otherwise stated, and were purified and dried according to standard procedures.31 Air sensitive reactions were carried out under argon in dry solvents and glassware. Flash column chromatography was carried out using a forced flow of the indicated solvent on Merck silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). Reactions were monitored by TLC carried out on 0.25 mm E. Merck silica gel 60 F254 glass or aluminum plates. Multinuclear NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz instrument. Chemical shift values for 1H and 13C were referred to internal SiMe4 (0.0 ppm). Significant peaks are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br s, broad singlet), coupling constant(s) in hertz (Hz) and number of protons. High resolution electrospray ionisation (HR-ESI) mass spectra were collected in the positive mode on a MAT95XL from Thermo Finnigan. Matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF spectrometer using dithranol as the matrix. The instrument was equipped with a nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm, a 2 GHz sampling rate digitizer, a pulsed ion extraction source and a reflectron. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in the pressed ATR mode on a Bruker Vector 22 spectrometer. TGA experiments were performed by using the furnace of a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851 instrument. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectra were recorded using a Siemens EM-10110BU D5000 diffractometer.
The synthetic strategy for the preparation of substituted-naphthalenediimides (dyes 1 to 4) is schematized in Fig. 1 and explained in the following sections 2.1.2 to 2.1.7.
 Fig. 1  Synthetic strategy for the preparation of substituted-naphthalenediimides. Reagent conditions: (i) 4-aminopyridine/DMF, 135 °C/24 h; (ii) tribromocyanuric acid/oleum, 140 °C/24 h; (iii) 2,6-diisopropylaniline/CH3COOH, 120 °C/25 min; (iv) 10 equiv. of 4-aminobenzoic acid/DMF, 135 °C/2 h; (v) 40 equiv. of 4-aminobenzoic acid/DMF, 135 °C/5 h; (vi) 40 equiv. of 4-aminobenzoic acid/DMF, 150 °C/2 h. 


2.1.2. 
            Dye 1: N,N′-dipyridyl 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride. 
As shown in Fig. 1(i), a mixture of 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (0.8 g, 3 mmol) and 4-aminopyridine (0.56 g, 6 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (20 mL) was heated under reflux for 8 h. When the reaction mixture reached room temperature (r.t.), a crystalline solid precipitated out, which was collected by filtration. The crude product was purified by several recrystallization steps from DMF to obtain the pure compound named dye 1 as pale yellow-orange needles (876 mg, 69% of yield).


2.1.3. 2,6-Dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (Br,Br-NDA). 
As shown in Fig. 1(ii), a solution of dibromoisocyanuric acid (2.86 g, 10.0 mmol) in oleum (20% SO3, 50 mL) was added at room temperature to a solution of naphthalene dianhydride (2.68 g, 10.0 mmol) in oleum (20% SO3, 100 mL) over a period of 4 h. The resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. for 1 h, and then cautiously poured onto crushed ice (500 g) to give a bright yellow precipitate. Water (1.5 L) was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand overnight at r.t. The yellow solid was collected on a Büchner funnel and dried in air providing the crude product, which was used for the next step without further purification. As it was not possible to purify it at this stage, we assumed quantitative formation. Mp: >350 °C. Due to its extremely low solubility, no NMR spectrum could be obtained. It is worth mentioning that batch-to-batch differences in the ratio of mono-, di- and tetra-Br NDAs were noticed, which seemed to reflect the sensitivity of this reaction with respect to the concentration of SO3 in oleum.


2.1.4. 
            N,N′-Di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,Br-NDI). 
As shown in Fig. 1(iii), a mixture containing 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride (601.6 mg, 1.41 mmol) was suspended in acetic acid (30 mL) and heated at reflux for 30 min. Freshly distilled 2,6-diisopropylaniline (1.6 mL, 8.47 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture was kept at reflux at 120 °C for 30 min. The solution was poured into a mixture of crushed ice and distilled water and allowed to stand for 2 h at r.t. The red solid was collected on a Büchner funnel, dried at 60 °C for 2 h and then purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes:Et2O 98:2) to give the desired compound as a red-orange solid (205 mg, 20% yield).


2.1.5. 
            Dye 2: N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-aminobenzoic acid-6-bromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,N-NDI). 
For reaction (iv) (Fig. 1), in a 25 mL Schlenk-flask purged with argon a mixture of N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,Br-NDI) (71 mg, 0.095 mmol) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (131 mg, 0.956 mmol) in 3 mL anhydrous DMF was stirred at 135 °C. The clear red solution turned deep violet after 2 h and was cooled to room temperature before quenching with aqueous saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3 × 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting waxy material was placed under high vacuum until DMF was completely removed and a violet-blue solid was obtained. Purification by column chromatography on silica gel (DCM:MeOH 9:1) provided dye 2 as a violet solid (71 mg, 93%).


2.1.6. 
            Dye 3: N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-aminobenzoic acid-6-dimethylamine-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (N,N-NDI). 
For reaction (v) (Fig. 1), in a 25 mL Schlenk-flask purged with argon a mixture of N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,Br-NDI) (40 mg, 0.054 mmol) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (295 mg, 2.15 mmol) in 2 mL of anhydrous DMF was stirred at 135 °C. The clear red solution turned deep blue after 5 h and was cooled to r.t. before quenching with aqueous saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3 × 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting waxy material was placed under high vacuum until DMF was completely removed and a violet-blue solid was obtained. Purification by column chromatography on silica gel (DCM:MeOH 9:1) provided dye 3 as a blue solid (40 mg, 96%).


2.1.7. 
            Dye 4: N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-aminobenzoic acid-6-bromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,N-NDI). 
For reaction (vi) (Fig. 1), in a 25 mL Schlenk-flask purged with argon a mixture of N,N′-di-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2-aminobenzoic acid-6-bromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (Br,N-NDI) (75 mg, 0.094 mmol) and 4-aminobenzoic acid (129.2 mg, 0.94 mmol) in 4 mL anhydrous NMP was stirred at 150 °C. The clear violet solution turned deep blue after 48 h and was cooled to r.t. before quenching with aqueous saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (3 × 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting waxy material was placed under high vacuum until NMP was completely removed and a blue solid was obtained. Purification by column chromatography on silica gel (DCM:MeOH 9:1) provided dye 4 as a blue solid (73 mg, 90%).

2.2. Preparation of the BiVO4 photocatalyst

2.2.1. BiVO4 powders. 
BiVO4 powders were prepared following a previously optimized procedure.30 Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) both from Sigma Aldrich were used as BiVO4 precursors. No further purification of the reagents was performed. In the first step, 3.7 mmol of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 3.7 mmol of NH4VO3 and 12 mmol of ammonium carbonate were dissolved in 75 mL of 1 M HNO3. After 30 min of stirring at room temperature, a clear solution was obtained (pH = 0). The mixture was then heated for 12 h at 180 °C in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel auto-clave under autogenous pressure. The precipitate was filtered, washed three times with distilled water and then with ethanol, and dried at r.t. The dry samples were annealed at 450 °C for 2 h. All the chemicals used in the experiments were also of analytical grade and bi-distilled water was used for the preparation of the solution.


2.2.2. BiVO4 films. 
BiVO4 films were prepared by a spin-coating method into FTO-substrates over a 2 × 3 cm2 area. The FTO-glass substrates were cleaned in acetone and ethanol by means of ultrasonication, and then washed with bi-distilled water before BiVO4 deposition. For a typical deposition, two different solutions were prepared by dissolving 2.97 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in 15 mL of acetic acid and 1.624 g of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) in 75 mL of acetylacetone. Such amounts are doubled with respect to a recently published report,6 in order to increase the thickness of the film by each single spin-coating step. The mixture of those solutions, which have a Bi/V atomic ratio of 1, was subjected to ultrasonication for 30 min at 59 Hz to obtain a stable sol that was then spin-coated at 500 rpm for 10 s into the FTO-glass substrates. After drying at 150 °C for 5 min on a hot plate, the films were annealed at 400 °C for 10 min in order to induce BiVO4 crystallization. After natural cooling at r.t., this procedure was repeated one more time to increase the film thickness. The electrodes were finally annealed at 400 °C for 2 h.

2.3. Preparation of naphthalenediimide decorated BiVO4
The anchorage of the dye molecules to both the BiVO4 powder and film (see Fig. 2) was accomplished by modified dip-coating techniques based on previously reported procedures.32,33 Different solvent systems and conditions (i.e. Method A and Method B shown in Table 1) were used depending on the solubility of the organic substrates. In a typical reaction, the dye was dissolved in a dry solvent and added via cannula over 0.10 g of finely ground BiVO4 powder previously charged in a 100 mL round-bottom flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and maintained under an inert atmosphere. The resulting suspension was stirred overnight and the solid material was separated by filtration on a fritted glass funnel, washed with 20 mL of the respective hot solvent solution and dried at 100 °C for 1 h.

2.4. Physicochemical characterization of naphthalenediimides-BiVO4
The crystalline structure and morphology of pristine and impregnated BiVO4 powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer) analysis by using a Cu-Kα X-ray tube, λ = 1.54 Å with 40 kV of accelerating voltage and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) images obtained with a Zeiss Merlin microscope.
UV-Vis reflectance spectra (%R) were collected with a spectrophotometer (Cary 500 by Varian) by using an integration sphere. The surface composition of the samples was characterized by X-ray photo-electron-spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5000 VersaProbe). The XPS analyses were carried out with a VG Escalab 200-C X-ray photo-electron-spectrometer, with a non-monochromatic Mg–K source. A pass energy of 20 eV, a resolution of 1.1 eV, and a step of 0.2 eV were used for the high-resolution spectra. The effects of sample charging were eliminated by referring the spectral line shift to a C 1s binding energy value of 284.6 eV.
2.5. Water oxidation activity of naphthalenediimide-decorated BiVO4

2.5.1. Photocatalytic oxygen evolution measurements. 
The catalytic activity was measured by means of the previously reported Clark cell system.22 In a typical test, 10 mg BiVO4 were tested in 11 mL of a 50 mM AgNO3 solution. Dissolved O2 (DO) was measured with a Clark type electrode (InPro 6050/120, Mettler Toledo). Prior to each measurement, O2 was removed by flowing N2 through the liquid phase with a positive pressure of 1.05 atm. Then, the reactor was illuminated with simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with a plasma lamp (LIFI STA-40, LUXIM). The O2 evolution rate (RO2) was measured as the slope of the initial portion of DO curves [dDO/dt]0 and the max value of oxygen (DO*) was considered as the total oxygen production. A control without catalyst was performed in the dark and under illumination in order to determine the increment of DO due to atmospheric oxygen.


2.5.2. Photoelectrochemical measurements. 
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were performed with a standard three-electrode setup in a lab-made cell. An Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) electrode and a Pt wire were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The measurements were recorded with a multichannel VSP potentiostat/galvanostat (BioLogic), equipped with EC-Lab v. 10.1x software for data acquisition. Potentials vs. the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale by using the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + E0Ag/AgCl + 0.059 pH. ERHE is the converted potential vs. RHE (e.g. VRHE), E0Ag/AgCl is the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) at 25 °C, i.e. 0.209 V, and EAg/AgCl is the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (e.g. VAg/AgCl). The catalytic activity of BiVO4 films was tested at pH = 7.0 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were performed in the dark and under continuous or chopped simulated solar light, in the range between 0.4 VRHE and 1.6 VRHE (with a sweep rate of 20 mV s−1). The intensity of the light was maintained at 100 mW cm−2 by adjusting the distance between the light source (i.e. a Newport 450 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter simulating sunlight and a water filter) and the PEC cell. Chrono-amperometry (CA) measurements were performed at 1.23 VRHE over chopped (2 min dark and 2 min light) visible light irradiation. The charge transfer resistance across the semiconductor–electrolyte interface was evaluated by EIS measurements, conducted in the 0.1 Hz to 0.5 MHz frequency range, with an alternating current (AC) amplitude of 25 mV at different applied potentials (i.e. 0.63, 0.93, 1.23 and 1.53 VRHE). In order to measure the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, the PEC cell was illuminated using a Newport Xe lamp (150 W) by varying the incident light from 300 nm to 700 nm (step size: 10 nm) by means of a monochromator (Cornerstone 130 by Newport), at an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE. In this case, the electrode illuminated area was 1 cm2 and the light power density was about 1 mW cm−2, measured at 390 nm.

2.6. Experimental determination of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the band gap (Eg) between them were determined via cyclic voltammetry (CV) by using the onset potential of the first oxidation and reduction peak, respectively. The estimations can be done with the empirical relation, shown in eqn (1) and (2), including the ferrocene (Fc) oxidation value of 4.8 eV as the external standard.34E½(Fc) is equal to 0.4 V.35 (1) (2)where EOX and ERED are the onset potentials [VAg/AgCl] of oxidation and reduction, respectively. The experiments were performed in a three electrode system consisting of a Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a glassy carbon working electrode. Three consecutive CVs with a scan rate of 100 mV min−1 between −3 VAg/AgCl and 4 VAg/AgCl were carried out. For the preparation of the sample, 20 μL of a solution containing the dye (10 mg ml−1) was dropped on a glassy carbon electrode and left to evaporate under dark conditions. The supporting electrolyte was a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile. To ensure that there is no oxygen in the electrolyte, a purge with nitrogen was performed for 15 min at a flow rate of 24 N ml min−1 before each measurement.
2.7. Computational details
All calculations were performed using the Gaussian09 series of programs.36 Full quantum mechanics calculations on the energy levels of the dyes were performed within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using the BP8637,38 and PBE39,40 functionals with the basis set 6-31 g(d,p),41–43 for all the atoms. All geometry optimizations were full, with no restrictions using the Berny algorithm implemented in Gaussian09.44 The solvent effects of the acetonitrile were computed via the continuum IEF-PCM model.45

3.1 Synthesis of core-substituted NDIs
The syntheses of dyes 1–4 described in this work were performed according to the scheme represented in Fig. 1. The condensation between the commercially available 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid dianhydride and 4-aminopyridine in anhydrous DMF, provided the first target compound dye 1 with 69% of yield after several recrystallization steps as confirmed by NMR, FT-IR and MS analyses (see section 2.1.2).
The preparation of the key intermediate (i.e. 2,6-dibromo-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride) for the syntheses of dyes 2 to 4 was accomplished by the bromination of the starting anhydride with dibromoisocyanuric acid (DBI) in oleum. A mixture of poly-brominated products was obtained and was directly employed in the next condensation with 2,6-di-isopropyl-aniline. To avoid SNAr reactions, the latter step was performed in acetic acid, where most amino functions were protonated.46 The reaction product was isolated with 54% of yield and confirmed by NMR, FTIR and MS analyses (see the ESI†).
Subsequently, the substitution of the two bromide substituents was achieved using various reagents to produce dyes 2 to 4 (see sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6). The novel mono- and di-substituted cNDIs (i.e.dyes 2–4) were selectively prepared from the same intermediate and 4-aminobenzoic acid through an appropriate control of the reaction conditions (time and equivalents of 4-aminobenzoic acid). It is worth illustrating that the introduction of the NMe2 functionality by SNAr substitution occurred unexpectedly from DMF decomposition. Indeed, some literature reports47,48 described that under specific reaction conditions DMF could decompose providing a source of the –NMe2 group, which in our case would be responsible for the second substitution on the naphthalene core.
The purity and composition of all the prepared NDIs were confirmed by NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy as well as by MS characterization (Fig. S1–S5 in the ESI†) and an excellent yield of the syntheses was obtained: 93%, 96% and 96%, for dyes 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
Moreover, the newly synthesized NDIs evidence light absorption over a broad range of wavelengths in the UV and Vis ranges (see Fig. S6, ESI†); i.e. between 200 and 390 nm for all the dyes and with peaks in the visible region for dyes 2 to 4. Indeed, dye 1 evidences main adsorption peaks in the UV range, at wavelengths (λ) of 237 and 350 nm, as expected for core-unsubstituted NDIs.46 Instead, dyes 2, 3 and 4 present a significant bathochromical shift of the absorption maxima, attaining noticeable visible light harvesting peaks at 520, 600 and 660 nm, respectively, other than in the UV region, because of the different functionalization introduced into the naphthalene core.46 Interestingly, dye 4 practically covers all of the solar spectrum with a more constant light absorption intensity. The here synthesized core-substituted NDIs are thus suitable to cover the “green gap”, i.e. operate at wavelengths longer than 500 nm, hence, being promising materials to be used in photocatalytic systems with other semiconductor materials.
The resulting optical properties of the dyes obviously depend on their HOMO and LUMO energies and band gap (Eg), which also are closely correlated to the photocatalytic behavior of the dye-sensitized BiVO4 photocatalyst and, therefore, will be introduced in section 3.3.
3.2 Structural, optical and chemical characterization of NDI-decorated BiVO4
The efficient anchoring of the NDI dyes onto the BiVO4 surface was confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, TGA, FESEM and XPS analyses. The quantification of the amount of each dye in the corresponding functionalized material was obtained by thermogravimetric analyses (see Fig. S7b and S8, ESI†). The highest impregnation, equal to 42 wt%, was obtained with dye 1, followed by dye 4, dye 3 and dye 2 with a 14 wt%, 6 wt% and 3.8 wt%, respectively. The highest impregnation obtained with dye 1 could be attributed to the highest concentration used during the impregnation, which was 5-fold higher than the one used with dyes 2–4. Nevertheless, the different functional groups present in dyes 1 to 4 also have a direct effect on the binding interactions formed with the BiVO4 surface and, consequently, on the final dye loading.
Previous FT-IR analysis and amine absorption test carried out on BiVO4 samples revealed the presence of Lewis acid sites on its surface,49 that are supposed to be the main anchoring moiety during the functionalization of the semiconductor. In the case of the simple core-unsubstituted NDI (dye 1), which contains two pyridine moieties, it is possible that this kind of linker established a stronger interaction with the BiVO4 surface by means of the two exposed aromatic nitrogen atoms. Instead, in the case of dyes 2–4, the carboxylic acid functionality, which is the most commonly used anchoring group for dye sensitized solar cells,33 is envisaged to be the linkage moiety with the BiVO4 surface.
From a structural and morphological point of view, the bare BiVO4 powder exhibits a monoclinic scheelite crystalline phase (see the FESEM image, Fig. 3a, and the XRD spectrum, Fig. 4a). BiVO4 powder's diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the standard Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card no. 14-0688 (space group: I2/a, a = 5.195, b = 11.701, c = 5.092, β = 90.38°) and show the characteristic peak splitting diffractions at 2θ = 18.5, 35 and 46°.30 No traces of scheelite–tetragonal or zircon–tetragonal phases are observed in the diffraction pattern, which points out the high selectivity of the chosen synthesis method. As shown in Fig. 3, after the impregnation with the dyes, the level of coverage of the BiVO4 crystals varies with the dye used. In particular, the surface of the BiVO4 crystals impregnated with dye 1 is completely covered by a needle-like crystalline structure (Fig. 3b). Coherently, the X-ray diffraction of the BiVO4 + dye 1 powder shown in Fig. 4a evidences three peaks at 19.2, 22.8 and 23.6° that correspond to the crystalline structure of dye 1, whose complete XRD spectrum is exhibited in Fig. S7c (ESI†). In contrast to dye 1, dyes 2–4, have an amorphous structure, forming an external layer on the photocatalyst that fills the BiVO4 inter-particle spaces. The image corresponding to the BiVO4 powder impregnated by dye 4 is exhibited as an example in Fig. 3c, which is representative of what was observed after impregnation with dyes 2 and 3, as well. Fig. 3c shows the BiVO4 crystals with grain boundaries that are less defined than those reported in Fig. 3a (for bare BiVO4) and are evidently embedded in the non-crystalline shell constituted by the dye. Indeed, due to the covering of the BiVO4 powder with dyes 2 to 4, less defined BiVO4 XRD peaks were observed (Fig. 4a), which again is in agreement with a good coverage of the BiVO4 crystals by these dyes.

 Fig. 4  Physicochemical characterization: (a) X-ray diffraction patterns and (b) UV-Vis spectra in total reflectance of the pristine BiVO4 powder and impregnated with dyes 1 to 4. 
The UV-Vis spectra, in reflectance percentage (%R), of the bare BiVO4 in comparison with the dye-anchored powders are shown in Fig. 4b. These curves are inversely proportional to the absorption spectrum. As expected and in agreement with previous results, the impregnation with dyes 2–4 increases the absorption region of BiVO4 to the visible region. This was not observed with dye 1, which mainly absorbs in the UV-region (see Fig. S6†). Interestingly, dye 3 maintains the absorption in the UV-region, whereas dyes 2 and 4 showed less absorption than bare BiVO4 in the range of λ < 500 nm.
The surface coverage of the BiVO4 with the dye is confirmed by the XPS spectra as well (Fig. 5). The intensities of Bi 4f and V 2p spectra, corresponding to elements present only in the BiVO4 molecule, decrease in the order: bare BiVO4 > BiVO4 + dye 3 > BiVO4 + dye 2 > BiVO4 + dye 1 > BiVO4 + dye 4. From the C 1s spectra of the samples, three peaks are observed, where the peak at 284 eV is attributed to adventitious carbon contamination. In addition, the peaks, observed in the positions 286 eV and 288 eV for C 1s and 532 eV and 533 eV for O 1s, are attributed to the organic C–O and CO bonds, respectively, and are present (as expected) only in the dye-impregnated powders. Moreover, in the O 1s spectra (Fig. 5b), the peak at 530 eV represents the binding energy of oxygen in metal oxides that, in this case and in line with the previous results, shows the highest intensity for the bare BiVO4 sample. Finally, the highest intensity for the N 1s high resolution XPS spectra, presented in Fig. 5c, was observed for dye 1, followed by dye 4, dye 3 and dye 2, interestingly, following the same trend observed in the weight percentage of the dyes loaded into the BiVO4 powder measured by TGA.

3.3 Water oxidation photocatalytic performances of NDI decorated BiVO4 particles
The photocatalytic activity of the bare and dye-impregnated BiVO4 powders was measured by means of a Clark type photo-reactor (see Fig. 6a), where atmospheric oxygen was stripped by a constant nitrogen flow which maintained a positive pressure (1.05 bar) inside the reactor. Dissolved oxygen curves are shown in Fig. 6b, which were obtained in the course of the experiment with a Clark electrode. After 10 minutes under dark conditions, the reactor was illuminated with 1 sun of irradiance and, in that instant, the curves show a sudden increment in the oxygen production. It is worth noting that the slight increment of the oxygen under dark conditions is due to the baseline of atmospheric O2. The oxygen evolution rate (RO2) and the maximum evolved oxygen (DO*) are reported in Fig. 6c. RO2 was calculated as the slope of the first stage of the increasing section of DO curves (10 min < t < 15 min), the values are plotted in Fig. 6c.

(a) Picture of the Clark-cell system in the lab and comparison of the (b) oxygen evolution curves of the pristine BiVO4 and impregnated with the different dyes and (c) the Clark-type cell parameters of the oxygen evolution rate (RO2) and maximum dissolved oxygen (DO*). 
It is worth noting that there is either no correlation between the DO* and the RO2, nor between the catalytic performance and the dye loading into the BiVO4, as it has been observed in previous works by using MnOx and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ for the OER, where a linearity between these parameters was found.50 This is an indication of the fact that each dye has a different interaction and effect on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface.
In addition, the experiments in the Clark reactor revealed that, although the RO2 of the BiVO4 does not show a particular improvement induced by any of the dyes, the BiVO4 + dye 3 sample exhibits the maximum oxygen production. It was even 75% higher than the bare BiVO4, whereas the DO* obtained by the impregnation of dyes 1, 2 and 4 remained lower than that of bare BiVO4. This result agrees with the UV-Vis spectrum of dye 3 (Fig. 4b), which showed that the dye impregnated powder can absorb in the visible region but without reducing the absorbance in the UV region, which could mean that the light harvesting of BiVO4 is not blocked by the dye. In contrast to the BiVO4 samples containing dyes 2 and 4, which also showed an increased UV and Vis light absorption, respectively, but poorer reaction performances, dye 3 seems to have better electronic interactions with BiVO4, which is reflected by a higher total oxygen production.
3.4 Energy levels of NDIs and the water oxidation mechanism of the BiVO4 + dye powder photocatalyst
To better understand the interaction between BiVO4 and the different dyes, the energy levels of HOMO and LUMO of dyes 1–4 were calculated and compared with the energy levels of BiVO4 and the water splitting reaction. The values of the energy levels were determined by two methods, experimentally and theoretically, the latter by means of DFT calculations (see section 2.7).

Table 2 compares the energy of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals determined experimentally and computationally through two different non-hybrid DFT functionals (BP86 and PBE), which were shown to be relatively accurate for predicting HOMO–LUMO gaps.51

The experimental and computed energies of the HOMO follow the same trend: dye 1 ≪ dye 2 < dye 4 < dye 3. The computed absolute values are qualitatively, if not quantitatively, close to the experimental ones, mutually supporting both methodologies (see Table 2). The largest discrepancy between the experimental and calculations appears for the LUMO energy of dye 1, which is the lowest among the series of dyes according to DFT methods, following the same trend as the HOMO energies, but it is one of the highest according to the experimental method. Apart from this case, the calculated LUMO levels are in rather good agreement with experimental values obtained with the experimental method. It is important to note that time-independent quantum methods were found to give a poorer description of unoccupied than occupied orbitals.51

Fig. 7 depicts the DFT computed frontier molecular orbitals and their respective position with respect to BiVO4 and the water splitting reaction by using the average value between the BP86 level and experimental data (see Table S1, ESI†). Within the series of studied dyes, the addition of electron-donating substituents to the naphthalene core in dyes 2–4 destabilizes significantly the energy of the HOMO with respect to dye 1. For dyes 2–4, the HOMO is delocalized over the 4-ring core forming π-antibonding interactions with the electron-donating substituents, whereas in dye 1 the HOMO is delocalized over the two pyridine substituents. Roughly, the energy of the HOMO (dye 1 ≪ dye 2 < dye 4 < dye 3) correlates with the donor ability of the corresponding dye substituents (H < Br < N(H)ArCOOH < NMe2). DFT calculations show the same destabilization trend for the LUMO energies. However, the energy of the LUMO is less altered, and consequently, the energy gaps for the dyes with electron-donating substituents (dyes 2–4) are significantly narrower than for dye 1. This trend is also observed for experimental energy gap values despite the above mentioned discrepancy in the LUMO energies for dye 1.
 Fig. 7  Energy levels of the different dyes and BiVO4, including BP86 isodensity surfaces for the computed HOMO and LUMO of the different dyes. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity. 
In order to establish if dyes 1–4 work as sensitizers, some physical requirements have to be satisfied. The electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor requires that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the dye is above that of the BiVO4 (i.e. its CB), and hole transfer from the acceptor to donor requires that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dye is above that of the BiVO4 (i.e. its VB), in order to fulfill the energy requirements and thus to generate the photocurrent. From Fig. 7 we can infer that dyes 1–4 fulfill those requisites.
A Z-scheme type photosystem, which has demonstrated enhanced photocatalyst performances by mimicking the natural photosynthesis in Photosystem II,52 is possible with the here presented dyes and could explain why the WO performance of the BiVO4 + dye 3 couple is better than that with the other dyes. As schematically depicted in Fig. 8a, the forward intramolecular and interfacial hole/electron transfer processes can be summarized as follows: (1) upon light irradiation the dye produces a long-lived charge separated excited state (dye + hν → dye*), which eventually could evolve to the minimum on the triplet potential energy surface, and it results in a photo-excited electron, dye(e−), and a hole, dye(h+); (2) the BiVO4 also absorbs radiation injecting an electron in the conduction band, BiVO4(e−), and generating a hole in the valence band, BiVO4(h+), which is able to oxidize water (BiVO4 + hν → BiVO4*); (3) electron–hole recombination to the excited dye in order to preserve the hole in the BiVO4, so that it can act as a water oxidation catalyst (BiVO4* + dye(h+) → BiVO4(h+) + dye(e−)); (4) electron injection into the electron acceptor (AgNO3 salt) or into the conduction band of the semiconductor oxide (dye(e−) + Ag+ → dye + Ag0, or dye(e−) + BiVO4 → dye + BiVO4(e−)). The non-optimal performance of the overall process can be attributed to the radiative and non-radiative recombination within the BiVO4 oxide (3′ in Fig. 8a). However, the presence of the dye can hinder the electron–hole recombination within the BiVO4 oxide by accepting the photo-excited electron of BiVO4 in the hole produced in the dye HOMO after its photo-excitation. This process is likely to be maximized when the conduction band of the oxide and the HOMO of the dye are close in energy. Thus, since dye 3 has the strongest e-donor substituent (NMe2) in the naphthalene core which destabilizes significantly the energy of the HOMO, it shows the lowest differences between HOMO and CB energy levels. Therefore, a better electron transfer with BiVO4 with respect to the other dyes is allowed, which could explain the better performances obtained with the BiVO4 + dye 3 in the Clark-reactor experiments.

(b) Combined mechanism of charge generation, separation and reaction in the overall water splitting photoelectrochemical cell exploiting the BiVO4 + dye 3 photoanode. 
From Fig. 7 it can also be noticed that hole transfer from BiVO4 to dye 3 cannot cause the water splitting reaction on the surface of the dye, because the energetic level of holes in the HOMO of dye 3 is not oxidizing enough to induce e-transfer from the water to that dye, with a consequent impossibility to achieve water splitting and O2 evolution. In order to better clarify the actual mechanism of charge transfer and the real possibility to implement the here developed dyes in a photoelectrochemical device, the PEC behavior of the most promising dye 3 coupled with a BiVO4 photo-electrode has been evaluated, and the results are presented in the next section 3.5.
3.5 Photoelectrochemical application of the NDI dye 3-anchored BiVO4 film
In order to assess the possible practical application and stability of the NDIs as well as to confirm the capability of the best NDI dye to enhance the reaction kinetics, the performance of a BiVO4 + dye 3 film was evaluated and compared to that of bare BiVO4 for the overall water splitting reaction. The PEC cell contained a 0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). From both chopped and continuous light LSV scans (Fig. 9a), a gradual increase of the photocurrent under simulated sunlight irradiation (100 mW cm−2) is observed for both samples, with an onset potential at about 0.6 VRHE. A reduction of the theoretical redox potential for water oxidation (E° = 1.23 VRHE) indicates that part of the energy required for the reaction is provided by the simulated sunlight.
 Fig. 9  Photoelectrochemical characterization for the samples: BiVO4 film (yellow line) and BiVO4 film impregnated with dye 3 (blue line). (a) LSV curves under chopped and continuous (inset) visible light irradiation and (b) ca. curves under chopped visible light irradiation at a constant applied potential of 1.23 VRHE. Active area of the photoanodes: 6 cm2. 
The quite low photocurrent density (at 1.23 VRHE) of the BiVO4 film (∼0.03 mA cm−2) is in agreement with previous data in the literature for high area electrodes such as the ones employed here (2 × 3 cm2).6 Nonetheless, the implementation of the here developed dye 3 over a broad electrode surface was consciously made to test a system closer to a practical case. As noticed from Fig. 9, the generated photocurrent varies considerably between the bare and impregnated BiVO4 films. The BiVO4 + dye 3 film shows a photocurrent of 0.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which corresponds to more than ten-fold the photocurrent generated with the bare BiVO4. In addition, the photocurrent of the BiVO4 + dye 3 film does not arrive to a plateau, such as the bare BiVO4 does, but shows a continuous increment by increasing the potential, reaching up to 0.53 mA cm−2 at 1.6 VRHE.

Fig. 9b shows the photocurrent density stability of the studied photo-anodes as a function of time. To perform this, the samples were illuminated in cycles of two minutes of darkness and simulated solar light irradiation. The photocurrent shows an instantaneous increment when the irradiation begins, then shows a slight decrease and stabilizes to a steady state condition after a few seconds. The BiVO4 + dye 3 film shows a more pronounced spike with respect to the bare BiVO4, showing a slightly lower photocurrent than the LSV curves. This is commonly observed because in chopped LSVs the irradiation time is too short for the sample to reach the steady state conditions as well as the continuous increase of the applied potential induces a faster e− transport in LSVs than in CAs. However, the enhancement in the photocurrent due to dye 3 impregnation is in agreement with the LSV results. It is important to notice that the photocurrent decreased quickly down to zero when the light is turned off, confirming the effective photocatalytic (and not only catalytic) activity of both the studied films.
In order to identify the portion of the solar spectrum that is actually working in the BiVO4 + dye 3 film in comparison with the bare BiVO4 film, the photo-response of the different photo-anodes has been evaluated through IPCE spectra at an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE (Fig. 10a). IPCE curves revealed that both BiVO4 and BiVO4 + dye 3 have a relevant efficiency in the UV-Vis region of sunlight up to a maximum of 500 nm. The maximum IPCE was obtained at 320 nm for both samples and is about 28% and 49% for the pristine BiVO4 and the dye 3-impregnated film, respectively. Hence, there was no evidence of an increase of the action spectra of BiVO4 in the visible range due to the presence of the dye, which is actually in agreement with the previous discussion related to the position of the HOMO level of this dye and the inability to achieve water oxidation by the holes on its surface. Nevertheless, the enhanced activity of the BiVO4 + dye 3 material is also confirmed by the IPCE measurements.
 Fig. 10  (a) IPCE spectra recorded by varying the wavelength of the incident light from 300 nm to 800 nm at an applied potential of 1.23 VRHE. (b) EIS Nyquist plots at different applied potentials under simulated sunlight irradiation. Legend: BiVO4 (yellow line and symbols) and BiVO4 + dye 3 (blue line and symbols). 
The better feature of the dye 3 impregnated film could be explained by the different transport properties of such an electrode, which can be observed from the Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements under simulated sunlight illumination reported in Fig. 10b. The smaller impedance values reported by the BiVO4 + dye 3 film than by the bare BiVO4, at the different applied potentials, indicate a faster electron transfer (higher reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface) by reducing e−/h+ recombinations on the BiVO4 surface.6,53,54 For instance, at 1.23 VRHE the charge transfer resistance of the BiVO4 + dye 3 film (∼136 Ω) is less than half of that of the bare BiVO4 (∼300 Ω).
The mechanism of improvement of charge transfer on the surface of BiVO4 by dye 3 can be explained through two phenomena. Other than the previously explained Z-scheme that is possible between the BiVO4 and dye 3, dye 3 could also act as an enhancer of electron mobility and, consequently, of charge separation and photocurrent generation by a higher availability of holes on the BiVO4 surface able to react with water. The latter phenomenon is similar to that previously observed for BiVO4 films with reduced graphene oxide55 or in TiO2 porous films impregnated with a conductive polymer (i.e. polyaniline).29 In the present case, the unique characteristic provided by the aromatic diimide moiety (i.e. NDI) and the core-substituted derivatives, which have been already exploited as electron-acceptor moieties in artificial light-harvesting systems such as dye sensitized solar cells, is responsible for the semiconducting property of dye 3.56 Indeed, the planar geometry of NDIs and their low reduction potential have been reported to provide a large driving force for the charge separation process,56,57 since NDIs can be reversibly reduced to stable radical anions, under mild conditions.
The possible mechanism by which dye 3 improves the photo-electrocatalytic activity of BiVO4 under sunlight irradiation is schematized in Fig. 8b. When the BiVO4 + dye 3 heterostructure is irradiated by UV-Vis light, dye 3 absorbs photons and electrons in the HOMO can be excited to the LUMO. In the same manner, BiVO4 absorbs UV-Vis photons and electrons in the BiVO4 VB can be excited to its CB, thereby leaving holes at its surface capable of splitting water to O2. Then, through the Z-scheme process, electrons in the CB of BiVO4 can be injected in the HOMO of dye 3, because they are at a higher energy level than the BiVO4 VB; otherwise, electrons in the dye 3 LUMO can be injected into the BiVO4 CB and then, due to the electromagnetic forces induced by the applied bias, be injected into the FTO conductive substrate. These processes are beneficial for an efficient charge carrier separation because they induce an increased electron mobility and transport in the BiVO4 CB.29,56 Hence, dye 3 likely hinders the recombination of the e−/h+ pairs and lengthens the lifetime of the charge carriers, consequently improving the charge separation and photocatalytic activity of the BiVO4 photocatalyst. Thus, the fast transferred electrons into the FTO conductive substrate are then conducted through the external electrical circuit to the Pt cathode where the H2 evolution reaction takes place.
4. Conclusions
In this work, a new series of core-substituted NDIs were designed, with the aim of obtaining tunable absorption properties that overlap with all of the solar spectrum and bearing appropriate functionalities to provide an efficient and stable linkage on the surface of the BiVO4 water-splitting photocatalyst. Four different molecules were successfully synthesized achieving excellent yields (∼69% for dye 1 absorbing UV-light; and >93% for dyes 2 to 4 absorbing visible light) as it was confirmed by NMR, FT-IR and GC-MS analyses. The surface functionalization of BiVO4 has been accomplished by an easy and low-cost room temperature dip-coating technique. The successful anchoring, as well as the stability of the photocatalyst–dye interactions, have been successfully confirmed by TGA, FT-IR, XRD, XPS and optical analysis.
The diversely sensitized BiVO4 samples were tested for the photocatalytic oxygen evolution process under simulated sunlight conditions by employing two different systems: a Clark-type reactor with a sacrificial e− acceptor (AgNO3) and a photoelectrochemical water splitting cell. The optimum dye-sensitized catalytic system was proven to be that including dye 3 on BiVO4, which provided a remarkable enhancement in the O2 evolution from both quantitative and kinetic points of view, confirming the effectiveness of the catalytic system here designed. The superior activity of the BiVO4 + dye 3 system has been ascribed to two phenomena: first, a Z-scheme4,58,59 mechanistic approach is possible due to the right position HOMO and LUMO energy levels of dye 3 with respect to those of the BiVO4 (i.e. CB and VB), as determined by DFT calculations and experimental data; moreover, we considered that the ability of the here developed organic dyes to delocalize the electronic charge and enhance electrons transport towards the FTO substrate could be an additional key factor that minimizes recombination processes in the BiVO4 + dye 3 water oxidation photoanode. The here proposed approach opens new perspectives in the investigation of a different series of dye molecules (namely, NDIs) that are low-cost, because they do not contain expensive noble metals, and are able to improve the activity of photocatalysts for different sunlight driven applications, such as waste water treatment and organic contaminant degradation, other than the production of solar fuels by water splitting mechanisms.
