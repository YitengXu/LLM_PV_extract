    , Accepted 13th July 2012First published on 16th July 2012AbstractNitrogen-doped mesoporous nanohybrids of TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets have been successfully synthesized by first exfoliating layered HTiNbO5 in tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) to obtain HTiNbO5 nanosheets, then reassembling with TiO2 colloids and finally heating with urea in air at 450 °C. The resulting samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) and N2 adsorption–desorption measurements. It was found that the TiO2 nanoparticles existed in the anatase phase and the titanoniobate nanosheets were still maintained after nitrogen doping. The obtained nitrogen-doped nanohybrids showed a greatly expanded surface area with a mesoporous structure and the doped nitrogen atoms were located in the interstitial sites of TiO2, giving rise to the visible light response. The catalytic activities of the obtained samples were evaluated by the photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible light irradiation. The obtained N-doped nanohybrid had a higher activity than N-doped HTiNbO5 nanosheets and N-doped TiO2, indicating the synergetic effect of TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets. The dye molecules were mainly degraded to aliphatic organic compounds and mostly further mineralized to CO2 and/or CO, rather than being simply decolorized. In addition, the cell viability results of the HepG2 cells showed that the as-prepared sample had a good biocompatibility.
1. Introduction
Decolorization of dye effluents has received increasing attention.1 For the removal of dye pollutants, traditional physical techniques such as adsorption on activated carbon, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, coagulation by chemical agents, ion exchange on synthetic adsorbent resins, etc. can generally be used efficiently. Nevertheless, they are non-destructive, since they just transfer the organic compounds from water to another phase, thus causing secondary pollution.2 Due to the large amount of aromatics present in dye molecules and the stability of modern dyes, conventional biological treatment methods are ineffective for decolorization and degradation.3 Photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds on semiconductor surfaces is an important area of current research with respect to both the fundamental understanding and potential practical applications.4 As one of the most promising photocatalysts, TiO2 is one of the most widely investigated photocatalysts because of its exceptional optical and electronic properties, strong oxidizing power, nontoxicity, chemical stability and low cost.5–10 However, the practical applications are greatly restricted due to two bottlenecks which greatly reduce process efficiency, i.e., the narrow light-response range and low separation probability of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Considering the relatively slow reaction rate and poor solar efficiency of TiO2 much effort has been devoted to exploit new visible light-driven photocatalysts.11–15
Layered compounds have attracted much attention due to a wide variety of structural and electronic properties.16–20 Cation-exchangeable layered transition-metal oxides are typically synthesized as alkaline metal-containing layered oxides, consisting of polyanion sheets of transition-metal oxides with intercalated alkaline metal cations. The sheets of the material often exhibit electric conductivity and photo responses based on bandgap transitions. These types of layered oxides have actually been applied as photocatalysts.21–23 However, due to the fact that the layered transition metal oxides are usually nonporous and have a very small specific surface area, their photocatalytic activities are relatively low.
The delamination of layered compounds is attracting increasing attention, opening up new fields in the science and technology of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials. The resulted semiconducting metal oxide nanosheets derived from the exfoliation of layered compounds can be considered as a new class of nanostructured materials due to their unique structural feature of ultimate two-dimensional anisotropy with an extremely small thickness of subnano- to nanometer scale.24–27 The colloidal nanosheets can also be used as building blocks for the development of new materials with a long range controlled structure, and then self-assembly into nanostructured mesoporous solids.28 It has been suggested that the nanohybridization between nanoparticles and inorganic nanosheets can not only give rise to the mesoporous structure with a large surface area, but also can improve the separation probability of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs.29–32 Nonetheless, the formed nanohybrid usually has a relatively wide bandgap and is thus active only under UV light. Since UV light only accounts for ca. 4% of the solar energy spectrum while visible light occupies 46% of the spectrum, it is of great significance to design efficient mesoporous nanohybrid photocatalysts that can be used for the degradation of harmful organic compounds under visible-light irradiation. Great efforts have been made to improve the visible-light photocatalytic activity of such mesoporous nanohybrids by impurity doping.33–35 Recently, it was found that the doping of nitrogen can shift the optical absorption edge of the semiconductor to a lower energy, and thus giving rise to the visible light response.36,37
In this work, novel N-doped mesoporous nanohybrids of TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets with a large specific surface area and visible light response was successfully synthesized by first exfoliating layered HTiNbO5, then reassembling with TiO2 colloids and finally heating with urea as the nitrogen source. A detailed characterization was carried out, and the catalytic activities of the visible-light photodegradation of RhB and the biocompatibility of the obtained nanohybrids were investigated. In addition, the photocatalytic mechanism was briefly discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the photocatalysts
The host layered potassium titanoniobate, KTiNbO5, was prepared by heating a stoichiometric mixture of K2CO3, Nb2O5 and TiO2 (these three chemicals were purchased from Nanjing WanQing chemical LTD. CO.) at 1100 °C for 24 h. The corresponding protonic form, HTiNbO5, was obtained by reacting KTiNbO5 powder with 5 M HNO3 aqueous solution at room temperature for 3 days. During the proton exchange reaction, the acid solution was replaced with a fresh one every 24 h.38
To prepare HTiNbO5 nanosheets, first, 1.0 g HTiNbO5 was added to 100 mL distilled water and then 15 wt% tetra(n-buthylammonium) hydroxide (TBA+OH−) solution was slowly added to the suspension until the pH reached 9.5–10.0, and the resulting solution was shaken for 7 days. After the reaction, the supernatant solution containing nanosheets was then collected by means of a high-speed centrifugation (9000 rpm for 8 min).39
The TiO2 colloidal solution was prepared as follows: first, under a stream of dry nitrogen, 62.5 mL of Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 (Nanjing WanQing chemical LTD. CO.) was mixed with 10 mL of 2-propanol, then the resulting mixture was slowly added to 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution under vigorous stirring and peptized at 80 °C for 8 h to obtain the TiO2 colloidal solution.
The nanohybrid of TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets was prepared by the dropwise addition of the TiO2 colloidal solution into the colloidal suspension of exfoliated HTiNbO5 nanosheets under vigorous stirring. After the reaction, the product was washed thoroughly with distilled water and dried at 70 °C overnight (denoted as TTN hereafter). The obtained sample (TTN) after heat treatment in air at 450 °C is denoted as TTN-450 hereafter.
To prepare nitrogen-doped nanohybrid materials, the obtained TTN (1 g) was finely milled with urea (2 g), and then the resulting mechanical mixture was heated in air at 450 °C for 2 h. After thermal treatment, the solid product was crushed, washed well with 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution and distilled water to remove likely residual nitrogen precursors and finally dried at 70 °C overnight. The obtained sample was denoted as NTTN-450.
To prepare N-doped HTiNbO5 nanosheets, the H+-restacked HTiNbO5 nanosheets (1 g) were finely milled with urea (2 g), and then the resulting mixture was heated in air at 400 °C for 2 h. After thermal treatment, the solid product was crushed, washed well with 0.1 mol L−1 HNO3 aqueous solution and distilled water to remove likely residual nitrogen precursors, and finally dried at 70 °C overnight. For comparison, N-doped HTiNbO5 was also prepared by using the same doping method, only replacing H+-restacked HTiNbO5 nanosheets with the original HTiNbO5 as the starting material.
To prepare TiO2, under vigorous stirring, an appropriate amount of 2 mol L−1 NH3·H2O was added dropwise into the TiO2 colloidal solution until the pH value was higher than 9.0. The resulted precipitate was separated by means of high-speed centrifugation and then dried at 70 °C to obtain the TiO2 precursor. A further calcination of the TiO2 precursor at 450 °C in air for 4 h gave rise to TiO2. To prepare N-doped TiO2, the obtained TiO2 precursor (1 g) was finely milled with urea (2 g), and then the resulting mechanical mixture was heated in air at 450 °C for 2 h. After thermal treatment, the solid product was crushed, washed well with 0.1 M HNO3 aqueous solution and distilled water to remove likely residual nitrogen precursors, and finally dried at 70 °C overnight (denoted as N–TiO2 hereafter).
2.2 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the obtained samples were taken on a Philip-X'Pert X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and Ni filter at a scanning rate of 0.2° s−1 in a 2θ range of 5–60°. The morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JEM-6300F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM JEOL JEM-200CX, operation at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV). For TEM observation, the samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic treatment and dropped on carbon-copper grids. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis was carried out on a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC, K-Alpha) equipped with a hemispherical electron analyzer (pass energy of 20 eV) and a Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The binding energies (BE) were referenced to the adventitious C 1s peak (284.6 eV) which was used as an internal standard to take into account charging effects. A combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions was used to fit the curve. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curve were obtained from N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms determined at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. Samples were degassed at 573 K for 5 h prior to the measurement. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2401) using BaSO4 as reference. Laser Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw Invia System equipped with a confocal microscope. An exciting line at 514.5 nm was focused using a 50× objective lens. The laser power at the samples was 20 mW.
2.3 Photocatalytic test
For the evaluation of photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation, 0.1 g of catalyst was suspended in 100 mL of RhB aqueous solution (1 × 10−5 M) in a beaker. A Xe lamp (300 W) equipped with a cut-off filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. Before the light was turned on, the suspension was magnetically stirred well in the dark for more than 40 min until an adsorption–desorption equilibrium was finally established. When the light was turned on, at given time intervals, approximately 3 mL of the reaction suspension was sampled and separated by means of high-speed centrifugation. The absorption spectrum of the filtrate was measured on a UV-visible spectrometer, and the concentration of RhB was determined by monitoring the change in the absorbance maximized at ∼554 nm.
The degree of mineralization was followed by measuring the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the degraded solution, which was carried out on a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu, model TOC-VCSH) operated at a furnace temperature of 680 °C and a sample injection of 80 μL according to the standard method.40
2.4 MTT proliferation assay
HepG2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640) medium supplemented with 10% freshly inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and were seeded equivalently into a 96-well plate; the concentration of drugs (TTN and NTTN-450) was 40 μg mL−1. The plates were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and incubated for 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively, then MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenytetrazolium bromide) solution of an appropriate concentration (1 mg mL−1) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The measurements of absorbance of the solutions related to the number of live cells were performed on an ELISA spectrophotometer at 570 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD analysis
The layered structure and crystallinity of the resulting samples were first characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern of the as-prepared layered HTiNbO5 matches well with the published data (PDF, # 75-2062). According to the position of the characteristic (002) reflection of the layered structure, the interlayer distance of HTiNbO5 is calculated to be 8.3 Å.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of (a) HTiNbO5, (b) TTN (c) TTN-450, and (d) NTTN-450. 
Upon reaction of the exfoliated titanoniobate with TiO2 nano-sol, the characteristic (002) diffraction peak is shifted to a lower angle (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the TiO2 nano-sol was stabilized in the interlayer space of layered titanoniobate and the as-prepared nanohybrid has a relatively larger interlayer spacing of 10.2 Å. Nevertheless, due to the exfoliation and hybridization, the nanosheets were stacked in a relatively disordered way and thus the characteristic (002) diffraction peak is broader in TTN. Meanwhile, the (004) and (008) diffraction peaks of the obtained nanohybrid (TTN) completely disappeared, indicating a much poorer periodic layered structure than the original HTiNbO5.41
After heat treatment in air at 450 °C, the (002) diffraction peak of TTN completely disappeared, indicating the collapse of the layered structure (shown in Fig. 1c). Although other characteristic diffraction peaks of HTiNbO5 are not obviously observed, it doesn't mean that the layered titanoniobate decomposed into bulk TiO2 and Nb2O5 phases, as this will be further confirmed by HRTEM. In addition, a new diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 25.3° appears. This peak can be attributed to the (101) reflection of anatase.29 Using the Debye–Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of TiO2 particles in the resulting nanohybrid is calculated to be 6.4 nm.
When TTN is heated with urea at 450 °C in air, the resulting sample NTTN-450 has almost the same characteristic diffraction peaks as TTN-450. Nevertheless, the TiO2 particles in NTTN-450 have an even smaller average diameter of 5.8 nm than those in TTN-450, indicating that the introduction of urea during the heat treatment can slightly reduce the diameter of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Being similar to the case in TTN-450, TiO2 particles still existed in the anatase phase in NTTN-450, which can be further confirmed by the Raman characterization.
3.2 Laser Raman spectroscopy
Laser Raman spectroscopy is considered to be a powerful technique for the investigation of various phases of titanium dioxide.42 This technique is capable of elucidating the photocatalyst structural complexity as peaks from each material are clearly separated in frequency, and therefore, the phases are easily distinguishable. As shown in Fig. 2a, the four characteristic Raman bands observed in TTN-450 at 150.1, 394.0, 515.4 and 636.4 cm−1 can be attributed to the anatase phase with the symmetries of Eg, B1g, A1g and Eg, respectively.43 Meanwhile, the characteristic Raman bands of the rutile phase are completely absent.44 Similarly, the Raman spectrum of NTTN-450 is also related to the crystalline structure of the anatase phase (Fig. 2b). By comparison, the position of the Raman bands of NTTN-450 has a slight change, which may be attributed to the nitrogen doping. Combined with the above-mentioned XRD results, it can be concluded that the TiO2 nanoparticles existed as the anatase phase in the resulting nanohybrids.

3.3 Morphology

Fig. 3 shows the representative SEM and TEM images of layered HTiNbO5 and NTTN-450. As shown in Fig. 3a, the layered structure of the as-prepared HTiNbO5 is clearly visible, a number of micron-sized lamellar plates are closely and regularly stacked together along the (00l) direction, leading to the formation of a highly ordered layered structure.

As shown in Fig. 3b, the TEM image of NTTN-450 confirms the formation of the hybridization structure upon the reaction between the TiO2 nanoparticles and titanoniobate nanosheets. It is quite clear that the loosely packed TiO2 nanoparticles were randomly hybridized with the exfoliated titanoniobate nanosheets and thus in such a way the mesoporous hybrid was formed. The average size of the TiO2 nanoparticles was observed to be ∼6 nm, which is in good agreement with that determined by XRD analysis using the Scherrer equation.
A HRTEM image (Fig. 3c) reveals that the resulting nanohybrid NTTN-450 exhibits lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.233, 0.256, 0.293 and 0.327 nm, corresponding to the (115), (106), (113) and (200) planes of TiNbO5− nanosheets, respectively. Meanwhile, the lattice fringe image corresponding to the (002) plane is absent, suggesting the collapse of the layered structure. It is consistent with XRD results above. As shown in the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3d), diffraction spots with d values of 0.293, 0.188 and 0.256 nm are observed. These diffraction spots correspond to the (113), (020) and (106) planes of the TiNbO5− nanosheets, respectively. This could be regarded as proof for the maintenance of individual titanoniobate nanosheets after hybridization. Fig. 3e–i show the EDS mappings of NTTN-450, confirming that nitrogen ions are homogeneously distributed in the nanohybrid. Thus, combined with XRD and LRS results, it can be concluded that the obtained materials were composed of titanoniobate nanosheets and TiO2 nanoparticles.
3.4 Specific surface area and porosity
The surface area and pore structure upon hybridization and post-calcination were investigated by using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurements. As shown in Fig. 4, the as-prepared nanohybrid TTN presents a BDDT type IV shape of isotherm, along with a H2-type hysteresis loop according to IUPAC classification, suggesting a mesoporous structure.45 It is reported that isotherms with type H2 loops are typical for those materials with relatively uniform channel-like pores.46 After heat treatment with or without urea at 450 °C, the resulting samples (TTN-450 and NTTN-450) also show a BDDT IV shape of isotherm which is indicative of a typical mesoporous solid. However, the mesoporous TTN-450 and NTTN-450 show the type H3 hysteresis loop as in the IUPAC classification, suggesting that the materials are comprised of aggregates (loose assemblages) of plate-like particles forming slit-like pores.46 Moreover, all the nanohybrids displayed only a weak adsorption of N2 molecules in a low-pressure (p/p0) region, implying that micropores made little contribution to the nitrogen adsorption.35
 Fig. 4  N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the resulting nanohybrids. 
As shown in Table 1, the BET specific surface area of HTiNbO5 increases drastically upon hybridization. The BET specific surface area of the original HTiNbO5 was only 3.5 m2 g−1, while that of TTN was 231.4 m2 g−1. The post-calcination at 450 °C caused a decrease in the surface area to some extent. Nevertheless, the resulting two samples (TTN-450 and NTTN-450) still had a very high BET surface area of 139.7 m2 g−1 and 150.4 m2 g−1, respectively. It is worth noting that NTTN-450 had a larger relative surface area than TTN-450, indicating that the adding of urea during the heat-treatment can effectively reduce the loss of specific surface area. By comparison, both TiO2 and N–TiO2 showed a much lower specific surface area (40.8 m2 g−1 and 82.9 m2 g−1, respectively). Thus, it can be suggested that the hybridization can efficiently enhance the specific surface area of the obtained samples, and may further improve the photocatalytic performance.

The pore size distribution was analyzed from the desorption branch data based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. As shown in Fig. 5, TTN shows a sharp peak at a pore diameter of 3.7 nm, suggesting a very narrow distribution of the mesopore dimensions. Judging from the pore size and basal spacing of the as-prepared nanohybrid, the observed mesopores should originate from the stacking structure of the nanohybrid crystallites, rather than the intercalation structure. After heat treatment with or without urea at 450 °C, the resulting two samples presented a much broader pore-size distribution, and the corresponding average pore-sizes were 7.20 nm and 6.82 nm, respectively. The formation of the mesopores is ascribed to the destruction of the layered structure and stacking structure of the TiO2 nanoparticles with titanoniobate nanosheets. Thus, it can be concluded that the as-prepared samples have a greatly expanded surface area with a mesoporous structure and are expected to be a promising candidate showing a higher photocatalytic performance for the degradation of organic pollutants.

3.5 TG-DTA analysis
As shown in Fig. 6, the TG-DTA curves for the as-prepared TTN can be divided into two temperature domains. The first weight loss below 150 °C is mostly due to water evaporation from the nanohybrid, which is supported by the observation of an endothermic DTA peak. The second weight loss occurring within 150–450 °C is related to the decomposition of the residual organic groups in the interlayer space of the nanohybrid, which is supported by the appearance of a sharp exothermic DTA peak.

3.6 XPS studies
To investigate the chemical states of the nitrogen atoms incorporated into the resulting nanohybrid, the N 1s binding energy was measured by XPS. Fig. 7a presents the typical N 1s peak of the sample NTTN-450. The amount of nitrogen dopant was estimated to be ca. 2.1 at% in NTTN-450. It can be seen that there is a broad peak from 398 to 402 eV, which is in the range observed by several other researchers and is typical of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide.47,48 It can be speculated that the nitrogen atoms were incorporated into the TiO2 nanoparticles rather than titanoniobate nanosheets. After the fitting of the curve, two nitrogen components with N 1s binding energy at 399.6 and 400.3 eV can be resolved. According to the recent literature,49 the N 1s feature at 399.6 eV could be assigned to the N species located in an interstitial site in TiO2, while that at 400.3 eV could have arisen from the adsorbed N2 (γ-N2), NH4+, or NO.50 According to the preparation method in this work, the N 1s peak at 400.3 eV can be assigned to the adsorbed NH4+.
 Fig. 7  XPS spectra of NTTN-450. (a) N 1s spectrum, (b) Ti 2p spectra, and (c) Nb 3d spectra. 
As shown in Fig. 7b, in the case of the N-doped nanohybrid, the corresponding Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks are centered at approximately 458.7 and 464.6 eV, respectively, which are quite similar to those in HTiNbO5 and Ti(IV) in titanium oxide, and thus can be assigned to the octahedrally coordinated Ti by oxygen. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 7c, the two peaks of Nb 3d in NTTN-450 centered at ∼207.3 eV and 210.0 eV are similar to those in pure HTiNbO5. These results indicate that both the Ti and Nb are chemically bound to oxygen rather than nitrogen. Hence, it can be suggested that both Ti and Nb are not modified by N-doping and the doped nitrogen atoms are probably in the interstitial sites of the TiO2.
3.7 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra

Fig. 8 shows the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the original HTiNbO5 and the resulting nanohybrids. For comparison, those of TiO2 and N–TiO2 are also included. Only a strong absorption band in the UV region, which is attributed to the band-to-band transition, is observed for the layered HTiNbO5. By comparison, TTN has a much stronger relative absorption in UV region after hybridization. After calcination in air at 450 °C, the absorption edge of TTN-450 has a red shift to some extent compared with TTN. According to the position of the absorption edge, it can be seen that the bandgap energy (Eg) of TTN-450 is red shifted relative to that of HTiNbO5, but blue shifted to that of the TiO2 nanoparticles. This might be attributed to the formation of bonds between the anatase TiO2 nanoparticles and the titanoniobate nanosheets via hybridization.
 Fig. 8  UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of HTiNbO5, TiO2, TTN and its derivatives. 
After N-doping, the sample NTTN-450 not only shows a significant absorption tail in the visible region between 400 and 700 nm, but also has a stronger absorption in the UV region than the corresponding undoped one, suggesting that nitrogen doping can enhance the absorption both in the UV and visible region. In addition, compared with N–TiO2, NTTN-450 has a stronger absorption both in the UV and visible light region, suggesting that the hybridization may improve the absorption in the UV and visible light region.
The absorption spectrum of NTTN-450 may further provide some information about the band structure of the sample.51,52 The first edge is related to the band structure of the original nanohybrid and the second edge extending into the visible region is related to the new band created by nitrogen doping. In this work, the chemical structure of NTTN-450 has been revealed from XPS spectra and an impurity energy level is formed within the band-gap of the nanohybrid due to the effect of nitrogen doping. It is estimated that the induced sub-band-gap excitation is attributed to an isolated N 2p state rather than the mixed states of N 2p and O 2p. Hence, the transition between the conduction band and these discrete energy levels of nanohybrid might result in the visible light absorption of NTTN-450.
Moreover, the visible light response behavior after N-doping is clearly evidenced from the apparent color change of the resulting samples from white to yellow.
3.8 Photocatalytic activities
The visible light photocatalytic activities of the obtained samples were evaluated by the degradation of RhB aqueous solution. The noncatalytic degradation of RhB in solution was monitored by the blank test (Fig. 9a). The self-degradation process is inactive under visible-light region irradiation, which is evidenced by the degradation of only ∼5% RhB after 120 min irradiation. As shown in Fig. 9b and d, there is a non-negligible reduction of RhB concentration in solution by HTiNbO5 and TTN-450, which is essentially due to the surface adsorption and self-photosensitized oxidation.

For comparison, N-doped TiO2 and HTiNbO5 nanosheets are also included as references. As shown in Fig. 9e and f, N-doped HTiNbO5 nanosheets have a better photocatalytic performance than N-doped TiO2, and this can be attributed to the unique two-dimensional nanosheet structure and considerably richer mesoporosity introduced by a relatively disordered arrangement of lamellar plates due to exfoliation.53 Compared with the N-doped TiO2 and HTiNbO5 nanosheets, NTTN-450 shows a much higher degradation rate of RhB. This can be attributed to three aspects. (1) The as-prepared sample has a larger specific surface area, which can provide a large number of catalytic active sites and adsorb more light, thus improving photocatalytic activity. (2) The mesoporous structure in NTTN-450 can be potentially beneficial for promoting the diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the photocatalytic activity by facilitating access to the reactive sites on the surface of the photocatalyst. (3) The hybridization of anatase nanoparticles with exfoliated titanoniobate nanosheets could facilitate the transfer of the photoinduced electrons, and thus lower the recombination rate of the h+/e− pair.54
The UV-vis spectral and color changes of the RhB aqueous solution as a function of visible light irradiation time in the presence of NTTN-450 is illustrated in Fig. 10. The main absorbance of the degraded solution was gradually shifted from 554 nm to shorter wavelengths as the irradiation time was increased and finally reached 496 nm, corresponding to the stepwise formation of a series of N-de-ethylated intermediates.55 Upon further irradiation, no wavelength shift was observed, and the intensity of the band at 496 nm was decreased, indicating that the de-ethylated products of RhB could further be photodegraded to small molecules. Since no new band appeared, the loss of absorbance can be mainly attributed to the degradation reaction. It is suggested that the whole conjugated chromophore structure of RhB undergoes a facile cleavage under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, the color of the suspension changed gradually from pink to colorless. In addition, for the photodegradation of RhB by NTTN-450, not only did the main absorbance in the visible region decrease dramatically upon irradiation, but the band intensities in the UV region also decreased with irradiation time. It is indicated that both the dye chromophore and aromatic ring have been destroyed, i.e., the dye molecules have been degraded instead of being simply decolorized.

The mineralization degree of the RhB dye was examined by the measurement of the decrease of TOC in the system. Fig. 11 shows the TOC changes during the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation in the presence of NTTN-450. It was found that the TOC value of the RhB solution was decreased by approximately 75% at a RhB conversion of 98%, indicating a high mineralization degree of RhB by NTTN-450. It further proves that the RhB is not simply decolorized but is effectively degraded. Hence, it can be suggested that RhB is mainly degraded to aliphatic organic compounds and mostly further mineralized to CO2 and/or CO.

3.9 Photocatalytic mechanism
Based on the above-mentioned results, the possible photocatalytic mechanism can be proposed and shown in Scheme 1. First, the e−/h+ pairs are created within NTTN-450 under visible light irradiation, then the electrons migrate from the conduction band of the TiO2 particles to the conduction band of HTiNbO5, and subsequently react with absorbed oxygen to produce oxidants such as ˙O2−, ˙OH and ˙OOH, which facilitate the separation of electron–hole pairs. Meanwhile, the formed holes can react with H2O and OH− to produce active hydroxyls. Finally, RhB molecules as well as the de-ethylated products are thus degraded by photogenerated oxidants (˙O2−, ˙OH and ˙OOH).

3.10 Biocompatibility study
Recently, it has been reported that semiconducting metal oxides have been widely used not only as photocatalysts, but also as fluorescence probes in biological detection.56–59

Fig. 12 shows the viabilities of HepG2 cells incubated respectively with HTiNbO5, TTN-450 and NTTN-450 nanohybrid for different times. It can be seen that the samples have a good biocompatibility, the NTTN-450 composite has almost the same good biocompatibility as HTiNbO5, and a better biocompatibility than the original undoped TTN-450, revealing that the obtained nanohybrid may be developed for a range of applications such as drug delivery and medical imaging etc.60

4. Conclusion
In this work, nitrogen-doped mesoporous nanohybrids of anatase nanoparticles and titanoniobate nanosheets were successfully synthesized through an exfoliation-reassemble-calcination method. Being greatly different from the original layered HTiNbO5 which was nonporous with a much lower surface area of 3.5 m2 g−1, the obtained nanohybrids were mesoporous with a highly expanded surface area of more than 150 m2 g−1. After nitrogen doping, the optical absorption shifted into the visible light range, and the doped nitrogen atoms were most likely located in the interstitial sites of TiO2, and this nitrogen state was responsible for the visible light response. Contrary to the insignificant activity of the host HTiNbO5 and TiO2, the resulting nitrogen-doped nanohybrid exhibited a very high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation. In addition, the photocatalytic performance of the resulting nanohybrid was even higher than the N-doped TiO2 and HTiNbO5 nanosheets, indicating a good synergistic effect between the TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets.
On the basis of the present experimental findings, it is clear that the reassembling reaction between anatase nanoparticles and exfoliated titanoniobate nanosheets, followed by nitrogen doping is a useful technique for synthesizing new types of mesoporous materials with a high visible-light photocatalytic activity. The advantages of the present method can be viewed in three respects. First, the hybridization between TiO2 nanoparticles and HTiNbO5 nanosheets not only leads to the formation of a nanohybrid with a much larger surface area and rich mesoporosity, but also facilitates the transfer of the photoinduced electrons, and thus lowers the recombination rate of the h+/e− pair. Second, the further doping by nitrogen not only gives rise to the visible light response, but also reduces the loss of surface area during the heat treatment. Third, the as-prepared catalyst has excellent cell viabilities, favoring application in biological and medical fields. This strategy can be applied to a large number of layered metal oxides that have the characteristics of intercalation and exfoliation, thus providing new opportunities for the fabrication of highly effective and potentially practical visible-light photocatalysts.
