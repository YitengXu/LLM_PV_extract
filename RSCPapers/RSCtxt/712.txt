    , Accepted 27th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractWe study the effect of organic cation-centered states in mixed organic–inorganic halide perovskites on the bandstructure and optical properties. Clusters of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and bromide (MAPbBr3) and of MAPbI3 (MAPbBr3) in which an organic cation was substituted with formamidinium (FA) and guanidinium (GA) are studied with density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory. This model permitted comparing bandstructure and optical properties with different organic cations computed with GGA and hybrid functionals. We find that while with MA and GA, cation-centered states are deep in the conduction band, with FA, organic cation-centered states are introduced within as little as 0.5 eV of the conduction band maximum, which are expected to influence electronic and optical properties of perovskites in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices. There is qualitative agreement between a GGA and a hybrid functional; however, the use of a hybrid functional leads to a slightly higher offset of the cation-centered states from the conduction band edge, a different order of electronic states, and much better localization of cation-centered states. Analysis of optical absorption spectra suggests that occupation by photoexcitation of FA-centered states and formation of transient formamidinium species is possible in both I and Br-based perovskites.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSC)1 are promising as they combine the advantages of high solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency and potentially inexpensive and scalable fabrication. With record power conversion efficiencies (PCE) now exceeding 23%,2 PSCs are serious contenders for alternatives to crystalline solar cells. The key active material in PSCs is the organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP), the most common being methylammonium (MA) lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3 (hereafter also called MAPI).3 Other perovskite materials – both hybrid and fully inorganic – are extensively researched, including mixed halide OIHPs4 and perovskites with reduced5,6 or no Pb content,7–17 the latter two classes of materials studied with the aim of improving the sustainability of the final devices. Furthermore, the interplay among different halides, together with that among different A-18 and B-site cations, i.e. the organic and the inorganic one, respectively,19 allow one to tune the bandgap, to control the phase, and to reduce hysteresis.20,21 Specifically, the choice of the organic cation such as formamidinium (FA) and guanidinium (GA), alloyed with pristine MA, can be used to control the bandgap,22 the cubic to tetragonal phase transition temperature,23 the carriers lifetime, and the stability.24–28 The large GA cation causes a significant lattice stress in bulk29 but can be employed at perovskite interfaces and at grain boundaries.30 OIHP-based light emitting diodes (PLED) have recently emerged as a new promising application of OIHPs.31–36 In PLED, high efficiency is achieved with OIHP other than MAPI; specifically, Br and FA-based OIHPs hold significant promise.37,38
A number of periodic (solid state) ab initio studies have appeared of electronic properties of OIHPs including those with different cations (organic or inorganic).3,39 Typically, properties following from bandstructure close to the conduction and valence band edges are explored, including the band gap, optical absorption around the optical band gap, and charge transport,40–43 rather than electronic states centered on organic cations, which are considered to be inside the conduction band (CB). It is known, for example, that MA-centered states are sufficiently deep inside the CB40 so that they are not expected to affect solar cell performance. The specific position of such states with respect to the CBM (CB minimum) depends on the specific organic cation. If it is not far from the band edge energetically, it may influence electronic and optical properties and ultimately PSC or PLED performance.
Even if recently, results based on hybrid functionals have appeared in literature, solid state calculations on organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have been typically limited to GGA (generalized gradient approximation, with and without the inclusion of relativistic effects) functionals.3,44–49 The use of more accurate hybrid functionals is much more computationally demanding and is often unfeasible. The use of GGA functionals, however, can lead, besides the well-known underestimation of the bandgap, to erroneous ordering or erroneous relative energies of electronic states.50,51 This is important for the present work which considers cation-centered states. We therefore used a nanoparticle model of the perovskite, which is more amenable to calculations using hybrid functionals. With it, we are able to compare band-structures and specifically the energies of cation-centered states with different organic cations (MA, FA, GA) as well as different halides (I, Br) between GGA and hybrid functionals, which provides additional insight into the degree of reliability of GGA for these systems.
Another consequence of using periodic calculations is the difficulty of computing the optical properties. In periodic calculations, the most practical approach is the dipole approximation to compute the complex dielectric constant (see ref. 52 and references therein). This simple approach can, however, lead to severe redshifts.53,54 Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)55,56 is not practical for periodic calculations but is so for cluster calculations. We therefore use TD-DFT in the present work to compute and compare optical properties computed with GGA and hybrid functionals and to assess the effect, if any, of cation-centered states for different organic cations as well as different halides, using a nanoparticle model. A small nanoparticle model is used to make the number of required excited states (hundreds) in TD-DFT calculations tractable. While the small nanoparticle used here for computational efficiency leads to an artificially large bandgap, it can still effectively serve for comparative calculations among cations and between functionals. The results therefore provide an alternative perspective on the effect of different organic cations in OIHPs used in solar cells.
2. Methods
Density functional theory (DFT)57,58 calculations were performed in Gaussian 0959 using the Lanl2dz60,61 basis and PBE62,63 and B3LYP64–67 functionals. Optical absorption spectra were computed with TD-DFT.55,56 500 lowest excited states were required to reach absorption energies of about 1.5 eV above the onset of absorption. All calculations were performed in vacuum and spin-restricted.
The nanoparticle models of the perovskite were taken from ref. 68 where they were optimized with the semi-empirical PM6 method.69 Those structures were used as initial guesses for optimization with DFT. Initial guesses for the MAPBr structures were obtained by replacing I with Br atoms. Most calculations were performed on the smaller nanoparticles shown in Fig. 1. We also performed selected calculations with a larger model (Pb27) also shown in Fig. 1. The fcc PbI/PbBr sub-lattice is iodine/bromine-terminated, and the number of organic cations is chosen to result in a neutral model. For example, the stoichiometry of the smaller MAPI particle is (CH3NH3)20Pb8I36 with formal oxidation states (CH3NH3)+, Pb2+, I−. One MA unit was replaced with a FA or GA cation as shown in Fig. 1 for the small nanoparticle; cations in the larger nanoparticle were substituted similarly. These substituted systems are referred to below as FA/MAPI (FA/MAPBr) and GA/MAPI, respectively.

3. Results
3.1. Substituted MAPI

3.1.1. Electronic structure. 
The partial densities of states (PDOS) of the small nanoparticles of MAPI and FA/MAPI, GA/MAPI computed with the PBE and B3LYP functionals are shown in Fig. 2. The bandgap is strongly overestimated vs. bulk perovskites due to nanosizing effects, as expected. Both the valence and the conduction band are composed of state centered on the PbI sub-lattice, in agreement with previous calculations.70 With all cations, B3LYP calculations not only result in a larger gap, as expected, they also lead to the cation-centered states being slightly (on the order of 0.2–0.3 eV) deeper in the conduction band. For MAPI, the organic cation-centered states are very deep inside the conduction bands (more than 2.5 eV above the bad edge with B3LYP) and are therefore not expected to play any significant role in light absorption and subsequent electronic processes. The presence of the larger FA and GA cations, however, leads to the appearance of lower-lying states in the CB. The GA-centered states remain deep inside the band, almost 2 eV (with B3LYP) above the CBM and are also not expected to lead to new electronic effects relevant for solar cell or PLED operations. The FA-centered states, however, are much closer in energy to the conduction band minimum, within less than 1 eV from it. They can well be excited during solar absorption and affect absorption and, if they are sufficiently long-lived, affect transport properties and stability of the material. They could also potentially effect LED operation if electrons are injected at a potential sufficiently offset from the CBM. Such states in close proximity to the CBM are expected to affect electronic and optical properties and thus are a potentially detrimental feature that needs to be taken into account in FA-containing OIHPs used in both LED71–73 and PV devices.74,75

The FA and GA components are magnified for visibility. The ordinate axis crosses the abscissa in the bandgap. The PDOS is Gaussian-broadened with FWHM (full width at half maximum) = 0.05 eV. 
To verify if the appearance of a small offset between the FA cation-centered state and the CBM is not an artifact of the very small size of the nanoparticle, we optimized and computed the PDOS of the larger FA/MAPI nanoparticle as well. The PDOS computed with the PBE and B3LYP functionals are shown in Fig. 3 together with those of the larger MAPI nanoparticle for comparison. One can see that the FA-centered state remains well within 1 eV of the CBM, with the first peak due to FA only about 0.5/0.6 eV above the CBM (with PBE/B3LYP, respectively).

The FA component is magnified for visibility. The ordinate axis crosses the abscissa in the bandgap. The PDOS is Gaussian-broadened with FWHM (full width at half maximum) = 0.05 eV. 
The FA-centered states’ orbitals are shown in Fig. 4 for the small nanoparticle. With the PBE functional, the FA-centered state is at −1.74 eV (vs. the LUMO i.e. the “band edge” at −2.43 eV and HOMO at −5.18 eV). It is LUMO+10. With the B3LYP functional, the FA-centered state is at −1.06 eV (vs. the LUMO at −1.96 eV and HOMO at −5.77 eV). It is LUMO+12. That is, not only is the energy of the cation-centered state higher vs. CBM, the order of the states is different when using a hybrid functional. The cation-centered states are also better localized with B3LYP, as expected. This behavior is qualitatively similar with the larger nanoparticle. The different ordering and localization of the states between PBE and B3LYP functionals can affect computed electronic properties, for example when using non-adiabatic electron dynamics where Kohn–Sham states form a basis.76,77 The offset of the FA-centered state from the CBM is affected by nanosizing, it is larger in the smaller nanoparticle by 0.2–0.3 eV vs. the larger NP. The offset in real materials could be therefore even smaller, and any effects of FA-centered states on electronic properties even more significant.

3.1.2. Optical absorption. 
Optical absorption spectra of the nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Even with the smaller nanoparticles, due to the large density of states, 500 states were required to get excitations of states about 1.5 eV above the CBM, making the calculations very CPU costly. We therefore computed the spectra of the smaller nanoparticles with both functionals, those of the larger nanoparticles with PBE, and only the larger nanoparticle of FA/MAPI (i.e. the one of most interest here) is computed with B3LYP. Also, due to an even larger density of states, the 500 states are only sufficient to model excitations of states up to about only 1 eV above the CBM in the larger nanoparticle. The spectra of the larger nanoparticle can thus be used to compare the effect of nanosizing on the onset of absorption. Due to nanosizing effects, the absorption offset is strongly blue-shifted for the smaller nanoparticles, less so for the larger NP.
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra computed with TD-DFT (500 lowest excited states) for the smaller (left) and larger nanoparticles of MAPI, FA/MAPI, and GA/MAPI (labelled as MA, FA, and GA, respectively), with PBE and B3LYP functionals. The spectra are Gaussian-broadened with 0.1 eV (half width half maximum). 
There are no major differences among spectra computed with and without FA and GA substitutions; this is expected, as a small fraction of MA units is substituted. What we are interested in in these spectra is whether the cation-centered states, and specifically the low-lying FA-centered states, contribute noticeably to absorption. There are no dominant transitions with a major contribution from FA-centered stated (shown in Fig. 4); this is expected as only one MA unit is replaced with FA. Several transitions with smaller oscillator strengths (on the order of 0.001 to 0.01) have contributions from such states on the order of dozens %, and there are a few moderately strong transitions which are dominated by the transitions to FA-centered states. These transitions are listed in Table 1 for transitions with oscillator strength exceeding 0.004 and with a percentage of FA-centered state contribution exceeding 9%, in the smaller FA/MAPI nanoparticle. We note that the majority of the 500 transitions have oscillator strengths not exceeding 0.005. With B3LYP, there are fewer transitions with significant contributions from FA-centered stated. This is a consequence of better state localization by a hybrid functional. Considering that only one FA unit is introduced, this is a non-negligible contribution to the spectrum. Optical excitations can therefore in principle lead to occupation of states shown in Fig. 4 and to formation of neutral transient formamidinium species.

3.2. Substituted MAPBr

3.2.1. Electronic structure. 
We also computed the electronic structure and optical properties of FA- and GA-substituted MAPBr, for the smaller nanoparticles. Partial densities of states are shown in Fig. 6. By and large, a similar picture is observed as with MAPI, namely, MA and GA-centered states are deep in the conduction band and are not expected to affect visible absorption, transport, or stability. FA-centered states are close to the CBM: with PBE, the state with the highest density concentration on FA is LUMO+8 at −1.48 eV, only 0.37 eV above the LUMO (−1.85 eV). With B3LYP, the FA-centered state is LUMO+9 at −0.87 eV and 0.51 eV above the LUMO (which is at −1.38 eV). As the effect of nanosizing can lead to a higher offset from the CBM, the proximity of the FA-centered state to the band edge and its effects on electronic properties could be more significant in real materials. The FA-centered states are shown in Fig. 7. While the hybrid functional completely localized the state on formamidinium (LUMO+9 being the only FA-centered state), with PBE, there is delocalization of the density over FA and neighboring Pb atoms. The LUMO+8 state shown Fig. 7 is the most FA-centered, but LUMO+9, LUMO+10, and LUMO+5 (not shown) also have appreciable FA-centered components. This can also be appreciated from several FA-centered peaks in the PDOS (Fig. 6).

3.2.2. Optical absorption. 
We computed absorption spectra of MAPBr, FA/MAPBr, and GA/MAPBr smaller nanoparticles which are shown in Fig. 8. The spectra are blue-shifted compared to the PbI-based nanoparticles, as expected.78,79 The substitution of a MA unit with FA or GA does not significantly change the absorptivity, but, similarly to the PbI-based nanoparticles, there are a number of moderately strong transitions with significant contributions from the FA-centered state. These are given in Table 2 for transitions with oscillator strength exceeding 0.004 and percentage of FA-centered state contribution exceeding 9%, in the smaller FA/MAPBr nanoparticle. The number of such transition is smaller with B3LYP due to a much better localization of the FA-centered state with a hybrid functional. Optical excitations can therefore in principle lead to occupation of states shown in Fig. 7 and to formation of neutral transient formamidinium species and in PbBr-based OIHPs.

4. Conclusions
We used cluster models of OIHPs to study the effect of substitution of methylammonium with larger formamidinium and guanidinium cations in PbI and PbBr-based OIHPs. Such modelization allowed us to compute optical spectra with TD-DFT and to compare bandstructure and optical spectra, including any contributions from organic cation-centered states, between the GGA PBE functional and the hybrid B3LYP functional. We find that while MA and GA introduce (empty) states deep in the conduction band, there are FA-centered states well within 1 eV from the conduction band edge in both MAPI and MAPBr; the offset of these states from the band edge is as small as half an eV with the larger of the nanoparticles used, with both PBE and B3LYP. The FA-centered state is closer to the CBM in MAPBr than in MAPI. These states can therefore be occupied during photoexcitation or electron injection and lead to the formation of transient neutral formamidinium species. This is supported by TD-DFT analysis showing moderate-strength transitions with substantial contributions from FA-centered states, with both PBE and B3LYP. This could affect electronic properties relevant for operation as well as stability of perovskite solar cells and perovskite-based LED.
There is qualitative agreement between GGA and hybrid functional calculations on the proximity of FA-centered states to the bad edge. However, the offset of the FA-centered state from the CBM is larger with B3LYP, and the ordering and localization of the (organic cation-centered) states are different between PBE and B3LYP functionals. In particular, while there is a unique FA-centered state with B3LYP, PBE results in several states with appreciable amplitudes both on FA as well as on the inorganic framework. This can affect computed electronic properties, in particular in non-adiabatic electron dynamics.
We used in this work a global hybrid functional. Range-separated hybrid functionals could allow addressing better self-correction errors in DFT and improve modeling of charge transfer excitations (such as those from PbI-centered VBM to cation-centered states).80–82 Calculations with small-core pseudopotentials for Pb and I with explicit relativistic corrections could also be useful. The conclusions we obtained with PBE and a global hybrid B3LYP point in the same direction (a much closer proximity of FA-centered states to the CBM compared to MA and GA-centered states); we also achieved FA state localization with B3LYP. These conclusions and qualitative comparisons between cations are therefore reliable. While hybrid functionals continue to be impractical for many such calculations, simplified approaches such as small Hubbard corrections, including on s and p states, could be useful.50
