The energy conversion efficiency depends on a dimensionless quantity called the “Figure of merit” (ZT) of the material. The higher value of ZT indicates a material to be a good thermoelectric. So the aim is to find materials with a high ZT value and can commercially be used in devices like thermoelectric generators (TEGs) or thermoelectric coolers (TECs). Some decades ago, the benchmark value of ZT for the available TE materials was ∼1. Still, the application of various novel strategies made it possible to set the target to achieve ZT > 2 or even higher. This review will discuss the traditional and modern strategies for the generic improvement of thermoelectric materials and the progress in thermoelectric performance of Tin and Germanium chalcogenides (SnTe, SnSe, SnS, GeTe, GeSe, and GeS-based materials) over the past few years. Lead chalcogenides have already been one of the best representative materials for TE applications in mid and high-temperature regions for the past few decades. But the toxicity of Pb and related ecological problems restrict their usage for commercial purposes. Sn- and Ge-chalcogenides belong to the same class of (IV–VI) Pb-chalcogenides but cause no serious environmental issues. This article will provide an overview of the progress of Sn- and Ge-chalcogenides as TE materials.Medha RakshitMedha Rakshit received her B.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, demand for energy in human life is increasing by leaps and bounds, but our conventional energy sources are minimal, so nonconventional energy sources are drawing more attention. Environment pollution is also a big problem now, so pollution-free energy generation or green energy generation is preferable. Much of the total consumed energy in various modern industries and process plants is dissipated as waste heat. A proportion of this waste heat can be converted into electricity by applying thermoelectric power generation technology. Thermoelectric conversion efficiency is strongly related to a dimensionless quantity, called the “figure of merit” (ZT) of material, and is defined by the expression, (1)where S-is the Seebeck coefficient or thermopower of the material, σ-is the electrical conductivity of the material, κ-is the thermal conductivity of the material, T-is the absolute temperature and the whole quantity in the numerator [S2σ]-is called the “power factor” of the material. ZT is a consequence of the contest between electronic and thermal transport in a material. TE devices are solid state heat engines. The devices have no moving parts, are highly reliable, and the operation is quiet. The building block of a TE device is called TE-element. Each element consists of an n-type and a p-type leg, made of TE materials. Over a hundred such pairs of TE elements are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel conditions in a TE device, as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. The power generation efficiency1–6 (ηTE) of a TEG is defined by eqn (2) (2)where Tc and Th are the temperatures of cold and hot sides respectively of a TE generator, Tavg-is the average temperature between Tc and Th, ηc-represents the Carnot efficiency and is expressed as  and ZTavg-is the average over the temperature-dependent ZT values between Th and Tc of both n-type and p-type legs. Higher the value of ZT better the material is for TE application.1–6 It can clearly be understood from the given expression of ZT-that to increase the value of ZT-the values of S and σ-should be increased and κ-should be decreased.

Materials with low electron scattering, therefore high electrical conductivity, and strong phonon scattering are preferable for better TE application. Based on these requirements, crystalline materials of the “phonon-glass electron-crystal” (PGEC) type was proposed as suitable TE materials by Slack.7 According to this proposal, the TE materials should possess an intriguing structure that effectively allows the propagation of charge carriers while blocking phonon propagation for better TE performance. Depending on this proposal, various new strategies, concepts, and material systems have been established in past decades. Mainly Cu-based chalcogenides have emerged as a new class of promising TE materials based on this concept.8–15 It is not an easy task to optimize S, σ, and κ according to the requirement because these three quantities are strongly correlated with each other. No quantity can be modified without affecting at least any other quantity in a negative way. So first, we have to decouple these quantities and then modify them. Rapid improvement in the ZT (>1) value of TE materials has resulted from various newly invented strategies. The creation of nanostructured materials made it possible to improve TE performance tremendously.16–22 Materials in low dimensional forms, such as superlattices (2D structures), nanowires (1D structures), quantum dots (0D structures), etc., can achieve a considerably higher ZT, that was beyond expectations from their traditional bulk forms. The new variable of length scale comes into play with a reduction in the dimensionality of the material, which effectively controls materials' property.18 Thermoelectric properties of traditional bulk materials have been improved by introducing the distribution of nanoscale constituents in the entire sample. This way, to achieve better TE applications, low-dimensional and bulk materials were brought together.17,18 Not all nanostructured materials are efficiently applicable for large-scale commercial uses as they are expensive and slow to be fabricated or can usually be fabricated in a small quantity. Among various nanostructured materials, bulk nanostructured materials can be fabricated via bulk processes rather than those costly and slow nanofabrication processes and are most promising for large-scale commercial purposes.21
Not only inorganic but also organic TE materials are very popular nowadays. The ZT for organic TE materials [polyaniline (PANI), polyacetylene (PA), polypyrrole (PPy), polylactic acid (PLA), polythiophene (PTH), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiohene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), etc.] are usually lower than that for inorganic TE materials due to their low electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and PF. Doped, dedoped organic materials and organic/inorganic nanocomposite materials23–27 show remarkable TE performance. Bi2Te3,25,26 Bi2Se3,24etc., are efficient inorganic compounds used in organic–inorganic composite materials for TE applications. Organic TE materials have the advantage of low density, lightweight, flexibility, low κlattice and can easily be fabricated on a large scale. On the other hand, inorganic TE materials have a high Seebeck coefficient and electric conductivity. To take advantage of both classes of materials, “hybrid organic–inorganic thermoelectrics” is introduced in the field of TE materials.
Among inorganic metal chalcogenides, the IV–VI metal (Pb, Sn, Ge) chalcogenide materials have some inherent properties that make them suitable for TE applications. Firstly, metal chalcogenide materials have higher atomic weight, which is essential to reduce thermal conductivity. Secondly, the less covalent nature of the bonds arising from low electronegativity increases the PF. Thirdly, these materials can be doped easily and made n-type or p-type according to the need, which is essential to use the materials in TEGs or TECs. Fourthly, these materials can be formed in different structural forms and dimensions. These inherent properties open ample scope for improving their TE performance using various modern and traditional strategies. For the past few decades, Pb-chalcogenides have been among the best representatives of inorganic TE materials for TE applications in mid and high-temperature regions. Still, environmental concerns due to the toxicity of Pb are shrinking their large-scale usage. So, the usage of Pb-free metal chalcogenides in various fields, including electrodes, LEDs, solar cells, memory devices, TE devices, etc., is increasing day by day. Sn- and Ge-chalcogenides (SnTe, SnSe, SnS, GeTe, GeSe, GeS) belong to the same class of (IV–VI) Pb-chalcogenides and have already been proved to be promising TE materials. Tellurium (Te) is the heaviest non-radioactive representative among the chalcogens, and selenium (Se) stands next. Among non-radioactive chalcogens, Te has the least electronegativity (2.1, Pauling scale), and then comes Se (2.4, Pauling scale). Lesser ionic bonds for tellurides and selenides lead to enhanced carrier mobility that helps to achieve high electrical conductivity. Reduction in thermal conductivity and increment of electrical conductivity is advantageous to improve thermoelectric performance. However, the toxicity of Te/Se would be a matter to investigate for their practical application in devices. Many excellent recent reviews reported until now focused on the TE and other properties of any particular metal chalcogenide material or the overall progress of TE materials.28–31 In this review, we aim to provide an overall view on the various novel and traditional strategies to improve TE performance of materials and the outcomes of applying those strategies on the tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge) chalcogenides to improve their TE performance. From the comprehensive study, we predicted some new possible routes to improve the TE properties of those materials further and more effectively use them in green energy generation.
The general strategies to improve the TE performance will be discussed in two parts. The first part will contain strategies to increase the power factor, and the later one will include strategies to decrease the thermal conductivity.
2. Enhancement of power factor (PF)
The power factor (PF) of a thermoelectric material consists of the electrical conductivity (σ) and the Seebeck coefficient (S) of that material. Electrical conductivity (σ) is a measure of the ability of a material to conduct electricity. Solving the Boltzmann equation, one finds the resulting formula for the electrical conductivity of a single band as, (3)where, g(E)-is the density of states (DOS), τ-is the relaxation time, f0-Boltzmann distribution function in equilibrium, m*- effective mass of charge carrier.
The Seebeck coefficient is also called “thermopower” or “thermoelectric power”. Seebeck coefficient provides information about the magnitude of the induced thermoelectric voltage due to the Seebeck effect by applying temperature gradient across that material. It is convenient to define the Seebeck coefficient in terms of Fermi energy to analyze the quantity in band structure level. Diffusion of carriers is not the only cause of the overall Seebeck effect in a material.20 Though the most significant part of the Seebeck effect comes from the diffusion of carriers. Using the Boltzmann transport equation, we can write the Seebeck coefficient for a single band as, (4)

Eqn (4) states that for a single band material, S-is a measure of the energy difference between the average energy (〈E〉) of mobile carriers and the Fermi energy (EF) when τ is a constant parameter.
The Seebeck coefficient for a single band with a typical parabolic density of states19,20,32,33 and assuming carriers to obey classical M–B statistics can be expressed as eqn (5) (5)
The (+) sign is for the VB, while the (−) sign is for the CB, D = dimensionality of the material, q = charge of the carrier, kB = Boltzmann constant, η = reduced Fermi energy = r = scattering parameter (+3/2-for ionized impurity scattering, −1/2-for acoustic phonon scattering, 0-for neutral impurity scattering).34–36 If we take 3D-bulk material then, D = 3 and eqn (5) takes the form, (6)
Similarly, for electrical conductivity, the expression is defined as eqn (7) (7)where, τ0-is a constant, and τ = τ0Er
This assumption is applicable till the carrier concentration is low (non-degenerate regime). When carrier concentration is high enough (degenerate regime), F–D statistics should define various transport parameters rather than classical M–B statistics. From extensive reported data, the ideal carrier concentration for suitable TE materials is observed to lie in a range from 1019 cm−3 to 1021 cm−3, as depicted in Fig. 3, which is sufficient to shift the discussion from classical to F–D statistics.
 Fig. 3  In the non-degenerate semiconductor regime, κel is negligible, and Z-increases with n due to an increase in S. In the degenerate semiconductor regime, Z-reaches a peak when n = noptimum, and [S2σ] is maximized. In the metallic regime, κlattice is negligible, and Z-declines with increasing n due to reduction in S, and increases in κel. Reprinted from ref. 20. Copyright (2010), with permission from Elsevier. 
In this case, S-is expressed as eqn (8). (8)where,  = Fermi integral of the order −x. For 3D-bulk material, eqn (8) becomes (9)
In the degenerate regime, σ-is expressed as eqn (10) (10)
In the metallic regime S-is given by the Mott expression37–40 which is derived from derivative of the energy-dependent electrical conductivity σ(E) = n(E)qμ(E) with respect to the energy at Fermi energy [E = EF] as eqn (11) (11)where, n(E) = f(E)g(E) (12)n(E) = carrier concentration at energy level E, f(E) = Fermi function at energy E, μ(E) = mobility of charge carrier at energy E,  = DOS effective mass, and h = Planck's constant. (13)

Eqn (13) shows that there exist two mechanisms that can increase S, i.e., (i) to increase the energy-dependence of n(E) and (ii) to increase the energy dependence of μ(E). For 3D-bulk materials, eqn (13) can be simplified as, (14)

Eqn (14) states that materials having high -have a high S, thus beneficial to improve ZT. But in the actual case, large DOS due to flat bands leads to a large transport effective mass, which also causes the lowering of mobility (μ), so the PF [S2σ] cannot exceed a particular limiting value. From this discussion, it can be concluded that better TE performance requires lower band effective mass.41 Flat bands and their effects will be discussed later in Section 2.4. From eqn (14), we see that S-decreases if n-is increased. On the other hand, an increase in n is related to an increase in EF-and average energy both. However, the average energy increases relatively slowly than EF. So, in eqn (4), when τ is a constant parameter, then S-continuously decreases as the n-increases. An increase in temperature can also increase carrier concentration hence a decrease in S-and vice versa. Variation of Seebeck coefficient with n is shown in Fig. 4. In an extrinsic semiconductor, the increase in temperature may not significantly increase the carrier concentration, which is fixed to the dopant concentration and does not increase the average energy. In this case, the Fermi level is reduced, and S-is increased. At sufficiently high temperature, the semiconductor may become intrinsic and exhibits a decrease in S-with increasing temperature. This is because both conduction and VBs are now relevant, and the Seebeck coefficient of opposite sign in each band leads to a smaller net value.20

2.1 Increase in local DOS and distortions in DOS by the resonant level formation

S-can be increased if a local increase of DOS in a narrow energy range can be achieved by some techniques.42 Mahan and Sofo expressed ZT-as a functional of transport distribution and found that the form of the distribution function should be a Dirac delta function (2.4 kBT above or below EF) to maximize ZT, but this exact requirement is not usually fulfilled because the local variance in the sample's composition may cause the broadening of the delta function, and the DOS has other terms in addition to a single delta function. To correct this problem, they combined two different single delta functions as DOS functions. Still, the resulting ZT was even lower than the previously calculated ZT from the single delta function. Then, instead of two delta functions, a constant background term was added with the function of DOS as given in eqn (15). The correction term was required due to the presence of other electronic states that do not create the delta-function-like DOS in solid.43 (15)And the transport distribution function was defined as, (16)where, C- is a constant,  About 10% contribution of the background, corresponding to a = 0.1, reduces ZT to 25% of its original value for a = 0.43 So the aim is to find out such materials where the distribution of energy carriers is as narrow as possible with high carrier velocity along the direction of the applied electric field. This idealized mathematical model has been realized in materials having either intrinsic narrowband or resonant state around impurity atom. Resonant levels are formed when the CB or VB of the host semiconductor resonates with one energy level of a localized atom in a semiconductor matrix.42 But resonant-state formation by impurities also has a negative impact on σ, because impurities remarkably reduce the carrier mobility due to additional carrier scattering.
However, distortion in DOS is an effective way to enhance the Seebeck coefficient. Different mechanisms to distort DOS are schematically represented in Fig. 5. The formation of resonant impurity levels distorts the DOS effectively. The presence of impurities can heavily modify the TE properties of a material.44–48 If there are quasi-local states called “resonant levels” of impurity atoms in any allowed energy band of the host material, some extraordinary phenomena can occur. Firstly, carriers can jump on those quasi-local states from the band. After residing there for some time, the carriers ejected back to the band with a different momentum; this is called ‘Resonant scattering’. The finite lifetime of the carriers in the impurity state broadens the energy level (though the broadening may be caused by different reasons also).7 So, the carriers with energies close to the level will be predominantly scattered, making the resonant scattering relaxation time strongly energy-dependent if the broadening is not too significant. This increased energy dependence can increase or decrease τ-and hence S-accordingly.

Resonant scattering causes a strong electron energy filtering effect that enhances the Seebeck coefficient at low temperatures where the electron–phonon interactions are weaker. Secondly, these impurity electrons are in extended states (plane wave-like wave function); they take part in electricity and heat conduction and contribute to the thermopower.42,47 If the resonance level lies below the chemical potential (μ) in a degenerate sample(E < μ) Seebeck coefficient is increased and vice versa. The presence of resonance level affects both terms in eqn (13). When impurities are added to metals, the distortion in DOS is lower hence, -is very small, and the second term  is prominent. In the case of semiconductors -is more important.
Heremans et al.49 demonstrated experimentally that ZT of Tl-doped PbTe could be doubled by increasing S-via introducing additional Tl-impurity levels. The density of electronic states pure PbTe and Tl-doped PbTe is shown in Fig. 6a. Enhancement of S-through a distortion of the electronic DOS resulted in a doubling of ZT in p-type PbTe to ∼1.5 at 773 K, as shown in Fig. 6b. The first experimental evidence of resonant level formation in Bi2Te3via Sn doping was reported by Jaworski et al.50 Here, Sn-sufficiently distorts the DOS of the upper VB to result in a substantial increase in S. Hsu et al.51 worked on a class of novel quaternary compounds AgPbmSbTe2+m and achieved a large figure of merit ZT ∼ 2.2 at 800 K. In this case, resonant states appeared near the VBM and CBM of bulk PbTe when Ag and Sb replaced Pb.52 In a report by Simonson et al.53 introduction of resonant states by the inclusion of V (less than 1%)-dopant in half-Heusler alloy Hf0.75Zr0.25NiSn resulted in an enhanced TE performance. Deng et al.54 observed a peak in DOS near band edge in experimentally synthesized 2D PTTA [poly(tetrathienoanthracene)]. They assumed the presence of quasi-one-dimensional states as the cause of the unique nature of DOS. Electron–phonon interactions can also induce distortions of the DOS; some of these phenomena are “phonon-drag”,55–62 “Nielsen–Taylor pseudo-phonon-drag effect”,63 “polaron mass enhancements”,64etc.

2.2 Relaxation time modulation for charge carriers
When τ is not a constant but a function of E in eqn (4), then the average energy should be weighted by τ to determine the value of S. Charge carriers in a semiconductor may be scattered by stationary defects like impurities and dislocations or by dynamic defects, e.g., electrons, holes, and acoustic phonons. When scattering of charge carriers is not confined within a single energy band, intraband or intravalley scatterings are elastic scattering accompanied by the emission or absorption of the longitudinal mode of acoustic phonons. On the other hand, interband or intervalley scatterings are inelastic and accompanied by the absorption or emission of optical phonons, which occur at high temperatures or high electric fields.34 Bardeen and Shockley developed the deformation potential (DP) method of calculating τ for the nonpolar acoustic phonons scattering, leading to a final expression for τ,65 as given in eqn (17) (17)where, Ξ-is the DP coefficient, the critical parameter determining the strength of carrier scattering by acoustic phonons. The parameter is defined as the change of band energy (ΔE) per relative volume change (ΔV) of the crystal. vl-is the longitudinal velocity of sound waves, and ρ-is density. If we talk about the cases where scattering by static imperfections or ionized impurity scattering is dominant, then according to Conwell and Weisskopf, using bare Coulomb potential as the perturbing Hamiltonian τ-can be expressed as44 (18)where, ε-is the permittivity of the material,  and 2rm = NI−1/3. Brooks and Herring66 later modified this expression by using screened Coulomb potential for those cases where the carrier concentration is too high to screen the impurities. So from the above expressions, we can conclude that the τ can be expressed in terms of the temperature and carrier energy [see Table 1], which is proportional to (T−pEr). An increase in (β = −p + r)-will increase the energy dependence of τ and hence will enhance S-value. So the value of S is higher when ionized impurity scattering (β = +3/2) dominates over neutral impurity (β = 0) and acoustic phonon scattering (β = −3/2-for DP scattering, and β = −1/2-for piezoelectric scattering).35,36,45

So, the Seebeck coefficient can be modified by manipulating τ-and changing the dominance of different scattering processes. A method of manipulation of τ-is through resonant scattering by impurity and defect centers.7,46,48,67,68 According to Ravich et al.,7 when τ and the mean free path (l) are strongly energy-dependent,69 then carrier scattering may show some selective nature, i.e., scattering of the carriers with particular energy are more likely than those with a different energy. ‘Resonant scattering by impurity and defect centers’ and ‘scattering by potential barriers at grain and crystallite boundaries’ exhibit a considerably higher selectivity than ‘Coulomb scattering by charged impurity centers’.7 Presence of potential barrier comparable to the height of EF-can also make τ strongly energy-dependent. Carriers with energy lower than the barrier height are excluded from the carrier flow, and those with higher energy are allowed to pass through the barrier.
2.3 Lowering of the deformation potential (DP)
Chasmar70 first introduced the term “Thermoelectric quality factor” (B). This dimensionless quantity is direct proportionally related to the ZT of a TE material and can also be expressed as70,71 (19)where, Cl = average longitudinal elastic moduli, and Ξ = DP coefficient. Eqn (19) leads to the conclusion that lowering Ξ can be an effective strategy to obtain high ZT materials other than having a large NV and a low  Low Ξ-is also expected for high μ of charge carriers and a weak scattering of carriers by acoustic phonons. Recently, a high-throughput (HT) computational method,72 an efficient tool to screen high-performance functional materials, has been employed to identify suitable TE materials. The calculation involves the DP method under the single band model to evaluate the carrier relaxation time (electronic) and the Grüneisen parameter (or lattice anharmonicity) by computing the elastic properties. In particular, out of 668 binary chalcogenides, the study screens 50 promising thermoelectric materials with excellent electronic properties and intrinsically ultralow thermal conductivities.72 Wang et al. reported ZT ∼ 1.2 at 850 K for n-type PbSe due to the smaller DP coefficient of the conduction than the valence band, resulting in high carrier mobility.73 Low DP coefficient caused better ZT in p-type FeV0.6 Nb0.4 Sb sample also.74
2.4 Lowering of band effective mass and increment of band degeneracy
An increase in DOS near EF of bulk TE materials is possible by various band engineering techniques. Three types of band engineering techniques used to enhance TE performance are based on the compositional tuning of TE materials. They are named resonant state formation,42,46–53,68,75 band flattening,76,77 and band convergence,78–81 respectively. A high ZT via the resonant-state formation has already been discussed. The “optimal figure of merit” (ZToptimal) depends on “Thermoelectric quality factor” (B), where 70,71,74,82 The DOS effective mass can be expressed as,  Where, NV-is the band degeneracy, -is the band effective mass and  with m1, m2 and m3 as mass components along three principal axes in a 3D bulk sample. In an isotropic band  and  Here  is called inertial effective mass and expressed by the given relation, 32 So, we can see that large  can arise due to either a large number of conducting bands (NV) or by flat bands (with high ). The flatness of the bands influences the Seebeck coefficient and mobility oppositely. A high Seebeck coefficient originates from the high total density of states (DOS) effective mass at a given carrier concentration. So, higher  or flatter bands are beneficial to improve the Seebeck coefficient. If, the charge transport by acoustic phonon is dominant, then  So using isotropic band approximation, we get 70,71,74,82–94 Thus, it can be concluded that heavy band effective mass harms TE performance as it reduces mobility and hence ZT. Pei et al.75 synthesized La- and I-doped PbTe by the melting, quenching, annealing, and hot pressing methods. They demonstrated that a lower effective mass leads to a high PF and thus excellent TE performance in n-PbTe. Lowering of effective mass was achieved either by doping or by adjusting the temperature. I-doped PbTe has a 20% lower effective mass than La-doped PbTe. The higher effective mass in La-doped PbTe is presumably due to the CB flattening, and it caused a 20% reduction of PF in La-dopes PbTe. On the other hand, a temperature-induced 40% increase in effective mass resulted in a 35% decrease in peak PF for both La- and I- doped PbTe.
On the other hand, valleys with considerably high value NV or multiple degenerate valleys are beneficial to large  without deterioration of μ.33,74,78 Band degeneracy NV is increased by some causes. One is when multiple bands have band extrema around the same energy or almost within the negligible difference in energy (orbital degeneracy). Another is when multiple carrier pockets71,95,96 of one band in the BZ are degenerate as they are equivalent due to the crystal symmetry (valley degeneracy). One helpful way to increase the degeneracy of band and hence ZT is via converging different bands that were inherently not degenerate due to orbital or BZ symmetry. It is possible to make many valleys of a bulk material converge by tuning the doping and composition of the sample class. By this technique, Pei et al.78 achieved a convergence of at least 12 valleys in doped PbTe1−xSex alloys and resulted in an extraordinary ZT ∼ 1.8 at about 850 K, as shown in Fig. 7a. If two VBs [L(light) and Σ(heavy)] are present in a material, then reducing the energy offset between two VBs (ΔEL–Σ) can result in a remarkable effect of band convergence. Applying band engineering to converge the valence (or conduction) bands to achieve high valley degeneracy has become a general strategy in improving bulk thermoelectric materials because it simultaneously leads to a high Seebeck coefficient and high electrical conductivity. Fu et al.74 found that p-type Half-Heusler (HH) alloy Ti-doped FeV0.6Nb0.4 Sb of the composition Fe(V0.6Nb0.4)1−xTixSb (where, x = 0.04–0.24) with a high band degeneracy of NV = 8, can achieve a high ZT of ∼0.8 at 900 K for x = 0.2, which is one of the best-reported ZT values among the p-type HH compounds. The band effective mass of this system is found to be high  which leads to low mobility, but its low DP and low alloy scattering potential contribute to reasonably high mobility.

According to the electronic structure calculations by Guo et al.,97 the addition of Mn increases Eg of SnTe and reduces the ΔEL–Σ. Due to the band convergence, heavy holes contribute more to electronic transport. As a result, the Seebeck coefficient and hence PF is improved Fig. 7c. Recently Luo et al.80 achieved a substantially improved TE performance in p-PbSe-based materials Ag doping coupled with SrSe or BaSe alloying. While 4d-states of Ag raise the energy of Σ-bands, Sr and Ba atoms hinder the contribution of 6s2-states of Pb and decrease the energy of the L-bands of p-PbSe. As a result ΔEL–Σ gets reduced remarkably, thereby onset of the VB convergence is shifted to lower temperatures (450 K) regime. Recently AgCl-doping and Sb-alloying have been proved to converge bands in SnTe effectively.81 Solubility of MnTe in SnTe indeed increases up to ∼25% with the help of 5% GeTe. An increase in solubility results in band convergence when MnTe concentration reaches ∼20%.75 Xie et al.98 alloyed GeTe and PbTe into SnTe. In this study, the origin of multiple electronic valleys in SnTe was explained using the “band inversion” principle, and the mechanism is schematically represented in Fig. 8a and b. GeTe or PbTe alloying separately can increase the number of VBs of SnTe, but GeTe/PbTe co-alloying in SnTe gives rise to at least three VBs that are almost converged in energy. Further doping with Cd-enlarges the band gap. A remarkably high ZT > 1.4 was achieved near 873 K in the Sn0.48Cd0.02Ge0.25Pb0.25Te sample.

2.5 ‘Diffusion of carriers’ and ‘phonon-drag’
‘Diffusion of carriers’ and ‘phonon-drag’ both enhance a particular material's Seebeck coefficient. Over the past few decades, the ZT value of TE materials has been successfully enhanced above 300 K. Still, a relatively small Seebeck coefficient and high thermal conductivity at low temperatures resist that enhancement of ZT. ‘Phonon-drag’ is dominant at lower temperatures and is weak at higher carrier concentrations. In the expressions for the Seebeck coefficient, the effect of phonons flowing between the two ends is not considered. But the fact is, phonons travel from the hot side to the cold side due to the temperature gradient between the hot and cold ends. During this travel, phonons and charge carriers would interact, and part of the momentum from phonons will transfer to the charge carrier. The charge carriers would gain extra momentum from phonons in the forward direction and travel from the hot side to the cold side by contributing to extra current to be balanced out by the generated electric field and an increased Seebeck coefficient. Phonon-drag increases the effective mass of carriers (electrons or holes) due to interactions with the crystal lattice through which the carrier moves. This effect leads to a decrease in carrier mobility, increase in S and a reduced κ. Phonons contributing to phonon-drag are with longer mean free path and lower frequency. Still, phonons with a shorter mean free path and higher frequency contribute more to thermal conductivity than phonon-drag.7,33,56–61 The ‘Phonon-drag’ effect is significant only in materials where phonons are not strongly scattered and have long mean free paths and the strong electron–phonon interaction.99 Phonon-drag has a more significant contribution from the longitudinal phonon modes than the transverse modes due to the greater group velocities in the former mode. But overall, the diffusion of carriers is the most common process that contributes to the Seebeck coefficient of material and dominates at higher temperatures.56–61 First-principle computation of the phonon-drag effect was reported by Zhou et al.60 Fauziah et al.57 observed size dependency of the phonon-drag factor of the Seebeck coefficient due to enhancing the phonon-boundary scattering in micro/nanometer-scale Si wires. Applying linear response theory in the presence of impurity band, beyond Boltzmann transport regime, Matsuura et al.56 studied the effects of phonon-drag on resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of the FeSb2 sample.
2.6 Reduction of dimensionality of the materials
The quantities in ZT expression are strongly correlated in 3D crystalline systems, making it difficult to control these variables independently to improve ZT. Energy dependence on DOS in different dimensions is depicted in Fig. 9.

If the dimensionality of the material is reduced and system size decreases up to the nanometer length scale, it becomes easier to manipulate the TE properties of materials. The quantum confinement effect on carriers led to the enhancement in power factor in low-dimensional systems.67,100,101 A similar spatial confinement effect on phonon was also observed and hence caused strong modification of κlattice by manipulating phonon group velocity. In addition to that, different kinds of interface scatterings can't be neglected when the dimension of materials is reduced.102 In 1993, Hicks and Dresselhaus proposed that the sharply peaked electronic density of states (DOS) in 2D quantum wells and 1D quantum wires effectively improve PF and ZT.103,104 This work motivated the development of 2D-“superlattice” structures to acquire high TE performance. The use of numerous interfaces (2D) is to scatter phonons more effectively than electrons and to scatter, preferably those phonons that contribute most strongly to the thermal conductivity, not those contributing to phonon-drag. For any material κlattice reaches its lowest value at the amorphous phase with the same chemical composition, which is the “amorphous limit”, but it is very challenging to reach that point or beyond it. “Superlattice” structures are specially designed to eliminate this problem and are usually layered phononic materials. Two strategies were found that reduce κlattice remarkably in low dimension materials. The first strategy is to impose a significant mass mismatch between two intercalated layers, and the second is the weakening of inter-layers interactions compared to those intra-layers.102,105–109 Therefore, ZT can be further enhanced by reducing lattice thermal conductivity in a wide variety of thermoelectric systems. SnTe/PbSe, SnTe/PbS, EuTe/PbTe superlattices, and SnEuTe films also show better thermoelectric properties than bulk SnTe.110 A recent investigation on 3D-GeSe and monolayered-GeSe showed that both structures are equally stable and can break the benchmark limit of ZT ≈ 1 at room temperature.111
2.7 Some other strategies to improve PF
Energy filtering83–89,112 and charge density wave formation86,87,113 are other strategies to increase the PF[S2σ]. Carriers with low kinetic energies get stopped by the energy barrier generated by introducing nanometric precipitates at nanoprecipitate phase boundaries, but high-energy electrons pass through them; this mechanism is named energy filtering. Kim et al.90 reported experimental evidence of such carrier energy filtering effect in Te-nanoparticle-dispersed Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films. They observed that S-increased significantly from 169 μV K−1 to 248 μV K−1 when Te-nanoparticles of 15 nm diameter were increased up to 15 vol%. Though this increment in S-was accompanied by a decrement in σ, the overall PF was improved by 30%. Charge density wave (CDW), caused by the local lattice distortion, is a low-dimensional transport phenomenon involving strong electron–phonon coupling and reduces lattice thermal conductivity by breaking the translational symmetry of lattices. This method was investigated on CuI-doped Bi2Te2.1Se0.9 compounds.87 Tian et al.112 reported, nanoscale/microscale Ag precipitates in Ag-plated SnTe bulk introduce Ag/SnTe interfaces to enhance the Seebeck coefficient via energy filtering effect.
3. Reduction of thermal conductivity (κ)
There is a lower limit of κlattice in bulk materials, the value of κlattice cannot be reduced below that limit. Most of the defects in lattice scatter charge carriers as well as phonons. Thus improvement of ZT depends on the ratio μ-decreases with decrease in mean free path of electron (charge carrier), i.e., defect in lattice reduces μ. On the other hand, κlattice also decreases with the introduction of defects and disorders in a lattice. If κlattice-reduces faster than μ-then the ratio will be increased, increasing the value of ZT.100 Over the past few decades, it has been challenging to achieve ZT > 1 because it is hard to reduce thermal conductivity below the “amorphous limit” or, in some cases, below the “alloy limit”.91,92κ-consists of two components as, κ = κel + κlattice. Where, κel is the electronic part of thermal conductivity, κel = LσT [Wiedemann–Franz Law]. In these expressions L-is Lorenz number, and can be expressed as20 (20)L-is a universal constant of value 2.44 × 10−8 WΩ K−2 for degenerate limit. For the non-degenerate limit L-converges to another constant value of 1.5 × 10−8 WΩ K−2 for acoustic phonon scattering. A new formula is applicable to calculate the Lorenz number, derived after taking the first-order correction to the degenerate limit. In this case,  in units of 10−8 WΩ K−2 for L, and μV K−1 for S.93,94 We can see that all these three quantities (S, σ, κel) depends on the carrier concentration of that material. σ and κel-both increase but S-decreases with increasing carrier concentration. This carrier concentration dependent quantities can be modified by chemical doping. The increment or decrement of charge carrier concentration depends on the type of dopant used, but the enhanced scattering between dopants and carriers can also reduce the mobility of the charge carriers, which in turn will reduce κel. Considering all such factors, it was observed that good TE materials have an ideal density of charge carriers in a range from 1019 cm−3 to 1021 cm−3 and fall under the range of typical carrier concentration of degenerate semiconductors. Heat can be transported through solids via different types of carriers like electrons, phonons, magnons, etc. As they are degenerate semiconductors for good TE materials, phonons play a significant role in heat conduction. In such types of semiconductors, the maximum proportion of thermal conductivity comes from the lattice component. If the component κlattice-can be reduced by some method, then overall κ value can also be reduced effectively. Over the past decades, so many methods have been invented to reduce the κlattice-component.  where CV-is the specific heat of the material, v-is the velocity of sound through the material, l-is the mean free path of phonon in the material lattice. Now, these three quantities of a TE material should be small to reduce κlattice and hence κ.
3.1 Reduction of specific heat (CV) of the material
According to classical statistics CV per atom is 3 kB for all solids at all temperatures (Dulong–Petit's law). But later it was concluded that CV approaches Dulong–Petit's limit in solids at high temperatures only. So specific heat is a built-in property of a material and is difficult to manipulate. But the incorporation of liquid nature in a crystalline solid is helpful to modify their CV. Liquids restrict the propagation of transverse mechanical waves, and thus contribution from transverse phonon mode to the overall specific heat gets reduced, thereby leading to a significant reduction in CV. Many elemental, as well as complex liquids with N-atoms, show that their CV, decreases with temperature, from about 3N kB at the melting point to (2–2.5)N kB at high temperature.114,115 Copper chalcogenide materials at high temperatures exhibit superionic cubic phases, in which Cu-atoms flow through the rigid framework of chalcogen atoms. Liquid-like behavior [“phonon-liquid electron-crystal” (PLEC)] of Cu-chalcogenides provided a route to reduce CV below Dulong–Petit's limit even at high temperature. Liu et al.8 achieved ZT ∼ 1.5 at 1000 K in the Cu2Se sample. In this case, Se-atoms form an FCC rigid sublattice and provide an effective pathway for charge carrier transport. On the other hand, Cu-ions' sublattices are highly disordered around the Se-sublattice. At high temperatures, Cu-ions can travel among the interstitial sites, exhibiting a liquid-like character and results κ < 0.1 Wm−1 K−1. He et al.9 reported that a reduction in CV of lattice vibrations is more prominent in Cu2S than in Cu2Se. As a result, κ < 0.6 Wm−1 K−1 in the whole temperature range and a maximum ZT ∼ 1.7 at 1000 K was achieved. ZT ∼ 1.1 at 1000 K was achieved in high-density Cu2Te samples synthesized via direct annealing without a sintering process.10 Reduction in lattice thermal conductivity was observed in other materials with liquid-like nature like Li0.09Cu1.9Se,11 Cu5FeS4,12 Cu7PSe6,13 CuCrSe2,14 Cu1.94Se0.5S0.5,15 AgCrSe2,116etc. Roychowdhury et al.117 reported that scattering of heat-carrying acoustic phonon modes by soft phonons causes ultralow κlattice ∼ 0.35 Wm−1 K−1 and ZT ∼ 1.6 at 670 K in AgCuTe. Hexagonal-to-rocksalt superionic transition in AgCuTe was observed in the temperature range 380–510 K.
3.2 Reduction of phonon relaxation time
According to the Drude theory, κlattice is expressed by eqn (21) (21)
So, another way to minimize κlattice of TE material is to minimize τ of phonon by increasing the scattering rate of phonons or anharmonicity in the material. There are many strategies to reduce κlattice by reducing τ. Some strategies are discussed here. To summarize the phonon scattering, it is usually emphasized to achieve a nearly full-spectrum scattering to minimize τ of phonon that usually requires a coexistence of multiple types of scattering mechanisms. It is therefore challenging to unequivocally distinguish how much each type of mechanism is contributing to the reduction of κlattice.

3.2.1 Increment in scattering rate of phonons. 
Any scattering mechanism that chooses phonons to scatter more effectively than charge carriers (electrons or holes) can increase the ratio of electrical to thermal conductivity. In that case, phonon mean free path gets reduced. Various types of phonon scattering are schematically shown in Fig. 10. Scattering of phonons by other phonons, lattice defects, charge carriers, or impurities reduce κlattice by reducing the mean free path of phonons. According to the Debye–Callaway model κlattice can be expressed in terms of combined relaxation time (τc) as,118 (22)
 Fig. 10  Schematic diagram illustrating various phonon scattering mechanisms within a thermoelectric material, along with electronic transport of hot and cold electrons. Copyright (2010) Wiley. Used with permission from ref. 16. 
To minimize κlattice, τc should also be minimized. Overall scattering rate (τc−1) can be expressed as the combination of all possible scattering mechanisms. τc−1 = τPD−1 + (τDC−1 + τDS−1) + τIN−1 + τU−1(23)
The aim is to scatter phonons more effectively to reduce κlattice. Every scattering process has unique ω and temperature dependence. Scattering by point defects (0D) shows τPD−1 ∝ ω4, scattering from dislocation cores (1D) shows τDC−1 ∝ ω3, for dislocation strains (1D) τDS−1 ∝ ω1, for interface scattering (2D) by nanostructures or precipitates τIN−1 ∝ ω0 and phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering shows τU−1 ∝ ω2.118 Phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering enables effective scattering of phonons with all frequencies. Point defects effectively scatter high-frequency phonons, dislocations effectively scatter mid-frequency phonons, and interfaces mostly scatter low-frequency phonons. Temperature also plays a vital role in various types of phonon scattering, as shown in Fig. 11. At low-temperature regime, grain boundary scattering, at mid-temperature regime electron–phonon and point defect scattering, and high-temperature regime Umklapp scattering become more effective phonon scattering mechanism.119

3.2.1.1 Point defects. 
Point defects affect the transport properties of the crystal lattice at a length scale of interatomic distance. Point defects are mainly vacancies, interstitials, substitutions, etc. point defect scattering is the most effective scattering mechanism to reduce κlattice for TE materials by reducing τ of phonons. Point defect scattering arises from the combination of mass field fluctuations and strain field fluctuations between the host and impurity atoms. Other than inherent vacancies, there can be vacancies created intentionally by forming solid solutions with a solvent compound with a smaller cation-to-anion ratio than the matrix. The solid solution method can also generate interstitial atoms, with a solvent compound having a larger cation-to-anion ratio. Phonon scattering by interstitial defects results in very low κlattice in SnTe–Cu2Te solid solutions. Pei et al.120 reported κlattice ∼ 0.5 Wm−1 K−1 at 850 K due to stronger phonon scattering arising from high solubility and large mass and strain fluctuations by interstitial Cu atoms. Kihoi et al.48 reported κlattice ∼ 0.86 Wm−1 K−1 for the Sn0.85Mn0.09Sb0.035Bi0.025Te sample at 773 K. The reduced lattice thermal conductivity originated from enhanced phonon scattering by introducing point defects resulting from mass fluctuation in the multiple dopants, grain boundaries, embedded nanostructures in the grains, and strained Mn-rich nano-precipitates in the grain boundary. In the case of (SnTe)3−3x(In2Te3)x solid solutions, a high vacancy concentration emerges on the cation sites. The strong vacancy phonon scattering between Sn-atoms and lattice vacancies enables a significant suppression of phonon propagation when combined with the scattering from In-rich nano-precipitates.121 Enhancement of phonon scattering without any detrimental influence on electronic transport by Cu-interstitials causes low κlattice ∼ 0.4 Wm−1 K−1 in SnTe–GeTe–MnTe alloys.75
3.2.1.2 Line defects. 
The density and position of the dislocation in a material can affect phonon transport significantly. An increase in dislocation density in TE materials can be achieved by plastic deformation, liquid-phase sintering, clustering of vacancies or interstitials in the grain of a single-phase material, etc. Wu et al.122 explained the evolution and migration at Grain Boundaries in SnTe. Sn0.995In0.005Te samples were synthesized by three different methods [water quenched ingot as cast (IAC), hand-milled + spark plasma sintered pellet (HMS), and ball milled + spark plasma sintered pellet (BMS)]. Dislocations were observed to migrate from the interiors of the grains in the IAC sample and form arrays at grain boundaries in the HMS and BMS samples. Characterization and model simulation suggests that the in-grain dislocations have less impact on heat-carrying phonon scattering than dislocation arrays at the grain boundaries. The in-grain dislocation is more efficient than dislocation arrays at the grain boundaries for charge carrier scattering. Guo et al.97 synthesized SnTe–MnTe alloys by annealing and hot pressing. In this case, the high-density dislocation cores were observed in Sn0.94Mn0.09Te. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image and its inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images show several dislocation cores inside. 3D strain clusters found in the material should be dislocation clusters associated with Mn-interstitial atoms, which induces clustered strain fields. Enhancement in the lattice strain causes a reduction in the κlattice. Dislocations-induced lattice strain can locally change the phonon frequencies and reduce the group velocity of phonons. Kim et al.123 achieved sufficiently low κlattice in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 sample by producing the periodic dislocations at low-energy grain boundaries. They synthesized the sample using a liquid-phase compaction process. But the synthesis technique was a bit different from the traditional liquid-phase sintering process and included applied pressure and transient flow of the liquid phase during compaction because traditional sintering techniques also accompany a reduction in s. Finally, they achieved κlattice ∼ 0.33 Wm−1 K−1 at 320 K.
3.2.1.3 Plane defects. 
Low-frequency phonons are in the target region of interface scattering. Since the heat-carrying phonons usually have low frequencies at low temperatures, so interface scattering is more effective for reducing κlattice at low temperatures. Dense interfaces can be created in a material by introducing nanoscale precipitates, nanocomposites or reducing the grain size of materials. GeTe/Bi2Te3 superlattice-like materials are promising systems where plane defects can successfully reduce κlattice. Lower value of κlattice ∼ 0.162 Wm−1 K−1 was achieved due to the effects of interfaces and Bi atoms in Bi2Te3.124 Alloying Bi2Te3 in GeTe can generate vast Ge-vacancies in the GeTe lattice.125 Through proper heat treatment, Ge-vacancies produce nanoscale van der Waals gaps, and these vacancy gaps induce nanoscale ferroelectric domains with 180° domain walls. Finally, a hierarchical “ferroelectric” domain structure arises that was found beneficial to reduce κlattice.125 Grain boundaries, nanoscale precipitates, stacking faults caused low κlattice in the Ge0.89Sb0.1In0.01Te sample.126 The presence of grain boundary and stacking faults play an essential role in the reduction of κlattice of Cd/Bi co-doped GeTe.127 Ball milling, melt spinning, spark plasma sintering can effectively decrease the grain size and increase the density of the interface. The presence of grain boundary and the Si/Ge dopants can effectively scatter the phonons and reduce κlatticein 2D-SnSe sample.225


3.2.2 Presence of large anharmonicity. 
Anharmonicity and strong phonon–phonon interactions (PPI's) are probable origins of low thermal conductivity in various classes of materials. Phonon–phonon scattering has a lesser negative impact on electron mobility than alloy or defect scattering of phonons. In a temperature range where heat is conducted by acoustic phonons mostly, and scattering mechanism is mainly the intrinsic phonon–phonon scattering, the lattice thermal conductivity κlattice is approximated in terms of Grüneisen parameter (γ), Young's modulus (Y), and Debye temperature (θD) as129–132 (24)where,  = mean atomic weight of all the constituent atoms, a3 = average volume occupied by one atom, ϑ = number of atoms in the unit primitive cell, A = constant, ρ = density of the material, and T = absolute temperature.

Y, θD, and γ are related to the average velocity of sound (va). Relation of va with different parameters in 3D-bulk materials can be extracted from the following relations. (25) (26) (27) (28) (29)Here, vs = shear sound velocity, vl = longitudinal sound velocity, vp = Poisson ratio.129–131,133,134 It can be concluded that low Young's modulus, low shear modulus (G), and large Grüneisen parameter imply strong anharmonicity, strong phonon–phonon interactions, and low lattice thermal conductivity in a material. Low thermal conductivity due to large anharmonicity has been observed in the case of IV–VI metal chalcogenides, as SnTe,135,136 layered orthorhombic SnSe,137–140etc. If a crystal is fabricated without any structural defects even then also κlattice has a finite value because of the anharmonic phonon scattering by the Umklapp process. Other than phonon–phonon Umklapp scattering, there are various other origins of anharmonicity in a lattice.
Bonding heterogeneity and lone-pair induced anharmonicity can cause ultralow thermal conductivity. During thermal vibration, interactions between nonbonding lone-pair electrons and bonding electrons of the neighboring atoms due to the overlapping wave functions occur. These overlaps induce nonlinear electrostatic repulsive forces, which resist lattice vibration. As a result, the outermost electron shell containing a lone pair of electrons gets deformed largely by lattice vibrations. Thus strong anharmonicity comes into play due to remarkable change in nonlinear terms in total energy associated with the crystal.131,140–143 Group-V elements As, Sb, Bi have s2-lone-pair. Stereo-chemically active lone-pairs can cause anharmonicity in lattice and lower the thermal conductivity of solids. Nielsen et al.142 theoretically and experimentally found that presence of group-V elements in the whole class of simple high-symmetry crystalline solids of composition ABX2 [A = Cu, Ag, Au, Na, K, Rb, Cs; B= As, Sb, Bi; and x= S, Se, Te] generates highly anharmonic acoustic phonons. The s-electron shell of the group-V elements can be easily deformed by lattice vibrations and leads to a strong anharmonicity. Anharmonicity in some of the large-grained polycrystals like AgSbSe2, AgBiSe2, Ag0.73Sb1.12Te2, NaSbSe2, NaBiTe2, and NaSbTe2 can be so strong that phonon scattering reduces κlattice to the amorphous limit. According to Skoug et al.,140 Cu3SbSe4, CuSbSe2, and Cu3SbSe3 exhibit different Se–Sb–Se angles. Mutual interaction between the 5s lone pair electrons of Sb and the adjacent valence electrons during thermal agitation leads to large lattice anharmonicity in the lattice. In the case of AgPbBiSe3, lone pairs of Bi and Pb-atoms strengthen their bonds with Se by off-centering and weaken Ag–Se bonds.144 A combination of chemical and structural heterogeneity arises at atomic scales that reduce τ of acoustic phonon scattering and hence reduce κlattice.144 Comparative study on κlattice of different Ga and In-monochalcogenides by Nissimagoudar et al.143 reveals that anharmonic parameters play a more vital role than harmonic parameters in these monolayers. As in this case, GaS (InS) has a higher κlattice than GaTe(InTe) and GaSe(InSe) it can be concludes that anharmonic scattering rate in GaS(InS) is lower than that in GaSe(InSe) and GaTe(InTe). But the actual picture turned out to be completely different. GaS, InS were found to have a higher anharmonic scattering rate than other group-13 monochalcogenides because large anharmonic interatomic force constants (IFCs) are associated with strong interaction between nonbonding lone-pair s electrons and bonding electrons of adjacent Ga/In atoms. In SnS0.5Se0.5, 5s2 lone-pairs of Sn are more localized than in SnS and strengthen the anisotropy of Fermi surface and lattice anharmonicity.145
Generally, strong anharmonicity is observed in materials with a distorted crystal structure. Still, there are so many highly symmetric crystal structures like SnTe, PbTe, Bi2Te3 (rock-salt structure), etc., that also exhibit strong anharmonicity.135,136,146 Structural instability, softening of transverse optical phonon modes, and long-range interatomic interaction due to the presence of resonant bonds contribute to large lattice anharmonicity and strong phonon–phonon scattering in materials having symmetric crystal structure.117,146–149 Long-range interaction along 〈100〉 direction was observed in rock-salt structured materials due to resonant bonding.136,150,151 The importance of this interaction decreases with increasing distortion of the crystal structures. Unlike Coulomb interaction, the strength of long-range interaction does not decrease monotonously with increasing atomic distance, and instead, the strength fluctuates in a pretty irregular manner. Long-range interaction induces near ferroelectric instability in IV–VI metal chalcogenides.136,152 Ferroelectric instability softens optical phonon modes. Soft phonon modes help to reduce κlattice by introducing strong anharmonic scattering and a large scattering phase space volume.151 Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and first-principles simulations, Li et al.149 confirmed strong anisotropic nature and giant anharmonicity of phonons in SnSe. They identified that strong anharmonicity in SnSe originates from a bonding instability from the long-range resonant p-bond network of Se-atoms, coupled to stereo-chemically active lone-pair of Sn atom.
Solids possess 3N vibrational modes, among which 3 modes are acoustic, and 3(N–1) are optical.115 The optical modes store most thermal energy, but they contribute little to heat conduction due to their low group velocity. In addition, the heat-carrying acoustic modes tend to interact with and are suppressed by the optical branches.154 An increase in ‘N’- means an increase in crystal's complexity and maybe a larger unit cell. So complex crystals increase the number of optical modes that, in turn, reduces κlattice. Phonon–phonon scattering is a consequence of the anharmonicity of the chemical bond. Acoustical to optical phonon scattering effectively can reduce κlattice. From the dispersion relation of optical and acoustic phonon branches, we notice a “frequency gap” between them at the BZ boundary, which reduces with a reduction in mass ratio between the constituent atoms of the unit cell, as shown in Fig. 12. That lattice restricts the propagation of any vibrational mode that falls within that gap. The extent of the frequency gap between the acoustic and optical branches regulates the Umklapp scattering rate. A small gap size corresponds to the high probability of longer wavelength phonons taking part in the Umklapp scattering process. That means a small frequency gap leads to higher group velocity (longer wavelength) phonons scattered into the optical phonons, and optical phonons have negligible impact on the thermal conduction as they have near-zero group velocity .155,156 From INS measurements and first-principles computations of the phonons, Delaire et al.146 identified strong anharmonic coupling between the transverse optic mode and the longitudinal acoustic modes of phonon in PbTe is the cause of its low thermal conductivity though having a simple rock-salt type crystal structure. According to Tian et al.,147 the softening of optical phonon modes plays an essential role in the thermal conduction of bulk PbSe and PbTe and serves as important scattering channels for acoustic phonons. In a recently reported work, Wu et al.157 theoretically showed that coupling of spin–orbit interaction with phonon anharmonicity has a significant effect on κlattice of SnSe.
 Fig. 12  Schematic diagrams showing the acoustical-to-optical phonon scattering process. The mass ratio of constituent atoms is related to the gap between the acoustic and optical branches. Reproduced from ref. 224 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Another source of anharmonicity is the presence of “Rattling modes” that were first found in materials with cage-like structures such as clathrates,158,159 skutterudites,160 and cobaltates.161 Materials with open crystallographic positions that can serve as an efficient “host” for inserted atoms are weakly bonded with the basic structural frame. As a result, they can vibrate around the central position (known as rattlers). In most of the bulk materials, the optical phonons have a lesser contribution in lattice thermal conductivity. When the system size reaches the nanoscale, the contribution of optical phonons in lattice thermal conductivity increases.162 But contribution in thermal conduction by acoustic phonon modes cannot be entirely excluded by introducing structural complexity only. Resonant phonon modes originated from “rattling” atoms, or atom clusters can reduce the velocity of the remaining acoustic phonons.154 In resonant bonding, coupling between optical and acoustic phonon modes happens mainly due to the softening of the optical branch, but according to the rattling model, both types of modes get softened.150 The Skutterudite system consists of voids in the structure. Filling those voids with the suitable type of atoms yields a remarkable reduction in the κlattice. Because atoms residing in the void space “rattle” there substantially affect the phonon propagation through the lattice.163 Clathrates emphasize the spatial separation of two substructures known as host clathrate framework and rattling guests. The host framework eases the transport of charge carriers and enhances PF, whereas the rattling of guests inside oversized cages of the host framework reduces κlattice by introducing scattering of acoustic phonons or reducing phonon group velocity.158,159 According to further research works, not only caged materials exhibit rattling modes. Without the presence of an oversized cage in LaOBiS2−xSex, “planar rattling” motions of Bi atoms can scatter phonon-like rattling in the case of caged compounds.164 NaxCoO2,161 CuP2,165 AgIn5S8,166 CsAg5Te3, AgBi3S5, BiCuSeO, Cu3SbSe3, Zintl tellurides such as TlInTe2 and InTe,117etc. also shows low κlattice originated from the presence of “rattling modes”. Jana et al.141 reported ultralow κlattice in mixed (In+/In3+) valent InTe. The rattling In+ cation with 5s2 lone-pairs leads to the generation of strongly anharmonic phonons, which couple with the heat-carrying acoustic phonon modes and lead to an ultralow κlattice.

3.3 Reduction of phonon group velocity
An effective strategy to reduce the κlattice, regardless of other scattering mechanisms present, is to slow down heat conduction by phonons lowering their group velocity. To discuss the strategies for reducing phonon group velocity, we take a simplified picture of a lattice. Where successive atoms with an average mass  is connected by a spring (chemical bonds) of length a and restoring force constant is K (strength of chemical bond), Phonon group velocity (v) is 115 The expression of phonon group velocity indicates that weak restoring force, as well as the heavy atomic mass of the constituent elements, are advantageous to reduce v. A more detailed discussion leads to the concept of low phonon group velocity or low sound velocity in materials with global or local soft bonds. Global soft bonds reduce group velocity overall, while local soft bonds induce low-frequency optical modes that interact locally with high-frequency acoustic modes.167 Ying et al.168 proposed α-MgAgSb as promising TE material in low-temperature range (300–550 K) and predicted coexistence of global and local weak chemical bonds to be the origin of the intrinsically low κlattice. In this case, Mg–Ag–Sb bonds in α-MgAgSb vibrate locally and induce low-frequency optical phonons, resulting in “rattling-like” thermal damping to further reduce the κlattice. Additionally, valence electron count (VEC) = 8 for α-MgAgSb causes its weak bonding nature. The low VEC directly leads to weak interatomic interactions and global chemical bonding. It also causes the transformation to the low symmetry phase, which possesses three-center bonds and weak local chemical bonding. Low phonon velocity ∼ 1921 m S−1 and low κlattice ∼ 0.6 Wm−1 K−1 at room temperature was reported for α-MgAgSb. In the case of clathrates, the rattling of guest atoms is the main reason for reducing κlattice. There are some features of clathrates that reduce κlattice, e.g., vacancy formation, formation of superstructures, mass alternation, etc. Vacancy formation within the clathrate framework makes it less rigid, leading to a reduction in phonon group velocity. The formation of superstructures gives rise to high unit volumes causes less coordinated vibrations of framework atoms. Mass alternation within guest substructure alters phonon mean free path without affecting individual rattling modes. Mainly, rattling modes lower phonon group velocity because of avoided crossing acoustic modes or resonant scattering of phonons.159 Such an avoided crossing effect has been observed in Ba8Ga16Ge30 clathrate, where the presence of guest Ba-atom in the cages largely reduces the group velocity of high-frequency acoustic phonons.169 GeTe/PbTe co-alloying leads to significant lattice softening by intense internal stains, resulting from high-density dislocations at the grain boundaries. Xie et al.98 measured sound velocities through SnTe, Sn0.8Ge0.1Pb0.1Te, Sn0.6Ge0.2Pb0.2Te and Sn0.5Ge0.25Pb0.25Te samples to be 1946 m S−1, 1828 m S−1, 1670 m S−1 and 1500 m S−1 respectively. Reduction in sound velocity with increasing proportion co-alloying agents is a sign of lattice softening. The lattice softening leads to a low lattice thermal conductivity. In/Mn co-doping softens chemical bonds in SnTe. Softened chemical bonds lead to lower κlattice. As a result of In/Mn co-doping, ZT = 1.03 was achieved in Sn0.89In0.01Mn0.1Te at 923 K.171 Se- substitution caused larger atomic mass and smaller force constants and, therefore, low phonon group velocity for SnS0.5Se0.5.145
3.4 Nanostructure engineering
Nanostructure engineering, such as introducing quantum dots, quantum wells, nanowires, nanotubes, and thin films, has been widely utilized in TE materials to reduce the κlattice. Nanostructures can scatter medium-wavelength phonons and improve TE properties. Nanostructuring in bulk materials was first implemented in AgPbmSbTe2+m (LAST-m) system.17κlattice of PbS can be significantly reduced by introducing nanostructured second phases. Doping with SrS and CaS form a mixture of a nanostructured/solid solution material. Nanoscale precipitates and point defects both play an important role in reducing the κlattice.172 When the nanoprecipitates are coherently embedded in the matrix, it is called endotaxial nanostructures. Tan et al.208 reported that endotaxial CdS or ZnS nanoscale precipitates reduce κlattice of SnCd0.03Te remarkably with no effect on the PF. Sootsman et al.173 prepared bulk PbTe with nano inclusions of Sb, Bi, and InSb embedded in the matrix, which led to remarkably reduced κlattice. Low κlattice ∼ 1.1 Wm−1 K−1 due to collective phonon scattering from mesostructured grain boundaries, nanostructured precipitates, nanoscale defect layers, and solid solution point defects was achieved in Ge0.90Bi0.10Te.174 Nanostructured In-doped SnTe,175 nanostructured p-type Gex(SnyPb1−y)1−xTe alloys,176 (GeTe)75(AgSbTe2)y(AgSbSe2)x,177 TAGS-materials,178 solid solution series of Ge12In2Te15 and Ge12Sb2Te15 also show promising TE performance due to various nanostructuring.179
3.5 All-scale hierarchical architectures
The periodic arrangement of atoms in crystalline lattice results in periodic dependence of frequency ω() on the wave vector . Different types of waves of atoms' displacements can propagate in crystals, which can differ in the motions of atoms within one crystal cell. Consequently, several types of phonons in crystals are characterized by a specific dependence of energy on momentum. Recently, hierarchical phonon scattering has been suggestive of being effective in reducing the κlattice and hence, enhancing ZT of heavy-band TE materials.180 Hierarchical phonon scattering centers scatter the phonons with different frequencies. The hierarchical scattering centers should be at a shorter distance than the phonon mean free path (lph) but at a longer distance than the carrier mean free path (lc) so that phonons are more strongly scattered than charge carriers. The sub-microscale grain boundaries usually target low-frequency phonons, while more atomic-scale point defects can be designed to further enhance the scattering of high-frequency phonons. In Fig. 13, we schematically represent the hierarchical phonon scattering. Thus, by a suitable combination of the sub-microscale grain boundaries, atomic-scale point defects, and electron–phonon interaction, hierarchical phonon scattering centers can be concurrently created in a given material, resulting in a significantly reduced κlattice.

(b) Maximum achievable ZT values and scattering of phonon with different frequencies for the respective length scales. Reproduced from ref. 181. 
Biswas et al.181 achieved ZT ∼ 2.2 at 915 K in the PbTe–4 mol% SrTe–2 mol% Na sample, synthesized by powder processing and SPS method. Phonon scatterings from atomic-scale (alloy scattering), nanoscale (scattering from endotaxial precipitation), and mesoscale (scattering from grain boundaries) were introduced in the system. The origin of ultra-low κlattice in the case of In/Cu co-doped SnTe was explained by Guo et al.182 At room temperatures, Cu2Te precipitates are in the range of hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers in size, and the phonon scattering caused by these precipitates is minimal. As temperature increases, the gradual dissolution of Cu2Te precipitates creates more point defects and nanoprecipitates of several hundred nanometers to tens of nanometers, which strongly scatters the phonons. As a result κlattice ∼ 0.47 Wm−1 K−1 at 873 K was achieved in (SnTe)2.94(In2Te3)0.02–(Cu2Te)0.18. A reduced κlattice ∼ 0.4 Wm−1 K−2 was achieved by Xin et al.183 in Sn0.98V0.02Te. The hierarchical crystal defects and microstructures intensively scattered phonons and resulted in ultra-low κlattice. Wu et al.184 reported that doping Mn with SnTe induces nanoscale precipitates, laminates, stacking faults, and layers, which effectively scatter phonons on multiple length scales, leading to very low lattice thermal conductivities. Wang et al.185 achieved Ultralow κlattice in (Sn0.985In0.015Te)0.90(AgCl)0.1 by using this strategy. Low κlattice ∼ 1.1 Wm−1 K−2 due to collective phonon scattering from mesostructured grain boundaries, nanostructured precipitates, nanostructured defect layers, and solid solution point defects for Ge0.90Bi0.10Te was reported by Perumal et al.174
3.6 Reduction of bipolar thermal conduction
There is another component of κ-which is present in most of the narrow band gap semiconductors (or semimetal or wide band gap semiconductor at elevated temperature) and is denoted by κbipolar, which can be treated as a part of κel. Thermal excitation leads the electrons to move from VB to CB, generating two types of charge carriers (electrons and holes). Due to the thermal excitation, there is almost no change in the number of majority carriers, but the number of minority carriers changes significantly. At this point, two oppositely charged carriers take part in heat and electricity conduction; this phenomenon is called the “Bipolar effect”. This effect shows some negative impacts on the performance of TE materials. Heat is taken away by both types of carriers from the hot side to the cold side. Still, net current is zero as the direction of current flow is opposite to each other. The net Seebeck coefficient is reduced as oppositely charged carriers take part in the conduction process. In this case, Lorenz number can be expressed as32,33,120,129,186,187 (30)And the thermal conductivity for charge carriers can be expressed as (31)
So the fact is, electronic thermal conductivity is not the direct summation of the individual contributions from the two bands (κe, κh). The additional term arises because electrons and holes can move together in the same direction to transport energy, but no net charge is being carried. To achieve better thermoelectric efficiency, this additional component should be reduced. This additional term, κbipolar-is expressed as [subscript ‘e’ and ‘h’ stand for electrons and holes respectively]. (32)
Total electrical conductivity (σ) = σe + σh. It is easy to see that the bipolar contribution is essential only when σe ≈ σh  Say, ηe = η and ηh = −(ηG + η)where, ηG = reduced band gap = η = reduced Fermi energy = ηe-is reduced Fermi energy measured from the CB extremum and, ηh = reduced Fermi energy measured from the VB extremum,188 (33)r-is the scattering parameter, and γ-is a material dependent parameter called the “Grüneisen parameter”. Bipolar heat conduction is usually observed in narrow band gap (Eg ≲ 1 eV) semiconductors where intrinsic electrical conductivity is comparatively larger, and the electronic part of thermal conductivity is more prominent than the lattice part of thermal conductivity. From eqn (33) We can conclude that κbipolar-can be reduced if scattering parameter(r) is decreased, band gap (Eg) is increased, the ratios  are increased, the carrier concentration is increased and hence EF is increased. As the temperature increases, these parameters changes in such a way that κbipolar-increases. Nanoinclusions can reduce bipolar thermal conduction.166 Kim et al. reported that In-doping reduces the bipolar thermal conduction due to the increased Eg of Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3.189 Doping with Mn also helps to reduce bipolar conduction in SnTe.184
4. Recent strategies to search for highly efficient TE materials
A simple model based on effective mass approximation predicts that inelastic scattering in 2D semiconducting materials with step-like DOS can ensure a high power factor.190 The inelastic processes delay the onset of scattering and maximize the utilization of the Fermi window for transport. The simulations showed that the materials with dominant inelastic processes, specifically when optical phonon energy Eph ∼ 5 kBT, improve the power factor. Thus, the material selection rules formulated in such a manner may trigger the researchers to predict and preselect 2D materials, thereby reducing the time and resources in the involved processes. Another crucial factor is atomic disorder, which is present in most high-performance TE materials, and plays an essential role in modulating electronic and thermal transport. The disorder-induced electronic localization has contradictory behavior on σ and S. As the localization increases with increasing disorder, σ-decreases, whereas S-increases Fig. 14. Effectively tuning the disorders can lead to a high PF. Recently, Roychowdhury et al.191 have established the positive effect of the disorder tuning on electronic and phonon transports, simultaneously optimized toward high thermoelectric performance in Cd-doped polycrystalline AgSbTe2. Doing Cd in AgSbTe2 enhances cationic ordering mainly. Enhanced cationic ordering improves electronic properties due to increased localization of electronic states and reduces κlattice by introducing nanoscale superstructures and coupling soft vibrations localized within nanometer range around dopant sites with local strain modulation. They finally achieved ZT ∼ 1.5 near 300 K and a maximum ZT ∼ 2.6 at 573 K in 6 mol% Cd-doped AgSbTe2. Tang et al.192 reported remarkable improvement in TE performance of Sn1/3Pb1/3Ge1/3Te solid solution due to a reduction in κlattice caused by massive disordered cations in this system. The cationic disorder introduced significant mass/strain contrasts for broadening the phonon dispersion and low κlattice was achieved for the entire temperature range. Organic–inorganic composite materials are also promising for TE application. Ju et al.193 prepared SnSe Nanosheets (NSs) by hydrothermal lithium intercalation combined with an exfoliation process from SnSe ingots and then fabricated SnSe NS/PEDOT: PSS composites. ZT reached the maximum value of ∼0.32 when the content of SnSe NS reached 20 wt%.

5. Sn chalcogenides as TE materials
The 16th group elements in the periodic table are usually known as chalcogens. Compounds containing a chalcogen element as an anion and any metal as a cation are commonly called metal chalcogenides. In this review, we will discuss the improvement of TE performance of Tin chalcogenides (SnTe, SnSe, SnS) and Germanium chalcogenides (GeTe, GeSe, GeS) due to the application of various traditional and novel strategies that we have discussed in previous sections. This section has explicitly discussed the progress of Sn-chalcogenide-based materials for TE application in the past years.
5.1 SnTe-based materials

5.1.1 Crystal structure and general transport properties of SnTe. 
SnTe is an extrinsic (p-type) semiconductor. Among chalcogenides of Sn, only SnTe has a rocksalt crystal structure (Fmm) and isotropic thermoelectric properties.194,195 The rocksalt crystal structure of SnTe is shown in Fig. 15a. SnTe has a ferroelectric rhombohedral (R3m) phase which transit to the cubic (Fmm) phase at a carrier concentration-dependent transition temperature, roughly ∼100 K.194 Knox et al.196 reported that SnTe exhibits a crossover to an “emphanitic phase” above 300 K where the sample becomes locally distorted (Sn-off centering), keeping the global symmetry as cubic. SnTe has topological crystalline insulating properties.197–199 Two alternative models have been proposed for the band structure of SnTe.170 The first one is the two-valence-band model (suggested by Allgaier and Scheie).,200 and the second one is the semimetal model (proposed by Sagar and Miller).201 SnTe has a high concentration of Sn-vacancies, and those vacancies act as acceptors. The carrier concentration normally ranges from 1020 cm−3 to 1022 cm−3.202,203 Because of the high concentrations of Sn vacancies, phonons are scattered both by three-phonon Umklapp processes and by the Sn vacancies, this causes κlattice-to vary with temperature as T−1/2 instead of T−1.202 High carrier concentration results in high κlattice ∼ 2.88 Wm−1 K−1 but ultimately Seebeck coefficient reduces and results in a poor ZT (∼0.5 at 873 K).184 At room temperature S-does not decrease with an increase in hole concentration (n) as it generally should be. Instead, it increases from 5–8 μV deg−1 at n = 1–2 × 1020 cm−3 to a maximum of 34 μV deg−1 at n = 8 × 1020 cm−3, after which it decreases to 20.5 μV deg−1 at n = 1.8 × 1021 cm−3 and the maximum value gradually disappears with increasing temperature. At comparatively higher temperature (673–723 K) S-decreases gradually with increasing hole concentration, due to the presence of two nondegenerate VBs [light VB (L) and heavy VB (Σ)].202 The direct band gap is tiny (0.18 eV at room temperature), as shown in Fig. 15b, which leads to a significant Bipolar transport of carriers. The energy difference between light and heavy VB is ∼0.3 eV at room temperature, resisting the heavier holes to contribute to the Seebeck coefficient.195 Under ambient conditions, n-type SnTe has better S-and ZT-than p-type SnTe. An increment in external pressure on n-type SnTe causes an enhancement of its TE performance up to a maximum of 5 GPa then degrades afterward.204 Peng et al. reported the synthesis of n-type SnTe through Pb/I doping. Pb-helped to suppress the high vacancy concentration of SnTe and its electrical transport property was optimized by I-doping.203 Ferroelectricity arises in non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. A local ferromagnetic ordering has been reported above room temperature in rock salt SnTe (centrosymmetric).205 It was concluded that there are two reasons behind this anomaly. One is the local structural distortion due to Sn-off centering, and another is due to the existence of rhombohedral strain in the cubic phase of SnTe. Chang et al.206 thinned SnTe up to 1 unit cell and found a surprising rise in the ferroelectric transition temperature from <100 K in bulk SnTe to 270 K in this ultrathin SnTe film.

5.1.2 TE performance of SnTe based materials. 
The presence of Sn-vacancies causes extremely high carrier (hole) concentration in SnTe, making it a poor TE material with a low Seebeck coefficient and high κel. Introduction of multiscale scattering centers, including atomic-scale point defects (0D), nanoscale endotaxial precipitates, mesoscale grain boundaries, dislocations (1D), nanostructures, and other recently proven strategies of band engineering, including band convergence, resonant level generation, etc. can enhance ZT in SnTe effectively. The maximum value of ZT achieved for different SnTe based materials due to various strategies is schematically represented in Fig. 16 to provide a comparative overview.
 Fig. 16  The highest achieved figure of merit (ZTmax) for different compositions of SnTe-based materials [data taken from Table 2]. 
Hg alloying of SnTe effectively suppressed the bipolar thermal conduction by increasing the band gap; this results in high ZT ∼ 1.35 at 910 K for 2% Bi-doped SnTe with 3% HgTe (Sn0.98 Bi0.02Te–3% HgTe). Here Bi acts as an electron donor dopant.207 As already discussed, stoichiometric SnTe is not a very good thermoelectric material due to its extremely high hole concentration arising from intrinsic crystal defects. One of the strategies to improve the TE performance of SnTe is to reduce its carrier concentration. Tan et al.208 reported that Sn self-compensation could reduce the Sn-vacancies and remarkably decrease the hole density. 3 mol% self-compensation of Sn-resulted in a maximum ZT ∼ 0.6 at 823 K. The solubility limit of Cd in SnTe is around 3% near room temperature. The p-type samples of SnCd0.03Te synthesized by a melting combined with spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique exhibit ZT ∼ 0.96 at 823 K, which is 60% improved than the Cd-free sample. Cd-dopants increase the band gap and reduce the energy offset between light and heavy VBs. Endotaxial CdS or ZnS-nanoscale precipitates reduced the κlattice of SnCd0.03Te without affecting the PF, and a maximum ZT ∼ 1.3 for CdS and ZT ∼ 1.1 for ∼ZnS at 873 K respectively was achieved.208 However, Hg can produce VB degeneracy more effectively than Cd. The class Sn1−xHgxTe exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivities than the same class replacing Hg by Cd. He et al.209 synthesized a series of high quality SnCdxTe (x = 0–0.15) by the zone-melting method. κlattice-reduces with the increase in Cd content and PF ∼ 25 μW cm−1 K−2 and ZT1.03 at 820 K was achieved in SnCd0.12Te. The solubility of CdSe in SnTe increases with increasing temperature. Heavy CdSe-alloying with SnTe causes the convergence of heavy and light VBs, which helps to improve PF. On the other hand, cation–anion point defects and boundary interfaces of CdSe precipitates cause strong phonon scattering and result in a low κlattice ∼ 0.8 Wm−1 K−1 As a result, a high peak ZT ∼ 1.1 is achieved in (SnTe)0.90(CdSe)0.10 at 850 K due to the synergistic effect of improvement in electronic and thermal performances, which demonstrates (SnTe)1−x(CdSe)x as promising TE materials.210
Dopants like, Mn, Sb, Bi,211 In, Mg,212 Zn,213 Ca,214 V,183 I, Gd, and Ag improves TE performance SnTe. He et al.215 reported that alloying with Mn can improve the Seebeck coefficient by suitably modulating the band structure of SnTe. Their work reported a maximum ZT ∼ 1.25 at 920 K for p-type SnMn0.07Te sample synthesized by zone melting method. Sn self-compensation and Mn alloying improved the ZT of SnTe significantly. This process reduces the carrier concentration of SnTe and increases the Seebeck coefficient. Sn1.03−xMnxTe (with, x = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11) class of materials was studied over a temperature range of 300 K to 900 K, and an enhanced ZT ∼ 1.35 was reported for the composition of Sn0.94Mn0.09Te at 873 K.97 Zhou et al.216 synthesized Mn-substituted SnTe and SnO2 nanoinclusions by in situ chemical reactions between the MnO2 additives and SnTe matrix. They achieved a ZT of ∼1.5 at 873 K in the SnTe + 10 mol% MnO2 sample. Tan et al.217 investigated the effect of alloying the Sn-sites in SnTe with Mn using experimental and computational methods. Mn solubility is relatively higher in SnTe (>9%) than that of Cd and Hg. Mn dopant decreases the energy separation between the light and heavy VBs and increases the band gap of SnTe. When the Mn content in SnTe exceeds its solubility limit, MnTe nanoprecipitates are formed. MnTe nanoprecipitates restrict the phonon propagation and reduce the κlattice. From the study on the class of materials Sn1−xMnxTe (x = 0 to 50 mol%), the highest ZT ∼ 1.3 at 900 K was observed for x = 12 mol%. Another work by Wu et al.184 estimated the solubility of Mn in SnTe to be around 13%, and they reported the highest ZT ∼ 1.3 at 900 K for 17% Mn alloyed with SnTe. ZTavg ∼ 0.5 in a temperature range of 600 K to 900 K was achieved in this case. MnTe is a good band convergent to improve the TE performance of SnTe though its solubility is only about 15 at% in SnTe. Additional alloying of SnTe–MnTe with PbTe (i.e., Sn0.8−xMn0.2PbxTe) increases the solubility of MnTe in SnTe and also manipulates different thermoelectric properties of SnTe and results in a very high ZT ∼ 1.5 in SnTe with a 20 at% MnTe and a 30 at% PbTe alloying (Sn0.5Mn0.2Pb0.3Te).218 Solubility of MnTe in SnTe can also be increased up to ∼25% by alloying with 5% GeTe. Further alloying with Cu2Te enabled a sufficient reduction in κlattice to its amorphous limit and ZT ∼ 1.8 above 600 K.75 Sb and Bi act as donors and reduce the Hall carrier concentration and improve TE performance. Sb-is an effective dopant to improve the TE performance of SnTe. Banik et al.219 achieved ZT ∼ 1 for the composition of Sn0.85Sb0.15Te at 800 K. Sb-optimized the hole concentration of SnTe and formed endotaxial Sb-rich nanoprecipitates (2–10 nm) and super-structured intergrowth nano-domains (10–30 nm), which led to a better TE performance by reducing thermal conductivity. Taking Sn0.85Sb0.15Te as the matrix, Fu et al.220 reported that Sb/Mg-alloying resulted in a maximum ZT ∼ 1.02 at 773 K for Sn0.79Sb0.15Mg0.06Te. Comparatively, light element Mg introduces large mass and strain fluctuations in the matrix and also increases band degeneracy. As a result κlattice gets reduced and S enhanced, leading to a better TE performance. Studies of Sn1−xSb2xTe1+2x materials synthesized by melt spinning and SPS technique were done by Yang et al.221 An ultralow κlattice of ∼0.57 Wm−1 K−1 at 773 K and the maximum PF of 24.2 μW cm−1 K−2 at 823 K for Sn0.91Sb0.18Te1.18 (x = 0.09) was achieved. For the same sample, ZT ∼ 0.95 at 823 K was reported, which is 2.2 times higher than that of pure SnTe alloy. Recently AgCl-doping and Sb alloying have been proved to improve the TE performance of SnTe. AgCl-introduces band convergence and increases band gap simultaneously while Sb-optimizes carrier concentration and reduces κlattice. Many properties of SnTe get modified when doped with Bi-to achieve better TE performance. Maximum ZT ∼ 0.87 at 773 K was achieved in (Sn0.81Sb0.19Te)0.93(AgCl)0.07.81 Zhou et al.211 observed reduction in carrier concentration, increase in DOS effective mass, and scattering phonons in a wide frequency range due to Bi-doping. Combining all the advantages, they achieved ZT ∼ 1.1 at 873 K in the Sn0.94Bi0.06Te sample. Studies of the TE properties of nanostructured SnTe with different dopants revealed that In-acts as a remarkably effective dopant to improve the TE performance of SnTe. Zhang et al.175 synthesized In-doped samples of SnTe by ball milling and hot pressing. Doping with In-enhances Seebeck coefficient by introducing resonant states near Fermi level and reduces κlattice by increasing the density of grain boundaries. A minimal amount of In (0.25 atom%) increased the ZT to ∼1.1 at 873 K. Moshwan et al.135 prepared In-doped SnTe samples by facile solvothermal method. ZT ∼ 0.78 and PF ∼ 21.8 μW cm−1 K−2 for Sn0.99In0.01Te was achieved at 773 K. An increase in Seebeck coefficient and reduction in κlattice were observed. Nanoprecipitates and In-rich fcc structured InTe precipitates in the SnTe matrix generate severe strain in the SnTe matrix. In addition to those point defects, dislocations and anharmonicity also cause the significant scattering of heat-carrying phonons resulting in a low κlattice. ZT ∼ 1.2 at 860 K was achieved in a crystalline ingot of p-type Sn0.94Mg0.09Te fabricated by sealed tube melting reactions.212 Zn acts as a resonant dopant for SnTe. For Zn doping, a highest ZT ∼ 1.49 at 840 K, a ZTavg ∼ 0.78 in the range 300–840 K, and ∼1.04 in between 500–840 K was achieved in the Sn0.96Zn0.08Te sample.213 Ca-alloying increases the band gap of SnTe, which restricts bipolar transport, reduces energy difference between heavy and light VB, enhances band convergence and effective mass. Ca-alloying with SnTe results ZT ∼ 1.35 at 873 K, ZTavg ∼ 0.77 in the range 300–900 K, and ∼0.93 in the range 500–900 K in Sn0.94Ca0.09Te.214 A reduced κlattice ∼ 0.4 Wm−1 K−2, an enhanced ZT ∼ 1.3 at 873 K and ZTavg ∼ 0.75 in the temperature range 623–873 K was achieved by Xin et al.183 in Sn0.98V0.02Te. The hierarchical crystal defects and microstructures intensively scattered phonons and resulted in ultra-low κlattice. Zhou et al.222 doped SnTe with I, Gd, and excess Te. They synthesized SnTe1−xIx (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.02), GdySn1−yTe (0 ≤ y ≤ 0.02) and SnTe1+z (0 ≤ Z ≤ 0.015) by melt alloying and hot pressing method. I, Gd, and Te modified its carrier concentration to achieve better TE performance. For SnTe0.985I0.015 sample ZT ∼ 0.6 at 700 K, ZTavg ∼ 0.35 in 300–773 K range along with ZT ∼ 0.4 at 773 K for Gd0.01Sn0.99Te and SnTe1.015 samples was reported in this work. Zhang et al.223 reported the highest ZT ∼ 1.1 at 873 K in the 11 atom% Ag-doped Gd0.06Sn0.94Te sample. Gd-introduces nano/mesoscale defects in the SnTe matrix, and Ag-improves the PF by optimizing carrier concentration.
Co-doping by two or more different dopants with SnTe is an effective way to enhance the TE performance of pristine SnTe. Co-doping shows synergistic effects to improve the TE performance of SnTe. In the case of In/Mn co-doping, an enhanced Seebeck coefficient of 116 μV K−1 at 300 K and a maximum ZT ∼ 1.15 at 823 K were observed in Sn0.915Mn0.11In0.005Te. The PF improves with an increase in the In-content for Sn0.92−xMn0.11InxTe class of samples. An increase in PF from 7.44 to 8.68 μW cm−1 K−2 for change in x from 0 to 0.0005 was observed at room temperature.225 Tan et al.226 reported that In/Cd co-doping and introducing nanoscale precipitations by CdS nanostructuring could improve the ZT value of SnTe. In-dopants modify the band structure by creating the resonance energy levels at the VB at low temperatures. Cd-dopants increase the band gap and make light and heavy hole VBs of SnTe converge at mid-temperature and high-temperature regimes. CdS significantly improves phonon scattering leading towards a low κlattice. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.4 at 923 K was achieved for Sn0.97In0.015Cd0.015Te nanostructured with 3% CdS. Moshwan et al.227 synthesized Sn(CdIn)xTe1+2x microcrystals by a facile solvothermal method. The presence of point defects, nanoprecipitates, lattice distortion, and grain boundaries in the system reduces κlattice significantly. A low κlattice ∼ 1.84 Wm−1 K−1, high PF ∼ 26.76 μW cm−1 K−2, and maximum ZT ∼ 1.12 (for x = 0.03) at 773 K was achieved. Sn1.04−2xMgxInxTe materials were synthesized by co-doping In/Mg with SnTe using modified self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) and spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. A high PF ∼ 42 μW cm−1 K−2 and a high ZT ∼ 1.5 at 840 K for x = 0.03 make it a very efficient material for thermoelectric applications.228 As an effect of co-doping of SnTe with In/Ca, the TE performance of SnTe was improved. The resonant levels introduced by In, the band gap opening by Ca, the VB convergence induced by Ca and In-synergistically increase the Seebeck coefficient for a wide range of temperatures. The ZT values in the case of Sn1.04−3xCa2xInxTe fabricated by SHS and direct current sintering (DCS), increases with an increase in doping concentration (from x = 0.00 to x = 0.04). High PF ∼ 47 μW cm−1 K−2, maximum ZT ∼ 1.65 at 840 K and a ZTavg ∼ 0.87 considering 500 K and 840 K as cold and hot end temperatures respectively were obtained for x = 0.04.229 Co-doping by In/Sr has been reported to increase the TE performance of pristine SnTe effectively. Sn1−3xInxSr2xTe samples were prepared by a facile solvothermal method. A low κlattice ∼ 0.57 Wm−1 K−1, PF ∼ 31.88 μW cm−1 K−2, and ZT ∼ 1.31 at 823 K were obtained for x = 0.025 later, and two quantities were respectively 121% and 364% higher than that of the undoped SnTe.230 High-level In and Ag co-dopants can remarkably converge two VBs and increase the density of states near the Fermi level, and this leads to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient from 95 μV K−1 in the pristine SnTe to 178 μV K−1 and ZT ∼ .38 at 823 K in Sn0.85In0.05Ag0.10Te sample fabricated by facile solvothermal method.231 For the class of samples, SnAgxInxTe1+2x Banik et al.232 reported a maximum ZT ∼ 1 and a significantly large thermoelectric PF ∼ 31.4 μW cm−1 K−2 for x = 0.025 at 856 K. In/Cu co-doping can enhance PF of SnTe and reduce κlattice as well. Guo et al.182 reported that In-dopant induces resonant level and multiple scales of Cu2Te nanoprecipitates, and Cu interstitials enhance phonon scattering. As a result, PF ∼ 29 μW cm−1 K−2, and ZT ∼ 1.55 at 873 K was achieved in (SnTe)2.94(In2Te3)0.02–(Cu2Te)0.18. In recent work, Wang et al.185 have shown that doping with In with pristine SnTe introduces resonance level, enhancing electrical transport properties. Further (Sn0.985In0.015Te)1−x(AgCl)x samples (with, x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) were synthesized via facile microwave wet-chemical method and SPS. The addition of AgCl introduces different hierarchical structures like grain boundaries, nanopores, nanoprecipitates, and dislocations. As a result, phonon scattering increases remarkably and κlattice is reduced gradually from pristine SnTe to Sn0.985In0.015Te and then to (Sn0.985In0.015Te)1−x(AgCl)x. For (Sn0.985In0.015Te)0.90(AgCl)0.10 sample κlattice ∼0.245 Wm−1 K−1 was recorded, breaking the “amorphous limit” and achieving ZT ∼ 0.86 at 823 K. Lu et al.233 reported the result of In/Pb co-doping with SnTe. Sn0.99−xPb0.01InxTe (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) samples were synthesized by facile hydrothermal method. ZT ∼ 0.7 at 873 K in Sn0.96Pb0.01In0.03Te was achieved. Roychowdhury et al.234 worked on Sn0.70Pb0.30Te sample and improved its TE performance via Cd-and In-doping. Doping with Pb-synergistically enhances TE properties of SnTe by forming resonant levels and effectively converging VBs. Sn0.70Pb0.30Te-holds better TE properties than pristine SnTe. Further doping with 3% Cd-and 0.25% In-leads to a maximum ZT ∼ 0.82 at 654 K where Cd-and In-acts as a VB convergent and a resonant dopant, respectively. In/Hg co-doped SnTe has promising TE properties. The interplay between band convergence and resonant levels can be optimized for the PF of the system. For the Sn0.98Bi0.02Te–1% HgInTe2 sample, the peak ZT ∼ 0.9 was achieved at 850 K.235 Guo et al.236 improved the TE performance of SnTe by co-doping with Ce and Li. On the Sn0.98Ce0.02Te matrix, the content of Li2Te was adjusted, and ZT ∼ 1 at 873 K and ZTavg ∼ 0.39 from 300 K to 873 K was achieved in Sn0.98Ce0.02Te-(Li2Te)0.01 Sample. Tian et al.112 fabricated Ag-plated SnTe bulk using facile chemical electroless plating and SPS methods. They achieved ZT ∼ 0.67 at 823 K for 2 wt% Ag-plated SnTe. Partially doped Ag-atoms reduce Sn-vacancy concentration. Nano/microscale Ag-precipitates form Ag/SnTe interfaces, those act as energy filtering barriers to filter the negative contribution of low-energy carriers to the Seebeck coefficient. Another way to optimize the thermoelectric performance of SnTe is to make a composite of SnTe with a compound that holds the counter thermoelectric properties as of SnTe, and one such compound is CuInTe2. The most optimized recorded properties are for CuSnxInTex+2 when x = 7, with an enhanced figure of merit ZT ∼ 1.0 at 873 K.237 Alloying SnTe with different compounds can enhance its TE performance. Alloying AgI is also effective in enhancing the TE performance of SnTe. In work reported by Banik et al.,238ZT ∼ 1.05 was achieved at 856 K for 5 mol% of AgI doping with SnTe. This co-doping helps to increase the band gap, decrease the energy offset between two types of VBs, and induces effective convergence of the VBs. Tan et al.239 alloyed SnTe with AgBiTe2 by melting and SPS method. Samples of AgSnxBiTex+2 composition show a reduction in the hole concentration than in pristine SnTe when AgBiTe2 is added in a small fraction (x = 25). After a certain limit, the hole concentration starts to increase again due to the transition from solid
solution to phase segregation and the reduction in the band gap. A high ZT ∼ 1.1 was achieved at 775 K for the sample with x = 15. He et al.240 synthesized SnTe–AgSbSe2 by a zone-melting method and added 5% Cd to reduce the carrier concentration and tune the band structure of SnTe. They achieved ZT ∼ 0.92 at 820 K in SnCd0.05Te–3% AgSbSe2. Even a minimal amount of doping (∼5%) with rare earth material Yb causes effective band convergence and increases DOS near Fermi level in SnTe.241 SnTe/PbSe, SnTe/PbS, EuTe/PbTe superlattices and SnEuTe films also show better thermoelectric properties than bulk SnTe.110 Wu et al.242 reported a ZT ∼ 0.7 at 675 K in an AgPb9Sn9SbTe20 sample fabricated by MA and plasma-activated sintering (PAS) technique. Later, p-type semimetallic TAST-m system or (SnTe)m(AgSbTe2) composition materials were also found to have promising TE performance and Pb free. Han et al.243 reported ZT ∼ 1 at 710 K for m = 4 sample. Using mechanical alloying and Co-ball-milling, Falkenbach et al.244 observed promising TE performance in this class of materials. Xu et al.245 fabricated single-crystalline SnTe nanowires using the thermal vapor deposition method. They studied different nanowires with diameters ranging from 218 nm to 913 nm in a temperature range of 25 K to 300 K. Measurements of electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of these individual systems show that electrical conductivity does not have a strong diameter dependence, but the Seebeck coefficient increases by a factor of two when the nanowire diameter decreases from 913 nm to 218 nm the Seebeck coefficient reaches 41 μV K−1 at 300 K for the thinnest nanowire. That means thermal conductivity has remarkable dependence on nanowire's diameter and is lower than regular bulk SnTe. Enhanced phonon-surface boundary scattering and phonon-defect scattering are the probable causes for this result.

5.2 SnSe-based materials

5.2.1 Crystal structure and general transport properties of SnSe. 
SnSe-based materials are applicable as optoelectronic,246,247 photovoltaic, phase change memory alloys, and in TE devices. Unlike cubic SnTe, SnSe possesses a layered orthorhombic (a ≠ b ≠ c, α = β = γ = 90°) crystal structure (space group Pnma) at room temperature.248–250 Crystal structure in this phase can be derived from a three-dimensional distortion of the rock-salt crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 17a–c.
 Fig. 17  Crystal structure of SnSe at Pnma phase (a) projection along c-axis, (b) projection along b-axis, (c) projection along a-axis (data taken from ref. 248). (d) Coordination polyhedron of Sn-in Pnma phase up to 4.1 Å. 
Each atom in this phase has the coordination environment of a heavily distorted octahedron, and the lattice is deformed NaCl type and shows anisotropic TE properties and strong phononic anharmonicity.137 SnSe is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor having an indirect band gap of ∼0.9 eV and a direct band gap of ∼1.3 eV.251,252 The lattice parameters reported for the Pnma phase are a ≈ 11.501 Å, b ≈ 4.153 Å, and c ≈ 4.445 Å.248 The band structure of SnSe is very complex. From reported DFT calculation for the Pnma phase shows that the energy difference between the first and second VB is ∼0.06 eV while between the first and third is ∼0.13 eV. From the same DFT calculation, the effective mass on different VB was estimated to be  for the first VB band and  for the second VB. So it is clear that the second VB is heavier than the first VB.253 Each cell contains two double layers perpendicular to the longest axis (here a-axis). Each layer is formed by zigzag planes of Sn–Se chains extending in two dimensions. The double-layer is held by a network of covalent bonds, whereas the interaction between two double layers is weak. The bonding between the layers is weak van der Waals type. The easy cleavage in this system is along with the (l00) planes. At the Pnma phase, each Sn atom shares six different types of interactions with its neighboring atoms (seven Se atoms and two Sn atoms and vice versa for the neighboring of each Se atom). Due to lone-pair, the structure contains highly distorted SnSe7 coordination polyhedra (containing three short and four very long Sn–Se bonds) due to lone-pair.254 Two types of interaction among those are strong. They involve short Sn–Se distances (2.7–2.8 Å) as d1, d2 (twice), two interactions involve intermediate Sn–Se distances (3.3–3.4 Å) as d3 (twice), d4, one interaction of distance (3.5 Å) as d5 (twice) between Sn–Sn contacts and an additional Sn–Se interaction of distance (4.1 Å) as d6, as shown in Fig. 17d.
As temperature increases, a continuous displacive structural phase transition occurs towards the Cmcm phase, spreading over 200 K below the critical temperature of 807 K. Around 807 K SnSe enters a five-fold coordinated Cmcm phase, as shown in Fig. 18a–c. Lattice parameters in this phase are a ≈ 4.310 Å, b ≈ 11.705 Å, c ≈ 4.318 Å, and the crystal structure has higher symmetry.250,255 From the first principle calculation, Dewandre et al.256 reported that this Cmcm-phase is only stabilized when the anharmonicity is considered, and the origin of enhancement of carrier concentration and the nature of the phase transition was also explained. Using first-principle calculation and Boltzmann transport equation, Wu et al.157 studied SnSe and found that spin–orbit coupling (SOC) significantly influences phonon anharmonicity. SOC-weakens phonon anharmonicity and reduces the delocalization of the resonant bonding network. As a result κlattice is enhanced up to ∼60%. In the Cmcm phase, the atoms form double layers similar to those in the Pnma phase. Each atom is now coordinated to four neighboring atoms at an equal distance,254 but in each layer, all Sn–Se bonds are stacked parallel, and the stacking is continued perpendicular to the b axis along with the layer (with d2 = d3 and d4 = d6), as shown in Fig. 18d. Due to this structural phase change, SnSe is applicable as phase-change memory alloys. The anisotropy of the crystal structure shows an effect on the electronic and thermal transport properties. The complex crystal structure of SnSe is the leading cause of its low lattice thermal conductivity. Shi et al.257 calculated the Pnma phase to have an indirect band gap of ∼0.829 eV and Cmcm to have a direct band gap of ∼0.464 eV, as shown in Fig. 19. The significantly smaller band gap in the Cmcm phase leads to increased bipolar conduction at high temperatures, declining its Seebeck coefficient. SnSe and similar class compounds were previously ignored in thermoelectrics due to their low electrical conductivity and ZT values. The decrease in lattice thermal conductivity with increasing temperature along all crystallographic directions suggests that lattice anharmonicity is an important phonon scattering mechanism in this compound.138,149,258

In some research works, the origin of p-type nature in SnSe was tried to be described. According to Huang et al.,259 the DFT calculations of the formation energy and electronic properties of intrinsic defects of SnSe, including two vacancies (VSn and VSe), two interstitials (Sni and Sei), and two antisites (SnSe and SeSn) indicates that VSn can act as an effective source for p-type conduction under both Sn-rich and Se-rich conditions due to relatively low formation energy as well as a desirable ultra-shallow transition energy level.258–260 No such effective sources were found to initiate intrinsic n-type conduction. According to Duvjir et al.260 (Fig. 20), the most dominant VSn shift the Fermi energy level inside the dispersive VB and produce extra holes. On the other hand, VSe creates a nondispersive donor level and localized electrons, neighboring only two Sn atoms and a VSe site. In other words, VSe does not donate electron carriers in SnSe but generates immobile electrons localized within only a few angstroms of the vacancy site. So VSe cannot result in n-type characteristics in SnSe VSe–Sn–Se creates two fragile nondispersive flat bands, one band is occupied, and the other is empty. So VSe–Sn–Se acts similar to VSe, and overall, SnSe shows p-type properties. In 2018 Li et al.,261 with the help of first-principles calculations combined with the semi-classical Boltzmann theory, theoretically demonstrated the effect of a carrier concentration of different phases of p-type SnSe. ZT increases with the increase in carrier concentration in the range 1 × 1017 cm−3 to 1 × 1019 cm−3. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.62 at 723 K was achieved along the Pnma phase b-axis for a carrier concentration of 1.75 × 1019 cm−3 and Cmcm phase b-axis the maximum ZT ∼ 4.35 at 923 K was achieved with carrier concentration of 1.82 × 1019 cm−3.

At ambient conditions, SnSe crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pnma phase. Not only temperature but also externally applied pressure affects the phase transition of SnSe. In earlier times, Chattopadhyay et al.262 reported that there would be no phase transition if the external pressure is applied on SnSe up to 34Gpa. Still, later Alptekin reported a phase transition at 7 GPa from orthorhombic Pnma to Cmcm phase.263 Agarwal et al.264 observed a pressure-dependent electrical resistance and Seebeck coefficient and found the behavioral change of these parameters at 6.5 GPa. Loa et al.265 found evidence of second-order structural phase change towards a higher symmetry space group under the high external pressure of 10.5(3)GPa in SnSe. Later, de Souza et al.266 observed nanostructured SnSe samples under a pressure variation up to 18 GPa. The study of cell parameter variation and enthalpy calculation found a phase transition near 4 GPa. After 8.2 GPa up to 18 GPa, there was no sign of phase transition. Ghosh et al.,267 in 2016, theoretically investigated the effect of high pressure on fully-relaxed samples of SnSe and got 4 GPa as the critical pressure for structural phase transition. Additionally, they found that the resistivity is highest along a-axis and lowest along b-axis, although conductivity increases with increased pressure. The semimetallic nature followed by the orthorhombic → monoclinic structural transition of SnSe above 12.6 GPa was reported by Yan et al.268 That semiconducting-semimetallic transition brought an abrupt change in carrier concentration as well as mobility of the charge carriers. Later, Xie et al.269 reported a structural phase transition ∼8 GPa and a semiconductor to semimetal electronic transition followed by a Pnma to Cmcm structural transition ∼12 GPa. According to Yang et al.,270 there is a phase transition from Pnma to Cmcm at 22 GPa. With further increase in external pressure, various novel crystal structures of SnSe were found (Pmm, C2/m, and Cmmm), only Pnma phase is semiconductor among them, and other phases are metallic. Despite so many theoretical and experimental studies, the critical pressure to initiate the phase transition is still ambiguous; this may be due to inherent microstructures or defects in the system. Monolayer (2D) SnSe also attracted tremendous attention in recent years for its promising TE properties.
Hu et al.271 designed five allotropes (honeycomb structured) of monolayer SnSe, namely α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-SnSe. Except ε-SnSe other allotropes are indirect band gap semiconductors. Though TE properties of α-SnSe were reported before, using the ab initio DFT method, they found all the new allotropes (β, γ, δ) have even better TE properties. The predicted ZT value for the β-SnSe phase was ∼2.06 at 300 K, which was remarkable. Later Haq et al.272 reported their study on optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications of these honeycomb allotropes. TE properties of SnSe in the mid-temperature range can be further improved by applying a slight hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial stress. In 2016 Zhang et al.273 reported their work on improving TE performance of Pnma-SnSe in all three crystal directions by applying external pressure. They showed that below 700 K applying external pressure of 6 GPa, the ZT values of p-type materials could reach ∼2.5 and ∼1.7 along b- and c-directions respectively and at the same pressure and 600 K temperature n-type conduction resulted along a direction with a ZT value of ∼1.7 at 600 K. In 2017 Rehman et al.274 reported the change in structural and optical (near/mid-infrared region) properties of cubic-SnSe due to applying external pressure up to 40 GPa. According to the report, the structural parameters decrease gradually with increased pressure in the range of 0–40 GPa. For cubic-SnSe, the band gap showed direct nature at 0 GPa, indirect nature from 5 GPa to 30 GPa, and metallic nature from 35 GPa to 40 GPa. Application of pressure can reduce the Pnma to Cmcm phase transition temperature effectively. Yu et al.275 in 2016 noticed a reduced transition temperature to ∼500 K at 4 GPa hydrostatic pressure. Band gaps of both phases vary inversely with pressure, and at 8 GPa, the SnSe band gap vanishes. This external pressure reduces the Grüneisen parameter, and the maximum reduction takes place along a-axis. Hence, κlattice increases due to the increase in hydrostatic pressure. External pressure does not affect κel remarkably as its value in Pnma-phase was inherently very small. 4 GPa pressure cannot change κtotal significantly which is advantageous to increase ZT. Uniaxial stress > 3.5 GPa along c-axis also can cause Pnma to Cmcm structural phase transition. Another work by Gusmão et al.276 reported that ZT reduces due to the external pressure. They studied SnSe-Pnma crystals below 750 K temperature under P = 0, 4, 7, 10 GPa. Improvement in TE performance of single-crystal and polycrystalline SnSe based materials due to applying different strategies is discussed in the next section.


5.2.2 TE performance of SnSe based materials. 
5.2.2.1 p-Type single-crystal SnSe. 
Single-crystal samples are advantageous than polycrystalline samples in some aspects. In single-crystal, the disturbance of grain boundary scattering and “texture” on the effects of dopants can be avoided. In a comparative study, Jin et al.277 reported a higher ZT ∼ 0.92 for single-crystal SnSe than ZT ∼ 0.5 for polycrystalline SnSe near 793 K. Agarwal et al.278 fabricated Single crystals of SnSe by a direct vapor transport and a chemical vapor transport method. They observed anisotropy in D.C. electrical resistivity for the first time in layered SnSe crystals. Shi et al.257 reported detailed band structure and various TE parameters of single-crystal SnSe. Later single-crystal anisotropic SnSe has attracted significant attention due to its record high value of ZT = 2.6 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.3 and 0.8 ± 0.2 at 923 K (at Cmcm phase) measured along the b-, c- and a-axis respectively of the room-temperature Pnma-orthorhombic unit cell by Zhao et al.138 In that work, crystal parameters in the Pnma phase were taken as a = 11.49 Å, b = 4.44 Å, c = 4.135 Å, and in the Cmcm phase, those as a = 4.31 Å, b = 11.70 Å, c = 4.31 Å. Larger values of the Grüneisen parameter, i.e., strong anharmonicity in bonding, give rise to κlattice in ordered crystal structures, high carrier mobility, large Seebeck coefficient, and extremely κlattice along b- and c-axes leads to higher ZT values. The plot shows that the average Grüneisen parameter is the maximum along a-axis. In any direction κtot-decreases with increasing temperature, and at 973 K, all measured values were <0.4 Wm−1 K−1. Hole-doped SnSe is a promising thermoelectric material in the temperature range 300 K to 773 K. SnSe has non-parabolic and complex multiband valence states. Heavy p-type doping presses the Fermi level into the multiple VBs, makes them participate in the conduction process, and effectively enhances the Seebeck coefficient. The Seebeck coefficient increases from ∼+160 μV K−1 to ∼+300 μV K−1, electrical conductivity decreases from 1486 S cm−1 to 148 S cm−1 and PF also decreases from ∼40 μW cm−1 to ∼14 μW cm−1 as temperature increases from 300 K to 773 K. The highest ZT ∼ 1.34 was achieved in a device application with the hot side at 773 K and the cold side at 300 K.253 Hole doping in single-crystal of SnSe by using Na atoms as acceptors shows an increment in hole concentration up to two orders of magnitude and ZT up to ∼0.7 along the b-axis at 300 K and ZTmax ∼ 2 at 773 K.253 Enhanced thermoelectric performance was observed in the temperature range from 300 K to 800 K by doping p-type single crystals of SnSe with Na and Ag. Doping SnSe is difficult because of its layered anisotropic structure, where each SnSe layer is two atoms thin, and locally distorted bonding is present around the Sn and Se atoms. This doping lowers the Fermi level and increases the number of carrier pockets in SnSe, which collaboratively optimize the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. The Seebeck coefficient of Na-doped crystals is comparatively smaller than the Seebeck coefficient of Ag-doped crystals. Additionally, the Seebeck coefficient of Sn0.99Na0.01Se is greater than that of Sn0.98Na0.02Se and Sn0.97Na0.03Se, which means increased doping concentration with Na leads to a reduced Seebeck coefficient in single-crystal SnSe. Still, the higher electrical conductivity of the Na-doped samples yields much larger power factors than the Ag-doped SnSe crystals. For the highest 3% Na-doped Sn0.97Na0.03Se crystal, PF reaches as high as ∼2.8 mW m−1 K−2 at room temperature and is greater than 1.38 mW m−1 K−2 in the whole working temperature range. The κlattice ∝ T−1, which is the sign of the dominance of Umklapp phonon processes. Over the temperature range from 300 K to 800 K, the ZTavg ∼ 1.17 is obtained for the Sn0.97Na0.03Se crystal with a maximum ZT ∼ 2 at 800 K.279 Later in another work, Wang et al.280 studied the result of Na and Ag doping on single-crystal SnSe prepared by a modified Bridgman method at a low-temperature regime. They found that Na is more effective in increasing the carrier concentration of SnSe. 1 at% Na-doping increases the carrier concentration up to ∼1.8 × 1019 cm−3 at 300 K and causes a ZT ∼ 0.33 at 350 K. Ag-doped SnSe single-crystal was prepared by a novel horizontal Bridgman method. Still, doping of single-crystal SnSe with Ag has a lesser effect on lattice thermal conductivity than doping with Na because Ag (z = 49) and Sn (z = 50) atoms have almost an equal size. Therefore Ag atoms have minimal effect on the phonon scattering mechanism. On the other hand, the size difference and mass difference of Na and Sn atoms significantly affect phonons' scattering. The highest ZT along a-axis was measured for Sn0.97Ag0.03Se to be ∼0.95 at 793 K, mainly due to the low κlattice near the Pnma–Cmcm phase transition temperature.281 Wei et al.282 prepared very high quality, fully dense SnSe single-crystals. DFT calculations showed an increase in band gap with an increase in temperature and metal to semiconductor transition at 600 K. Maximum ZT ∼ 1.0 at 850 K was observed along b-axis. Liu et al.283 reported the effect of Te doping on the Se-sites of single-crystal SnSe. They prepared Sn-rich Te doped SnSe single-crystals by a modified Sn self-flux method. Te-doping showed an effect on band gap as well as the carrier concentration. Though having almost the same cation/anion-ratio in Sn1.17Se and Sn1.17Se0.97Te0.027 have a significant difference in κlattice. Lowest κlattice was achieved in the Sn1.17Se0.97Te0.027 sample, and considering the result, for other samples, it was concluded that, κlattice-decreases with increasing Sn/(Se + Te) ratio.
5.2.2.2 n-Type single-crystal SnSe. 
The undoped SnSe is p-type with a carrier concentration of ∼5.3 × 1017 cm−3 at 300 K.284 Duong et al.285 fabricated p-type SnSe with carrier concentration of ∼5.2 × 1018 cm−3 at 773 K and reported that Bi-doping on Sn-sites turns it into n-type SnSe single crystals with carrier concentration that depends on Bi-content. In this case, a maximum ZT of ∼2.2 was achieved along b-axis (here, a = 11.49 Å, b = 4.44 Å, c = 4.14 Å) at 733 K with an n-type carrier concentration of 2.1 × 1019 cm−3 at 773 K. Pb dopant is also used to synthesize n-type SnSe single crystal successfully via a facile Sn-flux route. For the greater atomic radius of Pb (Z = 82), the formation of SnSe antisite defects is reduced, and hence it induces more Se vacancy (VSe). These vacancies are generated more with increasing Pb content in the samples and act as donors making the system show n-type conduction. Due to this doping, the majority of carriers are changed from hole to electron. The carrier concentration decreased from 4.2 × 1017 cm−3 in p-type SnSe to 3.3 × 1017 cm−3 in p-type Sn0.85+5Pb0.15Se and then increased to 4.1 × 1017 cm−3 in n-type Sn0.1+5Pb0.9Se. A maximum PF of ∼1.2 μW cm−1 K−1 was obtained at room temperature.286 Using DFT calculations, Tang et al.286 showed that due to the more robust metallic nature of Pb, the electrons become delocalized around Sn-atom, suggesting a much higher degree of electron delocalization in the Pb doped SnSe. Chang et al.287 reported an ultralow thermal conductivity with an outstanding PF and a maximum ZT ∼ 2.8 at 773 K in out-of-plane Br doped n-type SnSe crystal. Improvement in ZT of single-crystal (n- and p-type) SnSe-based materials is schematically represented in Fig. 21.
 Fig. 21  The highest achieved figure of merit (ZTmax) for different compositions of Single-crystal SnSe-based materials [data taken from ref. 138, 253, 277, 279–282, 285 and 287]. 
5.2.2.3 p-Type polycrystalline SnSe. 
Compared to single crystals of SnSe, lower PF is observed in polycrystalline samples of SnSe. Very low ZT ∼ 0.5 at about 823 K for undoped polycrystalline SnSe was reported by Sassi et al.258,288 Recently, hole-doped SnSe polycrystalline samples with reagents carefully purified and tin oxides removed were reported to exhibit ZT ∼ 3.1 at 783 K, which is even higher than reported ZTs for single crystal SnTe to date.289 Zhang et al.290 achieved ZT ∼ 0.47 at 703 K for polycrystalline SnSe samples synthesized by the SPS method at a sintering temperature of 823 K. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.3 and a very low κ ∼ 0.26 Wm−1 K−1 at 850 K was achieved by Tang et al.291 in a p-type polycrystalline SnSe sample fabricated by hydrothermal synthesis and SPS methods. The presence of cubic rock-salt-type precipitated phase was found inside the bulk polycrystalline SnSe sample. This new material features a microstructural hierarchy of nanoprecipitates coupled with mesoscale microstructures, which significantly reduces thermal conductivity and results in a higher value of ZT. Chen et al.292 synthesized Ag-doped p-type polycrystalline SnSe by melting and hot pressing. Doping SnSe with Ag increases its carrier concentration and reaches a maximum of 9 × 1018 cm−3 for 3% Ag doping on Sn-sites; this concentration is greater than that in undoped SnSe. Irrespective of doping, hysteresis is seen in resistivity between heating and cooling. Temperature-independent DOS effective mass was found to be 0.75 me. For the sample Ag0.01Sn0.99Se, ZT ∼ 0.6 at 750 K was achieved. Samples of composition NaxSn1−xSe with x = 0, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.03 were prepared by doping the SnSe sample by-Na by Chere et al.293via hot-pressing technique. A remarkably high room temperature carrier concentration of ∼2.67 × 1019 cm−3 was obtained for x = 0.02, and the highest PF was obtained for x = 0.015 samples. A peak ZT ∼ 0.8 was achieved at 773 K along the hot pressing direction. Co-doping of p-type polycrystalline SnSe with Na and Ag also effectively enhances the TE performance of SnSe. Wang et al.294 prepared Na0.02−xAgxSn0.98Se (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02) class of samples via melting, annealing, and SPS methods. Carrier concentration was weakly temperature-dependent, and at room temperature, it reached a maximum of ∼2.66 × 1019 cm−3 for x = 0.005. The maximum PF ∼ 0.50 mW cm−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 0.81 at 773 K was reported for Na0.005Ag0.015Sn0.98Se. PFavg ∼ 0.43 mW cm−1 K−2 and ZTavg ∼ 0.37 from 300 K to 773 K were achieved for the same sample. For the samples of composition SnSe1−xTex fabricated by melting and hot pressing, Chen et al.295 reported a decrease in band gap and an increase in lattice parameters. 6.25% Te doping can reduce the band gap from 0.643 eV to 0.608 eV for. The changing trend of the absolute Seebeck coefficient is consistent with that of the electrical conductivity of the samples as temperature increases; this is different from the behavior of the common TE materials and can be explained with the concept of phonon-drag effect as carrier concentration of the samples is less than 1017 cm−3. Te-doping is not that much efficient to improve the electrical transport properties of pristine SnSe. From this study, a maximum PF ∼ 0.7 mW cm−1 K−2 at 673 K was achieved. Wei et al.296 fabricated Na-doped SnSe1−xTex polycrystalline samples [0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2] using MA-SPS method. Doping with Na increases the carrier concentration from ∼7 × 1017 cm−3 to ∼1 × 1019 cm−3. It was found that p-type carriers have higher average energy, and they can easily get out of the traps caused by the defects at the grain boundary, which leads to higher mobility. Though Na-doping increases κ by enhancing its electronic part, it still enhances ZT greater than in pristine SnSe. A maximum ZT ∼ 0.72 for Sn0.99Na0.01Se0.84Te0.16 at 773 K was recorded. 1% K-doped SnSe polycrystalline sample was synthesized by combining mechanical alloying and SPS techniques by Chen et al.,297 and TE properties were investigated over the temperature range of 300 K to 773 K. Maximum electrical conductivity (∼3.76Scm−1), Hall mobility (∼2.55 cm2 V−1 S−1), and carrier concentration (∼9.2 × 1018 cm−3) were recorded for 1% K-doped and 8 hours of the ball-milled sample. For the same sample, an enhanced ZT ∼ 1.1 at 773 K was measured along the sample section perpendicular to the pressing direction of SPS. K-doping resulted in ZTavg ∼ 0.5 from 300 K to 773 K. Alkali-ion doping with p-Type polycrystalline SnSe shows that among Na, K, and Li-ion, the most effective is to dope with Na ion to optimize electrical properties. Hall carrier concentration due to 1% Na, K, or Li doping reaches 4.4 × 1019 cm−3, 9 × 1017 cm−3, and 1.1 × 1019 cm−3 respectively at room temperature. ZT ∼ 0.85 was achieved in 1% Na-doped, and ZT ∼ 0.80 was achieved in 1% K-doped samples at 800 K.298 Synergistic manipulation of the band structure and atomic-scale defect phonon scattering by co-doping of p-type polycrystalline SnSe was reported by Ge et al.299 to boost the TE performances of SnSe. The energy offsets of multiple VBs in SnSe were decreased when doped with Na and further decreased by co-doping with Na and K. Here, Na was selected as a dopant to enhance the electrical transport properties in addition to that K was selected as a co-dopant with Na to reduce the thermal conductivity, and the samples were synthesized via mechanical alloying and SPS. This work reported a maximum ZT ∼ 1.2 for (0.5% Na + 0.5% K) co-doped polycrystalline SnSe at 773 K. Li et al.300 co-doped polycrystalline SnSe with Na/K, Na/Li and Na/Ag differently. Maximum improved TE properties were found for Na/Ag co-doped SnSe. A carrier concentration ∼ 6.23 × 1019 cm−3 at 335 K, PF ∼ 0.73 mW m−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 1.2 at 785 K for Sn0.98Na0.016Ag0.004Se were achieved. ZTavg ∼ 0.74 was observed in a temperature range of 335–785 K. NaCl-doping can improve the TE performance of polycrystalline SnSe. Yang et al. prepared samples of composition Sn1−xNaxSeClx by combined rapid induction melting and rapid hot-pressing technique. For 0.5 mol% NaCl-doping, the room temperature carrier concentration reached a high value of ∼3.95 × 1019 cm−3. 2 mol% NaCl-doping resulted in an improved electrical conductivity ∼ 102.5Scm−1 at 473 K. The lowest κlattice ∼ 0.27 Wm−1 K−1 at 810 K was recorded for 4 mol% NaCl doping, and the probable cause of this low value is the high phonon scattering by the nanoscale defects formed due to the presence of Cl atoms. A maximum ZT ∼ 0.84 was achieved at 810 K for 0.5 mol% NaCl-doping.301 In-is an effective dopant to improve the TE performance of various materials. In contrast to the usual results, Kim et al.302 observed a decrement in carrier concentration and increment in the band gap of SnSe due to In-doping. So PF also decreased but observed κ-values were lower than that of undoped SnSe. Shi et al.303 reported an extraordinary TE performance in polycrystalline SnSe with nanopores. The basic sample was synthesized via a facile solvothermal method. InSey nanoprecipitates were induced in the SnSe matrix. Those nanoprecipitates decomposed and generated nanopores in the SnSe matrix under high temperature, pressure, and vacuum during the SPS process. The final result was nanoporous SnSe. The low thermal conductivity value comes from the effective phonon scatterings and thermal radiation at interfaces associated with the nanopores, interfaces, and grain boundaries. High hole concentration ∼
1.34 × 1019 cm−3 was introduced due to high Sn-vacancies by self-doping. Finally, a high PF ∼ 5.06 μW cm−1 K−2, low κ ∼ 0.24 Wm−1 K−1, and ZT ∼ 1.7 at 823 K were achieved for a sample with ∼4% volume fraction of nanopores. Doping polycrystalline p-type SnSe with Ge improves its thermoelectric performance than the pristine SnSe. In a report by Wubieneh et al.,304 polycrystalline (Sn1−xGex) Se specimens were prepared by melting and spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. This doping results in an enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and also a reduction of the thermal conductivity. A maximum ZT ∼ 0.77 was obtained at 800 K for (Sn0.99Ge0.01)Se. Introduction of Grain Boundaries (GB) significantly affects thermoelectric performance because of the scattering effect on electron and phonon transport in 2D and 3D materials. GB can induce different defect trapping gap states inside the band gap, which increases the potential energy barriers of carriers and reduces the degeneracy of CB valley, and hence the Seebeck coefficient gets reduced. Sun et al.128 doped polycrystalline SnSe with Si/Ge. Doping with Ge or Si can significantly shift the trapping gap states due to the strong orbital coupling between two Ge or Si atoms, thus enhancing the electrical conductivity. In addition, band convergence in the conducting bands and phonon scattering by Ge/Si doping can synergistically enhance the power factor. In another work reported recently by Zhao et al.,305 the disadvantages of polycrystalline SnSe have been reduced via synergistic Ag doping and Ge alloying. The carrier concentration of polycrystalline SnSe was enhanced to a maximum of ∼1 × 1019 cm−3 in Sn0.99Ag0.01Se at 793 K by Ag doping (at first Sn1−xAgxSe samples with x = 0–0.03 were prepared). Then the Seebeck coefficient was increased by Ge-alloying (Sn0.99−yAg0.01GeySe, y = 0–0.02). These resulted in the highest PF ∼ 10 μW cm−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 1.5 at 793 K for Sn0.975Ag0.01Ge0.015Se sample. For polycrystalline SnSe doped with Zn, enhancement of ZT was observed by Li et al.306 For samples with composition ZnxSn1−xSe, ZT was reported to reach ∼0.96, 0.84 and 0.78 for x = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 respectively at 873 K, ZTmax ∼ 0.96 at 873 K for Zn0.01Sn0.99Se. There are many reported works on Cu-doping with polycrystalline SnSe. ZT ∼ 0.7 ± 0.02 at 773 K and κ ∼ 0.27 Wm−1 K−1 was achieved by Singh et al.307 for cu-doped SnSe samples prepared by fusion and SPS method. The second phase of Cu2Se formed in the SnSe matrix was the predicted reason for improving TE properties. Gao et al.308 prepared p-type Sn1−xCuxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.03) polycrystals via melting and high pressure (6.0 GPa) sintering (HPS) method. Maximum PF ∼ 378 μW m−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 0.79 was achieved at 823 K for Sn0.97Cu0.03Se sample. An ultralow κlattice ∼ 0.2 Wm−1 K−1 and ZT ∼ 1.2 at 873 K were achieved in the Cu0.01Sn0.99Se sample by Gong et al.309 Polycrystalline Sn1−xCuxSe samples were prepared using ball milling and hot pressing by Li et al.310 Unlike doping with Ag, doping of polycrystalline SnSe with Cu decreases the carrier concentration of SnSe at room temperature. Still, it enhances the carrier concentration above 523 K, which signifies that Cu acts as an effective p-type dopant at high temperatures. A maximum ZT of ∼0.66 at 813 K for Sn0.98Cu0.02Se perpendicular to the pressing direction was reported. In another recent work, Shi et al.311 reported the solubility of Cu to be 11.8% in single-crystal SnSe microbelts synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. Among the samples of composition Sn1−xCuxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.118), a high ZT value of ∼1.41 was achieved at 823 K for Sn0.882Cu0.118Se. Other than Na, K, Cl, Ag, Te, Ge, Zn, and Cu, some other dopants have also been proven effective for SnSe to improve its TE properties. One such dopant is Pb. Tang et al.312 prepared phase-separated Sn1−xPbxSe materials by hydrothermal synthesis. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.7 and ∼1.4 at 873 K in polycrystalline SnSe + 1% PbSe was achieved along the direction parallel and perpendicular to the pressing direction, respectively. Polycrystalline SnSe alloyed with PbSe and then doped with Na was proved to show promising thermoelectric performances. SnSe–PbSe alloys of composition Sn1−xPbxSe were prepared by Wei et al.313 Samples remained as a single-phased solid solution up to 12 at% PbSe alloying. A low κlattice ∼ 0.85 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K was achieved for x = 0.12. Above this concentration of PbSe κ- increased as a second phase arose and the band gap reduced. Further, polycrystalline (Sn1−xPbx)0.99Na0.01Se samples were fabricated via melting, annealing, and pulverizing followed by SPS. A maximum ZT ∼ 0.85 at 800 K was obtained in the x = 0 sample. Lee et al.314 observed a reduction in transition temperature from Pnma to the Cmcm phase when polycrystalline SnSe was doped by PbSe. In the Sn1−xPbxSe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) samples, the transition temperature reduces from 777 K to 716 K when x changes from 0 to 0.2. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.2 at 773 K and ZTavg ∼ 0.5 from 300 K to 773 K was achieved in Na0.01(Sn0.95Pb0.05)0.99Se. Tl-doping is an effective approach to increase the hole concentration in SnSe. Using hot pressing, Kucek et al.315 synthesized polycrystalline samples with composition Sn1−xTlxSe (for x = 0 to 0.04). Thermal and electrical properties were studied over the temperature range from 300 K to 725 K. The doped material reaches ZT ∼ 0.6 at 725 K for x = 0.015. Gao et al.316 reported an enhancement of ZT of polycrystalline SnSe by Sm-doping. Thermoelectric transport properties of Sn1−xSmxSe (for, x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) samples synthesized by melting and high pressure (6.0 GPa) sintering (HPS) method were investigated. ZTmax ∼ 0.55 was reported for Sn0.97Sm0.03Se reaches at 823 K. Introduction of Cd in p-type polycrystalline SnSe induces Sn vacancies which act as p-type dopants. Cd atoms reduce the formation energy of Sn vacancies and hence lower down the Fermi level into the VBs, generating holes. Compositions of Cd-doped SnSe can then be described as Sn1−xCdxSe (where x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035). ZT of ∼1.7 at 823 K was achieved by Shi et al.317 for a sample with nominal composition Sn0.97Cd0.03Se.
5.2.2.4 n-Type polycrystalline SnSe. 
In n-type SnSe, due to its 3D charge and 2D phonon transports,287,318 a higher out-of-plane ZT value can be achieved. Enhancement of TE properties in n-type polycrystalline SnSe alloys by optimizing carrier concentration and designing textured microstructures using MA and repeated SPS method was reported by Shang et al.318 The lowest κlattice ∼ 0.36 Wm−1 K−1 was obtained at 783 K perpendicular to texture direction. Enhancement of PF to 681.3 μW m−1 K−2 was observed in perpendicular and parallel directions to the texture in Sn1.005Se0.94Br0.06 at 783 K, this leads to a maximum ZT ∼ 1.5 at 783 K. In a reported work, Ge et al.319 demonstrated how three-step doping turned polycrystalline p-type SnSe into n-type, and then the TE performance was enhanced. Sn1−xRexSe0.93Cl0.02 (0.005 ≤ x ≤ 0.030) bulk samples were fabricated using a solid–state reaction and SPS method. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.5 was achieved in Sn0.97Re0.03Se0.93Cl0.02 at 798 K, and it was highest among all n-type polycrystalline SnSe. Br doped n-type polycrystalline of the composition SnSe1−xBrx (x = 0, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1, and 0.12) shows better TE performance due to synergistic effect of carrier concentration optimization and phonon scattering. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.3 at 773 K was achieved in SnSe0.9Br0.1 along the hot pressing direction.320 Br has nearly equal ionic radii as of Se [Se2− (1.98 Å) and Br− (1.96 Å)]. Chang et al.321 found that the PF can be enhanced from ∼2 μW cm−1 K−2 for undoped SnSe to ∼5 μW cm−1 K−2 for 3% Br doped SnSe. Further alloying with Pb enhances the PF up to ∼ 7 μW cm−1 K−2. The peak ZT ∼ 1.2 was achieved at ∼773 K for SnSe alloyed with 10% Pb. Doping the polycrystalline SnSe by I has also proved very beneficial for achieving better TE performance from SnSe. I-doped n-type SnSe polycrystalline samples with SnSe1−xIx as nominal composition were synthesized by melting and hot pressing (where, x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04). Here I act as a donor dopant at 773 K electron concentration reaches ∼2.4 × 1017 cm−3 in SnSe0.096I0.04. Thermal conductivity became more anisotropic than the Seebeck coefficient in SnSe0.097I0.03, and a ZT ∼ 0.8 was achieved along the hot pressing direction. Further alloying with 10% S and doping with 3% I (SnSe0.87S0.1I0.03) can increase ZT ∼ 1 at 773 K.322 Doping with some specific compound has also been proved to enhance the TE performance of SnSe; one such compound, BiCl3, was reported by Wang et al.323 Thermoelectric properties of SnSe0.95–x% BiCl3 (for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) samples were studied and a ZT ∼ 0.7 at 793 K in the SnSe0.95–x% BiCl3 system where x = 0.4 was achieved. Li et al.324 prepared Sn1−xPrxSe polycrystals by ball milling and hot pressing. Initially, a ZT ∼ 0.7 at 773 K was achieved for x = 0.03. After hot forging the sample, a ZT ∼ 0.9 at 773 K along the hot pressing direction was achieved. Shen et al.284 reported MoCl5 as an effective dopant to enhance the TE performance of n-type polycrystalline SnSe. They prepared SnSe0.95-x% MoCl5 samples via melting and hot-pressing methods. For x = 1.5, the n-type carrier concentration was raised to ∼1.76 × 1019 cm−3, and a ZT ∼ 0.66 at 773 K was achieved for x = 1. In the case of the SnSe polycrystalline samples synthesized by the arc-melting method, a sign change in temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient comes near 580 K, which indicates the transformation of p-type SnSe into an n-type SnSe. A high ZT ∼ 1.8 at 816 K was achieved in n-type SnSe.325Fig. 22 and 23 Schematically represent the TE performance of various polycrystalline SnSe based materials.

5.3 SnS-based materials

5.3.1 Crystal structure and general transport properties of SnS. 
SnS has the same layered orthorhombic crystal structure as SnSe.250,326,327 At lower temperature, SnS belongs to a Pnma phase with crystal parameters a = 4.334 Å, b = 11.200 Å, c = 3.987 Å,328 and passes through a structural phase change to Cmcm phase at 878 K.329 The indirect band gap is 1.09 eV for the Pnma phase and 0.42 eV for the Cmcm phase.329,330 The band structure of SnS in the Pnma and Cmcm phases are shown in Fig. 24. There is also an isotropic, metastable π-cubic phase of SnS with lattice parameter a = 11.7 Å. The cubic phase of SnS-is isotropic and has a direct band gap of ∼1.3–1.7 eV.331–333 SnS shows p-type conduction properties with hole concentration of (∼1017 to 1018 cm−3).334,335 Like SnSe, there is an existence of external pressure-induced phase transition in SnS. Ehm et al.336 examined SnS using angular dispersive synchrotron powder diffraction up to a pressure of 38.5 GPa and reported an orthorhombic to monoclinic structural phase transition at 18.15 GPa. Tan et al.337 found the ZT value for pure SnS to be ∼0.16 at 823 K. Application of different strategies improved TE performance of SnS. Comparative TE performance of various SnS based material is schematically represented in Fig. 25.

5.3.2 TE performance of SnS based materials. 
The TE properties of SnS are improved when doped with Ag. Ag-doped SnS of the composition SnS–x% Ag (x = 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2) samples were synthesized by mechanical alloying and SPS method. ZT ∼ 0.6 at 923 K was achieved for SnS–0.5% Ag.338 In another recently reported work on Ag doping with SnS, very low κ values have been reported. κ ∼ 0.58, 0.46 and 0.34 Wm−1 K−1 were achieved in undoped, Sn0.995Ag0.005S and Sn0.99Ag0.005S respectively. ZT ∼ 1.1 at 877 K for Sn0.99Ag0.005S sample was obtained.339 There are many ways to improve a material's TE performance, such as carrier concentration optimization, band structure engineering, second phase coupling, in situ nanostructure, solid solution, etc. In the case of SnSe, the last method is proved to be significantly effective. In solid solutions, defects coming from atomic disorders act as scattering centers for phonons, which causes the reduction in κlattice. SnS1−xSex (0 < x< 1) solid solutions were fabricated via melting method. These solutions possess an orthorhombic structure and show phase transition from the Pnma to the Cmcm structure at high temperatures, similar to its constituent compounds. Lattice constants of the solid solutions increase with the increase in Se content. Value of ZT increases from ∼0.19 to ∼0.82 parallel to the pressing direction and from ∼0.16 to ∼0.62 perpendicular to the pressing direction in SnS and SnS0.2Se0.8 sample, respectively, at 823 K.340 Zhou et al.341 showed that Na-doping on Sn-sites could enhance the carrier concentration of SnS up to ∼1019 cm−3. For the Sn1−xNaxS (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.03) class of samples, peak ZT ∼ 0.65 was achieved at 850 K. Na-doping on the Sn-site increased hole concentration from ∼8 × 1017 cm−3 in pristine SnS to ∼2 × 1019 cm−3 in Na0.02Sn0.98S. In another work, Tang et al.342 synthesized polycrystalline Na-doped SnS was with enhanced TE performance using the improved chemical co-precipitation method. Different filtration conditions were explored to adjust the content of doped Na cation in SnS bulks. As a result, Maximum PF ∼362 μW m−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 0.52 at 873 K were recorded for the centrifuged and triple-washed sample. Systematic Se-alloying and Na-doping with SnS resulted in ZT ∼ 1.1 at 820 K in Na0.02Sn0.98S0.5Se0.5. Se-alloying introduced weak bonds and large mass leading to low sound velocity and the disappearance of frequency gap and the large Grüneisen parameters. On the other hand, Na doping optimized carrier concentration.145 Using DFT calculations, Xiao et al. found that doping of p-type SnS by aliovalent dopants like Sb and Bi are not effective in transforming its conduction in n-type, but isovalent Pb-substitution of the Sn sites can change the type of majority carriers and make the conduction in SnS n-type.343 Later experimentally, it was shown that isovalent Pb substitution on Sn-sites of polycrystalline SnS thin films on glass substrates gives rise to n-type conduction with carrier concentration ∼ 1012 cm−3 to ∼1015 cm−3.344 Hu et al.345 fabricated n-type polycrystalline SnS bulk materials using MA and SPS methods and studied their TE properties. A maximum PF ∼ 1.2 μWcm−1 K−2 and a maximum ZT of ∼0.17 at 823 K were obtained for the polycrystalline SnS0.98Br0.02. Bi-doping increases the PF and κel of SnS, at the same time, it decreases κlattice. As an overall effect, ZT of SnS is enhanced due to Bi-doping. In a theoretical by Sun et al.,329 a maximum ZT ∼ 1.63 and ∼1.59 at 1080 K was achieved in p-type and n-type SnS, respectively. While at low temperature, ZTavg ∼ 0.31 was recorded. Recently Guan et al.346 have reported a maximum ZT ∼ 0.36 at 800 K in Sn1−xBixS sample with x = 1.56%. Wang et al.347 proposed a new route to improve the TE performance of SnS. They used the chemical precipitation method to synthesize SnS and used Na2S2O3 and SnCl2 as raw materials. The lowest thermal conductivity ∼0.29 Wm−1 K−1 and highest ZT ∼0.41 were achieved at 848 K. The new polymorphs of single-layered SnS have drawn attention in recent studies as they have excellent TE properties. In 2019 Haq et al.348 fabricated five energetically equal stable monolayered polymorphs as α-, β-, γ-, δ- and ε-SnS. These polymorphs (excluding β-SnS) show giant in-plane anisotropy in different thermoelectric parameters and are predicted to be used as promising TE materials in the future.
A high concentration of Sn-vacancies herms the TE performance of SnTe. Optimizing the Sn-vacancy concentration is essential to improve its TE performance. TE performance of SnTe in low dimension with suitable dopants are to be studied in detail. More research on n-type SnTe is yet to be conducted to use SnTe for device application. Highly anharmonic and layered-orthorhombic SnSe encourage searching for new compounds with similar features to be a candidate material for good TE performance. The TE performance of SnSe nanosheet and thin films on different substrates should be thoroughly examined. Successful application of SnSe as a filler material for enhancing the power factor of polymers opens new directions in the research of organic–inorganic hybrid TE materials with this class of materials. SnS can be a good TE for commercial application due to its low cost, low toxicity, and abundance, but low electrical conductivity hinders its TE performance. Various novel strategies to improve electrical transport properties can be applied to poly and single crystals of SnS. More investigation on these materials' mechanical and chemical stability is yet to be done for their successful large-scale device application.

6. Ge chalcogenides as TE materials
Germanium chalcogenides (GeTe, GeSe, and GeS) are important representative materials for TE application in the mid-temperature region. This section has discussed the progress of Ge-chalcogenide-based materials for TE application in past years.
6.1 GeTe-based materials

6.1.1 Crystal structure and general transport properties of GeTe. 
GeTe is one of the most efficient TE materials for mid-temperature (600–923 K) and near-room temperature applications.349 GeTe has a rocksalt crystal structure (Fmm, paraelectric, centrosymmetric) when T > 720 K with lattice constant a ≈ 6.01 Å. Near 720 K without any change in the number of atoms per unit cell GeTe undergoes a phase transition from a high-symmetry cubic-phase (c-GeTe or β-GeTe) at higher temperature to a low-symmetry rhombohedral-phase (a = b = c, α = β = γ < 90°, R3m, ferroelectric, noncentrosymmetric, r-GeTe or α-GeTe) at lower temperature through slight distortion along the [111] direction,350,351 accompanied by an angular distortion of the unit cell from 60° to about 57.51° as shown in Fig. 26.

This r-GeTe has lattice parameter a = 5.985(2) Å and rhombohedral angle α = 88.17(3)° near 300 K.350 These phase transitions are an ideal example of displacive ferroelectric phase transition due to the relative shift of the cation and the anion sublattices caused by the softening116,352 of the transverse optic (TO) phonon mode at the zone-center.350,353 Usually, high-symmetry materials have the advantage of high band degeneracy which causes a good improvement in PF. On the other hand, low-symmetry materials usually show low κlattice. In a reported work, Li et al.354 proposed that the positive contributions of both (r- and c) phases for enhancing ZT can be enjoyed simultaneously by slight symmetry breaking. During phase transition in GeTe, the symmetry breaking is minimal, so it causes both the advantages to be utilized in the same material simultaneously. The band structure of direct band gap c-GeTe is very similar to SnTe with two VBs (L and Σ), and this two VB configuration is also applicable for r-GeTe but switch in energy levels between the L and Σ bands. If ΔEL–Σ is the energy offset between two VBs, then ΔEL–Σ = −0.174 eV for r-GeTe and ΔEL–Σ = +0.064 for c-GeTe. For L-band of c-GeTe, the band degeneracy found to be NVL = 4 similarly for Σ-band it is NVΣ = 12. Due to the symmetry reduction in r-GeTe, those 4L pockets split into 3L + 1Z, and those 12Σ pockets split into 6Σ + 6η, so it seems to be difficult to achieve effective band convergence, but the added new degrees of freedom is enough to achieve effective band convergence. This makes r-GeTe as good thermoelectric material as c-GeTe or even better.355
Jeong et al.356 identified four possible crystal structures of GeTe using DFT calculation during its phase transition. Among these, R3m and Fmm were already known, but the other two phases P1 and Cm, were identified for the first time. From band structure calculation, an equal band gap (∼0.80 eV) was reported for both R3m and P1. While Cm was reported to have a lower band gap of ∼0.66 eV and Fmm to have a band gap of ∼0.34 eV. Band structures of all possible phases are shown in Fig. 27. Askarpour et al.357 used the first-principles modelling and reported unusual thermoelectric transport anisotropy in rhombohedral GeTe. According to their report Seebeck coefficient is lesser anisotropic than electrical conductivity and PF. They took parallel and perpendicular to [111]-direction as cross-plane and in-plane directions, respectively. They found that in n-type GeTe, the cross-plane electrical conductivity is larger than that for in-plane, and for p-type, the nature is opposite. This anisotropy causes ZT to differ depending on the direction. But pristine p-type degenerate GeTe is not considered a good thermoelectric material. It has an extremely high carrier concentration (∼1021 cm−3) due to intrinsic Ge-vacancies caused by the large population of the occupied anti-bonding states.358 The high carrier concentration of GeTe reduces the Seebeck coefficient and hence PF. From the phase-diagram analysis of GeTe, Miller,359 Lubell and Mazelsky360 proposed the presence of only one type of defect. According to them, each defect acts as an acceptor and supplies two holes to the VB. Later Damon et al.361 proposed the defects to be Ge-vacancies. In contrast to that, analyzing Hall measurements, Kolomoets et al.362 reported the presence of more than one type of defect. Later Lewis et al.363 analyzed transport properties of GeTe as a function of composition based on a two-carrier model. In recent work, Liu et al.364 clarified the role of Ge-vacancies in structural change and TE performance. Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory, they found that Ge-vacancies are more likely to form spontaneously in the cubic phase than in the rhombohedral phase, plays a vital role in stabilizing the cubic phase, and Ge-vacancies modify the band structure in a way that reduces power factor.364 From reported data, we can have an idea about the different TE parameters of GeTe. Pristine GeTe exhibits the σ value of ∼8067 S cm−1 at 300 K, which decreases to ∼2158 S cm−1 at 708 K. S-value of ∼34 μV K−1 at 300 K increases with temperature, then reaches ∼153 μV K−1 at 708 K. GeTe has κlattice ∼ 2.6 Wm−1 K−1 and κtotal ∼ 8.3 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K, which reduces to ∼3.43 Wm−1 K−1 at 673 K. ZT of pristine GeTe increases with temperature from ∼0.03 at 300 K to ∼0.8 at 720 K.365 The size-dependence of the amorphous to crystalline phase transitions in GeTe nanoparticles increases the possibility of designing memory devices with GeTe at the nanoscale. Yarema et al. reported that crystallization temperature increases with decreasing size of the GeTe nanoparticles below 10 nm.366 Recently, Shekhawat et al.367 have reported that Se-substitution in GeTe, increased the band gap in the as deposited films and decreased in the annealed films. These results have proved that Se-substitution can effectively be used to tune the bandgap and transition temperatures of GeTe systems. It will be interesting to explore the transport properties of these GeTe1−xSex (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) alloys both by experimentally as well as theoretical DFT method.

6.1.2 TE performance of GeTe based materials. 
6.1.2.1 Results of using Bi and Sb as doping or a co-doping agent. 
The introduction of Bi-was proved to enhance the TE performance of pristine GeTe. In the case of Ge1−xBixTe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) samples, the replacement of Bi3+ ions in Ge2+ sublattice helps to reduce excessive hole concentration and tune the Seebeck coefficient towards better TE performance. Low κlattice ∼ 1.1 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K was achieved for x = 0.10, and ZT ∼ 1.3 at 725 K was obtained for x = 0.06 by Perumal et al.174 For Ge1−xBixTe name samples with (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.12), Wei et al.349 reported ZT ∼ 1.91 at 740 K for x = 0.1. Bi-dopants reduce the concentration of holes by substituting Ge sites and also tune Fermi level to a more suitable position to enhance PF. By manipulating Ge-vacancies and Ge-precipitates, Jin et al.368 successfully improved the TE performance of GeTe. They optimized the carrier concentration ∼ 2.79 × 1020 cm−3 by Bi-doping, then Ge-phase aggregation was suppressed by proper heat treatment. As a result, maximum ZT ∼ 1.9 at 723 K was eventually obtained in Ge0.94Bi0.06Te. Recently Zn/Bi co-doping has also been proved to enhance TE performance of pristine GeTe synergistically. A peak ZT∼ 2.0 at 700 K and ZTavg ∼1.35 between 400 K and 800 K were achieved in the Ge0.9Bi0.06Zn0.04Te sample. Bi-optimizes the carrier concentration and also reduces c/a ratio, which causes band convergence. Increased point defect scattering and emerged inter-valley scattering of the converged VB maxima due to Bi/Zn co-doping reduces κlattice ∼ 0.44 Wm−1 K−1 at 650 K.369 Co-doping of GeTe with In/Bi can lead to an enhanced ZT ∼ 2.1 at 723 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.3 in from 300 K to 723 K in the composition Ge0.93In0.01Bi0.06Te. In-dopants enhances S (∼120 μV K−1 at 300 K) by forming resonant levels. On the other hand, Bi dopants reduce κlattice (∼0.5 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K) by forming point defects that cause more phonon scattering.370 TE performance of GeTe was also improved when alloyed with CdTe. Here, CdTe helps to gain effective band convergence in both (r- and c-) phases, further Bi doping in Ge-sites tunes carrier concentration. Substitution of Cd and Bi in Ge-sites increases phonon scattering and leads towards a reduced value of κlattice (∼0.6 Wm−1 K−1). As a result, ZTavg ∼ 1.2 from 300 K to 800 K was achieved.371 In a reported work, Hong et al.127 analytically demonstrated the role of planar vacancies in scattering mid-frequency phonons and experimentally showed that pristine GeTe doped with Cd/Bi could cross the amorphous limit of lattice thermal conductivity. The combined effect of high-density planar vacancies, grain boundaries, and point defects leads to a high ZT ∼ 2.2 in (Ge1−x−yCdxBiyTe) composition samples. Xing et al. achieved ZT ∼ 2.5 at 700 K (Fig. 28) and ZTavg ∼ 1.5 in from 300 K to 750 K for Ge0.9Mg0.04Bi0.06Te. A large mass and strain field fluctuations introduced by Mg/Bi co-doping resulted in an ultralow thermal conductivity. Co-doping with Mg/Bi optimized the carrier concentration and improved the DOS effective mass.372
 Fig. 28  The highest achieved figure of merit (ZTmax) for different compositions of GeTe-based materials [data taken from Table 4]. 
Another way of decreasing the phase transition temperature of GeTe below 300 K is co-doping it by Mn/Bi. Liu et al.373 achieved ZT ∼ 1.5 at 773 K and ZTavg ∼1.1 from 300 K to 773 K in cubic Ge0.81Mn0.15Bi0.04Te. The synergistic effect of Ti doping on the TE performance of GeTe was demonstrated by Shuai et al.374 Maximum ZT ∼ 1.2 was achieved in Ge0.98Ti0.02Te, and when Ge0.99Ti0.01Te was further doping with Bi high, ZT ∼1.6 was achieved for Ge0.93Ti0.01Bi0.06Te at 623 K. A solid solution between PbTe and GeTe was studied by Woolley et al.375 It was found that GeTe-PbTe alloys exhibit good thermoelectric performance. Pb reduces Ge vacancies, and thermal conductivity is reduced. On the other hand, Bi2Te3 works as a good TE material near room temperature. Properties of (GeTe)1−x(Bi2Te3) solid solutions with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05 were studied by Christakudi et al.376 in a temperature range of 80 K to 350 K. Bi2Te3 based alloys are suitable TE materials in the near room temperature region. Bi2Te3-GeTe pseudo-binary compounds effectively shift the operating temperature range to a higher temperature region. Kohri et al.377 observed that the temperature at which ZT of Bi2Te3 was reaching maximum shifts to a higher value in Bi2Te3-GeTe pseudo-binary compounds. Later, a high ZT ∼ 1.9 at 773 K for Ge0.87Pb0.13Te + 3 mol% Bi2Te3 was achieved by Wu et al.378ZT ∼ 1.1 was achieved at 773 K in Ge0.87Pb0.13Te. Further doping the alloy with Bi2Te3 enhanced its TE performance. Introduction of Bi2Te3 increases the solubility of PbTe in the GeTe matrix enhances point defect scattering hence reduces κlattice and also reduces the energy difference between two VBs.379 Gelbstein et al.176 reported a maximum ZT ∼ 1.2 at 723 K in Ge0.5Sn0.25Pb0.25Te sample. They further reported that ZT can reach 2.1 for ∼5% Bi2Te3 doped-Ge0.87Pb0.13Te sample.379 In another work, Wu et al.125 successfully fabricated a complex hierarchical microdomain-nanodomain-gap structure in GeTe–Bi2Te3 pseudo-binary alloy after proper heat treatment. Before and after heat treatment, they examined Ge vacancies, gaps, and ferroelectric domain structures that originate due to the complex interplay between strain and electrostatic interactions during the phase transition of the sample. A peak ZT ∼ 2.4 at 773 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.28 from 323 K to 773 K was achieved for GeTe alloyed with 5% Bi2Te3 doped GeTe or (Ge0.95Bi0.05Te1.025), which was greater than that of (ZT ∼ 2.0) same sample fabricated without heat treatment. Zhou et al.124 theoretically showed that GeTe/Bi2Te3 superlattice material shows low κlattice and has an impact of being used as good TE material. A systematic study by Li et al.380 on the synergetic effect of Pb doping and thermal annealing with GeTe–Bi2Te3 showed that Pb effectively reduces carrier concentration and enhances PF, and also reduces κlattice by introducing point defects. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.47 was reached at 673 K for the (Ge0.84Pb0.16Te)0.93(Bi2Te3)0.07 pseudo-cubic phase alloy before annealing, for the same sample at the same temperature ZT reduced to 1.35 at 673 K. The annealing process led to a reduction in density of stacking faults (plane defect), which consequently increased κlattice. It was previously said that GeTe and its alloys work as good thermoelectric material in the mid-temperature range but quenched p-type (Ge0.87Pb0.13Te)1−x(Bi2Te3)x with [0 ≤ x ≤ 0.07] samples shows good TE performance near room temperature as well mid-temperature region. Samples were fabricated by the usual alloying, quenching, and SPS process. ZT ∼0.96 and 1.38 at 300 K and 373 K respectively and ZTavg ∼1.15 from 300 K to 473 K for x = 0.07 was achieved in (Ge0.87Pb0.13Te)0.03(Bi2Te3)0.07 sample.381 Inherently GeTe shows p-type conduction, but alloying of AgBiSe2 with GeTe can result in n-type conduction. For p-type and n-type (GeTe)100−x(AgBiSe2)x systems ZT ∼ 1.3 at 467 K and ZT ∼ 0.6 at 500 K respectively were reported by Samanta et al.382 Liu et al.364 also reported n-type conduction in GeTe when heavily doped with Bi. ZT ∼ 2.4 at 600 K (Fig. 28) and ZTavg ∼1.5 over a temperature region from 300 K to 800 K were achieved in Ge0.86Pb0.1Bi0.04Te by Li et al.354via controlling the distortion degree to make the split low-symmetry VBs in r-GeTe converge by Pb alloying and Bi doping. Doping with Bi-reduced carrier concentration, increased the rhombohedral angle, made the band structure more favorable for electronic performance, and increased phonon scattering by introducing point defects.354 Improved TE performance of (GeTe)1−x(Bi2Se0.2Te2.8)x systems where GeTe was doped with Bi2Se0.2Te2.8 was investigated by Koenig et al.383 Doping with another IIA element, Sc increases the PF up to a value of 23.3 μW cm−1 K−2 at 300 K in Ge0.94Sc0.06Te by reducing carrier concentration without affecting rhombohedral distortion degree. Though Bi dopants reduce that PF to a value of 16.8 μW cm−1 K−2 in Ge0.88Sc0.06Bi0.06Te, they also effectively reduce κlattice due to strong point defect scattering. As a net result, ZT is enhanced. Liu et al. first theoretically explained the role of rhombohedral distortion degree on the Ge-vacancy formation energy. They found from DFT calculations that a Ge-vacancy has the lowest formation energy among all other typical defects, which decreases more with an increase in rhombohedral angle and can become negative at a certain point. Sc-dopants do not change the formation energy significantly. They experimentally showed the effect of Sc/Bi co-doping on GeTe, and a ZTavg ∼1.2 from 300 K to 723 K was achieved.384
Another Group-V element Sb is also an effective dopant for GeTe. Perumal et al. reported the effects of doping GeTe with Bi, Sb individually or co-doping with both. Doping of GeTe with either Bi- or Sb-showed a similar trend of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. No second phases were detected in both cases, and PXRD was indexed into R3m phase at room temperature. From the measured lattice parameters for the similar composition Ge0.95Bi0.05Te and Ge0.95Sb0.05Te, it has been reported that Bi-elongated the a- and b-axes faster than shortened the c-axis, while Sb-did it oppositely. From DSC measurements of the samples described that Bi-doping promotes R3m → Fmm transition of GeTe slightly faster than Sb doping. Rhombohedral to cubic phase transition temperatures for Ge0.95Bi0.05Te and Ge0.90Sb0.10Te were 656 K and 634 K; respectively, both are lesser than pristine GeTe. Finally, a ZTmax of ∼1.8 at 725 K was achieved for the co-doped sample Ge0.85Bi0.05Sb0.10Te.385 Substitution of Sb3+ ions at Ge2+ site in GeTe decreases the p-type carrier concentration.
Reported work on high-quality crystalline ingots of p-type Ge1−xSbxTe showed various effects of doping with Sb. As a dopant, Sb-reduced the carrier concentration, increased the cubic nature at room temperature, lowered the rhombohedral to the cubic phase transition temperature, enhanced the band degeneracy. κlattice was also reduced due to increased phonon scattering from various nanoscale/mesoscale structures formed due to Sb-doping. All these effects led to a ZT ∼ 1.85 at 725 K when x = 0.10.386 A peak ZT ∼ 2.2 at 740 K in Sb doped GeTe has been reported by Vankayala et al.387 for Ge0.92Sb0.08Te single crystals. The extreme reduction in κlatticewas explained theoretically as well as experimentally in this work. Sb-doping softens the phonon frequency, changes the dominant scattering mechanism from a four-phonon to a three-phonon and κlattice-reaches its amorphous limit at high temperature. TE properties of GeTe-based materials can be enhanced by tuning the phase transition temperature via doping with Sb.388 Sb has the advantage to effectively optimize the carrier concentration, as already discussed. Sb-can promote the crystal symmetry of GeTe to enlarge the band degeneracy while flattening the valence band. As a consequence, effective mass increased to 2.34 m0 (at room temperature in Ge0.875Sb0.125Te). Point defects and mass fluctuations, introduced by doping with Sb, also decreased the κlattice by suppressing the phonon propagation. Finally, the peak ZT ∼ 1.8 at 773 K and a ZTavg ∼1.1 from 300 K to 773 K were achieved in the Ge0.9Sb0.1Te sample.388 When pristine GeTe is doped with Sn-the rhombohedral to cubic structural phase transition temperature is reduced to 557 K. Total thermal conductivity reduces significantly for Ge0.9Sn0.1Te near room temperature.389 For amorphous GeTe, increasing Sn content decreased the band gap, and a PF ∼ 2.789 × 103 μW m−1 K−2 was achieved at 300 K. For the crystalline film of GeTe, the PF ∼ 1.423 × 103 μW m−1 K−2 at 718 K was achieved, as Sn-doping increases effective mass in this case.390 Sharply peaked DOS of low-dimensional materials are very effective in modifying their electronic transport properties. But it is challenging to achieve such DOS in 3D-bulk materials as they have DOS as a smooth function of energy (DOS ∝ E1/2). Interestingly, the Rashba spin-split systems possess features of lower-dimensional structures in their DOS. The Rashba effect occurs in inversion-asymmetric materials that have strong spin–orbit coupling. Recently Hong et al.391 have demonstrated how the “Rashba effect” in Sn doped GeTe samples can enhance their TE performance. Atomic site displacement in the samples leads to the introduction of the Rashba effect in this case. As a result, band convergence and hence remarkable increment in PF was obtained, and further doping with Sb-optimizes the carrier concentration. Low κlattice Was resulted due to the association of grain boundaries, nano precipitates, and stacking faults. As a net result, a ZT ∼ 2.2 in Ge0.87Sn0.05Sb0.08Te was achieved at 740 K. GeTe was doped with Sb and alloyed with GeSe to tune the carrier concentration over a large scale of 1 × 1020 to 3 × 1021 cm−3. Li et al.392 fabricated polycrystalline samples like Ge1+δTe (−0.04 ≤ δ < 0.06), Ge1−xSbxTe (x ≤ 0.12), and Ge1−xSbxTe1−ySey (x ≤ 0.15, y ≤ 0.20) and achieved a maximum ZT ∼ 1.7 at 725 K, which was predicted to be further increased up to ∼2.0 by additional Se alloying. ZT ∼ 2.2 in Ge1−x−ySbxZnyTe by Bi doping and Zn alloying with pristine GeTe was reported by Hong et al. Sb reduces the band gap between acoustic and optical phonon branches, which plays a vital role in decreasing κlattice and Zn doping enhances band convergence and enhances PF.156 Alloying MnTe into GeTe, a class of Ge1−xMnxTe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.21) compounds was prepared by melting–quenching-annealing-SPS method, and with the increasing proportion of MnTe, a shift from r-phase towards c-phase was observed near room temperature. MnTe-increased the band convergence, effective mass, Ge-vacancy, and alloy scattering, on the other hand, reduced the τ of phonon and phonon velocity. Further doping with Sb-optimized the carrier concentration and lowered κlattice. As an overall effect, a maximum ZT value of 1.61 at 823 K was achieved for Ge0.86Mn0.10Sb0.04Te.393 According to a report by Rosenthal et al.179 Ge12(Sb1−xInx)2Te15 (x = 0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) solid solution series also shows improved TE performance. Li et al.394 showed that Sb-is an effective doping agent to optimize carrier concentration. Sb-dopant manipulates the degree of rhombohedral lattice distortion to maximize the band degeneracy and increases the solubility of PbTe in the GeTe matrix. In this case κlattice was reduced due to scattering of phonons by Ge/Pb substitutional defects, and ZT > 2 at T < 800 K was achieved in both r- and c-phases for GeTe alloyed with PbTe and then doped with Sb. Ga-doped and Ga/Sb co-doped GeTe samples have promising TE performance. Using hybrid flash-SPS method on the sintered co-doped samples of Ge1−xGaxTe (x = 0.00–0.07) and Ge1−x−yGaxSbyTe (x = 0.02; y = 0.08, 0.10) materials were synthesized by Srinivasan et al.395 Room temperature Hall-measurement of these samples showed that effective mass increases from 1.30 me to 2.38 me for changing (x = 0, y = 0) to (x = 0.02, y = 0.08). A maximum ZT ∼ 1.95 at 723 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.85 in the temperature range from 600–773 K was achieved in the Ge0.90Ga0.02Sb0.08Te sample, which can be explained as an increase in band degeneracy and hence PF.395 Xing et al.396 co-doped GeTe with Mg/Sb, and a maximum ZT ∼ 1.84 at 800 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.2 in 300–800 K was achieved in Ge0.85Mg0.05Sb0.1Te. In addition to this, a TE uni-leg was fabricated by one-step sintering of the Ge0.85Mg0.05Sb0.1Te powder, Ti powder, and Ni powder directly using the hot-pressing technique and a thermal cycling test was performed, which showed quite a high service stability even after 450 thermal cycles. Nshimyimana et al.397 reported that partial substitution of Ge by Cd and further doping with Sb is an effective way to enhance the TE performance of GeTe. In this case, Cd-increases the effective mass of holes by reducing offset energy between two types of VBs and increasing their contribution in the conduction process in cubic and rhombohedral phases. Cd and Sb both enhance phonon scattering by introducing point defects which lead to a low κlattice. In addition to this, Sb optimizes the carrier concentration also. With all these effects ZT ∼ 1.8 at 700 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.3 from 400 K to 800 K were achieved for the Ge0.89Cd0.03Sb0.08Te sample. Doping with Re-improved mechanical properties of GeTe for practical device applications. Co-doping with 10% Sb and 2% Re resulted in a maximum ZT ∼ 1.7 at 773 K.398 The rhombohedral to cubic phase transition temperature of GeTe also can be tailored via Sn-alloying leading to significantly improved performance of thermoelectric properties of GeTe. Further doping the cubic Ge0.5Sn0.5Te matrix with Bi and Sb resulted the suitable combination of favourable electronic properties as well as low thermal conductivity and enabled a peak ZT ∼ 1.7 at 723 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.23 from 400 K to 800 K for Ge0.4Sn0.4Bi0.02Sb0.12Te.399
In 2006 Matsunaga et al.400 showed that GeTe(1 − x)-Sb2Te3(x) pseudo-binary compound films maintain rocksalt crystal structure over a wide range of compositions for a range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2/3 when subjected to instantaneous heating by laser irradiation followed by equally rapid cooling. Many works reported that GeTe rich Sb2Te3 pseudo-binary [Sb2Te3(GeTe)n]-type materials show excellent TE properties in the mid-temperature region. Temperature-dependent phase transition of these classes of materials with n = 6, 12, 15 were studied by Schneider et al.401 Rosenthal et al.402 described this structure as a mixture of tetradymite-type Sb2Te3 and GeTe, and this results in the pseudo-binary homologous series Sb2Te3(GeTe)n with distorted rocksalt-type unit-cell of a thickness depending on the richness (n-value) of GeTe in the sample, and each cell is separated from the adjacent cell by the van der Waals gap. The Te–Te layers are separated by van der Waals gaps for every n block of the Ge–Te layer in the Ge–Sb–Te structure; this is absent in the traditional Sb doped GeTe samples. Samples with n = 2 and 19 were found to achieve ZT ∼ 1.3 at high temperatures. But, the lack of long-time stability of those samples above room temperature, these materials were not so effectively used in actual TE devices. On the other hand, ZT reached only up to ∼0.7 in that temperature region where the samples were long time stable and applicable in devices. Fahrnbauer et al.403 demonstrated the effect of CoGe2 precipitates on the TE properties of (Ge–Sb–Te) samples. A simultaneous increase in PF and decrease in κlattice due to homogeneously distributed CoGe2-precipitates resulted in ZT ∼ 0.9 at 523 K and ∼1.8 at 723 K in the case of (CoGe2)0.22Sb2Te3(GeTe)19 heterostructure. At the same time, peak ZT ∼ 1.9 at 723 K was recorded for (CoGe2)0.20Sb2Te3(GeTe)17. Vacancy engineering on Sb2Te3(GeTe)17 leads to a high ZT. In their work, Xu et al.404 varied the annealing time of the sample and found ZT ∼ 2.4 at 773 K and ZTavg ∼ 1.51 for 7 days' annealing. The carrier concentration of the same sample reduces after annealing. The microstructural origin of this carrier concentration reduction lies in the migration and reconstruction of intrinsic Ge vacancies present in the system during the annealing process, which in turn forms more stable defects named long-range van der Waals gaps. Reduced carrier concentration reduces κel. Recently, Rhenium (Re) doped Sb2Te3(GeTe)12 has been reported as good TE material of Ge–Sb–Te class by Lou et al.405 with a ZT ∼ 2.25 at 773 K in Sb2Te3(Ge0.988Re0.012Te)12. Tsai et al.406 reported that TE performance of Ge1−xSbxTe and (GeTe)1−y(Sb2Te3)y samples can be drastically enhanced by using a two-step cooling procedure. For example, Ge0.95Sb0.05Te alloy synthesized by this procedure with an intentional suspension in cooling for an hour at 673 K and resulted in a ZT ∼ 2.0 at 720 K, which is greater than that achieved in another work mentioned in this report previously. When these samples were further doped with Sb2Te3, their TE performance was enhanced. For (GeTe)0.95(Sb2Te3)0.05ZT reached ∼2.5–2.9 at 720 K. The reason behind this enhancement is the composition fluctuation of alloys below a specific temperature, which is a sign of spinodal decomposition. Sb/In co-doping reduces the phase-transition temperature to extend the better thermoelectric behavior of cubic GeTe to low temperature. ZT ∼ 2.3 was achieved above 650 K in Ge0.89Sb0.1In0.01Te.126 Qiu et al. reduced the phase transition temperature of GeTe from 660 K to 523 K via entropy engineering. Multiple doping by In, Pb, Sb, and I increased the configurational entropy of GeTe. ZT ∼ 2.1 at 800 K was achieved for the highest entropy species Ge0.84In0.01Pb0.1Sb0.05Te0.997I0.003. The increased configurational entropy improved TE performance in many ways. It helped to form short-range disordered microstructures and provided all-scale phonon scattering centers that consequently reduced the κlattice. The large effective mass of the high entropy sample resulted in a high Seebeck coefficient.407
6.1.2.2 Research progress on TAGS materials. 
Since the past few decades, TAGS [generally expressed as (AgSbTe2)100−x(GeTe)x or TAGS-x] materials have been proving themselves as good TE materials to use mainly in the mid-temperature regime. TAGS-80 and TAGS-85 were considered the two most promising systems of this class.178,408–410 Undoped TAGs-75 has a ZT ∼ 0.7 at 625 K. Zybała177 reported that ZT value increases to a maximum of ∼1.2 at 625 K when TAGs-75 is optimally doped with AgSbSe2 with a composition (GeTe)75(AgSbTe2)23.75(AgSbSe2)1.25. Christakudis et al.411 achieved a maximum ZT ∼ 1.68 at 700 K in (GeTe)0.8 [(Ag2Te)0.4(Sb2Te3)0.6]0.2. TAG-85 is rhombohedral at room temperature and transforms to cubic after a certain higher temperature. Kumar et al.408 prepared cubic TAG-85 even at room temperature by following a specific cooling procedure during synthesis. They reported that TAGS-85 works best when spontaneous precipitation of Ag8GeTe6 is minimized. In recent years researchers found interest in improving further TE performance of this class of samples using various strategies. Levin et al.409 reported that doping with rare earth Dy improves TE performance of TAGS-85. For undoped TAGS-85, a ZT ≤ 1.3 was recorded at 730 K. At the same temperature, the TAGS-85 sample doped with 1% Dy for Te showed ZT ≤ 1.5, and TAGS-85 doped with 1% or 2% Dy for Ge showed ZT ≥ 1.5. TAFS-85 becomes a dilute magnetic semiconductor when doped with 1 at% Ce or Yb. Though this doping increases κlattice but the comparatively higher increment in S compensates for the drawback, and as the net effect, a high ZT ≈ 1.5 at 700 K was achieved in TAGS-85 + 1% Ce and TAGS-85 + 1% Yb.410 When the Ag/Sb ratio is changed from unity, TE performance is improved than the conventional TAGS. Doping TAGS-75 with AgSbSe2 improves the TE performance due to a reduction in κlattice and increment in Seebeck coefficient.178
6.1.2.3 Other effective dopants and techniques. 
In another work by this research group 1.5 at% BiI3-doped Sb2Te3(GeTe)17 has been reported to have a good ZT value of ∼2.2 at 723 K and ZTavg ∼1.4 in the temperature range of 323–773 K. Doping with BiI3 induces anion site (Te) vacancy clusters which combine with cation site (Ge) vacancies resulting in significant phonon scattering and hence a reduction in κlattice.412 Among IIIA elements (Al, Ga, In, Tl), doping with In-has been proved to be most efficient in lowering the carrier concentration, enhancing the Seebeck coefficient, reducing κel to result in an enhanced ZT in GeTe. Solid solutions of composition (In2Te3)x(GeTe)3−3x were prepared by Sun et al.413 and proposed as an effective substitute for TAGs as a p-leg material for TEGs or TECs. ZT ∼ 1.35 at 823 K for x = 0.05 was achieved. The energy difference between the light VB and heavy VB decreases with increasing In2Te3 content. Increasing DOS causes enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient but a reduction in electrical conductivity. In the rhombohedral phase, In-doped GeTe shows very similar resonant levels as those in undoped GeTe. An enhanced total DOS in both phases originates from the host–dopants interaction irrespective of crystal structure or temperature. The deep defect states (DDSs) above the VBM are around the Fermi levels, and the DOS changes cause an enhanced Seebeck coefficient. A maximum ZT ∼ 1.3 at a temperature about 628 K in Ge1−xInxTe class of samples when x = 0.02 was achieved.414 Co-doping With In/Se is also effective to synergistically enhance the TE performance of GeTe. For Ge0.99In0.01Te1−ySey (y = 0.05 and 0.10) class of samples ZT ∼ 1.38 was achieved for y = 0.05. In dopants incorporates resonant levels and increases PF while Se decreases it. But as Se decreases κ- also, the net result is enhanced ZT.415 From the calculated carrier concentration of different metal-tellurides, it is clear that the carrier concentration increases with a decrease in cation size. That's why among PbTe, SnTe and GeTe, the last one has the highest carrier concentration, which is a drawback for GeTe. Li et al.416 proposed that effective size enhancement of cation can improve TE performance of GeTe. Ge-vacancy has the lowest formation energy and the biggest cause of its high carrier concentration. Doping with PbSe increases cation size, reduces anion size, uplifts the formation energy of Ge-vacancies, and helps to reduce high carrier concentration. Finally, ZT ∼ 2.2 has been achieved in GeTe–PbSe alloys. Ge1−xAlxTe (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08) alloys were processed via melting and SPS by Srinivasan et al.417 The outcome of the studies suggests that Al-is not a good dopant for GeTe like other IIIA elements. Al-dopants increase the hole concentration, increase energy separation between L and Σ band, and reduce the band convergence, resulting in a reduced Seebeck coefficient and ZT. Additionally, they found IIA element Ba-is also not a good dopant to increase TE performance of GeTe. In a recent work, Gao et al.418 doped GeTe with transition element Y and achieved a ZT ∼ 1.2, further enhanced by doping with Bi and Sb to ZT ∼ 1.8 and ZTavg ∼ 1.1 from 300 K to 723 K. When GeTe is doped with SnSe and SnS, the system acts as a solid solution at a lower concentration of SnSe and SnS, and at their higher concentration, the coexistence of solid solution and phase separation is observed. Further doping with Sb-optimizes carrier concentration, increases the solubility of SnS– SnSe in GeTe. An abundance of point defect is also increased, and micron-sized Ge-rich precipitates are introduced. So κlattice is further reduced due to an increased phonon scattering in Sb-doped (GeTe)1−2x(SnSe)x(SnS)x system. At 300 K κlattice ∼ 0.8 Wm−1 K−1 and ∼0.3 Wm−1 K−1 were achieved for (GeTe)0.95(SnSe)0.025(SnS)0.025 and (Ge0.90Sb0.10Te)0.95(SnSe)0.025(SnS)0.025 systems respectively. ZT ∼ 1.9 at 710 K was achieved for the second system.419 Recently an enhancement in PF has been repor ted by charged ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) in GeTe.420

6.2 GeSe-based materials

6.2.1 Crystal structure and general transport properties of GeSe. 
GeSe is an inherently p-type semiconductor with a layered orthorhombic crystal structure when crystallized under ambient conditions.421 At low temperature, it remains in the Pnma phase with lattice parameters a ≈ 10.825 Å, b ≈ 3.833 Å, c ≈4.388 Å.250,422 GeSe is an indirect band gap semiconductor with an experimentally measured band gap of 1.14 eV.423 GeSe has complex VB structures. According to the reported DFT calculation, the energy difference between the first–second and the first–third VB are ∼0.13 eV and 0.16 eV, respectively. From the same DFT calculation, the effective mass on different VB for orthorhombic GeSe was estimated to be  for the first VB band and  for the second VB. Similar to SnSe, in this case, also the second VB is heavier than the first VB.424 Gashimzade et al.425 reported a phase transition in GeSe from simple orthorhombic to body-centered orthorhombic (Pnma → Cmcm) at 29 GPa. Under some specific crystallization condition, GeSe can also be crystallized in two other phases, and those are cubic (Fmm) and rhombohedral (R3m), respectively. Sist et al.426 carried out a complete structural study of GeSe from 120 K up to 940 K using high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and found a structural phase transition to a rocksalt crystal structure (Fmm) at 907 K. According to Wiedemeier and Siemers, the first-order phase transition from orthorhombic-GeSe to cubic-GeSe occurs at 924 ± 5 K under ambient pressure. It remains in the cubic phase till the temperature reaches its melting point.427,428 This high-temperature cubic phase was inherently unstable due to imaginary vibrational modes centered at the BZ center, and the cubic phase was not available under ambient temperature and pressure. An increment in external pressure leads those imaginary vibrational modes to disappear, and the phase transition occurs under ambient temperature.429 Bhatia et al.430 reported a pressure-induced first-order transition from layered crystalline semiconductor-GeSe (α-phase) to a metallic-GeSe (Fmm) at 6 GPa with a ≈ 6.42 Å. But analyzing in situ x-ray-diffraction measurements, Onodera et al.431 observed that GeSe remains in the orthorhombic structure up to 82 GPa. Von Rohr et al.432 synthesized and characterized a new, unusual β-phase of GeSe, a polymorph of α-GeSe. This β-phase also has a layered orthorhombic crystal structure. The intralayer Ge–Se distance is ∼2.59 Å, and that for interlayer is ≈3.27 Å, where each layer consists of six-rings with the vertices arranged in a “boat” conformation, and it is a semiconductor with a moderate band gap. Later Xu et al.433 worked on this new β-phase of GeSe and investigated the electronic, optical, and transport properties. In 2018 Yu et al.434 discovered two novel intermediate phases between the phases reported by Von Rohr et al. (α-phase → R3m → Fmm → β-phase). Where the low-pressure R3m phase shows ferroelectricity and high pressure (6 GPa) Fmm phase acts as a 3D topological insulator. In recent times by analyzing the phonon dispersion curves, Kagdada et al.435 reported that the Pnma → Fmm phase transition takes place at 7.3 GPa. There is a conflict regarding the actual value of the external pressure, though, from the reported data, it can be predicted to lie somewhere above 6 GPa. A minimum κlattice ∼ 0.39 Wm−1 K−1 was speculated for GeSe,421 which was lower than that of GeS (0.52 Wm−1 K−1) and SnS (0.45 Wm−1 K−1). In practice, the low carrier concentration is a barrier for pristine GeSe to achieve promising TE performance.


6.2.2 TE performance of GeSe based materials. 
Hao et al.424 predicted that ZT for hole-doped GeSe along crystallographic b-axis can be enhanced up to 0.8 at 300 K and 2.5 at 800 K (Fig. 29) if the carrier concentration can be increased from 4 × 1019 cm−3 to 6.5 × 1019 cm−3. Those dopants which can increase the carrier concentration of GeSe are suitable to enhance the TE performance of GeSe. Ag doping with GeSe on the Ge sites is an effective way to improve its TE performance. Zhang et al.436 showed that doping with Ag can enhance the carrier concentration ∼1018 cm−3 (which still does not meet the requirement). Still, other dopants like Na, Cu, La, Se cannot significantly increase the carrier concentration, even like Ag. For Ge1−xAgxSe systems, the Hall carrier concentration increases with increasing x and reaches a saturation value at x = 0.002. Further doping with Sn increases carrier concentration a little more. ZT ∼ 0.2 at 700 K was achieved in Ge0.79Ag0.01Sn0.2Se. According to some reports, Na can also act as an effective dopant for GeSe to reduce thermal conductivity. Polycrystalline samples of composition Ge1−xNaxSe with x = 0.00, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 synthesized by Shaabani et al.437 reported that the value of κ decreases with increasing Na content and becomes lowest ∼ 1.06 Wm−1 K−1 at 300 K and lowest κlattice ∼ 0.44 Wm−1 K−1 at 573 K among the synthesized samples at x = 0.04. Previously it was predicted that the cubic phase of GeSe could not be stable under ambient conditions. Still, later Roychowdhury et al.438 showed that alloying pristine GeSe with specific compound AgBiSe2 could stabilize its cubic phase even under ambient conditions. For (GeSe)1−x(AgBiSe2)x class of samples [0.35 ≤ x ≤ 0.50] this stable cubic phase exists. Additionally, this alloyed material showed n-type conduction, a counterpart of inherent p-type GeSe, and was urgently needed to use GeSe in commercial TEG or TEC devices. As a result of this alloying, with the increase in the AgBiSe2 content, band gap gradually decreases from 1.1 eV (orthorhombic phase) to 0.05 eV (for 0.08 ≤ x ≤ 0.29, rhombohedral phase) and then increases to 0.3–0.4 eV (for 0.30 ≤ x ≤ 0.50, cubic phase). A maximum ZT ∼ 0.45 at 677 K was achieved for the n-type cubic sample for x = 0.50. In 2019 Cui et al.439 theoretically predicted a decent power factor in the cross-plane direction for n-type GeSe. More delocalized interlayer carrier density was assumed to cause the highly normalized electrical conductivity and hence PF. Additionally, they found group VA and VIIA elements to be effective n-type dopants for GeSe. However, VIIA elements were more effective than VA elements to normalize the PF towards a higher ZT. Different phases of GeSe also have properties that are helpful to use as better TE material than pristine GeSe. A way to improve the TE performance of orthorhombic GeSe is to alloy with some particular material to stabilize a new rhombohedral structure (like GeTe) that will have multi valley Fermi surface increased carrier concentration. Two such promising alloying agents are AgSbSe2 and AgSbTe2. Huang et al.440 found a transition from orthorhombic phase to rhombohedral phase in pristine GeSe when doped with AgSbSe2. This alloying leads to an abrupt increase of ∼1020 cm−3 in carrier concentration of GeSe. ZT ∼ 0.86 at 710 K was achieved in the GeAg0.2Sb0.2Se1.4 system. Also, alloying with AgSbTe2 can synergistically improve the TE performance of GeSe. A maximum ZT ∼ 0.96 at 754 K was achieved in GeSeAg0.2Sb0.2Te0.4, and the ZTavg ∼ 0.64 was recorded between 301 K and 754 K by Yan et al.441 Synthesis of p-type crystalline cubic GeSe was done by Yan et al.442 by alloying with Sb2Te3. Study of (GeSe)1−x(Sb2Te3)x alloys at room temperature. The study revealed how different phases of SnSe could be fabricated by changing the percentage of Sb2Te3 in the alloys. When x = 0%, the sample remains in the Pnma phase. At x = 5%, there is a coexistence of Pnma and cubic phases. When x > 8%, the sample turns out to be in the complete cubic phase. From this study, ZT ∼ 0.73 was achieved in (GeSe)0.92(Sb2Te3)0.08 at 710 K. Under ambient conditions, Sarkar et al.443 stabilized the rhombohedral phase of GeSe by allying with 10 mol% AgBiSe2. A remarkably high ZT ∼ 1.25 at 723 K was achieved parallel to the growth direction in the p-type rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiSe2)0.1 crystals synthesized by the Bridgman method. Theoretically, it was predicted that this alloy has some ferroelectric instability, which softens the polar transverse optical phonon modes and scatters more heat-carrying acoustic phonons. Which results in a reduction of κlattice, and leads to show a better TE performance. In another work by Sarkar et al.444R3m-phase of GeSe was stabilized under ambient conditions by alloying GeSe with AgBiTe2. This phase change comes along with a change in the nature of bonding from covalence to metavalence. Rhombohedral (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 has some metallic character and closeness to ferroelectric instability. Hence, its band gap, electronic structure, and low κlattice are preferred to be used as a good TE material. A large PF of 12.8 μW cm−1 K−2 and ZT ∼ 1.35 was achieved in (GeSe)0.9(AgBiTe2)0.1 at 627 K. Wang et al.445 studied the structure-dependent TE properties in GeSe1−xTex (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) samples. Orthorhombic, hexagonal, and rhombohedral phases were obtained for different Te content in the compounds. Pure orthorhombic phase exists for x ≤ 0.05, for x = 0.10 and 0.15 both orthorhombic and hexagonal phases coexist, pure hexagonal Ge4Se3Te phase for 0.20 ≤ x ≤ 0.35 and rhombohedral phase for x ≥ 0.40. Different structures had different carrier concentrations, e.g., for the Ge-rich orthorhombic phase, the carrier concentration is ∼1016 cm−3, and for the other two Ge-poor phases, those are ∼1021 cm−3. Albeit having an equal range of carrier concentration rhombohedral phase has a higher Seebeck coefficient than the hexagonal phase due to the favored band structure. At 778 K, a maximum ZT ∼ 0.69 was achieved in GeSe0.55Te0.45 after transitioning from the rhombohedral phase to the cubic phase. Using the first-principles-based Boltzmann transport equation approach, Yuan et al.446 predicted ZT values of p-type orthorhombic GeSe along a-, b- and c-direction can be enhanced up to 1.54, 1.09, and 1.01 at 700 K and 8 GPa, respectively. Predicted values are remarkably higher than those at zero pressure at an experimental carrier concentration of ∼1018 cm−3. Yuan et al.447 again investigated electronic and phononic transport properties along with the dynamical and mechanical stability of GeSe in its R3m phase. Along the interlayer direction at 800 K, the predicted maximum ZT values for p-type and n-type doping were 2.02 and 2.37, respectively. According to Li et al.,448 strain-engineering is an effective way to improve the TE performance of 2D monolayer GeSe. The effects of different kinds of strain like uniaxial, biaxial, tensile, compressive, armchair-compressive strain are demonstrated in this work. It was predicted that the PF could be enhanced four times at room temperature for both p-type and n-type 2D monolayer GeSe at the −6% strained condition. Reduction in structural dimension can improve TE performance of GeSe. A recent investigation on 3D-GeSe and 2D polymorphs of GeSe (α-GeSe, β-GeSe, and γ-GeSe) showed that both 3D and 2D structures are equally stable and can break the benchmark limit of ZT ≈ 1 at room temperature. At room temperature, ZT ∼ 1.02 for 3D- GeSe and ZT ∼ 1.10 for γ-GeSe were achieved. ZT for γ-GeSe reached ∼1.72 at 150 K.111 Crystal structures and band structures of all such polymorphs are shown in Fig. 30.

6.3 GeS-based materials
GeS has the same layered orthorhombic crystal structure as SnSe, SnS, or GeSe with lattice parameters a = 10.481 Å, b = 3.646 Å, c = 4.299 Å for low-temperature Pnma phase.250,449 There is a structural phase transition from the Pnma phase to the Cmcm phase at 863 K.423 GeS has an experimentally calculated band gap of ∼1.65 eV.450 The energy offset between the first and second VB is ∼ 0.11 eV. The estimated effective masses are  for the first VB band and  for the second VB.424 The first VB is heavier than the second one, which was not in the case of GeSe or SnSe. So GeS shows some conduction properties that are different from GeSe and SnSe. Using a constant-pressure ab initio technique, the gradual phase transition towards the Cmcm-phase of the layered Pnma-GeS was found by applying external hydrostatic pressure about 35 GPa.451 The work also predicted the possibility of further transition into a rocksalt-structured phase from Pnma and Cmcm by sliding the layers relative to each other along c-direction. In 2019 Haq et al.450 reported the presence of two new thermodynamically stable polymorphs (γ-GeS and ε-GeS) of monolayer GeS along with the normal α-GeS. These two new polymorphs have extremely high DOS near the Fermi level and exhibit a high Seebeck coefficient and sufficiently high electrical conductivity. The plots of DOS and different TE parameters of those polymorphs of GeS concerning chemical potential are depicted in Fig. 31. Using DFT and Boltzmann transport theory, the ZT reaches 1.67 for γ-GeS at 500 K and 1.07 for ε-GeS at 1000 K. Ding et al.421 and Shafique et al.453 also studied the thermoelectric and phonon transport properties of GeS along with some other promising IV–VI metal chalcogenides.

Ge-chalcogenides are promising materials for TE application. The high intrinsic p-type carrier concentration of GeTe is a drawback of this material. Research to find suitable dopant and doping techniques are encouraging for this material to optimize carrier concentration and achieve an efficient n-type counterpart for device application. GeTe is the only candidate in IV–VI class of chalcogenides that exhibit a rhombohedral (ferroelectric, noncentrosymmetric) phase at ambient conditions. The transition from ferroelectric to paraelectric (cubic) phase has great importance in the thermal transport properties of this material. Critical analysis of the thermal behavior of this material in the transition region is required. The large band gap and strong covalent bonding in orthorhombic GeSe harm its TE performance. Change in phases (rhombohedral, cubic) tailors the nature of bonding and improves TE properties of GeSe. More research can be pursued to tune and stabilize the suitable phase of GeSe for TE applications. GeSe and GeS have a similar crystal structure as SnSe; their promises in organic–inorganic hybrid TE materials are to be investigated. Techniques to improve the mechanical stability of these materials for real-life applications are to be researched more.
The current discussion focuses on the experimental and theoretical development of the thermoelectric properties of Ge chalcogenides. These materials in the thermoelectric module for power generation technologies may face additional commercialization challenges due to germanium, an expensive material. The device efficiency and commercial feasibility of these materials are yet to be thoroughly investigated.
7. Perspective and future aspects
In this review, we have briefly discussed various novel and traditional strategies that are being used nowadays to improve TE performance beyond the classical benchmark by optimizing the electrical and thermal transport properties of suitable materials. Various strategies, as, increase in local DOS and distortions in DOS by the resonant level formation, relaxation time modulation for charge carriers, lowering of deformation potential, lowering of band effective mass and increment of band degeneracy, modulation of ‘Diffusion of carriers’ and ‘phonon-drag’, reduction of dimensionality of the materials, carrier energy filtering, charge density wave formation to improve the power factor of materials and reduction of specific heat of the material, reducing phonon relaxation time by increment in scattering rate of phonons or large anharmonicity, reduction in phonon group velocity, nanostructure engineering, all-scale hierarchical architectures, reduction of bipolar thermal conduction, tuning of atomic disorders to reduce thermal conductivity of a material have been discussed here for general TE materials. We also have discussed how these strategies have been validated on eco-friendly Pb-free IV–VI metal chalcogenide (SnTe, SnSe, SnS, GeTe, GeSe, and GeS) materials to improve their TE performance. Despite colossal research progress for some candidate materials (SnTe, SnSe, GeTe) of this class, still, some routes for further improvements in the TE performance of these materials in the future can be proposed.
(i) Strongly coupled TE parameters in 3D-bulk TE materials are problematic to decouple. Meanwhile, TE parameters of 2D and quasi-2D materials can be decoupled more easily. So, a reduction in the dimensionality of the materials can help to improve the TE performance. Already single-layered or bi-layered (2D) SnSe, SnS, GeSe, GeS have shown promising TE performance as their 3D-bulk counterpart and sometimes possess equally stable crystal structures in both dimensions. This technique can be explored on other metal chalcogenide materials to check their efficiency in lower dimensions.
(ii) It is essential to fabricate p-type and n-type counterparts of a material to use in TE devices. Both counterparts for some materials (SnSe, GeSe) of this class have already been researched widely, and the rest are yet to be explored more.
(iii) From our discussion, we have seen that a change in fabrication technique can significantly change TE performance in the same composition material. Changing the synthesis method can lead to a better TE performance. More research on the synthesis techniques can be pursued to improve the purity of the desired samples to achieve better TE performance from materials.
(iv) Environmental concerns due to the toxicity of inorganic materials are increasing the research interest in organic TE materials. Using various conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, etc., as a matrix for the degenerate semiconductor nanoparticles, a new direction has already been evolved to find efficient TE materials for eco-friendly commercial use. Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, etc., are efficient inorganic chalcogenide compounds used in organic–inorganic composite materials for TE applications. Recently, SnSe NS/PEDOT:PSS composites have been reported to have promising TE performance. Some other IV–VI metal chalcogenides have similar layered lattice structures like SnSe. The TE performance of organic–inorganic nanocomposites with those materials is yet to be explored.
(v) Best operating condition and best structural stability may not fall in the same temperature region [e.g., SnTe, Sb2Te3(GeTe)n]. The lack of long-time stability of such samples in the best operating temperature regime resists applying those materials in actual TE devices. It is to be inspected how the temperature region of stability and best operation can be merged and if organic TE materials can be used for this purpose.
(vi) Phase transition significantly impacts the transport property of materials. The phase with high symmetry usually has the advantage of high band degeneracy and high density of state effective mass, which helps to achieve an elevated Seebeck coefficient. The low symmetry phase usually has the advantage of low lattice thermal conductivity.354 Phase transition of a TE material in the operating temperature range can be harmful to practical applications. The immediate change in the thermal expansion coefficient during phase transition will generate high internal stress between the devices' materials and outside contacts. It would decline the performance of the device. GeTe is a promising material for mid-temperature TE applications. Still, the phase transition in GeTe from a rhombohedral structure to a cubic structure near ∼700 K hinders its suitability of applications for energy harvesting. There are already some reported works on doping, multiple doping, entropy engineering, etc., to reduce the phase transition temperature of GeTe.373,384,385,387,388,399,407 These techniques can be applied to other materials that face similar phase transition problems in their operating temperature range.
(vii) It is desirable to understand the structure of the probable promising material for thermoelectric applications at the atomic scale using some advanced spectroscopic techniques combined with insights rendered by the results of first-principles calculations and machine learning interatomic potential approach. This will focus on identifying the accurate and appropriate contributions of the lattice part of thermal conductivity from the moment tensor potential (MTP) of the machine learning language approach. As a result, it is expected that the figure of merit (ZT) of such intriguing 2D materials may be compared or projected to the values obtained from experiments after suitable synthesis routes.454–456

 	Fig. 3  In the non-degenerate semiconductor regime, κel is negligible, and Z-increases with n due to an increase in S. In the degenerate semiconductor regime, Z-reaches a peak when n = noptimum, and [S2σ] is maximized. In the metallic regime, κlattice is negligible, and Z-declines with increasing n due to reduction in S, and increases in κel. Reprinted from ref. 20.
