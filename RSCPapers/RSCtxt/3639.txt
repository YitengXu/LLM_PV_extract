    , Accepted 12th May 2014First published on 12th May 2014AbstractThe present work reports a detailed electro-analytical framework for studying commercially available mono-crystalline silicon solar cells under varying illumination conditions to explore their application in the up-and-coming field of low concentration photovoltaics (LCPVs). The effect of low concentration illumination (>1–12 suns) on performance indicating parameters, i.e., short circuit current, open circuit voltage, fill factor, efficiency and ideality factor, was investigated using DC characterization. The same framework can be used for AC characterization in order to explore diffusion capacitance, transition capacitance, diffusion resistance and recombination kinetics under varying illumination. Recent developments in the impedance spectroscopy technique have broadened its horizon and have allowed its use in addressing unexplored material and performance aspects of mono-crystalline Si solar cells under non-equilibrium conditions. The obtained DC and AC experimental results are coupled with theoretical treatment to demonstrate the characteristic features of charge recombination in the space-charge region and the quasi-neutral region.
1. Introduction
Among the various existing photovoltaic (PV) materials, silicon (Si) is one of the most widely used semiconductors for the fabrication of solar cells. Approximately 80% to 90% of PV modules manufactured worldwide are silicon wafer-based solar cells.1 The cost of electricity generated from solar cells is quite high as compared to conventional sources of energy, i.e. hydroelectricity, nuclear power, thermal power, etc. Reducing the cost of silicon solar cells is possible by using c-Si wafers,2 c-Si thin films,3 Si in the form of ribbons4,5 and concentrator Si solar cells.6,7 Low concentration photovoltaic (LCPV) technology has proven to be an effective means of reducing the cost of photovoltaic electricity since the early 1990s. In the last decade, the price of silicon-based solar modules has been reduced by a factor of 1/5, making it more relevant to develop low concentration photovoltaic systems using these cells, for further energy market penetration. Si solar cell-based LCPV systems with concentration ratios below ∼10 suns present two major advantages: (1) LCPV systems can use conventional high performance silicon solar cells (fabricated for 1 sun application8), and (2) LCPV systems are less demanding in terms of tracking accuracy as compared to high concentration systems.9 In recent years, significant advances in the field of low concentration have been made by achieving a peak efficiency of 15% for 14 suns using commercially available mono-crystalline single junction solar cells.10 Castro et al. estimated a cost of $ 0.5/Wp for a Si-based concentration photovoltaic system11 using a back contact solar cell below 100 suns. Li et al. reported the performance of a solar cell array based on a trough concentrating photovoltaic/thermal system.12
Recently, various research groups have reported the modeling, design and construction of LCPV systems based on Si solar cells,3,13–15 and a few companies have invested in this technology for commercialization.10,16–19 It is well known that the existing Si-based PV technology has a warranty for 25–30 years of use; in order to achieve a substantial share of the PV industry, low concentration technology must provide a similar warranty. For LCPV systems, an extensive study of a system's reliability should be performed before issuing any such claim. Laboratory studies based on DC characterization of Si solar cells at low concentration and real time analyses have been carried out in detail by various researchers.4–12 In our previous articles, we reported a real time analysis of a LCPV system and its dynamic behavior.1,8,20–22 However, the major disadvantages of the DC techniques used for solar cell characterization are: (1) they do not help to probe the AC parameters that are necessary for designing the dynamic load of such devices,23 and (2) the transient response of charge carriers is difficult to estimate and is very important for understanding device behavior over time.
In the present study, a combination of DC and AC techniques are used for the characterization of Si solar cells. The AC impedance spectroscopy (IS) technique is used to examine the effective recombination lifetime by studying the recombination kinetics via resistance and capacitance measurements. Impedance spectroscopy is a small perturbation method that resolves the steady state capacitance and resistance of the electronic device being tested. At a bias voltage close to zero, the efficient operation of solar cells is usually determined by charge separation and efficient collection. On the other hand, at the maximum power point close to VOC, recombination kinetics (i.e. the effective recombination lifetime) play a major role.24 Only a few reports on probing the DC and AC characteristics of mono-crystalline Si-based solar cells exist in the literature,23–28 and to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports that explore the DC and AC parameters of mono-crystalline Si solar cells for low concentration applications. The present work focuses on a number of performance indicating parameters of Si solar cells, including diffusion capacitance, resistance, ideality factor and minority carrier lifetime, which dominates the electrical response under various non-equilibrium conditions. The obtained experimental results are coupled with theoretical treatment to provide a framework for addressing the unexplored material and performance aspects of Si solar cells at low concentration.
2. Theoretical considerations
When a solar PV module is exposed to solar radiation, it shows non-linear current–voltage characteristics. The non-linearity arises due to the loss of photo-generated carriers. Possible mechanisms of photo-generated carrier loss have been proposed by many researchers.1,3,26 These loss mechanisms include: (1) thermalization loss: photo-generated carriers move from the initial excited state to the respective band edges, (2) spatial relaxation: the photo-generated carriers are swept along the band edges to the contacts, (3) radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs, (4) Shockley–Read–Hall, Auger and surface recombination, and (5) series and shunt resistances. All the discussed loss mechanisms associated with photo-generated carriers are described in terms of single or double diode models, where the rectifying behavior and recombination losses of a solar cell are represented by diode 1 and diode 2, respectively. In this article, an effective diode model for a mono-crystalline silicon solar cell has been adopted.23,25

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the basic layout of a silicon solar cell, with various regions contributing different capacitive and resistive components during its operation. The terminal equation for the current–voltage characteristics of a solar cell is given by:29–31 I = IPH − Id − (V + IRS − Vpp+)/RSH(1)
A detailed explanation of various physical processes with respect to Fig. 1 is given in the supporting information. The diode current accounting for carrier recombination at the n+–p junction is governed by the effective diode ideality factor (m) under forward bias and can be expressed in terms of the voltage Vj: (2)where I0 is the effective reverse saturation current of the diode, which is a combination of contributions from space-charge recombination (SCR) and quasi-neutral recombination (QNR). The contributions from both are included by splitting I0 into two parts: I01 and I02 for QNR and SCR, respectively. Reverse current, I01 arises when band-to-band recombination takes place during QNR, while I02 arises due to impurity/trap-level recombination occurring during SCR. Under high bias conditions, the recombination in the QNR region is high, so I0 ≈ I01, with an ideality factor of m ≈ 1. Whereas, under low bias conditions, the recombination in the SCR region is high, so I0 ≈ I02, with an ideality factor of m ≈ 2. For the single diode model of a Si solar cell, the effective value of m is generally taken to be between 1 and 2, where the lower and upper bounds of m are expected at moderate forward bias voltages and strong reverse bias voltages, respectively.23

The aforementioned DC model alone is insufficient to analyze the different kinetics (diffusion, recombination and transportation of charge carriers) of a silicon solar cell under non-equilibrium conditions. Under these circumstances, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been rigorously employed in explaining the charge transfer resistance, capacitance, diffusion and charge recombination kinetics at the n+–p junction. The proposed AC equivalent circuit elements that allow the extraction of all relevant information about the recombination kinetics at the n+–p junction of the solar cell are incorporated into Fig. 1. A direct current (DC) voltage, V, combined with a small amplitude time-dependent perturbation voltage, Ṽ, is applied across the Si solar cell. RS, Rde, RSH and Rdb represent the series resistance, emitter resistance, shunt resistance and base resistance, respectively. The dependence of Rd on the ideality factor (m) and the junction diode current is given by eqn (3):23 (3)where Vj represents the junction voltage and I0e and I0b represent the current at the emitter and the base, respectively. Rd is also known as the recombination resistance (Rrec), which provides information about the recombination flux. The total DC resistance (Rdc) of the solar cell is defined as the reciprocal of the negative derivative of current with respect to voltage, i.e. −(dI/dV)−1. By taking the derivative of the terminal current–voltage equation (eqn (1)), an expression for Rdc is obtained:25–28 (4)
At higher forward bias voltages, charge recombination in the QNR region is dominant over that in the SCR region. The net impedance (Z) of the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 1 is a series combination of the impedances, Zj and Zpp+ of the n+–p and the p–p+ junctions, respectively. The high frequency parts of the spectra contain information about the transport and series resistance elements, as well as the dielectric contributions, which are not considered in this paper. The low frequency arc contributes to recombination in the solar cell and the capacitance, resistance and lifetime values.23,24 In order to improve the performance and reliability of mono-crystalline Si solar cells at low concentration, the charge carrier dynamics and material aspects must be considered.
3. Experimental section
3.1. Material aspects of mono-crystalline Si solar cells
Commercially available mono-crystalline Si solar cells procured from Nease Asia Pvt. Ltd (India) are used in the present study. The procured solar cell is fabricated using a p-type mono-crystalline silicon wafer as a starting material (acts as a base layer), into which gaseous POCl3 is diffused for emitter fabrication. The silicon nitride layer (∼80 nm) on the front surface of the silicon solar cell acts as an anti-reflective coating and a surface passivation layer. The use of the silicon nitride layer improves the bulk minority carrier lifetime and diffusion length. The p–p+ junction, which acts as a back surface field, is formed by diffusing aluminum into the p-type base material. The aluminum (Al) on the back surface results in gettering, in which the metallic impurities in the bulk are either removed or dissolved, and this enhances the carrier lifetime.

Fig. 2A shows a cross-sectional view of a mono-crystalline silicon solar cell with a thickness of ∼215 μm, with an approximately 25 μm back surface layer of aluminum. Screen printing technology is used for front and back contact metallization. Fig. 2B shows the topography of a silicon solar cell with a current-carrying finger made from Ag-based pastes. Fig. 2C shows the anisotropically etched surface of a mono-crystalline silicon solar cell. The difference in the atomic densities of the 〈100〉 and 〈111〉 directions leads to the formation of pyramids on the surface. Fig. 2D shows a high magnification image of the pyramids formed on the solar cell surface in the 〈100〉 direction.

The short circuit current (ISC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cell under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) are 11 mA, 509 mV, 62.1% and 12.9%, respectively. The solar cell material parameters described here are used to explore the recombination kinetics using the impedance spectroscopy technique.
3.2. Device characterization
The solar cell I–V characterization was carried out using a solar simulator (Photoemission Tec SS80AAA with 1.5AM-G filter) and a Source measuring unit (U2722A, Agilent). The temperature of the solar cell was measured using a digital thermometer (Mini Temp, Raytek) with an accuracy of ±2 °C, and a Fresnel lens was used to concentrate the solar radiation. During the measurements, the silicon solar cell was mounted over a heat sink to maintain constant temperature. The electron micrographs were collected under ultrahigh vacuum conditions using a Leo-s 440i scanning electron microscope with an operating voltage range of 1–10 kV. A three electrode potentiostat (CHI 660D) equipped with a frequency analyzer was used for the impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements. The working electrode was connected to the positive terminal of the Si solar cell (i.e. on the back side), whereas the counter electrode and reference electrode were sorted and connected to the negative front terminal of the Si solar cell. A variable DC voltage source was used to apply a potential difference from −0.5 to 1.0 V across the P–N junction, with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The inductive effects of the connecting leads between the Si solar cell and the potentiostat were taken care of during the experiments. IS data were collected in the form of Nyquist impedance spectra. During the IS measurements, an AC perturbation of 5 mV root-mean-square voltage was applied in the frequency range 1 Hz to 0.1 MHz.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Diffusion-controlled kinetic parameters
Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is used here to understand the diffusion-controlled transport kinetics of commercially available Si solar cells with power conversion efficiencies within the range of 12–16.8%. From these measurements, the influence of light concentration (>1 sun) on the charge carrier recombination process and on the quasi-Fermi levels (which influence the upper limit of achievable VOC) are explored by applying a forward bias voltage VF ⋍ VOC.
The characteristic patterns (high and low frequency arcs) of the impedance spectra of an n+–p junction solar cell are shown in Fig. 3, in the form of complex Nyquist plots. The Nyquist spectra in Fig. 3A–C show the evolution of the AC response of the silicon solar cell as the contributions of the reverse and forward biases across the back surface field (BSF) are varied. In all the observed complex spectra, the symbols represent the experimental data points, while the solid lines are fits to the model discussed in Section 2. As the applied DC bias across the n+–p junction is gradually decreased (i.e. the reverse bias increases), the magnitude of the complex impedance increases. This increase in the magnitude of the complex impedance signifies the dielectric nature of the n+–p junction, as the current flowing through the junction is very small or negligible. The capacitance and resistance of the n+–p junction are dominated by the transition capacitance (CT = Cj) and shunt resistance (Rsh = Rj), respectively. As the forward bias increases (0 to 0.4 V) across the terminal of the n+–p junction, the radius of the complex Nyquist plot decreases, signifying the conductive nature of the n+–p junction, due to the increase in charge injection. The diffusion capacitance (Cd) and resistance (Rd) of the n+–p junction dominate for forward bias.
 Fig. 3  Nyquist spectra for a mono-crystalline Si solar cell: (A) the plots were collected at decreasing voltages in the following order: V = 0, −0.05, −0.1, −0.15, −0.2, with the arrow indicating the successively reducing bias; (B) the plots were collected at increasing voltages in the following order: V = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, with the arrow indicating the successively increasing bias; (C) the spectrum shows the contributions from two different time constants. 
The contribution of the p–p+ junction is not detected in the impedance spectra until a strong forward bias is applied (>0.5 V). This is due to the fact that at moderate forward bias, the voltage across the n+–p and p–p+ junctions compresses the space-charge layer, consequently reducing the junction width. Also, the p–p+ junction is comparatively thinner than the n+–p junction and the base, hence the net impedance at moderate forward bias is mostly influenced by the comparatively much larger impedance provided by the n+–p junction. As the forward bias increases, the impedance arc becomes gradually distorted at high frequency due to the progressive involvement of the resistive and capacitive components of p–p+, as shown in Fig. 3C. Consequently, the impedance contribution of the p–p+ region is added in order to achieve a satisfactory fit to the obtained data. At biases corresponding to the knee voltage or at increased insolation, the p–p+ junction contributes to the high frequency part of the complex Nyquist plot (Fig. 3C). Fig. 4 shows the voltage-dependent variation of Rj for a silicon solar cell, extracted from the low frequency arcs of the impedance spectra.
 Fig. 4  Resistance of the n+–p junction measured using IS at different biases. The inset shows the plot of lnRj at higher bias, with the solid line indicating the theoretical fit (eqn (10) and (11) of ESI†). 
Under reverse bias conditions, the resistive component of a Si solar cell is dominated by RSH (as a consequence of unavoidable leakage current) and is nearly independent of the junction voltage and illumination level. An insignificant voltage dependence of RSH is observed in Fig. 4, which is consistent with the results reported by other groups.23–25 At low forward bias, a change in the slope signifies a switching of the predominant charge recombination process from SCR to QNR. The recombination processes in the SCR and QNR regions are often associated with two ideality factors, m1 and m2, which have different values. In this article, the ideality factor (m1) associated with the recombination mechanism in the QNR region is the most interesting for the following reasons: (1) diffusion-governed recombination is dominant at higher illumination levels, and (2) to account for the complex dynamic behavior of QNR with increasing illumination level (junction voltage), as described below.
From the theory outlined in Section 2 and the ESI,† it is indicated that the electron density in the conduction band increases with increasing illumination (or bias), which results in a decrease in the resistance of the junction (eqn (10) and (11) in the ESI†). In practice, a decreasing trend is observed for Rj (Fig. 4) in Si solar cells, as expected. With increasing junction bias, Rj decreases by two to three orders of magnitude as compared to RSH at low illumination level. The obtained value of Rj at biases greater than the knee voltage (≈0.4 V for 1 sun illumination) is mainly dominated by the diffusion-governed resistance, Rd. The variation of Rj with bias is related to the recombination flux by the following expression:24 (5)where Irec is the recombination current and V is the applied junction voltage. The junction resistance (Fig. 4) follows an exponential behavior governed by Rj = R0exp(−βqVF/kBT). The theoretical curve fitting for Rj is carried out using the following values: R0 = 1.8 × 104 Ω,  and T = 298 K. For the application of silicon solar cells at higher concentrations (>1 sun), a larger junction resistance, Rj, is desired because Rj represents electrical loss caused by recombination at the junction.

Fig. 5 shows the variation of the junction capacitance (Cj), measured from the low frequency arcs of the Nyquist spectra, as a function of junction bias (illumination level VOC ⋍ Vj).
 Fig. 5  Capacitance of the n+–p junction measured using IS at different biases. The inset shows a plot of lnCj at higher bias, with the solid line indicating the theoretical fit. 
The obtained variation of Cj is characterized in two different regions (Fig. 5), a low bias region (≤1 sun) and a higher bias region (>1 sun). The capacitance value at low bias (≤1 sun) is defined as the change in the total annihilated minority charge carriers in the SCR region divided by the applied junction bias, i.e. (dQ/dV). An approximate expression for the capacitance is given as: Cdl = C0dl exp(Vj/m2VT), where C0dl = (|e|w0ni/4m2VT). The charge annihilated recombination of the generated electrons and holes is dominant in the low bias region. The level of recombination gradually decreases on both sides of the junction past the characteristic length, w0. A higher, almost constant and voltage-independent value of Cj is observed in the low forward bias region, indicating dielectric behavior of the Si material and a broader depletion region. The dielectric behavior is due to the following reasons: (1) the density of states is not occupied in the silicon material, and (2) a depletion zone is built up at the n+–p junction, which reduces the capacitance to geometrical capacitance at zero bias voltage. At higher bias i.e. (>VOC at 1 sun), a slightly different junction capacitance behavior of silicon solar cells is observed due to the following reasons: (1) an exponential change in the number of diffuse minority charge carriers, and (2) occupation of the electronic density of states by excess minority charge carriers. An increase in illumination (or higher bias) results in an introduction of excess holes (Δp), with an insignificant change in the number of majority carriers (p0) in the base region. Due to the change in the number of majority charge carriers, the hole Fermi level shifts downward by ΔEFp = kBTlnp0/(Δp + p0), which is insignificant with respect to the shift in the electron Fermi level (EFn). This indicates that EFp undergoes minor changes during photovoltaic operation.24 Since the electron carrier density at equilibrium is negligible, the electron Fermi level, EFn, changes significantly when excess carriers are injected or photo-generated at higher illumination level, which results in an exponential increase in the chemical capacitance. The capacitance plot also indicates a change in the slope as the applied bias increases from low forward bias (FB) to a higher FB. The ideality factor obtained from the Rd(Vj) fitting is nearly 15% larger than the ideality factor determined by fitting the Cd(Vj) data. This suggests that the junction capacitance acts as a DC blocking element, and depends only on the junction width and doping density of the diffusion region. Therefore, the voltage-dependent current-carrying junction resistance is more sensitive to the presence of defects and recombination flux.
The junction capacitance (transition capacitance) at reverse bias is represented by a Mott–Schottky plot32 in Fig. 6. The lines are the fit to the experimental data obtained using eqn (16) in the ESI† and indicate a linear fit to the composite data. The slope (2/qεNa) and the intercept (2Vbi/qεNa) of the fitted line in Fig. 6 provide values for the base doping concentration (Na ≈ 1.5–4.0 × 1016 cm−3) and the built-in potential (Vbi ≈ 0.6 V), and are comparable to previously reported values.25,28
 Fig. 6  Mott–Schottky plot for a mono-crystalline Si solar cell. The inset shows the variation of the minority carrier lifetime as a function of the applied bias. 
The inset of Fig. 6 shows the bias (illumination level) sensitive values for the effective carrier lifetime (τ) obtained from eqn (17) in the ESI.† The trends in the τ–Vj plot are different in the low and high forward bias regions. This is because under low bias conditions, recombination in the SCR region dominates, while under high forward bias conditions, base recombination (QNR) dominates, which is in accordance with the theory outlined in the ESI† and discussed previously with respect to Fig. 4 and 5. At low forward bias, τ almost remains constant with respect to Vj, by largely following the voltage-independent behavior. This is mainly attributed to the following reasons: (1) the dielectric nature of the silicon material, and (2) the increase in the electric field in the SCR region with decreasing forward bias, which increases the width at the n+–p junction. This eventually lowers the effective diffusion coefficients of the charge carriers in the active regions of the fields. At higher forward bias, τ follows the voltage dependence of Rj, which arises from the injection-dependent carrier lifetime. The dependence of τ at the bias corresponding to the maximum power point reflects the competitive interplay between the two types of recombination mechanism associated with SCR and QNR. Hence, the net recombination process is most efficient in this region (i.e., 0.35–0.45 V). The effective lifetime in the base region is lower in the voltage range where efficient charge annihilation occurs. In view of Fig. 1, it is most likely that the general trend is affected by both SCR and QNR.
4.2. Current–voltage characteristics

Fig. 7 shows the voltage-dependent photocurrent (IPH) of a silicon solar cell at 25 °C, with illumination levels from 1 to 10 suns.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage characteristics of a mono-crystalline Si solar cell with varying illumination levels (1 sun corresponds to AM1.5, 1000 W m−2) (circle: ∼1 sun, square: ∼3 suns, diamond: ∼6 suns and star: ∼10 suns). The marked regions show the QNR- and SCR-governed recombination regions. 
In Fig. 7, the solid lines represent the theoretically fitted data obtained from the proposed model given in Section 2, and the points represent the experimental data. An excellent agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations is obtained, with ≤ ±5% error. The static parameters ISC, VOC, Pmax, FF, η and Rs of Si cells measured under standard test conditions (STC) are summarized in Table 1, along with the static parameters calculated using the proposed model (Section 2). Increases in current (ISC) and open circuit voltage (VOC) are observed with increasing illumination level at constant temperature. Under non-equilibrium conditions, promotion of electrons in the acceptor state and the hole-to-donor state results in shifting of the electron Fermi level, EFn, towards higher values (in terms of energy), while the hole Fermi level, EFp, undergoes a small downward shift; the difference between these energy values is often associated with the VOC of solar cells, as shown by eqn (6) (ESI†). For the Si solar cells studied here under irradiation (λ) with generation rate (G) and AM1.5 spectrum (with concentration ratio (CR) from >1–12 suns), an increase in illumination causes EFn and EFp to shift towards higher and lower energy levels respectively, resulting in an increase in VOC (Fig. 7). This observation is further supported by the C–V plot (Fig. 5), in which the electron occupation of the density of states increases with increasing forward bias, corresponding to illumination-dependent VOC. A similar trend in VOC has been observed by other researchers.33 A linear increase in ISC with increasing illumination level signifies increases in the generation of electron–hole pairs and in the occupancy of the density of states, until a quasi-flat band condition is achieved.

From the obtained I–V characteristics (Fig. 7), recombination in the QNR region is dominant over SCR, resulting in a shift of the maximum power point (MPP) towards lower voltage. The parameters extracted from the I–V plot (Fig. 7) show the dependence of η and FF of Si solar cells on the illumination level. From the obtained parameters listed in Table 1 (RS and m used as fitting parameters), it can be observed that η and FF increase to maxima of 16.8% and 69% respectively at an illumination level of ≈5.8 suns, and then decrease linearly with increasing illumination level. The dynamic trend of η and FF with changing illumination level mainly depends on the competitive interplay between the VOC, RS and m of a solar cell. Under low illumination or at the optimum concentration ratio (CR) level, a logarithmic dependence of  on the CR and ISC causes increases in the FF and η of Si solar cells (Table 1). Whereas, beyond the optimum CR level (where the influence of VOC is minimized), a mixed activation of RS and m causes reductions in η and FF. The series resistance of a solar cell is governed by the silver front contact grid, the aluminum back contact layer and the carrier-transporting interlayers (n+–p, p active layer and p–p+), which are dependent on the illumination, temperature, and generation and recombination of charge carriers.25 With an increase in illumination level beyond the optimum CR, a higher charge transport within the interlayers of the silicon material, finger and bus bar causes a higher resistive power loss equivalent to I2RS in the solar cell, thus reducing its η and FF. A similar dependence of the series resistance on illumination and temperature was observed by Garland et al. and Khan et al. for mono-crystalline silicon solar cells.25,34 The dominance of QNR over SCR diffusion recombination is another factor in lowering the η and FF of Si solar cells beyond the optimum CR. According to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination effect, an ideality factor (m) of 2 signifies that recombination takes place via a single trap level in SCR.27 This process is only observed to a measurable extent under low forward bias conditions, in which QNR is practically absent. On the other hand, an ideality factor (m) of 1 at high forward bias signifies diffusion of charge carriers via QNR, and the effect of SCR is almost negligible.27 From Fig. 7 and the extracted parameters in Table 1, the diode ideality factor, m, is equal to 2.5 (average value for a scan voltage range between 0 and 0.4 V) under 1 sun illumination, and is mainly dominated by SCR. With increasing illumination level, the ideality factor is reduced to ∼1.5, which is attributed to the dominance of QNR-governed recombination. Similar behavior of the ideality factor (m) with increasing illumination was observed by other researchers.27,33,34 From the abovementioned discussion, it can be concluded that a logarithmic dependence of VOC on CR causes an increase in η and FF, whereas a linear decrease in m along with a linear increase in RS causes a reduction in η and FF.
5. Conclusions
A detailed theoretical platform is presented to explain the results of DC and AC characterization of mono-crystalline Si solar cells subject to low-concentration illumination conditions. The contributions of different solar cell parameters, diffusion capacitance, transition capacitance, diffusion resistance, recombination resistance and back surface field have been resolved using the AC impedance spectroscopy technique. The feasibility of commercially available mono-crystalline Si solar cells for LCPV applications has been explored by investigating the DC current–voltage characteristics under varying illumination. The findings reported here demonstrate the importance of DC and AC characterization for evaluation of the performance indicating parameters of Si solar cells under non-equilibrium conditions differing from 1 sun.
