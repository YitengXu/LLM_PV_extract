Although, similarly to the related C60–donor dyads, no significant electronic interaction has been observed between the three electroactive components in the ground state, namely two C60 units and the electron-donor fragment, the presence of a second C60 cage provides enhanced photophysical properties to the final triads in comparison to the related dyads. These findings suggest the presence of a cooperative effect. Some of these C60 dumbbell triads have been applied in the construction of photovoltaic devices and the results obtained indicate that they can play a very active role in the emerging field of optoelectronic devices.Luis Sánchez, Ma

Introduction
The absorption of sunlight by plants and bacteria initiates photosynthesis: cascades of energy and electron transfer (ET and eT) events, which eventually results in the conversion of CO2 and H2O into glucose and energy (ATP). The transfer of electrons is produced stepwise over a series of redox-active cofactors thus spanning the cell membrane. In each step, a fraction of energy is lost and the distance between charges of different sign increases. It is important to note that all these events are produced in a rigid matrix and, therefore, in well-ordered media. The success of Nature in converting inexpensive, non-polluting and inexhaustible sunlight into energy has stimulated investigation of this natural process in order to emulate it. The quest for biomimetic systems is a very active field in science. Artificial photosynthetic models could reduce the complicated natural mechanism to its basic elements, leading to a better understanding of the photosynthetic process. Additionally, these artificial systems have been widely used in molecular-scale optoelectronics (especially in the field of organic solar cells), photonics, sensors design, and other areas of nanotechnology. Either to mimic photosynthesis or to build optoelectronic devices, absorption of light, followed by an electron transfer process, which leads to the corresponding radical-pair species, is necessary. Therefore, the minimum requirements for such biomimetic models must involve: i) the presence of an electron donor (D) connected to an electron acceptor (A); ii) the ability of one of those electroactive components to absorb visible light, thus acting as an antenna, and iii) an organizational principle that controls their electronic interactions (and therefore the rates and yields of electron transfer, eT).1
In the development of these photosynthetic models, the spherical electron accepting [60]fullerene molecule plays a crucial role. There are several important reasons that render C60 as a very appealing candidate for the preparation of biomimetic architectures: i) the easy chemical functionalization of fullerenes, which has allowed the incorporation of most of the organic functional groups covalently linked to the carbon framework,2 ii) the delocalization of charges within the spherical carbon cages3 and iii) the ability of C60 to accept up to six electrons upon reduction (the first redox potential at values similar to that of quinones).4
Although there are many strategies for the application of the basic physical and chemical principles of photosynthesis to artificial systems, the assembly of the two electroactive units provides the necessary pathway that allows photoinduced electron transfer to compete with the usual photophysical pathways that depopulate excited states. The most studied approach for the interconnection of the two electroactive fragments consists of the covalent binding of both D and A moieties which has given rise to a plethora of C60–donor dyads.5
The similarity of porphyrins (P) to the natural electron donor centers has made this kind of chromophore the main choice for the preparation of many C60–P dyads (Chart 1).6 Nevertheless, other classes of electron donor compounds have also been used, for instance, organometallic complexes, such as ferrocenes7 or Ru(II) bipyridine,8 carotenes,9 aniline derivatives,10
				π-conjugated oligomers11a–c and phthalocyanines,11d and tetrathiafulvalene derivatives12 (Chart 1).
 Chart 1  Some representative electron donor moieties assembled with C60 to obtain dyads. 
Despite the supremacy of the covalent linkage between the two electroactive chromophores over the non-covalent interactions, the latter are also being used to obtain supramolecular entities. The resulting architectures combine the fascinating world of Supramolecular Chemistry with research in the field of fullerenes.13
Most of these electroactive dyads undergo not only a fast charge separation upon excitation but also a rapid, and less-desirable, charge recombination (CR), thus decreasing the lifetimes of the corresponding charge separated state to the range of a few nanoseconds. This range is too low to carry out any useful process involving radical pairs. To overcome this problem the sequential assembly of several electroactive fragments gives rise to triads, tetrads, pentads, etc., whose long-distance radical pairs present remarkably larger lifetimes (ranging up to milliseconds!) due to the cascade of charge transfer steps.14 However, the synthesis of these sophisticated systems is highly time consuming and, therefore, quite expensive. A new approach able to enhance the eT and to slow down the CR process is then necessary. In this regard, a very elegant route to address such a challenge has been the synthesis of C60 dimers15 connected through an electroactive spacer. The resulting triads are easier to prepare, provide larger lifetimes for the resulting charge-separated intermediates and, additionally, the presence of two C60 fragments could contribute to establish well-ordered solid phases, which is a crucial factor in the field of optoelectronic devices research.
The aim of this article is twofold: i) to summarize the most recent achievements regarding the synthesis and properties of C60 dimers covalently bridged by electroactive spacers and, ii) to compare, when it is possible, the properties of these dumbbell triads with their analogous dyads, highlighting the beneficial effect that a second C60 moiety has on their photophysical properties.
C60 dumbbells endowed with electroactive bridges
The general strategy for the synthesis of C60–donor–C60 triads consists of a twofold cycloaddition of the corresponding bifunctional starting material to [60]fullerene. The symmetry of the precursors needed for the corresponding triads usually implies less-demanding synthetic efforts than the related dyads, since the synthetic protocols to obtain organic compounds bearing two symmetric functional groups are well established. In the Introduction the most commonly used electron donor fragments in this field were summarized. They have also been employed to obtain the respective C60–D–C60 systems. Therefore, in this article, we will highlight the main recent achievements involving these appealing C60-based structures.
C60–piperazine–C60 dumbbell triad
Our research group reported one of the first examples of such dumbbells in 1996.16 In this case, the electron donor fragment is a piperazine, which formally can be considered as a double dimethylaniline moiety (1). The triad was obtained by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the azomethine ylide, generated in situ from the piperazine dialdehyde and N-methylglicine, and one of the double bonds of C60. The presence of the two C60 moieties led to a highly insoluble material whose cyclic voltammogram showed the presence of the two electroactive units. These electrochemical measurements also demonstrated the absence of electronic interaction between the aniline-type donor and the [60]fullerene moiety (Fig. 1).

C60–porphyrin–C60 dumbbell triads
Porphyrins (P) have also been used to connect two C60 units, thus forming the corresponding C60–P–C60 triads. Diederich et al. reported one of the first examples in 1998.17 The synthesis of triad 3 (Scheme 1) was carried out by macrocyclization of the porphyrin-tethered bismalonates (2) following a Bingel synthetic protocol and long dodecyloxy chains were introduced in order to increase the solubility of these triads. However, as occurs for triad 1, the P moiety does not exert any remarkable electronic effect over the C60 cages and vice versa in the ground state.
 Scheme 1  Regioselective synthesis of the highly soluble Bingel-type C60–P–C60 triad (3). 
Whereas the photophysical properties of C60–P dyads have been thoroughly investigated, the same does not occur for the related triads.6 One of the few examples including photophysical details was reported by Imahori et al. in 1998.18 In this communication, a comparative study was reported for fulleropyrrolidines bearing a porphyrin fragment (Chart 2). Although not many details are provided in the article, the authors state that either for dyad 4a or for triad 4b, strong quenching of the fluorescence intensities is observed in comparison to the separated redox chromophores. Interestingly, this quenching is more noticeable for triad 4b than for dyad 4a. To the best of our knowledge, no further photophysical data have been reported for triad 4b. Nevertheless the changes in the fluorescence intensities reveals a beneficial effect of a second fullerene unit on the photophysical properties of such systems.

In 2000, Diederich et al. described the synthesis and a comparative study of the properties of a cyclophane-type C60–P dyad (5a) as well as a C60–P–C60 dumbbell triad (5b).19 The synthesis of such molecules was accomplished by following a Bingel strategy, in a similar fashion to that mentioned for triad 3. As expected, the redox properties of dyad 5a and triad 5b showed no mutual interactions between the electroactive fragments in the ground state, despite their close spatial proximity. However, the steady-state and time-resolved absorption as well as fluorescence studies demonstrated the formation of a charge-transfer state for both systems. Remarkably, both molecules presented no substantial changes in their photophysical properties. The authors claim that these findings can be accounted for by considering a face-to-face fullerene–porphyrin interaction for both 5a and 5b. In the case of 5b, this implies the preference of conformational change in such a way that conformation II is preferred over conformation I (Chart 3).
 Chart 3  a) C60-P parachute dyad 5a; b) conformational changes in triad 5b. 
One of the most recent examples of C60–P–C60 dumbbell systems was described by Diederich et al. who reported the synthesis as well as the redox and photophysical properties of a triply fused C60–diporphyrin–C60 ensemble (8). As in compounds 3 and 5, the synthetic strategy consisted of a Bingel reaction between the corresponding bismalonate bearing the triply fused diporphyrin system (7), which is, in turn, obtained in a multistep synthetic procedure from the diaryl-P 6 (Scheme 2).20
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of the triple fused C60–P–C60 triad (8). 
The target triad 8 presented exceptional and very rich redox properties. Thus, the DPV measurements showed nine reversible redox events, which involve 15 electrons (Fig. 2). On the oxidation side, four waves appear involving one electron each and corresponding to the triply fused porphyrin moiety. Regarding the reduction side, the first wave (−1.0 V) is partially overlapped and involves three electrons: two due to both C60 fragments and the other one corresponding to the reduction of the porphyrin. In the second wave (−1.35 V), the second reduction of both fullerene cages and that of the P moiety can be observed and therefore, corresponds to a net process of three electrons. The third reduction wave (−1.85 V) only corresponds to two electrons as a consequence of the third one electron reduction of both C60 units and, finally, in the fourth wave (−2.28 V) another three electrons are involved corresponding to the final reduction of the P and the fourth reduction process of both fullerenes.

Surprisingly, the absorption spectrum of compound 8 does not fit with the sum of the separated components of the triad and, although the spectral changes are smaller than those observed for other conjugates with face-to-face alignment of porphyrin and C60 moieties,20 this fact can be accounted for by weak electronic interchromophoric interactions. In the fluorescence experiments a drastic quenching is observed which has been ascribed to an energy transfer (ET) event since the excitation of the fullerene moieties is followed by the sensitisation of the singlet state of the P. Therefore, despite the good electron donor character of the triply fused P systems, no electron transfer process was observed.
C60–oligomer–C60 dumbbell triads
Organic solar cells constituted by semiconducting polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunctions have provided high efficiencies for the conversion of sunlight into power. However, one of the main drawbacks for this kind of device is spontaneous phase separation.21 To overcome this problem, one of the strategies used consisted of the covalent attachment of π-conjugated oligomers of different nature [oligo-phenylenevinylenes (OPVs); oligo-thienylenevinylenes (OTVs); oligo-phenyleneethynylenes (OPEs); etc.] to the C60 surface.11c In this regard, Nierengarten et al.22a described in 2000 the first example of this molecular approach to photovoltaic devices and, since then, an important number of entities of this type have been reported so far. The first one involving a dumbbell triad was a series of C60–oligothiophene–C60 (9) ensembles reported by Janssen in 2000 (Chart 4, a).22b More recently, this research group has also described the synthesis and the photophysical studies of a new series of dumbbell triads in which the donor moiety is a thiophene–pyrrole–thiophene unit (10) (Chart 4, b).23 The synthetic procedure followed to obtain these triads was similar to that mentioned for compound 1 (Fig. 1).
 Chart 4  C60 dumbbells bridged by electroactive heterocyclic spacers. 
For both architectures the photophysical studies show the formation of a radical pair whose lifetime [in the range of subnanoseconds] strongly depends on the solvent polarity. However, photoexcitation of films of triads 9b (n = 2) and 9c (n = 3) led to a charge-separated state in the range of milliseconds in an intermolecular fashion. These values are significantly higher in comparison to those observed for radical ions in solution, thus suggesting an ordering effect in the solid state.
Otsubo et al. have also used oligothiophenes (nT) to bind two [60]fullerenes. These authors have reported not only the synthesis of these so-called C60–nT–C60 triads (13) (Scheme 3), but also have prepared the corresponding PV devices using this kind of dumbbell compounds as single component.24a Whereas the PV cells Al/13/Au corresponding to 13a and 13b showed no photocurrent upon irradiation with 10 µW cm−2 monochromatic light, the sandwich devices for 13c and 13d presented efficiency values of 0.50% and 0.65%, respectively.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of C60–nT–C60 triads 13a–d. 
It is worth mentioning that the same authors had also reported the synthesis and preparation of organic solar cells by using dyads C60–nT (14) in which only a C60 fragment is connected to the oligothiophene unit.24b
The energy conversion efficiency of Al/14/Au strongly depends on the side that the cell is irradiated, being twofold when the irradiation is on the Al side (0.32%) instead of on the Au side (Chart 5). These findings suggest that the nT moieties act as an efficient network for the hole transport in the film. However, fullerenes do not interact with each other to promote electron transport. Interestingly, the presence of a second C60 cage in triads 13 somehow enhances the interactions among the fullerene units creating a more ordered network and, therefore increasing the power efficiencies.
 Chart 5  PV cells prepared from dyad 14. The efficiency of the cell varies with the illumination side. 
In our research group, we have described a series of new oligomeric frameworks covalently linked to two fullerene moieties (15a–d, Chart 6), which were prepared by Prato's procedure (Fig. 1).25 In particular, different arylene units ranging from naphthalene and benzene to thiophene with diverse electrochemical and excited-state properties have been incorporated into π-conjugated backbones (Chart 6).26 The different nature of the oligomeric spacers has allowed either the absorption wavelength of the chromophore or the oxidation potential of the oligomeric donor moiety to be tuned.
 Chart 6  Oligomeric triads (15) and dyad 16. 
The photophysical measurements demonstrated that both singlet–singlet energy transfer as well as intramolecular electron transfer take place and are in competition with each other. Interestingly, the comparison between the lifetime of the corresponding charge-separated states for dyads 1626b (τ = 1.37 ns) with their analogous triads 15d (τ = 1.84 µs) clearly indicates that the incorporation of a second fullerene unit generates a beneficial effect in terms of stabilizing the product and enhancing the yield of charge separation.
Another type of oligomeric electroactive spacer used to prepare fullerene dumbbells is the oligo(phenyleneethynylenes) (OPEs). In this regard, Tour et al. have recently described the synthesis and the redox properties of a series of OPEs end-capped with two fullerenes (18; Scheme 4).27 The synthetic procedure followed by Tour et al. consisted of the addition of the corresponding lithium acetylide by following the conditions previously reported by Komatsu et al.28 The redox studies carried out for compound 18 indicate that no electronic communication is observed between the two fullerenes and the OPE unit since only a set of quasi-reversible reduction waves appears in the cyclic voltammogram. Although no further data about photophysical studies were given in this article, the authors detected a fluorescence quenching of compound 18 in comparison with its OPE precursor 17.
 Scheme 4  Synthesis of fullerene dumbbell 18 by lithium acetylide addition to C60. 
We have also used OPEs, in which the oligomer length has been systematically increased from the monomer to the heptamer, to connect two C60 cages (21). The synthesis of target C60–OPE–C60 triads was carried out by following a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition protocol starting from the arylalkynyl precursor 19 (Chart 7).29 As occurs for triads 18, C60 dumbbells 21 showed amphoteric redox behaviour, due to the presence of both donor (OPEs) and acceptor (C60) moieties, but without appreciable electronic interaction between them.
 Chart 7  Synthesis and deactivation pathways of C60–OPE–C60 triads 21. 
Excited state studies carried out by fluorescence showed a dramatic and instantaneous deactivation in the 500–700 nm range which corresponds to the OPE fragment. Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments demonstrated an efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the photoexcited phenylene-acetylenes to the covalently linked fullerene, although a weak competitive electron transfer could also operate in the deactivation process. Consequently, it can be assumed that upon the completion of the singlet–singlet energy transfer, the fullerene singlet excited state can only decay to the triplet excited state and finally to the singlet ground state (see Chart 7).
The related C60–OPE dyads have been studied by Nierengarten et al.30 Preliminary results on the photophysical properties of these dyads showed a strong quenching of the luminescence of the OPE by the fullerene moiety, indicative of the occurrence of an intramolecular decay process. Unfortunately, the lack of data regarding the lifetime of the charge separated state of these dyads prevents a reliable comparison with their corresponding C60–OPE–C60 dumbbells 21.
C60–TTF–C60 dumbbell triads
All the above donor units present a common feature: they all lose totally or partially their aromatic character upon the oxidation process that accompanies the formation of the charge separated state. In this regard, tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs), in their one-electron oxidized form (namely, the 1,3-dithiolium cation), display a (4n + 2) aromatic character, in contrast to the non-aromatic ground state. In view of electron-transfer processes, this gain of aromaticity is an important requisite, assisting in the stabilization of charge separated radical pairs. Others and we have reported the synthesis as well as the photophysical properties of dyads12 and triads31 based on C60 and TTF units.
In 2000, we reported the photophysical properties of triad 24, which, in turn, was obtained by an esterification procedure starting from fullerene carboxylic acid 22 and dialcohol 23 in the presence of DCC and DMAP as activating agents (Scheme 5). The presence of the triethyleneglycol tail in the dumbbell provides high solubility to compound 24.31
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of C60–TTF–C60 dumbbell 24. 
As in the case of the examples summarized above, the cyclic voltammetry measurements of compound 24 reveal no notable interaction between the chromophores in the ground state. Nevertheless, photophysical data indicate that in the excited state an intramolecular electron transfer, evolving from the TTF donor to the singlet state of C60, prevails, yielding a long-lived charge separated radical pair (1–2 ns in DMF). Although we must take into account that the substitution patterns of the C60 derivatives are a bit different, the photophysical features of the triad 24 notably differ from that of the C60–TTF dyad (25) (Chart 8).12e In the case of the C60–TTF dyad 25 the deactivation pathways form the corresponding short-lived C60˙−-TTF˙+ radical pair (1–2 ns), which, subsequently, is deactivated to the triplet-state of C60 followed by an intermolecular charge separation process affording the corresponding intermolecular radical pair, namely (C60˙−–TTF) + (C60–TTF˙+) (Chart 8). Therefore, the presence of a second [60]fullerene unit in triad 24 not only changes drastically the mechanism of deactivation upon excitation but also increases the lifetime of the intramolecular radical pair. Again, a notable stabilization effect can be observed as a consequence of the presence of two C60 units in the same molecule.
 Chart 8  C60–TTF dyad 25 and its deactivation pathways. 
Despite the interest of this kind of structure in the development of optoelectronic devices, to the best of our knowledge, just another couple of examples of C60–TTF–C60 ensembles have been reported in the literature (see 26 and 27 in Chart 9). In 1997, Delhaès et al. reported the synthesis of several TTF derivatives covalently attached to two [60]fullerene moieties (26) and even to four C60 units by means of an esterification reaction.32 As expected, the cyclic voltammetric measurements of such C60–TTF assemblies presented four reduction waves corresponding to the C60 cages and two oxidation waves corresponding to the TTF core. Similarly to triads 24, the redox potential values demonstrated no, or very weak, electronic interactions between the two redox chromophores.
 Chart 9  C60–TTF–C60 dumbbell triads. 
Hudhomme et al. have also described a C60–TTF–C60 dumbbell assembly (27) that was prepared by a two-fold Diels–Alder cycloaddition in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) as solvent and in the dark.33 Despite the insolubility of such a C60 dumbbell both the redox properties and the ESR spectra were determined. The cyclic voltammogram of compound 27 in ODCB exhibited two oxidation waves (+0.58 and +1.12 V) corresponding to the TTF fragment together with the first three reduction waves of the fullerenes (−0.65, −1.02 and −1.56 V, respectively). The redox potentials obtained indicate the lack of electronic interaction in the ground state. The ESR spectra provided definitive information about the electronic structure of triad 27 since the signals corresponding to the radical cation as well as that of the radical anion were unequivocally assigned upon controlled oxidation and reduction, respectively.
More recently, we have carried out the preparation of new C60–TTF–C60 dumbbell structures where a higher degree of stabilisation of the oxidised donor via adding aromatic arenes to the heteroaromatic rings of TTF has been accomplished (see Scheme 6).34 Addition of the latter enhances the aromatic stabilisation energy. In the oxidised form, the π-conjugation is extended over the entire anthracene backbone and as a net result, the dicationic species is completely aromatic. The reaction of this kind of π-extended TTFs (exTTFs) endowed with two malonate moieties (28) by using the Bingel cyclopropanation chemical approach yields triad 29 together with the intramolecular bisadduct and the corresponding dyad.34 The electrochemical data reveal that both exTTF and C60 electroactive moieties do not interact in the ground state. Unfortunately, the CV studies of triad 29 showed the presence of intramolecular bisadducts and although the formation of these derivatives is not clear at present, formation under reductive electrochemical conditions involving a retro-cyclopropanation process is suggested and triad 29 is not electrochemically stable.35

Enantiopure C60–binaphthyl–C60 triads
Finally, we would like to remark upon the contribution of our research group to the synthesis of enantiomerically pure C60 triads. It is known that fulleropyrrolidines generated by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to C60, like compounds 1, 4, 9, etc., present a stereogenic centre (marked with an asterisk in compound 1, Fig. 1). However, to the best of our knowledge, no fulleropyrrolidine stereoisomers have been yet isolated, this type of C60 derivative always being isolated as a racemic mixture. Thus, the synthesis of enantiopure fullerenes is a topic that has received scarce attention. Only a few examples of C60 chiral monoadducts have been reported in the literature.36 With the challenge of obtaining a chiral triad in mind, we decide to employ the enantiopure 1,1′-binaphthyl core, which is being used as an important building block for the construction of complex systems in areas such as asymmetric catalysis, nonlinear optics and photoluminescence.37 Two different chiral C60–binaphthyl–C60 triads were achieved starting from enantiopure dialdehyde (R)-30. C60 dimer (R)-32 was obtained by a subsequent reduction and esterification reactions from (R)-30 (Scheme 7). (R)-34 was synthesized by following a Bamford–Stevens protocol from tosylhydrazone (R)-33 and treatment with sodium methoxyde, pyridine and C60 (Scheme 7).38
 Scheme 7  1,1′-Binaphthyl-based enantiopure C60 dimers. 
The inclusion of this triad within this special kind of electroactive dumbbell C60 derivative can be unequivocally accounted for by considering their redox properties. In the cyclic voltammograms of compounds (R)-32 and (R)-34 four reduction waves appear corresponding to both C60 cores. Additionally, on the oxidation side, an irreversible wave corresponding to the alkoxynaphthalene moiety is observed at 1.42 and 1.44 V, respectively. Work is currently in progress to determine the photophysical properties of these new chiral systems.
Summary and conclusions
We have reviewed in this article the most recent examples of C60 dumbbells. Using different electron-donor moieties such as porphyrins, π-conjugated oligomers or TTFs, the connection between the two fullerene cages has been accomplished. The electrochemical properties of most of C60-dumbbell triads considered indicate the lack of electronic interaction between the three electroactive moieties, namely two C60 units and the corresponding electron-donor fragment. Additionally, the photophysical properties of these systems have been summarized. When possible, the photophysical features for the radical pairs formed by photoinduced electron transfer processes have been provided. In general, these data reveal highly stabilized charge-separated states. On the other hand, several of these systems have already been tested as the active layer in photovoltaic devices shedding promising results.
The comparison of the properties of the C60–donor–C60 entities with their analogous dyads has been highlighted. In principle, the presence of a second fullerene unit seems to produce a stabilizing electronic or structural effect on the photogenerated ion radical pair, although the contribution of this second unit is unclear at present.
In conclusion, C60 dumbbells bridged by an electron-donor fragment constitute a special class of systems within the huge family of fullerene derivatives whose properties, together with their synthetically less-demanding cost, can open new expectations in the application of fullerenes in the field of optoelectronic devices. In this regard, more research on the synthesis of new systems and study of their photophysical properties is crucial in order to clarify the observed beneficial effect of a second fullerene core.

									Ángeles Herranz and Nazario Martín (left to right)	Luis Sánchez (left) is Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM), Spain. He received his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry at the University Complutense of Madrid in 1997, where he carried out the synthesis and studied the properties of C60–donor dyads and triads. From 1999 to 2000 he worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Professor Jan C. (Kees) Hummelen (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) on the synthesis of supramolecular architectures based on C60 and their application in the preparation of organic solar cells. In 2002, he was appointed as an associate professor at UCM. His current research interests are focussed on new supramolecular C60-based ensembles especially in the study of electron transfer processes and photovoltaic applications.
	Ma
								Ángeles Herranz (center) obtained her Ph.D. in 2001 from the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM) under Profs. Nazario Martín and Carlos Seoane, working on the synthesis and properties of donor–acceptor systems based on [60]fullerene and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). Starting in 2001, she spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Luis Echegoyen, first at the University of Miami (Florida, USA) and then at Clemson University (South Carolina, USA), where she was engaged in a number of projects, including electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical characterization of new TTF-based dyads, and characterization of fullerene-derived materials employing electrochemical, ESR, and NMR techniques. Currently she holds a position as research associate at UCM, where she is focussed on the chemistry of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes and the study of their electronic properties for applications in materials science.
	Nazario Martín (right) studied chemistry at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM), where he obtained his Doctorate at the Department of Organic Chemistry in 1984. After spending a year working on X-ray contrast agents in a pharmaceutical company, he worked as postdoctoral fellow (1987–1988) with Prof. Michael Hanack at the Institut für Organische Chemie der Universität Tübingen on electrically conducting organic materials. In 1994, he was a visiting Professor with Prof. Fred Wudl at the Institute for Polymers and Organic Solids (IPOS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) working on the chemistry of fullerenes. He is currently full professor of Organic Chemistry at University Complutense of Madrid (UCM). His research interests range over electroactive molecules with emphasis on the covalent and supramolecular chemistry of fullerenes, electron donor tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) and π-conjugated oligomers and dendrimers in the context of electron transfer processes and photovoltaic applications. He is currently a member of the International Advisory Editorial Board of Journal of Materials Chemistry, Regional Editor for Europe of the journal Fullerenes, Nanotubes and Carbon Nanostructures, and General Editor of the Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry. He has published over 250 peer reviewed papers in addition to several book chapters and other scientific articles. He has been guest co-editor of the special issue “Functionalized Fullerene Materials” in the Journal of Materials Chemistry and is co-editor of four books on New Materials and Fullerenes.
