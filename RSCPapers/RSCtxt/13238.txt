    , Accepted 29th September 2022First published on 29th September 2022AbstractOptimizing active layer morphology and broadening spectrum utilization range are important methods to improve the performance of organic solar cells. In this study, PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary organic solar cells were prepared with a layer-by-layer sequential deposition method. The introduction of the fullerene derivative PC71BM as the third component into the PM6/Y6 binary system improves light absorption and boosts the open-circuit voltage. PC71BM works as a morphology regulator to facilitate Y6 diffusion into the PM6 layer and increase the contact interface between the PM6 layer and Y6 layer, which enhances exciton dissociation probability and provides a cascade energy level alignment for efficient charge transport. The independent carrier transport channels provided by the pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction improve charge transport performance and inhibit carrier recombination. The comprehensive utilization of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors, the combination of the pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction and the ternary strategy synergistically boost the power conversion efficiency from 16.44% for the PM6/Y6 binary device to 17.82% for the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device, and the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device exhibits better stability. Pseudo-bilayer ternary planar heterojunction is a promising device structure to achieve high performance organic solar cells for potential commercial applications.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention as a potential renewable energy source because of the unique features of light weight, solution-processability, feasibility of preparing semi-transparent and flexible devices and so on. With the development of non-fullerene small molecule acceptor materials and the improvement of device preparation technology, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells has been continuously improved.1–4 Recently Peng et al. reported 19.05% PCE5 and Min et al. reported 19.17% PCE6 in single junction organic solar cells, and Hou et al. obtained a PCE of 20.2% in a tandem organic solar cell.7
Most of the reported high-efficiency organic solar cells are based on the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer structure. The BHJ active layer, which is prepared by mixing the donor and acceptor materials together and then spin-coating or blade coating the blends, provides a ubiquitous donor/acceptor interface on the nano-scale. The photoelectric conversion process of organic solar cells includes light absorption, exciton generation, exciton diffusion and dissociation, and charge transport and collection. The BHJ active layer solves the problem of the short exciton diffusion distance in organic semiconductor materials and provides sufficient donor/acceptor interface for efficient exciton dissociation. However, the BHJ active layer has its inherent disadvantages. The nanoscale active layer morphology of the BHJ is spontaneously formed during the donor and acceptor blend solution deposition and drying, and often the thermodynamically favourable morphology does not yield preeminent device performance,8 for instance the isolated island of the donor or acceptor component quarantine charge, and the charge carriers (electrons or holes) around the acceptor or donor island cannot transport to the corresponding electrodes (cathode and anode), resulting in inevitable charge loss.9 The recently reported pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic photovoltaic devices prepared by layer-by-layer sequential deposition exhibit an ideal vertical phase separation morphology with the structure of higher donor concentration near the anode and more acceptor composition near the cathode, and the vertical graded donor–acceptor mixing in the intermediate region.4,10,11 The PPHJ active layer provides a relatively large donor acceptor interface for exciton dissociation, and charge carriers can transport to electrodes through their respective channels. The PPHJ provides an effective strategy to overcome the inherent problems of BHJ devices and demonstrates comparable or superior photovoltaic performance to those of the traditional BHJ OSCs,12–14 and the maximum PCE of the PPHJ devices was reported as 19.05% in the D18/L8-BO system.15
Besides the optimized active layer morphology, light absorption of the active layer is the first factor that influences the performance of organic solar cells. The limited absorption bandwidth of conventional binary component OSCs limits the utilization of the solar spectrum. By adding a third component with spectral complementarity into the binary donor/acceptor system, ternary organic solar cells have a widened utilization range of the solar spectrum, which significantly improves the PCE of organic solar cells.16–18 The introduction of the third component has also been reported to have the advantages of improving the miscibility of the three components and enhancing the stability of OSCs.16,19,20
In this study, we fabricated single donor two acceptor pseudo-bilayer ternary bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices by synergistically combining the advantage of pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction active layer and ternary strategy, and achieved improved photovoltaic performances and stability. The wide band gap polymer material poly [(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro) thiophen-2-yl)-benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(10,30-di-2-thienyl-50,70-bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzo [10,20-c:40,50-c0]dithiophene-4,8 dione))] (PM6) was used as the donor, the non-fullerene small molecule material 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′] thieno [2′,3′:4,5] pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b] indole-2,10-diyl) bis(methanylylidene)) bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inde) (Y6) was used as the host acceptor, and the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was used as the third component acceptor, and ternary organic solar cells with the active layer of PM6/Y6:PC71BM were prepared using the layer-by-layer sequential deposition method. The introduction of PC71BM into the PM6/Y6 system enhances the light absorption in the short wavelength region, and improves the open circuit voltage (VOC) for the boosted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of PC71BM; meanwhile PC71BM as a morphology regulator improves the contact characteristics between the donor layer and acceptor layer, boosts charge transport performance and suppresses carrier recombination, and the prepared PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary OSCs exhibit enhanced VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), and a better PCE of 17.82% is achieved (while the PCE of the PM6/Y6 binary LBL device is 16.44%). Table S1† summarizes the recent progress of high performance ternary BHJ OSCs and PPHJ OSCs, and the PCE of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device in this study is among the highest PCEs of PM6/Y6 (or PM6:Y6) based OSCs. This work shows that the combination of non-fullerene acceptors and fullerene acceptors can significantly improve the performance of OSCs. And this work also demonstrates that pseudo-bilayer ternary planar heterojunction is a promising device structure to obtain high performance OSCs for potential commercial applications.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials and devices

Fig. 1a shows the molecular structure of PM6, Y6 and PC71BM, and Fig. 1b exhibits the energy level alignment of the materials used in this study. As can be seen from the gradually increasing LUMO of PM6, PC71BM and Y6 in Fig. 1b, the introduction of PC71BM into the PM6/Y6 active layer would generate a cascade energy level for efficient electron transport.21,22Fig. 1c shows the preparation process of the BHJ OSCs, the PM6:Y6:PC71BM blend solution was directly spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film. Fig. 1d demonstrates the device structure of a conventional ternary BHJ. Fig. 1e illustrates the preparation process of the pseudo-bilayer active layer; PM6 solution was first spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer, and then the Y6:PC71BM blend solution was spin-coated on the PM6 film. The solvent used in the Y6:PC71BM blend is chloroform (CF), and the CF solvent would sweep the PM6 film and Y6:PC71BM diffuse into the PM6 layer, resulting in the formation of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM active layer. In the preparation of the pseudo-bilayer ternary OSCs, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and 2,9-bis[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]-anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetrone (PDIN) were used as anode and cathode buffer layers, respectively. The prepared pseudo-bilayer ternary device has the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6/Y6:PC71BM/PDIN/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1f.

2.2 Optical properties

Fig. 2a shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of pure PM6, Y6 and PC71BM films. PM6 shows a strong absorption in the wavelength region of 300–700 nm with an absorption peak at 610 nm, and Y6 exhibits a broad and strong absorption in the wavelength range of 600–900 nm, with an absorption peak at 830 nm, while PC71BM shows a strong absorption in the short wavelength region of 300–450 nm with an absorption peak at 380 nm, and the three materials have good spectral complementarity in the ultraviolet light, visible light and near infrared regions. Fig. 2b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the PM6/Y6, PM6:Y6:PC71BM and PM6/Y6:PC71BM films, and the weight ratio of Y6:PC71BM in the ternary component films is 0.9:0.1. Compared with the PM6/Y6 film, the PM6/Y6:PC71BM films exhibit obvious absorption enhancement in the short-wavelength range of 300–680 nm, which can be attributed to the introduction of PC71BM. The absorption performances of the PM6, Y6, PC71BM, PM6/Y6, PM6:Y6:PC71BM and PM6/Y6:PC71BM films can also be seen in the photograph in Fig. S1.†

Photoluminescence (PL) characterization was performed to study the exciton recombination dynamics of the pseudo-bilayer active layer films. Fig. 2c shows the PL spectra of the PM6, PM6/Y6, PM6/Y6:PC71BM and PM6:Y6:PC71BM films. Because there is no effective donor/acceptor (D/A) interface for exciton dissociation in the pristine PM6 film, when 287 nm ultraviolet light illuminates the films, almost all the excitons are recombined, and the PM6 film exhibits a strong PL emission peak at 689 nm. For the PM6:Y6:PC71BM active layer film, the BHJ structure provides a ubiquitous D/A interface for exciton dissociation, and the PL is almost completely quenched. The PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM films exhibit comparable PL spectra with the PM6:Y6:PC71BM BHJ film, which indicates that excitons are dissociated effectively in the pseudo-bilayer films. The quenching efficiency of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM film is superior to that of the PM6/Y6 film, thus indicating more efficient exciton dissociation after the introduction of PC71BM.23Fig. 2d shows the PL spectra of the PC71BM, Y6 and Y6:PC71BM films, and the PL peaks of PC71BM and Y6 are at 720 nm and 889 nm, respectively. After adding PC71BM into Y6, the Y6:PC71BM film exhibits the PL peak of 874 nm and the PL intensity increases, which demonstrates that there exists energy transfer from PC71BM into Y6.24–27 The mechanism of energy transfer can be classified into Dexter energy transfer (DET) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), in which DET refers to an electron exchange interaction, while FRET features dipole-induced Coulombic interaction between the photoactive materials.28 In fact, FRET is a non-radiative energy transfer process from the energy donor to the energy acceptor through long-distance dipole–dipole Coulomb interactions. The emission spectrum of PC71BM and the absorption spectrum of Y6 are shown in Fig. S2.† The overlap of the PC71BM PL spectrum and Y6 absorption spectrum also implies the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer from PC71BM to Y6.28–30 The overlap between the fluorescence spectrum of the FRET donor (PC71BM) and the absorption spectrum of the FRET acceptor (Y6) leads to a resonance, which will be beneficial for energy transfer from the excited energy donor to the ground state energy acceptor electronically without any photon emission.29 The energy donor can absorb solar photons to generate photogenerated excited states and subsequently transfer the energy to the “energy acceptor,” which will be beneficial for more exciton harvesting. FRET between PC71BM and Y6 leads to efficient exciton dissociation and improved device performance as compared to the binary device. Our results demonstrate that a ternary blend with efficient FRET is a promising strategy to further advance the organic photovoltaic technology to a higher standard even without fully complementary absorption.31
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance parameters were optimized by controlling the donor layer/acceptor layer thickness and component ratio of Y6 to PC71BM, and the details of the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves are shown in Fig. S3–S5,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables S2 and S3†. Fig. 3a presents the J–V curves of the optimized PM6/Y6, PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary BHJ and PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer devices under the AM 1.5 G spectrum with 100 mW cm−2 illumination intensity, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The PM6/Y6 binary device shows a PCE of 16.44% with a VOC of 0.835 V, JSC of 26.76 mA cm−2, and FF of 73.57%. With PC71BM adding into the Y6 layer, the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary BHJ devices show a VOC of 0.854 V, JSC of 26.79 mA cm−2, FF of 74.68%, and PCE of 17.09%, and the VOC, JSC and FF values of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device simultaneously increase to 0.855 V, 26.82 mA cm−2 and 77.73%, respectively, and a boosted PCE of 17.82% is obtained. The PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device exhibits better performance than the PM6/Y6 pseudo-bilayer binary device and the PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary BHJ devices. As can be seen in the energy level alignment in Fig. 1b, the guest-acceptor (PC71BM) exhibits higher LUMO levels than the host-acceptor (Y6), which is beneficial to increase the VOC in ternary OSCs.32 The VOC of OSCs is mainly determined by the difference of the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO. The HOMO of PM6 is −5.50 eV, and the LUMO of Y6 and PC71BM is −4.10 eV and −3.90 eV, respectively. The boosted energy level difference from 1.40 eV of the PM6/Y6 system to 1.60 eV of the PM6/PC71BM system is the main reason for the VOC improvement of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM ternary OSCs. The improved spectral absorption of the pseudo-bilayer ternary device enhances the utilization of photons and boosts the JSC, and the optimized active layer morphology would facilitate charge transport and collection and increase the FF (discussed later). Fig. 3b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PM6/Y6, PM6:Y6:PC71BM ternary BHJ and PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary devices, and the integral current density from the EQE spectrum is 25.87 mA cm−2, 25.95 mA cm−2 and 26.02 mA cm−2 for the pseudo-bilayer binary device, ternary BHJ device and pseudo-bilayer ternary devices, respectively. The integral current density from EQE spectra agrees quite well with the JSC obtained from J–V curves within 5% mismatch.
2.4 Charge transport and recombination dynamics
The charge transport and carrier recombination dynamics of the pseudo-bilayer binary and ternary devices were analysed using transient photocurrent/transient photovoltage (TPC/TPV) measurements.33 The TPC measurements were conducted under short-circuit conditions, and the decay of photocurrent indicates that the charge is extracted, and the charge extraction time (τTPC) can be obtained by fitting the TPC decay curve.34 As can be seen from Fig. 4a, the fitted τTPC values are 0.326 μs and 0.206 μs for the pseudo-bilayer binary (PM6/Y6) and ternary (PM6/Y6:PC71BM) devices, respectively. The shorter τTPC value of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device implies that after charge generation, the charges transport more efficiently in the active layer and collection by the electrode.
 Fig. 4  (a) Normalized TPC and (b) TPV decay curves of the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices, and (c) VOC and (d) JSCversus light intensity curves of PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices. 
TPV measurements were utilized to record the voltage decay under open-circuit conditions, which is used to analyse the charge recombination characteristics by studying the carrier lifetime (τTPV).35 Under open-circuit conditions, the decay of the photovoltage indicates the recombination of charge carriers, and the charge carrier lifetimes can be acquired from the TPV decay dynamics.36 The normalized TPV decay curves of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 4b, and the carrier lifetime can be fitted as 10.260 μs and 22.524 μs for the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices, respectively. The longer carrier lifetime of the ternary device indicates weaker carrier recombination in PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices. The weakened carrier recombination and efficient charge transport of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices are beneficial to obtain improved JSC and FF. TPV (sometimes also called open-circuit voltage decay or OCVD) measurements also provide a method to determine the dominant recombination orders of non-geminate recombination. In most high performing solar cells, the losses caused by geminate recombination of unseparated electron–hole pairs are insignificant, while the non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers within the active layer appears as one of the main loss mechanisms.37 The different non-geminate recombination mechanisms can be categorized by the relationship of the recombination rate R(t) and the charge carrier density n(t):38 (1)where k is the recombination coefficient and β is the recombination order. First order recombination (β = 1) is also commonly known as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination, second order recombination (β = 2) is known as band-to-band or bimolecular recombination and third order recombination (β = 3) indicates Auger recombination. Auger recombination is usually not relevant for organic solar cells.39 The recombination order β can be obtained through the second order derivative of the VOC − t trace38,40 (2)where τ is the recombination lifetime, defined as: (3)
The β values are calculated to be 1.62 and 1.88 for the PM6/Y6 binary and PM6/Y6:PC71BM ternary devices, respectively, which indicate that the recombination mechanism in both the pseudo-bilayer binary and ternary devices is the combination of bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination. A β value closer to 2 in the PM6/Y6:PC71BM ternary device suggests that bimolecular recombination would be the dominant recombination mechanism.
The VOC and JSC dependence of light intensity (Plight) was determined to further study charge recombination dynamics. A high-power white LED is implemented as the light source, and the integrated power of the LED is 720 W m−2 (the illumination spectrum of the LED is shown in Fig. S6†). The light intensity dependence of VOC has always been used to distinguish bimolecular and trap assisted recombination in a variety of organic solar cell systems,41 which can be expressed with the equation (4)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, n is the ideality factor, and Plight is the light intensity. Fig. 4c shows the relationship between VOC and light intensity for the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices. It is reported that a system with only bimolecular recombination exhibits the slope of kBT/q,41,42 and a system with trap-assisted recombination will have a slope greater than kBT/q.43 Some literature studies have further reported that traps at the surface would lead to S < kBT/q.37,44,45 Surface recombination is governed by the charge injection/extraction behaviour at the electrode contact interface. Electrons/holes that diffuse to the anode/cathode will recombine with injected holes/electrons, and thus the presence of minority carriers at a contact will reduce the device performance.44 In this study, the prepared pseudo-bilayer OSCs with the device architecture of the donor layer near the anode and the acceptor layer near the cathode avoid the possibility of surface recombination. The calculated slopes of VOCversus ln(Plight) decrease from 1.628 kBT/q for the PM6/Y6 device to 1.292 kBT/q for the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device. The smaller slope of the ternary device indicates that the introduction of PC71BM into the binary system reduces the trap centers in the active layer and suppresses the trap-assisted recombination, which is consistent with the improved charge transport and extraction. Furthermore, the slope of the logarithmic dependence of VOC on light intensity is particularly sensitive to the effect of leakage currents, which originate from the shunt resistance (Rsh), and a reduced Rsh can lead to a slope S > kBT/q.41 The value of Rsh and series resistance (Rs) can be obtained by calculating the differential resistance against the applied bias of the J–V characteristics in the dark.39 The Rs is 9.93 Ω cm2 and 4.73 Ω cm2 for the PM6/Y6 binary and PM6/Y6:PC71BM ternary devices, and the Rsh is 1.72 × 105 Ω cm2 and 3.17 × 105 Ω cm2 for the binary and ternary devices, respectively. In the case of OSC devices, a low shunt resistance results in the overestimation of the slope of VOCversus ln(Plight),41 and a large Rsh would increase the evaluation accuracy of the relationship between VOC and ln(Plight). The boosted Rsh of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device further indicates that the trap-assisted recombination in the active layer is restricted, and bimolecular recombination should be the dominant recombination mechanism.
The dependence of JSC on light intensity (Plight) was measured to further investigate the bimolecular recombination dynamics of the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices, as shown in Fig. 4d. There is a power-law dependence between JSC and Plight: JSC ∝ Plightα(5)

α is the bimolecular recombination coefficient.46 For the OSCs with serious bimolecular recombination, the coefficient α is less than 1, and if there is no bimolecular recombination, the value of α should be 1. Some literature studies also reported that α < 1 can also be caused by the space-charge effects that originate from the imbalanced electron and hole mobility (μe and μh).47–49 The PM6/Y6 high performance OSCs prepared by layer-by-layer sequential deposition exhibit relatively balanced electron and hole mobility with a lower μh/μe ratio between 1.2 and 1.8.1,50–52 The introduction of PC71BM can improve the charge transport properties and yield more balanced charge transport for holes and electrons.53,54 Space-charge-effects induced by imbalanced electron and hole mobility will not affect the analysis of the α value dramatically. The fitted bimolecular recombination coefficient α is 0.986 for the PM6/Y6 device and 0.998 for the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device, which are all close to unity, indicating that bimolecular recombination is restricted in both PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices. In pseudo-bilayer devices, electrons and holes are transported to the corresponding electrode within their own independent channels, so the carrier recombination is effectively inhibited. And the slightly larger α value of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device illustrates that the bimolecular recombination was further suppressed in the pseudo-bilayer ternary device.
Carrier mobility in real working devices was measured with photo-induced charge extraction in linearly increasing voltage (Photo-CELIV) technology. Typically, a light pulse is employed to generate the charge carriers, and linearly increasing voltage (triangular pulse) is applied to extract photo-generated carriers and the mobility is obtained from the peak extraction time of the corresponding transient.55 The carrier mobility μ is calculated as (6)where d is the active layer thickness, A is the ramp rate of the linearly increasing voltage, tmax is the time corresponding to the current peak (jmax), Δj = jmax − jdisp (jdisp is the displacement current), and  is an empirical correction accounting for the redistribution of the electric field. The extracted mobility is composed of a combination of the electron and hole mobility, dominated by the faster carrier mobility.1,52 The carrier mobility provided by the Photo-CELIV technique provides a quantitative comparison to analyse the charge transport characteristics for introducing PC71BM into the PM6/Y6 binary device. The Photo-CELIV curves of the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices are given in Fig. 5a. The PM6/Y6 device exhibits a carrier mobility of 1.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device shows a carrier mobility of 1.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The improved carrier mobility further verifies the excellent charge transport performance in the pseudo-bilayer ternary OSCs, which agrees with the TPC/TPV results. The charge extraction time, carrier recombination lifetime and carrier mobility values for the devices are summarized in Table 2.

The double-logarithmic plots of net photocurrent Jphversus effective voltage Veff were obtained to study the exciton dissociation and charge collection characteristics of the OSCs, where Jph = Jlight − Jdark (Jlight and Jdark are the current density under light illumination and that in the dark), and Veff = V0 − Vcor (V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Vcor is the corrected voltage). The corrected voltage Vcor was obtained by taking into account the voltage losses over the series resistance (RS):39,56Vcor = Vapp − J × RS, where Vapp is the applied bias voltage. The Jph − Veff curve of the pseudo-bilayer PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM devices is shown in Fig. 5b.36 In a slightly larger reverse voltage region, the Jph of both devices is saturated, indicating that all the photo-generated excitons are dissociated and the free carriers are collected by the electrodes, and no bimolecular recombination occurs. Under these circumstances, the maximum Jph can be approximated as Jsat, and the maximum exciton generation rate Gmax can be obtained with the equation57 Jsat = qGmaxd(7)
The Gmax value of the PM6/Y6 device is estimated to be 17.679 × 1026 m−3 s−1, and that of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device is 17.872 × 1026 m−3 s−1. The improved maximum exciton generation rate Gmax indicates that more photons are absorbed and converted into excitons for the pseudo-bilayer ternary device, which is consistent with the absorption enhancement of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM film as shown in Fig. 2b. The charge collection probability P(E,T) can be evaluated with the equation58,59 P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat(8)
Considering that the ratio of Jph/Jsat is substantially the product of exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency, an elevated Jph/Jsat suggests an increased exciton generation rate, exciton dissociation probability, and charge collection efficiency, which leads to a higher FF and JSC for OSCs. The calculated P(E,T) under short-circuit conditions is 98.926% for the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device, which is higher than that of the PM6/Y6 device (98.127%). The improved P(E,T) values indicates that the PM6/Y6:PC71BM device has more efficient charge generation and carrier extraction probability.45
2.5 Morphology and miscibility
To get more insight into the influences of the third component PC71BM on the active layer morphology, Fig. 6 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography and phase images of the PM6, PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM films. The pristine PM6 film exhibits a relative smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.932 nm. With the host acceptor Y6 spin-coating on the PM6 layer, the RMS roughness of the PM6/Y6 film decreases to 0.743 nm. When PC71BM was added into the acceptor layer as the third component, the RMS roughness of the PM6/Y6:PC71BM film is 0.978 nm. As can be seen from the phase image of Fig. 6d, the pristine PM6 film shows a fibril-like texture, and the coverage of Y6 and Y6:PC71BM layers makes the PM6/Y6 and PM6/Y6:PC71BM films exhibit nanoscale phase-separated morphologies with appropriate domain sizes.

To examine the miscibility among PM6, Y6, and PC71BM, contact angle characterization was performed with water (H2O) or ethylene glycol (EG) as a liquid drop. Fig. 7 shows the contact angles of water and ethylene glycol on the neat PM6, Y6 and PC71BM films, and the measured contact angle data are summarized in Table 3. The surface free energies were estimated from the contact angle (θ) according to Owens–Wendt–Kaelble's model.22,60 The miscibility between PM6 and Y6, PC71BM was estimated from the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ2,22,61 using the equation (9)where γA and γB are the surface free energy of components A and B calculated from the contact angle, respectively. The χ parameter was calculated to be 1.505, 0.416 and 0.338 for PM6:Y6, PM6:PC71BM and Y6:PC71BM, respectively. The lower χ values of PM6:PC71BM and Y6:PC71BM indicate that PC71BM is compatible with both PM6 and Y6. And it is inferred from the χ values of PM6:Y6 and PM6:PC71BM that PC71BM has better miscibility with PM6 than Y6, which implies that PC71BM diffuses more easily into the PM6 layer. With the introduction of PC71BM into the Y6 film, the good miscibility of PM6:PC71BM and Y6:PC71BM will make PC71BM promote Y6 to further penetrate into the PM6 film. Therefore, PC71BM works as a morphology regulator, to facilitate Y6 diffusing into the PM6 layer and increasing the donor/acceptor interface, and to improve the contact characteristics between the donor layer and acceptor layer.18,62 The accurate location of PC71BM in the pseudo-bilayer ternary device was predicted by calculating the wetting coefficient (ω) following the equation22,63 (10)

If ωPC71BM > 1, PC71BM should be located in the PM6 domain, and if ωPC71BM < −1, PC71BM should be distributed in the Y6 domain, while if −1 < ωPC71BM < 1, PC71BM should be located at the interface between PM6 and Y6. The wetting coefficient of ωPC71BM was calculated to be −0.06, which indicates that PC71BM tends to distribute at the interface between PM6 and Y6, forming a cascade energy level alignment in the pseudo-bilayer ternary devices which promotes charge transport.64
2.6 Stability
The time-dependent durability of the pseudo-bilayer binary and ternary devices was measured, and the normalized photovoltaic performance decay curves are shown in Fig. 8. The prepared devices (without encapsulation) were stored in tin foil coated Petri dishes, and the Petri dishes were placed in a nitrogen-filled glove box (<0.01 ppm O2 and H2O) under dark conditions. As time goes on, VOC, JSC, FF and the induced PCE of all the devices decrease gradually, and FF exhibits the most obvious decrease. After 125 days of storage, the PCE of the pseudo-bilayer PM6/Y6 binary device decreased to 81.60%, while the PM6/Y6:PC71BM ternary device has maintained 89.73% of its initial value. The above test results on stability show that the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device exhibits better stability than the PM6/Y6 binary device. Some reports also show that the incorporation of a third component can improve the stability of organic solar cells.65–67 Harald Ade et al. proposed a design rule for rational strategy to suppress device degradation driven by thermodynamics: the ideal third component needs to have miscibility in the donor polymer at or above the percolation threshold, yet also needs to be partly miscible with the crystallizable acceptor.68 PC71BM has miscibility above the percolation threshold in PM6,69 and the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χ indicates that PC71BM is miscible with the host acceptor Y6, thus adding a small amount of PC71BM into the PM6/Y6 system can prevent the over-aggregation and crystallization of Y6,70 reduce the degradation of the devices, and improve the storage stability of pseudo-bilayer ternary OSCs.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary organic solar cells were prepared by layer-by-layer sequential deposition. For the complementary absorption and higher LUMO of PC71BM, the introduction of the third component PC71BM into the PM6/Y6 binary system improves the light absorption of the active layer and enhances the VOC of the OSCs. The PL characterization of Y6, PC71BM and Y6:PC71BM films indicates that there exists Förster Resonance Energy Transfer from PC71BM into Y6, which improves the exciton generation rate. PC71BM has good miscibility with both PM6 and Y6, the introduction of PC71BM facilitates the diffusion of Y6 into the PM6 layer and improves the donor/acceptor contact interface for exciton dissociation, and the distribution of PC71BM between PM6 and Y6 provides a cascade energy level alignment for efficient charge transport. Besides the improved light absorption, exciton generation and dissociation of the third component, the pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction supplies independent channels for electron and hole transport, and the charge transfer performance is improved and carrier recombination is restricted. With the combined advantage of pseudo-bilayer planar heterojunction and ternary strategy, the prepared PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary organic solar cells exhibit an improved JSC, VOC and FF, yielding a PCE of 17.82%, while the PCE of the PM6/Y6 binary device is 16.44%. Besides, the PM6/Y6:PC71BM pseudo-bilayer ternary device exhibits better stability. The comprehensive utilization of fullerene and non-fullerene acceptors, the combination of a quasi-planar heterojunction and ternary strategy synergistically improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells.
