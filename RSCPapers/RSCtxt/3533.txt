    , Accepted 16th August 2019First published on 16th August 2019AbstractTwo of the greatest global challenges faced by humankind in the 21st century are (1) the lack of access to a clean and potable water supply, and (2) the need for sustainable energy. As such, scientists from all subject areas have been actively developing methods to solve water shortages and the energy crisis. Herein, we present a photo-redox catalysis desalination generator, which possesses dual functions, acting as both an efficient salt remover and a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)-based photoelectricity energy converter. It consists of dye semiconductor materials, a recirculating redox flow electrolyte between the anode and cathode, and salt feed streams. It utilizes the redox reaction of the electrolyte driven by the photo-excited semiconductor and simultaneously, it captures the salt anions and cations via coupling in the presence of ion exchange membranes. The cell is proposed to possess an unlimited salt removal capacity due to the redox catalysis of the same electrolyte redox species, while energy can be released via photoelectric energy conversion. This method will bypass the limitations of energy consumption in desalination and effectively solve the two major issues outlined. The current research will revolutionize desalination methods and propel desalination to a new era.
Water scarcity and the energy crisis are the two global issues which affect the sustainable development of human society. In the past decades, scientists have made enormous efforts to supply both freshwater and energy from renewable sources. The ocean is an unlimited water resource, and desalination is a feasible route to obtaining usable freshwater, via methods including reverse osmosis,1–3 thermal distillation,4,5 capacitive deionization,6–9 electro-dialysis,10,11 and faradaic-based desalination etc.12–21 However, these desalination technologies require the consumption of large amounts of electrical or thermal energy, which is unsustainable. Solar energy is an inexhaustible resource. Photo-electrochemical desalination is a recently emerging technology and has attracted great interest for salt removal by exploiting sunlight as a driver without increasing operational cost.22 For example, in 2016, the most representative bio-photo-electrochemical desalination cell was designed by Liang et al. with a photo-active microorganism anode and K3[Fe(CN)6] catholyte.23 However, microbial activity is environmentally sensitive, meaning that the pH value should be neutral during the entire process, which requires extra buffer solution. The increase of chloride ion concentration at the anode may also affect the bacterial activity. Recently Kim et al. developed a three-in-one sunlight-driven electrochemical system for desalination, photodegradation of organics, and H2 evolution.24 After illumination of the TiO2 nanorod array photoanode, the active chlorine species converts from chloride, decomposing the organics to nitrogen, leading to hydrogen being evolved at the cathode. The exo-electrogenic system desalinates saline water in the middle cell and produces electricity. Unfortunately, the active chlorine may also oxidize the ion exchange membrane. The hydrogen evolution also changes the pH value at the cathode side. All of these reported works consist of separated streams of anolyte and catholyte, causing the frequent requirement for salt solution, electrolyte regeneration or replacement. These issues restrict the application of photo-electrochemical desalination, and therefore research is urgently needed into the continuous output of freshwater by exploiting sunlight as a driver. In this work, we propose a photo-redox desalination cell with a recirculating redox flow electrolyte between the anode and cathode, which can realize a continuous photo-excited desalination process while releasing energy. This whole process is driven by light energy. The device consists of semiconductor-based photoelectric conversion materials, a recirculated redox flow electrolyte between the anode and cathode, and salt feed streams. During the salt removal process, the salt anion and cation are extracted by the circular flowing electrode material. The same electrode material acts as a “catalyst” due to its redox reaction function while the salt ions in the middle feed are continuously extracted. The salt removal capacity should be unlimited while energy can be released from the photoelectrical energy conversion in the outer circuit. The solar desalination device is simple to assemble and cost effective; it has great potential to contribute significantly to renewable energy and water treatment technologies in the future. These results open up a new avenue for seawater desalination based on solar electrochemical desalination technology.
Experimental design and desalination mechanism

Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic diagram of the proposed photo-redox desalination cell system, and a photo of the system set-up is given in Fig. 1(b). The concave lens is kept at a fixed distance to amplify the point light source that illuminates the device. The detailed components of the cell are detailed in Fig. S1.† The anion exchange membrane (AEM) is inserted between the salt feed and the photo-anode reservoir, and the cation exchange membrane (CEM) is located between the salt feed and the cathode reservoir. The two electrolyte reservoirs are connected to each other and circulated using a peristaltic pump. The salt feed reservoir is circulated alone for the desalination test. Platinum nanoparticle-decorated carbon cloth together with graphite paper is used as the cathode current collector. The TiO2 paste is screen printed onto the conductive FTO substrates and then decorated with LEG4 dye. Fig. S2(a)† shows the absorption spectra of bare TiO2 and the dye-modified TiO2 photoanode. It clearly indicates a bathochromic shift due to the adsorption of dye molecules on the TiO2. The onset wavelength increases from 370 nm to 488 nm after inclusion of the LEG4 dye, inferring the LEG4 activity response. The experiment was conducted using a YSL Photonics SC-Pro laser source modulated over a continuous 430–640 nm wavelength range; the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. S2(b)† in comparison to the absorption spectra of LEG4–TiO2. The diameter of the laser spot is 2 mm. The light source is well matched to the LEG4–TiO2 absorption. Moreover, the output power can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the light source. The distance is an important factor for exposure on the photo-anode active area, and it is adjusted by varying the focal length of the concave lens. With the focal length of 6 cm, the area of laser output was 1.76 cm2 which is sufficient to cover the photoanode active area of the cell (1 cm2).

The photo-anode of the cell was fabricated using the dye LEG4 (Fig. 1(c)) as a sensitizer, and a TEMPO electrolyte with the addition of 4000 ppm NaCl was used to improve the conductivity. In previously reported work, the diffusion coefficient of TEMPO was calculated to be 1.94 × 10−5 cm2 s−1,20 which is sufficient for the redox species transportation. The redox potential of TEMPO/TEMPO+ is measured to be 0.62 V vs. the standard Ag/AgCl electrode, as demonstrated in Fig. S3† and 1(d). A pair of redox peaks can be observed. During the charge process, TEMPO is oxidized into the corresponding TEMPO+ in the three-electrode CV,20,25–28 as described in eqn (1): (1)
During the discharge, TEMPO+ is reduced to TEMPO as shown below: (2)
The redox reaction of TEMPO/TEMPO+ occurs via the transformation of N–O˙/N+O. The electron loss/gain in the electrolyte causes an electrostatic charge imbalance, which is compensated for by the involved Cl− ions.
With the insertion of the AEM and CEM as shown in Fig. 1(a), the electrostatic compensation at the cathode is different. TEMPO is oxidized at the photo-anode reservoir and provides electrons to the valence band of the dye. The anions in the middle salt feed transport through the AEM to compensate for the produced TEMPO+. At the cathode side, the recovery of TEMPO captures the Na+ ions in the middle salt feed to the cathode reservoir via the CEM, as described in eqn (4). Hence, the salt feed is continuously desalinated.
At the photo-anode reservoir, TEMPO is oxidized in a process driven by light illumination: (3)
TEMPO+ is reduced to TEMPO at the cathode reservoir: (4)
Thus the overall reaction for the TEMPO electrochemistry can be expressed as: hν + TEMPO + Cl− + Na+ → TEMPO + NaCl + electric energy output(5)
In brief, the TEMPO molecule undergoes a redox reaction after one round of cycling; hence, it acts as a catalyst for the deionization processes while energy is released, and the whole process is driven by the light energy. If other salts are used to replace NaCl, this electrostatic charge compensation still occurs. Therefore, the TEMPO redox couple could still work in other salts.
The photo-electricity conversion performance of the cell was determined by current–voltage (J–V) curves with different laser intensities as shown in Fig. 1(e). The short-circuit current increases gradually when the laser output power is varied from 50 mW to 150 mW, indicating the photoelectric effect. As displayed in Table S1,† the conversion efficiencies are 0.07%, 0.09%, and 0.15% for 50 mW, 100 mW and 150 mW illumination, respectively. The short-circuit photocurrent density is 0.31 mA cm−2 at 150 mW illumination, which can be attributed to a significant recombination due to the TEMPO redox between the photo-anode and cathode. The open circuit voltage is up to 0.773 V under the 150 mW light source illumination. A stronger laser output delivers a higher current density; thus 150 mW is preferred for the tests.
To further understand the principle of photo-redox desalination and electric energy output, comparison experiments were performed without LEG4 or TEMPO/TEMPO+, and the results are shown in Fig. S4.† The bare TiO2 shows a weak response in dark conditions, and an obvious current enhancement is not obtained upon illumination in Fig. S4(a),† indicating the importance of the photo-sensitive material to the system. The discharge current is low (micro amperes) in Fig. S4(b).† These observed results are consistent with Fig. S2.† To investigate the influence of the redox electrolyte, the device test was performed without TEMPO. Salt addition is required to ensure sufficient conductivity. As shown in Fig. S4(c and d),† the current is very low in both dark and light conditions, at approximately 10% of that obtained with TEMPO. Thus, both the LEG4 dye-modified TiO2 and the TEMPO redox electrolyte play key roles in the current system.
The performance of the photo-redox desalination cell
The schematic design of the photo-redox desalination cell is displayed in Fig. S5(a),† and the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. S5(b).† The discharge current densities of 0.05 mA cm−2, 0.10 mA cm−2 and 0.15 mA cm−2 are controlled using a battery tester and the plateaus show a reasonable trend when the discharge current density varies, as shown in Fig. S6.† This shows that the cell performance is based on the photocurrent generation. Hence, 0.1 mA cm−2 was chosen as the photo-discharge current density, as shown in Fig. 2. In the dark, OCVs (open circuit voltage) are around ∼0.40 V. With illumination, the OCVs increase to 0.63 V immediately, and gradually reach saturation. A constant discharge current density (0.1 mA cm−2) was then applied by the battery tester. It can be observed that the voltage decreases to 0.3 V and then gradually keeps decreasing as shown in Fig. 2(b). The conductivities of the initial and final states were recorded using a Myron L Ultrameter II 4 P, and the results are shown in Table S2.† The initial conductivity is 7350 μS cm−1 for the salt stream, and this remains stable before discharge. After 80 minutes of discharge it decreases to 7308 μS cm−1. The charge efficiency is up to 0.97. This clearly indicates that the desalination process occurs during the photo-electrochemical reaction. Hence, the current device demonstrates the dual functions of desalination and energy output with photo illumination.
 Fig. 2  (a) Schematic representation of the photo-redox desalination device, (b) photo-discharge profiles at 0.1 mA cm−2 constant current density, (c) photo current density at zero bias, (d) conductivity variation at zero bias (short circuit). 
The photo-electrochemical response is only observed after illumination. In order to obtain a stable salt removal performance, the cell was tested at zero bias (short circuit). The photo current density and conductivity variation are shown in Fig. 2(c and d). With 150 mW illumination, the short-circuit current density jumps to 0.15 mA cm−2, and then gradually decreases to ∼0.1 mA cm−2 after 4 hours as shown in Fig. 2(c). The gradual decrease in current density indicates that the redox electrochemical reaction takes place inside the system. The salt concentration was also recorded every hour, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The initial conductivity is 7484 μS cm−1 for the salt stream and after 4 h it decreases to 7367 μS cm−1. The charge efficiency is 0.92 for the whole process. This clearly indicates that the desalination process occurs during the photo-electrochemical reaction. As long as the light is illuminating the device, the salt is continuously removed. Thus, the desalination is a continuous process.
Compared with the reported aqueous LEG4/TEMPO dye-sensitized solar devices,29,30 the photocurrent in this work is inadequate. This may be due to the architecture variation of the device and the redox electrolyte. Moreover, the salt stream is flowing in the middle compartment. These factors may lead to the minimization of photocurrent generation in the current device. To demonstrate the solar cell behavior of the device without the middle salt stream, current–voltage curves were created using only TEMPO/NaCl electrolyte (Fig. S7 and Table S3†). With increasing distance between the photo-anode and cathode, the efficiency decreases due to the recombination at the photo-anodes, which is consistent with the reported literature on the influence of electrode spacing.31,32 In order to clearly demonstrate the mechanism, the photoanode in light energy-driven desalination was replaced by the graphite paper/carbon foam.33 The salt can be reduced to drinking water levels at 4 mA (active area: 9 cm2). At the lower current of 0.5 mA, a 3000 ppm feed salt decreases to drinking water level after ∼2900 minutes, as shown in Fig. S8.† The design of the ion exchange membrane should only allow the transportation of the corresponding ions. However, this is actually not the case because the transport number <1. To prove the transportation of TEMPO/TEMPO+ through the exchange membranes and its influence on desalination, we obtained the absorption spectra of both TEMPO and the salt streams at the initial and final stages in the electrochemical desalination process, and the result is shown in Fig. S9.† No appreciable change can be observed in the TEMPO stream apart from a small decrease in peak intensity. A calibration curve of absorbance vs. concentration at 428 nm was obtained using the different concentrations of 0.5, 1, 25, 100 and 150 mM of TEMPO in salt. The TEMPO concentration is linearly correlated with the intensity of the absorption spectra (Y = 0.0123 × X − 0.006), with a correlation coefficient of 0.998 for the peak at 428 nm, as displayed in Fig. S10.† The molar extinction coefficient was calculated using the Beer–Lambert law for TEMPO/NaCl and is 12.3 M−1 cm−1. The limit of detection (LOD) can be expressed by the equation: LOD = 3.3× SD/slope (SD: standard deviation of the response based on blank measurements; slope: the slope of the calibration curve). Therefore, the LOD for TEMPO/NaCl was found to be 0.133 mM. The absorbance intensity in Fig. S9† is 0.002 in the desalted chamber after the completion of desalination, and the calculated TEMPO concentration is of the same order as the LOD, indicating the possible existence of a minor leak. However, this has negligible influence on the salt concentration measurement in salt streams, as shown in Fig. S8.† In the future, the system could be further improved by a change in the device design to an O-ring structure or further tightening of the metal screws. However, it is necessary to enhance the photocurrent to mA level by using a different architecture, and to obtain a quick desalination performance in a future investigation.
A possible mechanism for the desalination generator is shown in Table S4.† The LEG4 dye absorbs light energy and generates an electron–hole pair. The electron is transported to the outer circuit via the TiO2 layer. The oxidized dye molecule is regenerated by the TEMPO electrolyte through donation of an electron to form the TEMPO+ species at the anode reservoir, causing the coupling of Cl− extraction from the middle salt feed in the presence of an AEM. This flowing TEMPO+ species is reduced as an electron acceptor from the outer circuit at the cathode side and converted to TEMPO, causing Na+ extraction via the CEM from the middle salt feed. The TEMPO therefore acts as a catalyst. The salt is removed while the electrical power is generated in the outer circuit.
The performance of the photo-redox desalination cell with a regeneration stream
With the design in Fig. 2, the salt stream will become more and more condensed due to the salt inflow. In order to run the device long term, the TEMPO electrolyte must be kept unchanged. Thus, a new cell architecture was designed, as shown in Fig. 3(a), and then tested (Fig. S11†). The total system consists of two AEMs placed at the anode and cathode, and one CEM placed between the two salt streams. All the components are displayed in Fig. S12.† Stream 2 is the condenser reservoir used to regenerate the TEMPO electrolyte, and stream 1 is the desalted reservoir. The voltage profile is displayed in Fig. 3(b) when a constant 0.1 mA cm−2 discharge current density is applied. The discharge plateau is lower than that in Fig. 2(b), due to the additional stream. The conductivity measurement is shown in Table S5.† The conductivity in stream 1 decreases to 7242 μS cm−1 after 80 minutes discharge, from the initial 7282 μS cm−1, and the conductivity in stream 2 rises to 7321 μS cm−1. The charge efficiency is 0.92 for stream 1 and 0.94 for stream 2.

A possible mechanism for this desalination generator is shown in the Table S6.† Driven by photo energy, the Na+ ions in stream 1 transport to stream 2 through the CEM, similar to the process described in Fig. 2. The Cl− ions in stream 1 are captured to the anode reservoir due to the oxidation of TEMPO. In the cathode chamber, the Cl− ion in TEMPO+Cl− is released to stream 2 due to the reduction of TEMPO+ to TEMPO. As a result, the salt concentration decreases in stream 1 and increases in stream 2, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The changes in photoelectron current density and conductivity at zero bias are shown in Fig. 3(c and d). The photoelectron current density is lower compared to that in Fig. 2(d), which may be due to the design architecture. The conductivity decreases from 7282 μS cm−1 to 7225 μS cm−1 in stream 1, clearly indicating salt removal. The salt conductivity in stream 2 is enhanced from 7285 μS cm−1 to 7347 μS cm−1. The total charge efficiency is 0.85 for stream 1 and 0.92 for stream 2.
Conclusion
In this work, we present a photo-redox desalination technology driven by light energy, with the dual functions of salt removal and photo-electricity conversion. LEG4/TiO2 on conductive FTO was used as a promising photo-anode and is favorable for the efficient absorption of energy in the 430–640 nm wavelength region. TEMPO/TEMPO+ was chosen as the metal-free organic redox species. Pt nanoparticles on carbon cloth were chosen as the cathode. During the salt removal process driven by photon illumination, the salt anion and cation were extracted by the recirculated TEMPO electrolyte. Due to the redox reaction, the TEMPO acted as a catalyst while the salt ions in the middle feed were continuously extracted. The salt removal capacity should be unlimited while the energy can be released in the outer circuit via the process of photoelectrical energy conversion. The solar desalination device is an energy-free or even energy-generating process, which has a high potential to contribute significantly to renewable energy generation and water treatment in the future. The present technology opens up a novel field involving a sunlight-water-energy nexus; it is a promising energy output desalination system driven by light.
Experimental
Materials
FTO, TEMPO, NaCl, PEG, PEO, TiO2 (Degussa P25), titanium(IV) isopropoxide, and Triton-X 100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without further chemical treatment. LEG4 was purchased from Dyenamo AB. Standard grade ion exchange membranes were ordered from ASTOM Corporation, Japan. The home-made cells were fabricated using acrylic sheets.
Fabrication of photo-anode
Initially, FTO glasses (<10 ohms sq−1) were sliced into 4 × 5 cm2 pieces, and surface cleaned successively with detergent, DI water, acetone and IPA. The cleaned FTO substrates were dried and subjected to blocking-layer deposition by spin coating with a mixture of 750 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide in 10 mL ethanol. The blocking layer was annealed at 450 °C for 30 minutes. A TiO2 colloidal paste was prepared as follows: 0.6 g of TiO2 was added pinch by pinch to 0.1 g of PEG and 10 wt% of PEO in water, this was followed by 2 drops of Triton-X 100 and 0.5 mL of acetyl acetone, and then the mixture was ground for an hour. The prepared paste was subjected to sonication and stirring for 12 hours to obtain a homogeneous solution. The obtained TiO2 paste was applied on the buffer layer by the doctor-blade technique and allowed to anneal using the following steps: 150 °C for 15 minutes, 350 °C for 10 minutes, 450 °C for 15 minutes and 500 °C for 30 minutes. After sintering, the electrode was treated in 40 mM TiCl4 at the temperature of 70 °C for half an hour, and then heated at 500 °C for 1 hour. The final compact TiO2 photo-anode was immersed in acetonitrile solution containing 0.2 mM of LEG4 dye for 24 hours under dark conditions. The dye-modified TiO2 layer was washed with ethanol several times to remove any unadsorbed dye molecules.
Fabrication of cathode
Pt nanoparticles on carbon cloth were prepared by drop casting chloroplatinic acid and sintering at 420 °C for 15 minutes. The Pt decorated carbon cloth was placed on graphite paper as a cathode current collector.
Fabrication of photo-redox catalysis desalination cell (PRCDC)
The PRCDC comprises four components, as follows: photo-anode, redox electrolyte (RE), salt stream (SS) and cathode. We fabricated two types of PRCDC with single and double salt streams. The configurations of both types of PRCDC are shown below:Single salt stream: photo-anode | RE ‖ SS ‖ RE | cathodeDouble salt streams: photo-anode | RE ‖ SS ‖ SS ‖ RE | cathode
The symbol | detonates the separation of components, and ‖ represents the membranes viz., anion exchange membrane (AEM) and cation exchange membrane (CEM). The AEM and CEM are placed at the photo-anode and cathode respectively for the single stream cell. In the case of the double stream cell, the CEM is between the two salt streams and AEMs are placed at both the anode and the cathode. The RE contains a mixture of 80 mM of TEMPO and 4000 ppm of NaCl in an aqueous medium. The salt stream contains the same concentration of NaCl as that in the redox medium. The salt volume is 12 mL, the flow rate is 11.6 mL min−1, the active membrane area is 9.6 cm2, and the thickness of the plate is 1 cm. In order to generate the TEMPO+ species at the initial stage, the cell is charged for 1.5 hours using the battery tester, and this is then followed by the photo-electrochemical operation.
Measurement
The IV curve for the PRCDC was obtained using a CHI760E Potentiostat instrument. The discharge of the PRCDC in the constant current mode was performed using a NEWARE Battery Testing System. The discharge of the PRCDC at zero bias was measured using a CHI760E Potentiostat with the I–t technique. The flow of the salt and redox TEMPO stream was controlled by a LEAD FLUID BT300S flow meter and fixed at 10 rpm throughout the experiment. The conductivity of the salt stream was measured using an ULTRAMETER II with micro Siemens sensitivity at ambient temperature. The light source was provided by a YSL Photonics SC-Pro laser with a tunable wavelength range and tunable power output. The spectra of the supercontinuum light source (YSL Pro-7 with Variable Linear Filter System, YSL Co., Ltd.) were measured using a spectrometer (Maya2000 Pro, Ocean Optics).

Calculation of PRCDC efficiency. 
The PRCDC efficiency was calculated using the equation:  where Voc is the open circuit voltage, Isc represents the short-circuit current, FF is the Fill factor, and Pinput is the input power.


Calculation of charge efficiency Λ. 
The charge efficiency is the ratio of the ionic removal charge from the water to the electrical charge, calculated by: Λ = (Cf − C0) × V/(58.44 × Q × 1.04 × 10−5), where Cf and C0 are the final and initial salt concentrations, V is the volume of NaCl solution and Q is the amount of charge (Coulomb, Q = It).
