    , Accepted 21st April 2021First published on 21st April 2021AbstractA series of multi acceptor based push–pull derivatives BTD2–BTD5 were designed and synthesized via Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction followed by [2+2] cycloaddition–electrocyclic ring-opening reaction in which the benzothiadiazole (BTD, A1), naphthalimide (NPI, A2), tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD, A3) or cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD (expanded TCBD, A4) moiety serves as the electron-withdrawing unit and triphenylamine (TPA) and ferrocene (Fc) are used as electron donating units. The incorporation of cyano based strong acceptors TCBD and expanded TCBD in the naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1 and BTD4 results in improved light harvesting properties. The photophysical properties of the benzothiadiazoles BTD1–BTD5 revealed that the chromophore BTD3 exhibits broad electronic absorption spectra in the near IR regions compared to BTD1, BTD2, BTD4 and BTD5 due to the presence of the expanded TCBD unit. The electrochemical properties revealed that the benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1–BTD5 exhibit multiple number of redox waves in cyclic voltammetry due to the presence of several acceptor units (BTD (A1), NPI (A2), TCBD (A3), expanded TCBD (A4)) and donor units (TPA (D1) and Fc (D2) units). The theoretical calculation demonstrates that the electron density of the HOMO energy level is mainly localized on the TPA and Fc units whereas LUMO is delocalized over the acceptor (BTD-NPI, TCBD-BTD and expanded TCBD-BTD) segments.
Introduction
π-Conjugated push–pull chromophores have received substantial attention of the scientific community due to their potential applications in the field of optoelectronics.1–5 The heteroatom-based derivatives of benzothiazole, benzothiadiazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, isoindigo, BODIPY, and naphthalimide are explored in the π-conjugated systems to tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels.6–11 The photonic and electronic properties of the organic π-conjugated derivatives can be perturbed by altering the strength of donor or acceptor groups in the π-conjugated backbone and π-linkers.12–16 Our group is interested in developing heteroatom based push–pull chromophores by modulating the strength of donor and acceptor moieties for optoelectronic applications.
The push–pull functionalized 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives have been studied in fluorescence imaging, nonlinear optics, light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and n-type materials due to their high reduction potential and strong electron affinity (EA).17–22 Lee and co-workers have developed rhodanine functionalized 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) based non-fullerene acceptors for organic solar cells which showed power conversion efficiency up to 8.19%.23 Yang et al. explored diketopyrrolopyrrole and isoindigo based 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) chromophores for high performance ambipolar semiconducting materials.24 Our group has synthesized multi acceptor based benzothiadiazole chromophores for optoelectronic and ultra-fast studies.25–27
On the other hand, the 1,8-naphthalimide (NPI) derivatives are used in optoelectronic materials, pH sensors, laser dyes, metal sensors and bioimaging due to their high chemical and thermal stability, strong fluorescence quantum yield and good photostability.28–30 1,8-Naphthalimide (NPI) substituted n-type materials show excellent performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Liu and co-workers have developed iminodiacetic acid and picolinic acid based 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide-based chromophores for detection of Hg2+ in aqueous solution and living cells.31 Anna and co-workers have designed and synthesized imidazolium functionalized naphthalimide derivatives for bioimaging and anticancer activity.32 Our group has developed BODIPY functionalized naphthalimide derivatives for bioimaging applications.30
Tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) are widely used in organic field effect transistors and organic solar cells due to their excellent photophysical and electrochemical properties.33–38 The TCNE and TCNQ units undergo [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction with the electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA), ferrocene (Fc) and N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) based alkyne moiety to form donor–acceptor (TCBD and expanded TCBD) based derivatives, which show broad absorption in the NIR region.33,34,36
In the present study, we have developed a series of multi acceptor based push–pull chromophores BTD1–BTD5 in which benzothiadiazole (A1) was used as the central unit core, naphthalimide (A2) as the end-capping electron deficient unit, the tetracyanobutadiene (A3) or expanded TCBD (A4) moiety as the additional electron-withdrawing unit and triphenylamine and ferrocenyl units as the end-capping electron rich unit. Herein we explore the effect of variation of electron rich and electron deficient units on the photophysical, electrochemical and computational studies.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole chromophores BTD2–5 is shown in Schemes 1 and 2. The triphenylamine substituted benzothiadiazole derivative BTD1 with the structural configuration D1–π–A1–π–A2 was synthesized by the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction.39

The Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction of I40 with 1.3 equiv of acetylene functionalized naphthalimide unit II resulted in unsymmetrical benzothiadiazole derivative BTD4 in 59% yield (Scheme 2). The TCBD and expanded TCBD linked naphthalimide substituted benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2, 3 and 5 were synthesized via [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction. The reaction of TPA and Fc functionalized benzothiadiazole BTD1 and BTD4 with TCNE (1 equivalent) in DCM resulted in BTD2 and 5 in 80% and 88% yield, respectively. The expanded TCBD substituted chromophore BTD3 with the structural configuration D1–A4–A1–π–A2 was synthesized by the reaction of 1.2 equivalent of TCNQ with the benzothiadiazole derivative BTD1 in microwave in dichloroethane (DCE) at 80 °C in 85% yield, whereas the ferrocenyl functionalized benzothiadiazole BTD4 did not undergo the [2+2] cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization reaction in the presence of an excess amount of TCNQ. The benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2–5 were characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, and HRMS techniques.
UV-vis spectroscopy
The optical properties of the naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1–5 were investigated in dilute dichloromethane (DCM) solutions (1 × 10−5 M) and are depicted in Fig. 1. The relevant data including absorption maximum (λabs), extinction coefficient and optical band gap are summarized in Table 1. The triphenylamine and ferrocenyl substituted benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1 and BTD4 exhibit two absorption bands at 408 nm and 407 nm due to the π–π* transition and the absorption bands at 494 nm and 517 nm correspond to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition.

The TCBD functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2 and BTD5 exhibit intense absorption bands around 455 and 416 nm corresponding to the strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. In the case of BTD5, a shoulder peak was also observed around 582 nm with low intensity, which may be due to the additional ICT transition. The absorption spectra of benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2 and BTD5 show a blue shift compared to that of BTD1 and BTD4, due to their non-planar structure which was confirmed by theoretical calculations. The expanded TCBD functionalized derivative BTD3 shows a π–π* transition at 418 nm and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition at 690 nm. The expanded TCBD derivative BTD3 exhibits a considerable bathochromic shift compared to precursor BTD1 and TCBD functionalized derivative BTD2 due to its strong donor–acceptor interaction. The optical band gaps for naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1–5 are 2.0 eV, 1.7 eV, 1.4 eV, 1.8 eV and 1.5 eV, respectively. The fluorescence spectra of BTD1–5 were recorded in dichloromethane solutions in which the triphenylamine functionalized benzothiadiazole derivative BTD1 shows emission spectra at 712 nm whereas BTD2–5 are non-emissive in DCM between 500 nm and 850 nm as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†).
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the electrochemical properties and frontier molecular orbitals of the naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1–5. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 2 and the electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. The naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1–5 exhibit multi-step redox waves due to the reduction of naphthalimide, BTD, TCBD and expanded TCBD acceptor units in the cathodic side and the oxidation of the triphenylamine and ferrocenyl donor unit in the anodic side.

The triphenylamine and ferrocenyl functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD1 and BTD4 exhibit two reversible reduction peaks at −1.16 V, −1.28 V and −1.10 V, −1.22 V which correspond to the benzothiadiazole and naphthalimide unit whereas in the anodic side an oxidation peak was observed in the region of 0.5 V to 1.0 V corresponding to the triphenylamine and ferrocenyl unit. After incorporation of the TCBD unit, the benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2 and BTD5 show two additional reversible reduction peaks in the region of −0.3 V to −0.84 V, which are attributed to the TCBD unit, and the other two reversible reduction waves in the region −0.95 V to −1.4 V correspond to the benzothiadiazole and naphthalimide unit. In the anodic side both TCBD functionalized derivatives BTD2 and BTD5 exhibit single oxidation waves corresponding to the triphenylamine and ferrocenyl unit.
The expanded TCBD functionalized benzothiadiazole derivative BTD3 shows four reversible reduction waves in the cathodic side in which the first two reversible reduction waves in the region of −0.2 V to −0.5 V are attributed to the expanded TCBD unit and the next two reversible reduction waves at −1.17 V and −1.33 V correspond to the benzothiadiazole and naphthalimide unit. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole BTD1–5 are −5.29 eV, −5.39 eV, −5.14 eV, −4.87 eV, −5.18 eV and −3.48, −3.68 eV, −3.72 eV, −3.36 eV, −3.99 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole BTD1–5 are in good agreement with the optical band gap.
Computational study
To investigate the molecular geometry and electronic properties of multi modular benzothiadiazole chromophores BTD1–5, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the B3LYP functional with 6-31G** as the basis set.41 The benzothiadiazole substituted push–pull chromophores BTD1 and 4 exhibit a non-planar structure due to the presence of the triphenylamine (propeller shape) and ferrocenyl unit. BTD2, 3 and 5 show a more twisted structure due to the presence of additional nonplanar acceptor units TCBD (A3) and expanded TCBD (A4). The energy level diagram of naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazoles BTD2, 3 and 5 is outlined in Fig. 3. The optimized structures and frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals of BTD1–5 are shown in Fig. 4. The frontier molecular orbitals of BTD1 and BTD4 reveal that the HOMO is predominantly concentrated on the TPA and Fc unit, whereas the LUMO is mainly localized on the BTD-NPI units which show excellent electronic communication in the chromophore BTD1 and BTD4. In the case of TCBD and expanded TCBD functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2, 3 and 5, the electron density of HOMO orbitals is mainly concentrated over the TPA and Fc unit whereas the LUMO is delocalized over the TCBD-BTD and expanded TCBD-BTD segments. The theoretically estimated HOMO energy levels of benzothiadiazole BTD1–5 are −5.37 eV, −7.25 eV, −7.05 eV, −5.51 eV, −6.15 eV and the LUMO energy levels are −3.16 eV, −2.81 eV, −2.88 eV, −2.97 eV and −3.87 eV, respectively.

The theoretical calculations demonstrate that BTD1 and BTD5 exhibit two major electronic absorption bands in the uv-vis region in which the absorption spectra in the lower wavelength region correspond to the π–π* transition and the spectra in the longer wavelength region correspond to the ICT transition. The naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivative BTD2 shows a strong absorption band originating from HOMO−1 → LUMO at 421 nm attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition. The orientation of the absorption spectra and the position of λmax of benzothiadiazole chromophore BTD2 are in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in Fig. 5. The expanded TCBD functionalized benzothiadiazole derivative BTD3 shows two major excited states, in which the first excited state predicted at 656 nm belongs to the HOMO−1 → LUMO+1 transition, which has intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character. The other excited state with high intensity at 414 nm dominated by the HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 transition has π–π* character, which is also in good agreement with the experimental data. Overall, the TD-DFT calculations showed that the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band of BTD3 exhibits a strong bathochromic shift of ∼235 nm compared to the TCBD functionalized BTD2 chromophore due to the presence of the expanded TCBD unit which tunes the HOMO–LUMO band gap.
Conclusions
We have synthesized the multi-modular push–pull based unsymmetrical benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2, 3, 4 and 5 in which TPA and Fc are used as electron rich units and BTD, NPI, TCBD and expanded TCBD are used as electron deficient units to enhance the π-conjugation and to tune their optical band gap. The incorporation of cyano based TCBD and expanded TCBD acceptor units in the naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2, 3 and 5 leads to excellent optical properties compared to precursors BTD1 and BTD4. The benzothiadiazole chromophore BTD3 exhibits broad electronic absorption spectra (ICT) in the near IR region compared to TCBD derivatives BTD2 and 5 and precursors BTD1 and BTD4 due to the presence of a powerful electron deficient expanded TCBD unit. These naphthalimide functionalized benzothiadiazole derivatives BTD2, 3 and 4 display interesting electrochemical properties (low electrochemical band gap) and hence they can be useful as n-type semiconducting materials for bulk heterojunction solar cells. The theoretical calculation revealed that, the HOMO energy level of chromophores BTD2–5 was localized on the triphenylamine and ferrocenyl entity whereas the LUMO was delocalized over the BTD-NPI, BTD-TCBD and BTD-expanded TCBD segments.
