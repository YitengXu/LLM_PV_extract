    , Accepted 5th May 2017First published on 8th May 2017AbstractCharge compensated alkali metal ions (Na+, K+) codoped CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ nano-flakes were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The effect of doping concentration of Na+ and K+ ions on upconversion luminescence in CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ was investigated with respect to its dependence on input pump power and external temperature using 980 nm laser light excitation. Simultaneous incorporation of K+/Na+ into CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ showed 36 and 5 times enhancements in green and red emission intensities, which were explained in terms of charge compensation and lifetime variation in the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels of Er3+ ions. A high thermal sensitivity of the material was realized with K+/Na+ incorporation using the fluorescence intensity ratio technique of two thermally coupled energy levels (2H11/2 & 4S3/2) of Er3+. The temperature sensitivity was enhanced by four times by K+/Na+ codoping with a maximum sensitivity of 0.0216 K−1 at 490 K. Additionally, the cathodoluminescence properties of the material as a function of filament current and accelerating voltage were also explored and showed enhanced luminescence, which is suitable for field emission display device applications. The results show that simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ in CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ is a very effective way to integrate this material for advanced photonic applications.
1. Introduction
A tremendous progress in the search for highly efficient upconversion (UC) materials that can efficiently convert near infrared (NIR) radiation into visible light has been seen in the last decade. As nanotechnology has facilitated the synthesis of nanoscale particles with uniform shape and size, a burst of activity in this research field occurred due to the assumed potential use of UC nanoparticles in bioimaging, targeted cancer therapy, optical temperature sensing, solar light conversion, etc.1–5 The efficiency of rare earth (RE) ion doped UC phosphors strongly depends on the choice of the host material. Therefore, the selection of a suitable host is very important. Earth metals and rare earth based molybdates having the general chemical formula MMoO4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) and R2(MoO4)3 (R = Y, La, Gd) have been regarded as good materials for achieving UC emission because of their potential applications in various fields, such as electro-optic devices, acoustic–optic modulators, solid state scintillators, fluorescent lamps and catalysis.6–9 Molybdates have broad and intense absorption bands in the near-UV region due to the charge transfer (CT) transitions from oxygen to metal ions.6,10 Among the molybdate compounds, CaMoO4 has been considered as an excellent luminescent material for achieving efficient UC emission because of its stable physical and chemical properties and considerably low phonon energy (∼800 cm−1).7,11 Moreover, the Mo6+ ion in the CaMoO4 matrix shows strong polarization (due to large electric charge and small radius) that lowers symmetries and enhances Stark energy splitting.11 A hydrothermal method was followed to prepare the samples due to its advantage in obtaining a controlled morphology with various shapes of CaMoO4 micro/nanostructures such as nanoflakes, nanosheets, microflowers, spheres, doughnut shaped microstructures, etc.8,12
Several efforts have been made to enhance the UC emission efficiency of phosphor materials such as co-doping with sensitizer ions, choosing suitable non-rare earth ions, core–shell structure formation, plasmonic enhancement, etc.13–15 Alkali metal ions like Li+, Na+ and K+, which have low oxidation states and small ionic radii, are found to be effective for improving the UC emission efficiency by modifying the rare earth local symmetry of the host lattice16,17 and hence are a topic of recent research interest. In addition, many researchers have reported UC efficiency enhancement by co-doping of ions such as Al3+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Bi3+ by distorting the crystal field symmetry.18–21 Chong et al.18 have studied the effect of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions on the Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphor and found enhancement in the red emission intensity. Enhancement in the green emission of the Er3+ ion centred at 560 nm by a factor of 28 has been observed by Liang et al.19via codoping of Li+–Zn2+ ions in Y2O3:Er3+. This enhancement was ascribed to the tailoring of the local crystal field around Er3+ ions. Previously20 our group has also reported the enhancement of upconversion emission in a BaTiO3:Er3+/Yb3+ nanophosphor by the codoping of Zn2+ ions. But enhancement in the UC emission intensity due to simultaneous codoping of light alkali metal ions like K+/Na+ has not been reported until now. This led to the authors investigating the effects of K+/Na+ in the UC emission and cathodoluminescence of the CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor.
Most importantly, exploring an UC phosphor for high temperature thermometry with better accuracy is still a challenge for researchers because of the thermal quenching of emission in the high temperature region.22–25 Generally, two methods are employed for temperature measurements – the emission decay method and the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) method. The FIR method based on the fluorescence intensities of two thermally coupled energy levels of RE3+ ion has been widely studied for temperature measurements due to its superiority over emission decay method and fluctuations in the excitation light source.22 The Er3+ is the most studied RE3+ ion due to its two suitable thermally coupled energy levels, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2, with a small energy gap of about ∼770 cm−1.7 As the codoping of K+/Na+ can tailor the local crystal field around the RE ions, a change in the temperature sensing behaviour is also expected and hence it is investigated in this work along with the upconversion properties.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials synthesis
Charge compensated CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ was prepared by the hydrothermal method using ethylene glycol (EG) as a chelating agent. The compositions of the samples were chosen as follows:(96.7 − p − q) CaMoO4 + 0.3 mol% Er2O3 + 3 mol% Yb2O3 + pNa2CO3 + qK2CO3
For CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+: p = 0 mol%, q = 0 mol% (CM).
For CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+/Na+: p = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%, q = 0 mol% (CMNa).
For CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+/K+: p = 0 mol%, q = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol% (CMK).
For CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+/K+/Na+: p = 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 mol%, q = 10 mol% (CMKNa).
According to the stoichiometric ratio of the compositions, CaCO3 (99.99%, Merck, India), Er2O3 (99.99%, Otto, India), Yb2O3 (99.99%, Otto, India), Na2CO3 (99.99%, Merck, India), K2CO3 (99.99%, Merck, India) and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (99%, Merck, India) were taken as the starting precursors. In a typical synthesis process, the nitrates of the chemicals were prepared by dissolving oxides and carbonates in concentrated nitric acid (HNO3). All the prepared nitrates were mixed together and the extra amount of nitric acid was removed by evaporation with addition of water under continuous stirring on a magnetic stirrer whose hot plate was kept at 80 °C. After that ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate (NH46Mo7O24·4H2O) solution was mixed into the above solution. Then 25 ml of ethylene glycol (EG) was added into the final solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted in the range 8–9 using NaOH under constant stirring conditions. After stirring for half an hour, the resultant milky colloidal solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 80 ml capacity and heated at 200 °C for 24 h for hydrothermal treatment. After being cooled down to room temperature naturally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with de-ionized water and ethanol several times followed by drying in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h. A part of the as-prepared samples was annealed at 800 °C for 4 h.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were taken on a Bruker-D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer using a CuKα (1.5406 Å) radiation source over the angular range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80°. Infrared absorption spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Perkin Elmer spectrum RXI) using the KBr pellet technique in the wavelength range of 4000–400 cm−1. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were taken using a ZEISS SUPPRA55. The electronic absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer, Lambda 950, UV-Visible-NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–1200 nm. The UC emission spectra were recorded on a SP2300 grating spectrograph (Princeton Instruments, USA) using a 980 nm continuous wave (CW) diode laser as the excitation source. The laser power was measured through a power meter (Model S310C, Thorlabs, USA). Decay curve measurements were carried out on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS-980 fluorescence spectrometer using a 980 nm laser excitation. For the temperature dependent UC emission study, a thermocouple was placed close to the laser spot on the sample surface and the spectra were recorded on a CCD spectrometer (Model: ULS2048X64, Avantes, USA). The laser beam power was set at 7 W cm−2 and a chopper was used to chop the CW light to avoid direct heating of the material. The cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements were performed at 300 K (room temperature) on a SPEX 1000 M spectrometer at different accelerating voltages and emission currents under 10−5 mbar pressure.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis

3.1.1 X-ray diffraction analysis. 
X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out to identify the phase composition and crystal structure of the synthesized samples. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples CM, CMNa, CMK and CMKNa annealed at 800 °C. The diffraction peaks of all the samples are in good agreement with the standard data of JCPDS (file no. 77-2244) confirming the formation of the pure tetragonal phase of CaMoO4 with the space group I41/a. No other impurity phases were found. The Rietveld refinement results on the tetragonal phase of CaMoO4 can be found in other works.6,26 The XRD patterns show a small shift of the diffraction peaks towards a lower 2θ value with improved crystallinity for samples incorporated with Na+, K+ and K+/Na+. The shifting in the diffraction peak is related to the expansion in lattice which may be due to the fact that Ca2+ ions (0.99 Å) are substituted by Na+ (1.02 Å) and K+ (1.38 Å) ions with larger ionic radii.27 The lattice parameter and unit cell volume were calculated for CM (a = b = 5.06 Å, c = 11.21 Å; unit cell volume: 287.01 Å3) and CMKNa (a = b = 5.15 Å, c = 11.16 Å; unit cell volume: 294.86 Å3).6 It was found that the lattice parameters and unit cell volume decreased with the doping of Er3+ and Yb3+ as compared to the standard JCPDS data but slightly increased upon codoping with K+/Na+. The ionic radii of Er3+, Yb3+, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ are ∼0.89 Å, ∼0.86 Å, ∼1.08 Å, ∼1.38 Å and ∼0.99 Å, respectively, and one can conclude that if the Ca2+ sites are replaced by smaller ionic radii of Er3+/Yb3+, it leads to the shrinkage of the unit cell parameters and volume whereas when Ca2+ are substituted by larger ionic radii K+/Na+ the result is expansion in the unit cell parameters and volume.

3.1.2 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. 
FTIR spectra were recorded to obtain the presence of organic impurities in the samples. Fig. 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the as-synthesized CM sample as well as the samples annealed at 800 °C. In the case of the as-synthesized sample, a strong absorption band around 820 cm−1 is observed due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of O–Mo–O vibration in the [MoO4]2− tetrahedron.28,29 A strong absorption band around 3400 cm−1 is observed corresponding to the O–H stretching vibration of water molecules present in the samples. The band observed around 2431 cm−1 is associated with the asymmetric stretching mode of the CO2 group adsorbed from the atmosphere, while the band around 1390 cm−1 arises due to the N–O mode of vibration of HNO3 used in the sample preparation. The O–H band is seen to be reduced upon the addition of Na+ and K+. Further impurity bands are completely removed in the sample CMKNa annealed at 800 °C. It is believed that K+/Na+ ions neutralize the OH− ions by coulomb interaction. The simultaneous addition of K+/Na+ seems to be favourable for diminishing non-radiative relaxation rates and therefore may increase the luminescence efficiency. The lattice absorption band at 820 cm−1 can be considered as the phonon energy of the host and it is low enough to get sufficient upconversion emission.

3.1.3 Microstructure analysis. 
The results of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), used to investigate the particle size and morphology, are shown in Fig. 3(a–d) for the annealed samples. It can be seen from Fig. 3(a) that the sample exhibits non-uniform and irregular morphology aggregated to each other with most of the particles in the range of 30–40 nm. But, codoping of a small amount of Na+ or K+ improves the morphology [Fig. 3(b) and (c)] and the samples exhibit both spherical- and flake-like particles. The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows an enlarged portion of the FESEM image where particles can be seen in a spherical shape. However, simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ has changed the morphology to thin small flakes as shown in Fig. 3(d). These uniform flakes have diameter ∼36 nm and length ∼340 nm. These flakes can be clearly seen at 100 nm resolution as shown in inset Fig. 3(d). According to the above results, it can be concluded that morphologies of the particles are greatly affected by codoping of alkali metal ions (Na+, K+).

In addition, the chemical composition and purity of the annealed CMKNa sample were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) as shown in Fig. 3(e). The EDX spectrum confirms the presence of calcium (Ca), molybdenum (Mo), oxygen (O), erbium (Er3+), ytterbium (Yb), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) elements in the sample. Next, elemental mapping was also carried out for the CMKNa sample in order to see the distribution of the constituent elements, which clearly indicates homogeneous distributions of Ca, Mo, O, Na, K and Yb throughout the sample [Fig. 4]. However, minute presence of Er3+ ions could not be detected.

3.2. Optical studies

3.2.1 UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. 
The UV-Visible absorption spectra of the samples taken in diffuse reflectance mode against a reference standard BaSO4 compound show a band at 310 nm [Fig. 5(a)] due to the band absorption of the CaMoO4 host.7,8 The other absorption bands around 488 nm, 521 nm and 656 nm corresponding to the 4F7/2 ← 4I15/2, 2H11/2 ← 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 ← 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, are observed in the spectra. The band around 978 nm is due to the 2F5/2 ← 2F7/2 transition of the Yb3+ ion.
 Fig. 5  (a) UV-Visible absorption spectrum in diffuse reflectance mode of CM, CMNa, CMK and CMKNa; Kubelka–Munk plots to calculate optical band gap for (b) CM and (c) CMKNa sample. 
Calculation of the band gap of a material from the diffuse reflectance spectrum was proposed by Kubelka and Munk.30 According to these authors, the band gap of the phosphor materials can be calculated by using the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function and Tauc's relation. The K–M function F(R∞) was calculated from the relation, F(R∞) = K/S = (1 − R∞)2/2R∞; where, K is the absorption coefficient, S is the scattering coefficient and R = Rsample/Rstandard. The well-known Tauc's relation is related to the band gap energy (Eg) by equation, (αhν) = A(hν − Eg)n; where, α is the linear absorption coefficient of a material, hν is the photon energy and A is the proportionality constant. The optical band gap energy (Eg) is calculated by combining the K–M function and Tauc's relation and can be written by the following expression30 [F(R∞)hν] = B(hν − Eg)n(1)where, ‘B’ is the proportionality constant and ‘n’ is a constant that characterizes the nature of the band transition which can have values n = 1/2 or 2 for direct or indirect band transitions, respectively. The plot is shown in Fig. 5(b and c). Previous literature supports that CaMoO4 is a direct band gap material29 and is estimated by plotting [F(R)hν]2 as a function of hν for direct band gap transition. From the plot of [F(R)hν]2versus hν, the value of Eg was extracted by extrapolating the linear fitted regions to [F(R)hν]2 = 0. The band gap for CM is calculated to be 3.26 eV, being close to that observed from the previous reports.29,31 However, there was a little increase in the band gap value to 3.34 eV on the addition of K+/Na+ ions in the CM sample which may be due to the removal of lower lying impurity states in the sample.27


3.2.2 Effect of Na+, K+ and K+/Na+ incorporation on UC properties. 
The UC emission spectra of Na+ and K+ co-doped CM phosphors were studied at room temperature upon 980 nm laser light excitation with a fixed power density of 15 W cm−2. In the first step, the concentration of Na+ and K+ was varied from 0 to 20 mol% and the resulting emission enhancements for the green and red bands are shown in the insets of Fig. 6(a) and (b). Maximum enhancement in the emission intensity was observed for 5 mol% Na+ and 10 mol% K+ doped samples. Beyond this optimum doping concentration, a gradual reduction in the UC emission intensity was noticed. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the comparison of the UC emission spectra of the CM sample with the optimized samples having 5 mol% Na+ and 10 mol% K+ codoping, respectively. The UC emission spectra show two strong green emission bands (530 nm and 552 nm) and a red emission band (656 nm) due to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. In addition, weak emission bands are observed in the blue (410 nm) and near infrared (798 nm) regions of the spectrum which are assigned to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4I9/2 → 4I15/2, transitions of the Er3+ ion. It is observed that there is no change in the shape and peak positions of the emission bands upon Na+ and K+ ion incorporation, except the change in emission intensity. The 5 mol% Na+ doping results in around 2 and 4 times emission enhancement for the green (530 nm) and red (665 nm) bands, respectively. On the other hand 10 mol% K+ results in around 3 and 2-times emission enhancement for the green and red bands in comparison to the CM sample. It is worthy to note that, Na+ enhances red emission while K+ enhances green emission by a large amount. Both Na+ and K+ ions act as charge compensators and play a promising role in the enhancement of the emission intensity of alkali-alkaline earth based materials.
 Fig. 6  (a) Comparison of UC emission spectrum of CM sample with 5 mol% Na+ doped CM sample (b) comparison of UC emission spectrum of CM sample with 10 mol% K+ doped CM sample under 980 nm laser excitation. Insets in both the figures show the variation of green and red UC emission intensity at different Na+ and K+ concentrations. 
In a further study both Na+ and K+ were simultaneously co-doped in the CM phosphor. Here, the concentration of K+ was fixed at 10 mol% and the concentration of Na+ (1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 mol%) was varied. It was assumed that the smaller ionic radius of Na+ than K+ can easily occupy the Ca2+ vacancies. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the UC emission spectra of CM, CMNa, CMK and CMKNa samples. All the spectra were measured at 15 W cm−2 excitation power and it was noticed that the intensity of the green emission band was hugely enhanced upon the co-doping of K+/Na+ whereas the red band is not much affected. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the variation of the green band intensity with an increase in the Na+ concentration at a fixed K+ concentration i.e., at 10 mol%. The optimum emission intensity is obtained corresponding to a doping of 3 mol% Na+. At this doping concentration, the intensities of the green and red emission bands are increased by 36 and 5 times as compared to the CM sample. The enhancement in emission intensity by codoping of Na+ and K+ ions could be attributed to the charge compensation effect. In the CaMoO4 lattice, when trivalent RE3+ ions are doped into divalent (Ca2+) host sites, the RE3+ ions are expected to occupy the Ca2+ position. But, due to charge mismatch between RE3+ and Ca2+ ions, Ca vacancies  are created in the lattice.32–35 However, an excessive number of vacancies makes the structure unstable and reduces the luminescence intensity,33 which can be expressed as: . In order to keep charge balance and to remove Ca2+ vacancies, the addition of alkali metal ions (Na+, K+) is required, which stabilize the structure and enhance the luminescence intensity. The charge balance equation is: 2Ca2+ → RE3+ + Na+ (or K+).33,35 Furthermore, the incorporation of alkali metal cations, Na+ and K+ having different ionic radii in the host matrix may induce some distortion in the crystal lattice and alter the local symmetry around Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. It is also observed that beyond the optimum doping concentration of Na+ and K+ ions, the UC intensity is quenched and is due to the creation of new defect centres in the CaMoO4 matrix. Moreover, the UC intensity is greatly enhanced by codoping of Na+ ions along with K+ could be explained on the basis of the FTIR spectra of these samples. The simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ eliminates the OH− organic impurity from the sample (Fig. 2), which helps to increase the UC intensity by reducing non-radiative relaxation rate. Apart from this, the crystallinity of CMKNa phosphor with flakes like morphology and the removal of defects are additional reasons behind this increase. The major factor of enhancement is assumed to come from defect removal/charge compensation.
 Fig. 7  Comparison of UC emission spectra of optimized CM, CMNa, CMK and CMKNa samples. Inset figure shows the variation of UC intensity of green band (530 nm) as a function of Na+ concentration at a fixed K+ concentration at 10 mol%. 
Researchers have reported that the addition of alkali metal ions (mainly Li+, K+, Na+) into the rare earth doped materials leads to improved UC luminescence intensity.27,32–35 For instance, Antic et al.16 reported increments of two-fold green emission intensity of Gd2O3:Ho3+/Yb3+ nanopowder upon codoping of Li+ and Na+ ions. Enhancement of about 2 and 3.3 times in the green and red emission bands of β NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ microcrystals due to codoping of Li+ ions has been observed by Ding et al.36 Liang et al.17 have found enhancement in the green and red emission intensity via codoping of K+ ions in β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles. In all these reports, the observed maximum enhancement is less than 5 times but in the present work the maximum enhancement observed is ∼36 times for the CMKNa sample and it can be due to use of K+ ions along with the Na+. No report was found for the use of K+/Na+ simultaneous codoping in the literature for upconversion enhancement.
The above observations show that individual codoping of Na+ or K+ ions is an effective way to enhance the emission intensity of selected bands (green or red) of CM, though the enhancement is not very high. The simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ ions brings huge enhancement compared to individual codoping. The above results thus suggest that simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ ions is a very effective way to obtain high green UC luminescence.


3.2.3 Effect of excitation power on the UC properties. 
In order to investigate the effect of alkali ion codoping on the UC mechanisms, the UC emission intensities of the prepared samples were measured at various pump power densities. The graph for all the samples is shown in Fig. S1[a–c] (ESI†). The emission intensities of all the bands were found to increase continuously as the pump power was increased from 15 to 65 W cm−2. The green to red ratio (G/R) was calculated for all the samples and the plots are shown in Fig. S2[a–c] (ESI†). It is worthwhile to note that the G/R value increased from 0.37 to 0.43, 1.09 to 3.4 and 30 to 95, upon increasing the power density from 15 to 65 W cm−2 for CMNa, CMK and CMKNa phosphors, respectively. Simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ brought a faster increase in the G/R value compared to other codoping concentrations. This faster increase in G/R happened due to the slow increase in the intensity of the red band. The slow increase in the red band indicates the lowest defects/impurities in the K+/Na+ co-doped sample.
The number of photons responsible for green and red emission bands was calculated for all the samples and is presented in Table 1. It is well-known that for an unsaturated system, UC intensity follows the relation I ∝ Pn, where n is the number of photons involved in the UC process.37 The plot of lnI versus lnP yields a straight line with slope ‘n’ as shown in Fig. 8(a–c). All the emission bands must originate from two photon absorption processes. The calculated slope values were found to decrease with K+ and K+/Na+ incorporation. The slope value 0.71 of the red band (665 nm) for the K+/Na+ co-doped sample is much lower than the expected two photon values. This decrease in slope may be due to the saturation effects as reported elsewhere.20,38 As excitation powers were kept similar for each sample, the K+ or K+/Na+ codoped samples created more and more populations in 2H11/2, 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels due to reduction in the nonradiative decay rates. The excitation and emission pathways are shown in a simplified energy level diagram in Fig. 8(d) and possible upconversion mechanisms have been discussed in our previous reports.7,20,38 It is concluded on the basis of theoretical analysis of our previous work20 in the Er3+ and Yb3+ co-doped system, that the energy transfer (ET) plays a dominant role over excited state absorption (ESA) as it requires a high pump power to occur.

3.2.4 Photometric characterization. 
As the G/R value of CMNa, CMK and CMKNa samples changes with the excitation power, the emission color of these samples is also tuned with pump power. The color coordinates were calculated using 1931 CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage)39 chromaticity diagram and tabulated in Table S1 (ESI†). Fig. 9 shows the variation of UC colour with excitation power for the samples codoped with Na+, K+ and K+/Na+. In the Na+ codoped sample, the emission color is in the yellow region (0.43, 0.51) for 15 W cm−2 power density which is then shifted to the yellow-green region (0.41, 0.58) upon increasing the power density to 65 W cm−2. In the K+ codoped sample, the coordinates were seen to shift from the yellow-green region (0.35, 0.62) to green region (0.27, 0.70) within the same power range. Furthermore, in the K+/Na+ codoped sample, the emission color is in the green region (0.21, 0.74) at low pump power (15 W cm−2) which then further moved to the pure green region (0.14, 0.81) at 65 W cm−2. It is necessary to mention that the obtained phosphors exhibit colour tunability with excitation power and three different emission colours have been observed from all the three phosphors.

3.2.5 Lifetime analysis. 
The emission lifetimes of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels, corresponding to green and red emission bands, respectively were measured for all the four samples under 980 nm light excitation. The lifetime of the curves of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions were well fitted to a bi-exponential function as shown in Fig. 10(a–d) and (e–h). The bi-exponential function can be expressed as:40 (2)where, I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time t. A1 and A2 are constants and τ1 and τ2 are the shorter and longer lifetime components, respectively.
 Fig. 10  Lifetime curves for 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ for (a) CM (b) CMNa (c) CMK (d) CMKNa, and lifetime curves for 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ for (e) CM (f) CMNa (g) CMK (h) CMKNa. 
The lifetime values of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions for all the four samples are presented in the figure. It is found that the longer lifetime component (τ2) of both 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels is found to increase with the incorporation of alkali metal ions in the CM sample. This increase in lifetime also suggests the reduction of quenching/defect centres upon alkali ions doping. The shorter component for the 4S3/2 level is found too short to correlate it with the energy levels and hence assumed to occur due to the light trapping, scattering of excitation light, etc. However, in several reports the short component is assigned to the ions present at the interfacial sites.40,41 From the lifetime values, it can be seen that Na+ has more effect on the enhancement of lifetime of the 4F9/2 level while K+ on the 4S3/2 level, a similar nature observed in the UC intensity (Fig. 6).


3.2.6 Temperature sensing study. 
As we see from the above observations that the sample gave highly enhanced emission with K+/Na+ codoping, the authors investigated the temperature sensing properties of this phosphor and compared between CMKNa and CM samples. Fig. 11(a) shows the green UC spectra of the CMKNa sample in the wavelength range 510–570 nm measured within the 306–513 K temperature range at a fixed excitation pump power density (7 W cm−2). It is noticed that the position of the emission bands does not change with temperature, whereas the relative intensity of the emission bands changes. This change is used to estimate the temperature of the sample. Fig. 11(b) shows the plot of the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of two emission bands at 530 nm and 552 nm as a function of temperature for CM and CMKNa samples. It can be seen from the figure that the FIR values increase with temperature for both the samples but the rate of increment in FIR is more for the CMKNa sample. Moreover, the energy gap between the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels is about 770 cm−1, which allows the population of the 2H11/2 level via thermal excitation from the 4S3/2 level. The variation of FIR with temperature follows the Boltzmann-type population distribution and can be expressed as:7 (3)where I530 and I552 are the integrated intensities corresponding to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (530 nm) and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (552 nm) transitions, respectively. ΔE is the energy gap between the two emitting levels, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. The co-efficient B is dependent on the radiative probabilities of the transitions, degeneracy of levels 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 and photon energies of the two transitions.
 Fig. 11  (a) Temperature dependent upconversion emission spectra for 530 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2) and 552 nm (4S3/2 → 4I15/2) of CMKNa phosphor excited by 980 nm excitation; (b) variation of FIR with temperature; (c) the monolog plot of the FIR (I530/I552) as a function of inverse absolute temperature; (d) variation of absolute sensitivity (S) with temperature. 

Fig. 11(c) shows the plot of ln(FIR) as a function of the inverse absolute temperature T in the range of 306–513 K for CM and CMKNa. The experimental data is well fitted to a straight line with the slopes (ΔE/k) of about – 650 and 1193 cm−1 for the CM and CMKNa samples, respectively and the corresponding calculated energy difference ΔE from the slopes are – 452 cm−1 and 829 cm−1. The values of co-efficient B were also obtained according to the fitting curves of the experimental data. Furthermore, absolute sensitivity (S) is an important parameter for sensing application and can be defined as the rate of change of FIR with respect to temperature, expressed as:7 (4)where all the terms have their usual meaning. This equation suggests that using the thermally coupled levels with a larger energy gap (ΔE) gives larger sensitivity. The sensitivity was calculated using eqn (4) and the plot is shown in Fig. 11(d). The maximum value of sensitivity is observed to be 5.32 × 10−3 K−1 at 360 K and 21.68 × 10−3 K−1 at 490 K in the CM and CMKNa samples, respectively. The maximum value of sensitivity is about four times higher in the case of the K+/Na+ doped sample. The reason behind the enhanced sensitivity in K+/Na+ codoped sample is expected due to the tailoring effect of the crystal field environment around Er3+ ions in the CaMoO4 matrix. The temperature sensing performance of other Er3+ doped materials is compared with the present results (Table 2). It can be seen that sensitivity achieved in CMKNa phosphor is very high compared to that of other reported materials. Therefore, simultaneous codoping of K+/Na+ in CM phosphor could be exploited for temperature sensing with better sensitivity and upgrade this material as one of the highly sensitive upconversion based thermometers.

3.2.7 Cathodoluminescence study. 
In addition, the CL properties of CM and CMKNa samples were investigated for field emission display applications. Fig. 12(a) compares the CL spectra (accelerating voltage = 5 keV, filament current = 1 μA) that show the presence of intense green emissions at 525 and 550 nm with some weak red emission bands at 660 nm. All the observed bands are the characteristic emission bands of Er3+ ions. The comparative CL spectra show that the CL emission intensity increased due to K+/Na+ doping. A similar observation was made in the SrMoO4:Eu3+ phosphor due to Na+ doping.47 Accelerating voltage dependent CL study [Fig. 12(b)] shows that the CL intensity increased with increasing accelerating voltage, at a fixed filament current of 1 μA. Increase in the accelerating voltage refers to a deeper penetration of electrons into the phosphor material and the higher the penetration depth, the more the plasma produced. In CL, the Er3+ ions are excited by the plasma produced by the incident electrons, which results in the excitation of more Er3+ ions and thus CL emission intensity increased. One can find that the emission intensity also increased with increasing filament current [Fig. 12(c)]. The reason for this emission enhancement can be ascribed to the larger electron-beam current density with increasing filament current.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, charge compensated tetragonal CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphors with flake-like morphology were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. The effect of Na+ and K+ ions were seen to play a dominant role in increasing upconversion and cathodoluminescence emissions. The simultaneous incorporation of K+/Na+ ions can significantly enhance the green and red emission bands by 36 and 5 times, respectively. The enhancement was further verified by an increase in the radiative lifetimes of the emitting levels of Er3+ ion. A small contribution of enhancement can be attributed to the vacancies present in the non-charge compensated sample. Furthermore, temperature sensitivity of the sample was found to be improved by K+/Na+ doping and the maximum sensitivity was found to be 0.0216 K−1 at 490 K. The result suggests that intense green emitting K+/Na+ doped CaMoO4:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor is an interesting thermographic phosphor for temperature sensing, display devices and biological applications.
