    , Accepted 2nd August 2016First published on 4th August 2016AbstractThe charge transfer dynamics involving a new Ru(II) polypyridine complex (1), developed to generate highly oxidizing photoholes for water oxidation, was studied by electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and spectroscopic means. Mesoporous TiO2 electrodes sensitized with complex 1, under 1 sun illumination (420 nm cut-off filter) and a moderate applied bias (0.3 V vs. SCE), in ACN/0.1 M LiI as a sacrificial electron donor reach an anodic photocurrent of ∼0.2 mA cm−2 with 3% photon-to-current conversion efficiency. When 0.1 M aqueous sodium ascorbate (pH 3) is used instead of iodide, the photocurrent increases to ∼0.7 mA cm−2 and up to 1 mA cm−2 if the concentration of ascorbate is increased to 0.5 M, explainable with a modification of the charge injection mechanism. This is the photoelectrochemical evidence, in the heterogeneous phase, of the so-called “anti-biomimetic” pathway, confirmed in transient absorption spectroscopy by a long lived sharp bleaching at 480 nm and a narrow absorption between 500 and 550 nm, characteristic fingerprints of the photogenerated reduced state (1−). After the formation of *1/TiO2, reductive quenching by ascorbate occurs, not observed in LiI where the classic oxidative quenching takes place. Due to the modest excited state oxidation potential, electron transfer to TiO2 is thermodynamically more favorable from 1− than *1. Lastly, experiments performed with sensitized SnO2 photoanodes, where *1 undergoes the usual oxidative quenching, by charge transfer to the conduction band of the metal oxide allowed us to verify the interaction between 1+ and IrO2 nanoparticles, grafted onto the surface in order to drive photoinduced water oxidation.
Introduction
Photoinduced electron transfer from a molecular species grafted on a semiconductor is widely regarded as a possible first step in molecular artificial photosynthetic schemes aimed at the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy, based on Dye-Sensitized Photo-Electrosynthetic Cells (DSPEC). Significant examples of DSPEC have been reported in recent years, starting from pioneering approaches,1,2 and are currently investigated by various research teams worldwide,3–11 often in the form of half cells (i.e. photoanodes or photocathodes employed in three electrode configurations). Usually, the competition between interfacial recombination and hole transfer to a water oxidation catalyst is the key problem limiting the efficiency of such devices.10
In an effort to develop a charge transfer sensitizer with a strongly oxidizing ground state, suited for being coupled with a wide selection of hole transfer catalysts (either nanoscopic or molecular species), we have developed and fully characterized compounds p1 and its acidic form 1 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, it was found that the excited state of the TiO2-anchored species 1 has a poor ability to inject electrons into the TiO2 conduction band (CB), whereas a substantial increase in photoanodic current is observed when the electrode is exposed to ascorbate solutions. This effect was interpreted on the basis of photoelectrochemical and transient spectroscopic measurements, according to the anti-biomimetic mechanism (Scheme 1), where the main excited state deactivation pathway occurs via reductive photoinduced electron transfer by ascorbate salts, leading to the reduced Ru(II)–L− species having an increased reduction potential.12 Recently, the anti-biomimetic mechanism has been introduced to rationalize the machinery of a sacrificial system for photoinduced water oxidation, based on a tetranuclear dendritic Ru(II) species as the antenna/sensitizer and a tetraruthenium polyoxometalate species as the molecular catalyst, in the presence of persulfate salts, used as the sacrificial electron acceptor.13–15 Some other authors16,17 have previously considered this alternative pathway as a feasible approach to TiO2 sensitization. Nevertheless, although spectroscopic evidence for charge injection by the reduced sensitizer has been reported,17 and sustained photocurrent generation on SnO2 electrodes by such a mechanism was proposed to occur by Kirsch-De Mesmaeker,16 a functional photoanode based on a nanostructured TiO2 electrode taking clear advantage of the anti-biomimetic mechanism has remained elusive.18–20

 Scheme 1  Quenching of the excited state of a charge transfer photosensitizer (P): in the biomimetic pathway (green arrows, numbers 1–2–3B–4B) the oxidation quenching takes place by electron transfer to the acceptor (A, in our case the semiconductor CB), followed by electron donation from the donor (D, the electrolyte or the water oxidation catalyst) restoring the photosensitizer to the initial situation. Instead in the anti-biomimetic pathway (red arrows, numbers 1–2–3A–4A) the sequence of electron transfer events is reversed. 
DSPEC, which are still in their infancy, are based on the biomimetic mechanism, although the anti-biomimetic mechanism could reserve intriguing properties: for example, it could allow us to use as dyes for DSPECs (and the argument can be extended to Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells for solar-to-electricity conversion, DSSCs) even compounds whose excited states are not reducing enough to inject an electron into the semiconductor electrode, thus extending the range of useful species and removing some limits to the designing principles of these devices. Furthermore, the anti-biomimetic pathway avoids the formation of the oxidized form of the photosensitizer, so it could be profitably used when the stability of the oxidized photosensitizer – not an uncommon problem for DSSCs – is an issue.21
Results and discussion
Synthetic pathway and spectroscopic, photophysical and redox properties in solution
Our aim was to prepare a Ru(II) polypyridine compound having reversible electrochemistry, photochemical stability, and oxidation potential positive enough to drive water oxidation at mild pH, a necessary requirement for building a DSPEC suitable for water splitting.22 These goals can be achieved by using chelating polypyridine ligands containing strong electron withdrawing substituents: as previously reported by some of us,23 we envisaged that a Ru(II) compound like 1 would have been able to fulfil all these requirements. Scheme 2 summarizes the synthetic pathways for ligand L and compound 1, passing through the protected compound p1.

The emission spectra at 298 K and 77 K of p1 are also reported in the inset of Fig. 2.

The absorption and luminescence properties of 1 and p1 are in line with the properties of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes in general,25–27 and in good agreement with those of Ru(II) complexes containing bis(pyridyl)triazine ligands.28 For both complexes, the absorption spectrum in the visible is dominated by spin-allowed metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) bands and the emission spectra, both at room temperature and at 77 K, are assigned to triplet MLCT states, involving the bis(pyridyl)triazine ligand, which is expected to have a lower-lying π* orbital than the terpy-type ligand.28 From the maximum of the p1 emission spectrum at 77 K (700 nm), a zero-to-zero spectroscopic energy (E0–0) of 1.77 eV is obtained, which represents the energy gap between the triplet MLCT state and the ground state.
Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations carried out on the optimized ground state structure of p1 in the presence of acetonitrile (ACN), described according to the Integral Equation Formalism of Polarizable Continuum Model (IEFCPM), predict singlet vertical optical transitions which describe in a very satisfactory fashion the experimental spectrum recorded in solution, showing a sharp absorption maximum at ca. 480 nm (Fig. 3A). The computed transitions are generally characterized by a distinct MLCT character, involving the transfer of electron density from prevailingly Ru(II)-centered orbitals to the π* orbital of the bis(pyridyl)triazine (L) ligand. Interestingly, the aromatic ring bearing the phosphonic ester showed a dihedral angle close to 0°, in agreement with the X-ray results (see Fig. 1), as the consequence of stabilizing interactions between the triazole nitrogens and the protons of the phenyl ring bearing the phosphonic ester group. By contrast, the tilt angle of the tolyl substituent on the other terpyridine ligand is ca. 48°. The Electron Density Difference Maps (EDDM) show a sizable electron density in the ortho and para-positions of the phenyl-phosphonic ring (Fig. 3A), positions that should allow us to establish an acceptable electronic coupling with the TiO2 surface. However, contrary to carboxylic acid binding groups, no electron density is observed directly on the phosphonic group, in agreement with previous comparative studies on phosphonic acid functionalized MLCT complexes.29 The MM (Molecular Mechanics) evaluation of the adsorption geometry of 1 on the 101 surface of a TiO2 cluster, by relaxing only the two P–O–Ti linkages, while freezing the other internal coordinates, computed at a more accurate DFT level, shows that 1 interacts with the TiO2 surface with a tilt angle close to 80° (Fig. 3B). Given this geometry, the shortest pathway for the electron transfer from the MLCT state to TiO2 should involve a “through bond” mechanism with the mediation of a non-conjugating −PO3H2 group.

The most significant transitions (lowest and most intense) are associated with EDDM maps (semitransparent surfaces) depicting “hole” (orange) and “electron” (cyan). (B) Complex 1 attached to the TiO2 surface slab described at the MM level. 
The very small emission quantum yield (<10−4) and short lifetime (ca. 10 ns) of p1 and 1 at room temperature are attributed to the weak ligand field induced by the bis(pyridyl)triazine ligand, as a consequence of both the tridentate nature of the ligands25–27 and the inherent weak ligand field of the triazine subunit.28 The difference between p1 and 1 is minimal from a spectroscopic viewpoint (both absorption spectra and emission spectra are similar for the two compounds) (Table 1). In contrast, a somewhat larger difference in emission lifetime is found at 77 K, with that of 1 (340 ns) significantly shorter than that of p1 (630 ns) under these conditions; possible radiationless pathways involving peripheral −PO3H2 groups (that are present in 1, but not in p1) can have a role in determining this difference under these conditions.
The redox behavior of p1 has been studied in acetonitrile by cyclic voltammetry (see ESI Fig. S1;† data are collected in Table 2) in the potential window +1.70/−1.80 V vs. SCE. The compound undergoes a reversible, one-electron oxidation process involving the metal center, at +1.41 V vs. SCE, and several reversible one-electron reduction processes at −0.71 V, −1.50 V, and −1.61 V vs. SCE that are assigned to the first reduction of the bis(pyridyl)triazine ligand, the first reduction of the terpyridine-type ligand, and the second reduction of the bis(pyridyl)triazine ligand respectively. Such assignments are based on literature data of similar compounds.25,28 The experimental electrochemical gap (2.12 eV) is in very good agreement with the computational spectroscopic gap (2.08 eV, from the lowest singlet transition energy at 595 nm), thus confirming the identity between spectroscopic and redox orbitals and the presence of substantially localized redox states (i.e. states centered on distinct weakly interacting metal and ligand orbitals). The weak adsorption tail extending further to the red, up to 700 nm, could thus originate from spin forbidden singlet to triplet absorption, consistent with the threshold (ca. 640 nm) of the emission spectra from the lowest triplet state.25–27

The redox behavior of 1 in fluid solution could not be studied in detail: in fact, particularly on reduction, 1 tends to be absorbed on the electrode and a clear determination of the redox processes becomes impossible. Nevertheless p1 represents a good model for the dye when anchored on TiO2, and we also use the photophysical data of p1 as a model for the properties of 1 anchored to TiO2. Cyclic voltammetries in the oxidative regime of 1 adsorbed onto either mesoporous TiO2 or SnO2 thin films are shown in Fig. 4, confirming the reversible behavior observed in solution (Table 2). However, the metal-centered redox wave is slightly cathodically shifted (1.37 V vs. SCE on TiO2 and 1.32 V vs. SCE on SnO2) compared to the solution (1.41 V vs. SCE). Nevertheless the driving force is, in principle, still sufficient for the activation of a wide selection of water oxidation catalysts.1,30–34

From the luminescence data in Table 1, the redox data discussed above, and the simplified equation *Eox = Eox − E0–0,35 commonly used to estimate the excited-state oxidation potential *Eox, for p1, the model for 1 anchored on TiO2, *Eox results to be −0.36 V vs. SCE for the excited triplet state, indicating that photo-injection from the lowest excited state of 1 to the conduction band edge should be thermodynamically uphill.36,37 The singlet excited state oxidation potential, estimated by combining the experimental Eox with the computed singlet E0–0, is more reducing, at a value of −0.66 V vs. SCE, approximately isoergonic with the conduction band edge of TiO2 in non-anhydrous acetonitrile, and barely above the conduction band edge of TiO2 in aqueous solution at pH 3, according to Vfb = −0.4–0.06 × pH (V vs. SCE).38 These values are definitely too low to allow for efficient photoinduced electron transfer from the excited state of 1 into the TiO2 conduction band, particularly if the intersystem crossing to the triplet state is competing efficiently with injection from the singlet state. This is probably the case with complex 1, given both an insufficient driving force and non-optimal coupling with the TiO2 surface, due to the presence of non-conjugating phosphonic binding groups. By contrast, the 1 triplet excited state reduction potential (*Ered = +1.06 V vs. SCE), calculated from Ered + E0–0,25 is positive enough to allow for reductive excited state quenching from ascorbate.39,40
Photoelectrochemistry
Photoelectrochemical experiments, relevant to the discussion of the different excited state quenching pathways of 1, were carried out with three different types of electrolytes: aqueous 0.1 M NaClO4 at pH 3, aqueous sodium ascorbate at pH 3 where the ascorbate concentration ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 M and LiI in acetonitrile where the LiI concentration varied from 0.1 to 0.5 M.
The charge-transfer dynamics of 1, relevant to application in molecular artificial photosynthesis, were preliminarily studied by fabricating transparent TiO2 photoanodes with 7 ± 1 μm thickness, according to the procedure reported in the Experimental section. Soaking in a 8 × 10−5 M acetonitrile solution of complex 1 at 50 °C for two hours led to the functionalization of TiO2 electrodes with maximum absorbance values of ∼2 at 480 nm (Fig. 5A), demonstrating efficient dye uptake. The assessment of the dye stability in aqueous solution at pH 3 in the presence of sodium ascorbate as a sacrificial agent results in the loss of ca. 32% of the maximum optical density after ca. 10 minutes soaking (Fig. 5B, red line), during which the photoelectrode is subjected to several J–V cycles (typically from +0.35 to −0.5 V SCE), until reaching a stationary photoelectrochemical response in J–V mode under illumination. By contrast, the stability in organic solvents under the same measurement conditions is optimal, with no appreciable changes in film absorbance during potential cycling (Fig. 5B, dark cyan line). The bare TiO2 films show, after 10 minutes of soaking and potential cycling in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3, an absorbance increase in the blue region of the visible spectrum, due to the formation of a charge transfer adduct between surface exposed Ti(IV) and ascorbate (Fig. 5B, dashed grey line) which was found to act as the charge transfer sensitizer.41
 Fig. 5  Averaged absorption spectra of the TiO2 electrodes with error bars calculated on a set of three equivalent electrodes sensitized with 1. (A) Before measurements, 1/TiO2 (red circles) in comparison with bare mesoporous TiO2 (black squares). (B) Bare TiO2 (black squares) compared with 1/TiO2 after a 10 minute measurement cycle in 0.1 M sodium ascorbate at pH 3 (red circles) and with 1/TiO2 after soaking and measurement in 0.1 M LiI in ACN (dark cyan circles). The absorbance of the bare TiO2 film immersed in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (dashed grey line) is also reported for reference. 
The J–V curves (Fig. 6A) obtained under AM 1.5 G illumination with a 420 nm cut-off filter indicate that 1/TiO2 generates a modest plateau photocurrent density of ∼0.2 mA cm−2 and a Voc of ca. −0.35 V vs. SCE in the presence of 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile. As expected the blank TiO2 electrode gave a negligible photoresponse, due to insufficient light harvesting. By contrast, in 0.1 M sodium ascorbate at pH 3 a more than threefold increase in photocurrent (0.7 mA cm−2) and enhanced photovoltage (−0.5 V vs. SCE) were observed for 1/TiO2 (Fig. 6A). The blank TiO2 film also generated a higher plateau photocurrent (0.3 mA cm−2) due to the local formation of the titanium ascorbate sensitizer. Clearly, the formation of Ti(IV) ascorbate cannot explain the enhanced photocurrent observed with 1/TiO2. Both photocurrent and photovoltage are improved by increasing the ascorbate concentration up to 0.5 M (Fig. 6B), leading to rectangular-shaped phototransients reaching 1 mA cm−2 and a photovoltage of ca. −0.55 V vs. SCE, in good agreement with the estimation of the TiO2 flat band potential.38 Control experiments carried out with 1/TiO2 in aqueous NaClO4 at pH 3 (Fig. S2†) confirmed, through the observation of short lived photoinjection spikes reaching maximum amplitudes of only 2–3 μA cm−2, the inefficient oxidative quenching of 1 loaded on TiO2. Although, in the absence of an electron donor with facile kinetics, the low photocurrent is also determined by fast charge recombination with the oxidized dye, much stronger (50–100 μA cm−2) injection transients are usually observed when charge injection is efficient.42 It should be noted that, as previously documented,4 photoelectrochemical experiments in the presence of iodide salts in aqueous solvents are scarcely meaningful due to efficient adsorption of the iodide oxidation products on the sensitized TiO2 surface, resulting in accelerated electron recombination via surface adsorbed polyiodides.
 Fig. 6  
J–V curves of TiO2 photoanodes in the presence of different electrolytes: (A) 1/TiO2 in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (red); 1/TiO2 in ACN/0.1 M LiI (dark cyan); bare TiO2 in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (grey); bare TiO2 in 0.1 M LiI (blue); (B) shuttered J–Vs of 1/TiO2 in the presence of increasing ascorbate concentrations, 0.1 M (black), 0.25 M (red) and 0.5 M (blue). 
These results are consistent with IPCE spectra (Fig. 7A), where the best conversion efficiency of ca. 10% is observed, within the explored conditions, in 0.5 M ascorbate. The IPCE spectrum of 1 in the presence of ascorbate shows a shoulder around 450 nm due to the direct contribution of Ti(IV) ascorbate whose absorption begins to rise in this spectral region (Fig. 5B, grey line). Nevertheless, the increased IPCE at 550 nm, in a region where direct contribution of Ti(IV) ascorbate becomes relatively unimportant, confirms that most of the photoconversion originates from the ruthenium sensitizer. In the presence of LiI the IPCE is modest, confirming the poor reducing ability of the excited states of 1, which, combined with its short lifetime and less than ideal electronic coupling with the TiO2 surface, results in a quantum yield of charge injection of the order of 3%, under the reasonable assumption that regeneration of 1 by iodide occurs with nearly unitary efficiency.

(B) Stern–Volmer plot of the emission lifetime quenching of 1 in acetonitrile upon ascorbate addition. The ascorbate quencher solution was prepared in water (pH 3), for solubility reasons. It is noteworthy that the addition of LiI to a solution 1 under analogous conditions does not cause any emission quenching. 
In order to further support our hypothesis, bimolecular electron transfer quenching of the luminescence of 1 by ascorbate was studied changing the ascorbate concentration in acetonitrile solution. Fig. 7B shows the typical, linear Stern–Volmer plot obtained, thus confirming that ascorbate can efficiently quench the excited state of 1, with kq = 7.14 × 107 M−1 s−1.
Charge injection from the excited state of 1 in the presence of 0.1 M LiI is clearly observed on mesoporous SnO2 films having <2 μm thickness (maximum optical density 0.5, Fig. S3†), where the flat potential of SnO2 (ca. −0.1 V vs. SCE) clearly allows for the oxidative quenching of the excited state of 1. The photocurrent, as well as the IPCE, increases with increasing the LiI concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 M with top values of 2.3 mA cm−2 at 0.3 V vs. SCE, corresponding to a maximum IPCE of the order of 22% (Fig. 8A and B). The poor fill factor (ca. 0.25) observed with thin SnO2 electrodes is ostensibly due to recombination from SnO2 and from the underlying FTO back contact, which is more exposed to the electrolyte, being covered by a thinner SnO2 layer as compared to the TiO2 film. Monochromatic (490 nm) J–V curves (Fig. S4†) also show a more ideal shape under a low power density, consistent with a small shunt resistance of SnO2. From the described results and taking into account the thermodynamic and electronic considerations mentioned above, it appears that, in the presence of LiI containing electrolytes, electron injection into TiO2 takes place directly from the excited state of 1, following the usual oxidative quenching of the excited state of the sensitizer grafted on the semiconductor surface. However, it has a very modest efficiency on TiO2 while it undergoes a significant improvement on SnO2, due to increased exoergonicity for such a charge transfer pathway.

The ability to generate and store highly oxidizing photogenerated holes on SnO2 photoanodes has been preliminarily confirmed in a water splitting cell, where 1 was coupled with IrO2 nanoparticles acting as a water oxidation catalyst.2,11 Although the coupling between the sensitizer and the catalyst was not optimized, there can be observed (Fig. 9) an increased photoanodic current density (two to three times higher current density under steady state conditions) in the presence of IrO2, suggesting the activation of hole transfer pathways to these co-adsorbed nanoparticles.

The increased photon-to-electron conversion observed on TiO2, in the presence of ascorbate salt, is consistent with a reductive quenching of the MLCT excited state due to a bimolecular reaction with ascorbate, resulting in the formation of a species with a reducing ability higher than that of the singlet and the triplet excited states of 1. The reductive quenching, i.e. the anti-biomimetic mechanism, is followed by thermodynamically-allowed electron injection into TiO2. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, in solution and on various semiconductor substrates, has been used to confirm this interesting point.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Upon 532 nm laser excitation of 1 in acetonitrile solution, population of the triplet MLCT state occurs, which decays completely within 40 ns from the laser pulse, according to a monoexponential behavior with a lifetime of about 9 ns (Fig. 10). This value appears to be in good agreement with that estimated by the more accurate time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) technique (7 ns in fluid solution, Table 1), resulting in a transient absorption partly convoluted with the excitation profile of the Nd:YAG source (FWHM, 7 ns). The short-lived triplet state has the typical features of MLCT excited states of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes, characterized by the bleaching of the MLCT band, peaking at 480 nm, a relatively intense and narrow absorption in the blue region, peaking at ca. 400 nm, and by a weaker but well defined absorption band extending into the red region with a broad maximum between 600 and 700 nm.

When an excess of aqueous ascorbate at pH 3 is added to the ACN solution, in order to achieve ca. 0.3 M concentration in an Ar-purged ACN/H2O mixture, a significant change in excited state decay occurs, showing the instrumental response limited decay (τ = 7.5 ns) to a long-lived signal having at least 1/3 of the initial ΔA amplitude and which remains essentially constant within a time interval of 500 ns (Fig. 11B). This signal is consistent with the formation of the reduced state of 1, which is able to survive long in the absence of oxygen and other electron scavengers in the solvent medium. The TA of the reduced form shows some analogy with the triplet excited state spectrum, but it is characterized by its own diagnostic fingerprints consisting of a narrower structured bleaching peaking at 480 nm, preceded and followed by two small shoulders at 450 nm and 510 nm, which develop in a narrow absorption band between 500 and 550 nm (Fig. 11A and C). The absorption at longer wavelengths, beyond 600 nm, is weak, flat and featureless. It is interesting to note that, in large part, these spectral features are already present in the transients taken immediately after the excitation pulse, and are very similar to those recorded after the establishment of the long-lived state which follows the initial fast decay (Fig. 11C). We thus conclude that, in the presence of a large excess of ascorbic acid, similar in concentration to that used in the electrolyte for photoanode testing, the reductive quenching in solution is nearly instantaneous (for the temporal resolution of our spectrometer) and that the fast initial decay occurring within a few ns is mostly due to electron/hole recombination within the bimolecular adduct (i.e. within the ion pair 1−/ascorbate+), of which only a fraction is able to separate, finally yielding the long-lived charge separated species. Similar spectral fingerprints, as well as long lived kinetics, are found in 1 grafted on ZrO2 films, showing that 1− can be accumulated also on inert (with respect to charge injection) semiconductor surfaces when exposed to ascorbate solutions (Fig. 11D).

The transient spectra of 1 loaded on SnO2 exposed to an ACN/0.1 M Li+ solution are consistent with the formation of Ru(III), following the oxidative quenching of the excited state by charge injection into the SnO2 conduction band. The 1+ state is characterized by slow, multiexponential kinetics which do not completely lead back to the ground state on a time scale of 10000 ns (Fig. 12B), according to the comparatively slow Ru(III)/e−(SnO2) back electron transfer. The characteristic spectral signature of the charge separated state 1+/e−(SnO2) is summarized by the intense bleaching of the ground state, leading to a minimum at 480 nm followed by a 510 nm shoulder (Fig. 12A for the 150–9000 ns time range and Fig. S5† for the early 0–150 ns time range). Contrary to the signature of the excited state, the transient spectrum of the oxidized sensitizer lacks the broad but well defined band having a maximum between 650 and 700 nm and only shows a featureless, weak, sloping absorption increase for λ > 650 nm due to the sum of both LMCT transitions and optical contributions of photoinjected electrons trapped into SnO2.

The transient spectrum of 1 loaded on TiO2 in the presence of ACN/Li+ (Fig. 13A) shows the dominant contribution of the triplet excited state of the sensitizer, decaying within a few tens of nanoseconds and having the characteristic 650–700 nm absorption hump, confirming that excited state quenching by electron transfer into TiO2 is largely inefficient. Nevertheless a small long lived amplitude having ca. 20% of the initial amplitude (Fig. 13B) is detected and assigned on the basis of the spectral fingerprints observed at long delays (i.e. bleaching band with two shoulders and sloping absorption for λ > 650 nm, Fig. S6†), to the (weakly efficient) formation of the oxidized dye. This is consistent with the small, but clearly detectable photoanodic current observed in ACN/0.1 M LiI (Fig. 6A, dark cyan).
 Fig. 13  (A) Transient spectrum of 1 loaded on TiO2 in the presence of an ACN/0.1 M Li+ electrolyte (0–50 ns delay); (B) kinetic traces observed at 600 and 400 nm, showing the formation of a long lived state assigned to Ru(III). At 600 nm the Ru(III) state has a negligible contribution and only the excited state decay is observed. 
In the presence of sodium ascorbate at pH 3 (Fig. 14) the dynamics on TiO2 become complicated by the presence of at least three possible excited-state deactivation pathways, leading to three different transient species, all of them expected to have a short lifetime: (a) the triplet excited state; (b) the reduced state of the sensitizer (1−), formed by reductive quenching of the excited state, which would be continuously depleted by charge transfer into TiO2 without the possibility of substantial accumulation; (c) the oxidized dye formed by injection from the singlet state, also short-lived due to reduction by ascorbate acting as an electron donor towards Ru(III). The possibility of discriminating these three photo-products is related to the analysis of the transients at early delays: the spectral signature observed at 0–40 ns delays after the laser pulse is consistent with the prevailing presence of the triplet state of 1, characterized by the structureless bleaching of the ground state followed by the diagnostic absorption band in the 650–700 nm interval. Consistent with the excited state lifetime measured in solution and on ZrO2, 90% of the initial amplitude decays within 40 ns from the laser pulse. There is a small component, about 10% of the initial ΔA, which however survives well beyond the excited state decay. We note that, due to the convolution of the excited state with the excitation pulse, we cannot reliably observe a shortening of the triplet lifetime in the presence of the reductive quenching by ascorbate.
 Fig. 14  Transient absorption spectrum of 1 loaded on TiO2 in the presence of 0.3 M ascorbate at pH 3: inset: transient spectrum recorded at 150 ns delay, after the complete decay of the excited state. 
Despite the modest signal-to-noise ratio, the analysis of this residual component is consistent with the survival of a small population of 1−, characterized by a narrow bleaching band centered at 480 nm and by a flat long wavelength absorption (Fig. 14, inset), which, contrary to the oxidized state, does not display the characteristic sloping feature for λ > 700 nm. It is noteworthy that the TA spectrum of this residual component is similar to the TA spectrum related to 1 on ZrO2 in the presence of ascorbate (on comparison of Fig. 11D and the inset in Fig. 14). Therefore, in the presence of ascorbate, the main sensitization mechanism involves reductive quenching of the excited state of 1. The observation of a prevailing population of the excited state is suggestive of the following possibilities: (i) a significant fraction of the complex immobilized on the TiO2 surface is not able to form encounter complexes with ascorbic acid contained in the electrolyte; (ii) a large fraction of 1− is able to inject within the instrumental response of the laser apparatus and is therefore not observed; (iii) a large fraction of the 1−/ascorbate+ adduct recombines reforming 1 at the triplet state. Based on the photoelectrochemical results, from which maximum IPCEs of the order of 10% are observed (Fig. 7A), we can dismiss point (ii), otherwise a much larger photon-to-electron conversion would be achieved. The possibility (iii) also seems unlikely, based on the results obtained in mixed ACN/water solution (Fig. 11A and C), considering that no prevailing triplet state is observed under those conditions, but rather the reduced state is the dominant species, already clearly observable at very early delays after the excitation pulse. We can thus confirm that in the presence of ascorbate salt on the TiO2 surface a non-negligible fraction of the excited state of 1 is reductively intercepted by ascorbic acid, forming 1− as the main charge-injecting species. This process has, on TiO2, a rather low efficiency, probably due to the limited availability of ascorbate, interacting mostly with the surface, as well as to steric blocking effects that limit the access of ascorbate to the majority of titania sites on the electrode, consistent with the relatively modest IPCE. Nevertheless, in the case of the dye under investigation, it provides a significantly improved photon-to-electron conversion with respect to the conventional sensitization mechanism based on direct charge transfer to TiO2. We would like to note that the residual long-lived transient component associated with the persistence of 1− on TiO2 is ostensibly due to a fraction of reduced dye, which is not able to inject due to the occupancy of surface sites having either a locally higher reorganization energy or a less favorable electronic coupling with the surface. Fluctuations in the reorganization energy associated with the charge transfer may be decisive in determining the possibility of injection by weakly exoergonic states, like that of 1− compared to the CB level of TiO2.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized a new phosphonated Ru(II) polypyridine complex, characterized by electrochemical reversibility, a strongly oxidizing Ru(III) state, and intense optical transitions in the visible region, in order to obtain an efficient and stable dye for the sensitization of semiconductor based photoanodes in DSPEC. Preliminary spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses have underlined the promising properties of 1 as a sensitizer, both for the high ε values in the visible region and the redox potentials. From ab initio results and MM modelling of 1 grafted onto the TiO2 cluster surface, a less than ideal electronic communication between the dye MLCT state and TiO2 acceptor states was expected, due to a chemisorption geometry that constrains the charge transfer through the non-conjugating PO3H2 groups.
The photoelectrochemical characteristics of 1/TiO2 electrodes, in ACN/0.1 M LiI, reflected the computational data, achieving an anodic photocurrent of ∼0.2 mA cm−2 with an IPCE of 3%, consistent with the poor reducing abilities of the lowest MLCT excited state of the dye. This limitation was circumvented by using SnO2, where much larger photocurrents and IPCE were observed, thanks to the increased charge injection driving force in the low lying SnO2 CB. The ability to photogenerate and transfer h+ to co-adsorbed WOC was also confirmed by the significantly enhanced photoanodic response in the presence of IrO2 NPs. Interestingly, the photocurrents on TiO2 substrates were largely increased, compared to ACN/LiI, in the presence of aqueous pH 3 sodium ascorbate, with photocurrents undergoing a three to five fold enhancement depending on the concentration of ascorbate, with the corresponding photon-to-current conversion between 7 and 10%; we have attributed this behavior to a modification in the charge injection mechanism. The anti-biomimetic pathway, confirmed by transient differential absorption spectra, allows for a more efficient electron transfer from 1− to the TiO2 CB, thanks to both a stronger reduction potential and a longer lifetime of the active state.
Besides the fact that non-ambiguous evidence for the excited state reductive quenching on TiO2 photoanodes was provided,43,44 the possibility of exploiting such a charge transfer pathway may result in some intriguing consequences, like the exploitation of sensitizer–catalyst ionic couples/assemblies where the high redox potential of the dye, necessary to activate the WOC, would impede injection of electrons from the excited state into the semiconductor. Thus the range of useful species for sensitization could be extended, resulting in the removal of some constraints for dye and device design for solar water splitting. Moreover, the anti-biomimetic pathway can be useful when the oxidized form of the dye can affect the stability of the functionalized electrode, a non-unusual case for DSSC (and DSPEC).

Stationary and time-resolved absorption/emission techniques
Stationary absorption spectra of complexes in solution have been recorded with a JASCO V-560 spectrophotometer, while for the complex 1 grafted onto semiconductor electrodes, they were recorded between 800 and 400 nm with a JASCO V-570 and a Varian Cary 300 spectrophotometer (bandwidth of 2 nm).
For steady-state luminescence measurements, a Jobin Yvon-Spex Fluoromax P spectrofluorimeter, equipped with a Hamamatsu R3896 photomultiplier, was used. The spectra were corrected for the photomultiplier response by using a program supplied with the fluorimeter. For the luminescence lifetimes, an Edinburgh OB 900 time-correlated single-photon-counting spectrometer was used. A Hamamatsu PLP 2 laser diode (59 ps pulse width at 408 nm) and/or nitrogen discharge (pulse width 2 ns at 337 nm) were employed as excitation sources.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed with a previously described apparatus,50 by using the 532 nm harmonic of a nanosecond Nd:YAG laser (Continuum Surelite II), with 1.3 kV of supply voltage. Thin films, under open circuit conditions, were oriented at an angle of ca. 45° with respect to the laser beam, defocusing with a plano concave lens and further attenuating with a 50% T neutral filter. Two 532 nm notch filters prevented laser light from reaching the photomultiplier, while a 420 nm cut-off filter and a 25% T neutral filter attenuated the white light probe beam, preventing a substantial excitation of the exposed semiconductor substrate. In order to obtain a suitable amplification of the oscilloscope traces, with a reasonably good S/N ratio, an oscilloscope input resistance of 50 Ω was used. Single wavelength transient traces were further improved by averaging 10 to 30 laser shots at a frequency of 0.2 Hz, imported on a PC and used to construct the transient absorption spectra by means of Origin 8.
Crystal structure determination and refinement
Suitable crystals of p1 were selected for X-ray analysis (Fig. S18†). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker APEX II equipped with a CCD area detector and utilizing Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. Data were collected and reduced using the SMART and SAINT software in the Bruker packages.51 The structures were solved by direct methods52 and then refined by least squares refinement on F2.53,54 The complete conditions of data collection and structure are given in Tables S1–S5.† All hydrogens were placed in calculated positions and refined as isotropic with the “riding-model technique”. The crystal structure is deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center, deposition number CCDC 1474484.
TDDFT calculations
Ground state equilibrium geometry of p1, pre-optimized at the semi-empirical PM6 level, was computed at the DFT B3LYP level by using a LANL2DZ basis set. TDDFT/LANL2DZ calculations in the presence of a solvent (ACN) described according to the continuum polarisable model (IEFCPM) afforded the ten lowest singlet vertical transitions. Structure and isodensity surface (isovalue = 0.004) generation was achieved with Gaussview 5 and Gausssum 2.2. Calculations were carried out with Gaussian 09 A.0255 by using a multiple core (2× Intel quad core I7 processors) 64 bit PC running under Linux. The Ti64O128 101 surface slab was optimized under vacuum at the Molecular Mechanics-Universal Force Field level (Table S8†).
Preparation of electrodes
FTO glass slides (10 × 8 cm2) were first cleaned by sonication in Alconox® solution (1 tablespoon in 250 ml of deionized water) for 10 minutes, followed by rinsing with water and further sonication in 2-propanol for 10 minutes. The slides were finally rinsed with EtOH and dried with warm air. In the case of TiO2 the semiconductor paste was blade cast onto the active area of the glass (10 × 3 cm2) and dried with a warm air stream before high temperature sintering. SnO2 electrodes were prepared by spin coating the paste at 600 rpm for 6 s followed by high speed spinning at 2000 rpm for 20 s and after each coating run, the film was sintered. The casting of two SnO2 layers produced the best photoelectrochemical performance.11 For both TiO2 and SnO2 the sintering temperature was set at 450 °C for 30 minutes. The slides were cut to obtain single photoanodes having the size of 4 × 1 cm2 with an active area of 1.5 cm2; these were directly used for sensitization with 1.
Electrodes were dipped in 8 × 10−5 M ACN fluid solution of 1, at 50 °C for a couple of hours till saturation of the respective surfaces. The functionalization of 1/SnO2 substrates, with an aqueous 2 × 10−3 M IrO2 nanoparticle (NP) solution, was performed with two different methods: spin coating 2 times (1000 rpm, 20 s, R.T.),11 and soaking for 15 minutes (R.T.).
Electrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry
Electrochemical measurements in solution were carried out in dry and Ar purged solvents (ACN or DMF) at room temperature with an Autolab multipurpose equipment interfaced to a PC. The working electrode was an Amel glassy carbon (0.08 cm2) electrode. The counter electrode was a Pt wire, and the pseudo-reference electrode was a silver wire. The reference was set using the redox couple ferrocene/ferrocenium at 395 mV vs. SCE in ACN (internal reference). The concentration in the analyte was about 1 mM, unless otherwise stated. 0.1 M TBAPF6 was used as the supporting electrolyte. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at scan rates between 50 and 500 mV s−1 and were stated in each case. The criteria for reversibility were the separation of 60 mV between cathodic and anodic peaks, the close to unity ratio of the intensities of the cathodic and anodic currents, and the constancy of the peak potential on changing the scan rate. Electrochemical measurements of sensitized electrodes were carried out on a PGSTAT 30 electrochemical workstation in a three electrode configuration using SCE as a reference and a Pt bead as a counter electrode. Cyclic voltammetry of 1 grafted onto TiO2 and SnO2 was performed in ACN/0.1 M LiClO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Photoelectrochemical experiments were performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 under AM 1.5 G illumination generated by a LOT-Oriel solar simulator equipped with a 420 nm cut-off filter, in order to prevent significant direct bandgap excitation of semiconductors. Different electrolytes were employed, containing sacrificial agents (ACN/LiI and aqueous pH 3 sodium ascorbate) at various concentrations (0.1 M, 0.25 M and 0.5 M) for the photoinjection tests. The measurements of 1/SnO2 decorated with IrO2 NPs were performed in aqueous pH 3 0.1 M NaClO4. J–V curves were collected by repeated cycling of the potential between 0.3 V vs. SCE (in sacrificial agent) or 0.5 V vs. SCE (in aqueous NaClO4) and the open circuit potential (Voc) until an overlapping response upon subsequent scan was achieved, indicating the attainment of a stationary state under illumination. Where indicated, the photocurrent density J was obtained by subtraction of the respective electrode dark current. J–V curves under shuttered illumination were acquired by manually chopping the excitation source.

 was measured in the same three electrode configuration, under the monochromatic illumination generated by an air cooled Luxtel 175 W Xe lamp coupled to an Applied Photophysics Ltd monochromator. The photocurrent, recorded at the constant potential of 0.3 V vs. SCE, was acquired on an Amel mod. 552 potentiostat, in ACN/LiI or aqueous pH 3 ascorbate at various concentrations. Incident irradiance was measured with a calibrated silicon photodiode.

The biomimetic definition here is based on the similarity of such a mechanism to the natural photosynthetic process, which is considered to be initiated by oxidative photoinduced electron transfer. The anti-biomimetic mechanism, as a consequence, follows an opposite scheme.

In such a system, the excited dendritic antenna is first reduced via photoinduced electron transfer by the molecular catalyst and then the reduced antenna is oxidized back to its ground state by the persulfate sacrificial acceptor. Iteration of the process allows the molecular catalyst to accumulate holes and finally evolve molecular oxygen from water.13.

E
ox is the ground state oxidation potential (Fig. 4), E0–0 is the zero-to-zero spectroscopic energy (in eV) that for MLCT emitters is usually approximated to the emission maximum at 77 K (Table 1).25 Other methods to derive the excited-state energy of MLCT states from experimental data are usually acceptable; one is assuming the excited-state energy of MLCT states as the energy value corresponding to the 10% intensity of the emission maximum at room temperature, on the blue edge of the emission spectrum. A small difference is obtained using the two methods, but it does not appreciably change the present discussion.
Obviously, the reduction potential of the TiO2 nanoparticles is not well defined; however a value of about −0.70 V vs. SCE can be considered with a fair confidence.37.

It is noteworthy that photoinduced electron injection was reported from a supramolecular dinuclear species where the photosensitizer (a Ru(II) polypyridine complex) was covalently-linked to an electron acceptor (a Rh(III) polypyridine subunit), in turn connected to TiO2 nanoparticles.43 In this system, photoexcitation of the Ru(II) chromophore led to electron transfer to the Rh(III) subunit, and the so-formed charge separated state injected, although with a low efficiency, an electron into the nanoparticles.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (Above) The structural formula of p1 and 1 and (below) the p12+ X-ray crystallographic structure (anions are omitted). Further X-ray crystallographic data are reported in the ESI.† Full details are deposited at Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, deposition CCDC 1474484.	 

 	Scheme 1  Quenching of the excited state of a charge transfer photosensitizer (P): in the biomimetic pathway (green arrows, numbers 1–2–3B–4B) the oxidation quenching takes place by electron transfer to the acceptor (A, in our case the semiconductor CB), followed by electron donation from the donor (D, the electrolyte or the water oxidation catalyst) restoring the photosensitizer to the initial situation. Instead in the anti-biomimetic pathway (red arrows, numbers 1–2–3A–4A) the sequence of electron transfer events is reversed.	 

 	Scheme 2  Synthetic pathway for the new compounds 1 and p1. (i) (dppf)PdCl2, toluene, NEt3, HP(OEt)2, 90 °C (yield 90%); (ii) (Tol-tpy)RuCl3, AgNO3, EtOH, reflux (yield 24%); (iii) 4 M HCl, reflux (yield 100%). dppf is 1,1-bis-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene; Tol-tpy is 4′-(p-tolyl)-2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine. The detailed procedures are reported in the Experimental section.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of 1 and p1 in acetonitrile solution. In the inset are shown the emission spectra of p1, both in an acetonitrile solution at room temperature and in a butyronitrile rigid matrix at 77 K.

 	Fig. 5  Averaged absorption spectra of the TiO2 electrodes with error bars calculated on a set of three equivalent electrodes sensitized with 1. (A) Before measurements, 1/TiO2 (red circles) in comparison with bare mesoporous TiO2 (black squares). (B) Bare TiO2 (black squares) compared with 1/TiO2 after a 10 minute measurement cycle in 0.1 M sodium ascorbate at pH 3 (red circles) and with 1/TiO2 after soaking and measurement in 0.1 M LiI in ACN (dark cyan circles). The absorbance of the bare TiO2 film immersed in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (dashed grey line) is also reported for reference.	 

 	Fig. 6  
J–V curves of TiO2 photoanodes in the presence of different electrolytes: (A) 1/TiO2 in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (red); 1/TiO2 in ACN/0.1 M LiI (dark cyan); bare TiO2 in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (grey); bare TiO2 in 0.1 M LiI (blue); (B) shuttered J–Vs of 1/TiO2 in the presence of increasing ascorbate concentrations, 0.1 M (black), 0.25 M (red) and 0.5 M (blue).	 

 	Fig. 7  (A) Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of TiO2 photoanodes in the presence of different electron donating electrolytes at 0 V vs. SCE: 1/TiO2 in the presence of different ascorbate concentrations (0.1–0.5 M, from black to blue); 1/TiO2 in 0.1 M LiI in ACN (dark cyan); blank TiO2 in 0.1 M ascorbate at pH 3 (grey); blank TiO2 in 0.1 M LiI in ACN (magenta). (B) Stern–Volmer plot of the emission lifetime quenching of 1 in acetonitrile upon ascorbate addition. The ascorbate quencher solution was prepared in water (pH 3), for solubility reasons. It is noteworthy that the addition of LiI to a solution 1 under analogous conditions does not cause any emission quenching.	 

 	Fig. 8  (A) J–V curves and (B) IPCE under 0.3 V vs. SCE potential bias of 1/SnO2 photoanodes evaluated in ACN solvent containing increasing concentrations of LiI (from 0.1 to 0.5 M).	 

 	Fig. 9  
J–V curves, in aqueous pH 3 0.1 M NaClO4, under continuous (A) and shuttered (B) illumination of 1/SnO2 in the presence of IrO2 catalytic nanoparticles. Two different methods for casting IrO2 particles on the photoanode were used: spin coating (SC, blue line) and soaking (S, black line).	 

 	Fig. 10  (A) Transient difference spectra of 1 in ACN solution upon 532 nm excitation; (B) excited state decay observed corresponding to the most intense transitions: 480 nm bleaching and 380 nm absorption.	 

 	Fig. 11  Transient difference spectra of 1 in the presence of ≈0.3 M sodium ascorbate in an ACN/water mixture: transient difference spectrum (A) at early delays (0–40 ns) and (C) at longer delays (50–400 ns), showing the achievement of a long lived state; (B) decay kinetics observed at 480 nm (bleaching) and at 380 nm (absorption); (D) transient difference spectrum recorded on ZrO2 at long delays (150 ns) in order to avoid interference from the excited state.

 	Fig. 13  (A) Transient spectrum of 1 loaded on TiO2 in the presence of an ACN/0.1 M Li+ electrolyte (0–50 ns delay); (B) kinetic traces observed at 600 and 400 nm, showing the formation of a long lived state assigned to Ru(III). At 600 nm the Ru(III) state has a negligible contribution and only the excited state decay is observed.
