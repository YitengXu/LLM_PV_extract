As a result, current research studies have focused on investigating new materials and implementing numerous fabrication approaches to increase the catalytic performances of electro/photocatalysts toward the CO2RR. MXenes, also known as 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, are intriguing materials with outstanding traits. Since their discovery in 2011, there has been a flurry of interest in MXenes in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, owing to their several benefits, including high mechanical strength, tunable structure, surface functionality, high specific surface area, and remarkable electrical conductivity. Herein, this review serves as a milestone for the most recent development of MXene-based catalysts for the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2RR. The overall structure of MXenes is described, followed by a summary of several synthesis pathways classified as top-down and bottom-up approaches, including HF-etching, in situ HF-formation, electrochemical etching, and halogen etching. Additionally, the state-of-the-art development in the field of both the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2RR is systematically reviewed. Surface termination modulation and heterostructure engineering of MXene-based electro/photocatalysts, and insights into the reaction mechanism for the comprehension of the structure–performance relationship from the CO2RR via density functional theory (DFT) have been underlined toward activity enhancement.

1. Introduction
Energy and environmental concerns have become egregious as a result of the enormous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the extravagant consumption of fossil fuels. In order to ameliorate environmental damage and gratify the expanding energy needs, there has been a surge of focus on transforming CO2 into CO, hydrocarbons, alcohols, and other critical raw materials that are the cornerstones of contemporary industries.1,2 Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a crucial technical approach for limiting the increase in worldwide temperature to less than 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels.3,4 This is in line with the Paris Agreement that was agreed upon by 196 Parties at the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in 2015.5
Catalysis, which transforms waste, pollutants, greenhouse gases, and water into value-added fuels and chemicals, is one of the most intriguing strategies that are able to incorporate the CCUS technology in achieving carbon neutrality.6 Typically, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis have aroused tremendous research interest toward renewable energy production, among which the catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has demonstrated its promising nature in not only manufacturing sustainable fuels but also mitigating the climate change. Nonetheless, the idea of employing abundant solar power to drive CO2 reduction is thought to be a game-changing and promising path for the sustainable growth of human society owing to its inherent natural profusion and eco-friendliness.7 Despite the significant research efforts involved, numerous pioneering designs of electro- and photocatalysts have been proposed in this particular field over the past few years.8–12
Countless catalysts such as TiO2, ZnO, and g-C3N4 have been investigated for the catalytic reduction of CO2 since the ground-breaking work on photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction undertaken by Inoue et al. in 1979.13,14 TiO2 has emerged as one of the most popular photocatalytic materials among them because of its exorbitant cost, excellent photostability, and environmental safety.15,16 Graphene oxides,17,18 carbon nanotubes,19,20 metal–organic frameworks,21,22 boron nitrides,23,24 transition metal-based or incorporated compounds (Bi, W, Cu, Mo, and Co),25–32 and transition metal carbides or nitrides (MXenes),33–35 are among other newly developed photocatalysts and electrocatalysts that have recently been used to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, despite the fact that many conventional TiO2-based photocatalysts have been extensively studied for CO2 reduction. Due to the distinct qualities, such as the hydrophilic nature, nontoxicity, redox reaction, notable surface area, enhanced mechanical strength, exceptional melting point, eco-friendly flexibility, remarkable electrical conductivity, and elevated biocompatibility, MXene-based nanocatalysts have drawn the most attention for a variety of energy and environmental applications.33,36
For decades, MXenes have been regarded as pristine ceramic materials, primarily for high-thermal activities and as cutters, as well as uses in functional composites, catalysts, and electrochemical energy storage.37 However, the strong interaction of carbon/nitrogen atoms in transition metals in all directions makes it challenging to reduce from pristine bulk 3D solids to nano-sized 2D or 1D geometry.37 In the midst of 2D materials, specific transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, categorized as MXenes (Ti3C2Tx), were first discovered in 2011 and experienced a commensurate increase in research, fabrication, and application over the last decade.38 For the first time, in 2011, Naguib et al. demonstrated that 2D titanium carbide (Ti3C2) was produced by merely immersing Ti3AlC2 in hydrofluoric acid (HF) at room temperature to selectively erode the Al layers.39 Since then, the discovery of MXene-based nanomaterials has been expanding rapidly in various research fields. In addition, they have also been widely employed in the catalysis field but are not limited to the electrochemical CO2RR due to their superior electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity.40,41 In the recent 6 years since 2016, tremendous research efforts have been devoted to this topic of interest on the CO2RR (Fig. 1a–c). To date, Heo et al. have recently conducted a review on the CO2RR via electro/photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, and hydrogenation along with the catalyst stability study.42 Nonetheless, their focal point is mainly concerned with Ti3C2-based electro/photocatalysts with a lack of diversities in transition metal selection. Besides, computational results are indispensable to consolidate their statements on experimental works. Another review published by Sreedhar and colleagues faced a similar issue to the aforementioned review paper, in which focus was placed merely on Ti3C2-based electro/photocatalysts, and in-depth computational analysis, especially the density functional theory (DFT) simulation study was lacking.35 In addition, the adopted catalyst systems mainly centered on conventional heterojunction engineering, where novel catalyst trends such as single-atom or diatomic catalysts were absent in the discussion. On top of that, a comprehensive review of the electrocatalytic applications of MXenes was carried out by Wang et al. Several applications like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and the CO2RR were discussed.43 However, an unitary discussion solely on electrocatalysis was inadequate to comprehend the catalytic performance of MXenes in other applications. Meanwhile, Li et al. reviewed the use of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) and carbide/nitride (MXene) catalysts in both the CO2RR and the NRR in 2021.33 Nevertheless, it can be observed that the number of papers published related to MXenes spiked up in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 1a and b). There are more studies showing the feasibility of MXene-based coupled heterostructures in the CO2RR such as Vs-CdS/Ti3C2,12 SnO2/MXene,44 Ru/Ti3CN/TiO2,45 Cu/Ti3C2Tx/g-C3N4,46 ZnCr-LDH/Ti3C2Tx47 and Cs2AgBiBr6/Ti3C2Tx.48 Therefore, to fully understand the structure–activity relationship of MXenes in heterojunctions, the necessity of a review that summarizes the recent studies is in urge.

Although there exist several published reviews on MXene-based catalysts so far, a literature review that provides a systematic summary of the recent synthesis strategies of MXene-based catalysts and simultaneously emphasizes the advances in MXene-based electrocatalysts and photocatalysts to drive the CO2RR in allusion to their different mechanisms is still scarce. In the urge to address this research gap, our review will highlight synthesis methods covering conventional to greener strategies and the potential of MXene-based catalysts in ameliorating the performance of the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2RR theoretically and experimentally. Besides, in terms of MXene-based catalysts, surface termination modulation and heterostructure engineering, specifically the incorporation of single-atom catalysts, will be spotlighted in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Nonetheless, insights into the reaction mechanism will be unraveled to understand the structure–activity relationship of the CO2RR, which is essential in moving forward to industrialization. We believe that this review will enlighten the future development of MXene-based electro/photocatalysts in the field of the CO2RR to achieve sustainable development and carbon neutrality.
Herein, in the wake to feature the recent development in MXene-based electrocatalysts and photocatalysts, this review provides an overview of contemporary advances of MXene-based catalysts toward the CO2RR (Fig. 2). The mechanism of the CO2RR has been widely reported by other research groups such as Li et al.33 and Liu et al.49 Seeing that this is a minireview, the present focus of our work will not include a specific section on the CO2RR mechanism. Therefore, the focus of our review is as follows. First of all, the structures, properties, and synthesis strategies of MXenes will be elucidated. Subsequently, recent breakthroughs in the area of the electro/photocatalytic CO2RR will be reviewed based on surface termination modulation and heterostructure engineering to decipher the synthesis–property–activity relationship. Last but not least, the future perspectives of MXene-based catalysts will be proposed together with a few feasible synergies.

2. Structure, properties, and synthesis of MXenes
The MXene family is comprised of transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitride with a general formula of Mn+1Xn or Mn+1XnTx (n = 1, 2, 3), where M is an early d-block transition metal including Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn and Y. The open d orbitals in the transition metal M usually endow the MXenes with appealing properties. Therefore, researchers are putting effort into exploring all kinds of possibilities either through theoretical calculations or experimental approaches.63 For instance, Meshkian et al. used DFT calculations to predict the phase stability of quaternary i-MAX phases and found two new W-based i-MAX phases (W2/3Sc1/3)2AlC and (W2/3Y1/3)2AlC with monoclinic C2/c structures that were stable, followed by experimentally proving their existence and catalytic activity.64 The modification using different metal species can induce significant changes in the catalytic properties of the MXenes. At the same time, X represents either a carbon or a nitrogen atom and Tx stands for the terminating functional group on the surface.65 The terminating functional groups include F, Cl, O, OH, and so forth, with the most common situation being a mixture of them.66 The type of terminating functional group depends on the synthesis methods of MXene, which can adjust the conductivity, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties.67 Generally, a higher value of n signifies MXene with high stability and determines the thickness of the 2D MXene layers.65,68 Besides the mono-transition-metal MXenes, there is another class of MXenes known as ordered double-transition-metal MXenes, which are comprised of two distinct transition metals.37,69,70 Recently, some of the ordered double-transition-metal MXene structures such as Mo2ScC2, TiMn2N271 and TiNbC have been experimentally realized or theoretically predicted. These MXenes exist in a unique structure with both the inner layer of transition metals sandwiched by the outer layers of transition metals.71 Thus, this unique structure provides a new route to tune the properties of MXenes. Owing to the 2D architecture of the MXene layer, the migration distance for charge will be minimized, thus facilitating charge separation and transfer. Besides, a larger surface area of 2D MXenes ensures the exposure of abundant active sites for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Although electrocatalysis and photocatalysis have common ground in their applications for a wide range of energy conversion reactions and pollution degradation reactions, the selection of materials favorable for electro/photocatalytic mechanisms depends on a good deal of properties of these materials. There are three steps for photocatalysis to kick start a reaction: light absorption, excitation of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), and charge migration to the surface for the catalytic reaction.72 As for the electrocatalyst, it is used to accelerate a reaction by improving charge transfer at the electrode–electrolyte interface while reducing the reaction activation energy and providing more active sites.73,74 What distinguishes them is that the photocatalyst is solar-driven, whereas the electrocatalyst is powered by electricity, and the selection of electrolyte and membrane in the electrochemical system plays a dominant role in shaping the catalytic performance. In this regard, the goals of developing suitable materials are slightly different. Photocatalyst tends to underline the light absorption capacity of the material, especially tapping their potential in the visible light region, whereas more efforts are devoted to improving the electrical conductivity of the material for electrocatalysis, which is desirable to provide a catalytic reaction with satisfactory kinetics. To this end, MXenes have become a magnet in investigating their potential in the arenas of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. For instance, the high conductivity of MXenes undoubtedly renders them overwhelming in the field of electrocatalysis.75,76 Meanwhile, it has also been frequently reported as an electron reservoir to trap and shuttle the photogenerated electrons from coupled semiconductors during photocatalysis, thus boosting the charge separation and transfer in MXene-based composites for the CO2RR.57,77,78
Conventionally, MXenes are prepared by selectively etching the A layer consisting of main sp elements (groups 13 and 14) from the original three-dimensional (3D) MAX phases. Other novel synthesis methods include the hydrothermal approach, solvothermal approach, calcination method, ion exchange process, self-assembly method, and sol–gel method, and are adopted in multiple fields such as energy storage79 and environment-related applications.80 MAX are layered hexagonal with P63/mmc symmetric, in which M layers are closely stacked while X atoms occupy the octahedral sites, and thus it can be regarded that A elements glued the 2D MXene layers, which interleave with layers of A elements.81 Theoretically, the composition and surface properties of MXenes will vary with different synthesis approaches. It is noted that the chemically terminated or functionalized surface functional groups are prevalent in regulating the features of MXenes and significantly impact the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of MXenes.82,83 This will allow us to tailor the structure of MXenes and endow them with preferable activity for remarkable electro/photocatalytic performance toward the CO2RR. In some cases, pristine MXenes have the metallic nature stemming from the additional Fermi energy at d orbitals contributed by the transition metal M, but upon functionalization, MXenes would exhibit semiconducting properties.65 This phenomenon is closely related to the bandgap changes of the MXenes. The bandgap structure of MXenes is essential in the application of catalysis, which varies in the range of 0.05 to 3.49 eV, and can also be modulated by surface termination groups.75,84 For example, unterminated TiMn2N2 MXenes possessed a metallic nature, while a large bandgap of 1.1 eV (DFT + U) or 1.9 eV (HSE06) was generated after adding MXene F termination, demonstrating their semiconducting nature. Apart from that, adding surface termination, particularly –OH or –O termination, also ameliorates the hydrophilic properties of MXenes.85
Apart from taking advantage of MXenes to make manifold electro/photocatalysts derived from MXenes, researchers are also committed to exploring more facile and effective synthesis routes to fabricate MXenes. Unlike graphite and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with weak van der Waal interactions existing within the layers, M–X in MXenes is firmly bonded, and the M–A bond exhibiting the metallic nature is relatively weaker.86 Therefore, layers are difficult to be separated from the MAX phase by mechanical exfoliation or direct dispersion and ultrasonication, but A layers are able to be easily removed from the MAX phase by chemical means without sabotaging M–X bonds to generate Mn+1XnTx.87 Thus far, MXenes fabricated from the wet-chemical etching of the parent MAX phase in hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution have been widely reported and regarded as the most effective method. This is also known as the top-down method, involving the breaking of bulk materials into nanosized structures.88,89 According to a pioneering work by Gogotsi et al., Ti3AlC2 powders were immersed in HF solution for 2 h to obtain exfoliated 2D Ti3C2 layers, which possessed terminated –OH and/or –F on the surface.39 In this process, the Al atoms were replaced by –OH, which made the interaction between the Mn+1Xn layer weaker and induced facile separation of Al layers, followed by breakage of hydrogen bonds and separation of nanosheets via sonication in methanol (Fig. 3a). The typical formation process is indicated using the following reactions (eqn (1)–(3)): Ti3AlC2 + 3HF → AlF3 + 1.5H2 + Ti3C2(1) Ti3C2 + 2H2O → Ti3C2(OH)2 + H2(2) Ti3C2 + 2HF → Ti3C2F2 + H2(3)

Under most of the synthesis process, the basal plane of the MXenes will be functionalized and grafted with terminal groups (Tx) (e.g. O, OH, F).75,90 The tunable electronic properties of MXenes are related to the surface properties as it is the interface where active metals or reaction intermediates react into products. The termination groups significantly influence the electrocatalytic activity of MXene catalysts. It is impossible to produce bare MXenes without surface termination due to the use of fluorine-based etchants. Recently it has been reported that through specific synthesis processes such as chemical treatment, thermal annealing and mechanical exfoliation process, specific terminations are produced.91 The termination groups could be one or with some combinations of F, OH, O and other terminations. As some of the termination groups such as OH are not stable and tend to convert into O terminations at high temperatures. Generally, terminations will be available in three choices of symmetry sides including fcc, hcp, and top sites. Seh and co-workers reported the stability of –O and –OH functional groups in MXenes.55 Additionally, MXenes with different M (d-block transition metals) prefer different sites, where Cr–Mo and W-based MXenes prefer the hcp site, while in contrast Sc-, Ti-, V-, Zr- and Hf-based materials favor the fcc site. There are more possible configurations that can be generated, however, theoretically, the three common sites mentioned above are energetically stable. Experimental determination of surface terminating groups especially at the atomic scale level is undeniably a challenge due to the composition and complexity of the structures. DFT calculations unveiled the preferred surface termination groups of MXenes. For instance, Ashton et al. utilized DFT calculations to study the relationship between thermodynamic stability and various surface termination groups.92 Eid et al. investigated surface termination group enhancement on the adsorption of reactants during the CO2RR.93 Besides that, the adsorption behaviors and the structural transformation of the as-synthesized Cu/Ti3C2Tx with different Tx (F, O and OH) components were investigated and optimized via DFT. In spite of this, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are also effective tools to indicate the surface terminating groups.94,95 For instance, Hope et al. identified and quantified the –OH and –F surface terminations on Ti3C2Tx using NMR.96 It is noteworthy that the surface terminations are highly sensitive to the synthesis method. To achieve a more accurate determination and quantification of the surface termination groups and their effect on the catalytic performances, a detailed understanding and advanced simulation techniques investigating the synthesis, stability and activity, as well as a large number of different compositions of surface terminations in MXenes, are required.
However, concentrated HF is highly corrosive and toxic, potentially threatening laboratory safety and human health, and further impeding future commercialization. As such, the in situ HF-forming etching method is developed to overcome this issue, whereby fluoride salts (LiF, KF, or NaF) will be mixed with an acid (HCl) to form an etchant.95,97 For instance, Wang et al. reported a novel Co(OH)2F@MXene catalyst, where Ti3AlC2 was etched using an in situ HF-forming etchant that was prepared by mixing 0.8 g of LiF and 20 mL of 9 M HCl, followed by immersing 0.5 g of pure Ti3AlC2 and stirring for 24 h to obtain MXenes.98 Moreover, a strategy of the solution-free molten fluoride method was first unveiled by Urbankowski et al. through selective etching of MAX in the molten fluoride salt to remove Al from a Ti4AlN3 precursor to synthesize Ti4N3Tx.99 In this process, Ti4AlN3 powder was mixed with a fluoride salt mixture containing 59 wt% of KF, 29 wt% of LiF, and 12 wt% of NaF, followed by heating at 550 °C for 30 min under an Ar atmosphere in an alumina crucible (Fig. 3b). This synthesis route successfully eliminated the direct usage of HF solutions. Similarly, a greener synthesis route was also developed by Sarfraz et al., in which a Cl-terminated MXene was synthesized from the Ti3AlC2 MAX phase via thermally reacting with a CuCl2 salt at a high temperature in an inert environment, to successfully get rid of the HF.100
Importantly, etching conditions, including the HF concentration, etching temperature, and etching time, significantly influence the formation and properties of MXenes by adjusting the defects and surface terminations.101,102 For example, a higher HF concentration (direct 48% HF etching) resulted in more –F surface terminations when compared with the amount of –O or –OH termination on Ti3AlC2, while a lower HF concentration (in situ HF-forming) produced Ti3AlC2 with more –O terminations (Fig. 3c).96 Other than that, the etching temperature will play an imperative role in tuning the functional groups on the surface of MXenes. Kumar et al. applied an etching reagent of concentrated 12 M HCl/LiF for Ti3AlC2 to obtain MXenes.103 This process was operated at elevated etching temperatures to assist the etching of the MAX phase and the exfoliation of MXene layers, but more oxygen-based functional groups were formed when increasing the temperature to 80 °C. The oxygen-based functional groups will influence the electrochemical properties since it reduces the electrode surface conductivity, thereby hindering electron migration.104 Moreover, in terms of the HF etching time, researchers have also found that when increasing the HF etching time at room temperature, the continuous removal of Al in Ti3AlC2 powder resulted in further delamination and rendered the stacked sheets thinner, and simultaneously, the interlayer spacing of Ti3C2Tx MXenes was increased dramatically (Fig. 3d).105
Furthermore, the fluoride-free etching method is also of great concern. An improvement in this aspect can be achieved by the electrochemical etching route. Pang et al. reported an HF-free facile and rapid synthesis of 2D Ti2CTxvia thermal-assisted electrochemically etching (E-etching), where MAX materials were E-etched with a 3D composite electrode of the carbon black additive and the carbon fiber cloth (CFC) porous substrate in the presence of a HCl etchant, and mild heating accelerated the etching on MAX phases.106 In this system, the over-etching issue was prevented by applying an etching voltage of 0.3 V vs. RHE so that the Al atoms can be removed from Ti2AlC selectively. Additionally, the boundary of research was further extended to prepare Cr2CTx and V2CTx, which verified the university of the applied methods for synthesizing diverse MXenes. Similarly, the elimination of using fluoride-based etchants was also achieved by Sun et al., who reported a fluoride-free partial conversion of Ti2AlC into Ti2CTx MXenes via electrochemical etching in the diluted HCl aqueous electrolyte.107 By investigating the growth mechanism, this study reemphasized that the etching parameters (i.e., etching time, voltage, and electrolyte concentration) should be appropriately balanced to prevent over-etching of MAX to carbide-derived carbon. Other than utilizing the HCl etching method, a halogen etching approach was proposed by Jawaid et al., where halogens (Br2, I2, ICl, and IBr) in anhydrous media were applied to produce MXenes (Ti3C2Xn, X = Br and I) from TiAlC2.108 Different halogens were mixed with the TiAlC2 MAX phase in a molar ratio of 2:1 (Al/X = 1:4), followed by stirring the slurry, centrifugation and purification, and dispersion (Fig. 3e). This method was proved to be tunable across a wide range of MAX compositions, ascribed to the isostructural MAX phase bonding and the tunability of the halogen selectivity depending on the molar ratio of the halogen to the MAX phase, absolute concentration, solvent, and temperature.
Apart from top-down methods of etching in chemical solutions, bottom-up strategies such as the hydrothermal method and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approaches are of particular interest as well due to the facile formation of well-defined surfaces and a clear chemical formula.109–111 The bottom-up strategy can be used to directly synthesize MXenes without deriving from the MAX precursor. In this case, a more precise regulation of the designable MXene structures will be fabricated.89 For example, Jeon et al. synthesized a 2D Mo2C MXene material by converting it from the MoS2 sample in a low-pressure CVD system, where MoS2 was completely converted to Mo2C at 820 °C over 4 h under the environment of 100 sccm CH4, 5 sccm H2, and 100 sccm Ar in a furnace.112 The conversion of Mo2C was initiated at the edge of MoS2 and underwent sequential hydrodesulfurization and carbide conversion. A similar template method was applied by Jia et al. to prepare uniform and ultrathin N-doped Mo2C nanosheets (N-Mo2C NSs), where MoO2 nanosheets were used as templates and Mo sources.113 The N-Mo2C NSs featured a single-crystal structure and an ultrathin thickness of around 1.0 nm. As a result, the as-prepared catalyst exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of only 99 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4. Besides, Zhao et al. fabricated α-Mo2C by employing a micro-plasma CVD (MPCVD) process that possessed merits of high power density, high particle activity, and controllable parameters.114 In this synthesis route, Mo foil was employed as a substrate and CH4/H2 was used as the source gas. The optimal growth parameter to ensure the dominant phase of α-Mo2C in the as-synthesized material was 6 hours. Recently, bottom-up approaches have become more appealing and they have been widely employed in the construction of 2D MXenes. These methods fabricate MXene nanosheets with controlled thickness and a well-designed morphology. However, some issues such as scalability and limitation on the final size of the deposited materials exist due to the usage of vacuum chambers and substrates for growth.89,115 Finally, a summary table regarding the synthesis routes of various MXenes is provided in Table 1.

Overall, fluoride-based etching and top-down methods are still the prevailing strategies to synthesize MXene-based catalysts. Despite the tremendous effort that has been devoted to developing the fluoride-free etching method and top-down method, relevant research studies are still limited. More investigations are encouraged in this aspect to explore more possibilities lying behind, further contributing to high-performance MXene-based electro/photocatalysts by dedicatedly designing the synthesis process. To move forward, developing a greener solvent for the synthesis of MXene-based catalysts will be the next step toward a more sustainable future, further benefiting the scaling-up production because they are environmentally friendly to minimize the environmental impact resulting from the use of solvents in the chemical industry. For example, deep eutectic solvents (DESs), a new class of ionic liquid analogs, have low toxicity, low vapor pressure, and nonflammability.116,117 DESs can dissolve most metallic compounds because of their solvent effect, thus enabling the dissolution of the A group element in the MAX phase in this versatile dispersion medium.118 Kim et al. have demonstrated that DESs were efficient intercalation agents to enhance the delamination of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets while acting as an anti-oxidative dispersion medium to prevent the oxidation of nanosheets both in solution and dried states, which is a safer and easier way.119 As a result, the modified T3C2Tx exhibited better chemical stability and performance in the application of electrodes for electrochemical capacitors when compared with pristine Ti3C2Tx.76
3. MXenes in the catalytic CO2 reduction reaction
When utilizing MXenes for the electrocatalytic CO2RR, there must be strong electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption characteristics because electricity is the only driving force for the reaction. In a cathodic half-reaction, CO2 is reduced to value-added chemicals by consuming electrons (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, MXenes are electrocatalytically inert, and eventually, they have to be hybridized with external active components acting as active sites. Relevant structural designs toward the efficient electrocatalytic CO2RR are covered in section 3.1. Contrarily, the photocatalytic CO2RR relies on photoexcited electrons from semiconductors to activate the reaction. The intended CO2 reduction half-reaction must be driven thermodynamically by the energy of the conduction band minimum (CBM) for the effective photo-driven CO2RR (Fig. 4b). Since most MXenes are not photoactive, they are typically coupled with other photoactive compounds for the CO2RR, which are discussed in section 3.2. There are various works discussing the merits of MXenes in the catalytic CO2RR. For instance, Guo et al. revealed that M2C-type MXenes possess outstanding CO2 adsorption abilities due to the surface lone pair electrons of MXenes that can be depicted via the effective charge numbers of their transition metal atoms.139

3.1. Electrocatalytic CO2RR by MXene-based electrocatalysts
MXene, an emerging graphene-like 2D layered nanomaterial with remarkable electrical conductivity, large exposed surface area, and prolonged stability, has opened up a new horizon in the field of the electrocatalytic CO2RR. However, research into this particular realm is still in its early infancy, and innovative designs of MXene-based electrocatalysts are scarce. Up to this point, 2D MXenes tailored by functional group terminations and single-atom catalysts (SACs) immobilized on the 2D surface are currently highly promising due to their extraordinary intrinsic activity and synergistic effects within the heterostructured structure toward the electrocatalytic CO2RR. Thus, in this section, several catalyst designs that are mainly associated with surface termination modulation and heterostructure engineering (focusing on SAC incorporation), as well as corresponding structure–activity relationships of MXene-based electrocatalysts, are reviewed to carve a path for future research in the electrocatalytic CO2RR.
Initially, MXenes have been thoroughly explored with the aid of computational simulations for the electrocatalytic CO2RR by many researchers. Li et al. have already revealed that MXenes containing IV, V, and VI groups of transition metals with the formula of M3C2 were able to selectively convert CO2 to value-added CH4, among which Cr3C2 and Mo3C2 possessed the most outstanding CO2RR activity, with 1.05 and 1.31 eV of energy input required to achieve the methanation reaction, respectively.56 Additionally, reduced energy requirements of 0.35 and 0.54 eV were achieved when the two MXenes were terminated with –O and –OH functional groups, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). Hence, the introduction of termination groups has inspired the idea of enhancing the CO2RR activity on MXenes. Besides, in another study conducted by Handoko and coworkers via DFT simulations, W2CO2 and Ti2NO2 among nineteen types of M2XO2 have been evidenced to be highly active toward the CO2RR process, which exhibited a good selectivity and low overpotential of 0.52 and 0.69 V, respectively.140 This was ascribed to the presence of –O termination, stabilizing the reaction intermediates, and endorsing the more preferable *HCOOH route in the CO2RR instead of the *CO pathway (Fig. 5c). Similarly, Chen et al. have also proposed the innovative idea of defect engineering via introducing transition metal (Hf) and C or N atom vacancies on another MXene in the M2XO2 group, Hf2NO2, with –O termination, followed by modelling simulation on its CO2RR performance.141 They discovered that vacancies induced an electronic structure change, and further improved the CO2RR performance with a low overpotential of merely 0.45 V. Apart from –O termination, Chen et al. have reported another two –OH terminated MXenes, Sc2C(OH)2 and Y2C(OH)2, to efficiently catalyze the CO2RR process from CO2 to CH4 with low potentials of 0.53 and 0.61 V, respectively.142 In this case, H atoms existing in the –OH termination played a significant role in the formation of stable intermediates and reduction in the overpotential. In addition to the incorporation of pure surface termination, Li and coworkers have recently proposed the design of mixed functional groups containing –O and –S on Ti2C (OOS) to anchor Cr single-atoms by substituting O atoms with S atoms.143 The basic mechanism of the CO2RR behind such a structure is driven by the synergistic effects of both functional groups, where the –O terminations facilitate the adsorption reaction of CO2, while the –S terminations benefit the CO2 reduction pathways. Their ab initio calculations indicated that the as-obtained Cr@OOS contributed to a limiting potential (UL) of −0.44 V for *H2COOH.

Recently, 0D single-atom catalysts (SACs) immobilized on 2D MXenes have attracted tremendous research interest in the electrocatalytic CO2RR owing to their unique geometric and electronic structures, subsequently forming electrocatalytic heterostructures with a 0D/2D morphology.144 In general, Cu atoms anchored on MXenes have been proven to be highly promising toward the CO2RR. The 2D MXene supporting material within the heterostructures has garnered vast attention due to its good electrical conductivity, stability, as well as compatibility in aiding electrostatically adsorbing metal precursors.12,145 Recently, Zhao et al. have successfully developed Cu single-atoms (SAs) loaded on the outermost Ti layers of Cl-terminated MXenes (Ti3C2Clx) via selective etching of the quaternary MAX phase precursor (Ti3(Al1−xCux)C2) containing Al and Cu (Fig. 6a).146 The as-synthesized SA-Cu-MXene (Fig. 6b) for the CO2RR toward CH3OH formation demonstrated prolonged durability for 30 h and impressive Faradaic efficiency above 58% (Fig. 6c). Such excellent stability was ascribed to their well-protected electroreduction environment from −1.0 to −1.8 V, contributing to the good preservation of its intrinsic 2D morphology as well as the isolated dispersion of Cu SACs. DFT simulations further substantiated that the atomically dispersed Cu single-atoms acting as active sites were characterized by unsaturated electronic structures and contributed to the reduced energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) (conversion of *HCOOH to *CHO), boosting the CO2RR activity. This was significantly advantageous compared to the reference Cu-particle-MXene. In this case, one of the crucial roles that the MXene played within the heterostructure was to preserve and simultaneously immobilize the as-synthesized Cu SACs with superior activities than the Cu particles. Similarly, Zhao et al. have synthesized Pt1/Ti3−xC2Tyvia selective etching, where Pt atoms occupied the Ti-deficit defect sites in the MXene layered structure and bonded with adjacent C atoms (Fig. 6d).59 It demonstrated nearly 100% conversion and selectivity of catalytic N-formylation of CO2 and aniline under ambient pressure, which outperformed those of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) in terms of reduced energy profiles (Fig. 6e). It is also noteworthy that vacancy defects are present in the MXene sheets after etching and they are the ideal sites for integrating and stabilizing the yielded single metal atoms.145,147 Additionally, they further confirmed the feasibility of such a synthesis strategy for fabricating Ti3−xC2Ty embedded with other highly dispersed single metallic atoms, including Ru, Ir, Rh, and Pd. Based on recent literature reviews, it is evident that SACs on MXenes have become emerging topics in the electrocatalytic CO2RR attributed to their efficient utilization of coupling catalyst atoms. As revealed by numerous existing experimental and computational works, it is obvious that SACs have exhibited greater electrocatalytic activities and thus are more favored compared to their nanoparticle counterpart due to their intrinsic highly unsaturated coordination nature and the subsequent ameliorated reaction energy barriers.59 Thanks to the presence of the MXene layer, the active catalysts in a single-atom morphology could be well maintained under electrochemical measurement conditions. Exploration and development of more SAC candidates as well as innovative and facile synthesis strategies are in high demand to fabricate highly active, cost-effective, and stable electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2RR.

Apart from SACs on MXenes, other categories of materials have also been proposed to be coupled with MXenes for the electrocatalytic CO2RR, such as metal oxides, in spite of the paucity of relevant research studies. Kannan et al. presented the design of a ZnO-Fe-MXene via a hydrothermal synthesis strategy, which could drive a current density of −18 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V to generate formate.148 The assistance of ZnO in enhancing CO2 adsorption and the aid of Fe in boosting charge transfer and suppressing the HER could synergistically promote the CO2RR activity. Besides, the MXene layer is vital to ensuring superb electron–proton coupling transport during the CO2RR process. Unfortunately, the stability study on this particular structure was not thoroughly conducted, which is one of the critical parameters to be considered for MXene-based electrocatalysts. As for now, although there is still a lack of research into metal oxides as well as other types of metal-based materials incorporated with MXenes toward the electrocatalytic CO2RR, this work sheds light on the feasibility of such heterostructure design and would enlighten future research studies in this particular direction.
In order to further drive innovation in MXene-based electrocatalysts toward the CO2RR, Table 2 below shows some state-of-the-art MXene-based electrocatalysts in terms of their dimensions, synthesis strategies, electrocatalytic activities/performances, working electrolytes, as well as ultimate CO2RR products. As a whole, it has been evidenced that MXene-based electrocatalysts will be blessed with remarkable catalytic activities toward the CO2RR via the application of surface termination modulation and heterostructure engineering. Unfortunately, the majority of works merely remain at the theoretical level, which only provides limited information related to Gibbs free energy and limiting potential. Despite the fact that numerous transition metal alternatives in the MXene structure, including but not limited to Nb, Sc, and W, have been unraveled conceptually apart from the conventional Ti or Mo, more in-depth experimental studies are supposed to be carried out to highlight the Faradaic efficiencies of electrocatalysts toward particular products, as well as buttress their computational analysis.

3.2. Photocatalytic CO2RR by MXene-based photocatalysts
MXenes have been deliberated broadly and used in a variety of applications in photocatalysis, including energy generation, energy storage and environmental remediation.161 In terms of energy generation application, most of the studies on MXene-based photocatalysts were based on the HER,162–166 but limited studies were based on the CO2RR. However, the CO2RR process is now attracting significant attention worldwide to resolve the greenhouse gases issue with Nature Catalysis superadded their focus on CO2 reimagined on 18th November 2021 to further the underlying research and practical application of this technology to achieve climate goals in commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, which highlighted the importance of the CO2RR in the catalysis research area.167–173
As a “sourdough” semiconductor in photocatalysis, TiO2 has always been employed as the fundamental material to form a heterojunction with another semiconductor.174,175 For instance, TiO2 nanoparticles were loaded onto MXene Ti3C2 nanosheets by Low et al. to establish a 0D/2D heterostructure using an in situ growth calcination technique (Fig. 7a).78 Ti3C2 exhibited great visible light absorption ability owing to its black color, which was portrayed as a photosensitizer that resolved the shortcoming of TiO2 in low light harvesting. Therefore, a lower amount of TiO2 NPs loaded onto the 2D Ti3C2 caused higher light absorption efficiency due to the larger surface exposure of Ti3C2 NSs to light. However, fewer TiO2 NPs led to fewer photogenerated electrons as they acted as the electron donor (Fig. 7b). Thus, the trade-off between the amount of TiO2 and light absorption rate had to be precisely tuned to attain a high CO2RR rate. Apart from the binary heterostructure, there were numerous works studied on the ternary heterostructure. An exciting work was presented by Tang et al. regarding the synthesis of Ru/Ti3CN/TiO2via the in situ hydrothermal growth method (Fig. 7c and d).45 The study revealed that the increment of the hydrothermal treatment time from 4 h to 20 h led to lower product generation from 9.10 to 2.08 μmol g−1 h−1 (CO) and 0.22 to 0.13 μmol g−1 h−1 (CH4), respectively. This was ascribed to the lengthy hydrothermal treatment for 20 h, causing Ti3CN to over-oxidize and subsequently throwing off the equilibrium between the Ti3CN MXene and TiO2. Moreover, when 0.5% Ru was added to Ti3CN/TiO2, the CO and CH4 production was increased to 19.82 and 1.79 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively. Nonetheless, Wu et al. designed a unique M-scheme heterostructure consisting of Ti3C2 NSs as cocatalysts between CeO2 NPs and TiO2 NPs (CeO2/Ti3C2/TiO2) via a two-step hydrothermal with calcination approach (Fig. 7e).176 The dual heterojunction was confirmed by both theoretical and experimental analyses (Fig. 7f). Ti3C2 NSs acted as electron collectors that effectively prevented charge recombination in CeO2 NPs and TiO2 NPs, allowing the preserved charge carriers to carry out the photo-redox reaction. Meanwhile, when the reaction temperature increased from 25 °C to 50 °C, the selectivity of CH4 was further enhanced from 70.68% to 75.26% (Fig. 7g), indicating that Ti3C2 is susceptible to heat and its catalytic performance is limited in a low temperature ambience.

Conjointly, metal oxides as one of the most abundant materials on Earth are over and above suitable to be used as semiconductors toward the photocatalytic CO2RR. It is undeniable that metal is a predominant factor in the journey of expanding the photocatalysis research area. Therefore, it is crucial for us to employ Earth-abundant transition metals rather than noble metals in designing photocatalysts for large-scale applications. In essence, through electrostatic self-assembly, Zeng et al. combined 0D Ti3C2 and 1D Cu2O-Cu (Fig. 8a).58 Using DFT calculations, the density of states of Ti3C2 QDs reflected that many electronic states crossed the Fermi level (Fig. 8b), indicating that Ti3C2 QDs have exceptional conductivity, which is advantageous for electron transfer. Likewise, the photocurrent of Ti3C2 QDs/Cu2O-Cu NWs was the highest as compared to Ti3C2 NSs/Cu2O-Cu NWs and Cu2O-Cu NWs, owing to better light absorption, prevented charge separation, and accelerated charge transfer provided by Ti3C2 QDs (Fig. 8c). Nonetheless, the efficiency of the photocatalyst for the CO2RR was greatly influenced by its capacity for CO2 adsorption. Therefore, Cao et al. provided the possibility of ternary metal oxides in combining with MXenes, and constructed 2D/2D Ti3C2/Bi2WO6via a hydrothermal strategy for robust CO2RR performance.57 From Fig. 8d, the TB2 (2% mass ratio of Ti3C2 to Bi2WO6) curve was far more capable of adsorbing CO2 than the other samples. In particular, in the low-pressure range, the curve of TB2 increased much faster than the others, which was explained by the presence of micropores. Nonetheless, Wang et al. prepared 2D/2D Bi2O2SiO3/Ti3C2via a wet chemical reduction method.177 From DFT analysis to understand the photocatalytic mechanism, Bi2O2SiO3 and Ti3C2 were found to possess work functions of 4.91 and 5.29 eV, respectively (Fig. 8e and f). As their Fermi energies approached the same level at the interface of Bi2O2SiO3 and Ti3C2, the energy bands of the two materials bent in opposite directions with the energy band of Bi2O2SiO3 bending upward and the energy band of Ti3C2 bending downward.

With this exception, to obtain less expensive photocatalysts to pave the path for large-scale applications, metal-free semiconductors like g-C3N4 have often been used in designing heterostructure photocatalysts owing to their enormous photocatalytic behavior.179,180 This strategy was adopted in MXene-based photocatalysts as well, where Hu et al. successfully constructed a 2D/2D Ti3C2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst system via self-assembly electrostatic attractions.181 Ti3C2 NSs were adopted as electron collectors in this study, which not only aided charge transfer but also conceived an electron-rich environment on the surface of 2D Ti3C2, thereby endorsing the multi-electron CO2RR (Fig. 9a). The charge transfer mechanism was proven in the Mott–Schottky (MS) plot, where the CB of g-C3N4 NSs was more negative than that of the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite, implying that the photo-induced electrons were migrated from the CB of g-C3N4 NSs to the CB of Ti3C2 NSs. Likewise, Yang et al. with a similar system manifested that 2D Ti3C2 remarkably constrained the charge recombination in g-C3N4 NSs, as the Ti3C2/g-C3N4 composite had lower photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and therefore, immensely boosted the CO2RR efficiency of pristine g-C3N4 by 8.1-fold in CO evolution.182 On the other hand, He et al. proposed a ternary S-scheme heterostructure system of 2D/2D/0D TiO2/C3N4/Ti3C2.60 The charge separation efficiency of the photocatalysts had been enhanced by adopting the S-scheme mechanism and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of DMPO-˙OH in an aqueous dispersion was used to verify the S-scheme mechanism. In brief, the combination of MXenes, especially Ti3C2, with other metal-free semiconductors like g-C3N4 can greatly enhance the photocatalytic performance, due to the synergistic effects of preventing charge recombination, enhancing the light absorption rate, and loading of Ti3C2 QDs which can provide more active sites with high redox potential charge carriers for the photocatalytic CO2RR.

Using mutual electrostatic attractions, Zhang et al. recently self-assembled a heterostructure of lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals (NCs) on MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets.48 The electron consumption yield of Cs2AgBiBr6/Ti3C2Tx heterostructures was determined to be 50.6 μmol g−1 h−1 with apparent quantum yields (AQYs) of 0.083%, 0.071%, and 0.005% at 485, 535 and 595 nm, respectively, which was about 98.4% and 148.0% higher as compared to pristine Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, respectively (Fig. 9b). The result unveiled that Ti3C2Tx nanosheets were able to quickly dislodge photogenerated electrons from the Cs2AgBiBr6 conduction band when exposed to visible light. These photogenerated electrons in Ti3C2Tx nanosheets subsequently mostly converted the water molecules into H2 and CH4 by devouring them. Other than that, when Co–Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) was coupled with Ti3C2Tx nanosheets to form Co–Co-LDH/TNS nanoarrays, Chen et al. posed a massive spike in the CO2-to-CO evolving rate (12500 μmol g−1 h−1) with the aid of Ru-based photosensitizers, which had outstanding stability (>25 h, 5 cycles) and a high AQY (0.92%).183 Furthermore, other works using LDH such as 2D/2D NiAl-LDH/Ti3C2 by Shi et al.184 and 2D/2D ZnCr-LDH/Ti3C2Tx by Zhou et al.47 were found to divulge superb CO2RR capability with CO selectivities of 92% and 86%, respectively, which were much higher than those in the aforementioned works. All the robust performances from LDH-incorporated systems are largely attributed to the compositional flexibility of LDHs, which is the result of the universal applicability of cations in layers and anions in the interlayer, granting them to expeditiously cull the appropriate cations and anions for a tailored electronic structure and active centers for specific photocatalytic reactions.185 However, to further put LDH-based photocatalysts on the verge of commercialization, it is necessary to fully comprehend and explicate the photophysical properties and structure–performance nexus of LDH-based photocatalysts for the CO2RR.
Other than the conventional heterojunction engineering, analogous to the current stage of the abovementioned electrocatalysts in this field, the recent development in catalysis have involved the use of SACs, such as Pt SACs,59 Cu SACs,61,62etc., which manifests a robust enhancement in the photocatalytic CO2RR activity as well. The geometric and electronic structures will undergo significant modifications when the species size is reduced from nanoparticles or nanoclusters to single-atoms (SAs). As a result of the quantum-size effect, downsizing is accompanied by more discrete electronic energy levels than the bulk material, which has continuous electronic energy levels.186 Thence, compared to those found in typical heterogeneous catalysts, SACs exhibit unique activity, stability, selectivity, and catalytic mechanism.187,188 Chen et al. studied the use of single Co atoms anchored on 2D Ti3C2Tx-MXene nanosheets via immobilization of Co experimentally and theoretically (Fig. 9c–e).189 The RDS in the conversion of CO2 to CO was the generation of *COOH,190 and the free energy required to generate COOH in SAC-Co/Ti3C2Tx was much lower than that required to form COOH in bare Ti3C2Tx. Theoretical findings reinforced the outcome obtained from the experimental data that incorporation of Ti3C2Tx and a single Co atom efficiently accelerated the formation of CO. Likewise, the AQY and selectivity of CO production using Co-Ti3C2Tx were determined to be 1.10% (450 nm) and 72.9%, respectively. Apart from that, in recent years, diatomic catalysts (DACs) have arisen as a member of the monoatomic catalyst family.191 By inserting the additional metal atom to produce homogeneous element DACs or heterogeneous element diatomic catalysts DACs, the linkage between the two metal atoms can efficiently overcome some of the limitations of SACs such as poor metal loading, a limited contact area between atoms and supporting materials, and weak interactions.192,193 Thence, in contrast to monatomic catalysts, diatomic catalysts provide more atomic loading, engagement between diatomic sites, and a broader range of catalytic performances, especially boosted activity and product selectivity in the CO2RR.194 In view of the marvelous performance of DACs in both the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic CO2RR when incorporated with other state-of-the-art catalysts,195–200 it remains uncertain as to whether the diatomic catalyst is possible to be adopted with MXenes for selective CO2 reduction products.
In brief, Ti3C2 semiconductors are the most widely used MXenes in photocatalysis due to their excellent electronic properties. However, more studies on other MXenes are required in order to explore the optimum materials for the photocatalytic CO2RR and other energy applications. Several functional MXenes have been theoretically investigated and identified, which can possibly serve as promising photocatalysts. For instance, Guo et al. theoretically studied the electronic structures of 2D Zr2CO2 and Hf2CO2 using ab initio calculations, and proved the possible use of the materials in photocatalytic applications.201 Moreover, using the aforementioned theoretical approach, Guo et al. investigated the modulation of electronic structures, optical properties and mechanical properties of two MXene incorporated Blue Phosphorene (BlueP) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures such as M2CO2/BlueP and Zr2CO2/BlueP, in which both of them are suitable for use in flexible devices and has good photocatalytic properties owing to visible light absorption, band structure and improved charge separation.202 Other than that, recently, there have been more materials like Ti2CO2, Sc2CF2, Sc2C(OH)2 and Sc2CO2 exhibiting remarkable photocatalytic characteristics based on theoretical results.203,204 Nonetheless, it is noted that the C2 products obtained from the CO2RR such as CH3CHO or CH3CH2OH has a substantially higher economic value than C1 products since they often have more energy than more straightforward products (e.g., CO, CH4).205,206 Therefore, the reaction mechanism of C2 product generation, photocatalyst stability, etc. must be addressed before they can be applied on a larger scale to remarkably resolve CO2 emission issues,207 especially the life cycle assessment for environmental benignity and techno-economic analysis for cost-efficiency.208 Furthermore, CO2RR investigations should routinely conduct 13CO2 isotopic studies to confirm that the carbon products originate from the photoreduction of CO2 rather than from organics or other contaminants in the system.209 It is worth mentioning that possible impurities will be formed from carbon-based substances or organics that aid in the production of carbon products. A summary of the experimental details of the photocatalysts is given in Table 3.

4. Conclusion, challenges, and future perspectives
Electro/photocatalytic CO2RR technology is a sustainable pathway to produce renewable fuels and chemical feedstocks, which is also a way to address the global energy and environmental crisis. As such, ongoing research studies have been focusing on exploring novel materials and applying modification strategies in order to further increase the catalytic activity toward the CO2RR. MXenes, also known as 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, are promising materials in a wide spectrum of applications. Since its discovery in 2011, the booming exploration of MXenes in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis has been triggered, which is due to the multiple advantages of high mechanical strength, adjustable structure, rich surface chemistry, high specific surface area, and good electrical conductivity. This review aims to provide inspiration and expedite the development of next-generation MXene-based composites for the electro/photocatalytic CO2RR. The structure of MXenes has been introduced in general, followed by the discussion of the important properties of MXenes for ameliorated electro/photocatalysis. Besides, multitudinous synthesis routes according to the categories of top-down and bottom-up methods have been summarized, covering HF-etching, in situ HF-forming, electrochemical etching, halogen etching, and so forth. In addition, recent advances in state-of-the-art MXene electrocatalysts and photocatalysts applied in the CO2RR have also been reviewed, emphasizing groundbreaking progress since 2016.
Despite the intriguing optical and electrochemical properties of MXenes, there are still challenges that need to be overcome. Although the investigation of MXene-based electro/photocatalysts for the CO2RR has made some encouraging progress, the scope of the research is limited since Ti-based MXenes hold the leading position in this field. Among diverse MXene catalysts, Ti3C2Tx has attracted the most interest, which is also the current research focal point. However, other members in the MXene family are still waiting for more investigations, such as Ta4C3, Mo2ScC2, Nb4C3, TiNbC, and Nb2C. Therefore, the diversity of MXenes is limited as only three nitride-based MXenes (Ti2NTx, Mo2NTx, and Ti4N3Tx) and one carbonitride-based MXene (Ti3CN) were experimentally developed thus far, as opposed to more than 20 carbide MXenes (such as Ti2CTx, V2CTx, Mo2CTx, and Ti3C2Tx).214 The greater formation energy of the parent MAX phase and the lower cohesive energy of the M–N bond inside the structure of nitride MXenes are the key roadblocks impeding their advancement.215 This greater formation energy indicates that the MAX phase demands more energy to construct the 3D layered structure required for future MXene material synthesis. Meanwhile, the lower cohesive energy of the M–N bonds leads to the shattering of the MXene structure as the etching process in aqueous HF solutions that removes the Al from the MAX structure also dissolves the MXene. According to simulated results of energy formation derived from first-principles calculations, a viable solution is to synthesize new MXenes with higher electronic conductivity than carbon-based MXenes, which is asserted to be a favorable catalyst for energy storage applications and yet challenging.214 Along with this perspective, the etching of A elements other than Al elements in the MAX phase precursors urgently requires more studies to cover more possible transition metal carbides from MAX phases, thus enriching the category of MXene in the fields of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis for the CO2RR. Meanwhile, the application scope of MXenes can be widened as well.
In addition, various synthesis strategies have been reviewed in this article, but the investigation on scalable synthesis is still worth taking into account. For instance, Shuck et al. have shed light on the possibility of HF-etching in the scaling production of the Ti3C2Tx MXene.89 The MXene was prepared in a large batch by etching 50 g of precursor Ti3AlC2 in a mixed HF/HCl etchant. Notably, the etching on a large scale retained the physical characteristics of as-synthesized MXene, and there was no significant difference in the structure between the large batch and small batch (1 kg) production. Thanks to the enlightenment of this research, further studies on the scaling production of HCl/LiF etching and fluoride-free etching are appealing and particularly necessary from a safety point of view. In the future for large-scale production, there are more factors to be considered, such as the influence of scaling the reactor size on the temperature and mechanical gradient, the issue of nonuniform stirring, and corrosion problems upon applying a fluoride-based etching environment in the system.38 Besides the facile and scalable synthesis strategies that need to be considered, seeking the help of advanced technology such as 3D printing, which is a versatile and effective additive manufacturing method, will allow for high-accuracy and faster fabrication of catalysts with desired architectures.216
In the last several decades, studies on solar-to-fuel (STF) generation have advanced fast, and various technologies for STF generation have been concocted.217–220 Photocatalytic systems, photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) systems, photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, and solar thermochemical systems are often the scrutinized STF generation systems. Despite substantial advances, the STF efficiency of the existing photochemical system is still below par for commercial use.219 A remarkable contribution by Stechel and Miller divulged that an STF efficiency of approximately 10% is the minimum target to be anticipated if up-scaling and mass production of such technologies present an opportunity of rivaling fossil fuels on a cost basis.221 However, to the best of our knowledge, the maximum STF efficiency of a photocatalytic system without sacrificial reagents is 5% to date.222,223 Specifically, in certain instances, the STF efficiency for photocatalytic CO2 reduction has reached around 1% in the work of Zhang et al.224 Thus, to increase the energy conversion efficiency, techniques including band energy engineering for full-spectrum absorption, heterojunctions and defect engineering for bolstered charge separation, and surface modification for chemical reactions have to be implemented. Additionally, one of the intuitive approaches is to direct and stepwise produce C2+ fuels using solar-powered C1 conversion via C–C coupling.225 Recent studies have shown that enhancing the charge-carrier and proton concentration on the photocatalyst surface promoted C2+ generation, which was achieved by boosting photon flux or using efficient cocatalysts to minimize charge reservoirs and recombination.226
On the other hand, from a broader perspective of electrocatalytic CO2RR systems, Sargent and his group have revealed that carbon monoxide (CO), ethylene (C2H4), formic acid (HCOOH), and ethanol (C2H5OH) are regarded as the most economically compelling value-added chemicals in the industry based on prior techno-economic analysis (TEA), and the preferable benchmarks for industrial large-scale synthesis of these products are faradaic efficiency (FE) >90%, cell voltage <1.8 V, current density >300 mA cm−2, and prolonged durability beyond 80000 h.227,228 Among these indicators, the FE is the most prominent factor, which dominates the purity of the final product mixture and the subsequent capital and operating cost involved in product separation/purification. All these criteria indicate that up to this point, the status of contemporary electrocatalysts is still far away from industrialization, and there is still a long way to go to further boost the catalyst activity and stability. Notably, to our knowledge, the highest FEs of formic acid and methanol achieved for MXene-based catalysts were 58.1% and 58%, respectively. Recently, Gao et al. established a new benchmark of STF efficiency of 19.9% with a FE of 98.9% toward CO using the copper/tin oxide-based electrolyzer that was powered by a triple-junction solar cell under standard AM 1.5G illumination.229 This work highlights the rational significance of incorporating solar cells in electrocatalysis to be a game-changing blueprint toward the efficient CO2RR. To further tackle such an issue of relatively low FEs, particularly for MXene-supported SAC electrocatalysts, the metal–support interaction (MSI) should be another parameter to be harnessed for potential catalytic performance enhancement, which describes the synergistic effect between anchored metal species and the supports.230,231 Besides, the spillover effect is also indispensable in the analysis to ameliorate the selectivity of C2+ products generated with distinct reaction pathways.232 As such, the innovative findings serve as a stepping stone in MXene-based catalysts for C2+ product generation, thereby improving the yield of higher carbon-containing fuels.
At the current stage, generally, the majority of the research into MXene-based electro/photocatalysts for the CO2RR is still concentrating on computational simulations (DFT calculations), and there is a significantly large gap in the experimental study. In this case, experiments are indispensable to consummate the investigations into MXene-based electro/photocatalysts, further assisting in proving the result of theoretical calculations and comprehending the structure–activity relationship in various media, such as acidic, neutral, and alkaline. Apart from that, surface termination is essential in tailoring the catalytic performance of pristine MXenes, which will have a tremendous impact on the bandgap structure, hydrophilic properties, surface adsorption toward reactive species, selectivity, and many more. Therefore, a dedicated selection of the type and amount of surface termination is necessary. However, insightful studies on the relationship between surface termination and catalytic activity are scarce, and arbitrary or diverse functionalized MXenes are usually obtained due to the current limitation in the synthesis route. As for recommendations, the precise tuning of terminations can be achieved by relying on advanced characterization techniques including in situ microscopy and spectroscopy (e.g., the combination of aberration-corrected STEM, elemental analysis, and synchrotron radiation techniques). Besides, the change in the surface composition of MXenes during electro/photochemical reactions can also be revealed by the utilization of in situ techniques, which is the staple of understanding the structure–activity relationship, especially for metal carbide and nitride that are vulnerable to different pH conditions and applied potential values in the catalytic process.233
Moreover, the creative designs of MXene-based catalysts can also cooperate with machine learning (ML), where the automated design and discovery processes of brand-new MXene-based catalysts are accelerated by advanced algorithms and data science, thus getting rid of tedious trial-and-error methods.234 The performances of MXene-based electro/photocatalysts toward the CO2RR are predicated on the aid of geometrical, electronic, and activity descriptors as inputs. For example, the loading of noble metals on the MXene surfaces can be optimized to the minimum via ML to construct a cost-effective noble metal-based catalyst with the highest performance.235 In view of the complex system of MXenes, Rajan et al. built a huge database of MXenes with 23800 MXene materials composed of different elements.236 The huge database is created since it is challenging to generate the optimal solution using ML with only a single manual trial and with limited time. For instance, ML has been utilized in studying the energy band of MXenes,237 predicting point defects238 and analyzing the stability of MXenes239 as well as the possibility of MXene synthesis.240
Furthermore, MXene materials have the issue of poor stability at high temperatures and pressures during synthesis, and it is easy for MXenes to undergo oxidation in the air. For example, O-terminated Ti-based MXenes tend to suffer from inevitable oxidation to generate TiO2 during synthesis at an elevated temperature.43,144 Therefore, the solution to this bottleneck will be a worthwhile research direction in the future with stability added as a compulsory criterion in developing new catalysts. Other than that, the newly developed transition metal borides similar to MXenes are also worth studying as replacing carbon or nitrogen in MXenes with boron has shown fascinating electronic conductivity and remarkable catalytic activity. In recent years, 2D transition metal borides (Mbenes), which are boron analogs of MXenes,s have been discovered. MBenes can be derived from ternary or quaternary transition metal boride (MAB) phases and they have similar properties to MXenes where they have weak M–A bonds and strong A–B bonds. These unique properties facilitate the etching and delamination of the MAB phase into single 2D thin flakes.241,242 Computational techniques and theoretical models were employed to predict the stability of MBenes and new stable compounds. For example, Guo et al. reported the selective etching of the A layer (MAB phases) from a family of layered transition metal borides to create a new family of 2D transition metal borides (designated as MBenes).243 It is shown that the newly formed MBenes (2D Mo2B2 and Fe2B2) have extremely high Young's moduli, are isotropic, exhibit exceptional stability and possess prominent electronic conductivity due to their metallic properties, which make them suitable for electrocatalytic applications. Likewise, Alameda et al. had previously demonstrated the possibility of developing 2D MoBs (MBenes) using previously unreported Mo2AlB2 as the precursor, which can serve as a future candidate for the catalytic CO2RR.244 However, experimental synthesis of the predicted MBenes is limited. Hence, efforts toward the experimental synthesis of more 2D carbides, nitrides and borides that have been theoretically predicted should be undertaken.
On top of manipulating the properties of MXene-based catalysts, the assistance of external field forces during the reaction will be another compelling strategy for ameliorating the performance of the CO2RR catalyst, such as the influence of piezoelectric and photothermal to enhance the overall efficiency of energy-to-fuel conversion.245–247 Last but not least, cooperation with the industry is of equal importance to acquire synergistic effort from diverse academic disciplines including chemical engineering, chemistry, materials science, and physics, thus heading the development of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis to a new post-hype era and fueling the progress of industry revolution 4.0. By circumventing these challenges encountered by MXene-based electro/photocatalysts toward the CO2RR as well as several tenable and insightful recommendations, it is forecasted that MXenes will be a forthcoming rising star to shine in the realm of sustainable energy conversion to attain carbon neutrality in the years to come (Fig. 10). Overall, the future of the MXenes should encompass the following aspects like scalable synthesis routes, experimental studies (currently most of the investigation revolves around computation/simulation), different types of surface terminations that contribute to dissimilar catalytic activity, in situ characterization (e.g., the combination of aberration-corrected STEM, elemental analysis, and synchrotron radiation techniques), machine learning (advanced algorithms and data science), and the surface composition study to unravel the stability of MXenes under different reaction conditions (e.g., pH, voltage, temperature, etc.).
