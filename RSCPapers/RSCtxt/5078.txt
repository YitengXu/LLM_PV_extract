With the aim of fabricating efficient mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells, we used tris[2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide)] (FK209) as a p-dopant for spiro-OMeTAD. The mixture of spiro-OMeTAD, FK209, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) exhibited significantly higher performance than mixtures of pristine spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-OMeTAD, and FK209, and spiro-OMeTAD, Li-TFSI, and TBP. Such a synergistic effect between the Co-complex and Li-TFSI in conjunction with spiro-OMeTAD effectively improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the fabricated solar cells. As a result, we achieved PCE of 10.4%, measured under standard solar conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
Introduction
Sun is the greatest energy source for the world toward solving the serious issue of global warming due to excessive CO2 generation. Solar cells have been regarded as an effective means for directly converting solar energy to electricity. The best commercial silicon solar cells available today have efficiencies up to 20% but are still relatively expensive to produce in terms of both materials and techniques. Therefore, new solar cell technologies are needed for relatively low-cost conversion of solar energy to electricity so that solar cells can achieve cost-parity with fossil fuels.
Since Grätzel et al.1 reported the fabrication of relatively cheap solar cells—called dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)—using titania nanoparticles, organic dyes, and liquid electrolytes, extensive studies have been carried out to increase the performance of these cells. In addition to high performance, long-term stability is one of the key requirements of photovoltaic devices employing DSSCs. Although a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 12% has recently been achieved for DSSCs,2 sealing issues due to volatile electrolytes have to be addressed for achieving long-term durability. With the aim of developing all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ssDSSCs) for overcoming such leakage problems, Bach et al.3 in 1998 reported for the first time ssDSSCs fabricated using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as an organic hole conductor, recording 0.74% in its overall efficiency. Thereafter, several materials such as CuSCN,4 P3HT,5 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),6 and polyaniline,7 have been studied for use as solid hole-conducting materials in DSSCs. Very recently, Kanatzidis et al.8 achieved a PCE of 8.5% for a ssDSSC employing CsSnI3, a p-type inorganic semiconductor, as a hole-transporting material (HTM). On the other hand, the efficiency of spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSSCs was increased dramatically through dye development and TiO2 modification, as well as through the addition of ionic compounds such as lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) to spiro-OMeTAD. Grätzel et al. reported further improvement in the performance of spiro-OMeTAD-based ssDSSCs achieved using tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) (FK102) as a chemical dopant. They achieved the highest recorded efficiency of 7.2% for spiro-OMeTAD-based DSSCs by using an organic dye with a high molar extinction coefficient.9
Recently, perovskite-based methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3, X = halogen; CH3NH3: MA) and its mixed-halide crystals, with three-dimensional perovskite structures, have been used as light harvesters for solar cells.10–14 Snaith et al.11 and Park et al.12 independently demonstrated highly efficient solar cells using CH3NH3PbI2Cl and CH3NH3PbI3, respectively, as a light harvester; both of them used spiro-OMeTAD as a hole conductor. However, the fill factors (FFs) of these cells were low; this have been due to the high series resistance caused by the relatively poor charge transport of spiro-OMeTAD.13 Therefore, it would be important to fabricate the cells with higher hole conductors.
In this work, we fabricated heterojunction solar cells using spiro-OMeTAD/tris[2-((1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)] (FK209) composite as a hole conductor with CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite on a mesoporous (mp) TiO2 layer. The cells consisted of the following components: FTO (F-doped tin oxide)/blocking layer (bl)-TiO2/mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD + FK209/Au. Interestingly, the use of the spiro-OMeTAD/FK209 composite greatly increased the overall efficiency of the cells through a simultaneous increase of both open circuit voltage (Voc) and FFs. One of the cells fabricated in this study showed a PCE of 10.4% under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2; this value is among the highest reported PCE values to date for mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/small-molecule spiro-OMeTAD solar cells.
Experimental
Synthesis of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)-tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209)
3.45 g (17.1 mmol, 3 eq.) of 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine was suspended in a 2:1 mixture of water (120 mL) and methanol (60 mL) and heated to 70 °C. Then 1.36 g (5.7 mmol, 1 eq.) of CoCl2·6H2O was added and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 10 minutes. 10 mL of H2O2 (30%) and 10 mL of HCl (25%) were added to oxidize the cobalt and the mixture was further heated to 70 °C for 2 h. Then a concentrated solution of 8.18 g (28.5 mmol, 5 eq.) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in water was added slowly at 50 °C to precipitate the product. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the orange solid was collected on a sintered glass-frit and washed with water. The solid was dried in air and then in vacuo to obtain the pure product as an orange solid. Yield: 7.76 g (5.16 mmol, 91%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, acetone-D6): δ 9.87–9.64 (m, 3H, ArH), 8.79–8.65 (m, 3H, ArH), 8.00–7.79 (m, 6H, ArH), 7.78–7.62 (m, 3H, ArH), 7.37–7.17 (m, 3H, ArH), 1.72–1.15 (m, 27H, tBut).
Solar cell fabrication
A 60 nm thick dense blocking layer of TiO2 (bl-TiO2) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition carried out using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between FTO and the hole-conducting layer. 750 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) films were screen-printed onto the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate using a paste that was prepared according to a reported method,15 and the films were then calcined at 500 °C for 1 h to remove the organic part. The films were then immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 60 °C for 1 h and were then heat-treated at 500 °C for 30 min to improve interfacial contact with nanocrystalline TiO2. CH3NH3I were synthesized from 30 mL hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich), by reacting 27.86 mL methylamine (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.) in a 250 mL round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring. The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solutions at 50 °C for 1 h. The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The CH3NH3PbI3 solution (40 wt%) was prepared by reacting the synthesized CH3NH3I powder and PbI2 (Aldrich) in γ-butyrolactone at 60 °C for 12 h. The CH3NH3PbI3 solution was then coated onto the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by consecutively carrying out spin coating at 2000 rpm for 60 s and at 3000 rpm for 60 s; the substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 5 min. A 50 mM spiro-OMeTAD (Merck)/chlorobenzene solution and a Co(III)-complex (FK209)/acetonitrile solution with designed concentrations in the range 4.15–33.24 mM were prepared to obtain the mixed solution to be used for spin-coating the spiro-OMeTAD:FK209 layer. In addition, 37.5 μL Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI)/acetonitrile (170 mg per mL) and 17.5 μL TBP were added as additives. Each HTM solution was spin-coated on a CH3NH3PbI3/mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm2.
Characterization
To measure the conductance of spiro-OMeTAD films, we thermally grew a 300 nm thick SiO2 layer on a heavily doped n-type (100) Si wafer (0.05 Ω cm) to be used as a substrate. After UV/ozone treatment of the SiO2/Si wafer, we spin-coated each HTM solution on the wafer at 3000 rpm for 120 s. Two Au (60 nm) electrode films were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask with a channel length of 50 μm and a channel width of 3000 μm. I–V curves between the two Au electrodes were recorded using a semiconductor parametric analyzer and a source meter (Keithley 2400). The absorption spectra for diluted spiro-OMeTAD solutions were measured using a UV-vis spectrometer (Hitachi U-3300). EQE was measured using a power source (Newport 300 W xenon lamp, 66920) with a monochromator (Newport Cornerstone 260) and a multimeter (Keithley 2001). The J–V curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) at 100 mA cm−2 illumination AM 1.5G and a calibrated Si-reference cell certificated by NREL. The J–V curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask 0.096 cm2 in area.
Results and discussion
Fig. 1a shows the energy level diagram for the different solar cell components, depicting the conduction band of TiO2, conduction and valence bands of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, and position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of spiro-OMeTAD as HTM and the Co-complex (FK209). In this scheme, the electrons and holes generated in CH3NH3PbI3 can be energetically injected into the mp-TiO2 and HTM phases, respectively. The HOMO energy of the Co-complex is around 340 meV lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD.9 The HOMO energies of the Co-complex and spiro-OMeTAD were derived from the oxidation potential (1.06 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) of the Co-complex and the first oxidation potential (0.72 V vs. NHE) of spiro-OMeTAD,9 respectively. This is because HOMO energy is dependent on the oxidation potential (i.e., removal of an electron from the HOMO), as well as on the oxidation state of the compound. The movement of electrons from the HOMO of spiro-OMeTAD to FK209 induces the creation of hole carriers in spiro-OMeTAD, leading to an increase in its conductance. Fig. 1b shows a comparison of the charge conductance of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (=HTM A), spiro-OMeTAD with Li-TFSI and TBP (=HTM B), spiro-OMeTAD with 7.7 mol% FK209 (=HTM C), and spiro-OMeTAD with 7.7 mol% FK209, Li-TFSI, and TBP (=HTM D). For measuring the conductance, a 200 nm thick film of each of the above four mixtures was deposited on a SiO2/Si substrate and a Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask (channel length: 50 μm; channel width: 3000 μm). The addition of Li-TFSI (TBP) to spiro-OMeTAD increases the conductance to be more than 100 times that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD, in accordance with previously reported behavior.16 Moreover, the conductance of pristine spiro-OMeTAD was greatly increased (∼280 times) upon the addition of 7.7 mol% FK209. In particular, the simultaneous addition of FK209 and Li-TFSI (TBP) to spiro-OMeTAD increases the conductance 780 times, indicating that the co-addition of Li-TFSI (TBP) and FK209 is highly effective for reducing the charge transport resistance of spiro-OMeTAD.

Fig. 2a shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves for TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTMs/Au solar cells fabricated using HTM A, HTM B, HTM C, and HTM D. The photovoltaic parameters for these devices are summarized in Table 1. For the reference device fabricated using HTM A, the following values were obtained: Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V, and FF of 45.4%, yielding an overall PCE of 5.0%. A low FF that can be attributed to the high charge transport resistance of this device limits its performance. On the other hand, the device fabricated using HTM B exhibited dramatically enhanced performance: Jsc of 17.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.72 V, FF of 56.9%, and overall PCE of 7.3%. The high values of Jsc and FF mainly contribute to the high PCE. As expected from Fig. 1b, the increased conductance of spiro-OMeTAD with ionic additives decreases the series resistance from 137.2 to 97.2 Ω, corresponding to the increase in FF from 45.4% to 56.9%. Moreover, additional increase in Jsc and Voc was observed and this might also be attributed to the improved charge extraction owing to the smaller resistance of HTM B. Similarly, the use of HTM C leads to an increase in all the performance parameters: Jsc of 18.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.80 V, and FF of 55.6%, resulting in a remarkable increase in PCE from 5.0% to 8.1%. Here, it is notable that Voc of the device fabricated using HTM C was greatly increased to 0.80 V from 0.70 V (for the device fabricating using HTM A), even though the Jsc, FF, and serial resistance values of this device are comparable with the corresponding values for the device fabricated using HTM B. This indicates that FK209 as a dopant for spiro-OMeTAD plays an important role in increasing Voc because the Voc value of HTM B was slightly increased to 0.72 V from 0.70 V for HTM A. Generally, Voc is determined by the difference in the Fermi levels of TiO2 and HTM. Therefore, the higher Voc value of HTM C was assumed to be due to the lower Fermi level of HTM. Further improvement in the performance was achieved by using HTM D, which consisted of a mixture of spiro-OMeTAD, 7.7 mol% FK209, Li-TFSI, and TBP. The values of FF and Voc were the highest for this device at 63.6% and 0.85 V, respectively. This may be attributed to better hole doping of spiro-OMeTAD and lower series resistance in this case. The increase in Voc observed in HTM C and D will again be discussed later.

The concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD, i.e., hole doping, plays a very important role in determining the charge transport resistance of spiro-OMeTAD and the final photovoltaic performance of solar cells.17 It was reported that in ionic-doped spiro-OMeTAD systems,17 Li-TFSI plays the role of a catalyst in the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD via a photoinduced reaction. Oxidized spiro-OMeTAD can be easily distinguished from ground-state spiro-OMeTAD by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy because the former has an absorption band at 520 nm.18
Fig. 3 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra for HTM A, HTM B, HTM C, and HTM D. The UV-vis absorption spectra for HTM C and D clearly show a new absorption band with the peak maxima located at 520 nm regardless of the presence of Li-TFSI. According to previously reported UV-vis absorption spectra for FK209, the absorption at 520 nm does not correspond to FK209 itself.9 Therefore, this new absorption band results from the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD cation radical, indicating the occurrence of charge transfer interaction between FK209 and spiro-OMeTAD.19,20 Because the solutions were kept in the dark prior to UV-vis spectroscopy, the photoinduced oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD by the addition of Li-TFSI and TBP is not expected, and therefore, the spiro-OMeTAD with Li-TFSI and TBP does not show any absorption band at 520 nm. Therefore, the new absorption band at 520 nm reveals that the addition of FK209 to spiro-OMeTAD can lead to the formation of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD via a charge transport reaction between spiro-OMeTAD and FK209 even under dark conditions. The increase in the concentration of oxidized spiro-OMeTAD can induce a shift in the Fermi level to the HOMO level due to increased hole concentration.21 Consequently, in the cell fabricated using HTM C, the Fermi level of spiro-OMeTAD can be lowered by increasing the hole concentration when the charge transfer interaction occurs. This would lead to an expansion of the gap between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the Fermi level of spiro-OMeTAD that in turn would result in higher Voc values.9 However, the increased Voc value may be attributed to several factors. In addition to the more negative Fermi level and the lower resistance of the charge transport complex, the diode-like current–voltage (I–V) characteristics in the dark can give an insight into the charge recombination in real devices. Fig. 2b shows dark J–V data for the devices fabricated using HTM A, HTM B, HTM C, and HTM D. In comparison with the reference device fabricated using HTM A, the device fabricated using HTM D showed the lowest dark current and a 150 mV shift in the onset of the dark current despite the highest relative conductance of this HTM film (Fig. 2b). Because the difference on the dark current results from an electron flow from TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 nanocomposite to different-type HTMs in the devices, the lowest dark current for the device fabricated using HTM D reveals that HTM D has a superior electron blocking ability.22 In addition, the TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 has different features in the device structure compared with conventional solid-state sensitized solar cells. CH3NH3PbI3 as light harvester is fully deposited into mp-TiO2 electrode with overlayers that are densely formed on top of the mp-TiO2.13 This structure can prevent the direct contact between TiO2 nanoparticles and HTM, resulting in the reduction of an interfacial charge recombination between TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD. Consequently, the addition of FK209 and Li-TFSI + TBP to spiro-OMeTAD (HTM D) has a synergistic effect on the photovoltaic performance of the solid-state mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell in terms of hole transport and electron blocking ability.

It is believed that FK209 generates additional charge carriers for spiro-OMeTAD, leading to an increased conductivity of HTM. Thus, we investigated the J–V characteristics of the fabricated devices as a function of FK209 concentration in the range 0 (blank)–14.3 mol%, based on same Li-TFSI + TBP as HTM D. The corresponding I–V curves under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4 and the results are summarized in Table 2. The device fabricated using the spiro-OMeTAD (92.3 mol%):FK209 (7.7 mol%) charge transport complex showed the best performance. The Voc and FF values for this device increased from 0.72 V to 0.84 V and from 58.3% to 65.3% while the Jsc value was maintained constant until the FK209 concentration of 11.9 mol%, yielding an overall PCE of 9.9%. However, at higher concentrations (14.3 mol%) of FK209, Voc and FF values decreased. This reduction in the performance at higher FK209 concentrations might be attributed to the increased recombination due to excessive hole density or inhomogeneity in the charge transport complex. Consequently, the optimum concentration of FK209 for the spiro-OMeTAD:FK209 charge transport complex is 7.7 mol% in the experimental range. However, further study is needed to conclusively establish the effect of recombination kinetics and charge transport in spiro-OMeTAD:Co-complex composites on the HTM layer behavior in mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells.

Fig. 5a and b show the I–V curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum, respectively, for a champion device containing 7.7 mol% FK209. The device showed Jsc of 18.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 865 mV, and FF of 66% under AM 1.5G solar irradiance (100 mW cm−2), yielding a PCE of 10.4%. The EQE spectrum shows a maximum value of 0.78 at 540 nm and overall high values of more than 0.60 up to 750 nm, yielding an integrated Jsc value of 18.1 mA cm−2. The excellent photovoltaic performance with PCE greater than 10% obtained in this study reveals that the composite charge transport complex containing spiro-OMeTAD and Co-complexes can be used to increase the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of recently developed solid-state mesoscopic lead-halide heterojunction solar cells.

Conclusions
We have fabricated highly efficient mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 heterojunction solar cells by using a mixture of spiro-OMeTAD, FK209, Li-TFSI, and TBP as HTM. The performance of the devices was substantially equivalent to the charge conductance of HTM themselves, responsible for series resistances. In particular, the addition of FK209 (Co-complex) to spiro-OMeTAD increased Voc, mainly due to the reduced carrier recombination and lower Fermi level of HTM. Finally, we achieved a PCE of 10.4% for a solar cell using spiro-OMeTAD as HTM under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
