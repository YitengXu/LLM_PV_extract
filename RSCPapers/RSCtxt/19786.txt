Because of their unique one-dimensional (1D) geometric and electronic structure, large surface area, good chemical and thermal stability, and excellent mechanical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provide a new model system for basic scientific study of material science. Substantive efforts have also been made to explore their applications.1 For example, CNTs have been used as nanofillers for preparing composite materials with enhanced mechanical and/or electrical properties, such as scanning probe tips, field emitters, diodes, quantum wires, support for catalysts, electrodes and so on.2 The utilization of carbon nanotubes was based on their unique structure and excellent physical properties, such as their good mechanical properties, electrical properties, one dimensional nanostructure, even at times many of or all these properties as a whole. Modification of CNTs with functional materials will greatly broaden and enhance their applications. The preparation of hybrid materials, based on the combination of metal oxides and CNTs possessing the properties of each component, or even with a synergistic effect, would be useful in field emission displays,3 polymer or ceramic reinforcement,4,5 supercapacitors,6–9 chemical sensors and biosensors,10–14 photocatalysts15–19 and electronic or photoelectrical devices.20–22 The CNT network was found to facilitate dispersion of the oxide nanoparticles because of their large surface and the ability to provide continuous conducting pathways for the transportation of electrons, as illustrated in Fig. 1. These characteristics are beneficial for the applications of the hybrid materials of CNTs and metal oxides.

There have been some investigations concerning the attachment of various inorganic oxides onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). For example, oxide nanoparticles such as SiO2,23,24 SnO2,25 ZnO,26,27 TiO215,28–31 have been coated onto CNTs by impregnation, sol–gel, hydrothermal synthesis, thermal evaporation-deposition and so on. In order to get strong combination and homogeneous distribution of oxide nanoparticles on the CNTs, CNTs are usually functionalized. The most commonly used method is to oxidize CNTs by strong acids to introduce carboxyl groups, which could effectively prevent the agglomeration of oxide nanoparticles, because they have strong interactions with the hydroxyl groups of metallic oxide nanoparticles, such as bond formation via esterification. TiO2 nanoparticles have been used to label the defects on CNTs, which is an indication of the strong combination of oxide nanoparticles on the defects with functional groups.32 It is very interesting that MnO2 was coated on CNTs by redox reaction between CNTs and KMnO4 (Fig. 2).33–36 Surfactants or polymers were also employed to modify CNTs with positive or negative surface charge, which promoted the deposition of oxide nanoparticles.24,30,31,37

This article highlights the characteristics of hybrid materials of carbon nanotubes and metal oxides, and addresses the enhancement effect of CNTs on the performance of the hybrid materials for applications in energy storage, electroanalysis and photocatalysis. The enhancement mechanism and the challenges for materials science are also discussed.
Modification of CNTs with oxides for energy storage
With the development of the modern economy and the improvement of modern lives, faster and higher energy storage systems are essential in a number of applications. Electrochemical capacitors, also called supercapacitors, are the best candidates for providing the high power and long durability needed for new energy devices such as hybrid peak-power sources in electric vehicles, backup power sources for various electrical devices, and uninterrupted power supplies. A more recent example is the use of electrochemical double layer capacitors in emergency doors (16 per plane) on an Airbus A380, which shows that in terms of performance, safety and reliability, electrochemical capacitors are definitely ready for large-scale implementation. Based on the charge-storage mechanism, electrochemical capacitors can be divided into two categories: one is the electrical double layer capacitors, where the capacitance arises from the charge separation at an electrode/electrolyte interface; the other is the pseudocapacitor, where the capacitance arises from the fast and reversible faradaic redox reactions of electroactive materials with several oxidation states.38–41 In the former, carbon materials such as activated carbon, carbon fiber cloth, carbon aerogels/foams and CNTs, etc., are usually used as electrode materials due to their high specific surface area and good electrical conductivity. In the latter, some electroactive materials with several oxidation states or structures such as transition-metal oxides (e.g., oxides of Ru, Ni, Co, Mn, Mo, Sn, etc.) and polymers are used as electrode materials.
As one of the carbon materials used for electrical double layer capacitors, CNTs have gained great attention because of their large surface area, inert chemical property, one dimensional structure with nano pores and unique electrical properties since their discovery. These electrical double layer capacitors composed of CNTs electrode have shown very high power density due to their fast kinetics on the adsorption or desorption of protons, but just like other carbon materials, it is difficult to obtain very high energy density. In contrast to electrical double layer capacitors, the pseudocapacitors show superior energy density, but usually they have relatively lower power density because of their redox kinetics. The faradaic process is slower than the nonfaradaic process. Hence, new types of supercapacitors, which combine the advantages of both double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors (Fig. 3), have become a subject of importance to electrochemists. Among the numerous electroactive materials, RuO2 has been considered to be the most promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode materials owing to its reversible charging-discharging process and large pseudocapacitance. In order to obtain larger capacitance of RuO2, Kim et al. developed an approach for high dispersion of RuO2 with a hydrated amorphous and porous structure and a small size assisted by the carboxylated carbon nanotubes.6 The surface carboxyl groups of both carbon nanotubes and metal oxide could form chemical bonds with each other, which effectively prevent the RuO2 nanoparticles from agglomerating. This heterostructure provides a large surface area and forms direct conduction paths for protons to easily access even the inner part of the RuO2, thus increased the capacitance of the composite and effective utilization of RuO2. In the past 30 years, the capacitive behavior of RuO2 in acidic solutions has been the focus of scientific research, but its high cost and toxic nature exclude it from wide application. This limitation has urged scientists to find other cheaper materials or methods to get similar capacitive behavior of RuO2. On the other hand, nickel, cobalt and manganese oxides have recently been developed as alternative electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. Supercapacitors based on CNTs supported MnO2,33,35 Fe2O3,42 NiO and Co2O37,8 have all been reported. These composites show wonderful charging-discharging properties, high specific capacitance even at high discharge current density of 100 mA cm−2, and excellent cycle stability. However, for the electrochemical capacitors constructed by most metal oxides, the electrolyte is aqueous and a maximum operation voltage is often in the range of 1.0 V, which greatly reduces the specific energy of the capacitors. Amorphous vanadium oxides, as a special electrode material for supercapacitors in aqueous and organic electrolytes, have received a lot of attention. The V2O5·xH2O/CNTs film electrode for supercapacitors using organic electrolytes was reported with large operation voltage windows, which significantly increased the specific energy of the capacitors.43,44

Apart from the materials mentioned above, the carbon nanotube arrays, in which the carbon nanotubes are aligned in parallel, have also attracted considerable interest. The alignment structure facilitates surface modification for adding surface/interface characteristics to the hybrids of oxides and CNTs (Fig. 3). We have successfully prepared a novel type of nanocomposite electrode based on oxides-modified carbon nanotube arrays for supercapacitors. For example, RuO2 nanoparticles have been deposited on the vertically aligned carbon nanotubes by over-head magnetron sputtering deposition.9 Due to the hierarchically porous structure which enhances the ionic conductivity of the composite, the high surface area and nanometre size which reduces the diffusion length of ions within ruthenium oxide phase, the RuO2/CNTs nanocomposite electrode has high specific capacitance and high stability during charging-discharging cycles (Fig. 4). The similar nanocomposite electrodes based on MnO2-modified vertically aligned CNTs arrays for supercapacitors were also reported.35,45

As for another device for energy storage, the lithium-ion battery has been paid much attention since being introduced in 1990 owing to its high energy density. Its shortages lie in low power density resulting from large polarization at high charging-discharging rates and high cost. Therefore, in order to obtain high performance with both high power and high energy densities, it is important to explore new electrode materials with nanostructures that can provide interconnected nanopaths for electrolyte-ion transport and electronic conduction, thus greatly reduce polarization of electrode. CNTs have been suggested as a substitute for the graphite anode in lithium-ion batteries due to their promising features for highly efficient Li storage, such as outstanding electrical properties, high chemical stability, high aspect ratio, strong mechanical strength, and active surface area and so on. Whereas, there are two inherent disadvantages in an electrode based on CNTs: low volumetric capacity owing to the presence of a large internal void, which is of no use for Li storage, and specific capacity that is limited by the theoretical maximum capacity of the graphite structure (372 mAh g−1). Meanwhile, some metal oxides have also been widely studied as electrode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacity, safety, environmental benignity, and low cost, but their poor electronic conductivity and capacity decay with cycling arising from large volume expansion during the lithium uptake/release process limit them from application in high-performance lithium ion batteries. It is believed that a carefully crafted combination of CNTs and high-capacity Li-storage compounds may work synergistically to deliver both high capacity and good cyclability. SWCNTs-containing mesoporous TiO2 was successfully synthesized by a bi-continuous microemulsion-aided process.46 The mesoporous TiO2 has large surface area and thin walls, which enables easy transportation of ions, thus shortens the Li-diffusion length in the solid phase and decreases the current density per unit surface area. Incorporation of SWCNTs inside or beside an anatase nanophase effectively improves the charging-discharging property of anatase, especially at high rates. So, this mesoporous composite has both high energy density and high power density. In addition, some coaxial nanocomposite electrodes were also applied in lithium-ion batteries, for example, SnO2-core/carbon-shell nanotubes47 and CNTs-core/MnO2-shell nanotube arrays.48 This coaxial structure not only increases electronic and ionic conductivity due to the presence of highly conductive CNTs and well-directed conductive paths, but also improves the stability during the repeated ionic intercalation due to the flexible CNTs, which act as a buffer to alleviate the volume expansion of metal oxides. As a result, the coaxial nanocomposites exhibit highly reversible capacity and excellent cyclability in lithium-ion storage and retrieval, making them suitable electrode materials for lithium-ion battery.
To sum up, the application of CNTs in energy storage makes these devices have higher specific capacitance, higher power density, higher energy density and higher stability, thus would make them practically and extensively more useful.
Modification of CNTs with oxides for electroanalysis
Electrochemical sensors based on metal-oxide-modified electrodes with enhanced electrocatalytic activity facilitate the analysis of many biomolecules such as glucose, dopamine, ascorbic acid and so on. However, the poor electrical conductivity of the electrodes based on metal oxides limits their application. To overcome this shortage, the electroactive metal oxides were loaded onto CNTs. The CNTs not only serve as the support for the dispersion of oxide nanoparticles with high surface area, but more importantly, provide straight conducting pathways for the electrons (Fig. 1). Modification of CNTs with oxides endows them with excellent catalytic activity or/and superb sensitivity to various target molecules. This certainly improved the selectivity or/and detection limit for electroanalysis. Therefore, the preparation of nanocomposite materials, based on the combination of metal oxides and CNTs possessing high electrocatalytic activity, is essential for electroanalysis in routine usage. Furthermore, modification of a single carbon nanotube or a small bundle of SWCNTs with oxides can be developed as a nano/micro-electrode for in vitro and in vivo intracellular analysis.
Some efforts have been made in the development of metal oxides-modified MWCNTs electrodes for the detection of biomolecules. Batchelor-McAuley et al. have recently demonstrated that the impurity CuO in MWCNTs is responsible for the high electrochemical activity towards the oxidation of glucose.10 In another work, a glucose sensor based on Cu2O/MWCNTs nanocomposite was successfully fabricated.11 Compared to the bare GCE, the Cu2O nanoparticles and the MWCNTs-modified electrodes, the Cu2O/MWCNTs modified electrode displays high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose. With a potential of −0.20 V, the Cu2O/MWCNTs-modified electrode was used to determine glucose by amperometric, showing significantly lower overvoltage and a linear dependence in the concentration up to 10 μM with a sensitivity of 6.53 μA μM−1 and a detection limit of 0.05 μM. This is due to the Cu2O nanoparticles loaded on MWCNTs which provides large surface area and significantly increases the electrocatalytic active sites. In addition, the MWCNTs act as a promoter to enhance the electrochemical oxidation of glucose.
The direct and fast detection of other biomolecules, such as insulin and DNA, is of considerable interest. However, the measurements are limited because of the slow kinetics of oxidation of biomolecules at common electrode materials. The metal oxides-modified CNTs electrodes with a synergistic effect offer substantial improvements in the sensitivity of voltammetric and amperometric measurements of biomolecules. Electrode was prepared by electrodepositing ruthenium oxide (RuOx) onto MWCNTs for electrochemical detection of insulin.13 A wide linear range was achieved from 10 to 800 nM with a detection limit of 1 nM. The RuOx/MWCNTs electrode exhibits greater electrochemical activity towards the oxidation of insulin compared to its RuOx and MWCNTs counterparts. The improvement is ascribed to synergistic enhancement rather than the combination of the two individual layers. In another work, an efficient DNA immobilization matrix based on MWCNTs/ZrO2-modified GC electrode was fabricated by using chitosan as the binding reagent.14 The response signal increases linearly with the increase of the DNA concentration in the range of 1.49 × 10−10 to 9.32 × 10−8 M, with the detection limit of 7.5 × 10−11 M. Nanoporous ZrO2 and MWCNTs have synergistic effects on the redox of DNA. Compared with previous DNA sensors with oligonucleotides solely immobilized on MWCNTs or ZrO2 film, DNA loading quantity on the hybrid electrode increased because of its large surface area and good charge-transport characteristics, thus the detection sensitivity is improved.
Nonenzymatic biosensors with excellent electrocatalytic activity have also been developed by using metal oxides-modified vertically aligned MWCNTs arrays. Well-aligned CNTs have certain advantages because they can provide more landing sites and have a space between each tube that would beneficially disperse nanoparticles compared to disordered CNTs. It is also much easier to modify well-aligned CNTs by hydrothermal synthesis,26 electrodeposition49–51 and over-head magnetron sputtering.9,12,52,53 Chen and Zhang have reported an amperometric nonenzymatic glucose biosensor based on MnO2/MWCNTs electrode.49 MnO2 was coated on vertically aligned MWCNTs arrays by electrodeposition. The MnO2/MWCNTs electrode displays high electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose in alkaline solution. The MWCNTs possessing large surface area provide more landing sites for MnO2 to form active sites, and thereby improving the sensitivity of electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. In another study, CuO nanoparticles were deposited on the vertically aligned MWCNTs by magnetron sputtering.12 The CuO/MWCNTs electrode shows much higher electrocatalytic activity and lower overvoltage than the bare MWCNTs electrode towards oxidation of glucose. At an applied potential of +0.40 V, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode presents a high sensitivity of 2596 μA mM−1 cm−2 to glucose. More importantly, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode is also highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion, and the interference from the oxidation of common interfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and carbohydrate compounds is effectively avoided. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode was used to analyze glucose concentration in human serum samples with high reliability. TiO2 nanoparticles-modified CNTs arrays for a H2O2 sensor was also reported with high electrocatalytic activity.50 At an applied potential of +0.4 V, the TiO2/MWCNTs electrode exhibits a linear dependence (R = 0.998) in the H2O2 concentration up to 15.0 × 10−3 M with a sensitivity of 13.4 μA mM−1 and detection limit of 4.0 × 10−7 M with signal/noise = 3. In another work, electrochemical behavior of dopamine at the RuO2-modified vertically aligned CNTs electrode was also investigated.52 The peak current is increased obviously and the peak potential is shifted negatively compared to the RuO2/GCE electrode, indicating the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity by the presence of MWCNTs. The increased peak current is due to the conjunction of catalysis of pure RuO2 and MWCNTs arrays. At an applied potential of +0.4 V, the RuO2/MWCNTs electrode exhibited a wide detection range up to 3.6 × 10−3 M with detection limit of 6.0 × 10−8 M and a sensitivity of 83.8 μA mM−1 for dopamine determination. In addition, the RuO2/MWCNTs electrode also presents a favorable stability and selectivity.
CNTs modified by metal oxides can not only be used for detection of biomolecules but also for inorganic ions. Ye et al. reported the modification of inorganic polymeric oxides on the surface of CNTs by electrodeposition.51 The negatively charged surface of MoOx/MWCNTs electrode exhibits electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of bromate due to high surface area and fast electron transfer rate of nanotubes. Zhang et al. reported a novel solid-state pH sensor based on WO3/MWCNTs nanocomposite electrode.53 WO3 nanoparticles were homogeneously coated on vertically aligned MWCNTs by magnetron sputtering. Potentiometric pH response of the WO3/MWCNTs electrode in Britton-Robinson buffers reveals a linear working range from pH 2 to 12 with a slope of about −41 mV pH−1 and a response time less than 90 s (Fig. 5). The stability of the electrode remained over a month. Moreover, the WO3/MWCNTs electrode displays excellent anti-interference property. Compared to conventional pH sensors, the pH sensor based on a WO3/MWCNTs nanocomposite electrode also shows excellent reproducibility, high stability and superb selectivity, which could be attributed to the high chemical and thermal stability of MWCNTs and high selectivity of WO3. Another novel solid-state pH sensor based on RuO2/MWCNTs nanocomposite electrode presents a near-Nernstian response (−55 mV/pH) and shorter response time (less than 40 s) than the WO3/MWCNTs electrode,54 which can be ascribed to the different intrinsic properties of the oxides.

In brief, the attachment of metal oxide nanoparticles on CNTs greatly improves the dispersibility and enhances the conductivity as well. In other words, modification of CNTs with metal oxides not only increases their catalytic activity, but also improves their selectivity and sensitivity for electroanalysis. The loading of metal oxides on CNTs with various electrochemical activities to different target molecules will greatly enhance the applications of the oxide-based electrodes with versatile properties. Electroanalysis results based on some CNTs-oxide composite electrodes are summarized in Table 1.

Photocatalysis and charge transfer properties of CNTs-supported semiconductive oxides
Because of their large surface area, high thermal and chemical stability, CNTs have also been considered as an ideal support to facilitate dispersion of catalyst particles,55 like many other carbon materials. Except for their large surface area, CNTs have a variety of electrical properties. SWCNTs can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on their chiralty, while MWCNTs usually possess good conductivity. CNTs supported semiconductive oxides such as TiO2 and ZnO have been prepared and used for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants or for photoelectrical devices.56–60 The most attractive characteristic is that the CNT-supported catalysts are believed to exhibit cooperative or synergetic effects between carbon nanotubes and those semiconductive metal oxides. Because of their large electron-storage capacity (one electron for every 32 carbon atoms), CNTs may accept photon-excited electrons from nanostructured semiconductive oxides, thus retarding or hindering the recombination of electrons and holes. The conductive structure of the CNTs scaffolds is believed to promote the separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs by formation of heterojunctions at the CNTs-semiconductor interface. For example, as an n-type semiconductor, photogenerated electrons in TiO2 may move freely towards the CNTs surface and excess of valence band holes is left in the TiO2 to migrate to the surface and react with H2O or OH− to produce active species such as OH˙, as illustrated in Fig. 6A. In addition, CNTs provide spatial confinement and large supporting surface areas for TiO2, which guarantees the highest exposure to the light and provides abundant reaction sites for degradation reactions, leading to faster observed reaction rates. The loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on the CNTs may also minimize the light reflections and improve the quantum efficiency. With the help of surfactant, a thin layer of TiO2 was evenly coated on the CNTs, which showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.19 The superior photocatalytic activity has been attributed to the optimal dispersion of TiO2 and optimal absorption of photons, since a much larger surface area of TiO2 is exposed to photons either directly or by photon scattering within the suspension. It is noted that the good interfacial combination of semiconductors and CNTs is essential for efficient charge transfer and high activity of the composite catalysts. For instance, Jiang and Gao have reported ZnO-nanocrystal-coated MWCNTs exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity than bulk ZnO or the mechanical mixture of ZnO and MWCNTs.56
 Fig. 6  The proposed mechanisms for the photocatalysis of the hybrid CNT-TiO2. (A) The CNT serves as an electron sink, and scavenges away the electron hindering its recombination with a hole. (B) The CNT acts as a photosensitizer, where the electron is excited and then inject into the conduction band of TiO2, followed by electron back-transfer to the CNT with the formation of a hole in the valence band of TiO2, generating a O2− or a OH˙ species, respectively. 
It is surprising that the TiO2-CNTs nanocomposites are active under visible light irradiation even though that TiO2 is only UV active because of its wide bandgap (3.2 eV).17,18 This effect was explained in terms of CNTs acting as photosensitizer rather than adsorbent and dispersing reagent. The fact that the effect is stronger for the composite material than for the mechanical mixture of CNTs and TiO2 constituting in the same ratio supports the existence of the synergy effect. In such case, CNTs are sensitized under visible light irradiation. The photogenerated electron in a CNT is injected to the conduction band of the TiO2, allowing for the formation of superoxide radical by adsorbed molecular oxygen. Once this happens, the positively charged nanotube removes an electron from the valence band of the TiO2 leaving a hole which can then react with adsorbed water to form a hydroxyl radical. The proposed mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 6B.17 On the other hand, the visible light activity of the TiO2/CNTs catalysts could also be attributed to doping of TiO2 by carbon. Chen et al. used XPS to characterize the TiO2/CNTs catalysts and found that bonds of Ti–C and Ti–O–C were formed after being calcined.57 The presence of TiO2−xCx units could be one of the reasons responsible for the photoelectrocatalytic activity under illumination of visible light. More evidence is needed to clarify the photocatalytic mechanism under visible light irradiation.
The charge separation and transportation properties of the CNTs-semiconductor hybrids were quantitatively analyzed by photoelectrochemical studies. Vietmeyer et al. described a methodology to anchor ZnO nanoparticles onto functionalized SWCNTs.22 The ZnO/SWCNT nanocomposite films are photoelectrochemically active and exhibit high photoconversion efficiency compared to that of mesoscopic ZnO films. The SWCNT network was found to facilitate the dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles and decrease overall charge-transfer resistance for the electrode. Under irradiation of UV light, the ZnO nanoparticles undergo charge separation and inject electrons with a rate constant of 1 × 108 s−1. Both emission spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical measurements confirm the involvement of the conducting carbon nanotube scaffold in facilitating the charge collection and charge transportation in the ZnO/SWCNT composite film. This phenomenon also occurs in the heterojunction of ZnO nanowires (ZnO-NWs) and MWCNTs arrays (Fig. 7).58 Compared to the pure ZnO-NWs on tantalum substrate, the charge transfer rate of the ZnO–NW/MWCNT heterojunction is remarkably enhanced because of the MWCNTs. The Mott-Schottky plot displays a high donor density of 3.9 × 1019 cm−3, a flat band potential of −0.8 V and a space charge layer of 7 nm. In addition, the ZnO-NW/MWCNT nanocomposite yields a higher photocurrent than pure ZnO-NWs (Fig. 8). The decay constant of the ZnO-NW/MWCNT nanocomposite is also lower than that of its pure counterpart. This is attributed to the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs in the ZnO-NWs/MWCNTs heterojunction being hindered and retarded, thus the photoelectrical conversion efficiency is enhanced. Fig. 9 illustrates the charge separation and transportation at the ZnO–NWs/MWCNTs heterojunction.

In general, CNTs are helpful for hybrid materials to retard the recombination of photon-excited electrons and holes, and promote the separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which makes them to be photoactive and exhibit high photoconversion efficiency. Further studies are needed to clarify the interaction of carbon nanotubes with the metal oxides in order to develop photocatalysts with high performance.
The hybrid of TiO2 and CNTs was also used as collecting electrode in a solar cell with superior performance.61 The efficiency of the incident photon conversion to charge carrier shows a significant enhancement when SWCNTs are used as the support for the deposition of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Nearly doubling of the photoconversion efficiency is an indication of the improved charge collection efficiency using a SWCNTs network. Apart from that, when the acid-treated SWCNTs (a-SWCNTs) were incorporated in the TiO2 film, the short-circuit photocurrent increased by 25% than that of the unmodified cell, which was correlated with improved connectivity between the a-SWCNTs and the TiO2 particles and with enhanced light scattering by TiO2 clusters formed in the presence of the a-SWCNTs.62 The semiconductor-CNTs nanocomposites also find application for gas sensor with enhanced conductivity and low working temperature. A gas sensor based on MWCNT/SnO2 core/shell nanostructures synthesized by a simple wet-chemical method exhibits enhanced ethanol sensing properties at working temperature of 300 °C.63 Khanderi et al. constructed a ZnO/MWCNT gas sensor for detecting CO by in situ synthesis. The nanostructured ZnO/MWCNTs composite shows a better sensing performance when compared to the bare MWCNTs for the detection of low CO levels (20–200 ppm).64 In such cases, CNTs served as conducting scaffold to facilitate charge collection and charge transportation in the nanostructured semiconductor films. Other hybrid materials include immobilization of rare earth oxide nanophosphors onto the sidewalls of CNTs, and the resulting hybrid materials present luminescent emission under irradiation.65,66 The nanophosphors-functionalized carbon nanotubes may find applications in novel optical devices that use carbon nanotubes as building blocks. They can also be used as biomarkers and drug carriers for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
The applications, composition and functions of the hybrid materials based on carbon nanotubes and metal oxides are summarized in Table 2.

Conclusion
The unique structure and physical properties of CNTs provide a scaffold for construction of CNT-oxide hybrid materials, which greatly promote the applications of CNTs for storage and conversion of energy, for electroanalysis and photocatalysis. The interface interaction of the metal oxides with CNTs plays a critical role for the high performance of the hybrid materials. The primary material science challenge is to tailor and synthesize high quantities of uniform composite and further research into their applications for energy storage and photocatalysts, and to fully understand the charge transfer properties of the hybrid materials of CNTs and semiconductive oxides. Studies on the heterojunction of a semiconductive oxide and a single SWCNT with defined electronic structure will precisely reveal their interaction, which will be beneficial for designing hybrid materials for specific applications. Further development will be creation of field effect transistors based on single SWCNT modified by oxide nanoparticles as photoelectrical nano devices. On the other hand, modification of CNTs with functional groups will facilitate the CNTs-oxides hybrid materials to selectively adsorb some target molecules, which is helpful to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the hybrid materials for electroanalysis and to improve the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts. Apart from the aforementioned, incorporation of the hybrids of CNTs-oxides into polymeric matrices will result in the nanocomposites with multifunctions, such as improved mechanical properties, flame-retarding and radar-adsorbing properties, which will certainly greatly enrich materials science and nanotechnology.
