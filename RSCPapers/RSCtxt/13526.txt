Oxygen-containing group surface-fuctionalized activated carbon was used to absorb the palladium precursor PdCl42−, and small sized (1.92 ± 0.75 nm) Pd nanoparticles were formed in Pd/C-PC, which were smaller than those prepared by low pressure cold plasma (4.0–4.5 nm). The results of XRD, XPS, TPR and TEM showed that dry plasma with calcination could completely remove the residual Cl− ions and obtain predominantly metallic Pd nanoparticles without aggregation. The dry plasma prepared Pd/C-PC catalyst gave excellent catalytic activity for CO oxidation, and the TOF value for 5 wt% Pd/C-PC was about 6.1 times as that for 6 wt% Pd/graphene prepared by the conventional impregnation and hydrogen reduction method. The high performance was attributed to the smaller size and predominantly metallic Pd nanoparticles.
1. Introduction
Supported noble metal catalysts play an important role in extensive applications. In order to reduce the use of the expensive metals and facilitate the distribution of the metal atoms, many attempts were made, such as functionalization of the supports. Due to the functional groups on the surface of the supports, metal ions can be adsorbed and intercalated into the sheets and pores to form thermally stable composite materials.1 For example, Jang and his colleagues prepared SiO2 supported Au and Au–Ag bimetallic catalysts by using amine group surface-functionalized SiO2 to absorb the gold and silver precursors to prepare small size-controlled metallic nanoparticles.1b,c Activated carbons with a high specific surface area and tunable pore size have drawn much research attention in both fundamental and practical applications.2 As a result of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon and its unique properties, activated carbon is expected to be an excellent supporting material, and activated carbon supported noble metal catalysts have been extensively applied for fine chemical syntheses, hydrogen storage, and electrocatalysis.3 In addition, a major advantage of activated carbon supported catalysts is that noble metals can be easily recovered from the used catalysts.
In recent years, activated carbon supported palladium catalysts (Pd/C) were widely used in the oxidation of organic compounds,4 selective hydrogenation,5 electrochemical catalysis6 and CO oxidation.7 The Pd/C catalysts are normally prepared by chemical reduction methods using formaldehyde or NaBH4 as the reducing chemicals, which are not environmentally friendly. In addition, they require additional washing and drying steps for removing the organic reagents and the adsorbed water, which decrease the catalytic activity of the dry Pd/C catalysts.
Plasma has also been used to prepare supported metal nanoparticles (NPs), while Au- and Pt-NPs deposited on carbon nanotubes have been successfully synthesized using the liquid-plasma reduction technique.8 Although the metal NPs showed excellent performance, the technique is not only complex but also expensive because of the use of an ionic liquid and the necessity of a purification step. Dry plasma reduction (DPR) has also been applied for preparing supported metal NPs,9 and reducing graphene oxides using hydrogen and ammonia gas.10 Liu et al. prepared Pd/C3a and Pd/SBA-1511 using Ar or O2 direct current (DC) glow discharge plasmas at low pressure. Jang et al. prepared Pd/TiO2 catalysts by non-thermal radio frequency (RF) plasma at low pressure.12 These catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity. Choi et al. synthesized high performance supported platinum nanoparticles for flexible dye-sensitized solar cells by RF plasma at atmospheric pressure.13 However, these dry plasma reduction methods were usually operated under low pressure and (or) incorporated with sophisticated discharge systems.
In order to solve these problems, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma was employed. DBD is a simple and easily operated approach for generating atmospheric-pressure cold plasma, and has been used to reduce metal ions.14 Xu et al.14b synthesized well-dispersed Pd nanoparticles with a particle size of 1–3.5 nm supported on graphene sheets. The as-prepared catalyst showed higher catalytic efficiency in the carbonyl sulfide hydrogenation. Our group prepared TiO2 supported noble metal (Ag, Pt) photocatalysts15 by DBD cold plasma at atmospheric pressure. The results showed that atmospheric-pressure DBD cold plasma was a fast and facile method for preparing TiO2 supported noble metal photocatalysts with enhanced activity. However, using atmospheric-pressure cold plasma to prepare supported Pd catalyst on low-cost and easy to get activated carbon has not been reported.
In this study, high performance Pd/C catalysts were successfully fabricated by a simple and environmentally-friendly dry plasma reduction method. The size of the Pd nanoparticles, T100 (100% CO conversion), the apparent activation energies and the turnover frequencies (TOF) of the Pd/C catalysts in this work were compared with selected published results, and the reasons for the high performance were analyzed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
Prior to the Pd/C catalyst preparation, the activated carbon (40–60 mesh, Beijing Guanghua Timber Mill.) was pre-oxidized with 30 wt% HNO3 at 85 °C for 5 h, and then washed with deionized water and dried at 120 °C for 2 h. The BET surface area of the activated carbon was 852 m2 g−1.
A solution of tetrachloropalladinic acid (H2PdCl4) was prepared by adding a certain amount of PdCl2 (99%, Reagent no. 1 Factory of Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) into HCl aqueous solution (1.9 M) under stirring and heating until complete dissolution. The AC was impregnated with the H2PdCl4 solution for 12 h and dried at 100 °C for 2 h. Then the resultant sample was treated by atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) cold plasma. In order to remove the chloride ions, part of the Pd/C catalyst prepared by DBD plasma was washed with deionized water, and then dried at 120 °C for 3 h (denoted as Pd/C-PW), and another part was calcined at 300 °C in H2 for 2 h (denoted as Pd/C-PC). For comparison, the Pd/TiO2-PC sample was prepared by DBD plasma reduction and H2 calcination under the same conditions as for Pd/C-PC. All the loading amounts of metal Pd were 5.0 wt% in this study.
The schematic diagram of the atmospheric-pressure DBD cold plasma device for preparing Pd/C catalysts had been described previously.15a,b Briefly, a reaction cell made of quartz was placed between the high-voltage electrode and the ground electrode, both of which were made of stainless steel (50 mm in diameter). The discharge gap was 4 mm. The power source (CTP-2000K, Nanjing Suman Electronic Co. Ltd) was capable of supplying a bipolar sine wave output with 0–40 kV peak-to-peak voltage (Up–p) at a frequency of 7.5–30 kHz. A mixture of Ar (>99.999%) and H2 (>99.999%) with a total flow rate of 100 ml min−1 was used as the working gas. In the gas mixture, the H2 content was 50%. Before the cold plasma treatment, 0.3 g Pd/C was uniformly put in the reaction tank. The plasma treatment was conducted by applying a 36 kV sine-wave high voltage at a frequency of 14.1 kHz for 6 min.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
Pore size distributions, BET surface areas and pore volumes were measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption using an ASAP2010 gas sorption analyzer (Micrometritics Instrument Corp.). Prior to the adsorption analysis, the samples were outgassed at 300 °C for 3 h in the degas port of the adsorption analyzer. The sorption data were analyzed using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model with the Halsey equation.16 XRD characterization of the Pd/C samples was carried out using a rotating anode X-ray diffractometer (DX-2700, Dandong Haoyuan, China) with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å). The chemical compositions of the samples were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAN250 Thermo VG) using a monochromatized AlKα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. All binding energies were referenced to the XPS peak of carbon 1s at 284.6 eV. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were carried out with a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 Automated Catalyst Characterization System using a 30 ml min−1 flow of a H2–Ar mixture (10%H2). 180 mg of catalyst was used. Before each experiment, the catalyst was pretreated at 600 °C in Ar gas flow for 0.5 h, then cooled to 50 °C. Subsequently, the Ar gas flow was switched to the H2–Ar mixture, and the reduction was performed from 50 to 800 °C at a constant rate of 10 °C min−1. The rate of H2 gas consumption was monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, G2 spirit, Hong Kong) at 200 kV accelerating voltage.
2.3 Activity test
The temperature-dependent CO oxidation was performed in a quartz tube (4 mm i.d., 6.0 mm o.d.) at atmospheric pressure with 10 mg catalyst. The reaction was started in a flowing CO–O2 mixture (1.0 vol% CO, 20.0 vol% O2, balance N2) at a 20 ml min−1 flow rate over the temperature range of 30–280 °C. All data were acquired after 30 min reaction time to allow the attainment of the steady state. The effluent was then analyzed online using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with a TDX-01 column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
The turnover frequency (TOF) was defined as the number of CO converted over one surface-active Pd atom per second:  where MCO and MPd are the amount of CO and Pd in the feed (mol), respectively, X is the conversion of CO, D is the Pd dispersion estimated from the TEM mean particle diameters, assuming spherical particles,17 and t is the reaction time (s).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the samples
The XRD patterns of the activated carbon, Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW were observed, as shown in Fig. 1. The broad diffraction peaks at 25.0° and 43.5° for all of the samples exhibited a carbon structure of activated carbon. Meanwhile, these peaks were obviously decreased as a result of the supported Pd nanoparticles. The Pd peaks at 40.1°, 46.6°, 68.1° and 82.4° were attributed to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes of the face-centered cubic structure of Pd (JCPDS card, file no. 46–1043), respectively. The main Pd (111) peak in Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW suggested that a crystal phase was formed. However, the Pd peaks for Pd/C-PC were weaker than that for Pd/C-PW, which may be due to the aggregation of the Pd nanoparticles in Pd/C-PW by washing with deionized water and (or) the partial reduction of Pd ions resulting from the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of activated carbon.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the activated carbon, Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW. 
In order to further investigate the chemical binding states and compositions of the Pd/C samples, XPS spectra of (a) Pd 3d, (b) C 1s, (c) O 1s and (d) Cl 2p in Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW were collected and shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that Cl− ions in Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW could be completely removed by calcination in H2 or washing with deionized water (Fig. 2d). In Fig. 2b, C 1s spectra were illustrated which could be deconvoluted into four peaks, ascribed to C–C, C–OH, CO and COOH in activated carbon, respectively.18 Correspondingly, the O 1s spectra could be deconvoluted into four peaks, attributed to C–OH, CO and COOH, respectively. These oxygen-containing functional groups were important for the distribution of the Pd nanoparticles.19 Pd20 and PdO21 were thought to be the active forms of Pd catalysts for CO oxidation. The XPS spectra of Pd 3d in these three samples could be fitted with three peaks corresponding to Pd in three different kinds of chemical states, metallic Pd, Pd(II) and Pd(IV).22 These indicated that Pd ions were not completely reduced to the metallic state for both the samples, this was not in line with the Pd/TiO2-PC, in which TiO2 supported Pd ions could be completely reduced to their metallic states (Fig. S1†). In addition, the Pd(IV) spectra in Pd/C-PW were higher than those in Pd/C-PC without the thermal reduction of H2 gas. This difference may be attributed to the influence of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the activated carbon support after the treatment of HNO3 (Fig. 2b and c).

TPR profiles of Pd/C-PW, Pd/C-PC and Pd/TiO2-PC are illustrated in Fig. 3. The negative peaks observed around 70 °C in Pd/C-PW and Pd/TiO2-PC correspond to desorption from surface metallic Pd of the H2 adsorbed at room temperature at the beginning of the analysis. The relative intensities of these peaks correlated with the size of Pd nanoparticles in each sample, with the Pd/C-PW catalyst having the larger H2 desorption peak. The disappearance of such a peak in Pd/C-PC revealed that the Pd species existed as very small nanoparticles.23 From Fig. 3, we can also see that the positive peaks observed at around 150 °C and 600 °C in Pd/C-PW and Pd/TiO2-PC, which correspond to H2 consumption by PdOx reduction and the reduction of the oxygen-containing functional groups, respectively.24 The significant reduction process at around 150 °C in Pd/C-PW may be ascribed to the existence of many PdO2 species. However, no obvious peak was observed in Pd/TiO2-PC as a result of the fact that Pd was exclusively metallic (Fig. S1†). The TPR data were consistent with the results of XRD and XPS, which allowed us to safely conclude that Pd in Pd/C-PC was predominantly metallic, while many PdO2 species were formed in Pd/C-PW.

The morphological structures were further observed by TEM (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the average diameter of the Pd nanoparticles (Dmean) and the standard deviation (STD) were also obtained by analyzing numerous TEM images. Pd nanoparticles were 1.92 ± 0.75 nm, 15.93 ± 5.42 nm and 6.95 ± 1.93 nm in diameter for Pd/C-PC, Pd/C-PW and Pd/TiO2-PC, respectively. Smaller Pd nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed on the surface of activated carbon for Pd/C-PC, which was much smaller than that prepared by low pressure cold plasma (4.0–4.5 nm).3a However, by washing with deionized water, the highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles were aggregated on the surface of activated carbon for Pd/C-PW, which indicated that conventional wet methods were inefficient to obtain dry Pd/C catalysts with highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles by simple washing with deionized water. This was consistent with the results of XRD, XPS and TPR. These results also showed that Pd nanoparticles were uniformly embedded in the activated carbon and the size of the Pd nanoparticles were nearly the same for Pd/C-PC, which may be attributed to the enhanced metal-support interaction resulting from the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon (Fig. 2).1b These strong interactions inhibited the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles on the activated carbon surface. In other words, this dry plasma reduction method followed by thermal treatment was highly suitable for preparing small particle size and highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles on activated carbon. The results of TEM were in line with the TPR analyses.

3.2 Activity of the Pd/C samples

Fig. 5 shows the CO oxidation activity of Pd/C-PC and Pd-PW in the temperature range of 30–200 °C. Under the reaction conditions, the CO conversion increased gradually with the increase in temperature. Besides, a sharp increase could be observed for Pd-PC and Pd-PW when the temperature was close to T100 (100% CO conversion). T100 could be achieved at 105 °C and 180 °C, respectively, over Pd-PC and Pd-PW. Obviously, the activity of the Pd/C samples for CO oxidation followed the order: Pd/C-PC > Pd/C-PW.
 Fig. 5  (a) CO conversion over activated carbon, Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW, and (b) the corresponding Arrhenius plots. 
According to the data taken from Fig. 5a, the Arrhenius plots are shown in Fig. 5b. Good linear relationships were observed. The CO oxidation for Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW may be mainly via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism, where the chemisorbed CO reacted with the chemisorbed oxygen.25 The apparent activation energies (Ea) for Pd/C-PC and Pd/C-PW, which could be obtained from the slopes of the plots, were 57.8 ± 1.7 kJ mol−1 and 132.0 ± 6.0 kJ mol−1, respectively.
The size of the Pd nanoparticles, T100 (100% CO conversion) and the apparent activation energies of different catalysts and selected published results for comparison are presented in Table 1. Interestingly, the T100 for 5 wt% Pd/C-PC in this work is 22 °C lower than that for 6 wt% Pd/graphene26 and 5 wt% Pd/SBA-15.11

To gain insight into the intrinsic activities of the Pd/C catalysts, the turnover frequencies (TOF) normalized as the number of CO molecules reacting per active site per second are also depicted in the table. It can be seen that the TOF values also followed the order: Pd/C-PC > Pd/C-PW. Interestingly, the TOF value for Pd/C-PC was about 6.1 times as that for the 6 wt% Pd/graphene prepared by the conventional impregnation and hydrogen reduction method.26 The high performance may be attributed to the smaller size and predominantly metallic Pd nanoparticles. This simple dry plasma reduction method would be also a highly useful technique for fabricating other activated carbon supported noble metals.
4. Conclusions
In this study, a high performance Pd/C catalyst was successfully prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation followed by the process of dry plasma reduction and calcination (Pd/C-PC). The results indicated that conventional wet methods were inefficient to obtain dry Pd/C catalysts with smaller size and highly dispersed Pd nanoparticles by simple washing with deionized water. The XPS, TPR and TEM analyses showed that the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon facilitated the distribution of the Pd nanoparticles. The CO oxidation for Pd/C-PC followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism, and the apparent activation energy (Ea) for Pd/C-PC was 57.8 ± 1.7 kJ mol−1. Interestingly, the TOF value for 5 wt% Pd/C-PC was about 6.1 times as that for the 6 wt% Pd/graphene prepared by the conventional impregnation and hydrogen reduction method. The high performance may be attributed to the smaller size and predominantly metallic Pd nanoparticles. This study developed an efficient method for preparing activated carbon supported Pd catalysts with high performance for CO conversion, which may have potential application for preparing other activated carbon supported noble metals.
