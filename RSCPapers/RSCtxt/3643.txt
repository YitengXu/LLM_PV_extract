    , Accepted 13th May 2014First published on 21st May 2014AbstractWe have demonstrated that, by changing the substituent groups on dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT), one could effectively and rationally tune the energy levels, optical band gaps and charge transporting properties, etc. of the DTDBT derivatives (DTBDTs) and their conjugated polymers (CPs) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives.
Introduction
Since the discovery of ultrafast photo-induced charge transfer between conjugated polymers (CPs) and fullerene,1 the polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells (PVCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential application in large area, flexible, and low-cost solar cells.2 Tremendous efforts, such as development of novel low band gap (LBG) CPs,3–16 optimization of the fabricating process,17 modification of the morphology of the donor and acceptor blend, etc.,18,19 have been devoted to improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PVCs. Among them, the development of high performance donor–acceptor (D–A) type LBG CPs has been demonstrated to be the most vigorous approach to achieve efficient PVCs, and many promising D–A type LBG CPs have been developed in the last few decades.3–16,20–30 The most attractive samples are benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based CPs.20–30 For instance, Huang and co-workers have reported a new and interesting BDT-based polymer (PBDT-DTNT) with naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazoles as the new electron acceptor moieties exhibiting high PCEs in the range of 6.0–8.4%.25,26 Hou and Yang et al. have demonstrated a series of LBG CPs based on BDT, and the PCEs of 5.63–8.4% have been achieved in PVCs from polymers.27–29
As a notable aromatic analogue of BDT, dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) not only shows a similar HOMO level to BDT, but also holds a larger coplanar core and an extended conjugation length.31–35 It was believed to provide advantageous properties for DTBDT-based CPs, such as enhanced charge-carrier mobility, decreased band gaps and facilitated exciton separation into free charge carriers, in contrast to BDT-based CPs.33 In 2012, Hou et al. firstly reported a LBG CP (PDTT) based on 5,10-di(2-hexyldecyl-oxy)-DTBDT, and a PCE of 3.6% was achieved in the PVCs from PDTT.32 Lately, Yu et al. presented a series of LBG CPs based on 5,10-dialkyl-DTBDT (PTDBD2 etc.),33 and Hou et al. demonstrated a polymer based on 5,10-di(5-(2-ethyl-hexylthieno-2-yl)-DTBDT) (PDT-S-T).34 And the PCEs of 7.3–7.6% have been achieved in PVCs from PTDBD2 and PDT-S-T.33,34 More recently, Kwon et al. have demonstrated that flanking of DTBDTs by alkylthieno-2-yl not only increased charge-carrier mobilities, but also decreased the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of CPs based on alkylthieno2-yl-flanked DTBDTs, thus increasing the open circuit voltage (Voc), short current density (Jsc) and PCEs of PVCs from polymers as compared with those in the PVCs from the CPs based on alkyloxy-flanked DTBDTs.35 However, the investigation of DTBDT-based CPs is still insufficient as compared with the well and intensively investigated BDT-based CPs so far.
In this paper, we demonstrated that the optoelectronic properties of DTBDTs and the CPs derived from DTBDTs and DPP could effectively and rationally be tuned via flanking of DTBDTs by alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl, and trialkylsilylethynyl substituent groups. It was found that, HOMO levels of DTBDTs were deepened from −5.21 eV to −5.36 eV and then dropped to −5.65 eV, and HOMO levels of the three CPs based on the DTBDTs and DPP (named as PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16, respectively) were deepened from −5.13 eV to −5.19 eV and then dropped to −5.25 eV, while the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by the alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthineo-2-yl and tri-iso-propylsilylethynyl (TIPS) substituent groups. Meanwhile, it was also found that the flanking of DTBDTs by the TIPS substituent group provided PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 exhibiting the lowest HOMO level, the narrowest band gap and comparatively higher mobility among the three DTBDT-based CPs. As a consequence, the PVCs based on the PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blend show the highest Voc (0.75 V vs. 0.62 V and 0.65 V), the highest Jsc (13.9 mA cm−2vs. 6.41 mA cm−2 and 12.79 mA cm−2) and PCE (6.39% vs. 2.42% and 5.19%) in the optimized PVCs using PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16, PBT-HD-DPP-C16 and/or PBT-T-DPP-C12 as electron donor materials and PC71BM as the electron acceptor material, respectively. The PCE of 6.39% has been achieved in the PVCs from PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G).
Results and discussion
1. Synthesis and structural characterization of DTBDT derivatives

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis routes to DTBDT derivatives. Dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-5,10-dione (I) was synthesized by the optimized procedure reported previously (see ESI†).35 5,10-Di(alkyloxy)-DTBDTs (IIa–d) were synthesized by the following procedure: the dione (I) was successively treated with zinc powder in the presence of NaOH aqueous solution and alkyl bromide to obtain 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT (IIa–d). DTBDT-TIPS, DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-T were synthesized by the following procedure: the dione (I) was treated with TIPS lithium, trimethylsilylethynyl (TMS) lithium or 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl lithium, followed by reduction and dehydration with tin dichloride and hydrochloric acid (10%) to generate DTBDT-TIPS, DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-T, respectively. The 2,7-bis(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-di(2-hexyldecyloxy)-DTBDT (III), 2,7-di(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-bis(4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl)-DTBDT (IV) and 2,7-di(trimethylstannyl)-5,10-bis(tri-iso-propylsilylethynyl)-DTBDT (V) were synthesized by the following procedure: IId, DTBDT-T and/or DTBDT-TIPS were first reacted with n-BuLi in anhydrous THF at 0 °C, and then a solution of trimethylstannyl chloride in anhydrous THF was added to one portion to produce compound III, IV and/or V in the yield of 53–60%, respectively. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR (see ESI†), FBA-MS and elemental analyses.

Four single crystals of the resulting DTBDT derivatives (DTBDT-C4, DTBDT-C8, DTBDT-C12 and DTBDT-TMS) were obtained by slow evaporation of the chloroform/n-hexane solution. Fig. 1 shows that the 5,10-di-(butyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT-C4) molecule exhibits the fully planar geometric structure. And the other molecules such as DTBDT-C8, DTBDT-C12, and DTBDT-TMS also exhibit the fully planar geometric structure (see ESI, Fig. S1–S3 and Table S1†). The coplanar area of 21.0 Å2 and the conjugation length of 10.5 Å for the DTBDT-C4 core are larger than those for BDT (13.2 Å2 and 7.0 Å, respectively) (see ESI, Fig. S4 and Table S2†).36 And the bonding geometry for extending the conjugated system through the two terminal unsubstituted α-positions of DTBDT-C4 is associated with the ca. 180° bend, which is similar to that of BDT (see ESI, Fig. S5†).36 It was noted that different flanking substituent groups have little effect on geometry, conjugated plane area and conjugated length of the central core of DTBDT-based compounds (see ESI, Table S2†).

The UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT (DTBDT-C4 and DTBDT-C8), DTBDT-TMS, DTBDT-TIPS and DTBDT-T are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT derivatives (DTBDT-C4 and DTBDT-C8) show absorption bands in the region of 300–395 nm with onset band gap wavelength at 395 nm in dichloromethane (DCM) solution. The PL emission peaks of 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT derivatives are at around 402 nm in DCM solution. The DTBDT-T shows absorption bands in the region of 300–410 nm with onset band gap wavelength at 410 nm, and the PL emission peak of DTBDT-T is at 434 nm in DCM solution. The DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-TIPS exhibit absorption bands in the region of 300–420 nm with onset band gap wavelength at 420 nm. The PL emission peaks of DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-TIPS are at 425 nm in DCM solution. The optical band gaps of 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT (DTBDT-C4 and DTBDT-C8), DTBDT-T, DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-TIPS in DCM solution are about 3.13 eV, 3.02 eV, 2.96 eV, and 2.95 eV, respectively. Compared with the 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT, the onset band gap wavelengths and PL peaks of DTBDT-TMS, DTBDT-TIPS and DTBDT-T are red-shifted. It could be attributed to the promotion of π-orbital overlap between the trialkylsilylethynyl or 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl moieties and the DTBDT core.

The electrochemical behaviors of DTBDTs were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN–DCM (1:1) with the glass carbon and Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the working and reference electrode, respectively. The first oxidation potentials of 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT derivatives (DTBDT-C4 and DTBDT-C8), DTBDT-T, DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-TIPS, are about +0.55 V, +0.55 V, 0.79 V, +1.01 and 1.00 V, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S6†). The redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) under the above-mentioned condition is +0.14 V, which is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV to vacuum for calibration (see ESI, Fig. S7†). So the HOMO levels of 5,10-di(alkyloxy)-DTBDT, DTBDT-T, DTBDT-TMS and DTBDT-TIPS are −5.21 eV, −5.36 eV, −5.66 eV and −5.65 eV, respectively (Fig. 3). It could be found that the HOMO levels of the DTBDTs were successively deepened as the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and trialkylsilyl-ethynyl substituent groups. The HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of DTBDT derivatives were also simulated by using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 with a hybrid B3LYP correlation functional and a split valence 6-31G* basis set. The optimized molecular geometries of the models and calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are shown in Fig. 3. The calculated HOMO and LUMO levels of DTBDTs were also successively deepened while the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and TIPS substituent groups. All the CV experimental and computational results confirmed that the HOMO energy levels of DTBDT derivatives could be fine tuned via flanking of DTBDTs with alkyloxy, trialkylsilylethynyl and alkylthieno-2-yl substituent groups. And the trialkylsilylethynyl-flanked DTBDT exhibited the lowest HOMO energy level as compared with those of alkyloxy and alkyklthieno-yl-flanked DTBDTs. It should contribute to the electron-withdrawing sp hybridization triple bond in the trialkylsilylethynyl group in contrast to the electron-rich units such as alkyloxy and dalkylthieno-2-yl.

2. Synthesis and characterization of the conjugated polymers
To investigate the influence of flanking DTBDT by the substituent groups such as alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and/or TIPS on the optoelectronic properties of DTBDT-based CPs, three kinds of alternating LBG CPs with 5,10-di(2-hexyldecyloxy)-DTBDT, 5,10-bis(4,5-decylthieno-2-yl)-DTBDT and/or 5,10-bis(TIPS)-DTBDT as electron donor moieties and DPP as the electron acceptor moiety were synthesized and named as PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16, respectively (Scheme 2). The number-average molecular weights of the resulting polymers such as PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12, and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 range from 9.65 kDa to 20.06 kDa, and the polydisperse indices from 1.58 to 1.71 (Table 1). The decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight-loss) of the polymers range from 305.1 °C to 412.0 °C (see ESI, Fig. S8 and Table S1†).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in solid thin films were monitored on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer. The normalized absorption spectra of PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 in solid thin films are presented in Fig. 4a. As shown in Fig. 4a, PBT-HD-DPP-C16 shows two absorption peaks at 405 nm and 750 nm with a shoulder absorption peak at around 675 nm. PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 show similar absorption spectra except that the absorption peaks at short wavelengths are blue-shifted, and the absorption peaks at long wavelengths are red-shifted. The onset band gap wavelengths and optical band gaps of PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 are around 837 nm and 1.48 eV, 844 nm and 1.47 eV, 855 nm and 1.45 eV, respectively (Fig. 4a and Table 1).

The electrochemical behaviors of the polymer films were investigated by CV in a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile with glass carbon and Ag/AgNO3 electrodes as the working and reference electrodes, respectively. The onset oxidation potentials of PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 are, respectively, around +0.42 V, +0.48 V and +0.54 V (see ESI, Fig. S9†). The redox potential of Fc/Fc+ under the above-mentioned condition is +0.09 V, which is assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.8 eV to vacuum for calibration (see ESI, Fig. S10†). The HOMO and LUMO levels calculated by empirical formulae (EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) (eV) and ELUMO = −(|HOMO|−Eg) (eV))37,38 are −5.13 eV and −3.65 eV for PBT-HD-DPP-C16, −5.19 eV and −3.72 eV for PBT-T-DPP-C12, and −5.25 eV and −3.80 eV for PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 (Table 1 and Fig. 4b). It could be clearly found that the HOMO and LUMO levels of the CPs were successively deepened as the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by alkyloxy, 4,5-didecyl-thieno-2-yl and TIPS substituent groups.
Photovoltaic properties of the polymers were investigated by fabricating PVCs with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. Chlorobenzene (CB) was used as a solvent, and 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) was used as a solvent additive in the fabrication of PVCs. Initially, the blending weight ratios of PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM, PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM were optimized from 1:1 to 1:1.5. The photovoltaic parameters of PVCs are summarized in Table 2, and the J/V characteristics of the PVCs are plotted in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that the optimum ratio of PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM, PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM was 1:1.5. Under the optimal donor–acceptor, the PVCs based on PBT-HD-DPP-C16 show a PCE of 2.42% with a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 6.41 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 60.9%, the PVCs based on PBT-T-DPP-C12 shows a PCE of 5.19% with a Voc of 0.65 V, a Jsc of 12.61 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.7%, and the PVCs based on PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 shows a PCE of 6.39% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 13.9 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.3%. The Voc of PVCs based on the DTBDT-based CPs is successively increased while the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by the alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and TIPS substituent groups. It could be attributed to the deepening of the HOMO levels of DTBDT-based CPs, thus successively enlarging the differences between the LUMO energy level of PC71BM and the HOMO energy levels of the polymers (see ESI, Fig. 4b and S11†), while the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by the alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and TIPS substituent groups.

J/V characteristics (a) and EQE curves (b) of PVCs based on the DTBDT-based conjugated polymers–PC71BM. 
The incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) curves of the PVCs with the optimal donor–acceptor weight ratio are presented in Fig. 5b. The PVCs based on PBT-HD-DPP-C16 and PBT-T-DPP-C12 exhibited photo-response ranging from 280 nm to 890 nm, except that the IPCE of the PVCs based on PBT-HD-DPP-C16 is quite lower in the whole range than that of the PVCs based on PBT-T-DPP-C12. The PVCs based on PBT-T-DPP-C12 showed the photo-response ranging from 280 nm to 860 nm. According to the IPCEs of the PVCs, the integral current density values of the PVCs based on PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 are 6.25 mA cm−2, 13.21 mA cm−2 and 13.50 mA cm−2, respectively. The mismatch between the integral current densities and the Jsc values of the PVCs obtained from J–V measurement is within 5% (Table 2). This indicates that Jsc obtained from J–V measurements in this study are reliable.
To elucidate the mechanism by which the Jsc of the PVCs from PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 is dramatically enhanced as compared with that of the PVCs from PBT-HD-DPP-C16, the hole mobilities in the blends of polymers and PC71BM are measured and analyzed by using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method.28 The hole mobilities of PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM, PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM were found to be 8.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.78 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S12 and Table S3†). It could be found that the hole mobilities of the blends PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM are two orders of magnitude greater than that in the blend of PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM. The higher Jsc of PVCs based on PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM should be due to the higher hole mobilities in the blends of PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM as compared with that in the blend of PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM.
Conclusions
In this paper, we demonstrated that the optoelectronic properties of DTBDTs and CPs derived from DTBDTs and DPP could effectively and rationally be tuned via flanking of DTBDTs by alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl, and trialkylsilylethynyl substituent groups. The HOMO levels of DTBDTs were deepened from −5.21 eV to −5.36 eV and then dropped to −5.66 eV, and HOMO energy levels of the CPs based on DTBDTs (PBT-HD-DPP-C16, PBT-T-DPP-C12 and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16) were deepened from −5.13 eV to −5.19 eV and then dropped to −5.25 eV while the DTBDTs were accordingly flanked by the alkyloxy, 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl and TIPS substituent groups. Meanwhile, it was also found that the flanking of DTBDTs by the TIPS substituent group provided PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 exhibiting the lowest HOMO level, the narrowest band gap and comparatively high mobility among the three DTBDT-based CPs. As a consequence, the PVCs based on PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16 and PC71BM blend show the highest Voc, the highest Jsc and PCEs in the optimized PVCs using PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16, PBT-HD-DPP-C16 and/or PBT-T-DPP-C12 as electron donor materials and PC71BM as the electron acceptor material. In more general terms, we have shown that, by changing the substituent groups on the DTBDT, one can rationally tune the energy levels, optical band gap, charge transporting properties, etc. of the CPs based on DTBDTs. And the TIPS-flanked DTBDT is a more valuable electron donor block for the CPs in the application of photovoltaic devices as compared with the alkyloxy-flanked DTBDT and 4,5-didecylthieno-2-yl-flanked DTBDT.
Experimental section
1. Materials
All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich, Acros and TCI Chemical Co., and used as received. All the solvents were further purified under a nitrogen flow. Dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-5,10-dione (I) was synthesized by the procedure reported previously35 (see ESI†). 3,6-Bis(5-bromothineno-2-yl)-N,N′-bis(2-hexyl-decyl)-1,4-dioxopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole and 3,6-bis(5-bromo-thineno-2-yl)-N,N′-bis(2-butyloctyl)-1,4-dioxo-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole were synthesized by the reported procedure.39
2. General methods

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX 400 and JEOL ECS-400 spectrometers operating at 400 MHz with reference to tetramethylsilane. FAB-MS spectra were obtained on a VG ZAB-HS. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected at 296 K on a BRUKER SMART APEX II CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The polymerization reactions were carried out using a mono-microwave system (NOVA, PreeKem Scientific Instruments Co.) Analytical GPC was performed using a Waters GPC 2410 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with reference to polystyrene standards. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL Elemental Analysis Instrument (Elementar Co.) Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TGA 2050 (TA instruments) thermal analysils system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-2550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co.). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the DTBDTs was performed on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Co.) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with a nitrogen-saturated solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and dichloromethane (v:v, 1:1) with glass carbon and Ag/AgNO3 electrodes as the working and reference electrodes, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry of DTBDT-based CPs was performed under similar conditions to CV measurement of DTBDTs, except that acetonitrile was only used as a solvent. All the CV measurements of the DTBDTs and CPs based on DTBDTs were calibrated with Fc/Fc+.
3. Preparation and characterization of photovoltaic solar cells
A patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass with a sheet resistance of 10–15 Ω per square was cleaned by a surfactant scrub, followed by a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, initially with de-ionized water, followed by acetone and iso-propanol. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 5 min, a 40 nm thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and then dried by baking in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The active layer, with the thickness in the 70–80 nm range, was then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-casting from the chlorobenzene solution containing PBT-HD-DPP-C16/PC71BM (w/w, 1:1, 1:1.5), PBT-T-DPP-C12/PC71BM (w/w, 1:1, 1:1.5) and PBT-TIPS-DPP-C16/PC71BM (w/w, 1:1, 1:1.5). Then a 8 nm calcium and a 100 nm aluminium layer were evaporated with a shadow mask under a vacuum of (1–5) × 10−5 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and the anode defined the pixel size of the device of 0.1 cm2. The thickness of the evaporated cathode was monitored with a quartz crystal thickness/ratio monitor (SI-TM206, Shenyang Sciences Co.). Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the fabrication processes were carried out under a controlled atmosphere in a nitrogen dry-box (Etelux Co.) containing less than 1 ppm oxygen and moisture. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the resulting polymer solar cells were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5G (Air mass 1.5 global) conditions using a solar simulator (XES-70S1, San-EI Electric Co.) with irradiation of 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. The spectral responses of the devices were measured with a commercial EQE/incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) setup (7-SCSpecIII, Bejing 7-star Opt. In. Co.). A calibrated silicon detector was used to determine the absolute photosensitivity.
