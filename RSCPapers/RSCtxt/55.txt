    , Accepted 2nd December 2013First published on 4th December 2013AbstractReported is a systematic molecular structure–property relationship study to evaluate the consequences of dedicated H-bonding interactions between molecular electron donors on molecular assembly, absorption, charge collection, and performance in small-molecule bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices. Three families of branched quaterthiophene donor chromophores have been synthesized with members that share nearly identical electronic and optical properties in the molecularly dispersed state but are either capable or incapable of self-association by hydrogen bonding (H-bonding). Phthalhydrazide-functionalized quaterthiophenes are H-bond “active” and show signatures of H-bond promoted assembly in solution (by 1H NMR) and in both neat and blended (with C60) films (by IR). Compared to control compounds with H-bonding “turned off”, the H-bonded derivatives show red-shifted thin film absorption (neat and as blends with C60), different colors as bulk solids, and increased decomposition and melt temperatures. Photovoltaic devices made from blends of H-bonded donor molecules with C60 as the electron acceptor show improved charge collection length and external quantum efficiency resulting in a more than two-fold enhancement in power conversion efficiency relative to non-H-bonding controls, from 0.49% to 1.04%. We anticipate this approach could be generalized to include other donor chromophores with lower optical gap to harvest more longer-wavelength photons and achieve higher power conversion efficiencies.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technologies have the potential to provide a low-cost and scalable solution to solar energy conversion.1–10 The most efficient OPV devices are based on the “bulk heterojunction” (BHJ) active layer structure—a three-dimensional network formed from a mixture of an electron donor (typically a π-conjugated small molecule or polymer) and electron acceptor (typically a fullerene)—for efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation.11,12 Although it is understood that the donor/acceptor blend morphology critically influences device performance,13–17 it continues to defy most bottom-up engineering attempts. Consequently, many improvements in OPV power conversion efficiency (PCE) still come from processing optimization (e.g., additives, thermal/solvent annealing18–25) and/or trial-and-error modifications to molecular and device structure.26 An outstanding grand challenge is to develop self-assembly strategies to realize optimized supramolecular BHJ structure and device performance through rational molecular design.3,27–38 Here, we report a detailed molecular structure–property study showing the favorable consequences of self-complementary hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions between modified oligothiophene electron donors on molecular organization, absorption, charge collection, and performance in BHJ OPVs. The results work toward an overall goal to bottom-up engineer the optimum three-dimensional structure of the OPV active layer through a supramolecular approach.
It is well appreciated that H-bonding interactions can be used synergistically with π-stacking to induce the local and long-range organization of organic π-conjugated molecules in solution and the solid state.39–41 When applied to thin film device applications, H-bonding contacts between organic semiconductors have been shown to increase molecular/mechanical stability and charge mobility; some of the best examples come from field-effect transistor configurations.42,43 The use of H-bonding interactions to achieve favorable blend morphology and charge transport in BHJ OPVs has only been modestly explored. Complementary H-bonding contacts between modified fullerene electron acceptors and the side chains of polymer electron donors have been shown to improve nanoscale phase separation, morphological stability, and long-term device performance.44–48 Likewise, self-complementary H-bonding interactions between carboxyl-functionalized polythiophene side chains have been linked to enhancements in PCE (relative to unfunctionalized poly(3-hexylthiophene) or P3HT), although the results depend significantly on chain length.49 For small-molecule BHJ OPVs, the results have been mixed. Recent results by Holmes and coworkers50 suggest a role for self-complementary H-bonding between the cyanopyridone groups of molecular donors in modest increases in VOC (and fill factor) and PCE. H-bonding interactions between molecular donors have, in two other cases, been favorably implicated.51, 69 Unfavorable phase-separation, on the other hand, has been observed in the case of H-bonded barbituric acid derivatives, contributing to decreased charge transport as compared to non-H-bonding N-methyl derivatives.52 Additionally, for unsubstituted isoindigo-based donors blended with PCBM, intermolecular H-bonding has been suggested to “lock-in” an unfavorable BHJ morphology and lead to poor device performance.53
Needed in this area are systematic molecular structure–property studies that might facilitate the development of context-independent, H-bond directed molecular assembly approaches to optimized BHJ cells. Accordingly, we have envisioned studying a molecular donor appended with a robust H-bonding recognition group capable of forming bi-, tri-, or multi-molecular homomeric assemblies. Additionally required would be the complementary investigation of control molecules consisting of the same molecular donor incapable of H-bonded assembly. Showing the intrinsic similarity of the H-bonding and non-H-bonding congeners would then allow us to develop a relationship between molecular structure, aggregated structure, thin film properties, and photovoltaic device performance.
The molecules selected for this initial study—H-bond “active” (BQPH) and “inactive” (BQPME and BQPNMe) variants—are shown in Fig. 1. The parent branched quaterthiophene (BQ) chromophore, while not an optimal light absorbing unit for OPV applications due to its relatively large optical gap, could be prepared with either methyl (Me) or n-hexyl (Hex) solubilizing groups inspired by the work of Bäuerle and coworkers.54 Dendrimeric derivatives using BQ as a repeat unit exhibited a PCE of 1.24%.54 The phthalhydrazide (PH) heterocycle was selected as the H-bonding unit given its ability to form robust assemblies in solution, on surfaces, and in the bulk.55–57 Self-complementary H-bonding is known to occur for PH through the lactim–lactam tautomer (Fig. 1), and while both linear (ribbon-like) and cyclic assemblies are possible, the cyclic trimer has been identified in most studies. It has not escaped us that the columnar π-stacked architectures potentially formed from such cyclic structures might be uniquely shape-compatible with fullerene acceptors in an OPV blend.

Experimental section
Synthesis
Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. THF, ether, dichloromethane, and DMF were degassed in 20 L drums and passed through two sequential purification columns (activated alumina; molecular sieves for DMF) under a positive argon atmosphere. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on SiO2-60 F254 aluminum plates with visualization by UV light or staining. Flash column chromatography was performed using Purasil SiO2-60, 230–400 mesh from Whatman. Synthetic details can be found in the ESI.†
Thin film deposition and device fabrication
Vacuum thermal evaporation was used to deposit neat or blended thin films of MeBQPH, MeBQPNMe, and MeBQPME. Organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated on commercial indium-tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of ∼15 Ω per square. The substrates were sequentially sonicated for 15 min in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropanol before UV–ozone treatment for an additional 15 min. Treated substrates were then passed into a vacuum chamber pumped down to 10−6 Torr, and organic layers were sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask with thicknesses monitored by quartz crystal monitors. The layer structure for all devices reported here was glass/ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/donor:C60/BCP (8 nm)/Al (100 nm), where BCP is bathocuproine. The donor:C60 bulk heterojunctions were approximately 40 nm thick, and were co-deposited using two quartz crystal monitors to independently measure the evaporation rates of the donor and acceptor. The cross-bar geometry was used to define an active area of 4 mm2 for the organic photovoltaic cells. After deposition, devices were encapsulated with a UV-curable epoxy layer to prevent degradation from exposure to ambient oxygen and water.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
300 (75) and 500 (125) MHz 1H (13C) NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury 300 or Gemini 300 or Inova 500 spectrometers. Deuterated (chloroform-d, toluene-d8, and dimethylsulfoxide-d6) solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. and used without further purification. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS and referenced to residual protonated solvent (CDCl3: δ H 7.26 ppm, δ C 77.16 ppm; DMSO-d6: δ H 2.50 ppm, δ C 39.52 ppm). Abbreviations used are s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quin (quintet), hp (heptet), b (broad), and m (multiplet).
UV-vis absorption (solution)
Spectra were obtained using a Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer and an Infrasil Spectrophotometric 1 mm cuvette (Starna Cells, Inc.).
UV-vis absorption (thin film)
Measurements were carried out with a calibrated Newport 818-UV Si photodiode illuminated by a Newport Oriel Apex illuminator and monochromator system chopped at 400 Hz. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems SR830-DSP lock-in amplifier.
Mass spectrometry
ESI-TOF-, APCI-TOF-, and DART-TOF-MS spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6210 TOF spectrometer with MassHunter software. CI- or EI-MS (70 eV) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific DSQ MS after sample introduction via GC or DIP with data processing on Xcalibur software (accurate masses are calculated with the CernoBioscience MassWorks software).
Elemental analysis
Elemental analyses were performed on a Carlo Erba-1106 instrument.
FT-IR spectroscopy
Samples were prepared via vacuum deposition (10−6 Torr) onto NaCl square plates (1′′ by 1′′). Specifically, the salt plate was placed approximately 1 cm away from the organic source position in order to maximize the solid angle of deposition captured. Film thicknesses were on the order of 2.5 μm. Spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker 80v FT-IR Spectrometer with OPUS v6.5 software or a Perkin Elmer Spectrum One spectrometer with Spectrum v5.0.1 software.
Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry (CV/DPV)
Measurements were performed on a Voltammetric Analyzer potentiostat/galvanostat under the control of BAS CV 50W software from Bioanalytical Systems (single-compartment three-electrode cell under argon blanket with a platinum flag as the counter electrode, a silver wire reference electrode, and a 0.02 cm2 platinum disk as the working electrode) using 3.5 mM solutions of analyte in DMF, (nBu)4PF6 as the electrolyte, a ferrocene standard, and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
Measurements were performed on TA Instruments TGA Q5000-0121 (platinum pan, room temperature to 600 °C, ramp rate = 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere) and analyzed on Universal Analysis 2000 4.4A software.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
Scans were performed on TA Instruments DSCQ1000-0620 v9.9 (sealed aluminum pan, empty aluminum reference pan, ramp rate = 20 °C min−1, two heating and cooling cycles) and analyzed on Universal Analysis 2000 4.4A software.
Computational details
Starting geometries were obtained from a conformational search (10000 iterations max, 0.01 convergence threshold, max 10 conformers reported, energy window = default) and geometry minimization (MM3* force field) using the MacroModel v9.1 application within the Maestro v7.0.110 interface. The final ground state geometries and orbital energies were obtained from DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level as implemented in Gaussian 03,58 accessed through the UF High-Performance Computing Center. Frequency calculations were performed at the same computational level, and no imaginary frequencies were found. Molecular orbital plots were made using Gabedit v2.4.059 from the Gaussian output files. The resultant DFT geometries were used for TD-DFT calculations (TD (singlets, NStates = 6)) using Gaussian 03 to determine the S0 to S1 electronic transition energies.
Photovoltaic device performance characterization
Devices were characterized under illumination from a 150 W Xe-arc lamp solar simulator with a KG1 filter, calibrated to 1 sun intensity using the AM1.5G spectrum with the spectral mismatch factor corrected.60 External quantum efficiency measurements were carried out with a calibrated Newport 818-UV Si photodiode illuminated by a Newport Oriel Apex illuminator and monochromator system chopped at 400 Hz. The signal was detected using a Stanford Research Systems SR830-DSP lock-in amplifier.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
Preparation of the branched quaterthiophene (BQ) portion of the targets primarily followed literature preparation of similar derivatives (see ESI† for full details).54 Kumada coupling between 2,3-dibromothiophene and two equivalents of either 2-bromo-5-methylthiophene (obtained from bromination of commercially available 2-methylthiophene) or 2-bromo-5-n-hexylthiophene provided the branched terthiophenes. Subsequent bromination and Kumada coupling with 2-bromothiophene afforded the corresponding branched and alkylated quaterthiophenes. Lithiation and borylation yielded the corresponding boronic ester Suzuki precursors 1 (where R = Me) and 2 (where R = Hex), shown as the starting materials in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the H-bonding “active” and “inactive” target compounds. 
To realize the target compounds, commercially available 4-bromophthalic anhydride was treated with methanol or condensed with N,N′-dimethylhydrazine under acidic conditions (see ESI†) to yield 4-bromophthalic dimethyl ester 3 and 4-bromo-N,N′-dimethylphthalhydrazide 4, respectively (Scheme 1). Appropriate Suzuki cross-couplings (e.g., between 1 and 3) yielded the H-bond inactive precursors, MeBQPME, HexBQPME, and MeBQPNMe. The phthalhydrazide H-bonding derivatives, MeBQPH and HexBQPH, were prepared in one step from MeBQPME and HexBQPME, respectively, through condensation with hydrazine.
Molecular characterization
In this molecular structure–property investigation we first sought to establish that the intrinsic optical and electrochemical properties of the MeBQ derivatives were minimally different. To this end, MeBQPME, MeBQPNMe, and MeBQPH were studied in dilute solution via UV-vis spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV).
As summarized in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 2a, 100 μM THF solutions of each possess very similar absorption profiles with λmax = 393–397 nm and λonset = 462–468 nm. The absorption spectra are also essentially identical in DMF solution (see ESI†). At this concentration, and in these solvents, aggregation via intermolecular H-bonding is not expected.

DPV measurements (in DMF) show that all three compounds have nearly identical oxidation potentials (versus Fc/Fc+); these values have been determined from the oxidation onsets and converted to HOMO energies for comparison (Table 1). The similarity of the values among the molecules is not surprising given their shared (electron-donating) quaterthiophene moieties. The reduction potentials (and corresponding LUMO energies) for MeBQPME and MeBQPNMe are also comparable, despite the structural/conformational differences between the moderately electron withdrawing PME and PNMe portions. Unfortunately, poorly reproducible electrochemical behavior for MeBQPH at negative potentials precluded comparison with this derivative, although the optical data points to its similarity to MeBQPME and MeBQPNMe.
The results of DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) with the MeBQ family in the gas phase are fully consistent with the solution phase optical data (Table 1); predicted are similar estimated HOMO and LUMO energies and wavefunctions for the three compounds (Fig. 3). Likewise, the results of TD-DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) reveal S0 → S1 transition energies that vary by only 0.1 eV among the derivatives. In general, theory reproduces the experimental trends very well for the control compounds (MeBQPME and MeBQPNMe). Small differences between the calculated and experimental parameters for MeBQPH presumably arise from both specific solvent interactions and tautomer composition not accounted for in the calculations. Even so, the conclusion from the above data is that the H-bond “active” and “inactive” molecules have nearly identical properties in the molecularly dispersed state.

Characterization of hydrogen-bond directed assembly
To more directly probe the ability of BQPH to undergo H-bond directed assembly, a series of solution-based 1H NMR studies were performed with the more soluble HexBQPH derivative. A variable-temperature 1H NMR experiment (Fig. 4), performed in a low dielectric solvent that supports H-bonding (toluene-d8), was particularly insightful. Broadening and upfield shifting of the thiophene protons (in the 6.5–8.5 ppm region) as the temperature is lowered are consistent with aggregation through π-stacking. In contrast, HexBQPME gives a sharp 1H NMR spectrum at room temperature in toluene-d8, indicating no aggregation through π-stacking.
 Fig. 4  Variable-temperature 1H NMR spectra for a 10 mM solution of HexBQPH in toluene-d8 at 300 MHz. 
Aggregation of HexBQPH by H-bonding is inferred from the two broadened peaks at δ = 12.78 and 13.75 ppm (at 27 °C). These resonances correspond to the N–H and O–H protons of the lactim–lactam tautomer (Fig. 1), respectively, “frozen out” (on the NMR timescale) and shifted downfield as a consequence of H-bonded assembly. The N–H/O–H peaks coalesce at ≈85 °C (Tc) (ΔG‡c ≈ 17–18 kcal mol−1 based on the standard treatment for exchanging nuclei that are not spin–spin coupled61) but remain significantly deshielded, suggesting that intermolecular H-bonding persists even at this temperature. These results are fully consistent with PH derivatives known to form stable H-bonded trimeric disc-like aggregates in solution.56,57
A difference in the molecular aggregation/packing between the three molecules is apparent upon simple visual inspection of the as-synthesized solids (e.g., MeBQPME is a yellow powder while MeBQPH is deep orange to red). The signatures of H-bonding in the bulk are identified directly from FT-IR spectra of vacuum deposited films (Fig. 5a and b). Phthalhydrazide (PH) alone (Fig. 1), when H-bonded through its lactim–lactam tautomer, exhibits broadened N–H/O–H stretches (2000–3600 cm−1) and a single carbonyl stretch (νCO) at 1662 cm−1 (lower energy shifted from a non-H-bonded, DFT-calculated value of 1701 cm−1);62 this is in excellent agreement with the neat film IR spectrum of MeBQPH that shows nearly identical features (e.g., νCO = 1659 cm−1). More importantly, blended thin films of MeBQPH and C60 (1:1 blend ratio by weight, 40 nm thick) also exhibit these same signatures indicating the persistence of H-bonding in the presence of the fullerene acceptor (Fig. 5b).
 Fig. 5  FT-IR spectra: (a) neat thick films (∼2.5 μm) of MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe; and (b) comparison of the neat thick film of MeBQPH to a device relevant 40 nm thick blended film of MeBQPH with C60. The insets show expansions of the carbonyl (CO) stretching regions. 
Indirect evidence for H-bonded aggregation also comes through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), where the decomposition temperature for MeBQPH is ∼70 °C higher than MeBQPME and ∼83 °C higher than MeBQPNMe. Consistently, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveals a high melting transition (332 °C) for MeBQPH relative to MeBQPME (118 °C) and MeBQPNMe (208 °C) as well as additional exothermic transitions for MeBQPH (298 °C, 1.51 J g−1 and 198 °C, 14.4 J g−1) upon cooling from the melt. Although not investigated in detail yet, these transitions are suggestive of liquid-crystalline behavior, characterized earlier for appropriately substituted PH-based molecules capable of forming discotic mesophases.56
Thin film morphology and transport properties
Solid-state thin films were prepared for MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe by vacuum thermal evaporation. The MeBQPH film shows red-shifted absorption compared to the MeBQPNMe and MeBQPME films by 15 to 20 nm (Fig. 2b and Table 1). Similar behavior in other π-conjugated systems has been attributed to increased π–π overlap and better ordering in the film.51,63,64 Planarity differences between the PNMe and PME fragments (see the computed geometries in the ESI†) likely account for the slightly red-shifted film absorption of MeBQPNMe relative to MeBQPME. Given the identical planarity of MeBQPNMe and MeBQPH, the further red shift for the latter suggests stronger aggregation as mediated by its constituent H-bonding unit.
To measure the hole mobility in neat and blended films of each material, we have fabricated hole only devices using the structure Au/MoO3/organic/MoO3/Au, with organic film thicknesses varying from 100–200 nm and both MoO3 layers at 5 nm thick. The hole mobility was extracted by fitting the current–voltage characteristics of such hole-only devices using the space charge limited current model (Child's law).65 Average hole mobility values for neat films were (4 ± 1) × 10−6, (3 ± 1) × 10−6 and (2 ± 1) × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe, respectively. After blending with 35% C60 by weight, the hole mobilities dropped to (1.0 ± 0.3) × 10−6, (2 ± 1) × 10−7 and (3 ± 1) × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe respectively. While the appreciable device-to-device variation makes drawing conclusions from the hole mobility differences in neat films difficult, it is clear that the MeBQPH blended film with C60 has several times (3–5×) higher mobility than the other two blended films. This conclusion is in agreement with improved charge collection found in the corresponding photovoltaic devices (vide infra). The overall hole mobilities are relatively low compared to what have been observed in some higher-performing donor materials such as copper phthalocyanine66 and poly(3-hexylthiophene),13 which we believe can be attributed to the non-planar structure of the BQ chromophores. Improving the planarity of the chromophores should enhance the planar stacking of the donor molecules, and result in higher hole mobilities.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on recrystallized powders as well as thin films of MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe. All three materials were found to display multiple crystalline peaks (see the ESI†) in powder form, with each material having a different crystal structure. In contrast, although our instrument was able to detect peaks at thicknesses as low as 5 nm for highly crystalline materials such as pentacene (not shown), no peaks were observable for 40 nm thick films of neat MeBQ material or for blends with C60. We conclude that widespread crystal formation does not occur in any of the three materials under the vacuum thermal evaporation conditions used to fabricate devices. This behavior is likely related to the relatively low hole mobilities reported above and may be attributed to the non-planarity of the branched quaterthiophene donor chromophore we have used. In future work, more planar donor structures will be used to improve the π–π stacking.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to probe the surfaces of 1:1 blends of each donor molecule with C60 (see the ESI†). The surfaces were found to be quite flat, with root mean square roughnesses of 0.31 ± 0.05 nm, 0.35 ± 0.05 nm and 0.36 ± 0.05 nm for MeBQPH, MeBQPME, and MeBQPNMe, respectively, with no obvious large aggregates or crystal features. Typical lateral feature sizes of 50 ± 10 nm were observed for all three blends. We conclude that any molecular assemblies formed as a result of hydrogen bonding must be smaller than the lateral instrumentation resolution (∼10 nm). Indeed, any trimeric disc structures would fall below this length scale. Unfortunately, attempts to visualize the assembly structure on a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) were not successful. While phthalhydrazide assemblies have been observed previously using this method,55 we speculate that the non-planarity of the branched quaterthiophene chromophore does not enable the stabilization of MeBQPH molecules on the HOPG surface for STM analysis.
OPV device fabrication
With the optical and electronic properties of BQPME, BQPNMe, and BQPH established in the molecular and aggregated states, final studies probed the consequences of PH self-assembly on the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure shown in the inset of Fig. 6a. Each MeBQ donor was vacuum evaporated in a blend with C60 at a weight ratio of 3:2, sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO)/MoO3 anode and a bathocuproine (BCP)/Al cathode. The blended films were 40 nm thick in all devices, which, along with the blending ratio, was not fully optimized for device performance. Current–voltage characteristics for the devices in the dark and under 1 sun AM1.5G simulated solar illumination from a Xe-arc lamp are shown in Fig. 6a. As summarized in Table 2, the MeBQPH:C60 device shows more than double the PCE of the two devices made from the H-bonding inactive donor molecules, primarily due to improved short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

We note that the maximum PCE of the MeBQPH based device, 1.04%, is still far from the state-of-the-art efficiencies for single junction OPV devices which have exceeded 10% recently.67 This is mainly attributed to the relatively large optical gap of the donor chromophore we have used (the quaterthiophene derivatives have absorption edges at around 500 nm). We anticipate this approach could be generalized to other donor chromophores with more extended conjugation (thus lower optical gap), leading to improved harvesting of longer-wavelength photons and overall PCEs.
A more relevant performance parameter here is the external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a measure of how efficiently photocurrent is produced at each incident wavelength. As shown in Fig. 6b, the EQE spectrum of the MeBQPH-based device under the short-circuit condition shows a red-shifted leading edge at around λ = 500 nm, by approximately 15 nm, compared with those of the other two devices, consistent with the difference in absorption we have observed for these molecules in solid-state films (see Fig. 2b). This further confirms that the H-bonding induced aggregation of the MeBQPH molecules is preserved in the blend with C60. Furthermore, the peak EQE for MeBQPH:C60 of 47% at λ = 420 nm is approximately 50–60% higher than that of the control devices (29% at λ = 400 nm for MeBQPME; 32% at λ = 410 nm for MeBQPNMe). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 6c, the device absorptance at these wavelengths differs by only 10–20%. More importantly, the three devices show identical absorptance at λ ≥ 550 nm as only C60 contributes to absorption at these wavelengths (see the absorption spectra of the donor materials in Fig. 2b) and the three devices have the same C60 content. However, as shown in Fig. 6b, in this spectral region, the EQE of the MeBQPH device is approximately 50–70% higher than that of the other two devices. This can only be attributed to a higher efficiency for photogenerated charge carriers to be transported to and collected at the electrodes, i.e. the charge collection efficiency (ηCC), which is consistent with the higher hole mobilities we have measured in the MeBQPH-containing blend film.
To quantify the charge collection efficiency, we have fit the voltage dependence of the photocurrent in these OPV cells to a charge extraction model developed previously for small molecule donor–acceptor mixtures,66,68 in which ηCC is expressed as:  where dm is the mixed layer thickness (40 nm in this case), and LC is the charge collection length, which is characteristic of the charge transport properties of the photoactive material. The fitting yielded a short-circuit charge collection length of 15 nm, 19 nm, and 41 nm for the MeBQPME, MeBQPNMe, and MeBQPH devices, respectively (see Table 2). This result suggests improved charge transport in the MeBQPH device, in agreement with our hole mobility measurements (above). The significantly longer charge collection length in the MeBQPH device is attributed to the H-bonding enabled molecular assembly. Thus, while part of enhancement in device performance for MeBQPH is due to red-shifted absorption enhancement, the majority of the enhancement is due to improvements in the electrical properties of the blend.
Finally, we note that annealing at 50 °C (for 10 min) had negligible impact on the three devices (see ESI, Fig. S21†), and higher temperature annealing led to device shorting for the two controls (MeBQPNMe and MeBQPME), possibly as a result of diffusion of the cathode metal into the active layer due to the structurally unstable mixed layer. Interestingly, while higher temperature annealing also deteriorates performance of MeBQPH based device, it does so to a much lesser extent. We believe that this result speaks to the robustness of the H-bond enforced active layer.
Conclusions
In summary, we report progress toward a rational, bottom-up approach to improve the power conversion efficiency of small-molecule bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices. Significant insight has been gained through a systematic molecular structure–property relationship study to evaluate the consequences of dedicated H-bonding interactions between molecular donors on molecular assembly, absorption, charge collection, and performance in OPV devices. While the H-bonding enabled BQPH compounds share nearly identical optical and electronic properties with the H-bonding inactive BQPME and BQPNMe derivatives in the molecularly dissolved state, aggregation of BQPH promoted by H-bonding significantly differentiates the molecules in terms of their absorption and bulk organization. Effects measured in neat films are ultimately transferred to C60 blends where they result in a more than two-fold increase in photovoltaic device efficiency. Although considerable work remains to characterize the assembly structure of the H-bonded species in donor:acceptor blends, it appears that properly installed H-bonding units can have a favorable effect on the BHJ morphology. Future studies will exploit the modularity of the design to study to what extent improvements can be realized across different classes of donor chromophores, particularly those that possess a lower optical gap for improved coverage of the solar spectrum and/or show improved stacking for higher carrier mobilities.
