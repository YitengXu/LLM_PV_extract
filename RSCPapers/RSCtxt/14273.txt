    , Accepted 11th April 2019First published on 17th April 2019AbstractSemi-artificial photosynthesis is an emerging technique in recent years. Here, we presented an inorganic-biological hybrid system composed of photosynthetic Rhodopseudomonas palustris and CdS nanoparticles coated on the bacterial surface. Under visible light irradiation, the CO2 reduction and valuable C2+ chemical production of R. palustris could be promoted by the photo-induced electrons from the CdS NPs. The increased energy-rich NADPH cofactor promoted the generation of the Calvin cycle intermediate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. As a result, the production of solid biomass, carotenoids and poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was increased to 148%, 122% and 147%, respectively. The photosynthetic efficiency (PE) of CdS–R. palustris was elevated from the original 4.31% to 5.98%. The surface loaded NP amount and the material–cell interface both played important roles in the efficient electron generation and transduction. The CdS–R. palustris hybrid system also exhibited a survival advantage over its natural counterparts under the autotrophic conditions. Under a practical solar/dark cycle, the produced biomass, carotenoid and PHB from the hybrid system also reach 139%, 117% and 135%, respectively. The CdS-photosynthetic hybrid system represents a powerful and expandable platform for advanced CO2 reduction and solar-to-chemical (S2C) conversion.
Introduction
Inorganic-biological hybrid systems have emerged as promising semi-artificial photosynthetic platforms for S2C and solar-to-fuel (S2F) production.1–9 They combine the efficient light absorption ability of the inorganic semiconductors and the highly-specific catalytic power of the bio-catalysts, surpassing the performance of the chemical or biological route alone.2,10 Compared to several photosynthetic biohybrid systems (PBS) employing the purified enzymes for chemical production,11–16 whole-cell-based studies received more attention owing to their self-replicating capacity, higher stability and better operability for applications.1,2 Taking advantage of the well-established metabolic pathways of the microorganisms, the solar energy could be deliberately transformed into clean fuels, CO2/N2-derived valuable chemicals and solid biomass.10,17–21
Several chemo/electro-autotrophic bacteria have been integrated with photo(electro)catalysts for chemical production, including Moorella thermoacetica, Sporomusa ovata, Methanosarcina barkeri, Ralstonia eutropha and Xanthobacter autotrophicus.17–22 However, most of these PBSs are only proof-of-concept. Strict- or micro-anaerobic conditions are essential for the successful cultivation of these uncommon species, and hydrogen electron donors and expensive energy sources are also required.17–22 As a result, the mass production of the corresponding biohybrid systems is generally lower than that of the heterotrophic microorganisms which possess alternative metabolic pathways. Therefore, the scaling up of these PBSs for future application is difficult. Moreover, the products of the current PBSs are usually limited to the acetate.19,20 Other C2+ chemicals such as organic acids, aromatics, polymers and alcohols have rarely been reported. Although the chemoheterotrophic Escherichia coli has been successfully integrated with TiO2, CdS and AgInS2/In2S3 heterojunction photocatalysts for S2F production,10,23,24 the very limited improvement and lack of S2C metabolic pathways inhibited the development of the E. coli-based hybrid systems.25,26 At present, photosynthetic microorganisms are rarely employed for hybrid system construction owing to their complex metabolic pathways.19 Most of the photoautotrophic species produce O2, which would compete with the cells for the exogenous electrons from the photocatalyst or electrodes. Additionally, the harmful effect from the O2-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also a huge challenge.5
Herein, we focus on an extensively studied anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacterium, R. palustris. This versatile bacterium is notable for its ability to obtain electrons from external donors and flexibly to switch between different metabolic modes.27,28 It can adapt to different environments and survive from various cheap energy sources.27 Therefore, R. palustris has been widely applied in wastewater treatment, biodegradation, valuable chemical production and food additive production.27 More importantly, R. palustris has exhibited the ability to precipitate Cd2+ through cysteine desulfurase,29 revealing the potential for integrating with CdS. In this study, we successfully constructed a hybrid system composed of R. palustris (ACCC 10649) and biologically coated CdS NPs on the cell surface. Under visible light irradiation, the CdS NPs could stimulate the CO2 reduction of R. palustris, leading to enhanced solid biomass production and promoting valuable C2+ chemical synthesis including the carotenoids and PHB.
Results and discussion
To facilitate the CdS coating and avoid the formation of undesirable cadmium phosphate, the culture medium for R. palustris30 was modified (MMN medium in Table S1†). The strategy of the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system construction is illustrated in the ESI† (Experimental section, Fig. S1–S4 and Tables S1–S2†). High angle annular dark field scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) (Fig. 1a and b) showed that a high density of well distributed bright dots (<10 nm) had been coated on the R. palustris surface. No particles were scattered outside, indicating their tight connection to the cell surface. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 1c–e) revealed that the bright dots are composed of Cd and S elements, and the C element originated from the cell. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the thin-sectioned hybrid system (Fig. 1f and g) further demonstrated the close interface of CdS and cell membrane. According to the lattice parameter data in JCPDS no. 80-10019,31 the lattice fringes of 0.33 nm (Fig. 1h) belong to the (111) plane of CdS. Besides, the peaks in Cd 3d and S 2P X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Fig. 1i) can be attributed to Cd2+ and S2−, respectively.31 The results confirmed the successful coating of CdS NPs on the R. palustris surface.

Scale bars in (a) 500 nm, (b–e) 100 mm, (f) 200 nm, (g) 20 nm and (h) 5 nm. 
The CdS NPs were further isolated (Experimental section†) from the cell surface (Fig. 2a). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) and photoelectrochemistry (PEC) were analysed. In agreement with previous reports,23,32 the UV-vis DRS of the isolated CdS (Fig. 2b) indicated that the NPs are responsive to visible light (>400 nm). The PEC results (Fig. 2c and Fig. S5†) illustrated that although affected by the bacterial impurities from the isolating process, the biologically precipitated CdS NPs could efficiently generate photocurrent, which is lower than that of the chemically synthesized CdS, but still higher than that of the commercial CdS (Sigma) under fixed and various potentials.

Under VL irradiation, the cellular reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) level was consistently higher in the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system (Fig. 3a). This result indicated that under the continuous stimulation of the photo-induced electrons, additional reducing equivalents were generated in the CdS-coated R. palustris cells. Correspondingly, the amount of Calvin cycle33 intermediate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), is also higher in the hybrid system during the reaction (Fig. 3b). The result revealed that the higher amount of CO2 was fixed by the energy-rich NADPH cofactor to produce biosynthetic precursors. As a result, the cell density of the CdS-coated R. palustris far surpassed its natural counterpart after 70 h (Fig. 3c) and finally achieved a 148% dry weight of solid biomass (Fig. 3d). Besides, the production of the carotenoids and biodegradable thermoplastic, PHB, was also elevated to 122% and 147%, respectively (Fig. 3e and f). To further confirm the carbon source, the isotopic labelling experiment was conducted (Experimental section†). The peak of 13CO2 (m/z = 45) was detected when the hybrid system was cultured under 13CO2 gas (Fig. S6†), confirming that the enhanced solid biomass production and valuable chemical conversion are contributed by the reduced CO2. Under dark conditions (light off), there was no difference between the hybrid system and natural cells in biomass and valuable chemicals (Fig. 3d–f). The results illustrated that no exogenous energy could be obtained by the hybrid system without light irradiation. The significantly lower productivity in the dark also demonstrated the importance of the light energy, which not only induced the electrons from the coated CdS NPs, but also provided ATP to the biological CO2 reduction.33 The photosynthetic efficiency (PE) was calculated (Experimental section, Tables S3–S4 and Fig. S7†). The PE of the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system was 5.98%, significantly higher than 4.31% of the natural cells and most photosynthetic bacteria.34,35

The light/dark cycle (12 h:12 h) experiment was conducted to further investigate the function of the photo-induced electrons and the behavior of R. palustris (Experimental section†). It was observed that both the CdS-coated R. palustris and the natural cells only accumulated the biomass when light was on (Fig. 4a). In addition, higher biomass was generated in the hybrid system and the difference became significant after the 4th day (Fig. 4a). The result revealed that more energy could be obtained for biosynthesis by the cell coated with CdS NPs under light irradiation. The relationship between the loaded CdS NP amount and final cell density was investigated (Experimental section†). In the dark, no difference was observed between R palustris loaded with different amounts of CdS NPs (Fig. 4b). When light was on, the final cell density was found to be positively related to the number of loaded NPs (Fig. 4b), illustrating that the higher amount of surface coated CdS NPs could correspondingly bring more photo-induced electrons and additional reducing equivalents converted by R. palustris for CO2 reduction.

Surface CdS separation study and electron scavenger study were conducted (Experimental section and Fig. S8†). It is observed that simple mixing of the isolated CdS NPs (0.2 mM) or chemically synthesized CdS (0.2 mM) with natural R. palustris did not promote the final cell density effectively (Fig. 4c). Although 1.0 mM synthesized CdS slightly stimulated the growth of R. palustris, the promoting effect is much lower than that of the surface coated CdS NPs (Fig. 4c). Therefore, the semiconductor–cell interface is essential for the efficient electron transduction. The enhancement effect in the hybrid system was inhibited by Cr(VI), further confirming the stimulation effect of the photo-induced electrons on the improved cell metabolism.
Furthermore, the survivability of CdS–R. palustris in the insufficient organic carbon environment was studied by carrying out a reduced organic substrate supplying experiment (Experimental section†). The cells were pre-cultured in the original MMN medium for CdS coating and then transferred to the MMN media with reduced malate (15 mM and 0 mM). The CdS–R. palustris hybrid system exhibited higher reproducing ability than the natural cells in the organic-insufficient environment (Fig. 4d). Normally, R. palustris could not totally rely on an inorganic carbon source for survival.28 Without the organic substrate supplied here, a survival advantage was observed in CdS–R. palustris over its natural counterparts. The above results indicated that the surface coated CdS empowered R. palustris with a higher autotrophic growth ability via the enhanced CO2 reduction ability.
The function of the remaining Cys in the medium was also investigated by modifying the initial concentration of added Cys to 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mM (Experimental section†). It is observed that the final density of R. palustris without CdS coating was not affected by the added Cys (Fig. S9†). Therefore, the nutritional role of Cys as a carbon source in the system was ignorable. With the increase of the initial Cys concentration, a visible promotion of the final cell density was exhibited in the group supplemented with Cd2+ (Fig. S9†). In light of the previous reports employing Cys as a hole sacrificial agent,19,23 it is reasonable to infer that the remaining Cys enhanced the photo-induced charge separation.
The exogenous electron uptake ability of R. palustris for metabolism has been previously reported.28 The key enzyme in the CO2-reducing Calvin cycle has also been found to be active to the photo-excited semiconductors.36,37 In addition, CdS has proven to be biocompatible with biological systems.19,23 All the above evidence indicated the feasibility of the construction of the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system in this study. The Calvin cycle either serves as an alternative pathway to provide a carbon source under organic-insufficient conditions, or as a sink to protect the cell from the harmful excess reducing stress from organic substrates.38,39 The promoted NADPH level in the CdS–R. palustris supported the second mechanism, while the former possibility was eliminated by the remaining malate at the end of the CO2 reduction study (Fig. S5†). Since NADP+ is the final electron acceptor, the photosynthetic electron transfer (PET) chain40 is speculated to mediate the conversion from the photocatalyzed electron to the enhanced NADPH regeneration. Moreover, as the major route in bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis, the activity of the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is highly correlated to the NADPH level.41,42 The PHB biosynthesis also consumes reducing equivalents and can compete with other biological processes.43–45 Therefore, the enhanced production of the C2+ value-added chemicals was well consistent with the promoted CO2 reduction and solid biomass accumulation.
Taken together, we proposed the underlying mechanism of the enhanced CO2 reduction of the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system (Scheme 1). The presence of toxic Cd2+ ions triggered Cys desulfurase to release S2− from Cys in the medium. As a result, insoluble CdS nanoparticles were coated on the cell surface, simultaneously generating photocurrents under VL irradiation. The holes were effectively sacrificed by the remaining Cys and the cell continuously suffered from the reducing stress which was transformed to cellular reducing equivalents (NADPH). Finally, the Calvin cycle was stimulated to release the excess reducing equivalents by fixing more CO2 and leading to additional energy being captured by the cell for biosynthesis and valuable chemical production.

Finally, the feasibility of applying the CdS–R. palustris hybrid system for solid biomass accumulation and valuable chemical production was tested under natural conditions (Experimental section†). It is observed that under the 12 h:12 h solar (100 W−2) and dark cycles, the cell density of CdS–R. palustris is consistently higher than that of the natural cells (Fig. 5a). As a result, the surface coated CdS NPs contributed to additional 39% of the solid biomass. 117% carotenoids and 135% PHB were also obtained from the hybrid system (Fig. 5b and c). Although the productivity improvement is not as high as that under the laboratory conditions, it is highly possible to adapt further optimization to improve the productivity of the hybrid system in the future.

Conclusions
This study employed a widely applied photoheterotrophic bacterium for semi-artificial photosynthetic platform construction and advanced S2C conversion. The surface coated CdS NPs promoted the CO2 reduction and valuable C2+ chemical production of R. palustris. Through transforming the environmentally hazardous Cd2+ into useful photocatalytic nanoparticles, the CdS-photosynthetic hybrid system successfully converted the free solar energy and greenhouse gas CO2 to valuable chemical products and solid biomass, representing a powerful and green strategy for S2C production. The powerful CdS-photosynthetic hybrid systems also exhibited good feasibility for practical application. In the future, more efforts are needed for illustrating the detailed electron transduction mechanism, and further expanding the use of this inorganic-biological hybrid platform's application for various kinds of S2C/S2F conversion.
