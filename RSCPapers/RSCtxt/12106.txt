    First published on 16th May 2016AbstractAzadipyrromethenes were first described over 70 years ago as blue pigments, but now are rapidly emerging as a compound class with highly desirable near infrared photophysical properties. Since the turn of the century several routes to azadipyrromethenes have been developed and numerous post-synthesis derivatizations have allowed for their exploitation in both biological and material sciences. The relative ease of access to specifically designed derivatives is now allowing their use in multiple technological formats from real-time fluorescence imaging, to solar energy materials, to optoelectronic devices and many more. In this review we have highlighted the synthetic component of this story as it is the ability to generate the designer azadipyrromethene that opens the door to exciting applications.

1 Introduction
Research interest in utilizing the (Z)-N-(2H-pyrrol-2-ylidene)-1H-pyrrol-2-amines, better known as azadipyrromethenes, has rapidly grown since the turn of the century. Whilst the first reports of their synthesis and properties can be traced to the first half of the last century, the more recent strong re-emergence in interest can be attributed to their accessibility from several synthetic routes and their ability to be modified post-synthesis (Fig. 1).1,2 This has permitted the development of structurally tailored derivatives, delivering a wide range of application specific properties to the compounds to suit the researchers' goals. Such applications included in this review are near-infrared fluorochromes, fluorescent sensors, energy/electron transfer cassettes, nanoparticle conjugates, donor/acceptor conjugates for solar cell applications, optoelectronics, light activated therapeutics, and supramolecular building blocks. In this review we have confined ourselves to the structural scaffold as shown in Fig. 1 as the related dipyrromethenes have been previously expertly reviewed.3

The primary focus of this review is on the different synthetic approaches to the azadipyrromethene scaffold and their post-synthesis modification.
These synthetic tools allow the production of azadipyrromethenes with designed and tailored properties which are tabulated by specific application at the end of the review. Table data includes photophysical properties, NIR-optical sensors, bio- and material-conjugates, photodynamic therapy agents, photoredox catalysts, solar energy materials, and optoelectronic materials.
2 Synthetic strategies for azadipyrromethenes
The synthesis of azadipyrromethene 3a was first reported in 1943 by M. Rogers while working for Imperial Chemical Company (ICI) Dyestuffs LTD in Blackley, Manchester, U.K. (Scheme 1).1,2,4 His discovery was the unexpected result of an attempted Leuckart reaction conducted by heating ammonium formate with 4-nitro-1,3-diphenylbutan-1-one 1a under solventless conditions.1 Rather than the anticipated reductive amination product, an intense blue colour was observed from the reaction with a similar coloured result obtained when 4-oxo-2,4-diphenylbutanenitrile 2a was used as substrate (Scheme 1).4
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to azadipyrromethene developed by Rogers. 
Rogers' motivation to deduce the source of the observed colour is understandable considering the importance of the dye industry at that time to his employer. It is of interest to note that in his abstract he describes 3a as “a new chromophoric system, having a formal relationship to the phthalocyanines” which had been industrially developed by ICI Grangemouth division in 1929 and remains today as one of the most important industrial blue pigments. It could be speculated that the huge success of the phthalocyanine dyes may have contributed to the lack of interest in azadipyrromethenes for the following 50 years.
Considering the increase in structural complexity of product 3a from either starting substrate 1a or 2a, the structural assignment of the coloured product would not have been trivial at that time. With analytical instrumentation of that era largely limited to melting points, elemental analysis, and molecular weight determinations, structural assignments were often elucidated by characterization of products from degradation reactions and by development of alternative synthetic routes. The matrix of product degradation and re-synthesis adopted by Rogers is shown in Scheme 2.1,4
 Scheme 2  Degradation and re-synthesis of tetraphenylazadipyrromethene. 
The key degradation reaction involved heating of 3a with hydriodic acid which produced 2,4-diphenylpyrrole 4a, a precursor compound of which had been previously reported in the literature in 1925.5 This result permitted two additional routes to be devised, both of which provided the unknown compound 3a. Conversion of 4a into 5-nitroso-2,4-diphenylpyrrole 5a was achieved with sodium nitrite which in turn could be condensed with 4a to generate 3a, thereby confirming its structure. Additionally, reduction of nitroso pyrrole 5a with Adams's catalyst produced the corresponding 5-amino-2,4-diphenylpyrrole 6a which upon exposure to air oxidised and self-condensed with the loss of ammonia resulting in the formation of 3a, albeit in very low yield. In this first report nine different tetraarylazadipyrromethenes were described using these routes.1
Work for our laboratory utilising 15N labelling with 15NH4OAc as ammonia source and the rational synthesis of specifically 15N labelled derivatives of 4a and 6a showed that in the overall conversion of 1a into 3a, two related pathways are ongoing concurrently; the first involves a dimerization of in situ formed 3,5-diphenyl-2H-pyrrol-2-imine 7, and the other reaction of 7 with 2,4-diphenylpyrrole 4a (Scheme 3).6
 Scheme 3  Intermediates formed during conversion of 1a into 3a. 
At the outset of our own interest in azadipyrromethenes, an investigation into developing optimised routes to the structural scaffold was carried out starting from 4-nitro-1,3-diarylbutan-1-ones 1a–d.7 Routine access to these compounds is available from Michael addition of nitromethane to the diaryl-α,β-unsaturated ketones 8a–d (chalcones) which in turn are produced by aldol condensation between the corresponding aromatic aldehyde and substituted acetophenone. In the original protocol, harsh (180 °C) solventless conditions were used for the conversion of 1a into 3a. By changing the ammonia source from ammonium formate to ammonium acetate, and the use of either EtOH or BuOH as solvents, a general improvement of the reaction yields was obtained. This also had the distinct advantage that the products often crystallize from the reaction and can be purified by simple filtration. Using this approach numerous derivatives have been synthesized (e.g.3a–d), yields vary with aryl substituent with the better yields typically in the 40–50% range (Scheme 4).7 As this reaction is formally a starting material dimerization, only two different aryl substituents can be introduced onto 3.
 Scheme 4  General synthesis of azadipyrromethenes. 
The synthesis of poly-thiophene substituted derivatives has been independently reported via two routes starting from either 4-nitrobutan-1-ones 1e, 1f or 4-cyanobutan-1-one 2b (Scheme 5).8,9 Under the same reaction conditions of NH4OAc/BuOH at reflux, the yields for di- and tetra-thiophene substituted 3e and 3f were low for both routes but marginally higher when 1f was used as starting substrate (Scheme 5). The use of 2b as starting substrate suffers from the added disadvantage that KCN is required for its synthesis from the precursor chalcone.9
 Scheme 5  Synthesis of thiophene substituted azadipyrromethenes. 
For the development of a general route to non C-2 symmetric azadipyrromethenes bearing up to four different aryl substituents, an efficient route to 2,4-diaryl pyrrole building blocks was required. While alternative literature routes were available to such pyrroles the 4-nitro-1,3-diarylbutan-1-ones 1 were chosen as substrates to allow a common starting material with those utilised for the previously described route as shown in Scheme 4.10 The crucial step utilised a Nef transformation of 1 into 4,4-dimethoxy-1,3-diaryl-butan-1-ones 8. Subsequent acetal deprotection and ammonia condensation reaction gave the diaryl pyrroles 4a–j in good yields. Conversion of pyrroles 4a–j into α-nitrosopyrroles 5 was readily accomplished by reaction with sodium nitrite in ethanolic HCl (Scheme 6).
 Scheme 6  Pyrrole and nitroso-pyrrole building block synthesis. 
Condensation of pyrroles and nitroso pyrroles in acetic anhydride/acetic acid mixture at 100 °C gave azadipyrromethenes such as 3e–j in good to excellent yields. Typical examples are shown in Scheme 7 illustrating tolerance to a variety of aryl substituents such as halogens, ethers, amines and anilines.10
 Scheme 7  Route to non-symmetric azadipyrromethenes. 
An adaptation of this approach has been reported for producing both symmetric 10a and non-symmetric 10b conformationally restricted azadipyrromethenes (Scheme 8).11–13 Aryl-constrained pyrrole precursors such as 9 were synthesized in four steps with an azirine ring opening being the key step for pyrrole generation. Conversion to aryl ring constrained azadipyrromethene 10a was achieved, in one pot, by reaction of pyrrole 9 with 0.5 equiv. of sodium nitrite in acetic acid/acetic anhydride. Different pyrrole subunits could also be incorporated into this one pot approach by first generation of nitrosopyrrole 11 using 1.0 equiv. of sodium nitrite in acetic acid, followed by addition of a second pyrrole 4a and acetic anhydride (Scheme 8). Attempts to use 2,4-dimethylpyrrole with 2,4-diarylpyrrole for this approach failed to generate the desired azadipyrromethene product, indicating that the 2-aryl pyrrole substituents are necessary for this approach to be successful.12
 Scheme 8  Synthesis of aryl constrained azadipyrromethenes. 
The, as of yet, unresolved roadblock for the synthesis of all alkyl substituted derivatives was highlighted in the attempted synthesis of azadipyrromethene 13 from the reaction of 2,4-dimethyl-3-ethylpyrrole 12 with 0.5 equiv. of NaNO2. Instead of the desired hexa-alkyl-substituted azadipyrromethene 13, the 5-amino dipyrromethene 16 was the isolated product.14 The authors rationalised this unexpected result based on a rapid redox rearrangement of the nitroso-pyrrole 14 to the formyl-amino-pyrrole 15 which subsequently in situ condensed with pyrrole 12 to yield dipyrromethene 16 (Scheme 9). This unusual rearrangement has been observed by other research teams.15,16
 Scheme 9  Unsuccessful attempt for hexa-alkyl substituted derivatives. 
In his first report, Rogers attempted to expand the substitution pattern to 5,5′-diaryl derivatives 20 from the reaction of 4-nitro-1-arylbutan-1-one 17 with ammonium formate, but reported that no desired product was formed (Scheme 10).2 In 1947, Knott first reported the synthesis of derivatives 20 with positions 3,3′-unsubstituted by utilising 4-oxo-4-arylbutanenitrile 18 as starting substrate in reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride,17 a procedure latterly repeated by Boyer et al.18 An additional route to 20 from the addition of aryl Grignard reagents to succinonitrile 19 has also been described (Scheme 10).19 In 2013, these methods were repeated, but NMR and ES-MS analysis indicated that the structure 20 had been mistakenly assigned in all three of these publications leaving a viable route to 20 yet to be developed.20
 Scheme 10  Incorrectly claimed syntheses of 3,3′-unsubstituted derivatives. 
In contrast, synthetic access to 3,3′-dimethyl-5,5′-diaryl derivatives 22 is achievable from 3-methyl-4-nitro-1-phenylbutan-1-one 21 upon reflux with ammonium acetate in alcohol (Scheme 11).20 This is an important approach to obtaining less lipophilic derivatives than the tetraaryl substituted analogues. It is of interest to note that this route is viable with either aryl or alkyl substituents at C-3 (e.g.1 and 21) but, as of yet, not when this position is unsubstituted as in 17. To date, the synthesis of 3,3′-dimethyl derivatives via a pyrrole/nitrosopyrrole condensation route has not been reported.
 Scheme 11  Synthesis of 3,3′-dimethyl substituted derivatives. 
In 1972 Vollman synthesized the benzo fused azadipyrromethenes (3-aryl-N-(3-aryl-isoindol-1-ylidene)-isoindol-1-amines) 28a–d starting from phthalonitrile 23 and 2.5 equiv. of an aryl-Grignard reagent with products isolated by steam distillation (Scheme 12).21 Alternatively, the product could be obtained by reacting 2-cyanobenzophenone 27 with formamide, but in this case the yield was lower at 10%.21 More recently, Riede and co-workers optimized these conditions and suggested a plausible mechanism for the formation of the azadiisoindolynmethane (Scheme 12).22 The optimal conditions found were the addition of 1 equiv. of aryl Grignard reagent to phthalonitrile 23 in diethyl ether at −20 °C thereby generating the magnesium salt of 1-arylisoindoylimines 24. Evaporation of diethyl ether and subsequent heating with formamide at reflux gave the chromophore products 28a–d. The latter step most likely proceeds via the two intermediates 25 and 26 that undergo condensation with formation of the final products (Scheme 12).22 Numerous other examples of benzo and naphthalene substituted azadipyrromethenes have been reported in the literature utilizing these methods.23,24
 Scheme 12  Routes to benzo fused azadipyrromethenes. 
Related asymmetric donor–π–acceptor benzo fused azadipyrromethenes have been generated by reaction of phthalonitriles alone in tBuOK–DMF.25 This unique reaction sequence involved the incorporation of three molecules of phthalonitrile substrate into the final product.
3 Synthetic elaboration of azadipyrromethenes
The most common azadipyrromethene derivatization is the formation of their BF2 chelates, thereby generating a central 5-6-5 fused ring system. This provides structural rigidity to the molecule and inhibits rotation around the C–N pyrrole bridging bonds. The most important impact of this derivatization is that the boron chelate is fluorescent whereas the azadipyrromethene itself is not. The most common synthetic approach to these BF2 chelates is to use BF3OEt2 with a weak organic base such as triethylamine (TEA)11,24 or diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)7,26 in CH2Cl2 at rt or (CH2Cl)2 at reflux (Scheme 13). Alternative conditions, such as toluene at 80 °C18 or benzene at reflux,23,24 have been reported but often giving lower yields.
 Scheme 13  Synthesis of BF2-azadipyrromethene. 
Often the BF2 chelation step is sufficiently robust to be combined, with the preceding azadipyrromethene forming step, into a one-pot method. In this approach in situ chelation is performed following the formation of the azadipyrromethene without prior purification. This method has been reported for some tetraaryl 39 and conformationally restricted 1011 derivatives and was adopted for the synthesis of β-thiophene-fused BF2-azadipyrromethenes 34 (Scheme 14). In this case, reaction of the diaryl-thieno[3,2-b]pyrroles 33 with 0.5 equiv. sodium nitrite in acetic acid/acetic anhydride resulted in the precipitation of the azadipyrromethene, which after filtration was used directly for the chelation step with BF3·Et2O/TEA in toluene to give the target fluorophores 34a,b with yields of 54 and 58% respectively.27
 Scheme 14  β-Thiophene-fused BF2-azadipyrromethenes. 
A one-pot synthesis of BF2 chelated benzo[c,d]indole containing azadipyrromethene 37 has been elegantly achieved by the TiCl4 catalysed condensation of lactam 35 and benzo[c,d]indole-2-amine 36 in toluene followed by treatment with BF3 etherate (Scheme 15).28
 Scheme 15  One-pot synthesis of benzo[c,d]indole containing azadipyrromethenes. 
The first example of a PO2 chelate phosphorusdioxide-azadipyrromethene 38 was synthesized by reaction of azadipyrromethene 3a with POCl3 in the presence of Et3N, followed by aqueous hydrolysis (Scheme 16).29 This sole example illustrates that the synthesis (and properties) of a broad range of other non-metal and metalloid chelates remains to be explored.
 Scheme 16  Synthesis of phosphorus-azadipyrromethene 38. 
In Rogers' 1943 publication the zinc, copper, nickel and cobalt metal complexes of 3a were synthesized from reflux with the corresponding metal acetate (Scheme 17).1 Specifically the homoleptic copper complex of 39 (M = Cu) was noted as having “excellent light fastness, being equal to Prussian-blue”. More recently these complexes have been fully characterised30 and the diversity of homoleptic metal chelates has expanded to include Hg31 and Pd.32 Metal chelation conditions for Co, Ni, and Zn were well tolerated by phenylacetylene functionalized azadipyrromethenes (at the β-pyrrole positions), providing access to unique photovoltaic constructs.33,34 The synthesis of homoleptic Cu complexes of benzo fused azadipyrromethenes was first reported by Vollman in 1972 and more recently the range of complexes has been expanded to include Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Hg derivatives of benzo fused azadipyrromethene 28a.21,35
 Scheme 17  Synthesis of homo- and hetero-leptic metal complexes of azadipyrromethenes. 
To date, nine different metals including Cu, Ag, Au, Re, Ir, Rh, Pt, Pd and Zn have been incorporated into heteroleptic metal complexes 40, with a variety of associated ligands and comprehensively characterized (Scheme 17).36–46 Typically, complexes are formed under mild rt conditions in THF with t-butoxide or DIPEA as base. This points to an ever expanding future for these complexes not just for their own inherent properties but also for catalysis and material applications.
3.1 Derivatization via fluorine displacement
In an effort to expand the range of boron complexes, several methods for the nucleophilic displacement of fluorine from the BF2 chelated azadipyrromethenes have been documented. The first were B(OR)2 derivatives 41a–c, which were synthesized from precursors 29 by treatment with sodium methoxide at rt (Scheme 18).47 This transformation was exploited for the covalent linking of 29 to alcohol functionalized particles via a B–O bond, resulting in fluorescent particles and on-bead sensors 42. The use of an oxygen/fluorine displacement has been exploited for the synthesis of several fullerene–azadipyrromethene conjugates (Scheme 19).48–51 For example, rt reaction of BF2 chelated 43 with AlCl3 and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde generated the benzo-dioxaborole ring substituted product 44 by sequential inter- and intra-molecular fluorine displacements. Reaction of 44 with C60 and sarcosine in toluene under reflux gave the fullerene dyad 45.52
 Scheme 18  Synthesis of B(OMe)2 chelates. 
 Scheme 19  Synthesis of fullerene conjugates. 
An intramolecular variant of this reaction has allowed access to the helical chiral derivatives 46 which contains an expanded benzo fused 6-5-6-5-6 ring system (Scheme 20). Two synthetic approaches have been developed to this target, one in which the bis-phenol substituted azadipyrromethenes 3k are reacted with BF3·OEt2/DIPEA in toluene or THF at reflux to form the BF2 chelate followed by in situ double intramolecular phenolic oxygen fluorine displacement, thereby generating the structurally constraining benzo(1,3,2)oxazaborinine rings. Alternatively, the bis-aryl methoxy substituted BF2 chelated precursors 29 could be treated with BBr3 to demethylate both methoxy groups with in situ fluorine displacement by the phenolic oxygens (Scheme 20).53
 Scheme 20  Intramolecular fluorine displacement. 
Fluoride displacement with aryl and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles has been accomplished utilizing organolithium and Grignard reagents, allowing for further structural elaboration and refinement of properties (Scheme 21). The method successfully produces boron-aryl and -alkynyl substituted derivatives 47a–d in moderate yields from 29a by nucleophilic substitution with the appropriate organometallic reagent.54,55 F-Displacement with aliphatic nucleophiles are yet to be reported, but the synthesis of the aliphatic dibutylboron B(Bu)2 derivative 47e has been achieved from the unchelated azadipyrromethene 3a by treatment with dibutylborontriflate/trimethylamine in CH2Cl2.55
 Scheme 21  Fluorine displacement with C-nucleophiles. 
Synthesis of the ferroceneacetyleneboryl complex 48 has been achieved from a one-pot two-step procedure. Reaction of azadiisoindolynmethane 28a with borontrichloride in toluene generated the BCl2 chelate which was not isolated but converted in situ to 48 by reaction with an alkynyl-ferrocence Grignard in an overall 21% yield (Scheme 22).56

3.2 Functionalization at the β-pyrrole positions

3.2.1 Halogenation. 
Azadipyrromethenes are susceptible to electrophilic substitution at the C-2 and 6 positions (β-pyrrole positions). The chemical derivatization of the pyrrole rings of azadipyrromethene is a powerful tool to tailor their application based properties. For example, the introduction of heavy atoms such as bromine and iodine on the molecular skeleton dramatically alters the excited state populations, changing the application profile from fluorophore to photosensitizer. As a photosensitizer, 49 can efficiently generate singlet oxygen and thus act as highly effective photodynamic therapeutic agents (Scheme 23).7,57–63 The same halogens could also be useful for activating the molecule for further functionalization via cross-coupling chemistries. Bromination of both pyrrole rings can be routinely performed at rt utilizing Br2 giving the corresponding dibrominated derivatives 49a in high yields.7 In a similar manner, di-iodination is achievable using N-iodosuccinimide as iodine source.64 Subsequent conversion of the halogenated derivatives to their BF2 chelates can be carried out under the conditions as outlined in Scheme 13.7 Mono bromination of one β-pyrrole position has also been reported.65

3.2.2 Formylation. 
Jiao and co-workers have explored the applicability of the Vilsmeier–Haack formylation for the BF2-azadipyrromethene 29a (Scheme 24).66 Reaction of 29a with the Vilsmeier reagent (generated in situ from DMF and POCl3) at 70 °C for 20 h gave a good yield of the aldehyde product 50. This electrophilic substitution is selective to the β-pyrrole position with only mono-formyl derivative 50 produced, presumably due to the electron withdrawing effect of the introduced aldehyde substituent. Under similar conditions, 29g was formylated and aldehyde 50b converted to the azadipyrromethene–BODIPY dyad 51 (Scheme 24).67 This reaction sequence is a good illustration of the complexity of sequential transformations that can be carried out on azadipyrromethenes.
 Scheme 24  Formylation of azadipyrromethenes. 


3.2.3 Sulfonation. 
Mono- or di-sulfonation of azadipyrromethene 3l was achieved with the appropriate equivalence of chlorosulfonic acid in CH2Cl2 at low temperatures (Scheme 25). Disappointingly, BF2 chelation of sulfonated 52a and b failed under a variety of conditions. An alternative approach of reacting the BF2 chelated version of 3l also failed to give the desired product due to loss of the BF2 fragment during the reaction. This instability was attributed to the electron deficient character of the BF2 chelated 3l.68
 Scheme 25  Mono and di-sulfonation. 


3.2.4 Metal mediated coupling reactions. 
Azadipyrromethenes with halogen substituents on the β-pyrrole positions have been utilised to form conjugated oligomers via Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions (Scheme 26). For example, Pd/Cu catalyzed reaction of iodo azadipyrromethenes 49b and 1,4-bis-(dodecyloxy)-2,5-diethynylbenzene followed by BF2 chelation gave oligomers 53.64 Highest molecular weight oligomers were obtained when Ar1 and Ar2 were para-substituted with tBu groups to aid solubility. The Pd catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling of dibrominated derivative 49b (Ar1 = p-CH3OC6H4, Ar2 = Ph) with aryl boronic acids generated hexaarylated azadipyrromethenes in moderate yields (25–35%).69
 Scheme 26  Azadipyrromethene conjugated oligomers. 
The room temperature oxidative homocoupling with FeCl3 is a protocol for the facile dimerization of BF2-aza-dipyrromethene to produce 54 as reported by Bard et al. (Scheme 27).70 The coupling takes place in the β-pyrrole position with no need for a previous functionalization with an activating group. It is of interest to note that the reaction did not proceed to form polymer or higher oligomeric products.
 Scheme 27  Fe mediated homocoupling. 


3.2.5 Functionalization at the aryl rings. 
For specific applications it is attractive to extend the π-conjugation of the azadipyrromethene system and the route of choice to achieve this is via Sonogashira coupling of bromo or iodo substituted aryl rings (Scheme 28). This has been described for both tetraaryl azadipyrromethene 3, their BF2 chelates 29 and zinc complexes.71–75 Representative examples and conditions are shown in Scheme 28. This versatile approach has been exploited to substitute with ethynyl-(hexyloxy)-benzene,71 ethynyl fluorescein diacetate,72 ethynyl-N,N-dihexylaniline71,73 and ethynyl nitrofluorene74 groups to produce the constructs 56. Following alkynyl coupling with azadipyrromethenes 3, BF2 chelation of the products 55 was possible under typical chelating conditions (Scheme 28). Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling of dibrominated derivative 29 has also been reported for a range of aryl boronic acids.76
 Scheme 28  Extending π-conjugation. 
Aryl functionalization for aqueous solubility. 
The inclusion of phenol substituents on the azadipyrromethene extends the possibilities for further functionalization via ether bond formation (Scheme 29). One strategy adopted to increase the aqueous solubility of BF2-aza-dipyrromethenes is the introduction of water-solubilizing functional groups via phenolic oxygen(s). Examples of this include bis- and mono-alkyl sulfonic acid derivatives 57 and 58 which are formed by reaction of 29h or 31a with propane-1,3-sultone (Scheme 29).20,77 Both derivatives show good aqueous solubility and the ability to be uptaken into cells without need for formulation or delivery agents.
 Scheme 29  Aqueous soluble derivatives. 
Ammonium salts and cysteic acid derivatives have also been employed to enhance aqueous solubility (Scheme 30). The bis-ammonium salt derivative 59a was generated from the reaction of 29i with methyl iodide in dichloromethane.77 Ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) coupling of the meta-amino substituted 29j gave the di-cysteic acid derivative 59b which showed significantly enhanced hydrophilicity.68
 Scheme 30  Improving aqueous solubility. 
The use of clinical formulations as an alternative strategy to synthetic modification has also been employed to obtain stable aqueous solutions of fluorescent and singlet oxygen producing azadipyrromethenes allowing for their use in vitro and in vivo.7,58,61
Fluorochromes and material conjugations. 
Functionalization with aqueous solubilizing groups has formed one part of the strategies for the synthesis of several fluorochromes, i.e. fluorophores capable of bio-conjugations. For this synthesis one phenolic ring is substituted with a water solubilizing group and the other with a spacer and reactive functional group through which the covalent conjugation can be achieved (Scheme 31). Examples of conjugating functional groups incorporated by this approach include alkyne 60a,7860b,79 azide 60c,80 activated ester 60d,81 and maleimide 60e.82
 Scheme 31  Azadipyrromethene fluorochromes. 
In our own work we have utilized a multi-step synthesis to produce the bio-responsive NIR-fluorophore 65 which offers significant potential for use in live cellular and in vivo imaging.83 Emission from the probe was shown to be highly selective for cellular lysosomes, capable of real-time continuous cellular imaging of fundamental cellular processes, and allowed for direct translation to in vivo tumour imaging. The starting point of the synthesis was the BF2-chelated bis-phenol azadipyrromethene 29h, which was mono-alkylated with t-butyl bromoacetate to produce 61. A key step of the synthetic sequence was an ortho-nitration of 61 with KHSO4/KNO3 producing 62 which fine-tuned the fluorescent switching properties of the fluorophore. Following t-butyl ester hydrolysis to 63 and conversion to the activated ester fluorochrome 64 by reaction with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI), a terminal amine functionalized polyethylene glycol polymer was conjugated to make the final aqueous soluble bio-responsive NIR-fluorescent imaging agent 65 (Scheme 32).83 This route is an encouraging illustration of the level of synthetic complexity that is achievable with the azadipyrromethene scaffold.
 Scheme 32  Bio-responsive NIR-fluorescent azadipyrromethene. 
The bis-phenolic substituted derivative 29h has also been elegantly employed as starting point for the synthesis of several dyad and triad donor acceptor materials, by coupling with BODIPY,84,85 Zn-tetraarylporphyrin,85,86 Zn-phthalocyanine,87 and subphthalocyanines.88
Complementary to synthetic routes, extensive time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have been utilised to gain understanding of the structural effects on electronic structure and predict the important photophysical characteristics of this chromophore class.89–97

4 Conclusions
Since the turn of the century research interest in azadipyrromethenes has blossomed. Several strategies now exist to synthesize this important nitrogen linked bi-pyrrolic scaffold, and numerous approaches have been developed that allow structural modification post-synthesis. The key advantage of being readily able to adapt the functionality about the azadipyrromethene core has allowed for the properties of the final azadipyrromethene to be application specifically tailored. In the following tables these applications have been grouped as excited state properties (Table 1), NIR-optical sensors (Table 2), bio- and material-conjugates (Table 3), photodynamic therapy and photoredox catalysts (Table 4), solar energy materials (Table 5), and optoelectronic materials (Table 6). At this still early developmental stage of the azadipyrromethene scaffold, the future looks very promising for translation from research laboratory to real-world medical and/or material function with more leading edge applications and uses to emerge. This seems fitting, as it was traditional dye chemistry which laid the foundations for modern industrial chemistry and currently it can still be found as the basis of emerging 21st century technologies.
