In the current research, an additive engineering approach to a perovskite precursor based on sodium azide (NaN3) material was employed to fabricate stable and efficient C-PSCs. The NaN3 additive boosted perovskite solution spreading on the SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL), resulting in a well-oriented perovskite layer with improved micro-morphology. The NaN3 additive reduced non-radiative charge recombination through the reduction of the trap density within the perovskite layer. This increased the photovoltaic performance and generated C-PSCs with a champion efficiency of 14.90%, higher than the 12.94% obtained for the unmodified C-PSCs. Indeed, the NaN3 modifier increased the JSC and fill factor (FF) parameters by reducing charge transfer resistance (Rct) and increasing charge recombination resistance (Rrec). In addition, it was observed that the NaN3-modified C-PSCs present higher shelf and ambient stability than the unmodified C-PSCs, revealing the potential of the NaN3 material for assembling efficient and stable C-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained a lot of popularity in recent years since they are easy to produce and cheap to process using a solution.1,2 Materials known as organometal halide perovskites are being put to use as light-absorbing layers in solar cells. It is anticipated that the performance of these solar cells will be equivalent to that of existing silicon-based solar cells.3 The first effective development of perovskite solar cells using a metal electrode with a 3.8% efficiency occurred in 2009.4 Subsequently, significant efficiency enhancements are attained by meticulously developing materials, regulating perovskite crystallization, preventing charge recombination, speeding up carrier migration and enhancing interfacial engineering.5–11 The most common electrode materials in metal-based perovskite solar cells are typically gold, silver, or other highly conductive metals, but the formation of this metal layer requires a vacuum environment and requires a lot of energy, making it difficult to manufacture and market PSCs on a large scale.10,12,13 Carbon compounds with a work function of −5.0 eV have the potential to replace gold as the black electrode of a perovskite solar cell, which has a work function of −5.1 eV.14 Carbon electrodes have many benefits over metal electrodes, including the availability of plentiful sources, high electrochemical stability, and good hole extraction capabilities. As a result, the carbon-based electrode in perovskite solar cells has a more streamlined production process without the need for a hole transport layer. In addition to this, the hydrophobicity of the carbon electrode may play a vital role in considerably improving the solar cells’ stability.15 Perovskite solar cells using carbon material as a back electrode are commonly known as carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs).
Ku and colleagues announced the first use of carbon as a back electrode in a hole transport material (HTM)-free perovskite solar cell in 2013.14 To avoid connections between the back and front electrodes, a zirconia-isolating layer was placed on top of the TiO2 layer. This team managed a respectable 6.6% efficiency in their power conversion. After being exposed to moisture for 70 days, the stability was reduced by just 2% from its original value, demonstrating the beneficial impact of the hydrophobic carbon layer in protecting the perovskite from molecules of water. Mishra and his research team conducted a study in 2019 to investigate the influence of annealing temperature on carbon electrodes that had been produced using the screen-printing of carbon pastes.16 It was discovered that temperatures lower than 300 °C did not result in PSCs that were operational. Actually, quicker charge transfer and increased conductivity were made possible by elevated temperature sintering, which improved particle interaction. The excellent power conversion efficiencies of 8.4% and 12.5% were reached by the samples that were treated at 350 and 400 °C, respectively. For high-performance carbon-based perovskite solar cells, the additive engineering of the organometal halide perovskite layer is an efficient route. Tingting Xu and his co-worker synthesized carbon quantum dots (CQDs) from two separate carbon sources and referred to them, respectively, as A-CQD and CA-CQD.17 They then used these carbon sources as additives in the perovskite precursor solution. A CPSC cell that makes use of the A-CQD additive demonstrates improved cell performance, with a maximal efficiency of 13.3%. In addition to having strong long-term stability, the A-CQD additive-modified C-PSC retains more than 90% of its original PCE after being in the test chamber for 200 hours. Goharshadi and his team examined the effects of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-RGO) and lead halide perovskite in the solar cell as active layers.18 N-RGO dispersed in the precursor solution increased all optoelectronic parameters in the perovskite layer, increasing the PCE from 17% to more than 18%. Carbon nanodots (CNDs) made from carbonised bamboo were employed as an effective addition to the perovskite solar cells developed by Chen and his team.19 By forming hydrogen bonds with the perovskite, these CNDs, which are rich in carboxylic acids and hydroxyls, interact with the perovskite to increase the lifespan of the carriers and achieve good performance in PSCs. In the Year 2021, Zhigang Zang and his group showed that K2SO4 treatment results in a significant enhancement of the crystalline quality of the SnO2/perovskite interface, leading to improved passivation of both bulk and interface defects.20 The improved passivation leads to higher photoluminescence quantum yield and improved device performance. Experimental findings suggest that K2SO4 is an effective passivating agent for SnO2/perovskite interfaces, which could be used to further improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address the high hysteresis issue, Zang et al. used an ultrathin passivation layer of poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) at the perovskite/ETL to effectively passivate the deep trap states in PSCs.2 The PTAA layer was successfully fabricated using a spin-coating method. The optimal thickness of the PTAA layer was investigated and optimized for efficient passivation and a high FF. The PSCs with the PTAA passivation layer showed significantly improved FF and no hysteresis over a wide range of scan rates. The results suggest that the PTAA passivation layer can be a promising strategy for efficient and stable PSCs with high FF and no hysteresis. Again in the year 2022, the same group propose the use of multifunctional anion modifiers of guanidinium salts to modulate the interfacial interactions in perovskite solar cells.21 The anion modifiers are designed to form a stable and conductive layer at the SnO2/perovskite interface, which can reduce the recombination of charge carriers and improve the device efficiency. Furthermore, the anion modifiers can also improve the stability of the device by forming a protective layer that prevents the degradation of the perovskite material. The use of anion modifiers for interface engineering has been demonstrated to be effective in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Recently Zang and his group demonstrated that the synergistic effect of fluorine and sulfonyl functional groups could be used to stabilize the buried interface and thus improve the performance of perovskite solar cells.22 Specifically, we show that the presence of both functional groups creates a strong electrostatic attraction between the top and bottom electrodes, resulting in improved performance of the devices. Additionally, we discuss the implications of the results and provide recommendations for future research.
Here, by employing a facile and practical strategy based on sodium azide (NaN3) material, the photovoltaic performance and stability of C-PSCs are improved. For this mission, a desired amount of NaN3 (2% in a molar ratio to PbI2) is added into a MAPbI3 perovskite precursor and used for the preparation of a perovskite layer. It was found that the NaN3 additive improves the perovskite micro-morphology and reduces perovskite surface defects. The introduced additive facilitates charge transfer and hinders non-radiative recombination within devices, leading to a champion PCE of 14.90%. In addition, the well-oriented perovskite of modified C-PSCs leads to higher stability, where the modified devices show just 2% performance loss after 1840 h ambient air aging.
2. Experimental
a. Device fabrication
Tin(II) chloride dehydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 98%, Merck) in ethanol (EtOH, 99.8%, Merck) with a concentration of 66 mM is spin-coated over the cleaned FTO at 3000 rpm for 45 s to assemble a SnO2 thin layer. SnO2 films are annealed at 100 °C and 190 °C for 10 min and 60 min, respectively. 1.4 M MAPbI3 perovskite precursors with or without sodium azide (NaN3, 99.8%, Merck) additive are deposited on SnO2 layers through a two-step spin-coating program, 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 5000 rpm for 30 s. In the faster step, 200 μL of toluene (99.8%, Merck) anti-solvent is immediately dropped on the MAPbI3 film. The MAPbI3 films are annealed at 100 °C for 45 min. To fabricate back electrodes, carbon paste (Dyenamo, DN-CP01) was coated on the MAPbI3 layers using the dr blade method, followed by annealing at 70 °C for 30 min. Dyenamo's DN-CP01 is a carbon paste electrode designed for use in electrochemical studies. It is composed of highly conductive carbon black and a special binder to form a stable paste. The paste is a homogenous mixture of carbon black particles dispersed in a solvent, gelling agent, and binder. The carbon black particles form an electrical connection between the electrode and the electrolyte solution, allowing for electrochemical analysis. The binder helps to keep the mixture together and enhances its stability in aqueous solutions. The paste is easy to work with and can be applied to both planar and non-planar surfaces. The electrode has a wide potential range and can be used for a variety of electrochemical studies. The complete device fabrication process is depicted in Fig. 1.

b. Measurements
UV-Vis absorption spectra of samples were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrometer.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was recorded on the glass/MAPbI3 samples by a Quantaurus Tau C11367-12 spectrometer. An X-ray diffractometer (X’Pert Pro, Holland) with Cu Kα1 radiation was used to investigate the crystal structure of the perovskite layers. EIS curves of the samples in the dark were recorded using a potentiostat equipped with the frequency range of 100 mHz to 2 MHz at the open-circuit voltage. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) responses of C-PSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the simulated illumination irradiated from a calibrated solar simulator.
3. Results
In the current study to improve the efficiency and stability of C-PSCs, NaN3 material is added to the MAPbI3 perovskite precursor (in molar ratio to PbI2 content). The fabricated devices based on perovskite precursors with 1%, 2%, and 3% of NaN3 additives are named “Modified-1”, “Modified-2”, and “Modified-3”, respectively. In addition, the fabricated devices with the pure perovskite precursor are labeled “Pristine”.

Fig. 2a displays the UV-Vis spectra of perovskite layers (MAPbI3) with different amounts of the NaN3 additive. Although the NaN3 additive increased the perovskite absorption, it did not change the shape of the absorption spectra. When the amount of NaN3 additive is raised to 2%, the absorbance intensity of the MAPbI3 perovskite enhances within the 500–650 nm range, indicating improved surface coverage and uniformity of the perovskite layer, which in turn leads to improved performance and stability of the corresponding PSCs. The absorption intensity of the pristine perovskite film was the lowest, possibly a result of its inhomogeneity and deteriorating quality. The corresponding PCE and JSC summarized in Table 1 are associated with these findings. The superior efficiency of fabricated C-PSCs is supported by the fact that the strength of the absorbance intensity of perovskite films in Fig. 2a decreased in the order 2 > 3 > 1 > 0% of the NaN3 amount (Table 1). Indeed, the light absorbance capacity of the perovskite decreased by adding extra NaN3 (3%) into the perovskite precursor due to forming undesirable defects (see Fig. 4d).23,24

The Tauc plots for all samples made with and without NaN3 additive are shown in Fig. 2b. By extrapolating the variation between photon energy (hv) and (αhν)2, the value of Eg can be evaluated. 1.59 eV was found to be the value of Eg, which is in line with values reported in the literature.25 The device's electron extraction and transport mechanism can be found using steady-state photoluminescence (PL).26 We recorded PL spectra of perovskite layers fabricated based on different perovskite precursors. With the addition of NaN3, it was discovered that there is a noticeable increase in intensity (Fig. 2c). The pristine perovskite layer with the lowest PL intensity was detected. It is widely acknowledged that the lower the non-radiation recombination and the lower traps or defects, the higher the PL intensity.20,27 In other words, the modified-2 sample produces a perovskite film of higher quality along with lower traps. Careful inspections reveal that all perovskite film PL peaks, whether pristine or modified, are fixed at 780 nm without any discernible shifts.28
To evaluate the device performance, several devices having the structure of FTO/SnO2/MAPbI3 or MAPbI3 + x% NaN3 additive/carbon were fabricated. Fig. 3a displays the J–V curves of the champion devices with different amounts of NaN3 additive. The average photovoltaic parameters of PCE, fill factor (FF), short-circuit current (JSC), and open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 10 devices for each group are shown in Table 1. For the modified-2 C-PSCs, the PCE increased to 14.90%, with a JSC of 20.31 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.97 V, and an FF of 75.64%. The better film morphology and the reduced defect density may be responsible for the improved device performance, particularly the FF and VOC. With raising the additive ratio to 3%, a noticeable decrease in PCE was recorded, attributed to the introduction of defect states in the film and the formation of more non-radiation recombination centers. To confirm the devices’ repeatability, the corresponding PCE histogram of different C-PSCs is shown in Fig. 3b.

For the purpose of examining the surface morphology of perovskite films, FE-SEM was used. As seen in Fig. 4a, the pristine perovskite layer has incomplete coverage with obvious pinholes and voids. The poor pristine perovskite layer could not completely cover the SnO2 under-layer. Instead, the holes may pass through the pinholes and come into direct contact with the naked SnO2 thin layer, aggravating charge recombination and harming device performance.21 The modified-1 sample still has pinholes in the perovskite film due to the extremely low concentration of NaN3 additive (Fig. 4b). In contrast, the perovskite films in Fig. 4c and d are nearly regular and free of pinholes and exhibit bigger crystal sizes than the pristine perovskite film. The concentration of 2% additive plays a significant role in the improvement of perovskite film growth as heterogeneous nucleation sites. When the amount of NaN3 increased from 2% to 3%, some pinholes re-formed on the perovskite film, probably due to the destruction of the perovskite layer.

The crystallinity and phase purity of the MAPbI3 perovskite layers were assessed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both XRD patterns of the pristine and modified perovskite layers in Fig. 5 exhibit the same phase with different intensities. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.2°, 24.5°, and 28.5° corresponded to the (110), (111), and (220) peaks for the tetragonal crystal of the MAPbI3 layers. The modified perovskite layers have highly crystallized natures with a preferred orientation at the (110) and (220) planes with any (110) orientation. The FWHM value of the strong (110) peak was utilized to compare the crystal sizes of the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3 + x% (see Fig. 5b). As reported by Li et al.,29 azide (N3−) can act as a pseudo-halide for substitution with I− ions in the MAPbI3 perovskite, which affects the morphology, nucleation, and growth of MAPbI3. This leads to the formation of a layer with improved crystallinity and better light-harvesting behavior. According to the results, the presence of NaN3 additive caused the formation of larger perovskite crystals and a rise in crystal grain size, which enhanced the quality of the perovskite layer and the efficiency of C-PSCs. Longer charge diffusion distances and less charge recombination result from it, which is good for enhancing charge dissociation and transport. These outcomes agree with FE-SEM and PL. Besides, in the modified perovskite, the ratio of (110) perovskite phase to PbI2 phase (peak at 2θ = 12.7°) is stronger than the pristine perovskite layer, referring to the formation of a better MAPbI3 light-harvester. This agrees with the obtained higher JSC in the corresponding perovskite layer.

Inset shows the equivalent circuit for EIS responses. 
The trap density of the MAPbI3 perovskite layers was assessed by measuring the dark J–V properties of electron-only devices based on pristine and modified perovskite layers. The perovskite film with NaN3 addition has a relatively low VTFL compared to the pristine sample in Fig. 5c. Eqn (1) can be used to calculate the perovskite film's trap state density. nt = 2VTFLεε/eL2(1)where L is the thickness of the film, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and ε is the dielectric constant of MAPbI3.30–32 As a result, a lower VTFL was associated with a lower concentration of trap states. The untreated sample shows VTFL = 1.29 V and the treated sample shows VTFL = 0.97 V. The trap densities for the pristine and modified devices were obtained at 10.23 × 1015 and 7.69 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. It was concluded that the NaN3 addition decreased the trap states of the perovskite film and inhibited non-radiative recombination, which has favorable effects on the FF and the efficiency of the devices.5,33,34 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to understand the electrical characteristics of the pristine and modified C-PSCs. Their corresponding Nyquist plots and equivalent circuits are shown in Fig. 5d. EIS curves of the samples under dark conditions were recorded using a potentiostat equipped with a frequency range of 100 mHz to 2 MHz at the open-circuit voltage. The first semicircle in the high-frequency region is attributed to charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of SnO2/MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/hole transport material (HTM). The recombination phenomena at the bulk of the perovskite are related to the second semicircle (in the intermediate and low-frequency region). It was observed that the addition of NaN3 decreased the Rct from 184.4 Ω (for the pristine device) to 88.5 Ω (for the modified device), indicating improved current transfer at the interfaces. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) is raised from 974.2 Ω to 1940.4 Ω compared to the pristine device, indicating effective electron–hole recombination reduction due to defect suppression, which complementarily explains the change in the perovskite photovoltaic device's performance characteristics.22,35,36 In addition, EIS shows that the series resistance (Rs) in the modified C-PSCs is 25.4 Ω, lower than 34.2 Ω obtained for the pristine C-PSCs, indicating lower current losses at the interfaces of the modified C-PSCs. Indeed, the FF and JSC improvements can be attributed to the boosted perovskite film quality, reduced non-radiative recombination, and facilitated charge extraction.37,38
Long-term stability is one of the most important performance criteria for C-PSCs’ future commercial uses. Therefore, the longevity of the pristine and modified C-PSCs was assessed by tracing the PCE progression in a dry box with a relative humidity of lower than 20% at room temperature in the dark (Fig. 6a). The PCEs of the C-PSC with NaN3 additive exhibited exceptional stability after 2000 h, holding onto 99% of the initial value; in contrast, the pristine C-PSC's performance fell to less than 94% of its initial level, mainly attributable to pristine perovskite degradation. Fig. 6b shows the efficiency of the pristine and modified devices over time in the ambient conditions (relative humidity of 30–40% and at room temperature) under dark conditions. The modified device had significantly higher stability than the pristine device. The modified device exhibited an efficiency decrease of 2% after exposure to air for 1840 h versus a 6% decrease for the pristine devices. All of these improvements are inseparable from the improved perovskite quality.39,40

4. Conclusion
Here, it has been shown that the addition of NaN3 material into the perovskite precursor considerably raises the quality of the perovskite film: it enlarges the grain sizes, reduces the trap states and charge recombination, and subsequently increases the capacity for light absorption, resulting in an enhancement in the efficiency of C-PSCs from 12.94% to 14.90%. The use of this additive increased the stability of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells in addition to their improved efficiency. After being exposed to air for 1840 days, the performance of the modified perovskite solar cells decreased by 2% and that of the pristine cells by 6%. Since stability is the main obstacle to the commercialization of this technology, this work is expected to pave the way for additional research into alternative additives as stabilizers.
