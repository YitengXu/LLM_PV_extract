Broader context
In search for future energy supplies the application of hydrogen as an energy carrier is seen as a prospective issue. However, the implementation of a hydrogen economy is suffering from several unsolved problems. Particularly challenging is the storage of appropriate amounts of hydrogen. In this review the state-of-the-art of the CO2–HCOOH hydrogen storage system is highlighted and aspects of the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the decomposition of formic acid in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including biocatalysis, are discussed.

Introduction
A key issue for mankind is to secure a sufficient energy supply for current and future generations. The present energy resources are based mainly on fossil fuels and for the near future no basic change is assumed.1 The emerging problems are evident: (A) the progressive decrease of existing resources of fossil fuels and the depletion is just a matter of time; (B) the negative impact of current energy production on the environment, specifically the emission of greenhouse gases coupled with global warming.2 A related difficulty is the annual increase of energy needs, accelerating both resource consumption and greenhouse gas emission.3 Thus, the most important challenges for our society are the development of alternative methods for energy production and more efficient utilization of energy.4 The substitution of fossil fuels by sustainable methods is the subject of recent controversies and several approaches have been introduced or reconsidered, e.g. solar energy (solar cells), wind energy, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power, and energy from biomass.5 Solar and wind power are seen as the most promising sources for electric energy in the future. However, the issue of energy storage has to be resolved for large-scale use.6 An attractive approach can be found in biological systems: during the process of photosynthesis, living organisms transform abundant energy from the sun, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, an appropriate secondary energy source. The stored energy can be released in a carbon dioxide neutral manner under mild conditions leading to the reformation of carbon dioxide and water. Nevertheless, the maximum efficiency of photosynthesis is theoretically about 4.5%, in most cases, however, less than 1%. Therefore the process has to be improved in order to provide a viable option for human energy management.7 Water splitting imitates a part of the biological system and provides access to hydrogen as an excellent energy carrier.8 The stored energy can easily and environmental-friendly be utilized by reacting hydrogen with oxygen e.g. in fuel cells or internal combustion engines. Advantageously, only water as a non-problematic side product is formed. The most efficient way of water splitting without direct CO2 emission so far is the electrolysis of water. Reasonable high amounts of hydrogen can be produced via high pressure electrolysis with an efficiency of about 70%. Unfortunately, the process is less effective when using unsteady energy sources such as wind and solar power. To date only ca. three percent of the total hydrogen amount is produced via electrolysis.9 Apart from the mentioned difficulties the elegance of this process is evident and it could be the central step for a successful hydrogen economy provided that complementary technology is developed (Fig. 1).10
 Fig. 1  The hydrogen economy—a prospective view. 
In comparison to this, the existing access to large scale hydrogen, mainly from steam reforming of methane or the water gas shift reaction (>90% of the overall hydrogen production), needs much energy to maintain the reaction, special purification to remove carbon monoxide, and fossil fuel as feed.11 As a consequence, an irretrievable consumption of fossil fuels and pollution caused by greenhouse gases render these processes unfavorable.
Besides the search for suitable hydrogen generation processes, the storage, transport and distribution of hydrogen are still challenging, since the low volumetric energy density of gaseous hydrogen causes issues including packaging, distribution, storage, and transfer. To realize an improved energy density several hydrogen storage concepts have been envisaged. The preferred state-of-the-art techniques for hydrogen accumulation are currently based on tank systems for gaseous-pressurized hydrogen and liquid hydrogen, mainly due to the broad knowledge about and the availability of those storage systems. However, both have major drawbacks such as rather low hydrogen storage density, the requirement for high-pressure apparatus or the high energy liquefaction (about 1/3 of the lower heating value), as well as safety issues, especially when used for mobile application. Along with these systems, also chemisorption storage material (metal hydrides and other inorganic hydrogen-rich compounds) and further materials based on physisorption of hydrogen (carbon nanotubes, metal–organic frameworks, ammonia, amine boranes, phosphonium borates, doped polymers) have been investigated.12 In general, the hydride-based materials suffer from either high temperature for hydrogen release or lack of reversibility, whereas the materials based on physisorption have no reasonable storage capacity at room temperature. There has been some progress concerning reversibility of metal hydrides, e.g. more than 4 or even 5 wt% hydrogen can be stored reversibly in Na–Al13 or Mg-based systems,14 respectively. However, it has to be dealt with reaction enthalpies between 40 and 70 kJ mol−1 and high loading pressure and/or temperature for absorption.
In recent times the application of the major greenhouse gas carbon dioxide as hydrogen storage material has been proposed. This is a carbon capture and storage strategy based on the reduction of carbon dioxide with molecular hydrogen to form formic acid or methanol. Even if methanol has a higher storage capacity of two hydrogen molecules compared to one in formic acid, the use of carbon dioxide to synthesize formic acid should be preferred.15 The need for three equivalents of hydrogen to produce one equivalent of methanol results in a loss of one equivalent of hydrogen, since water is formed. In contrast, a transfer rate of 100% for formic acid formation is found. The physical properties of the storage medium formic acid e.g. liquid phase at ambient temperature, allow uncomplicated transportation, refueling, and handling which are comparable with nowadays use of diesel and gasoline, even if the hydrogen storage capacity (4.3 wt%) is poorer than that of other methods. Afterwards hydrogen can be easily produced by decomposition of formic acid at the site of use, with carbon dioxide as the only byproduct. The release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is favoured since the corresponding weight loss reduces additional transportation cost in contrast to conventional storage solutions. The produced carbon dioxide can alternatively be recycled by hydrogenation, independent on the site of evolution. However, an efficient capture of CO2 is still an unsolved problem but there is currently intensive research in progress.16 So the current industrial pollution can potentially be a short-term or mid-term feedstock for large amounts of carbon dioxide and allow the direct fixation of CO2 next to the pollution source.17
The possibility to store hydrogen in formic acid by reduction of carbon dioxide has already been suggested several decades ago.18
 Fig. 2  The hydrogen storage system: CO2–HCOOH. 
Both processes, the fixation and the evolution of hydrogen, should be supported by suitable catalysts. Usually, catalysts allow the controlling of the reaction channel and the improving of the energy efficiency by reducing the activation energy and thus the reaction temperature. In this case, reacting carbon dioxide and hydrogen at high temperature results in the formation of carbon monoxide and water (water gas shift reaction). To form selectively formic acid the presence of a catalyst is highly recommended. The non-catalyzed thermal decomposition of formic acid is dominated by two reaction channels, too: (A) the dehydration forming carbon monoxide and water and (B) the decarboxylation/dehydrogenation yielding carbon dioxide and hydrogen. For the desired pathway a higher activation energy is necessary (∼285 kJ mol−1vs. ∼251 kJ mol−1 for process A). Addition of water can decrease significantly the activation energy (∼142 kJ mol−1), but the reaction is still unselective.19 A higher selectivity can be obtained in the presence of tailor-made transition metal catalysts or biocatalysts.
In the following we highlight the state-of-the-art of the CO2–HCOOH system and discuss the aspects of this process concerning the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the decomposition of formic acid in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including biocatalysis.20
Reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid by homogeneous catalysts
For decades the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to yield formic acid in the presence of homogeneous catalysts has been the purpose of many studies. Numerous transition metal complexes based on e.g. Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd, Ni, Fe, Ti, and Mo have demonstrated excellent activities, but the sustainability of this method is restricted by the origin of hydrogen (vide supra). In 2007, an excellent review by Jessop summarized the achievements in the reduction of carbon dioxide using homogeneous catalysis until that time. In Table 1 the most active systems are summarized.21 An excellent activity is feasible in the presence of a base, because the abstraction of protons forces the reaction, which is in contrast to the thermodynamically unfavorable “base-free” reduction (Scheme 1).

Fortunately the removal of the base is not essential, since the adduct of formic acid and base allows the straightforward decomposition to hydrogen. Besides this, the reaction outcome can be improved by applying supercritical conditions, due to the high availability of carbon dioxide, while in the solution approach the solubility of carbon dioxide is the limiting factor. So far, the most active system has been invented by Jessop and co-workers.22 A turnover frequency (TOF) of 95000 h−1 was attained by applying [RuCl(OAc)(PMe3)4] under supercritical conditions (CO2-pressure: 190 bar, temperature: 50 °C). In contrast, the group of Joó reported a lower activity (TOF = 9600 h−1) with [RuCl2(TPPMS)2]2 (TPPMS = meta-monosulfonated triphenylphosphine), while the process was carried out under non-supercritical conditions (CO2-pressure: 95 bar, temperature: 80 °C) in water.23 Even if extraordinary activities were attained under supercritical conditions, the need for high pressures/high pressure equipment decreases the overall impact. In addition, some catalysts are designed to work at low temperature, but depressed catalyst activities have been observed. A noteworthy exception was found by Leitner and co-workers.24 The complex Rh(hfacac)(dcpb) (hfacac = hexafluoroacetylacetonate; dcpb = 1,4-di(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane) demonstrated outstanding activity of 1335 h−1 (TOF) at room temperature and a low CO2/H2 pressure (40 atm).
Decomposition of formic acid in the presence of homogeneous catalysts
The decomposition of formic acid in the presence of homogeneous catalysts has previously been poorly researched, despite the fact that formic acid is one of the major sources of hydrogen in the well-studied transfer hydrogenation reaction.26 However, several studies in this area have been published recently (Table 2).

The first protocol for hydrogen evolution was reported by Coffey in the late 1960s. In the presence of catalytic amounts of transition metals, e.g. Pt, Pd, Ni, Ru, Rh, Os, and Ir, modified by phosphine ligands, formic acid was gradually decomposed to carbon dioxide and hydrogen.27 The best performance was observed for iridium catalysts containing monodentate phosphine ligands. [IrH3(PPh3)3] was found as the most active system with an initial decomposition rate of ∼80 mol L−1 h−1 in refluxing acetic acid as solvent. However, a slow deactivation of the system was monitored. The catalysts lifetime could be extended by adding free triphenylphosphine. Noteworthy, during the reaction complexes containing carbon monoxide as ligand were formed, but carbon monoxide is not a component of the evolved gas.
At the beginning of the 1970s Forster and Beck investigated the decomposition of aqueous formic acid in the presence of rhodium and iridium catalysts.28 For instance [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 showed a decomposition rate of 31 mol L−1 h−1 at 100 °C. The addition of sodium iodide was crucial to obtain reasonable rates. The authors propose the formation of rhodium iodo complexes for decomposing formic acid to carbon dioxide. The iodo ligands are abstracted to form hydroiodic acid and an unsaturated metal complex, which decomposes HI to hydrogen and reform the starting rhodium iodo complex.
In the same decade Otsuka and co-workers applied [Pt{P(iPr)3}3] as a catalyst and achieved a turnover frequency of 100 h−1 at room temperature.29 The authors assumed the formation of [PtH(O2CH){P(iPr)3}2] and [PtH2(P(iPr)3)2] as intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The isolation and catalytic abilities of these complexes proved their theory.
Strauss et al. used [Rh(C6H4PPh2)(PPh3)2] as precursor. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide were formed slowly in equimolar amounts at room temperature with a ratio of two equivalents of gas per equivalent metal. After solvent removal the catalyst could be reused for further applications. The authors propose as stable intermediate the formation of a rhodium formate complex, which slowly eliminates carbon dioxide and yields a rhodium hydride complex. Finally, the reaction of the rhodium hydride complex with formic acid gives hydrogen and the formate complex.30
Based on the catalyst system established by Coffey (vide supra) the group of Trogler applied [Pt2H3(PEt3)4][BPh4] as catalyst precursor and sodium formate as the hydrogen source under improved reaction conditions. Nevertheless, a lower catalyst activity was found. The activity was decreased by the increased gas pressure of CO2 and H2. Removal of the gas leads to the original reaction.31 Recently, also molybdenum complexes have been investigated for the decomposition of formic acid. [Cp*Mo(PMe3)2(CO)H] (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentanyl) converted formic acid completely to carbon dioxide and hydrogen within one day at room temperature. A stepwise reaction is proposed via a dihydride complex [Cp*Mo(PMe3)2(CO)H2][OOCH] and a formate complex [Cp*Mo(PMe3)2(CO)(η1-OC(O)H)].32 Nicholas and Tsai investigated further the abilities of rhodium complexes. In the presence of [Rh(H2)(PMe2Ph)4]BF4 and a corresponding solvent complex [Rh(H2)(PMe2Ph)3(THF)]BF4 only slow evolution of carbon dioxide and hydrogen was monitored.33
Unmodified [Ru3(CO)12] was found to be an active catalyst at 75 °C in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of potassium hydroxide. Turnover frequencies (TOFs) up to 102 h−1 were reported.34
Later, Puddephatt and co-workers used the binuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2(µ-CO)(CO)4(µ-dppm)2] and observed extraordinary activities (TOF = 500 h−1). Several reaction parameters were investigated in detail, for instance the pH of the solution was found to be important.
The addition of triethylamine increasing the concentration of formate ions accelerated the reaction, since the concentration of formate ions is increasing and this is believed to be crucial. Additionally, acidic conditions lead to a decrease of reaction rates or even a deactivation of the catalyst. Labeling studies with DCOOH showed also a mixture of H2, HD and D2, excluding an intramolecular mechanism or indicating an activation of dihydrogen.35
In 2008 several research groups focused their research on this storage material for hydrogen. The group of Laurenczy invented a ruthenium-based system for the catalytic decomposition of a mixture of formic acid/sodium formate (ratio = 9 : 1) in aqueous solution.36 The applied ruthenium precursor [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 (tos = toluene-4-sulfonate) was modified by water soluble ligand, meta-trisulfonated triphenylphosphine (TPPTS), to allow the reaction in water. At 120 °C turnover frequencies up to 460 h−1 were feasible, while at lower temperatures fewer amounts of released hydrogen were observed. Nevertheless, the catalyst was highly active in a range of temperatures even at room temperature (elongated reaction times (∼120 h) were obligatory for the complete decomposition). In all cases conversion of 90–95% was obtained. The addition of base was crucial for achieving excellent reactivity, while the removal of the base extended the reaction time significantly. No CO contamination was shown during the analysis of the evolved hydrogen gas. This high purity permits a direct use, e.g. in fuel cells. Noteworthy, the procedure accessible by Laurenczy et al. was carried out in a continuous way, with constant formic acid addition and a constant release of hydrogen making this concept advantageous for potential future technical applications. Later on, a study dedicated to the reaction mechanism was carried out and spectroscopic investigations identified several intermediates of the catalytic cycle.37 Simultaneously, Beller and co-workers examined the ruthenium-catalyzed decomposition of formic acid under mild conditions.38 Applying unmodified [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 (p-cymene = 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)benzene) as catalyst precursor good activity at 40 °C was observed. For the activation of formic acid an appropriate base is required again, various amines (alkyl amines, diamines) and different ratios of HCOOH/amine were studied. The necessity of amines for the decomposition of formic acid as well as for its formation allows a closed cycle with the couple formic acid/carbon dioxide as hydrogen storage. An excellent catalytic performance was detected for N,N-dimethylhexylamine and N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) after 6 h. In a recently published update study, Beller et al. reported furthermore good performance by using 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN).39 Furthermore, a correlation between pKa of the base and the turnover number was presented. In the case of triethylamine as base the initial formic acid/amine ratio was investigated. Here the increase of amine content results in an increase of activity. A careful study of the hydrogen evolution during the reaction proved this fact, since the reaction rate increased with decrease of formic acid concentration. For further studies the system formic acid/triethylamine (ratio 5 : 2) was applied, because of its commercial availability and easy handling. A long term experiment showed that the catalyst was still active after 42 h; 2728 mL hydrogen were generated during this period, corresponding to 93% conversion of formic acid. The addition of a new aliquot of formic acid to this mixture also showed the ability to be reused. Furthermore, the catalyst activity was dramatically improved by modifying the ruthenium precursor with phosphine ligands. The commercially available complex [RuCl2(PPh3)3] demonstrated turnover frequencies up to 417 h−1 (2 h) and 90% conversion after 3 hours at 40 °C. No significant loss of activity was observed by decreasing the temperature to 26.5 °C (TOF = 408 h−1). Because of the poor solubility of [RuCl2(PPh3)3] in formic acid/triethylamine, dimethylformamide (DMF) was added resulting in a higher solubility accompanied by slightly increased turnover frequency (TOF = 445 h−1). However, the maximum volume of hydrogen is obtained when pretreating the complex in DMF at 80 °C for 2 hours. Thus an extraordinary catalyst activity of 2688 h−1 was achieved. Note that in situ generation of the catalyst (RuCl3·H2O + 3 equivalents PPh3) resulted in an activity decrease of 23%. An analysis of the gas mixture highlighted a high purity of the hydrogen without further impurifications. Finally, the best hydrogen evolution system was connected to a H2/O2 PEM (Polymer Electrolyte Membrane) fuel cell. Here an electric power of ∼47 mW at a potential of 374 mV for more than 29 hours was feasible.
Later on, Beller and co-workers tested several ruthenium precursors and achieved a superior activity of 3630 h−1 with a catalyst produced in situ from RuBr3 and PPh3 (3 equiv).40 This is the highest activity observed until that point for this reaction. However, during reaction progress a deactivation occurred. In the case of [RuCl2(benzene)]2/PPh3 no deactivation took place. For further studies this system was chosen, even though the conversion attained was an order of magnitude lower. Several monodentate and bidentate phosphorus ligands were screened in combination with [RuCl2(benzene)]2. Here best results were viewed with bidentate ligands such as 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) and 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp) with activities of 852 and 1376 respectively (TON, 3 h). In the case of [RuCl2(benzene)]2/dppe the reaction was boosted to TON 1644 by increasing the amount of base. More recently Beller et al. found a pronounced effect of visible light irradiation on the decomposition rate. Applying [RuCl2(benzene)]2/PPh3 as catalyst a significant increase of hydrogen evolution (TON = 1321, 25 °C) compared to the dark reaction (TON = 217, 25 °C) was observed.41
In 2008 Fukuzumi and co-workers demonstrated the abilities of a water soluble rhodium complex namely [Rh(Cp*)bpy)(H2O)]SO4 (bpy = bipyridine).42 Starting from an aqueous solution of formic acid/sodium formate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were cleanly accessible at room temperature albeit an adjustment of the pH during the reaction was necessary to achieve a good performance. The maximum TOF of >80 h−1 was obtained at the pKa value of HCOOH. This catalyst showed also a constant activity during several additions of fresh formic acid. Furthermore a detailed study concerning the reaction mechanism was figured out. The hydrogen is formed via the formate complex, [Rh (Cp*){OC(O)H}(bpy)]+, followed by the rate-determining β-hydrogen elimination to provide the hydride complex, [Rh (Cp*)(H)(bpy)]+. This complex undertakes competitive H/D exchange once with D2O and secondly with D2 to yield HD. The authors claim that the protic and hydritic nature of [Rh(Cp*)(H)(bpy)]+ is in charge for the hydrogen evolution.
Quite recently, the group of Wills presented highly active ruthenium complexes for the decomposition of formic acid.43 Simple ruthenium compounds showed extraordinary activities of up to 18000 h−1 (TOF) at 120 °C. In comparison to the work of Beller the addition of phosphine as ligand decreased the activity, which probably reflects different catalytic species.
Reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid by heterogeneous catalysts
The first attempt to synthesize formic acid from carbon dioxide with a heterogeneous catalyst was already published in 1935.44 The reactions were carried out with RANEY® nickel as catalyst under 200–400 bar overall hydrogen pressure and 80–150 °C. However, one equivalent of amine had to be added in order to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium towards product formation (Scheme 1).
In general, only a few reports on the direct conversion of carbon dioxide to form formic acid were published until now. Possible reasons are the unfavorable reaction conditions (high temperature, high pressure) compared to homogeneous catalysts and the high efficiency of current formic acid synthesis at the main producer BASF (carbonylation of methanol, followed by hydrolysis of methyl formate).45 An additional problem is caused by the low chemoselectivity of heterogeneous processes, as formic acid can act as an intermediate to form methanol or methane. Indeed, the industrial methanol synthesis with syngas over a Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 catalyst46 probably works via formation of surface formate as intermediate, which was furthermore proven by various groups with Cu(100), Cu(110) and Cu(111) catalysts.47
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on an amalgamated nickel cathode has been used for production of formic acid by Williams and co-workers. However, the energetic efficiency of maximal 60% and the fact that the concentration of formic acid is limited to 4 mol L−1 are severe drawbacks of this method.18
The reduction of carbonates to formic acid under mild reaction conditions was demonstrated by Wiener et al. applying Pd/C as catalyst.48 A strong influence of both carbonate and hydrogen concentration on the initial reaction rates was observed. However, due to the chemical equilibrium between carbonate and formate the reaction could not be run to completeness. Further problems are the decrease of solubility of carbonate with increasing formate concentration and the separation of the product from the reaction mixture.
Takahashi et al. reported the formation of mainly methane in the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide over nickel in water at 300 °C in the presence of iron oxide and iron. Formic acid was only observed as an intermediate. Interestingly, a change to basic conditions yields formic acid as main product and methanol as side product. In all cases the catalytic activity was very low (TOFs < 1 h−1).
Very recently, the group of Han demonstrated the synthesis of formic acid from CO2 with the help of the ionic liquid [mammim][OTf] (1-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2,3-dimethylimidazolium trifluoromethane-sulfonate) and a supported Ru catalyst of the type “Si”–(CH2)3–NH(CSCH3)–RuCl3–PPh3. At a total pressure of 18 bar (H2 : CO2 = 1 : 1) a maximum TOF of 103 h−1 was achieved. The activity has been proven to be constant over 5 cycles. The catalyst performance is sensitive to both the ratio of H2 : CO2 and the overall pressure, indicating the possibility to increase the reaction rate by increasing pressure.49
Decomposition of formic acid in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts
The decomposition of formic acid in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts has been studied since the 1930s. Many heterogeneous systems have been investigated in detail (e.g. glass, metals, metal oxides and supported metal catalysts). Even if excellent decomposition activities were achieved, the need for high reaction temperatures (>100 °C) lowers the impact of those catalysts. In addition, two main reaction pathways are often observed: (A) the dehydration forming carbon monoxide and water and (B) the decarboxylation/dehydrogenation yielding carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Scheme 2). Table 3 provides a summary of activation energies and selectivity of different heterogeneous catalysts.

Rienäcker presented systematic investigations on the decomposition of formic acid vapor over wires of Cu, Ag, Au, Cu–Au and Ag–Au alloys under normal pressure.50 The estimated activation energies are 98 kJ mol−1 (Cu), 109 kJ mol−1 (Ag) and 122 kJ mol−1 (Au) for the pure metals, respectively. Alloying led to an increase of the activation energy, but also to an increased reaction rate. Interestingly, carbon monoxide was only observed when Au was part of the catalyst, whereas Cu and Ag led to the selective decomposition to CO2 and H2. Similar investigations on Cu, Pd and mixed crystals of these elements resulted in activation energies of 98 kJ mol−1 (Cu), 54 kJ mol−1 (62% Pd, 38% Cu) and 34 kJ mol−1 (100% Pd).51 For Cu–Ni alloys, the maximum activity was found for Cu82Ni18,52 whereas the highest catalytic activity was observed for the mixture of Pd and Cu.
In 1950 Dowden and Reynold reported the decomposition of formic acid over Ni, Cu and alloys of those metals.53 At 253 °C they observed the highest activity for pure Ni with a gas production rate of 20 mL min−1 cm2. Unfortunately, no information of the purity of the product gas is given.
In the late 1970's Williams et al. applied Pd on carbon particles as decomposition catalyst.56 Using a loading of 1% Pd ∼60 cm3 hydrogen was detected after 10 min. Noteworthy, the reaction was carried out at room temperature.
Sexton investigated the decomposition of formic acid on Cu(100) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).57 At 127 °C he observed a surface layer of formate which decomposed within a temperature range of 152 and 227 °C to form H2 and CO2.
A review of Madix pointed out that decomposition of formic acid on Ni(110) and Ni(100) leads mainly to dehydration under formation of CO and H2O whereas Fe(100), Cu(110), Cu(100), Ru(100), Pt(111) and Ag(110) react with formic acid under formation of surface formate as intermediate of the decomposition to either carbon monoxide or dioxide and H2.58

Kisfaludi et al. investigated the effect of crystallite size on CO–CO2 selectivity in the decomposition of formic acid over meltspun amorphous ribbons and ribbons with crystalline Fe particles.59 The crystallized ribbons prefer dehydration as decomposition pathway whereas the amorphous ribbons produce mainly H2 and CO2.
Another attempt to tune the selectivity was provided by Solymosi and Kovacs showing the selective decomposition of formic acid to CO and H2O over Pd(100) without formation of surface formate. However, preabsorbed K led to HCOOK formation on the metal surface. The decomposition products were H2 and CO2 but also CO in equal amounts, which can be explained by the high decomposition temperature of >400 °C.60
However, very recently the group of Xing described a catalyst material which overcomes this problematic aspect and produces high quality hydrogen at reasonable temperature (92 °C).61 Several alloys on charcoal composed of palladium and elements from the copper-group (Cu, Ag, Au) were studied and compared with unmodified palladium on charcoal. Best decomposition of formic acid/sodium formate was demonstrated by 30 mg Pd–Au/C with a volume of 260 mL after 125 min. Even if small quantities of carbon monoxide were detected (<80 ppm) the quality of the produced hydrogen is reasonable for a direct use in fuel cells. The effect of gold and silver was explained by the formation of smaller nanoparticles and a lower rate of carbon monoxide adsorption. In addition several reaction parameters were studied and a dramatic influence of CeO2(H2O)x as an additive was observed. Here 60 mg of Pd–Au–CeO2 (10 wt% Pd, 50 wt% and Pd : Au 3 : 3) produce 1640 mL min−1 g−1 reforming gas, which corresponds to a power density of 135 W g−1.
Recently, Iglesia and Ojeda studied the abilities of gold cluster supported on Al2O3.62 In comparison to Pt/Al2O3 higher metal time yields were accessible for the decomposition of formic acid at ∼80 °C. Only small amounts of CO were formed during the process (<10 ppm). A crucial parameter for excellent turnover rates is the Au-cluster size, since a smaller cluster size gave a higher decomposition rate. In addition, mechanistical studies were performed and two possible processes were proposed: (A) H-assisted formate decomposition or (B) a sequential cleavage of O–H and C–H and subsequent H-atom recombination.
Very recently, the group of Yi demonstrated the efficient photocatalytical decomposition of formic acid over TiO2 nanorods. More than 80% of the formic acid could be decomposed within 45 min. However, the need of a diluted aqueous solution and a source for radiation makes this approach insufficient for practical applications.63
Decomposition of formic acid in the presence of biocatalysts
The cleavage reaction of formic acid to form molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide catalyzed by biological systems is well known since several decades.64 As pointed out above, an increasing demand results in intensive research concerning this type of “bio”-hydrogen-production carried out by several types of microorganisms.65 Furthermore, it is proposed that until the end of this century the hydrogen from biomass will contribute in a significant manner to the overall hydrogen production.66
Formation of hydrogen produced biochemically can generally be classified as follows: (A) photodecomposition of organic compounds by photosynthetic bacteria; (B) dark fermentation of organic compounds and (C) hybrid systems, which are subdivided into the utilization of fermentative and photosynthetic bacteria or bioelectrochemical assisted bioreactors.67 Within this system the cleavage reaction of formate is performed by dark fermentation and may also be coupled in hybrid systems. The fermentative and photosynthetic combination of biohydrogen production can gain a total degradation of the substrate (e.g. glucose) ending in maximum hydrogen yields and the side product carbon dioxide, a fact which was recently discussed intensively.68 The subsection of formate cleavage is carried out by a formate hydrogen lyase (FHL)-complex present in various microbial genera, including Enterobacter, Methanogens and photosynthetic bacteria (Table 4). Exemplary for Escherichia coli this FHL-complex usually consists of a formate dehydrogenase (FDHH), a hydrogenase (Hyd-3), and an electron transfer mediator as subunits.69 The complex is usually situated at the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane.70 These enzyme classes are very diverse, e.g. hydrogenases can formally be separated into 3 classes: (A) HMD (H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase) or [Fe]-hydrogenases; (B) [NiFe]-hydrogenases and (C) [FeFe]-hydrogenases.67

Their role in living cells is methanogenesis (formation of methane), nitrogen fixation (reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia), bioremediation (mainly the reductive dehalogenation of toxic compounds), pathology (direct production of hydrogen as a by-product of carbohydrate fermentation) and direct hydrogen formation for several reasons. For formate dehydrogenases several isoenzymes have been reported, e.g. for E. coli.77 Inside this reaction cascade formate is cleaved by the enzymes formate dehydrogenase (FDHH) and hydrogenase (Hyd 3) forming carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  FHL-complex of E. coli (simplified); FDH—Formate Dehydrogenase; Hyd—Hydrogenase, FHL—Formate Hydrogen Lyase. 
As intermediate electron transfer mediators e.g. ferredoxin is described for various microorganisms.78 Within biological systems, the final formation of molecular hydrogen is mandatory for the reoxidation of the electron transfer mediator.79 The original source of formate is not of importance, also an external addition of formate produces hydrogen almost momentarily.80 On the other hand, it may be more practical to produce hydrogen directly from glucose (see below) than by adding or overproducing formic acid.81
Unfortunately, formic acid undergoes several other intracellular side reactions, which result in a loss of the overall hydrogen amount, e.g. the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Due to hydrogen-uptake reactions the presence of further hydrogenases (e.g. Hyd1 and Hyd2 in E. coli) leads as well to a considerable loss of hydrogen.82 Zhao et al. successfully suppressed the corresponding hydrogenase genes in E. aerogenes achieving a noteworthy increase in hydrogen evolution of 3.37 liter hydrogen per hour and gram dry cell weight.83 FHL-overexpressing in E. coli strains at high cell density results also directly in an enhanced hydrogen production of 23.6 g hydrogen L−1 h−1.69 However, the yield remaining is still limited to 4 mol hydrogen per 1 mol substrate (based on glucose), the practical maximum was found to be 3.8 mol H2 per mol substrate.
Various reactor concepts have been designed to obtain hydrogen in high amounts (Table 5).84 Several impurities (e.g. H2S) may have to be removed for high quality hydrogen, e.g. for the usage in fuel cells.85 The resulting organic acids (e.g. acetic acid) are also possible substrates for the production of additional hydrogen. Photofermentation might lead to an increase of the overall hydrogen yield (see below).

Reduction of carbon dioxide by biocatalysts
Primarily, the direct fixation of carbon dioxide was considered to be an exclusive property of green plants and autotrophic bacteria, until Wood and Werkman showed in 1936 successfully the first metabolising of CO2 by other organisms, yielding eventually succinic acid.90 Beginning from this point several reaction mechanisms for CO2-fixation were investigated and discussed.91 However, the main product is acetate, while formate is only formed as an intermediate, which was proven by the incorporation of 14C-labeled substrates in Clostridium thermoaceticum.92
Numerous direct reduction reactions of carbon dioxide to formate, catalyzed by formate dehydrogenases, have also been described. Ruschig et al. reported for the FDH from Pseudomonas oxalaticus a significant difference for the Michaelis–Menten constant for CO2 (40 mM) and formic acid (0.1 mM). Under the given reaction conditions the formate oxidation was 30 times faster than the carbon dioxide reduction.93 The usage of ferredoxin was reported in the reduction reaction for an enzyme isolated from Clostridium pasteurianum.94 Systematic approaches by using free and immobilised (alginate–silica hybrid gel) FDH gave excellent yields of up to 98.8% for formic acid formation.95 In these cases reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH + H+) acts as a terminal electron donor for the enzymatic reaction. Recently, Reda et al. reported an NAD(P)H-free reduction of carbon dioxide. By direct immobilisation of the FDH on an electrode surface the electron transfer could be achieved by electrochemical methods. High thermodynamic efficiencies up to 96.6% were reached at an applied potential of −0.41 V. Advantageously, no side reactions were detected while the reaction rates were still very high (approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the reduction of carbon dioxide by ruthenium complexes in supercritical carbon dioxide).96
In a more general view on carbon dioxide reduction several other substrates were found for the formate (and subsequently bio-hydrogen) synthesis in living cells and have been discussed recently.97 By combining dark fermentation (formate cleavage) and photofermentation strategies (e.g. decomposition of organic acids) a continuous production of hydrogen is possible (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Schematic hydrogen production pathways including formate cleavage and photofermentation (simplified) (PFL—Pyruvate-Formate-Lyase, FHL—Formate-Hydrogen-Lyase). 
The cleavage of both formate and organic acids yields carbon dioxide, which may be “reduced” back to biomass (inclusive formic acid) via conventional routes to start again bio-hydrogen formation.
Conclusions
The advantages of the hydrogen economy are evident, even if enormous research efforts must be carried out to achieve the necessary technology improvements. The search for an efficient and safe hydrogen storage system is probably the most crucial step. Various systems have been presented, but most of them display some difficulties. The combination of carbon dioxide and formic acid as a hydrogen storage system might act as an elegant and simple concept. The reduction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen in the presence of homogeneous catalysts is currently an efficient method with excellent activities, but until now no large-scale process is described. On the other side, the heterogeneously catalyzed formation of formic acid from carbon dioxide is less efficient and selective. Additionally, the nature-based approach is also well studied. In contrast to homogeneous catalysts, pathways performed by enzymes or enzyme complexes suffer from a number of disadvantages, e.g. biological systems consist of more complicated paths with several side activities and show therefore lower energy efficiency. The low resistance to temperature fluctuations might be another weakness.
The corresponding oxidation of formic acid, generating the desired hydrogen and as by-product carbon dioxide, is currently investigated for homogeneous catalysts and shows general applicability under several working conditions and high substrate concentrations. However, there is a need for even more active catalysts for future purposes. Comparing the results achieved by Beller and co-workers (electric power of ∼47 mW) with the energy demand for an incandescent lamp (60 W), the long distance is apparent for reaching a general application of presented method. Heterogeneous catalysts suffer from selectivity problems, probably induced by the high reaction temperatures needed in most cases. The cleavage reaction of formic acid is also known for biological systems, making the direct use of free enzymes or whole cells as biocatalysts feasible for hydrogen production. Direct formic acid decomposition by living cells while hydrogen was created almost instantly with high yields and efficiency was described in detail. Nonetheless, the applicability of those living cell systems seems to be limited to hydrogen production from other sources (e.g. glucose, waste water, etc.) while formic acid acts only as an intermediate product. Unfortunately, the low resistance to temperature variations seems to limit the applicability especially for mobile hydrogen-production requirements.
In conclusion, formic acid seems to be an environmental friendly hydrogen storage system due to its uncomplicated non-toxic behaviour and easy storage. For the carbon dioxide reduction, as well as formic acid oxidation, homogeneous catalysts and biocatalysts were developed and studied in detail although for practicality reasons the chemical pathways are presently more applicable. The described methods are currently designed for small scale processes, but need further research activities especially for mobile applications.

Broader context
In search for future energy supplies the application of hydrogen as an energy carrier is seen as a prospective issue. However, the implementation of a hydrogen economy is suffering from several unsolved problems. Particularly challenging is the storage of appropriate amounts of hydrogen. In this review the state-of-the-art of the CO2–HCOOH hydrogen storage system is highlighted and aspects of the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide and the decomposition of formic acid in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including biocatalysis, are discussed.
