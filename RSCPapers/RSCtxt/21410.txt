    , Accepted 8th September 2015First published on 11th September 2015AbstractConsiderable effort has been made to fabricate graphene (GR)/semiconductor composite photocatalysts, by using graphene oxide (GO) as the most widely used precursor of GR, toward an improved efficacy of solar energy conversion. However, thus far, the role of GO in the preparation and photocatalytic activity of GR/semiconductor composites has remained rather elusive. Herein, we report a simple yet efficient approach to significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of GR/semiconductor CdS composites via the acid treatment of GO, which downsizes GO sheets into smaller ones with enhanced colloidal stability and oxygenated functional groups. The graphene/CdS composites, which are prepared using this type of downsized GO as the precursor of GR, exhibit remarkably higher visible-light photoredox activity than those prepared from the direct reduction of GO without acid treatment. Our comparative results directly highlight the important effect of physico-chemical features of GO on the preparation and thus photoactivity of GR/semiconductor composites; in particular, the rational tailoring of GO could open a new doorway to optimize the activity of GO-derived GR/semiconductor composite photocatalysts.
Introduction
Harvesting solar energy in a sustainable manner has received worldwide interest because of increasing energy and environmental concerns.1 In this context, conversion of photo energy to storable chemical energy enabled by photocatalysts, which are used to drive chemical reactions by mimicking natural photosynthesis, represents a promising strategy for utilizing the unlimited solar energy.1,2 The efficiency of solar energy conversion over semiconductor photocatalysts essentially depends on four key processes: light absorption, photogenerated charge separation, charge migration and recombination, and charge utilized for the target photoredox reaction. In general, the low solar-energy-conversion efficiency over photocatalysts is due to limitations in one or more of these four processes. For example, the most commonly used TiO2 absorbs only ultraviolet (UV) light, which accounts for less than 5% of the total solar irradiation, and is subject to a fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Therefore, it has remained a significant and broad theme to adopt different strategies, e.g., doping with metal or non-metal elements, dye photosensitization and constructing interfacial heterojunctions, to improve the efficacy of photosynthesis reactions with the use of semiconductor photocatalysts.
Recently, tremendous efforts have been made to fabricate a variety of graphene (GR)/semiconductor (e.g., CdS, CdSe, TiO2, ZnO, BiVO4, MoS2) composites with different structures and morphologies and to use them as versatile photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and storage.1,3–16 In this respect, interest largely originates from the capability of GR in accepting and transferring electrons that are photogenerated from the band-gap-excitation of a semiconductor upon light irradiation.1,3–9 Consequently, the separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated charge carriers, i.e., electron–hole pairs, in the GR/semiconductor composite system are boosted, which thereby are able to improve the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor toward target photoredox processes.1,3–16
Regarding the synthesis of GR/semiconductor composite photocatalysts, graphene oxide (GO), owing to its amenable and flexible solution processability,1,6,7,17–20 is often adopted as the precursor of GR. GO-derived GR can be used in many forms, e.g., single- or few-layer thin films,1,3,7,21–23 thicker paper-like materials24,25 and porous three-dimensional architectures,26,27 which result in a variety of GR/semiconductor composites with unique structural morphology and thus tunable photocatalytic activity. Unfortunately, so far, the effect of the precursor GO chemistry on the preparation and photocatalytic activity of GR/semiconductor composites has remained unclear, although it is notable that (i) the colloidal stability and surface reactivity of GO in solution are highly dependent on their size or oxygenated functionality;28,29 (ii) the electronic property of graphene is also highly dependent on their size, shape and/or morphology.28,30–32 Therefore, it can be intuitively inferred that the physico-chemistry features (e.g., the size, shape, morphology or colloidal stability) of the precursor GO must play a crucial role in reducing GO and determining the photocatalytic performance of the resulting GO-derived GR/semiconductor composites. But the direct and robust experimental evidence addressing this significant fundamental issue still remains rather elusive.
Herein, we report a simple yet efficient approach to significantly enhance the photocatalytic activity of GR/semiconductor CdS composites by ultrasonic treatment of the GO, which is prepared by a well-established modified Hummers’ method,1,3–8,33–37 in acidic solutions. This treatment breaks GO sheets down to smaller ones as well as markedly increasing the density of oxygenated functional groups and colloidal stability. Solvothermal reduction of the acid-treated GO (abbreviated as GO-A) forms the graphene (GR-A) that exhibits much higher electrical conductivity than the graphene (GR) synthesized without treatment. On the platform of these two different precursors (GO and GO-A), by adopting a one-step solvothermal method, the semiconductor CdS nanoparticles are well carpeted onto the sheets, by which we obtained the CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A composites featuring analogous intimate interfacial contacts but with different sheet sizes and charge transport behaviors. Direct comparison under identical reaction conditions highlights that the CdS/GR-A composites exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than CdS/GR under visible light. These encouraging results strongly underpin the importance of promoting artificial photoredox processes over graphene/semiconductor-based composites by controlling the GO or GR component features.
Results and discussion
The original GO, as prepared by a modified Hummers’ method,1,3–14,38 has widely been used as the precursor of GR to prepare various GO-derived GR/semiconductor composites. The ultrasonic treatment of the original GO results in GO-A with significant changes in two aspects. One is that the average lateral size and thickness of GO-A sheets are distinctly different from those of the original GO sheets, as evidenced by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 1A–E and S1†). The original GO sheets exhibit an apparent thickness of either 1.8 nm or 0.9 nm, which corresponds to the thickness of a bilayer or monolayer of GO.23 The average lateral sizes of the original GO sheets vary from 0.3 to 1.3 μm. In contrast, the lateral size dimensions of the GO-A sheets are remarkably decreased to the range of 30 to 400 nm, suggesting that the treatment significantly reduces the lateral sizes of graphene oxide sheets. Additionally, the apparent thickness of GO-A sheets is predominantly about 0.9 nm, corresponding to the thickness of monolayer graphene oxide,23,39 thus indicating that the decreased size of the GO-A sheets leads to the reduced probability of overlapping of the GO layers.28 The size change of graphene oxide sheets can also be reflected by the difference between UV-vis absorption spectra of the aqueous dispersion of GO and GO-A sheets, as shown in Fig. 1F. The original GO exhibits an absorption peak at 231 nm, while the absorption peak of GO-A significantly blue-shifts to 202 nm, implying a remarkable decrease of the extent of π-conjugation domains in graphene oxide sheets.40

In addition to the decrease of lateral size and thickness, the other significant change after acid treatment of the GO sheets is that the content of oxygenated functional groups remarkably increases. Fig. 1G and H compare the C 1s spectra of the GO and GO-A samples, showing that the relative intensity of the peaks corresponding to the C–O and CO bonds increases obviously in the GO-A sheets. The estimated C/O atomic ratio of GO-A is 1.8, which is much lower than that of the original GO (i.e., 2.4), indicating that the ultrasonication of GO sheets in acidic solution can further oxidize the GO sheets to introduce more oxygenated functional groups on their surface. The decreased lateral size and increased density of oxygenated functional groups endow the GO-A nanosheets with a higher edge-to-area ratio28,29 and higher charge density, as evidenced by the more negative zeta-potential value (−67.4 mV) than that of GO (−51.2 mV), as shown in Fig. S2.† Additionally, the aqueous dispersion of GO-A sheets displays a significantly enhanced colloidal stability than that of the corresponding GO sheets (Fig. S3†). This is in accordance with its greatly reduced size and increased charge density. After the solvothermal reduction of GO (or GO-A) to GR (or GR-A), the dispersibility of GR-A is also better than that of GR (Fig. S4†), which can be attributed to the fact that the GR-A sheets with smaller lateral sizes are less likely to aggregate due to the reduced overlapping area and decreased π–π stacking interaction energies between the graphene nanosheets.28
The GR-A sample derived from the reduction of the GO-A sheets exhibits a much higher electrical conductivity than the GR sample derived from the original GO sheets. As shown in Fig. 1I, under the pressure range of 2–20 MPa, the resistivity–pressure (R–P) curves of the GR and GR-A samples show that the resistivity of GR-A is much lower than that of GR. Since the electrical conductivity is the inverse of resistivity (1/R), the result clearly demonstrates that the conductivity of GR-A is higher than that of GR. Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of electrodes made of GR and GR-A sheets recorded in the dark (Fig. S5†) indicate that the charge transfer resistance of GR-A is much lower than that of GR, also suggesting a higher electrical conductivity of GR-A than that of GR. Such an enhanced electrical conductivity of the GR-A sheets would be beneficial for the transfer process of photogenerated charge carriers across the interface between graphene and semiconductor,1,3,4,7–9 and thus improve the photocatalytic activity of graphene/semiconductor composites. A series of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A composites with different weight addition ratios of graphene were fabricated via a simple solvothermal reduction process. The solvothermal reduction of the GO-A or GO sheets in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of cadmium acetate (Cd(OAC)2) and graphene oxide can produce CdS/graphene composites with excellent intimate interfacial contact between the graphene sheets and CdS nanocrystals.8,41 The as-prepared CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A possess similar XRD patterns (Fig. S6†). The well-resolved broad diffraction peaks are consistent with the reflection of the cubic crystalline lattice of CdS.8,41 No typical diffraction peaks of GR or GR-A are observed, which could be ascribed to the fact that the relatively low diffraction intensity of graphene might be shielded by the main peak of CdS.3,42 The estimated average crystallite sizes of CdS particles in CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A based on the Scherrer's formula calculations from the XRD patterns are similar when the weight ratio of graphene is identical (Table S1†). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) show that the CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A samples display an analogous light absorption fingerprint (Fig. S7†). With the increased addition ratio of GR or GR-A, the enhanced light absorption of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A from 520 to 800 nm can be attributed to the intrinsic background absorption of black colored graphene. The similarity in XRD and DRS results suggests that the use of GO-A instead of GO has no significant influence on the crystal phase, the crystallite size and the light absorption property of the CdS/GR-A and CdS/GR composites.

Fig. 2A, B and S8† display typical SEM images of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A with 5% graphene (with the optimal photocatalytic activity examples, as discussed later). It can be found that the CdS particles carpet the graphene (GR and GR-A) surface densely, implying that graphene is intimately integrated with the semiconductor CdS in both the CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A samples. In addition, it is notable that, in comparison with CdS/5%GR, no apparently large sheets can be observed in CdS/5%GR-A. This is consistent with the size difference between precursor GO and GO-A, as discussed above. This size-induced morphology difference between CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A is further evidenced by the TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the CdS/5%GR sample features a sheet-like structure with a large lateral size dimension. In contrast, the sheet size of CdS/5%GR-A is much smaller. The HR-TEM images of both CdS/5%GR (Fig. 2E) and CdS/5%GR-A (Fig. 2F) display a characteristic lattice fringe of the (111) crystallographic plane of cubic CdS. The identified graphene layers in the edge area of CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A confirm the intimate interfacial contact between CdS and graphene, demonstrating that the use of GO-A instead of GO as the precursor of graphene has no obvious influence on the contact interface between graphene and semiconductor CdS in the resulting graphene/CdS composites. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in the insets of Fig. 2C and D indicate that both CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A possess a polycrystalline structure, in accordance with the XRD results. CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A were also characterized by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. S9.† The characteristic Raman mode of cubic CdS and graphene can be readily identified. Notably, the ID/IG ratio is 1.01 for CdS/5%GR-A, which is higher than the 0.99 for CdS/5%GR, confirming the decrease in the average size of in-plane sp2 domains of graphene39,43 in CdS/5%GR-A. The increased ID/IG value in the current work is mainly caused by the decrease of the average size of in-plane sp2 domains of graphene in GR-A compared to GR, which has also been demonstrated by Ruoff et al. and Gao et al. in previous research works.39,43 This case is significantly different from the comparison of Raman spectra for graphene with a similar lateral size, for which the higher ratio of ID/IG is often ascribed to a higher defect density. For the GR-A sheet with a much smaller lateral size than GR, the presence of more edges or corners on the small-sized GR-A sheet can directly lead to the higher value of ID/IG than that of large-sized GR. However, as reflected from the resistivity–pressure (R–P) curves in Fig. 1I, the GR-A shows a much higher electrical conductivity than GR, which suggests that for the graphene sheets with remarkably different lateral sizes, the value of ID/IG cannot be used as the only criterion to qualitatively judge the electrical conductivity of the graphene sheet.

The photocatalytic activity of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A composites was compared by using two typical redox reactions, including aerobic oxidation of alcohols and anaerobic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds.3,8,44–46Fig. 3 shows the results of photocatalytic aerobic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol and anaerobic reduction of 4-nitroaniline over CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A under visible light irradiation. It is seen that, toward the two probe reactions, the optimal weight ratio for achieving the optimal performance is the same in both CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A samples, i.e., 5%. However, the photocatalytic activity of the two optimal samples is significantly different. The CdS/5%GR-A displays a remarkably improved activity as compared with CdS/5%GR. Within 80 min of visible light irradiation, the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over CdS/5%GR-A is about 80%, which is much higher than the 30% conversion obtained over CdS/5%GR. Additionally, over the optimal CdS/5%GR-A and CdS/5%GR photocatalysts, the primary product for oxidation of benzyl alcohol is benzaldehyde with a high selectivity (>95%). Regarding the anaerobic selective reduction of 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) to p-phenylenediamine (PPD), the conversion can reach up to 95% over CdS/5%GR-A after visible light irradiation of 60 min, while the conversion of 4-NA over CdS/5%GR is only 74% even for a much longer visible light irradiation time (i.e., 240 min). The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis further confirms that the primary product is PPD with a high selectivity (>95%). Blank experiments performed in the absence of catalysts and/or visible light show no conversion of benzyl alcohol or 4-NA, confirming that the reaction is really driven by photocatalytic process with the assistance of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A catalysts. Additionally, negligible conversion is achieved using a bare GR or GR-A sample under visible light irradiation, suggesting that semiconductor CdS is the primary photoactive ingredient, while the role of GR or GR-A is as a charge dispensing medium and co-catalyst for the reactions.
 Fig. 3  Time-online profiles of the conversion of benzyl alcohol in aerobic conditions (A) and 4-nitroaniline in anaerobic conditions (B) over the CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A composites under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). 
Control experiments using radical scavengers (Fig. S10†) show that the photoreduction of 4-NA is driven by photogenerated electrons because the addition of an electron scavenger, K2S2O8, completely terminates the reaction under visible light.3 In addition, the anaerobic condition under N2 atmosphere guarantees an efficient occurrence of the photoreduction process. With regard to photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Fig. S11†), the primary active radical species are photogenerated holes, electrons, and activated oxygen (e.g., superoxide radicals). Notably, although photogenerated electrons cannot directly participate in the oxidation reaction, they can activate molecular oxygen for the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol.38,47 To ensure if this significant photocatalytic activity enhancement is general for such redox reactions, we further examined the time-online activity of photocatalytic oxidation of other benzylic alcohols (e.g., 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 4-fluorobenzyl alcohol, 4-chlorobenzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol) and the reduction of other substituted nitroaromatic compounds (e.g., 2-nitroaniline, 4-nitrophenol, 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene, 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene, 4-nitrotoluene, and 4-nitroanisole) (see Fig. S12 and S13†) over the optimized CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A samples. It is clear that the CdS/5%GR-A sample shows a much higher visible light photocatalytic activity than that of CdS/5%GR under identical reaction conditions. In addition, all of the CdS/GR-A composites display a higher photocatalytic activity than CdS/GR with the same addition ratios of graphene, suggesting that using GO-A rather than GO as the precursor can improve the photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized CdS/graphene composites under visible light irradiation.
To our delight, the photocatalytic activity over the sample of CdS/GR-A is also much higher than that over CdS/(GR-M) with the addition of metal ions (M = Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) as interfacial mediators, as recently proposed by our group,8 toward the same photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol and reduction of 4-NA under identical reaction conditions, as shown in Fig. S14.† These encouraging results indicate that the physico-chemistry features of precursor GO sheets have a significant influence on the synthesis of GO-derived GR/semiconductor composites and, in turn, their photocatalytic activity. The optimization of either individual GR sheet components or interface composition represents a very promising strategy for designing more efficient GR/semiconductor composite photocatalysts.1
Since graphene (GR or GR-A) does not display visible light photocatalytic activity for the probe reactions, the role of graphene is believed to act as a co-catalyst to promote the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor CdS.3,8 Namely, due to the energy level match,3,8 the graphene platform can readily accept and shuttle the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band (CB) of semiconductor CdS resulting from the band-gap-photoexcitation under visible light irradiation (Scheme S1†). Because GR-A displays better electrical conductivity than GR prepared via the same solvothermal reduction method as discussed above, it can be deduced that for the CdS/graphene composites, GR-A may help to facilitate the separation/transfer of photogenerated charge carriers from the band-gap-photoexcitation of CdS under visible light irradiation more efficiently, which thus contributes to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of CdS/graphene nanocomposites. The subsequent comparative analysis of photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) spectra on blank CdS, CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A samples confirms this inference.
As shown in Fig. 4A, the transient photocurrent response for CdS/5%GR is higher than that for blank CdS, while CdS/5%GR-A displays the highest photocurrent transient response under visible light irradiation, suggesting that the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers achieved on CdS/5%GR-A is significantly enhanced.3,4 Additionally, it is worth noting that an obvious photocurrent decay is observed during the initial runs of the photocurrent transient response for CdS/5%GR-A, indicating the competitive process of charge carrier recombination and separation across the interfacial domain of the CdS/5%GR-A composite. However, after the equilibration of this competitive separation and recombination of charge carriers, the photocurrent will reach a relatively constant value, as shown in the last three runs in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4B shows the EIS Nyquist plots of the electrodes made of blank CdS, CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A under visible light irradiation. It is clearly seen that the three electrode materials all show semicycles at high frequencies. The smallest arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of CdS/5%GR-A implies that it has a faster interfacial electron transfer than those of blank CdS and CdS/5%GR.8,15 The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 4C were also employed to study the photoelectrochemical properties of the photocatalysts. The current density obtained over the CdS/5%GR-A electrode is higher than that over CdS/5%GR and blank CdS, which proves the further improved electron transfer rate across the contact interface between electrode and electrolyte solution over CdS/5%GR-A.8 Additionally, the most efficient inhibition of photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination over CdS/5%GR-A was further verified by the photoluminescence (PL) analysis (Fig. 4D), which is often employed to study surface processes involving the photoexcited energy/electron transfer and recombination.8,11 The PL spectra show that the integration of GR-A with the matrix of semiconductor CdS nanocrystals results in the strongest quenching degree of PL intensity, suggesting that the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over CdS/5%GR-A is the most inhibited among the three samples.

To further understand the effect of using GO-A instead of GO as the precursor of graphene on enhancing the overall photocatalytic performance of CdS/graphene composites, a surface area analysis over CdS/5%GR and CdS/5%GR-A was performed and the results are shown in Fig. S15.† The surface area of CdS/5%GR-A is ca. 87 m2 g−1, which is higher than the 58 m2 g−1 of CdS/5%GR. This demonstrates that the use of GO-A also increases the surface area of the resulting CdS/graphene composites, which could provide more surface-active sites for the adsorption of reactants (Fig. S16†)8 and boost the charge carrier transport.15 This, in turn, also makes a contribution to the photocatalytic activity enhancement of CdS/GR-A composites. Therefore, the use of GO-A instead of the original GO as the precursor of graphene simultaneously improved the electrical conductivity, separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers, and the surface area of the resulting CdS/graphene composites. These factors synergistically contribute to enhancing the photoactivity of the CdS/GR-A composites as compared to that of CdS/GR.
Conclusions
In summary, we for the first time report direct experimental evidence illustrating the important effect of graphene oxide (GO) chemistry, widely used as the precursor of graphene (GR), on the preparation of GO-derived GR/semiconductor composites and their photocatalytic activity. Two different types of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A composites were prepared by the use of two different GO precursors, GO and GO-A. The simple, ultrasonic treatment of GO sheets with acid leads to GO-A with smaller lateral size dimensions, increased density of oxygenated functional groups and colloidal stability. In particular, this treatment remarkably improves the electrical conductivity of graphene obtained from the solvothermal reduction of the GO-A sheets. Consequently, the GR-A sheets are more efficient as co-catalysts to accept/transfer photogenerated electrons from semiconductor CdS, which leads to the fact that the as-synthesized CdS/GR-A composites exhibit remarkably higher photocatalytic activity than CdS/GR toward selective photoredox processes under visible light illumination. Our findings highlight that the controllable tailoring of GO physico-chemistry features, including the size, shape, morphology, density of oxygenated functional groups or colloidal stability, plays a significant influence on the preparation, photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activities of GO-derived GR/semiconductor composites. In perspective, we believe that the integrative consideration of individual components (graphene or semiconductor) and interface optimization at a system level1,48,49 would further aid harmonizing the entire GR/semiconductor composite system with an unprecedented photocatalytic activity improvement for targeted photoredox applications.

All of the reagents were used as received without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was supplied by local sources.


Synthesis. 
(a) Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO). 
GO was synthesized from natural graphite powder by a modified Hummers’ method widely reported in previous works.1,3–9 In detail, 2 g of graphite powder (supplied from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China) was put into a mixture of 12 mL of concentrated H2SO4, 2.5 g of K2S2O8, and 2.5 g of P2O5. The solution was heated to 80 °C in an oil-bath and kept stirring for 24 h. The mixture was then carefully diluted with 500 mL of deionized (DI) water, filtered, and washed until the pH of the rinse water became neutral. The product was dried under ambient conditions overnight. This pre-oxidized graphite was then subjected to oxidation, described as follows. In a typical procedure, pre-oxidized graphite powder was added to a mixture of 120 mL of concentrated H2SO4 and 30 mL HNO3 under vigorous stirring, and the solution was chilled to 0 °C. Then, 15 g of KMnO4 was added gradually under stirring and the temperature of the mixture was kept below 20 °C by cooling. Successively, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 96 h, and then diluted with 1 L of DI water in an ice bath to keep the temperature below 50 °C for 2 h. Shortly after further dilution with 1 L of DI water, 20 mL of 30% H2O2 was then added to the mixture and a brilliant yellow product was formed along with bubbling. The mixture was filtered and washed with 1:10 HCl aqueous solution to remove metal ions followed by DI water to remove the acid. The filter cake was then dispersed in water by a mechanical agitation. Low-speed centrifugation was done at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant then underwent two more high-speed centrifugation steps at 8000 rpm for 15 min to remove small GO pieces and water-soluble byproduct. The final sediment was re-dispersed in water with mechanical agitation or mild sonication using a table-top ultrasonic cleaner, giving a solution of exfoliated GO.
(b) Acid treatment of GO. 
200 mg of the as-synthesized GO powder was ultrasonicated with an 80 mL mixture of HNO3 (20 mL) and H2SO4 (60 mL) for 3 days at a power level of 400 W, while maintaining the temperature below 40 °C. The dispersion was then diluted with 1 L deionized water, washed repeatedly in a cycle of centrifugation and then dialyzed for 4 days, and finally dried at 60 °C. The obtained graphene oxide was marked as GO-A to distinguish it from the original GO.
(c) Synthesis of CdS/graphene (GR and GR-A) nanocomposites. 
The synthesis of CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A nanocomposites is based on a one-step solvothermal method as presented in previous works.8,41 In a typical synthesis process, a certain amount of the as-prepared GO or GO-A was dispersed in 40 mL DMSO by ultrasonication to obtain a homogeneous graphene oxide dispersion. After that, 0.106 g Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O was added into the solution. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min and then transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to conduct solvothermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h. After that, the cooled products were separated by centrifugation and then washed three times with acetone and once with absolute ethanol. It was then fully dried at 60 °C in an oven. Final CdS/GR and CdS/GR-A nanocomposites with different weight ratios of graphene (1%, 5%, 10% and 30%) were obtained. Blank CdS was synthesized via the same solvothermal treatment without the addition of GO or GO-A. In addition, the reduction of graphene oxide (GO and GO-A) to graphene (GR and GR-A) was prepared using the same solvothermal procedure in the absence of cadmium acetate.

Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were collected on a powder X-ray diffractometer (Philip X’ Pert Pro MPP) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range from 10° to 80° with a scan rate of 0.02°/0.1 s. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-vis-NIR) was used to measure the optical properties of the samples with BaSO4 as the internal reflectance standard. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Nanoscope IIIA system. The sample for AFM imaging was prepared by depositing suspensions of graphene oxide (GO and GO-A) in ethanol on a freshly cleaved mica surface. The morphology and microscopic structure information were determined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Nova NANOSEM 230) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab 250 spectrometer which consists of a mono chromatic Al Kα as the X-ray source, a hemispherical analyzer, and a sample stage with multiaxial adjustability, to obtain the surface composition of the samples. All of the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.
Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Renishaw inVia Raman System 1000 with a 532 nm Nd:YAG excitation source at room temperature. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument PLS920 system. Zeta-potentials (ζ) measurements in deionized water were determined by dynamic light scattering analysis (Zetasizer 3000HSA) at room temperature. Micromeritics ASAP2010 equipment was used to determine the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas. The sample was degassed at 120 °C for 5 h and then analyzed at 77 K.
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a homemade three electrode quartz cell with a PAR VMP3 Multi Potentiostat apparatus. A Pt plate was used as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass that was cleaned by sonication in ethanol for 30 min and dried at 80 °C. Typically, 3 mg of the sample powder was ultrasonicated in 0.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) to disperse it evenly to get a slurry. The slurry was spread onto FTO glass, whose side part had been protected using Scotch tape. After air drying, the working electrode was further dried at 120 °C for 2 h to improve adhesion. Then, the Scotch tape was removed, and the uncoated part of the electrode was isolated with epoxy resin. The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm2. The photocurrent measurements were carried out on a BAS Epsilon workstation without bias and the electrolyte was 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6.8). The visible light irradiation source was a 300 W Xe arc lamp system equipped with a UV-CUT filter (λ > 420 nm). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and cyclic voltammograms were carried out using a CHI-660D workstation, (CH Instrument, USA) in a three electrode cell in the presence of 0.5 M KCl solution containing 0.01 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] (1:1) under open circuit potential conditions.
The electrical conductivity measurement of graphene (GR and GR-A) was performed by measuring the resistivity–pressure curve (R–P curve) using a four-point probe technique on a ST2722 (Suzhou Jingge Electronic Co., P. R. China) power resistivity tester.
Photocatalytic activity
In the following photocatalytic reaction, a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300C, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd) equipped with a UV-CUT filter to cut off light of wavelength below 420 nm was used as the visible light source (λ > 420 nm) to trigger the photocatalytic redox reactions, as also reported in our previous research works.4,8

Photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols. 
The photocatalytic selective oxidation of various benzylic alcohols was performed in a 10 mL Pyrex glass bottle under visible light irradiation.4,8 In a typical experiment, a mixture of catalyst (8 mg) and organic compounds (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in the solvent of benzotrifluoride (BTF, 1.5 mL), which was saturated with pure molecular oxygen from a gas cylinder. The above mixture was transferred into a 10 mL Pyrex glass bottle and stirred for 10 min to make the catalyst blend evenly in the solution. The suspensions were irradiated under visible light (λ > 420 nm). After the reaction, the mixture was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min to completely remove the catalyst particles. The remaining solution was analyzed with an Agilent gas chromatograph (GC-7820 fitted with a FFAP capillary analysis column). The assignment of products was confirmed by a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (HP-5973GC/MS). Conversion and selectivity for the selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to target products were defined as follows:Conversion(%) = [(C0 − Calcohol)/C0]× 100Selectivity(%) = [Caldehyde/(C0 − Calcohol)]× 100where C0 is the initial concentration of alcohols and Calcohol and Caldehyde are the concentration of reactant and product, respectively, at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction.


Photocatalytic selective reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. 
As for the photocatalytic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds in water with the addition of a hole scavenger in an N2 atmosphere,8 10 mg of the samples and 20 mg of ammonium oxalate (AO) were added into 30 mL of a 20 mg L−1 aqueous solution of nitroaromatic compounds in a quartz vial. Before visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm), the above suspension was stirred in the dark for 2 h to establish an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the samples and reactant. During the reaction process, 3 mL of sample solution was collected at a certain time interval and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min to remove the catalyst completely. After that, the solution was analyzed on a Varian ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Cary-50, Varian Co.). The identification of reactants and products was also confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Shimadzu HPLC-LC20AT equipped with a C18 column and SPD-M20A photodiode array detector). The whole experimental process was conducted under N2 bubbling at a flow rate of 80 mL min−1. Conversion and selectivity for the selective reduction of nitroaromatic compounds to target products were defined as follows:Conversion(%) = [(C0 − Cr)/C0]× 100Selectivity(%) = [Cp/(C0 − Cr)]× 100where C0 is the initial concentration of nitroaromatic compounds, and Cr and Cp are the concentrations of reactant and product, respectively, at a certain time after the photocatalytic reaction.
