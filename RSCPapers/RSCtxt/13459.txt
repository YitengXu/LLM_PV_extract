    , Accepted 9th August 2020First published on 10th August 2020AbstractVariation in the composition of the A, B′, and B′′-sites to develop novel AB′B′′X6 halide double perovskites is an important topic in areas as diverse as materials- and nano-science, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, device technologies and bandgap engineering. In this study, we examined the geometrical, dynamical, electronic, and optical properties of the rhodium-based halide series A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) with double perovskite stoichiometry using density functional theory with the meta-GGA functional SCAN-rVV10. Geometry-based stability analysis suggested the formation of the first two members of the series as perovskites and the remaining three as distorted perovskites, but all are direct bandgap materials displaying electronic transitions at the high-symmetry X-point. Phonon dispersion calculations suggested that Cs2AgRhBr6 is dynamically stable, whereas all other systems of the series are dynamically unstable, as is often the case for single halide perovskites at the high symmetry points of the first Brilliouin zone. The real and positive nature of the three independent elastic constants, used to examine the Born criterion, and the six eigenvalues of the elastic stiffness matrix, indicated that all the A2AgRhBr6 compounds are mechanically stable. While the SCAN-rVV10 bandgaps of these systems were underestimated compared to those evaluated using the HSE06, PBE0, G0W0 and GW0 methods, the density functional perturbation theory based dielectric function spectra, as well as the refractive index and absorption coefficient spectra, feature broad peaks covering the infrared and visible regions with the onset of optical (direct) absorption occurring near SCAN-rVV10 bandgap energies between 0.74 and 0.77 eV. A high frequency dielectric constant of 7.38 to 8.11, a refractive index of 2.70 to 2.85, and an absorption coefficient in the range of 5.7 × 105–6.3 × 105 were calculated for A2AgRhBr6 in the region 0.0–5.0 eV, suggesting possible application of these systems in optoelectronics.
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, halide double perovskites have been rediscovered as photovoltaic,1 photocatalytic,2 X-ray detector,3,4 and photo-luminescent semiconducting materials.5–7 They are represented by the chemical formula A2B′B′′X6 (X = Cl, Br, I). The cation at the A-site is a spacer or guest, responsible for the electrical neutrality of the perovskite structure, and is either organic (such as MA = methylammonium) or inorganic (alkali ions). The B′- and B′′-cations are usually main group or transition metal cations involved in building the 2D or 3D inorganic framework of the crystal lattice. The former is usually found in the +1 oxidation state (e.g., Cu+, Na+, Cs+ and Ag+) and the latter in the +3 oxidation state (In3+, Cr3+, and Bi3+).1–9 Examples of halide double perovskites whose 3D structures have been reported include A2AgInX6 (A = Cs, Rb, Na; X = Cl, Br, I),10,11 A2AgBiX6 (A = Cs, Rb, Na; X = Cl, Br, I),11–14 and A2NaInX6 (A = Cs, Rb; X = Cl, Br).15–20
Although only a handful of halogenated double perovskites have been characterized as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and luminescent materials,1–20 many of them are inefficient converters of light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum for viable application in solar cells,21 and the quality of the synthesized samples are not as good as that of single Pb-based perovskites.9 For example, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 was reported to be <3%,1 which is very small compared to that certified for the best light absorber halide perovskite, MAPbI3 (PCE ∼ 25.2%).22,23 The high PCE of MAPbI3 was achieved only in 2019,23 and was a significant improvement over the value of 3.8% reported ten years ago.24 Clearly, continuous experimental developments and refinements played a role in achieving such a milestone.25
One of the principal reasons why lead-based perovskites cannot be widely used as a sustainable source of converting light into electric energy is that they are not environmentally friendly, toxic and because they deteriorate, especially when exposed to heat, visible and UV light, applied electric fields, water vapor pressure, mechanical pressure, and even ambient air.26–28 This may not always apply to main group and transition metal based A2B′B′′X6 halide double perovskites given that many of them have been shown to be non-toxic, and to be environmentally and thermodynamically stable.29,30 They are therefore deserving of exploration, both theoretical and experimental, in anticipation of discovering efficient materials for application in optoelectronics.31,32
Interest in all-inorganic halide single and double perovskites as luminescent and spintronic materials has grown significantly because of their inherently high absorption coefficients, leading to broader applications.1–10,33,34 As such, this density functional theory study investigates the lattice properties, electronic, elastic, phonon and optical properties of the A2B′B′′Br6 series with double perovskite composition, where A = Cs+, Rb+, K+, Na+, and Li+; B′ = Ag+; and B′′ = Rh3+. The first aim of this study was to geometrically isolate stable perovskites from non-perovskites in the series using traditional35–37 and newly38 proposed tolerance factors. Next, we examined phonon dispersion and density of states and elastic properties to determine whether the A2B′B′′Br6 compounds identified as perovskites and non-perovskites are dynamically and mechanically stable.39 We also examined the dielectric and optical constants40 to determine the extent to which the A-site cation substitution by lighter alkali ions affects these properties. We investigated the effect of the A-site cations responsible in setting orbital states associated with the upper and lower valence and conduction bands, and demonstrate the importance of their involvement in determining the band structure and optical absorption edges of A2AgRhBr6. Finally, we examined the nature of the mobility of charge carriers associated with the valence and conduction band edges41,42 and provide our views on whether the systems investigated could find application in optoelectronics.41–44
2. Computational methods
The meta-GGA SCAN (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed45,46) functional in combination with the rVV10 van der Waals functional was used for the energy-minimization of the unit-cell lattice constants, volume and ionic positions of each A2AgRhBr6. The combination of SCAN with rVV10 has been shown to model well the properties of metallic, insulating and semiconducting systems, as it accounts for the non-local correlation part necessary for the description of long- and short-range dispersion effects.45,46 SCAN has been used to study the electronic structure and properties of several systems,45–50 including halide perovskites,51 and halide double perovskites,5 and in particular is suitable for the study of the atomic structure of hybrid perovskite materials.5,51
Together with SCAN-rVV10, the Γ-centered k-point mesh 8 × 8 × 8 for sampling the first Brillouin zone, the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method52 and a plane-wave basis set at an energy cut-off of 520 eV were used. The tolerance in the total energy for relaxation of the electronic degrees of freedom was set to 10−8 eV per cell, and the residual Hellmann–Feynman forces per ion was less than 0.006eV Å−1. Unless otherwise stated, spin polarization was considered given that an Rh3+ ion in an octahedral environment in the perovskite lattice is assumed to have a low spin 4d6 (t62ge0g) electron configuration.53 All calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).54,55
The linear tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections56 was used for the calculation of the density of states (DOS) of A2AgRhBr6. The electronic band dispersion was calculated using a standard self-consistent (SC) procedure, followed by a non-SC calculation.57 The same dense k-point mesh as above was used for sampling the Brillouin zone, and the band levels were those recommended for the Fmm space group.58 Post processing Linux-based software Pyband57 and Sumo58 were used for analysis and plotting the DOS and band structures.
VASP5.4 lacks implementation of the meta-GGA (SCAN-rVV10) functional to model the linear response properties.59 To this end, the Density Functional Theory Perturbation Theory (DFPT) method,60 in conjunction with the (PBE) PAW potentials, often used for this type of calculation,43,61–64 was adopted. The energy and force cut-offs and the size of the k-point mesh were maintained (see above). The relaxed SCAN-rVV10 geometries of A2AgRhBr6 served as inputs. The number of empty conduction band states found in the single point SCF calculations to generate the wavefuntions, were doubled. The number of frequency grid points was set to 2000, as recommended.65 Similar calculations were performed with the PBEsol functional, in conjunction with DFPT, to see what effect this combination has on the nature of the dielectric function.
The dynamical stability of the A2AgRhBr6 lattice was examined using the computed phonon band structures and phonon density of states spectra.39,66–70 These calculations were performed using the Phonopy code.67 The DFPT method was used to calculate force constants in reciprocal space, all within the harmonic approximation, adopting a linear response calculation to obtain the force constant matrix. We used a Γ-center scheme for k-point sampling integrations.43 An energy-cutoff of 520 eV for plane wave basis set and a total energy cut-off of 10−8 eV were chosen. In addition, we have adopted the finite difference method (FDM),70,71 together with SCAN-rVV10, to compute the same properties, and to verify whether the DFPT results are always reliable. In the latter case, the dynamical matrix was calculated by forcing a finite displacement on each atom and evaluating the forces.
The mechanical stability,39 elastic anisotropy,72 and soft character73 of A2AgRhBr6 were examined using the results of the elastic constants and the six eigenvalues of the 6 × 6 stiffness elastic matrix Cij of A2AgRhBr6, as well as of the various elastic moduli derived using them. These were calculated within the harmonic approximation. The finite difference approach was used to determine the second derivatives (Hessian matrix and phonon frequencies). A 2 × 2 × 2 k-point mesh was used, together with the tight convergence criteria mentioned above. The SCAN-VV10 relaxed geometries of A2AgRhBr6 were used.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Lattice geometry and cell density of A2AgRhBr6
The combined polyhedral and ball-and-stick DFT relaxed model of Cs2AgRhBr6 conventional unit-cell is shown in Fig. 1, and the relaxed geometric detail is given Tables S1 and S2 of the ESI.† The other four members of the series produced somewhat identical structures (not shown). Because of the cubic symmetry of the relaxed lattice (space group Fmm), all three lattice constants (a, b and c) are equivalent and are summarized in Table 1. The lattice constant a is largest for the system with the largest A-site cation (a = 10.61 Å) and systematically decreases across the series, as does the cell volume V and the density ρ (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†). Since the ρ values are predicted to lie between 5.32 and 4.20 g cm−3, this suggests that the studied systems are high-density materials. By comparison, ρ values of 4.22(02) and 4.927(9) g cm−3 have been reported for Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6, respectively.74

Nearly similar structures were obtained for all other members of the series, A2AgRhBr6 (A= Rb, K, Na, Li). Each metal ion is involved in a hexa-coordinate bonding interaction with the surrounding bromide ions. The central alkali metal ion is involved in a dodecahedral coordination with the bromide ions.

3.2 Perovskite stability
The geometrical stability of ABX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskites75–77 and ABO3 perovskites37,38 has been extensively investigated using a combination of the octahedral factor μ, and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t. These factors are determined using the ionic radii r of A, B and X, and empirical relationships for μ and t are sought, where μ = rB/rX and , respectively. This approach has also been applied to halide double perovskites78 and vacancy-ordered double perovskites.79 For instance, the crystal structures of 170 known A2BX6 (X = I, Br, Cl, F) double halide perovskites were recently analyzed to determine the applicability of μ and t.79 It was found that t is indeed applicable for double perovskites in a manner analogous to its applicability to ABX3 perovskites.44 It is therefore an important tool in designing new hybrid organic–inorganic double perovskites.
The relation governing t is applicable to A2B′B′′X6 halide double perovskites, but with rB ≡ (rB′ + rB′′)/2. The ionic radii of A, B and X may be evaluated theoretically using first-principles methods; however, following convention,75–79 we used Shannon's radii for ions that have been empirically derived from experimentally reported crystal structures.80 Specifically, we used the ionic radii of octahedral Ag+, Rh3+ and Br− ions, and dodecahedral A+ ions (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na) (Table 2). Since the ionic radius of dodecahedral Li+ is unknown, we used its octahedral radius. Our calculated results for t, summarized in Table 2, suggest that the A2AgRhBr6 compounds are stable perovskites since μ and t are all within the recommended ranges, μ > 0.414 and 0.825 < t < 1.059.38 Although Li2AgRhBr6 has a μ = 0.46, within the recommended range, its t-value of 0.71 suggests that it may form a distorted a perovskite structure.

Other than the combination of μ and t, the global instability index GII () is another metric that has been recommended to shed some light on the stability of oxide perovskites. In this expression, N is the number of ions in the cell, and d is the bond discrepancy index.81,82 GII = 0.0 valence units (v.u.) for geometrically stable perovskite structures without steric distortions, and GII > 0.2 v.u. for empirically unstable non-stoichiometric phases.82–88 The parameter d is defined as the deviation of the bond valence sum (BVS) from the formal valence, and is given by , where sij = exp((l0 − lij/b) is the bond valences around any specific ion, lij is a bond length, l0 is the bond valence parameter empirically determined using experimental room-temperature structure data, and b is the bond softness parameter. Our calculated values of GII for A2AgRhBr6 are summarized in Table 2. These are in the range 0.02 v.u. < GII < 0.08 v.u. and show that the heavier members of A2AgRhBr6 are sterically marginally more distorted than the lighter ones. Since GII values are not >0.2 v.u., the results suggest that all the five systems may form crystallographically stable perovskite structures, a result which is not in complete agreement with what we deduced from the combination of μ and t. The discrepancy may be due to the inaccurate bond valence parameters used for Li+ that were empirically determined using experimental room-temperature structural data.
As the structural predictions obtained separately using GII, or the combination of μ and t, on the stability of A2AgRhBr6 were not strictly in agreement (especially for Li2AgRhBr6), we employed the new tolerance factor τ recently proposed by Bartel et al.38 to reexamine the predicted stability. By definition, τ = (rX/rB) − nA(nA − (rA/rB)/ln(rA/rB)), where nA is the oxidation state of A, ri is the ionic radius of ion i, and rA > rB. According to the authors, t is not very suitable for exploring the formability of a perovskite structure given that it incorrectly recognizes non-perovskites as perovskites in the region of t where perovskites are expected (0.825 < t < 1.059); the rate of this recognition can be as high as 51%. From a set of 576 ABX3 compositions tested, t correctly labelled 94% of the perovskites and 49% of the non-perovskites. However, τ was shown to generalize outside the training set for 1034 experimentally realized single and double perovskites (91% accuracy) and was successful in identifying 23314 new double perovskites (A2B′B′′X6) ranked by their probability of being stable as perovskites based on the ranges of τ (τ < 4.18) that defines the decision boundary for classification of a material as a perovskite or a non-perovskite.
Our results of τ are summarized in Table 2 and suggest the formability of the first two member of the series (Cs2AgRhBr6 (τ = 4.00) and Rb2AgRhBr6 (τ = 4.12)) as perovskites. Because the ionic radii of K+, Na+ and Li+ are appreciably smaller than those of Cs+ and Rb+ (Table 2), the τ values for K2AgRhBr6 (τ = 4.21) and NA2AgRhBr6 (τ = 4.75) were found to lie beyond the recommended boundary of τ < 4.18 and that for Li2AgRhBr6 was abnormally large (τ = 75.27). Overall, the three prediction criteria used suggest that Cs2AgRhBr6 and Rb2AgRhBr6 should form stable perovskites, while it is likely that the other three may have distorted perovskite structures. We add that CsPbI3 (Pmm) and CsSnI3 (Pmm) were reported to have τ values of 4.30 and 4.24, respectively,38 which have been experimentally identified as having cubic perovskite stoichiometry.89
3.3 Phonon band structure and density of states
Phonon band structure and phonon density of states are important features of any solid state material since they are associated with the nature of phonon vibrational modes, providing insight into a material's lattice and phonon stability, ionic transport, and the recombination and scattering of charge carriers.90–94 Soft phonon modes are generally associated with imaginary frequencies.95 These modes often appear in the low frequency regime of the vibrational phonon spectra, caused by lattice or phonon instability.96
To provide further insight into the stability of the A2AgRhBr6 lattice, the phonon dispersion was evaluated using the dynamic matrix that was constructed by means of the Hessian matrix as the second derivatives of the total energy with respect to the atomic displacements.90,95 The Hessian matrix was calculated in reciprocal space using the DFPT method with Phonopy,67 as well as by using the FDM71 together with the SCAN-rVV10 functional. DFPT cannot be coupled to SCAN-rVV10 for such a calculation since the combination of meta-GGA with linear response routines is not supported by VASP. Although large supercells are often recommended for such calculations,97 we selected the primitive cell (10 atoms) and its 2 × 2 × 2 extension (80 atoms), as well as the 2 × 2 × 2 extension of the conventional unit-cell (320 atoms). The k-meshes of 4 × 4 × 4, 2 × 2 × 2 and 1 × 1 × 1 were used for the corresponding cells, respectively.

Fig. 2a–c compares the phonon band structure, together with the phonon (total) density of states, of Cs2AgRhBr6 obtained with DFPT and FDM. It is clear that the three acoustic modes (two transverse and one longitudinal) are stable at the center of the zone boundary (Γ-point) and are somewhat stiffened across the zone boundary, regardless of the nature of the size of the cell and computational method used. One of the optical modes is relatively shallow at the center of the zone boundary, which is prominent in the DFPT phonon dispersion shown in Fig. 2c.
 Fig. 2  Harmonic level phonon dispersion, together with phonon density of states (total) of Cs2AgRhBr6: (a) primitive-cell (FDM); (b) 2 × 2 × 2 extension of the primitive-cell (FDM); and (c) 2 × 2 × 2 extension of the primitive-cell (DFPT). The band levels are those of the Fmm space group, obtained from the Bilbao Crystallographic server.58 
The result above is not fully in accord with that obtained when the conventional cell and its 2 × 2 × 2 supercells were used (see Fig. S2 of the ESI†), suggesting that the unstable phonon at the Γ-point is an artefact of the computational procedure, as well as of the nature of the cell used. In fact, DFPT suggested a few optical modes, which are long wave phonons, associated with negative imaginary frequencies, thus explaining why several curves appear below the 0.0 THz frequency line (Fig. S2b and c, ESI†).
As the number of atoms N in the cell increases, the phonon spectra became denser since there is an increase in the number of the phonon modes following the 3N rule (Fig. 2vs. Fig. S2, ESI†). (The imaginary modes occurred at frequencies of –7.6 and – 15.0 cm−1 when the conventional cell was used and at frequencies of −7.3, −10.7 and −14.9 cm−1 when 2 × 2 × 2 extension of the conventional cell was used.) The presence of these modes shows up only at the center of the Brilliouin zone. We have also symmetrized the force constants to see whether the imaginary modes in the GGA dispersion are an artifact, but this did not provide any new physical insight. Such negative (soft) modes have been seen in ferroelectric crystals,91 suggesting that Cs2AgRhBr6 will experience Γ-point instability. Similar results were found for the other A2AgRhBr6 (A = Rb, K, Na, Li) structures, regardless of the nature of computational approaches adopted (DFPT or FDM); this means that all these latter members of the series are likely to be dynamically unstable. Fig. S3 of the ESI† provides a similar phonon instability feature, suggesting the phonons are unstable across the paths L → Γ→ X and L → Γ → X → W for Rb2AgRhBr6 and K2AgRhBr6, respectively.
Since the effect of anharmonic contributions, together with external temperature and pressure, on the soft modes were not considered in this study, it is difficult to speculate what role these have on the stability of the observed phonon modes. The presence of soft modes at the R- and Γ-point is known for many halide perovskites, including, for example, CsPbI3,67,69 CsPbCl3,98 MAPbI3,99 MAPbBr3,100 and FAPbI3 (FA+ = formamidinium).101
For CsPbI3, the imaginary mode was associated with one of the triply degenerate acoustic modes at the Γ-point, with a phonon frequency as large as −15 cm−1. Further instabilities occurred at the high symmetry R- and M-points (around 20 cm−1), and were due to the optical modes that indicate the presence of strong anharmonic effects and a very flat energy profile around equilibrium.69 Brivio and coworkers,70 and others,102 have shown that such instabilities are a common feature of the perovskite structure and represent antiferroelectric distortions linked to rotations and tilting of the octahedra in neighboring unit cells. Nevertheless, plots of the thermal properties (Helmholtz free energy F, entropy S, and heat capacity at constant volume CV) as a function of temperature for Cs2AgRhBr6 (Fig. S4, ESI†) show that F decreases monotonically as temperature increases, unlike S and CV, as anticipated from classical thermodynamics.103–106
3.4 Density of states and band structures
The orbital-projected DOS of each atom type for Cs2AgRhBr6, with the Fermi level EF referenced at 0.0 eV, is shown in Fig. 3. The A-site cation contribution to the valence band maximum (VBM) is very marginal, and plays almost no role in the dispersion of the conduction band minimum (CBM). Virtually the same can be said of the 5s orbital of Ag, which makes a negligible contribution to either the VBM or to the CBM. The VBM is formed mainly from the Br (4p) and Rh (4d) orbital states, with partial contributions from the Ag 4d states, and they are collectively responsible for the dispersion of the band. The normalized orbital contribution of each atom type, listed in Table 3, suggests that Rh(4d) and Br(4p) contribute about 71.6% and 25.5% to the VBM of Cs2AgRhBr6, respectively, while contributing about 53.4% and 22.3% to CBM, respectively.

Although the A-site species does not play a direct role in determining the VBM and CBM, as observed for MAPbI3,107 the replacement of Cs+ in Cs2AgRhBr6 by the lighter members of the alkali series shrinks the A2AgRhBr6 lattice. This does have an impact on the nature of the orbital character of the VBM and CBM. In particular, the presence of the smaller sized A-site cations in A2AgRhBr6 causes an increase in the 4d-type (Rh) contribution to the VBM from 71.6% in Cs2AgRhBr6 to 71.0% in Li2AgRhBr6. The 4p-type (Br) contribution is virtually unaffected (see Table 3). A similar decreasing feature is noticeable with the Rh(4d), as well as with the Ag(5s), states responsible for the CBM, but the nature of the Br(4p)-orbital states contributing to the band is virtually affected. An exception is notable for Na2AgRhBr6 and Li2AgRhBr6, and is due to plane-wave potential.
The results above suggest that both the CBM and VBM of A2AgRhBr6 are an admixture of p- and d-type orbital energy states, but the dominance of d–d type electronic transitions between the VBM and CBM is expected to play a role. This is in contrast to what has been reported for MAPbX3 halide perovskites, in which CBM and VBM located at the R-point were found to be substantially of Pb(p) and Pb(s) + X(p) character, respectively.108 For the GaAs solar cell absorber, these had Ga(s) + As(s) and As(p) character, respectively; and for Si, the orbital origins of the corresponding bands were Si(s + p) and Si(p), respectively.108
The DOS and band structures of Cs2AgRhBr6 and Li2AgRhBr6 are compared in Fig. 4. The comparison shows that replacing Cs+ with Li+ in Cs2AgRhBr6 does not significantly affect the location of the HOMO and LUMO bands of Li2AgRhBr6. The former lies just below the Fermi level, and the latter is appreciably off. This is indicative of their corresponding band structures shown in Fig. 4b and d, respectively, in which the electronic transition between the VBM and CBM dominate at the X-point of the first Brillouin zone. The fundamental (non-SCF) bandgaps (Eg) of A2AgRhBr6 lie between 0.2 and 0.3 eV for all the halide double perovskites and non-perovskites (distorted) investigated (see Table 1 for Eg values).

The corresponding plots of Rb2AgRhBr6 are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. The band labels used in (b) and (d) are those of the space group Fmm. Primitive unit-cells were used. 
3.5 Nature of charge carrier mobility
It is evident from Fig. 4b and d that the top of the valence band is broader and flatter than the bottom of the conduction band. It is therefore expected that the mobility of electrons associated with the conduction band edge should be faster than those of the holes at the valence band edge. To prove this hypothesis, we have calculated the effective masses of the electrons and holes by parabolic fitting of the band edges. The basic relationship between the effective mass (m*) of charge carriers, and the curvature of the band edges (∂2E(k)/∂k2) was used.42,109 This is given by mh* = −ℏ2(∂2E(k)/∂k2)−1 and me* = −ℏ2(∂2E(k)/∂k2)−1, where E(k) is the energy of the conduction/valence band edge associated with electrons/holes, k is the wave vector, ℏ is Plank's constant and mh*/me* is the effective mass of electrons/holes.
The effective masses of the charge carriers are summarized in Table 4; they are evaluated along two principal directions at the X point. The VBM is two-fold degenerate. One of them has a massive hole than the other, especially that along the X → W path (because of the significantly fatter nature of the band along this path). The data in Table 4 refer to the band with lighter mh* along both the paths, comprising of spin-up holes. Each is associated with two principal directions. The mh* is lighter along the X → Γ direction compared to that along the X → W direction. For example, in Cs2AgRhBr6, one of these bands has mh* close to 2.11 m0 and 1.44 m0 along the X → Γ and X → W directions, respectively, where m0 is the electron rest mass. For the other, mh* = 2.09 m0 and 17.33 m0 along the same directions, respectively. This feature persists regardless of the nature of the A-site cation in A2AgRhBr6, but the difference in the mh* values along the two directions reduces as one passes from Cs2AgRhBr6 down the series, except for Li2AgRhBr6.

Since the CBM is largely parabolic, the effective mass me* of the electrons in the band is significantly lighter than the VBM holes along the same direction. For example, me* is about 4.8 and 5.7 times smaller than mh* along the X → Γ and X → W directions, respectively, and the trend persists even with the average effective masses of electrons and holes (see Table 4). This is the basis of the hypothesis given above that a larger curvature of the band structure implies a lower effective mass, while flat (and narrow) bands tend to result in a large effective mass.110 Since the value of me* is is not indifferent along the X → Γ and X → W directions for each A2AgRhBr6, the transport of electrons along both directions would be different. As the mobility of electrons is faster than that of holes, these systems may be regarded as electron-transporting materials. Moreover, as the ratio mh*/me* is a measure of electron–hole pair stability in a recombination process and me* < mh*, the lifetime is determined by electron–hole collisions.111 Previous studies have shown that a ratio of electron to hole effective mass close to unity is an indication that Auger recombination is weak, since the ratio implies a longer Auger lifetime,111,112 as observed for the semiconductor (PbSn)Te.111,112
3.6 Optical characteristics (dielectric function, absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, and refractive index)
A property that is often investigated to infer whether a solid may be useful in device technology is related to the absorption or emission of light. Theoretically, this is generally approximated using the frequency-dependent dielectric function ε(ω) that reflects the electronic transition features of the band structure. It is a complex function given by: ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω) = ε(1)αβ(ω) + iε(2)αβ(ω)), where ε1(ω) (ε1(ω) = ε(1)αβ(ω)) and ε2(ω) (ε2(ω) = ε(2)αβ(ω)) are the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The plot of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) for which the average values of their principal components were used is illustrated in Fig. 5. The Kramers–Kronig transformation102,113 that connects ε(1)αβ(ω) with ε(2)αβ(ω) using eqn (1) was invoked, where P is the Cauchy principal value of the integral, η is a small complex shift, and the singularity at ω = ω′ is avoided. (1)
 Fig. 5  (a) Behavior of the DFPT-based real and imaginary parts of dielectric function for A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) against the photon energy, obtained using geometry of the conventional-cell. (b) Comparison of behavior of the dielectric function against the photon energy for Cs2AgRhBr6, obtained using DFPT and DFPT/PBEsol (primitive cell used). 
For the calculation of the frequency dependent dielectric matrix associated with ε(2)αβ(ω), the Kubo-Greenwood114 relationship was used (eqn (2)), where the subscripts c and ν refer to conduction and valence band states, respectively, and uck is the cell periodic part of the orbitals at the k-point k. (2)

Fig. 5a compares the plot of the DFPT-based dielectric function calculated using the fully relaxed geometry of the conventional cells of A2AgRhBr6, while Fig. 5b compares the DFPT calculated dielectric function of Cs2AgRhBr6 with that of DFPT-PBEsol. In the latter, the system's primitive cell was used. As can be seen in Fig. 5b, there is a slight variation between the curves of the real (or imaginary) part of the dielectric function obtained using two different approaches. In what follows, we discuss the results obtained using DFPT.
The zero-frequency limit (ε(0)) corresponding to the real part of ε(ω) was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the zero frequency dielectric constants along the three polarization directions given by ε(0) = 1/3(εxx(0) + εyy(0) + εzz(0)), where εxx(0) = εyy(0) = εzz(0) due to the cubic nature of A2AgRhBr6. It is sometimes referred to as the optical/high-frequency dielectric constant (ε∞).62–64 Actually, the static dielectric constant εs is such that εs = ε∞ + ε(f), and ε(f) is determined by optical phonon frequency, crystal mass and so on.115 While the calculation of ε(f) is completely ignored in this study, it is known that DFPT without the electron–hole coupling effects can reasonably describe ε∞.116 In any case, the value of ε∞ is calculated to be 7.38, 7.85, 7.91, 8.07 and 8.11 for Cs2AgRhBr6, Rb2AgRhBr6, K2AgRhBr6, NA2AgRhBr6, and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively. This shows that the electronic contribution to the relative dielectric constant is significant, suggesting that these systems may be defect tolerant.117,118 The values of ε∞ are similar to those reported for single and double halide perovskites. For instance, ε∞ for MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, MAPbCl3, and CsPbI3 are 6.5, 5.2, 4.2 and 5.3, respectively.62–64 Similarly, the high frequency dielectric constants of Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 were reported to be 4.8 and 5.8, respectively.119 Since the evaluation of the ion clamped dielectric constant was not considered in this study, we found it difficult to speculate whether excitons of A2AgRhBr6 are of the Mott–Wannier type or the Frenkel type.116,120
We found that ε1(ω) increases as ω increases for each A2AgRhBr6. The maxima are 12.32, 13.23, 13.64, 13.83, and 13.97 eV for Cs2AgRhBr6, Rb2AgRhBr6, K2AgRhBr6, NA2AgRhBr6, and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively, which are positioned at energies of 1.52, 1.57, 1.59, 1.60 and 1.61 eV, respectively. ε1(ω) drops sharply in the immediate neighborhood of the oscillator peak, and the minimum occurs at positions between 2.21 and 2.23 eV for all A2AgRhBr6, and then increases. However, none of the ε1(ω) curves touches the ε1 = 0 line, except for K2AgRhBr6. This may be a consequence of the plane wave potential, but does not signify the presence of metallic components in A2AgRhBr6. On the other hand, the transition peaks of the imaginary part of ε(ω) show up at energies of 1.80, 1.81, 1.82, 1.83 and 1.84 eV, respectively. These do not represent the onset of optical absorptions. They appear in the energy range between 0.74 and 0.78 eV. It is worth nothing that these values are not close to the electronic bandgaps of A2AgRhBr6 (see Table 1 for Eg values), which were obtained using non-SCF calculations upon reading the charge density and wavefunctions obtained from the SCF calculations. However, they are close to the bandgaps predicted directly from the SCF calculations. The calculations gave Eg of 0.740, 0.757, 0.764, 0.758, and 0.774 eV for Cs2AgRhBr6, Rb2AgRhBr6, K2AgRhBr6, NA2AgRhBr6, and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively. In any case, the normal dispersion region in Fig. 5 corresponds to the energy range below ω0 (around 1.8 eV), where ε1 falls as the energy decreases (that is, between 0 and 1.8 eV). The anomalous dispersion region corresponds to the immediate neighborhood of a resonance frequency ω0, where ε1(ω) drops sharply and the region of anomalous dispersion coincides with the region of maximum absorption.
The ε2 spectra of A2AgRhBr6 (Fig. 5) show a broad absorption band with multiple peaks above 1.8 eV. These are likely to include, but are not limited to, d–d transitions of low spin Oh Rh3+. The Tanabe-Sugano energy diagram121 for a low spin d6 metal complex indicates that the ground term is 1A1g and that spin allowed transitions to, in order of increasing energy, 1T1g and 1T2g can be expected. Spin-forbidden transitions 1A1g → 3T1g and 1A1g → 3T2g are expected at lower energies. 10Dq for Rh3+ (g = 27.0) surrounded by six Br− ligands (f = 0.76) is expected to be 27.0 × 0.76 = 20.5 × 103 cm−1.122 Assuming a Racah parameter B = 720 cm−1 for Rh3+,123 the 1A1g → 1T1g and 1A1g → 1T2g transitions are expected at approximately 2.8 and 3.7 eV, respectively, while the 1A1g → 3T1g and 1A1g → 3T2g are expected at 1.9 and 2.4 eV, respectively. This is consistent with the direct nature of the bandgap transition between the VBM and CBM having significant d–d type Rh(4d) character. By comparison, Rh3+-doped AgBr, displayed a single luminescence band in the infrared with a peak emission wavelength at 0.77 eV, and bandgap and sub-bandgap excitations at 441.6 and 632.8 nm (2.808 and 1.959 eV), respectively.124 For Rh3+ doped α-Al2O3, a phosphorescence band was observed at 642 nm (1.93 eV), but the excitation spectrum consisted of two well-resolved bands at 394 nm (3.147 eV) and 320 nm (3.875 eV) corresponding to the 1A1g → 1T1g and 1A1g → 1T1g transitions, and a charge transfer band (edge at 200 nm (6.199 eV)). Similarly, the emission onset and maximum peak positions for Cs2NaMCl6:M′ (M = Y, In, Sc; M′ = Rh3+) were reported at energies in the ranges of 1.3–1.4 eV and 1.04–1.07 eV, respectively, and ascribed to 1A1 → 3T1.125
The index of refraction n is another major optical properties of solid state materials.126 It is calculated using the real and imaginary parts of the relative dielectric function, eqn (3). The extinction coefficient κ, which is the imaginary part of the index of refraction, has an analogous dependence on ε1(ω) and ε2(ω), and is given by eqn (4). (3) (4)
As can be seen from Fig. 5 and 6a, n(ω) behaves in a similar manner to ε1(ω), but κ(ω) is negligibly small below the bandgap energies of A2AgRhBr6.
 Fig. 6  Optical properties of A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) series, including the (a) refractive index, (b) optical conductivity (Ω−1 m−1), and (c) absorption coefficient spectra, plotted in terms of the photon energy. Shown in (d) is the Tauc plot. 
The low frequency limit of n(ω) is close to 2.70, 2.80, 2.81, 2.84, and 2.85 for Cs2AgRhBr6, Rb2AgRhBr6, K2AgRhBr6, NA2AgRhBr6, and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively, which can either be obtained using the relationship , or from the plot shown in Fig. 6a. Moreover, both ε2 and κ increase gradually and become stronger when the photon energy is significantly larger than the fundamental bandgap energy; thus the maximum peak in their curves may correspond to a direct photoexcitation process.126
The frequency-dependent photoconductivity σ(ω) and photoabsorption coefficient α(ω) were calculated using eqn (5)127 and eqn (6),40 respectively. (5) (6)
In eqn (5), E is the energy of light in eV, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum in C2 Nm−2, and e is the charge of electron in coulomb. Similarly, in eqn (5), c and ω are the speed of light in vacuum and its frequency, respectively.
Since σ(ω) has a direct dependence on the imaginary part of the dielectric function (eqn (5)), it is obvious that σ(ω) would replicate the peak features of ε2(ω). Indeed, this is the case as illustrated in Fig. 6b. We also note that the conductivity of these materials is vanishingly small below the absorption edge, and is largest, 4.99 × 109 Ω−1 m−1, at the highest peak position seen at 1.80 eV for Cs2AgRhBr6. The replacement of lighter alkali atoms leads to a further increase in σ(ω), with σ values between 5.46 × 109 and 5.85 × 109 Ω−1 m−1 for Rb2AgRhBr6 and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively. A similar behavior is noted in the plot of α(ω) shown in Fig. 6c; this shows the maximum absorption coefficient occurs at the highest peak and varies between 5.7 × 105 and 6.3 × 105 in the energy range 0.0–5.0 eV, in agreement with what can be inferred from the Tauc plot shown in Fig. 6d. Although these are the predicted optical properties of A2AgRhBr6, one might expect that these would differ from their respective experimental values. Since there is no experimental data available yet, it is rather difficult to assess the extent of this expected difference. There is, however, precedence that DFPT calculated results match reasonably well with experiment for many halide single and double perovskites.66–70,72–79,116
As noted already above, meta-GGA SCAN-rVV10 cannot be used in combination with DFPT to evaluate the linear response properties. However, it can be utilized to evaluate such properties provided the derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals with respect to k, |∇kunk〉, can be computed using finite differences given by eqn (7).128 To this end, we generated the SCAN-rVV10 wavefunction with the 8 × 8 × 8 k-mesh. This, together with a dense k-mesh 12 × 12 × 12, was then used for an exact diagonalization of the dynamical matrix, involving the computation of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function (eqn (1) and (2)). In eqn (7), H(k) and S(k) are the Hamiltonian and overlap operator for the cell-periodic part of the orbitals, and the sum over n′ included a sufficiently large number of unoccupied states. (7)
Our SCAN-rVV10 results for ε(1)αβ(ω) and ε(2)αβ(ω), together with the absorption coefficient and Tauc spectra, are shown in Fig. S5 of the ESI.† The plots of the indices of refraction are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). A comparison of these with the corresponding ones shown in Fig. 5 and 6c, d (DFPT) shows that the absorption edge predicted using SCAN-rVV10 is significantly blue shifted. The shifted optical edge occurs between 1.7 and 1.9 eV, which are indeed very different from the fundamental SCAN-rVV10 bandgaps of A2AgRhBr6. In addition, the peak heights are reduced, yet without affecting the overall nature of the electronic transitions involved.
For reasons noted just above, we performed calculations to provide further insight into the actual nature of the bandgap of the studied systems. Therefore, we used the quasiparticle G0W0 and GW0 methods that relied on the underlying Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT),129–131 where G0 (or G) is the one-particle Green's function, W0 is the screened Coulomb interaction, and GW0 is the most usual step beyond single-shot GW (G0W0) to iterate the quasi-particle energies in the Greens functions. In fact, the G0W0 has calculated the Green's function G0 from the SCAN-rVV10 wavefunction in a non-self-consistent manner, and a perturbative scheme was utilized for the calculation of screened exchange in W0. The self-energy and one-shot calculations were performed using a 6 × 6 × 6 k-mesh. Table 5 compares the SCAN-rVV10 bandgaps with those of G0W0 and GW0, showing a significant underestimation of Eg by meta-GGA. However, the onset of optical absorption evidence of the imaginary part of the dielectric spectra (Fig. S5a and b, ESI†) agrees reasonably well with the G0W0 and GW0 bandgaps.

In order to shed further light on whether the G0W0 and GW0 bandgaps are reliable, we have relaxed the lattice geometries of several experimentally/theoretically known Type-II and Type-III halide double perovskites132 (Cs2AgSbBr6, Cs2SbAgBr6, Cs2AgTlBr6, Cs2TlAgBr6, Cs2AgInBr6, Cs2InAgBr6, Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2BiAgBr6) with SCAN-rVV10, PBE0 and HSE06. A 4 × 4 × 4 k-mesh was invoked for the latter two functionals, where HSE06 is the screened hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof;133 PBE0 is the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange energy and the Hartree–Fock exchange energy in a set 3:1 ratio (25% Hartree–Fock exchange), along with the full PBE correlation energy.134,135 The non-spin polarized calculations were performed. The bandgaps calculated on the relaxed perovskite lattices are summarized in Table 6.

As expected, SCAN-rVV10 has reproduced the lattice properties of all perovskites reported experimentally, but it significantly underestimated the bandgaps. It yielded a spurious band crossing for the Cs2AgTlBr6 and Cs2TlAgBr6 systems and hence the resulting band structures were metallic, which is contrary to experimental evidence (Eg = 0.95 eV136). A similar result was previously presented for Cs2InAgI6 with DFT/LDA,10 as well as for the lower-dimensional derivatives of the 3D double perovskite Cs2AgTlBr6.137 However, this problem is largely resolved when hybrid functionals such as PBE0 and HSE06 were used to explore the bandgaps since both the functionals incorporate a specific percentage of Hartree–Fock exchange. In particular, PBE0 gave a bandgap of 0.63 eV for Cs2AgTlBr6, and is comparable with the G0W0@HSE06 bandgap of 0.63 eV that underestimates the experimental gap of 0.95 eV by 0.32 eV.136 The overall best agreement between experiment and theory is achieved with both the functionals, PBE0 and HSE06, although it is difficult to say which functional best reproduces the bandgaps of all the perovskites examined. While the bandgap of some double perovskites predicted by PBE0 compares favorably with experimental values, it underestimates or overestimates that of other perovskites. The same is true for HSE06, which substantially underestimates the bandgaps of Cs2AgTlBr6 and Cs2TlAgBr6 (Table 6). Nevertheless, the results of Tables 5 and 6 confirm that A2AgRhBr6 are a group of materials with an appreciable bandgap that may find application in optoelectronics,138,139 and that the lattice and bandgap properties between A2AgRhBr6 and A2RhAgBr6 are virtually similar. This is unsurprising since double perovskites with their relatively large bandgaps ranging from 1.9 to 3.3 eV are known to be photo harvesters.10,140–142
3.7 Elastic properties
The three independent components that completely represent the elastic tensor Cij of a cubic lattice are the elastic constants C11, C12 and C44.39 By convention, the elastic constant C44 represents the resistance to deformation with respect to a shearing stress applied across the (100) plane in the [010] direction, whereas [C11 − C12]/2 represents the resistance to shear deformation by a shear stress applied across the (110) plane in the [10] direction.67
The three elastic constants listed in Table 7 are all positive, and C11 > C12 > C44 for all A2AgRhBr6. This shows that these materials have a weak resistance to shear in the (100) plane (quantified by C44) and a relatively strong resistance to longitudinal compression (quantified by C11). The A-site substitution by lighter alkali atoms causes a systematic decrease in the value of each of the three elastic constants passing down the series from Cs2AgRhBr6 to Li2AgRhBr6; hence the hardness, transverse compression and stiffness decreases in the same order. Since C44 ≠ [C11 − C12]/2, each A2AgRhBr6 is not locally isotropic,67 as also indicated by the bulk modulus B (B = [C11 + 2C12]/3).

The elastic anisotropy of cubic crystals can be assessed using Zener's elastic anisotropy index ,147 Ranganathan–Ostoja–Starzewski's universal elastic anisotropy index ,67 or the Log-Euclidean anisotropy parameter AL proposed by Kube ,148,149 where B is the bulk modulus, K is the shear modulus, and V and R represent the Voigt and Reuss approximations, respectively. The elastic anisotropic indices are listed in Table 7 and the elastic moduli are listed in Table 8. From the first, it is apparent that AU and AL are close to 0.1 for Cs2AgRhBr6. As one passes across the series from Cs2AgRhBr6 through Rb2AgRhBr6 to Li2AgRhBr6, AU (and AL) anisotropy increase significantly from 0.1 (0.1) to 3.8 (2.9). This trend is the opposite to that observed for AZ, which, at 0.8, is largest for Cs2AgRhBr6 and smallest for Cs2AgRhBr6 (0.2). Although AZ provides a signature of the presence of elastic anisotropy in all A2AgRhBr6, it is not universal. This discrepancy is not very surprising given that AZ depends on the ratios of individual stiffness coefficients to define anisotropy (viz., the ratio of the maximum and minimum values of the crystallite's shear modulus), but does not account for the tensorial nature of the elastic stiffness, that is, it does not account for the shear and the bulk contributions that might be necessary given that the systems examined are not perfectly isotropic.

Our calculations resulted in eigenvalues λi of the Cij = Cji matrix that are both real and positive for all A2AgRhBr6. From the data in Table 7, we also found that (i) C11 − C12 > 0; (ii) C11 + 2C12 > 0; (iii) C44 > 0. The satisfying of these elastic stability conditions validates the Born criteria recommended for cubic crystals, demonstrating that A2AgRhBr6 are mechanically stable.39
The Voigt and Reuss estimates of Young's modulus (Y) of all A2AgRhBr6 are slightly different from each other (Table 8). The same is also observed for their shear (K) and bulk (B) moduli. The average values of Y range from 24.8 GPa (for Li2AgRhBr6) to 34.4 GPa (Cs2AgRhBr6). Those of K and B are in the ranges 9.0–13.4 GPa and 33.8–36.8 GPa, respectively. These may be compared with CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) halide perovskite compounds (B, K and Y are in the ranges 12–30 GPa, from 3–12 GPa, and from 15–37 GPa, respectively).73
The Poisson's ratio σ, which is the ratio between the transverse strain to longitudinal strain in the elastic loading direction, is calculated to vary between 0.30 and 0.40 for A2AgRhBr6. This suggests that the M–Br (M = Ag, Rh) bonds are less ionic in Cs2AgRhBr6 and Rb2AgRhBr6 than in K2AgRhBr6, Na2AgRhBr6 to Li2AgRhBr6 since σ is typically between 0.1 and 0.25 for covalent materials150–152 and is larger for ionic and metallic materials (for example, σ for some gold, copper and aluminum alloys are 0.42, 0.33 and 0.33, respectively).73 For comparison, Feng has examined the elastic properties of halide perovskites, and found that σ for these systems is always >0.3.73 This led him to suggest that halide perovskites are more like a molecular crystal and that their bandgap can be easily tunable using strain engineering. Apart from this, the ratio of bulk to shear modulus (B/K) called Pough's ratio, systematically increases in the series as the size of A in A2AgRhBr6 decreases, with values varying between 2.5 and 4.0. This characterizes these materials as ductile, since materials with B/K > 1.75 are ductile and those with B/K < 1.75 are brittle.73,153–155
3.8 Energetic stability: pathway for formability
While all perovskites examined in this study are mechanically stable, we propose the following (reaction) pathway to provide our view on their formability:  where A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li, and E represents the relaxed total energy of individual species.
Our calculation, considered per formula unit, gave ΔE of −1.20, −0.81, −0.18, 1.85, and +2.88 eV for Cs2AgRhBr6, Rb2AgRhBr6, K2AgRhBr6, NA2AgRhBr6 and Li2AgRhBr6, respectively, where ΔE = [E(A2AgRhBr6)2) − (E(AgBr)2 + E(ABr)4 + E(RhBr3)2)]. The negative sign of ΔE for the first three systems suggests thermodynamic stability, and the other two are thermodynamically unstable; the first three could be synthesizable given appropriate experimental conditions. Although the calculation of perfect convex hulls is beyond the scope of this study, investigation of such a feature may provide further insight into the potential of other products.
4. Conclusion
In this study we used various theoretical approaches to examine the perovskite stability, geometries, electronic and optical properties of the series A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na, Li) and showed that whereas the first two members of the series have a stable perovskite structure, the latter three are best regarded as distorted perovskites. This is emerged from the newly proposed tolerance factor, even though the joint analysis of octahedral and Goldschmidt tolerance factors suggested that A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb, K, Na) are stable perovskites. The global instability index, on the other hand, recognized all the systems as perovskites, which means that it may not always be suitable for the analysis of the formability of perovskites.
We have shown that all the five A2AgRhBr6 systems display very similar light-absorption properties in the infrared-to-visible region. Specifically, we showed that the optical constants, viz. the refractive index, absorption coefficient, and optical conductivity would increase marginally when the cation Cs in Cs2AgRhBr6 is replaced by lighter alkali atoms; thus the A-site substitution by the lighter alkali atom does not play a significant role in modifying the geometrical, electronic and optical properties of these systems. Using the phonon band dispersion and DOS, we showed that A2AgRhBr6 (A = Rb, K, Na, Li) were dynamically unstable, mechanically stable and ductile. Such phonon instabilities are by far the most common features of single halide perovskites in the cubic phase, as previously observed for cubic MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) light absorbers. Taking into account the properties such as the geometrical stability, the direct nature of the bandgap, the small effective masses of charge carriers, and the high absorption coefficient, we conclude that A2AgRhBr6 (A = Cs, Rb) are two possible candidate species for synthesis and optoelectronic applications. Although Cs2AgRhBr6 was found to be dynamically stable, the phonon instability observed for especially for Rb2AgRhBr6 and K2AgRhBr6 shouldn’t prevent their synthesis, given that this was possible for dynamically unstable single perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I).

 	Fig. 1  Mixed polyhedral and ball-and-stick model of SCAN-rVV10 relaxed geometry of the conventional unit-cell of Cs2AgRhBr6. Nearly similar structures were obtained for all other members of the series, A2AgRhBr6 (A= Rb, K, Na, Li). Each metal ion is involved in a hexa-coordinate bonding interaction with the surrounding bromide ions. The central alkali metal ion is involved in a dodecahedral coordination with the bromide ions.
