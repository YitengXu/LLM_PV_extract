    , Accepted 9th July 2021First published on 9th July 2021AbstractAs a green, visible-light-driven metal-free semiconductor material, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has generated tremendous significance in the fields of environmental purification and energy conversion. Inducing a polarization effect by creating defects in g-C3N4 is a promising strategy for improving photocatalytic properties. The polarization effect in photocatalysts could be created by manufacturing vacancies, doping impurity atoms, constructing heterostructure, etc. Recently, defective g-C3N4 has attracted wide attention due to its remarkable performance in the separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers. However, the relationship between defects and the polarization effect remains to be clarified in terms of improving the photocatalytic performance. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances on how the polarization effect and defect engineering expedite the photogenerated carrier migration and separation to improve the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4. Is it pure synergy or is there some degree of antagonism? Ultimately, the major challenges for simply constructing the polarization effect and internal electric field in g-C3N4 and inspiring perspectives for future opportunities in polarization-defect type photocatalysis are discussed. It is believed that this work can provide a new idea for the design of novel and efficient photocatalysts in the future.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic technology is one of the important means to solve energy shortage and environmental pollution, which affects the sustainable development of society.1,2 Graphitic carbon nitride, and other semiconductor photocatalytic materials have elicited enormous growing attention in the field of photocatalysis because semiconductor photocatalytic technology has the potential to maintain the future development of the earth. Importantly, g-C3N4 with an excellent electronic structure, high stability, and facile synthesis methods has raised waves of an upsurge in the scientific research as photocatalytic semiconductor materials.3,4 Before this, much research has been reported on applications of g-C3N4 in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),5,6 contaminant degradation,7,8 CO2 photoreduction,9,10 electrochemical nitrogen fixation11,12 and other fields.13–15 However, the photocatalytic properties of pristine g-C3N4 are still impeded by its lower specific surface area, larger band gap, and fast recombination of electron–hole pairs.16 As the efficient photocatalytic reaction requires rapid separation and less recombination of a large number of e−/h+ pairs, introducing defect sites is an effective method to generate the polarization effect in the photocatalyst and then facilitating carrier transfer throughout the photocatalytic process.17,18
As a matter of fact, the process of photocatalysis can be divided into three steps,19 the first step of the process is the photoabsorption, in which photocatalyst covert energy into electron–hole pairs.20 Subsequently, photogenerated carriers are separated and transferred to the surface of the photocatalyst. Then, redox reactions with reactants occur on the surface of the photocatalyst. Nevertheless, most photogenerated electron–hole pairs recombine actually and do not participate in surface reactions. This is due to the fact that the electron–hole pair is formed and transferred to the reaction site in a very short time, which is much faster than the charge transfer and consumption in photocatalysis. It means that the majority of the photogenerated e− and h+ tend to recombine with each other in the photocatalyst interior before arriving at the surface. Therefore, only a fraction of electrons and holes could be used for subsequent surface migration and eventual surface catalytic reactions.21 Some strategies were explored to enhance carrier separation, such as the introduction of vacancy, heteroatomic doping and heterojunction formation,22–24 which often generate surface defects to form more charge separation and active centers, thus improving the photocatalytic activity of the system. But is the activity only due to the formation of defect states, or is the polarization effect of surface charge after the modification needed to be taken into account? The initial structure of the electron cloud morphed after the introduction of the defects into the framework of g-C3N4, so that the positive and negative electric centers do not overlap, and the existence of high and low-density regions of valence was transformed into a polarization electric field.25,26 The polarization electric field significantly increases the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs in g-C3N4 and becomes the driving force of photogenerated carrier migration.27
In recent years, research on defective g-C3N4 has been increasing gradually and remarkable progress has been made. A series of reviews on defective g-C3N4 have been published which cover the scope from preparation methods to application fields. However, the relationship between defects of g-C3N4 and the polarization effect needs to be further studied. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the number of publications on defective g-C3N4 increased year by year during 2012–2020, and the research on the influence of the polarization effect of g-C3N4 system on photocatalytic performance also showed an increasing trend during this period. Therefore, it can be predicted that the relationship between the defect structure and polarization effect on the regulation mechanism of photocatalytic properties will inevitably arouse the interest and resonance of researchers.

This brief review investigates recent research on enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C3N4 by the polarization effect and defect engineering. It is found that forming a polarization electric field can change the electron distribution in the g-C3N4 framework by manufacturing defects. After the formation of the polarization electric field, the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 can be promoted by increasing the efficiency of carrier separation, so as to be more effectively applied in the field of photocatalysis. Specifically, the situation and mechanism of the synergistic and antagonistic effects of polarization effect and defect level will be systematically interpreted in this minireview (Fig. 2). This work will start from the typical examples of the polarization effect and defect effect, systematically analyze the mechanism and core key factors of each effect, find out the synergistic point and demarcation point of the two effects, and clarify the key links and main directions that are needed to be controlled in the process of material preparation. Lastly, the current challenges and inspiring perspectives for the future will be provided.

2. Mechanism of the polarization effect
Polarity is usually found in non-centrosymmetric materials, such as defective g-C3N4,28 ZnO,29 and BiOIO3.30 The polarization effect induces a region of negative charge on one side of the material structure and a region of positive charge on the other side, thus generating a polarized electric field, which is directed from the positive charge region to the negative charge region.31–33 The electron is the protagonist in the photocatalytic process and the electron behavior determines photocatalytic properties. In recent years, it has been found that the separation of photogenerated carriers can be promoted in the non-centrosymmetric photocatalyst by the polarization electric field, which acts as a direct internal driving force to promote the transfer efficiency of photoexcited charges to the surface of the material, thus involved in the redox reaction (Fig. 3). The surface charge can be predicted by the following standard bound-charge expression:34,35 σsurf = P·(1)where P is the electric polarization and  is the surface normal. The edge charge linear bound-charge density can be expressed by the following formula:36,37 (2)where  is the surface polarization on facet j and j is a unit vector lying in the plane of the facet and pointing toward (and normal to) the edge.

3. Relationship between the polarization effect and defect engineering
Commonly, the structure of g-C3N4 can be regarded as the product which is replaced by nitrogen atoms in the graphene skeleton.44 The electronic structure of VB and CB is formed by the superposition of electron orbitals of nitrogen and carbon atoms, in which the lone pair of nitrogen atoms is the main component of the band structure and valence band.45
After the introduction of defects, the band structure and electronic structure in the pristine g-C3N4 framework will be changed to make the electron distribution uneven and generate the polarization effect, thus improving the charge transfer efficiency.46–48
3.1 Polarization effect introduction with self-structural defect
Self-structural defect introduction will promote the generation of the polarization effect in g-C3N4. It includes vacancy and self-doping without the addition of other structures or semiconductors. Since vacancy is widely believed to cause local electronic state distortion, the introduction of vacancy in g-C3N4 can not only offer a rich exciton dissociation interface but also, more importantly, provide a strong driving force for exciton dissociation to obtain free electrons and holes.49 The existence of vacancies in g-C3N4 will emerge more free electrons on the crystal surface, and the efficiency of unsaturated N or C atoms to capture photogenerated electrons will be expeditiously formed, which will lead to uneven charge distribution on the g-C3N4 surface.50 Installing g-C3N4 with vacancy could result in the polarization effect on the g-C3N4 surface and inhibit the photoinduced carrier recombination. Furthermore, the vacancy can also weaken NN and promote the separation of carriers.51
In a similar context, doping different elements will affect the electron distribution in the internal structure of g-C3N4.52 Once the atoms are doped in g-C3N4, heteroatoms will bond with C atoms or N atoms. The charge distribution is not uniform due to different electronegativities of the atoms. The non-uniform charge distribution results in the formation of the polarization effect in the doped g-C3N4.53,54 Heteroatoms with high-priced electrons tend to produce electrons to the energy level near the conduction band. Conversely, heteroatoms with fewer valence electrons are more sensitive to electron acceptances near the induced valence band.55,56 In addition, heteroatom doping leads to asymmetric spin density, and the existence of the polarized effect is conducive to the adsorption of molecules, increasing the efficiency of carrier separation and thus enhancing the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4.57
3.2 g-C3N4-Based composite with internal electric field
Semiconductor heterojunctions are generally interfaces between two different semiconductor regions with different band structures and produce different energy band arrangements.58,59 It is an exciting way to improve the photocatalytic performance to unite another semiconductor onto defective g-C3N4 to construct a semiconductor composite system. The internal electric field is formed at the interface of the two semiconductors by combining defective g-C3N4 with a suitable semiconductor. Furthermore, the polarization effect induced by defects and internal electric field creates synergies, which accelerates the transfer of photogenerated electrons at the interface inhibits the carrier's recombination process.60 At the same time, the presence of defects can also provide active sites for the composite structure and improve the photocatalytic performance of the composite system.4
4. Effect of polarization on photocatalytic properties
4.1 Method for synthesis of g-C3N4
Since 2009, g-C3N4 has been used for photocatalytic hydrogen production, numerous attempts were researched for g-C3N4, including the precursors, preparation methods, and control of the reaction conditions (Table 1). These previous works created a solid foundation for synthesizing defective g-C3N4 and significantly impacting the performance of the catalyst. Yu et al.70 synthesized bulk g-C3N4 by thermopolymerization using melamine as the precursor without any template. Then, g-C3N4 was treated by a hydrothermal method again to graft hydroxyl groups on the surface of g-C3N4. The constant C/N of the sample indicated that the framework of g-C3N4 did not transform at all. Meanwhile, the electron polarization effect between the hydroxyl groups and the interlayer of g-C3N4 was noticeable, promoting local spatial charge separation and proton activation. Similarly, Sun et al.71 doped K atoms in the g-C3N4 structure through KOH-assisted hydrothermal recombination of melamine, which enormously increased the number of surface active sites, expanded the absorption range of visible light and improved HER efficiency. Compared with melamine powder, urea solution is easier to generate in situ gas during the heating process, promoting the generation of defects. Gao et al.72 prepared g-C3N4 nanosheets with C defects by calcining urea solution. Gases such as CO2 and NH3 released in the urea solution impinged on g-C3N4 lamellar, changed the connectivity and local filling of the g-C3N4 structure, shortened the distance of electron transfer channels between layers, and finally formed C vacancies. Under the same conditions, the samples prepared with thiourea as precursors presented higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency than those crafted with melamine and dicycyanamide as precursors. This may be due to the presence of sulfur groups, which increase the specific surface area of samples during the process of calcination. Hong et al.73 heated thiourea in air and thermally condensed it to realize the synthetic process of g-C3N4. High-temperature conditions favored electron delocalization and enhanced photocatalytic performance.

4.2 Vacancy defects with polarization effect
Until now, there have already been many works emphasizing benefits for photocatalytic properties by introducing vacancy defects on g-C3N4.74 The existence of N vacancy changes the electronic structure between bonds in the g-C3N4, forming the surface polarization effect on the surface of g-C3N4, which enhances the transfer efficiency of charge and change the band structure of g-C3N4. It can be seen from Table 2. That the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 with the vacancy in different fields have been improved. Examples of introducing N vacancy in g-C3N4 through temperature-controlling route by Niu and co-workers in the early 2012.75 The changes in the XPS spectrum significantly indicated that the N vacancy is concentrated at N2c sites (Fig. 4a–c). Hence, the photocatalytic activity was enhanced considerably by increasing percentages of photogenerated charge carriers in g-C3N4 with N vacancies. The N vacancy increases the electron density around the unsaturated C atom and the uneven distribution of electrons in the plane, thus generating the surface polarization effect.76 In a similar context, inducing carbon vacancy will also change the local electron state density to induce the surface polarization effect, and C vacancy can trap photogenerated electrons located in the surface of g-C3N4, thus impeding the efficiency of electrons and holes recombination.66,69 Liang and co-workers77 prepared C vacancy g-C3N4 (VC-C3N4) for the photocatalytic removal of BPA via a two-step calcination method (Fig. 4d). The kinetic constant (k) of BPA degradation showed that the photodegradation ability of VC-C3N4 was much higher than that of the sample without vacancy (Fig. 4e). Carbon vacancies induced into the g-C3N4 could not only serve as active sites to hinder the recombination of electrons and holes, but also conversion centers to trap photoinduced electrons, thus causing degradation of refractory organic pollutants. Meanwhile, Shen and co-workers78 designed and prepared a C-vacancy modified g-C3N4 sample (Fig. 4f), which exhibited excellent photocatalysis for enhancing the CO2 photocatalytic reduction activity, with a CO2-to-CO conversion rate (2 times higher). This ideal photocatalytic property originated from the introduction of foreign groups in g-C3N4 and was incorporated with defect engineering, which leads to the generation of a polarization electric field. However, a giant quantity of vacancies appearing on the surface of g-C3N4 may have caused more distortion or fracture of the C–N bond and break the framework of g-C3N4. It is well known that g-C3N4 prepared by thermally-induced polymerization has low crystallinity and high-density defects may form the complex center of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in a low carrier transfer efficiency in photocatalytic reactions. The research introducing different N vacancy contents into CNV-1, CNV-2 and CNV-3 samples via the hydrothermal treatment for photocatalytic H2 evolution was reported by Hong and co-workers.79 Furthermore, due to the increase of N vacancies in the sample CNV-3, the C–N bond in the g-C3N4 framework was broken, leading to a decrease in photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency. Compared with CNV-2, the N/C rate of CNV-3 was enhanced, caused by the increase in –NH2.

Thus, the photocatalytic properties can be improved by changing the morphology and structure of the sample and improving the carrier migration efficiency. Nowadays, designing various nanostructures is still a fascinating method to increase carrier transfer efficiency.80,81 It is worth emphasizing that g-C3N4 with both different nanostructures and defects can establish transfer channels inside for the charge migration and generate surface polarization on g-C3N4 to synergistically promote the charge transfer. Very recently, Zhou and co-workers49 installed g-C3N4 nanosheets with N vacancies in a reductive gas environment and modified them to obtain g-C3N4-VN Ns sample with a more uniform N vacancy (Fig. 5). As a result, the concentration of free carrier of g-C3N4-VN Ns modified by vacancy is more than 4 times higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 Ns, and it has better degradation performance for organic compounds. Furthermore, Di et al.82 obtained porous ultrathin g-C3N4 with C vacancies by conducting a thermal treatment of g-C3N4 (Fig. 6). Notably, the sample generated a polarization effect facilitating the acceleration of electron transfer from the internal to the surface. Moreover, the degradation of RhB was improved by 96.2% at the same time.

As known, defective g-C3N4 with holy structure has excellent carrier migration characteristics and specific surface area. Yang's group83 designed a method for the construction of Holey g-C3N4 (HGCN) materials under NH3 atmosphere by thermally treating bulk graphitic carbon nitride (BGCN). From the Mott–Schottky plots, it can be seen that the electron donor density of HGCN was enhanced (Fig. 7a). As a result of C vacancy, the electron donor density of HGCN increased and obtained a much higher specific surface area, which speeds up the photogenerated charge transfer (Fig. 7b).

As mentioned above, different nanostructures of defective g-C3N4 are great photocatalytic materials with moderate energy bands and high carrier transfer efficiencies, having great potential for photocatalytic. Besides, C vacancies or N vacancies can not only be formed independently but also exist in the g-C3N4 framework side by side.84 The electrons in VB can be excited to midgap or CB according to different energies of light absorption, which enhances the carrier migration characteristics.85 Meanwhile, the existence of defects also greatly expanded the absorption range of light, so that the efficiency of light utilization significantly improved. For example, Song et al.86 fabricated a series of porous g-C3N4 (U-xPEI) with C and N defects by using urea and polyethylenimine (PEI) through a simple thermal condensation. The existence of the surface polarization effect causes a midgap between the VB and CB in U-xPEI sample, and the sample exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic photoreduction of CO2 (Fig. 8).87

In summary, the fabrication of vacancy-modified g-C3N4 is mainly through heat treatment. The introduction of vacancy changes the electron distribution in g-C3N4, generates the polarized effect and speeds up the separation efficiency of electron–hole pairs. In addition, the existent of vacancy can provide richer surface active sites, displaying contractions with high photocatalytic performances, and different nanostructures also facilitate the transport of photogenerated carriers.
4.3 Heteroatom doping with polarization effect on g-C3N4

4.3.1 Surface polarization effect on doped g-C3N4. 
The electron distribution in g-C3N4 will change, resulting in a polarization effect when the combination of atoms in the structure of g-C3N4 changes. Therefore, the efficiency of the carrier transfer can be increased by doping with other impurity atoms. The different photoelements show disparate characteristics in semiconductors, and heteroatoms with strong electronegativity are doped in the skeleton of g-C3N4, resulting in uneven charge distribution in defective g-C3N4. In the research of photocatalysts doped with different atoms in g-C3N4, different kinds and positions of doped atoms show different activity mechanisms on the polarization effect. In addition, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional can be used to calculate the free energy after atom doping by DFT calculations. Our group53 used HCl as a medium to design the defective g-C3N4 by doping with Cl atom (g-C3N4−xClx) by microwave etching, it was proved that doping can generate a surface polarization electric field in the semiconductor by combining with the charge density diagram and experimental results, thus speeding up the separation and transport of charge carriers (Fig. 9). Under simulated solar irradiation, g-C3N4−xClx showed an excellent degradation effect on organic pollutant solutions within 7.5 hours. As mentioned above, our results show that induced surface polarization field formed can accelerate the photoinduced charge effectively separation, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Lu and co-workers88 synthesized a g-C3N4 sample doped with sulfur to remove radioactive material, sulfur atoms replaced N atoms on the lattice to form a unique electronic structure and narrowed the width between CB and VB. As can be seen from Fig. 10a, the HOMO/LUMO spacing decreases from 1.5 eV to 0.81 eV and 0.84 eV. The S–C bond is longer than the N–C bond, which reduces the adsorption space and improves the removal effect of radioactive substances (Fig. 10b).

4.3.2 Internal electric field on doped g-C3N4. 
Replacing C atoms or N atoms with appropriate elements on the g-C3N4 framework can change the local electron density, producing a polarization effect to induce an internal electric field, and thus improving the photocatalytic efficiency.89 Unlike surface polarization, further polarization of the photocatalyst forms an internal electric field inside. With the increase of the photocatalyst doped atoms and surface decoration groups, the efficiency of surface charge redistribution is improved, which accelerates photoinduced-carrier migration. In 2019, Li and his group90 synthesized an O-doped sample with a unique electronic structure (ACN, ACN*) (Fig. 11a). The doping of O atoms changes the electron density of g-C3N4 as the O atom is more electronegative than the N atom. Free electrons are concentrated around oxygen atoms, so that the density of electrons around oxygen atoms increases, forming an internal electric field and promoting the transfer of charge carriers (Fig. 11b). Similarly, Wang and co-workers91 synthesized g-C3N4 nanobelt with different concentrations of phosphorus element, and analyzed the chemical composition and structure of the prepared samples. The results suggest that the doping of phosphor was at the corner-carbon position.100 According to the further analysis of HOMO and LUMO configurations (Fig. 11c), by contrast, HOMO in carbon nitride nanobelt (CN-NB) and P-doped CN-NB (P-CN-NB) is asymmetric. The internal orbital of P-CN-NB is moved to the left, and the spacing between different atomic orbitals is significantly reduced. The e−/h+ pairs are more closely distributed on the right channel, which is beneficial for the separation of e− and h+. Through the experimental results and the calculation of DFT, it was found that there was an increase in the degradation efficiency of P-CN-NB because of the formation of the internal electric field with the introduction of phosphorus atoms and other surface groups, which narrow the band gap and significantly improves the efficiency of hydrogen evolution (Fig. 11d). Furthermore, co-doping can combine the advantages of single doping to improve the photocatalytic activity.

Yan and his group101 synthesized a g-C3N4 sample co-doping with N atoms and O atoms. It was found that the electron density decreases near the C atom near the O atom through DFT calculations, while electrons gather around the N atom (Fig. 12a–c). The redistribution of electron density causes polarization within the photocatalyst, which inhibits the recombination of photogenerated e−/h+ pairs (Fig. 12d), thereby significantly increasing the H2 evolution rate.

Nevertheless, excessive doping of elements will also have an impact on the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. A proper amount of doping of metal elements will form a metal–N bond and accelerate the transfer efficiency of charge carriers. If excessive dopant is added, the desired effect will not be achieved during the synthesis process. For example, Chen and his group102 synthesized a Co-doped g-C3N4 sample by the thermal polycondensation method. When the proportion of dopants containing the Co element is more, a large amount of Co2+ will block the formation of g-C3N4 in the thermal polycondensation process. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the final sample decreased. Similarly, Zhang et al.103 synthesized the Na-doped g-C3N4 sample, and excessive doping of Na atoms will lead to a more positive band, and other impurities will be introduced into the g-C3N4 skeleton, resulting in reduced photocatalytic efficiency.
Besides, doped atoms with a small atomic radius and high electronegativity have the highest doping efficiency. Doped impurities can also act as electron or hole traps, helping to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Zhu et al.104 reported an excellent photocatalyst based on the favorable characteristics of two heteroatoms doped in g-C3N4. The F atom in the g-C3N4 framework has the highest mass content, the F atom has the lowest atomic radius and the strongest electronegativity, and the high electronegativity of the F atom is conducive to the formation of CN, which increases the crystallinity of g-C3N4. Meanwhile, introducing the K atom and halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I) can induce the internal electric field, reduce the band gap structure, optimize the electron band structure, and also benefit the hydrogen-produced reduction of photoelectric electrons.105 Then, inserting alkali metals between layers can also form an internal electric field.106,107 The interlaminar electron channel mediated by doped atoms provides additional power for interlaminar charge separation, further strengthening the polarization effect, which makes it easier for photoelectrons to reach the surface of the photocatalyst and participate in the photocatalytic process. Xiong et al.108 found that K atoms and Na atoms doping have different effects on the charge distribution of g-C3N4 by analyzing the difference of the space charge distribution and ELF of CN-K2 and CN-Na2 (Fig. 12f). The results show that the K atom can combine with two adjacent layers of atoms to form a charge transfer channel, which is in synergy with the internal electric field to accelerate the transfer of charge carriers (Fig. 12e).


4.3.3 Spin-polarization on doped g-C3N4. 
Spin polarization is generated in a different way than the polarization field described above, in that, each doped atom induces a local magnetic moment in the non-magnetic g-C3N4, and the distribution of doped atoms extranuclear electrons has specific rules. The magnetic moments produced by these doped atoms show similar effects to ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism and electrons showing noticeable anisotropy features, depending on the position of the doped atoms in g-C3N4. Spin polarization can also spontaneously generate a dipole moment, which produces a polarized electric field that allows effective charge carriers migration.109
Carbon doping is a typical way of proving spin polarization by first-principles calculations in the g-C3N4 structure.110,111 Yang et al.112 reported that by doping C atoms in the plane to induce electron spin polarization to generate polarization electric field, and by adjusting the electron band gap to improve the photocatalytic performance (Fig. 13a and b). These C atoms are doped at the g-C3N4 vacancy position, and the change of the g-C3N4 band gap is also different from the doping concentration of C atoms, which is conducive to the separation and transfer of charge. Also, in spin polarization, the position distribution of doped atoms in the photocatalyst is independent of the doping concentration, and thus it has catalytic performance independent of the doping concentration. Embedded B atoms can make g-C3N4 a kind of efficient oxidation activation catalyst, and induce significant spin polarization in the g-C3N4 framework, reducing the disintegration barrier of O2 on B/g-C3N4, and further promoting oxidation reactions (Fig. 13c and d).113

Spin polarization can be induced not only by nonmetallic doping, but also by metallic doping.114–116 Unlike nonmetallic atoms, which introduce magnetism through s and p electrons, metallic atoms provide magnetism through d and f electrons.117,118 Wang et al.119 doped Se atoms into g-C3N4, which made the electron spin polarization in Se–CNs framework significantly improve the surface catalytic reaction (Fig. 13e). The results showed that the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate reached 5411.2 μmol H−1 g−1 under 420 nm irradiation, which was 176.5-fold higher than that with CNs (Fig. 13f).
In short, doping has been widely used as an essential method for the modification of g-C3N4. It can be seen from Table 3 that the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 with doping atoms in different fields has been improved. Doping leads to the formation of new energy levels in the band gap, prolongs the visible light response, and inhibits the recombination rate of e− and h+. Some of these shortcomings have also been found in numerous reports of doping with g-C3N4. For example, overdoping atoms may be used as new composite centers, which lead to the improvement of electron–hole pair combination efficiency, and ultimately lead to a decrease in photocatalytic performance, and other problems that have yet to be resolved.120

5. Defective g-C3N4 composite system with internal electric field
Semiconductor heterojunctions are generally interfaces between two different semiconductor regions with different band structures and produce different band arrangements.121,122 Adding another semiconductor to g-C3N4 to form a composite structure is an interesting way to improve photocatalytic performance. When the defective g-C3N4 is combined with a suitable semiconductor, it forms an internal electric field at the interface of the two semiconductors. The combination of the internal electric field and the polarization effect accelerates the migration of photogenerated electrons at the interface and inhibits the recombination process of charge carriers. In general, composite materials formed on g-C3N4 can increase a series of improvements on the properties of g-C3N4.60 The Schottky junction or p–n junction is constructed to accelerate the carrier separation and expand the absorption range of the visible light.123,124 At the same time, defects can also provide active sites for the composite structure and improve the photocatalytic performance of the composite system.
5.1 Vacancy/g-C3N4-based composite system
It is a vital method to enhance the photocatalytic performance of semiconductors by constructing internal electric field, which is usually formed due to uneven charge distribution between two semiconductor interface. As mentioned above, the construction of surface vacancy defect has improved the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4, thus, the two thoughts can be combined to prepare the g-C3N4 based composite system with unique vacancy defects. Wang and his group125 prepared a Z-scheme W18O49/g-C3N4−x heterojunction, where the presence of the N vacancy induces free electron's continuous migration from graphitic carbon nitride to WO3+ ions to induce the growth of W18O49, and finally forms a heterojunction containing the O vacancy and N vacancy. The work functions of g-C3N4−x (001) with N vacancies were calculated to be 4.73 eV after the composite system formation, which indicates that g-C3N4−x has a higher Fermi level and carrier concentration. The generation of the internal electric field realized the transformation of the composite system from a type II heterojunction to a Z-scheme heterojunction and provided a shorter electron migration distance, and greatly improved the NO removal rate. Simultaneously, Wang et al.126 also prepared g-C3N4−x/BiOCl/WO2.92 heterojunctions. As the electronic transfer mode of the g-C3N4/BiOCl composite was similar to the II-type heterojunction, they used WO2.92 to grow on the surface of BiOCl, forming a double Z-scheme heterostructure. The synergistic effect of the polarization defect and internal electric field increased the NO removal rate to 68.7%. In addition, the existence of nitrogen space makes the original stable π-conjugation electronic structure be destroyed; localized electrons gathered in the nitrogen open site making it easier for the photogenerated electronic-hole pairs separation, inhibiting the composite carrier. The system obtained a more vital redox ability and oxidized NO to NO3−. When constructing the surface structure, the work functions and charge density differences were calculated according to Eq as follows:127,128 ϕ = Evac − Ef(3) Δρ = ρAB − ρA − ρB(4)in which ϕ represented the work functions and the Δρ represented the charge density difference, respectively.
5.2 Doping/g-C3N4-based composite system
Similar to the fabrication of vacancy defects, doping is also a fascinating way to build a larger electronic transfer platform of g-C3N4. Electron channels formed by heteroatoms and C or N atoms accelerate the separation of charge carriers.129 Meanwhile, the polarization effect that occurred at the semiconductor interface promotes charge transfer, which further promotes the carrier migration efficiency of the g-C3N4 composite system.
Due to the interaction of two semiconductors, the carriers are consumed or accumulated on the semiconductor surface, leading to the band edge bending on the interface of the composite system, which induces the charge transfer from type-II to Z-scheme mechanism.130,131 Wu and co-workers132 reported a compound structure of O-doped g-C3N4 and CoAl-LDH. The internal electric field and element doping further promoted the generation of strong oxidation radicals in the visible light degradation process, and the composite system exhibited 38 times degradation efficiency enhancement than O-doped g-C3N4 under the visible light (Fig. 14).

Recently, Huo et al.133 have successfully prepared an O-enriched Bi2WO6/g-C3N4 nanosheet composite structure (BWO-OV/OCN) heterojunction by a simple hydrothermal method. The visible light absorption capacity and redox capacity of O-doped g-C3N4 were improved by blackbody nature, and the removal rate of TC by the BWO-OV/OCN heterojunction was as high as 96.16% within 60 minutes.134
It is undoubtedly a method to significantly enhance the efficiency of exciton separation by constructing vacancies or doping heteroatoms in the g-C3N4 framework. However, the construction of the composite system still face great challenges. First of all, it is difficult to choose the semiconductor materials with suitable VB and CB to composite with g-C3N4. Meanwhile, a large number of experiments are needed to prove the stability and photocatalytic performance of defects constructed on g-C3N4. Besides, the lack of quantitative analysis of the electric field is also a complex problem for future research.
6. Summary and prospect
In summary, pristine g-C3N4 has the disadvantage of a high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers, which limits its photocatalytic efficiency. Graphitic carbon nitride with a defective structure has great potential to solve this problem. Many previous works have focused on g-C3N4 with different kinds of defects. These samples can change the charge transfer efficiency in g-C3N4 by generating various types of polarization effects or electric fields.
With the understanding of the critical role of polarization in charge separation and photocatalysis, methods for introducing polarization have become an important research direction. So far, there have been many works on the preparation of heterojunction materials consisting of g-C3N4 to vacancy/doped heteroatom g-C3N4 and other semiconductors. It is known that the generation of the polarization effect can significantly improve the carrier transfer efficiency. Specifically, improving the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 is to change the electronic structure in the pristine g-C3N4 by constructing vacancies or doping other atoms to form a polarization electric field, thus affecting the extent to which electrons are involved in the redox reaction. The existence of defects can not only generate a polarization electric field but also increase the surface active sites, which act as the capture site to restrain the direct recombination of electrons and holes.
Moreover, the covalent bond formed by the doped heteroatom and C or N atoms is conducive to the transfer of charge to the surface, increasing the asymmetry of the crystal structure and thus increasing the charge separation. However, it should be noted that selecting the appropriate doping elements or semiconductors for the construction of composite systems is crucial. Although there have been many studies on defective g-C3N4, there are still some deficiencies and difficulties in the research on the polarization effect and electric field engineering of defective g-C3N4.
In the future, we can focus on the development and testing of the characterization tool for studying the polarization effect. Especially in the measurement of the surface charge of photocatalyst, it is necessary to find a way to measure the accurate surface charge without the interference of the external environment, and more attention should be paid to the theoretical calculation methods of the polarization electric field and the mechanism of polarization electric field generation. At the same time, it's important to note that the preparation of defective g-C3N4 lacks precise and targeted preparation schemes, such as controlling the location, quantity, and the combination of defects in the g-C3N4 framework. The influence of different positions of defects (vacancy, doping) formation on the electron distribution in the g-C3N4 framework and photocatalytic performance should be lucubrated systematically. Furthermore, the density and distribution of defects should be further regulated to prevent excessive defect density from affecting the crystallinity and polarization effects. The preparation and regulation methods should also be applied to large-scale photocatalyst production, paving the way for future engineering applications.
Furthermore, the relationship between the defects and polarization effect still needs to be further explored. It is worth exploring from both computational and experimental aspects to develop new polarization types to promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The synergistic effect between the defect and polarization of g-C3N4 still needs to be further researched to understand the reaction mechanism and accelerate organic degradation, photocatalytic hydrogen production, CO2 photoreduction, etc. It is necessary to further improve the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 by novel preparation methods to deepen the understanding of the polarization effect. At the same time, an appealing area lies in the polarization effect of defects in the heterojunction on the surface and interface of two semiconductors, even at the whole system.
Many previous works indicate that a significant waste of energy occurs in the synthesis of g-C3N4, for example, requiring H2, N2, and high thermal polymerization temperatures. At the same time, the yield obtained is relatively low and harmful gases such as NH3 are emitted during the synthesis process. Some simple and quick methods should be applied in future research to synthesize low-energy consumption and high-sensitivity g-C3N4 materials for commercialization. In the field of novel solar energy exploitation, we should further explore the application of solar energy. In the next step, g-C3N4 can be used in energy field to convert organic matter or polymers in the environment into fuel to achieve artificial photosynthesis. In addition to its application in the field of photocatalysis, the stable photoluminescence intensity against photobleaching makes g-C3N4 an ideal candidate for fluorescence sensing. In the future, it can also be used as a fluorescent probe for the detection of various metal ions in industry or mines.135 Also, g-C3N4 has excellent biocompatibility and inherent blue light photoluminescence properties. This characteristic allows it to be applied in the biomedical field, cancer imaging and therapy, and effectively kills cancer cells under low-intensity light.136
In general, there is growing interest in g-C3N4 materials containing defects based on their great potential for application in photocatalysis or other fields. In this minireview, it is proposed that the existence of g-C3N4 defects can produce a polarization effect to affect photocatalytic performance, which can pave the way for future research so that we could have a better understanding of the relationship between defects and polarization to apply g-C3N4 in a broad field.
