    , Accepted 6th September 2014First published on 8th September 2014AbstractLow band-gap π-conjugated copolymers based on squaraine units alternated with thiophene or benzothiadiazole moieties were synthesized through Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling reactions, and through a metal-free polycondensation process using squaric acid. The metal-free polymerizations afforded higher molecular weights polymers, showing bright future for the synthesis of small band-gap π-conjugated polymers via less cost-effective and more environmental-friendly procedures. Additionally, the synthesized materials showed encouraging optoelectronic properties.
Introduction
Due to their strong and red-shifted light absorption, organic dyes have been widely investigated as semiconducting materials in light-emission or light-harvesting devices.1–8 These dyes consist of π-conjugated small organic molecules, and usually present very planar structures which favor enhanced intermolecular interactions in the solid state.8,9 Additionally, they represent attractive building blocks for conjugated polymers employed in similar applications. The main advantage of polymers over small molecules lies in their easy processability when suitably functionalized, leading to the targeted low-cost organic electronic devices.10,11 Indeed small molecules may require unstraightforward technique to form homogeneous films such as vacuum deposition,12 which can be hard to transpose on large surfaces. Various dyes were used as monomers for the synthesis of π-conjugated polymers, such as diketopyrrolopyrrole, isoindigo or boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY).6,13–15 Amongst them, squaraine (SQ) dyes attracted much attention due to their remarkable donor–acceptor–donor structure, leading to molecules with a small band-gap.16–21 Synthesis of π-conjugated polymers containing squaraine units is a promising strategy which was successfully employed to achieve materials with small band-gaps.22–28 The first example was reported by Treibs and co-workers, who described the preparation of an insoluble material obtained from pyrrole and squaric acid.16 However, no further investigation could be performed due to its unsoluble nature. Since then, variety of N-alkyl or 3-alkyl substituted derivatives were developed, showing improved solubility and optical band-gap around 1.8 eV.29 Numerous research efforts were focused to further decrease the band-gap and it was found that extension of the conjugation and inclusion of electron-rich units in the backbone accomplished the desired effect.30 By enhancing the planarity and electron-donating character of difunctional monomers, Havinga et al. achieved very small band-gap polysquaraines.31 If a squaraine-based monomer is appropriately functionalized, polysquaraines can be obtained via classical synthetic routes such as Yamamoto or Suzuki coupling reactions. For instance, Lambert and co-workers developed an indole-based squaraine dye bearing bromides that was subsequently polymerized by Yamamoto coupling.24 The resulting polymer showed an optical band-gap around 1.6 eV in film. Other research groups synthesized similar materials alternating the squaraine moiety with other conjugated subunits through Suzuki cross-coupling.28,32 Based on the reported data, it was concluded that increasing the electron-withdrawing strength of the unit inserted between the squaraine moieties induced an increase of the band-gap, also confirmed by the blue-shift in absorption between the phenylene (λsolmax = 681 nm) and tetrafluorophenylene (λsolmax = 614 nm) linkers. However this effect could be attributed to a stronger twist angle between units when replacing hydrogen by fluorine atoms. On the contrary, only a slight red-shift could be observed when using electron-donating units. Generally, light absorption of these materials is blue-shifted compared with the non-bridged polymer (λsolmax = 738 nm). This was attributed to a strong torsion angle induced by the spacing units.
It is noteworthy that π-conjugated polysquaraines can also be obtained via the condensation of an appropriate monomer with squaric acid, as demonstrated by the early work of Treibs et al. for instance,16 and later by Ajayaghosh and co-workers.33,34 The great advantage of this approach is that no transition metal catalyst is required. Moreover, the condensation of squaric acid with electron-rich molecules is less sensitive than metal-based couplings, and can be driven by a removal of the produced water during the reaction.
In this context, we developed two copolymers alternating squaraine sub-units with either the electron-donating thiophene moiety or the electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole motif in order to provide a better understanding on the behaviour of squaraine units included in a π-conjugated backbone. This work particularly aimed to compare two polymerization pathways leading to such polysquaraine derivatives by classical Stille or Suzuki cross-coupling reactions and metal-free polycondensation via the use of squaric acid.
Experimental
Materials and methods
Tetrahydrofuran (THF), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), toluene and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purified from a solvent purification system (MBraun MB-SPS-800) prior to use. Dioxane was dried over calcium hydride (CaH2) and distilled prior to use. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) was purified by sublimation at 160 °C under vacuum prior to use. Squaric acid was recrystallized in boiling water and then rinsed with cold water and acetone, followed by drying under vacuum at 40 °C overnight prior to use. Unless otherwise specified, all other solvents and chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers (Alfa Aesar, Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, Acros Organics, Scharlau, Orgalight or Strem Chemicals) and used as received.
Characterizations
The precursors and polymers were characterized by IR, HRMS, 1H and 13C NMR in order to determine their chemical structures. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer from a deuterated chloroform or dimethyl sulfoxide (CDCl3 or DMSO-d6) solution.
IR spectra were recorded with Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer using a 0.6 mm-diameter beam and a 4 cm−1 resolution. Samples were analyzed with the attenuated total reflexion (ATR) method.
A Kofler bench (Wagner & Munz Heizbank system Kofler type wme) was used to obtain melting points with a ±2 °C precision.
High resolution mass spectroscopy analyses were performed on an AutoSpec-Waters spectrometer (EI).
Molecular weights of the polymers were measured by SEC at 30 °C with CHCl3 as eluent, using a Malvern Viscotek TDA max, and PS standards were used for calibration.
Absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded for a polymer solution (0.01 g L−1 in CHCl3) and a polymer film casted from an CHCl3 solution (10 g L−1) using the spectrophotometers UV-3600, Shimadzu and Fluoromax-4, Horiba Scientific, respectively.
Energetic levels were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in a glovebox in electrolyte solutions of 0.1 M TBAPF6 in CHCl3. Platinum was used as both working and counter electrodes and a silver wire was used as reference electrode. The obtained potentials were recalibrated outside the glovebox using ferrocene and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference.
For solar cell devices preparation, etched ITO glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 were used. After cleaning of ITO glass substrate in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, ethanol, iso-propanol for 15 min and treated in a UV/O3 cleaner for 20 min, PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at a spin speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s forming 50 nm thick layers. The samples were annealed for 1 h at 110 °C. All procedures were performed in an inert-atmosphere glovebox of nitrogen (O2 and H2O < 0.1 ppm). Different blend ratio of PSQBT and PCBM were prepared by making 24 mg ml−1 solutions in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The photoactive layer (squaraine-based polymer:PCBM 1:1 wt%) was spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT–PSS layer from o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solutions at 50 °C. The thickness of the photoactive layer was typically of 80 nm. The Al cathode was thermally deposited (100 nm) through a shadow mask under high vacuum (10−6 mbar). The active areas of the devices were ca. 8.4 mm2. An annealing treatment was performed at 120 °C after the cathode deposition during 20 minutes. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 4200 SCS under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2 from a K.H.S. Solar Celltest 575 solar simulator with AM1.5 filters and in the dark.
Syntheses of precursors and polymers


p-Bromophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (1). 
A mixture of p-bromoaniline (34.51 g, 0.200 mol), 100 ml of water and 50 ml of hydrochloric acid (36 wt%) was stirred and cooled down to 0 °C. Then, a solution of sodium nitrite (15.00 g, 0.217 mol) in 45 ml of water was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min at 0 °C, and the precipitate was filtered off. The resulting filtrate was then added dropwise to a solution of ammonium sulfite (59.02 g, 0.440 mol) in 125 ml of water which was previously cooled down to 0 °C, forming a yellow precipitate. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C, and the precipitate was filtered off. The resulting filtrate was added to 60 ml of hydrochloric acid (36 wt%) and heated to reflux until a red solid formed and redissolved. The solution was then allowed to cool to room temperature, during which pink crystals formed, and left at 5 °C overnight. The crystals were recovered by filtration, washed with a small amount of 1 M hydrochloric acid and dried for 4 h at 50 °C under vacuum to give the final product (25.66 g, 57%).

A subsequent purification by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2–ethyl acetate 85:15) followed by drying at 40 °C under vacuum overnight afforded the pure compound (8) as a yellow-orange powder (384 mg, 83%).

Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers
Various monomers based on an indolenine derivative coupled with squaraine, thiophene and benzothiadiazole moieties have been synthesized. General procedures for the syntheses of all the monomers are represented in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Syntheses of monomers. 
As a starting compound for the syntheses of the different monomers, an indolenine derivative functionalized with a bromine (2) was synthesized in two steps from p-bromoaniline following a reported procedure.35 A subsequent quaternization of 2 with hexadecyl iodide in nitromethane afforded the indolium iodide 3, which was then reacted with 0.45 equivalent of squaric acid in a toluene–1-butanol mixture (50/50 vol%) to form the dibromosquaraine derivative 5, using quinoline as a base to enhance the deprotonation and reactivity of the indolium derivative 3. The selective formation of the 1,3-condensation isomer 5 as a major product was ensured by the use of mixture of toluene and 1-butanol, as already reported.29 Such monomer was already successfully used in the synthesis of polysquaraine via Yamamoto coupling.24 Bromines would provide a versatile reactivity towards usual coupling reactions employed in the synthesis of π-conjugated polymers such as Suzuki or Stille cross-coupling.
Additionally, monomers presenting a reactivity towards squaric acid were designed and synthesized to produce similar materials through metal-free polycondensation reaction. The commercially available 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene was reacted with 2.2 equivalents of the previously synthesized bromoindole 2 by Stille cross-coupling in a mixture of toluene and dimethylformamide (DMF), using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as a catalyst. The obtained compound 6 was then alkylated by quaternization of the nitrogen atoms with hexadecyl iodide in nitromethane to produce the diindolium iodide salt 7. Finally, commercially available 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole was reacted with a previously synthesized boronic ester derivative of indolenine (4) in Suzuki conditions to afford compound 8. An alkylation reaction was then performed in similar conditions than the previously employed one to form compound 9.
Synthesis of polymers
In order to investigate the influence of the electron-withdrawing/donating properties of heteroaromatic subunits in a π-conjugated backbone containing squaraine moieties, two different alternated π-conjugated polymers were synthesized from the dibromosquaraine 5 (Scheme 2). First, poly(squaraine-alt-thiophene) (PSQT-a) was prepared via a Stille polycondensation between the monomer 5 and commercially available 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene(0) in a mixture of 90% (vol) of degassed toluene and 10% (vol) of degassed DMF, using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) as a catalyst. It was reported that highly polar solvents such as DMF acted as coordination ligand on the catalytic system, thus improving the reaction yields and molecular weights.36 Its mixing in small proportions with toluene provides a better solubility of the reactants and formed products. Poly(squaraine-alt-benzothiadiazole) (PSQBT-a) was obtained by a Suzuki polycondensation of 5 with commercially available 4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole in a mixture of toluene and tetrahydrofuran (50/50 vol%), using the same catalyst and potassium carbonate in the aqueous phase. For both polycondensations, the ratio of monomers was 1:1 to reach the highest molecular weights.
 Scheme 2  Syntheses of poly(squaraine-alt-thiophene) and poly(squaraine-alt-benzothiadiazole) via Suzuki and Stille cross-coupling. 
Similar materials were obtained through a polycondensation process without the use of transition metal (Scheme 3). The previously prepared indolium derivatives 7 and 9 were reacted with squaric acid in a 1:1 molar ratio, using a mixture of toluene and 1-butanol to favor the formation of 1,3-isomers of squaraine subunits. Additionally, the use of quinoline in small amounts combined with an azeotropic removal of the produced water helped to afford the desired PSQT-b and PSQBT-b respectively.
 Scheme 3  Syntheses of poly(squaraine-alt-thiophene) and poly(squaraine-alt-benzothiadiazole) via metal-free polycondensations. 
The obtained materials were purified by Soxhlet extraction using methanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform (CHCl3) as described in experimental part. Molecular weights of the THF and CHCl3 fractions were measured by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using CHCl3 as an eluent (Table 1). As expected, the THF fractions corresponded to lower molecular weights than the CHCl3 ones. However, it appeared that the polycondensations of the diindolium derivatives 7 and 9 with squaric acid lead to polymers with longer chain lengths than their analogues obtained by Stille or Suzuki polycondensations, which provides an additional advantage of this type of reaction for the synthesis of π-conjugated polymers. The increase of the chain length was particularly remarkable in the case of benzothiadiazole-based monomer 9. This was attributed to an activation of the deprotonation step on the indolium moieties due to a stabilization of the generated negative charges by the electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole core. Moreover, the selective formation of 1,3-connections in the case of PSQT-b and PSQBT-b was confirmed by the absence or near absence of peaks corresponding to carbonyl functions in the 1680–1840 cm−1 region in the infra-red absorption spectra.37

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) performed on the highest molecular weight fractions showed good thermal stability with decomposition temperatures ranging from 346 to 353 °C, as well as glass transition temperatures ranging from 20 to 26 °C. As commonly observed in the case of alternated π-conjugated polymers, such materials are amorphous. All TGA and DSC data are available in ESI.†

All the polymers showed a very pronounced red-shift when compared to the single squaraine monomer 5, confirming the extended conjugation. A similar effect was observed in the homopolysquaraine developed by Lambert and co-workers,24 indicating that the π-electrons delocalization along several squaraine dyes was mainly responsible for this red-shift. When comparing the reported bridged polysquaraines in the literature with the non-bridged polymer of Lambert and coll., a strong blue-shift of the UV-visible absorption was observed (shift of λmax between 50 and 124 nm).28,32 Here the absorptions were only slightly blue-shifted (shift of λmax between 6 and 22 nm). This could be attributed to a decrease in the steric hindrance generated by the bridging units, thus reducing the dihedral angle between repeating units and increasing the planarity of the backbone. The thiophene unit is expected to induce less steric hindrance than the benzothiadiazole which is linked through a phenyl ring. Hence, the absorption maxima of the corresponding polymers in solution are shifted to longer wavelength when the steric effect is reduced (λPSQBTmax < λPSQTmax). Additionally, no strong differences were observed in the absorption spectra between polymers prepared by Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions and the ones obtained via metal-free polycondensation with squaric acid. While this is contradictory with the observation of high molecular weights polysquaraine in the case of metal-free polycondensation, one can argue that the maximum extent of conjugation was already reached in the shorter polymer chains obtained via metal-catalyzed couplings.
Spin-coated films of the materials showed a bathochromic shift of their absorption (see ESI† for details), in addition to a broadening of the peaks. The PSQs were found to have optical band-gap values around 1.6 eV (calculated from the onset of absorption in solid state), which will be compared later with cyclic voltammetry measurements. As the absorption spectra look quite similar, it can be concluded that no (or weak) intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) involving the bridging unit takes place, whether the bridging unit is electron-donating or withdrawing.
After we have checked that we obtained similar emission spectra whatever the excitation wavelengths (i.e. 650 nm to 720 nm), PL spectra were recorded with λexcitation a 650 nm (see Fig. 2). The small Stokes shift values, which correspond to the difference between the absorption and emission maxima, could be explained by small structural differences between the ground and excited state in the polysquaraines. It is noteworthy that PSQT-a presented the most red-shifted spectrum.

Electrochemical characterizations
Cyclic voltammetry measurements (CV) were performed in order to determine the HOMO and LUMO levels positions along with the electrochemical band gap of the various polysquaraines. Data are gathered in Table 3 (see ESI† for more details). CV was carried out on 0.1 g l−1 solutions of the materials in CHCl3, using TBAPF6 as electrolyte, silver wire as reference electrode and platinum for the working and counter-electrodes.

Two reversible oxidation peaks could be identified, as already reported for similar conjugated polymers,24 corresponding to the formation of dicationic species. However, the reduction showed only one irreversible peak. The differences between electrochemical and optical band-gaps were explained by localized reduction and oxidation sites in the π-conjugated backbone.
A preliminary study was performed in order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of PSQBT materials. Bulk heterojunction solar cell devices were fabricated and evaluated with different ratio between PSQBT and PCBM. Unfortunately, first tests were not satisfactory. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) was obtained when the blend was composed of 10 wt% of PSQBT reaching 0.4% (see ESI† for more preliminary results). These materials need further optimization to be used in OPV devices.
Conclusion
In this work we successfully synthesized small or low band-gap π-conjugated polymers based on squaraines units alternated with thiophene or benzothiadiazole moieties. We first carried out typical Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions conditions, then for the sake of comparison we achieved a metal-free polycondensation reaction involving squaric acid. Interestingly, the metal-free polymerization led to higher molecular weights polysquaraines than the classical cross coupling reactions (Suzuki and Stille). Moreover, it paves the way for environment friendly routes towards π-conjugated (co)polymers with higher purity, which is crucial for optoelectronic applications.
The materials demonstrated light absorption and emission in the red-near IR. It appears that the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing character of the bridging unit (thiophene or benzothiadiazole) between squaraine moieties is of small influence on the optical properties. Instead, the steric hindrance seems to be the driving parameter in this case. Electrochemical measurements confirmed narrow band-gap materials, as well as suitably located HOMO and LUMO levels for further photovoltaic applications. Preliminary studies on polymers:PCBM blends (fluorescence quenching and surface morphology of the blends) show encouraging results for future utilization of these materials as donor in the active layer of bulk heterojunction solar cells. Further characterizations, such as measurements of the charge carrier mobility, are in progress.
More importantly, this work opens the way to easy processable, metal-free and more environmental-friendly π-conjugated polymers, which remain the issues and challenges in the coming next years in the field of energy transition.
