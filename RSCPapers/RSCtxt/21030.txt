    , Accepted 5th November 2017First published on 6th November 2017AbstractThis study reported a hierarchically ordered porous Ni-based cathode of a solid oxide electrolysis cell to realise stable CO2 electrolysis without the need of safe gas. The Ni/(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92 (YSZ) cathode support has a microchannel structure, which enabled efficient catalyst delivery to the reaction zone between the cathode and the electrolyte and resulted in facilitated gas diffusion through straight channels instead of the tortuous pores intrinsic to conventional porous electrodes. A catalyst network covering a Ni/YSZ scaffold reduced electrode polarisation resistance, prevented carbon formation and suppressed Ni oxidation. The facilitated gas diffusion diminished or eliminated concentration polarisation and carbon formation due to CO accumulation in the reaction zone. The novel hierarchical structure enables stable CO2 electrolysis over conventional Ni-based cathodes with low capital and operational costs.
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have attracted intensive research interest as energy conversion devices to store renewable energy in the form of fuels.1 For example, renewable energy (such as solar and wind power) drives CO2 electrolysis via SOECs, and CO2 is split into oxygen and CO; the latter is an industrial feedstock for fuel or chemical production;2–4 CO2 acts as an energy carrier instead of a menace to the planetary climate.5 Currently, the most promising cell configuration is where a Ni-based cermet supports a thin electrolyte film to reduce cell resistance. The cheap Ni-based electrodes also have high chemical stability and catalytic activity for electrode reactions. However, the Ni-base cathodes have two problems in the CO2 electrolysis: carbon formation and Ni oxidation.6–9
Whilst Ni is a good catalyst for CO2 reduction, it can also disproportionate CO via the Boudouard reaction of 2CO → CO2 + C, with the formed carbon covering the Ni surface and deactivating the Ni catalyst, with the carbon formation occurring at high CO concentrations.7 The CO2 reduction takes place near the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte, where carbon formation can readily occur due to localised high CO concentrations.10 The produced CO is released by diffusion through the cathode support via connected pores. Therefore, when the pore structure of cathodes restricts CO diffusion, this greatly favours carbon formation and severely limits performance.6
Applying nanocatalysts within the electrodes can be an effective way to remove carbon or improve coking resistance.11 For example, Sm-doped ceria has been coated within the anodes of solid oxide fuel cells fuelled with methane.12 However, difficulties lie in the delivery of these catalysts to the reacting interface through the porous supporting electrodes. Infiltrating a catalyst into supporting electrodes can cause inhomogeneous distribution of the catalyst within the electrode, and catalyst particles readily accumulate near the electrode surface.13 Therefore, the pore structure of the cathode support also influences catalyst delivery and hence carbon formation.
To prevent Ni from being oxidised by CO2,9 a reducing gas (e.g. CO or hydrogen), also called safe gas,14,15 is required in the feed gas, which increases capital and operating costs and SOEC stack complexity.16,17 Moreover, the reducing gas also increases the cell open circuit potential, which results in increased power being required to overcome the potential during electrolysis.9,16 The addition of CO in the feed gas increases CO concentration within the cathode and hence promotes carbon formation. Therefore, it is significant to be able to eliminate reducing gas in the feed gas in terms of reducing cost and improving cell performance stability. Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of noble metals into the Ni catalyst suppressed Ni oxidation because of the high catalytic activity or H2 spillover from the noble metal to the formed Ni alloy.18,19 Therefore, applying a catalyst is a feasible method of removing the need for a safe gas in CO2 electrolysis.
Thus, catalysts and the cathode pore structure play critical roles in enabling the use of cheap Ni-based cathodes in CO2 electrolysis without safe gas. However, conventional porous support cathodes cannot meet the requirements of rapid gas diffusion and efficient catalyst delivery to the reacting interface due to the high tortuosity of pores within conventional electrodes.20
We have invented a novel microchanneled membrane for oxygen separation from air with high oxygen fluxes owing to fast gas diffusion,21 and the microchannel structure has been used in the support electrodes of solid oxide cells.22,23 In this communication, we report a hierarchically ordered porous Ni/(Y2O3)0.08(ZrO2)0.92 (YSZ) cathode support for SOECs using the microchanneled membranes as cathode supports. As shown in Fig. 1, numerous parallel microchannels traverse the cathode support with one open end and another end terminating with a thin porous layer. Accordingly, the integrated structure shows dual pore size distributions: an average channel size of 34.5 μm in diameter and an average small pore size of 0.29 μm in diameter (see Fig. S1†). The thin porous layer supports the electrolyte film and acts as a cathode functional layer for conducting CO2 reduction. The Ni/YSZ scaffold of the functional layer was covered with a Pd/Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC) catalyst nanonetwork. The 1 mm-thick cathode support includes a cathode functional layer with a thickness of 100–200 μm, and the thicknesses of the YSZ electrolyte and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 (LSCF)/GDC anode are about 20 and 35 μm, respectively (see Fig. S2†). The porosity of the functional layers is 34.9%. The hierarchically ordered porous structure of the cathode ensures stable CO2 electrolysis without safe gas.

Infiltration is an effective way to coat nanocatalysts on porous electrode scaffolds.24 However, the efficiency is greatly decreased as the electrodes become thick as is the case for supporting electrodes. In the preparation of conventional porous electrodes, pore formers (e.g. starch) are added to increase cathode porosity while particulate pore formers template pores with low connectivity and the resulting tortuous pore channels greatly increase the difficulty of catalyst precursor solution delivery,25 as illustrated in Fig. 2. The catalyst solution needs to transfer through tortuous channels to the reaction zone near the cathode/electrolyte interface, where CO2 reduction occurs. In contrast, the catalyst solution can easily reach the reaction zone through the fast pathway provided by the straight channels. The microchannel structure ensures a high efficiency of the infiltration process on the thick supporting cathodes.
 Fig. 2  Schematic comparison of catalyst delivery through a conventional porous cathode support and the microchanneled cathode support. 
To confirm the effect of microchannel structure on the catalyst delivery, cathodes with and without channels were prepared for comparison, and the same infiltration process was used to coat the Pd/GDC catalyst. The catalyst loading of the cathode with channels is three times that of the cathode without channels (3 wt% vs. 1 wt%) though the two cathodes have similar porosities.23 The catalyst delivery efficiency affects CO2 electrolysis performance. As shown in Fig. 3, at a current density of 0.5 A cm−2, the initial applied cell potentials are 1.2 V and 1.3 V for the cells with and without channels, respectively. The difference is attributed to the lower polarisation resistance of the cell with channels compared with that of the cell without channels, caused by different catalyst effects. During 20 h of operation, the applied potential of the cell with channels increased by 0.1 V while there was a double increase of 0.2 V for the applied potential of the cell without channels, which is attributed to a larger increase of cell polarisation resistance of the cell without channels. The polarisation resistance increase might be caused by catalyst aggregation and/or carbon formation. A nanocatalyst network was formed over the scaffold surface of the cathode with channels while the network was partially formed in the cathode without channels due to the low efficiency of catalyst delivery (see Fig. S3†). The catalyst nanostructure difference can cause different resistances to catalyst aggregation and carbon formation.
 Fig. 3  CO2 electrolysis performance over Ni/YSZ cathode supports with and without channels: (a) applied potential at 0.5 A cm−2 over initial 20 hours; and (b) cell resistance at the OCV (about 0.68 V) in CO2. Anodes were sintered at 1050 °C. 
In addition, carbon formation is also affected by gas diffusion. Our previous study has demonstrated that the microchannel structure can eliminate concentration polarisation during steam electrolysis.23 As both cells were operated at the same current density of 0.5 A cm−2, the CO concentrations at the cathode/electrolyte interface are roughly the same. At the equilibrium state, the CO concentrations at the outer surfaces of both cathodes are also the same. The cathode pore structure causes different CO concentration profiles within the cathode (see Fig. S4†). Fast CO diffusion can be achieved through channels, indicating a low CO concentration gradient along the channels. Accordingly, there is a drastic CO concentration decrease from the cathode/electrolyte interface at the bottom of the channels, which diminishes carbon formation because the Boudouard reaction (2CO → CO2 + C) only occurs at high ratios of CO/CO2. However, the CO concentration within the cathode without channels decreases away from the interface only gradually, which promotes carbon formation at the cathode/electrolyte interface (reaction zone). This carbon formation was confirmed by SEM imaging of the interface after electrolysis (see Fig. S5†), which was covered by carbon fibres. In contrast, the interface of the cell with the microchanneled cathode shows a clean interface covered by the catalyst network as before the test.
The Pd/GDC composite catalyst was selected in order to achieve both coking resistance and Ni oxidation suppression. GDC has oxygen ionic conductivity, which helps to remove carbon species and improve resistance to carbon formation; Pd is supported on Ni particles to suppress Ni oxidation. Additionally, the use of the composite improves catalyst dispersion. Without using GDC, the Pd catalyst readily aggregated (see Fig. S6†). Moreover, the Pd/GDC composite greatly extends the three-phase-boundary (TPB) where reaction occurs (CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−). In the Ni/YSZ cathode, the TPB is constructed by Ni and YSZ particles at the micron scale, and it becomes nano-sized when the Pd/GDC nanocatalyst is applied on the Ni/YSZ scaffold (see Fig. S7†). Pd acts as an electronic conductor and GDC is an oxygen ionic conductor, and the composite is a mixed conductor to construct the TPB at the nanoscale. Therefore, a hierarchical structure of the TPB was formed.
To confirm the effect of the composite catalyst, a comparison of CO2 electrolysis performance was made on the Ni/YSZ cathodes without any catalyst and with Pd and Pd/GDC catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4, without any catalyst, the cell potential increased rapidly, and there is a sharp increase up to above 2 V after 12 h, which is caused by the increased cell resistances. The increase of both ohmic resistance and polarisation resistance indicates Ni oxidation. The cell with catalysts showed lower initial potentials because of the lower cell polarisation resistances. The initial potential of the cell with the Pd catalyst is lower than that of the cell with the Pd/GDC catalyst while it increases at a higher rate, indicating Pd catalyst particle aggregation. After operation for 27 h, the cell potential increased sharply with the increase of ohmic resistance to similar levels of the cell without any catalyst. In contrast, the cell with the Pd/GDC catalyst shows a reasonable degradation rate. Moreover, the cell ohmic resistance did not increase, suggesting that the Pd/GDC catalyst suppressed Ni oxidation.

A further test to confirm the suppression of Ni oxidation was undertaken. A cell with the Pd/GDC catalyst was performing CO2 electrolysis for 116 h, and then hydrogen was introduced into the cathode while stopping electrolysis and CO2 feeding. After reduction for 2 hours, the cell ohmic resistance did not decrease, while the cell polarisation resistance increased (see Fig. S8†), which confirms that the Pd/GDC catalyst suppressed Ni oxidation. The reason that the polarisation resistance increases might be attributed to a change in the Ni surface in the strong reducing atmosphere (see Fig. S9†). During CO2 electrolysis, the Ni surface was porous due to redox processes, while the surface became smooth after it was fully reduced, resulting in the increased polarisation resistance.
The stability of CO2 electrolysis over the hierarchically ordered cathode was studied at an applied current density of 0.5 A cm−2. As shown in Fig. 5, cell passivation mainly occurred within the initial 100 h, as reported in a previous study.26 It was due to the increased cell resistance, which might be related to the structural stabilisation of the electrode and catalyst. After 100 h, the cell potential became stable and decreased slightly at some points. Correspondingly, the cell resistance was stable or decreased slightly. Thus, the hierarchically ordered cathode demonstrated stable performance in CO2 electrolysis.

Conclusions
In summary, a hierarchically ordered porous cathode structure has been developed for conducting CO2 electrolysis. Microchannels assembled within the cathode support facilitated both catalyst delivery to the cathode reaction zone and gas diffusion between the cathode surface and the reaction zone; the efficient catalyst coating via infiltration formed a Pd/GDC catalyst nanonetwork on the Ni/YSZ scaffold, which prevented carbon formation and suppressed Ni oxidation. As a result, this novel cathode has demonstrated a stable performance in CO2 electrolysis without the need for safe gas.
