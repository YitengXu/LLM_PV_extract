    , Accepted 16th July 2019First published on 17th July 2019AbstractWe report here resistive switching memory characteristics of imidazolium lead iodide depending on the molar ratio of PbI2 to imidazolium iodide (ImI), that is, PbI2:ImI = 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 0:1. X-ray diffraction confirms that the stoichiometric composition results in a hexagonal structure of (Im)PbI3, showing a one-dimensional face-sharing [PbI3−] chain. Bipolar resistive switching characteristics are observed regardless of the mixing ratio, where the forming process is required prior to SET and RESET processes at around +0.2 V and −0.2 V, respectively. The ON/OFF ratio is increased from 106 to 109 as the ImI content is increased due to the increased HRS associated with the pronounced insulating characteristics by ImI, whereas, the stoichiometric (Im)PbI3 exhibits 5 times longer endurance (103) and an order of magnitude longer retention time (104 s) as compared to other compositions. Multilevel data storage capability is confirmed by changing the compliance current. The low resistance state (LRS) and the high resistance state (HRS) are associated with Ohmic conduction and Schottky conduction, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the defect formation energy of iodine vacancy is estimated to be low indicating that (Im)PbI3 has a sufficient concentration of iodide vacancy for filament formation. Further energy barrier calculations show that iodide migration preferentially occurs along the 1-dimensional [234] crystallographic direction rather than the interlayer [130] direction. A good performance of the (Im)PbI3-based memristor is thus related to the low defect formation energy of iodide vacancy and the preferential growth of the filament along the 1-dimensional chain.
Introduction
Since the first report on solid-state perovskite solar cells based on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite in 2012,1 the explosive growth of perovskite photovoltaics is sustained and as a result, a power conversion efficiency exceeding 23% has been demonstrated.2 Opto-electronic properties and crystal structures of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have been intensively studied to understand the unprecedentedly superb photovoltaic performance. While investigating the intrinsic properties, ion migration has been argued to explain the photocurrent–voltage hysteresis.3–5 The dominant defects in MAPbI3 were reported to be related to the Schottky defect due to a stoichiometric amount of anion and cation vacancies,6 which implies that ion migration could be mediated by vacancies. This actually provides a clue to resistive switching application and the first attempt showed a high ON/OFF ratio of over 107 and millivolt switching property of MAPbI3.7,8 Further study discovered a fast switching time of 200 ns and a long retention time of 105 s.9 Studies on nonvolatile resistive memory are extended to bromide-based perovskites such as MAPbBr310 and CsPbBr311 and non-Pb materials such as A3Bi2I9 (A = Rb or Cs).12
While studying the resistive switching property with 3-dimensional (3D) perovskites, a low-dimensional perovskite or pseudo perovskite was investigated, where the resistive switching behavior was found to be strongly dependent on dimensionality. For instance, the SET voltage was lowered and the ON/OFF ratio was increased when the dimensionality changed from 3D to 2D in BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 (BA = C4H9NH3).13 The higher Schottky barrier height and activation energy were interpreted to be responsible for the higher ON/OFF ratio in the 2D material. It was observed that 1D hexagonal FAPbI3 (FA = HC(NH2)2) was better than 3D trigonal FAPbI3 in terms of endurance and switching voltage.14 Density functional theory calculation could explain the better performance of the 1D structure with the anisotropic ion migration barrier. The reports on low dimensional perovskite or perovskite-related materials provide new insight into the fact that their resistive switching memory is potentially superior to 3D structured materials, which motivates us to further investigate the effects of low dimensionality on the resistive switching properties.
Materials for a memristor are in general required to satisfy endurance long enough for repeated switching, high ON/OFF ratio for multi-level storage, and long-lasting retention for non-volatility and fast switching speed. Rapid forming and rupturing of the conducting filament is a prerequisite for fulfilling these properties. We have considered that defect-mediated vacancy movement may be accelerated in the presence of molten salt because of the pseudo liquid phase in the solid state matrix. Since molten salt or ionic liquid is defined to be a liquid electrolyte,15 molten salt will be helpful for the iodide in the 2D plane or the 1D chain, being in contact with molten salt, to migrate. Thus, we have designed a low dimensional matrix with an ionic liquid. In this work, imidazolium iodide (ImI; C3H5IN2) is selected as the ionic liquid, which is mixed with PbI2. The effect of the mixing ratio of ImI to PbI2 on the resistive switching property is investigated. We have found that an equimolar ratio, that is PbI2:ImI = 1:1, exhibits the best memristive performance as compared to excess ImI or PbI2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies are performed to understand the structural change with the mixing ratio. Density functional theory calculation is also carried out to explain the resistive switching data.
Results and discussion
Thin films with different mixing ratios of xPbI2:yImI, where x:y = 1:0 (pure PbI2), 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 0:1 (pure ImI), are deposited on a Pt substrate using the spin-coating method. For resistive switching studies, the Ag electrode is used. The PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) layer is over-coated on the thin film to protect the film from moisture while measuring the current–voltage. In Fig. 1, the device structure is schematically illustrated, along with the chemical structure of ImI. The color of the film with x:y = 1:0 (pure PbI2) is greenish due to the absorption edge of around 510 nm,16 which changes slightly depending on the mixing ratio, except for the colorless pure ImI (x:y = 0:1). This is indicative of the formation of compounds by the reaction of PbI2 with ImI. It is noted that the pure ImI film is hard to form a smooth surface.

Fig. 2(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the films depending on the mixing ratio, along with a powdered sample with a stoichiometric ratio of x:y = 1:1. For the pure PbI2 (x:y = 1:0), strong peaks at 12.66°, 25.50° and 38.68° correspond to (001), (002) and (003) reflections, respectively, which is indicative of preferential orientation with the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate.16 When reacting PbI2 with ImI (x:y = 1:0.5 and 1:1), the intensity of the (001) peak is significantly diminished and new peaks appear. Moreover, the PbI2 (001) peaks disappear completely upon excess addition of ImI (x:y = 1:2 and 1:3 cases). Pure ImI (x:y = 0:1) shows different XRD patterns due to the trigonal structure with the space group of R3 (),17 where peaks at 16.98°, 22.50° and 25.60° are indexed to be (101), (2−10) and (10−2) reflections, respectively. For the stoichiometric thin film sample of x:y = 1:1, its XRD pattern is identical with that of the powdered sample. The crystal structure is analyzed by a hexagonal unit cell with a space group of P63/m, where the cell parameters are determined to be a = b = 15.6310 Å ± 0.0004, c = 7.9893 Å ± 0.0002, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. The calculated XRD pattern is depicted in Fig. 2(b) and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The XRD pattern of the stoichiometric sample is coincident with the data reported elsewhere,18,19 where imidazolium lead iodide (Im)PbI3 was crystallized to the 1D structure with face-sharing [PbI3−] chains. For the excess ImI cases, a new peak at 13.64° is detected along with the reduced (Im)PbI3 (110) peak for x:y = 1:2 and a new strong peak at 9.6° appears in the absence of the (Im)PbI3 (110) peak for x:y = 1:3. This indicates that excess ImI might lead to new phases different from the ImI deficient case (x:y = 1:0.5) showing a mixed phase of PbI2 and (Im)PbI3.

In Fig. 3, the crystal structure of the stoichiometric sample (Im)PbI3, obtained based on crystallographic data,18 is displayed, where the 1D chain structure is well developed along the c-axis. The face-sharing [PbI3−] chains are separated by randomly oriented imidazolium cations.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the (Im)PbI3 film in Fig. 4(a) shows that pinhole-free (Im)PbI3 forms on the Pt substrate with a grain size of about 100–150 nm. The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. 4(b) confirms that the (Im)PbI3 film has a uniform and pinhole-free morphology with a thickness of 220 nm. The thickness of the PMMA layer on the (Im)PbI3 film is about 4 nm, which is uniformly covered on the (Im)PbI3 film and thus expected to protect moisture efficiently.20,21 The surface roughness of the film is important because it is related to the contact interface associated with a reliable and reproducible result, where a surface roughness of less than 10% of the film thickness was recommended in order to ensure smooth mechanical and electrical contact.22 The surface roughness is estimated to be around 7 nm for both the bare (Im)PbI3 film and the PMMA-coated (Im)PbI3 film using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in Fig. 4(c), which seems to be suitable for the prerequisite.

Fig. 5 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of Ag/PMMA/xPbI2 + yImI/Pt devices. To prevent a breakdown of the device, a compliance current of 10−3 A is applied. Bipolar resistive switching characteristics are observed regardless of the mixing ratio. The SET voltage (VSET) was firstly applied to 1 V because the forming process occurs near 1 V for all the compositions even for pure PbI2 and ImI and then a reduced VSET of around 0.2 V is repeatedly observed. The RESET voltage (VRESET) occurs at around −0.2 V. Thus, we repeatedly apply 0.5 V and −0.5 V for the I–V measurement after an initial 1 V for the forming step. Among the studied compositions, SET and RESET take consistently place for the stoichiometric composition of x:y = 1:1.

We also investigated the endurance of the device as shown in Fig. 6. The endurance is measured by applying a repetitive DC voltage pulse (pulse width of 1 ms) under VSET = 0.3 V, VRESET = −0.8 V and read voltage (Vread) = +0.02 V. Both PbI2 (x:y = 1:0) and ImI (x:y = 0:1) films exhibit poor endurance less than 70 cycles, where it is noted that a higher VRESET of −0.8 V is applied rather than −0.5 V in order to force rupturing the filament completely. This indicates that pure PbI2 and ImI are hard to be tolerant in switching. Endurance is enhanced after mixing two compounds, where more than 103 cycles are observed for the stoichiometric composition of x:y = 1:1. A mixture of ImI or PbI2 leads to an improved endurance as compared to pure PbI2 and ImI, which is however inferior to (Im)PbI3. It is noted that a high resistance state (HRS) is more fluctuating than a low resistance state (LRS) (see Fig. 6(c)), which is similarly observed in a previous report12 and indicates that the rupture of conducting filaments is not completed and some residual filaments might be present in the (Im)PbI3 layer leading to a reduced HRS.23

The insets in (a) and (f) show switching cycles less than 100 for pure PbI2 and ImI. 

Fig. 7 compares the retention property to verify that the devices work properly as non-volatile memory at a reading voltage of 0.02 V. To measure the retention time of the ON state at the LRS, a reading bias of 0.02 V is constantly applied at intervals of 10 s after changing the state from the HRS to LRS. The opposite procedure is performed to measure the retention time of the OFF state at the HRS. Pure PbI2 shows a retention time less than 100 s with an ON/OFF ratio of about 106 (Fig. 7(a)), while the sample with x:y = 1:0.5 improves the retention time to over 500 s but with unstable ON and OFF states (Fig. 7(b)). The retention time is significantly improved to 10000 s for the x:y = 1:1 case (Fig. 7(c)), along with fairly stable ON and OFF states and with the ON/OFF ratio as high as 107. An excess ImI decreases the retention time to less than 1000 s with an unstable OFF state (Fig. 7(d) and (e)). However, the ON/OFF ratio is substantially increased up to >109 for x:y = 1:3. When considering that the ON state is stabilized at 102 Ω regardless of the molar ratio, the increase in the ON/OFF ratio is due to the increased HRS at the OFF state for the excess ImI. This may be related to materials property such as the degree of insulating characteristics depending on the composition. Since PbI2 has a relatively higher electrical conductivity than ImI, an increase in the insulating ImI content is therefore expected to decrease the conductivity, leading to a higher HRS at the OFF state. The fast cation conducting property in ImI might contribute in part to hindering electrical conduction.24 A two orders higher HRS of 1010 Ω for pure ImI (Fig. 7(f)) than that of 108 Ω for pure PbI2 is clear evidence to explain the increased ON/OFF ratio upon increasing the ImI content. The change in the ON/OFF ratio with ImI is represented in Fig. 8 in order to show the dependence of the ImI content on the ON/OFF ratio, where the data are statistically analyzed using 10 cells for each composition.

Small bars at the top and bottom mean the maximum and minimum values and the square box is the range of 80% of the total value. In addition, the line in the box represents an average value and a small square on the range means an intermediate value. 
Multilevel storage capability is investigated by changing the compliance current at the SET process from 10−2 A to 10−3 A, 10−4 A and 10−5 A for the (Im)PbI3 film. Fig. 9(a) shows that the SET current level (LRS level) is divided without changing the HRS current. As the compliance current increases from 10−5 to 10−2 A, the RESET voltage increases from −0.1 V to −0.3 V due to probably thicker filaments formed in the SET process. In Fig. 9(b), the distribution of multilevel is shown as a function of writing cycles. ON/OFF is well performed at each level except for the compliance current of 10−5 A due to an unstable HRS state. The stability of the (Im)PbI3 based memristor is investigated under 50% relative humidity and at ∼22 °C for 5 days. Fig. 9(c) confirms that the device looks to be quite stable but there is a gradual decrease in the SET and RESET voltages. The gradual decrease in the SET and RESET voltages with aging time might be attributed to an underlying modification of the effective electric field in the presence of moisture in an ambient atmosphere.25 The (Im)PbI3 memristor demonstrates reliable ON and OFF states as confirmed by the switching test with 50 different cells in a device (Fig. 9(d)), where the average ON/OFF ratio is determined to be 4.6 × 106. To confirm the device-to-device reliability, I–V data are measured using 10 different devices. Fig. 9(e) shows that almost similar I–V curves are observed in terms of the ON/OFF ratio and SET/RESET voltage, which is conformed from the statistical SET/RESET voltage plot in Fig. 9(f).

To understand whether the switching mechanism obeys electrochemical metallization (ECM) or the valence change mechanism (VCM), we first investigated the I–V characteristics using the Au top electrode instead of the Ag one. Fig. 10(a) shows that resistive switching is observed even in the presence of the Au electrode, which is indicative of the VCM.23 Forming occurs at 1.6 V, which is higher than the forming voltage of less than 1 V for the Ag electrode cell. The difference of forming voltage may be caused by the initial amount of vacancies in (Im)PbI3 depending on the top electrode. Since Ag has a lower standard electrode potential (E° (Ag+/Ag) = 0.7993 V) than Au (E° (Au+/Au) = 1.69 V)26 and Au is an electrochemically less active metal than Ag,27 Ag is more easily oxidized at a given bias voltage. Thus, the oxidized Ag may migrate into (Im)PbI3 through PMMA so AgI and iodine vacancy can be formed in (Im)PbI3.28 However, for the Au electrode case, a less inactive Au may lead to a lower iodine vacancy, which requires a higher forming voltage.23 After the forming step, SET and RESET occur at 0.2 V and at −0.25 V, respectively, which is similar to those for the Ag electrode cells although switching cycles are not as good as the Ag case. In Fig. 10(b), theI–V curves are replotted with respect to the logarithmic scale to understand the current conduction mechanisms. The data for the LRS are fitted to the linear line with a slope of 0.99, which implies that the conduction mechanism is related to ohmic-like conduction.8,29 The Ohmic conduction is clearly confirmed from the linear relation between current and voltage in Fig. 10(c). On the other hand, the current is hard to depend on the applied voltage for the HRS, which underlines that other conduction mechanisms are likely to be involved. We re-plotted the current of the logarithmic scale for the HRS with respect to V1/2 and it is well plotted, which means that the conduction mechanism for the HRS corresponds to the Schottky conduction mechanism (Fig. 10(d)). In Schottky conduction, the current density obeys eqn (1),30 (1)where J is the current density, A* is the effective Richardson constant, T is the absolute temperature, qϕB is the Schottky barrier height, E is the electric field, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity, and k is the Boltzmann's constant. With respect to the Schottky conduction mechanism, the deep work function of the Pt electrode may cause a schottky barrier at the interface between Pt and (Im)PbI3.12 Electrons which overcome the Shottky barrier by thermal energy due to the electric field can make current flow.31 The Schottky conduction mechanism can be further verified by the temperature-dependent I–V properties. Thus, we measure the HRS depending on the temperature from 233 K to 313 K (Fig. 10(e)). As the temperature increases, resistance at the HRS decreases, which is indicative of an insulating or semiconducting behavior. Taking the natural logarithm of eqn (1), we obtain the following eqn (2): (2)

(e) I–V data depending on the temperature from 213 K to 333 K at HRS before the SET process. (f) Linear relationship between ln(I/T2) and 1/T. 
Therefore, ln(I/T2) is expected to be linearly proportional to 1/T at a given voltage. Fig. 10(f) shows a clearly linear dependence of ln(I/T2) o the inverse temperature at a reading voltage of 0.09 V, confirming the Schottky conduction mechanism of the HRS.
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to understand the memristor characteristics in a (Im)PbI3-based memristor. Since the filament formation of I vacancy  is often referred to as a physical origin for resistance switching,13,32–34 the formation energy and the migration behavior of  are investigated to understand the performance of the (Im)PbI3-based memristor. Fig. 11 shows the schematic view of the (Im)PbI3 that has a 6 formula unit in a unit cell. The unit cell is a hexagonal structure and the lattice parameters are a = 15.518, c = 7.941, α = 90°, and γ = 120°.18 As can be seen, the (Im)PbI3 is composed of pillars of face sharing PbI6 octahedra and ImI cations locating between the pillars. First, we look at the defect formation energy (DFE) of  in (Im)PbI3. Our DFT calculation predicts that the DFE of  is 0.19 eV for (Im)PbI3. Since the DFE of  for (Im)PbI3 is lower than other halide perovskites (MAPbI3 for 0.58 eV (ref. 35) and FAPbI3 for 0.39 eV (ref. 14)), the concentration of  should be sufficient to form the conducting filament in a (Im)PbI3-based memristor. We further perform the nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations to understand the migration barrier of . Since the structure of (Im)PbI3 is composed of face-sharing octahedral pillars, both intra-pillar and inter-pillar migration pathways are considered. Fig. 11(a) shows the schematic view of two different migration pathways of  in (Im)PbI3: [130], and [234]. Two different migrations along the [130] direction represent the formation of the filament along the direction parallel to the ab-plane. On the other hand, the migration of  along the [234] direction represents the formation of filament along the c-axis. Fig. 11(b) shows the relative energy profile along three different migration pathways. As can be seen, the migration of  shows a significant difference depending on three migration pathways in (Im)PbI3; the migration barrier of  is 0.48 eV for [130]intra, 1.01 eV for [130]inter, and 0.66 eV for [234] directions, respectively. Although the migration of  along the [130]intra direction has the lowest energy barrier, the filament formation along the ab-plane should be limited because of the highest migration barrier along the [130]inter direction. On the other hand, the migration barrier along the [234] direction is slightly higher than that along [130]intra so that the migration of  can occur. Thus, the good retention of the (Im)PbI3-based memristor may be the result of preferential formation of the filament. We note here that the slight energy difference between the initial and final state for the inter-pillar migration is related to the preferred molecular orientation in our static NEB calculation. The difference in the migration barrier can be understood by the face-sharing octahedron structure in (Im)PbI3. As can be seen from Fig. 11(a), two PbI6 octahedrons in (Im)PbI3 share three I anions along the c-axis. For the inter-pillar [130]inter migration of , the migration requires breaking of two Pb–I bonds. In contrast, the intra-pillar migration of  along [234] and [130]intra directions occurs by breaking only one Pb–I bond or without breaking Pb–I bonds. Thus, intra-pillar migration of  shows a much lower migration barrier and so the filament formation along the c-axis, which does not require the inter-pillar migration, is preferred. In summary, a good performance of the (Im)PbI3-based memristor can be understood by the low DFE of  in (Im)PbI3 and the preferential growth of the  filament along the c-axis.

Conclusion
We fabricated and studied the resistive switching behavior of imidazolium lead iodide with different mixing ratios between PbI2 and ImI. Among the studied compositions, stoichiometric (Im)PbI3 showed better endurance and retention characteristics. Other compositions with excess ImI or PbI2 demonstrated an inferior switching property, except for the ON/OFF ratio. Longer endurance and retention of the 1-dimensional hexagonal (Im)PbI3 might be related to the defect formation energy and anisotropic barrier energy for defect migration, associated with a well-defined pathway for forming and rupturing filaments. The dependence of defect migration on the crystal direction in (Im)PbI3 estimated from the DFT calculation could explain the best performance from stoichiometric (Im)PbI3 as compared to other non-stoichiometric compositions, which underlines that the switching property correlates with the crystal structure. This work can give important insights into switching memory materials that low-dimensional halide materials are beneficial for endurance and retention in the resistive switching process.
Experimental
Synthesis
Imidazolium iodide (C3H5IN2) was synthesized by reacting imidazole (5 g, 99%, Aldrich) with hydriodic acid (10 ml, 57 wt% in water, Aldrich) at 0 °C for 2 h under stirring. The white precipitate was collected by evaporation using a rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 1 h. The collected white precipitate was washed with diethyl ether three times and recrystallized in ethanol. This recrystallization process was repeated twice and then the product (C3H5IN2) was dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h.
Device fabrication
A 100 nm-thick Pt coated silicon wafer having a 15 mm × 15 mm dimension was successively cleaned by sonication in detergent, ethanol, acetone and then again ethanol for 15 min at each condition. The substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min prior to spin-coating. To prepare imidazolium lead iodide films with different molar ratios of PbI2 to ImI, x mmol of PbI2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9985%) was mixed with y mmol of the synthesized ImI, where x + y = 2 mmol. For instance, 2/3 mmol of PbI2 was mixed with 4/3 mmol of ImI for the PbI2:ImI = 1:2 case. The mixture was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent (1.48 mL) (Aldrich, 99.8%), where dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Aldrich, >99.9%) was included with the same molar ratio with PbI2 to induce the intermediate adduct phase. The resulting solution was spin-coated on a Pt-coated Si wafer at 4000 rpm for 20 s (acceleration = 1200 rpm). While spinning, diethyl ether (0.2 ml, 99%, Aldrich) was quickly added dropwise after spinning for 12 s. The obtained film was annealed at 125 °C for 10 min to eliminate the residual solvents. The film was cooled down to room temperature and then a solution of PMMA in chlorobenzene (2 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the film at 4000 rpm for 20 s (acceleration = 1200 rpm ).36 Then, the film was annealed again at 50 °C for 5 min. Finally, the Ag or Au electrode was deposited on top of the PMMA layer by thermal evaporation under 10−6 torr.
Characterization studies
Cross-sectional and surface images were investigated by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL, JSM7000F). The surface roughness was measured by using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (SPA-400 Seiko Instruments Inc.) under ambient conditions. XRD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku Smart Lab SE (40 kV, 40 mA) using graphite monochromated Cu-Kα radiation under ambient conditions at a scan rate of 2° min−1 and a two theta interval of 0.02°. The XRD pattern was analyzed using the EXPO2014 program to predict the space group,37 and the cell parameters were calculated by the Whole-Pattern Profile Matching method using the “WinProtr” program.38 All electrical properties were characterized by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parametric analyzer under 10−2 torr, where the I–V characteristics were determined by the direct voltage current sweeping mode. The endurance was evaluated by the consecutive DC voltage pulse with a 1 ms pulse width at VSET = 0.3 V and VRESET = −0.8 V, where the read voltage was 0.02 V.
DFT calculations
The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to understand the memristor characteristics of the (Im)PbI3 based memristor. The DFT calculations performed in this study were carried out using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method39 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for the exchange and correlation potential,40,41 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.42,43 A Monkhorst–Pack44k-point sampling was used with a 2 × 2 × 2 grid. We calculated the 12 formula unit supercell with a = 15.518, c = 15.882, α = 90°, and γ = 120° as the lattice parameters. The force convergence criterion in structure optimization was set to be 0.01 eV Å−1 with a kinetic energy cut-off of 400 eV. The nudged elastic band (NEB) method45 was used to calculate the migration barrier energy for vacancy migration in (Im)PbI3.
