At present, Cu-based electrocatalysts are the most promising for this purpose. However, critical challenges concerning their selectivity, stability and energy efficiency remain. Recently, some non-Cu-based electrocatalysts have been reported to exhibit excellent multi-carbon product selectivity at low overpotentials, and some are even able to produce multi-carbon molecules that were not detected on Cu-based electrodes. This sets a new direction in which novel non-Cu electrocatalysts could be explored. These recent advances are summarized in this review. We focus on the CO2RR to multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrodes in aqueous electrolytes under ambient conditions, with an emphasis on the C–C bond formation mechanisms. The current challenges and corresponding strategies for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products on non-Cu catalysts are also discussed.Yansong ZhouYansong Zhou received his BS degree (2012) and PhD degree (2018) from the Harbin Institute of Technology.

1. Introduction
Our global economy is largely powered by fossil fuels, whose usage and combustion inevitably lead to CO2 emissions. These emissions have been steadily rising, and have not been sufficiently abated through photosynthesis or dissolution into oceans and lakes. As a result, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased to above 410 ppm in 2020.1 This is already much higher than the assigned safety limit of 350 ppm and can trigger adverse environmental consequences such as global warming and ocean acidification.2–4 A sustainable approach to lower the CO2 emissions is to utilize them as a carbon source for making organic chemicals and transportation fuels.5–8 This thermodynamically uphill process can be driven by renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar farms.9,10 Thus, converting atmospheric CO2 to value-added products can be beneficial for both reducing our carbon footprint and shifting our dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energies. Among carbon capture and utilization strategies, the CO2RR using low-cost electricity from renewable sources has been demonstrated to be one of the most promising solutions due to its mild operating conditions and the variety of products that can be produced.11,12
Compounds with carbon chain lengths from C1 to C6 can be produced by the CO2RR depending on the catalyst being utilized.13–15 Relative to C1 products, multi-carbon products are more desirable because of their higher energy densities.16,17 To date, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to be the major group of catalysts to effectively drive the C–C coupling of CO2RR intermediates to form C2 and C3 hydrocarbons and oxygenates.18–20 However, the selectivity of Cu towards a certain product is typically poor – ∼20 reduction products have been detected.11,13,21 Moreover, the overpotentials required to produce hydrocarbons and oxygenates are usually high on most Cu catalysts. Therefore, more efforts have to be devoted to developing better electrocatalysts for efficient CO2 conversion to multi-carbon products.
Recently, many non-Cu materials such as N-doped graphene quantum dots22 have been found to be promising electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products with low overpotentials. Furthermore, multi-carbon products such as 2,3-furandiol,23 that have not been previously detected on Cu-based electrodes, have been produced from the CO2RR on non-Cu catalysts. The study of the CO2RR towards multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrocatalysts can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the C–C bond formation mechanisms and guide the development and design of efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts beyond Cu for future applications.
There are many reviews summarizing the progress made on Cu-based CO2RR electrocatalysts for producing multi-carbon molecules.12,19,24,25 Hence, in this review, we shall focus instead on non-Cu catalysts. We first summarize the possible C–C bond formation mechanisms in the CO2RR proposed so far. Current studies on non-Cu electrocatalysts for the CO2RR will then be summarized. The bottlenecks and future opportunities for the formation of C2+ products on non-Cu catalysts will also be discussed. This review focuses on the CO2RR process in aqueous solution under ambient conditions. The CO2RR in non-aqueous electrolytes or under elevated pressure will not be discussed here.
2. C–C coupling mechanisms in the CO2RR
The coupling of two C1 intermediates to form a C–C bond is the key step to produce multi-carbon products in the CO2RR. However, the high kinetic barriers of C–C coupling, in tandem with competing formation of C–H and scission of C–O, as well as the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction, make the selective formation of a target multi-carbon product challenging.26,27
Various C1 intermediates can be formed from CO2 (Fig. 1). A CO2 radical anion (*CO2˙−; * indicates the atom bound to the catalyst) is produced via a single-electron transfer process, which requires high energy input.28,29 In the presence of protons, C1 intermediates including *COOH, *COH, etc. are produced through proton-coupled electron transfer processes. Formaldehyde (HCHO) can be formed either through the protonation of the *CHO intermediate pathway30 or the formate intermediate pathway.23 At present, different C–C coupling mechanisms have been proposed to account for the formation of multi-carbon products from the CO2RR (Table 1 and Fig. 2). It should be noted that most of the current studies on the C–C coupling mechanisms of the CO2RR are conducted on Cu.

 Fig. 2  Schematic of possible C–C coupling reactions between two C1 intermediates for the CO2RR. 
2.1. CO2 radical anion dimerization (CO2˙−–CO2˙−)
The CO2 radical anion (CO2˙−) has been proposed to be a key intermediate for the direct CO2RR over post-transition electrodes. It has been demonstrated that the dimerization of the anion radical is fairly fast in N,N-dimethylformamide31 and aqueous media,28 with rates close to the diffusion limit. It is noteworthy that this mechanism is substantiated by the good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results for the CO2RR.32 Following this path, oxalate is the only multi-carbon product produced with a quantifiable faradaic efficiency on electrodes like Pb in non-aqueous electrolytes.29,33–36 Recently, the formation of acetate on N-doped nanodiamonds in an aqueous electrolyte (NaHCO3, 0.5 M) was also proposed to follow the CO2 radical anion dimerization mechanism.37
A free CO2 radical anion can be formed from the one-electron reduction of CO2 with a rather negative equilibrium potential of −1.90 V vs. NHE (pH = 0).10,38 As a result, the formation of oxalate through this pathway requires quite a large overpotential of nearly 1500 mV.39
2.2. Carbon monoxide dimerization (CO–CO)
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO on Cu electrodes gives similar product distributions as the CO2RR on Cu electrodes.40–42 Surface-bound CO has also been detected by in situ/operando spectroscopy during the CO2RR.43,44 Consequently, CO has been proposed as a key intermediate for different CO2RR products.45–47 The dimerization of *CO was proposed as the first step toward C2+ products on the Cu electrode.48–50 A direct detection of a hydrogenated CO dimer by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy further strengthened this hypothesis.51 *CO dimerization to *C2O2− was demonstrated to be the rate limiting step, while the further protonation of the CO dimer was rapid.48 Therefore, efforts have been devoted to tuning the properties of the electrocatalysts in order to lower the energy barrier required for the *CO dimerization step.52,53 Depending on the experimental conditions (e.g., electrolyte types, applied potentials, etc.), the intermediates are further selectively reduced to C2H4, C2H5OH, etc. Besides direct dimerization of two *CO species, it has been predicted that one *CO species can also couple with one free CO molecule to form a CO–CO dimer with a lower energy barrier on Pt nanoclusters at high CO coverage.54 The CO dimerization mechanism is also the most widely accepted coupling pathway for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products.
2.3. Formyl dimerization (CHO–CHO)
According to Peterson et al., using the computational hydrogen electrode model, the hydrogenation of the *CO to form adsorbed formyl (*CHO) is the key step in the formation of CH4 and C2H4 on the Cu(211) facet.46 Among the C–C coupling pathways to C2H4 (*CH2O + *CH2O → 2 O* + C2H4; *CHO + *OCH3 → 2 O* + C2H4; *CH2O + *CHO → *OCHCH2 + O* and *CHO + *CHO → *OCHCHO*), *CHO dimerization is suggested to be the most thermodynamically favorable.46 *CHO can be formed via *CO + *H → *CHO or *CO + H2O(aq) + e− → *CHO + OH(aq)−.55 On the Cu(100) facet, *CHO formation is preferred, and the coupling of two *CHO species to produce C2H4 occurs at relatively low overpotentials as compared to the *COH dimerization pathway favored on Cu(111).56
Recently, the hydrogenation of *CO to *CHO, with the subsequent *CHO dimerization to *OCHCHO* was proposed to be the more energetically favorable pathway over *CO dimerization for forming C2H4 on the Cu(111) facet.57
2.4. CO–CHO coupling
Garza et al.58 proposed that *COCHO from CO–CHO coupling is the key intermediate for forming C2 products and for determining the selectivity between C2H5OH and C2H4 on the Cu(100) facet. Goodpaster et al.55 also proposed that the protonation of *CO to *CHO, followed by its coupling with *CO to form *COCHO, was favored over the dimerization of two *CO species for the C–C bond formation at high overpotentials on the Cu(100) facet. However, compared to the exergonic process of *CHO dimerization on the Cu(111) facet,57 the coupling between *CHO and *CO species is much more difficult because of the uphill reaction on the Cu(100) facet. Similar to the *CO dimerization mechanism, the C–C bond formation from *CO–*CHO coupling satisfies the experimentally observed pH dependence.58 However, *CHO is preferentially reduced to CH4 over the *CO–*CHO coupling process on Cu.59 The coverage of *CO has significant effects on the competition between the further reduction of *CHO to CH4 and the coupling of *CO–*CHO. It has been suggested that a higher *CO coverage improves the selectivity of C2 products over CH4.60
2.5. CO–COH coupling
The C–C coupling may go through different reaction pathways depending on the pH values of the electrolyte.61 Goddard and co-workers proposed that while *CO dimerization on the Cu(111) occurs at high pH, C–C coupling is realized by a CO–COH pathway at pH = 7.62 Their calculations suggest that at this pH, the protonation of *CO to *COH is more favorable than to *CHO. The *COH can then couple with a *CO to give C2 products. This is because the *COH adsorbate is capable of acquiring a radical character that can reduce the *CO–*COH coupling energy barrier to 0.87 eV at U = 0 V, which is lower than the 1.15 eV barrier for the *CO dimerization pathway.62
2.6. Carbene mechanism (CH2–CH2 and CH2–CO coupling)
The hydroxycarbene intermediate, *CHOH, or atomic carbon dissociated from the *CO intermediate, can be formed during the CO2RR on Cu and N-doped carbon.40,63 These intermediates can be further reduced to carbene (*CH2) groups. The carbene species have been proposed to be a common intermediate for the formation of C2H4 and CH4.42,64 The coupling of *CH2 groups on the Cu surface produces C2 to C6 hydrocarbons.14,40 The *CH2 dimerization is also suggested to be the C–C bond formation step to produce C2H4 on Cu with high overpotentials.65 Furthermore, the carbene group has been proposed to couple with *CO to form *CH2CO intermediates. The *CH2CO can then be reduced to acetaldehyde, C2H4 and C2H5OH.42,63,66–68
2.7. Methyl mechanism (CH3–CH3 and CH3–CO2˙−)
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have suggested that *CH3 species are formed from the further reduction of *COH on Cu(111) during the CO2RR.69 In addition to being an intermediate for CH4 formation, *CH3 dimerization was also proposed as the pathway for the formation of C2H6 on Cu nanowire arrays.70 The experimental results using diacetyl [(CH3CO)2] as a *CH3 precursor further suggest that the dimerization of *CH3 is likely responsible for the formation of C2H6 on thick oxide-derived Cu surfaces.71
*CH3 can also be attacked by a CO2 species to form a C–C bond. In the case of acetic acid formation from the CH4/CO2 mixture, it has been reported that metal (e.g., Zn, Cu and Mn) sites can activate CH4 to form metal- (M–) methyl species (M–CH3). The M–C bond is then further coupled with a CO2 molecule to produce acetate species.72–75 For the CO2RR, a similar mechanism based on the dimerization between the radical anion CO2˙− and *CH3 was proposed for the formation of acetic acid on Cu-based electrocatalysts.76,77 In this mechanism, the *CH3 species can either combine with *CO2˙− nearby or undergo a nucleophilic attack by the free CO2˙− to generate acetic acid subsequently.76
2.8. Formaldehyde self-condensation (HCHO–HCHO)
The self-condensation of two formaldehyde molecules to form a C–C bond under mild conditions is energetically favorable with a standard Gibbs free energy of −25 kJ mol−1.23 In aqueous media, catalysts with Lewis acid sites can significantly catalyze formaldehyde self-condensation to form the C2 compound glycolaldehyde.78 The self-condensation of formaldehyde has been proposed as a C2+ formation mechanism on some non-Cu catalysts with Lewis acid sites.23,79 Based on DFT calculations, the condensation between CH2O* and free CH2O is energetically favorable as compared to the coupling of CH2O* and CO2 to form a C–C bond at the S-vacancies of MoS2.77
According to this mechanism, formaldehyde should therefore be detected as a CO2RR product. However, formaldehyde was seldom detected along with other multi-carbon products. Moreover, the electrochemical formaldehyde reduction experiments report negligible amounts of multi-carbon products under CO2RR conditions.59,80 Therefore, although it is energetically favorable, more comprehensive analysis is required when taking the self-condensation of formaldehyde as the C–C bond formation pathway in the CO2RR process.
At present, many C–C coupling mechanisms during the CO2RR have been proposed. These mechanisms are beneficial for understanding the C–C bond formation process on the microscopic level. However, most of them are proposed based on theoretical simulations with little experimental support. Therefore, more information on the adsorbed intermediates provided by advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques is vital to gain insights on the detailed mechanisms experimentally.
3. CO2RR to multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrocatalysts
Cu-based catalysts are the most effective for reducing CO2 to C2+ products. Specifically, they have exhibited outstanding selectivity with faradaic efficiencies ranging from 60% to 80% and current densities from tens to more than 1000 mA cm−2 for C2 products.81–85 However, some non-Cu electrocatalysts have also gained intensive research interest due to their advantages such as low overpotentials and high selectivity as compared to Cu-based electrocatalysts. In addition, multi-carbon products that are minor or not formed on Cu can be produced on some of these non-Cu electrocatalysts. In this section, we summarize recent advances on non-Cu electrocatalysts for multi-carbon products from the CO2RR in an aqueous electrolyte under ambient conditions. These electrocatalysts are divided into two groups: carbon-based electrocatalysts and metal-based electrocatalysts.
3.1. Carbon-based electrocatalysts
Carbon-based materials have been investigated as alternatives to metal electrocatalysts due to advantages such as their lower cost and excellent electroconductivity.27,86–88 Pure sp2 (e.g., single-layer graphene) or sp3 (e.g., diamond) carbon materials showed negligible CO2 reduction performance.89 To make the carbon materials catalytically active, doping strategies, including single-atom and dual-/multi-atom doping with different elements (e.g., N, S, P, B, etc.), are widely applied. Doping not only induces defects in the lattices to expose more active sites, but also modulates the electronic structures to boost the electrocatalytic activity.90 Compared to metal-based electrocatalysts, some doped-carbon materials have shown advantages in both activity and stability for the CO2RR to C1 products.91–94 Recent studies have also demonstrated that the modified carbon electrocatalysts can drive the CO2RR to multi-carbon products (Table 2).

3.1.1. Doped carbon electrocatalysts. 
N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) have been reported to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products (Fig. 3a).22 It is striking that when the applied potentials are more negative than −0.61 V vs. RHE, NGQDs favor catalyzing C–C bond formation to predominantly produce C2 and C3 products under CO2RR conditions (Fig. 3b). It should be noted that the highest faradaic efficiency for C2 + C3 (C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COO− and 1-propanol) products surpassed 55% at −0.75 V vs. RHE on NGQDs, and the partial current densities for C2H4 (∼50 mA cm−2 at −1.03 V vs. RHE) and C2H5OH (∼24 mA cm−2 at −0.74 V vs. RHE) are comparable to that of commercial Cu nanoparticles under identical testing conditions. It was demonstrated that the CO2 molecule is favorably adsorbed onto the pyridinic N sites of the NGQDs (Fig. 3c and d), and the high density of pyridinic N at edge sites favors the formation of multi-carbon products from the CO2RR.22

The coupling of *CH2 and *CO to give *CH2CO has been proposed to be the C–C bond formation step on NGQDs.63 The free energy barrier of the CO2 hydrogenation step to *COOH on graphene quantum dots is reduced from 0.9 eV to 0.2 eV after introducing edge N atoms, which effectively promotes the reduction of CO2 to CO.63 Furthermore, water-assisted H shuttling significantly reduces the kinetic barrier by 1.3 eV for the generation of *CH2 from the dissociation of C–OH in *CH2OH on NGQDs (Fig. 3e). As a result, the *CH2 species can couple with CO to produce C2 products (C2H5OH and C2H4).
The morphology of the N-doped carbon nanostructures has been suggested to influence the surface electron density, which plays a key role in determining the activity towards the CO2RR. N-doped ordered cylindrical mesoporous carbon catalyzes CO2 reduction to C2H5OH with a faradaic efficiency of 77% and nearly 100% selectivity at −0.56 V vs. RHE.95 The only competitive reaction to CO2 electroreduction to C2H5OH is the hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast, besides CO2 electroreduction to C2H5OH, another CO2 electroreduction to CO route has been found on mesoporous N-doped carbon with an inverse structure as compared to cylindrical mesoporous carbon. As revealed by DFT calculations, both pyrrolic N and pyridinic N sites can improve the adsorption/activation of aqueous CO2 and generation of *CO intermediates.95 Moreover, the *CO species is well stabilized by the ordered channel surface with high electron density, which promotes its dimerization to form *CO–*CO intermediates for subsequent reduction to C2H5OH. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to the endothermic *CO dimerization on the Cu surface with high reaction energy (e.g., +1.9 eV on the Cu(111) facet57), the C–C coupling step of *CO dimerization on pyridinic and pyrrolic N sites is an exothermic process with reaction energies as low as −1.31 eV and −0.34 eV, respectively.95
By further scaling up the medium micropore content in the mesoporous N-doped carbon (Fig. 4a and b), the yield of C2H5OH from the CO2RR can be increased from 0.2 mmol gcat−1 h−1 on the mesoporous N-doped carbon (NC) to 2.3 mmol gcat−1 h−1 on the mesoporous N-doped carbon with micropores (MNC) (Fig. 4c).96 Different from the C–C coupling between *CH2 and *CO on NGQDs63 or *CO dimerization on the mesoporous N-doped carbon,95 a *CO–*CHO coupling mechanism was proposed for C–C bond formation on the N-doped mesoporous carbon with micropores. Based on the DFT calculations, the most thermodynamically favorable reaction pathway was determined to be *CO2 → *COOH → *CO → O*C–CHO → C2H5OH (Fig. 4d).96 Both pyridinic N and pyrrolic N sites favor hydrogenating the intermediate *COOH to form *CO. Further hydrogenation of *CO to *CHO is preferred on the pyrrolic N sites with an exothermicity of −0.24 eV over that on pyridinic N sites with an endothermicity of 0.82 eV. The C–C coupling occurring between the *CHO and a nearby *CO to form an O*C–CHO was demonstrated to be thermodynamically favorable on both pyridinic N and pyrrolic N sites with reaction energies of −0.97 and 0.09 eV, respectively.

Functionalizing carbon with pyridinic derivatives rather than direct N-doping was also demonstrated to yield catalysts capable of driving the C–C bond formation during the CO2RR. Yuan and co-workers97 reported that graphene oxide functionalized with different kinds of pyridine derivatives exhibited high catalytic activities for the CO2RR to C2H5OH and acetone. The faradaic efficiencies of C2H5OH and acetone reached their respective maximal values of 36.4% and 8.9% at −0.40 V vs. RHE. The amount of the pyridinic N sites and the structure of the pyridine derivatives are closely associated with the CO2RR performance. The polarization effects induced by the difference in electronegativity between pyridinic N atoms and C atoms in the *CO are suggested to promote the dimerization of the *CO intermediates to form multi-carbon products.97
Nano-diamonds with sp3 carbon structures also showed their capability to drive the CO2RR to multi-carbon products after doping. The N-doped nanodiamond/Si rod array (NDD/Si RA) electrode is highly selective in converting CO2 to acetate with a production rate of 96.1 mg L−1 h−1 and a corresponding faradaic efficiency of 77.3% at −1.0 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5a and b).37 Compared to the less active N–sp2 C species, the highly active N–sp3 C species is responsible for the high selectivity of acetate in the N-doped nanodiamond electrode. In the in situ infrared spectra for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on the NDDL/Si RA electrode at −1.0 V, bands at 1307 cm−1, 1450 cm−1 and 1036 cm−1 corresponding to OOC–COO, C–H of CH3 and C–OH are clearly visible under the CO2RR conditions (Fig. 5c). Due to the fast kinetics of CO2˙− formation, resulting in a high local CO2˙− concentration, a *CO2˙− can easily interact with another accessible one to generate a  species.37 The subsequent protonation and reduction of the  intermediates lead to the production of acetate. Overall, the formation of the C–C bond and acetate was suggested to proceed via CO2 → CO2˙− →  → CH3COO− (Fig. 5d).

Selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H5OH was achieved on B and N co-doped nanodiamonds.98 The hetero-atom B or N sites were not identified as direct active sites for the C–C bond formation. Instead, two neighboring *CO species bonded to two C atoms adjacent to B and N sites were suggested to dimerize with a downhill free energy of −3.32 eV. The faradaic efficiency of C2H5OH was as high as 93.2% at −1.0 V vs. RHE.
Boron or nitrogen-doped graphdiyne, a carbon material containing both sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, was also theoretically predicted as a potential electrocatalyst to reduce CO2 to C2H4.99 The Gibbs free energy of C–C bond formation on 6 models, namely (sp2 C)2–B–sp C (B1), sp2 C–B–sp C (B2), sp C–B–sp C (B3), (sp2 C)2–N–sp C (N1), sp2 C–N–sp C (N2), and sp C–N–sp C (N3), was investigated. Among these models, the C–C bond formation on the B2 model via the *CH–*CO coupling pathway requires a much lower energy input than the *CO dimerization pathway (Fig. 6). Remarkably, the *CH–*CO coupling on the B2 surface is kinetically preferred. The results revealed that C2H4 can also be formed on B3 via the effective coupling of *CO and *CH, while the production of C2H4 on N2 proceeds via *CO dimerization.

3.1.2. N-doped carbon-supported electrocatalysts. 
The N-doped carbon with active N sites promoting *CO dimerization has also been utilized as a ‘support’ for a CO production component to form tandem catalysts for efficient CO2 reduction to C2 products. In these cases, CO was first generated on the CO-producing catalysts and then transferred to the N-doped carbon. Subsequent *CO dimerization for C–C bond formation was promoted on the pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N sites in the N-doped carbon supports. Ag-anchored N-doped graphene/carbon foam has been demonstrated to be an efficient electrocatalyst for the CO2RR to C2H5OH with a faradaic efficiency ranging from 82.1 to 85.2%.100 A Ru(II) polypyridyl carbene complex immobilized on N-doped porous carbon presented a total C2 faradaic efficiency of 38.4% (27.5% for C2H5OH and 10.9% for acetate).101 However, for both cases, the total current densities were small (below 1 mA cm−2). Most recently, CoO-anchored N-doped carbon presented a C2H5OH faradaic efficiency of 60.1% with a current density of 5.1 mA cm−2 (Fig. 7).102

The N sites in the N-doped carbon support have also been proposed to promote the reduction of the CO2-related species to methyl fragments for acetic acid formation. Genovese et al.103 correlated the CO2RR to acetic acid activity with the formation of nitrogen-coordinated iron(II) sites at the interface between N-doped carbon and iron oxyhydroxide. The N sites near the Fe(II) atoms can chemisorb the CO2-related species for further reduction to methyl fragments (*CH3), enabling C–C coupling between neighboring carboxylate (*COO−) and methyl species (*CH3). The nanostructured iron(III) oxyhydroxide on nitrogen-doped carbon exhibits a high acetic acid faradaic efficiency of 61% at a low applied potential of −0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl.103

3.2. Metal-based electrocatalysts
The CO2RR product selectivity of single metal electrodes in aqueous media (T = 18.5 ± 0.5 °C, 0.1 M KHCO3) can be broadly divided into 4 groups:104 the formate formation metals (e.g., In, Pb, Cd, Hg, and Bi), the CO formation metals (e.g., Ag and Au), the hydrogen evolution metals (Fe, Ni, Ti, and Pt), and Cu which reduces CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols in appreciable amounts. While Cu-based electrodes are most active for multi-carbon product formation, significant progress has also been made recently for CO2 reduction to multi-carbon products on non-Cu-based electrodes (Table 3). In this section, we review these materials based on the group number of metals in the periodic table: (1) Ag- and Au-based electrocatalysts, (2) Cr-, Mo-, and Mn-based electrocatalysts, (3) Fe-, Co-, Ni-, and Pt-based electrocatalysts, and (4) In-, Sn- and Ga-based electrocatalysts.

3.2.1. Ag- and Au-based electrocatalysts. 
Metallic Ag surfaces exhibit high CO2RR selectivity for CO.105–107 Interestingly, C2H5OH was also detected as a minor CO2RR product on Ag surfaces by Hatsukade and co-workers.108 A maximal C2H5OH faradaic efficiency of 0.1% with a partial current density of 0.01 mA cm−2 was achieved at −1.42 V vs. RHE in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The onset potential of C2H5OH formation is −1.23 V vs. RHE on the Ag electrode, which is more negative than the onset potential of C2H5OH formation on the Cu electrode (around −0.82 V vs. RHE13) under similar conditions. Possible reasons for the high overpotential required are the rapid desorption of the *CO and the thermodynamically unfavorable *CO hydrogenation on the Ag surface.47 It is proposed that a hydrogenated *CO (*CHO or *COH) intermediate coupled with a second *C1 species is the pathway for C–C bond formation on the Ag electrode.108 Strengthening the adsorption of the CO intermediate to increase the *CO coverage on the Ag surface is expected to benefit the C–C coupling in the CO2RR. DFT simulations have suggested that a surface with a high-density of under-coordinated sites can not only stabilize the chemisorbed *CO species, but also reduce the kinetic energy barrier for *CO hydrogenation.109 Thus, introducing a high density of low-coordination surface sites on Ag is a promising strategy to promote the C–C coupling for the formation of multi-carbon products from the CO2RR. Recently, Dutta and co-workers110 reported that highly porous Ag-nanofoam electrodes with an abundance of low coordination Ag sites can reduce CO2 to C2H4 with a faradaic efficiency of 8.6%. The Cu-like properties are attributed to the increased CO binding energy on the Ag nanofoam.110 A broad plateau of ∼900 mV in the CO faradaic efficiency vs. potential plot (Fig. 8a), which is different from that on Ag foil (Fig. 8b), is suggested to be the experimental evidence for an increased *CO binding strength on the porous Ag foam electrode. The production of highly reduced hydrocarbons including CH4 and C2H4 with a remarkable total hydrocarbon faradaic efficiency of 59.6% at −1.5 V vs. RHE also demonstrates the stronger *CO binding strength on the Ag foam.110 On the Ag foam electrode, C–C coupling of two *CH2 species is proposed for the formation of C2H4 when the applied potential is more negative than −1.1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 8c). Similar to C2H5OH formation on Ag foil with high overpotential,108 a detectable amount of C2H4 can be achieved only after the applied potential was more negative than −1.2 V vs. RHE on the Ag foam electrode (Fig. 8a). This suggests that the C–C coupling on the pristine Ag surface is not easy due to a large energy barrier.

According to d-band theory, modifying the local surface electronic structures by introducing another metal to form a bimetal or interface is likely to alter the inherent adsorption energetics of certain intermediate(s), thus tuning the selectivity of the CO2RR.21,111–114 Therefore, introducing another metal such as Co,115 which has a stronger CO adsorption capability into Ag to strengthen the CO adsorption would be beneficial for the C–C bond formation on the Ag surface. Recently, Zhang and co-workers116 reported a cold plasma-activated AgCo surface alloy that could selectively reduce CO2 to C2H5OH. It is noteworthy that C2H5OH was the major product with a faradaic efficiency of 72.3% and partial current density of 5.4 mA cm−2 at −0.80 V vs. RHE. As revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the Ag atoms in the AgCo alloy are the active sites for the *CO intermediate adsorption. The dimerization of two *CO species on two separated Ag sites was proposed to be the mechanism for the C–C bond formation.116 Introducing surface defects such as oxygen vacancies into the support can also strengthen the CO adsorption on Ag. In a Ag–Co3O4–CeO2/LGC electrode (LGC = low graphitized carbon),117 the synergistic effects of each component and the high concentration of oxygen vacancies enhanced the adsorption for CO on the Ag sites, resulting in a promising CO2RR to C2H5OH faradaic efficiency of 54.2% at −0.85 V vs. RHE.
Gold binds to CO very weakly, and hence does not produce any detectable amount of multi-carbon products from the CO2RR.118 However, when combined with Pd, a metal that binds CO strongly, a mixture of soluble products and C1 to C5 hydrocarbons are generated.15 Among these products, branched hydrocarbons such as 2-methyl-butane were observed, suggesting the occurrence of a mechanistic pathway that differs from that for the production of hydrocarbons on Cu electrodes. The higher hydrocarbons were proposed to be formed from the polymerization of *CH2 intermediates or via CO insertion in a Fischer–Tropsch-like step.15


3.2.2. Cr-, Mo- and Mn-based electrocatalysts. 
Cr2O3 is rarely investigated as a CO2RR catalyst due to its inert properties for CO2 reduction.119 Recently, Cr2O3–Ga2O3 alloy thin films were reported to be capable of electrocatalytically reducing CO2 to oxalate in an aqueous electrolyte.39 With an optimal composition of 3:1 (Cr2O3 to Ga2O3), a maximal oxalate faradaic efficiency of 59% was achieved at −1.48 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an overpotential of only 690 mV. The onset overpotential of 390 mV for oxalate formation on the Cr2O3–Ga2O3 alloy electrode is far below the value of ∼1500 mV via the *CO2˙− intermediate pathway.39 This suggests that the C–C bond formation of oxalate on the Cr2O3–Ga2O3 alloy electrode does not follow the *CO2˙− dimerization mechanism. Furthermore, 13C isotope labelling experiments reveal that the oxalate is generated at a surface anion site via a CO-dependent pathway, which is highly sensitive to the hydrogen-bonding environment. However, given the fact that the oxidation states of C are +4 in the starting material CO2, +2 in the CO intermediate (or the starting material) and +3 in the final product oxalate, the C–C bond formation mechanism here is complicated especially for the case of electrocatalytic ‘reduction’ of CO to oxalate.
MoS2 has been demonstrated to be a selective CO-producing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR with a faradaic efficiency up to ∼100% in a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte.120–122 Surprisingly, 1-propanol was produced as a major CO2RR product with faradaic efficiencies of 2% to 5% on MoS2 single crystals at a moderate applied potential (−0.59 V vs. RHE) in an aqueous 0.1 M Na2CO3 electrolyte.123 Other multi-carbon products including C2 (ethylene glycol, faradaic efficiency: ∼0.7% at −0.59 V vs. RHE) and even C4 (t-butanol, faradaic efficiency: ∼0.7% at −1.16 V vs. RHE) were also detected. It is noteworthy that, when using CO or CH4 as the feedstock, CH4 is the major product from CO reduction, while C2H6 and C2H4 are formed from the ‘reduction’ of CH4.123 No substantial quantities of these products were observed in the direct electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. This suggests that the C–C bond formation producing C2 to C4 products on MoS2 single crystals involves the coupling of species produced during the CO2RR. Furthermore, it was found that MoS2 with low edge-site densities are more selective towards the formation of multi-carbon products as compared to that with high edge-site densities.123 This implies that the active sites for generating multi-carbon products are likely to be the basal atoms rather than the edge sites. Recently, Kang et al.79 suggested that S-vacancies rather than the terraces are the active sites for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products on MoS2. According to Kang's model, as compared to the coupling of CO2 and CH2O*, the condensation between CH2O* and free CH2O at S-vacancies is energetically the most favorable for forming C–C bonds for C2 products (ethylene glycol and C2H5OH, Fig. 9). The further condensation of formaldehyde leads to the formation of C3 products 1,3-propanediol and 1-propanol. However, due to the increased charge states, the formation of C4 species becomes thermodynamically unfavorable via the formaldehyde condensation pathways.79

Mn-based oxides or complexes have been found to be active for reducing CO2 to C1 (CO or formic acid) products.124–127 Recently, a Mn-corrole complex was developed for the CO2RR to acetic acid with a faradaic efficiency of 61%.128 A novel C–C bond formation mechanism that differs from those on conventional metal electrodes was proposed. In this mechanism, the CO2 molecule is first activated and reduced by the reduced Mn(II)-corrole complex to form Mn(III)–COOH through the proton-coupled electron transfer process. The Mn(III) center, which is Lewis acidic, can stabilize the reduced intermediates by binding with the Lewis basic O-site of the –COOH group. This facilitates the C–C coupling of Mn(III)–COOH and CO2 with one electron transfer to an oxalate type intermediate ([Mn(III)–COOH]0 + CO2 + e− → [Mn(III)–OCO–COOH]−).128


3.2.3. Fe-, Co-, Ni-, and Pt-based electrocatalysts. 
The hydrogen evolution reaction is dominant on metallic Fe.129 However, the CO2RR to CO occurs on Fe3N single crystals,130 Fe macrocyclic complexes131 and Fe–N single atom materials.132,133 Notably, alcohols have also been produced from the CO2RR on Fe2P2S6134 and FeP135 with faradaic efficiencies of 88.3% and 94.3%, respectively. Although methanol is the major CO2RR product, C2H5OH with faradaic efficiencies of 14.1% and 23.1% was also produced on Fe2P2S6 and FeP electrodes, respectively. According to DFT simulations using Fe2P2S6 and FeP(211), dimerization of two *CO species is proposed to be the C–C bond formation mechanism for both catalysts. However, the potential-determining steps for these catalysts were found to be different. On Fe2P2S6, the potential-determining step is *CO → 2(*CO) with an uphill free energy change of 0.35 eV. On FeP, the potential-determining step is the bond formation and hydrogenation of two *CO to *CO–*COH with an uphill free energy change of 1.33 eV, suggesting that formation of ethanol is more difficult on FeP than on Fe2P2S6. The lower faradaic efficiency of ethanol on FeP (maximal faradaic efficiency = 14.1%; −0.2 V vs. RHE, 0.5 M KHCO3) as compared to that on Fe2P2S6 (maximal faradaic efficiency = 23.1%; −0.2 V vs. RHE, 0.5 M KHCO3) supports this proposition.
A Co-corrole complex has been shown to electrocatalytically reduce CO2 to acetic acid and C2H5OH. The maximal total C2 faradaic efficiency is 60% at −0.955 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M NaClO4.136 Notably, C2H5OH is the predominant C2 product with a faradaic efficiency of 48% at −0.8 V vs. RHE (Fig. 10a). Formic acid was experimentally detected as the intermediate for the subsequent reduction process (Fig. 10b). Following a low energy pathway, the H*CO2H intermediate further undergoes one-electron reduction with the elimination of OH− to give HCO˙ that is stabilized at the Co(III) site. In the presence of HCO˙ with increased concentration, the recombination of two formyl radicals (Co(III)–HCO˙ + HCO˙) to an oxaldehyde intermediate (OHC–CHO) becomes an alternative pathway to the reduction pathway of HCO˙ to CH3O˙ (Fig. 10c). The C2 intermediates are then further reduced to C2H5OH and acetic acid.

Nickel is the only single metal, apart from Cu, that has been shown to reduce CO2 to C2H4, albeit with a smaller faradaic efficiency of 0.1% in 0.1 M KHCO3 at a potential of −1.48 V vs. RHE.18 Significant progress has been made: alloys such as Ni–Ga and Ni–Al, compounds like nickel phosphides and NiO, and Ni complexes have been reported to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products electrochemically.
Ni–Ga alloys with different composition ratios (NiGa, Ni3Ga, and Ni5Ga3) were found to electrocatalytically reduce CO2 to C2H4 and C2H6 in an aqueous bicarbonate electrolyte.137 The highest C2 faradaic efficiency of ∼2.1% (C2H6: ∼1.7%, C2H4: 0.4%) was achieved on a Ni5Ga3 electrode. Unlike the results on most Cu electrodes, C2H6 rather than C2H4 was the major C2 product from the CO2RR on Ni–Ga alloy electrodes. When CO was used as the feedstock, the product distribution was the same as that using CO2, implying that the CO2RR on the Ni–Ga alloy electrodes followed the CO2 to CO pathway.137 The intermetallic character is the key factor to achieving higher-order products from the CO2RR on the Ni–Ga alloy.138 The carbon support also impacts the morphology of Ni3Ga, thereby influencing the formation of multi-carbon products.138,139 The onset potential for the reduction of CO2 to C2 products catalyzed by Ni–Ga alloys (NiGa, Ni3Ga, and Ni5Ga3) was −0.48 V vs. RHE,137 which is >250 mV more positive than that with polycrystalline Cu.13 This indicates that the C–C bond formation on Ni–Ga alloys is more feasible than that on the Cu electrode. Electrolysis experiments on Ni3Ga using a D2O-based electrolyte suggest that the mechanistic route for CO2 reduction to C2 products may be distinct from that of classic Fischer–Tropsch catalysis.138
A Ni–Al alloy supported on glassy carbon has also been shown to reduce CO2 to C2 and even C3 oxygenates (C2H5OH, 1-propanol, and acetone).140 1-propanol was formed with a faradaic efficiency of 1.9 ± 0.3% at −1.38 V vs. Ag/AgCl on the Ni–Al electrode. C2H5OH, 1-propanol and acetone are generated from CO intermediates, which is demonstrated by using CO and 13CO2/12CO as feedstocks. In addition, the pH variation of the electrolyte was found to strongly impact the distribution of the products: the ratio of the faradaic efficiencies of 1-propanol/methanol decreases when the electrolyte pH increases. Given that both 1-propanol and methanol originate from the same CO intermediate, this implies that the local pH at the electrode surface affects the C–C bond formation on the Ni–Al electrode.
Ni compounds containing nitrogen141,142 and phosphorus23 have also been investigated. A series of five nickel phosphide compounds, namely Ni12P5, Ni2P, NiP2, Ni3P, and Ni5P4, were found to reduce CO2 to C3 and C4 products with low overpotentials.23 Ni2P was found to be the most selective for reducing CO2 to 2,3-furandiol with a faradaic efficiency of 71% at an overpotential as low as 10 mV, while NiP2 was selective for forming the methylglyoxal product (84% faradaic efficiency at −0.1 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 11a). The methylglyoxal and 2,3-furandiol products produced on the nickel phosphide electrodes have rarely been reported on Cu or other catalysts, suggesting that there may be new C–C bond formation pathways. Considering both thermodynamic and kinetic factors for possible C–C bond forming reactions, formaldehyde self-condensation was proposed as the C–C coupling pathway for the CO2RR on these nickel phosphide electrodes (Fig. 11b). The Lewis acid character of the partially positively charged nickel atoms in the nickel phosphides significantly lowers the energy barrier required for proton abstraction from the C–H bond in formaldehyde and eventually facilitates the C–C bond formation. Eventually, a mechanism of the CO2RR on nickel phosphides to C3 and C4 was proposed (Fig. 11c), which was validated by using selected intermediates as individual starting reagents.

Ni atoms in molecular complexes have also been shown to promote C–C bond formation in the CO2RR. For instance, macrocyclic [N42−] coordinated nickel complexes were reported to catalyze the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to oxalate in acetonitrile as well as N,N-dimethylformamide.143 Ni-salen complexes supported on graphite electrodes can reduce CO2 to C2 products with a total C2 faradaic efficiency of 42.9% after a 20 min reaction (C2H5OH faradaic efficiency: 35.5%, acetaldehyde faradaic efficiency: 7.4%, −1.80 V vs. Ag/AgCl).144 Moreover, C2H5OH selectivity reached the highest value with a faradaic efficiency of 50.7% at −1.60 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Formic acid from CO2 reduction was proposed to be the key intermediate for C2H5OH formation on the Ni-salen complex electrode. The transformation between Ni+ and Ni2+ sites leading to the metastable character of the Ni(I or II)-intermediate was proposed to be crucial for C–C coupling towards C2 products.144
Metallic Pt is considered to be an inactive CO2RR catalyst due to the strong adsorption of CO on the Pt surface, which deactivates it and prevents subsequent reactions.145–147 Interestingly, CH4 was generated from the CO2RR on a Pt electrode in a membrane electrode assembly when using humidified CO2 with low partial pressure as the feedstock.148,149 The configurations of the electrode and the electrocatalytic reactor enable the adjustment of the surface Pt–H/Pt–CO ratio which is responsible for the performance. Furthermore, Centi and coworkers150 reported the production of long carbon-chain hydrocarbons from C2 to C9 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon-based electrodes. The product distributions vary in different types of reactors (Fig. 12a and b). In a semi-half discontinuous cell, the highest total amount of multi-carbon hydrocarbons was produced, of which C2 is the major component (Fig. 12b). Although the total amount of multi-carbons was lowered, longer carbon-chain products including butanol, C6 and C7 were generated in a full continuous cell, while C5 to C9 hydrocarbons were produced in a semi-half continuous cell (Fig. 12b). Besides, a further increase in production, especially for C8–C9 hydrocarbons, was achieved after introducing carbon black as the support. Therefore, it is proposed that the confinement effects induced by the nanoporous carbon limit the rate of diffusion of the reaction products to the gas phase and thus favor their consecutive transformation especially towards heavier hydrocarbons.150 The product distributions do not follow the typical Anderson–Schulz–Flory distribution model (Fig. 12c). This indicates that the formation mechanism of long carbon-chain products (C5 to C9) is distinct from Fischer–Tropsch catalysis.

CO dimerization on a Pt surface to form a C–C bond has also been investigated by DFT calculations. On a Pt55 nanocluster, the highly coordinated Pt atoms on the edges are highly active sites for *CO polymerization at high *CO coverage.54 The direct dimerization of two *CO species on a Pt nanocluster requires an energy barrier up to 1.92 eV or even higher. However, the *CO can capture one free CO molecule to form the *CO dimer with a much lower energy barrier of 0.87 eV. Thus, high *CO coverage or pressure is beneficial for the C–C bond formation on a Pt nanocluster. Surface modification of Pt was found to reduce the *CO dimerization energy barrier. In the Pt3Sn model,151 the Sn adatoms on the Pt surface can facilitate *CO dimerization with an energy barrier of 0.41 eV lower than that on pristine Pt. However, the energy barriers of *CO dimerization or trimerization on a Pt nanocluster or Pt3Sn mentioned above are as high as around 1.0 eV, suggesting that harsh conditions are required for forming C–C bonds on a Pt surface through a *CO dimerization route.


3.2.4. In- and Sn-based electrocatalysts. 
p-Block metals including In-, Sn-, and Bi-based electrocatalysts are generally selective for the CO2RR to formic acid with faradaic efficiencies around 90%.152 However, multi-carbon products including C2 and C3 species could be produced on In- and Sn- containing electrodes.
In the presence of polyoxometalates in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, selective production of acetic acid from the CO2RR has been achieved on In sheets. A faradaic efficiency of 96.5% was achieved with a low concentration of 2 mM polyoxometalate [SiW9V3O40]7− in the Na2SO4 electrolyte at −0.71 V vs. RHE.153 Similarly, the addition of polyoxometalates K5[SiW11Mn(H2O)O39]·9H2O (2 mM) into the Na2SO4 electrolyte resulted in a maximum acetic acid faradaic efficiency of 72.1% at −0.35 V vs. RHE on In sheets.154 No acetic acid was produced when a pristine Na2SO4 solution was used as the electrolyte for both cases, indicating that polyoxometalates in the electrolyte are required to enable the formation of C–C bonds on the In electrode. The polyoxometalates have a unique spatial structure and the ability to transport and store electrons and protons, which is beneficial for reducing the activation energy required for the reaction.153,155,156 Hence, it is proposed that the polyoxometalates in the electrolyte help to reduce the overpotentials for the multi-electron reaction pathway for the CO2RR.157
Well-crystallized SnO2 nanoparticles from exfoliated SnS2 sheets have been reported to be capable of reducing CO2 to C2H5OH with a faradaic efficiency of up to 10% along with trace amounts of C2H4, acetic acid and 1-propanol.158 The unique selectivity is attributed to the distinctive exposed corner/step sites and grain boundaries in the interconnected SnO2 nanoparticles. In particular, the surface SnOx/Sn ratio is suggested to be essential in determining the formation of CO vs. HCOO−, which in turn influences the route to form hydrocarbons and oxygenates. It is proposed that the interaction between the catalyst and electrolyte impacts the C–C coupling between C1 species like CO2˙− at an early stage for the formation of the multi-carbon products.158

4. Challenges and strategies
4.1. Challenges
Despite the significant progress in the CO2RR to multi-carbon products using non-Cu materials, many challenges remain:
- Low activity. Although highly selective for certain C2+ products on some non-Cu catalysts, the partial current densities for most of them are less than 1 mA cm−2. Therefore, developing effective non-Cu CO2RR catalysts to produce massive amonut of multi-carbon products remains a challenge.
- Poor reproducibility. Promising data with high selectivity and low overpotentials for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products have been achieved on some of the non-Cu catalysts. However, follow-up work has rarely been reported for most of the cases.
- Product contamination. Contaminants may come from commonly used organic solvents (e.g., C2H5OH, acetone, ethylene glycol, etc.) and residual amounts of hydrocarbons in the CO2 feedstock. Another possible source of product contamination is the setup used, for example, detectable amounts of contaminants released from the commonly employed ionomer ion-exchange membranes in an electrochemical setup.159
- Cu contamination. Cu is the only metal that is capable of driving the CO2RR to multi-carbon products with appreciable activity. A small amount of Cu species was demonstrated to be very active and selective for multi-carbon products from the CO2RR.160–162 Therefore, trace amounts of Cu contaminants in the chemical reagents or experimental setups could significantly change the product distributions on the non-Cu catalysts.
- Unclear mechanism. At present, mechanisms of the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products remain unclear on both Cu and non-Cu catalysts. Furthermore, some of the non-Cu catalysts were found to be selective for multi-carbon products that have not been detected on Cu, implying that there may be fundamentally different pathways on these catalysts.
Overall, we propose that achieving high activity and selectivity of multi-carbon products reproducibly should be the major objective for the CO2RR on non-Cu catalysts.
Here, we recommend a rigorous and efficient experimental protocol to overcome the contamination issues to improve the reproducibility of the CO2RR to multi-carbon products on non-Cu catalysts (Fig. 13). Firstly, to exclude the presence of Cu contaminants, elemental analysis of all the chemical reagents used for sample preparation and the CO2RR should be performed. In particular, elemental analysis is strongly recommended for the post-reaction electrode to check whether Cu electrodeposition could have occurred during the CO2RR process. Secondly, to exclude the possible presence of organic contaminants from the atmosphere and setup, blank injections of the electrolyte and gas feedstock should be done before performing the CO2RR. Products collected by replacing the CO2 gas feedstock with argon or other inert gases under the same CO2RR conditions should be analyzed to exclude product contaminations from the membrane or setup. Eventually, 13CO2 isotope labelling experiments are suggested to further confirm that the multi-carbon products originate from the CO2RR process.

4.2. Strategies to develop non-Cu electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multi-carbon products
C–C bond formation is the key step for the formation of multi-carbon products during the CO2RR. The Sabatier principle suggests that the interaction strength between the catalysts and intermediates impacts the energy required for the C–C coupling and the free energy landscape of the overall reaction. This, in turn, determines the reaction pathways and thus the final product selectivity.47,163 Therefore, strategies proposed here for boosting the production of multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrodes mainly focus on the stabilization as well as activation of the intermediates for further C–C coupling reactions.

4.2.1. Alloying, doping and interface engineering. 
The surface electronic properties of the catalyst influence its interaction with an intermediate.164 Adsorption of atoms/molecules on the transition metal-based crystal planes has been well described by d-band theory.165,166 Since the chemisorption of molecules to a metal surface is based on the formation of the bonding state and the anti-bonding state after the interaction of the sp states and the d states, according to valence bond theory, the electron occupation of the bonding state can make the system more stable, while the anti-bonding state occupation makes the system unstable. Therefore, when different d-bands interact with the adsorbate molecular orbitals, different bonding and anti-bonding states and their electron occupancy will result in different adsorption energies. Generally, a higher d-band center leads to stronger adsorption of the adsorbate. Since the adsorption strength always influences the catalytic activity, adjusting the d-band center of a metal is a potential strategy to tune its catalytic properties.
In light of the Sabatier principle, moderate adsorption strength between the intermediates and catalyst surface is recognized as an essential factor for intermediate activation and further C–C coupling. In general, the metals in the top-left positions in the periodic table have higher d band center energy levels and tend to form stronger metal–adsorbate bonds.167 Currently, alloying one metal that has a strong adsorbate–metal bond with a secondary metal with a weak adsorbate–metal bond to tune the bond strength to a moderate value has been adopted to promote both the selectivity and activity of the CO2RR.21,114 A typical example is the AuPd alloy,15 a combination of Au which binds CO too weakly and Pd which binds CO too strongly, that can reduce CO2 to C1–C5 hydrocarbons. Other bimetallic alloys like NiGa137 and NiAl137 were also reported to be able to electrochemically reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products.
Another strategy to tune the surface electronic properties is to dope the surface or sub-surface with non-metal heteroatoms. The presence of oxygen atoms within the first few layers of the Cu matrix has been demonstrated to play critical roles in CO2 adsorption and activation.168–170 Furthermore, the partially positively charged Cuδ+ sites induced by the subsurface oxygen atoms also promote the C–C coupling of two CO intermediates.52 Besides oxygen, boron53 and sulfur171 have also been shown to be able to tune the surface electronic properties of Cu to modify its selectivity to C2 products. The SnOx phase on SnO2 derived electrocatalysts was suggested to be responsible for the formation of C2H5OH.158
Interface engineering is also a strategy to tune the surface electronic properties of the metals. The charge transfer between the surface metal cluster (or layer) and the matrix greatly depends on the difference in their work function.172,173 Therefore, it would be possible to modify the metal properties by varying the supports to be selective and efficient for C–C coupling for the CO2RR. To achieve this goal, compositing the metal catalysts with another support to form a core–shell structure,174,175 layered structure, metal cluster supported on a substrate structure,161etc. has great potential for the development of novel non-Cu electrodes for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products. Cu-free composites, such as FeOOH/N-doped carbon,103 Ag–Co3O4–CeO2/LGC,117etc., as CO2RR electrocatalysts have shown their capability to catalyze the conversion of CO2 to multi-carbon products.


4.2.2. Surface engineering. 
The geometric arrangement of the active sites influences their adsorption behaviors.176 The surface coordination number has been investigated as an activity descriptor for the CO2RR177 and other electrocatalysis applications.178 In general, the metal atoms on the metal surface with low coordination numbers provide stronger chemisorption properties.179–181 Given that a moderate adsorption strength is desirable for the CO2RR, there should be an activity vs. coordination number volcano plot for metals that bind the intermediates too weakly or too strongly.177 This provides us with the opportunity to develop non-Cu materials by tuning the surface coordination number to realize C–C coupling during the CO2RR process. A C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 8.6% achieved on highly porous Ag-nanofoam electrodes with a high abundance of low coordination reaction sites is a good example of this.110
Controlling the size of the catalysts is one way of tuning the coordination numbers. The coordination numbers of the surface atoms are found to vary when changing the particle size.182 In general, the number of under-coordinated atoms increases substantially with shrinking particle sizes. As a result, the binding strength of the intermediates varies on nanoparticles with different sizes. Therefore, by adjusting the size of the catalyst particles, it is possible to develop catalysts with optimal adsorption strength to the CO2RR intermediates for more efficient C–C coupling.
In addition to modulating the size of the catalysts, introducing defects such as vacancies, strains, step edges, and grain boundaries has also been demonstrated to influence the adsorption process and the reaction pathways.183,184 In the presence of these defects, the local coordination environments of the metal atoms located around the defects are different from the bulk.185 Catalysts rich in defects can be formed from metal oxide-derived or metal chalcogenide-derived catalysts.
It should also be noted that the band centers and widths of the materials are found to be directly proportional to coordination numbers.180,186 In other words, the surface electronic properties also correlate with the surface coordination environments. Thus, the electronic properties should also be considered to vary with the coordination number when tuning the coordination number of the active atoms.


4.2.3. Additives in the electrolyte. 
The formation of C–C bonds during the CO2RR requires the coupling of two carbonaceous intermediates. Hence, the activity and the abundance of the intermediates are the key factors for the final selectivity and productivity. Homogeneous additives in the electrolyte that can activate the intermediates enable the increase of local concentration of the active intermediates. Homogeneous compounds including polyoxometalates155,156,187 and metal complexes188–190 as recyclable redox mediators have great potential to activate the intermediates for C–C bond formation for the CO2RR.
Polyoxometalates are expected to be an ideal electron and proton carrier to promote the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR owing to their unique features such as the ability to store and transport electrons and protons.155 The metal sites in polyoxometalates can coordinate with the CO2 molecules to form abundant polyoxometalate–CO2 interaction modes.156,191,192 These properties will help to reduce the activation energy to improve the energy efficiency of the CO2RR process. The unique electronic properties of the transition metal sites make polyoxometalates potential candidates to activate the intermediates of the CO2RR for C–C coupling to generate multi-carbon products. The production of oxalate and acetate from the CO2RR on In metal with the assistance of different polyoxometalates is an example of successful pioneering work.153,154
Similar to polyoxometalate, metal complexes are capable of activating small molecules.193 The reactive metal ions in metal complexes are stable in different oxidation states, which can facilitate the electron-transfer process. The reduction potentials of metal ions can be tuned by introducing different electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents into the ligand backbone.188–190 Moreover, metal complexes have also been demonstrated to stabilize the radical species. These characteristics demonstrate the potential of metal complexes as candidates to facilitate C–C coupling in the CO2RR.125,136,144 At present, production of C2 products from the CO2RR has been achieved on Mn-corrole complexes,128 Co-corrole complexes136 and NiII-salen complexes.144

5. Summary and outlook
This review summarizes the recent progress in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrodes. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of C–C coupling between two C1 intermediates for C–C bond formation in the CO2RR. Non-Cu catalysts including carbon-based materials, metals, alloys, oxides and metal complexes have been reported for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products in aqueous electrolytes under ambient conditions. Among them, carbon with pyridinic/pyrrolic N and Ni-based materials have been the most investigated materials for C–C coupling in previous studies. Different from the wide distribution of products on Cu electrodes, some of the non-Cu catalysts showed superior selectivity for the CO2RR to certain multi-carbon products.
Despite the encouraging progress, many challenges remain for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrocatalysts. Contamination and low activity are the current major challenges that introduce uncertainty into the study of non-Cu CO2RR electrocatalysts. Therefore, achieving reliable data and further developing highly efficient and selective non-Cu catalysts for electrochemically converting CO2 to higher-order products remain major research agendas. A protocol suggested in this review enables a more efficient approach to identify the capability of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multi-carbon products on non-Cu electrodes. Optimization of the CO2RR system to promote more efficient CO2RR is another important point besides the optimization of catalysts for this topic. Furthermore, in situ/in operando characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations are also required to understand the fundamental mechanisms.
Compared to Cu-based electrocatalysts, many non-Cu electrocatalysts for the CO2RR to multi-carbon products exhibit advantages like higher selectivity, lower overpotentials, etc. Therefore, although challenges remain, the non-Cu catalysts that can drive the CO2RR to multi-carbon products are an important topic from both fundamental science and practical application perspectives. We hope that this progress summary can stimulate new ideas for the future development and design of highly efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts towards obtaining multi-carbon products.
