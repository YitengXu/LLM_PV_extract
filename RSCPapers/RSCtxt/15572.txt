    , Accepted 7th June 2018First published on 8th June 2018AbstractThe interfacial contacts between perovskite crystals and metal electrodes play a significant role in efficient charge transfer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid ethyl ester (CPTA-E) has been employed to form a uniform electron transport layer (ETL) covering the perovskite surface in p-i-n-structured PSCs to replace the traditional (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ETL. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the perovskite/CPTA-E interface reveals that there are strong coordination interactions between the perovskite and CPTA-E, which are beneficial for the adhesion of the CPTA-E ETL on the perovskite surface. On the other hand, steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence studies of the perovskite films with different quenching layers confirm that CPTA-E ETL has a preferable charge quenching effect compared to the PCBM ETL, which suggests that the CPTA-E ETL has a superior electron extraction and transport ability. The corresponding CPTA-E ETL-based device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.44% with less hysteresis. Moreover, the steady-state photocurrent output of the CPTA-E-containing PSC is prolonged compared to that of the PCBM-based device. Therefore, this work provides a viable strategy to design suitable electron transport materials for high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite materials have emerged as promising light harvesters owing to their fascinating photovoltaic properties, for example, a large absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, excellent tolerance for defects and broad light harvesting throughout the visible wavelength region.1–4 The device architecture of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can be classified into an n-i-p structure and a p-i-n structure, depending on the stacking sequence of the electron transport layer (ETL) and the hole transport layer (HTL). Although PSCs with the n-i-p structure have remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from less than 4% to over 22%,5–8 there is also tremendous potential for developing p-i-n-structured PSCs for further commercialization due to their low-temperature solution processability and concise device architecture.9–22
In 2013, fullerene and its derivatives were first employed as electron transport materials (ETMs) in p-i-n-inverted PSCs due to their low-temperature solution processability, conformal coverage and passivation effect.9,23 Since then, (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has become one of the most commonly used fullerene-based ETMs. Nevertheless, the relatively low electron extraction/transport ability of PCBM restricts the further enhancement of device performance. Thus, the development of a hybrid of the PCBM ETM and high-mobility materials such as reduced graphene oxide and ionic polyfluorene derivatives containing trimethylammonium hexafluorophosphate groups and poly((N,N-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5-(2,2-bithiophene)) has carved out a way to enhance the electron extraction efficiency.24–26 On the other hand, small pinholes could be clearly observed after the PCBM ETL was deposited on the perovskite surface, resulting in a leakage pathway and irregular contact between the perovskite layer and metal electrodes. Recently, some efforts have been made to improve the surface coverage of the PCBM ETL coating on perovskite films by using additives such as oleamide, polystyrene, and polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide).27–29 However, these strategies failed to achieve excellent electron transfer and uniform surface coverage simultaneously. Therefore, the exploration and development of ETMs that have both the capability to effectively extract electrons from perovskite crystals and the ability to form conformal coatings to the perovskite surface have remained a challenge.
Our previous work indicated that the carboxylic acid groups of C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) have robust interactions with hydroxyl groups and Pb2+ ions, which might be beneficial for conformal contact formation.30,31 Nevertheless, CPTA tends to be dissolved in polar solvents, which would decay the perovskite surface in p-i-n devices. Herein, we use weakly polar fulleropyrrolidine (C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid ethyl ester; CPTA-E) to replace PCBM or CPTA as the ETL in p-i-n-structured PSCs. On the one hand, CPTA-E has served as a cathode buffer layer in polymer solar cells due to its high mobility.32 On the other hand, the carbonyl groups of CPTA-E have more robust coordination interactions with under-coordinated Pb2+ ions on the perovskite surface, which will benefit the formation of a uniform capping layer. In consequence, using the CPTA-E ETL allows us to achieve a best PCE of 17.44% with less hysteresis. However, the PCBM ETL PSC device exhibits larger hysteresis, yielding a PCE of 15.09%. Meanwhile, PSCs based on the CPTA-E ETL show prolonged stability under continuous illumination at maximum power point compared to devices with the PCBM ETL. These results highlight that CPTA-E is a rather promising ETM for replacing PCBM in p-i-n-structured PSCs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the CPTA-E ETM and the P3CT hole transport material are shown in Fig. 1a. Due to the triple carboxylic ester groups, the CPTA-E ETM possesses a relatively higher polarity compared to the traditional PCBM ETM, where the PCBM ETM is easily dissolved in weakly polar chlorobenzene (CB).18 However, the solubility of the CPTA-E ETM in CB is lower than that of the PCBM ETM. Therefore, in this work, the relatively high-polarity chloroform (CF) was added into chlorobenzene to increase the solubility of the CPTA-E ETM. Fig. 1b shows the schematic illustration of the p-i-n-structured PSC with a CPTA-E ETL. A CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite light harvester is sandwiched between the bottom P3CT HTL and the upper CPTA-E ETL. Indium-tin oxide (ITO) and aluminum (Al) are chosen as the anode and cathode, respectively. The detailed experiments are well described in the method section. A representative cross-sectional SEM image of the PSC is presented in Fig. 1c. The thickness of CH3NH3PbI3, CPTA-E and Al is estimated to be 450, 50 and 70 nm, respectively. Besides, we can see that there is a conformal CPTA-E capping layer deposited on the perovskite layer to block the direct contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and Al. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the UPS and UV-vis absorption spectra of the CPTA-E and PCBM ETLs were recorded to investigate the energy bands. Fig. 1d depicts the corresponding energy level (versus vacuum) diagram of the device. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the CPTA-E ETL is −4.18 eV, which is close to the LUMO level of the PCBM ETL (−4.04 eV). The matched energy level provides a favourable electron transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to the Al electrode. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the CPTA-E ETL (−6.01 eV) guarantees its preferable hole blocking ability compared with the HOMO level of the PCBM ETL (−5.86 eV), which may lead to a higher VOC. This will be discussed below. These results indicate that CPTA-E is a promising ETM with suitable energy levels.

Fig. 2a presents the J–V curves of the PSC devices with increasing thicknesses of the CPTA-E ETLs of 30, 50, 70 and 90 nm. The detailed photovoltaic parameter values are summarized in Table 1. The highest efficiency of the PSCs is obtained when the CPTA-E ETL reaches an optimal thickness of 50 nm (10 mg mL−1). Beyond this optimal thickness, all of the photovoltaic parameters begin to decrease. When the thickness of the CPTA-E ETL reaches 90 nm (20 mg mL−1), each parameter shows a considerable decrease. A reasonable explanation for the parameter decrease might be that the CPTA-E solutions begin to aggregate along with the concentration increase (Fig. S2, ESI†), leading to a rough CPTA-E film. Fig. 2b depicts the optimal J–V curves of the PSCs with the CPTA-E and PCBM ETLs, respectively. The corresponding parameter values are summarized in Table 2. The optimal PSC device employing the CPTA-E ETL (50 nm) yields a best PCE of 17.44% with an open-current voltage (VOC) of 1.103 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.22 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.22%. Meanwhile, the J–V curve scanned from short circuit to forward bias (Fig. 2b) yields a PCE of 17.02%, indicating that there is less hysteresis in the CPTA-E ETL PSC device. With regard to the PSC containing the PCBM ETL (50 nm), the parameter values of the PCE, VOC, JSC and FF are 15.09%, 1.074 V, 18.36 mA cm−2 and 76.54%, respectively. In contrast, the PCBM based PSC device shows a larger hysteresis with a PCE of 13.67%. Statistical device parameters were obtained by an examination of 30 identical devices from 5 batches, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The 30 PSC devices show enhanced VOC, JSC, FF and PCE values, which indicate that the enhancement of each parameter has excellent reproducibility. The EQE curves of the CPTA-E and PCBM ETL-based devices are shown in Fig. 2c. The optimal PSC device with the CPTA-E ETL presents a relatively higher EQE value of >75% at 450–700 nm. The JSC values estimated from the integration of the EQE spectra under AM 1.5G irradiation are 19.61 and 17.82 mA cm−2 for the CPTA-E and PCBM ETL-based devices, respectively, which are in close agreement with the values obtained from the J–V measurements. We propose that the improvement of each parameter is attributed to the conformal perovskite/CPTA-E interface. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the J–V curves of the PSC devices with the CPTA-E and PCBM ETLs in the dark, respectively. The curves clearly show that the dark current density of the CPTA-E device under reverse bias is lower than that of the PCBM one. Due to the effective hole blocking ability of the CPTA-E ETL, charge recombination is reduced at the CPTA-E/cathode interface, leading to the alleviation of leakage current in the PSC devices.28,33,34 Steady-state photocurrent output experiments at the maximum power point (0.93 V for the CPTA-E ETL device and 0.88 V for the PCBM ETL device) were performed to verify the reliability of the device performance. As shown in Fig. 2d, after 1500 s of illumination at the maximum power point, the CPTA-E ETL PSC device has a stabilized PCE of 16.9% compared to the initial PCE of 17.2%. However, the PCBM device under continuous illumination shows a PCE of 10.5% compared to the initial PCE of 14.9%. We hypothesize that the PCBM ETL has a poor coverage on the perovskite surface compared with the CPTA-E ETL, resulting in the electrode penetrating through PCBM to contact with the perovskite layers. Therefore, the PSC device based on the CPTA-E ETL possesses a higher light stability compared to the PCBM one.

The above photovoltaic behaviours of the PSCs fabricated with the CPTA-E and PCBM ETLs show obvious differences. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the influence of the ETL-covered perovskite morphology on the PSC device performance. The top-view SEM images (Fig. 3a–c) highlight the considerable morphology differences between the pristine perovskite layer, and the perovskite/CPTA-E and perovskite/PCBM bilayers. As shown in Fig. 3a, the pristine perovskite film exhibits a well-developed grain structure, with crystalline platelets appearing to be on the hundreds of nanometre length scale. The perovskite/CPTA-E surface morphology attaining full coverage in the absence of pinholes is shown in Fig. 3b. This conformal CPTA-E ETL prevents any contact between perovskite and Al, which would lead to the improvement of photovoltaic parameters in CPTA-E based PSCs.35–37 However, the perovskite/PCBM bilayer has a comparatively rough surface with some small pinholes, as shown in Fig. 3c. These pinholes could somehow lead to a leakage pathway and direct contact between the perovskite layer and the metal electrodes, which damage the device performance. A reasonable hypothesis for why the PCBM ETL has pinholes is that the PCBM has a relatively weak adhesion to the perovskite surface. Besides, the solubility of PCBM in the CB:CF hybrid solvent is slightly lower than that in CB. Therefore, the spin-coated PCBM film shows some pinholes. Fig. 3d–f present the AFM images of the pristine perovskite, perovskite/CPTA-E and perovskite/PCBM films, respectively. The pristine perovskite film has grains with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 11.2 nm. After the perovskite films are coated with the CPTA-E and PCBM ETLs, the RMS surface roughness becomes 2.5 and 6.8 nm, respectively. The diminished bright areas and decreased roughness of the perovskite/CPTA-E film indicate that CPTA-E forms a smooth capping layer on the perovskite layer. These results indicate that CPTA-E has a preferable film-processing property, which benefits the improvement of PSC performance.

We would like to propose chemical interactions between the Pb2+ ions of CH3NH3PbI3 and the carboxylic ester groups of the CPTA-E ETM to explain the favourable film-processing properties of the CPTA-E ETL through XPS. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Pb 4f XPS peaks shift towards a higher core-level binding energy after the deposition of the ETLs (CPTA-E and PCBM) on the CH3NH3PbI3 surface, suggesting the presence of more negative charge around the Pb2+ ions. Upon the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3/CPTA-E contact, the Pb2+ ions accept the lone pair electrons via a coordinate bond with the carboxylic ester groups, which possess excellent electron affinity.30,31 Considering the size of CPTA-E and the deep position of Pb2+ ions in the octahedral crystalline structure, we propose that the carboxylic ester groups of CPTA-E tend to form chemical interactions with the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries. Besides, we have noticed that the binding energy shift of the CH3NH3PbI3/CPTA-E sample is larger than that of the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM sample. A reasonable explanation is that the three ethyl ester groups of the CPTA-E ETM have superior electron affinities compared to the single methyl ester of the PCBM ETM, leading to the presence of more negative charge around the Pb2+ ions at the CH3NH3PbI3/CPTA-E interface. The I 3d XPS signals are shown in Fig. 4b. A relative increase of the electron affinity arises from a reduction of the internal electron-withdrawing ability of the Pb2+ ions. These results jointly shed light on the fact that the chemical interactions between the Pb2+ ions of CH3NH3PbI3 and the carboxylic ester groups of the CPTA-E ETM benefit the adhesion of the CPTA-E ETL on the perovskite film, leading to a conformal CPTA-E ETL on the perovskite layer. This capping layer prevents direct contact between perovskite and the Al electrode, resulting in the enhancement of parameters in PSCs.

Following the investigation of the influence of chemical interactions on the PSC device performance, we further characterized the charge transfer in the PSCs. Firstly, we examined the electron transport ability of the CPTA-E and PCBM ETMs by constructing an electron-only device (ITO/ZnO/ETL/ZnO/Al).38 As depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the CPTA-E ETM has a higher mobility compared to the PCBM ETM (3.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1versus 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Secondly, steady-state PL quenching experiments and time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay measurements were performed to analyse the photocarrier dynamics of the pristine perovskite film, and perovskite films with the PCBM and CPTA-E quenching layers. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the perovskite film with the CPTA-E quenching layerexhibits a more remarkable PL quenching efficiency compared to the PCBM one, indicating that CPTA-E is a more efficient ETM. Meanwhile, the steady-state PL peaks of the pristine perovskite film and perovskite films with PCBM and CPTA-E quenching layers are located at 768, 765 and 763 nm, respectively. The larger blueshift of the PL peak for the perovskite film coated with the CPTA-E ETL reveals that the trap states on the perovskite surface are significantly passivated by the CPTA-E ETL.22,31 The TRPL decay behaviours are plotted in Fig. 5b to further investigate the carrier dynamics. The PL decay exhibited a bi-exponential decay characteristic of recombination. The detailed PL decay lifetimes are summarized in Table 3. The perovskite film with the CPTA-E quenching layer has a lifetime of 1.29 ns, which is twofold shorter than that of the PCBM one (2.81 ns) and about one-ninth of the pristine perovskite film (11.19 ns). These results suggest that carriers generated from the perovskite films are extracted more efficiently by the CPTA-E ETL, which elucidates that the CPTA-E ETL has a superior electron extraction ability compared to the PCBM ETL.

Alternating current impedance spectrometry (ACIS) is an effective tool to investigate the charge transport properties of PSCs. We measured the ACIS of the devices by applying an alternating current signal with an oscillating amplitude of 20 mV in the dark. The intersection of the lateral axis and the arch at low frequency is related to the recombination resistance.39 As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the ACIS of both the CPTA-E and PCBM based devices showed semicircles. As expected, the device based on the CPTA-E ETL has a larger interface recombination resistance compared to that of device with the PCBM ETL. This increment in the recombination resistance may result in a reduction of the interface losses and provide the major contribution to the increased FF.
Conclusions
In summary, the CPTA-E ETL has successfully replaced the PCBM ETL for fabricating p-i-n-structured PSCs with high performance, less hysteresis and prolonged stability under continuous illumination at the maximum power point. Triple carboxylic ester groups of the CPTA-E ETM with high electron affinity can form robust coordination interactions with Pb2+ ions on the perovskite surface. Therefore, the improved adhesion of the CPTA-E ETL to the perovskite surface makes it easy to form a conformal capping layer. This uniform coverage prevents direct contact between the perovskite and metal electrodes. The steady-state PL and TRPL results show the improved electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the Al electrode by utilizing the CPTA-E ETL, which effectively reduces the charge recombination at the perovskite/electrode interface. This work not only suggests that CPTA-E is an efficient ETM, but also provides an approach to design ETMs that can form chemical interactions between their functional groups and the perovskite film.
