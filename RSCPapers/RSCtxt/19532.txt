    , Accepted 26th September 2016First published on 26th September 2016AbstractSemiconductors with converging multiple electronic valleys and soft chemical bonds are ideal for high-performance thermoelectrics. Narrow gap Bi2Se3 is a well-known three-dimensional topological insulator with non-trivial surface states, while possessing low thermoelectric properties due to its single-degenerate band conduction, despite being an important constituent of highly efficient n-type thermoelectric Bi2(Te,Se)3. Here we demonstrate that in Te-free Bi2−xSbxSe3 converging multiple electronic band valleys and strengthening phonon scattering can be realized simultaneously via a composition-induced (Sb-alloying) structural transition from a rhombohedral phase to an orthorhombic phase. The accompanying chemical bond softening and structural distortion cause significant modifications to the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion. The convergence of heavy bands realized in the orthorhombic phase (x ≥ 1.0) largely increases the electron density of states effective mass, and thus gives rise to a high Seebeck coefficient of ∼−280 μV K−1 at 800 K. Meanwhile, phonon softening and substantial lattice anharmonicity pertain to weak interchain interactions considerably block the heat-carrying acoustic phonons, resulting in ultralow lattice thermal conductivities of ∼0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and ∼0.3 W m−1 K−1 at 800 K. Consequently, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of ∼1.0 can be achieved for n-type BiSbSe3, about three times higher than that of the optimized Bi2Se3. The moderately high ZT of Te-free BiSbSe3 makes it a promising candidate for low-mid temperature power generations. Furthermore, the concept of structural transition driven band convergence and chemical bond softening can be applied to improve the thermoelectric properties of other materials and may also shed light on identifying new materials.

Broader context
Thermoelectric technology, capable of direct conversion between heat and electricity, could be an important component to new clean energies, due to its potentially advanced applications in recovering various waste heat from industrial segments and automobile exhaust, or as an efficient alternative to the current mechanical cooling. Large-scale applications, however, are hampered by the low efficiency of current thermoelectric materials, high cost, and earth rarity of some major constituents, especially Te (ninth least abundant element in the Earth's crust) which is an essential constituent in many important thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe. Te-free Bi2Se3, well-known as a three-dimensional topological insulator, could be an affordable alternative to Bi2Te3 or used for low-mid temperature power generation applications. Nevertheless, its low thermoelectric properties (ZT ∼ 0.3), primarily due to its single-degenerate band conduction, largely limit its practical applications. Here, we demonstrated in Bi2Se3 that crystal structural transition induced modifications in electronic and phonon structures largely improve the thermoelectric figure of merit to ∼1.0, mainly due to simultaneously converged multiple conduction valleys and significantly intensified phonon scatterings. Our strategy of structural distortion and bond softening driven band convergence and phonon softening, stemming from the structural phase transition, can be applied to other materials to further improve their thermoelectric properties and also shed light on identifying new materials.

Introduction
Exploration of sustainable new clean energies has become a global consensus, due to the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing concern of environmental protection.1 Thermoelectric technology, enabling direct conversion of thermal energy into electricity, can be an important constituent of new clean energies.2 The primary limitation for widespread applications of this promising technology is the low conversion efficiency of current materials attributed to the strong interdependence of the governing physical parameters, and also high material costs (e.g., Te-based compounds Bi2Te3 and PbTe). In the past two decades, the field has witnessed great progress and successfully established several efficacious paradigms, such as nanostructuring,3,4 phonon glass electron crystal (PGEC),5–7 band engineering,8–11 and large lattice anharmonicity,12,13etc. Recently band engineering to converge multiple electronic valleys has been demonstrated to be a robust strategy for achieving a high power factor, due to the large electronic density of states (DOS) and thus a high Seebeck coefficient contributed by the multiple valleys while retaining high carrier mobility in each valley.8,9,14 In addition, materials with soft chemical bonds and anharmonic lattice dynamics are usually poor thermal conductors.15–17 The combination of these features could be an avenue for high-performance thermoelectrics. However, only limited materials8,18 have been identified that simultaneously possess large band degeneracy and strong anharmonic lattice dynamics, primarily due to the challenges in achieving the favourable combinations, which are highly inter-dependent.
Bi2Se3, known as a three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) and a sister compound of the best commercialized thermoelectric material Bi2Te3,19 has drawn little attention in the past. Even though a Te-rich n-type Bi2(Te,Se)3 system has achieved enhanced ZTs of 1.1–1.2 recently,20–23 the rarity of Te (ninth least abundant element in the Earth's crust) and its widespread applications in multiple industries pose great challenges and limitations for large-scale application.24 Te-free Bi2Se3, however, could be an important alternative to Bi2Te3 and would also be used for low-mid temperature power generation applications, if its ZT (∼0.3) could be largely improved.25,26 Several attempts, such as nanostructuring,27–29 and doping,30,31etc., have been reported to improve the ZT of this material, but only with limited success. The low power factor of n-type Bi2Se3 is primarily attributable to the single valley conduction band minimum (CBM), i.e., band degeneracy Nv = 1, and thus low DOS.19,32 In the electronic band structure of Bi2Se3, the CBM is located at the Γ point, while a second conduction band is ∼0.2–0.5 eV higher in energy.32,33 These upper conduction bands are too high to be utilized via elemental doping while satisfying the need for keeping the Fermi level and carrier concentration within the optimal ranges. In order to take advantage of the upper band and thus increase Nv, a significant modification of the electronic band structure is needed. Meanwhile, further suppression of phonon transport is also critical to largely enhance the ZT of Bi2Se3.
One possible way to significantly modify the electronic band structure of a compound is to change its crystal structure, e.g., utilizing a crystal-structural transition. Upon the structural transitions, the redistribution of atoms, change in chemical bonds, and structural distortion could largely alter the electronic band structure as well as the phonon dispersion, providing the opportunity to realize favourable electronic and/or lattice dynamical features for good thermoelectrics. In fact, due to the lattice instability which drives the crystal-structural transition, low-lying optical modes, strong optical–acoustic couplings, and thus low lattice thermal conductivity are normally observed in the compounds with structural transitions or near structural instability, such as Cu2Se,34,35 SnSe,36 or near ferroelectric PbTe.37,38 Upon combining the favourable electronic and phononic properties, high ZTs have indeed been observed in the high-temperature phases of several thermoelectric materials, e.g., SnSe,17 Cu2Se,34,39 and Zn4Sb3.40,41 It is, however, worth noting that the high ZTs achieved in the high-temperature phases are generally accompanied by significant volume changes during the structural transitions, which could probable result in mechanical degradation of the materials or device failure. Therefore, the materials with temperature-induced structural transitions, especially those with significant volume changes, are very challenging for practical thermoelectric applications, even with high ZTs in the high-temperature phases. Besides temperature, there are other factors, such as pressure,42 magnetic field,43 and chemical composition,44etc., that can be utilized to drive the structural transition. In particular, the structural transition induced by varying the chemical composition, such as alloying or doping, is practically feasible, and the corresponding two phases are thermally stable and mechanically robust at the operating temperatures.44,45 Thus composition-induced structural transition could be a favourable way to largely alter the electronic and phonon properties of a material, and thus provide an opportunity to largely improve its thermoelectric properties.
In this study, we demonstrate that in Te-free Bi2Se3, by utilizing an Sb alloying induced crystal-structural transition, the maximum ZT can be significantly improved from ∼0.3 to ∼1.0, making it a potentially affordable candidate for low-mid temperature power generation applications. Here Sb-alloying prompts a structural transition from the rhombohedral phase (Bi2Se3-based) to the orthorhombic phase (Sb2Se3-based), accompanied by substantial softening in the chemical bonds and structural distortions, and thus considerable modifications in the electronic band structures and lattice dynamics. Specifically, the doubled band degeneracy (Nv increases from 1 to 2) and increased band mass in the orthorhombic phase give rise to large DOS effective masses (m* ∼ 2 m0) and enhanced power factors of ∼ 6 μW cm−2 K−1 at 800 K. Meanwhile, compared to rhombohedral Bi2Se3 (∼1.3 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K), the lattice thermal conductivity is also significantly lowered down to ∼0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and ∼0.3 W m−1 K−1 at 800 K, approaching the minimum thermal conductivity. The strengthened intrinsic phonon scatterings in the orthorhombic phase are mainly originated from the structural transition-induced chemical bond weakening, phonon softening, and anharmonic lattice dynamics, in addition to the substitutional point defects due to Sb-alloying.
Experimental section
Material synthesis and characterization
All samples were prepared by a melting–annealing combined with a subsequent spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. High purity Bi (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), Sb (99.9999%, Alfa Aesar), Se (99.995%, Alfa Aesar), and iodine (99.95%, Sigma Aldrich) were weighed according to the stoichiometric Bi2−xSbxSe3−yIy (x = 0.0–2; y = 0.0–0.1), and loaded into quartz tubes. The tubes with raw materials were sealed under a high vacuum (10−5 torr), put into a box furnace, heated to 900 °C in 5 h, and soaked at 900 °C for 12 h. Then the tubes were quenched in ice water, and annealed in a vacuum at 400 °C for 48 h. The annealed ingots were subsequently pulverized into fine powders (200 mesh) and loaded into graphite dies with a diameter of 12.7 mm, and sintered using SPS at 400–500 °C for 5–10 min under a uniaxial pressure of 40 MPa. The typical thickness of the sintered cylinders is 13 mm. 8 × 8 mm2 square sheets with thicknesses of 1.5–2 mm, 3 × 3 × 10 mm3, and 0.5 × 2.5 × 10 mm3 rectangular bars were cut for their thermoelectric property and Hall effect measurements. It is worth mentioning that the thermoelectric property measurements were all performed perpendicular to the SPS press direction.
The phase compositions of the bulk samples were determined using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Focus X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), and the lattice parameters were calculated using the full profile Rietveld refinement method in FullProf_Suite software.46 The backscattered electron (BSE) images and elemental mappings were collected using a Hitachi TM3000 microscope equipped with Bruker energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (α) were simultaneously measured using a commercial equipment (ZEM-3, Ulvac Riko, Inc.) under a low-pressure helium atmosphere. Thermal conductivity (κ) was calculated from the measured thermal diffusivity (λ), specific heat (Cp), and density (d) using the relationship κ = λCpd. Thermal diffusivity λ was tested using the laser flash method using a Netzsch LFA-457 system, and specific heat (Cp) was measured using a Netzsch DSC 404F1 using sapphire as the reference. The measurement temperature ranges from 300 K to 800 K, and the samples are thermally stable in the measured temperature range (5 cycles in ZEM-3 between 300 K and 800 K). Uncertainties in electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity are estimated to be ±5%, ±3%, and ±10%, respectively. Hall coefficient measurements (300–650 K) were performed on a home-made system equipped with a 2 T electromagnet, and the magnetic field was measured using a flux meter. Four-probe configuration and pressure contact were used for the measurements. The carrier concentration (nH) and Hall mobility (μH) were estimated from the measured Hall coefficient (RH) and electrical conductivity by the relations nH = r/e|RH| (assuming the Hall factor r = 1.0) and μH = σ|RH|, respectively, where e is the free electron charge.
Computational techniques
All first-principles calculations were carried out using the plane wave projector-augmented wave (PAW) method,47,48 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).49,50 The plane wave cutoff is set to 300 eV. We used a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) form,51 and the Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was carried out within an 8 × 7 × 7 k mesh. We set the very accurate convergence criteria to be 5 × 10−5 eV Å−1 for structural relaxation of the unit cell and 5 × 10−8 eV for the self-consistent calculations, in order to get precise lattice parameters and atomic positions. The spin–orbit interactions were considered in the band structure calculations. The lattice dynamic properties of BiSbSe3 were investigated using the frozen phonon method,52 which was implemented in the Phonopy package.53 Supercells with a 2 × 2 × 2 size of the fully relaxed unit cell were constructed, and the Hellmann–Feynman forces for the supercells with small displacements (1 pm for each non-equivalent atom) were calculated.
Results and discussion
The Bi2Se3–Sb2Se3 pseudo-binary system

Phase composition and microstructure. 
Sb-alloyed Bi2Se3 has been previously studied as three-dimensional TIs,54 for solar cells,55 and thermoelectrics,30,56,57etc., due to its peculiar physical properties. The interplay of structural and transport properties within the whole Bi2Se3–Sb2Se3 range, especially the Sb-rich orthorhombic phase, however, were seldom studied. To fully understand the structural and transport relation, knowledge of the phase diagram is a necessary and powerful tool. The pseudo-binary Bi2Se3–Sb2Se3 phase diagram was first reported by Kuznetsov et al.,58 as shown in Fig. 1(a). According to their original results, for Bi2−xSbxSe3 a pure rhombohedral phase (Bi2Se3-based) and a pure orthorhombic phase (Sb2Se3-based) exists for x ≤ 0.26 and x ≥ 1.0, respectively, while mixed crystals of both phases exist in-between (0.26 < x < 1.0).58 This result is well consistent with our polycrystalline samples that were annealed for two days to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium, shown as the XRD patterns in Fig. 1(b). Our study and some previous studies further refine the phase boundary lines at the Bi-rich composition side, and extend the alloying limit of Sb in Bi2Se3 to ∼22 at% (x = 0.44), as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1(a). Detailed compositions in the range of x ∼ 0.44–0.5 and 0.8–1.0 would certainly help to determine more precise phase boundary lines, however, this is beyond the scope of the present study. The BSE images of well-polished surfaces of some typical compositions (x = 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0) are shown in Fig. 1(d)–(f). The BSE images of other samples are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is obvious that the x = 0.4 and x = 1.0 samples are single phase, but the x = 0.6 sample has a mixture of two different phases: the Bi-rich phase is shown as the bright areas and the Sb-rich phase as the dark areas. The BSE results are in good agreement with the XRD data, and also reveal that the two phases with sizes of several tens of micrometers are randomly mixed in the two-phase samples.

The calculated lattice parameters of all compositions are shown in Fig. 1(c), together with some previous results.57,58 For the rhombohedral Bi-rich phase, the a axis is shortened while the c axis is elongated with incorporating Sb, resulting in an increase of c/a but a decrease of the cell volume. The result is in good agreement with previous reports,57,58 as shown in Fig. 1(c). The decreased cell volume, primarily due to the substitution of smaller Sb (covalent radius rSb = 1.38 Å vs. rBi = 1.46 Å), manifests in the solid solution region (x < 0.44). The cell parameters a and c are almost unchanged while reaching the two-phase region, indicating the alloying limit of Sb. For the orthorhombic Sb2Se3, Bi can alloy at more than half of the Sb sites, with increasing b′ and c′ while keeping a′ almost unchanged, as the Bi content increases. The structural rhombohedral–orthorhombic (R–O) phase transition is related to the breakage of part of the cation–anion bonds, resulting in converting half of the octahedrally coordinated cations into the five-coordination. This is further accompanied by a transformation from a layered structure to a chain-like structure. The crystal structures of rhombohedral Bi2Se3 and orthorhombic Sb2Se3 are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), respectively. More importantly, the significant structure change during the phase transition will induce a significant change in the electronic band structure and lattice dynamics,54,59 and thus offer opportunities to regulate the thermoelectric transport properties of Bi2Se3-based materials, as will be discussed later.


Electrical transport properties. 
The thermoelectric transport properties of Bi2−xSbxSe3 (x = 0–2.0) were measured between 300 K and 680 K, and the room temperature physical properties are summarized in Table 1. The temperature dependences of the thermoelectric transport properties are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Here the reduced Fermi energy η, DOS effective mass m*, and Lorenz number L were estimated based on the assumption of a single parabolic band (SPB) and acoustic phonon scatterings of the electrons, using the experimental Seebeck coefficient and carrier concentration values. The details of these calculations can be found in the Note 1 (ESI†) or elsewhere.41 With increasing Sb content, σ decreases gradually, while α increases, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Rapid jumps in α and σ can be observed in the two-phase region. For x ≤ 0.6, the transport properties are dominated by the more conductive rhombohedral phase, in which Sb-alloying slowly decreases the carrier concentration and mobility, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Here the decrease in electron concentration mainly originates from the significant suppression of positively charged Se vacancy  and annihilation of the electrons by Sb-alloying, according to the following defect reactions60,61 (1)and (2)Upon increasing the Sb content beyond x = 0.6, the orthorhombic phase gradually dominates the carrier transport, and rapid variations in the carrier concentration and mobility by orders of magnitude can be observed, as highlighted in the shadow area in Fig. 2(b). Similar variations in carrier concentration and mobility have also been found in the Bi2−xSbxSe3 films.54 As phonon scattering dominates carrier transport in Bi2−xSbxSe3, the dramatic mobility drop for the x > 0.6 samples (over an order of magnitude) is attributed mainly to the phase transition induced band structure variations, including an m* increase (as shown in Table 1 and discussed later) or probable increase of the deformation potential, and partially to intensified impurity scattering by Sb-alloying. To further study the Sb-alloying induced metal–insulator transition behavior,54 the electron mean free path was calculated using l = (ℏμH/e)(3π2nH)1/3, where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. As shown in Fig. 2(c), l decreases gradually with increasing Sb content. Different from the single crystalline thin films showing higher and smoothly varying l, the polycrystalline samples in our study show much lower l values and a sudden drop in the two-phase region. The much lower l of the polycrystalline samples is due to the low carrier mobility. According to the Ioffe–Regel criterion, a material remains metallic only if kFl > 1, where the Fermi wave vector kF is defined as (3π2nH)1/3.54,62 As shown, the x < 0.8 samples show a metallic conduction, while a transition into insulators is clearly observed for x ≥ 0.8 (kFl < 1). This is in good agreement with the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†). The critical Sb-content for metal–insulator transition is ∼x = 0.6–0.8, quite different from that of single crystalline thin films of ∼x = 1.6 and previous theoretical calculations.54,59 The above analyses clearly demonstrate an Sb-alloying structural transition for Bi2−xSbxSe3, accompanied by significant changes in the electronic structure and transport properties.

(a) Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient, (b) carrier concentration and mobility, (c) electron mean free path l and kFl, and (d) electron effective mass m*/m0 and the reduced Fermi energy η. The results for the thin films are also shown for comparison.54 The shadow areas indicate the two-phase regions. 
It is worth mentioning that the absolute α values (<160 μV K−1 while nH ∼ 3 × 1018 cm−3) of the rhombohedral Bi2Se3-related materials (x ≤ 0.6) are too low to warrant high thermoelectric properties, even when the Fermi levels are already close to the band edge. This is primarily due to the single conduction band (Nv = 1), evident from the calculated low electron effective mass (<0.2 m0). As shown in Fig. 2(c) and Table 1, the electron effective mass of Bi2Se3-based materials decreases further when shifting the Fermi level down to the band gap, consistent with the band nonparabolicity of the Bi2X3-based materials (X = Te and Se).26,63 According to Fig. 2(a) and (d), after the R–O transition the absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient is largely increased to over 400 μV K−1, and also the m* values of the orthorhombic phase are increased to ∼0.4 m0. This m* value primarily represents the effective mass at the CBM. It is noted that the estimated m* values for the x > 0.6 samples using the SPB assumption are somewhat underestimated due to their in-gap Fermi levels and possible two-carrier conductions. As will be discussed below, this underestimation partly accounts for the large increase in m* while moving the Fermi level into the conduction band, though it is presumably ascribed to the band nonparabolicity and the contribution of another heavy band. Moreover, the calculated energy gaps using Eg = 2eαmaxTmax clearly show a rapid increase during the R–O transition,64 shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The increased band gap for O-(Bi,Sb)2Se3 is also corroborated by the reduced bipolar conduction in thermal conductivity and the appearance of “turn-over” in the Seebeck coefficient moving above 500 K, even though the Fermi levels are located within the band gap,65 as illustrated in Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S4 (ESI†). The large band gap and heavy band of O-(Bi,Sb)2Se3 further reveal its potential applications in the mid-temperature range if the Fermi level can be effectively adjusted.


Electronic band structures. 
To further rationalize the influences of Sb-alloying and R–O transition on the electrical properties, the electronic structures and Fermi surfaces at n ∼ 3 × 1019 cm−3 of R-Bi2Se3, O-BiSbSe3, and O-Sb2Se3 were calculated, as shown in Fig. 3. This carrier concentration is roughly the optimal value for Bi2Te3-based materials.26 The calculated band structures of R-Bi2Se3 and O-Sb2Se3 are well consistent with the previous reports.19,32,66 As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the CBM of R-Bi2Se3 locates at the center of the Brillouin zone (Γ point) and the second conduction valley located at the Z point is ∼0.15 eV from the CBM. This means that the electron transport in R-Bi2Se3 is primarily dominated by the single-degenerate light band at the Γ point, and possibly influenced by the valley at Z for heavily-doped samples (for instance, n ∼ 9 × 1019 cm−3 at 300 K, as indicated by the red dashed line in Fig. 3(a)). It is noted that 9 × 1019 cm−3 is the maximum attainable carrier concentration in this study, as shown below. The single-degenerate feature for R-Bi2Se3 is also corroborated by the single ellipsoidal Fermi surface shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). The effective mass derived from the CBM is ∼0.35 m0, which is larger than our experimental results. This light band and single degeneracy feature is well consistent with the low calculated DOS m* and thus low α. For O-Sb2Se3 possessing a distinct crystal structure from R-Bi2Se3 (see Fig. S3, ESI†), the CBM and valence band maximum (VBM) both locate along the Γ–Y, with a gap of ∼1.26 eV which is in good agreement with previous studies.66,67 As can be seen in Fig. 3(c), the lowest conduction band is rather flat, indicating a large band effective mass. Furthermore, the degeneracy of the CBM pertaining to the orthorhombic structure is 2, as indicated by the two quasi-spherical Fermi surfaces (inset of Fig. 3(c)). In addition, the second minima located at Y is only ∼0.05 eV (η ∼ 2 at 300 K) higher, which could contribute significantly to the electrical conduction at moderate carrier concentrations (e.g., n ∼ 9 × 1019 cm−3 as the red dashed line in Fig. 3(c)). This conduction band configuration could ensure high band degeneracy (Nv ∼ 2 or 4) and thus a high DOS effective mass, offering the opportunity to achieve a high α and power factor if the Fermi level can be effectively regulated.

Comparing with that of Sb2Se3, the band structure of O-BiSbSe3 shows a decreased band gap of ∼0.98 eV and band splitting at the Y point, probably due to the symmetry breaking caused by Sb alloying. The CBM of O-BiSbSe3 likewise locates in the region of Γ–Y with Nv = 2 (inset in Fig. 3(b)), which also shows the very flat shape and thus large DOS effective masses. The estimated effective mass of a single valley at the CBM is ∼0.81 m0, and the DOS m* is ∼1.3 m0 due to the doubly degenerate band. These values are significantly larger than that of Bi2Se3. Compared with R-Bi2Se3 (EF_3×1019 ∼ 0.14 eV and EF_9×1019 ∼ 0.24 eV) with the same carrier concentrations, smaller Fermi energies of O-BiSbSe3 (EF_3×1019 ∼ 0.047 eV and EF_9×1019 ∼ 0.11 eV) and O-Sb2Se3 (EF_3×1019 ∼ 0.029 eV and EF_9×1019 ∼ 0.078 eV) also confirm their large DOS. We also calculated the conduction band DOS of the three compositions with zero energy point representing the respective CBMs, shown in Fig. 3(d). It is obvious that O-BiSbSe3 and O-Sb2Se3 show much higher DOS compared with those of R-Bi2Se3 in the energy range of 0–0.6 eV, which is also confirmed by the much higher electron m* of the orthorhombic phases determined in our experiments, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2(d). The high DOS, essential for a high α and power factor, is primarily rooted in the increased band degeneracy and band mass induced by the R–O transition. The low electrical conductivity of undoped O-BiSbSe3, mainly due to the low carrier concentration, can be improved by proper doping, as will be addressed below.


Lattice thermal conductivity and phonon dispersion. 
Lattice thermal conductivity κL is estimated by subtracting the electronic contributions κe from κ (κL = κ − κe), and κe is estimated according to the Wiedemann–Franz law, κe = LσT. L is calculated using experimental α values and shown in Table 1. The room temperature κL as a function of Sb content is shown in Fig. 4(a). The temperature dependent κ and κL can be found in Fig. S4 (ESI†). κL first decreases and then increases as the Sb content increases, reaching a minimum value of ∼0.64 W m−1 K−1 for BiSbSe3. This value is about half that of Bi2Se3 (κL ∼ 1.3 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K) and also much lower than that of Sb2Se3 (κL ∼ 1.0 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K). Compared with Bi2Se3, the origin of the κL reduction in Bi2−xSbxSe3 should primarily include the point defect scattering by Sb-alloying and probably other factors induced by the structural transition, such as modulations in phonon dispersion and lattice dynamics. To determine the contribution of phonon point defect scattering, we estimated the lattice thermal conductivity based on the Klemens–Callaway theory,68,69 considering the mass fluctuation and strain field effects, shown as the solid and dashed lines with different values of phenomenological adjustable parameter ε = 100 and 150. The different ε values are estimated from different anharmonicity constants – the Grüneisen parameter γ = 1.5 and 2.0, and details of these calculations can be found elsewhere68,69 or in the Note 2 (ESI†). As can be seen from Fig. 4(a), for the rhombohedral phase (x < 0.5) the calculated κL is roughly consistent with the experimental results, indicating the formation of solid solutions. The calculations for the x > 0.5 samples, even with a high ε value of 150 (γ = 2.0), cannot reproduce the experimental results. The appearance of an orthorhombic phase in the two-phase region largely decreases κL beyond the alloying model, and the orthorhombic Sb2Se3-based materials also show much lower κL than those of the Bi2Se3-based materials. The low κL values for the orthorhombic-phase-dominated compositions (x > 0.5) indicate very strong phonon scattering pertaining to the orthorhombic structure. The intrinsically strong phonon scattering should be ascribed to the peculiar lattice dynamics and phonon dispersion of the orthorhombic structure.

The error bars in (a) are ±5%. (b) Crystal structure, (c) inter-chain (dash lines) and intra-chain Sb–Se bonding lengths, (d) phonon dispersion, and (e) phonon density of states of O-BiSbSe3. 
As mentioned above, the R–O structural transition is accompanied by a transition from a layered structure to a chain-like structure and causes significant bonding and phonon softening. These will largely lower the sound velocity and probably increase bonding anharmonicity. The phonon dispersion of O-BiSbSe3 was calculated as shown in Fig. 4(d). The crystal configuration used for the calculations are shown in Fig. 4(b), in which Bi and Sb separately occupy chains sliced in the b–c plane. We have relaxed several structure configurations and found that the currently used one possesses the lowest energy. The structure in Fig. 4(b) only shows the bonds within the range of covalent interaction. A chain-like structure with an inter-chain bonding length larger than 3.0 Å can be clearly observed, similar to the structure of Sb2Se3.70 The calculated intra-chain bond lengths, shown in Fig. 4(c), are ∼2.6–2.8 Å for Sb–Se and ∼2.7–2.9 Å for Bi–Se, which are comparable to those in Sb2Se370 and Bi2Se3,71 indicating strong intrachain covalent bonding. These inter-chain bonding lengths ranging from 3–3.15 Å, however, are obviously longer than the sums of the covalent radii of Bi–Se (2.62 Å) and Sb–Se (2.54 Å). According to the bonding descriptor for a Sb–Se contact developed by Deringer et al. for Sb2Se3,70 the inter-chain and Sb(1)–Se(1) (or Bi(1)–Se(1)) bonds are typically weak interactions with some covalency. The weak interactions along the a and c directions cause significant phonon softening, as indicated by the low cut-off frequencies along the Γ–X and Γ–Z regions (<20 cm−1 for the transverse acoustic (TA) branches and <25 cm−1 for the longitudinal acoustic (LA) branch). Similar features were also observed in Sb2Se3,71 while Bi2Se3 shows almost doubled cut-off frequencies for both the TA (∼40 cm−1) and LA branches (∼50 cm−1), as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The average phonon velocities of the three acoustic branches in O-BiSbSe3 are 1324 m s−1, 1844 m s−1, and 3097 m s−1, and the average sound velocity is ∼1688 m s−1. The average sound velocity is comparable to that of Bi2Te3 (1620 m s−1)72 and smaller than those of Bi2Se3 (1996 m s−1)73 and Sb2Se3 (2685 m s−1).67 We also estimated the γ values of the three acoustic branches: 1.60 (TA1), 1.22 (TA2), and 2.56 (LA), which are all much larger than those of Bi2Se3 (calculated as 1.17, 0.73, and 1.90 for TA1, TA2, and LA, respectively). The large γ values of O-BiSbSe3, especially for the LA, indicate considerable lattice anharmonicity, which will largely suppress their heat transport capability. The significant lattice anharmonicity in O-BiSbSe3 is presumably due to the weak chemical bonding15 or strong phonon-orbital interactions (Sb lone pairs).36 Therefore, the anomalously low κL of orthorhombic (Bi,Sb)2Se3 can be traced back to the weak inter-chain interactions, which result in low phonon velocity and large lattice anharmonicity.
In summary, due to the R–O structural transition, significant variations in the electronic band structure and lattice dynamics result in a high α and low κL value of orthorhombic (Bi,Sb)2Se3, making it a promising candidate for thermoelectrics. When undoped, the low Fermi energy and thus low electrical conductivity limit the thermoelectric figure of merit to ∼0.1 (shown in Fig. S4(f), ESI†). Thus, in order to improve the thermoelectric properties, proper doping to regulate the Fermi level, such as using iodine at the Se sites, was carried out.

Thermoelectric properties of iodine-doped (Bi,Sb)2Se3

Electrical transport properties. 
To increase the carrier concentration and lift the Fermi level into the conduction band, an appropriate amount of iodine was doped at the Se sites. Here we chose two Sb compositions to improve their thermoelectric properties: two-phase Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 and pure orthorhombic BiSb(Se1−yIy)3 (y = 0–0.03). We have tried the compositions with higher Sb contents but failed to increase their electrical conductivity to a suitable range for efficient thermoelectrics (>104 S m−1 at 300 K). The powder XRD of Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 and BiSb(Se1−yIy)3 (y = 0–0.03) are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 shows a mixture of two phases, and the doping limit of iodine is ∼3 mol% (SbSeI will appear in samples with more iodine). For BiSb(Se1−yIy)3, only an orthorhombic phase can be identified, and no impurity phase associated with iodine appears for y ≤ 0.03. The BSE images of the carefully polished surfaces are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and the samples are densified without open pores, consistent with the high relative densities. The Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 samples show the Bi-rich rhombohedral phase (white) embedded in the matrix of the Sb-rich orthorhombic phase, while the BiSb(Se1−yIy)3 samples are phase pure without any detectable impurities.
The temperature dependences of the electrical transport properties of Bi2−xSbx(Se1−yIy)3 (x = 0.8 and 1.0, y = 0–0.03) are shown in Fig. 5. The undoped Bi2−xSbxSe3 samples (x = 0.8 and 1.0) show very low σ values of ∼200 S m−1 at 300 K, mainly due to the low carrier concentrations. A low carrier concentration indicates a significant charge compensation or defect annihilation, as shown in defect eqn (1) and (2). Iodine-doping effectively increases σ to 2.5 × 104 S m−1 for Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 and 1.6 × 104 S m−1 for BiSb(Se1−yIy)3 at 300 K, respectively. The maximum σ values are both achieved for the 2 at% iodine-doped samples, and a further increase in the iodine-doping content decreases the electrical conductivity. In the measured temperature range, the σ value of the doped samples decreases with increasing temperature, and no obvious bipolar conduction was observed. As mentioned, the dominance of the orthorhombic phase in carrier transport considerably increases α, due to the increased band degeneracy and band mass. Iodine-doping decreases α but mitigates the bipolar effect at high temperatures due to the increased carrier concentration,65 and the highest α values reach ∼230 μV K−1 and ∼280 μV K−1 at 800 K for Bi1.2Sb0.8(Se1−yIy)3 and BiSb(Se1−yIy)3, respectively. Consequently, the power factors (PF = α2σ) are improved by an order of magnitude with iodine-doping, and the maximum value is ∼6 μW cm−1 K−2 for 2 at% I-doped BiSbSe3, as shown in Fig. 5(c).

(a) Electrical conductivity, (b) Seebeck coefficient, (c) power factor, (d) carrier concentration, and (e) Hall mobility. (f) Electron effective mass as a function of reduced Fermi energy. The solid lines in (f) were calculated using the Kane model, using different parameters (band edge effective mass and band gap). 
To shed more light on the electrical transport properties, Hall mobility μH and electron concentration nH were measured, as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (e). The room temperature physical properties are also summarized in Table 2. Iodine-doping effectively increases the nH by orders of magnitude and also shifts the in-gap Fermi level deeply into the conduction bands. The maximum nH reaches ∼3.7 × 1019 cm−3 for 2 at% iodine-doped Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3 and ∼9.1 × 1019 cm−3 for 1 at% iodine-doped BiSbSe3. The undoped samples show low μH values, probably due to the significant conduction within the impurity levels, and the doped samples display decreased μH with increasing nH. As shown in Fig. 5(d), nH slightly increases with temperature, typical for Bi2(Te,Se)3-based materials,21 and no obvious bipolar conduction is observed in the measured temperature range (300–625 K). μH decreases gradually with increasing temperature, and roughly has temperature exponents of ∼−1 to −1.5. This indicates the predominance of acoustic phonon scattering in electron transport, and the deviation in the temperature exponent from −1.5 is mainly due to the alloying scattering (with a temperature exponent of −0.5) or increased carrier degeneracy.74 Surprisingly, the pure O-BiSbSe3 samples show much lower μH values compared with those of the two-phased Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3, without the extra carrier scattering by the phase boundaries. The major origin of the μH difference is due to the band structure variations, as indicated by the quite different DOS m* values for the two serials of samples. The calculated m*, shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4(f), increases gradually when shifting EF deep into the conduction band. The nonparabolic Kane model was used to explain the m* variation with η using the equation m* = mCBM(1 + 2ηkBT/Eg), where mCBM is the effective mass at the conduction band minimum and kB is the Boltzmann's constant. The fitted mCBM and Eg are 0.2 m0 and 0.1 eV for Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3, and 1.5 m0 and 0.25 eV for BiSbSe3. Here, for Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3, the presence of the rhombohedral phase (<40% in volume) still contributes largely to the carrier transport due to its low effective mass and thus high electron mobility. The heavy band of the O-phase, as indicated in Fig. 3(b), causes large m* and low μH. The large m* and increased band degeneracy enable high Seebeck coefficients and thus moderate power factors, though leading to low μH values.

Thermal transport properties. 
The temperature dependence of the thermal properties of Bi2−xSbx(Se1−yIy)3 are shown in Fig. 6. The room temperature κ values of Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3 and BiSbSe3 are ∼0.7–0.8 W m−1 K−1 and ∼0.65 W m−1 K−1, respectively. The κ value of both series of samples decreases gradually with increasing temperature, and no bipolar thermal transport is observed, mainly due to the large band gaps. The κL value of ∼0.6–0.7 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K is rather low, comparable to many important thermoelectric materials, such as nanostructured (Bi,Sb)2Te3,75 and Zn4Sb3,41etc. The temperature dependence of κL roughly follows T−0.6, as displayed as the dotted line in Fig. 6(b). The κL ∝ T−0.6 trend indicates the predominance of phonon–phonon interactions, and the deviation from typical κL ∝ T−1 is probably due to additional point defect scatterings. The minimum thermal conductivity κmin of BiSbSe3 can be estimated using the calculated phonon velocities of three polarizations (vTA1 = 1324 m s−1, vTA2 = 1844 m s−1, and vLA = 3097 m s−1), and the calculation details can be found elsewhere.15,76 The estimated κmin value is ∼0.36 W m−1 K−1, shown as the dashed line in Fig. 6(b). The κL value of BiSbSe3 at high temperatures is close or even lower than the κmin, indicating a very strong phonon scattering. We have examined the microstructure of O-BiSbSe3 and did not observe any refined microstructure (e.g. nanostructures). The very strong phonon scattering in O-BiSbSe3 is intrinsic and originates from the multiple characteristics of the material, including point defects, soft bonding, and lattice anharmonicity, as discussed above.

Dimensionless figure of merit ZT. 
The temperature dependences of the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of iodine-doped Bi2−xSbxSe3 are shown in Fig. 7(a). Iodine-doping effectively improves the ZT due to the efficient shifting of the Fermi level, which further increases the electrical conductivity and power factor. The maximum ZT reaches 1.0 at 800 K for the 2 at% iodine-doped O-BiSbSe3, which is comparable to the best values in n-type Bi2Te3 based materials.20,21,77,78 This value is about three times that of optimized Bi2Se3, primarily attributed to the phase transition induced modulations in electronic and phonon structures. The increased DOS effective mass in the orthorhombic phase originates from the increased valley degeneracy and flattened band, giving rise to high Seebeck coefficients and thus improved power factors. Meanwhile, the bond softening and the resulting low phonon velocity and large lattice anharmonicity cause strong phonon scatterings, leading to very low thermal conductivities. Furthermore, the absence of rare element Te and reasonably high ZTs make O-BiSbSe3 a promising candidate for practical applications. Moreover, the mature industry of Bi2Te3-based materials would be easily transferable to commercialize (Bi,Sb)2Se3 based materials. The maximum ZT of two phase Bi1.2Sb0.8Se3 is ∼0.7, and this lower ZT is mainly due to the low ZT of the rhombohedral constituent. In particular, (Bi,Sb)2(Te,Se,S)3-based materials have been proposed for low-intermediate temperature or multistage power generations, besides their traditional cooling applications. Fig. 7(b) shows some of the recent progress in n-type (Bi,Sb)2(Te,Se,S)3-based materials.20,22,25,26,78,79 Although superior ZTs of 1.1–1.2 at 300–500 K have been reported for Te-rich Bi2(Te,Se)3,20–23 it is obvious that the Te-free O-BiSbSe3 shows a superior ZT at higher temperatures, mainly due to its large band gap and the structural phase transition induced favourable electronic and phonon features.
 Fig. 7  (a) Temperature dependences of ZT for iodine-doped Bi2−xSbxSe3 and (b) ZT advances for n-type (Bi,Sb)2(Te,Se,S)3 based materials for cooling and low-mid temperature power generation applications.20,22,25,26,78,79 
Further enhancement in the ZT of O-BiSbSe3 is mainly challenged by the low carrier mobility of ∼10 cm2 V−1 s−1, due to the heavy band and appreciable defect scattering. Considering the strong anisotropies in the Fermi surface (insets in Fig. 3(b)) and thus transport properties, we believe that along some specific crystalline directions, e.g., b-axis, the single crystals or textured polycrystals may show higher ZT due to the in-chain carrier transport and minimized carrier scatterings. A similar case can be found in orthorhombic SnSe with chain-like structures.17,18 Moreover, if one looks at the band structures of O-BiSbSe3 as shown in Fig. 3(b), the p-type would show even higher ZT considering the convergence of multiple valence valleys. The multiple valleys located in the regions of Γ–Z, T–Y, and Γ–Y would simultaneously contribute and thus lead to a high DOS effective mass and high α. A similar prediction has been made for p-type Bi2Se3,33 and the major challenge would be how to effectively move the Fermi level down to the valence bands. Compared with strong n-type Bi2Se3 with high-density native defects, O-BiSbSe3 already shows an in-gap Fermi level, and proper doping at the Bi sites, for example by using Ca, Sr, or Ag, etc.,31 could possibly move the Fermi level down into the valence bands. Further investigation is encouraged to verify these concepts.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated in the present study that a high thermoelectric figure of merit of ∼1.0 can be achieved for Te-free Bi2−xSbxSe3 polycrystals through modulating the crystal structure by varying the Sb content and the carrier concentration via iodine doping. With increasing Sb content, the Bi2−xSbxSe3 system persists with a rhombohedral Bi2Se3 structure for the Bi-rich compositions (x < 0.5), then the orthorhombic phase pertaining to Sb2Se3 appears for x ≥ 0.5 (two-phase region), and finally it transforms to the orthorhombic single phase while x ≥ 1.0. The composition-induced structural phase transition largely alters the electronic and phonon properties, giving rise to a three-fold increase in ZT. The structural transition substantially increases the DOS effective mass, mainly due to increased band degeneracy and band mass; meanwhile, the accompanying bond breaking and elongation effectively soften the chemical bonding and thus bring about the phonon damping and anharmonic lattice vibrations. These features result in an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and ∼0.3 W m−1 K−1 at 800 K for O-BiSbSe3. The high Seebeck coefficient and low κL ensure a high thermoelectric figure of merit of O-BiSbSe3 even with low mobility values, making it a promising candidate for low-mid or multistage power generation applications. In addition, the strategy utilizing structural transition induced modifications in electronic and phononic structures could be a new avenue to improve the thermoelectric properties of current materials and/or identify new thermoelectric material systems.

Broader context
Thermoelectric technology, capable of direct conversion between heat and electricity, could be an important component to new clean energies, due to its potentially advanced applications in recovering various waste heat from industrial segments and automobile exhaust, or as an efficient alternative to the current mechanical cooling. Large-scale applications, however, are hampered by the low efficiency of current thermoelectric materials, high cost, and earth rarity of some major constituents, especially Te (ninth least abundant element in the Earth's crust) which is an essential constituent in many important thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3 and PbTe. Te-free Bi2Se3, well-known as a three-dimensional topological insulator, could be an affordable alternative to Bi2Te3 or used for low-mid temperature power generation applications. Nevertheless, its low thermoelectric properties (ZT ∼ 0.3), primarily due to its single-degenerate band conduction, largely limit its practical applications. Here, we demonstrated in Bi2Se3 that crystal structural transition induced modifications in electronic and phonon structures largely improve the thermoelectric figure of merit to ∼1.0, mainly due to simultaneously converged multiple conduction valleys and significantly intensified phonon scatterings. Our strategy of structural distortion and bond softening driven band convergence and phonon softening, stemming from the structural phase transition, can be applied to other materials to further improve their thermoelectric properties and also shed light on identifying new materials.
