Our hybrid functional calculations reveal that Ba, Sb and N vacancies, and N interstitials become major point defects in Ba3SbN. Conversely, other interstitials and antisites have large formation energies and their concentrations are controllable. Herein, defect levels and configuration coordinate diagrams for the major defects are analyzed, thereby revealing that defect-assisted carrier recombination is ineffective.

By elucidating the stability of the intrinsic defects of Ba3SbN and their impacts on the carrier capture process, this work will pave the way for the development of a new class of high-performance solar cells based on antiperovskite semiconductors.
1. Introduction
Solar-energy harvesting using photovoltaics (PV) is as a promising route to mitigate global warming and growing energy demands.1–4 The development of efficient PV cells is dependent on semiconductors with strong solar spectrum absorption and good photophysical properties. Commercialized PV cells rely on bulk Si for light absorption because of low material cost and reliable processing techniques.4 However, the indirect nature of the Si band gap results in an inefficient absorption of visible-light; thus, Si is an unsuitable material for use in thin-film solar cells. Alternative compound semiconductors with direct band gaps, such as GaAs5 and Cu(In,Ga)Se2,6 have been studied for the fabrication of thin-film solar cells. However, the high material and processing costs limit the application of these solar cells.2
To develop high-performance and versatile thin-film solar cells, lead halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3 have been extensively investigated over the last decade.7,8 These materials have suitable direct band gaps for visible-light absorption, and desirable photophysical properties, such as long diffusion lengths of photocarriers. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells using lead halide perovskites has rapidly increased from 3.8% first reported in 2009 to over 25% now.9,10 However, the actual application of the perovskite solar cells has been hindered by material instability associated with the presence of an organic component such as methylammonium (CH3NH3) and Pb toxicity.11,12
Antiperovskite compounds with chemical formula X3BA, where A and B are anions and X is a cation, have garnered significant interest for diverse applications. The physical properties of antiperovskites are easily tunable through composition modification, thus resulting in a variety of characteristics, including high ionic conductivity, semiconducting properties, ferromagnetism, and superconductivity.13–20 For PV applications, various antiperovskites and their derivative compounds such as Ba3SbN,15 Mg3SbN,19 Ca6NPSb2,16 Ca6CSe4,21 and Ba4Sb2O22 were suggested as potential photoabsorbers from quantum-mechanical first-principles simulations. These materials are predicted to possess direct bandgaps enabling significant visible-light absorption. In addition, their electron and hole effective masses are sufficiently low to exhibit high carrier mobility; thus, the photocarriers are favored to reach adjacent electrical contacts. Among the antiperovskite compounds, the synthesizability of Ba3SbN,23 Mg3SbN,24 and Ba4Sb2O25 has been verified experimentally, and previous optical measurements have proved favorable visible-light absorption of Mg3SbN.24
On the other hand, unlike bulk properties, point defects of antiperovskites that can critically affect the device performance in applications have been rarely explored so far. In solar cells, point defects of a photoabsorber can deteriorate the solar-cell performance by serving as Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination centers.26 In addition, the point defects determine the Fermi level of the photoabsorber (i.e., the electrical doping), which is important information to design a solar cell.27 As such, an understanding of the point defects is the key to develop antiperovskite solar cells with superior performance.
In this study, a theoretical investigation of intrinsic defects in the hexagonal antiperovskite Ba3SbN, a promising lead-free semiconductor for photovoltaics, is conducted. Hybrid functional calculations are performed and reveal that Ba, Sb and N vacancies, and N interstitials have low formation energies (<1 eV), regardless of the growth conditions, thus indicating that their concentrations are large and difficult to control. Conversely, other interstitials and antisites have large formation energies and strongly depend on the growth conditions. Through defect level analysis and configuration coordinate diagrams, defect-assisted recombination is demonstrated to be ineffective on the major point defects, i.e., the vacancies and nitrogen interstitials. Thus, Ba3SbN can be a defect tolerant semiconductor with excellent optoelectronic properties despite the presence of intrinsic defects. By examining the stability of the intrinsic defects of Ba3SbN and their impacts on the carrier capture process, this study aids in the development of a new class of high-performance solar cells based on antiperovskite semiconductors.
2. Computational methods
We use the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with projector-augmented wave pseudopotentials28,29 to perform density functional theory calculations. A cutoff energy of 500 eV is employed for the plane-wave basis set. For the electron–electron interaction, a hybrid functional based on the Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06) method30,31 is used with a conventional fraction of Fock exchange (25%) which yields the electronic properties comparable with those obtained from the GW-based many-body calculation.15 The defect properties are investigated using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 16 formula units of Ba3SbN. The Brillouin zone is sampled employing the Γ point. We take into account spin polarization. We do not consider spin–orbit coupling (SOC), but its effect on the atomic and electronic structure was found to be insignificant (the band gap decreases by only ∼0.1 eV due to SOC).
The formation energy (Ef) of a defect in the charge state q (Dq) is evaluated as32 (1)where Etot(Dq) and Etot(bulk) are the total energies of a supercell with and without Dq, respectively, ni is the number of atoms of type i added into (ni > 0) and removed from (ni < 0) the supercell to form the defect and μi represents their chemical potential. EF is the Fermi level with respect to the valence band maximum (VBM). Finite-size effects on the total energies of charged defects are fixed using the monopole and band-alignment correction schemes.33,34
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk properties
Ba3SbN adopts a hexagonal phase with the space group P63/mmc, as seen in Fig. 1. In this structure, a N ion has octahedral coordination with six Ba ions, and Sb ions are located on the same crystal planes with Ba ions in the c direction. Fig. 2a shows the electronic band structure. Ba3SbN is a direct-gap semiconductor with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and VBM at the Γ point. The HSE06 calculation predicts a band gap of 1.41 eV that is close to the ideal Shockley–Queisser value (approximately 1.3 eV) for single-junction solar cells.35 The electronic density of states of Ba3SbN is plotted in Fig. 2b. It is seen that electronic states around the CBM are mainly derived from Ba 5d states, whereas those near the VBM have mostly Sb 5p and N 2p characters. These band characters indicate that Ba acts as 2+ cations, while the others act as 3− anions. In Table 1, we present the calculated lattice parameters of Ba3SbN that are in good agreement with experimental data.23

3.2. Native defects
The formation energy of a defect depends on the chemical potentials μi that reflect the growth conditions in experiments. Herein, μi is referenced to the energy per atom of each element in the corresponding standard phase under ambient conditions: cubic Ba (Imm), trigonal Sb (Rm), and N2 gas. The thermodynamic stability condition for the compound restricts the variation of μi (Δμi) as: 3ΔμBa + ΔμSb + ΔμN = ΔHf(Ba3SbN),(2)where ΔHf(Ba3SbN) is the formation enthalpy of Ba3SbN that is provided in Table 2. The upper bound of Δμi should be zero to avoid the formation of the corresponding elements. In addition, there are several binary phases that can be formed under ambient conditions: Ba2Sb3, Ba5Sb3, Ba5Sb4, BaSb2, BaSb3, Ba2N, Ba3N, BaN2, and BaN6. The prevention of the formation of these binary phases further limits the range of Δμi as aΔμBa + bΔμSb ≤ ΔHf(BaaSbb),(3) aΔμBa + bΔμN ≤ ΔHf(BaaNb),(4)where a and b are the number of Ba and Sb (or N) atoms comprising the binary phases, respectively. The formation enthalpies of the binary phases are listed in Table 2. These conditions determine the relevant range of Δμi to be considered, as shown in Fig. 3. Herein, the focus is on two sets of chemical potentials: (1) [ΔμBa = 0 eV, ΔμSb = −3.28 eV, and ΔμN = −1.25 eV] and (2) [ΔμBa = −0.93 eV, ΔμSb = −1.58 eV, and ΔμN = −0.15 eV]. For the purpose of presenting our results, we refer to the conditions (1) and (2) as Ba-rich and Ba-poor conditions, respectively.

In the present work, we consider all types of intrinsic point defects, namely, vacancies (VBa, VSb, and VN), interstitials (Bai, Sbi, and Ni), and antisites (BaSb, BaN, SbBa, SbN, NBa, and NSb). Their atomic structures in the neutral state are provided in Fig. S1–S3 in the ESI.† Note that all atomic sites for each element are symmetrically equivalent, and thus, there is only one relevant vacancy and antisite for each defect type. For the interstitials, we initially locate the anion interstitial (Ni or Sbi) at a site corresponding to a fractional cooridnate (0, 1/2, 1/2) in the primitive cell surrounded by four Ba cations, considering the electrostatic interaction. We also tested another interstitial site with the (2/3, 1/3, 3/4) coordinate, where the interstitial atom is surrounded by three Ba ions. However, the former gives rise to lower energies. For the Ba interstitial, because of its large size, we initially locate a Ba atom at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) with two Sb anion neighbors. We present the defect formation energies of the vacancies and interstitials in Fig. 4(a) and (c) and those of the antisites in Fig. 4(b) and (d). The slope of the lines stand for the most stable charge state at a given Fermi level and the Fermi level at which the slope changes is called charge transition level between two charge states.32
 Fig. 4  Formation energies of vacancies and interstitials: (a) Ba-poor and (c) Ba-rich; and antisites: (b) Ba-poor (d) Ba-rich. 
The anion vacancies and cation interstitials (namely, VSb, VN, and Bai) act as n-type dopants that are stable in positive charge states at the Fermi level within the band gap. In particular, their neutral states are relatively unstable, indicating that they are effective electron donors. Meanwhile, VBa, Sbi, and Ni work as effective electron acceptors that largely prefer negative charge states in the given range of the Fermi level. Unlike the vacancies and interstitials, the behavior of antisites is complex. NSb does not produce defect levels above the VBM owing to the lower energy of N 2p states compared with that of Sb 5p states. Consequently, NSb is stable only in the neutral state. Unlike NSb, SbN in the neutral state produces a doubly occupied electronic level above the VBM. When the Fermi level is sufficiently low, the electrons at the defect level can transfer to the bulk and reduce their energy. SbN is thus stable in a positive charge state for the Fermi level below the midgap. For SbBa and NBa, the Sb and N ions substituting a Ba ion exhibit a tendency to chemically bond with lattice N ions, thereby forming N–Sb–N and N–N–N configurations, respectively (Fig. S3c and e, ESI†). Consequently, they do not serve as acceptors that can capture up to three electrons. Instead, the defects in the neutral state produce a singly occupied electronic level inside the band gap. Therefore, SbBa and NBa are stable in the 1+ and 1− charge states because an electron is donated to and accepted from the host at low and high Fermi levels, respectively. On the other hand, BaSb and BaN can exist in positive charge states, which indicates that they act as electron donors.
The equilibrium Fermi level (EeqF) in a semiconductor is determined to fulfil the condition of charge neutrality among charged defects and carriers (electrons and holes).32 Given the formation energies of the defects in Fig. 4a and b, the EeqF of Ba3SbN grown under Ba-poor conditions is expected to occur in the midgap region where the formation energies of VN2+ and VBa2− are the same because their concentrations dominate those of other charged species. In this case, therefore, the charge neutrality condition is approximated as , where [M] is the concentration of M species. Under Ba-rich conditions (Fig. 4c and d), the EeqF is expected to develop near the CBM and charge neutrality is accomplished by balancing the concentrations of VSb+, VN+, VBa2−, and free electrons, namely . Our discussion on the EeqF above indicates that intrinsic Ba3SbN is likely to exhibit n-type conductivity, and the free electron concentration increases as the synthetic conditions approach Ba-rich environments.
3.3. Defect-assisted carrier recombination
Point defects can deteriorate the PCE of solar cells by serving as SRH recombination centers. To identify critical defect types, the concentration of a given defect and the rate of carrier capture at the defect site must be known.36 Among the intrinsic defects of Ba3SbN, the vacancies (VBa, VSb, and VN) have low formation energies at the EeqF, regardless of the growth environments (Fig. 4a and c). Of the interstitial defects, Ni is the most stable species with low formation energy under n-type conditions. These results imply that the vacancies and nitrogen interstitials will be major point defects in Ba3SbN films that are difficult to control. Meanwhile, the formation energies of the other interstitials and antisites are relatively large (Fig. 4b and d) so that their concentrations will not be significant. Moreover, their formation energies depend strongly on the growth conditions. Thus, their concentrations can be minimized, thereby reducing their impact on the device performance, by choosing an appropriate synthesis method.
We further analyze the carrier-capture process at the vacancies and nitrogen interstitials. The rate of carrier capture at a defect site depends on the energy positions of thermodynamic defect levels, including the impact of lattice relaxation. Such defect levels correspond to transition levels between two successive charge states.36 Because SRH recombination involves consecutive capture of an electron and a hole by a defect, typically in a nonradiative manner, a defect with its state near the midgap region tends to become more effective SRH centers; the capture process at such a defect can be efficient for both an electron and hole carrier. In Fig. 5, we present the defect levels for VN, VSb, VBa, and Ni that appear inside the band gap. VSb is thought to be a more critical recombination center compared with the others because it develops a single defect level near the midgap. Meanwhile, the other defects produce defect states close to the band edges. In particular, VBa produces two defect states below the midgap. Therefore, VBa captures holes efficiently, whereas electron capture will be far slower.37 As a result, VBa is likely to be stuck in a neutral state, implying that it will not be an effective SRH center.
 Fig. 5  Thermodynamic defect levels of VN, VSb, VBa, and Ni inside the band gap. 
To investigate electron and hole capture into the (2+/+) level of VSb in more detail, we construct a configuration coordinate (cc) diagram, as shown in Fig. 6. In this diagram, the potential energy surfaces of VSb2+ and VSb+ are projected along the configuration coordinate Q with respect to that of VSb2+. Q is calculated using (5)where mα is the atomic mass of an atom α, Re;αd and Rg;αd are the atomic position of the excited and ground state, respectively. d denotes the three Cartesian directions. Q is a relative value, and one of the charge states of a given defect can be chosen as a ground state (for example, VSb2+ in Fig. 6).36 The solid lines in the cc diagram are parabolic fits to the calculated data (i.e., harmonic approximation). ΔE is the energy required for the electron transition from the VBM to the CBM. Thus, it coincides with the band gap of the material. The difference between the lowest energy of the VSb2+ and VSb+ + h states corresponds to the (2+/+) transition level. Enb and Epb denote the energy barriers for electron and hole capture into the (2+/+) level of VSb, respectively. From the cc diagram, we find that the barriers are excessively high (especially for electron capture); thus, nonradiative SRH recombination will be significantly inefficient at room temperature (∼25 meV). Such substantial energy barriers are attributed to weak electron–phonon interactions in the vacancies because of weak chemical interaction of a Sb ion with the other elements (analogous to the interaction between A-sites and the other ions in conventional perovskites). As a result, the creation of a Sb vacancy and variation in the electron occupation of the vacancy site do not induce significant structural distortions. Furthermore, the probability of charge transfer between the band edge (CBM or VBM) and the defect state due to electron–phonon coupling is negligible, as inferred from very small and nearly constant overlap matrix elements along the configuration change (Fig. S4, ESI†).36 This occurs because of spatial separation of the host and defect states near the defect site; the VBM has Sb 5pz character and the CBM is derived primarily from the connection of Ba 5d states along the Ba ions on the same crystal plane (Fig. 7a and b, respectively). By contrast, the defect state is formed by the hybridization between Ba 5d orbitals pointing to the vacancy site (Fig. 7c). Therefore, nonradiative SRH recombination at VSb is extremely inefficient, and defect-assisted recombination is likely to occur in a radiative way which typically leads to very slow carrier-capture rate.

Because it is difficult to avoid significant formation of VN, the capture process of VN is worth investigating. Fig. 8(a) and (b) illustrates the cc diagrams for carrier capture into the (2+/+) and (3+/2+) levels of VN, respectively. It turns out that the energy barrier for electron capture is greater than that for hole capture at the (2+/+) level, as expected from the defect-level position closer to the CBM. The trend is reversed at the (3+/2+) level that lies near the VBM. The energy barriers for the rate-determining steps [i.e., hole capture at the (2+/+) level and electron capture at the (3+/2+) level] are smaller than that for the (2+/+) level of VSb by more than 1 eV. However, the electronic state of VN is formed by the hybridization of Ba 5d components towards the defect site (Fig. 7d), thus causing negligible wavefunction overlaps with the host states (Fig. S4, ESI†) along the configuration change. This implies that nonradiative SRH recombination at VN would not be critical. Overall, our above analysis manifests that the major point defects of Ba3SbN will not be crucial recombination centers that degrade the optoelectronic properties. In this context, Ba3SbN can be a defect tolerant semiconductor, enabling high-performance solar cells.

On the other hand, halide perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3 and CsPbI3 were also reported to be defect-tolerant semiconductors. Several factors such as the soft nature of the inorganic lattice, the formation of large polarons, reduced Coulomb screening due to local symmetry breaking and the dynamic ferroelectric effect, and lack of bonding–antibonding interaction between the conduction bands and valence bands were suggested as the origins of the defect tolerance of halide semiconductors.38,39 Unlike halide perovskites, the defect tolerance of Ba3SbN can be attributed to the orbital mismatch between the charge-trap levels produced by the major point defects and the band-edge state because such a mismatch reduces the charge transfer probability. In the case of VSb, the very weak electron–lattice coupling also plays a crucial role in delaying SRH recombination, and thus, it could be one of the factors that Ba3SbN becomes a defect-tolerant semiconductor.
There are other antiperovskite semiconductors such as Ca3SbN, Ca3PN, and Ba3BiN with suitable band gaps for photovoltaic applications.17 Among them, Ba3BiN is expected to be defect-tolerant because its atomic and electronic structures are analogous to those of Ba3SbN. To draw firm conclusions on the defect tolerance of these antiperovskites, however, thorough investigations are necessary. This will be the subject of our future research.
4. Conclusions
Using DFT calculations, we investigated intrinsic defects of hexagonal antiperovskite Ba3SbN. We showed that VBa, VSb, VN, and Ni will be major point defects with concentrations that are difficult to control. By examining thermodynamic defect levels, we illustrated that VBa and Ni are not important SRH recombination centers because their defect levels occur around the VBM. Detailed analysis of the cc diagram revealed that electron–phonon coupling at the VSb site was found to be very weak. In addition, electron–phonon matrix elements between the band-edge state (CBM or VBM) and the localized defect state are negligible for VSb and VN, indicating that nonradiative SRH recombination at these defects is inefficient. As a result, Ba3SbN can be a defect tolerant semiconductor. By offering deep insights into intrinsic point defects of Ba3SbN, this work will help develop a new class of high-performance solar cells based on antiperovskite semiconductors.
