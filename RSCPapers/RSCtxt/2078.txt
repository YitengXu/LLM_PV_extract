    , Accepted 31st July 2020First published on 31st July 2020AbstractHydrogen production from direct water electrolysis has long been pursued as a key that may revolutionize the hydrogen economy. With the rapid availability of electricity generated using renewable energy resources, this long-pursued target is now closer to reality than ever before. To date, most studies regarding electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are carried out in strong acidic/alkali electrolytes. However, hydrogen production from HER under extreme pH conditions has several drawbacks, including a corrosive working environment, the requirement of expensive anion/cation exchange membranes, and acidic/alkali withstanding electrocatalysts. The more sustainable approach to address these drawbacks is to deploy neutral/near-neutral electrolytes for HER. Regretfully, both theoretical discussions and practical applications regarding HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions are relatively rare and very elusive. In this review, we systematically discuss the current understandings of HER mechanisms under neutral conditions and analyze the influences of different types of neutral electrolytes. The most recent advances in the development of neutral HER electrocatalysts are summarized and exemplified, and general electrocatalyst design principles are highlighted. Lastly, we provide our perspective on the potential future research direction. We hope that this review inspires future endeavors to realize efficient HER for hydrogen production under neutral conditions.

1. Introduction
Hydrogen gas (H2) is a promising energy carrier due to its high energy density (between 120 and 142 MJ kg−1) and releasing water as a clean combustion product.1 H2 is also an indispensable raw material for several essential modern chemical industries, including petroleum refining (e.g., hydrocracking and desulphurization) and ammonia production. The annual global output of H2 was around 70 million tons in 2019, and the total H2 generation market is expected to be valued at over 150 billion US dollars in 2022.2,3 There are currently three main approaches to produce H2 industrially, including steam methane reforming, coal gasification, and water electrolysis.4,5 Both steam methane reforming and coal gasification involve the consumption of fossil fuels, leading to severe environmental pollution and intense global warming. This critical drawback contradicts the green vision of the hydrogen economy, that is, to power the world via a zero-carbon- and pollutant-emission approach. Besides, other limitations regarding the two approaches involve low productivity and impurity in produced H2, high energy consumption due to high pressure and temperature during the production process, and the requirement of sophisticated equipment.6,7 In contrast, producing H2 by HER via water electrolysis has long attracted interests because of its low pollution, fast production rate, mild reaction condition, and high purity (>99.999%).8 In recent years, the rapid development of electricity generation using renewable energy resources (e.g., solar energy and wind) has made H2 production by electrocatalytic HER an attractive option, which has attracted broad interests from both academic and industrial communities.9
In the backdrop of water electrolysis, the overall catalytic activity can be improved by optimizing electrocatalysts and electrolytes. Acidic electrolytes (e.g., H2SO4) are one of the most efficient electrolytes for electrocatalytic HER because they provide a high concentration of protons/hydroniums as reactants.10–13 However, acidic electrolytes may generate corrosive acidic fogs, which contaminate the produced H2 and corrode electrolyzers.1,4,14 Industrial electrolyzers often use alkaline electrolytes, for example, 20–30% KOH aqueous solutions.15 Although alkaline electrolytes help to produce high purity H2, they bring other issues.16 For example, electrolyzers using alkaline electrolytes require expensive anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which must be stable in alkali conditions and have a minimum gas crossover.8,15,17,18 Also, stable electrocatalysts in strong alkaline electrolytes are required. A viable approach to address the drawbacks of acidic or alkaline electrolytes is to deploy neutral or near-neutral electrolytes for HER, which has a series of superiorities: (1) they are mild and much less corrosive, so the corrosion of the water electrolyzer may be minimized; (2) electrocatalysts do not need to work in extreme pH conditions, and the choice of suitable electrocatalysts is substantially expanded in neutral conditions; (3) cell stacks employed in neutral HER are more environmentally friendly and safer for home usages;19 and (4) it is potentially feasible to directly split seawater (pH ∼ 8), which may reduce the overall cost of industrial-scale H2 production significantly.20 Additionally, neutral HER may be combined with photoelectrocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis, and many semiconductive photocatalysts or bacteria are only stable in neutral environments.21–25
In the last decades, tremendous breakthroughs have been made in electrocatalytic H2 production in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, and the results are well-summarized by many excellent review articles in this research domain.1,4,9,14 In comparison, so far, the understanding of HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes is far behind those in acidic and alkaline ones. Yet, increasing studies have been reported in recent years. A timely and comprehensive review dedicated to HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes is necessary to outline current fundamental principles and rationalize future research directions. Herein, we first introduce HER under neutral conditions and highlight its two distinct features, diffusion-controlled kinetics and switching of reactants. Next, we discuss the current understandings of the HER mechanism in neutral/near-neutral medium (pH 5–9), with special considerations paid to real working active sites. Subsequently, we highlight how different types of neutral electrolytes affect HER. The recent progress in the design and synthesis of noble metal-free electrocatalysts for HER in neutral electrolytes is further reviewed as per two predominant approaches: enhancing intrinsic catalytic activities and increasing active site density, with a general summary on catalyst components/structures and catalytic activity correlations. Last, based on the present attainments, the outlook of HER under neutral conditions and some potential research directions are proposed and discussed.
2. HER mechanisms under neutral/near-neutral conditions
Current theoretical studies suggest that HER takes place in two steps regardless of electrolytes or reactants (i.e., hydronium (H3O+) ion or water (H2O) molecule).1,4 The first step is called the Volmer step, in which electrons on the cathodic surface attract H3O+ or H2O from the electrolytes to generate an adsorbed H atom (H*) as a reaction intermediate:
Step 1: Volmer step:
In acidic conditions: H3O+ + e− + * ↔ H* + H2O(1)In alkaline conditions: H2O + e− + * ↔ H* + OH−(2)where * refers to an active catalytic site.
The second step involves H2 molecule formation via two different pathways. The first pathway is called the Heyrovsky step that takes place when the coverage of H* on the cathodic surface is low. In this pathway, H* is prone to combine with an additional electron and a new H3O+ ion (or H2O molecule) to form an H2 molecule as described below:
Step 2: pathway 1, Heyrovsky step:
In acidic conditions: H* + H3O+ + e− ↔ H2 + *(3)In alkaline conditions: H* + H2O + e− ↔ H2 + OH− + *(4)
The second pathway is a chemical desorption process termed as the Tafel step that occurs with a high H* coverage on the cathodic surface. In this pathway, two nearby H* combine to generate an H2 molecule as presented below:
Step 2: pathway 2, Tafel step:
In both acidic and alkaline conditions: 2H* ↔ H2 + 2*(5)
It is well-established that the H3O+ is the primary reactant in strong acidic electrolytes, whilst the concentration of H3O+ ions is too low in concentrated alkaline electrolytes, H2O molecules become the main HER reactant via an extra dissociation process.26,27 However, HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes is more complicated than that in strong acidic or basic electrolytes because of the participation of both H2O molecules and dissociated H3O+ ions (e.g., in buffer solution). In principle, unlike the single-step reduction (Volmer reaction) of H3O+ ions or H2O molecules taking place in strong acidic or alkaline electrolytes, respectively, HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes follows a two-step reduction process.19,21,28,29 As illustrated in Fig. 1a, H3O+ ions are the dominant reactant in the first reduction step, which takes place under low cathodic overpotentials approaching the equilibrium potential (i.e., 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). At this initial stage, the electrochemical reaction rate is comparatively slow so that the low concentration of H3O+ ions in neutral electrolytes can sustain the reaction. With the increase of cathodic overpotentials, the rapid consumption of H3O+ ions occurs near electrode surfaces, creating a pH difference between the region near the electrode surface and the bulk electrolyte. Consequently, the HER process turns to diffusion-controlled, and the reduction current reaches a plateau. It should be noted that the direct reduction of H2O molecules is thermodynamically unfavorable under the low overpotential because it would require an overpotential higher than what needed for the reduction of H3O+ ions.30 The second reduction step only occurs under higher overpotentials—the primary reactants in HER switch from H3O+ ions to H2O molecules. A monotonic increase in the reduction current appears afterward. Therefore, for HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes, the diffusion-controlled kinetics at relative low overpotentials and the switching of reactants (from H3O+ ions to H2O molecules) under high overpotentials are the two overwhelming features.

The above understanding can be credited to several pioneering studies. Conway et al. first reported the reactant switching from H3O+ to H2O molecule when the solution pH > approximately 5.33 Later, Katsounaros et al. investigated the mass-transport-induced pH variation at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces.31 They highlighted that even at moderate reaction rates, the pH of unbuffered or insufficiently buffered electrolytes near electrode surfaces is significantly different from that in bulk electrolytes, and this is more evident under the bulk electrolyte pH from 4 to 10 (see Fig. 1a). Takanabe's group then conducted comprehensive studies dedicated to investigating the HER electrocatalysis in several typical near-neutral pH solutions, suggesting that HER mechanisms depend on the type of reactants, electrolytes (buffered or unbuffered), and their concentrations.21,30,32,34 In a series of unbuffered 0.5 M Na2SO4 solutions with different pHs, they observed that the HER mechanistic switching of Pt electrode is independent of the type of supporting electrolyte but simply dependent on H3O+ activity (Fig. 1b). Different pH values lead to three regions for HER: a fast kinetics region (left, H3O+ ions are reactants), a slow kinetics region (middle, H2O molecules are reactants, HER activities are independent of the pH), and a thermodynamically driven region (right, the high pHs shift the thermodynamic potential of HER and generate sufficient overpotentials for the reduction of H2O molecules).21 Further, as shown in Fig. 1c, based on the theoretical diffusion-limited current density, the authors demonstrated that HER activity could be classified into three pH regions: acidic (1–5), neutral (5–9), and alkaline (9–13). In particular, the HER is significantly limited by insufficient H3O+ ions in the neutral region. Buffered electrolytes have been explored to provide steady H3O+ ion fluxes, which partially address the inadequate availability of H3O+ ions near electrode surfaces.31,35 However, Takanabe and co-authors revealed that overall HER performance in near-neutral buffered electrolytes is still predominantly governed by slow mass-transport of weak acid ions (e.g., phosphate ions), whilst the kinetic overpotential takes up the smallest portion (only around 10% in the entire concentration range from 0.2 to 4.2 M) among the considered overpotentials (i.e., kinetic and concentration overpotential, and ohmic potential drop) resulting from the mass-transport issue (Fig. 1d).32 This mass-transport phenomenon is dominated by the diffusion coefficient, which is in the function of electrolyte viscosity and effective ionic sizes, and the activity coefficient; hence proper electrolyte engineering should be carefully considered to minimize the non-kinetic overpotentials when adopting neutral buffered electrolyzer for improving HER activity.
Given the inevitable substantial overpotentials in both unbuffered and buffered neutral electrolytes via the Volmer step shown in eqn (1), an alternative approach to speed up HER is to increase the direct dissociation of H2O molecules via the Volmer step shown in eqn (2). Unfortunately, the explicit understanding of H2O molecule dissociation in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes during HER is still in its early infancy. Actually, even the limited available discussions were mainly derived or extrapolated from studies related to the pH-induced activity-drift (from acidic to alkaline electrolytes). The most perplexing aspect is that the HER activity in neutral and alkaline are almost totally different, though both cases are postulated to be subjected to the rate-determining step of water-dissociation (eqn (2)). While some studies reported that the HER activity of a given electrocatalyst is better in neutral electrolytes than that in alkaline counterparts,27,36,37 more other studies claimed the opposite.38–42 Overall, the present mechanisms for neutral HER remain highly debatable, as summarized in the following representative studies.
Conway et al. studied the state of chemisorbed H on a Pt surface based on the “volcano plot”.33,43 They proposed that weakly bonded overpotential-deposited (OPD) H species rather than strongly bonded underpotential-deposited (UPD) H species are reaction immediate in HER, and more OPD H on the Pt surface leads to higher HER activity. The surface coverage of OPD H is much lower in alkaline electrolytes than in acidic electrolytes, thus making the Volmer step the rate-determining step and, consequently, a slower reaction rate in the former. Following this, Yan's group proposed that hydrogen binding energy (HBE) can be used as a sole descriptor to explain the monotonically decreased HER activity of Pt-group metal catalysts in multiple buffer electrolytes with the pHs from 0 to 13 (see Fig. 2a and b).27,36 The HBE of the catalyst is larger in electrolytes with higher pHs, thereby resulting in an intermediate reaction kinetics of HER in neutral electrolytes (inferior to that in acidic electrolytes but superior to that in alkaline ones). They also suggested that hydroxyl (OH−) ions in electrolytes affect HER activity by tuning the HBE. Very recently, based on the results of surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, Shao et al. reported that the experimentally measured HBE is the synergistic consequence from the altered electric field, *H coverage, Pt–H2O, and *H–H2O interactions.44 The monotonously weakened HBE with increased pHs can contribute to the lower HER activity; the weakened Pt–H2O interactions in higher pH electrolytes can retard charge transfer, which is another reason for the slower reaction kinetics at high pH.

On the other hand, the HBE descriptor cannot interpret the catalytic behaviors of HER on well-defined Pt(111) surfaces.10 Markovic and Koper et al. argued that adsorbed hydroxyl (OH*) plays pivotal roles in determining the pH-induced HER activity drift, and the HBE is not the sole descriptor.10,26,29,45 Particularly, in alkaline solutions, their individual works demonstrated that the HER activity in alkaline electrolytes could be optimized from a delicate balance between H* adsorption rate and OH* desorption rate.10,26 Jia et al. further correlated the transport of OH* with alkaline metal cation (AM+) adducts in high pH electrolytes. They showed that HER kinetics could be affected by adjusting the identity types (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+) and concentrations of AM+.46 Nevertheless, as mentioned above, atomic and/or molecular level understanding of how these proposed theories work in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes is still quite elusive. Despite the controversies on detailed mechanisms, experimentally, combing Ni(OH)2 for the best OH* bond strength with Pt for optimal H* adsorption free energy (ΔGH*) has shown great success in boosting the HER activity in alkaline electrolytes (Fig. 2c). This bi-functional tuning approach has also been successfully extended to neutral electrolytes, highlighting a very promising strategy for accelerating neutral-HER kinetics (as discussed later in Section 4.1.4).
It is worth mention that caution should be exercised when extending the interfacial electrochemical principles/insights established on the well-defined single-/poly-crystal models to realistic nanoscale electrocatalysts since the microscopic catalytic behaviors of the nanocatalysts could deviate significantly from those of the bulk phase. For example, Qiao's group reported anomalous HER behaviors on the surface of nanostructured Pt/C catalysts.47 They found that the H adsorption peak on the bulk-phase Pt appears at higher potentials, and shifts higher with increasing pH. In contrast, the peak shifts to lower potentials with increasing pH on Pt/C, indicating that the H adsorption weakens (Fig. 2d). Based on in situ Raman spectroscopy and other electrochemical thermal/kinetic measurements, it was proposed that massive H3O+ intermediates generated from H2O dissociation in high pH electrolytes (i.e., 1 M or 0.1 M KOH) would create a unique acid-like local environment on the surface of nanostructured Pt/C, which facilitates the overall HER kinetics. In low-pH electrolytes (e.g., 0.01 M KOH or 1 M PBS solutions) or bulk materials surface, such an anomalous enriched H3O+ layer is absent, so a poorer HER activity was observed (Fig. 2e). Although this work did not consider the potential influences of the ionic strength (particularly the mass-transport limitation in the PBS electrolyte were not considered), the intriguing findings undeniably uncover the impact of the distinguished real working micro-structures/environments of nanocatalysts. In another study, Chen's group discovered that nanocatalysts might undergo composite transformation/evolution even under the mild reduction conditions in HER.48 Using Ni2P nanoparticle as a model catalyst, it was observed that Ni oxides/hydroxides would form spontaneously in strong basic electrolytes under applied cathodic potentials. The evolved Ni oxides/hydroxides will promote the water dissociation at high pH solutions and lead to improved HER activities, yet this effect is much weaker in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes. As a result, Fig. 2f shows that unlike monotonical cases from the bulk Pt foil, the measured HER activity on the Ni2P nanocatalyst was the lowest in neutral electrolytes. Obviously, the apparent HER current of such unstable catalysts can not reflect their intrinsic activity. In this context, identifying real active catalytic sites of metastable nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts (e.g., metal nitrides, chalcogenides, pnictides, and borides) is another significant issue that has to be carefully considered for rationalizing the design and development of intrinsic active HER catalysts.
In a nutshell, the exact mechanism of HER in neutral/near-neutral electrolytes is still a largely unexplored, highly controversial research domain that definitely deserves further investigations. Based on all the above summary, one possible reason for the distinct apparent HER activity upon the change of pH value is that many frequently adopted metrics (e.g., onset potential, overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (η10)) can be disturbed by the substantial mass-transport overpotentials, which hinder the evaluation of the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. Besides, the apparent current densities are often obscured by different microstructures (e.g., specific surface area, porous structure) of the electrocatalysts. The normalized current density based on the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), instead of the geometric area or the specific surface area, is more reliable to reflect the intrinsic activity of the catalysts, yet such normalization protocol is only well-used and benchmarked in recent studies. Moreover, the possible deviation of real micro-environments on nanocatalyst surfaces and the potential active site evolutions necessitate the delicate in situ techniques for precisely elucidating the HER mechanisms in (near-)neutral electrolytes. It is expected that future investigations with special attention towards these issues will hopefully underpin the understanding of the exact mechanisms of HER in neutral electrolytes, which eventually leads to competent efficiency of neutral HER.
3. Electrolytes for HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions
The exact neutral H2O contains no solute with a theoretical pH value of 7. However, when serving as electrolytes, pure H2O has extremely low conductivity. Thus, a tremendous additional potential is required apart from the energy for initiating water splitting. Therefore, in real working conditions, various solutes have to be added to pure H2O to increase ionic conductivity and maintain a relatively consistent pH environment. Accordingly, HER performance is strongly influenced by electrolytes in neutral/near-neutral conditions. Shinagawa et al. presented a comprehensive review of the electrolyte engineering for HER under acidic, alkaline, and neutral/near-neutral conditions.49 Readers can refer to this review for a detailed discussion on how the identity and molarity of ions in electrolytes differ under different conditions, as well as their influences on kinetics and mass transport of water splitting. In this section, we concisely summarize the distinct features of commonly used buffered and unbuffered neutral/near-neutral electrolytes and highlight their advantages/disadvantages. As a further extension, the unique challenges of HER in real seawater are also discussed.
3.1 Buffered neutral/near-neutral electrolytes
A buffer solution is an aqueous solution consisting of a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base (vice versa). As mentioned in Section 2, a key advantage of buffered electrolytes is their ability to sustain a near-constant H3O+ ion concentration (to maintain a given pH level) and enable the direct reduction of H3O+ ion, thus greatly facilitate HER. Generally, buffered electrolytes must be chemically stable under the redox potential where the water-splitting reaction occurs, and thus some organic buffers are not suitable. The most commonly used buffers for HER include phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH ∼ 7), borate buffer solution (BBS, pH ∼ 8.5), and sometimes (bi)carbonate buffer solution (CBS, pH 9.2 to 10.6).
A minimum concentration of 10−2 M of PBS was reported to be mandatory to pin the surface pH to the bulk value at reaction rates of up to 1 mA cm−2.31 This proposed value was determined by considering the mass transfer phenomena of the buffer electrolytes. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the mass transfer of a weak acid (HAH2PO4−) in the electrolyte can be described by Fick's law, following the eqn (6):32,34 (6)where b refers to the bulk phase of electrolytes, s refers to the surface of electrodes, i refers to HA or A−, ai is the concentration of the species, Ji is the diffusion flux, Di is the diffusion coefficient, and δi is the thickness of the diffusion layer. In conjunction with the Levich equation, which models the diffusion and solution flow conditions around a rotating disk electrode: jL = 0.062nFω1/2ν−1/6D2/3aiδi(7)where jL is the areal Levich current density, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the half-reaction, F is the Faraday constant, D is the diffusion coefficient, ω is the angular rotation rate, ν is the kinematic viscosity. The δi can be described as: δi = 1.62D1/3ν1/6ω−1/2(8)

(b) HER polarization curves on a polycrystalline Pt electrode in electrolytes containing different concentrations of phosphate buffers at pH = 5. Copyright ACS publication 2015.32 (c) ORR and HER performance of polycrystalline Pt electrode PBS electrolytes with different concentrations.51 Copyright ACS publication 2016. 
In this case, the cathodic current density would reach a limiting value under larger overpotentials (see the orange line in Fig. 1d). The overall overpotential depends primarily on the concentration overpotential and the overpotential caused by electrolyte resistance, rather than the kinetics overpotential.32 In particular, the electrolyte resistance (R) can be described by eqn (9): (9)where Kcell is the cell constant, μ is the viscosity of electrolytes, α is the effective ion size, z is ion valence, c is the electrolyte concentration, and F is Faraday constant. According to eqn (9), increasing electrolyte concentration would reduce electrolyte resistance, leading to enhanced HER activity. However, the viscosity of electrolytes would increase at higher electrolyte concentrations, resulting in higher electrolyte resistance. Therefore, the optimal concentration of buffered electrolytes depends on both factors. As shown in Fig. 3b, Shinagawa et al. reported that the optimal concentration of PBS is around 1.5 to 2.0 M under both experimental and simulative conditions.19,32,50 It should be noted that some researches argued that other than H3O+ ion, weak acid molecules may also serve as direct reactants for HER, but no clear evidence is currently available to support this assertion.32 Regardless of which are exact reactants, Shinagawa et al. proved that the above conclusions of optimal buffer electrolyte concentration remain general.
Another essential advantage of buffered electrolytes is the ability to inhibit oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This advantage stands out since, in practical water-splitting devices, pre-dissolved O2 would not be extruded from electrolytes as what is usually done in research lab experiments. Besides, O2 generated by oxygen evolution reactions (OER) at the anode may diffuse to the cathode, and then be reduced at the cathode surface in the HER potential range. Some HER electrocatalysts also contain active catalytic sites for ORR, which further enlarges the effect of ORR and decreases the HER faradaic efficiency. Shinagawa reported that the ORR catalytic activity of some transition metals (i.e., Mo, Ni, and Co) could be suppressed significantly in strongly buffered electrolytes.51 For example, the HER selectivity was larger than 90% in 1.8 M PBS electrolyte; in comparison, the selectivity was less than 80% in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.50 The suppression of ORR in buffered electrolytes was attributed to two factors. First, the solubility of O2 in buffered electrolytes (e.g., 0.54 mol m−3 in 1.8 M PBS electrolyte) is much lower than that in pure H2O (1.27 mol m−3). Second, the diffusion coefficient of O2 in buffered electrolytes is also smaller than that in pure H2O. At room temperature, diffusion coefficients of O2 are 0.69 × 10−5 and 2.0 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 in 1.8 M PBS and pure H2O, respectively.52
3.2 Unbuffered neutral/near-neutral electrolytes
The unbuffered system is closer to the nature of water splitting, in which water serves as the reactant, and the electrolyte only maintains conductivity. Besides, unbuffered electrolytes provide a reaction environment that is more analogous to that in targeted real seawater splitting.30,53 However, the swing of local pHs near electrode surfaces poses as the most significant challenge in unbuffered electrolytes. For example, H3O+ ions would be consumed rapidly during HER process, causing the pH near electrode surfaces to deviate substantially from that of bulk electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 3a, HER activity is also limited by the mass transfer in unbuffered electrolytes. Murthy et al. studied a series of transition metal-based electrocatalysts in an unbuffered 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.50 They found that the overpotential originated from the mass transfer of H3O+ ions counts for more than 90% of the total overpotential. All electrocatalysts in their study showed a current plateau in the unbuffered electrolyte at the overpotential around 0.3 V vs. RHE. In other cases, the concentration of H3O+ ions is too low, so that the reduction profiles always show negligible obvious stratified plateau but only a reduction current resulting from direct water reduction.53 Despite the poor apparent reaction kinetics, unbuffered neutral electrolytes can better reveal the intrinsic catalytic activity of a given electrocatalyst, which is valuable in evaluating the water dissociation capability of the electrocatalyst for direct reduction of H2O molecules. Thus, unbuffered neutral electrolytes still hold significance for fundamental studies.
3.3 Seawater
HER in seawater has aroused interest in developing large-scale H2 production because of the abundant availability of seawater.54 However, using seawater as electrolytes brings severe technical challenges. First, the relatively low salt concentrations in seawater provide poor ionic conductivity. Second, the drift of pH near electrode surfaces during HER causes mass transfer limitations for H3O+ ions. Third, the chloride ion oxidation reaction on the anode directly competes with OER, reducing faradaic efficiency for water splitting. Forth, alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., Ca2+ and Mg2+) in seawater can deposit on the cathode surface,20,55–57 which block active catalytic sites, resulting in electrocatalyst deactivation.58 For example, Lu et al. observed plenty of white residues after long-term electrochemical testing in seawater, as shown in Fig. 4a and b.59 In addition, the XPS spectrum also proves the existence of calcium, and magnesium salts (see the blue line in Fig. 4d), while these deposited metal salts can be cleaned by acid washing without the damage of the local structure of the electrode, as shown in Fig. 4c. The XPS analysis of the electrode after cleaning also indicated the entire elimination of calcium salts, and only a trace amount of magnesium salts were spotted on the electrode surface (see the red line in Fig. 4d). Overall, though a few technical challenges have been preliminarily addressed, using seawater as electrolytes for practical HER devices is far from reality.

4. Electrocatalysts for HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions
The key target of electrocatalysts is to expedite given reaction kinetics by lowering the reaction energy barrier. For neutral HER, the highly efficient catalyst is a matter of utmost urgency, as a result of the intrinsically more sluggish kinetics in neutral electrolytes than those of acidic and alkaline ones. To date, Pt series noble metal electrocatalysts display the highest catalytic activity for HER, few recent students have investigated their applications in neutral electrolytes. Most of the recent studies on noble metal catalysts have focused on developing composite catalysts to reduce the usage of noble metals in acidic or alkaline electrolytes.60 The lack of interest in exploring noble metal catalysts under neutral conditions may be due to the fact that the use of noble metal-based catalysts in large scale H2 production is restricted by the high cost and limited availability of noble metals on the earth, which contradicts the target of developing HER under neutral conditions for large scale and cost-effective H2 production. Along this line, noble-metal free electrocatalysts are more promising for realizing large scale HER under neutral conditions. In this section, we summarize recent advances in developing noble-metal free electrocatalysts for HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions. There are two general strategies widely used in the studies of these electrocatalysts, as shown in Fig. 5. One strategy is to enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity by tuning local structures of active catalytic sites. Standard methods include anionic tuning, cationic tuning, defect creation, and grafting water dissociation promoters (e.g., transition metal oxides/hydroxides). The other strategy is to increase the density of active catalytic sites per unit surface area or weight. Commonly used methods include loading catalytic species on three-dimensional (3D) large surface area conductive substrates (e.g., carbon materials or metal foams), generating 3D porous structures by using porous templates or assembling nanostructures. Some unique structures, such as core–shell or hollow spheres, were also explored. It should be noted that the two general strategies are not mutually exclusive. In fact, most of the recent works have combined several approaches in their catalyst designs to advanced catalyst design to gain favorable overall catalytic performances. However, in most studies, the authors usually highlighted one or two primary strategies as the key to the achieved catalytic performances. Hence, electrocatalysts reported in this section are classified based on the primary design strategy mentioned by the authors. The detailed design strategies of all the representative electrocatalysts discussed in the following are summarized in Table 1.

4.1 Enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of electrocatalysts

4.1.1 Anionic tuning. 
Several types of transition-metal compounds, such as metal phosphides, sulfides, nitrides, and borides, have been explored as electrocatalysts for HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions. The anionic components (e.g., P, S, N) in these transition-metal compounds can optimize 3d electronic structures of transition metals. Most anionic components have larger electronegativity than transition metals. Thus, they can serve as Brønsted or Lewis base centers to attract H3O+ ions or H2O molecules in HER, respectively. For example, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that P atoms on Ni2P(001) surface possess a negative charge of −0.07 eV, which act as bases to capture H3O+ ions, resulting in a moderate Gibbs free energy for H adsorption (ΔGH*) in the Volmer step (eqn (1)).61–63 Further, electron-rich anionic components may also promote the initial adsorption of H2O molecules via their electron-deficient H atoms, and subsequently, dissociate electron-rich H–OH bonds.39 We discuss the most widely studied transition-metal compounds below.
Transition-metal phosphides are the most commonly used electrocatalysts for HER under neutral conditions. The P atoms can attract electrons from metal atoms to form strong negative charged P sites, which capture positively charged H3O+ ions. Moreover, most of the metal phosphides have electronic structures similar to their metallic counterparts, thus guaranteeing an outstanding electroconductivity.1,48 These characteristics enable their high catalytic activities for HER. The first metal phosphides as electrocatalysts for HER in a neutral electrolyte was reported by Sun's group.64 They synthesized porous cobalt phosphide (CoPx) nanowires (Fig. 6a) via an in situ phosphidation of Co hydroxides (Co(OH)x) under a mild temperature. The CoPx catalyst displayed better HER activity than Co(OH)x in 1 M PBS electrolyte. The synthesis method of CoPx was further extended to synthesize Mo phosphides (MoPx).65,66 The as-synthesized MoPx electrodes have a similar local structure as that of CoPx. However, MoPx displayed higher HER activity than CoPx at the same pH conditions. The better catalytic activity of MoPx was attributed to its high electrical conductivity, which enabled efficient charge transfers at the interface of MoPx and the electrolyte. In another study, Xie and co-authors proposed to utilize phase junction of MoP2/MoP for efficient neutral HER. They suggested the synergy between MoP2 and MoP phases boosts HER, with MoP2 promoting H2O dissociation and MoP efficiently converting Had into H2 (see Fig. 6b).56,67 In 1 M PBS, their catalysts display a low onset potential (Eon) of 75 mV, a metric overpotential (η10) of 196 mV at 10 mA cm−2, together with a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec−1. The catalyst also outperforms Pt in natural seawater with ∼10% higher and more stable HER current density. Furthermore, Ni phosphide (NiPx), as one of the most commonly used HER electrocatalysts in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, is also investigated in neutral medium. Chen et al. studied the HER performance of NiPx nanospheres in 0.1 M acetate buffer electrolyte.68 Although HER activity of as-prepared samples is relatively poor due to the low electrochemical surface area (ECSA), their results showed that the NiPx species are highly stable during the electrochemical activation. To improve the catalytic performance of NiPx species, NiP2 cathode with nanoporous NiPx nanosheets (Fig. 6c) was then synthesized by in situ phosphidation of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets.69 Due to their highly accessible surfaces, NiPx nanosheets displayed much enhanced HER activity in 1.0 M PBS electrolyte comparable to those of the previously reported CoP and MoP electrocatalysts. Sun et al. also reported that W phosphide (WPx) is active for HER in neutral electrolytes.70 However, the activity of WPx is not high because of the severe sintering and aggregation of catalyst particles during its high-temperature calcination synthesis.

Metal sulfides represent as another main group of neutral HER catalysts. Early biochemical studies indicated that H+ could be converted into H2 using hydrogenase metalloenzymes.71 The active catalytic sites of metalloenzymes primarily consist of metal sulfides, such as Fe sulfides (FeSx) and Ni sulfides (NiSx), which delivered high turnover frequencies (TOFs) around 9000 mol s−1 per mole at room temperature under neutral conditions.72 However, direct coating metalloenzymes on electrodes failed to deliver good HER performance due to the instability of metalloenzymes. Inspired by metalloenzymes, metal sulfides were developed as HER electrocatalysts.4 The first metal sulfide electrocatalyst for neutral HER was reported by Giovanni et al., who prepared FeS cathode by directly coating FeSx nanosheets on the surface of glassy carbon electrodes.73 Although the HER performance was poor, the electrocatalyst was stable for 6 days in neutral electrolytes without physical destruction or significant activity loss. Jasion et al. synthesized a series of low-dimension FeS2 electrocatalysts to improve their HER activity, as illustrated in Fig. 7a.74 Organic ligands were used as dispersing agents to create large accessible surface area. The fabricated 2D FeS2 discs displayed current densities at the same order of magnitude as the benchmark Pt catalyst in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte. Alternatively, different from the single crystal species, Jiang et al. reported that HER performance could be promoted on NiSx multi-crystal facet.75 Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), they showed that amorphous Ni–S film was transferred to Ni3S2 during the electrochemical activation. Qin et al. further studied the influence of Ni3S2 on NiS electrocatalyst by adjusting NiS/Ni3S2 molar ratios.76 Their theoretical calculation showed that introducing Ni3S2 into NiS caused electron transportation from Ni3S2 to NiS, as shown in Fig. 7b. The electron-rich NiS would promote the adsorption of H3O+ ions, while anions were captured on Ni3S2. The molar ratio between NiS to Ni3S2 can strongly influence the activity, and the ratio of 1:1 was identified as the optimal ratio. Further, Mo disulfide (MoS2) is a special member of the metal sulfides family because its active catalytic sites are entirely different from other metal sulfides. Early studies showed that the bulk phase of MoS2 is almost inactive for HER.77 However, computational studies suggested that the edge of MoS2, particularly (1010) Mo-edge, should have a Pt-like H bonding energy.78 Subsequently, Saha et al. synthesized ultra-fine MoS2 quantum dots (see Fig. 7c) that represented a remarkably low Eon and a small Tafel slope in neutral electrolytes.79 The high catalytic property was attributed to the existence of unsaturated sulfur (S22−) ligands that increase the number of active MoS2 edges.

Some other metal compounds, such as metal carbides, nitrides, and borides, were also studied as electrocatalysts for HER in neutral electrolytes.80–83 For example, the introduction of C, N, and B atoms can also modify the electronic structure of parent metals, resulting in a contracted metal 3d-band. This makes the 3d-band structure of transition-metals similar to that of the benchmark Pt catalyst. Harnisch et al. studied W carbide (WxC) in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte.84 They proposed that the active catalytic phase in WxC is WC rather than W or W2C, because the HER activity increased significantly with the increasing molar fraction of WC. Sun's group prepared W nitride (WNx) by in situ nitridation of WO3 nanowire arrays.85 Carbon substrates were also involved in the synthesis, the nitridation produced N-doped carbon, which was proposed to bring synergistic efforts for improving HER activity. Two other studies also simultaneously created metal nitrides and N-doped carbon as electrocatalysts for HER.86,87 On the other hand, unlike the direct formation of metal nitrides, You et al. suggested that surficial N modification can optimize the surface electron distribution without changing chemical compositions of bulk parent metals.39 As shown in Fig. 8a, they indicated that the surface electron-abundant N atoms easily captured electron-deficient H atoms of H2O molecule, followed by the transportation of H atoms to the surface N atoms, hence promoting the dissociation of the HO–H bond. The DFT calculation suggested that the energy barrier of breaking the HO–H bond on the N-modified Ni(111) surface is much lower than that on a pure Ni(111) surface (Fig. 8b). Using Ni foam as a substrate, their optimized catalyst showed a low η10 of 64 mV, which was the best among those nonprecious electrocatalysts reported for neutral HER by the time when the work was published. Besides, the HER activity of Co boride (CoB) was also investigated.83 Different from the strong negative charged P or S atoms that can attract electrons from the parent metals, B atoms act as electron donors. Active catalytic sites may be created on the surface of Co by donating electron from B to Co, forming electron-rich Co sites (see Fig. 8c).

In general, the HER catalytic activity of metal compounds discussed above is poorer in neutral electrolytes compared to that in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Some studies have introduced a second anion to metal compounds in an attempt to further enhance their catalytic activity. For example, Xiao et al. reported that Co–P–B hybrids have higher activity than singular CoP and CoB.88 Wu et al. showed that the catalytic activity of MoS2@MoP heterojunctions is better than that of MoS2.89 Tan et al. suggested an acidic-/alkaline-like HER performance on the P-doped CoS nanoporous ribbons.90 To gain an atomic level understanding of second anions, Men and co-authors performed DFT calculations on the typical N-doped Co2P.91 The results suggested that both the ΔGH2O* and ΔGH* on N-doped Co2P (201) and (200) facets are superior to that of pure Co2P, as shown in Fig. 9a. Further, Yin et al. studied P-modified Co–N–MOF.92 They proposed that the electron transportation from CoP to Co–N-MOF via N–P/N–Co bonds, leading to the optimized ΔGH2O* and ΔGH* (see Fig. 9b). Despite the remarkable progress, it has to be emphasized that there is no definite evidence to support that introducing a second or even a third anion species would necessarily lead to a higher HER activity. A clear and general correlation of the interplay between different anions for neutral HER is yet to be defined; further combined studies from theoretical predictions and experimental validations are still imperative toward this fundamental issue.

4.1.2 Cationic tuning. 
Up to now, many studies have reported that electrocatalysts containing multiple metals have better HER activity than their single metal counterparts. Introducing additional metal cations creates overlapped metal 3d bands, thus may result in favorable electronic structures for H adsorption in HER. Theoretically, in conjunction with the classical “volcano plot,” the best HER electrocatalyst should locate at the top of the volcano plot and exhibit ΔGH* close to 0.93 Therefore, combing a strong adsorption metal on the left side of the volcano plot (e.g., Ni and Co) with a weak adsorption metal on the right side of the volcano plot (e.g., Cu) may dramatically moderate ΔGH*.94
A commonly used cationic tunning approach is to synthesize metal alloy compounds.6,95,96 Barber et al. first applied a metal alloy compound (Cu2MoS4) as an HER electrocatalyst in neutral electrolytes.97 However, both the catalytic activity and the stability of Cu2MoS4 are lower than Ni–Co alloys reported later. As a promising metal alloy compound for neutral HER, the Ni–Co–X (X = S, P, Se, and Te) alloy system displayed much higher catalytic activity than their corresponding Ni–X and Co–X.98–102 The improved catalytic performance of Ni–Co–X was attributed to the synergetic effect between Ni and Co atoms.103 Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 10a, Ni sites with stronger electronegativity facilitate the desorption of generated OH− in neutral electrolytes, whereas the Co sites with weaker electronegativity benefit the desorption of adsorbed H* to release H2 molecules. DFT calculations revealed that Ni–Co alloy compounds could greatly moderate both ΔGH2O* and ΔGH* (Fig. 10b).100 The calculated ΔGH* on Ni–Co alloy sites (0.20 eV) is much lower than that on Ni (0.72 eV), closer to that on Pt (0.09 eV) (Fig. 10c). Experimentally, Irshad et al. synthesized a Ni–Co–S alloy compound, which showed two distinct Tafel regions for HER in neutral electrolytes (Fig. 10d).104 They proposed that Ni–Co–S contained two types of active catalytic sites. The Tafel slope of 93 mV dec−1 in the low potential region came from HER on Co sites, and the Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1 at the high potential region from Ni sites. Following a similar strategy, other Co–M105–107 or Ni–M55,108–110 (M = Mo, Fe, W, and Ru) alloys were also studied as HER electrocatalysts in neutral electrolytes.

Doping metal electrocatalysts with other metal cations is another typical cationic tuning approach. The most commonly used metal cations are Fe family metals (period 4, VIIB & VIIIB groups), including Mn,57 Fe,111 Co,112 and Ni.113 For example, Sun's group synthesized Mn-doped CoP nanosheets, which retained the local orthorhombic CoP phase after the Mn doping.114 Doping Mn into CoP matrix can lead to charge transfer from Mn to Co, contributing to a more thermoneutral ΔGH* at Mn–Co–P sites. In particular, one Co atom could attract ∼0.38 electrons from an adjacent Mn atom according to the Bader charge theory. In HER, H3O+ ions would be firstly adsorbed on electron-abundant Co sites to form Co–H* bonds in the Volmer step, and extra electrons on the Co sites may weaken the Co–H* bonds and facilitate the formation of H2 molecules. Therefore, the observed ΔGH* on Mn–Co–P sites is more close to 0 than pristine CoP, according to the DFT calculations (Fig. 11a). Similarly, Fe-doped CoP electrocatalysts were also studied.115,116 Other than Fe family metals, Luo's group synthesized surface Pt-doped CoP nanotube arrays via electrochemical activation. Their Pt mass activity is four times larger than that of Pt/C catalyst in neutral electrolytes, as displayed in Fig. 11b.117 The outstanding HER was attributed to the synergic effect between bulk CoP nanotube arrays and atomic-scale dispersed surface Pt sites. Furthermore, Cu- and Zn-doped metal electrocatalysts for HER in neutral electrolytes were also reported.94,118

4.1.3 Creating defects. 
According to the second law of thermodynamics, a certain amount of disorders or defects are often inevitable in crystalline materials. The most common defects in electrocatalysts include intrinsic defects (e.g., voids/vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries) or edge sites (e.g., dangling bonds/groups). These defect sites rearrange local electronic structures, which alter adsorption/desorption behaviors, resulting in different catalytic activities. There are mainly two approaches to tune the HER activity of electrocatalysts via defects engineering. One approach is to create defects in catalyst substrates (e.g., carbon). For example, Zou et al. introduced defects on N-rich carbon nanotubes (CNTs) substrates by high-temperature thermal treatments.42 The presence of defects in CNTs increased the density of pyridinic-N species, which was proposed as highly active sites for HER, thus providing a synergic effect between pyridinic-N and Co (Fig. 12a). Their results also suggested that the existence of defects helped to expose catalytic active Co sites. The other approach is to directly create defects in the catalyst matrix. This strategy was demonstrated to be particularly efficient for MoS2-based electrocatalysts because sites in MoS2 are defects and edges rather than the bulk moiety. For example, Liu's group synthesized the Ni–MoS2 electrode, suggesting that Ni plays a key role in adjusting the intrinsic activity of MoS2.119 The incorporation of Ni atoms in MoS2 formed plenty of edge-exposed MoS2 nanosheets with a high density of defects, as shown in Fig. 12b. In contrast, no defects were observed on bare MoS2 nanosheets, and they more likely aggregated into crumpled balls. The defective Ni–Mo–S exhibited a decent HER activity with a η10 of 200 mV and much better stability than MoS2/C and Pt electrocatalysts.

4.1.4 Grafting H2O dissociation promoters. 
As discussed in Section 2, the direct reduction of H2O in neutral electrolytes requires a substantial overpotential, therefore, grafting suitable H2O dissociation promoters (as a co-catalyst) has been employed to create coupled catalytic sites to enable synergic effects, i.e., one site for the Volmer step and the other for the subsequent Heyrovsky/Tafel step. The coupled catalytic sites allow the optimization of individual catalytic sites, thus greatly expand the potential selection of combined electrocatalysts.120 For example, Markovic's group demonstrated that grafting metal oxides/hydroxides on electrocatalysts can promote water dissociation in alkaline electrolytes.121 The proposed mechanism was illustrated on a classical Pt(111)–Ni(OH)2 hybrid, as shown in Fig. 13a. An H2O molecule is first attracted to the interface between Ni(OH)2 and Pt, then Ni(OH)2 sites intensely interact with the electron-rich O atom of the H2O molecule, facilitating the dissociation of the H–OH bond. The dissociated H atom is absorbed on the nearby Pt to generate Had. Afterward, the Had combines with another Had to form an H2 molecule. The Tafel slope of pure Pt(111) surface is 116 mV dec−1 in alkaline electrolytes, which is close to the calculated 118 mV dec−1 of the Volmer step, suggesting that the Volmer step is the rate-determining step on Pt(111).10 In contrast, the Tafel slope on Pt(111)/Ni(OH)2 decreased to 41 mV dec−1, suggesting that the rate-determining step switched to the Heyrovsky step (39 mV dec−1), see Fig. 13b.

The inset illustrates an HER mechanism on Cu–Ni–CrOx in neutral electrolytes.25 Copyright Nature Publication 2019. 
The first M–MOx/M(OH)x electrocatalyst used for HER in neutral electrolytes is CoS–CoO/Co(OH)2 hybrid reported by Yang's group.122 Although CoO/Co(OH)2 was impurities formed during the preparation of CoS film, the hybrid catalyst showed high HER activity and long-term stability in 1.0 M PBS electrolyte. Later, other Co–CoO electrocatalysts were fabricated by post-oxidation of Co-based precursors. Due to synergistic effects between CoO and metallic Co, Co–CoO showed smaller charge-transfer resistances and lower energy barriers for H2O dissociation compared to its pure Co counterpart.123,124 Furthermore, apart from post-oxidation treatments, M–MOx/M(OH)x hybrid electrocatalysts can also be prepared by partially reducing metal oxide/hydroxide precursors. For instance, FeP–FeOx and Ni5P4–Ni2+δOδ(OH)2−δ hybrids were synthesized via partially reducing FeOOH and Ni(OH)2 in PH3 gas,125,126 and Cu/Cu2O was obtained by electrochemical reduction of Cu2O.127 In addition to binary M–MOx/M(OH)x, Sargent's group reported a ternary M1–M2–MOx/M(OH)x system to further optimize the HER performance in neutral electrolytes.25 They synthesized the Cu–Ni–CrOx ternary electrode which showed much enhanced catalytic activity than Cu–CrOx and Ni–CrOx binary hybrids. The high HER activity was attributed to the anisotropic doping of the metal surface, as illustrated in Fig. 13c. Ni and CrOx sites have strong Had and OHad binding energies, respectively, which can asymmetrically break H–OH bonds in H2O molecules, while Cu with a weak H binding energy can accelerate the coupling of H* to evolve H2 molecules. This unique ternary electrocatalyst delivered a very small η10 of 48 mV in neutral KPi buffered solution, representing as the best performance for non-noble metal-based HER electrocatalysts so far. Other similar ternary hybrids, such as Co–Ni–CrOx and Cu–CuOx–Pt, were also used as HER electrocatalysts under neutral conditions.128,129

4.2 Increasing the density of active catalytic sites
Increasing the number of active sites per unit surface area or per weight is another most significant strategy to increase the activity of a given catalyst. Actually, enhancing intrinsic activities and increasing the active site density are not mutually exclusive but are always adjusted simultaneously. The intrinsic active sites can be delicately tuned while structural engineering takes place to make the best use of the as-tuned active sites. In short, all the structural tuning methods can be summarized as making the otherwise planar catalyst–electrolyte interfaces to be stereoscopically different, which then increases the reactive sites on the interface. Here we summarize the most commonly used strategies in increasing the catalytic site density for HER under neutral conditions.

4.2.1 Using substrates with a large surface area. 
Carbon materials, such as carbon cloth (CC) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets, are often used as substrates for catalytic metal species because of their large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity (Fig. 14a). The large surface area helps to host more metal species, while the high electrical conductivity improves electron transfer. CC is a 3D porous carbon material made of small graphite fibers, whose properties depend on synthesis and activation methods. Graphitic CC has high durability and corrosion resistance. Upon suitable activation, hydrophilic functional groups introduced on the surface of CC assist the anchoring and dispersion of metal species. Many recent studies have directly synthesized metal species (e.g., Co, Mo, and Ni-based compounds) on the surface of CC in a variety of structures, including nanorods,64,130 nanowire arrays,131,132 and nanosheets.63,65,66,69,133 These metal compounds supported on CC displayed smaller charge transfer resistances than their unsupported counterparts, enabling faster electron transfer in HER. Alternatively, rGO nanosheets can serve as a substrate with a large specific surface area (theoretically up to 2630 m2 g−1). Further, rGO nanosheets can be dispersed in different solvents and can also be assembled into various 3D porous structures. Several recent studies reported metal electrocatalysts supported on rGO nanosheets with the specific surface area of ∼200 m2 g−1, thus allowing the catalyst to expose more active sites.88,134 Similarly, functional groups (e.g., –COOH) on rGO surface can anchor catalytic metal species and enable their good dispersion, which also contributes to a higher density of active sites.88

3D porous metal structures, such as metal foams and metal meshes, are also widely used as substrates for electrocatalysts because of large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and 3D integrated porous structures.123,135 As exemplified in Fig. 14b, some metal substrates, such as Ni, Fe, and Cu foams, can also be directly used as metal precursors to synthesize metal compounds,20,136–139 or couple with other metal salts in solutions to form metal alloys.20,25,87,100,140 Further, metal substrates may also provide synergistic catalytic effects. For example, Ni foam was utilized to synthesize Ni(OH)x, which facilitates H2O dissociation, while Cu foam was used to accelerate the coupling of H* to evolve H2 as discussed in Section 4.1.2.25


4.2.2 Fabricating 3D structures using templates. 
Templated 3D structures can be achieved via the template-assisted approach or the self-template method. Recently, metal–organic-frameworks (MOFs), as inorganic–organic hybrid materials containing metal centers and organic ligands, are widely used as templates to synthesize HER electrocatalysts with tuneable 3D porous structures. The structure parameters of MOFs such as pore size, ligand size, and components can easily be tuned by selecting different metal precursors and organic ligands. One of the most commonly used MOFs is the Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67). For example, a CoP electrocatalyst was synthesized using ZIF-67. N–P and N–Co bonds in ZIF-67 allowed facile electron transfers between CoP and MOF, resulting in more thermal-neutral ΔGH2O* and ΔGH* for HER.92 However, high-temperature annealing is commonly used to convert MOF templates into electrocatalysts. The local structures of MOFs frameworks are prone to collapse during the thermal treatment, and high temperatures also cause severe aggregation of metal species.141 To conquer this issue, mild synthesis methods have been explored. For example, Hod et al. adopted a room-temperature electrochemical method to convert ZIF-67 into a CoSx–MOF hybrid (Fig. 15a).142 The typical local structure of ZIF-67 was largely retained, and the porosity and constituent of the CoSx–MOF hybrid can also be precisely tuned via adjusting scan rates and potential ranges in the electrochemical method. Moreover, Cai et al. prepared CoP coordinated MOF via a bioinspired engineering method under mild temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 15b.143 In addition to Co-based MOFs, other metals, such as Mn59 and Cu,144 were also developed as metal centers in MOFs to synthesize neutral HER electrocatalysts.

(b) The local structure of CoP coordinated MOF prepared by a bioinspired method.143 Copyright ACS Publication 2018. 
Self-templating is another method to fabricate large surface area 3D structured electrocatalysts. For developing self-templated HER electrocatalysts in the neutral medium, recent studies focused on growing self-supported catalytic species with a wide variety of morphologies on metal foils145–147 or carbon substrates.130,148 For instance, Li's group synthesized SiO2–polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes on carbon fibers.148 The PPy nanotubes decorated with SiO2 nanoparticles spontaneously formed on carbon fibers during the polymerization of PPy. Generally, by virtue of specific 3D porous structures, all these electrocatalysts exhibit improved HER performance, good gas diffusion rate, and long-term stability in neutral electrolytes. However, due to the lack of understanding of the self-assembly process of nanostructures, it is still difficult to precisely control the morphology and structure of electrocatalysts by self-assembly methods, especially, in a scalable way.


4.2.3 Other structural engineering methods. 
Apart from using substrates and templates, two other types of structural engineering methods have been used to create porous electrocatalysts. One type is core–shell structured electrocatalysts, usually consists of a metal compound core and a carbon shell, may offer several advantages: (1) carbon shells can efficiently suppress the sintering and aggregation of metal cores under high-temperature treatments during the synthesis of electrocatalysts; (2) core–shell structures may also enable faster electron transfers at the interface between the carbon shell and the metal core; (3) heteroatoms (e.g., N, P, S) can be doped into carbon shells, and the tuneable interfacial junctions have synergistic effects to enhance HER activity. As illustrated in Fig. 16a and b, several core–shell structured electrocatalysts with different metal cores, such as Fe,149 Co,150 Ni,151 Mo,58 and W,152 were synthesized for HER in neutral electrolytes. The other type is hollow spheres. For example, Schaak et al. reported FeP hollow nanoparticles that exhibit excellent HER performance than previously reported iron-based electrocatalyst in 1.0 M PBS electrolyte (see Fig. 16c).153 Zeng et al. further modified the inner space of NiS2 hollow spheres by in situ selenization to form a mesoporous/hollow sphere (NiS2(1−x)Se2x) with an average pore diameter of 4–10 nm, as shown in Fig. 16d.154

Lastly, we compared the catalytic performance of representative electrocatalysts discussed above based on their overpotential (η10) and Tafel slope in Fig. 17. A more comprehensive comparison of HER electrocatalysts reviewed in this section is also summarized in Table 1, with detailed design strategies highlighted for every electrocatalyst.

5. Summary and outlook
Electrocatalytic HER depicts promising prospects for massive H2 production. Neutral HER has gained ever-increasing research interests in recent years for its advantages such as safety, ecofriendliness, potential economic feasibility for direct seawater splitting, and compatibility for photoelectrocatalysis and bioelectrocatalysis. However, most studies for neutral HER are simply extended or extrapolated from well-established principles in acidic/alkaline electrolytes, with limited clarification on the unique challenges in neutral electrolytes. In this review, we presented the progress of HER under neutral/near-neutral conditions. We first highlighted the intrinsic two reduction steps of HER in neutral electrolytes with two overwhelming features, including the reactant switching and the diffusion-controlled kinetics. The first reduction step involves H3O+ ions as the central reactant under cathodic overpotentials near 0 V vs. RHE, where the mass transfer of H3O+ ions governs the overall reaction. In the second reduction step, reactants switch from H3O+ ions to H2O molecules under more negative cathodic overpotentials, where H2O dissociation becomes the rate-determining step. Then we summarized recent mechanistic discussions of H2O dissociation, microscopic catalytic behaviors, and catalytic phase-transfer. Next, the influences of different neutral electrolytes, including buffered electrolytes, unbuffered electrolytes, and seawater, were compared. The mass transfer limits can be partially suppressed in buffered electrolytes with optimal concentrations, and buffered electrolytes can also help to minimize ORR. In contrast, HER in unbuffered electrolytes is governed by mass transfer issues. When HER takes place in seawater, surface deposition of alkaline-earth metal cations may occur, which blocks active sites. Last, we summarized the recent advances in the development of neutral HER electrocatalysts through two primary approaches, including enhancing intrinsic catalytic activities and increasing the density of active catalytic sites, along with the detailed comparison of the HER activities of these electrocatalysts.
Although many recent studies have focused on HER under neutral conditions with great strides been made, there is still a long way ahead for neutral HER to rival the success of the current industrial alkaline H2O electrolysis. Here, we highlight a few issues which we believe should be near-term research focuses:
(1) Mechanistic insights of HER under neutral conditions. Compared to the clearer mechanistic understanding of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, only limited studies have focused on the reaction mechanism of HER under neutral conditions. We summarized two key features of neutral HER under low overpotentials. However, practical H2O electrolysis is expected to take place under much higher overpotentials, where H2O would be the primary reactant. Although impressive breakthroughs have been made regarding the H2O dissociation mechanism of alkaline HER, whether these proposed theories are applicable in neutral electrolytes is still not clear. One key question, regardless of electrocatalysts and electrolytes, is whether the key rate-determining step in neutral electrolytes remains the same as that in alkaline electrolytes, or it is different. The answer to this question would significantly affect fundamental design principles for electrocatalysts, electrolytes, water electrolyzers, and their operating conditions. Thus, further mechanistic studies are imperatively needed to reveal real reaction steps in HER under neutral conditions.
(2) Development of electrocatalysts. Many recently developed electrocatalysts are highly active for HER in acidic and/or alkaline electrolytes. However, only a small fraction of these electrocatalysts have been evaluated under neutral conditions. For example, some highly active acidic/alkali HER electrocatalysts, such as covalent organic framework-based catalysts and single-atom catalysts, have rarely been used for neutral HER. Considering the future economic competitiveness and potential activity, we propose that earth-abundant Fe- and Ni-based compounds/composites could be the prime choice as efficient neutral HER catalysts. Besides, stainless steel mesh (e.g., 304 type SS) may serve as an ideal 3D substrate that can satisfy the requirement for high electrical conductivity and large specific surface area at a relatively low price (40 USD per m2, vs. ca. 100 and 900 USD per m2 for Cu foam and CC, respectively). Future exploration of other efficient neutral HER electrocatalysts is required.
(3) Advanced characterization and modeling techniques. There is still a lack of understanding of the interaction between reaction intermediates and active catalytic species as well as the diffusion of reactants on electrocatalyst surfaces. Advanced characterization tools, such as in situ microscopy and spectroscopy, will be useful to determine real catalytic sites on various electrocatalysts and identify their corresponding reaction intermediates (e.g., *H2O, *H) during HER. For theoretical calculations, most of the current models have not considered the dynamic evolutions of electrocatalysts under reaction conditions. Therefore, studies combining in situ characterizations and DFT calculations of real active sites are urgently needed. We propose that particular attention should be put on investigating the activity-structure-pH drift correlations.
(4) Long-term stability of electrocatalysts and electrolytes. Although some electrocatalysts exhibit high stability in buffered electrolytes, their durability and corrosion resistance in unbuffered electrolytes or seawater is far from satisfactory. Both electrocatalysts and electrolytes may undergo significant changes during water electrolysis over an extended period. To monitor, understand, and control the evolution of electrocatalysts and electrolytes is vital to realize practical water electrolysis. Further, in terms of seawater splitting, materials with high resistance towards corrosive Cl− ions and surface deposition of metal cations are needed. Achieving long-term stability, especially in unbuffered electrolytes or seawater, is a critical step to realize large-scale operation.
(5) Electrolyzer design and scale-up. Various electrolyzers, such as proton exchange membrane and AEM electrolyzers, have been successfully applied for industrial-scale H2 production over the past few decades. Current studies for HER under neutral conditions are still limited to small scale lab research. Considering various unique characteristics of HER under neutral conditions, significant engineering efforts are needed to design and scale-up novel and suitable electrolyzers for neutral HER to address its unique challenges. For example, a neutral H2O splitting electrolyzer may be coupled with additional field-assisted techniques to speed up the slow mass transfer. In a recent study, the magnetic field was applied to boost the HER/OER efficiency with low energy consumption.155
