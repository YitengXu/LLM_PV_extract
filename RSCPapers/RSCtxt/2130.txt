    , Accepted 1st February 2021First published on 1st February 2021AbstractPropelled by the vision of carbon-neutral energy systems, heterogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid/formate, a liquid hydrogen carrier, has been intensively studied as a promising approach to realize renewable and decarbonized energy supply. In the present review, the state-of-the-art of heterogeneous catalysts for this process is comprehensively summarized. First, a brief description of the challenges associated with thermodynamics is provided. Major advancements on constructing efficient heterogeneous catalysts then constitute the main body of this review, mainly involving nanostructured and single atom catalysts based on noble metals. Special attention is paid to the relevant structure–activity correlations and mechanistic insights, which provide strong bases for rational catalyst design. Key factors related to catalytic activity are highlighted including metal dispersion, electron density, basic functionalities, and concerted catalysis of metal and basic sites. A summary and outlook is presented in the end. We believe that this review will inspire more novel research from the catalysis community to advance the design of innovative catalytic materials towards the ultimate sustainable energy sector with a closed carbon loop.

Broader context
Devising new technologies to drive the evolution from current CO2-emission-intensive energy modes to renewable energy landscapes featuring a circular carbon economy is the major challenge facing the sustainable development of human society. Under this background, the utilization of captured CO2 as a renewable carbon feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and fuels is receiving considerable attention. Formic acid, which can be readily synthesized from CO2 and H2, offers a potential solution to address this energy transition challenge due to its role as a carbon-neutral energy carrier to store renewable energy in the form of H2. Central to the CO2-involved H2 storage system lies in the development of efficient and durable heterogeneous catalysts. Accordingly, the catalytic conversion of CO2 to formic acid has been intensively explored in the realm of heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, benefiting from the new frontier of single atom catalysis, the scope of heterogeneous catalyst candidates has been further broadened in recent years. This review presents a critical overview of the design of heterogeneous metal catalysts for CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate from traditional nanoscale to novel single atom scale. Diverse single-atom engineering and nanostructuring strategies have been exploited to unlock high-performance catalysts by regulating the size, electronic properties, and coordination environments of active metal species. We also point out the remaining challenges in the purist of practically viable CO2-based H2 storage process, that is, deepening the knowledge of structure–property–activity relationships to enable the precise construction of active sites with superior activity and stability.

1. Introduction
In nature, the release and capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) is subtly regulated via the natural processes of photosynthesis and respiration, which have contributed to a stable atmospheric level of CO2 at around 250 ppm over thousands of years.1 Nevertheless, since the industrial revolution, the steady status has been disturbed by the increasing emissions of anthropogenic CO2 from the continuous exploitation of fossil resources. This has led to a remarkable rise in CO2 levels up to approximately 415 ppm nowadays.2 The associated consequences such as global warming, sea-level rise, and extreme climate have aroused substantial awareness of taking effective measures to mitigate excessive CO2 emissions.
Aiming to achieve a “decarbonized” energy sector, renewable energy sources such as biomass, wind, geothermal, and solar energies are being increasingly applied to substitute and/or supplement fossil fuels across the world. However, considering the limited share of renewables in global energy consumption, e.g. amounting to around 11% in 2018,3 the International Energy Agency projects that massive amounts of CO2 up to 35 billion metric tons will be released into the atmosphere globally in 2020.4 The emitted and accumulated CO2 over time in the atmosphere is far beyond the buffer capacities of natural CO2 recycle. In this regard, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) appear an effective technical solution to address the overloaded CO2 in air.5–7 Central to the CCU process is the catalytic upgrading (i.e., utilization) of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels,8 mimicking the natural fixation of CO2 into fossil resources. Specifically, the utilization of CO2 as a carbon source together with the renewable H2 from water splitting provides a potential pathway to integrate renewable energy into the established chemical value chain (Fig. 1).9,10 Various synthetic approaches have been developed to convert CO2 into a broad range of chemicals including polycarbonate, formic acid/formate, methanol, methane, and hydrocarbons, etc. at laboratory or industry scale.11–16 Among them, formic acid/formate, a versatile C1 molecule, has received a surge of renewed attentions during the last decade, due to its emerging role as a green energy carrier for a sustainable future.17,18 The high density of formic acid (1.22 g mL−1) endows it with a considerable volumetric H2 capacity of 53 g H2 per L, thus exhibiting large potential as a liquid H2 carrier,19 in particular for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In addition, formate/formic acid is considered as a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of valuable oxygen-containing compounds (e.g., alcohols, esters, acids) in the field of syngas catalysis.20,21 In particular for the synthesis of higher alcohols, the adsorbed CO is proposed to combine with the hydroxyl groups on catalyst surface giving rise to formate species as the precursor to alcohols.22 As depicted in Fig. 1, an attractive carbon-neutral energy scenario can be envisioned based on the reversible conversion of CO2 to formic acid. Analogous to CO2 reduction to formic acid, the dehydrogenation of formic acid can be facilitated by using the similar or even same catalytically active sites,23–28 further improving the economic feasibility of this carbon-neutral energy system. Nevertheless, life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies have disclosed that the energy demands for CO2 supply, H2 production, and hydrogenation can cause positive or even higher global warming impacts for CO2 reduction to FA in certain scenarios,29–31 in comparison to the fossil-based FA production. Therefore, a realistic carbon-neutral energy system also necessitates CO2 supply, H2 production, and (de)hydrogenation preferentially powered by renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar) with minimized carbon footprints. Even though only limited environmental benefits can be achieved currently, CO2 hydrogenation to FA as a sustainable and feasible H2 storage system is of significant importance in the context of circular H2 economy.32 Furthermore, catalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate involves the formation of C–H bond by breaking a CO bond, providing a good model reaction to investigate the initial activation steps of CO2 by H2.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the prospective carbon-neutral energy scenario based on formic acid. 
Unfortunately, CO2 is known as a kinetically and thermodynamically stable molecule, as indicated by a high bond energy of 806 kJ mol−1. This leads to a grand challenge encountered in CO2 valorization, namely, intrinsically low-reactivity of CO2 toward chemical transformations. Catalysis plays a crucial role in overcoming the high kinetic barriers to enable efficient reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate. Intensive research has resulted in considerable success in catalyst developments, both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts.33–36 A multitude of molecular metal complexes, comprising various metal centers and ligands with well-defined structures, have demonstrated outstanding activities for the homogeneous CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate,26,33,37–39 exemplified by a Ru–PNP pincer complex showing a record turnover frequency (TOF) of up to 1100000 h−1.40 Nozaki and coworkers reported another highly active molecular Ir–PNP pincer complex with a turnover number (TON) as high as 3500000.41 The pyridine moiety of the Ir–PNP pincer complex was proposed to facilitate the key steps of H2 activation and proton/hydride transfer over Ir centers via a dearomatization–aromatization mechanism.42 In spite of such unparalleled performance, the problematic separation and recycling of metal complexes as well as the adopted expensive and air-sensitive ligands pose huge hurdles for the practical application of molecular complexes. The easy-handling and recyclability of heterogeneous catalysts, especially advantageous to continuous operation in practice, have motivated extensive research efforts to realize the catalytic synthesis of formic acid/formate heterogeneously. A series of classical supported-metal catalysts containing nanoparticles and sub-nanometric clusters have been reported as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for formic acid/formate production.35,43,44 Nevertheless, heterogeneous catalysts usually exhibit inferior catalytic performance to their homogeneous counterparts due to the poor atom utilization efficiency. For a typical nanocatalyst, a large fraction of active sites are embed in a bulk phase, therefore unable to contribute to the catalytic performance directly. Distinct from the uniform coordination structure in homogeneous systems, heterogeneous catalysis is characterized by its heterogeneity of nanostructured active sites in terms of size, shape, and local microenvironment interacting with the active sites.45,46 These diverse active sites would lead to a reduced activity/selectivity toward formic acid/formate along with the formation of side products, e.g. the competing reduction of CO2 to CH4 and CO. Therefore, there exists long-standing pursuit of an “idealized catalyst” bearing the advantages of both homogeneous catalyst (high activity/selectivity) and heterogeneous catalyst (easy separation). In this context, a new concept of heterogeneous catalyst was recently proposed: single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metal atoms on solid matrixes feature maximum atom utilization, relatively uniform structure, and unique electronic configurations.47–49 Downsizing nanostructured active sites to single atom not only makes all active atoms accessible to reactants and also reduces the cost of metal component. These characters make SACs seemingly very promising to serve as the “idealized catalyst” to efficiently catalyze heterogeneous CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate. Exploring and developing SACs for efficient CO2 upgrading have become one of the most active fields in heterogeneous catalysis. Recently, a number of studies have showed the excellent activity and good recyclability of SACs in CO2-related catalytic conversions,50–54 in particular for CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid/formate. In addition to the well-developed thermochemical CO2 reduction, electro- and photocatalytic CO2 reduction represent another two promising approaches to synthesize formic acid, which are currently active topics of intensive research. The latter two technologies are more sustainable with less environmental footprints than thermocatalytic CO2 reduction, since they are driven by clean and renewable energy without extra energy input and H2 demand. However, both of them are still in early-stage research with very low technology readiness levels. The high cost of renewable electricity, low current density, poor conversion efficiency and productivity are the major bottlenecks hindering the large scale implementation of electro- and photocatalytic CO2 reduction to formic acid. The reader may refer to recent review articles for more details of electro- and photocatalytic approaches,55–62 which are beyond the scope of the present Review.
Heterogeneous CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate has been comprehensively summarized in several reviews from different perspectives,35,44,63–66 covering aspects of catalytic materials, reaction parameters, process engineering, and mechanistic insights. In recent years, the rapid development of single atom catalysis has given rise to an increasing number of SACs featuring high activity for CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate. Accordingly, it is of great significance to discuss and summarize the recent advances of heterogeneous catalysts from traditional nanoscale to novel single atom. In this review, we will concentrate on the latest achievements on two main classes of heterogeneous catalysts, i.e., nanostructured metal catalysts and SACs for CO2/bicarbonate hydrogenation to formic acid/formate (Fig. 2). The discussion part will focus on the catalytic performance of various nanoparticles and single atoms with an attempt to extract the basic structure–activity relationships associated with geometric and electronic effects. The comparison of SACs and nanocatalysts and the activation of H2/CO2 over different catalysts are also discussed. These fundamentals are expected to shed light on tailoring new generation heterogeneous catalytic materials for CO2 conversion with high efficiency and stability.

2. Thermodynamic aspects
The major challenge associated with the catalytic production of formic acid from CO2 lies in the unfavorable thermodynamics (eqn (1), Table 1),67 originating from the unfavorable entropic contribution of transforming gaseous substrates (CO2 and H2) into liquid product (formic acid). Two strategies have been commonly exploited to mitigate the thermodynamic limitation: the addition of base additives (i.e., amines, hydroxides and (bi)carbonates), and choosing an appropriate reaction medium (i.e., water, alcohols, DMSO, ionic liquids). For example, if CO2 hydrogenation is conducted in aqueous solution, the formation of formic acid becomes thermodynamically favored with an negative Gibbs energy (eqn (2), ΔrGθ298K = −4 kJ mol−1, Table 1) thanks to solvation effects, which can reduce the entropy difference between CO2/H2 and formic acid.68 Apart from solvation effects, the utilization of alcoholic solvent offers another benefit by esterification with formic acid to form alkyl formate (eqn (3), Table 1), thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium toward alkyl formate. For reactions implemented in the presence of base additives, the formed formic acid will be further deprotonated by base to yield formate or formic acid/amine adduct with a highly negative enthalpy of −84.3 kJ mol−1 (eqn (4), Table 1),67 which can compensate the entropic factor and drive the overall reaction towards formate.

From a practical viewpoint, organic amine bases such as ethanolamine are preferred over inorganic bases, as they are widely used for the industrial CO2 scrubbing process,69 which could enable the integration of CO2 capture and conversion in one step and medium. Besides, the employment of inorganic bases together with water as solvent would lead to the formation of multiple intermediates derived from CO2 such as carbonic acid, carbonate, and bicarbonate (Scheme 1). The concentration of each species is governed by the complex equilibriums among them, sensitive to reaction conditions such as pH, temperature, water content, CO2 pressure, and the properties of base. All of these species might be involved in catalytic CO2 reduction, and the specific contributions of each component are difficult to determine experimentally. Likewise, the combined utilization of organic amine bases with water will give rise to a complex amine–water–CO2 system comprising bicarbonate, carbonate, and carbamate. The speciation analysis of these components in various amine–CO2 systems has been recently summarized in a review by Hu et al.70 Moreover, it should be noted that CO2 and its derived species exhibit different reactivity towards being reduced to formate. For instance, a TON of 6414 was obtained over a Pd nanocatalyst (Pd/C3N4) by using KHCO3 as the carbon source and base in 3 h, whereas the TON was sharply decreased to 866 upon using CO2 as the carbon source in the absence of KHCO3.71 On the contrary, in the case of an Au nanocatalyst (Au/SiO2-Schiff) reported by Liu et al.,72 formate was generated with a high TON of 14470 by using CO2 in methanol/H2O/NEt3 without bicarbonate in 12 h, which is nearly 58 times higher than that obtained with KHCO3 as the carbon source. These results clearly suggested that different reaction mechanisms were followed over the same catalyst, depending on the dominated form of CO2 present in the reaction medium. A detailed discussion on the role of base in altering reaction pathway will be presented in a following mechanistic section (Section 5.1).

3. Nanostructured metal catalysts
Historically, the first application of heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of formic acid/formate from CO2 reduction dates back to the reduction of KHCO3 using Pd black as the catalyst by Bredig and Carter in 1914.73 Later on, Farlow et al. reported the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formate by a skeletal RANEY® Ni catalyst using amine as base in ethanol.74 These early reported skeletal/bulk metal catalysts, featuring big metallic particles from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers, usually presented very low activities and fast deactivation due to their poor metal dispersion and easy aggregation. However, for a long time after these pioneering works, no major progress in heterogeneous reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate was achieved until the synthesis and application of nanocatalysis. Catalytic performances are greatly improved over nanostructured metal catalysts, which are characterized by a high surface to volume ratio with more active atoms exposed to CO2 and H2 as well as the unusual electronic structures at the nanoscale. Numerous nanostructured metal catalysts have been constructed based on noble metals including Ru, Pd, Au, and Ag, giving monometallic or bimetallic formulations through the rational combination of these metal components. Particle sizes of nanocatalysts are mostly in the range from sub-nanometers (clusters) to nanometers (nanoparticles). The active metal ensembles are generally dispersed on functionalized supports with basic properties giving classical supported-metal catalysts, or directly applied as colloidal catalysts in liquid phase, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Catalytic performances of nanostructured metal catalysts are dependent on the metal component, support material, additive, and reaction conditions, as summarized in Table 2.

3.1 Pd-Based nanocatalysts
Thus far, heterogeneous catalysts containing Pd nanoparticles or clusters have been extensively studied in catalyzing both bicarbonate and CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate. Because of the excellent ability of Pd to adsorb and dissociate H2, Pd-based nanocatalysts usually show superior activity to other transition metals, especially for bicarbonate reduction. For instance, González et al. reported that activated carbon-supported Pd catalyst (Pd/AC) was able to catalyze the hydrogenation of NaHCO3 to sodium formate with a TOF of 48 h−1 even at atmospheric H2 pressure and room temperature (Table 2, entry 1).75 For comparison, they also synthesized a series of AC-supported Ni, Ru, Co, and Re catalysts, which were inferior to Pd/AC in terms of TOF under the same reaction conditions. For the catalytic reduction of NH4HCO3 into formate at room temperature, Pd/AC also presented high activity with a TON of 782 in 1 h,76 whereas negligible TONs (≤3) were obtained for other supported metal catalysts including Ru/AC, Pt/AC, Rh/AC and Ni/AC. Mitchell and co-workers reported a Mo2C-supported Pd nanocatalyst (Pd/Mo2C), affording higher TON than Mo2C-supported Ru catalyst (72 vs. 11) in 24 h at 100 °C in the presence of NaHCO3 (Table 2, entry 2).77 In addition, Pd nanoparticles dispersed on bulk carbon nitride (Pd/BCN) were recently proved to be effective in catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to yield free-form formic acid in the absence of base in water. A relatively low TOF of 1.2 h−1 was obtained over Pd/BCN (Table 2, entry 3),78 but this still surpassed the activities of Au/BCN and Ru/BCN with TOFs below 1 h−1. These results demonstrated the intrinsically high activity of Pd nanoparticle toward bicarbonate/CO2 hydrogenation regardless of the employed support and base. Pd particle size and the nature of support have been identified as two key factors to affect the activation of H2 and adsorption of CO2, which in turn determine the catalytic performances of Pd nanocatalysts. Here, we would like to put an emphasis on the promoting effects of various supports in dispersing and stabilizing Pd species as well as adsorbing and activating CO2/bicarbonate.

3.1.1 Nitrogen-doped carbon supports. 
Nitrogen-doped carbon materials have received enormous interests due to their abundant nitrogen-containing functional groups such as amines, Schiff base, pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N, which can serve as basic sites to capture and activate CO2. Formic acid is probably produced at the interface of these basic functional groups with Pd nanoparticles via concerted catalysis. In 2014, Lee and co-workers were the first to apply mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as support for Pd-catalyzed CO2 reduction into formate in the presence of NEt3 (Fig. 2).79 A TON of 106 was achieved at 150 °C and 40 bar total pressure over Pd/g-C3N4 in 24 h (Table 2, entry 4), which was 2-fold more active than commercial Pd/C catalyst. The high activity was ascribed to the basic sites of g-C3N4 to capture and concentrate CO2 around Pd centers.
Following this work, Park et al. exploited Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst for CO2 reduction to free formic acid in the absence of base, affording a TOF of 1.1 h−1 (Table 2, entry 5).80 In contrast, N-free carbon nanotube-supported Pd catalysts, possessing similar Pd particle size as Pd/g-C3N4 (4.38 vs. 4.29 nm), led to very poor activity with a TOF of 0.09 h−1. CO2-temperature programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) profiles disclosed the much higher CO2 adsorption capacity of g-C3N4 than carbon nanotube (CNT), which was proposed to account for its superior catalytic activities. A correlation was also found between catalytic activity and Pd particle size. As shown in Fig. 3, with the particle size of Pd decreasing from 7.2 to 3.4 nm, a roughly two-fold increase of TOF was observed over Pd/g-C3N4. The superior catalytic activity achieved over small-sized Pd sites was ascribed to the increased number of interfacial sites between Pd nanoparticle and g-C3N4, which were proposed to serve as the true active sites for the formation of formic acid. The authors suggested that H2 and CO2 were firstly activated on Pd and g-C3N4, respectively, and then the activated H2 and CO2 species subsequently migrated to the interface of Pd/g-C3N4 to yield formic acid.

Related studies focusing on the basic properties of g-C3N4 revealed that CO2 was mainly bonded to the primary and secondary amine groups arising from the edge defects on g-C3N4 probably in the form of carbamate.81–83 To further improve the catalytic performances of Pd/g-C3N4, three methods with different post-treatment procedures, namely, thermal exfoliation of BCN (ECN), hard templating to form mesoporosity (MCN), and C-enrichment by copolymerization with 2,4,6-triaminopyridine, were applied to tune the basic properties of g-C3N4, targeting a high fraction of edge defects (Scheme 2).78 A rapid thermal exfoliation (1 h) was found to be more efficient than other approaches in producing edge defects, resulting in the highest amount of basic sites. Therefore, the resultant Pd/ECN-1 h catalyst gave an enhanced TOF from 1.2 to 2.4 h−1 compared to the pristine Pd/BCN catalyst (Table 2, entries 3 and 6). A positive correlation of the concentration of basic sites with the metal time yield of formic acid was established (Fig. 4), indicating the important role of basic sites in promoting the formation of formic acid. By optimizing Pd loading, the best performance was reached at a medium Pd content of 1.47 wt% generating a large number of small-sized Pd particles (mean particle size = 5 nm). As a result, a higher fraction of Pd sites (H2 splitting) in close proximity to the edge defects (basic sites) were formed. This finding further verified the above-mentioned critical role of interface sites between Pd and g-C3N4 in facilitating CO2 reduction. In addition, a single-atom Pd catalyst supported on BCN was also examined for activity comparison with Pd nanoparticles. Under identical conditions, single-atom Pd catalyst only showed half activity of Pd nanoparticles. This was not surprising given that single-atom Pd usually situates in the six-fold cavity within the carbon nitride matrix,84 which renders Pd sites relatively far from the edge defects. As such, the number of catalytically active interfacial sites of single Pd atom and basic edge defect was reduced, thus leading to poor activity.

In addition to providing basic sites, these N functionalities can act as anchoring sites for small Pd particles and Lewis base sites to regulate the electronic state of Pd, analogous to N-donor ligands in molecular catalysts. For example, Wang et al. prepared a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NMC) material possessing four types of nitrogen species including pyridine, pyrrole, nitrile, and quaternary N.85 The employment of NMC as support led to smaller Pd particles (2.4 vs. 3.1 nm) in comparison to MC-supported Pd catalysts. According to XPS, the binding energy of Pd0 in Pd/NMC was 0.4 eV smaller than that in Pd/MC, implying the relatively electron-rich Pd species on NMC due to the electron-donating effects of nitrogen functionalities. Apart from the dominant Pd0 species on Pd/NMC, a large fraction of Pd(II) species were also found. Pd/NMC was examined for the catalytic hydrogenation of KHCO3 into formate, showing higher activity than Pd/MC in terms of KHCO3 conversion (69.7 vs. 45.2%). The enhanced activity by doping nitrogen was attributed to the strong interaction between nitrogen functionalities and Pd nanoparticles, which can facilitate the dispersion of Pd and enrich its electron density, thus facilitating H2 activation. Yet, the potential contribution of Pd(II) species to the catalytic activity deserves further investigations. Besides, g-C3N4 and Schiff base-modified carbon nitride (u-CN100) were found to be effective in improving the dispersion and charge density of active Pd atoms.71,86 As shown in Fig. 5, three types of N sites (i.e., N, N′, N′′) existed on carbon nitrides. Based on DFT calculations, Pd atoms were believed to bind to the sp2-hybridized N and N′′ sites, which were more negatively charged and offered more diffused orbitals.79 With the help of these Lewis basic nitrogen sites, ultra-small electron-enriched Pd particles with average sizes of 1.57 and 1.9 nm were synthesized on Pd/u-CN100 and Pd/g-C3N4, respectively, as evidenced by TEM and XPS. The resultant Pd/u-CN100 catalyst gave a reasonable TOF of 98.9 h−1 at 110 °C for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate in the presence of NEt3 and ethanol (Table 2, entry 8).86 When employing KHCO3 as the carbon source, a high TON of 5051 was obtained on the Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst at 80 °C after 1 h (Table 2, entry 9).71

It has been demonstrated that natural biopolymers such as chitin and chitosan containing N functionalities can function as a new type of N-doped carbon support to stabilize and modify Pd nanoparticles. For example, Wu and co-workers prepared highly-dispersed Pd particles on chitosan-derived carbon materials through the thermal pyrolysis of chitosan.87 The resultant Pd/AC catalyst, with a small Pd particle size of 1.7 nm, can catalyze the reduction of CO2 into free formic acid with a high TON of 594 in 24 h in the presence of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Bmim][OAc]) as solvent (Table 2, entry 10). By contrast, the commercial Pd/AC containing large Pd particles (4 nm) gave a much lower TON of 168 under same conditions, confirming the beneficial effects of N functionalities. In addition, it was discovered that [Bmim][OAc] could contribute to the catalytic performance by enhancing the electron density of Pd (electron donation of OAc−) and capturing CO2 as an imidazolium carboxylate intermediate, as evidenced by XPS and NMR. In 2017, Song et al. reported the direct utilization of chitin as support to synthesize Pd/chitin catalyst for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate in the presence of Na2CO3.88 Pd/chitin gave a 2-fold higher TOF (257 h−1, Table 2, entry 11) than commercial Pd/C catalyst owing to the dual functions of acetamide groups in chitin, that is, anchoring small Pd nanoparticles and increasing the electron density of Pd.
The non-functionalized carbon materials with relatively inert surfaces such as AC and the reduced graphite oxide (r-GO) were also explored as support to immobilize Pd nanoparticles for the reduction of bicarbonate into formate,76,89,90 with medium to high activities achieved. For instance, Bi et al. reported a very high TON of 7088 over a r-GO-supported Pd nanocatalyst at 100 °C after 32 h (Table 2, entry 12). As a result of the lattice mismatch between Pd domains and r-GO, highly strained Pd nanoparticles with distorted electronic structures were formed on r-GO, which were believed to be responsible for the excellent activity of Pd/r-GO.90 Su and co-workers performed the hydrogenation of NH4HCO3 into formate using a commercial Pd/C catalyst with a TON of 1672 at 20 °C after 2 h (Table 2, entry 13), which was much higher than that achieved using commercial Pd/Al2O3, Pd/CaCO3, and Pd/BaSO4 catalysts under identical conditions (Table 2, entries 14 to 16).76 The superior performance of Pd/AC was attributed to the better dispersion of Pd on AC and the unique capability of AC to adsorb and store H2 in its hydrophobic channels, thus leading to high local H2 concentration for NH4HCO3 reduction. It is well known that AC is typically pretreated in acid solutions prior to being employed as support. Accordingly, the generated oxygenated functional groups (e.g., carboxyl, hydroxyl, phenol, carbonyl, anhydride, etc.) along with the remaining acidic moieties (e.g., sulphate and nitrate) on AC might contribute to the stabilization of Pd.91,92


3.1.2 Metal oxide supports. 
In contrast to numerous studies on constructing Pd catalysts onto carbon-based materials, there are only few demonstrations of Pd catalysts supported on metal oxides with basic or amphoteric properties (e.g., Al2O3, ZrO2, ZnO, CeO2, TiO2) for CO2 reduction in the literature.89,93,94 Especially for reducible supports like ZrO2, CeO2, and TiO2, they have rich surface oxygen vaccines capable of capturing and activating CO2 upon reduction.95,96 Generally, metal oxide-supported Pd catalysts exhibit inferior activity to Pd deposited on carbon-based materials, but most recently superior activity was reported by the group of Yan using Pd/TiO2 catalysts with tailored basicity and H2 activation activity.94 Taking Pd/CeO2 and Pd/ZnO as model catalysts, they first systemically studied the reaction kinetics to understand the kinetically relevant step over each catalyst and also monitored the formation of reaction intermediates on catalyst surface by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) under CO2/H2 atmosphere. The spectroscopic results showed that the in situ formed bicarbonate species on catalyst surface served as the key intermediate for the synthesis of formate. For Pd/ZnO with negligible basic properties, the relatively slow activation of CO2 to yield bicarbonate was found to be the rate-determining step (RDS). In contrast, for Pd/CeO2, H2 splitting on Pd nanoparticles presented the RDS as the result of the abundant basic sites of CeO2, thus accelerating the conversion of CO2 into bicarbonate. By comparing these results, the authors concluded that there are two crucial parameters for highly-active metal oxide-supported Pd catalysts: sufficient density of basic sites and small Pd nanoparticles for CO2 activation and H2 dissociation, respectively. Based on these principles, they designed a highly efficient Pd catalyst by depositing small Pd nanoparticles (4.6 ± 0.9 nm) on TiO2 featuring more basic sites than CeO2 and ZnO. Indeed, the resultant Pd/TiO2 catalyst afforded a TOF of up to 909 h−1 for the reduction of NaHCO3 into formate at 40 °C, far higher than that on Pd/CeO2 and Pd/ZnO (Table 2, entries 17 to 19). In a follow-up study by the same group, an interesting dependence of catalytic activity on the crystalline phase of ZrO2 was observed for a series of Pd nanoparticles supported on monoclinic ZrO2 (ZrO2-M), tetragonal ZrO2 (ZrO2-T), and hybrid ZrO2 (ZrO2-M&T).93 Three types of ZrO2 led to distinct basic properties for these Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. Among them, Pd/ZrO2-T displayed the highest activity with a TOF of 2817 h−1 at 100 °C (Table 2, entries 20 to 22). Kinetic studies disclosed that CO2 activation was the RDS over these Pd/ZrO2 catalysts. The highest concentration of weak basic sites on ZrO2-T enabling moderate binding with CO2 was proposed to be responsible for the excellent activity of Pd/ZrO2-T. Similarly, morphology-dependent catalytic activities were also reported for Pd/ZnO nanocatalysts using different ZnO supports (commercial, nanorods, nanoplates). The employment of ZnO nanorods gave the highest activity (TOF = 10.1 h−1), which was attributed to the largest amount of weak basic sites on ZnO nanorods resulting from the predominantly exposed nonpolar (100) and (101) facets.97


3.1.3 Unsupported Pd nanocatalysts. 
Unsupported Pd nanoparticles such as the suspended metallic Pd nanoparticles in methanol have been reported to be efficient for CO2 reduction to formate in the presence of NEt3, giving a TON of 470 in 3 h (Table 2, entry 23). However, a significant dissolution of Pd species was observed during the reaction.98 A silica shell with a thickness of 8 nm was therefore introduced to prevent the dissolution of Pd. The resultant silica-coated Pd catalyst showed greatly improved stability against metal leaching during five successive recycles with only a slight decrease of TON from 593 to 549. In addition, Lee and co-workers fabricated an interesting Pd-based nanoreactor by the interfacially cross-linked reverse micelles (Pd@ICRM), wherein Pd nanoparticles were encapsulated in the hydrophilic core of the polymerized surfactants (Fig. 6A).99 The catalytic performance of the nanoreactor was dependent on the head group of the employed surfactant which could bring either CO2 or bicarbonate to the metallic Pd core. Quaternary ammonium-based catalyst Pd@ICRM(3) preferentially adsorbed bicarbonate (Fig. 6B), and Al2O3-doped Pd@ICRM(3) gave a TON of 580 at room temperature and 40 bar H2 after 8 h (Table 2, entry 24). By contrast, CO2 tended to adsorb on the tertiary amine-based catalyst Pd@ICRM(2) (Fig. 6B) affording a TON of 250 in 20 h in the presence of NEt3 at 40 °C and 80 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) (Table 2, entry 25). Accordingly, substrate-recognizable reduction of CO2/bicarbonate to formate was realized by engineering the microenvironments around Pd.

For Pd-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation, it is noteworthy that the majority of studies employed bicarbonate as the base and also the carbon source instead of a combination of gaseous CO2 with NEt3, as shown in Table 2. This is related to the superior activity of Pd-based catalysts for the catalytic reduction of bicarbonate compared to direct CO2 reduction. Catalytic activities of Pd nanocatalysts strongly depend on bicarbonate concentration. For example, Shao et al. compared the catalytic activities of Pd/g-C3N4 for CO2 reduction to formate in the presence of NEt3 with the direct reduction of bicarbonates to formate under identical conditions (80 °C, 60 bar H2, 20 mL water).71 Utilizing KHCO3 as the carbon source gave a two-fold higher TON than NEt3-assisted CO2 reduction (1883 in 1.5 h vs 866 in 12 h). Other types of bicarbonates including NH4HCO3 and NaHCO3 also exhibited superior TONs to NEt3-assisted CO2 reduction. Interestingly, alkali hydroxides (KOH and NaOH) gave excellent TONs above 4000, probably owing to the high bicarbonate concentrations resulting from the reaction of alkali hydroxides with CO2. A similar case also occurred for Pd/TiO2 catalyst reported by Zhang et al.94 In another study of bicarbonate hydrogenation, the dependence of catalytic performance (TOF) on bicarbonate concentration was revealed by comparing the TOFs of bicarbonates with different cations (e.g., Na+, K+, NH4+).76 These bicarbonates displayed the TOF order of NaHCO3 (527 h−1) < KHCO3 (567 h−1) < NH4HCO3 (782 h−1), well consistent with the ascending trend of their bicarbonate concentrations in water, that is, NaHCO3 (0.61 M) < KHCO3 (0.89 M) < NH4HCO3 (0.92 M), as determined by 13C NMR.
To summarize, most endeavors have been directed to improve CO2 adsorption and H2 activation abilities of Pd nanocatalysts, which are associated with the number of basic sites and the dispersion Pd atoms, respectively. Engineering the basic properties of support materials to enhance CO2 adsorption and stabilize small-sized Pd particles is widely used as an effective approach to fabricate highly-efficient Pd nanocatalysts. The cooperation catalysis of Pd nanoparticles with basic sites presumably on the interface of Pd and support is perceived as the key to achieve excellent performances.

3.2 Ru-Based nanocatalysts
Ru-Based nanocatalysts are another most examined catalytic metal system for CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid/formate. The commonly used supporting materials to disperse Ru include Al2O3, hydrotalcite, AC, TiO2, and silica. These supports are characterized by abundant hydroxyl groups on their surface to provide strong interaction with Ru, which has been claimed to be advantageous in enhancing the catalytic activity of Ru. For example, Hao et al. compared the catalytic activities of Ru species supported on γ-Al2O3, AC, and MgO.100 The concentration of hydroxyl group followed the order of γ-Al2O3 > AC > MgO (almost no hydroxyl groups on MgO as measured by FTIR). Correspondingly, Ru/γ-Al2O3 showed the highest TON of 91 followed by Ru/AC with a TON of 10, whereas MgO without hydroxyl groups was inactive for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate under identical conditions (ca. 80 °C, 50 bar H2, 83.5 bar CO2, 1 h, 5 mL NEt3). Liu et al. reported the same beneficial effect of hydroxyl groups for Ru nanoparticles supported on γ-Al2O3 with varied morphologies.101 According to the literature,100,102 the hydroxyl groups on metal oxides primarily play two roles in this reaction: (1) favoring the formation of highly-dispersed amorphous Ru species (hydroxide or metallic) and Ru single atom; (2) acting as hydroxyl ligands to increase the electron density of Ru, as will be discussed in Section 4.2.
The catalytic performances of metal oxide-supported Ru catalysts strongly depend on the nature of Ru species. It was observed that highly dispersed amorphous Ru hydroxide species as well as Ru single atoms are more active than crystalline Ru oxide (RuO2).100 The structure of Ru species is influenced by Ru loading and the applied pH conditions during synthesis, which in turn affected catalytic activity. In the case of Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalyst prepared under basic conditions,100 it was found that the TON (in 1 h) of formate first increased to the highest value of 139 (pH = 12.8) and then sharply decreased to 32 (pH = 13.2), with increasing pH from 12 to 13.2, as shown in Fig. 7. According to XRD, the formation of amorphous Ru hydroxide species was favorable at pH ≤ 12.8, while crystalline RuO2 phase started to form when pH > 13, thus leading to a huge drop in TON. With respect to the effect of Ru loading, a maximum TON of 90 in 1 h was achieved at a low Ru loading of 2 wt% for Ru/γ-Al2O3, due to the predominant formation of highly-dispersed amorphous Ru hydroxide species, as indicated by XRD and TEM. Further increasing Ru loading to 6 wt%, the amorphous Ru hydroxide species aggregated to form RuO2 crystallites, which resulted in a reduction of TON by 50. In addition, the synthesis of highly dispersed Ru hydroxide species can be realized by the co-precipitation of Ru3+, Mg2+, Al3+ to afford hydrotalcite-supported Ru catalyst (Ru/HT),103 in which amorphous Ru hydroxide species were homogeneously incorporated into the framework of HT. Benefiting from the inherent basicity of HT, the Ru/HT catalyst afforded a TON of up to 11389 at 60 °C within 24 h in methanol/H2O without base (Table 2, entry 27). Moreover, hydrotalcite could also be used to construct a well-defined single atom Ru catalyst within its matrix, as discussed later in Section 4.2.

Most nanostructured Ru catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation involved metallic Ru species as the catalytically active component for H2 dissociation. For example, colloidal Ru nanoparticles suspended in methanol prepared by in situ reduction of RuCl3 was applied as an efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction to formate.104 The metallic Ru species afforded a high TON of 6351 at 80 °C after 3 h in methanol/H2O/NEt3 (Table 2, entry 28), whereas the unreduced catalyst containing Ru(III) species exhibited an inferior TON of approximately 500 under identical conditions. Kabra et al. described the application of metallic Ru nanoparticles supported on polyurea for the hydrogenation of supercritical CO2 (144 bar H2/CO2),105 yielding a high TOF of 11900 h−1 at 70 °C in the presence of trihexyl (tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride as solvent (Table 2, entry 29). Such high efficiency was primarily ascribed to the employed supercritical conditions. A binary catalyst system, comprising metallic Ru clusters (Ru3(CO)12) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-butylimidazolium acetate (BMMI·OAc), was developed by Weilhard and co-workers.106 A TON of 17000 was obtained at 70 °C and 70 bar CO2/H2 (3/4) after 168 h in the absence of base (Table 2, entry 30). The excellent performance was attributed to the multiple roles of BMMI·OAc: (i) a surfactant to stabilize the ultrasmall Ru clusters; (ii) a buffer to shift the equilibrium by neutralizing formic acid; (iii) capturing CO2 and transforming it to bicarbonate; (iv) shifting equilibrium by reducing entropic difference. Apart from metallic Ru species, heterogeneous Ru(II) species were also found to serve as active as metallic Ru NPs for CO2 reduction. For example, the amorphous Ru hydroxide species in the aforementioned Ru/HT and Ru/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were proved to have an oxidation state of +2 by XPS.100,103 According to the mechanistic insights into homogeneous CO2 reduction on Ru(II) complexes,107–109 amorphous Ru(II) hydroxide was proposed as the active site participating in the catalytic cycle. As shown in Fig. 8, Ru(II) hydroxide was first transformed to Ru hydride species by H2 accompanied by the elimination of water. By insertion into Ru-hydride, CO2 was subsequently reduced to an intermediate of Ru-formate complex, which was finally released to form formate. Meanwhile, the Ru center was regenerated to the initial Ru(II) hydroxide species assisted by water.

In addition to base additives, the catalytic performances of Ru-based catalysts could be greatly promoted by adding proton sources such as H2O and KH2PO4. For example, Zhang et al. synthesized a 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) modified Ru/Al2O3 catalyst (Ru-DBU/Al2O3) by a wet impregnation method.110 The resultant Ru-DBU/Al2O3 catalyst showed much higher TOF (66 vs. 15 h−1) than Ru/Al2O3. This is attributed to the nucleophilic nature of DBU capable of facilitating the formation of Ru-hydride species. Moreover, a substantial increase of TOF from 66 to 197 h−1 was obtained upon the addition of KH2PO4 at 80 °C and 120 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) in ethanol/NEt3 (Table 2, entry 31). Following this work, a well-known electron-donation ligand triphenylphosphine (PPh3) was employed as the electronic promoter to enhance the H2 splitting ability of Ru/Al2O3.111 The modified Ru-PPh3/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited high activity towards the formation of formate with a TOF of 263 h−1 at 80 °C and 120 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) in ethanol/H2O/NEt3. The addition of an appropriate amount of KH2PO4 (ca. 3 mmol) resulted in a 3-fold increase of TOF of up to 751 h−1 (Table 2, entry 32). As mentioned above, water is considered as a favorable solvent for CO2 reduction as its solvation effect can compensate the unfavorable enthalpy contributions. Additionally, Umegaki et al. disclosed that adding a small amount of water (2 mL) can promote the formation of formate over metallic Ru colloids in methanol/NEt3 with a TON of 6351 in 3 h, almost 13 times higher than that without water.104 However, when adding an excess amount of water (ca. 4 mL), the TON was sharply reduced to one-sixth, which was due to the oxidation of metallic Ru species, as indicated by UV-vis. This finding further emphasized the high activity of metallic Ru species. To sum up, the beneficial effect of adding proton sources could be ascribed to the enhanced electrophilicity of carbon atom in CO2 by the formation of hydrogen bond between proton and CO2, thus facilitating CO2 insertion into Ru-hydride species, as is the case for homogeneous catalysis.112,113
In summary, the catalytic performance of Ru nanocatalysts is determined by the size and oxidation states of Ru species. By interacting with the hydroxyl groups on metal oxide supports, highly dispersed Ru nanoclusters in the form of Ru(II) hydroxides are formed and show higher activity than RuO2. Unsupported metallic Ru nanoparticles stabilized by ionic liquid have been also demonstrated to show high activity. The addition of proton source (e.g., H2O, KH2PO4) could exert activation effects on CO2 probably by hydrogen bond interactions, thus improving the catalytic performance.
3.3 Au-Based nanocatalysts
Au had long been perceived as inert for catalytic hydrogenation reactions because of its poor ability in splitting H2. A turning point appeared in 1973, at which Bond and co-workers declared the outstanding catalytic activities of supported-Au particles when downsizing the particle size of Au to a few nanometers for olefin hydrogenation.114 It has become clear that Au-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions are structure-sensitive and the highly-dispersed Au species function as the real active site.115 However, the construction of ultra-small Au nanoparticles stabilized by a tailored support material remains a great challenge. As a result, the development of heterogeneous Au catalysts for CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid significantly lags behind that of Pd- and Ru-based nanocatalysis, with only a few successful examples reported to date.
The first example was the application of a commercial Au/TiO2 catalyst (AUROlite) for the continuous hydrogenation of CO2 to formate in the presence of NEt3 as both solvent and base reported by Preti et al.116 Au/TiO2 was found to be very stable for a long-term test (37 days) and gave a total TON of 18040 (Table 2, entry 33), corresponding to a mass yield of up to 1.326 kg HCOOH/NEt3 adducts. A tiny amount of CO was also produced as a side product with a selectivity of 0.5%, possibly stemming from the competitive reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Following this study, Filonenko and co-workers performed a broad support screening to optimize the activity of Au nanoparticles, including Al2O3, TiO2, ZnO, CeO2, MgAl-HT, MgCr-HT, and CuCr2O4.117 Catalytic activities of Au catalysts strongly depended on the choice of support. Among these supports, Au/Al2O3 displayed the highest activity with a TON of 215 at 70 °C within 20 h (Table 2, entry 34), two times higher than Au/TiO2. The combined characterizations of XPS, XRD, H2-TPR, together with cyanide leaching experiments, revealed that metallic Au species served as the real active site for H2 dissociation. Considering the similar sized Au particles (1.9 vs. 2.6 nm) present on Al2O3 and TiO2, the superior performance of Au/Al2O3 was likely related to the capability of Al2O3 in assisting the heterolytic dissociation of H2 as well as adsorbing CO2 in the form of bicarbonate. A detailed catalytic cycle will be elaborated in Section 5.2. Well-dispersed Au species on ZrO2 was explored for base-free hydrogenation of CO2 to methyl formate (MF) in methanol by Wu et al.118 The particle size of Au could be tuned by changing the applied pH conditions to deposit Au ions on ZrO2. The smaller-sized Au/ZrO2-9 catalyst (1.9 nm) synthesized at pH = 9 showed a TOF of 102 h−1 (Table 2, entry 36), which was two-fold higher than that of the Au/ZrO2-10.5 catalyst (2.4 nm) prepared at pH = 10.5.
Functionalizing support with nitrogen-containing moieties appears as an effective approach to improve the catalytic performance of Au catalysts. In 2017, Liu et al. demonstrated that the Schiff-base modified SiO2 could serve as an excellent support to disperse ultra-small Au nanoparticles (<2 nm), which were highly active for the direct reduction of CO2 to formate.72 Under optimized conditions (80 bar H2/CO2 (5/3), 90 °C, H2O/CH3OH (20:80, v/v)), a high TON of 14470 was reached over Au/SiO2-Schiff in the presence of NEt3 in 12 h (Table 2, entry 37). In contrast, primary amine modified Au catalyst (Au/SiO2–NH2) afforded a much lower TON of 1026 under identical conditions (Table 2, entry 38). Based on experimental, characterization, and computational results, the excellent performance of Au/SiO2-Schiff was attributed to the dual functions of Schiff-base moiety. First, CO2 was weakly bound to Schiff-base group via the formation of a reactive intermediate of zwitterion adduct (Fig. 9), while CO2 was predominately transformed into a relatively stable ionic carbamate by reacting with the primary amine group on Au/SiO2–NH2. Second, electron-donating effects render Au negatively charged, favoring the formation of reactive hydride species. In contrast to the superior capability of Pd in reducing bicarbonates, Au/SiO2-Schiff exhibited a poor activity for NaHCO3 reduction (without pressurizing CO2) with a TON as low as 195 in 12 h. It was therefore concluded that the reaction proceeded over Au/SiO2-Schiff catalyst not via conventional carbonate/bicarbonate intermediates, but rather via the zwitterion adduct formed between the Schiff-base moiety and CO2 (Fig. 9), as proven by in situ DRIFTS. Moreover, they synthesized a purely single-atom Au/SiO2-Schiff catalyst, which was proved to be inactive for CO2 reduction. The cationic and electron-deficient nature of singly-dispersed Au sites might account for their inert catalytic behaviors. A follow-up study by the same group disclosed the size-dependent catalytic activities of Au/SiO2-Schiff.119 By using a solid-state reduction method, they synthesized a series of Au/SiO2-Schiff catalysts with different sizes ranging from 1 to 7.3 nm. With increasing Au particle size from 1 to 2.8 nm, a notable decline of the TON (in 7 h) of formate from 9278 to 2997 was observed. No product was formed when further increasing Au particle size to 7.3 nm. As revealed by XPS, with decreasing particle size to sub-nanoscale, Au species were gradually becoming electron-rich due to the transition of electronic structures from continuous to discrete energy bands, which was proposed to account for the observed particle size dependence.

Most recently, Yang et al. reported the dependence of product selectivity on the sizes and electronic structures of Au clusters.120 They prepared three well-defined Au clusters with different atomicity including [Au9(PPh3)8](NO3)3 (Au9), [Au11(PPh3)8Cl2]Cl (Au11), and Au36(TBBT)24 (Au36) capped by various organic ligands (Fig. 10). These Au clusters were further deposited on ZrO2, CeO2 and SiO2 and examined for CO2 hydrogenation. Regardless of the applied supports, Au36 catalysts always displayed high selectivity towards formic acid (>80%) at 120 °C after 12 h (Table 1, entry 39), whereas methane (≈90%) and ethanol (>80%) were produced as the main products over the Au9 and Au11 catalysts, respectively. The utilization of different organic ligands led to similar product distributions, suggesting that the distinct product selectivities were related to the different intrinsic activities of Au clusters. According to EXAFS results, all Au species were present as positively charged and average oxidation state increased following the order of Au36 < Au11 < Au9, indicating their distinct electronic energy levels due to the quantum size effect. As a result, these clusters displayed different binding abilities towards specific reaction intermediates (e.g., HCOO*, COOH*, CO*, CH2*), thus resulting in varied product selectivities, as confirmed by DFT calculations. For the Au36 catalyst, its weak binding strength towards HCOO*, followed by facile hydrogenation, enabled the kinetically-favored formation of formic acid.

In summary, the size of Au ensembles has been identified as the key parameter governing the activity of Au nanocatalysts. Moderate activities can be obtained on small sized metallic Au nanoparticles (1–2 nm) dispersed on various metal oxides including SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2. The functionalization of SiO2 with Schiff-base groups leads to a significant enhancement in the activity, owing to the promotional roles of Schiff-base groups in activating CO2 and generating electron-rich Au atoms. Product distribution can be regulated by tailoring the number of Au atoms in the unsupported Au clusters stabilized by P-based ligands. The increase of Au atomicity from Au9 to Au36 results in the main product switching from methane to formic acid as a result of the distinct electronic properties of Au nanoclusters.
3.4 Bimetallic nanocatalysts
Bimetallic nanoparticles often bear distinct electronic and geometric structures compared to their monometallic counterparts, thus giving rise to unique catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalytic reactions.121 In this regard, quite a few bimetallic nanocatalysts have been developed for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate/formic acid. With respect to catalyst formulation, Pd is the most commonly used active component, which is typically modified by a second transition metal such as Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Mn, and Ni. The geometric and electronic properties of Pd can be tailored by chemically bonding with the doped metals as well as by architecture engineering (e.g., alloy, isolated, core shell). As a result, an improvement in activity was usually observed on transition metal-modified Pd catalysts.
Yamashita et al. demonstrated excellent catalytic activities of PdAg nanoparticles arising from the positive alloying effect of Ag with Pd.122 They prepared a series of PdAg alloy nanoparticles with tailored architectures including Pd@Ag/TiO2 (Pd core, Ag shell), Ag@Pd/TiO2 (Ag core, Pd shell), and PdAg/TiO2 (random distribution), as shown in Fig. 11A. In the case of Pd@Ag/TiO2, most Pd atoms resided in the core of PdAg alloy nanoparticles with a few Pd atoms being exposed on the surface surrounded by Ag atoms in an isolated configuration, as proven by scanning transmission electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping (STEM-EDS), EXAFS, and CO-FTIR. These PdAg nanoparticles were examined for CO2 reduction to formate at 100 °C for 24 h under 20 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in the presence of NaHCO3. The unique architecture of Pd@Ag/TiO2 enabled the highest TON of 14839 in 24 h (Table 2, entry 40), 12-fold higher than the monometallic Pd/TiO2 catalyst (Fig. 11A), whereas no product was observed over Ag/TiO2 catalyst. Obviously, the intrinsic activity of Pd atoms can be remarkably improved upon alloying with Ag atoms. XPS and CO-FTIR revealed the electron transfer from Ag to Pd atoms on all PdAg particles because of the higher electronegativity of Pd than Ag (2.2 vs. 1.9). Among others, Pd atoms in Pd@Ag/TiO2 were the most negatively charged. Notably, a nearly liner correlation could be established between the binding energy of Pd 3d5/2 and TON in 24 h (Fig. 11B). The TON increased as the Pd 3d5/2 binding energy decreased (indicating the electron-enriched Pd). Accordingly, the excellent performance of Pd@Ag/TiO2 was attributed to the formation of electron-rich and isolated Pd atoms by binding with neighboring Ag atoms. Based on DFT and kinetic investigations, it was concluded that Ag atoms just served as electronic modifiers to enrich the electron density of Pd rather than providing active sites for the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the underlying reason for the high activity of electron-riched Pd species was revealed by DFT calculations. Pd atoms with high electron density could produce reactive hydride species with enhanced hydricity, thus significantly reducing the kinetic barrier of the nucleophilic attack of hydride at bicarbonate by 130.5 kJ mol−1.

In an effort to improve the durability of PdAg catalyst, Wen and co-workers encapsulated PdAg nanoparticles into a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) affording a core–shell structure to suppress the aggregation of PdAg nanoparticles (ZIF-8@PdAg@ZIF-8).123 The spatially-confined PdAg alloy nanoparticles showed an improved stability with a nearly unchanged TON of around 1191 in 24 h for three consecutive activity tests (Table 2, entry 41). In another work, the group of Yamashita reported the encapsulation of PdAg nanoparticles along with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) into a hollow mesoporous organosilica sphere (HMOS) as a bifunctional catalyst to activate both CO2 and H2.124 As shown in Fig. 12, the introduced PEI containing abundant amine moieties was in close proximity to PdAg nanoparticles, functioning as CO2-adsorbing sites to concentrate CO2 in the vicinity of H2 activation sites (PdAg). As a result, a wealth of catalytically active interfacial sites were created on the bifunctional PdAg–PEI@HMOS catalyst, as is the case for the aforementioned Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst. Benefiting from the cooperative catalysis of PdAg and PEI, a superior TON of 2754 was achieved in aqueous NaOH solution under 20 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) within 22 h (Table 2, entry 42). Meanwhile, PdAg–PEI@HMOS exhibited excellent stability without activity decline during five successive tests affording a total TON of 13700 in 110 h. However, a pronounced deactivation occurred in the second test for the non-encapsulated PdAg/PEI catalyst. The enhanced recyclability was ascribed to the confinement effect and alkali-tolerant nature of organosilica shell. Interestingly, kinetic studies showed a negative apparent activation energy of −11.3 kJ mol−1 on PdAg-PEI@HMOS, featuring enhanced activity with decreasing reaction temperature. This is likely related to the favorable CO2 enrichment at low temperatures due to the strongly exothermic nature of CO2 adsorption on PEI (ΔrHθ = −83 kJ mol−1).

The same group also developed a number of amine-functionalized materials as supports to further improve the catalytic activities of PdAg alloy nanoparticles.124–127 The introduction of amine moieties to disperse PdAg alloy nanoparticles possesses four advantages: (i) promoting the formation of smaller nanoparticles; (ii) donating electrons to Pd; (iii) assisting the reduction of bicarbonate intermediate by forming hydrogen bonds; and (iv) CO2 adsorption. For example, they prepared PdAg nanoparticles supported on amine-containing polymers by Mannich reaction of resorcinol and 4,6-diaminoresorcinol hydrochloride (PdAg/amine-RF).126 The catalytic performances of PdAg/amine-RF catalysts for CO2 reduction to formate could be linearly correlated to their N contents (Fig. 13). A maximum TON of 867 was obtained over PdAg/amine-RF10 with the highest N content (ca. 3.8 wt%) in 24 h (Table 2, entry 43). With the increase in amine content, the particle size of PdAg monotonously decreased from 4.8 to 2.3 nm possibly due to the increased formation of Pd–N bonds, as evidenced by TEM and EXAFS. Meanwhile, XPS indicated that high amine content led to electron-enriched Pd species resulting from the electron transfer from amine groups, in addition to the electron-donation effect of Ag atoms. DFT calculation showed that the activation energy for formate production could be notably lowered to 156.2 kJ mol−1 over the amine-modified PdAg nanoparticles, in comparison to the unmodified counterpart (Ea = 300 kJ mol−1). Accordingly, the superior activity of PdAg/amine-RF10 with high amine contents was ascribed to the presence of well-dispersed electron-rich PdAg nanoparticles as well as the assisting role of amine groups in reducing bicarbonate. The influence of various amines modified PdAg nanoparticles on the synthesis of formate was also studied.127 Among the examined amines in Scheme 3, the highest activity was obtained over phenylamine-modified PdAg nanoparticles with a TON of 874 in 24 h at 100 °C under 20 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) (Table 2, entry 44). The superior performance was speculated to be related to the relatively weak basicity of phenylamine, which can enable moderate interactions with reaction intermediates (e.g., bicarbonate, formate). However, further studies are required to achieve a clear understanding of the underlying reason. A follow-up study from the same group explored phenylamine-modified mesoporous carbon to immobilize PdAg alloy nanoparticles (PdAg/amine-MSC).125 The PdAg/amine-MSC catalyst showed a TON of 839 in 24 h (Table 2, entry 45), which was 2-fold higher than that over monometallic Pd/amine-MSC and unmodified PdAg/MSC catalysts. The adsorption capacity of MSC towards CO2 was improved by 1.5 times upon modifying with phenylamine, thus contributing to the high activity of PdAg/amine-MSC. Compared with the unmodified PdAg nanoparticles, the introduction of phenylamine led to a notable reduction of PdAg particle size by 2-fold, thus leading to superior activity. As indicated by DFT calculations, the activation energy of formate formation was substantially reduced compared to that without phenylamine (134.3 vs. 236.4 kJ mol−1), due to the formed hydrogen bonds between phenylamine and bicarbonate intermediate. This was proposed as another reason for activity enhancement, which, however, needs to be verified by experimental evidences.

Non-noble metals, including Co, Ni, Mn, and Cu, appear as suitable components to modify Pd affording cost-effective bimetallic nanocatalysts. For instance, Sun et al. reported in 2019 the embedded PdCo nanoparticles into mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) by a one-pot ligand-protected method (Scheme 4).128 As a result of the spatial confinement of MSN, evenly distributed PdCo nanoparticles with an average size of 1.7–1.9 nm were obtained, whereas the conventional impregnation method gave a larger size of 4.4 nm. It was observed that the metallic Pd 3d peak shifted to lower binding energies in XPS spectra with the addition of Co, indicating an electron transfer from Co to Pd. At the optimal Pd/Co molar ratio of 0.8/0.2, Pd0.8Co0.2@MSN afforded a high TOF of 1824 h−1 at 100 °C in aqueous KHCO3 solution (Table 2, entry 46), which was four-fold higher than monometallic Pd@MSN. The enhanced performance was attributed to electron-rich Pd centers as well as ultrafine PdCo particles. Besides, the encapsulated PdCo nanoparticles could be reused 5 times without aggregation and loss of activity, indicating their excellent recyclability. Nguyen and co-workers described the use of PdNi alloy nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotube-graphene (CNT-GR) as an efficient catalyst for base-free hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid in water.129 HRTEM and XRD confirmed the formation of PdNi alloy with randomly distributed Pd and Ni atoms, wherein Pd atoms were slightly negatively charged due to electron transfer from Ni to Pd, as indicated by XPS. In comparison to Pd/CNT-GR, a more than two-fold increase of activity was observed over PdNi/CNT-GR (TON = 6.4) at 40 °C in 15 h under 50 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in water (Table 2, entry 47). DFT calculations indicated that the improved performance was tentatively ascribed to the synergetic catalysis of Pd and Ni active centers, that is, H2 dissociated to hydride species on electron-rich Pd sites and electron-deficient Ni sites could activate CO2 by binding to O atom. Sun and co-workers designed a highly active and stable PdMn alloy catalyst (PdMn0.6@S-1) by encapsulating ultra-small PdMn nanoclusters (<0.7 nm) into silicalite-1 zeolites via an in situ ligand-stabilized hydrothermal approach (Fig. 14).130 The resultant PdMn0.6@S-1 catalyst gave a high TOF of 2151 h−1 at 80 °C in aqueous KOH solution (Table 2, entry 49), and could be recycled 5 times with unchanged TOFs thanks to the outstanding confinement effects of silicalite-1 micropores. The superior activity was mainly ascribed to the addition of Mn to form PdMn alloy phases. This unique alloying effect was proved to enhance the electron density of Pd atoms but also promote the conversion of CO2/carbonates to bicarbonates, a key step for CO2 reduction to formate. Tsang et al. explored the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst, well-known for methanol synthesis, for the hydrogenation of CO2 to MF.131 Under mild conditions (150 °C, 10 bar CO2, 50 bar H2, 25 h), Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 gave a TOF of 31 h−1, which was further improved to 38 h−1 by adding Pd atoms (1 wt%) owing to the excellent H2 spill-over ability of Pd atoms (Table 2, entry 48). In contrast, doping the catalyst with other transition metals (e.g., Ru, Ni, Au,) afforded inferior TOFs to that of Pd–Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.

Interestingly, Qadir and co-workers designed a colloidal RuFe alloy nanocatalyst capped by an ionic liquid shell, which could realize selectivity-switchable conversion of CO2 to formic acid or hydrocarbons (Fig. 15).132 The anion type in ionic liquids was uncovered to regulate the microenvironments around RuFe active sites, thus directing the reaction pathways. A non-basic ionic liquid BMI·NTf2 together with RuFe alloy nanoparticles gave rise to C5–C6 hydrocarbons as main products (78% selectivity). It was reasoned that the hydrophobic and non-basic nature of NTf2 render the microenvironments around the RuFe active sites favorable to accommodate the required intermediates species such as CO2, CO, CH2*, HCO*, HCOH*, CH* for hydrocarbons formation. These species were typically generated from RWGS and the subsequent chain propagation via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). In contrast, the combination of hydrophilic BMI·OAc with RuFe alloy nanoparticles could catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid with a TON of 400 in 17 h at 60 °C in DMSO/H2O under 30 bar H2/CO2 (2/1) (Table 2, entry 50). The sole application of Fe nanoparticles was inactive. A TON as low as 19 was reached over monometallic Ru nanoparticles. These results suggested the beneficial effects of incorporating Fe into Ru. However, the origin of the enhanced activity of Ru by forming alloy with Fe is not clear yet. The basic and hydrophilic nature of BMI·OAc play double roles in promoting the formation of formic acid: as a buffer system to stabilize formic acid and favoring the formation of bicarbonates. Acetate anions (OAc−) were proven to dissociate water molecules to hydroxide species, which subsequently reacted with the trapped CO2 to form bicarbonates, as indicated by the in situ high-pressure (HP)-NMR.133 Bicarbonates were therefore proposed as the reactive intermediates being reduced on active RuFe sties to yield formic acid.

In summary, the reported studies involving bimetallic catalysts are principally oriented to improve the activity of Pd atoms by adding a second metal component. Many transition metals have been applied to form alloy with Pd and donate electrons to Pd atoms. As a result, electron-rich Pd sites and electron-deficient metal sites are generated. The synergetic catalysis arising from these two types of metal sites will facilitate the dissociation of H2 to form hydride species featuring high reactivity to reduce CO2. To improve catalyst stability, a series of porous materials including MOF, zeolite, and mesoporous silica have been utilized as supports to encapsulate and confine the small-sized bimetallic nanoclusters in their microporous or mesoporous channels.
4. Single-atom catalysts
With respect to nanocatalysts, especially for Pd- and Au-based catalysts, the metal–support interface was usually considered as the catalytically active center, wherein both H2 dissociation on metal sites and CO2 adsorption/activation on basic supports (e.g., N-doped materials, ZrO2, CeO2, TiO2) could take place in a concerted manner. In a recent work, the perimeter sites of SiO2-supported Ag nanoparticles have also been identified as the active centers for CO2 hydrogenation to MF.134 Therefore, it can be expected that when the active metal ensembles are downsized to single atom dispersion, the maximized interfacial sites will be achieved on SACs, wherein each metal atom bound to neighboring atoms act as an active center. Obviously, SACs can make full use of metal atoms and possess defined structures, resembling homogeneous metal complexes. However, the reduction of particle size is accompanied by the enhanced tendency of aggregation due to the increased surface free energies of the metal atoms.48 Besides, catalytic behaviors of SACs primarily depend on their electronic properties (more likely atomic orbitals), which are strongly affected by surrounding atoms. On these grounds, structure engineering of supporting materials with tailored binding sites to regulate the electronic properties of metal centers is of utmost importance in designing efficient SACs for CO2 reduction. In this respect, homogeneous catalysis has provided valuable clues for the synthesis of high-performance SACs, namely, well-defined molecular structures of metal complexes with achieved molecular level understandings. In particular, the well-developed immobilization of mononuclear metal complexes onto solid supports (e.g., silica, organic polymers, MOFs) represents a straightforward approach to fabricate heterogeneous SACs.135–137 Although immobilized metal complexes containing mononuclear metal atoms have been applied for CO2 reduction already before the emergence of the SAC concept, the new SAC concept has triggered more researches in this field and built a bridge between the heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.49,138–140 In view of their atomic dispersion feature and excellent performances, representative examples of immobilized mononuclear complexes were included in this review for discussion. In this section, we will describe the recent achievements in the field of SACs for CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate, which are categorized to three groups in accordance with the employed supporting materials: (i) porous organic polymers based SACs; (ii) metal oxides based SACs; and (iii) MOF based SACs. Table 3 provides an overview on the performances of SACs based on transition metals.

4.1 Porous organic polymer-based SACs
Porous organic polymers (POPs), typically built from diverse organic modules linked by covalent bonds, have emerged as a versatile platform for heterogeneous catalysis. The well-known properties of POPs such as tunable porous structures, large surface areas, good thermal stabilities, and customized functionalities, make them ideal supporting materials for SACs.141,142 Notably, the merits of classical heterogeneous catalysts and molecular metal complexes are merged into POPs, which feature rich binding sites provided by the organic building blocks to hold metal species and easy separation/reuse owing to their insoluble nature.143 As a result, well-defined and singly-dispersed active metal sites can be stabilized on POPs, affording POP-based SACs to bridge the material gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, when employing N-containing organic molecules as building blocks, POPs will be endued with CO2-philic properties favoring the adsorption/activation of CO2,144,145 leading to enhanced performance for CO2 reduction. Accordingly, N-containing POPs have been intensively explored as supports to synthesize SACs aiming at highly efficient hydrogenation of CO2 to formate/formic acid.

4.1.1 N-containing POP-supported SACs. 
As a subclass of POPs, covalent triazine framework (CTF), prepared by the intermolecular trimerization of aromatic nitriles, has attracted much interests in the field of CO2 adsorption/activation due to its abundant basic functional groups.146 In addition to triazine moieties, well-known organic ligands like pyridine, bipyridine, and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), could be incorporated into CTF by polymerizing the corresponding nitriles. The functionalized CTF has more accessible chelators with enhanced electron-donation abilities, and thus appear as a superior solid ligand to stabilize metal centers (e.g., Ir and Ru) that are catalytically active for CO2 reduction. In this manner, both basic sites and active metal centers were created on the functionalized CTF, which can potentially enable an integrated process of CO2 capture and reduction to formate/formic acid.
Motivated by the high efficiencies of half-sandwich Ir(Ru)–bipyridine complexes for the homogeneous reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate,33 substantial efforts were devoted to immobilize molecular Ru and Ir species onto bipyridine-based CTF (bpy-CTF) as efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts (Scheme 5). In 2015, Park et al. reported the first immobilization of molecular Ir(III) complex [IrCp*Cl2]2 (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) into bpy-CTF by a facile impregnation method (Scheme 5).147 The synthesized IrCp*@bpy-CTF afforded a high initial TOF of up to 5300 h−1 at 120 °C under 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in aqueous NEt3 solution (Table 3, entry 1), representing the highest activity over heterogeneous catalysts reported at that time. SEM and XPS confirmed the presence of uniformly dispersed Ir(III) species in electron-rich state as a result of the electron-donation nature of bpy ligand, which was proposed as the origin of the excellent performance. Nevertheless, a pronounced deactivation was observed for IrCp*@bpy-CTF with TON decreasing from 5000 to 3000 during five consecutive tests, probably due to the leaching of Ir species into solution, as proven by ICP. In another work, molecular Ru(II) complex ([Ru(C6Me6)Cl2]2, C6Me6 = hexamethylbenzene) was immobilized onto bpy-CTF to generate a heterogeneous Ru catalyst (RuC6Me6@bpy-CTF, Scheme 5), which afforded a lower TOF of 2640 h−1 than IrCp*@bpy-CTF under identical reaction conditions.148 During recycling tests, a gradually decreasing trend in TON was also found on RuC6Me6@bpy-CTF (Table 3, entry 2). In a follow-up work by the same group, they conducted a computational study to understand the leaching mechanism of Ir species during the reaction.148 DFT calculations revealed that the dissociation of Ir–bpy bond was very likely induced by the protonation of bipyridinic moiety resulting from H2 heterolysis on Ir sites (Scheme 6). Based on these insights, they suggested that the replacement of C6Me6 and Cp* by oxyanion ligands like carboxylate and acetylacetonate (acac), capable of capturing the formed proton, can block the proton transfer to the bipyridinic site, and thus improve catalyst recyclability. Following this protocol, an acac-bonded Ru(III) complex immobilized on bpy-CTF (Ruacac@bpy-CTF) was synthesized (Scheme 5).148 A TOF as high as 22700 h−1 was obtained over Ruacac@bpy-CTF at 120 °C under 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in H2O/NEt3 (Table 3, entry 3). Compared to the poor stability of RuC6Me6@bpy-CTF, Ruacac@bpy-CTF indeed displayed excellent recyclability without loss of activity over four consecutive cycles. These results indicated the key roles of oxygenic ligand like acac in enhancing both the activity and stability of immobilized Ru complex.

Several attempts have been made to bring the promising Ru-loaded bpy-CTF catalysts one step close towards industrial applications. Gunasekar and coworkers reported a practically viable heterogeneous Ru SAC by anchoring a simple and air-stable Ru(III) precursor (RuCl3) into bpy-CTF (Scheme 5).149 XPS measurements showed that Ru 3d peak was shifted toward lower binding energies by 1.4 eV after immobilization, indicating the successful coordination of RuCl3 to bpy ligands with the formation of electron-rich Ru centers. The resulted RuCl@bpy-CTF catalyst not only afforded an excellent TOF of 38800 h−1 (Table 3, entry 4), but also maintained its catalytic activities over five consecutive runs. According to XPS, SEM-EDS, and ICP results, the oxidation state and morphologies of Ru centers remained intact and a negligible amount of Ru was leached into the solution after recycling tests, implying the high durability of RuCl@bpy-CTF. Very recently, Park et al. reported the use of terephthalonitrile (TN)-modified bpy-CTF to anchor RuCl3 as a solid catalyst for the continuous hydrogenation of CO2 to formate in a fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 16).150 The introduced TN acts as a skeletal linker to improve the porosity and specific surface area of bpy-CTF, making more bpy ligands accessible for anchoring Ru cations (Scheme 5). An isolated Ru configuration by binding to bpy moieties was verified by XPS and EXAFS. The RuCl@TN-bpy-CTF catalyst manifested outstanding stability, giving a total TON of up to 524000 without appreciable deactivation during a long-term (30 days) activity test in a continuous fixed-bed reactor (Table 3, entry 5). Slight Ru leaching and no aggregated Ru particles were detected by ICP and STEM-EDS, respectively. The authors ascribed the superior stability to the generated stable coordination sphere of Ru species with the bipyridinic moieties in TN-bpy-CTF. Such a robust and efficient RuCl@TN-bpy-CTF catalyst demonstrated high feasibility for the practical manufacture of formate from CO2/H2. Another study investigated the continuous production of MF with an immobilized Ir(II) complex ([IrCp*Cl2]2) on a 2,6-dicyanopyridine-based CTF (IrCp*@DCP-CTF, Scheme 5).151 A promising space time yield of 944.4 mgMF gIr−1 h−1 (corresponding to a TOF of 3 h−1) was achieved by feeding a mixed gas stream of CO2/H2/CH3OH into a fixed-bed reactor at 180 °C and 300 bar. By means of transient in situ DRIFTS at 140 °C and 5 bar CO2, an intense band at 2334 cm−1 corresponding to the interaction between CO2 and DCP-CTF was clearly observed, indicating the inherent CO2 adsorption capability of CTF.

For the molecular complexes comprising N-ligands, it is known that their catalytic activities for CO2 reduction to formate are greatly affected by the electron-donating abilities of N-ligands, that is, a strong electron donor usually leads to high activity.33,152 Accordingly, Gunasekar et al. designed the incorporation of a strong electron-donating ligand NHC into CTF (NHC-CTF) as a nitrogen-rich support to immobilize [IrCp*Cl2]2.153 A bidentate coordination of Ir(III) centers bound to the pyridinic nitrogen and NHC sites was formed (Scheme 5), as confirmed by solid state NMR and XPS. As a result of the electron-donation role of NHC moieties, the immobilized Ir(III) centers possessed much higher electron density than IrCl3 with a binding energy shift of 0.7 eV, as indicated by XPS. As expected, the IrCp*@NHC-CTF catalyst exhibited an excellent TOF of up to 16000 h−1 (Table 3, entry 6), which was 3-fold higher than that obtained on IrCp*@bpy-CTF under identical conditions. The enhanced catalytic performance resulted from the superior electron-donating ability of NHC to bipyridinic units. However, the leaching of Ir species into solution occurred for IrCp*@NHC-CTF, resulting in unsatisfactory recyclability.
CTF analogues such as melamine- and heptazine-based covalent organic frameworks can also be used to immobilize molecular Ru and Ir complexes. For instance, Hariyanandam and co-workers described the heterogenization of molecular Ir complex ([IrCp*Cl2]2) onto heptazine-based framework (HBF-2) synthesized from dicyandiamide and biphenyldicarbonitrile (Scheme 5).154 The resultant IrCp*@HBF-2 afforded a moderate TOF of 1500 h−1 probably due to the relatively weak electron-donating properties of heptazine moieties (Table 3, entry 7). By comparing the catalytic performances of heterogeneous [IrCp*Cl2]2 catalysts containing various solid N-ligands (Table 3, entries 1, 6, and 7), it could be found that their activities increased with the enhanced electron-donating properties of solid N-ligands, that is, IrCp*@HBF-2 < IrCp*@bpy-CTF < IrCp*@NHC-CTF. This is in line with the aforementioned principle in homogeneous catalysis. Jaleel et al. synthesized a melamine-polymer network (MPN) containing secondary amine and triazine groups, which can anchor RuCl3 as a heterogenous Ru catalyst (Scheme 5).155 Ru centers were proposed to exist in bidentate coordination state by binding to the nitrogen atom of the secondary amine and triazine groups on MPN, as indicated by XPS results. A considerably high TOF of 4964 h−1 was obtained on RuCl@MPN at 120 °C under 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in H2O/NEt3 (Table 3, entry 8). For comparison, an immobilized RuCl3 catalyst onto g-C3N4 (RuCl@g-C3N4, Scheme 5) was also examined for CO2 reduction, giving a much lower TOF of 487 h−1 (Table 3, entry 9). Together with previous results of RuCl@bpy-CTF and RuCl@MPN (Table 3, entries 4 and 8), their activities increased in the order of RuCl@g-C3N4 < RuCl@MPN < RuCl@bpy-CTF, consistent with the increasing trend of electron-donating properties of these N-moieties. This finding further confirmed the positive dependence of activity on the electron-donating abilities of solid ligands regardless of ligand type.
Guided by this structure–activity relationship, a number of superior N-containing electron donors such as phenanthroline (phen),156 Tröger's base (TB),157 and porphyrin moieties have been incorporated into POPs as promising solid supports to fabricate heterogeneous molecular Ru/Ir catalysts.158 For example, the group of Yoon prepared a phen-based POP (phen-POP) by Friedel–Crafts cross coupling of phen derivatives with dichloromethane (Scheme 5).156 The synthesized phen-POP featured high-density bidentate nitrogen ligands (57 wt%) originating from phen, a well-known chelator with excellent coordination ability. As revealed by SEM-EDS and XPS, IrCl3 was uniformly and singly coordinated to the nitrogen sites on phen-POP in a bidentate manner. The Ir(III)-loaded phen-POP catalyst (IrCl@phen-POP) showed an impressive TOF of up to 40000 h−1 at 140 °C under 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in H2O/NEt3 (Table 3, entry 10), outperforming other Ir/Ru-loaded nitrogen-based POP catalysts. In contrast to the severe deactivation usually observed for immobilized Ir catalysts, IrCl@phen-POP displayed satisfactory recyclability with maintained TONs during three successive tests. Once again, the superior activity and stability of IrCl@phen-POP were attributed to the strong electron donating ability of phen moieties leading to robust coordination to Ir species. Yang et al. reported the TB-modified microporous organic polymer-anchored RuCl3 catalyst (RuCl@TB-MOP, Scheme 5),157 which possessed additional CO2 adsorption functions, viz. 127 mg g−1 at 1 bar and 0 °C, due to the presence of abundant microporosity and TB moieties. Under mild conditions (40 °C, 60 bar H2, 60 bar CO2), RuCl@TB-MOP afforded a high TON of 2254 after 24 h (Table 3, entry 11), but presented inferior stability due to Ru leaching during reaction. Distinct from the widely used post-complexation of metal species onto POPs, a Ru(II) porphyrin-based solid catalyst linked by benzobisthiazole (BBT) was reported by Eder et al., who directly copolymerized the pre-coordinated Ru(II) porphyrin complex with BBT (Scheme 5).158 The resulting Ru@BBT-POP catalyst showed reasonable activity (TON = 67) towards the catalytic reduction of CO2 to formate using dimethylphenylsilane as hydride source under 1 bar CO2 at 60 °C in 4 h (Table 3, entry 12).


4.1.2 Pincer-like POP-supported SACs. 
Metal centers (Ir, Ru) coordinated by PNP-type pincer ligands represent the highest performance class of molecular complexes for the reduction of CO2 to formate/formic acid. By mimicking the molecular structure of pincer ligands, the group of Zhang designed a pincer-like POP by the cross coupling of two functional building blocks of diaminopyridine (AP) and benzenetricarbonylchloride (Fig. 17A).159 Active Ir species were incorporated into AP-POP by wet impregnation and subsequent reduction of H2IrCl6 in the presence of NaBH4. The structural properties of Ir-loaded AP-POP catalyst were thoroughly characterized by solid state NMR, XPS, EXAFS, STEM-EDS, which revealed the atomic dispersion of Ir species featuring a tridentate coordination of Ir(III) sites to one pyridinic nitrogen atom and a pair of oxygen atoms of amide groups (Fig. 17A), resembling the typical structure of mononuclear Ir–PNP complexes. The Ir@AP-POP catalyst afforded a TON as high as 25135 at 120 °C and 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in H2O/NEt3 after 24 h (Table 3, entry 13), which was approximately 14 times higher than the supported Ir nanoparticles (ca. 2 nm) on AC (Fig. 17B). Evidently, single-atom Ir(III) catalyst was far more intrinsically active than its nanoparticle counterpart. Remarkably, no activity loss occurred during four successive tests (Fig. 17C), indicating the robust nature of Ir@AP-POP. Despite surpassing the vast majority of heterogeneous catalysts, the activity of Ir@AP-POP is still far from that of Ir–PNP complexes, probably due to the rather low porosity and surface area of AP-POP (less accessible active sites) as well as the weak electron-donating nature of the amide moieties.

Han and co-workers prepared a pincer-like cyclophosphazene-containing polymer (p-dop-POMs) by the condensation of 2,6-diaminopyridine with phosphonitrilic chloride (Fig. 18A).160 RuCl3 was subsequently immobilized onto p-dop-POMs by coordinating to triple N sites, i.e., two pyridinic N atoms and one phosphazene N atom, along with two hydride species and one chloride ligand forming an octahedral configuration (Scheme 5), as confirmed by EXAFS (Fig. 18B and C). The resultant Ru@p-dop-POMs exhibited a TON up to 25400 at 120 °C and 80 bar H2/CO2 (1/1) in H2O/NEt3 in 24 h (Table 3, entry 26). During three recycling experiments (Fig. 18D), the TON was maintained at around 20000 and no change of Ru centers was observed in terms of electronic state and coordinative configuration, indicating the good recyclability of Ru@p-dop-POMs. As a result of the strong electron-donor nature of tridentate N ligands, electron-enriched Ru centers were generated, as evidenced by EXAFS and XPS. According to DFT calculations, the rate-determining step of H2 heterolysis was facilitated on electron-enriched Ru centers with a low activation barrier of 0.52 eV, which could account for the high activity of Ru@p-dop-POMs.

4.1.3 Phosphine-containing POP-supported SACs. 
As a well-known P-donor ligand, phosphine has been widely employed to construct a large number of metal complexes showing fairly high activities for CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid.33 Therefore, there is great interest to build phosphine-based POPs for solid molecular catalysts. For example, the group of Palkovits has designed a polymeric analogue of diphenylphosphine (pDPPE) by the cross coupling of corresponding organic linkers and phosphorus salts.161,162 The obtained phosphine-based pDPPE polymer served as a perfect solid ligand to fabricate heterogeneous molecular Ru(II) catalysts, wherein each Ru(II) center was proposed to coordinate to two P donors (Scheme 5). The absence of Ru particles indicated the atomically-dispersed and well-coordinated structures of Ru species on pDPPE. A high TON of up to 13170 was achieved on Ru@pDPPE in 4 h at 120 °C and 100 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) in aqueous K2CO3 solution (Table 3, entry 14). In contrast, AC-supported Ru nanoparticles (Ru/AC) gave quite low activity (TON = 780). Recycling experiments showed a pronounced activity drop in the second run, which was likely due to the ligand exchange of p-cymene by CO (a poison for Ru) in the coordination sphere during the reaction, as well as the leaching and sintering of Ru species, as evidenced by solid state NMR, ICP, FTIR and STEM. McNamara et al. investigated the effect of ligand type on the catalytic activity of immobilized Ir(III) catalyst.163 Three PEI polymers containing monodentate PPh3 moieties (P), monodentate imine moieties (N), and bidentate iminophosphine (PN) moieties were synthesized (Scheme 5), respectively. These polymers were metallated with IrCl3. Their activities followed an order of IrCl@PN-PEI > IrCl@P-PEI > IrCl@N-PEI. The combination of PPh3 and imine gave the highest TOF (248 h−1, Table 3, entry 15), which was 6-fold higher than that achieved on the sole use of imine moieties (IrCl@N-PEI, TOF = 38 h−1). This was believed to result from the superior electron-donation property of PPh3 over imine groups. In another work of the same group, a similar trend was also observed for various N- and P-moieties immobilized on mesoporous silica (SBA-15).164 Once again, these results emphasized the vital role of electron donor groups in facilitating CO2 reduction to formate.
In summary, POP-based SACs are commonly constructed by the complexation of active Ir/Ru complexes onto the polymerized analogues of organic ligands. Electron-rich metal centers induced by the electron-donating coordination environment is of crucial importance to achieve high catalytic performance. Therefore, typical N- and P-based ligands containing strong electron-donating groups (e.g., bpy, PPh3, NHC, imine) are frequently utilized as the building units. These ligand-like building units should also comprise reactive groups that allow for cross-coupling reactions such as Friedel–Crafts and organolithium-mediated reactions, or various condensation reactions with the formation of connecting structures like triazine rings, imine bonds, benzothiazole groups, Troger's base, and amide bonds. By using these polymerization strategies, well-connected porous networks with sufficient surface areas can be built for the immobilization of more accessible active centers.

4.2 Metal oxide-based SACs
Metal oxide-based SACs reported for CO2 reduction to formate are mostly constructed by a well-developed surface-grafted strategy, that is, the immobilization of metal complexes via a functional linker grafted on the surface of metal oxides.136 Conventional silica materials are typically employed as the solid matrixes to graft molecular complexes due to their rich hydroxyl groups and large surface area. By tailoring the organic moieties of the functional linker, it can also serve as chelating sites to anchor active metal species. The application of metal oxide-based SACs in CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid has been well summarized in a review published by Álvarez in 2017.35 Herein, we will mainly focus on the latest findings on developing novel metal oxide-based SACs.
Recently, the group of Copéret developed two pincer-type metal complexes grafted on silica with high efficiencies by means of click reaction,165,166 namely, azide–alkyne cycloaddition. As shown in Fig. 19A and B, a Ru(II) complex containing NHC ligand was successfully anchored to mesoporous silica (SBA) by three steps: (1) incorporating NHC pincer ligand via click reaction; (2) passivating the surface of SBA to avoid side reactions when introducing Ru complex; and (3) the incorporation of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3.166 According to solid state NMR, IR, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), the formation of a tridentate Ru–NHC coordination sphere was confirmed (Fig. 19B). Under mild conditions (85 °C and 40 bar CO2/H2 (7/1)), the well-defined Ru(II)@NHC-SBA catalyst exhibited a high TON of 18000 within 24 h (Table 3, entry 16), which was two-fold higher than its homogeneous analogue. The origin of enhanced activity upon heterogenization remained unclear. In a similar way, a highly reactive Ir–PPh3 pincer complex was grafted onto mesoporous silica beads (MSB) (Fig. 19C),165 giving a high TON of 28000 within 24 h at 150 °C and 50 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) (Table 3, entry 17). However, both catalysts exhibited poor stabilities with pronounced drops of TONs during recycling tests, probably owing to the unstable Si–O–Si linkage between silica and metal complexes under basic conditions. In this regard, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) with amphoteric nature, tolerant to basic conditions and capable of adsorbing CO2, appear more attractive as solid matrix than silica. Kuwahara and co-workers reported a solid molecular Ir catalyst by immobilizing PEI-grafted Ir–PN complexes into the meso-channels of Na+ type-TNT (Ir@PN–PEI–TNT–Na, Fig. 20A).167 The active Ir(III) species were singly distributed inside the pores of TNT and bound to PN ligands in bidentate coordination, as evidenced by TEM, XPS and XAFS. A high TON of 1012 was achieved on Ir@PN–PEI–TNT–Na in 20 h at 140 °C and 20 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) in aqueous NaOH solution (Table 3, entry 19). Moreover, a positive correlation could be made between TON and CO2 adsorption capacity of different catalysts (Fig. 20B). These results clearly indicated the prominent contribution of TNT's basicity to catalytic performance. In contrast to the nearly complete loss of activity for Ir@PN–PEI after four recycling tests, the incorporation of Ir@PN–PEI into TNT–Na indeed markedly improved catalyst stability with only a slight decrease in TONs. The greatly improved stability was attributed to the amphoteric nature of TNT–Na, enabling robust interactions between PEI polymer and TNT–Na.

A purely inorganic single atom Ru catalyst without binding to organic ligands was designed by Mori et al. who deposited RuCl3 onto layered double hydroxides (LDHs) in aqueous NaOH solution.102 Structural characterizations revealed that singly dispersed Ru hydroxide species were stabilized on the surface of LDH by anchoring to the triple oxygen atoms from the hydroxyls of LDH as well as one hydroxyl and two water ligands attached to Ru, affording an octahedral coordination sphere (Fig. 21C). The resultant Ru@LDH catalyst gave a high TON of 698 within 24 h at 100 °C and 20 bar CO2/H2 (1/1) in aqueous NaOH solution (Table 3, entry 20). The catalyst could be recycled three times without significant loss of activity, and neither leaching nor aggregation of Ru species were found. The 3-fold chemical bonding formed between mononuclear Ru species and LDH was claimed to account for the robust nature of Ru@LDH. Meanwhile, such 3-fold hydroxyl ligands could make the Ru centers electron enriched by charge transfer. It was found that the catalytic activities (TONs) of metal oxide-supported Ru catalysts showed liner dependence on their Ru 3p binding energies (Fig. 21A), that is, a lower binding energy of Ru (corresponding to electron-rich state) enabled high TON. Accordingly, the electron donor function of hydroxyl ligands on LDH was claimed as the origin of high activity of Ru@LDH, as stated above for many other catalysts. Besides, a positive correlation was achieved between TON and CO2 adsorption abilities of various types of LDHs (Fig. 21B). The highest TON was reached on the optimized LDH with a Mg2+/Al3+ ration of 5/1 bearing the maximized basic sites. As a result of the abundant basic sites on LDH, CO2 could be locally concentrated near Ru centers, thus contributing to the catalytic activity of Ru@LDH. Despite featuring well-defined single-atom Ru sites, Ru@LDH exhibited much lower activity than the immobilized molecular Ru(II) catalysts with PPh3, bpy and NHC moieties, and also lower than nanostructured Ru catalysts containing amorphous Ru(II) hydroxide or metallic Ru species, as stated above. These results can reasonably suggest that the relatively low activity was very likely due to the high oxidation state of Ru(IV) species on Ru@LDH and the lack of electron-donating function of LDH, as indicated by XANES.

In summary, almost all metal oxide-supported SACs rely on surface-functionalized silica, which can offer a variety of binding sites with electron-donating function for metal complexation. Therefore, high activities can be achieved with the proper choice of organic groups and corresponding grafting strategies, as well as fine control on the surface functionalization process. Nevertheless, the poor stability is the major issue of SiO2-supported SACs owing to the intrinsically liable Si–O–Si connectors. There is only one report about the non-functionalized metal oxide-supported SAC prepared by depositing Ru hydroxides onto LDH, a pure inorganic material without organic functionalities. In comparison to SiO2-supported SACs, Ru@LDH gave better stability but much lower activity. The development of metal oxide-supported SACs is still in its fancy. Future effort should be directed to developing novel synthesis strategies for metal oxide functionalization to break the trade-off between activity and selectivity.
4.3 MOF-based SACs
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of organic–inorganic hybrid materials comprising diverse metal clusters and organic linkers, which are combined via coordination bonds in an orderly way. Owing to the abundant and tunable binding sites provided by organic linkers, MOFs have found tremendous applications as supporting materials for building SACs.168,169 In particular, the well-tailored MOFs with a large number of open metal sites and basic moieties (e.g., amine, pyridine, amide) have demonstrated outstanding efficiency for CO2 adsorption/conversion.170,171 Albeit holding great promise for CO2-relevant transformations, there have been only a few reports on the application of MOFs for catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formate/formic acid so far. In 2017, the group of Lin et al. designed an efficient Soxhlet-type reflux-condensing process for atmospheric CO2 reduction catalyzed by a solid molecular Ir(III) catalyst supported on a UiO-type bpy-modified MOF (Fig. 22 and Scheme 7).172 The introduced bpy moieties served as anchoring sites to coordinate to mononuclear Ir(III) complexes (IrCl3). To further enhance the activity of Ir, a hydroxyl moiety was introduced to generate a hydroxyl-substituted bpy ligand (bpyOH). The deprotonated hydroxyl-substituted bpy ligand could function as both an electron donor and a proton reservoir, which has exhibited high efficiency for homogeneous CO2 reduction to formate.173 Indeed, under very mild conditions (85 °C, 1 bar H2/CO2(1/1), NaHCO3), the resultant Ir@bpyOH-UiO-MOF catalyst showed an excellent TON of 6149 within 15 h (Table 3, entry 21), which was nearly 15 times higher than its OH-free counterpart. The high TON could be well maintained for three consecutive runs, and no leaching and structural changes was found for the active Ir centers. It was noteworthy that the Ir@bpyOH-UiO-MOF catalyst was transformed to an activated form during the reaction by exchanging chloride ligands in IrCl3 with H2O ligands, leading to a significant improvement of the TON by 11-fold. This enhanced activity was attributed to the catalytic role of H2O ligand in assisting proton transfer to generate formic acid on active Ir centers, as revealed by DFT calculations.

 Scheme 7  Proposed structures of MOF-based SACs for CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid/formate. 
Most recently, the group of Ma reported the immobilization of Ru complexes onto MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 as solid molecular Ru catalysts.174 They incorporated the functional moieties of salicylaldehyde (Sal) and 2-diphenylphosphinobenzaldehyde (DPPBde) into the skeleton of MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 by condensing with amine groups to generate a Schiff base linkage (Scheme 7). These modified MOFs were metalated with RuCl3 to give a series of immobilized molecular Ru catalysts: RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2, RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-Sal, and RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-DPPBde (Scheme 7). Ru(III) species were highly distributed within the matrix of MOFs, as indicated by XRD and TEM. RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-DPPBde gave the highest activity (TON = 242) at 120 °C within 2 h, followed by RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-Sal affording a TON of 218, and RuCl@MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 showed the lowest TON of 198. This activity trend is well consistent with their electron-donating abilities arising from different moieties, that is, monodentate NH2 < bidentate Sal (hydroxyl, Schiff base) < bidentate DPPBde (PPh3, Schiff base). Again, these results pointed to the beneficial effects of introducing electron-donating groups. In another work, Wu et al. employed azolium-containing MOFs (NHC-MOFs) as supports to construct immobilized Ru catalysts.175 Various Ru precursors including RuCl3, [RuCp*Cl2]2, and [Ru(C6Me6)Cl2]2 were loaded onto NHC-MOF affording RuCl@NHC-MOF, RuCp*@NHC-MOF, and RuC6Me6@NHC-MOF, respectively (Scheme 7). XRD and TEM-EDS characterizations showed an even dispersion of Ru species without the formation of nanoparticles. Among others, RuC6Me6@NHC-MOF gave the highest TON of 707, whereas RuCp*@NHC-MOF and RuCl@NHC-MOF exhibited lower activities with TONs of 454 and 313 (Table 3, entries 23 and 24), respectively, under identical conditions (120 °C, 40 bar H2, 40 bar CO2, ethanol/NEt3, 2 h). In contrast to the presence of Ru(III) species in RuCp*@NHC-MOF and RuCl@NHC-MOF, RuC6Me6@NHC-MOF possessed lower Ru 3p binding energy corresponding to Ru(II), as revealed by XPS. Accordingly, the superior activity of RuC6Me6@NHC-MOF was attributed to the formation of electron-enriched Ru(II) centers resulting from the stronger electron-donation ability of C6Me6 than Cp* and chloride ligands. This is in line with the aforementioned high activities of Ru(II) hydroxide species in nanostructured Ru catalysts. In addition, it was claimed that the utilization of DMF as solvent and adding K2CO3 can markedly improve the TON from 707 to 3803 (Table 3, entry 25), yet the underlying reasons are still unclear.
Despite the wide utilization of Pd as the active component for nanocatalysts, only one example of Pd SAC anchored on MOFs has been reported so far. By the solvothermal reaction of 2,2-bipyridine 4,4-dicarboxylic acid (bpydc) with MnCl2, Tshuma et al. synthesized a MOF containing bpy functional groups, which can coordinate to PdCl2 to form a Pd@bpydc-MOF SAC (Scheme 7).176 A high TON of 9816 was obtained over Pd@bpydc-MOF SAC at 100 °C and 50 bar H2/CO2 (4/1) in 24 h in the presence of KOH and ethanol (Table 3, entry 27). However, noticeable catalyst deactivation was observed during the stability test of Pd@bpydc-MOF, with the TON decreasing from ∼10000 to ∼6000 after four recycles. According to TEM and the mercury drop experiment, the aggregation of Pd(II) species to form metallic Pd nanoparticles on the spent catalyst was confirmed. The weak coordinative connection between Pd and bpy groups, as is the case for immobilized Ru/Ir complexes, was proposed as the major reason for the deactivation.
The direct encapsulation of molecular complexes inside the pore space of MOFs represents another feasible approach to fabricate MOF-based SACs. The key to enable the encapsulation process lies in the use of aperture-opening reaction resulting from the reversible dissociation of linker in the framework of MOF in protic solvents (Fig. 23A). By this novel strategy, the highly-active Ru–PNP pincer complex was successfully encapsulated into the pore space of the UiO-66 MOF.177 The resultant Ru–PNP@UiO-66 showed an excellent TON up to 320 000 at 27 °C in 30 min in the presence of DBU and DMF (Table 3, entry 28, and Fig. 23B), comparable to the Ru–PNP pincer complex. The similar activity indicated that Ru–PNP pincer complex remained intact during the encapsulation process. The prominent advantage of Ru–PNP@UiO-66 is its superior stability and recyclability over the Ru complex, as indicated by the unchanged TONs (around 300000) during five recycling tests and no detectable leaching of Ru complex and UiO-66 (Fig. 23B). Thanks to the appropriate size of Ru–PNP complex (smaller than the pore size of UiO-66 but larger than its aperture size), UiO-66 is able to perfectly stabilize and confine each individual Ru–PNP pincer complex in its pore space. Therefore, Ru–PNP@UiO-66 indeed realizes the target of SAC that combines merits of both high activity and good recyclability.

In summary, MOF-based SACs are currently fabricated either by utilizing the functionalized linker to anchor metal complexes or directly encapsulating metal complexes into the cavity of MOF. For the former linker-coordination method, the rational choice of organic linkers comprising functional groups with electron-donating properties is of great importance. For the direct encapsulation method, for a certain topology of MOF, only the molecular complexes with suitable dimensions (as mentioned above) can be successfully encapsulated. When used for catalytic CO2 reduction, the use of protic solvent and high reaction temperatures should be avoided. These requirements will limit the universality of direct encapsulation method. Both approaches can lead to high activities, but the direct encapsulation method can endow SACs with superior stability to the linker-coordination method, thanks to the pore confinement effects. It should be emphasized that there are still many opportunities for MOF-based SACs, e.g., transforming MOF-anchored metal complex into carbon-supported SAC by pyrolysis as well as encaging single atom alloy nanoclusters inside the pore of MOF. These directions are worthy to be explored in the future design of MOF-based SACs.
5. Mechanistic insights
Heterogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid/formate involves a gas–liquid–solid multiphase catalytic system, because of the prevailing employment of gaseous substrates (H2/CO2) with a solid catalyst in a liquid medium containing base and solvent. Such a complex reaction network further complicates the catalytic mechanisms associated with H2 and CO2 activation/transformation on catalyst surface. As a result, although a variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been developed with satisfactory performances, very few of them have been deeply investigated to achieve a clear, reasonable and complete mechanistic picture. Herein, we will first briefly summarize the relevant insights gained from experimental and theoretical studies with regard to the activation of H2 and CO2 on heterogeneous catalysts, and then highlight several well-studied examples of the proposed catalytic cycles.
5.1 H2/CO2 activation
Within a typical CO2 hydrogenation process, H2 and CO2 have to diffuse from gas to liquid phase, and finally to the active sites on solid catalysts, wherein H2 is widely accepted to dissociate into hydride species and proton via a heterolytic process. The role of hydride species is generally believed to fulfil a nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon atom of CO2 (or adsorbed HCO3−) affording an intermediate of metal-bound formate, as evidenced by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic results.106,126,178–180 This step is also known as so-called CO2 insertion into metal–hydride bonds,33 which is often identified as the rate determining step in the entire catalytic cycle for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, heterolytic cleavage of H2 has been proved to be the rate determining step for certain catalyst systems such as Ru@LDH,102 Ir@PN–PEI–TNT–Na,167 Ir@AP-POP,159 and Ruacac@bpy-CTF.148 Alternatively, H2 could also undergo a homolytic dissociation on metallic nanoparticles like Ru or Pd with the formation of two hydride species.46 However, heterolytic cleavage of H2 appears to be more feasible for CO2 reduction to formate due to the favorable kinetics and the presence of bifunctional active sites. In a typical H2 heterolysis process, hydride species is bonded to Lewis acidic metal center with the proton captured by the Lewis basic moieties,46,181 a mimic of H2 activation on frustrated Lewis pairs.182,183 As for the reported heterogeneous catalysts, most of them comprised metal centers (e.g., Ruδ+, Irδ+, Auδ+) with vicinal Lewis basic moieties like amine, pyridine, NHC, Schiff base, and hydroxyl serving as proton acceptor. This bifunctional formulation appears more suitable for the occurrence of H2 heterolysis rather than homolysis. Moreover, first principle calculations based on Au/NH3 couples indicated that the attack of hydride and proton species to CO2 could proceed with low energy barriers through either first hydride then proton transfer (0.4 eV) or concerted hydride and proton transfer (0.24 eV) routes (Scheme 8A).179 In contrast, the routes involving two hydrides transfers (from H2 homolysis) possessed much higher energy barriers above 1 eV. Therefore, H2 dissociation was perceived to proceed preferentially in heterolytic manner. Importantly, the concerted hydride and proton transfer has been recently proved on an immobilized molecular Ir catalyst experimentally.172 By conducting the reaction with D2 and/or D2O, An and co-workers discovered ultra large kinetic isotope effects for Ir@bpyOH-UiO-MOF, which suggested that the RDS of CO2 reduction to formate involved the concerted hydride and proton transfer (Scheme 8B).

As discussed for many catalysts, electron-enriched metal centers were found to be beneficial for catalytic performance. It was suggested that H2 heterolysis over electron-enriched metal centers can generate metal hydrides bearing more negative charges (described as being more hydridic for transition metal complexes),184 which can facilitate the nucleophilic reduction of CO2. This speculation was confirmed by a computational investigation on Au-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation.179 A positive correlation was established between the energy barrier of hydride species attacking the carbon atom in CO2 and the Bader charge change of hydride species (Fig. 24). It could be seen that the adsorbed hydride species (H*) bearing more negative charges showed lower energy barrier indicating higher reactivity towards the nucleophilic attack to CO2.

In contrast, it is still a debate how CO2 is transformed on the active site and no consensus has been reached so far. This is mainly due to the diverse CO2-derived species such as bicarbonate, carbonate, carbamate, and CO2–tertiary amine adduct involved in the complex reaction system. All of these carbonaceous species could be involved in the catalytic cycle and thus contribute to the production of formate. To be specific, there exists a common equilibrium of CO32−/HCO3−/H2O in aqueous alkaline solution, wherein HCO3− is widely accepted as the true substrate for CO2 hydrogenation especially on Pd catalysts.44 Opposed to the facile reduction of HCO3−, the direct reduction of CO32− to formate appears to be kinetically sluggish due to its high thermodynamic stability.185,186 For instance, when employing NaHCO3 and KHCO3 as the carbon source, a commercial Pd/AC catalyst afforded TONs up to 527 and 567 at room temperature in 1 h, respectively, whereas negligible TONs (<1) were obtained in the presence of Na2CO3 and K2CO3 as the carbon source.76 The similar poor reactivity of CO32− was also found for bimetallic PdCo catalysts.128 In the case of amine-modified catalysts such as Au/SiO2–NH2,72 Pd/ECN,78 and PdAg–PEI@HMOS,124 it has been demonstrated that during the reaction CO2 can be transformed into carbamate by reacting with primary or secondary amines as revealed by in situ DRIFT. Yet, it is unknown whether carbamate could be reduced to formate heterogeneously. So far, there has been no experimental or computational evidence reported to support the proposal of directly hydrogenating carbamate into formate, which is unlikely to occur due to the less electrophilic carbon atom in CO2 upon the formation of C–N bond. In fact, the inactive nature of methyl carbamate, a simple molecule in carbamate family, has been experimentally proved by Su et al.186 No formate was produced from the hydrogenation of methyl carbamate at 20 °C and 27.5 bar H2 over Pd/AC. Most likely, carbamate might indirectly participate in the catalytic cycle via re-decomposition into free CO2 following a typical CO2 reduction pathway.187 When tertiary amines are present as the catalyst promoter (e.g., Schiff base) or as the base additive (e.g., NEt3, DBU), a weakly bonded CO2–tertiary amine adduct, also called zwitterion adduct, can be formed.72 It should be noted that CO2 and tertiary amines are not linked by chemical bonds but rather dipole–dipole forces, essentially different from the aforementioned carbamates. Thanks to the weak interactions, CO2 can be readily released from such labile adducts to undergo hydrogenation. Therefore, despite the formation of CO2–tertiary amine adduct, the actual substrate involved in the catalytic cycle concerns CO2 still. In addition, the utilization of tertiary amines as the base could enable higher catalytic activities than primary and secondary amines. For example, in the presence of NEt3 and 20 bar CO2, the Au/SiO2-Schiff catalyst exhibited nearly 4 times higher TONs than that obtained with propylamine and dimethylamine.72 In contrast to the stable ionic carbamate generated between CO2 and primary/secondary amines, the liable interaction within CO2–tertiary amine adduct allowed the facile storage/release of CO2, which could partly account for the enhanced activity with tertiary amines.
Taken together, according to the real form of CO2 that participates in the catalytic cycle, there are two main reaction mechanisms widely accepted for the heterogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid/formate, namely, bicarbonate and CO2 reduction pathways. It should be mentioned that in most cases both pathways could simultaneously proceed to different degrees. The predominant reaction pathway for a certain system comes on a case-by-case basis dependent on the employed catalyst, solvent, basic additive, and the basic functionality on catalyst. For example, PEI modified PdAg bimetallic catalyst (PdAg–PEI@HMOS) showed an inferior TOF of 24 h−1 when using NaHCO3 as the carbon source, whereas the TOF was drastically improved to 153 h−1 with the addition of CO2 to the same reaction.124 As stated above, the activities of Pd-based catalysts are known to be dependent on bicarbonate concentration. Nevertheless, it was found that the TONs of PdAg–PEI@HMOS were independent on bicarbonate concentration. In contrast, the PEI-free PdAg@HMOS catalyst showed the expected TON enhancement with increasing bicarbonate concentration. These results implied that the introduction of PEI (containing amine moieties) to PdAg catalyst shifted the dominating reaction mechanism from bicarbonate pathway to CO2 reduction pathway via intermediates of carbamate or zwitterion adduct.
5.2 Proposed catalytic cycles
To illustrate the catalytic cycles associated with the two main reaction pathways, several studies manifesting reasonable mechanistic proposals have been chosen as examples here. Notably, the proposed mechanistic cycles for immobilized molecular SACs are essentially similar to their homogeneous counterparts. For a detailed mechanistic discussion of the homogeneous CO2 reduction to formate, readers are guided to several reviews.33,67,188,189
Filonenko et al. suggested a catalytic cycle for the reduction of CO2 to formate over Au/Al2O3 (Fig. 25).117 Within this cycle, CO2 and its adduct are considered as the real substrates since the reaction was conducted in non-aqueous media containing NEt3 and DMF. Both DMF and NEt3 were found to exist on the spent Au/Al2O3 catalyst, as evidenced by FTIR. Therefore, the desorption of solvent/base was proposed as the initial step to afford vacant site for H2 activation. The heterolysis of H2 on the interface of metallic Au nanoparticles and Al2O3 produces Au-hydride species with the concurrent generation of hydroxyl group on Al2O3. The formed hydroxyl group was speculated to react with CO2 giving bicarbonate intermediate according to FTIR results. The formation of bicarbonate intermediate was also detected on metal oxide-supported Pd catalysts.94 Subsequently, the nucleophilic attack of hydride to the adjacent bicarbonate species affords an intermediate of Au-bound formate, which is finally desorbed from the Au nanoparticles giving formic acid–NEt3 adduct.

Mori et al. proposed a bicarbonate pathway for CO2 hydrogenation to formate in aqueous NaOH solution over bimetallic PdAg/TiO2 catalyst.122 FITR results showed the characteristic band of bicarbonate (at 1454 cm−1) on PdAg/TiO2 upon treated with CO2 and basic aqueous solution. These formate and bicarbonate species were proven to orginate from CO2 by an isotopic experiment using 13CO2 in aqueous NaOH solution (Fig. 26). Kinetic investigations revealed the independence of the catalytic performance of PdAg/TiO2 on CO2 pressure. These results indicated that bicarbonate was produced as the true substrate in aqueous NaOH solution. The catalytic cycle starts with the dissociative adsorption of H2 on PdAg nanoparticles to provide Pd-hydride species (step 1 in Fig. 26), followed by the adsorption of bicarbonate on PdAg nanoparticles in a bridge manner (step 2 in Fig. 26). The subsequent reduction of bicarbonate by hydride likely proceeds via the nucleophilic attack at the carbon atom in bicarbonate (step 3 in Fig. 26), which was verified to be energetically favourable by DFT calculations. Finally, formate is formed by a dehydration step, which simultaneously recovers the active Pd sites (step 4 in Fig. 26). Within this cycle, the nucleophilic attack to bicarbonate was identified as the RDS based on the kinetic results. Note that the whole catalytic cycle on PdAg/TiO2 catalyst was suggested to proceed merely on metal nanoparticles without the participation of TiO2 support. This is distinct from the aforementioned reaction mechanism on Au/Al2O3 catalyst, which was believed to take place principally on the interface of the Au domains and Al2O3.

As discussed previously, the hydrogenation of CO2 over Au/SiO2-Schiff mainly proceeds through CO2 route rather than bicarbonate route via the intermediate of CO2–tertiary amine adduct. Based on this discovery, Liu and co-workers proposed a catalytic process for CO2 hydrogenation to formate catalyzed by Au/SiO2-Schiff catalyst.72 As shown in Fig. 27, gaseous CO2 is captured by NEt3 as zwitterion adducts in methanol/water and then diffuses to the interface of Au nanoparticles and Schiff base moieties, generating new zwitterion adducts with Schiff base moieties. Meanwhile, the dissociative adsorption of H2 occurs on the low-coordination Au atoms of Au nanoparticles, resulting in Au-hydride species. The CO2-Schiff base adduct is then reduced to Au-bound formate species by the adjacent hydride species via the nucleophilic attack to the carbon atom in CO2, which serves as the RDS because of the highest theoretical energy barrier of 1 eV. By a proton transfer process, the formic acid is finally formed and desorbed from Au surface.

A bicarbonate-assisted reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction to formate over heterogeneous Ruacac@bpy-CTF catalyst was proposed by Gunasekar et al.148 By comparing the XPS spectra of fresh and spent catalysts, it was found that the coordination environment of Ru(III) was changed by the partial substitution of acac ligand by bicarbonate species. Accordingly, the Ruacac@bpy-CTF catalyst was speculated to firstly undergo an activation process to form bicarbonate-ligated Ru complex as the true active center. DFT calculations suggested that the catalytic cycle is initiated by the formation of a vacant site on Ru for H2 adsorption by cleaving one Ru–O bond between Ru and bicarbonate (Fig. 28). A Ru-hydride species is then produced by bicarbonate-assisted H2 heterolysis along with the capture of proton by bicarbonate via a six-membered ring transition state. This is followed by the desorption of bicarbonate ligand with the help of NEt3. Subsequently, the insertion of CO2 into Ru-hydride produces an intermediate of Ru-bound formate, which is extracted as the final product accompanied by the re-adsorption of bicarbonate to regenerate the active Ru center.

Based on DFT calculations, Shao et al. mapped out a possible catalytic cycle for CO2 hydrogenation to formate over heterogeneous Ir@AP-POP catalyst.159 As described previously, the freshly synthesized pincer-like Ir@AP-POP catalyst contains chloride-ligated Ir(III) complex, wherein chloride ligands are replaced by hydride species during reaction as evidenced by XPS and EXAFS. Thus, the actual configuration of Ir@AP-POP taking part in the catalytic process comprises two hydride species and one hydroxyl ligand bonded to Ir center. As such, the in situ substitution of chloride ligand by other species (mostly hydride) is a common phenomenon for immobilized molecular catalysts, also occurring for Ru@pDPPE,162 RuCl@bpy-CTF,149 and IrCl@PN–PEI–TNT–Na.167 The catalytic cycle starts with CO2 adsorption onto Ir-hydride to trigger the nucleophilic attack of hydride to the carbon atom in CO2 (see i to ii in Fig. 29). The adsorbed CO2 is then readily transformed into the Ir-bound formate intermediate via a rotation step with a low energy barrier of 0.07 eV ((ii) to (iii) in Fig. 29). Interestingly, by bonding to the neighboring acidic H from amide moiety, the formate intermediate is readily reduced into formic acid, which remain bonded to the Ir center and amide moiety ((iii) to (iv) in Fig. 29). Assisted by the adsorbed formic acid, the subsequent heterolysis of H2 regenerates the Ir-hydride species along with a proton transfer to enable the liberation of formic acid ((v) to (vi) in Fig. 29). Meanwhile, the cleavage of O–H bond between the adsorbed formic acid and amide moiety recovers the acidic H in the amide moiety. Within this mechanistic cycle, the heterolytic dissociation of H2 with the highest energy barrier of 1 eV constitutes the RDS. It should be noticed that amine moieties adjacent to Ir on the solid ligand also play catalytic roles in the catalytic cycle. Although nominally known as single atom Ir catalyst, the essential active center on Ir@AP-POP is comprised of a group of active atoms, analogous to the aforementioned interfacial atom centers on nanocatalysts.

The aforementioned catalytic cycles clearly indicate the essential role of H2 activation/dissociation to form active metal-hydride species for all catalyst systems, whereas CO2 can either first undergo an activation step on adjacent basic sites or a direct insertion into metal-hydride species without pre-activation. In comparison, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate is believed to proceed primarily by the initial adsorption of CO2 bound to active sites, followed by protonation and two-electron transfer steps.56,190,191 By a concerted or step-wise proton/electron transfer, CO2 could be transformed either to an oxygen-bound intermediate OCHO*, a precursor to formate, or to a carboxyl intermediate (COOH−) leading to the formation of CO as a side product.192–194 The applied external electricity and electrolyte (e.g., aqueous bicarbonate solution) act as the electron and proton sources, respectively, thus circumventing the utilization of high H2 pressure. Obviously, the electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate is mechanistically distinct from CO2 thermocatalytic reduction, since electrochemical CO2 reduction is principally fulfilled by protons and electrons rather than by metal-hydride species from H2 activation. Note that tailored active centers with appropriate adsorption strength for the intermediates of thermocatalytic reduction (e.g., formate, bicarbonate), thus ensuring smooth activation/desorption of formates to avoid the occurrence of resting state, is the key factor for successful thermocatalytic cycles. Similarly, in order to inhibit the severe side-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction and CO formation via the carboxyl route, tailored electrodes (e.g., Sn) featuring favorable adsorption towards formate (HCOO*) intermediates over carboxyl species (COOH−) are indispensable.190,195
6. Comparison of SACs with nanostructured catalysts
According to the numerous examples in Tables 2 and 3, one can see that both singly dispersed and nanostructured metal species can catalyze the reduction of CO2 to formic acid/formate with medium to high activities (TONs/TOFs), dependent on the employed metal components, supporting matrixes, and reaction conditions. The optimization of these three parameters constitutes the main subject of most researches in the literature. Very few researches have rigorously studied the catalytic behaviors of SACs and their nanoparticle counterparts under similar experimental conditions, thus making the comparison of SACs with nanostructured catalysts inherently difficult. Here, we will try to showcase the distinct performances of SACs and their nanoparticle counterparts in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
As a result of the merits of higher atom utilization efficiency and finely-tuned microenvironments related to active sites, SACs are anticipated to possess higher activities than their nanostructured counterparts. Indeed, this holds true for some SACs in the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate. For example, Ir@AP-POP,159 Ru/pDPPE,161 and Ru@p-dop-POMs160 SACs were reported to show far superior TONs (more than 7 times) than the reference Ir/AC and Ru/AC nano-catalysts under identical reaction conditions. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the different properties of supports, i.e., the basicity of AP-POP, p-dop-POMs, and pDPPE vs. the relatively inert nature of AC, may also contribute to the observed activity enhancements. Accordingly, for a fair comparison of SAC with its nanostructured counterpart, it is highly demanded to fabricate a series of catalysts ranging from nanoscale to single atom on the same support. As such, a rigorous assessment of metal size effect can be realized. Unfortunately, the underlying reason of the activity discrepancy was not studied in these studies. Considering that metal species in different sizes could exist in either oxidized or reduced states, one possible explanation is the distinct H2 dissociation mechanism, which can determine the overall reaction rate. That is, H2 usually follows a homolytic cleavage on metallic nanoparticles, whereas the heterolysis of H2 could occur on SACs involving cationic metal centers, as stressed above.
For Pd- and Au-based catalysts, an opposite finding was reported that both singly-dispersed Pd and Au species are inferior to their nanostructured counterparts. For instance, a high TON of 9278 (within 7 h) was reached over Au nanoclusters (1 nm) dispersed on SiO2-Schiff, whereas no product was formed over SiO2-Schiff-supported single Au atoms, as shown in Table 4.119 This is probably related to the size-dependent electronic properties of Au. To be specific, the electron-donation function of Schiff base favors the formation of electron-rich Au species at the nanoscale, thus facilitating the dissociation of H2 to form highly-reactive hydride species. By contrast, single Au atoms are speculated to exist in positively-charged states, which is unfavorable for the generation of hydride species. As stressed above, the intrinsic capability of active metal sites to form high-reactivity hydride species, the so-called hydricity,184 was identified as a crucial indicator of catalyst performance. Over the electron-rich Au nanoclusters, hydride species are facilely formed and characterized by being more hydridic, thus leading to high catalytic performance. In the case of Pd/BCN, Pd nanoparticles (1.9 nm) afforded two-fold higher activity than the singly-dispersed Pd atoms (Table 4).78 The reduced activity when downsizing to the single atom scale was attributed to the formation of less interfacial sites between single Pd atoms and edge defects (CO2 activation sties). Nevertheless, Zhang et al. recently reported that the Pd/ZrO2 SAC were inferior to the nano-sized Pd/ZrO2 featuring only metallic Pd species.93 The positively charged nature of single Pd atoms on ZrO2, as indicated by CO-DRIFTS, was believed to account for the low activity of Pd SAC. Further investigations are necessary to unravel the key factor relevant for the size-dependent activity of Pd.

Another advantage of SACs lies in the excellent selectivity towards formate, which was discovered for Ru@pDPPE SAC.161 Interestingly, no CO (side product) was formed on Ru@pDPPE containing only singly-dispersed Ru species, whereas an appreciable concentration of CO (267 ppm) was detected on nanostructured Ru/AC. The formation of CO probably originates from the further dehydration of accumulated formate. It was found that Ru/AC could promote the dehydration of formate to form CO and H2O, while the dehydration reaction was significantly suppressed over Ru@pDPPE SAC.196 This is probably related to the distinct geometric and electronic properties of single Ru atoms, thus disfavoring the adsorption of the intermediates for formate dehydration. Yet, the structure–activity relationship behind the inhibited formation of CO on Ru SACs remains to be clarified.
Benefiting from metal–support interactions, nanostructured catalysts containing Pd and Ru nanoparticles are superior to their single-atom counterparts in terms of stability. It has been demonstrated that a range of Pd- and Ru-based nanocatalysts such as Pd/r-GO,90 Pd/AC,75 Pd/g-C3N4,80 Pd/ZnO,94 PdAg–PEI@HMOS,124 PdMn0.6@S-1,130 Ru/HT,103 and Ru/TiO2197 can be isolated and recycled for a couple of times in a batch reactor with nearly unchanged TONs/TOFs. In contrast, fast deactivation is frequently encountered for the reported Ru and Ir SACs immobilized onto bpy-CTF,147,148 as well as Pd SACs stabilized in bpy-containing MOF.176 Such poor stability is primarily caused by the labile connection of metal center with the N-containing solid ligands. Under H2 atmosphere, the formed proton can promote the cleavage of metal–N coordination bonds, thus leading to the leaching and aggregation of metal species. Likewise, single Ru atoms evolution to nanoparticles during recycling tests was observed for Ru@pDPPE featuring Ru–P coordination bonds.161 Yet, the dissociation mechanism of Ru–P bonds remains unclear. Effective solutions have been proposed to address the deactivation issue of SACs. For example, the recyclability of Ru and Ir SACs on bpy-CTF can be enhanced by selecting appropriate Ru/Ir precursors containing acac or chloride ligands instead of Cp* and C6Me6 ligands.148 Besides, the employment of polymerized multidentate ligands, such as AP-POP involving triple chelating sites enabling robust coordination into metal center, can endow Ir@AP-POP SAC with superior stability.159
7. Conclusion and outlook
High-performance heterogeneous catalysts are key to the catalytic valorization of CO2 towards the efficient synthesis of valuable formate/formic acid, which can serve as both chemicals and fuels. Driven by the advancements in the field of nanocatalysis and single-atom catalysis, the past few years have witnessed strongly growing efforts devoted to heterogeneous reduction of CO2 to formate/formic acid. In this context, we summarized recent developments on designing heterogeneous catalysts ranging from nanoscale to atomic scale in this review. Typically, nanostructured metal catalysts involve noble metals such as Pd, Ru and Au as H2 activation sites along with basic supporting materials offering CO2 adsorption/activation sites. The interface between metal and basic sites was proposed as the true catalytically active centers, wherein activated H2 and CO2 combine to ultimately generate formate/formic acid. Tailoring the basic properties of supports to realize high dispersion of metal species along with maximal interfacial sites has been the main subject of research today on nanocatalysts. Among others, Pd catalysts show superior activity, specifically towards the reduction of bicarbonate to formate even at room temperature without gaseous CO2. Excellent performances with TONs up to tens of thousands can be obtained on Au and Ru nanocatalysts for the reaction implemented with gaseous CO2 and NEt3.
While a rich body of SACs have been reported for various CO2-related catalytic transformations, the design of SACs with tailored active sites for CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid is still in its primary stage. Inspired by the high efficiency of homogeneous metal complexes, SACs are often designed by the immobilization and heterogenization of molecular Ir and Ru complexes onto polymeric analogues of organic ligands as well as MOFs. Electron-donating functional groups comprising N, O, and P moieties have been intensively used as building units to construct solid ligands aimed at enhanced electron density at metal centers. The immobilized electron-rich single metal sites usually deliver high TONs/TOFs, but most of them suffer from unsatisfactory recyclability. A potential approach to fabricate stable SACs is the structural engineering of POPs and MOFs, whereby a large amount of organic groups with diverse functionalities can be incorporated. Accordingly, the resultant POPs and MOFs are endowed with various stabilizing effects such as covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions. By such multiple interactions, single metal atoms are expected to be firmly captured. On the other hand, currently reported SACs are mainly limited to N-coordinated metal complexes. Only few studies are focused on the immobilization of P-coordinated metal complexes. Nevertheless, P-containing molecular catalysts, e.g., PNP pincer complexes possessing state-of-the-art performances among homogeneous catalysts, are far more active than N-coordinated SACs. Therefore, the design of novel PNP-ligand-based polymers as superior SACs represents a promising direction to be explored. Given the extremely reactive/sensitive nature of PNP ligands, conceiving an applicable synthetic protocol to realize the polymeric network of PNP is of vital importance.
We also stressed the fundamental insights associated with these nanostructured and SACs, which can provide useful guidance for rational catalyst design. Based on the available structure–activity relationships as well as mechanistic understandings, following points are suggested for successful design and construction of heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid: (1) tailoring support materials with appropriate basic properties to promote CO2 enrichment/activation and enhance the electron density at metal center; (2) downsizing the metal nanoparticles with more active atoms exposed to substrates; (3) ensuring close proximity between metal and basic sites for an efficient synergic catalysis; (4) well-connected porous structures with big pore sizes for better accessibility of metal and basic sites, considering that CO2 could be transported to active sites in the form of bulky CO2–amine adduct; and (5) appropriate reduction pretreatment to activate immobilized SACs. It is worthwhile to notice that a highly efficient catalytic process is not only related to the proper catalyst design, but it is also determined by the applied reaction parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, stirring speed, and reactor type) and mass transfer across gas–liquid and liquid–solid interphases, which need to be verified and well optimized for a given catalytic system.
Despite the significant achievements in formulating and structuring heterogeneous catalysts, further research efforts are required to address the following issues associated with fundamental research and future applications. First, most research overlooked the possible formation of side products like CO, CH4, methanol, which always need to be strictly controlled when applying heterogeneous CO2 hydrogenation systems for H2 fuel purpose. Especially for CO, it could poison the active center even at the low ppm level. Thus, a highly selective catalyst with the exclusive production of formate/formic acid is required in terms of practical viability. SACs hold great promise to meet such selectivity requirement. Especially for SACs utilizing POPs and MOFs as scaffolds, their unique molecular designability can enable high homogeneity and uniformity of the active centers in terms of both coordination environments and electronic properties. Ideally, only target reactions can happen over such specifically designed one-type active sites, thus suppressing side reactions like CO formation. Towards this goal, advanced synthetic methods which can realize the precise construction of single-atom active sites by atomically manipulating each building unit are highly desired. Second, the synergetic catalysis of basic sites and metal sites on catalysts as well as the transformations of CO2 in amine-containing reaction system need to be understood in detail in order to further optimize catalytic performance. The available mechanistic results are usually obtained by in situ FTIR or DRIFT in gas phase without considering solvent environment. Such measurements may be different from the realistic catalytic cycles, in which solvent is involved. In this regard, in situ liquid-phase techniques such as in situ ATR-IR with solvent under pressure and temperature would be a powerful tool for studying reaction mechanism realistically. Third, as stated above, size-dependent performances were observed for many SACs and nanocatalysts. However, there is a lack of fundamental insights into the general structure–property–activity relationships on different types of metal species with their sizes ranging from nanoscale to single atom. A deep understanding of such structure–property–activity relationships will drive the catalyst development transition from empirical approaches by enormous trial-and-error tests to really knowledge-guided rational design. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct unambiguous structural and electronic determinations of catalytically active centers by in situ/operando characterizations along with accurate theoretical calculations. Fourth, noble metals are currently intensively used as active components for both SACs and nanostructured catalysts. Developing cost-effective non-noble metal catalysts with comparable catalytic performance are highly desirable in terms of economic viability. However, the inherently weak H2 adsorption/activation abilities of non-noble metals pose a major challenge for efficient CO2 reduction. More research efforts should be directed to understanding the factors that affect H2 adsorption/activation on non-noble metal sites, and developing effective synthetic methods applicable to tuning the microenvironments of the non-noble metal sites for enhanced H2 dissociation abilities. Also the complexity and cost of the catalyst itself, to ultimately foresee large scale workable material, is a concern. In this regard, SACs appear more promising than nanoparticles, as the inherent high metal utilization efficiency would further reduce the catalyst cost. Last but not least, an efficient and also durable heterogeneous catalyst is urgently needed from the viewpoint of practical implementation. Therefore, it is essential to understand and resolve the fast activation of highly-active metal components with ultra-small size during the recyclability test, which is particularly pronounced for Au nanoclusters and immobilized molecular catalysts. Of great relevance is the real-time monitoring of the dynamic evolutions of molecular catalysts under reaction conditions, which can provide valuable information regarding the reaction progress and deactivation mechanism. With continuously increasing interests from academia and industry, we are convinced that adequate solutions will be finally worked out for these problems by the interdisciplinary collaborations across catalysis, material synthesis, computational modeling, and advanced characterization.

Broader context
Devising new technologies to drive the evolution from current CO2-emission-intensive energy modes to renewable energy landscapes featuring a circular carbon economy is the major challenge facing the sustainable development of human society. Under this background, the utilization of captured CO2 as a renewable carbon feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals and fuels is receiving considerable attention. Formic acid, which can be readily synthesized from CO2 and H2, offers a potential solution to address this energy transition challenge due to its role as a carbon-neutral energy carrier to store renewable energy in the form of H2. Central to the CO2-involved H2 storage system lies in the development of efficient and durable heterogeneous catalysts. Accordingly, the catalytic conversion of CO2 to formic acid has been intensively explored in the realm of heterogeneous catalysis. In particular, benefiting from the new frontier of single atom catalysis, the scope of heterogeneous catalyst candidates has been further broadened in recent years. This review presents a critical overview of the design of heterogeneous metal catalysts for CO2 reduction to formic acid/formate from traditional nanoscale to novel single atom scale. Diverse single-atom engineering and nanostructuring strategies have been exploited to unlock high-performance catalysts by regulating the size, electronic properties, and coordination environments of active metal species. We also point out the remaining challenges in the purist of practically viable CO2-based H2 storage process, that is, deepening the knowledge of structure–property–activity relationships to enable the precise construction of active sites with superior activity and stability.
