    , Accepted 13th June 2018First published on 14th June 2018AbstractThe p-type semiconducting organic layer used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the hole extraction and transport is a key component of the device to achieve high performance. Organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) can be essentially divided into two subclasses depending on their molecular weight: molecular and polymeric. In the present paper, we fully characterize and compare the electrical response of PSCs prepared with the benchmark molecular Spiro-OMeTAD HTM and the conducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) selected as a low-cost and efficient polymer HTM. For both compounds, cells have been prepared without and with doping. Doping the molecular HTM with bis(trifluoromethane)sulfoimide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) gives rise to a dramatic power conversion efficiency increase from 5.1% to 17.7%. Impedance spectroscopy investigation of the cells shows that the performance of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells is limited by the HTM layer resistance and by the strong charge recombination occurring at the HTM/perovskite interface. In the case of P3HT-based devices, the cell performance is increased by doping to a much less extent. Using LiTFSI and tBP additives leads to the best performance. In impedance spectra, they eliminate the intermediate frequency inductive loop. The additives limit the charge recombination at the interface, reduce the interfacial defects and favor the hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer. Importantly, we show that the P3HT conductivity is not the main limiting parameter of the cell efficiency because of the intrinsic conducting properties of the thiophene chain and that increasing the interchain order does not produce a significant enhancement of the PSC efficiency.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organolead perovskite (HPs) semiconductors have been known since the end of the 70s1,2 but have been rediscovered recently for their remarkable optical–electronic–chemical properties and their facile synthesis and processing from solutions at low temperature.3 This material family has revolutionized the field of photovoltaic solar cells.4–17 During the last few years, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has raised rapidly and reached a current certified world record of 22.7%.18 The general PSC architecture consists in placing the HP absorber layer between two selective contacts. On one side, the perovskite is contacted by a wide bandgap semiconductor, usually an n-type oxide such as anatase TiO2. The roles of this layer are to block the transfer of holes and to ensure the electron transport.16 On the other side, a layer commonly made of an organic p-type semiconductor aims at blocking the electrons and transporting the holes from the perovskite absorber to the back contact. The hole transporting material (HTM) is a key component of the device to achieve high efficiency. It must accept the holes photogenerated in the perovskite and present a good hole mobility. The other properties sought out excellent thermal, morphological and photochemical stabilities, and good hydrophobic properties to protect the perovskite materials from moisture.
Organic HTMs can be essentially divided into two subclasses depending on their molecular weight: molecular and polymeric HTMs. The latter have important advantages in terms of processability, thermal and mechanical stability, and higher intrinsic hole mobility. On the other hand, molecular HTMs are beneficial in terms of synthetic reproducibility, and well-defined molecular weight and structure. The most popular and efficient molecular HTM employed in the literature is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-ethoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) (Fig. 1a). Spiro-OMeTAD is employed routinely with two additives bis(trifluoromethane)sulfoimide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) (Schematic S1, ESI†). While LiTFSI favors the oxidation and then the p-doping of Spiro-OMeTAD,19tBP molecules have been shown to prevent LiTFSI aggregation and to improve its distribution and to provide a better interface between the HTM layer and the perovskite layer.20

The two main polymer HTMs for PSCs are poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) (Fig. 1a).14,21–28 Both have conjugated chains and exhibit a rather high stability.29 P3HT is a thiophene based polymer with attached –(CH2)5CH3 side chains (Fig. 1a). PTAA presents the same triphenylamine groups as Spiro-OMeTAD and is also the only polymeric semiconductor giving high efficiency PSCs (above 22% (ref. 14)). However, the very high cost of this compound renders its use not competitive for a large-scale application.29 On the other hand, P3HT is much cheaper to produce than PTAA and Spiro-OMeTAD (Table 1ref. 21). As regards its facile processing method and desirable hole conductivity, P3HT is regarded as a good HTM candidate for PSCs. This compound is promising for robust, temperature resistant devices. For instance, recently, Zheng et al.22 showed the better stability at high temperature (up to 85 °C) of additive-free P3HT-cells compared to the Spiro-OMeTAD ones. The efficiency of P3HT-based PSCs remains lower than that of PTAA but promising. Jung et al.23 reported a PCE of above 16% by cobalt doping of P3HT, while Nia et al.24 found that using a rather thick mesoporous TiO2 layer combined with large P3HT polymers of 124 kDa can give rise to a maximum PCE of 16.2%. Molecular p-type doping by using F4TCNQ, which acts as an electron acceptor, has been reported to increase the P3HT conductivity from 1.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 5.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 and then the cell performance.25 Cobalt has also been reported for the p-doping of P3HT.23 However, the most popular P3HT dopants/additives are LiTFSI and tBP (Schematic S1, ESI†). LiTFSI increases the carrier density26,27 and slightly decreases the P3HT HOMO level.27tBP increases the mobility of the charge carriers and has no effect on the polymer HOMO level.27 The P3HT conductivity was measured by Heo et al.26 to change from 5.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 without additive to 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 with LiTFSI and tBP additives. Another strategy adopted by Park et al.28 to enhance the layer compactness and conductivity was to prepare P3HT nanofibrils obtained via the π-conjugation of the thiophene rings. Jimenez-Lopez et al.30 found that, in spite of the comparable HOMO level of Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT HTMs, the Voc difference is about 200 mV. Photo-physical measurements comparing doped Spiro-OMeTAD and undoped P3HT have suggested that the Voc limitation for the latter is due to trap mediated recombinations and less efficient hole transfer.30

The present paper aims to compare and understand the effect of the HTM type (molecular versus polymer) on the PSC functioning. In both cases, the role of doping has been investigated. For the sake of comparison, the molecular HTM is the benchmark Spiro-OMeTAD which raises high efficiency, whereas P3HT has been selected as a promising low-cost polymer HTM. For the electrical characterizations, the J–V curves have been completed by a comprehensive impedance spectroscopy (IS) study of the cells. IS is a non-destructive electrical characterization method that can be implemented coupled with device illumination in order to fully characterize the solar cells under working conditions.16,17,31 By investigating frequencies ranging over several decades, the decoupling of the different physical processes occurring with different characteristic times (frequencies) has been performed.
2. Experimental
The F-doped tin oxide coated glass (TEC7, Pilkington) was cut, and etched patterned using HCl 10% and Zn powder. It was then cleaned by using a concentrated 2.5 mol L−1 NaOH ethanolic solution, rinsed with water, cleaned with a detergent, rinsed with MilliQ water and dried with compressed air. The substrates were then annealed for 30 min at 500 °C. The TiO2 blocking layer was prepared using an aerosol spray pyrolysis technique as described in ref. 16. A precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.6 mL of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and 0.4 mL of acetyl acetone in 7 mL of isopropanol. The substrate was placed on a hotplate at 455 °C for 15 min prior to starting the spraying. The deposited layer was then annealed at 455 °C for 40 min before to be let to cool down. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was prepared by diluting the NR30-D paste from Dyesol with ethanol (1:8 mass ratio). 40 μL of the solution was deposited on the blocking layer and spin-coated for 20 s at 5000 rpm. The layer was then dried on a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under air flux.
The CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) precursor solution was prepared by mixing 553 mg of PbI2 and 190 mg of methylammonium iodide (Dyesol) in 1 mL of DMSO solvent. The solution was heated at 70 °C until full dissolution. 45 μL of this solution was deposited on the substrate, and spun at 6000 rpm for 35 s. The layer was dripped with 100 μL chlorobenzene after 25 s. The perovskite layer was finally annealed at 105 °C for 1 h on a hotplate.
For the doped Spiro-OMeTAD cells, a solution was prepared by dissolving 72 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Then, 17.5 μL of LiTFSI solution (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile (ACN)), 28 μL of tBP (4-tert-butylpyridine, 96% Sigma-Aldrich) and 6 μL of tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tri[bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] (FK209 from Dyesol) (300 mg in 1 mL ACN) were added to this solution. The solution of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD (cells denoted as Spiro-Un) was the same without the chemical additives. 35 μL of these HTM solutions were spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 20 s. The P3HT solution was prepared by dissolving 15 mg of high molecular weight (MW) P3HT (Merck SP001 lisicon®) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The cells prepared with P3HT without additive are denoted as P3HT-Un. For the P3HT–Li cells, 7.5 μL of a LiTFSI solution (170 mg in 1 mL ACN) and 7.5 μL of tBP solution (1 mL in 1 mL ACN) were added to the P3HT solution. In the case of P3HT–Co cells, 18 μL of ACN, 6 μL of FK209 Co solution (10.5 mg in 5 mL ACN) and 6 μL of tBP were added. The P3HT precursor solutions were stirred at 55 °C for 1 h in a glovebox to ensure full solubilization before use. The solutions were spin-coated at room temperature on top of the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 20 s (4000 rpm s−1 acceleration). 35 μL of the HTM solution was dropped once the 4000 rpm speed was reached (see Section A, ESI,† for more details). Finally, the device was completed by thermally evaporating a 70–80 nm thick gold back contact on the Spiro-OMeTAD layer. The solar cell surface area delimited by the back contact was about 0.24 cm2. A schematic of the solar cell configuration is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
The J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley 2410 digital sourcemeter, using a 0.625 V s−1 voltage scan rate. The solar cells were illuminated with a solar simulator (Abet Technology Sun 2000) filtered to mimic AM 1.5G conditions.32 The illuminated surface was delimited using a black mask with an aperture diameter of 3 mm. The power density was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by the use of a reference silicon solar cell.33 The impedance spectra were measured at room temperature, between 600 kHz and 20 mHz, using a PGSTAT 20 apparatus from Autolab. All the measured cells had the same contact geometries. The AC signal was 20 mV. All the impedance spectra were measured at room temperature, over a large applied voltage range under ∼1 sun light illumination provided by a halogen Schott lamp. These spectra were analyzed using Z-view software from National Instrument.
3. Results and discussion
In the present work, P3HT has been chosen as a model of conjugated polymer HTM for PSC application and is compared to the benchmark Spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Absorbance spectra before and after normalization of doped and undoped P3HT layers on glass are shown in Fig. S1a† and Fig. 1b, respectively. High-MW P3HT is a purple-colored semiconductor compound (Fig. S1a, ESI†) and has a bandgap of 1.9–2.0 eV. The layers are characterized by a broad absorption peak between 400 and 650 nm which is related to π–π* absorption transitions at 525 nm, 560 nm and 605 nm. The absorbance peak at 525 nm provides information on the degree of conjugation in the P3HT chains.34 The maximum absorbance value remains about the same after doping (Fig. S1, ESI†). On the other hand, the band at 605 nm is related to the interchain order.34 The spectra show that the presence of LiTFSI and, more importantly, the cobalt salt increases this parameter (Fig. 1b). However, the cell performances reported below show that this parameter is not key to improve the PSC efficiency. The Spiro-OMeTAD spectra are presented in Fig. S1b (ESI†). They are characterized by an absorption band at 340–430 nm. In this case, no significant change could be observed with doping. Spiro-OMeTAD is a wide bandgap (about 3.0 eV) molecular semi-conductor, transparent over most of the visible wavelength region.
Cells have been prepared using these HTMs and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) as the perovskite absorber material. The prepared MAPI layer was well-crystallized as confirmed by XRD measurements. In Fig. 1c, the pattern is indexed to the tetragonal MAPI structure. An additional small peak at 12.7° shows the presence of a small amount of unreacted PbI2. Fig. 1d shows that the one-step MAPI layer absorbs light in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range. The SEM view (Fig. 1e) confirms that the perovskite layer was well crystallized and formed of large grains with a size in the 300–500 nm range. The layer was uniform in morphology and was well-capping the mesoporous TiO2 layer.
The PSC structure is schematized in Fig. 2a. The effects of the HTM material and doping on the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2b. The average and best photovoltaic parameters of P3HT and Spiro-OMeTAD-based solar cells with various dopings are gathered in Table 1. Doping has an important effect on the Spiro-OMeTAD cells. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) for Spiro-doped cells is 17.7%. These cells present high Jsc and FF. Without doping, the performances drop dramatically with a maximum PCE measured at 5.1%. Spiro-Un devices suffer from a low FF that can be attributed to the low HTM conductivity and therefore high charge transport resistances. The Jsc and Voc parameters are also reduced. On the other hand, the effect of doping is not so dramatic in the case of the polymer-based cells. The best additives for the performances are LiTFSI and tBP. P3HT–Li cells could achieve a PCE of 13.4% which is one of the highest PCE reported for P3HT-HTM based PSCs. P3HT–Li cells exhibit an improved fill factor parameter (FF) and, to a lower extent, better Jsc and Voc compared to P3HT-Un. However, LiTFSI and tBP additives are detrimental for the J–V curve hysteresis. Table 1 shows that doping with Co-salt and tBP (P3HT–Co cells) results in an intermediate behavior (slight increase in efficiency and hysteresis compared to P3HT-Un). All the P3HT cells showed a lower Voc than the Spiro-doped ones in agreement with Jiménez-López et al.'s findings.30

To gain deeper insights into the effects of the HTM material type and doping on the cell functioning, the various devices have been fully investigated by IS. The solar cell electrical response to a small ac perturbation applied to the devices polarized at various potentials has been investigated. IS techniques have been extensively used to investigate photovoltaic solar cells, especially dye-sensitized solar cells.35–37 It is now emerging as a powerful technique for the investigation of PSCs.10,11,16,17,32,38–46 IS is a non-destructive electrical characterization method by which the phenomena of transfer and accumulation of charges (ions, electrons/holes) can be thoroughly investigated. The cells were analyzed under light illumination and over a wide frequency range. Fig. 3 shows Nyquist plots of spectra recorded in the 600 kHz to 20 mHz range for doped and undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells (a–d) and P3HT-based cells (e–h). Their Bode plots are displayed in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†), respectively. Four different features can be distinguished denoted as 1 to 4. 1, 2 and 4 are the arcs of circles observed at very high, high and low frequencies, respectively. 1 is only observed in the case of the undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells. 3 is an inductive loop observed at intermediate frequency for P3HT-Un and P3HT–Co. The general equivalent electrical circuit used to fit the spectra is shown in Fig. 4. The simplified EECs which have been used to analyze each kind of cell are presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Because the arcs of circle are not semi-circles, they have been fitted using R‖CPE circuits. The CPE impedance is defined by, , where ω is the angular frequency related to the frequency as , i is the square root of −1 and p is a number lower than 1. The equivalent capacitances have been then calculated from these CPE parameters as described in our previous studies.16,17

The very high frequency relaxation loop denoted as 1 is only observed for Spiro-Un cells. It is assigned to the relaxation of the Spiro-OMeTAD layer. The values of C1 and R1 are reported in Fig. S5a (ESI†) as a function of Vappl. These parameters are unchanged with Vappl up to 0.7 V and their average values are 1.4 10−8 F cm−2 and 48 Ω cm2, respectively. From R1 and d, the Spiro-OMeTAD layer thickness (measured at about 150 nm (see Fig. S5b, ESI†)), the conductivity, σSpiro, is calculated according to σSpiro = d/R1. It is determined to be 3 × 10−7 S cm−1. From C1 and d, εr the relative permittivity is given by C1 = εrε0/d, with ε0 the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), and calculated to be 2.4 for undoped Spiro-OMeTAD. The low conductivity of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD explains that the HTM relaxation loop can be observed in the IS spectra. The conductivity of the other HTMs is higher by several orders of magnitude (for instance the conductivity of doped Spiro-OMeTAD can reach values higher than 10−3 S cm−1 (ref. 47)) and the relaxation frequency of this layer is shifted toward higher frequencies. The very high frequency loop 1 is not observed then and the resistive contribution of the HTM layer is small and included in Rs. Rs is the high frequency resistance measured by extrapolating the 1 or 2 high frequency loop to the x-axis. It is mainly due to the electrical contribution of the gold and FTO contact electrodes and to external wires. Undoped P3HT has a rather high conductivity due to charge transport through the long chain of the conjugated polymer. Rs results shown in Fig. 5 suggest a better conductivity through LiTFSI doping whereas the series resistance is not significantly affected by the Co complex-doping.

The high frequency relaxation 2 has been analyzed by extracting C2 and R2. C2 is insensitive to light and is related to the intrinsic dielectric relaxation of MAPI.17 In Fig. 6a, C2 is similar for the various cells since the same MAPI is used in the investigated PSCs. The fact that the C2 curves of P3HT-Un and P3HT–Co cells depart from the general trend can be assigned to the difficulty in accurately determining C2 when the inductive loop is present. R2 is influenced by doping. It decreases with the applied voltage for the undoped HTM (or P3HT–Co) while it decreases slowly or remains unchanged over a large Vappl range for Spiro-doped and P3HT–Li cells, respectively (Fig. 6b). Juarez-Perez et al. assigned R2 to a charge transfer resistance.39 Pockett et al.46 found a scaling of this parameter with light intensity at the Voc and assigned it to a recombination resistance. R2 is also influenced by the transport resistance of electrons along the selective contact.16 Therefore, R2 is a complex element that gathers several contributions. Nevertheless, in the present case, the facts that R2 is not affected by the HTM layer resistance and that it changes with the HTM (all other parameters being kept identical) show that this parameter is strongly affected by the interface between the HTM and the perovskite.
 Fig. 6  Effects of the HTM and doping on the variation of C2 (a) and R2 (b) parameters with Vappl. 
The low frequency loop was analyzed as an R4‖CPE4 circuit. R4 is related to the recombination phenomena at the interfaces and the higher the R4, the lower the recombination. Fig. 7a shows the effects of the HTM and doping on this resistance. Higher R4 values are measured for LiTFSI and tBP doped Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT cells compared to the undoped ones. For undoped Spiro-OMeTAD, R4 is low and, importantly, continuously decreases with Vappl. This is in agreement with the low FF of these cells (Table 1). On the other hand, to get a high FF, a flat curve up to high voltage before a steep decrease near the Voc is required and is the signature of a high FF as found for Spiro-doped cells. R4 is also in good agreement with the lower Voc of the undoped Spiro cells. LiTFSI in the Spiro cells improves the conductivity by promoting the molecular HTM oxidation by O2 while tBP favors the uniformity of the HTM layer and avoids the accumulation of Li salt at the interface.20,48–50 Interface improvement is important to lower the recombination and to enlarge the cell Voc and FF. The P3HT–Li curve crosses the Spiro-doped curve and decreases more rapidly at high Vappl in agreement with the lower Voc of the former cells. P3HT-Un and P3HT–Co have an intermediate behavior. Lower R4 is in agreement with the lower Voc of these cells and the lower slope of P3HT–Li compared to the other P3HT cells is in agreement with the higher FF of P3HT–Li devices. We importantly note that LiTFSI in P3HT–Li mainly acts as a recombination reducer. We suggest that this compound interacts with Pb2+ by means of the F atoms and that this interaction reduces the interface defects. It is interesting to compare the R2 and R4 curves. While their shapes are close, the values of these components have an opposite behavior: the higher the R2, the lower the R4. These observations show that R2 cannot be considered as a pure recombination resistance.

C4, the low frequency capacitance, is strongly affected by the light shining. We have shown recently that C4 is related to the hysteresis of the J–V curves.17 It is generally admitted that hysteresis is related to the accumulation of mobile ions (and ion vacancies) at the interface near the contacts due to ion migration under an electric field. It alters the band structure at the interface and modulates the barrier heights for electron/hole collection. This effect is detected at low frequencies due to the slow movement of ions and charge compensation. It is strongly affected by the interfaces between the selective contacts and the perovskite layer.51 C4 is plotted as a function of Vappl for various HTMs in Fig. 7b and S6a (ESI†). They show a contribution of the HTM/perovskite interface to this parameter since, for instance, the curves are different for the pristine P3HT cell and the doped ones (Fig. 7b). This capacitance induces the hysteresis found between the forward and the reverse J–V scans (Table 1) and is correlated with the hysteresis index, HI, defined as: (1)with (PCE)REV, (PCE)FOR and (PCE)AVG being the power conversion efficiencies determined on the reverse scan, forward scan and by averaging both, respectively. In Fig. 7b, the P3HT-Un curve (HI = 26.5%) is below the P3HT–Co curve (HI = 27.2%). C4 is 4–5 times higher for P3HT–Li, and this cell has a very large HI of 65.3%. The present observations confirm our previous analysis of C4 for PSCs prepared with various perovskite absorbers.17 The C4 curves of the spiro-OMeTAD cells are shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The Spiro-Un curve has an S-shape and increases more rapidly than the Spiro-doped curve. It can be deduced that additives improve the interface between the molecular HTM and MAPI. The improvement could be notably a consequence of tBP. It has been shown for instance that this compound, when present at the perovskite surface, increases the hydrophobicity of the perovskite layer by its attachment to the perovskite Pb2+ by its nitrogen atom, and the tertiary butyl group surrounding at the outside.49 We can suppose then that this additive is attached at the perovskite surface, reduces the interfacial defects and favors the hole transfer from the perovskite to the molecular HTM layer, while this effect is much less pronounced in the case of P3HT.20,49,51
The intermediate frequency range is characterized by the presence of an inductive loop for the P3HT-Un and P3HT–Co cells. This loop is found for the polymer HTM cells with lower performance and, interestingly, it disappears when LiTFSI is added to P3HT. The loop is not observed for the doped and undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells. L2 inductance versus applied potential curves attained from the fitting of the impedance spectra of the different samples under illumination are plotted in Fig. S6b (ESI†). Higher L2 values are found for P3HT-Un compared to P3HT–Co. Anaya et al.52 found an increase of L with the increase of the TiO2/perovskite interface and deduced a correlation between the inductance and the electron injection processes. Our results show that the inductance can be induced by phenomena occurring at the perovskite/HTM interface. However, in PSCs, the charge injection toward both selective contacts is very fast (on the nanosecond scale) whereas the relaxation frequency (and then characteristic time) of the inductive loop is only 100–200 Hz. If an inductive element in impedance spectra can be related to complex multistep processes,53,54 further studies are still needed to clarify the origin of this feature often encountered in the IS spectra of PSCs.16,54
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have fully characterized and compared the electrical J–V and impedance responses of PSCs prepared with the benchmark molecular Spiro-OMeTAD HTM and the P3HT conducting polymer selected as a low-cost efficient HTM. Impedance spectroscopy measurements have been performed over large frequency and applied potential ranges. For both compounds, cells have been prepared without and with doping. Doping the molecular HTM with LiTFSI and tBP dramatically increases the power conversion efficiency from 5.1% to 17.7%. We have shown that the performances of undoped Spiro-OMeTAD cells are limited by the HTM layer resistance and we have determined the conductivity of the layer to be 3 × 10−7 S cm−1 and its relative permittivity to be 2.4. Moreover, the analysis of the R4 parameter has evidenced that the performance of Spiro-Un cells is limited by strong recombinations occurring at the HTM/perovskite interface. On the other hand, the performance of the P3HT-based cell was increased to a lower extent by doping. Using LiTFSI and tBP additives leads to the best performance. We have shown that LiTFSI eliminates the intermediate frequency inductive loop which is beneficial since the inductor acts as a short circuit at low frequency which reduces the cell impedance. The additives limit the charge recombination at the interface, reduce the interfacial defects and favor the hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM layer. Importantly, we have shown that P3HT conductivity is not the main limiting parameter of the cell performance because the thiophene chain presents correct conducting properties even without doping. We have also found that increasing the interchain order does not produce a significant enhancement of the PSC efficiency. In many papers, the authors analyze the beneficial effect of doping the conjugated polymer HTM, especially P3HT, as due to an increase of the conductivity.24,26 The present work shows that the limitation due to the conductivity of the undoped polymer is negligible (a slight increase of the series resistance), but that additives affect the perovskite/HTM interface, reduce the recombination, render the recombination resistance poorly dependent on the applied voltage and then improve the fill factor parameter. Finally the present work has confirmed the correlation between the capacitance determined at low impedance frequency and the J–V curve hysteresis feature, typical of PSCs. The present paper shows that IS is a powerful tool to analyze the effect of the HTM, especially the polymer HTM, on the cell functioning and is a technique of great interest to optimize this key component of PSCs.
