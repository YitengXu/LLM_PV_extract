1 Introduction
The development of clean and renewable energy has been one of the most important global issues since the latter part of the last century. The use of solar energy is the most probable means for a solution. Specifically, water splitting using solar energy releases hydrogen as a possible source of chemicals or fuels.1,2 The growing world energy demand has increased the demand for such alternatives to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, at present, none of the sunlight-originated renewable energy sources can alter the existing energy supply systems or significantly reduce fossil fuel consumption. Water is a very stable molecule, and its dissociation is quite difficult. Therefore, the requirements for any water splitting devices inevitably become severe, and there remain many challenges to overcome. However, recent efforts made by researchers in relevant fields have accelerated the progress in this area. In the present paper, photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting based on inorganic semiconductors is introduced. Here, we focus on recent advances in non-oxide type semiconductors developed mainly by our group.
2 Theories of photocatalytic/electrochemical water splitting
2.1 Basics of water splitting
Overall water splitting into H2 and O2 as shown in eqn (1) is an uphill chemical reaction with increasing Gibbs free energy. 2H2O = 2H2 + O2(1)
Therefore, this reaction does not proceed without an external energy source. Externally injecting light energy into this reaction via a photocatalyst can dissociate water.
Inorganic semiconductors are predominantly utilized for water splitting over organic/organometallic dye molecules because of their superior photochemical stability. Fig. 1 depicts the basic model of water splitting on a semiconductor photocatalyst. When a semiconductor absorbs photons with energies greater than its bandgap, electrons are excited from the occupied valence band to the unoccupied conduction band, generating excited electrons and holes as the first step. Next, the generated electron–hole pairs diffuse to the surface of the photocatalyst particles and give rise to the following reduction–oxidation reactions:
H2 evolution reaction by H+ reduction (HER): 2H+ + 2e− = H2(2)
O2 evolution reaction by H2O oxidation (OER): 2H2O + 4h+ = O2 + 4H+(3)
 Fig. 1  Basic model of photocatalytic water splitting via one-step photoexcitation. 
To promote these two redox reactions, as a thermodynamic prerequisite, the conduction band minimum (CBM) of a semiconductor should be located at a more negative potential than the H+/H2 level (0–0.059 × pH V versus NHE) while the valence band maximum (VBM) should be more positive than the O2/H2O level (1.23–0.059 × pH V versus NHE). Assuming a one-step photoexcitation route using a single semiconductor photocatalyst, the minimum photon energy to perform overall water splitting is 1.23 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of ca. 1000 nm. However, in practice, a somewhat larger bandgap energy than this is needed to split water due to the presence of an overpotential.
The photon energy needed to split water can be reduced by increasing the number of photoexcitation steps. Typically, water splitting via two-step photoexcitation using two types of semiconductors, termed the “Z-scheme”, has been a common approach for utilizing narrow-gap photocatalysts.3–5 As depicted in Fig. 2, in Z-scheme water splitting, photogenerated electrons in one photocatalyst reduce H+ to H2, while holes in the other photocatalyst oxidize H2O to O2. Here, photoexcited electrons and holes separately remain in their respective photocatalysts. Their recombination via an electron redox mediator completes the photocatalytic process. This approach mimics the model of the light-reaction in natural photosynthesis.
 Fig. 2  Basic model of Z-scheme water splitting via two-step photoexcitation. 
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) method2,6–9 and particulate photocatalysts7,10 are the two major distinct approaches to water photolysis. In the case of PEC systems, internal electric fields at space charge layers (solution/semiconductor interfaces) promote the directional separation of photogenerated electrons and holes to reach the opposite interfaces. One of the electrons or holes reacts with water on the semiconductor surface while the other migrates to the counter electrode through an outer circuit. In cases where holes oxidize water or electrons reduce H+ on a semiconductor surface, the electrode is regarded as a photoanode or a photocathode, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). When the voltage to split water provided by a single semiconductor photoelectrode is insufficient, a tandem connection of photoanodes and photocathodes can be used perform overall water splitting (Fig. 3c), which is analogous to Z-scheme water splitting on particulate photocatalytic systems. In particulate photocatalysts, photogenerated electrons and holes randomly diffuse in semiconductor particles and reach the surface to participate in redox reactions. In this case, it is uncertain whether directional charge separation can be achieved unless there is anisotropy in the crystal and electronic structure. Although there is no specific internal electric field, the photogenerated electrons and holes can reach the surface of the photocatalyst particle by diffusion due to their small size.

One of the notable distinctions of particulate photocatalysts from the PEC system is their size. Generally, photocatalysts are composites of semiconductor particles, with sizes of the order of micrometers, and nanoparticle cocatalysts, which can be regarded as miniature PEC systems. In photocatalysis, both reduction and oxidation reactions take place on each particle. Thus, the need for an outer electrical circuit is eliminated. However, a gas separator is required to avoid an explosive H2 and O2 mixture, unlike in PEC systems. It is suggested from a techno-economical analysis that the particulate photocatalyst system is the simpler of the two and is expected to be more viable in terms of cost-effectiveness and large-scale solar water splitting.11,12
2.2 Basics of particulate photocatalysts
Generally, photocatalysts are composed of semiconductor particles and cocatalyst nanoparticles, and are thus bifunctional materials. The semiconductor functions as a light absorbing and charge generating material while the cocatalyst promotes surface redox reactions by kinetic control. In addition to the band positions, sufficient carrier mobility in the semiconductor is necessary. Moreover, photocatalytic systems require better photochemical stability on the semiconductor surface than in photovoltaic-powered electrolyzer (PV-E) or PEC systems. This is because both reduction and oxidation reactions take place on the semiconductor surface in photocatalysis versus none and only one of the two redox reactions in PV-E and PEC systems, respectively.
Cocatalysts promote water splitting by reducing the overpotential in the HER and OER steps. Therefore, for photocatalytic water splitting, similar components to those of electrocatalysts13 for HER and OER are often employed as cocatalysts. Generally, cocatalysts comprise nanoparticles dispersed on the surface of semiconductor particles. Therefore, a lower interfacial resistance between the cocatalyst and semiconductor is preferable. In some cases, nanotechnology is the key to fabricating cocatalyst/semiconductor composites with suitable structures.14 The cocatalysts can also improve the stability of the photocatalyst against self-photodissociation. By selectively promoting the target reaction steps, side reactions that dissociate the photocatalyst surface can be suppressed. More importantly, cocatalysts should have dual functionality, i.e., promote water splitting and inhibit the competing reverse reaction to regenerate water. This is because water formation is far easier thermodynamically than water splitting, and thus the reverse reaction tends to be predominant. Concepts and methodologies for preventing the reverse reaction are well developed, and will be introduced in detail in the next section.
Hundreds of water splitting photocatalysts have been reported to date.10,15 Most of them are oxides containing metal cations with electronic configurations of either d0 for transition metal cations16–26 at their highest oxidation states or d10 for typical metal cations27–32 at their highest oxidation states. These d0- and d10-type oxides have wide bandgaps, necessitating UV light excitation in almost all cases. Since their VBM levels are commonly too positive, bandgaps inevitably exceed 3 eV if their CBM levels are more negative than the H+/H2 level. Their VBM mainly comprises O 2p orbitals in common with d0- and d10-type oxides, which results in their deep VBM.33 These oxides have surplus potential in their VBM compared to their CBM. Therefore, introducing new filled energy levels above the O 2p states into d0- and d10-type oxides by incorporating foreign components is a primary strategy for bandgap narrowing while maintaining suitable band potentials for water splitting.
Various components have been explored for creating a shallower VBM than O 2p states. The typical approach is doping or complex oxide formation, with Bi3+ 6s,34–36 Pb2+ 6s,36 Rh3+ 4d,37,38 Cr3+ 3d,39,40 and Ag+ 4d41 states as the typical VBM constituent orbitals applicable to bandgap narrowing. There have been some examples of overall water splitting based on such constituents. However, using this strategy, material variation has been insufficient, which has likely limited the resulting photocatalytic performance. The use of non-oxide materials is another means for creating new energy levels based on the same strategy. In this method, oxygen in oxides is replaced with different anionic components, and the orbitals of replaced anions could become VBM constituents.
Halides, chalcogenides and pnictides are potential non-oxide narrow-gap semiconductors. For example, CdS is a classical semiconductor absorbing visible light. CdS has a suitable band position for splitting water thermodynamically but is photodissociated due to kinetics. Valence band holes generated in bulk CdS migrate to the surface of the particles and oxidize the surface S2− to S preferentially over H2O to O2, resulting in self-oxidation of the material.42 The pnictides GaP43 and GaAs44 as well-known light absorbers in PV systems do not satisfy the thermodynamic band position to split water, and are susceptible to photoanodic dissociation. Most halides are unstable even in the dark because metal–halogen bonds easily dissociate in water due to their high ionic nature. Silver halides are an exception but are unstable under photoirradiation conditions. Although many non-oxides have good absorption bands for harvesting sunlight, most are unstable against water photolysis.
To solve this dilemma, our group has developed new non-oxide semiconductors as emerging photocatalytic materials. Specifically, nitrides, oxynitrides and oxysulfides were found to be stabler than other well-known non-oxide semiconductors. Nitrides and oxynitrides are made by full and partial substitution of nitrogen for oxygen in oxides, respectively. As schematically depicted in Fig. 4, the bandgap energy becomes smaller than that of the corresponding oxide upon incorporating nitrogen into the lattice, because N 2p orbitals form a filled energy state above the O 2p state as a VBM constituent.45 Similarly, the bandgap is narrower in oxysulfides than in the corresponding oxides because of the shallower energy level of the S 3p state than that of the O 2p state.
 Fig. 4  Schematic of a strategy for bandgap narrowing using non-oxides. 
To incorporate different anions into oxides, mere substitution of N or S for O is possible only to the extent of doping while stoichiometric compounds are not possible due to differences in valence or ionic radius. When O2− is replaced by N3−, two N3− ions substitute for three O2− ions to maintain the charge balance. This changes the cation/anion ratio, and inevitably changes the coordination number and crystal structure from those of the original oxides. Substitution of O2− by N3− should be accompanied by aliovalent cation substitution to maintain the original crystal structure. Therefore, creating complex cation–anion compounds is one strategy to develop this kind of material. In the case of S2−/O2−-substitution, although the valences are the same, the ionic radii are very different (S2− 1.84 pm, O2− 1.4 pm),46 which inhibits isostructural substitution. Therefore, materials synthesis and composition control cannot be performed flexibly for oxysulfides. In the past two decades, various reported and newly synthesized oxysulfides and (oxy)nitrides have been intensively studied as photocatalysts/electrodes. Recent advances in the application of these non-oxide semiconductors to photocatalytic/electrochemical water splitting under visible light are summarised in this paper.
3 Oxynitrides as emerging photocatalytic materials
Recently, oxynitrides have attracted much interest for use in applications such as pigments,47 photocatalysts,48 dielectrics,49 phosphorus,50 and optoelectronic materials.51 As photocatalysts, d0- or d10-type (oxy)nitrides based on Ti4+, Zr4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, W6+, Ga3+, In3+, Ge4+, Sn4+ or Sb5+ are candidate materials. A typical synthetic method for oxynitrides is thermal ammonolysis of the corresponding oxide or chloride precursor. However, this thermal process under a NH3 flow reduces some metal cations to a lower valence state. Typically, Sn4+,52 and W6+,53 states are reduction-prone, and thus it is difficult to maintain d0- and d10-electronic configurations, respectively, during thermal ammonolysis. In other cases, when Ti4+ and Nb5+-binary oxides, i.e., TiO2 and Nb2O5, are nitrided by NH3, TiN54 and NbN55 are produced, in which the original Ti4+ and Nb5+ are reduced to Ti3+ and Nb3+, respectively. However, d0-electron configurations, i.e., Ti4+ and Nb5+, can be maintained for quaternary oxynitrides with these components. For example, complex oxides of La2Ti2O7 and Sr2Nb2O7 are converted to LaTiO2N56 and SrNbO2N49 by thermal ammonolysis, in which the original valences of Ti4+ and Nb5+ are preserved. The strategy of utilizing complex cation–anion compounds is thus effective at controlling the electronic structure of the products.

Table 1 summarizes nitrides and oxynitrides that have been examined as water splitting photocatalysts. For d10-type oxynitrides, a binary nitride was first found to be capable of overall water splitting. Two binary nitrides, Ge3N457,58 and GaN,59,60 have wide bandgaps for absorbing UV light. Binary nitrides composed of any components in the next period, e.g., InN, may have smaller bandgaps for absorbing visible light, but none is stable under water splitting conditions. An effective component for decreasing the bandgap of Ge3N4 and GaN was found to be Zn, which can be incorporated into these parent compounds in the form of ZnxGa1−xOxN1−x,61,62 ZnGeN2,63,64 and Zn1+xGeOxN2.64 ZnxGa1−xOxN1−x is a solid solution of wurtzite ZnO and GaN. ZnGeN2 has a pseudo wurtzite structure and forms a solid solution with ZnO creating Zn1+xGeOxN2. The absorption band edge of quaternary oxynitrides extends into the visible region up to around 470 nm with a suitable Zn content. Zn1+xGeOxN2 and ZnxGa1−xOxN1−x are capable of overall water splitting with appropriate surface modifications. These are the first reproducible cases of visible-light-driven overall water splitting via one-step photoexcitation using a single type of semiconductor. A decade has already passed since these reports, and details concerning these photocatalysts can be obtained from other reports.48,65

For d0-type transition metal oxynitrides, the main cationic constituents are Ti4+, Nb5+ and Ta5+. W6+-based oxynitrides are difficult to synthesize because prevention of W6+ reduction to W5+ is difficult even with the use of a complex oxide precursor.66 For Zr4+-oxynitrides, it is difficult to synthesize oxynitrides from the corresponding oxide precursors. For example, LaZrO2N cannot be obtained from La2Zr2O7 by thermal ammonolysis, unlike the case of LaTiO2N fabrication from La2Ti2O7.56 This is because Zr–O bond dissociation and the resulting Zr–N bond formation are difficult. Therefore, the main active cationic components are Ti4+, Nb5+ and Ta5+.
Most of the compounds listed in the table have perovskite structures generally formulated as ABX3, where the A and B sites are occupied by two different cations. The A sites are occupied by large cations with a coordination of 12 while the latter are occupied by small cations with a coordination of 6. Specifically, alkaline earth and rare earth metal cations occupy the former sites, and the latter sites are occupied by transition metal cations. The X sites are occupied by O2− or N3− anions. The O/N ratio in these compounds varies with the total positive charge of the constituent cations. In other words, the O/N ratio in perovskite oxynitrides can be controlled by regulating the composition of the cationic constituents. All A, B and X sites allow substitution of different components at least in part. Therefore, various complex perovskite oxynitrides can be synthesized, such as LaTiO2N + SrNbO2N = LaxSr1−xTixNb1−xO2N67 and LaTaON2 + CaTaO2N = LaxCa1−xTaO2−xN1+x.47
The complex cation–anion strategy is also applicable to oxynitrides other than those with perovskite structures. In the table, TaON68 and Ta3N569 do have not a perovskite structure, but instead baddeleyite and anosovite structures, respectively. The former is isostructural to monoclinic ZrO2, thereby TaON and ZrO2 can form a series of solid solutions generally formulated as Ta1−xZrxO1+xN1−x.70 Here, the charge deviation between Ta5+ and Zr4+ is compensated for by N3−/O2−-substitution. Similarly, composition modification can be performed for Ta3N5 by incorporating Zr4+ or Mg2+ along with certain amounts of O2− as represented by Ta1−xZrxN5−xOx71 and Ta1−xMgxN5−3xO3x.72 On the basis of such a strategy, many d0-type transition metal oxynitrides with various compositions have been synthesized and their application to water splitting devices has been studied.
The photocatalytic water splitting capabilities of these transition metal oxynitrides were initially examined by test reactions using sacrificial reagents to confirm the potentials for H2 and O2 evolution. During this initial survey, this oxynitride group was found to have some abilities for H2 and O2 evolution. Classical non-oxide semiconductors such as CdS and CdSe are prone to self-oxidation as mentioned above, whereas the examined oxynitride group generally exhibits superior stability. Photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution under sacrificial conditions is a prerequisite for overall water splitting, because these processes are downhill reactions. Further efforts have been devoted to enabling water splitting in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. In this regard, water splitting performance has been evaluated mainly in two ways. One way is using a particulate photocatalyst for overall water splitting, and the other way is PEC water splitting with a bias-assisted half- or a non-biased tandem-cell. Recent advances in photocatalytic and PEC water splitting on some transition metal oxynitrides are described separately below.
To enhance the performance of photoelectrodes, the fabrication process is one of the factors. For example, highly efficient thin-film PVs or photoelectrodes of some sulfides can be directly fabricated on a conductive substrate via a vacuum process such as molecular beam epitaxy or radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. However, it is difficult to precisely fabricate transition-metal oxynitrides or oxides containing alkaline earth or rare-earth metal cations as a second cationic component, likely due to the problem with precisely controlling the deposition rate for each component. In contrast, a unique and flexible electrode fabrication method called the particle transfer (PT) method has been developed.73 In this method, oxynitride particles synthesized via conventional thermal ammonolysis can be subsequently fabricated into an electrode. As schematically shown in Fig. 5, oxynitride powder is first spread on a glass substrate. Metallic contact and conductor layers are successively deposited on top of the particle layer by sputtering. Next, the metal layer deposited on the particles layer is lifted off from the primary glass substrate and transferred onto another substrate. Finally, physically non-contacting particles are removed by sonication, creating an assembly of a monolayer of oxynitride particles embedded in a conductive substrate. Photoelectrodes based on many kinds of semiconductor particles can be fabricated using this method.

When transition metal oxynitrides are examined for PEC water splitting, they function as photoanodes because of their n-type semiconducting characteristics. Oxynitride photoelectrodes fabricated via the PT method show higher water splitting activity than particle-based photoelectrodes fabricated via other methods, e.g., squeegeeing, drop casting or electrophoretic deposition with a post-binding treatment. Oxynitride photoelectrodes fabricated via the PT method generally exhibit a photocurrent that is several times higher than that of particle-based photoelectrodes fabricated by any other method74 (see Fig. 6). The superior water splitting activity of PT photoelectrodes is responsible for lower electrical resistances at existing interfaces. The physical contact between the contact layer and the semiconductor particles is intimate, resulting in low electrical resistance. In addition, adjusting the work function of the contact layer relative to that of the semiconductor causes the interfacial electrical contact to become ohmic, resulting in low resistivity. Since PT electrodes are composed of almost monoparticle layer, and there are few interparticle boundaries along the path of photocarriers, the resistance due to such boundaries is also negligible. However, it should be noted that the semiconductor particles employed for PT electrodes must have a sufficient size or absorption coefficient to absorb most incident photons.

The blue lines show comparison data of a porous IrO2/LaTiO2N electrode fabricated via a conventional wet process. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 73; © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.) 
In some cases, compositional tuning can enhance the PEC water splitting performance. One such situation is with Mg + Zr-substituted Ta3N5.75 As mentioned above, Ta3N5 allows partial and isostructural substitution of Mg2+ or Zr4+ for Ta5+ by concurrently substituting O2− for N3−. Incorporation of Mg increases the photocurrent while Zr-incorporation shifts the onset potential toward the negative electrode potential (Fig. 7a). Moreover, co-substitution of Mg and Zr results in a synergetic effect of lower onset potential and increased photocurrent. The half-cell solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (HC-STH) of Ta3N5 electrodes increased from 0.07% (1.04 V vs. RHE) to 0.59% (0.82 V vs. RHE) by Mg and Zr substitution (Fig. 7b). The incorporation of Mg and Zr into Ta3N5 was found to shift the flat band potential toward the negative electrode potential while the bandgap itself was changed only slightly. Therefore, tuning of the flat band potential is responsible for the negative shift in the onset potential.

Regarding direct water splitting using particulate photocatalysts, a clear advance was recently demonstrated using d0-type transition metal oxynitrides. The key material was LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N, which absorbs light at wavelengths up to about 600 nm.76 This material has a perovskite structure with La at the A-site and Mg and Ta at the B-site. LaTaON277 can be regarded as the parent compound of LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N.78 Since the ionic radius of Mg2+ (72 pm) is closer to that of Ta5+ (64 pm) than to that of La3+ (136 pm), Mg2+ selectively occupies Ta5+ sites. Some of the N3− in LaTaON2 is concurrently replaced by O2− to maintain the charge balance, which allows an isostructural composition variation. From another viewpoint, LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N is essentially a solid solution between an oxynitride of LaTaON2 and an oxide of LaMg2/3Ta1/3O3.79 Moreover, a series of solid solutions between the two compounds with a wide range of solution ratios, LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x (x = 0–2/3), can be synthesized.77 The composition affects the electronic structure and impacts the photocatalytic activity. This relationship is demonstrated by the photocatalyst series given below.
As shown in Fig. 8, the photon energy at the absorption band edge wavelength increases with increasing x, reflecting bandgap widening by incorporation of Mg and O. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure by density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the lower part of the conduction band consists of Ta 5d orbitals, while the upper part of the valence band mainly consists of N 2p orbitals with a small contribution from O 2p orbitals (Fig. 9).80 Since the outermost orbitals of Mg2+ and La3+ are located at far more negative potentials than that for Ta 5d, the CBM is less influenced by these components. The value of x affects both the Mg/Ta and O/N ratios, but the O/N ratio has the main influence on the bandgap as a result of the shift in the VBM.

Overall water splitting into stoichiometric H2 and O2 proceeds on the LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x series for certain compositions after appropriate surface modification.76,81 As seen from Fig. 10, the photocatalytic activity of this series increases with increasing x from 0 to 0.33, and stoichiometric H2 and O2 evolution occurs for x = 0.33. For higher x values, the overall water splitting activity decreases. The increase in bandgap energy with the N/O ratio is thought to be responsible for this water oxidation ability. The decrease in photocatalytic activity for higher x values is likely due to decreased light absorption and carrier mobility resulting from the discrete band state as the N ratio becomes smaller. Although as x increases, the absorption band edge becomes blue-shifted and the usable wavelength range decreases, this series can still operate for overall water splitting up to about 600 nm for x = 0.33. This is optimum in terms of utilizing a wide wavelength range. However, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for this photocatalyst is still low (0.2% at 400–460 nm),81 and a further increase in photocatalytic activity is required.

The development of a new surface modification has significantly contributed to the overall water splitting for this photocatalyst system. When LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x (x ≥ 0.33) is modified with a hydrogen evolution cocatalyst such as Pt, Rh, RhOx or RhCrOx, N2 evolution occurs in addition to H2 and O2 evolution.81 This N2 evolution is attributable to self-oxidation of N species in the photocatalyst by photogenerated holes. Surface coating of the photocatalyst particles by a thin amorphous oxide layer, such as TiO2 or Ta2O5, creating a core/shell structure, inhibits N2 evolution and enables overall water splitting. Moreover, this surface coating effectively prevents the reverse reaction to water splitting. The reaction mechanism for enabling overall water splitting is schematically depicted in Fig. 11.82 The reverse reaction initiated by O2 reduction occurs on the surface of the photocatalyst, specifically on the cocatalyst surface. The coating layer is hydrophilic and enables incorporation of polar water molecules but inhibits inward diffusion of the less polar O2 molecules. Thus, the coating layer has a molecular sieving function. In this way, access of the product to the reverse reaction sites can be hindered without affecting the water splitting reaction. As described in the previous section, a cocatalyst for photocatalytic overall water splitting requires dual functionality to promote water splitting and to prevent the reverse reaction. This surface modification satisfies this requirement and helps realize overall water splitting.

This series of complex oxynitrides can be further modified. LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x is a variant of LaTaON2, in which B-site Ta5+ is partially substituted by Mg2+. A comparable ionic radius for the foreign component to that of the parent component is a primary requisite for isostructural substitution. Consequently, B-site Ta5+ (64 pm) can likely be substituted by Zr4+ (72 pm), Hf4+ (71 pm) or Sc3+ (74.5 pm), while A-site La3+ (136 pm) can be substituted by Ca2+ (134 pm), Sr2+ (144 pm) or Na+ (139 pm). The outermost orbitals of these foreign components are not band edge constituents, and they do not directly influence the band structure of the products. The series LaScxTa1−xO1+2xN2−2x with a perovskite structure can be fabricated similarly to the case of LaMgxTa1−xO1+3xN2−3x.80 This series corresponds to solid solutions of LaTaON2 and LaScO3. The bandgap of this series also increases with increasing x (Fig. 12), namely, the Sc/Ta and O/N ratios, and overall water splitting occurs above x = 0.5. However, the substitution of Zr4+ for Ta5+ was unsuccessful. Attempts to synthesize the LaZrxTa1−xO1+xN2−x series by a similar preparation method to the foregoing two series resulted in the formation of La2Zr2O7 as a byproduct. The difficulty in nitriding La2Zr2O7 to LaZrO2N causes isolation of the La2Zr2O7 phase and unsuccessful Zr incorporation into the perovskite structure, and thus the Zr series is incapable of overall water splitting.80 For the A-site, Ca2+ can substitute for La3+, creating the series La1−xCaxTaO1+xN2−x. In this case, overall water splitting proceeds at around x = 1, which is almost the composition of CaTaO2N.83 The thresholds for overall water splitting for x values in Mg-, Sc- and Ca-substituted series are 0.33, 0.5 and 1, respectively. These values are different in terms of the cation substitution ratio but are identical in terms of the O/N ratio, indicating that the VBM critically impacts water splitting activity.

The above group of transition metal oxynitrides has been studied since 2001. In the early stages, only sacrificial H2 or O2 evolution was detected. Subsequent studies on this photocatalyst group have recently led to overall water splitting under visible light. These oxynitrides have absorption bands up to 500 nm at most. In contrast, many transition metal oxynitrides have absorption bands up to 600 nm, which is advantageous for utilizing a wider portion of the sunlight spectrum. When Nb5+-based oxynitrides can be successfully applied to overall water splitting, operable wavelengths can be extended. Recent developments in transition metal oxynitride photocatalysts are an important step toward solar-driven water splitting, but significantly increasing the quantum efficiency at any given wavelength is necessary for its realization. For these compounds, not only the principal composition but also minor differences in composition, such as a divergence from stoichiometry, appear to impact water splitting activity, which still remains unestablished. In this regard, development of an appropriate synthetic route will be the key, and further studies are in progress.
4 Oxysulfides as stable photocatalytic materials
Oxysulfides are also interesting photocatalytic materials in non-oxide semiconductors. The basic concept of incorporating sulfur into oxides is essentially the same as that for nitrogen incorporation. Sulfur incorporation generally reduces the bandgap relative to that for the corresponding oxide by forming shallower filled energy states than O 2p states. In this respect, sulfides and oxysulfides have a similar advantage. However, oxysulfides are superior to sulfides in terms of photochemical stability. Although no sulfides have been reported to be capable of water oxidation, some oxysulfides have proved durable against water oxidation. At present, direct water splitting using a single oxysulfide is yet to be realized. However, some oxysulfides are applicable to PEC water splitting with bias assistance, p/n-tandem style, or Z-scheme, water splitting. Recent advances in the application of oxysulfides to photoelectrochemical/catalytic water splitting are described below.
In the case of oxynitrides, O2− and N3− have different valences but similar ionic radii. Therefore, N/O substitution is feasible by considering and adjusting the positive charges of cations with concurrent cation substitution. O2− and S2− have the same divalent negative charge, but they cannot be flexibly exchanged as in the case of N/O substitution. This is because the ionic radii of O2− and S2− differ significantly,46 which hinders isostructural anion substitution and the synthesis of new compounds. As reported in the former section, various oxynitride compounds can be newly designed by modifying the compositions of certain oxides or oxynitrides as base compounds. Synthesis of new oxysulfide compounds is not as easy. Only limited types of materials have been synthesized. Therefore, reported oxysulfides containing d0- or d10-metal cations have been surveyed.84–89 Among them, Sm2Ti2S2O584 and La5Ti2MS5O7 (M = Cu, Ag)87 have been examined intensively because of their interesting properties for photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic water splitting, and details of these studies are introduced below.
4.1 Sm2Ti2S2O5
The synthesis and crystal structure of Sm2Ti2S2O5 were first reported by Boyer et al.89 This material has tetragonal crystal symmetry with unit cell parameters of a = 3.819 Å, c = 22.964 Å and an I4/mmm space group, and the crystal structure is associated with a Ruddlesden–Popper type layered perovskite, Sr3Ti2O7, as schematically shown in Fig. 13. Sm2Ti2S2O5 consists of interlayer Sm3+ ions and A-site-defective perovskite blocks with a thickness corresponding to two TiSO5 octahedra. This material can be prepared by two main methods. One is sulfurization of an oxide precursor under a H2S flow. The other is a solid state reaction of a mixture of a composition-adjusted precursor in a quartz ampule.
 Fig. 13  Schematic of the crystal structure of Sm2Ti2S2O5. 
As seen in Fig. 14, Sm2Ti2S2O5 has an optical absorption band up to 650 nm, whereas Sm2Ti2O7 absorbs only in the UV region except for the f–f transition of Sm at around 400 nm. DFT studies revealed that the narrower bandgap of Sm2Ti2S2O5 is due to the formation of a shallower VBM consisting of S 3p orbitals. Photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that the CBM and VBM for this material straddle the H+/H2 and O2/H2O levels (Fig. 15). When Sm2Ti2S2O5 is used for photocatalysis after cocatalyst loading (Pt), H2 evolves in the presence of a suitable sacrificial electron donor (Na2S-Na2SO3, MeOH) under visible light irradiation (Fig. 16a). Even a pristine form of this material can evolve O2 under visible light in the presence of Ag+ ions as sacrificial electron acceptors (Fig. 16b). To the best of our knowledge, no sulfides have been reported to evolve O2 regardless of surface modification or sacrificial conditions. It has been reported that oxysulfides show good stability against water oxidation. O2 evolution activity increases upon depositing IrO2 as a cocatalyst.90 Moreover, deposition of a CoOx cocatalyst was found to be more effective in promoting O2 evolution than IrO2. The AQY for O2 evolution is 5% at 420 nm, indicating that Sm2Ti2S2O5 has a sufficient water oxidation ability.

Although Sm2Ti2S2O5 is capable of separately evolving H2 and O2 using sacrificial reagents, these reactions consume but do not store light energy. However, Sm2Ti2S2O5 can promote the uphill reaction of Z-scheme overall water splitting. Sm2Ti2S2O5 functions as a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP) in combination with WO3 as an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP). An I−/I3− redox couple functions effectively as an electron mediator to combine the remaining holes and excited electrons in the HEP and OEP, respectively. Overall water splitting proceeds under bandgap excitation with these components (Fig. 17).91 Optimizing the HEP, the OEP and the redox couple, as well as their combination, results in higher photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. For Sm2Ti2S2O5-HEP, CsCl-flux-mediated synthesis yields better crystallinity and higher photocatalytic activity than the conventional H2S-sulfurization method. Pt and IrO2 were found to be effective at promoting H+ reduction and I− oxidation on the HEP. For the WO3 OEP, PtOx-cocatalyst deposition and surface treatment with Cs+ and H+92 promote the oxygen evolution process, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. In the case of a combination of Sm2Ti2S2O5 and WO3, the operable wavelength range is limited to the absorption edge wavelength of WO3 despite the much longer absorption edge wavelength of Sm2Ti2S2O5. As a preliminary stage of this Z-scheme photocatalytic system, a combination of Sm2Ti2S2O5-HEP, TiO2 (rutile)-OEP and I−/IO3−-redox couple was examined.93 In this case, the operable wavelength was limited to that for TiO2. After the optimization of each component, WO3 with a narrower-gap material than TiO2 can be successfully applied as an OEP in Z-scheme water splitting. The application of much narrower-gap materials as the OEP is expected to lead to a much wider available wavelength range by further optimizing the entire system.

4.2 La5Ti2MS5O7 (M = Ag, Cu)
La5Ti2MS5O7 (M = Ag, Cu) has been intensively studied as another interesting oxysulfide for application to water splitting. La5Ti2AgS5O7 and La5Ti2CuS5O7 were first synthesized by Meignen et al.94 They produced orthorhombic crystal systems with lattice constants of a = 19.423 Å, b = 3.9793 Å, and c = 18.1191 Å for the Cu form, and a = 19.593 Å, b = 3.9963 Å, and c = 18.297 Å for the Ag form. These compounds have complex crystal structures as shown schematically in Fig. 18. The crystal structure can be understood by dividing it into three building blocks. One is an MS4-single tetrahedral unit grown only along the b-axis. The other is a corner-sharing Ti2O6−xSx-double octahedral unit also grown only along the b-axis. Both of the MS4 and Ti2O6−xSx units form straight chain structures, and they are connected in parallel by sharing the corner S atoms. Growth of these tetrahedral and octahedral units along the other axes is hindered by La-blocking layers. Thus, this material has a one-dimensional structure, in which the paths of photogenerated electrons and holes are separate. This is likely favorable for suppressing their recombination and for enhancing their photocatalytic activity.

The absorption band edges for La5Ti2AgS5O7 and La5Ti2CuS5O7 are 570 and 650 nm, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that the lower part of the conduction bands is mainly composed of Ti 3d orbitals for both La5Ti2AgS5O7 and La5Ti2CuS5O7, while the upper part of the valence bands is mainly composed of S 3p orbitals for La5Ti2AgS5O7. Cu 3d substantially overlaps with S 3p orbitals for La5Ti2CuS5O7 (Fig. 19).87 The more negative potential of the Cu 3d state than the S 3p state is responsible for the more negative VBM potential and narrower bandgap of La5Ti2CuS5O7 than La5Ti2AgS5O7.

La5Ti2CuS5O7 and La5Ti2AgS5O7 show photocatalytic activity for H2 and O2 evolution in the presence of the proper sacrificial electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Both Pt-deposited La5Ti2CuS5O7 and La5Ti2AgS5O7 show H2 evolution activity from Na2S-Na2SO3 aqueous solution under bandgap excitation. La5Ti2AgS5O7 has much higher H2 evolution activity than La5Ti2CuS5O7. In addition, both La5Ti2AgS5O7 and La5Ti2CuS5O7 are capable of O2 evolution after the deposition of IrO2 nanoparticles as a cocatalyst. Thus, these materials have the potential to split pure water into H2 and O2, but overall water splitting has not yet been realized on a particulate photocatalyst system.
These oxysulfides fabricated as electrodes exhibit interesting photoelectrochemical behaviors. Generally, p-type semiconductors function as photocathodes, and evolve H2 at the interface of the semiconductor and the electrolyte. When a sulfide is employed as a photocathode, the surface is stabler than in the case where it is employed as a photoanode. Most sulfides are inherently n-type semiconductors as are most oxides as long as their VBM consists of S 3p states. However, Cu+-containing sulfides tend to become p-type semiconductors. Therefore, the Cu+-containing oxysulfide, La5Ti2CuS5O7, functions as a photocathode.95 As shown in Fig. 20, a La5Ti2CuS5O7 photoelectrode fabricated by the particle transfer method shows a low cathodic photocurrent. Doping La5Ti2CuS5O7 with the lower valence cations, Sc3+ and Ga3+, to Ti4+-sites, and Ca2+ to La3+-sites, results in enhanced PEC activity for water splitting. Specifically, Sc3+ and Ga3+ doping of Ti4+ sites is effective. On the other hand, doping with the higher valence cations, Nb5+ and Ta5+, suppresses the PEC activity. These results indicate that p-type doping is effective at enhancing the photocathodic current. In addition, this material possesses a better photocurrent onset potential at 0.8–0.9 V versus RHE, and is suitable for overall water splitting with smaller bias or with less requirements for the combined photoanode.

La5Ti2CuS5O7 is dually applicable to both photocathodes and photoanodes by tuning its work function relative to a back contact layer.96 When La5Ti2CuS5O7 is embedded in Ti and Au as a conductive layer, it functions as a photoanode and a photocathode, respectively (Fig. 21). After depositing Pt- and CoPi on the La5Ti2CuS5O7 photocathode and photoanode, respectively, the photocurrent increases, because Pt and CoPi97 promote H2 and O2 evolution steps, respectively. The Faradaic efficiency of the Pt/La5Ti2CuS5O7/Au for H2 evolution is 97% while that of the CoPi/La5Ti2CuS5O7/Ti for O2 evolution is 79%. The lower Faradaic efficiency of the latter is likely attributable to partial self-oxidation of La5Ti2CuS5O7. As seen in Fig. 22, when a parallel connection of a Pt/La5Ti2CuS5O7/Au-photocathode and a CoPi/La5Ti2CuS5O7/Ti-photoanode is made, the electrode system can split water into H2 and O2 under no or low bias conditions. The O2 ratio in the products is a little less than stoichiometric. This is in accordance with the results for half-cell photoanodic water splitting. O2 evolution on a Cu+-containing material is quite a rare case. Although the two problems of low photocurrent and insufficient stability remain, this design concept is quite unique and is expected to be extendable to various systems.

The water splitting performance of the La5Ti2CuS5O7 electrode can be further improved by composition tuning. Since La5Ti2CuS5O7 and La5Ti2AgS5O7 have identical crystal structure with very few differences in lattice parameters, a series of their solid solutions with the general formula of La5Ti2Cu1−xAgxS5O7 can be synthesized.98 The bandgap energies for the edge compositions, La5Ti2AgS5O7 and La5Ti2CuS5O7, are 2.2 and 2.0 eV, respectively. The bandgap energy for intermediate compositions of La5Ti2Cu1−xAgxS5O7 series varies nonlinearly (Fig. 23). The smallest bandgap is obtained for a composition of La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7, extending the longest operable wavelength up to 710 nm. La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 doped with Al shows an enhanced photocurrent and a similar onset potential to that for Sc-doped La5Ti2CuS5O7. The high onset potential of this electrode allows the construction of a p/n-tandem cell for bias-unassisted water splitting in combination with existing photoanodes. Fig. 24 shows a typical example of PEC water splitting by a tandem electrode consisting of a La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1S5O7 photocathode and a BaTaO2N photoanode.99 Using the combination of this photocathode/anode, overall water splitting proceeds without bias application, and an operable wavelength up to 660 nm can be realized.98 By optimizing the two electrode surfaces and the reaction solution, the STH for non-biased water splitting reaches 0.14%.100 Although non-biased water splitting systems based on narrow bandgap materials can be constructed, the enhancement of the AQY is still needed.

5 Summary
In the past two decades, various new types of semiconductors based on non-oxides have been developed. Some have wide absorption bands in the visible region, and are suitable for harvesting sunlight energy. Synthesis of oxynitrides and oxysulfides and their application to water splitting systems via photocatalytic and/or photoelectrochemical routes were discussed in this paper with a focus on semiconductor engineering. Bandgap engineering to adjust VBM levels is the basic idea to utilize non-oxide semiconductors for harnessing visible light. This approach satisfies the thermodynamic band position as the primary requisite for water splitting. Consequently, various new semiconductors with narrow bandgaps have been realized. However, they were not directly applicable to overall water splitting. Photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical water splitting devices are the architectures of integrated functional components. Thus, enhancing the functions of other components and successfully building such architectures are also indispensable requirements for realizing efficient overall water splitting. Otherwise, the inherent ability of the semiconductor component cannot be sufficiently capitalized. Discovery of excellent cocatalysts has helped boost this research area. The development of fabrication methods for photoelectrodes has also enabled the application of various semiconductors to overall water splitting. Through these activities, several water splitting systems based on narrow-gap semiconductors, which are operable up to 600–700 nm, have been developed. Extension of the usable wavelength range is required in order to utilize the solar spectrum. However, the AQY is generally low for such cases. The narrower bandgap reduces the driving force for splitting water, and the AQY inevitably decreases. Therefore, real challenges to realize solar-driven water splitting must be overcome in the next research stage, where optimization of all photocatalytic components as well as their optimal integration is needed. Discovery of new semiconductor materials could also be expected to enhance research in this area.
