    , Accepted 27th October 2022First published on 27th October 2022AbstractHerein, we describe an efficient way to engineer the electronic energy defects and achieve the defect passivation of codoping of two rare-earth (RE) ions, namely, neodymium (Nd3+) and erbium (Er3+), into the TiO2 lattice. It is shown that the PEC performance is significantly improved using the RE-coated TiO2 photoanode. X-Ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman study have confirmed the doping concentration's upper limit without modifying the single-phase structure of the TiO2 lattice. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) study established the optimal codoping composition of “Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2” with enriched surface properties. Photoluminescence (PL) investigations indicated defect passivation, which enabled a favourable energy landscape via intermediate trap-sites, improving charge transport characteristics. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) device with the optimized codoped TiO2 photoanode has a higher increased photocurrent density (Jph) of 16 μA cm−2 in comparison to the device with pristine TiO2 (Jph: 7 μA cm−2). As a proof of concept, a simple sensitization of these engineered TiO2 photoanodes with the cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots resulted in a Jph of 2.8 mA cm−2, and with N719 ruthenium dye, a Jph of 0.8 mA cm−2 was obtained, indicating the improved performance of sensitized codoped TiO2 photoanodes for PEC devices. As a proof of concept, N719 dye-based dye-sensitized solar cells with doped TiO2 photoanodes demonstrated an enhanced power conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting (WS) has been an exciting research area for the choice to generate environment-friendly applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE).1–7 With enormous efforts, researchers improved the photon-to-current efficiency up to 12.4% with binary and 18% with the multi-junction structures.8,9 TiO2 is extensively used as a photoanode in the PEC device due to its photo-sustainability, low toxicity, and role in exciton generation/photo-excited electron transportation.10–18 Nonetheless, TiO2 has limited optical absorption due to the higher bandgap (3.2 eV) and the formation of defect states under the conduction band of TiO2.19 Numerous techniques were reported to improve the critical properties of TiO2 and enhance its performance as a photoanode.20–23 Doping TiO2 with lanthanide-ions is a proven approach to modify the defect sites in the TiO2 and thereby improve the optoelectronic properties of TiO2 photoanodes.24 This research area has received much attention due to the 4f–4f forbidden energy transitions and +3 oxidation states of RE-ions.25–28 These RE-doped TiO2 photoanodes performed well in photocatalytic,29,30 photovoltaic,31–33 and photoelectrochemical34–36 applications. Indeed, the trap-site photoinduced charge carrier generation and recombination effects play a vital role in the device performance.37–39 Typically, the defect (trap) states are placed near the conduction band of TiO2 with a gap down energy up to −1.1 eV. In contrast, the traps within the range of 0 eV to −0.4 eV are considered shallow traps,40,41 which facilitate the charge hopping mechanism and −0.4 eV to −1.1 eV the deep trap states, which can act as photoinduced charge recombination centers. The shallow/deep trap-states can be deformed/passivated in the TiO2 with the optimal concentration of RE-dopants. The doping of RE3+ ions in the TiO2 lattice effectively introduces favourable intra-band transitions in TiO2. For example, Er-doped TiO2 and Nd-doped TiO2 photoanode-based PEC devices exhibited improved performance compared to those with pristine TiO2.10,42,43 Co-sensitization of bare TiO2 photoanodes with quantum dots,10 dye molecules,44,45 metal ions (LSPR),46,47 and perovskites48 resulted in improved solar energy conversion performances of devices.
This work explores the combined effect of codoping of Er3+ and Nd3+-ions into the TiO2 lattice with suitable stoichiometry. According to the results presented, codoping is a significant influencer in TiO2 defect engineering. There are few reports that highlight the significance of the lanthanide (Er, Nd, and Er:Nd) ions in the increased optical absorption properties of TiO2.28,49 F. Gonell et al.12 reported an Er3+/Yb3+ co-sensitized TiO2-based device that exhibited a photocurrent density of 0.8 μA cm−2. K. K. Mandari et al.50 showed a photocurrent density of 0.8 μA cm−2 using a Gd-influenced defect site in N-doped TiO2. W. Chen et al.51 developed a PEC device with a gold nanoparticle-sensitized TiO2 and reported a photocurrent density of Jph: 6 μA cm−2. TiO2 devices were found to have a micro-range photocurrent density, according to Peng Gu et al.52
Compared to previous studies of codoped TiO2, the devices described in this work had a higher photocurrent density (Jph: 16 μA cm−2) with the optimal stoichiometry ratio for the Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2 photoanode. Furthermore, these photoanodes were also tested with the co-sensitizers of CdS QDS and N719 ruthenium dye to understand the adsorption and injection properties of RE codoped TiO2. As anticipated with CdS and N 719 dye sensitizers, the PEC exhibited the highest photo-current densities (Jph: 2.8 mA cm−2 and 0.7 mA cm−2). Additionally, the dye-sensitized photoanodes were tested for photovoltaic applications. Dye-sensitized solar cells consisting of Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2 photoanodes showed a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of (η) 6.5%, about 20% enhancement compared to pristine TiO2 (η: 5.3%). With the latest development of using perovskites as a sensitizer in solar cells, it is expected that the results presented here will pave the way for higher-efficiency solar cells employing codoped TiO2. Similarly, using codoped photoanodes in conjunction with suitable sensitizers is expected to produce high-performance PEC devices.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The chemicals used in the study, namely, TiO2 powder (P-25, anatase, 15 to 25 nm), Er2O3 (99.9%) and Nd2O3 (99.9%). Triton X-100, sodium sulfide (Na2S), cadmium acetate dihydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98%), sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99%), N719 dye (ruthenium complex, 95%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (C9H13N, 98%), lithium iodide (LiI, 99.9%), iodine (I2, 99.99%), and 1,2-dimethylimidazolium iodide (C5H9IN2, 98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Valeronitrile (CH3(CH2)3CN, 99%), acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99%), DI water (18.2 MΩ cm−1), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99%), acetone (C3H6O, 99%), methanol (CH3OH, 99.8%), and acetylacetone (C5H8O2, 99%) were purchased from SRL suppliers. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 8 Ω per square, LumTec, Taiwan) and platinum (Pt) coated substrates were purchased from Solronix, Switzerland.
2.2. Synthesis of RE-ion co-doped TiO2
A solid-state grinding (ball-milling) approach was used to pulverise the RE-doped TiO2 composition. In this method, all the requisite stoichiometry ratios of dopant, co-dopant, and TiO2 compositions were placed in a steel jar, and a specified amount of binder (IPA) was added to the composition. For uniform grinding, zirconium balls were added in the powder-filled jar at a ratio of ten zirconium balls to one gram of powder. Afterward, the steel jar was tightly closed and placed in the ball milling instrument for grinding. After ten hours of grinding, the powder mixture was removed from the steel jar and washed with DI water. This wet composition was transferred to an oven and heated to 100 °C for 6 hours to evaporate the liquid content in the compound and again annealed at 500 °C for 2 hours to remove any strain generated during the pulverization process. The resultant product is used for photoanode preparation.
2.3. Material characterization
X-ray diffraction was used to determine the crystal structure characteristics (X'PertPRO with Cu K radiation of λ = 0.15406 nm). The Raman spectrum was used to explore the complexities of molecular bonding using a Bruker Senterra dispersive Raman microscope spectrometer with a λex of 532 nm at ambient temperature. UV-visible spectroscopy (UV3092, LAB INDIA) was used to investigate the optical absorption/reflection in a diffuse-reflectance spectrum (DRS) mode. The Kubelka–Munk relation was then used to estimate the indirect bandgap value. For Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis, the nitrogen gas adsorption/desorption isotherm was determined at a low temperature (liquid nitrogen; −198 °C) using an automated gas adsorption analyzer (NOVA2200e, Quantachrome, USA). The materials were degassed for 3 hours in a vacuum for the BET measurements. TEM (JEM 2100) measurements were employed to determine the particle size, and the SAED fringes were used to study the structural properties of the composition. PL (FLS 1000, Edinburgh instruments) and charge decay time (TrPL) with TCSPC (Time Correlated Single Photon Counting) (FLS 1000) measurements were carried out to understand the charge recombination and transport properties of RE-ion doped TiO2.
2.4. Thin film fabrication
The doctor-blade technique was used to fabricate a mesoporous TiO2. First, the FTO substrates were cleaned with three solvents of soap solution for 15 minutes, acetone for 15 minutes, and DI water for 15 minutes using an ultrasonication bath. For the paste preparation, the TiO2 powder was mixed with a binder (15% acetylacetone:85% DI water) and sonicated for 15 minutes. The TiO2 paste was then sonicated for 15 minutes with Triton-X to make a homogeneous paste. Thin films were made using the paste. Two layers of TiO2 were deposited one upon another using the doctor-blade technique. After each deposition layer, the film was dried at 70 °C for 30 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of annealing at 500 °C. The films were then immersed in a 40 mmol% TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 1 hour to make a nonporous pigment, dried at 70 °C for 30 minutes, and annealed at 500 °C for 30 minutes.
2.5. PEC device construction and characterization
The PEC cell was designed to facilitate the water-splitting reaction. A three-electrode system was used to construct the PEC device. The RE-doped TiO2 film was employed as the working electrode. A platinum (Pt) wire was used as a photocathode (counter electrode), and an Ag/AgCl electrode worked as the reference electrode. 0.5 mol% of Na2SO4 (pH 7) was added into DI water and used as an electrolyte. The standard reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential is determined using the Nernst equation E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 × pH + E°, where the standard potential is E: 0.197 VS RHE, and the electrolyte has a pH of 7. The cyclic voltammetry measurements of the PEC device were performed using an Autolab PGSTAT 302 N equipped with a 40 W white LED light source under chopped light illumination in a time interval of 5 s to check the photo-activity of the device. In addition, applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (η) was calculated using the following equation: η = J[1.23 − V]/Pa, where J is the photocurrent density, V is the applied bias versus RHE, and Pa is the power density (100 mW cm−2) of incident light illumination, respectively. Similarly, impedance analysis was performed with the same Autolab PGSTAT 302 N. The resultant Nyquist plots were fitted by using NOVA 2.2 software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties of (Er3+ & Nd3+) co-doped TiO2
The crystal structure and phase purity of the pristine TiO2 and RE3+ ion-doped TiO2 were investigated by XRD analysis over 2θ: 20° to 80°. The XRD pattern of the TiO2 related lattice points of [hkl]: [101], [103], [004], [112], [200], [105], [211], [104], [116], [220], and [215], respectively, indicates the anatase phase and conforms with the standard data file (JCPDS: 21-1272). Additionally, a few lower intense diffracted peaks were discovered that correspond to the lattice points of [hkl]: [110], [101], [111], and [220], indicating that the peaks are associated with the rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS file no: 21-1276). Concisely, the pristine TiO2 exhibited with both anatase (∼85) and rutile (∼15) phases, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Similar XRD patterns are observed for RE-doped TiO2 compared to pure TiO2, confirming the efficient incorporation of RE-ions into the TiO2 lattice. A slight peak shift was observed in the XRD pattern of RE-doped TiO2 due to the variant ionic radius of RE3+ and Ti4+. In addition, the XRD peaks of RE-doped TiO2 were found to be broader due to reduced crystallinity. As a result, the concertation of doping was kept to a minimum to avoid affecting the crystal structure of TiO2. Additionally, the Williamson–Hall (W–H) plot was used to determine the grain size and strain of the compositions; βcosθ = Cεsinθ + (Kλ/D), where β is the full width at half maximum of the diffraction, K is the Scherrer constant (0.94), C is a constant value (=4), ε is the strain, D is the crystal size, and λ is the wavelength of the X-ray source Cu-Kα (=0.1541 nm). Fig. 1(c and d) presents the W–H plots of pristine TiO2 and the Er (0.3)–Nd (0.1)–TiO2 compositions and the other compositions supplemented in the ESI (S2).† This W–H plot equation is analogous to the straight-line equation. Strain in a compound is the slope of the linear fit, and the intersect is the grain size. The grain size and strain values are listed in Table 1.

Compared to pristine TiO2, the RE-doped TiO2 compounds exhibited reduced grain size. The grain size reduction may be attributed to the formation of interstitial sites due to the ionic radius difference between RE3+ and Ti4+.53 The interstitial sites form a diffused barrier near the Ti4+-sites by segregating the RE-oxide/hydroxide phases on the grain boundaries of TiO2, which inhibits the crystal growth and phase transformation (anatase–rutile). In addition, the possibility of forming the RE–Ti–O bond stabilizes the Ti–O bond, which inhibits the growth of crystals.54 Grain size reduction is one of the main factors for photocatalytic enhancement.55–57 The smaller grain compounds may have a greater specific surface area, as shown by the BET isotherm study. It is recognized that the higher specific surface area provides abundant sunlight. In addition, the RE-doping-induced suppression of anatase-to-rutile phase transformation increases charge mobilities because the smaller grain anatase-phase TiO2 has greater mobility than the rutile phase. Moreover, the smaller grains improve the nano-surface area, enhancing oxygen vacancies and defects,58 and developing surface near defects increases charge separation and transport. Therefore, the smaller grain RE-doped TiO2 compounds would enhance the photocatalytic capabilities significantly.
Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the structural properties of RE-ions and their bonding to the TiO2 semiconducting material. The Raman spectra of TiO2, Er-doped TiO2, Nd-doped TiO2, and (Er:Nd) codoped TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 1(e and f). The active vibrational modes of TiO2 were exhibited at the position of 142, 193, 392, 515, and 635 cm−1, denoted with the group elements of Eg, Bg1, and Ag1, respectively. In contrast, Eg corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibrational mode. Ag1 relates to the anti-symmetric bending vibrational mode, and Bg1 is the symmetric bending vibrational mode of the O–Ti–O bond, respectively.59 As demonstrated in Fig. 1(e), the exhibited vibrational modes suggest the anatase phase, and the low-intensity vibrational mode of Eg at 445 cm−1 indicates the rutile phase of TiO2. Furthermore, RE-ion-doped TiO2 compositions displayed similar vibrational modes with a minor phase shift toward higher wavenumbers than the TiO2 illustrated in Fig. 1(f). The peak shift may attribute the RE-ion doping effect to the TiO2 lattice.48 This peak shift could represent the structural deformation observed in the XRD pattern of RE-doped TiO2. Additionally, a few multi-site vibrational modes were detected in the Raman spectrum of RE-doped TiO2. The (Eg + Fg) peak at 345 cm−1 revealed the Er–O bond associated with Er2O3.60 Additionally, it is observed that the Raman peak intensity increased with RE-ion dopants, indicating non-stoichiometry defects that improve photo absorption.61 Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2 exhibited more intense Raman peaks, suggesting superior absorption.
3.2. Morphological properties
TEM measurements were used to evaluate the morphological properties. The size, shape, and distribution of the particles of pristine TiO2 and RE-ion doped TiO2 compositions are shown in Fig. 2. Pristine TiO2 is displayed with the spherical shape of particles. The particle distribution curves were used to calculate the average particle size. The particle size of pristine TiO2 was determined to be 32 nm, whereas the other RE-doped TiO2 compositions (Er-doped TiO2, Nd-doped TiO2, and Er:Nd codoped-TiO2) were represented by smaller spherical particles than TiO2. The presented grain values were consistent with the W–H plot-derived grain sizes. Additionally, the materials were subjected to a pattern of selective area electron diffraction (SAED). The SAED pattern of TiO2 reveals intense lattice fringes corresponding to [hkl]: [002], [211], [112], [200], and [101], indicating that the TiO2 has both anatase and rutile phases, as shown in Fig. 2(g–i). On the other hand, the RE-doped TiO2 compounds exhibited no bright lattice fringes, indicating that they have low crystallinity due to the RE-ion doping of the TiO2 lattice. The diffracted fringes of RE-doped TiO2 compositions were similar to those of TiO2, supporting the effective doping of RE into the TiO2 lattice. The resulting lattice points match the XRD pattern exactly.

3.3. Surface analysis
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) multilayer N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm was used to determine the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size of pure TiO2 and RE-doped TiO2, respectively. The type III hysteresis loop is depicted in Fig. 3(a–d), along with the corresponding relative pressure (P/P0). TiO2 has a specific surface area of 54.9 (m2 g−1), which is enlarged to 69.05 (m2 g−1) under the Er/Nd codoping, as shown in Table 2. The high BET surface area could suggest the enriched adsorption ability and charge transport capabilities across interfaces.62 Thus, it is hypothesized that RE ion codoped TiO2 films can enhance photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the dye desorption studies from the UV-visible absorption spectra were conducted to determine the dye loading status.Fig. 3(e) presents the UV-vis absorption spectra for 719 dye loaded RE-doped TiO2 films. The characteristic absorption bands were observed for N719 dye-adsorbed films at 390 nm and 530 nm, respectively. In contrast, Er/Nd-doped TiO2 displays more intense and broad bands than the other films, indicating greater dye adsorption than the pure TiO2 film owing to its high specific surface area; these results are consistent with the BET isotherm. For dye adsorption and desorption studies, TiO2 films were first immersed in a dye solution for 5 h to load the dye into the TiO2 films. The dye was then removed from the films using ethanol:water solution containing 0.1 M NaOH. Fig. 3(f) displays the UV-vis absorption spectrum of desorbed dye molecules. The observations indicate that the optical absorption of the desorbed dye from the (Er:Nd) codoped TiO2 film is relatively more intense. The concentration (c) of the adsorbed dye can be computed using the Beer–Lambert law. A = ε·c·l(1)

A is the absorption peak intensity, ε is the molar extinction coefficient of N719 dye (14100 M−1 cm−1 at 515 nm), and l is the path length of the optical beam (1 cm), respectively. The dye adsorption was computed by using the following equation.63 (2)

Table 2 summarises the calculated values. It has been observed that RE-doped TiO2 photoanodes exhibit a more significant dye loading than unmodified TiO2 films. Dye-loaded Er–Nd–TiO2 photoanode employed PEC, and DSSC devices delivered the highest current densities.
3.4. Optical properties
The optical reflectance (R%) spectra recorded in Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) mode for the various (Nd:Er) codoped TiO2 are shown in ESI S3.† Here, the TiO2 exhibited an absorption edge near 370 nm, implying that solar spectrum utilities are restricted to the UV region. Additionally, the absorption spectrum exhibits a few undetectable weak absorption bands between 420 nm and 550 nm due to Ti3+ defect d–d transitions.64 The presence of RE3+-ion dopants significantly impacted the defects in the TiO2. The Er-doped TiO2 showed a redshift in the absorption edge and the sharp absorption bands at 445 nm, 523 nm, and 655 nm, which enhances the host material's absorption properties.42 Similarly, the other dopant of the Nd-doped TiO2 compound redshifted the absorption edge. In addition, it shows sharp absorption peaks at 520 nm, 585 nm, and 745 nm, enhancing absorption abilities.65 Notably, the absorption spectra of (Er:Nd) codoped TiO2 exhibited both the Er and Nd-related absorption bands. The appropriate doping ratio of Er to Nd is expected to increase the absorption properties due to energy transfer (ET) between the Er and Nd energy levels. As a result, the RE co-dopant TiO2 may be significantly more helpful than the individual RE dopants. Additionally, the optical band gap values were approximated using the Kubelka–Munk relation F(R) = (1 − R)2/2R vs. photon energy, where F(R) denotes the Kubelka–Munk function and R denotes the diffuse reflectance. The Tauc plots for the indirect bandgap calculations are shown in Fig. 4(a), and the calculated bandgap values are tabulated in Table 3. It is noticed that in the presence of RE-ion co-dopants, there are significant fluctuations observed in the bandgap alignment. The bandgap of TiO2 is observed to be slightly reduced from 2.26 eV to 2.22 eV in the presence of Nd (0.4 mol%) doping, similar changes were found elsewhere,10 which can be attributed to the redshift of the conduction band.66 Here, Nd3+ introduced the 4f–4f intra-band transitions between the TiO2 bandgap, and these energy states are spread beneath the conduction band and also extend into the deep level, as illustrated in the schematic diagram in Fig. 5. These localized states enhance the absorption tail, which is a prerequisite for bandgap reduction.67 On the other hand, TiO2 doped with Er revealed a lowered bandgap value of 2.26 eV to 2.23 eV at a doping concentration of (0.2 mol%). Additionally, as previously reported in other studies, the bandgap was shown to be improved upon Er doping concentrations.42 This increased bandgap energy implies an upshift in the conduction band of TiO2 due to the substitution of Er3+ ions for the Ti3+ traps, comparable to the work reported by Rini Lahiri et al.,60 where Er-ion doping demonstrated a trap-assisted Moss–Burstein (M–B) effect. With this approach, the Er-ions could produce traps at the conduction band edge of TiO2, resulting in a blue shift in the conduction band that employs bandgap enlargement.31,68,69 Nevertheless, Er-doping allows for the generation of excessive charges and their storage in the conduction band, which benefits charge mobility. By passivating the Ti3+ traps in the TiO2 lattice, the optimal doping (Er (0.1 mol%)–Nd (0.3 mol%)-doped TiO2) composition displayed superior absorption abilities due to its effective charge carrier exchange/transport capabilities between Er3+ and Nd3+. This alteration in the bandgap shift indicates structural deformation caused by the substitution of Ti4+ ions by RE3+ ions. Typically, defects such as oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ traps are present in TiO2 semiconductors. The traps were dispersed beneath the conduction band with a gap-down energy of −0.1 eV to −1.1 eV from the conduction band. Among defects, Ti3+ vacancies are classified as edge traps or shallow traps because they are located below the conduction band up to the range of >−0.4 eV, whereas electrons trapped in shallow traps do not readily recombine, leading to better charge transport. The deep trap states form with a gap down energy of −0.4 eV to −1.1 eV, which may operate as permanent recombination centres, thereby inhibiting the charge carrier transport.10,32 A detailed examination of the trap-assisted optical recombination properties of RE-doped TiO2 was presented using PL studies to aid comprehension.

 Fig. 5  The possible PL emissions (optical recombination) related to the intra-band energy transitions (trap states) of TiO2, Nd-doped TiO2, Er-doped TiO2, and Nd–Er-doped TiO2 compositions; scheme (a) under the excitation energy of 350 nm; scheme (b) under the excitation energy of 405 nm; (i) Ti3+ defects and oxygen vacancies (Vo), (ii) shallow trap states, and (iii) deep trap states (the thick decay line represents the dominated recombination). 
On the other hand, we evaluated the extended absorption tail properties through the Urbach tail depicted in Fig. 4(b). Urbach energy (EU) is computed using the relation of α = α0exp(hν/EU), where α can be related to the F(R), and α0 indicates the structural disorders of the material. This structural fluctuation originates from the surface/shallow traps and lattice–phonon interaction.70,71 The Urbach band tail is a confined state that allows the bandgap width to be decreased. Increased Urbach energies suggest the presence of additional defects,70,72 resulting in improved absorption properties.
Photoluminescence (PL) emission measurements were performed at 350 nm and 405 nm to analyze the band edge and defect-site luminescence characteristics of RE3+ ion-modified TiO2 as shown in Fig. 4(c and d). The ultraviolet excitation (350 nm (3.5 eV)) generates enough energy to overcome the larger bandgap of TiO2 (3.25 eV). A visible excitation wavelength of 408 nm (3 eV) is adequate to reach defect states such as Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies (Vo), which are responsible for trap-based PL emissions. In detail, the PL emission properties of the RE-ion-doped TiO2 compounds were initially investigated under excitation at 350 nm. The intense PL peak was centered at 430 nm, corresponding to self-trapped excitons associated with Ti3+ defect states.73 Additionally, a low-intensity edge peak at 470 nm was found, which is attributed to the self-trapped exciton in the presence of surface defects and oxygen vacancies.74–76 A few low-intensity peaks were discovered and are highlighted in Fig. 4(e) using deconvolution peak fitting. The band-edge emission peak was located at 380 nm (3.19 eV) UV region,77 and the other 520 nm-centered PL peak corresponds to the oxygen vacancies. The peak at 600 nm can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups present in the composition. Furthermore, RE-doped TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited a similar PL spectral pattern with a slight quenching impact due to the reduced intra-band distance. Indeed, there is energy transfer between the TiO2 conduction band and the RE-ion intra-bands in a non-radiative fashion in the RE-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, which makes the recombination process slow down, keeping adequate charge carrier transportation. Notably, the individual RE ions of Er-doped TiO2 exhibited the most intense PL emission peak under the excitation of 350 nm among all the RE-doped TiO2 compositions, owing to the enriched localized trap states. These defect states can act as recombination centers in the TiO2 bandgap, allowing for the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pair (e−/h+) carriers.78 On the other hand, the PL emission peak was quenched by the Nd-doping ions, indicating a significant increase in the charge transfer occurrence between the Ti and Nd energy states. For a better understanding of the charge dynamics in the RE-doped TiO2 compositions, Fig. 5 demonstrates the prospects for trap-based PL emissions.
All the peaks in the region of the PL emission spectrum result from oxygen vacancies in both shallow and deep trap states. RE-ion-doped TiO2 compositions were excited with a visible excitation wavelength of 408 nm further to understand RE-ions' effect on trap-based luminescence qualities. In this case, the intense PL emission peak for pristine TiO2 was observed at 520 nm, corresponding to the oxygen vacancies.79 The inclusion of RE-ion dopants significantly suppressed the luminous peak at 520 nm while enhancing the other trap-site PL emissions at 430 nm and 465 nm. The ensuing PL emissions are consistent with the TiO2-related trap states being modified and passivated by the RE-ion inner transition energy levels.
In contrast to the Nd-doped TiO2, the Er-doped TiO2 composition demonstrated a quenching in the PL emission at 430 nm and 465 nm. The combination of (Nd:Er)-codoped TiO2 presents a higher quenching in the PL emission, as presented in Fig. 4(f). The arguments behind this PL quenching effect are illustrated in Fig. 5 using a scheme of recombination investigations. This schematic model of optical recombination presented the bandgap of TiO2 by including their self-defects and luminescence abilities. The Er3+ ion-related inner energy transitions reside between the valence band and conduction band of the TiO2, and the Nd3+ ion-related energy transitions reside near the conduction band of TiO2. According to Fig. 5 (scheme a), TiO2 exhibits a significant emission peak at 430 nm under excitation at 350 nm, which corresponds to the shallow trap states. Indeed, these shallow trap-states were seen to be improved with both Nd and Er-related energy states since it is well known that shallow trap-states participate in charge hopping transport efficiently. Thus, the charge recombination process becomes slower, thereby enhancing charge collection. In particular, Nd3+ ion-related trap states were found to be effective participants in the electron hopping transport mechanism since the majority of energy levels were located around the shallow trap area, which aids in charge transportation support. On the other hand, the energy levels associated with Er3+ have a lower occupancy in a shallow trap zone. Thus, Er-doped TiO2 emitted a more intense PL than Nd-doped TiO2. However, the combination of (Er:Nd)–TiO2 composite associated energy states spanned the entire defect site in TiO2, indicating that the limitation imposed by individual RE-ions can be overcome. Consequently, the RE codoped TiO2 provides a higher quenched PL.
As indicated by the significant quenching at 520 nm under 408 nm excitation in Fig. 4(f), which correlates with Fig. 5(b), the RE-energy states may have passivated the deep trap states in the TiO2 lattice. In individual comparison, Er-doped TiO2 shows a higher quenching in the PL emission at 470 nm (associated with surface traps and oxygen vacancies) than Nd-doped TiO2 due to their prolonged energy states into the deep level. Thus, as previously stated, individual limits can be overcome through the use of codoping, declared in Fig. 5 (scheme(a)). At all emission sites, Er:Nd codoped TiO2 produced the low intensity PL emission peak, implying effective charge carrier transit between the Ti (3d) and RE (4f) states. In summary, the combination of Er3+ and Nd3+ doping elements demonstrated quenching effects in the PL emission at 350 nm and 408 nm excitation wavelengths. It is hypothesized that the ideal stoichiometry ratio of RE (Er:Nd) codoped TiO2 could significantly increase charge transportation through energy exchange between the Nd and Er energy states.
Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence emission (TrPL) was recorded to understand the RE-doping concentration-dependent electron transport studies, as shown in Fig. 4(g and h). The charge decay lifetimes were monitored at 430 nm and 520 nm PL emission sites, respectively, the major photoluminescence emission peaks occurred. The double exponential fit yielded the corresponding PL decay values. Table 4 and 5 present the fitted parameters. In all cases, the RE codoped TiO2 samples show a longer decay lifetime than the pristine TiO2, implying that the charge injection rate from the photoanode to the electrodes is improved.

3.5. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance
The cyclic voltammetry measurements of pristine TiO2 and a RE-doped TiO2 photoanode-based PEC device were carried out under chopped LED light irradiation (adjusted to one sun illumination using a power meter). The device exhibited the maximum photocurrent when the light was on and zero current when the light was turned off, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). These fluctuations indicate the material's high photoactivity. The photocurrent density can be improved with the optimal RE-ion doping elements into the TiO2 lattice, as demonstrated in a previous article.42 As expected, the photocurrent density of Nd- and Er-doped TiO2 thin film electrodes is greater than that of pristine TiO2. Over the different stoichiometry ratios of Er3+ and Nd3+ rare-earth elemental compositions, Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2 composition performed with the higher photo-current density of Jph: 0.02 mA cm−2, which is three times higher as compared with the pristine TiO2 (Jph: 0.007 mA cm−2) at an applied potential of 1.23 eV. Similarly, photon-to-current efficiency was computed. The RE-doped TiO2 working electrode showed higher photon-to-current efficiency than the pristine TiO2, as presented in Fig. 6(b). The RE-ion codoped TiO2 photoanodes exhibit twice that of the pristine TiO2 photoanodes.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was utilized to determine the resistance between the PEC device's interfacial layers. Fig. 6(c and d) illustrates the Nyquist plot, the Bode magnitude plot, and the Bode phase angle–frequency plot. The measurements were performed at an applied bias of −1.23 eV in the dark, under a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The Nyquist plot is displayed with the two depressed semicircles. Each semicircle is attributed to the interface between the two interlayers in the PEC device. Smaller semicircles generally indicate lower charge transfer resistances at the electrode–electrolyte interface.80 The smaller semicircular arcs found for the RE-doped TiO2 photoanode-based PEC device compared to the TiO2 photoanode, which refers to the lower impedance properties. As a result, the RE-doped TiO2 exhibits enhanced electron mobility. The resistance values were estimated by fitting this Nyquist plot to an appropriate electric circuit design, as seen in Fig. 6(c). Table 6 summarises the extracted resistance values. R1 is the series resistance provided by the FTO, photoanode, electrolyte, and electrodes. R2 denotes the charge recombination resistance between the electrolyte and photoanode. Constant Phase Element (CPE) is a fitting parameter represented by the impedance ZCPE = 1/Q(jω)α, where the CPE can behave as a resistor, capacitor, and inductor when the value is 0, 1, and −1. According to Table 6, all RE-doped TiO2 photoanode-based PEC devices had lower interfacial resistance values than pristine TO2, which improved charge transportation.

The Bode magnitude was found to be greater at low frequencies and gradually decreased with increasing frequency. The impedance relaxation demonstrates that RE-doped TiO2 exhibits a more rapid Bode magnitude relaxation than pristine TiO2, indicating the improved ohmic contacts, implying a low resistance offering at the interfaces in the PEC device, as illustrated in Fig. 6(d). The lifetime of photogenerated electrons can be computed using the equation of τ = 1/2πfmax, where fmax indicates the maximum oscillation frequency of the impedance. The photogenerated electron lifetimes were found to be much longer in RE-doped TiO2 (τ) than in the pristine TiO2 (τ). The increased lifetime is due to a longer electron diffusion length and a lower rate of electron–hole recombination.81 Additionally, Bode phase (ϕ)-frequency oscillation is utilized to estimate the recombination of (e−–h+), as shown in Fig. 6(e). The characteristic frequency maximum (fmax) of the RE-doped TiO2 photoanodes is observed to be displaced to the lower phase-angle side, implying altered charge transportations. It is hypothesized that the appropriate stoichiometry ratio of Er to Nd ions enhances charge transport properties due to the favorable trap-state alignment in the TiO2 lattice.
The mechanism and operation of the PEC water-splitting technique, as well as the enhanced photophysical properties, were established using the schematic diagram illustrated in Fig. 6(f). It demonstrated the conceivable pathways of exciton population in the RE-doped TiO2 under light illumination. The advantage of deformed defect states of RE-doped TiO2 is increasing light energy harvesting by utilizing low energetic photons that engage in exciton formation via down-conversion/up-conversion actions. Thus, this RE-doped TiO2 photoanode may create additional charge carriers and then transport them to the counter electrode via an external circuit, assisting in the water reduction process for hydrogen generation. As a result, photoinduced holes aid in water oxidation at the opposite electrode (photoanode). Moreover, the performance of the PEC device can be increased by using additional sensitizers, such as dye molecules and quantum dots.
When compared to pristine TiO2, the RE-doped TiO2-based PEC device exhibits higher photocurrent densities with additional sensitizers like CdS quantum dots (Qds) and N719 ruthenium dye molecules. As illustrated in Fig. 7(a and c), these sensitized photoanodes' photocurrent densities (Jph) increased dramatically. Notably, RE-codoped TiO2 showed better Jph than pristine TiO2 photoanode-based PEC devices. The (Er & Nd)-codoped TiO2/CdS-based PEC device demonstrates a Jph of ∼2.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is about 50% higher than that of the TiO2/CdS PEC device (Jph: ∼1.5 mA cm−2). Similarly, the ruthenium dye-sensitized RE-codoped photoanode demonstrated a 50% increase in performance compared to pristine TiO2.

Additionally, as shown in Fig. 7(b and d), the predicted photon-to-current efficiency is significantly greater with RE-codoped TiO2/sensitizers. The sensitizers of QdS and N719 dye molecules contain the photoanode's effective ohmic contact. It contributes to the enhancement of exciton generation/separation and injection rates. Nonetheless, the nanoporous photoanode composed of Er(0.3)·Nd(0.1)–TiO2 has a higher dye loading capacity than pristine TiO2 due to its higher specific surface area. It is proved that the optimal RE-codoped TiO2 layer can generate excitons and act as an electron transport layer (ETL). Table 7 compares the results of PEC cells with various sensitized TiO2 photoanodes. The current work yielded superior results compared to earlier research. This study's primary objective is to demonstrate the enhancement of PEC and PV devices by employing a RE-modified TiO2 photoanode.

3.6. Photovoltaic properties
To examine the effect of RE-dopants on photovoltaic conversion efficiency, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was constructed with the optimised RE-doped TiO2 photoanodes. The corresponding DSSC diagram is illustrated in Fig. 8(b). The characteristic J–V measurements of the DSSC were performed under one sun irradiation (100 mW cm−2), shown in Fig. 8(a). In contrast, the TiO2 photoanode-based DSSC was reported with a significant photo-conversion efficiency (PCE) of η%: 5.4% with a Voc of 0.7 V and Jsc of 13.5 mA cm−2. The photovoltaic characteristics were enhanced with the RE-doped TiO2 compared to the pristine TiO2 photoanode. Table 8 summarises the associated parameters. Voc, as well as Jsc, was observed to improve by the RE-doped TiO2 photoanode. In general, Voc denotes the difference in potential between the electrolyte redox couple potential and the semiconductor's Fermi energy level. The Fermi level gained different properties depending on the dopant type. The improved Voc can be rationalized by the broadened band structure of the (Er:Nd)–TiO2 lattice, evidenced in the bandgap calculations. Additionally, it was discovered that Jsc increased from 13.5 mA cm−2 to 16.4 mA cm−2. As a result of the BET study, it is well understood that RE-doped TiO2 has a large surface/volume ratio, which results in enhanced dye adsorption. As a result, the photocurrent should increase with the RE-doped TiO2 photoanode-based DSSC. Thus, the overall improvement in the Jsc and Voc significantly improved the PCE% (6.5%) for the Er(0.2)–Nd(0.4) codoped TiO2.

Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements to be evidence for the improved photocurrent densities. IPCE% measurements were performed for the pristine TiO2 and RE-doped/codoped TiO2 photoanode-based DSSC device. In the case of the DSSC with the TiO2 photoanode, the DSSC photoresponse covered the entire wavelength range (350 nm to 750 nm), with a maximum IPCE of 44% at 530 nm, presented in Fig. 8(c). It was observed that the photoresponse increased up to 50% for the RE-doped TiO2-based DSSC. Specifically, Er:Nd-codoped TiO2 had the most excellent IPCE value (55%). To detect these significantly improved changes in photoresponse, we evaluated the relative changes in the IPCE spectra ((ΔIPCE/IPCE) × 100%) for Er-doped TiO2, Nd-doped TiO2, and (Er:Nd) codoped TiO2 with respect to pristine TiO2 as shown in Fig. 8(d). The enhancement ratio ((ΔIPCE/IPCE) × 100%) is defined as ((IPCE% of RE-doped TiO2–IPCE% of TiO2)/(IPCE% of TiO2)) × 100%. The relative photoresponse was spread over a range of 350 nm to 650 nm, with an intense peak at 410 nm. The enhancement in the relative photoresponse is attributable to the increased dye adsorption.
4. Conclusion
This work has established a systematic analysis of the trap-assisted luminescence properties of RE-ion codoped TiO2 compositions and their influences on the photon-to-current efficiency generation through PEC water splitting. Er3+ and Nd3+ ions were chosen as dopants into the TiO2 lattice, and pulverized by a solid state-grinding technique. The XRD evidenced the initial conformation of proper doping of RE-ions into the TiO2 lattice. Raman modes revealed the formation of RE-O bonds in the TiO2. As estimated from the XRD analysis, TEM images and SEAD patterns conformed to the reduced particle size values and the tetragonal structures. Importantly, it demonstrated a novel way of understanding the optical recombination analysis among the energy states of RE-ions through PL and TrPL studies. The estimated longer lifetime of RE-codoped TiO2 samples reveals the slow recombination, suggesting the effective charge transportation abilities. As estimated the RE-ion codoped TiO2 photoanode-based PEC device showed enriched results. In particular, the Er0.003Nd0.001Ti0.996O2 photoanode showed the higher photo-current density of Jph: 16 μA cm−2 than pristine TiO2 (Jph: 0.7 μA cm−2). Besides, the improved Jph with the Cds QDs and N719 dye sanitizers suggests that the RE-doped TiO2 can act as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL). Similarly, the photo-conversion efficiency of the DSSC was found to be enhanced with the same RE-co-doped TiO2 photoanode.
