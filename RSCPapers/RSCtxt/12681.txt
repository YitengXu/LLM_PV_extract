    , Accepted 5th November 2018First published on 6th November 2018AbstractPanchromatic ternary organic solar cells with photoresponses beyond 1000 nm were fabricated using low-bandgap polymer PTB7-Th as a donor and ultralow-bandgap F8IC and mid-bandgap IDT-2BR as nonfullerene acceptors. A ternary device with 20% IDT-2BR content in acceptors exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 12.1%, higher than that of its parent binary devices based on PTB7-Th/F8IC (10.3%) and PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR (7.31%). The third component IDT-2BR simultaneously improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the PTB7-Th/F8IC blend. The voltage loss is reduced by the smaller energy offset for charge separation and new charge transport pathway for less charge recombination. Complementary light absorption is beneficial for enhanced JSC. Co-existence of face-on molecular packing of F8IC and IDT-2BR leads to higher mobilities and more balanced charge transport, which contribute to the improved FF.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) based on interpenetrating networks of the electron donor and acceptor are becoming one of the potential alternatives to traditional silicon-based solar cells, since they present some merits, such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, light semitransparency and easy solution processing.1–7 Drawbacks of fullerene acceptors, such as poor absorption in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions, limited tunability of electronic properties, and thermal and photochemical instability, impose constraints on sustainable development of this field.8,9 In 2015, we proposed a new concept termed “fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA)” and developed a class of high-performance nonfullerene acceptors, exemplified by the benchmark molecule, 3,9-bis(2-methylene-3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC).10 Invention of the ITIC family is advancing the entire field of OSCs to a new level;11–19 power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) were previously limited to ∼11–12%, and now based upon FREAs, PCEs around 13–14% are being achieved for single-junction OSCs20–28 and 15–17% for tandem OSCs.29,30
To realize high short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE, low-bandgap (LBG) donors were synthesized.31,32 In order to pair with LBG donors, ultralow-bandgap (UBG) FREAs with an optical bandgap (Eg) of less than 1.3 eV were designed and synthesized, which achieved the highest PCEs of 10–12% with impressive JSC values over 24 mA cm−2 in single-junction OSCs.33–37 However, because of the relatively low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the UBG acceptors and relatively high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of LBG donors, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of these OSCs based on LBG donor/UBG acceptor blends is generally low.38,39 According to the equation VOC = (Eg − Eloss)/q,40 where Eloss is the energy loss in devices and q is the elementary charge, VOC is restricted by the following factors: (i) a lower Eg is accompanied by lower VOC; (ii) further extending the photoresponse into the NIR region usually causes large Eloss,41 since large energy offset of the HOMO or LUMO energy levels of the donor/acceptor (D/A) increases charge separation related energy loss due to vibration relaxation.42,43 On the other hand, LBG donor/UBG acceptor blends have weak absorption at short wavelengths, limiting panchromatic absorption.
We previously reported a UBG FREA, F8IC (Fig. 1a),35 which exhibited a very high JSC of >25 mA cm−2 but a low VOC of 0.64 V and a moderate PCE of <11%, when blended with a widely used LBG polymer donor, PTB7-Th.44 Inspired by recent reports of OSCs based on ternary blends,45–56 to enhance the performance of this binary blend, a mid-bandgap (MBG) FREA, IDT-2BR,57 was introduced as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs with one polymer donor/two nonfullerene acceptors based on the following considerations: (1) IDT-2BR can enhance absorption in the short-wavelength region to realize panchromatic absorption and increase JSC; (2) IDT-2BR has a higher LUMO energy level relative to F8IC, which can reduce the energy offset between the donor and acceptor and energy loss and increase VOC. Indeed, IDT-2BR simultaneously improves the JSC, VOC and fill factor (FF) of the OSCs, leading to 17% and 65% improvement in PCE relative to the parent binary blends.

Results and discussion
Optical and electronic properties
IDT-2BR, PTB7-Th and F8IC thin solid films exhibit strong absorption in ca. 500–700, 550–750 and 650–950 nm, respectively (Fig. 1b), which are complementary to form panchromatic absorption (Fig. S1†). From cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S2†), the HOMO energy levels of PTB7-Th, F8IC and IDT-2BR were estimated to be −5.20, −5.43 and −5.52 eV, while the LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.59, −4.00 and −3.69 eV, respectively (Fig. 1c). The higher-lying LUMO energy level of IDT-2BR would result in higher VOC in ternary OSCs.
The steady photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of IDT-2BR overlaps with absorption spectrum of F8IC (Fig. S3a†), suggesting the possibility of energy transfer from IDT-2BR to F8IC.58,59 To confirm this process, PL spectra of the F8IC neat film and F8IC/IDT-2BR (8/2, w/w) blend film were measured under excitation at 647 nm (Fig. S3b†). The neat IDT-2BR and F8IC films exhibit emission peaks at ∼730 nm and ∼980 nm, respectively. The emission peak of the F8IC/IDT-2BR blend film is the same as that of the F8IC film, but the emission intensity of the blend is stronger than that of the pure F8IC film, and the emission peak of IDT-2BR disappears, indicating energy transfer from IDT-2BR to F8IC. As shown in Fig. S3c,† the PL of the PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR binary blend decreases by 85% relative to that of pure PTB7-Th. As for PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR blends, the PL is completely quenched, indicating effective charge transfer between PTB7-Th and F8IC or F8IC/IDT-2BR. In the PTB7-Th/F8IC binary device, excitons are dissociated into free charges at the D/A interface and holes are transported through the donor pathway and electrons are transported through the acceptor pathway. In the PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR ternary device, in addition to the PTB7-Th/F8IC interface, excitons can also be dissociated at the PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR interface. Meanwhile, another possible channel to generate charges associated with the PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR interface can be formed due to energy transfer from IDT-2BR to F8IC.
Photovoltaic properties
OSCs based on PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR binary blends as well as the PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR ternary blend were fabricated with an inverted sandwich structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) glass/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag. The weight ratio of donor/acceptors is 1/1.7 and the content of IDT-2BR in acceptors changes from 0, 10, 20, 30, 50 to 100 wt% (Table S1†). Diphenyl ether (DPE) was used as an additive to improve the performance of devices; the optimized volume ratio of DPE in chloroform is 0.5% (v/v) (Table S1†). Table 1 summarizes the best and average photovoltaic characteristics of the optimized devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2, are shown in Fig. 2a. The PTB7-Th/F8IC device exhibits a PCE of 10.3% with a high JSC of 24.6 mA cm−2 owing to the broad and strong absorption of PTB7-Th/F8IC. However, a low VOC of 0.646 V with an energy loss of 0.626 eV (Eloss = Eg − qVOC = 1.272 − 0.646 = 0.626 eV) restricts the overall device performance. The PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR device yields a PCE of 7.31%, with an extremely high VOC of 1.05 V, a low JSC of 12.9 mA cm−2 and a low FF of 54.3%. For devices based on PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR ternary blends, with increasing weight ratio of IDT-2BR, VOC monotonically increases instead of pinning to the LUMO energy level of F8IC, while the JSC and FF increase first and then decrease (Fig. S4 and S5†). The optimized ternary device (20 wt% IDT-2BR in acceptors) affords a VOC of 0.687 V, a JSC of 25.1 mA cm−2, a FF of 69.9%, and a PCE of 12.1%. Relative to the PTB7-Th/F8IC binary blend, the PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR ternary blend achieves simultaneous improvement in the JSC, VOC and FF. Eloss is reduced from 0.626 eV to 0.585 eV after addition of IDT-2BR. The higher LUMO energy level of IDT-2BR and new charge transport channel formed with energy transfer reduce the energy loss of charge separation.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all optimized binary and ternary devices are shown in Fig. 2b. For the PTB7-Th/F8IC device, the EQE value between 700 and 800 nm reaches 80%, due to the strong absorption of F8IC in the NIR region. For the PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR device, the EQE value between 300 and 450 nm is relatively high benefitting from the absorption of IDT-2BR. The EQE of the ternary OSC is pretty high in the whole region. The EQE in the region of 300–550 nm is enhanced, while the EQE between 700 and 950 nm is slightly decreased relative to that of the PTB7-Th/F8IC blend owing to the reduced content of F8IC.
We investigated the air stability of binary and ternary devices under air conditions without encapsulation (Fig. S6a†). The PCE of the PTB7-Th/F8IC device retained 50% of the initial value, while the ternary device retained 85% after storage for 50 days. The heat stability tests were carried out at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S6b†). The PTB7-Th/F8IC binary device retains 60% of its original PCE, while the PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR device retains 78% after heating for 120 min. Clearly, IDT-2BR enhances device stability.
Device physics
The charge generation and extraction behavior in active layers were studied by measuring photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2c). The saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is limited by the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax), which is calculated using the equation of Jsat = qLGmax, where q is the elementary charge and L is the thickness of the active layer (ca. 100 nm).60 The Gmax values of the optimized PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR devices are 1.50 × 1028 m−3 s−1 and 1.64 × 1028 m−3 s−1 respectively, indicating that the ternary OSCs have more efficient exciton generation. Jph/Jsat is defined as the charge dissociation probability (P(E, T)). Under short-circuit conditions, the P(E, T) values for the optimized PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR, PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR devices are 93.2%, 95.2% and 99.2%, respectively, suggesting more efficient exciton dissociation in ternary devices.
We measured the relationship between JSC and light intensity (Plight). The JSC follows a power-law relationship with Plight, JSC ∝ Plightα,61 where when α reaches 1, it means that all the charges have been collected by electrodes and no bimolecular recombination exists. The α value is 0.946, 0.960 and 0.970 for PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR, PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR devices, respectively (Fig. 2d). After adding the third component IDT-2BR, more charges have been collected by the electrode effectively with less bimolecular recombination, which is consistent with less non-radiative VOC losses in ternary cells.
The charge mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC)62 method (Table S2, Fig. S7†). For binary blends, PTB7-Th/F8IC exhibits a hole mobility (μh) of 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility (μe) of 8.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 5.4); PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR exhibits a μh of 1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.3). The higher charge mobility is responsible for the higher FF of binary devices based on PTB7-Th/F8IC. The ternary blend exhibits a μh of 1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 6.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.7). The higher charge mobility and more balanced charge transport are beneficial for less charge recombination, less non-radiative energy losses and higher FFs in PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR devices.
Morphology characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the surface morphology of the PTB7-Th/F8IC, PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR films (Fig. S8†). All blend films have smooth surface morphology, with similar root-mean-square roughnesses varying from 1.20 nm to 1.29 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of PTB7-Th/F8IC and PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR films are also similar (Fig. S9†).
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were carried out to reveal the molecular packing and crystallinity information of the films.63 The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding intensity profiles of the binary and ternary blend films are presented in Fig. 3. The scattering patterns of the pure acceptor films are shown in Fig. S10.† The pure IDT-2BR film shows no obvious scattering peak, demonstrating an amorphous feature. The pure F8IC film shows low crystallinity with a preferential face-on orientation indicated by the lamellar peak along the qr axis (q = 0.41 Å−1, d = 15.3 Å) and the π–π peak along the qz axis (q = 1.75 Å−1, d = 3.59 Å). The pure PTB7-Th film was reported to be preferentially face-on oriented with the lamellar peak located at qr = 0.26 Å−1 and the π–π peak at qz = 1.59 Å−1.64 For the PTB7-Th/F8IC blend film, the lamellar peak at qr = 0.26 Å−1 and the π–π peak at qz = 1.78 Å−1 are attributed to the scattering from face-on oriented PTB7-Th and F8IC crystalline domains, respectively. The PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR film exhibits relatively lower crystallinity, showing only a weak lamellar peak at qr = 0.30 Å−1 (d = 21.7 Å), which possibly originated from PTB7-Th. This is consistent with the observed lower carrier mobility and device performance. For the ternary PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR blend film, there exist two lamellar peaks at qr = 0.26 Å−1 and 0.43 Å−1, indicating the co-existence of face-on oriented PTB7-Th and F8IC crystallites. Furthermore, two π–π peaks are observed at qz = 1.45 Å−1 (d = 4.33 Å) and 1.84 Å−1 (d = 3.41 Å). The latter could be attributed to the tighter π–π stacking of F8IC. The former couldn't be attributed to the π–π stacking of PTB7-Th due to a large mismatch of the lattice constant. Therefore, it is more likely due to the formation of IDT-2BR crystallites. Together, the improved crystallinity and face-on ordering of both F8IC and IDT-2BR positively correlate with the increased electron mobility and most balanced carrier mobility.

Two-dimensional grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (2D GISAXS) patterns and intensity profiles along the in-plane direction of the pure and blended films are presented in Fig. S11† and 3c to estimate the nano-scale phase separation information. We adopt the Debye–Anderson–Brumberger (DAB) model and a fractal-like network model to account for the scattering contribution from intermixing amorphous phases and acceptor domains, respectively.65 The correlation lengths of the intermixing phase are 20.2, 48.5 and 33.2 nm for PTB7-Th/F8IC, PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR, and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR, respectively. The acceptor phase domain sizes are fitted to be 25.6, 37.0 and 57.0 nm for PTB7-Th/F8IC, PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR and PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR blend films, respectively. The increase of acceptor domain size in the ternary film is likely due to the crystallinity growth of IDT-2BR, which has relatively stronger scattering than F8IC.
Conclusion
In summary, we fabricate nonfullerene ternary polymer solar cells, combining UBG and MBG nonfullerene acceptors to simultaneously improve VOC and JSC. The ternary OSCs based on PTB7-Th/F8IC/IDT-2BR yield a PCE of 12.1%, which is higher than those of PTB7-Th/IDT-2BR (7.31%) and PTB7-Th/F8IC (10.3%) binary blends. The PCE of 12.1% is even higher than that reported for other ternary blends based on PTB7-Th/nonfullerene acceptor/IDT-2BR (10–11%).47,52 The third component IDT-2BR increases the VOC from 0.646 V to 0.687 V, while reducing the energy loss from 0.626 eV to 0.585 eV in the PTB7-Th/F8IC binary blend. The higher LUMO energy level of IDT-2BR provides another possible electron transport pathway, which is beneficial for exciton separation and reduces energy loss of charge transfer. The improved JSC is benefited from complementary light absorption of the two acceptors, especially in the region of 300–400 nm from IDT-2BR. The formation of face-on molecular packing of IDT-2BR in ternary blends improves crystallization, which contributes to higher and more balanced carrier transport ability and higher FFs.
