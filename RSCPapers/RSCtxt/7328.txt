    , Accepted 4th August 2017First published on 4th August 2017AbstractPerylenediimide (PDI) possesses intense absorption, a low-lying energy level, and a high electron mobility. However, its highly planar conformation and thus strong intermolecular π–π stacking prevents its application as an electron acceptor used in efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we report a structurally non-planar molecule TRIP-PDI3, in which a rigid and shape-persistent triptycene (TRIP) unit is employed as a central unit to collect three PDI arms at the periphery. As an electron acceptor, TRIP-PDI3 exhibits a low-lying LUMO energy level of −3.81 eV similar to that of conventional PCBM, but with an intensive light absorption in the range of 450–600 nm. BHJ OSCs were fabricated using TRIP-PDI as an electron acceptor and a low band gap polymer PBDT-TS1 as an electron donor, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.53%. The result demonstrates that TRIP is a promising building block for the construction of structurally non-planar PDI derivatives as non-fullerene (NF) electron acceptors for efficient OSCs.
Introduction
As a promising cell pattern, solution-processed polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn extensive attention owing to their unique advantages, such as light weight, roll-to-roll printing techniques, ease of fabrication on a large scale, feasibility of flexible devices, and low cost.1–4 A typical BHJ OSC comprises a narrow band gap polymer donor and a fullerene derivative acceptor (e.g. [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM) with power conversion efficiencies of 9–11% for single-junction devices,5–7 where fullerene derivatives play a central role as electron acceptors due to their high electron affinity and electron mobility, isotropic charge transport, and favorable nanoscale network forming behaviors.8–10 Although fullerene derivatives have been successfully employed as electron acceptors in the OSCs, they are not ideal candidates for real applications because of their poor photochemical stability in air, weak absorption of visible light, limited energy level variability, and high production costs.11
In recent years, a series of electron-withdrawing building blocks, such as rylene diimides,12–25 diketopyrrolopyrrole,26–31 benzothiadiazole,32–35 functionalized isoindigo,36,37 BODIPYs,38 indaceno[2,1-b:6,5-b′]dithiophene39–42 and other electron-withdrawing building blocks,43–46 have been employed for the design and synthesis of non-fullerene (NF) acceptors. Among them, perylenediimide (PDI) is a most promising building block for NF electron acceptors.47 However, its highly planar conformation and thus strong intermolecular π–π stacking prevents its application as an electron acceptor used in efficient BHJ OSCs. Considering this issue, a series of PDI dimers, trimers and tetramers were developed through connecting PDI units with a single bond48 to phenyl unit,49,50 thiophene unit,50 selenophene unit,51 bithiothene unit,50 9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene] unit,52 indaceno dithiophene unit,53 or other aromatic spaces.54 Dependent on the linkage units used, all of these PDI derivatives hold different degree of twisted configuration, which has been proven to reduce their aggregation and create nano-sized phase domains in the blending layer of OSCs. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new linkages to create non-planar PDI derivatives for highly efficient OSCs.
Triptycene and its derivatives are a class of rigid and shape-persistent organic frameworks, containing three aromatic rings attached to a central bridgehead motif.55 They have been found to have interesting electrochemical and photochemical properties, unique reactivities, and potential pharmaceutical applications.56 Moreover, they have been found widespread use as building blocks in supramolecular and materials chemistry,57 such as in the synthesis of conjugated polymers,58 molecular rotors59 and cage molecules.60 Any two of the three phenyl rings in the triptycene backbone remain at a huge dihedral angle at 120 degree, which implies that the combination of triptycene and PDI could create NF electron acceptors used for OSCs with rigid and high twist structures in space. Herein, we present a new molecular design towards a high performance PDI acceptor by incorporating a triptycene core and three PDI moieties at the periphery. The target molecular TRIP-PDI3 (Fig. 1) was synthesized via a simple two-step reaction process as shown in Scheme 1. Compared with PDI, TRIP-PDI3 can suppress the intrinsic and strong crystallization of PDI units while maintaining good π–π interactions between the adjacent molecules, which could favor efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Besides, the energy levels of TRIP-PDI3, especially the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are similar to that of PC61BM, which allows TRIP-PDI3 to match the narrow band-gap polymer donors in energy, such as PBDT-TS1.61 With PBDT-TS1 as the donor and TRIP-PDI3 as the acceptor, BHJ OSCs were fabricated, yielding a high performance 4.53% measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. During the re-submitting of this article, Sun et al. also reported the synthesis and use of a triptycene core-PDI derivative as an electron acceptor in organic acceptor in organic solar cells.62 These results suggest that triptycene cored PDI derivatives show promising potential for OSCs as NF acceptors.

Fabrication of the OPV devices
The OPV devices were fabricated through the reported procedure,64 and they have the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-TS1:TRIP-PDI3/PFN-Br/Al. The fabrication processes were performed under the following procedures: ITO glasses were cleaned by using the surfactant scrub, washed with water, acetone and isopropanol, successively. Then UV-ozone treatment was performed on the ITO surface for 15 minutes. About 35 nm thick of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the ITO glasses, and the ITO substrates were dried in an oven at 150 °C for 15 min. The solution of PBDT-TS1/TRIP-PDI3 (10 mg mL−1, based on the polymer weight concentration) in chlorobenzene was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then a small amount of methanol was spin-coated on the active layer to remove the residual additives, following by spin-coating a PFN-Br layer. Under high vacuum, about 80 nm of Al were deposited onto the interface layer, giving an effective cell area of 4.15 mm2. Except for the spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS, the other processes were carried out in a glovebox of nitrogen atmosphere.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations
The synthesis route to TRIP-PDI3 is shown in Scheme 1. TRIP-PDI3 was easily obtained through a simple two-step palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction between three brominated PDI motifs (PDI-Br) and a tri-boric ester functionalized triptycene backbone (TRIP-3B), and TRIP-3B was synthesized by reacting tri-brominated triptycene (TRIP-3Br) with bis(pinacolato)diboron under palladium-catalyzed conditions. The detailed synthesis procedure is presented in the Experimental section. The thermal properties of TRIP-PDI3 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TRIP-PDI3 shows a decomposition temperature of about 375 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere at 5% weight loss, indicating the good thermolability of this compound (Fig. 2). The DSC study illustrates that TRIP-PDI3 shows an obscure melt point at 190 °C during the heating process and a crystallization peak at 159 °C during the cooling process. Much lower crystallization heat than that of PDI indicates that the strong π–π stacking tendency of PDI motif has been effectively suppressed in TRIP-PDI3 (ESI,† Fig. S1).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of TRIP-PDI3 and PBDT-TS1, their blend in dilute chlorobenzene (CB) solution, and corresponding films are shown in Fig. 3a. The absorption of TRIP-PDI3 is mainly located in the 400–600 nm region with a high extinction coefficient of 0.95 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 543 nm. The absorption beyond 500 nm is attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer, and absorption between 300 and 500 nm results from localized π–π* transitions. The absorption edge of TRIP-PDI3 is found to be 610 nm, and the optical band gap is calculated to be 2.03 eV. Whether in solution (blue line) or on film (green line), absorption of the blend of TRIP-PDI3 and PBDT-TS1 can perfectly cover the whole visible light region of 300–800 nm, which is mainly ascribed to the complementary absorption range of 450–800 nm (red line) of the donor polymer PBDT-TS1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammogram (DPV) measurements were employed to determine the electrochemical property of TRIP-PDI3, as shown in Fig. 3b. TRIP-PDI3 shows quasi-reversible redox processes both in the positive and negative potential range. The oxidation potentials were attributed to the oxidation processes of the triptycene core, whereas the reduction potentials were ascribed to the reduction processes of the PDI units. The onset of the reduction potential and the onset of the oxidation potential (versus Fc+/Fc) are found to be −0.99 and 1.17 V from the DPV curves. The corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are calculated to be −3.81 and −5.97 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgap of TRIP-PDI3 is determined to be 2.16 eV, which agrees with the optical bandgap, and the energy levels of PCBM and PBDT-TS1 are also summarized in Table 1 for comparison. The energy offset between of LUMOPBDT-TS1 (−3.52 eV) and LUMOTRIP-PDI3 (−3.81 eV) is near to 0.30 eV (Fig. 5a), which can provide enough drive force for the exciton dissociation.

To gain insight into the molecular geometry of TRIP-PDI3, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G basic set level are carried out. To simplify the calculation process, the predominant 2,6,14-trisubstituted isomer was chosen as a model for DFT simulation.63 Its optimized ground state molecular structures are presented in Fig. 4. We can see the molecule features a high twist through the broken coplanarity and symmetry. From the top view, two PDI units can be found tilted with the benzene ring of the TRIP motif clockwise, while the other one is anti-clockwise. The dihedral angle between the TRIP benzene ring and adjacent PDI chromophore is calculated to be 50.2°; meanwhile, the neighboring two PDI units maintain a high dihedral angle of 67.9°. Besides, the size of the molecular TRIP-PDI3 could be obtained, with a 2.32 nm diameter from the side view. Obviously, the conclusion would be that a highly crowded and twisted configuration in such a small space is expected to be beneficial to controlling the aggregates area of the solid state at the molecular level, which is probable effective to enhancing the performance of the OSCs.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the performance of TRIP-PDI3 as an electron acceptor, we fabricated the OSC with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-TS1:TRIP-PDI3/PFN-Br/Al. The energy level diagram and OSC structure are present in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The J–V curves of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 5c, and the related performance parameters, such as Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, are listed in Table 2. Initially, the weight ratios of donor/acceptor (D/A) were considered during the device fabrication with the ratio varied from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5 and the spin-cast speed from 1000 to 2000 rpm. As shown in Table S1, the best result was achieved for the device with the D/A ratio of 1:1 and the cast speed at 1500 rpm, with a PCE of 4.11% (a Voc of 0.98 V, a Jsc of 9.77 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.43). For further improving the efficiency, four additives (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO; 1-chloronaphthalene, CN; N-methyl pyrrolidone, NMP; and diphenyl ether, DPE) with different amounts were used in the process of device fabrication. As shown in Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†), the optimized performance was obtained for the device with 0.5% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). At this condition, TRIP-PDI3 based OSC achieved the highest PCE of 4.53% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 10.26 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.46. The improvement of efficiency was mainly attributed to the increase in FF. Thus, we guess that DIO as an additive can optimize the morphology of the BHJ film to some degree. Other treatments, such as using other additives or changing the thermal annealing temperature, could be useful to further optimize the device performance.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are measured for four devices with different D/A ratios, as shown in Fig. 5d. Three intense photovoltaic response regions (300–400 nm, 500–600 nm and 600–800 nm) are found in the EQE curves, and the maximum EQE value is found to be 48% for the device with D/A ratio at 1:1 and further treated by 0.5% DIO. Additionally, the shapes of the EQE curves are similar to that of the blend absorption curve. Thus excitons generated from both PBDT-TS1 and TRIP-PDI3 can be effectively dissociated to contribute to the enhancement of the photocurrent.
Charge carrier mobility of the active layers
The charge carrier mobility of the blend PBDT-TS1/TRIP-PDI3 film is determined by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The structure of hole-only and electron-only devices are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDT-TS1:TRIP-PDI3/Au and ITO/ZnO/PBDT-TS1:TRIP-PDI3/Al, respectively. The J0.5–V curves of the devices are available in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). The hole mobility is calculated to be 6.20 × 10−5 V−1 S−1, while the electron mobilities are observed to be 3.34 × 10−6 for TRIP-PDI3 and 1.84 × 10−6 V−1 S−1 for the PBDT-TS1:TRIP-PDI3 blend film.
Morphology study
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted to study the influence of the additives on phase separation features of the blend films processed by the optimal conditions for fabricating OSC devices. Fig. 6a and b show the AFM topographies of the D/A blends without additive and with 0.5% DIO as additive, and the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the film with DIO is 0.99 nm, which is higher than that of the film without additive. The AFM phase images are listed in Fig. 6c and d. It can be found that although the aggregation sizes of the two phase picture are similar, the contrast of the two phases with additive is higher than that of the film without additive. The AFM images of the blend films with other additives can be available in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

According to the AFM measurements, we can conclude that the adding of additive can enhance the D/A phase separation without affecting the aggregation size.
Conclusions
In summary, a structurally non-planar perylenediimide derivative (TRIP-PDI3), a rigid and shape-persistent triptycene (TRIP) unit decorated by three PDI arms at the periphery, was designed, synthesized and characterized. As a non-fullerene (NF) electron acceptor, TRIP-PDI3 possessed good thermal stability and strong absorption with high extinction coefficients in the range of 400–600 nm. TRIP-PDI3 based BHJ solar cells were fabricated in combination with a narrow bandgap polymer PBDT-TS1 as an electron donor, exhibiting a PCE of 4.53% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 10.26 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.46. The results indicate the potential of the combination of triptycene and PDI moieties as a promising NF acceptor for efficient BHJ solar cells.
