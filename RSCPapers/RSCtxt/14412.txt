    , Accepted 9th January 2012First published on 15th February 2012AbstractVery large area, uniform TiO2@carbon composite nanofibers were easily prepared by thermal pyrolysis and oxidization of electrospun titanium(IV) isopropoxide/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers in argon. The composite nanostructures exhibit the unique feature of having TiO2 nanocrystals encapsulated inside a porous carbon matrix. The unique orderly-bonded nanostructure, porous characteristics, and highly conductive carbon matrix favour excellent electrochemical performance of the TiO2@carbon nanofiber electrode. The TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers exhibited highly reversible capacity of 206 mAh g−1 up to 100 cycles at current density of 30 mA g−1 and excellent cycling stability, indicating that the composite is a promising anode candidate for Li-ion batteries.
Introduction

Titanium oxide, as one of the most studied semiconducting metal oxides, has attracted special attention due to its wide potential application in many fields, such as photocatalysis,1–7 sensors,8,9 solar cells,10–13lithium-ion batteries,14–17etc. Nevertheless, especially in lithium-ion battery (LIB) applications, of the four common polymorphs of TiO2: rutile, anatase, brookite, and TiO2(B),18 anatase TiO2 has been investigated longest as a prospective electrode material because of its special crystal structure with a tetragonal body-centered space groupI41/1md, and the TiO6 octahedra sharing two adjacent edges with two other octahedra.19,20 This special three-dimensional (3D) architecture contains many open channels which facilitate the insertion/extraction of Li+ during discharge/charge.
Recently, a variety of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanomaterials, such as nanotubes,16,18nanowires,21,22 and nanorods,23 have been prepared and used as electrode materials in lithium ion batteries because of the shorter path for Li+ transport and the higher surface area, which result in more side reactions with the electrolyte15 than for bulk TiO2. However, there are still some obstacles to their practical application in lithium ion batteries, mainly owing to the low lithium ion and electronic conductivity of 1D TiO2 nanomaterials (∼10−12 S cm−1).24 Therefore, various strategies to improve the lithium ion and electronic conductivity of TiO2 nanomaterials, such as decoration with high conductivity materials, e.g., Ag nanoparticles,18 or dispersion of such nanoparticles into the carbon matrix,24,25 have been reported. Furthermore, a way to improve the electrochemical lithium storage properties of 1D TiO2 nanomaterials has been suggested, which is to enhance the porosity and surface area by forming mesopores or nanocavities,26 and is possible due to the much shorter paths for Li+ transport and larger interior surface area. Until now, there have been many challenges to synthesize 1D TiO2 nanomaterials with mesopores or nanocavities.

Electrospinning is a simple method of forming continuous 1D nanofibers under electrostatic force of the charges on the surface of a liquid droplet in a sufficiently high electric field, which is applied between the capillary nozzle and the metal collector.27,28 Herein, a relatively simple and low-cost approach to prepare TiO2@carbon composite nanofibers by a combination of electrospinning and subsequent thermal treatments is presented. As well as combining the advantages of TiO2 nanoparticles and carbon matrices, these TiO2@carbon nanofibers have the unique advantages of porosity, one-dimensional nanostructure, and large surface-to-volume ratio. The TiO2@carbon nanofibers have been investigated in a preliminary way for their potential use as an anode material for lithium ion batteries and for this application have exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate capability.
Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2@carbon composite nanofibers
The procedures for preparing the electrospinning solution are similar to those described previously.29–31 Simply, 0.7 g polyacrylonitrile (PAN, MW = 150000, Aldrich) was dissolved in 5.3 g N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Aldrich) at 80 °C with vigorous stirring for 2 h (solution No. 1). Then, 1.20 g titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) was mixed with 2.8 g anhydrous ethanol (solution No. 2). Afterwards, the No. 2 solution was added dropwise to the No. 1 solution at 80 °C with vigorous stirring. The mixed solution was then stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The polymer solution was transferred into a 10 ml syringe with a capillary tip (0.8 mm diameter). For spinning, the set-up was similar to that described previously.6,27,29–33 Typically, the collector was placed 9.5 cm from the spinneret to collect the nanofibers. A high voltage of 13.3 kV was applied between the spinneret and the collector by a direct-current power supply (DW-P303-5ACCD, Tianjin Dongwen High Voltage Power Supply Co., China.). The solution was pushed out of the spinneret by a syringe pump (TS2-60, Baoding Lange Constant Flux Pump Co., China) at the rate of 0.3 ml h−1. The collector was kept at 180 °C during electrospinning to evaporate the solvent. After spinning for more than 20 h, the nanofiber films were easily peeled off. The electrospun nanofibers were slowly decarbonized at 500 °C for 2 h in an air environment (heating rate: <1 °C min−1), or carbonized at 500 °C for 2 h in argon atmosphere (heating rate: <1 °C min−1), respectively. Finally, both a white film (TiO2 nanofibers) and a black film (TiO2@carbon nanofibers) were obtained.
Materials characterization

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the PAN and the samples were carried out with a TGA/DSC1 type instrument (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 1000 °C in air. The morphology was evaluated using a JEOL 7500FA field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigations were performed using a JEOL 2011F analytical electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 200 kV. The crystal structures of the TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2@carbon nanofibers were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase qualitative analysis (MMA, GBC, Australia) with Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV and 25 mA and 2θ range from 5° to 90° (0.02° resolution). The composition of the fibers was characterized using TGA and EDX analysis. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was carried out on the JEOL 7500FA analytical electron microscope as well. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on a VG Scientific ESCALAB 220IXL instrument using aluminum Kα X-ray radiation during XPS analysis.
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical properties were measured on electrodes prepared by compressing a mixture of as-prepared TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers or TiO2 nanofibers, carbon black (Super P, MMM, Belgium), and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) binder in a weight ratio of 70:15:15, mixing with suitable amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and pasting the slurry on copper foil. Pure lithium metal foil was used as the counter and reference electrode. The electrolyte was LiPF6 (1 M) in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 v/v; Merck KgaA, Germany). Coin cells were assembled in a high-purity argon-filled glove box (Mbraun, Unilab, Germany). The galvanostatic method was used to measure the electrochemical capacity of the electrodes at room temperature with a LAND-CT2001A instrument and a charge-discharge current density of 30 mA g−1. Additionally, the rate capability of electrode was investigated using a LAND-CT2001A instrument at different charge-discharge current densities of 25 mA g−1, 125 mA g−1, 250 mA g−1, 500 mA g−1, 1250 mA g−1, respectively. The cut-off potentials of the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofiber electrode for charge and discharge were set at 3.0 and 1.0 V versusLi+/Li, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a ChI660B electrochemical workstation.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared TiO2 nanofibers and TiO2@carbon nanofibers. As shown in Fig. 1, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of both samples reveal that the TiO2 both in the pure TiO2 nanofibers and in the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers is anatase TiO2 with a tetragonal structure (JCPDS 73-1764), although much sharper peaks appear in the TiO2 nanofiber sample (Fig. 1(a)) than in the TiO2@carbon nanofiber sample (Fig. 1(b)), which is possibly owing to the relatively smaller crystal size in the composite and the interference of the high carbon content in the TiO2@carbon nanofibers according to the TGA results (Fig. S1(a)†). The anatase TiO2 belongs to space groupI41/amd (141) with lattice parameters a = 3.776 Å and c = 9.468 Å. The heat treatment of titanium composite/PAN nanofibers (TCPNFs) at 500 °C in air or in argon successfully realized the conversion from TCPNFs into pure polycrystalline anatase TiO2 phase (Fig. S1(b)†, further confirmed by HRTEM image and SAED pattern below) and anatase TiO2@carbon composite nanofibers, respectively.

Fig. 2 and Fig. S2† show field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images of the as-collected titanium composite/PAN nanofibers, TiO2@carbon nanofibers, and TiO2 nanofibers. As depicted in Fig. 2(a), the FE-SEM images clearly reveal an overview of the uniform titanium composite/PAN nanofibers with diameters of 100–150 nm and lengths extending to several tens of millimetres. After calcination in argon at 500 °C for 2 h, the nanofibrous morphology is maintained (see Fig. S2(a–b)†, Fig. 2(a), Fig. 2(b), and insets), and the titanium composite/PAN nanofibers have been transformed to fully carbonized TiO2@carbon nanofibers with diameters of 80–120 nm. These consist of orderly bonded anatase TiO2 nanocrystals less than 10 nm in size, encapsulated in carbon matrices, which agrees well with the caculated average grain diameter (∼2.3 nm) according to Debye–Scherrer formula from the (101) plane XRD of TiO2. However, when calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h, as shown in Fig. S2(c–d)†, Fig. 2(c–d), and insets, the as-collected titanium composite/PAN nanofibers were transformed to uniform TiO2 nanofibers with diameters of 60–100 nm, consisting of orderly bonded pure anatase TiO2 nanoparticles less than 15 nm in size, which is in good agreement with the caculated average grain diameter (∼11.6 nm) according to Debye–Scherrer formula from the (101) plane XRD of TiO2. Thus, to some extent, the TiO2@carbon nanofibers can be viewed as an intermediate product in the preparation of pure TiO2 nanofibers, but with carbon filling between the TiO2 particles. In addition, many holes/voids were left between the bonded TiO2@carbon or TiO2 particles in the nanofibers, arising from the pyrolysis of PAN. Furthermore, some mesoporosities between nanofibers are shown Fig. S2†, Fig. 2(b), and Fig. 2(b–d) and insets. The holes/voids and mesoporosities formed in these nanofibers ensure a high electrode-electrolyte contact area in the hybrid nanofibers, so a large amount of lithium ions can be accommodated without any remarkable degradation of the structure during charge/discharge cycling, which is favorable to both lithium ion storage and Li+ diffusion.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations of the pyrolyzed TiO2@carbon and pure TiO2 nanofibers provides worthwhile structural and chemical information (Fig. 3). The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3(a)) clarify the crystal structure, as interplanar with spacing of approximately 0.36 nm between neighboring (101) planes of tetragonal TiO2, as these planes were parallel to the electron beam. Only a few crystals have revealed clear lattice fringes in HRTEM, while other areas without lattice fringes are present. These areas could be carbon-filled regions or crystals whose orientation are not parallel to the electron beam. The crystal size of TiO2 in these nanofibers is about 5−10 nm. Fig. 3(b) and Fig. S3(a)† demonstrate that TiO2@carbon nanofibers are composed of many nanoparticles bonded together to form a fibrous morphology, this is further confirmed by the corresponding selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3(b) inset) which reveals the fine microstructure of the TiO2@carbon nanofibers. The ring-shaped SAED pattern indicates that TiO2 encapsulated in the TiO2@carbon nanofibers is in polycrystalline form, similar to that reported previously.34 The obviously spotted diffraction rings from inside to outside can be indexed to the (101), (004), and (200) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively (Fig. 3(b) inset). When calcined in air, the pure TiO2 nanofiber sample in Fig. 3(c) displays the same crystal structure with the same interplanar spacing of approximately 0.36 nm between neighboring (101) planes of tetragonal TiO2, but with a crystal size of ∼10–15 nm, slightly larger than the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers, possibly due to carbon interference with the growth of TiO2 crystals in the hybrid nanofibers. Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S3(b)†display a similar polycrystalline form of these TiO2 nanofibers, which is further confirmed by the corresponding selected-area electronic diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3(d) inset), but only in that there are more obvious spotted diffraction rings. The rings from inside to outside can be indexed to the (101), (004), (200), and (105) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the XRD results described above. The TiO2@carbon nanofibers include mainly the elements Ti, O, and C (Fig. S3(c)†), while the pure TiO2 nanofibers are composed of the elements Ti and O (Fig. S3(d)†). The carbon content in the TiO2@carbon nanofibers is 34.48% according to the EDX spectra (Fig. S3(c)†), agreeing well with the TGA results (Fig. S1†).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the TiO2@carbon and pure TiO2 nanofibers was conducted from 0 to 1100 eV. Obvious C1s, O1s, and Ti2p peaks were detected, and their high-resolution spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a–e), respectively. The Ti2p spectrum (Fig. 4(a)) for the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers comprises two symmetrical peaks with binding energies (BEs) of 458.90 eV and 464.65 eV, which are attributable to Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2, respectively, and are slightly larger than those of the pure TiO2 nanofiber sample (Fig. 4(b)). The separation between these two peaks is 5.75 eV, slightly larger than the energy splitting reported for TiO235,36 and that of the pure TiO2 nanofibers. The cause is possibly that encapsulation of the TiO2 in the carbon matrix influences the BEs of Ti2p electrons. As shown in Fig. 4(c), the main portion of the response could come from TiO2, as evidenced by the O1s binding energy (BE) peak at ∼530.29 eV (Fig. 4(c)) and 529.91 eV(Fig. 4(d)),37 while the peak at 531.61 eV (Fig. 4(c)) and 531.26 eV (Fig. 4(d)) may be due to the OH− radical, adsorbed oxygen, or carbonyl.35,38 As for the high BE peak at 532.89 eV (Fig. 4(c)) and 532.23 eV (Fig. 4(d)), it possibly originates from absorbed H2O. Similarly, encapsulation of TiO2 in the carbon matrix possibly leads to the three fitted O1s peaks that are slightly larger for the TiO2@carbon nanofibers than for the pure TiO2 nanofibers. According to Fig. 4(e), the high resolution spectrum of the C1s region of as-prepared TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers can be fitted to four peaks, including the large peak at 285.01 eV attributed to un-oxidized graphitic carbon.38 The peak at 286.55 eV is attributed to disordered carbon or oxidant carbon, such as carbon in alcohols,35,38 which is in good accordance with the fitted O1s peaks. The remaining two small peaks at 288.05 eV and 289.24 eV possibly come from a trace amount of carboxyl in the hybrid sample.38 From a combination of the XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, and XPS results, it is concluded that TiO2 in these nanofibers exists in the form of polycrystalline TiO2. Each TiO2 particle is possibly one small crystal because of the low diffusion capability of TiO2 in the nanofibers at the pyrolysis temperature. In addition, many hole/void nanopores are formed between the bound TiO2 or TiO2@carbon particles in the nanofibers. This one-dimensional TiO2@carbon material would introduce unique advantages in lithium ion battery application,39 such as high conductivity due to encapsulation of the TiO2 nanocrystals in the high carbon content, improved Li+ and electrolyte transport in the nanofibers from the hole/void nanopores that exist between the bound TiO2@carbon particles in the nanofibers, and so on, all of which favor the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of the electrode as compared with pure TiO2.

The electrochemical performance of TiO2@carbon nanofibers in the lithium ion battery has been characterized by galvanostatic discharge-charge cycling and cyclic voltammetry, as shown in Fig. 5. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers from the first to the fifth cycle at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V were obtained and are presented in Fig. 5(a). The curves of the initial five cycles are different from the later ones, especially with respect to the subsequent gradual disappearance of some high voltage CV peaks, possibly owing to the gradual formation of an inactive solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of the active material, which is inclined to intercept reversible Li ion pathways in the discharge/charge processes. In the first cycle, the cathodic/anodic peak pair at 0.012 V and 0.124 V is attributed to lithium ion insertion into and extraction out of the carbon material, while another cathodic/anodic peak pair at around 0.69 V and 1.3 V suggest the decomposition of solvent, with decomposition products acting as a SEI on the surface of the active materials.40 There remain two obvious cathodic/anodic peak pairs at 1.40 V and 1.89 V, and 1.61 V and 2.06 V in the first cycle, although the two cathodic peaks merge and stabilize at 1.50 V and 1.89 V in subsequent cycles, which are probably attributable to lithium ion insertion into/extraction out of anatase TiO2. However, there is one unknown peak at 2.37 V in the first cycle. This peak at 2.37 V disappears in the next few cycles, and the corresponding reaction of this peak is still not clear. Further experiments such as in situ or ex situsynchrotron or Raman analysis, need to be conducted in order to understand this in future.

(d) Rate capabilities of TiO2 and TiO2@carbon electrodes at various currents. 
Galvanostatic discharge/charge experiments on the TiO2@carbon nanofiber electrodes were carried out in the voltage range of 3.0–1.0 V (versusLi/Li+) at a constant current density of approximately 30 mA g−1 up to 100 cycles. Fig. 5(b) presents the voltage profiles of a TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofiber electrode at the current density of 30 mA g−1. The first discharge and charge steps deliver a specific capacity of 220.8 and 217.1 mAh g−1, respectively, much higher than for pure TiO2 nanofiber electrode, i.e. 182.7 and 178.5 mAh g−1 (Fig. 5(c)). The initial coulombic efficiency of the TiO2@carbon nanofibers electrode is above 98.324%, slightly higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanofiber electrode (97.6%) and those of some reported pure TiO2 nanotube electrodes.16Fig. 5(c) shows the curves of discharge capacity versus cycle number for the TiO2@carbon nanofiber and pure TiO2 nanofiber electrodes at current density 30 mA g−1. The TiO2@carbon composite electrode exhibits excellent cyclic performance and a high reversible specific capacity of over 200 mAh g−1 in the first 50 cycles, and it maintains a reversible capacity after 100 cycles of approximately 206 mAh g−1 with high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, much higher than the specific capacity and coulombic efficiency of the pure TiO2 nanofiber electrode and those reported pure TiO2 nanotube electrode16 and TiO2–carbon composite nanotube electrodes.24 An additional advantage of the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofiber electrode is the enhancement of rate capability due to the short Li+ diffusion paths and easy access of the electrolyte through interconnected pores, as well as the good electrical connectivity. The rate capability testing results are shown in Fig. 5 (d). Compared with the bare TiO2 porous nanofiber electrode, the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofiber electrode exhibits excellent rate performance; it delivers discharge capacity of over 220 mAh g−1 at current density of 25 mA g−1, 179.17 mAh g−1 at 125 mA g−1, 156.83 mAh g−1 at 250 mA g−1, 134.55 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1, finally around 100 mAh g−1 at current density of 1250 mA g−1, respectively, which is better than those of reported pure TiO2 nanotube16 and TiO2–carbon nanotube electordes.24,25 The improved initial capacity, coulombic efficiency, reversible discharge capacity, and rate capability of the TiO2@carbon nanofiber electrode were attributed to the small crystal size of the TiO2 and the porous nature of the TiO2@carbon nanofibers (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3), as well as the high conductivity owing to the high carbon content in the composite (Fig. S3†).
As demonstrated in Scheme S1†, TiO2@carbon nanoparticles, consisting of TiO2 nanocrystals inside porous hard carbon, bond together in a nanofiber to form TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofiber, which possesses many hole/void nanopores due to pyrolysis of PAN during the heat treatment process. Although there are also many nanopores between the TiO2 nanofibers, which are also composed of TiO2 nanoparticles bonded together in a nanofiber form, the relatively poor electrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanofiber electrode should possibly be ascribed to its relatively lower conductivity. Accordingly, the porous TiO2@carbon nanofibers with relatively higher specific surface area compared to micron-sized particles ensure good electrode-electrolyte contact and short lithium ion diffusion pathways during discharge/charge cycling, and thus make a great contribution to lithium storage capacity. Additionally, the carbon matrix in the composite enhances the conductivity of the active materials during lithium intercalation/de-intercalation, which plays a critical role in the excellent lithium storage capacity and cyclability of the electrode.
Conclusions
In summary, under optimized synthesis conditions including the composition and concentration of electrospun solution and electrospun parameters such as temperature of collector, the distance between collector and spinet, pushing velocity of solution and applied voltage between spinet and collector and so on, very large area (4 cm × 2.5 cm), uniform TiO2@carbon and TiO2 nanofibers consisting of orderly bonded nanoparticles were prepared by thermal pyrolysis and oxidization of titanium(IV) isopropoxide/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers in argonvia a simple electrospinning technology for the first time. As a potential anode material for lithium ion batteries, these TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers display a high initial reversible capacity of 217.1 mAh g−1 with high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% at the current density of 30 mA g−1 and deliver a high reversible specific capacity of over 200 mAh g−1 in the first 50 cycles, and further maintain a reversible capacity after 100 cycles of approximately 206 mAh g−1 with high coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%, much higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanofiber electrode. This particular orderly-bonded nanoparticle composite architecture is characterized by many nanopores in the nanofibers. These nanopores facilitate lithium ion and electrolyte diffusion in the active materials during charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the high carbon content matrix in the TiO2@carbon hybrid nanofibers acts to encapsulate the TiO2 nanocrystals and enhance the conductivity of the active material, as compared with pure TiO2 nanofibers. Therefore, the composite is a very promising potential anode material for LIBs, even though the composition and structure of these materials require further improvement.
