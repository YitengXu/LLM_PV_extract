    , Accepted 22nd September 2015First published on 22nd September 2015AbstractThis work reports on two new complexes with the general formula [Cd3(IBA)3(Cl)2(HCOO)(H2O)]n (1) and {[Cd1.5(IBA)3(H2O)6]·3.5H2O}n (2), which can be synthesized by the reaction of CdII with rigid linear ligand 4-HIBA containing imidazolyl and carboxylate functional groups [4-HIBA = 4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid]. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that complex 1 is a 2D “wave-like” layer structure constructed from trinuclear units and complex 2 is just a mononuclear structure. Surprisingly, both complexes 1 and 2 appear as a 3D supramolecular network via intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions. What's more, due to their strong UV-visible absorption, 1 and 2 can be employed as co-sensitizers in combination with N719 to enhance dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) performance. Both of them could overcome the deficiency of the ruthenium complex N719 absorption in the region of ultraviolet and blue-violet, and the charge collection efficiency is also improved when 1 and 2 are used as co-sensitizers, which are all in favor of enhancing the performance. The DSSC devices using co-sensitizers of 1/N719 and 2/N719 show an overall conversion efficiency of 8.27% and 7.73% with a short circuit current density of 17.48 mA cm−2 and 17.39 mA cm−2, and an open circuit voltage of 0.75 V and 0.74 V, respectively. The overall conversion efficiency is 27.23% and 18.92% higher than that of a device solely sensitized by N719 (6.50%). Consequently, the prepared complexes are high efficiency co-sensitizers for enhancing the performance of N719 sensitized solar cells.
Introduction
There is an ever growing interest in developing metal coordination complexes (MCCs) for photovoltaic performance applications.1 The main difficulty in improving the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion lies in the spectral mismatch between the energy distribution of photons in the incident solar spectrum and the band-gap of a semiconductor material.2 Co-sensitization is an effective approach to enhance the device performance through a combination of two or more dyes sensitized by the same semiconductor film together, extending the light harvesting spectrum.3 Ruthenium complex N719 as a typical representative organic dye used in DSSCs has a low utilization in the region of short wavelengths. Enhancing N719 absorption efficiency in the full-spectrum of sunlight still remains a great challenge in this field.4 For this reason, MCCs with strong absorption in the short wavelength region are being applied in the DSSC as co-sensitizers. The key to the design of photoelectric MCCs is the matching of an organic ligand and a central metal ion in order to provide the platform to generate ultraviolet absorption.5–8
Organic ligands with N and/or O donors often have been employed as effective building blocks in the construction of metal coordination complexes.9,10 Among the organic ligands, the rigid ligand 4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid with a π-conjugated system plays crucial roles in determining the structure and ultraviolet absorption of the MCCs because of the diversiform coordination mode and the flexible nature of N and/or O donors.11–15 The enormous variability of available ligand–metal combinations opens the possibility of creating photovoltaic materials “by design”. CdII has been chosen as an excellent participant for the construction of complexes because of its relatively low-cost (compared to IrIII, RuII, OsII and PtII, which are used as common co-sensitizers).16–20 On the basis of the above considerations, our group designed low-cost CdII complexes to replace precious metal coordination complexes as co-sensitizers.21
In this report, we have successfully designed and synthesized two new CdII complexes, [Cd3(IBA)3(Cl)2(HCOO)(H2O)]n (1), and {[Cd1.5(IBA)3(H2O)6]·3.5H2O}n (2). Since they exhibit strong absorption from 300–400 nm, 1 and 2 were selected to be co-sensitizers and applied in the DSSC system sensitized by N719, respectively. It showed that the absorption spectra of 1 and 2 could compensate for that of N719 in region of ultraviolet and blue-violet, and thus, the light harvesting was enhanced. This results in 27.23% and 18.92% improvement of DSSC performance. Therefore, 1 and 2 are promising candidates as co-sensitizers for high efficiency DSSCs. This strategy may provide interesting insight into the development of high-performance DSSC devices.
Results and discussion
Structure description: [Cd3(IBA)3(Cl)2(HCOO)(H2O)]n (1)
Structural analysis indicates that 1 is a trinuclear 2D “wave-like” layer structure. The relevant asymmetric unit consists of three crystallographically independent CdII cations, three IBA− anions, two chloride anions, one HCOO− anion and one coordinated water molecule (Fig. 1a). The central Cd2 cation is linked to two asymmetry-related terminal Cd1 and Cd3 cations by two chloride ions to afford a linear trinuclear unit with a Cd1⋯Cd2 distance of 3.622(1) Å and a Cd2⋯Cd3 distance of 3.985(1) Å. Cd1 and Cd2 are located in a distorted {CdNO4Cl} and {CdNO3Cl2} octahedral geometry, respectively. The Cd3 is coordinated with three oxygen atoms and one nitrogen atom from IBA− and HCOO− anions, forming a slightly distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry along with one chloride anion (Fig. 1b). In the trinuclear cluster, the distances of Cd–O [2.236(4) Å–2.488(4) Å], Cd–N [2.234(4) Å–2.272(4) Å] and Cd–Cl [2.522(2) Å–2.692 (2) Å] are in the normal ranges of previously reported CdII complexes,22,23 and the bond angles around the central Cd(II) ion vary from 50.5(1)°–173.5(1)°. The neighbouring trinuclear units (Cd1oct–Cd2oct–Cd3penta) are connected with one HCOO− anion, forming a 1D straight chain (Fig. 1c). Each IBA− anion links two adjacent cadmium cations to form another 1D “wave-like” chain structure (Fig. 1d). The carboxylate group of the different IBA− anions adopts a chelate coordinated mode and a chelate-monatomic bridge coordinated mode, respectively. Two adjacent chains are interconnected to construct a 2D “wave-like” layer structure (Fig. 1e).

If the coordinated water molecule was ignored, the CdII cation considered as the node, and the three IBA− anions, two chloride anions and one HCOO− anion as the linkers, the simplified topological representation of 1 exhibits a 4-connected 2D “wave-like” sql topological type, which is described in Fig. 2a. It is noteworthy that the 2D sheets are arranged in an interesting 3D supramolecular network via O3–H3A⋯O7 and O3–H3C⋯Cl2 intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 2b).

Structure description: {[Cd1.5(IBA)3(H2O)6]·3.5H2O}n (2)
The results of X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that complex 2 consists of one and a half Cd2+ cations, three IBA− anions, six coordination water molecules and three and a half free water molecules, which is shown in Fig. 3a. Each CdII cation is six-coordinated by four oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms from four coordination water molecules and two IBA− anions, resulting in a slightly distorted octahedron geometry (Fig. 3b). Cd–O bond lengths range from 2.265(3) Å to 2.388(2) Å and Cd–N bond lengths vary from 2.269(2) Å to 2.293(2) Å, respectively. O–Cd–O bond angles range from 81.2(6)° to 180.0(1)° and O–Cd–N bond angles are in the range of 84.1 (7)°–99.7 (7)°, respectively. Each CdII cation links two IBA− anions and four coordinated water molecules to form a mononuclear structure. In complex 2, the distance of O–H⋯O is in the range from 1.860 to 2.034 Å. A 3D supramolecular network is formed by O–H⋯O hydrogen bonded interactions (Fig. 3c).

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermal analyses of complexes 1 and 2
PXRD has been used to check the phase purity of the bulky samples in the solid state. As shown in Fig. S1,† the experimental PXRD patterns of complexes 1 and 2 are in good agreement with the simulated patterns, which indicate the good phase purity of complexes 1 and 2.24 The differences in intensity may be due to the preferred orientation of the crystalline powder samples. Thermogravimetric experiments were conducted to study the thermal stability of complexes 1 and 2 (Fig. S2†).25 For 1, the first weight loss of 12.05% from 63 °C to 151 °C is attributed to the release of one coordinated water molecule, two HCl molecules and one HCOOH molecule (calcd: 13.26%).26 The second weight loss of 53.14% (calcd: 54.67%) from 153 °C corresponds to the loss of three 4-HIBA ligands. 2 displays two weight loss steps. The first of 17.64%, from 126 °C to 257 °C, is assigned to the loss of six coordination water molecules and three and a half free water molecules (calcd: 18.99%). The second weight loss of 61.21% from 266 °C to 402 °C corresponds to the decomposition three 4-HIBA ligands (calcd: 62.64%).
Optical properties of complexes 1 and 2
The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in ethanol are shown in Fig. 4 and their absorption data are listed in Table 1. The two prepared complexes display strong absorption peaks at ca. 334 nm with weak shoulder absorption bands at around 372 nm. In comparison to the absorption of N719 in ethanol (Fig. 4), the absorption spectra of 1 and 2 could compensate for that of N719 in the wavelength region of ultraviolet and blue-violet. Encouraged by the above test, 1 and 2 can be considered as co-sensitizers used in N719 sensitized DSSCs. The molar extinction coefficients in the blue-violet region are 48709 M−1 cm−1 for 1 and 44770 M−1 cm−1 for 2. All of these are much higher than that of the ruthenium complex N719.27,28 A higher molar extinction coefficient indicates that 1 and 2 possess higher light harvesting ability in this wavelength region compared with N719 and I3− (25000 M−1 cm−1).29 Hence it can be predicted that the photon lost due to the light absorption by I3− will be suppressed by the use of 1 or 2 as a co-sensitizer.

To further investigate whether the prepared complexes are suitable for use in DSSCs, the absorption spectra of 1/N719 and 2/N719 co-sensitized TiO2 films are recorded and shown in Fig. 5. The absorption of N719 on the TiO2 film in the visible light region is remarkably broadened due to the electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface.30 When N719 was combined with 1 or 2, respectively, its absorption in the region of 350–500 nm on the TiO2 film was enhanced. The enhancement of absorption in the region of 350–500 nm is consistent with the result that the prepared complexes could compensate for that of N719 in the wavelength region of the visible spectrum in a solid state.

Electrochemical properties of complexes 1 and 2
Energy matching is crucial in selecting sensitizers for DSSCs. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the two prepared complexes and the experimental data are also summarized in Table 1. The HOMO values for 1 and 2 are evaluated to be −5.31 and −5.39 eV, respectively. As calculated from the edge of absorption spectra, the excitation transition energies (E0–0) for 1 and 2 are 3.12 and 3.18 eV, respectively. Therefore, the LUMO levels of 1 and 2 are calculated to be −2.19 and −2.21 eV, respectively.31 The LUMO level of a sensitizer should lie above the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.40 eV vs. vacuum) for efficient electron injection, and its HOMO energy level should lie below the energy level of the I−/I3− redox couple (−4.85 eV vs. vacuum) for regeneration. The LUMO levels of the complexes 1 and 2 are higher than that of N719 and the conduction band of TiO2, which result in an enhanced injection driving force of electrons compared with N719 alone. Thus, the positive synergistic effect of these complexes and N719 improves the electron injection efficiency from the LUMO of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of 1 and 2 are shown in Scheme 1. It shows that the energy levels of 1 and 2 are appropriate for the DSSC system containing TiO2.32

Photovoltaic properties of DSSCs
The two prepared complexes were employed as co-sensitizers to assemble co-sensitized DSSCs, which were fabricated following a stepwise co-sensitization procedure by sequentially immersing the TiO2 electrode (with a thickness of ca. 10 μm) in a separate solution of N719 and the prepared complexes. For comparison purposes, devices sensitized by the individual dye N719 were also fabricated under the same experimental conditions. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices co-sensitized by 1/N719 and 2/N719 as well as solely sensitized by N719 under illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding cell performances are summarized in Table 2. The individual N719 sensitized device is found to exhibit an overall conversion efficiency (η) value of 6.50% (with Jsc = 16.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, and FF = 0.58). This low performance compared to the previous reports could be due to the single thin transparent TiO2 film used in these devices. The individual complex 1 and 2 sensitized device exhibited a η value of 2.19% (with Jsc = 6.36 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, and FF = 0.58) and 2.02% (with Jsc = 6.04 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, and FF = 0.56), respectively. The lower η value for devices sensitized by the individual complex co-sensitizers is obviously attributed to their narrow adsorption band. However, the co-sensitized solar cell devices 1/N719 and 2/N719 showed an efficiency of 8.27% (with Jsc = 17.48 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V, and FF = 0.63) and 7.73% (with Jsc = 17.39 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.74 V, and FF = 0.60), respectively. The efficiency of the devices co-sensitized by 1/N719 and 2/N719 is 27.23% and 18.92% higher than that of cells sensitized by N719.

Dark-current measurement of DSSCs has been considered as a qualitative technique to describe the extent of the back electron transfer. A comparison of dark current between the investigated cells can provide useful information regarding the back electron transfer process. Fig. 7 shows the dark current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes. The onset potential of the dark current for an individual N719-sensitized DSSC occurs at a bias of about +0.44 V, with a subsequent dramatic increase of dark current with the increase of potential. In contrast, for the co-sensitized DSSCs, the onset potential shifted to about +0.50 V for 1/N719 and 2/N719. The increase of the onset potential indicates that complexes 1 and 2 could successfully suppress the electron back reaction with I3− in the electrolyte.

The higher η values of 1/N719 and 2/N719 co-sensitized solar cells are attributed to the enhanced photovoltaic parameters of Jsc and Voc. Generally, the Jsc value is influenced by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) response of cells, since they are related by the equation:  where e is the elementary charge and ϕph.AM1.5G is the photon flux at AM 1.5 G and 100 mW cm−2 irradiation.34–36 The IPCE spectra of different devices are collected in Fig. 8. The DSSCs containing only N719 dye have a broad IPCE spectrum from 300–750 nm but decrease in the wavelength range of 340–420 nm, which is due to the competitive light absorption between I3− and N719. When the prepared complexes are used as co-sensitizer, the IPCE spectrum in the whole visible region is enhanced. This can be attributed to the fact that the prepared complexes have attached to the TiO2 surface effectively and contributed to the electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2. This means the co-sensitization of N719 and new complexes have significant synergy and compensatory effects on light harvesting and electron injection. Based on the IPCE and the absorption spectra, the cells’ higher Jsc in the case of co-sensitization is mainly ascribed to better light harvesting in the short wavelength region, where the absorption of N719 is compensated and the competitive light absorption of I3− is overcome.

In order to investigate the charge injection dynamics in different DSSCs and further understand the underlying causes which result in different short circuit current density (Jsc), transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy was employed to characterize co-sensitized and single N719 sensitized solar cells. Also, additives for co-sensitizers are known to affect the electron injection dynamics. The TA spectra of N719, 1/N719 and 2/N719 with the addition of an iodide-based electrolyte at 500 ps are shown in Fig. S3.† The spectra show negative ground state bleaching features, which result from a decrease in the absorption of the excited dye, less than 610 nm. The spectra are dominated by a broad photo-induced absorption (PA) band, which results from increased absorption of the excited dye, greater than 610 nm. This broad PA band is the convolution of two PA spectral features. We attribute one PA feature to the absorption of the excited-state dye (dye*) at approximately 650 nm, and the other to the absorption of the oxidized-dye (dye+) at approximately 760 nm. The oxidized-dye is formed after charge injection occurs, and is therefore a probe of the ultrafast charge injection dynamics in DSSCs.37,38 It is worth noting that after co-sensitization, at 760 nm (dye+) there is an increase in the PA signal while at 650 nm (dye*) the PA signal is unchanged, which indicates that the charge injection was enhanced after co-sensitization and resulted in enhanced Jsc. The increase in the PA signal at 760 nm further confirmed that the electron injection from the photo-excited states of dye to the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically favorable.
Under light illumination, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to analyze the charge transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface of DSSCs.39,40 As shown in Fig. 9a, the two semicircles located in high and middle frequency regions (left to right) are attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of the large semicircle located in middle frequency regions in the Nyquist plots is decreased after co-sensitization with a complex, and the values are in the order of 1/N719 < 2/N719 < N719. The electron transport time (τd) is a measure of the average time taken by the injected electron to reach the collecting FTO electrode; a faster electron transport time is associated with a higher photocurrent.41 It could also be calculated from the Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra of different solar cells (Fig. 9b), according to the relationship: τd = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the frequency at the maximum of the curve in the intermediate frequency region in the Bode phase plot. The calculated values of the electron transport time (τd) for different devices are 5.35 ms for 1/N719, 6.22 ms for 2/N719 and 8.68 ms for individual N719, respectively.
 Fig. 9  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode plots of EIS for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured under standard AM1.5 G solar irradiation. 
In dark conditions, as shown in Fig. 10a, the two semicircles located in high, middle and low frequency regions (left to right) of Nyquist plots are attributed to the redox reaction at the Pt counter electrode and the electron transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Therefore the larger semicircle observed in the middle frequency region represents the resistances of the charge transfer from the TiO2 to the electrolyte. The radius of the semicircle observed in middle frequency range lies in the order of 1/N719 > 2/N719 > N719, which indicates an increase of electron recombination impedance and a reduction of the interfacial charge recombination rate.
 Fig. 10  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode plots of EIS for DSSCs based on different photoelectrodes measured in dark conditions. 
In an effort to understand the enhancement of the Voc value in the dye-sensitized solar cells, the electron lifetimes (τe) in different devices were calculated by fitting the Bode plots of the EIS spectra of different solar cells in the dark (Fig. 10b), according to the relationship: τe = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the frequency at the maximum of the curve in the intermediate frequency region in the Bode phase plot.42 The electron lifetimes (τe) for the devices co-sensitized with prepared complexes (19.49 ms for 1/N719 and 17.53 ms for 2/N719) were found to be longer than an individually N719 sensitized device (13.40 ms). This difference might be expected, since the adsorption of prepared complexes may form a better dye coverage to passivate the TiO2 surface or form an insulating molecular layer composed of prepared complexes and N719 molecules. It will reduce the recombination due to electron back-transfer. This retardation of the charge recombination between injected electrons and I3− ions in the electrolyte leads to a consequent increase of Voc. This appears to be consistent with the larger Voc value sequence which is in the order of 1/N719 > 2/N719 > N719.
The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) values of different devices are 0.78 for 1/N719, 0.74 for 2/N719 and 0.61 for N719, which was calculated using the following equation:  
It is found that the charge collection efficiency was increased after co-sensitization. The higher ηcc value helps to understand the enhanced IPCE response of the 1/N719 and 2/N719 co-sensitized cells. The IPCE response of the solar cell can be expressed by the equation:IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ηinj(λ)ηcc(λ) = (1 − 10−A)ηinj(λ)ηcc(λ)where LHE is the light harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge collection efficiency, A is the absorbance of the dye on TiO2 at the maximum wavelength.43 Among these factors, LHE plays a very important role, and it depends on the absorption property of the dyes (Fig. 11a). In addition, as discussed above, the electron injection from the photo-excited states of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 is thermodynamically favorable since the LUMO energy levels of both N719 and the complexes lie above the conduction band of TiO2. Meanwhile, the absorption of N719 is compensated by the complexes, which leads to an enhanced light harvesting efficiency. Herein, the charge collection efficiency is also confirmed to increase after co-sensitization. The absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE) spectra, calculated as IPCE/LHE, are shown in Fig. 11b.44 As can be seen, the APCE of the cells varies in the same trend with IPCE in the wavelength range with 1/N719 > 2/N719 > N719. In a word, complex 1 or 2, as a co-sensitizer, not only has overcome the deficiency of N719 absorption in the region of ultraviolet and blue-violet, but also has enhanced the charge collection efficiency, which should be responsible for the enhanced IPCE and Jsc.

Moreover, when the molecular structures of the prepared complexes are taken into account, it is found that there is a relationship between the crystal structure and DSSC performance. The performance of co-sensitized DSSCs is in the order of 1/N719 > 2/N719. This difference in performance is attributed to the changed absorption of the prepared complexes caused by different structures. Due to the existence of lone pair electrons, the chlorine ion in complex 1 could conjugate with the π system to increase the density of the electron cloud and lead to the enhancement of the conjugated delocalized system. Thus, compared to complex 2, the ultraviolet absorption peak of complex 1 moves toward the long wavelength and the absorption intensity is enhanced. The longer wavelength shift is better for compensating the absorption of N719 and overcoming the competitive light absorption of I3−, which is better for electronic energy transfer and further enhances the spectral response of N719 on TiO2 films.
Conclusion
Two new CdII complexes with a multifunctional 4-HIBA ligand have been prepared and investigated as co-sensitizers in a ruthenium dye N719 based solar cell. The cells show photo-electricity conversion efficiencies of 8.27% and 7.73%, which are higher than that for DSSCs using single N719 (6.50%). The improvement in efficiency is attributed to the fact that these complexes can overcome the deficiency of N719 absorption in the region of ultraviolet and blue-violet. Generally, this type of co-sensitization is anticipated to arouse broad interest in further boosting the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells by using these important classes of complexes.
