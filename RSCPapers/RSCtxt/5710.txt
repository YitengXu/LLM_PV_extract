    , Accepted 5th November 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractWe report a new method to prepare high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films under ambient conditions via two-step concentration gradient-controlled reactions. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine their degree of crystallization and microstructures. The results showed that the reactions between CH3NH3I solutions of different concentrations and PbI2 films yielded perovskite films with various degrees of crystallization and surface morphologies. The first-step reaction between a low concentration CH3NH3I solution (6 mg ml−1) and PbI2 films resulted in the formation of large-scale perovskite grains with some PbI2 residue. In addition, the subsequent second-step reaction with a high concentration MAI solution (30 mg ml−1) achieved good crystallization and full coverage of the perovskite films on the substrates. The average grain size of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films prepared from this concentration gradient method reached 1.4 μm, and they also showed reduced overall grain boundaries. Enhanced spectral absorption in the long-wavelength region was also observed for the large-grain perovskite films due to the grain size-dependent light scattering. Moreover, the comparison between AM1.5G sunlight and the spectral absorption indicated that it might benefit the efficient power conversion of solar cells. Even though processed under ambient conditions with a high humidity of ca. 75%, the solar cells fabricated from these films exhibited enhanced photovoltaic performance compared with those constructed using the single solution method, reaching a power conversion efficiency of 11.48%.
Introduction
In the past few years, perovskite solar cells have attracted much attention with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) sharply increased from 3.8% to 22.1%, showing great potential for commercial applications.1–4 It was reported that the performance of perovskite solar cells, including their power conversion efficiency, hysteresis and stability, was strongly affected by the quality of the perovskite films.4–10 During the fabrication of halide perovskite solar cells, the quality of perovskite films was mainly evaluated by grain sizes, grain boundaries and film coverage. For instance, the large grain size and fewer boundaries reduced the recombination centers as well as series resistances of devices, which benefited the separation of excited electron–hole pairs.6–9 The full coverage of the perovskite films reduced the leakage currents and improved the stability of the photovoltaic devices.10,11 Therefore, the preparation of high-quality perovskite films with large grain sizes and full coverage is an important topic.
Previous work showed that during the reaction between PbI2 films and CH3NH3I solutions, the concentration of CH3NH3I solutions deeply influenced the formation of the perovskite films.6,12,13 High concentration CH3NH3I solutions lead to a large degree of nucleation but small grain size of nano-scales, while low concentration CH3NH3I solutions resulted in the growth of large perovskite grains but worse coverage, making neither of them qualified enough for high-performance solar cells. According to the theory of crystal nucleation and growth, we developed a new method to control the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films via two-step concentration gradient-controlled reactions under high humidity conditions. High-quality perovskite films with large grain sizes and good coverage have been achieved, and enhanced photovoltaic performance of the corresponding perovskite solar cells was observed.
Experimental
Preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films
462 mg of PbI2 was dissolved in 1 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide, and filtered using PTFE syringe filters (0.22 μm) before being further processed. CH3NH3I (abbreviated as MAI) was dissolved in dehydrated isopropanol solvent (6, 10, 20, 30 mg ml−1). The preparation procedures for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films via the two-step concentration gradient-controlled reactions are shown in Fig. 1. First, the PbI2 solution was heated at 70 °C and spin-coated onto regular glass substrates covered with TiO2, at speeds of 3000 rpm for 5 seconds and 6000 rpm for 5 seconds. Second, the PbI2 films were annealed under ambient conditions at 100 °C for 10 minutes. Third, 0.5 ml of the MAI solution (6 mg ml−1) was added dropwise onto the PbI2 films and loaded for different times (10, 20, 40, 60 seconds) for the first-step growth of the perovskite films, and then spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 seconds for drying. Fourth, the films were heated at 100 °C for 10 minutes for drying. Fifth, 0.5 ml of the MAI solutions of high concentrations (10, 20, 30 mg ml−1) were added dropwise onto the films and loaded for 50 seconds, spin-coated for drying at 3000 rpm for 20 seconds for the second-step growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 films. Finally, the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes to obtain the perovskite films. The detailed design of the experiments is shown in Tables 1 and 2. To make a comparison, the perovskite film 6m-60s was also prepared from the single solution method. All the processes were carried out under ambient conditions with the humidity of ca. 60%.

Fabrication of devices
The solar devices were fabricated with the FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 + absorber/HTM/Au structure. FTO glass substrates were etched with 2 M HCl and zinc powder, washed with IPA, acetone and clean water, and dried for use. Then, the FTO substrates were treated with ultraviolet light-induced ozone. A TiO2 precursor was prepared as reported in ref. 19, spin-coated onto the FTO glass, and sintered at 450 °C for 1 hour to form a compact TiO2 layer. The mesoporous TiO2 gel was spin-coated onto the compact TiO2 layer and sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes. After the sintered substrates were cooled, the perovskite films were prepared as described above. The hole transport material was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 20 μL of 300 mg mL−1 cobalt TFSI acetonitrile stock solution and 17.5 μL of 520 mg mL−1 lithium bis-(trifluoromethyl sulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene, and then spin-coated onto the perovskite layers. Finally, 30 nm of gold layer was evaporated on the samples to form an electrode. The procedures of the fabrication were carried out under ambient conditions with the humidity of ca. 75%.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded from 10° to 40° at a scanning step of 0.01° s−1 using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JCM-6000, JEOL, Japan) was used to determine the microstructures and surface morphologies of the perovskite films. A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (S5200, Hitachi, Japan) was used to characterize the cross-section images of the perovskite films. A UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (V-670, JASCO Co. Ltd., USA) was applied to characterize the optical properties of the samples by the absorption and transmittance spectra from 300–800 nm.
The I–V characteristics of the perovskite solar devices were measured using a solar simulator (CEP-2000 Bunko Keiki Co. Ltd., Japan) interfaced with a xenon lamp (Bunko Keiki BSOX150LC) at 100 mW cm−2 under AM1.5G conditions. The power of the light exposure from the solar simulator was fixed with an amorphous Si photodetector (Bunko Keiki BS-520 S/N 353) to avoid discrepancy between the calibrated diode and the measured devices. The cell area was precisely controlled using a 0.12 cm2 black metal mask to measure the photovoltaic performance of the devices.
Results and discussion
1. Growth of CH3NH3PbI3 films
CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films were prepared from the two-step MAI concentration gradient-controlled reactions. According to the literature,6 the low concentration MAI solution (6 mg ml−1) was chosen for the first-step reaction to grow large grains. As shown in Table 1, at the beginning, the PbI2 films were reacted with the 6 mg ml−1 MAI solution for 60 seconds, and then they were treated with the higher concentration MAI solutions (10, 20, 30 mg ml−1) for 50 seconds at the second-step reaction. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 2. There was still much PbI2 residue in the sample 6m-60s. However, after the treatment with the higher concentration MAI solution (10 mg ml−1), the intensity of the peaks of the PbI2 residue was weakened. Moreover, as the concentration of the MAI solutions increased, the peaks of the PbI2 residue disappeared. The samples 6m-60s-20m-50s and 6m-60s-30m-50s were well crystallized with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites with little PbI2 residue. As shown in Fig. 3, the SEM images indicated that a gradual change occurred on the surface morphologies of the samples prepared from the different MAI solutions. The sample 6m-60s showed large perovskite grains with many spaces between them. As the MAI concentration increased at the second-step reaction, the spaces between the grains gradually narrowed and reduced, and the coverage of the perovskite films improved. Particularly, the sample 6m-60s-30m-50s showed full perovskite coverage on the substrates, with the average grain size up to 1.4 μm. It is reported that the oxygen at TiO2–perovskite interfaces contributed to the degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.11 Therefore, the improved coverage could favor the protection of TiO2–perovskite interfaces from oxygen and promote the stability of perovskite films.

Second, the effect of different MAI loading times at the first step on the perovskite formation was investigated. As shown in Table 2, the PbI2 films were treated with 6 mg ml−1 MAI solutions for different seconds, and then they were treated with 30 mg ml−1 MAI solutions for 50 seconds. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples in Fig. 4 revealed that, except for some PbI2 residue in the 6m-10s-30m-50s sample, all the other samples were well crystallized with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the surface morphologies of the samples. The 6m-10s-30m-50s sample mainly consisted of dispersed nano-grains with some big particles. As the loading time increased at the first step, the grain size of the perovskite sharply increased to 1–2 μm, with good coverage on the surfaces. The detailed statistical information on grain size distribution can be seen in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The sample 6m-60s-30m-50s exhibited a continuous distribution of grain size, which can benefit full coverage. In contrast, the grain sizes of the samples 6m-20s-30m-50s, 6m-60s-10m-50s and 6m-10s-30m-50s exhibited a relatively centralized distribution.

2. Mechanism of concentration gradient-controlled growth
The two-step concentration gradient-controlled reactions resulted in the formation of high-quality perovskite films. However, the mechanism is not so clear. Therefore, XRD and SEM were introduced to investigate the concentration gradient-controlled growth of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskites. Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of the samples treated with 6 mg ml−1 MAI solutions for different times. The results revealed that as the loading time increased, the perovskite content in the films gradually increased. When the MAI solution was loaded on the surface of the PbI2 films, it slowly reacted with the PbI2 and formed perovskites. Furthermore, the SEM images of 6m-xs are shown in Fig. 7. There were a few small perovskite particles discontinuously distributed on the surface of the PbI2 films after loading the MAI solution for 10 seconds, with most of the PbI2 films uncovered. As the MAI loading time increased, the particle size became bigger and the coverage of the perovskite films increased. However, even if the loading time was up to 60 seconds and some particles grew up to 1.5 μm, there were still some PbI2 residue and spaces in the films. According to the theory of nucleation and growth, the nucleation calls for higher interfacial energy than grain growth.12,13 During the formation of the perovskite films, because the lower concentration MAI solutions offered lower interfacial free energy between the solid and the solution, only a few nucleation centers could occur at the high-energetic sites of the PbI2 films. After that, they acted as the perovskite seeds and grew into bigger grains. However, the other low-energetic sites at the PbI2 films could not nucleate but remained due to the low interfacial free energy. As the reaction went on, the concentration of the MAI solution decreased, which made the perovskite more difficult to nucleate but grow. Therefore, the sample 6m-60s formed perovskite films with large grains and some PbI2 residue left at spaces between the grains. The PbI2 residue at the spaces can be used for further reaction in the second step.

 Fig. 7  SEM images of the surface morphology of the samples 6m-xs: (a) x = 10, (b) x = 20, (c) x = 40, (d) x = 60. 
According to the discussion above, the mechanism of the concentration gradient-controlled growth can be explained in Fig. 8. First, the PbI2 films were formed on the substrates with some high-energetic sites at the surfaces. Second, when the low concentration MAI solution was added onto the surfaces, the high-energetic sites reacted with the MAI and formed discontinuous perovskite seeds. Considering that the perovskite nucleation called for a higher interfacial free energy than grain growth, the low-energetic PbI2 parts could not react with the low concentration MAI solution. Particularly, when the reaction went on, the MAI was consumed and the interfacial free energy decreased. Thus, only the perovskite seeds formed from the high-energetic sites grew in this step. Third, when the high concentration MAI solutions were loaded on the surface of the films, these pre-formed perovskite grains acted as the seeds for the second-step reaction and grew. At the same time, new nucleation occurred at the interface because the interfacial free energy increased. Consequently, new small perovskite grains formed and tightly filled the spaces between the former grains. Finally, the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with large grain sizes and good coverage were formed on the substrates by two-step concentration gradient-controlled growth.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of the nucleation/crystallization for the formation of perovskite films via two-step concentration gradient-controlled growth. 
Regarding the effect of loading time on the 6m-xs-30m-50s films, it mainly affected the growth of the perovskite grains at the first step. There were just a few perovskite grains discontinuously left in the sample 6m-10s after the reaction for 10 seconds. In contrast, most of the PbI2 film was uncovered, and then nucleation to a great extent occurred at the second-step reaction. Therefore, the finally prepared sample 6m-10s-30m-50s mainly formed small grains (ca. 300 nm). As the MAI loading time increased at the first-step reaction, the perovskite grains grew and gradually covered the films with larger perovskite grains, fewer spaces and less PbI2 residue. When the 30 mg ml−1 MAI solution was loaded at the second step, it reacted with the PbI2 residue and triggered the new nucleation and growth of perovskites. These new grains filled the spaces between the large grains and formed the perovskite films with large and small grains.
Regarding the effect of MAI concentration on the 6m-60s-xm-50s films, it mainly affected the nucleation at the second step. As mentioned above, the 10 mg ml−1 MAI solution offered higher interfacial energy than the 6 mg ml−1 MAI solution, but lower interfacial free energy for nucleation than the 20 and 30 mg ml−1 MAI solutions at the second-step reaction. Therefore, in the sample 6m-60s-10m-50s, the growth of the former perovskite grains dominated, resulting in larger grains but with some PbI2 residue still left in the spaces after the reaction. When the higher concentration MAI solutions (20, 30 mg ml−1) were loaded on the sample 6m-60s, they offered higher interfacial free energy for the new nucleation and growth in the spaces. Consequently, small perovskite grains were formed and filled the spaces, resulting in complete reaction and improved coverage of the films with the multi-sized perovskite grains.
3. UV-visible absorption behaviors
The UV-visible absorption behaviors of these films are shown in Fig. 9. The absorption threshold remained unchanged for all of the samples, indicating the same band gaps of the samples. However, there was an obvious difference in the absorption strength in different regions. For the film of 6m-60s prepared from the one-step single MAI solution reaction, it showed absorption without strong peaks. As shown in Fig. 9(A), after treatment with the higher concentration MAI solution, all the perovskite films showed higher absorption than 6m-60s, especially the enhanced absorption in the short-wavelength region. In addition, it was found that there was little enhancement in the long-wavelength region for the sample 6m-60s-10m-50s. Regarding the loading time effect on the absorption of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 9(B), the sample 6m-10s-30m-50s showed major absorption located at the 350–500 nm wavelength region, but lower absorption than 6m-60s in the long-wavelength region. In contrast, when the MAI loading time was longer than 20 seconds, the absorptions of the samples 6m-xs-30m-50s (x = 10, 20, 40, 60) became higher than that of 6m-60s, broadened up to the short wavelength of ca. 350 nm. The cross-section FE-SEM images (seen in Fig. S2†) indicated that the thickness of the films is almost the same, ca. 450 ± 20 nm. Therefore, the difference in spectral absorption might be strongly related to the microstructures and surface morphology of the films.

The absorption strength of the perovskite films was sensitive to the particle sizes, and Mie scattering theory can be used to explain it. According to the Mie scattering theory, the particle sizes of the medium deeply influence the scattering behavior of the incident light, which affects the absorption.14,15 When the particle size was comparable with the wavelength of the incident light, the scattering would be enhanced.14–16 Therefore, as shown in Fig. 10, large perovskite grains can favor the scattering in the long-wavelength region, while small perovskite grains can favor the scattering in the short-wavelength region. For the sample 6m-60s prepared via the one-step reaction, it mainly consists of large grains up to 1.1 micrometers but with few nano-grains. Accordingly, it might have strong scattering in the long-wavelength region. Since there were few nano-grains, the scattering in the short-wavelength region could almost be ignored. At the same time, as shown in Fig. 11, the sample 6m-60s showed the highest transmittance because of many spaces between the large grains. Additionally, the PbI2 residue's contribution to the absorption can be ignored in our discussion because there was just little PbI2 residue in the as-prepared films. Regarding the perovskite films formed via the two-step concentration gradient-controlled reaction, the MAI loading time at the first-step reaction and the MAI concentration at the second-step reaction strongly affected the light scattering of the samples. After the higher concentration MAI solution treatment, small perovskite grains were formed. Therefore, the light scattering in the short-wavelength region was enhanced. Among the films of 6m-60s-xm-50s, the sample 6m-60s-10m-60s might have the biggest grain size due to the low concentration growth. Consequently, it possessed the strongest scattering in the long-wavelength region. Regarding the loading time effect on the scattering, the sample 6m-10s-30m-50s showed main grains of ca. 300 nm size; in this case, the light scattering existed in the 350–500 nm region while the long-wavelength region showed the highest transmittance. As the MAI loading time increased, the perovskite films formed large grains up to micrometers at the first step, and the sequential treatment with the high concentration MAI solution resulted in the formation of dense films with some nano-grains. Therefore, compared to the sample 6m-60s, these perovskite films had stronger scattering in the short-wavelength region and lower transmittances. Moreover, the surface roughness also made contributions to the random scattering and re-absorption, which would lead to strong photon-recycling in lead-halide perovskites due to the multiple absorption–diffusion–emission.17,18 Hence, the large-grain perovskite films with some nano-grains and rough surfaces in our experiments achieved enhanced absorption in the long-wavelength region.

4. Photovoltaic performance of the solar devices
In order to evaluate the film quality effect on the power conversion, solar cells were fabricated from the films mentioned above under ambient conditions with a high humidity of ca. 75%. The I–V characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 12 and Table 3. The champion device of the 6m-60s group showed a short current (Jsc) of 9.90 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.87 V and a PCE of 5.25%. After treatment of the perovskite films with the high concentration MAI solutions, all the devices fabricated from the concentration gradient method possessed obviously better photovoltaic performance than 6m-60s. Regarding the concentration effect, the group of 6m-60s-30m-50s showed the champion performance, with the highest Jsc of 18.09 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.98 V and a PCE of 11.48%. Regarding the MAI loading time effect, the group of 6m-40s-30m-50s also showed an improved Jsc of 17.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.93 V and a PCE of 10.30%. As shown in Tables S2 and S3,† the I–V results obviously exhibited that the concentration gradient method is an effective method to prepare perovskite films for high-performance solar cells.

The enhanced performance of the perovskite solar cells was mainly due to the quality improvement of the perovskite films. First, the perovskite films prepared via the concentration gradient method reached better coverage than the 6m-60s sample, which can benefit the reduction of the leakage current. In addition, compared with the sample 6m-10s-30m-50s with nano-grains, the perovskite films with large grains can effectively reduce the grain boundaries and trapping centers. Second, the concentration gradient-controlled reaction resulted in little PbI2 residue. The reduced PbI2 residue in the perovskite films was reported to benefit the enhanced photovoltaic performance of the device by reduction.19–21 Moreover, the enhanced light absorption in the short-wavelength region can also make some contribution to it. Fig. 13 shows the comparison between some samples' absorption and the AM1.5G solar irradiance. The energy distribution of the visible sunlight was mainly located at the region of 450–800 nm.22 Accordingly, it can be clearly seen that the enhanced absorption in the short-wavelength region could benefit the power conversion. Compared with 6m-60s, the samples 6m-60s-30m-50s, 6m-40s-30m-20s and 6m-60s-20m-50s showed full coverage of the pure perovskite with nano-grains and significantly enhanced absorption in the short-wavelength region. Therefore, they serve as good candidates for the application of high-performance perovskite solar cells. In other words, the concentration gradient-controlled growth of CH3NH3PbI3 films must be a route to perovskite solar cells with high output.

Conclusion
In summary, we developed a new method to grow high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films via two-step concentration gradient-controlled reactions. The 6 mg ml−1 MAI solution induced the nucleation and growth of perovskites in the first-step reaction, achieving large grains up to 1.1 μm with spaces between each other, and then the second-step treatment with the high concentration MAI solutions resulted in the formation of well-covered perovskite films with multi-size grains, which reduced grain boundaries and trapping centers. Due to the grain size-dependent light scattering, the perovskite films with large grains showed significantly enhanced absorption in the long-wavelength region, while the absorption of the perovskite films with small grains was mainly located in the short-wavelength region. The energy distribution of the sunlight indicated that the enhanced spectral absorption in the visible region can promote the power conversion of solar cells. Among the perovskite films prepared via the concentration gradient-controlled growth, the films of 6m-60s-30m-50s, 6m-40s-30m-50s and 6m-60s-20m-50s showed large perovskite grains, good coverage and strong absorption in the long-wavelength region, which can promote the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. Consequently, the corresponding solar devices fabricated under ambient conditions with high humidity showed an obviously enhanced short current of 17.43 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.96 V and PCE up to 12.67%. Finally, a nucleation and growth model has been developed to explain the mechanism of the two-step concentration gradient-controlled growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films.
