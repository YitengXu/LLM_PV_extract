1. Introduction
Looking for alternative resources is currently a hot research topic world wide in academic society. Among all potential technologies, photovoltaic solar cells have been highly valued,1–13 new photoelectric conversion materials and device configurations are continuously invented and world-record efficiencies are broken time and time again.14–19 Besides silicon, anatase TiO2 is another core inorganic material that is also capable of efficiently harvesting light and is considered the prominent cathode electrode material in solar cells.20–22 Among different shapes of titania, TiO2 nanotubes have raised a lot of interest in the last decade. This review outlines recent advances in TiO2 nanotube based solar cells including polymer solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). There have been several reviews on TiO2 nanotubes,23–27 and the present one aims to present some novel opinions based on our recent achievements and the latest progress.

        TiO2 is a typical transition metal oxide semiconductor with high chemical stability, low-costs, non-toxicity, strong photocatalytic activity and high photoelectric conversion efficiency. These unique physical and chemical properties render it excellent material for solar energy conversion2 in dye-sensitized solar cells,28–31 heterojunction solar cells,32,33 photocatalysis,34–39 and many other applications.40–46 The most widely used photoelectrode in DSSCs is porous TiO2 films made from nanocrystalline TiO2 particles which are deposited on conductive glass substrates. In general, the dynamic competition between the electron flow in TiO2 and the interfacial charge recombination is the key factor to limit the solar cells efficiency. However, in nanoparticle systems, due to the defects, innumerous trapping sites, long travel distance, and disordered contact areas between two TiO2 nanoparticles, the electron transporting time in the TiO2 bulk phase is rather long, resulting in more charge recombination and enhanced scattering of free electrons with reduced mobility,28 thereby reducing the electron collection at the back contact and hence the overall efficiency. Using nanotubular TiO2 aims to enhance the electron transporting and charge separation efficiency by creating direct pathways for accelerating the charge transfer between interfaces.47–49
In comparison with other forms of nanostructured TiO2 materials, one-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanotubes, especially electrochemical anodized TiO2 nanotubes, are the most attractive candidates for solar energy conversion due to their strong light scattering effects and high surface-to-volume ratio. The highly ordered, vertically oriented tubular structure is very suitable for a high degree of electron mobility along the tube axis, perpendicular to the substrate, which will greatly reduce interface recombination. Fig. 1 shows the electron transporting pathways in a nanocrystalline TiO2 film and the ordered TiO2 NT arrays. The anodized tube structures are expected to greatly improve the charge collection efficiency due to directional electron conduction with minor charge recombination in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle films.28 Moreover, the enhanced internal and external surface area is available for more dye loading,50 particularly in TiO2 nanotube-based photoelectrodes, where two solar cell architectures are paid significant research interest: sensitized solar cells and TiO2/polymer solar cells.51,52

2. Anodized TiO2 nanotubes
2.1 Conventional TiO2 nanotubes
In 1999, Zwilling and co-workers first reported the TiO2 porous film by anodic oxidation of a titanium sheet at low voltage.53,54 Benchmark anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays were initiated by the Grimes group in 2001, in which the nanotubes were formed in an HF aqueous electrolyte with lengths up to 0.5 μm.55 Compared with the hydrothermal or template approach,56–59 anodic oxidation is a more simple and convenient method to obtain uniform and orderly arranged nanotubes perpendicular to the substrate with controllable pore size and length.
Basically two simultaneously occurring reactions are involved in the anodization process: 1) the electrochemical dissolution of Ti under a potential induces complexation with fluoride ions, anodization speed (υelectro); 2) Chemical reaction based dissolution of the ejected Ti(OH)4 at the entrance of the NTs, chemical etching speed (υdis). When υelectro is much larger than υdis, the porous TiO2 nanotube arrays will form and the tube length will gradually increase with time. When υelectro is slightly larger than υdis, self-supporting TiO2 nanotubes appear; when υdis is much faster than υelectro, free-standing NTs develop. The fabrication process of these two kinds of TiO2 NTs and possible anodization mechanism are shown in Scheme 1, where localized chemical dissolution and field-assisted oxidation are shown to precisely determine the final nanoscale architecture.60
 Scheme 1  (a) The controllable fabrication process of TiO2 nanotubes by adjusting the reaction conditions; (b) The possible formation mechanism of nanoporous and free-standing TiO2 nanotubes. 
When the growth and dissolution rate reach a balance, the length of TiO2 NTs will not increase, even if the oxidation time is increased. The barrier layer migrates to the metal substrate to achieve the growth of nanotubes, while chemical dissolution leaves the nanotubes shorter and between these two processes, the growth speed of TiO2 nanotubes is determined.25,61 A faster migration speed of the barrier layer and a slower chemical dissolution rate results in longer tubes, while a greater dissolution effect can decrease the tube length.62 Thus, by precisely regulating the anodization conditions we can effectively control the nanotube morphology to preferred diameters and lengths.
The initial fabrication of TiO2 NTs was in an aqueous solution containing hydrofluoric acid, because the chemical dissolution rate was too high, the NTs were very short.55 A neutral fluoride solution containing phosphate was reported by Schmuki et al. for the preparation of TiO2 NTs, in which the low acidity environment led to a tube length of up to 4 μm.63 Afterwards, Schmuki and Grimes groups used organic solutions as the electrolyte to prepare TiO2 NTs with even longer thickness and unprecedented regularity.64,65 The tube lengths were extended to 134 and 360 μm,66,67 by the choice of proper anodization conditions, the length can even reach 1000 μm and the aspect ratio up to 10000.68 Conventional TiO2 NTs were often prepared at constant-voltage conditions at a slow growing rate due to the decreased current density during the anodizing process and the appearance of a thick insulating oxide layer. To prepare high aspect ratio TiO2 NTs in a short time, a hybrid two step anodic strategy was introduced: first, constant-voltage anodization which is then followed by constant-current anodization.69 Besides fluoride ions,70,71chlorine or bromide-based electrolytes are also suitable for TiO2 NT growth.72–75 So far, the most commonly used organic electrolyte is ethylene glycol,76glycol,77water-free acetic acid78 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).79,80 Most of the TiO2 nanotubes are obtained in solutions containing fluorinated electrolytes. The fluoride ions are essential because they can react with TiO2 to form water-soluble [TiF6]2− complexes to remove the unwanted precipitate, which is the major driving force for developing tubular structures.
2.2 Top porous TiO2 nanotubes
Generally, the chemical dissolution reaction helps to remove the ejected Ti(OH)4, which results in clear, free standing nanotubular morphology. When the dissolution reaction is weak, the sealing of nanotube by the ejected Ti(OH)4 is common. In most studies, the morphology of TiO2 NTs is not regular enough and many defects are present, such as bundling, sealing, over-etching or cracks, which seriously affect its photoelectric properties. This is largely because it is difficult to find a proper balance between the two simultaneously occurring reaction steps. With increasing aspect ratios of TiO2 NTs, bundling becomes more obvious which will bring a greater chance of recombination in TiO2 NT-based solar cells.28,81,82 In TiO2/polymer solar cells, surface bundling also leads to a large number of cracks on the top the surface, which is undesirable for building ordered p–n heterojunction structures. The sealing issue will seriously prevent the p-type materials from filling the nanotube interior. Over etching the pits can also lead to the aggregation of dyes and inadequate contact with the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells, which can reduce the overall efficiency of the solar cells. Device optimization involves optimizing the anodizing conditions for the growth of regular, uniform nanotubes. Fig. 2 (a) shows one example of the bundling problem. When TiO2 NTs grow very long, the tops will aggregate together, leaving large cracks that can be several hundreds of nanometres in width (see the reversed contrast of these cracks). Upon filling with the counterpart materials, when making a solar cell device, this will result in a large amount of the counterpart materials not working properly. The perfect configuration would be the interdigitated heterojunctions with a uniform distribution of materials.

The bundling is primarily caused by capillary force. Frank et al. have prepared nonbundling and crack-free NT films using supercritical CO2 as the drying technique.82 Inspired by the anodization of aluminium, in which nanoporous structures are mostly obtained, we have thought about making TiO2 materials with a similar structure. Guided by the above mentioned anodization mechanisms, a too slow chemical etching rate results in surface precipitation, if the deposition of titanium oxide at the entrance of nanotubes is at a moderate rate: it accumulates but does not block the nanotube end and interconnected nanopores are formed,83 and field-induced random dissolution of the surface forms pore-like structures which develop into tube-like structures.84
For this purpose, a novel two-step anodization was proposed to prepare perfectly aligned nanotubes, in which the first step is the traditional anodization of prepared TiO2 nanotube arrays in ethylene glycol containing a small amount of ammonium fluoride (NH4F), then the TiO2 nanotube array films can be easily removed by simple sonication in acidic aqueous solution, leaving bowl-like footprints on the titanium substrate. After the second anodization, still in the same electrolyte but with the addition of a small amount of hydrofluoric acid (HF), perfectly aligned top porous TiO2 NTs can be formed, free of over-etching, bundling and pore sealing, leaving the structures suitable for a secondary material deposition, Fig. 2(b, c) are the surface and cross-section images of porous TiO2 NTs by a two-step anodization, respectively. The two-step anodization process shows good potential for the large-scale production of TiO2 nanotube array films that could be used as photoelectrode materials and therefore, the large-scale production of TiO2 nanotube based solar cells is possible. According to some detailed general studies, a low temperature, high voltage, a relatively short oxidation time and a low acid concentration are suitable for preparing porous TiO2 NTs in ethylene glycol.60 Additionally, electrolyte composition also plays a critical and important role in determining the resultant morphology of nanotubes, for example, in aqueous solutions, the anodization potential plays a significant role in the nanotube formation, but in nonaqueous solutions, the temperature becomes the major factor to govern the nanotube growth.85
2.3 Fabrication of TiO2 NTs on transparent substrate
The backside-illumination mode of anodized TiO2 nanotube-based solar cells is an obstacle for realizing a high-efficiency since the redox electrolyte containing the iodine species has an absorption in the near UV spectrum and the platinum coated FTO partially, and inevitably reflects light. The relatively low photovoltaic performance of TiO2 NT-based solar cells partly comes from an inability to fabricate high quality TiO2 NTs on a transparent conductive substrate. Thus, fabricating TiO2 NT arrays on a transparent substrate for front-side illumination is required to avoid a loss of light and attain higher power-conversion efficiencies (Fig. 3(a)).86
 Fig. 3  (a) Frontside illumination, integration of transparent nanotube array architecture into dye solar cell structure; (b) Schematic illustration of the procedure for fabricating crystallized TNT/FTO glass films. 
Preparing TiO2 NTs on transparent conductive oxides (TCO) has gained a lot of interest recently, mainly involving either the transfer of the TiO2 NT films on conductive glass87–89 or direct titanium anodization on transparent conductive substrates.86Fig. 3(b) represents a typical process of fabricating TiO2 NT films on FTO, which involves detaching the TiO2 NT membrane from the Ti foil via ultrasonic treatment, then transferring and adhering the membrane onto FTO glass.90 Several strategies have been developed to separate TiO2 nanotube films from Ti substrates in order to obtain freestanding TiO2 nanotube arrays, such as soaking in HCl solution with ultrasonic treatment or in a saturated HgCl2 solution,60,83 using a H2O2 solution to resolve the underlayer TiO2 for separation,88 through the evaporation of methanol to delaminate the barrier layer of the TiO2 followed by a small amount of bending of the anodized Ti foil to detach it.91 However, because of the fragile nature of the anodized TiO2 membrane, it is difficult to ensure the integrity during the transfer process and large scale production can be a problem. Electrochemical growth of TiO2 nanotubes on a transparent conductive substrate (FTO) coated with a Ti layer will solve this problem. Grimes and co-workers sputtered a 500 nm thick titanium film on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) through radio-frequency magnetron sputtering,86 with the increase in the thickness of titanium film, a very long vertically aligned TiO2 NT layer can be achieved on FTO.92 For direct growth of the TiO2 nanotube film, electroetching of the Ti layer should be complete, otherwise the leftover Ti film will impede any light passing through. How to further increase the sputtered Ti films on FTO and optimize the anodization conditions for perfectly arranged TiO2 NTs with the desired lengths and diameters is still worth investigating.
3. Applications in solar cells
3.1 Strategies of sensitization
The band gap of anatase TiO2 is approximately 3.2 eV, corresponding to 387.5 nm in the ultraviolet region and overlaps with many solar absorbing dyes, making it a very good photoanode material. The TiO2 and dye combination is one of the most important in utilizing solar energy and can extend the absorption spectrum to the visible region. The sensitizers that are effective with TiO2 include organic dyes,93,94 narrow band gap nanocrystalline such as CdS,95CdSe,96 and sensitization through atom doping to the lattice of crystalline TiO2 is also viable.97

Organic dye-sensitized solar cells. 
The conceptual dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was first reported by Grätzel et al. in 1991, who used organic dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 porous films as the photoanode and redox pair reactions of I3−/I2 couples to complete the circuit and an initial efficiency of 7.1%–7.9% was obtained.98 Since then, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing new dyes with increased molar absorption coefficients for visible light harvesting over the entire spectrum, and impressive solar cells efficiencies of 6%–11% have been gained.99–105Fig. 4 shows the structures of some typical organic dyes, the most efficient DSSCs so far still uses Ru-based dyes such as N3 and N719, with which the efficiency has been boosted over 11%.106,107 C101, as shown in Fig. 4, has a very high molar extinction coefficient in acetonitrile-based electrolytes, and is used to achieve a strikingly high efficiency of 11.0–11.3%. Using low volatility 3-methoxypropionitrile electrolyte or solvent-free ionic liquid electrolytes to fabricate solar cells, the efficiencies can be stably retained at about 9.0% and 7.4% respectively even after 1000 h full sunlight soaking at 60 °C.108 Another new dye, C104, with a higher molar extinction coefficient and excellent photochemical and thermal stability has been verified.109 These trials will greatly advance the practical applications of DSSCs.
 Fig. 4  Some efficient organic dyes and the corresponding photo conversion efficiencies. 
Developing new dyes with high molar absorption coefficients and a wider coverage of the solar spectral range is an ideal design for high-efficiency DSSCs,110,111 which can be realized by synthetic chemistry to tune the absorption range to the visible region and even to the infrared range. On the other hand, the surface modification of TiO2 materials is also promising in improving the efficiency of solar cells, such as COOH-functionalized Si nanoparticles112 and graphene incorporation,113 by which the charge transfer can be greatly facilitated.
As stated above, using anodized TiO2 nanotubes in DSSCs will shorten the electron transport distance and reduce recombination. Schmuki and co-workers demonstrated the first anodized TiO2 nanotube-based DSSCs, which uses N3 dye as the sensitizer, opening a new page for TiO2 NT-based DSSCs.114 The overall efficiencies have reached 2%–3% by using different lengths of TiO2 NTs with a more defined geometry,115 which is still far behind the conventional TiO2 nanocrystalline film-based DSSCs. In order to expand the applications of TiO2 NTs in DSSCs, perfectly ordered microstructures are required. Firstly, newly developed dyes should be tried with optimized conditions such as dye sensitization duration, concentration and annealing temperature etc. Ideally, dyes should cover TiO2 in as an large area as possible to ensure a closely packed monolayer without aggregation.
In TiO2 nanotube-based solar cells, the tube length and pore size has a direct influence on the solar cell performance. According to previous studies, by varying the tube length from 1 μm to 20 μm, the IPCE value increases gradually and attains a maximum value of 80% when the tube length reaches 20 μm.116 Other research shows that the overall efficiency of DSSCs reaches 2.88% using 20 μm tubes and is higher than the 10 μm and 30 μm tubes, which show efficiencies of 2.33% and 2.87% respectively. It is speculated that 20 μm is the optimum tube length for the highest efficiency as more electrons are photogenerated and there is reasonable electron transport distance. Too short a length cannot provide a large enough surface area to adsorb enough dye in the solar cell devices. Further increasing the tube length could result in the higher resistance between the TiO2 nanotubes layer and the Ti substrate, inducing more recombination sites that have a detrimental effect on the charge transport for longer tubes. Pore size is yet another significant parameter affecting the photo conversion efficiency. Previous studies have shown that for the same thickness of nanotube, reducing the pore size helps to improve the efficiency, which can be attributed to the enhanced specific surface area under a certain area of TiO2 nanotubes.26,115–117



Quantum dot (QD) sensitized solar cells. 
Although sequential organic dyes in TiO2 photoelectrodes are ideal to extend the range of light absorption in DSSCs,118,119 attempts to lower the cost and improve the stability of DSSCs for practical applications, still meet with limited success. Some low band gap semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdS120 or CdSe quantum dots121 can significantly improve the solar cell stability, and the material properties can be tailored by quantum confinement to alter the band gap for a wider spectrum response. These QDs adsorbed onto TiO2 materials have the capability of harvesting visible light so as to excite the electrons to their conduction band. The key requirement to transport the excited electrons to TiO2 is that the energy level of the conduction band is slightly higher than the conduction band of TiO2, which is the main driving force for the efficient charge injection. Fig. 5(a) shows the energy levels of some semiconductors, which provides the basis for choosing the possible semiconductors to sensitize TiO2 materials. For example, CdS has the band gap of 2.25 eV, and the energy level of the conduction band is higher than TiO2, so it can be an effective sensitizer for narrowing the band gap of TiO2.122Fig. 5(b) shows how the charge transfer process between CdS and TiO2 occurs: CdS absorbs sunlight and the electrons of CdS are excited to the conduction band, then the excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 for transporting the electrons to the external circuit. The process mainly relies on the slightly higher energy level of CdS compared to TiO2, which can accelerate the charge transfer between CdS and TiO2. The advantage of using QD sensitizers is that their band gaps can be tuned by changing the size of nanoparticles, providing new opportunities to extend the absorption spectra into a wider region.123,124 PbS,125Bi2S3,126 InAs,127In2S3128 and CuInS2129 have been extensively used in quantum dot sensitized solar cells. With proper surface modification, both charge injection and recombination dynamics can be tailored to increase the efficiency.130
 Fig. 5  (a) Band positions of several semiconductors in contact with an aqueous electrolyte at pH 1; (b) Schematic of the charge transfer process between CdS and TiO2. 
Semiconductor nanocrystals can be deposited inside TiO2 nanotubesviachemical bath deposition. For example, alternated immersion in solutions of CdSO4 and Na2S can generate CdS nanocrystals on the walls of TiO2 nanotubes.131,132 Moreover, cathodic reduction,133close space sublimation technique,134 organic linker assisted deposition,135,136spray pyrolysis deposition137 and electrochemical atomic layer deposition138 are also proposed in sensitizing TiO2 nanotubes. Scheme 2 represents a typical sensitizing process by using an organic anchor to enhance the absorption of nanocrystals onto the TiO2 NT walls.136 The CdS sensitized TiO2 nanotubes have attained a promising overall efficiency of 4.15% from photoelectrochemical cells.131
 Scheme 2  The process of linking CdTe QDs to TiO2 nanotubes. 
In QD solar cells, photodegradation of QDs should be seriously considered for prolonging the usage lifetime. Through coating a thin film of amorphous TiO2 around the CdS QDs sensitized electrode, both the solar cell performance and photostability are greatly improved: the solar cell efficiency reaches 1.24% with an amorphous TiO2 coating, but only 0.13% without the TiO2 coating, which indicates that the amorphous coating can be used to effectively block charge recombination paths. The short circuit current density of non-coated photoelectrodes gradually decreases with time using periodic illumination intervals, but the coated one shows no decay, ascribed to the passivation effect on the QD surface states.139,140 In addition, ZnS has also been used as a passivation coating to prevent QD nanocrystals from photocorrosion.141,142 The energy gap of CdSe is another candidate for solar cells applications, but its band gap of 1.7 eV dictates the light response falling only in visible region. Exploring low band gap semiconductors such as PbS (0.41eV) can extend the solar spectrum to the near-infrared region,135 and can thus be used for sensitizing TiO2 NTs.


Co-sensitization. 

Absorption spectrum matching is an essential prerequisite for the realization of highly efficient solar cells. A single sensitiser may not be able to achieve the entire absorption of solar spectrum, co-sensitization using two or more sensitizers has been proposed as an important design feature, which allows for a greater degree of solar light absorption,143–145 due to their different band gaps. For example, the band gap of CdS in bulk is 2.25 eV, meaning that only solar light below a 550 nm wavelength can be absorbed, while CdSe nanocrystals can extend the spectral absorption to 720 nm due to their relatively low band gap of 1.7 eV. However, the electron injection efficiency of CdSe is lower than CdS because its conduction band edge is below TiO2, which is detrimental to the electron transfer between CdSe and TiO2. To combine their respective advantages for strong light harvesting with a high electron injection efficiency, CdS and CdSe are used to co-sensitize a TiO2 photoelectrode and the efficiency can be dramatically enhanced. When CdS and CdSe were used to sensitize TiO2 in solar cells with a cascade structure, the Fermi level alignment occurred for redistributing these energy levels, both the energy levels of conduction and the valence bands of these three materials shows the order of TiO2 < CdS < CdSe. Therefore, under the solar light illumination, the TiO2/CdS/CdSe configuration exhibits a higher driving force for the injection of excited electrons, ascribing to the insertion of a CdS layer between TiO2 and CdSe, which elevates the conduction band edge of CdSe, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The excited electrons transfer from CdSe to CdS, then inject into the conduction band of TiO2, and the hole transfer complies with the reversed pathway. Fig. 6(b) represents the increased IPCE after CdS and CdSe quantum dot co-sensitization.141 It also shows that a different cascade combination of TiO2/CdSe/CdS has a very poor performance.

Doping. 
External sensitizers easily detach from the TiO2 surface, especially in highly corrosive and oxidizing environments. Doping has proved critical for optimizing charge separation and transport in the TiO2 bulk phase for narrowing the band gap to achieve visible absorption.146,147 Several metal or nonmetal elements are used as the doping agent to reduce the bandgap of TiO2, which can be realized by introducing impurities into the TiO2 crystal lattice so as to change the band gap of TiO2 or create new energy levels for visible light absorption.148 Various elements, C,147 N,146 I,149 and Nb150 have been incorporated into the TiO2 bulk phase to improve the photoelectric properties, and the doped-TiO2 exhibits enhanced stability. Till now, doped-TiO2 nanomaterials have not been widely studied in photoelectrical catalysis, and their abilities as potential solar cell materials will justify more trials.

3.2 
          TiO2
nanotubes based polymer solar cells

Polymer solar cells based on fullerene derivatives and conducting polymers have received widespread attention in recent years because of the their easy industrial production by solution-based roll-to-roll process.151–153Fullerene derivatives with a high electron affinity can be used as a strong electron accepter material which, coupled with p-type conducting polymers (for example, poly-3-hexylthiophene, P3HT) to make heterojunction solar cells154–159 achieved efficiencies of 4.5%–6%.160–162 By making a tandem solar cell architecture, the efficiency can be improved to over 6%.163–165TiO2, as a significantly cheaper electron accepter material, can replace the fullerene derivatives to create hybrid solar cells. Another driving force is that to form ordered heterojunction solar cells using conducting polymers and fullerene derivatives to further enhance the efficiency still remains a great challenge. TiO2 nanotubes provide a great opportunity to make ordered heterojunction solar cells in combination with p-type conducting polymers.
The traditional way to make the device is to blend nanostructured TiO2 and the conducting polymer (P3HT) to building up random hybrid p–n structures.52 Interface compatibility would be a key issue for hybrid p–n junctions that are prone to phase separation as it will inhibit the exciton separation, which would be more serious under long term storage under thermal or electrical stress. To improve the interfacial bonding strength, a self-assembly strategy was introduced to anchor carboxylated polythiophene onto the surface of TiO2 by carboxylic groups (Scheme 3(a)), the charge separation efficiency was greatly enhanced and it produced an overall efficiency of 2.1%.166 Other studies focus on engineering the surface of TiO2 nanorods, which use dyes as an interface layer between TiO2 and P3HT,167,168 and in situpolymerization inside the TiO2 nanotubes to provide better interface contact and higher coverage.169

The physical adsorption between an inorganic phase (TiO2) and an organic one (conducting polymer) is probably not strong enough for the long term operation of solar cells, considering the incompatibility of the two phases. Direct chemical bonding becomes necessary to increase the interfacial adhesion strength. Surface initiated polymerization on the surfaces of TiO2 is a good solution to the issue, where the conducting polymer is grown directly from the TiO2 surface, resulting in a perpendicular chain orientation and the chemical bonding of the conducting polymer to the TiO2 surface.170,171 For example, the chain-growth surface-initiated Kumada catalyst-transfer polycondensation was introduced to grow P3HT on silica surfaces for the fabrication of nanostructured hybrids between conjugated polymer and inorganic materials, as shown in Scheme 3(c), which shows a potential use in the development of heterojunction solar cells.172 A biomimetic catecholic monolayer containing pyrrole units was anchored onto a TiO2 nanotube, a very useful technique for initiating surface electrochemical polymerization inside nanoporous TiO2 nanotubes to make coaxial p–n nanohybrids in one step (Scheme 3(b)). These chemically attached p–n heterojunctions significantly improve the interfacial contact between p-type conducting polymers and TiO2, which is easily concluded from an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiment: with the modification of the biomimetic anchor, the charge-transfer resistance decreased.173 Chemical bonding will not only improve the interfacial contact and achieve a greater surface coverage of TiO2, but also bring about direct bonding which will shorten the electron transporting distance with minimal loss. Preparing conductive polymers on some substrates holds potential applications in hybrid solar cells, but how to effectively initiate surface polymerization of the target monomer and control over the architectures still remains a challenging problem.
4. Strategies for optimizing the structure of TiO2 NTs
Until now, the highest efficiency for pure TiO2 nanotube-based DSSCs is about 4%,26 which is far less than that for nanocrystalline TiO2 porous film, which has shown efficiencies of over 11%.107 The relatively low surface area of the nanotubes is responsible for the relatively low efficiency, in addition, the crystallinity should be improved and defects avoided during anodization.
4.1 Approaches for enhancing surface area

Secondary structures viaTiCl4 treatment. 
Anodized TiO2 NTs always have relatively smooth tube walls, so one aspect of research would be to improve the surface area so that more charge separation interfaces can be created to increase the sunlight absorption, which results in a higher charge-separation efficiency. For that, TiO2 nanoparticles can be attached onto both the outer and inner tube walls to create secondary structures, which is realized by either TiCl4 treatment174 or direct immersion in an aqueous solution of TiO2 nanoparticles.175 After treatment, more dye loading can be expected. Fig. 7(a–d) shows that after TiCl4 treatment, TiO2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on both surfaces which enables the tube walls to absorb a greater amount of dye. Obviously, TiCl4 treatment yields a significantly enhanced photocurrent density and results in a 5 times greater efficiency over non-treated nanotubes.86(Fig. 7(e)) In addition to oxygen plasma treatments, dye-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes exhibited an overall efficiency (PCE) of 7.37% under backside illumination.176 The creation of secondary structures can be further optimized, for example, anodizing micro-patterned titanium.

To further increase the specific surface area, a new strategy of engineering the titanium surface via laser micro-machining techniques, combined with conventional anodization is designed to fabricate TiO2 NTs arrays on a microstructured titanium substrate. Fig. 8 shows the SEM and FESEM images of the patterned titanium before and after anodization, the TiO2 NTs distribute on both the bottom surfaces and sides.177 These patterned TiO2 NTs can greatly enlarge the surface areas and result in an enhanced IPCE and photocatalytic ability. Moreover, the microstructures greatly improve the mechanical property of TiO2 NT films on mother Ti substrates, probably due to the scattered internal stress inside NT films.

Novel morphology by adjusting anodization conditions. 
A TiO2 mesosponge was prepared via a new anodization approach and selective etching strategy which can be used for high-efficiency DSSCs and photocatalysis,178,179Fig. 9(a, b) shows the TiO2 mesosponge layers via unconventional anodization. Two different constant voltages, with cycle scanning, was used for the anodization which was performed to fabricate bamboo-type TiO2 nanotubes, this novel structure provides a large amount of space for dye loading in solar cells.180 (Fig. 9(c, d)) Different from conventional anodization, the first anodization is carried out in a salt solution (NaCl) to construct microstructured titanium surfaces for enhanced surface roughness, and the second process is conventional anodization for the growth of the nanotubes.181 These hierarchical micro- and nanostructures on the Ti surface (Fig. 9(e, f)) have the potential to increase the surface area for more dye loading in solar cells. TiO2 nanotubes can be easily anodized, and TiO2 nanowires and nanoplates are also easily prepared, which provides a simple methodology for fabricating various TiO2 nanostructures.182 Further optimization of the nanotubes by changing the anodization parameters still has the opportunity to improve the performance of this material when used for solar cell devices.

4.2 Improving crystallinity
The crystalline form of TiO2 is crucial in determining the performance of solar cells. Anodized TiO2 nanotubes often possess negligible photoelectric properties due to their amorphous, crystalline structure. The crystalline form of TiO2 mainly depends on the annealing temperature which can have a significant influence on the photoelectric response.183Annealing at a proper temperature can not only improve the crystallinity, but will also reduce the gap of the grain boundaries and facilitate the connectivity between grains and eliminate the charge recombination sites. The temperature of 450–500 °C is the best range for anatase formation, while above 550 °C, a rutile phase appears which is not beneficial for electron conduction.117 So controlling the sintering conditions to keep the TiO2 materials as pure anatase crystals is crucial for the fabrication of high performance photovoltaic devices.
5. Flexible TiO2 nanotube solar cells
Transparent conductive glass is the most commonly used substrate to deposit TiO2 nanocrystalline film onto as the photoelectrode, but the poor toughness does not allow the production of flexible devices. Flexible substrates such as plastic materials or flexible metals can be used to replace FTO for flexible device applications.184
Nanocrystalline TiO2 particles on a flexible substrate
Plastic materials can be used for flexible DSSCs, but poor stability limits their applications in chemically corrosive and high-temperature environments. Metal sheets, like stainless steel185 or titanium186,187 can be also used to fabricate flexible DSSCs.
Top porous TiO2 nanotube based flexible coaxial nanohybrids
Because of the internal stress, TiO2 nanotube films can usually be easily peeled-off from the Ti substrate. They are very fragile either on a titanium substrate or as a self-supporting film. One approach to enhance the toughness of the material is to incorporate a soft phase to form interpenetrating structures to disperse the internal stress. Frank's group have reported the use of electrodeposition to fill the ordinary TiO2 nanotubes with p-type materials.188 However, conventional TiO2 NTs are not a good template and the electrochemical reaction also occurred in the cracks and spaces among the tubes, which retards the formation of highly ordered p–n heterojunctions. Porous TiO2 nanotubes with interconnected nanopores at the top and tubular structures underneath83,189,190 only allow electrodeposition to occur inside the nanotubes, and form highly ordered p–n heterojunctions. These nanopores on the surface play the key role to restrict the electrodeposition to only the inside of the tubes, where metals (Ni), semiconductors (CdS) and conductive polymers (PPy) can be deposited to form nanohybrid materials. Fig. 10(a) is an SEM image of the top porous TiO2 NTs, the hybrid materials are shown in Fig. 10(b–e), and the optical image of coaxial TiO2 NT-PPy nanowire materials in Fig. 10(f). Interestingly, the TiO2/metal and TiO2/PPy nanohybrids can be easily peeled off from Ti substrate and exhibit high flexibility. The composite film can be bent for many cycles without being cracked, which is amazing when compared with conventional fragile TiO2 NTs. It is expected that the composite hybrid structures hold significant potential in the formation of highly ordered p–n heterojunction materials for flexible solar cell applications.191

6. Summary and outlook

        TiO2
nanotube arrays on substrates (either Ti or transparent conducting glass) provide a superior platform for building up ordered heterojunctions for enhanced charge separation and electron transportation. The parameters of the TiO2 nanotubes can be finely tuned, allowing the optimization of device fabrication for different types of solar cells, such as DSSCs and TiO2 nanotube/polymer solar cells. Anodization conditions are being further optimized for desired structures, for example, tunable nanotube morphology, diameter, thickness and inter-tubular spacing, towards perfect alignment by the formation of top porous nanotubes. In terms of the surface area, TiO2 nanotubes are still incomparable with TiO2 nanoparticles. Different strategies have been developed to enhance the surface area, such as double-walled tubes or bamboo-type nanotubes, the creation of secondary structures on smooth tube walls (TiO2 nanoparticle decoration) or the fabrication of nanotubes on micro patterned substrates etc. A number of synthetic strategies have been developed to introduce nanocrystals or nanocrystal combinations onto TiO2 to extend the spectrum absorption of TiO2; to create chemical bonding between p-type conducting polymers and the TiO2 surface. As some of the approaches have begun to establish, the next step would be to use them for targeted device design with interesting materials. With the advance of novel sensitized dyes with high extinction constants and good stability, these dyes deserve trials on novel TiO2 nanotubular structures, so that their promising solar cell efficiencies can be explored. The deposition of p-type materials inside nanoporous TiO2 NTs can form perfectly ordered p–n heterojunctions, which induces amazing flexibility in the TiO2 NTs/polymer hybrids and is capable of fabricating flexible device in a single step. How to control the regularity during electrodeposition to enhance the conduction mobility remains a challenge and will require extensive trials.
