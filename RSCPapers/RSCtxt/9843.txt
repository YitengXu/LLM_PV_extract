    , Accepted 21st March 2022First published on 31st March 2022AbstractNowadays, several sustainable processes have attracted worldwide attention, such as photocatalytic environmental remediation, the generation of renewable energy (e.g. hydrogen production) and energy storage (e.g. lithium-ion batteries). For promoting these processes, one of the central issues is to develop novel and efficient materials. Recently, the ever obscure material-elemental phosphorus (especially crystalline red phosphorus and black phosphorus) has quickly become the pop star in these sustainable studies and continues to grow due to its advances in special molecular structure (various phosphorus atomic clusters as building blocks) and versatility in modifications. Currently, the further development of elemental phosphorus material is greatly limited by the following problems: it is still difficult to fabricate crystalline red phosphorus and bulk black phosphorus crystals via facile and sustainable methods; it is still urgent to unravel the rules of the mutual transformation between phosphorus allotropes during their preparation and applications; the understanding of their working mechanism during the sustainable processes is still incomplete. Therefore, based mainly on recent publications, herein, the history and molecular structure of elemental phosphorus are firstly summarized, then the current and newly arising preparation methods for elemental phosphorus (especially crystalline red phosphorus) are comprehensively covered.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the rapid development of the economy has aggravated the problems of environmental pollution and energy shortages; therefore, studies on environmental remediation and the production of clean energy and energy storage have attracted great attention, such as photocatalytic remediation and hydrogen production, as well as ion batteries, etc.1,2 For example, photocatalysis can convert solar energy into chemical energy (mainly as excited electrons and holes) and thus is widely used in the degradation of various pollutants3,4 and the spitting of water into green hydrogen.5 Secondary batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) work through moving lithium ions between the anode and cathode (mainly the insertion/extraction of Li+) for energy storage on small and medium scales.6 To promote these sustainable processes, one of the central targets is to develop the related functional materials. For decades, although great progress has been made in creating excellent photocatalysts and anode materials, there are still scientific barriers before the final industrial applications. For photocatalysts, they are greatly restricted by the shortcomings of the fast recombination of photo-generated carriers and unsatisfactory light absorption range.1,2 For secondary batteries, the electrochemical performance of lithium/sodium ion batteries largely depends on the anode materials with a high specific capacity and appropriately low redox potential.7 Therefore, it is urgent to develop environmentally friendly and highly efficient functional materials for important sustainable processes, especially for photocatalysis and lithium batteries, which show great potential for future applications.
Phosphorus, one of the most common and abundant elements on earth, makes up ∼0.1% of the Earth's crust.8 P (atomic number: fifteen) is a group-VA element with typical threefold coordination and is of great importance in chemistry, physics, ecology and biology.8 In general, elemental phosphorus can be divided into three allotropes: white phosphorus (WP, α-, β-, γ-P4 phase), black phosphorus (BP, bulk BP crystals and few-layer phosphorene), red phosphorus (RP, amorphous RP, Hittorf's or fibrous RP crystals).9 WP is the most active and is mainly used in organic chemistry.10,11 BP has a layered structure similar to graphene, which can be exfoliated into single- or few-layer phosphorene. Generally, the band gap of BP is 0.3–2.0 eV (varied with the number of layers), and it has high mobility at room temperature which was also found to be thickness-dependent; the highest value up to ∼1000 cm2 V−1 s−1 was obtained for a thickness of ∼10 nm.12 Therefore, it is often applied in field-effect transistors, photoelectric detection, solar cells, etc.13,14 Compared with WP and BP, RP is the most versatile elemental phosphorus. It is widely used in daily life and industrial production, such as flame retardants, smoke signals, electrocatalysis and chemical analysis, etc., due to its low cost, nontoxicity, easy availability and high stability.8 In recent years, novel and interesting functions have been developed for RP-based materials, e.g., photocatalysis (benefiting from its narrow band gap (1.5–2.4 eV))15 and secondary batteries (benefiting from its high theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mA h g−1).16,17 Above all, crystalline elemental phosphorus allotropes (BP and RP) have become pop stars in several typical sustainable processes due to their special physical and chemical properties.
Nowadays, one of the central problems for the development of crystalline phosphorus materials is their harsh preparation processes, although the raw material is easily available. Amorphous RP is easily obtained, and its commercial chemical (ca. 90% purity) has a selling price of USD 2–10 per kg in the Chinese market. However, the preparation of bulk BP crystals mainly relies on the high purity of RP (99.999%), and the limitations of the preparation technology, e.g., the mechanism of BP crystal growth is not familiar, and the purity of the BP product18 causes the bulk BP crystals to sell at a price of ca. USD 1500 per g. In addition, although amorphous RP has a narrow band gap and can respond to visible light, its wide application as the photocatalyst is limited by the disadvantage of the high recombination of photogenerated carriers.19 Several examples have shown the great potential of crystalline RP (fibrous and Hittorf's phase) and RP-based materials as excellent photocatalysts.19–21 However, their complex and unsustainable preparation methods have also greatly restricted their potential as future candidates in photocatalysis. For example, in the typical preparation process for crystalline RP and bulk BP crystals, the precursors are usually encapsulated in a vacuum quartz tube and heat-treated, which is energy consuming, and they become explosive once they are mixed with air. Currently, the preparation of crystalline RP and bulk BP crystals via facile and sustainable methods is still difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully summarize and analyse the current preparation methods for crystalline elemental phosphorus, which is the base for their future applications.22–24 For this target, unravelling the rules of the mutual transformation between phosphorus allotropes during their preparation is still urgent. Besides, the working mechanisms of crystalline elemental phosphorus during the typical sustainable processes are still not comprehensive. Building a clear “structure–performance” relationship is still crucial for the development of phosphorus-based materials.
In this regard, based on very recent studies (Fig. 1), herein, we first briefly summarize the history and molecular structure of elemental phosphorus, then focus on collecting and demonstrating the current preparation methods for red phosphorus and black phosphorus crystals (mainly for crystalline red phosphorus). This is also what the authors would mainly like to contribute to phosphorus chemistry and applications. The application of elemental phosphorus in typical sustainable processes is also summarized and analysed, especially focusing on their working mechanisms at the molecular level. Finally, the challenges and future development of elemental phosphorus materials are discussed.

2. History and chemical structures of elemental phosphorus
2.1 Discovery of elemental phosphorus
In 1669, the German Merchant H. Brand mixed sand, charcoal, lime and urine (urine containing a large amount of dissolved phosphate), heated and evaporated in an air-closed bottle to produce gold when he accidentally obtained a soft white substance that could shine in the dark. H. Brand called it “cold fire”. It is known today as white phosphorus. Since then, the element has attracted public interest by demonstrating its ability to glow in the dark, called “phosphorescence”;25 however, phosphorus remained a strange chemical. It was not until the 1770s that it was shown to be a part of bone, and it was extracted from ashes by Swedish scientist C. W. Scheele.29 One day in 1843, Schrötter was summoned to the Vienna Institute of Technology for his discovery of red phosphorus, a substance of great importance to the scientific world. He presented his findings at the Vienna Academy of Sciences on December 9, 1847. Schrötter is generally recognized as the discoverer of red phosphorus, even though it was in other people's hands at the time.30 W. Hittorf first discovered Hittorf's phosphorus in 1865, also known as violet phosphorus.31 Its crystal structure was not clear until 1966 and was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) by V. H. Thurn and H. Krebs.32,33 In 1914, P. W. Bridgman, an American physicist, synthesized black phosphorus for the first time by using a high-pressure cubic anvil device to treat white phosphorus at high pressure (>1 GPa).34 Then, 100 years after it was discovered, Zhang et al. fabricated few-layer phosphorene exfoliated from bulk BP crystals and applied it in field-effect transistors (FETs).12 At the same time, P. D. Ye et al. used ab initio calculations to indicate that the band gap of phosphorene is direct, depending on the number of layers and the in-layer strain.35 BP returned to people's vision and which has attracted great attention especially in the field of material science.
2.2 Chemical structures of elemental phosphorus
WP is the most active allotrope of phosphorus consisting of tetrahedral P4 molecules. It exists in three different phases (α-, β- and γ-P4) at different temperatures and pressures. α-P4 is a plastic crystal at room temperature and it is difficult to obtain a single crystal.36 It is reversibly transformed to the β-phase at −77 °C. The quenching of the α-phase to −185 °C followed by a slow temperature rise causes an exothermic reaction to transform into the γ-phase and an endothermic reaction to transform into the β-phase at −120 °C.36,37 All unit cells of the three allotropes of white phosphorus are tetrahedral in structure; the crystallographic data are shown in Table 1. α-P4 is an important raw material for the synthesis of other elemental P and organic phosphorus compounds. Its large-scale application is limited due to its high toxicity and easy spontaneous combustion in air.10

RP may have numerous kinds of possible molecular structures ranging from cages to crosslinked networks, because of the trivalence of the P atom.38 In 1947, W. L. Roth et al. proposed the existence of five allotropes of RP, which were named types I–V. Among them, the available commercial RP (type I) is amorphous.39 Through literature reports, several possible linear molecular structures of amorphous RP have been proposed (Fig. 2a) but the structures are still unknown. In 2019, Zhang et al. obtained the possible structure of amorphous RP by quantum calculation (QM) of the theoretical single-molecule elasticities, and the experimental results were measured by monomolecular atomic force microscopy (AFM), from which the zig-zag ladder structure of amorphous RP can be inferred (structure 2 in Fig. 2a).38 Type II–V RP are all crystalline, where type II is hexagonal, type III is metastable, type IV is triclinic and type V is monoclinic. In 1966, V. H. Thurn and H. Krebs characterized the structure of type V RP by X-ray diffraction (XRD),32,33 as described by W. Hittorf in 1865,31 so type V RP is also known as violet phosphorus or Hittorf's phosphorus (Fig. 2b). In 2005, M. Ruck et al. first confirmed the structure of fibrous RP (type IV) by using single-crystal XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2c).40 The crystal structures of type IV and type V RP are similar in that they are composed of pentagonal tubular phosphorus chains (Fig. 2d), where four different subunits [P9][P2][P8][P2] are arranged periodically. The main difference is the way in which the tubes are connected at the [P9] unit. In Hittorf's phosphorus, the tubes are vertically connected to each other, whereas the tubes are connected in parallel to form a double-tube structure in fibrous phosphorus (as shown in Fig. 2b and c). Theoretical studies show that both structures are equivalent in energy, and that both structures can be obtained through similar synthesis pathways.33

Compared with WP and RP, BP has significant differences in physical and chemical properties due to its unique geometric structure, especially its low toxicity and thermodynamic stability. Under normal conditions, bulk BP crystal is a layered structure similar to graphite, and orthorhombic with space group Cmca (lattice parameters a = 3.313 Å, b = 10.437 Å and c = 4.374 Å).41 Each P atom is bonded with three neighbouring P atoms through sp3 hybridization to form a structure similar to a wrinkled honeycomb (Fig. 3).42 Each puckered layer can be regarded as two rows of parallel atomic planes where the P atoms are arranged in zigzag (Fig. 3b) and armchair (Fig. 3c) geometric shapes along the y and x-axes, respectively.13 BP has a mirror reflection symmetry in the y-direction, the bond distance (R1) of the top-to-bottom connection is 2.28 Å, and the corresponding bond angle (θ1) is 102.42°. The bond angle (θ2) along the zigzag direction is 96.16°, and the bond length (R2) of the nearest atom is 2.25 Å (Fig. 3d).43

3. Rules and methods for the preparation of elemental phosphorus
At present, the preparation of WP still follows the pyrolyzing process of phosphate ores via the J. B. Readman electrothermal method reported in 1888.44 The preparation of crystalline RP and BP is usually accompanied by the formation of WP byproducts, resulting in spontaneous combustion, explosion and other safety problems. A few reported methods for preparing crystalline RP, especially bulk BP crystals, are complicated and require complex equipment. The cost of crystalline RP and BP used in the laboratory is higher, which has been a major obstacle to its popularization and application. Therefore, this section will focus on introducing and summarizing the preparation methods and principles of crystalline RP-based materials and bulk BP crystals to inspire the development of new facile, low-cost and easy-to-scale preparation methods.
3.1 Preparation of red phosphorus-based materials
To date, the preparation of RP-based materials (especially crystalline RP) has mainly been classified into the following categories: solvothermal methods, high-energy mechanical milling, evaporation–condensation–crystallization strategies and other redox methods such as situ phosphorization reaction, etc.

3.1.1 Solvothermal method. 
The solvothermal methods of preparing RP-based materials usually use water or other organics (e.g. ethylenediamine (ED), etc.) as the solvent, including pre-treatment to remove the oxide layer (e.g. P2O5, etc.) on the surface of the RP precursor, and the solvothermal reaction process. Ren et al. prepared RP particles of less than 10 nm by hydrothermal and ultrasonic methods using commercial RP as a precursor and showed good degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation.45 Liu et al. constructed a direct Z-scheme heterophase junction RP/BP photocatalyst through a facile one-step solvothermal method using ED as the solvent. This promoted the effective separation of charge between the interface, and the photocatalytic splitting of water was realized without sacrificial reagents.46 In addition, various RP-based materials, such as Ni2P/RP,47,48 Co2P/RP,49 ZnIn2S4/RP,50 CdS/RP,51 RP/BP,46,52,53etc. were successfully prepared by the solvothermal method. However, it can be seen from Table 2 that crystalline RP cannot be prepared by the hydrothermal method. When the solvent is replaced with ammonium fluoride and other solvents, the activation energy of RP can be effectively reduced and the phase transformation process of RP can be promoted.54 Wang et al. prepared BP on a large scale using amorphous RP as a precursor at 120–200 °C via a recoverable liquid-phase method.55 The complete crystallization mechanism of RP transformation to BP was proposed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The basic unit P4 cluster of amorphous RP can be activated by an ED molecule, which causes the transfer of electrons from the HOMO of the ED molecule to the LUMO of the P4 molecule.55 There are three P–P bonds on the activated P4 cluster, two of which are short and one is long. The two activated P4 molecules are coupled to form a stable, symmetrical P8 unit, which acts as a template for extended growth and then grows in a certain direction into BP crystals (Fig. 4). The solvothermal method usually transforms RP into BP crystals, so it is not easy to prepare RP single crystals.55 However, the solvothermal method has low equipment requirements, relatively small energy consumption and easy amplification. Therefore, it is still of great value to further study and regulate solvothermal methods.

3.1.2 High-energy mechanical milling. 
High-energy mechanical milling (HEMM) is a simple and effective method for preparing nanomaterials and is widely used due to its advantages of repeatability, low cost and control over the process. It is possible to accomplish the controllable preparation of RP-based materials by changing the milling time, milling speed and amount of precursor. For example, Yu and Shen et al. fabricated a RP/BP heterojunction photocatalyst using commercial amorphous red phosphorus as a precursor by a simple mechanical ball milling method.56 During ball milling, BP grew in situ on amorphous RP and formed a good interface contact. H. J. Sohn et al. developed a facile method of transforming amorphous RP into orthorhombic BP crystals by the HEMM technique.16 It is believed that the temperature and pressure in the ball milling process can reach above 200 °C and up to 6 GPa, and these conditions are conducive to promoting the crystal transformation of amorphous RP to orthorhombic BP under ambient temperature and pressure. Kong et al. also prepared P/rGO–C3N4 by a simple HEMM method. Red phosphorus and the rGO–C3N4 framework were interlinked by the P–N bond and the P–C bond, forming an ion/electron diffusion channel and excellent mechanical structure.57 In addition, S. A. Ansari et al. also prepared RP with different particle sizes by changing the ball milling time,58 and this team also prepared materials with excellent performances by the same method, such as RP/g-C3N4 and RP/TiO2, which were effectively used in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants.59,60 In the past few years, several articles have been reported on the preparation of RP-based materials by HEMM, but most have been used for lithium-ion or sodium-ion battery anodes because the ball milling process is effective in forming the P–C bond, such as RP/C,61–64 RP/G (graphene),17,65,66 RP/CNTs (carbon nanotubes),67–72 RP/HPCNS (hollow porous carbon nanosphere),73etc.


3.1.3 Evaporation–condensation–crystallization strategy. 
The evaporation–condensation–crystallization strategy is widely used for preparing crystalline RP-based nanomaterials, which usually includes chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical vapor transport (CVT). In both of these methods, RP precursors are encapsulated in quartz tubes or other closed containers under inert atmosphere protection or vacuum conditions, and the target products are obtained by setting reasonable lifting and cooling procedures. The difference between them is that the CVD reaction usually requires a vapor deposition substrate, while the CVT reaction requires a transport agent (such as iodine, tin, etc.) and a driving force (such as temperature gradient, pressure gradient, etc.). However, both of them can produce RP nanoparticles with high crystallinity and uniform distribution, which are widely used in photocatalysis,19,21,74 electrocatalysis,75 lithium/sodium-ion batteries,76etc. For example, Yu and Shen et al. prepared a fibrous crystalline RP photocatalyst using commercial RP as a precursor through a “capsule” CVD method, which was first used for the photodegradation of organic pollutants (Fig. 5a and b).21 The mechanism analysis shows that the lattice matching between the substrate and product is the key factor in obtaining crystalline RP submicron fibers. By changing the reaction parameters, type II phosphorus submicron rod and Hittorf's phosphorus nanosheets were obtained. Later, this team grew micro-fibrous P on silica fibers in the same way (Fig. 5c) and broke the record for hydrogen production by elemental photocatalysts at that time.19 Recently, Liu et al. prepared triclinic crystalline red phosphorus (cRP) with a yield of up to 99% by a low temperature CVT method using commercial amorphous RP and iodine as precursors on a large scale.75 After ultrasonic treatment, cRP NPs with thickness less than 20 nm, length up to the micron level and width of about 120 nm were obtained (Fig. 5d–g). At the same time, the mechanism of cRP growth was analysed. It is believed that iodine reacts with amorphous RP to produce gaseous iodine phosphorus (PIX), which is transported to the low temperature nucleation side through a temperature gradient and then decomposed into cRP and iodine. In addition, Zhu et al. also prepared crystalline RP-modified and -doped TiO2 nanofibers by a similar CVD method.77 After ultrasonication and freeze-drying, the mixture of RP and TiO2 nanofibers was sealed in a quartz tube. By changing the calcination mechanism, amorphous RP went through the vaporization–precipitation–crystallization process to obtain crystalline RP-modified and -doped TiO2 nanofibers. Recently, Hu et al. prepared crystalline fibrous phase red phosphorene and crystalline RP microrods by the CVD method using high purity RP and RP with hydrothermal treatment as precursors.78,79 In recent years, various RP-based nanomaterials have been prepared by changing the precursors, reaction pressure and calcination mechanism, such as, crystalline elemental RP,19–21 RP/TiO2,77,80,81 RP/C,82–85 RP/g-C3N4,86–88etc. Table 2 also shows that the evaporation–condensation–crystallization method is an effective method for preparing crystalline RP, because the tubular RP is destroyed to form P4 gas molecules at high temperatures, and the P4 molecules recombine to form BP nanosheets (under high pressure or in the presence of catalysts) or tubular crystalline RP materials.89 However, this method requires the encapsulation of precursors such as RP in quartz tube, and the encapsulation process has high technical requirements for researchers. Once air is mixed in the sealed process, O2 will react with gaseous P4, causing the pressure to rise instantly and the quartz tube to explode. After the reaction, there may be a small amount of WP in the quartz tube. To avoid the spontaneous combustion of WP, it is best to break the quartz tube in water and remove the product.

There are simple devices that can be used in the laboratory to seal quartz tubes under atmospheric or vacuum encapsulation, and the devices can realize multiple gas replacements and atmospheric encapsulation, greatly improving reaction safety (Fig. 6a). The operator assembles the device according to the figure, and realizes the replacement of gas by opening and closing valve 1 and valve 2. When valve 1 is opened and valve 2 is closed, the tube is pumped into a vacuum. On the contrary, when valve 1 closes and valve 2 opens, argon can be filled into the tube. After repeated operation, the air in the tube is removed and the quartz tube can continue to be fused by hydrogen and oxygen flame. It also provides another direct vacuum sealing method of stretching, “cucurbit” (Fig. 6b). The operator removes the air from the unit, then heats the quartz tube with an oxyhydrogen flame and, when it starts to melt, pulls it out to make a closed quartz tube reactor. Although this method is simple to operate, the uneven vacuum distribution in the calcination process causes the growth of phosphorus crystals in the melting sealing end, which is not conducive to the epitaxial growth of crystals. It is also possible that an excessive length of cucurbit will make the tube wall thin and increase the insecurity of calcination.

3.1.4 Other methods. 
In addition to the above methods, the preparation of RP-based nanomaterials using phosphorus halides and sodium hypophosphite as precursors has been developed in recent years. For example, Tuan et al. prepared amorphous RP nanoparticles (RPNPs) in the size range of 100–200 nm by the reaction of PI3 and ethylene glycol on a large scale in the presence of CTAB and under ambient conditions.90 Recently, this team prepared a pitaya-like Sb/P compound using P(SiMe3)3 as the precursor system by a simple chemical precipitation method.91 Zhou et al. successfully prepared hollow porous amorphous RP nanospheres (HPNs) via a facile wet chemical method by using NaN3 to reduce PCl5 in toluene at 280 °C for 12 h.92 A gas-bubble-directed hollow-nanosphere-formation mechanism was proposed. At the initial stage of the reaction, the generated P nuclei covered the surface of NaN3. With increasing N2 bubble size, the P nuclei were continuously supplied at the interface between NaN3 and bubbles and gradually gathered near the surface of the bubbles. Finally, the bubbles separated from the surface of NaN3 to form hollow phosphorus nanospheres. The porous shell was caused by the disordered accumulation of P nuclei in the P shell; with the decrease in temperature and system pressure, the gas bound by the P shell was released, thus forming a porous shell. Zhao et al. prepared g-C3N4/RP/MoS2 ternary composites via step-by-step thermal deposition using sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source, in which RP was the flaky monoclinic phase crystalline with a size of ca. 10–30 nm.93 Recently, Chen et al. also prepared 2D/2D RP/CN van der Waals heterojunctions by an in situ phosphating reaction with sodium hypophosphite as the phosphorus source on a CN substrate.94 RP is a standard monoclinic phase nanosheet with a thickness of ca. 4.6 nm. The mechanism can be explained by the decomposition of NaH2PO2 into PH3 and Na2HPO4 during the heating process, and further dehydration of Na2HPO4 into Na4P2O7. When the amount of NaH2PO2 was sufficiently high, the doped P atoms acted as nucleation centers for the growth of RP. The RP nanosheets were finally formed due to the “confinement effect” of CN nanosheets.

3.2 Preparation of bulk black phosphorus crystals
The preparation method of crystalline RP is closely related to bulk BP crystals in principle. In this review, we also briefly introduce the main preparation methods and examples of bulk BP crystals in which it is possible to obtain crystalline RP-based materials by improving and adjusting the existing synthesis methods of bulk BP crystals. To date, a variety of synthesis methods have been developed. The earliest preparation of BP dated back to 1914 when P. W. Bridgman first converted WP to BP under the conditions of 1.2 GPa and about 200 °C.34 Unlike WP and RP, BP has high chemical stability. In addition, the two important factors that affect the large-scale synthesis of BP are the harsh reaction conditions and the impurities produced by the reaction, which usually result in very small crystal particles. Next, he explored a way to directly convert RP to BP at room temperature, but this method required higher pressures (4.5/8.0 GPa).95 Since then, scientists have developed many methods to synthesize BP based on high temperature and high pressure but these methods are only suitable for small-scale laboratory preparation with low yield. The two important factors that affect the large-scale synthesis of BP are the harsh reaction conditions and the impurities produced by the reaction, which usually result in very small crystal particles. In the 1950s and 1960s, some new milder methods were developed, such as the mercury or bismuth-flux method. For example, H. Krebes et al. made use of the catalytic effect of mercury on WP at high temperatures.96 In this method, the melted bismuth is poured on WP (WP was purified and distilled with 15% HNO3), and then the mixture is heated to 400 °C and held for 20 h. Finally, bismuth solids are dissolved with 30% HNO3 to obtain a 5 × 0.1 × 0.07 mm3 needle or rod-shaped BP single-crystals along an axis. In 2007, T. Nilges et al. developed a CVT method without the use of toxic catalysts, which further improved the yield and crystallinity of BP at low temperature and low pressure.97–99 BP was prepared from RP by a short distance gas phase transfer reaction with Sn and SnI4 as mineralizers.100,101 RP, Sn and SnI4 were sealed in a vacuum quartz tube as precursors and heated to 650 °C. Finally, BP single-crystals were obtained at the cold end of the quartz tube (Fig. 7a). To further understand the growth mechanism of this method, Wang et al. studied the growth process of BP at different stages (Fig. 7b).102 During the temperature increase, RP reacted with SnI4 to form a P–Sn–I ternary compound, which acted as the growth nucleation center of BP micro-ribbons. As the temperature increased, with the help of SnI2 acting as a mineralizer, the gas was compressed and deposited at the bottom of the quartz glass tube, and the stability and metastability of phosphorus vapor crystallization were improved. Since then, this team has also proposed a number of experiments to fully understand the growth of BP crystals and to explore the role of metals (alloys) and iodine in the growth process, and found that I2 is indispensable for the growth of BP crystals.103 In addition to Sn, BP crystals can be grown through other metals such as Pb, In, Cd, and Bi (Fig. 7c). They concluded that I2 and other compounds acted as mineralizers during the growth of BP crystals. In the process of crystal growth, the role of mineralizers is mainly to improve the solubility and promote the transport of phosphorus. At high temperatures, certain metals (or alloys) dissolve phosphorus as a liquid, and the phosphorus precipitates and crystallizes to form BP crystals during an extremely slow cooling phase. S. Li et al. reported a new method for preparing large BP crystals using Sn24P22−xI8 at low temperature and low pressure (Fig. 7d).104 First, the ternary compound Sn24P22−xI8 was prepared by vacuum encapsulating RP, Sn and I2 in a quartz tube through a series of heating procedures. Then, the prepared ternary compound and RP powder were encapsulated in a quartz tube by vacuum heating to obtain BP crystals. Sn24P22−xI8 was used as the nucleation center for the growth of BP crystals, and the layered BP crystals were formed at the location of the original ternary compound. Phosphorus cavitation in Sn24P22−xI8 played a “key role” in the formation of solid BP in phosphorus vapor. Zhu et al. revealed the growth mechanism of BP crystals through a systematic study of each growth stage.105 The growth process of BP was a step-by-step phase induction process. Without the assistance of any mineralizer, RP was first converted to Hittorf's phosphorus, which was then converted into BP during the subsequent cooling process. Importantly, Sn24P19.3I8 was the only nucleation center that allowed the nucleation and growth of BP crystals during the thermal insulation process. Recently, T. Nilges demonstrated by DFT calculations that BP crystals were formed at high temperature and with a quasi-catalytic amount of SnI2, whereas the formation of SnIP occurred at low temperature and with equal molar ratios of all the necessary elements.106 However, the above mechanisms were mainly based on different reaction conditions, and although some viewpoints may overlap, they only represent different reaction paths.

3.3 Section summary
This section mainly introduced the synthesis methods and synthesis principles of crystalline RP-based materials, and briefly introduced the related synthesis methods and synthesis principles of BP crystals. Both high-energy mechanical milling methods and solvothermal methods are relatively safe methods for preparing phosphorous-based materials, and the operation is facile and green, as compared with the evaporation–condensation–crystallization method. However, elemental phosphorus with high crystallinity cannot be prepared. In addition, the ball milling method is not mild and can destroy the morphology of materials in high-energy ball milling processes. To date, most researchers still use the evaporation–condensation–crystallization method to prepare high crystallinity elemental P-based materials. However, this method is not sustainable and requires vacuum or atmospheric encapsulation of the quartz tube, which has certain safety risks. In addition, the mechanism of crystal growth for this method is still not clear, and many of the proposed mechanisms are mainly based on theoretical calculations, and it is not easy to verify the CVD or CVT reaction under high temperatures and in a sealed environment. For example, the CVT reaction process is usually carried out in a closed quartz tube, and many intermediates in the reaction process are gaseous molecules, which are not easy to directly remove. The reactants taken out after cooling may have undergone chemical changes in the cooling process. Therefore, it is urgent to develop reaction devices and in situ characterization methods to verify the intermediate products of some key processes, to better understand the formation mechanism of crystalline elemental P to conduct the rational design and to develop a green and sustainable preparation route.
4. Elemental phosphorus and elemental phosphorus-based materials for photocatalysis
Photocatalytic reactions refer to reactions that occur when the semiconductor absorbs energy greater than or equal to its band gap width and electrons in the valence band (VB) are excited and transition from the VB to the conduction band (CB), forming photogenerated electrons and photogenerated holes in the CB and VB, respectively. Some photogenerated electrons and holes are combined inside the semiconductor and are dissipated in the form of heat energy and other forms of energy. The other part of the photogenerated electrons and holes with strong redox ability migrate to the semiconductor surface to complete a series of photocatalytic reactions, such as the splitting of water,2 the degradation of organic pollutants,21 bacterial inactivation,122 nitrogen fixation and the synthesis of organic compounds.123 Red phosphorus, especially crystalline red phosphorus, is a new kind of metal-free photocatalyst due to its suitable band gap (1.5–2.4 eV).15 Typically, photocatalysis can occur in the following:

Photocatalytic H

production:22RP + hν → e−(CB of RP) + h+(VB of RP)e− + H2O → H2 + OH−

Photocatalytic oxidation and degradation of pollutants:124RP + hν → e− + h+e− + O2 → ˙O2−h+ + OH− → ˙OH˙O2− + H2O → H2O2H2O2 → 2˙OHROS + pollutants → degradation of pollutants.
Therefore, this section will mainly discuss the application of elemental phosphorus-based materials in H2 production by photocatalytic water splitting, the degradation of organic pollutants, removal of heavy metal ions, and bacterial inactivation.
4.1 H2 production by photocatalytic water splitting
The photocatalytic splitting of water to obtain clean H2 is considered as one of the ideal ways to solve the global energy crisis and environmental problems.125 The most urgent task is to design and develop semiconductor photocatalysts with appropriate band structures to make full use of solar energy to meet the needs of oxidation and water reduction, and achieve high quantum yield and high stability. Elemental phosphorus-based materials, especially crystalline RP-based materials, have attracted extensive attention due to their advantages such as narrow band gap, low cost and widespread sources. More importantly, the initial wavelength of visible light absorption can be extended to 700 nm, which is conducive to fully utilizing solar energy for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, the slow charge transfer rate and the fast photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination limit the application of RP in photocatalysis. In this section, we will briefly describe the research context of the photocatalytic splitting of water by RP-based materials, and focus on the introduction and review of the latest achievements in the improvement of RP-based materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production.
In 2012, Yu et al. first found that RP could be used for the photocatalytic splitting of water.20 A layer of crystalline Hittorf's RP (monoclinic phase) nanorods on the surface was obtained by the vacuum deposition method (Fig. 8a–c). After crystallization, the absorption edge of RP shifted from 700 nm to 680 nm, and the blue shift was due to decreased imperfections and disordering of the structure. The band gap of Hittorf's RP was estimated to be 1.7 eV.20 Compared with amorphous RP (1.8 eV),126 the hydrogen production rate of crystalline RP was doubled under visible light irradiation and methanol as a sacrificial reagent. In the absence of methanol, H2 and O2 were produced stably under illumination, and the molar ratio of H2 to O2 was close to 2:1 (Fig. 8d). These results all prove that H2 came from the photoreduction of water. Trace levels of PO43− and HPO42− were detected (Fig. 8e), which proved that the photocatalyst was stable. According to the general rule of the “structure–property” relationship, the further study of other crystal and molecular structures of RP polymorphs as the semiconductor photocatalysts is very attractive. In 2016, Yu and Shen et al. prepared submicron-sized fibrous RP on photoinactive SiO2 fibers (called micro-fibrous P/SiO2) via the CVD method (Fig. 8f–h),19 then smashed them into microstructures (called “smashed-fibrous P”). The microstructures of fibrous P in micro-fibrous P/SiO2 and smashed-fibrous P are extensively in contact with water, making it have a high activity of photocatalytic H2 production. The H2 production rate of micro-fibrous P/SiO2 was 633 μmol h−1 g−1, and the smashed-fibrous P was 684 μmol h−1 g−1. The values were 1055/11138 and 396/427 times higher than those of amorphous RP and Hittorf's RP under the same conditions. This rate also broke the record of the H2 production rate of the elemental photocatalysis family at that time (Fig. 8i). The experimental and DFT calculation results attributed the high photocatalytic H2 production activity of fibrous RP to the following factors: high conduction band minimum (CBM) (−0.9 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode)), the microstructure, and faster charge transfer efficiency.

The disadvantages of RP, such as the low separation and transport efficiency of photogenerated carriers, limit its wide application in photocatalysis. The construction of heterojunction and hetero-phase junction photocatalysts with TiO2,77,116 g-C3N4,74,93,94,127,128 and BP46,108,109 is usually an effective way to overcome this shortcoming. For example, Yang et al. constructed the RP/P5+-doped TiO2 heterojunction photocatalyst by a simple evaporation–condensation method.77 By optimizing the amount of RP, the HER activity of the photocatalyst in pure water could be enhanced. Recently, this team successfully grew [001]-oriented Hittorf's phosphorus (HP) nanorods on polymer carbon nitride (PCN) through a simple CVD method (Fig. 9a–c).74 Theoretical and experimental results showed that the strong electron coupling between [001]-oriented HP nanorods and PCN enhanced visible light absorption, greatly accelerated the separation and transfer of charge carriers, and was beneficial for enhancing the HER performance of the photocatalyst. Before this, Yu et al. prepared nano-fibrous crystalline RP-modified g-C3N4 by a one-step template-free CVD method.86 P-Atom doping into g-C3N4 can reduce the defects in g-C3N4 and suppress the recombination of charge. The formation of P–C bonds and P–N bonds made tight contact between RP and g-C3N4, which promoted the effective separation of charge and greatly improved the HER performance under visible light (2565 μmol h−1 g−1). Although the above methods can overcome the shortcomings of RP, they all need to go through the process of quartz tube sealing, which is not conducive to the large-scale development of catalysts and increases the risk of experimentation. However, Chen et al. constructed the RP/BP hetero-phase junction photocatalyst using purified commercial RP as a precursor by a facile and safe wet-chemical method.46 They believed that solvent played an important role in the phase transfer process, and RP can only be successfully transformed into BP in ethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine solvents, but cannot be transferred in ethanol, water and other solvents. The prepared catalysts were ultrathin sheet structures with a size of 50–200 nm, and HR-TEM clearly showed the formation of the hetero-phase junction of amorphous RP and BP (Fig. 9d). Meanwhile, the work functions of RP and BP were calculated to be 5.11 eV and 4.34 eV, respectively. Since the charge transfer between the two semiconductors at the interface depends on their work function, the electrons in the BP will flow to the RP until their Fermi levels reach equilibrium. Therefore, an internal electric field was formed at the phase interface of RP and BP, which accelerated the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers through the Z-scheme transport path. However, the bands of RP and BP matched well and formed a direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system (Fig. 9e and f). The HER of the BP/RP hetero-phase junction in pure water without sacrificing reagents reached 0.33 mmol h−1 g−1, which was 3.3 times that of pure RP. The HER can be further increased to 2.96 mmol h−1 g−1 and 1.21% at 420 nm when non-noble metal Co is loaded with 1.4 wt% as the co-catalyst. Later, they constructed BP/RP quantum dots with the Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism by the same method. The HER in pure water without a sacrificial reagent was 3.66 mmol h−1 g−1 by loading 2.0 wt% Co as the co-catalyst. Among the several cases discussed above, it is interesting to find that several cases of photocatalytic hydrogen production were carried out in pure water without sacrificial reagents. Although the addition of methanol, TEOA, lactic acid and Na2S/Na2SO3 to the reaction solution will improve the photocatalytic HER activity, it will also increase the cost of the reaction and is not conducive to large-scale application.

Table 3 shows that the precious metal Pt, which is expensive and rare, is usually selected as the cocatalyst of RP-based photocatalysts. The use of a large amount of Pt can also increase the preparation cost of RP-based materials and limit their large-scale application. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a wide range of sources, inexpensive and efficient cocatalysts, such as Ni2P, Co2P, etc. to promote the wide application of RP-based materials. For example, Liang et al. prepared 0D/2D Ni2P quantum dots/RP nanosheets via a simple and mild in situ hydrothermal method using ball-milled RP and nickel chloride as precursors.47 Highly dispersed Ni2P quantum dots grew on the RP nanosheets and formed a p–n junction on the contact surface between them. The 0.1 Ni2P/RP photocatalyst exhibited high photocatalytic hydrogen production activity (265.43 μmol h−1 g−1), which was 38.58 and 3.61 times that of pure RP and 1 wt% Pt/RP, respectively. Li et al. also prepared a Co2P/RP photocatalyst by an in situ hydrothermal method.49 The introduction of Co2P promoted the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, which provided a large number of active sites for photocatalytic hydrogen production. The visible light HER activity of 2% Co2P/RP was 5997.5 μmol h−1 g−1. Zhao et al. prepared MoS2-modified RP/g-C3N4 by a stepwise deposition method, and the combined action of MoS2 and RP improved the separation and transfer of charge of g-C3N4.93 Chen et al. also prepared a novel non-noble metal elemental S/P photocatalyst by the hydrothermal method.129 Under the irradiation of visible light to near-infrared light, the photocatalytic HER of this compound increased to 83.86 μmol h−1 g−1 due to the effect of S co-catalysis, which was 2.8 times that of pure RP.

Recently, our group treated amorphous RP with Cd(ClO4)2via a facile one-step method, simultaneously achieving the surface oxidation of RP and the in situ growth of CdCO3 on its surface.130 It can be seen from the XRD pattern that there were two forms of RP. The characteristic diffraction peaks at 15.38° can be ascribed to the (102) plane of the Hittorf's phase of RP (monoclinic) and the clear wide diffraction peaks at about 28°–35° can be attributed to the amorphous phase of RP (Fig. 10a). After the oxidation treatment, the particle size of RP changed from the micrometer to submicron or nanometer range and the surface of SO–RP became rougher than that of RP (Fig. 10b), which was attributed to the ultrasonic treatment of RP and was partially due to the etching of RP by perchlorate. As can be seen from O 1s XPS spectra, the surface oxidized RP formed P–OH bonds, while the intensity of the P–OH pond of 0.25CdCO3/SO–RP was increased (Fig. 10c), indicating a more significant functionalization of the RP surface. The oxygen atom formed a covalent bond with RP, which changed the band structure of RP and narrowed its band gap. The position of CB moved from −0.28 V to −0.65 V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE). Raising the CB position prolonged the charge separation. The changed CB promotes the formation of the heterostructure and interfacial electric field between RP and CdCO3, which further promotes the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers (Fig. 10d). The HER of the composite can reach 516.3 μmol h−1 g−1 under visible light irradiation, which is 17.6 times that of pure RP.

In the past few years, the application of novel BP-based materials (including zero-dimensional BP quantum dots and two-dimensional BP nanosheets) in photocatalytic hydrogen production of water splitting has attracted extensive attention. However, the preparation of BP-based photocatalysts requires exfoliated bulk BP crystals in low-dimensional 2D nanosheets or 0D quantum dots and then compounding them with other semiconductors through facile methods such as ultrasound, stirring and solvothermal, etc. It has also been reported in a number of recent review articles.23,131–134 Although some important achievements have been made, the photocatalytic hydrogen production performance and chemical stability of BP-based photocatalysts are still poor, which need to be further improved and developed.
4.2 Trial of photocatalytic wastewater remediation
With the development of industry and agriculture, water pollution has drawn great attention. In addition to traditional pollutants, many emerging pollutants have been detected in water, mainly including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs such as antibiotics, etc.), heavy metal ions, pathogenic microorganisms, etc. The traditional water treatment process is not highly efficient in the removal of these emerging pollutants.135 Therefore, it is urgent to develop new targeted water treatment methods. In recent years, photocatalysis, as a new advanced oxidation technology, has shown great potential in the treatment of emerging pollutants in water.136 However, the development of this technology is limited by two core problems in the photocatalytic process: on the one hand, most known photocatalysts have low utilization efficiency of sunlight; on the other hand, photocatalytic materials have few active sites, which cannot produce sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as ˙OH, ˙O2−, and H2O2, to oxidize and degrade pollutants.3,21 In addition, metal-based photocatalysts may release toxic heavy metal ions during the degradation process, resulting in secondary pollution. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a new type of visible-light-driven non-metallic photocatalyst for wastewater treatment. Therefore, in this section, we will focus on the research progress of elemental P-based photocatalytic materials in the fields of organic degradation, heavy metal ion reduction and bacterial inactivation.
In 2014, Yu and Shen et al. found that there were few studies on the “structure–property” relationship of crystalline RP-based materials and it had not been applied in the field of photocatalysis.21 They prepared a fibrous crystalline RP photocatalyst (Fig. 11a and b). As shown in Fig. 11c, in the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light (λ > 420 nm), the RhB degradation efficiencies of fibrous phosphorus submicron fibers and type II P submicron rods were 46.4% and 28.8% under visible light irradiation for 6 h. Compared with type II P submicron rods, the size of fibrous RP had higher photocatalytic intrinsic activity, which can be understood from the following two aspects: on the one hand, the visible light absorption of fibrous P submicron fibers was wider than that of type II P submicron rods which originated from their different crystalline phases and thus electronic structure. On the other hand, the layered structures of fibrous P promoted the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Later, Yu et al. prepared highly charge polarized single-crystal red P microbelts (PMBs) with the assistance of liquid bismuth nanodroplets via a thermal vaporization method (Fig. 11d and e).115 The unique charge polarization and distribution of electrons excited by light on PMBS caused electrons to gather at both ends of the micro-belt and carry a negative charge, while the middle part was positively charged (Fig. 11f). Compared with the random distribution of carriers, the activity of the removal of MO over the PMBs (k = 0.05878) was six times higher than that on amorphous RP (k = 0.00934). Li et al. prepared RP with a rough surface by a catalytic assisted hydrothermal method using Co2+ as a catalyst,110 and Ansari et al. prepared crystalline RP by a simple ball milling method.58 However, Sun et al. used NaH2PO2·H2O as a phosphorus source and prepared ultrathin RP nanosheets by a simple thermal deposition method. Compared with amorphous RP, both of them could enhance the degradation rate by narrowing the band gap of RP, improving crystallinity and specific surface area, but they were not ideal.119

Table 4 shows that another means for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency is to construct heterojunction photocatalysts by combining RP with other semiconductor materials, which not only improves the light absorption but also promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. For example, Yu and Shen et al. constructed the RP/BP heterojunction using amorphous RP as the precursor via simple mechanical ball milling.56 The in situ growth of BP nanoparticles in the RP matrix formed a good interfacial contact. The difference in their energy levels and the high carrier mobility of BP promoted charge separation and transfer. Therefore, compared with amorphous RP, there was higher photocatalytic degradation activity of RhB. Time-dependent fluorescence spectra indicated that the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) was the main active species for photocatalytic degradation. Recently, Wang et al. fabricated a novel non ˙OH leading multi-heterojunction TiO2–BiVO4–BP/RP film via combined ball-milling with a sol–gel hydrothermal method.53 The synergistic effect of the in situ junction and Z-scheme promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers and maintained a strong redox potential, which made the system have a strong degradation and defluorination efficiency on fluxapyroxad (FLX). The photodegradation efficiency can be greatly improved by combining RP with other semiconductors, especially crystalline RP. For example, Chen et al. proposed a novel method to modulate the band structure of Cr2O3 by constructing a heterojunction using P doping or crystalline RP fibers.118 Fibrous P grown in situ on oxide photocatalysts guaranteed intimate interfacial contact which promoted the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and reduced the combination of charge carriers. The trapping experiments of ROS in the photodegradation process showed that holes (h+) and O2˙− acted as the main ROS. Subsequently, this team used the same method to prepare a heterojunction of crystalline RP fibers and rutile TiO2.116 The heterojunction showed good photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen production activity under visible light. This was mainly attributed to the RP nanostructure grown directly on the TiO2 nanoparticles and formed the heterojunction with good contact. The synergistic effect of the heterojunction enhanced visible light absorption and promoted the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In addition, RP also modified the most common g-C3N4.87,88,137 For example, Wang et al. prepared the RP/g-C3N4 type I heterojunction by the CVD method using RP as the precursor. The composite showed good photocatalytic degradation against acute toxicity from category-III non-colored (MTSM, metsulfuron methyl) and colored compounds (RhB), and organic pollutants. The photocatalytic mechanism showed that the improvement of the photocatalytic effect was due to the formation of a type I heterojunction between RP and g-C3N4, which effectively transferred the photogenerated electrons from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of RP, and the photogenerated holes were not transferred. It should be noted here that the performance of the composite material is highly dependent on the interface contact degree of the two materials. Through the reasonable design of the synthesis method, an interface with close contact and good electrical conductivity can be obtained, which is conducive to the full performance of the RP matrix composite material. Some typical cases of elemental P-based photocatalytic degradation materials in recent years are summarized in Table 4 for comparison purposes, such as ZIF-67/RP,138 MoS2/RP,139 g-C3N4/RP,87etc.

RP showed good potential for microbial degradation in water.3,140 Yu et al. used purified commercial RP by a hydrothermal method to inactivate E. coli K-12 for the first time in visible light.3 By facile hydrothermal treatment, amorphous RP microparticles with a narrow band gap of 1.42 eV and a size of 2–10 μm with visible light response were obtained (Fig. 12a and c). Under sunlight, full band and visible light irradiation, the inactivation times for E. coli K-12 of 2 × 107 cfu mL−1 were within 60 min, 90 min and 120 min, respectively (Fig. 12b). LED light sources are considered to be the next generation of light sources due to their advantages of long life and energy saving. Therefore, in order to support the discovery that the reaction was carried out through the light absorption inside RP, the author used an LED light source to carry out the experiment where the inactivation efficiency was related to the wavelength of incident light. Light with the largest wavelength (610–650 nm) can activate RP, indicating that it can absorb the visible light to the maximum extent to inactivate E. coli K-12. The trapping experiments of reactive species showed that photogenerated e− and their derived ROS, ˙O2− were the main species that induced the decomposition of microorganisms (Fig. 12a). Microstructural changes in the bacteria and DNA genetic material tests showed that RP produced ROS to break the bacterial cell membrane and eliminate its genetic material. Later, this team prepared g-C3N4/RP hybrid nanosheets via a facile one-step sonochemical method.140 At the same time, g-C3N4 was removed and the size of RP particles was reduced. A large number of RP nanoparticles were anchored on g-C3N4 sheets by P–N bonds and the type I heterojunction was constructed. The construction of the heterojunction promoted interfacial charge separation and extended the light absorption to 700 nm, which greatly improved the HER and sterilization activity. A total of 107 cfu mL−1E. coli K-12 was inactivated within 80 min at a rate of 1.51 × 10−3 min−1, which was 1.58 and 6.23 times higher than that of pure RP and g-C3N4, respectively.

In heterojunction photocatalysts, photogenerated carriers are transferred not only along the surface of each semiconductor but also at its interface. The effective transport of photogenerated carriers at the heterogeneous interface plays a significant role in improving the photocatalytic activity.141 Inspired by this, Prof. Wu et al. also constructed several heterojunction photocatalysts for photocatalytic bacteria inactivation.142–144 They constructed RP/ZnO heterojunction films to drive ROS production and improve the photothermal performance of solar energy to achieve rapid sterilization under sunlight and LED light.142 The heterojunction films were prepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of RP films and then by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO nanofilms on RP layers (Fig. 12d). The (001) plane crystalline fibrous RP and (002) plane wurtzite ZnO form a compact heterojunction (Fig. 12e). Therefore, due to the relatively stable structure between RP(001) and ZnO(002) and the optimized geometric lattice matching, the ZnO(002) plane may be heteroepitaxially deposited on the RP(001) plane. The process of charge transfer and separation in the RP/ZnO heterojunction was investigated by theoretical calculations, and a 3D charge density difference plot of the RP(001)/ZnO(002) interface was obtained. The results showed that the charge distribution mainly occurs in the RP(001)/ZnO(002) interface region (Fig. 12f and g). Therefore, electrons can be transferred from the RP(001) side to the ZnO(002) surface through the interface. The effective electron transfer path can prolong the life of photogenerated electrons and enhance the photocatalytic performance. In addition, they successfully prepared crystalline phosphorus films on titanium plates by the CVD method using cheap commercial RP as the precursor, then deposited graphene oxide (GO) on RP films to build the Ti–RP/GO compound, and improved the photochemical (PEC) properties and rapid sterilization activity.143 Recently, Wu et al. prepared novel red phosphorus nanoparticles (RPNPs) by the CVD deposition of RP on ZnO surface, acidification and ultrasonic treatment.144 The RPNPs were approximately 60 nm in diameter and had a band gap of 1.54 eV. Compared with RP (2.06 eV), the light absorption range of RPNPs is larger, which is beneficial to the photocatalysis and photothermal response of the material. Under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, a large amount of ROS (˙O2− and ˙OH) is produced, and combined with the excellent photothermal effect of RPNPs it causes serious damage to the bacterial membrane of Staphylococcus aureus, and the antibacterial efficiency can reach 99.98%.
In addition to the degradation of organic pollutants and inactivation of bacteria, RP-based materials can also reduce highly toxic Cr(VI) ions to Cr(III) by the photogeneration of electrons. For example, Li et al. prepared nano-sized RP by hydrothermal and ultrasonic methods, and studied its photocatalytic performance for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).145 Under visible light irradiation, Cr(VI) at an initial concentration of 20 mg L−1 can be completely reduced within 36 min at pH = 2.0. Su et al. constructed the Bi2O3/HRP heterojunction photocatalyst by a hydrothermal method, which showed strong photoreduction ability. Here, 40 mg L−1 Cr(VI) was reduced within 30 min with a rate constant that was 14.9 and 50.0 times that of pure HRP and Bi2O3, respectively.146 Due to the complex types of pollutants in actual industrial wastewater treatment, photocatalysis can remove a variety of pollutants at the same time to meet the practical needs. Therefore, simultaneous photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) and oxidative degradation of organic pollutants is a potential method for the future treatment of industrial wastewater. Liu and Fan et al. reported that a variety of RP-based heterojunction materials, such as RP/RP–MoS2/rGO,111 MoS2/RP,139 RP/SnS2147 and RP/g-C3N4,148 can be used for the simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of Cr(VI) and RhB. The improvement of the photocatalytic performance can be attributed to the improvement of the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and light capture ability.
Black phosphorus, another allotrope of phosphorus, can also be used as an environmentally friendly two-dimensional layered semiconductor for environmental remediation such as photocatalytic degradation or oxidation of pollutants, bacteria inactivation, etc.23,131,134 It is worth noting that the stability of low-dimensional black phosphorus is the key factor for its large-scale application in the field of photocatalysis. Due to the lone pair electrons in the phosphorus atom, the low-dimensional BP structure is thought to be highly active in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, the long-term stability of BP-based materials under photocatalytic conditions can be improved, which is very meaningful for improving the practical value.
4.3 Advances in other emerging fields of photocatalysis
In other emerging fields of photocatalytic research, RP-based materials were also applied in CO2 reduction but there are few studies on this. For example, Xue et al. prepared RP/g-C3N4 composites by simple heat treatment and used them for photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction, which significantly improved the yield of CH4.149 Due to the boundaries between particles inside amorphous P, the charge transfer limits the enhancement of CO2 reduction. Recently Hu et al. prepared fibrous red phosphorene and crystalline RP micro-rods via the CVD method by controlling the purity of the RP precursors, and they were used for the first time in the reduction of CO2.78,79 The activity was about 10.5 times higher than that of commercial amorphous red P. The charge transfer efficiency was remarkably improved, which was confirmed by transient absorption spectra and electrochemical measurements. The theoretical calculation results of the 2D RP fibre showed that the band gap range was 1.43–1.54 eV, which was very suitable for photocatalysis. In contrast to black phosphorene, the band gap increased only slightly by stripping down the number of layers of fibrous RP, again in the range of 1.43 to 1.54 eV. Due to the obvious improvement in the charge transfer efficiency of 2D fibrous red phosphorene, the CO production rate of fibrous red phosphorene in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiment was about 62.7 μmol g−1 h−1, which was 2.85 times higher than that of bulk fibrous RP.78 We also think RP-based photocatalysts have great potential in other fields, such as the photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia.
4.4 Section summary
In this section, we summarize the research progress of elemental P-based materials, especially RP-based materials, in the fields of photocatalytic hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. The main progress and important cases in the study of RP-based photocatalytic materials since 2012 are listed in the form of a table. Because RP is non-toxic, widely available, inexpensive and has good light absorption, the photocatalytic performance can be greatly improved by simple modification. Therefore, further study of RP-based materials is of great value. The following strategies should be noted to promote the photocatalytic performance of RP-based photocatalysts:
(1) Improving the crystallization of RP can reduce defects or expose certain crystal faces to improve the efficiency of photocatalysis, but the low separation and transport efficiency of photogenerated carriers still exist. In addition, the preparation method of crystalline RP is complicated, and the development of high-crystallinity Hittorf's phosphorus and fibrous RP still faces great challenges.
(2) The construction of heterojunctions with other semiconductors can effectively improve photocatalytic efficiency; however, the problem of semiconductor band matching is worth noting. From the perspective of interface regulation, the internal electric field between interfaces can be constructed by constructing p–n junctions or by other methods, such as the RP/BP hetero-phase junction, to improve the transfer efficiency of photo-generate charges.
(3) It is necessary to explore the deactivation mechanism of RP-based materials in photocatalytic reactions, such as the influence of photogenic oxidizing species on the stability of RP-based photocatalysts, and improve the chemical stability of RP by means of edge chemical bond modification and RP coating.
(4) The applications of RP-based materials in other emerging photocatalytic fields, such as CO2 reduction and nitrogen fixation, should be further developed.
5. The application of elemental phosphorus-based materials in energy storage
With the aggravation of the global energy crisis and environmental pollution, photocatalysis and other energy conversion technologies have been rapidly developed, which will promote the large-scale application of low-cost, environmentally friendly, portable and high-capacity energy storage devices.70,157–159 Therefore, the development of efficient lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) and other electrochemical energy storage devices will be an important topic for future research. LIBs are widely used in mobile phones, laptops and other portable devices due to their advantages of high safety and long lifetime. However, their wide application in the power battery market, such as in new energy vehicles, is limited by disadvantages such as slow charging speed, low specific capacity and high price.160,161 Therefore, SIBs have become one of the candidate materials for large-scale energy storage due to the advantages of low cost, abundant stock and widespread sources of sodium ions.24,124 The electrochemical performance of lithium/sodium ion batteries largely depends on the electrode materials. Although many excellent cathode materials have been widely used, the development of anode materials still faces great challenges. Phosphorus can perform electrochemically both in lithiation and sodiation with a competitive theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mA h g−1. Thus, it is a promising anode material for the lithium/sodium ion battery.6
5.1 Recent research progress on phosphorus/carbon materials as LIBs anode materials
Elemental P is a potential anode material; if lithium and phosphorus undergo a complete alloying reaction, 3Li + P → Li3P, its theoretical specific capacity can reach 2596 mA h g−1. In addition, during the cycle, LixP (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), the intermediate product of the lithium process, will not dissolve in the electrolyte and can also be reversible. The lithium reaction of BP is similar to that of RP. The difference is that the lithium reaction of RP consists of only one step of alloying, while the lithium reaction of BP consists of two steps of insertion and alloying.6 At present, the development of RP-based anode materials is faced with two important issues: (1) during the insertion/extraction of lithium ions, the volume expansion of RP (∼330%) will occur; (2) the electronic conductivity of RP is too low, about 10−14 S cm−1. This will lead to electrode fracture in the cycling process, resulting in fast capacity fading and poor electrochemical performance at a high current density. Carbon materials have high electronic conductivity, which can improve the overall electronic conductivity of composites.84 In addition, the design of porous carbon as the host can reduce the overall expansion of the active material. Therefore, it is of great significance to control the size of activated carbon on the nano-scale and assemble it into the host RP to promote the development of RP-based anode materials.
High energy ball milling is an effective method for assembling and compounding RP and C materials.65 For example, Liu et al. prepared fluffy carbon from popcorn (rice flowers) and then mixed it with RP to synthesize carbon-coated RP with a stable structure through simple mechanical ball milling (FC@RP).64 In the ball milling process, it was easy to break the fluffy carbon and exfoliate it into carbon nanosheets. Then, under the action of shear force, the carbon nanosheets were uniformly coated on the surface of RP particles and formed the P–O–C bond, greatly improving the stability of the material (Fig. 13a–c). Introducing fluffy carbon onto RP can not only improve the conductivity but also improve the charge transfer kinetics to ensure the integrity of the electrode. When the mass ratio of FC to RP was 2:8, FC@RP showed excellent electrochemical performance as an anode for LiBs, and the discharge capacity reached 1655.9 mA h g−1 at 0.05C (1C = 2600 mA h g−1, based on the composites). After 1000 cycles, the reversible capacity could still reach about 1230 mA h g−1 (a capacity retention of 96%) at a reversible capacity of 1C.

Although the high-energy ball milling method can effectively prepare P/C composites, it is not mild and may damage the morphology of the carbon during the ball milling process.162 The evaporation–condensation–crystallization strategy is another effective method for preparing P/C composites. In the process of evaporation and condensation, P atoms can be arranged regularly to form a crystalline state. This method can also evenly mix the selected materials to improve the performance of the composites. Recently, Liu et al. designed and synthesized uniformly distributed honeycomb-like hierarchical micro–mesoporous carbon nanosphere (HHPCNSs)/P composites with ultra-large pore volumes (3.258 cm3 g−1) by a simple evaporation–condensation method (Fig. 13d).163 The uniform micro–mesoporous distribution of the HHPCNSs structure and large porosity caused the RP particles to load in a smaller and more uniform way, and provided enough space for the increase and expansion of RP loading. Therefore, as anode materials for LIBs and SIBs, it exhibited extremely high capacity (876.1 and 1674.8 mA h g−1 under 0.5 A g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively), splendid rate performance (842.2 and 831.1 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1 for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) and superior cycling stability (1201.6 and 938.4 mA h g−1, 1269.4 and 861.8 mA h g−1 at 2 and 5 A g−1 with capacity retentions of 80.1% and 75.7%, 81.2% and 70.1% after 1000 cycles for LIBs and SIBs, respectively) (Fig. 13e). Sun et al. focused on the two key issues of the low P mass loading limited energy density of LIB anodes and the safety of the evaporation–condensation method for the preparation of electrode materials by phosphorus loading.84 The interaction between P4 and various functional groups in carbon materials (Csurf, Cedge, C–N-5, C–N-6, C–Ng, C–S-5, C–S-6, CO, C–O–C, C–OH, and COOH) was systematically studied at the atomic level. The results showed that the edge structure of the carbon skeleton had strong adsorption on P4 gas molecules and formed strong P–C bonds at the interface between them, which can not only anchor P4, but also activate and accelerate the polymerization of P4 (Fig. 13f–h). RP nanoparticles can also be coated in this carbon skeleton, which provided a high RP loading (49.4 wt%) and safety (WP was not present), mainly due to the effect of edge carbon, which promotes the nucleation and polymerization of P4 to RP. In addition, the formation of strong and stable P–C bonds enhanced the interaction between RP and PC, thus improving the transfer of electrons and Li+, and avoiding the pulverization and shedding of RP in long-term cyclic reactions, which greatly improved the electrochemical performance of RP–PC84 (high specific capacity of 1187.7 mA h g−1 at 260 mA g−1 after 120 cycles, a cycling stability of 965.2 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 (equivalent to 1C) after 1100 cycles, and a high-rate performance of 496.8 mA h g−1 at 8320 mA g−1 (equivalent to 16.7C) after 1000 cycles, which were all calculated based on the total weight of RP and PC).
In addition to the difference between BP and RP in the storage mechanism of lithium, another difference is that the diffusion of lithium ions in RP is isotropic, while in BP it is anisotropic and mainly occurs in the second step of the alloy reaction. Therefore, during the development of BP-based materials, a unique structure with an appropriate size should be designed to overcome anisotropic volume expansion.6 Many researchers have been working to improve the rate performance by reducing the BP particle size, especially along the armchair direction, by shortening the diffusion distance of the high ion diffusion barrier. On the other hand, the introduction of defects and holes adjusts the adsorption binding energy of lithium and reduces its diffusion barrier, or provides channels for Li diffusion. Last year, a great breakthrough was made in BP as the active anode for high-rate, high-capacity Li storage. Ji and Duan et al. obtained a BP–G interface with covalent bonds by ball-milling the mixture of black phosphorus and graphite, which not only prevented edge reconstruction but also ensured the efficient insertion and diffusion of Li ions.160 A thin polyaniline (PANI) polymer gel coating polyelectrolyte was introduced by in situ polymerization to prevent the formation and accumulation of low conductivity lithium fluoride and carbonate. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was stabilized to promote the conduction of Li ions (Fig. 14a–c). X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements and DFT theoretical calculations showed that P–C bonds were formed on the edge of BP and graphite sheet (Fig. 14d), which inhibited the edge reconstruction of BP and allowed deeper and more reversible lithification of BP. The Li+ diffusion coefficients of the BP–G/PANI (7.5 × 10−13 cm2 s−1) and BP–G (4.5 × 10−14 cm2 s−1) anodes were one to two orders of magnitude higher than pristine BP (1.2 × 10−15 cm2 s−1) and BP/PANI (2.2 × 10−15 cm2 s−1), respectively. The author also studied the BP–G/PANI electrode and BP–G electrode on pristine samples and cycled through the time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to observe the chemical reaction at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte to prove the function of PANI. After the same cycle, the SEI signals of BP–G/PANI (LiO−, CHO−, and LiCO3−) were significantly lower than that of BP–G, indicating that the generation of SEI was suppressed (Fig. 14e–g). In addition, ToF-SIMS depth profiles from the cycled BP–G and (BP–G)/PANI electrodes were collected. These studies indicated that the PANI coating ensured a stable SEI and prevented the continuous accumulation of poorly conducting species, which may be largely due to the protection and mediation by a thin layer of PANI swollen with electrolyte (Fig. 14h). The capacity, rate and cycle durability of the prepared composite anode were greatly improved.

5.2 Recent research progress on phosphorus/carbon materials as SIBs anode materials
Although elemental P has good applications in the field of LIBs, the increasing shortage and uneven distribution of lithium resources make us increasingly concerned about our heavy dependence on it and have further stimulated researchers to explore the application of elemental P in other energy storage devices. In recent years, SIBs based on phosphorus electrodes have been developed rapidly because of their abundant reserves and similarity to lithium ions in chemical reaction mechanisms.24,124,164 Similar to the lithium reaction, RP can also react with sodium on the basis of 3Na + P → Na3P to form Na3P and provide a high theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1. However, the volume expansion of the RP electrode in the sodium process (∼440%) is larger than that of lithium (∼300%), but its solvation and desolvation are weak, which makes its kinetic properties better.165
The construction of a heterojunction can take advantage of different materials to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Recently, the application of RP-based electrode materials in SIBs has been promoted through the assembly of carbon materials and RP, by the advantages of low expansion and high electrical conductivity of carbon materials. For example, Liu et al. prepared a high-performance anode for SIBs by successfully reducing graphene oxide (rGO) with nanoporous red phosphorus (NPRP) through a typical process of redox reaction and boiling.166 Its nanoporous structure could accommodate the volume change and minimize the ion diffusion length, and the high electronic conductive network built on rGO sheets facilitates fast electron and ion transport (Fig. 15a). Therefore, it exhibited a superhigh capacity (1249.7 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at 173.26 mA g−1), superior rate capability (656.9 mA h g−1 at 3465.28 mA g−1) and ultralong cycle life (775.3 mA h gRP−1 after 1500 cycles at 5.12 A gRP−1). Zhou et al. designed and prepared a P/CNTs@rGO with a unique hierarchical structure with good electrochemical performance as an anode for LIBs and SIBs.66 First, CNTs were mixed with RP through the ball milling method to overcome the interparticle adhesion formation of large agglomerates and reduce the conductivity of the problem, and P/CNT were coated by a three-dimensional porous volume expansion space reduction graphene oxide (rGO), which not only achieved maximum conductivity in red P agglomerates but also provided volume variation space to relieve the pulverization issues. When the loading mass of phosphorus reached 70 wt%, it exhibited a specific capacity of 2189.1 mA h g−1 for LIBs and 2112.9 mA h g−1 for SIBs.

The introduction of carbon materials with different morphologies on RP can not only adapt to the expansion of phosphorus during the cycle but can also improve the electronic conductivity of the anode to improve the electrochemical performance. For example, Yao et al. synthesized hollow porous carbon nanosphere/red phosphorus (HPCNS/P) composites as anodes for SIBs via a nondestructive V–C strategy.73 Micropore-dominated HPCNSs had well-defined hierarchical porous structures with very large specific surface area and pore volume, and formed strong chemical bonds between the coated RP and HPCNs during the V–C process, so that Na+ could be maintained well during insertion/extraction. Real-time observation of the alkalization process is very important for studying the mechanism of the electrochemical reaction, to observe the sodification process and the mechanism of capacity decay of RP. Liu et al. synthesized red-phosphorus-impregnated carbon nanofibers.85 The alkalization process of Pred@CNF was analysed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the RP particles were softened in the sodium process, and had “liquid-like” mechanical behaviour. The corresponding chemical mechanical simulation showed that the influence of the volume change and fracture of RP was much less than that of the silicon anode in lithium ion chemistry (Fig. 15b–d). The coating strategy was also proven to be an effective way to avoid adverse reactions in the long-term cycling of RP anodes. In recent years, carbonized wood (C-Wood) has also attracted widespread attention because of its low bending, high porosity and good electronic conductivity. Han et al. carbonized Monterey pine (C-Wood) and successfully loaded a large number of RP particles onto porous C-Wood through the V–C method (Fig. 15e).76 As seen from the SEM image, with the increase in the amount of RP, the RP layer does not become thicker, but forms fibrous red phosphorus (Fig. 15f and g). Self-standing RP@C-Wood was used as an electrode without the inclusion of any polymer binders or metal current collectors. The red P@C-Wood electrode has a high red P mass loading of 8.4 mg cm−2 with an outstanding cycle life at high current densities (0.6 A g−1, 16.742 mA cm−2).
The sodiation process of BP is also similar to the lithiation process. The intercalation mechanism (no P–P bonds breaking) occurs at low sodium concentrations (Na0.25P), but changes to an alloying process with P–P bonds breaking.167 Since the conductivity of BP is much higher than that of RP, the composite of BP and carbon focuses more on relieving the huge volume expansion of the electrode and reducing the internal stress, to achieve a stable cycling performance. In addition, bulk BP cannot be directly used as an electrode. In recent years, to improve the electrochemical properties of BP, carbon materials have usually been used as the second component of composites with BP, but recently some researchers have developed several non-carbon materials, such as metals/metal compounds and conductive polymers. From the perspective of the number of published articles, the number for black phosphorus (including phosphorene) is less than that for RP, which is mainly limited by the difficulty in preparing bulk BP crystals and their sensitivity to air.
5.3 Section summary
In this section, the application of phosphorus in the field of energy storage (LIBs and SIBs) in recent years was introduced. Carbon materials with different morphologies were introduced into phosphorus by different strategies to overcome the problems of poor intrinsic conductivity and volume expansion of phosphorus. However, there has been some progress in that the structure of P should continue to be optimized to facilitate the application of high-performance LIBs and SIBs. In addition, new characterization methods and chemical kinetic simulation methods should be developed to promote the understanding of the mechanism of lithium and sodium, and the correlation between structure and properties, to further promote elemental P as an anode for LIBs and SIBs. P/C composites with good interfaces and fine-tuneable nanostructures have also been developed in battery materials research, and these composites generally have good electrochemical properties. Therefore, on the basis of these studies, it is possible to obtain elemental P matrix composites with good performance in the fields of photocatalysis by appropriately adjusting the content and structure of carbon.
6. Conclusion, challenges and outlook
As a newly emerging family, the elemental phosphorus materials (especially crystalline red P and black P) have shown great potential in typical sustainable processes, e.g. photocatalysis and secondary batteries. Therefore, their preparation methods and working mechanisms have been widely studied. After a careful survey of the recent progress in this review, several issues might be important for future development are thus summarized and highlighted here:
(1) Currently, the reported preparation strategies for crystalline phosphorus (both for red and black P) are mainly based on the programmed heating induced “evaporation–condensation–crystallization” process, which originated several decades ago and has now become mature. However, it always relied on vacuum, sealed tube systems and an energy consuming heating process, which are somewhat complex and restrict large-scale production. Moreover, during the transformation of P allotropes, the toxic and explosive by-products (white P or PH3) are easily produced. On the basis of this method, future improvements may include the rational design of a large-scale vacuum-based device, economic reforming of the heating system and careful control of the heating parameters to avoid the by-products. Notably, further understanding the mutual transformation process and mechanism between the P allotropes is crucial to achieving an improved successful example. Another trial beyond the “evaporation–condensation–crystallization” is also encouraged; this includes but is not limited to solvothermal, ultrasonic or ball milling treatment of the P precursors.
(2) The recent development of crystalline phosphorus as the photocatalyst or anode material has confirmed that they are excellent candidates for typical sustainable processes. Meanwhile, some shortcomings that hinder their applications were also found and deserve further study. For photocatalysis, it is impressive that the crystalline red and black P exhibited a wide light-responsive range; the solar energy in the long wavelength region (>700 nm) can also be used, which is an intriguing step as compared with traditional photocatalysts. Although much better than their amorphous counterparts, large quantities of photoexcited charges are still lost during their transportation due to the interior molecular structure and the surface defects (e.g. surface oxidation). The construction of a heterojunction is a good way to improve this problem, e.g. combining with other photocatalysts can form the band matching structure. However, further chances for enhancement may lie in the precise control of interfacial contact at the molecular level. For secondary batteries, the low cost and large theoretical capacity of elemental P have gained great attention for their application as the next generation of anode materials. However, the structural decay during the electrochemical process should be further improved. Moreover, one important issue that should be of concern for both photocatalysis and secondary batteries is the internal properties of crystalline P as a molecular crystal. Further correlation of the behaviours of P atomic clusters (e.g. breaking, assembly or transformation) with their working performance may become the research target in the future.
(3) The final issue of concern is the stability of crystalline elemental P materials. In solvents or electrochemical environments, it is easy for swelling and breaking to occur. The van der Waals forces between P atomic chains and molecular layers tend to be broken when external mechanical forces or other influences exist.78 However, there are hardly any strategies that can solve this problem. The first important step may be to study the structural evolution under the real working conditions used in advanced in situ methods, e.g., Fenton-second technology combined with spectroscopic analysis.
