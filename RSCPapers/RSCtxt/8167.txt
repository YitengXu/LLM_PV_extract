    , Accepted 11th July 2022First published on 12th July 2022AbstractSpiro-type molecules remain benchmark hole transporting materials (HTMs) for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Terminal unit engineering of spiro-type HTMs has drawn much attention to efficient and stable PSCs. In this work, we introduce dibenzofuran or dibenzothiophene as the terminal group into the spiro-type HTMs, named spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT, respectively, due to their superior carrier transport properties. The structure–property relationship introduced by varied terminal groups is studied in detail. It is noted that the molecule (spiro-DBF) with dibenzofuran edge groups exhibits higher hole mobility, better morphology on the perovskite layer and stronger hole extraction ability than spiro-OMeTAD. When used in PSCs, spiro-DBF exhibits a PCE of 21.43%, which is even higher than that of conventional spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the device with spiro-DBF also exhibits superior long-term stability. Thus, the results deliver some new insights for developing perfect HTMs and spiro-DBF could also be a potential HTM candidate for high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their rapidly rising power conversion efficiency (PCE) and easy preparation process.1–5 To date, the PCE of PSCs has reached a certified 25.7%.6 In normal PSCs, a perovskite layer is sandwiched by hole transporting materials (HTMs) and electron transporting materials.7 HTMs play crucial roles in facilitating hole extraction and migration, minimizing charge recombination and protecting the perovskite layer.8,9 Recently, lots of various types of HTMs have been designed and applied in PSCs.10–15 Among them, spiro-type molecules are widely used in high-performance PSCs.16 The spiro structures, such as common spirofluorene, possess a unique orthogonal molecular conformation due to the two molecular π-systems connected by the sp3-hybridized central carbon atom, which provide many advantages, including (1) rigidity due to the preferably acquired vertical arrangement and a highly sterically demanding structure, leading to high glass transition temperature (Tg); (2) a stable amorphous state below Tg, leading to anisotropic charge transport properties; and (3) high solubility due to the extremely weak intermolecular π–π interaction.17–20
To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been the mostly used spiro-type HTM for efficient PSCs. Recently, the replacement of partial anisole on spiro-OMeTAD by other functional groups has been proved as an efficient way to improve the photoelectric performance of PSCs, such as para- and meta-anisole,21 fluorene,22N-ethylcarbazole,23,24 trifluoroethoxyl functionalized anisole,25 thioanisole,26 methoxynaphthalene,27 fluorine functionalized anisole,28etc. Though the above reported new HTMs exhibit a higher PCE than spiro-OMeTAD in their work, it is noteworthy that spiro-OMeTAD still retains the highest reported PCE (25.8%) in PSCs.29 Therefore, it is necessary and promising to design and develop novel efficient spiro-type HTMs.
In this work, in the light of the superior carrier transport properties of dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene, we introduce these two moieties as the edge units into spiro-type molecules. The chemical structures of the developed molecules and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 1. Their detailed synthesis process is presented in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The molecule with dibenzofuran as a partial edge moiety (spiro-DBF) exhibits higher conductivity, better film-forming ability and hole extraction ability compared with spiro-DBT and spiro-OMeTAD. The champion PSC with spiro-DBF exhibits a PCE of 21.43%, which is obviously higher than that with spiro-OMeTAD under the same conditions.

Results and discussion

Fig. 2a exhibits the ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis) and emission spectra in dichloromethane solution. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT exhibit substantially identical absorption and emission spectra. The developed materials together with spiro-OMeTAD displayed two distinct optical absorption bands ranging from 290 nm to 450 nm. spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT exhibit the maximum absorption peaks at 396 and 397 nm, respectively, which slightly shift to a longer wavelength compared to spiro-OMeTAD (386 nm), illustrating the π–π* transition. The red-shifted absorption response may have resulted from the extended π-conjugation through the dibenzo heterocyclic unit compared with the anisole of spiro-OMeTAD. Moreover, the DFT-calculated absorption spectra exhibit similar trends with experimental results (Fig. S1, ESI†). Similar to the absorption results, the emission of spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT also exhibited a slight bathochromic-shift compared to spiro-OMeTAD. The new molecules display a relatively smaller Stokes shift compared to spiro-OMeTAD. As illustrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†), all the molecules show a slightly bathochromic-shift as the solution transitions to the solid state, which has been commonly found in several conjugation materials.28 The optical bandgaps (Eg) of the molecules are calculated from the absorption onset of the materials in the film state (Fig. S2, ESI†),28 which is 2.95, 2.88 and 2.88 eV for spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) chemical analyses were performed to investigate the substitution effect of partial anisole by dibenzofuran or dibenzothiophene on the electronic properties. As shown in Fig. 2b, the variation of the peripheral unit of the molecules from anisole to the dibenzo heterocyclic unit caused slightly increased oxidation potential. The calculated HOMO levels of spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT are −5.10, −5.22 and −5.22 eV, respectively. The lower HOMO levels of spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT, which are also confirmed by DPV curves (Fig. S3, ESI†), resulted from the less electron donor strength of the dibenzo heterocyclic unit. The higher HOMO levels of the molecules than the valence band of the used (CsPbI3)0.05(FAPbI3)0.95 perovskite (−5.64 eV)30 indicate that these materials are energy feasible for hole extraction. The LUMO levels of the molecules were also calculated by combining the Eg and the HOMO level. Accordingly, the LUMO levels for spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT corresponded to −2.15, −2.34 and −2.34 eV, respectively. The LUMO levels of all the materials were higher than those of the used perovskite (−4.11 eV), guaranteeing efficient electron-blocking and restraining the radiative recombination. The energy level alignments of the PSCs including the investigated HTMs are depicted in Fig. 3a. As illustrated in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†), the molecular simulation exhibited a homologous HOMO/LUMO trend with the above experimental results. Similar TDDFT-calculated structural conformations and clear differences between developed molecules with spiro-OMeTAD can be noted. The electron distributions of the HOMO of the new molecules were localized in the terminal dibenzo heterocycle with some extending to the spiro core. As displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†), all the molecules have a perpendicular structure unique to spiro compounds, and the electrostatic potential surface indicates the polarized structure of the compounds.31 Generally, the introduction of oxygen and sulfur into HTMs can reduce the HOMO level, such as methoxy (–OCH3) and methylthio (–SCH3).26,32 However, the oxygen and sulfur in the dibenzo heterocyclic unit exhibit negligible impact on their electrochemical properties, which can be attributed to a similar less electron donor strength of dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene. The thermal properties of the molecules were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. As illustrated in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the glass transition temperature (Tg) of spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT is 155 and 178 °C, respectively, which is obviously higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (122 °C). Therefore, the replacement of anisole on spiro-OMeTAD by a dibenzo heterocyclic unit is an efficient way to enhance the Tg.

Many studies have shown that spiro-type HTMs always display preferable performance in n–i–p PSCs, therefore, we assembled the classical n–i–p device with a structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/(CsPbI3)0.05(FAPbI3)0.95/HTM/Au referring to our previous studies. The architecture of the devices is displayed in Fig. 3b and the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy image of the whole device is exhibited in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Many studies including ours also proved that the HTM's deposition amount and dopant have significant effects on the device performance,23,33–35 therefore, we also applied these molecules in PSCs with different concentrations and w/o additives. The detailed device fabrication procedure is illustrated in the ESI.† The photovoltaic characteristics of the devices with different HTMs were collected under standard AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
As illustrated in Fig. S9 and Table S1 (ESI†), the devices based on the developed HTMs without any additives exhibit extremely low PCE (the concentration of HTMs is 50 mg mL−1). The inferior device performance of doping-free spiro-type HTMs is widely observed in the reports, which resulted from the low carrier mobility caused by low intermolecular π–π stacking of spiro-type molecules.22 We further introduce commonly used dopants (Li–TFSI, TBP and FK-209) into these HTMs, and the detailed doping ratio is also illustrated in the device fabrication process. It can be noted that the concentration of HTMs exhibits a visible effect on PSC performance (Fig. S10, ESI†), which has also been found in many reports.23,33,34 The detailed average photovoltaic data of the device employing the HTMs with different varied concentrations, such as short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE of the device with varied concentration of HTMs with standard deviation (STDEV) are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Moreover, Table S3 (ESI†) illustrates the device parameters of the device with optimized concentration of spiro-DBF, which exhibit a similar trend to Table S2 and Fig. S10 (ESI†), illustrating the superior repeatability. The poor performance of the device with high concentration may have resulted from the increase of system impedance caused by the excessive thickness of the hole transporting layer. However, the devices present obvious deteriorated PCE when the concentration of HTMs is low, which can be caused by the bad coverage of HTMs on perovskite so that the roughness of the perovskite layer increases.

Fig. 3c presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices employing different HTMs (50 mg mL−1), and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. As a reference, the device with spiro-OMeTAD achieved a desirable PCE of 20.56% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 24.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.77. The result is equivalent to the commonly reported PCE acquired in recent state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD PSCs.23,24 Interestingly, the spiro-DBF-based PSC delivered a better PCE of 21.43%, with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 24.21 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.79. The spiro-DBT-based device exhibited a lower PCE of 20.37% with a Voc of 1.12 V, a Jsc of 23.88 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.76. The developed HTMs display similar Voc, which resulted from their equal HOMO level. The PSCs with spiro-DBF or spiro-DBT deliver relatively higher Voc than that of spiro-OMeTAD, which resulted from the obvious lower levels of spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT than spiro-OMeTAD. The above similar results have been observed in many reports.22,23,25 It can also be believed that the devices with higher Voc may be obtained after carefully optimizing the amount of additives.22,23 And it is worth noting that the performance of the developed HTMs with or without additives is opposite. One of the possible reasons can be the different tolerance for dopants.23,26 In addition, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were characterized to evaluate the photo responsibility of devices. As displayed in Fig. 3d, the device employing spiro-DBF exhibits similar IPCE response to that employing spiro-OMeTAD, which is consistent with Jsc values obtained from J–V curves. As illustrated in Fig. S11 and Table S4 (ESI†), the device with spiro-DBF also exhibits a similar hysteresis behavior to that with spiro-OMeTAD, which is also found in many mesoporous device.22,27,28 The spiro-DBF-based device exhibits relatively higher PCE than spiro-OMeTAD in the forward scan direction.

To study the effect of the molecular structures of HTMs on PSCs’ performance, we further carried out the film morphology, photoluminescence (PL), hole mobility tests, etc. As doped HTMs were applied in the full PSC fabrication, we represent a comparative investigation of the doped HTM films in the following tests. The surface coverage and the quality of the HTM film on perovskite are vital for ideal interfacial carrier transfer dynamics, which have great effects on the device performance.36 Therefore, the surface morphology of the perovskite film or coated with different HTMs (50 mg mL−1) were evaluated by atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements, as displayed in Fig. 4. The perovskite film exhibits a rough surface morphology with a root mean square (RMS) of around 50 nm, which is larger than our previous results due to the different components of perovskite materials in this work.37 RMS values decrease obviously after the perovskite was deposited with different HTMs, and are 20, 14 and 20 nm for spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT, respectively. The relatively bad surface morphology of spiro-DBT could have resulted from bad tolerance for dopants,23,26 while spiro-DBF forms a better coverage on the perovskite layer, which could form a selective contact between Au and perovskite effectively and would be beneficial for reducing the charge recombination and enhancing charge transfer at the interface.38 Water contact angle measurements were performed to evaluate the hydrophobicity of these investigated HTMs, as also illustrated in Fig. 4. All the films coated with different HTMs exhibit a contact angle below 75°, which can be attributed to the existence of hydrophilic dopants. Nevertheless, the molecules with dibenzo heterocyclic units as edge groups exhibit better hydrophobicity.

The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were recorded to clarify the dynamics of charge transfer occurring at the interface between perovskite and HTMs. Fig. 5a exhibits the steady-state PL figure of pristine perovskite and that coated with different HTMs. The pristine perovskite film exhibits a strong emission signal, which shows a significant decrease when covered with HTMs, illustrating the efficient hole extraction at the interface.39–41 The quenching efficacy followed spiro-DBF > spiro-OMeTAD > spiro-DBT, illustrating their hole extraction capacity from strong to weak. The TRPL decay data were fitted by a bi-exponential formula,42 and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5b and Table S5 (ESI†). The perovskite film coated with different HTMs exhibits similar t1, which is similar to the previous report.41 The t2 of the perovskite films with spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT is around 14, 11 and 18 ns, respectively, verifying more efficient charge extraction and migration occurring at the perovskite/spiro-DBF interface. The fast decay (t1) can be assigned to the presence of surface defects in the neat perovskite film, which is almost not affected by the existence of HTMs.43 To further clear the reason for spiro-DBF to have better hole extraction ability, the hole mobility (doped same with the device fabrication process) is measured by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 5c), and the calculated hole mobility is around 2.87 × 10−3, 6.31 × 10−3 and 1.25 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD, spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT, respectively. In addition, though the above results, the inferior device efficiency based on doped spiro-DBT resulted from the inferior surface morphology, lower hole mobility and weaker hole extraction ability than those of spiro-OMeTAD and spiro-DBF. The long-term stability of the PSCs with various HTMs is shown in Fig. 5d. The PSCs without encapsulation are stored at a relative humidity of approximately 10% and a temperature of around 30 °C. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the device with developed HTMs also exhibit better stability than spiro-OMeTAD at high humidity (around 60% relative humidity). The better device stability of the device based on spiro-DBF and spiro-DBT resulted from the better hydrophobicity and higher Tg of these two materials. It can be noted that the PSCs with developed HTMs exhibit obviously better stability than spiro-OMeTAD, illustrating their superior application potential.

Conclusions
In summary, two new spiro-type HTMs with dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene as partial terminal units are designed and developed. Among them, the molecule with dibenzofuran groups (spiro-DBF) even delivered enhanced properties than spiro-OMeTAD. The lower HOMO level, higher conductivity and better film-forming ability ensure the hole extraction ability of spiro-DBF than spiro-OMeTAD. As a result, the spiro-DBF-based PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 21.43%, which outperformed those of the devices based on spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 20.56%). Moreover, the PSCs with developed HTMs also exhibited better long-term stability than that of spiro-OMeTAD. Overall, these results illustrate the potential of dibenzo heterocyclic units as terminal substituents in designing ideal HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs.
