    , Accepted 31st July 2019First published on 31st July 2019AbstractPolymer dielectrics with high energy density (Ue) and low energy loss (Ul) under elevated electric fields and temperatures are in urgent demand for next-generation energy storage devices, e.g., high-pulse film capacitors. To overcome their long-standing tradeoff between high Ue and low Ul, a series of flexible glassy poly(styrene-methyl methacrylate-methallyl alcohol) (P(St-MMA-MAA)) terpolymers with promising dielectric and physical properties, including improved tunable permittivity (3–6 range), thermal stability, and processability, are investigated and compared to the commercially available state-of-the-art polymer dielectric, i.e., biaxially oriented polypropylene. The benzyl groups of the low-polarity polystyrene matrix suppressed the aggregation of polar units under high energy fields, i.e., diminishing the aggregation caused energy loss in the capacitive terpolymers. The hydroxyl groups on MAA units are designed to establish H-bonds between hydroxyl and ester groups, which favor the enhancement of glass transition temperature, dielectric constant, Young's modulus, and breakdown strength of polymers. As a result, a discharge energy density of 14.5 J cm−3 with a high efficiency of 93% at 700 MV m−1 is achieved. This work demonstrates that dispersing isolated dipoles into a low-polarity polymer matrix with high glass transition temperature is an effective strategy for suppressing the energy loss induced by the orientation of aggregated dipoles and creates a new avenue for high-energy and low-loss flexible capacitors.
Introduction
As electrical energy storage devices, metalized film capacitors have been in significant demand in the emerging advanced electronic and electrical-power applications, such as electric vehicles, solar photovoltaic generation plants, filters, microwaves, electromagnetic launching, and switched-mode power supplies.1–6 This demand is driven by the outstanding characteristics of capacitors, such as extremely high power densities, fast charge and discharge rates, and large output voltages.7–9 Serving as insulating layers to separate the positive and negative charges in capacitors, dielectric polymer films with high energy density (Ue), high-temperature stability, and low energy loss (Ul) are crucial to the maximization of the overall Ue within the limited volume and minimization of the capacitor size/cost. As indicated by the equation Ue = 0.5ε0εrEb2, where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and εr and Eb are the relative permittivity and breakdown strength of the dielectric materials, Ue of dielectric materials could be improved by increasing either εr or Eb.10 Furthermore, a high band gap is also considered as a key factor controlling the breakdown strength.11,12 Meanwhile, working under either high alternating current or direct current electric fields, the Ul of capacitors has to be strictly maintained at low levels since most of it would be converted into heat, which would lead to increased temperatures and accelerated degradation of the capacitors.
Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films, representing the state of the art of metalized polymer dielectrics, possess the significant advantages of low dielectric loss (tanδ < ca. 0.0003 at 1 kHz) and high breakdown strength (ca. 730 MV cm−1), but a low εr of ∼2.2 and a displacement (D) of < 1.2 μC cm−2, which limits the Ue to 2–4 J cm−3 at 600 MV m−1.13–16 The highest Ue of 7.42 J cm−3 at 600 MV m−1 was achieved by incorporation of –OH and –NH2 polar groups into polypropylene; however tanδ and Ul were significantly increased due to the polymers' distorted isotacticity and crystallinity.14 In addition, the maximum temperature that BOPP can withstand is only 85 °C, which is significantly lower than the ambient operating temperature of advanced power electronics.17 Therefore its low temperature performance limits the lifetime and discharge efficiency of devices. Another high-energy-density class of dielectric polymers is poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based high-k ferroelectric polymers. Despite their high Ue (∼30 J cm−3), their large Ul (>20%) and even lower operating temperature grade prevent their application in high-pulse capacitors.18–26
To achieve high Ue and low Ul at elevated temperatures, dipolar glassy polymers, e.g., polythioureas, with average εr of 4.2–5.6, Ue of 13–20 J cm−3, and rather high Tg (ca. 240 °C) have been widely investigated.27–34 The most recent example of dipolar glassy polymers includes poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)s (SO2–PPOs) with an expanded εr range (6.2–8.6), Ue of ∼24 J cm−3, η of 72% and high Tg (∼220 °C).15 However, under high electric fields, aggregation of polar sulfonyl groups caused inevitably reduced Ue and η (ca. 2.4 J cm−3 and 88% at 300 MV m−1 and 120 °C) even at temperatures far below Tg. Furthermore, due to their high Tg, these polymers had limited processability and a brittle nature. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to achieve both high energy density and low loss in polymeric dielectrics with good processability and mechanical properties.
Cao et al. have introduced flexible segments into the backbones of rigid polar aromatic polymers to increase the flexibility of dipoles and the dipolar polarization at the molecular level. As a result, all designed polymers have high energy densities above 11 J cm−3 with efficiency over 90%.12 In this work, we present a new strategy to achieve both high Ue and η by manipulating H-bond interactions in a family of glassy polystyrene-based copolymers referred to as poly(styrene-methyl methacrylate-methallyl alcohol)s (P(St-MMA-MAA)s). As high-pulse capacitors, high discharge efficiency and speed are as important as large Ue, especially for high-temperature and high-electric-field applications. Unfortunately, as noted in Table S1 in the ESI,† under these conditions the desirable high Ue and η could not yet be realized simultaneously. Besides O–O interaction between MMA units, H-bond interactions between hydroxyl and ester groups are constructed. The increased mobility of –OH groups and the improved Young's modulus (due to H-bonding) account for the increased εr and Eb, thus leading to a high Ue of 14.5 J cm−3 at 700 MV m−1, which is triple that of commercial polymer dielectric BOPP measured at 650 MV m−1 (ca. 4.4 J cm−3).30 Most strikingly, a high discharge efficiency of η > 93% at 700 MV m−1 is achieved, which is better than that of most of the reported polymer dielectrics.
Results and discussion
To synthesize these terpolymers, MMA groups in pristine P(St-MMA) were reduced via a reduction process using LiAlH4 as a reducing agent as shown in Scheme 1. The typical procedure for solution-casting is illustrated in Scheme 1 as well. The chemical composition of the resulting systems is presented in Table S2.† The successful reduction of MMA units is confirmed by 1H NMR, FTIR and GPC. A molar ratio of St/MMA = 65/35 in the parent P(St-MMA) is determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1a), specifically by integrating signals at 3.6 ppm (I2, MMA units) and 6.5–7.5 ppm (I1, St units) and using eqn (1), (1)where m1 and m2 are the mole fractions of St and MMA in the copolymers, respectively. By varying the dosage of the reducing agent (LiAlH4), P(St-MMA-MAA) terpolymers with different compositions are produced. In the terpolymers, the remaining molar content of MMA can be calculated using the molar ratio of St/MMA = 65/35 obtained from eqn (1). Therefore, the molar ratio of MAA (m3) could be obtained by subtracting the MMA molar content (m2) in the terpolymers from the pristine 35 mol% as indicated in eqn (2), (2)where I1 and I3 refer to the integrals of the signals at 6.5–7.5 ppm of St units and 3.6 ppm of MMA units, respectively. Herein, varied MAA contents ranging from 4 mol% to 15 mol% are successfully synthesized as listed in Table S2† named as P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/31/4), (65/25/10) and (65/20/15), respectively.

The successful reduction of MMA units is confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1b, where the reduction process is characterized by the rising intensity of the bands corresponding to –OH groups (3400–3500 cm−1) and the decreased absorption at 1730 cm−1 ascribed to –CO on MMA groups. To further prove the H-bond established in P(St-MMA-MAA), the in situ FTIR of P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) film at elevated temperature is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The absorption of –OH shows a slight blue shift from 3564 cm−1 at 25 °C to 3590 cm−1 at 200 °C, which indicates that the H-bond formed in the sample starts to disassemble at high temperature. The GPC results show that the molecular weight of the terpolymers is slightly lower than that of the pristine P(St-MMA) (Fig. 1c), which agrees well with the reduction of ester groups to lower molecular weight hydroxyls. This result also confirms that there is neither polymer backbone degradation nor other undesirable side reactions in the process. These results strongly suggest that the chemical composition and structure of the P(St-MMA-MAA)s are as expected and in good agreement with the characterization data. The MAA content is well controlled within 15 mol% as listed in Table S2,† since its further increase would lead to reduced solubility (i.e., processability) and higher moisture absorption in the terpolymers, making them unfavorable for the large-scale processing of thin films for high-electric-field applications.
As shown in Fig. 2a and S2a,† at ambient temperature, P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) having the highest content of MAA units (15 mol%) possesses the highest Ue compared to other P(St-MMA-MAA)s, and the Ue value is better than most of the reported linear polymer dielectrics (Table S1†). The increase of the operating temperature up to 110 °C shows a negligible influence on Ue of P(St-MMA-MAA)s under the same E. The largest Ue of 7.6 J cm−3 is obtained in P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) at 525 MV m−1 and 110 °C, and is four times the Ue of BOPP measured at 400 MV m−1 and 70 °C (ca. 1.6 J cm−3).13 Interestingly, its η could be well maintained over 93% even at 700 MV m−1 (Fig. 2b). This result is relative to BOPP and aromatic polythiourea at comparable electric fields, where the latter has the highest reported η for polymer dielectrics, i.e., η = 94% at 700 MV m−1 (ArPTU in Table S1†). At the elevated temperature of 110 °C, η is slightly reduced to 86% at 525 MV m−1. In contrast, no reliable η of BOPP could be detected under E over 300 MV m−1 at 105 °C, while η of BOPP measured at 70 °C is only ca. 93% at 400 MV m−1.13 The discharge speed of the as-formed terpolymer and BOPP films is measured using a specially designed high-speed capacitor discharge circuit, in which the discharge energy density vs. discharge time is measured, and the result is shown in Fig. 2c and S3.† It takes only 1.3 μs for P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) to release the stored energy completely, which is only one-tenth that of BOPP measured under the same conditions. This high discharge efficiency leads to a power density of ca. 1.6 MW cm−3, which is twenty-five times larger than that of BOPP (ca. 0.06 MW cm−3). The elevated temperature shows a negligible influence on the performance. These results clearly indicate that P(St-MMA-MAA)s possess significant advantages over most of the known polymer dielectrics in terms of large Ue and high η performance. In particular, P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) exhibits the best performance among all the P(St-MMA-MAA) samples. The large Ue of P(St-MMA-MAA)s could be firstly ascribed to the elevated εr as shown in Fig. 3, S4 and S5,† which compare εr and tanδ of P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA)s at different temperatures and frequencies. As the testing frequency increases (Fig. 3a and S4†), εr decreases from 3.4 at 0.01 Hz to ca. 2.8 at 1 MHz at 20 °C. Meanwhile, with the rise of testing temperature, εr of P(St-MMA) increases slightly from 3.1 to 4.2 (100 °C) at 1 kHz. As shown in Fig. 3a and S4,†εr of the resultant terpolymers exhibits the same decreasing tendency as that of pristine P(St-MMA) with the increase of frequency. Intriguingly, at 1 kHz, εr of P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) is found to be 4.2 at 20 °C, which is 26% larger than the εr of pristine P(St-MMA) of 3.1. Increasing the MAA content of terpolymers leads to better dielectric performance (i.e., higher εr and Ue). This improvement is attributed to the increased distance of O–O pairs and the enhanced mobility of –OH groups on MAA (in contrast to ester groups on MMA). This finding could be further confirmed by the tanδ trends of P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA)s (Fig. S4†). The incremental increase of MAA content leads to not only increased εr but also lowered dielectric loss as shown in Fig. 3a and S4.† With the increase of MAA content, tanδ of P(St-MMA-MAA)s shows negligible dependency on the frequency at temperatures below 80 °C. This dielectric behavior is mainly due to the absence of the dipole-mobility-related phase transition in the range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz. When the temperature is raised to 100 °C, tanδ of P(St-MMA-MAA)s increases quickly but is still much lower than that of pristine P(St-MMA). The increase of tanδ at 0.01 to 103 Hz is ascribed to the β-transition of polar groups on MMA and MAA units. This β-transition related broad peak on the graph continuously shifts to higher frequency when the temperature is raised from 80 to 100 °C as shown in S4,† suggesting the improved mobility of polar groups and accelerated response to the altered electric field at elevated temperatures. Therefore, the introduction of hydroxyl groups is favorable for the improvement in temperature and frequency stability of the dielectric performance of P(St-MMA-MAA)s. The increased εr could further confirm this result. The dipole moment of –OH groups (about 1.68 D) is even slightly smaller than that of ester groups (1.75 D). Ideally, the substitution of MMA with MAA should lead to little dielectric change in the copolymers. However, at ambient temperature, the contribution of ester groups to εr is very limited since the polymer chains are frozen at temperatures below their Tg. The introduction of –CH2OH groups with smaller steric bulk but comparable dipole moment with –COOCH3 may contribute more to the overall εr for improved mobility of –CH2OH than –COOCH3 under an AC field.

(The discharge energy density and efficiency of P(St-MMA-MAA) is calculated from D–E loops at different electric fields ranging from 50 to 700 MV m−1 with a triangular waveform at a frequency of 10 Hz. The discharge energy density and efficiency of other reported linear dielectrics are cited from the literature.12,13,15,25–27,29,30 The density inset in (c) is calculated from the discharge curve with a discharge–charge instrument under 200 MV m−1, and the inner resistance (RL) is 100 kΩ. The discharge time in Fig. 2c is defined as the time when the discharge energy in the load reaches 90% of the maximum value from the discharge curve. The power density is calculated from the density obtained from the discharge curve and the calculation details are described in the ESI†).

Fig. 3b and S5† compare the εr and tanδ of P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA)s as a function of temperature, and the broad peak in εr at 20–90 °C should be ascribed to the β relaxation of polar MMA units, corresponding to the swing and flipping of ester groups along the external electric field. The substitution of MMA with MAA (Fig. S5c and e†) leads to a gradual increase in the peak height together with the baseline. At 100–120 °C, where all the frozen dipoles are released, the εr of P(St-MMA-MAA) also increases as MAA content increases. That could confirm the larger contribution of –CH2OH than the pristine ester group. Interestingly, the substitution of MMA with MAA leads to significantly depressed dielectric loss induced by both β and α relaxation as shown in Fig. 3b, and S5b, d and f.† The height of the broad peak at −20 to 80 °C corresponding to β relaxation reduces as MAA content increases. The sharp peak at 120 °C corresponding to α relaxation is dramatically depressed as well, especially in the P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15). Apparently, both the increased εr and the reduced loss could be ascribed to the addition of MAA and the possible established H-bonds, which may address the enhanced Ue and reduced Ul under high field as well.
Displacement–electric field (D–E) loops are usually employed to measure the dielectric performance and to calculate Ue and η under high electric fields. To assess the dielectric performance under high electric fields, the D–E loops are studied. D–E loops of P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) are compared with those of neat P(St-MMA) films at temperatures up to 130 °C (Fig. 4a and Fig. S6†). At ambient temperature, both charging and discharging cycles of all samples exhibit a slim linear dependence on the electric field. The conversion of MMA into MAA leads to a slightly improved slope of the D–E loops, which agrees well with the increased permittivity under a low electric field. Thanks to the high Eb of P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15), D–E loops could be detected up to 700 MV m−1. Most strikingly, the fairly good reversibility of the charging–discharging cycles strongly indicates that the introduction of MAA results in negligible dielectric loss if at all. That could be ascribed to the strong molecular force and H-bonds established among the high-polarity groups, which may greatly restrict their mobility along with the induced polarization relaxation. As shown in Fig. S6,† with the introduction of MAA content, the linear dielectric behaviour of P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) could be finely retained below 110 °C. The slim D–E profiles also confirm their excellent energy storage and discharge properties under high electric fields and elevated temperatures.

Besides elevated εr, the large Ue obtained in P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15) is also attributed to its high Eb, as shown in Fig. 4, and in Fig. S7,†Eb of P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA)s is shown at elevated temperature. Measurement for each sample is repeated more than 20 times and the results are analyzed with a two-parameter Weibull distribution as indicated in eqn (3), (3)where α is the scale parameter referring to the 63.2% probability of failure (for x = α, F(x) = 0.632) and β defines the shape parameter and describes the form of distribution. From the Weibull analysis, the α value of over 700 MV m−1 could be well maintained up to 70 °C in P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15). Fig. S7† suggests that the Eb is increased with the increase of MAA content in P(St-MMA-MAA)s. The elevated temperatures lead to reduced Eb, and consequently as shown in Fig. 4b and c, decreased values of Ue at Eb. The Eb is calculated using a modified form of the electromechanical model proposed by Stark and Garton, i.e., the equation Eb = 0.6(Y/ε0εr)0.5,35 where Y is the Young's modulus, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and εr is the relative dielectric constant of the materials. Therefore, either lowering εr or improving Y favors the enhancement of Eb. In particular, Y of the materials is crucial for high Eb because it overcomes the electromechanical failure caused by mutual Coulomb force from the opposite electrodes under high electric fields.36 Evidently, the higher the modulus is, the larger the Coulomb force the material can withstand. Thus, the excellent high-electric-field properties of P(St-MMA-MAA)s at elevated temperatures would be mostly attributed to the increased modulus mediated by Tg and H-bonds; these phenomena are explained in the subsequent sections.
Additionally, the band gaps of P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA) calculated from UV curves (Fig. S8†) are 4.52 eV and 4.50 eV, respectively. As suggested in the literature, a band gap larger than 4.0 eV is sufficiently high to achieve high Eb in dielectrics.12
According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, both P(St-MMA-MAA)s and pristine P(St-MMA) are amorphous and show Tg over 100 °C. As indicated in Fig. 5a, as MAA molar content increases, Tg gradually shifts from 106 °C in the parent P(St-MMA) to 121 °C in P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15). The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA, Fig. 5b) results show that Y is also enhanced respectively from 2.5 GPa to over 3.7 GPa, the latter being 5–10 times higher than that of BOPP. At 110 °C the quick drop of modulus induces a slight increase of εr and tanδ, and is ascribed to the reduced rigidity at the temperature close to Tg. The reduced modulus at elevated temperatures may account for the decreased Eb, Ue and η values.

To understand the positive effect of H-bonds and molecular structure on Y, the structural aspects of P(St-MMA-MAA)s are simulated using the radial distribution function (RDF), which has been proven to be powerful in illustrating the H-bond interactions in bulk models.37,38 Configuration snapshots of pristine P(St-MMA) and P(St-MMA-MAA) chains (with different MAA contents) are shown in Fig. S9.†Fig. 5c shows the O–O RDFs in the samples at 298 K, where the peaks in the range from 2.1 to 2.4 Å (i.e., a typical distance of O–O pairs in a carbonyl group) show a decrease in intensity with the increase of the MAA content (i.e., fewer ester and corresponding carbonyl groups). The typical distance of O–O pairs forming H-bonds in polymer chains ranges from 2.4 to 3.2 Å, while the H-bonds could also be constructed either between the ester and hydroxyl groups or among adjacent hydroxyl groups. Therefore, increasing the MAA (–OH groups) content results in the increase of peak intensity from 2.4 to 3.2 Å, due to the enhanced probability of H-bond formation. Moreover, when the MAA content is increased, an identical upward trend is noted for either the modulus of films or the concentration of H-bonds (inset of Fig. 5c), which demonstrates that the increased concentration of H-bonds is undoubtedly responsible for the improvement in the modulus of P(St-MMA-MAA) films. Generally regarded as evidence of amorphous polymer systems, the absence of sharp peaks at distances greater than 4 Å and the approach of the RDF function to 1 are observed, which is consistent with the obtained DSC results.
According to the molecular structure of P(St-MMA-MAA)s, the dispersion of polar hydroxyl and ester groups in P(St-MMA-MAA)s is illustrated in Fig. 6. Due to the low-polar nature of the PSt segment and its major content in the copolymers, the overall polymer could be regarded as a low-polarity matrix in a glassy state. Before the reduction, polar ester groups are isolated in the PSt matrix with a low concentration of clusters due to a rather small range of interaction distances of ester groups (2.1–2.4 Å). Therefore, the intermolecular force among ester groups is rather weak, which is confirmed by the low sensitivity of εr of pristine P(St-MMA) to either frequency or temperature. The substitution of MMA with MAA leads to a broader scope and range of the interaction distances, i.e., 2.4–3.2 Å, and thus increased intermolecular forces between hydroxyl and the adjacent ester groups, as well as the enhanced probability of forming H-bonds between hydroxyl groups as shown in Fig. 6. These phenomena might significantly magnify the cohesive energy density and Y in the resultant terpolymers, which should account for the well-maintained low dielectric loss and the increased η. Additionally, due to their smaller steric bulk, the mobility of isolated –OH groups is larger than that of ester groups; hence the εr of P(St-MMA-MAA)s improves with increasing MAA content.

Apart from the enhanced modulus and εr, a longer interaction distance between –OH groups and esters (compared to only ester groups) might construct more flexible crosslinking networks in P(St-MMA-MAA) films, which would allow P(St-MMA-MAA)s to be efficiently processed by solution casting into free-standing thin films. As illustrated in Fig. 7a, the as-cast P(St-MMA-MAA) films could be uniaxially stretched to several times their original length. Moreover, the films could be easily rolled and folded without breakage as shown in Fig. 7b–d and the video in ESI-2.† The excellent processability is extremely important for the large-scale production of high-quality films and the fabrication of metalized film capacitors.

Conclusions
In summary, this work presents a new strategy to solve the long-standing tradeoff between the high Ue and low Ul in polymer dielectrics, especially at high temperatures and electric fields. Hydroxyl groups are gradually introduced by controlled conversion of MMA into MAA groups, resulting in a family of glassy dipolar P(St-MMA-MAA) terpolymers. The improved mobility of hydroxyl groups leads to the enhanced εr of P(St-MMA-MAA)s. The flexible crosslinking networks established between hydroxyl and ester groups allow the resultant P(St-MMA-MAA)s to be easily stretched into high-quality thin films, rolled, and even folded without any breakage, i.e., facilitating potential large-scale fabrication of flexible electronics. As a result of the establishment of H-bonds, the significant improvement in Y is responsible for the dramatic increase of Eb, i.e., from 430 MV m−1 in pristine P(St-MMA) to 710 MV m−1 in P(St-MMA-MAA) (65/20/15). This leads to the high dielectric performance of the P(St-MMA-MAA) based capacitor at ambient temperature: Ue = 14.5 J cm−3, η = 93%, and high Eb of 710 MV m−1. Besides, the excellent performance of P(St-MMA-MAA) films is preserved at temperatures up to 110 °C. Hence, our strategy creates a new pathway to prepare glassy dielectric polymer films for application in flexible, efficient energy storage devices used in harsh environments such as high electric fields and elevated temperatures. Our team is in the process of extending this strategy to obtain high polymer dielectrics with operating temperatures over 150 °C.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(styrene-methyl methacrylate) P(St-MMA) (PM-600, 35 mol% of MMA units, Mn = 6.76 × 104 g mol−1) was purchased from Chi Mei Co., Ltd., and lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) was purchased from Alfa-Aesar. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, Tianjin Reagents Co., Ltd., AR grade) was dried and distilled from sodium and benzophenone. BOPP films were purchased from Quan Zhou Jia De Li Electronies Material Co., Ltd. The other chemicals were purchased from Tianjin Reagents Co., Ltd. and used as received.
Synthesis of P(St-MMA-MAA) and fabrication of films
2 g of P(St-MMA) was completely dissolved in 80 mL of anhydrous THF in a Schlenk flask in an inert atmosphere. The required amount of LiAlH4 was introduced into the solution, and the reduction reaction was carried out at room temperature (25 °C) for 24 h. Acetone was injected into the suspension to terminate the reaction before the mixture was precipitated in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (concentration of 5–10 vol%). Afterward, the precipitate was re-dissolved in acetone and precipitated in deionized water repeatedly three times to completely remove the catalyst residue, and the obtained terpolymers were dried under reduced pressure at 50 °C for three days. By varying the amount of LiAlH4 (Table S2†), P(St-MMA-MAA) terpolymers with different compositions were obtained.
The polymer films with a thickness of ∼11–15 μm were prepared by solution casting the terpolymers (ca. 3 wt% in DMF) onto glass plates. After the solvent was completely removed at 70 °C, the films together with the plates were kept at 150 °C for 4 h followed by being cooled down in an oven and peeled off for performance characterization. Gold electrodes (ca. 80 nm thick) were sputtered onto both surfaces of the films using a JEOL JFC-1600 auto fine coater (Japan) for electrical measurements as shown in Scheme 1.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer of 400 MHz (Bruker, Switzerland, CDCl3) with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the films were recorded on a Tensor 27 (Bruker, Germany) with a resolution of 1–0.4 cm−1 in transmission mode. FTIR spectra of films at elevated temperature were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Nicolet iS10 (ThermoFisher, America) from 25–200 °C. The UV absorption spectra of P(St-MMA-MAA) and P(St-MMA) solutions were measured with a LAMBDA 950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, America), the DMF was used as a blank sample. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was conducted on a Netzsch DSC 200 PC (Netzsch, Germany) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 after an initial cycle of quick heating (20 °C min−1) and cooling (20 °C min−1) to remove the thermal history. Molecular weights were determined using a Viscotek GPCmax Autosampler system, consisting of a pump, ViscoGEL GPC columns (G4000HHR), and a Waters 2414 differential refractive index (RI) detector with a THF flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 at 30 °C. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out on a TA DMA Q800 (TA, USA) performed in the tension mode using an oscillating force ramp. All samples with a size of 16 mm (L) × 0.014 mm (T) × 5 mm (W) were prepared by solution casting on Teflon plates. The initial force was 0.01 N at a frequency of 10 Hz and a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The tensile properties of the cast films were measured at ambient temperature using an electromechanical universal testing machine equipped with a 50 N load cell and a stretching rate of 0.1 mm min−1. All the specimens were cut into a dumbbell shape with dimensions of 12 mm (L) × 1.5 mm (W) with a thickness of ∼11–15 μm. Broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) was performed on a Novocontrol Concept 80 broadband dielectric spectrometer (Novocontrol Technologies, German) with temperature control. With the frequency changing from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz, the applied voltage was 1 V, and the temperature was increased from −60 °C to 120 °C at a rate of 4 °C min−1; the electrode diameter of the test sample is 1 cm. The electric D–E hysteresis loops at different temperatures were obtained on a Premiere II ferroelectric tester from Radiant Technologies, Inc., where DC electric fields ranging from 50 to 700 MV m−1 were applied across polymer films with a triangular waveform at a frequency of 10 Hz; the electrode diameter of the test sample is 0.3 cm. The breakdown electric field for all the films was determined using a breakdown voltage tester (Beijing Bei Guang Jing Yi Instrument Equipment Co., Ltd). The applied rate of the electric field was 0.1 kV min−1. The diameter of the cylindrical electrode was 10 mm; a leakage current of <10 mA was obtained until the film was electrically broken down. In the fast discharge experiments, films were charged to a given voltage using a high voltage MOSFET switch (610D-K-CE-IX); the inner resistance (RL) was 100 kΩ, and the discharge curve was measured under varied electric fields and elevated temperatures.
