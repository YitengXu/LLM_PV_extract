Their polarizabilities have been found to be efficient parameters for the design of nanostructures with desirable behavior. Unfortunately, the appropriate experimental data are scarce for most of the fullerene derivatives, due to their low availability or possible dissociation. At the same time, such information may be useful for C60-based nanotechnologies. We point our attention to the fullerene dimer and oligomers, which are novel and very promising compounds for nano-applications. We have performed the first density-functional theory study on the polarizability of fullerene derivatives (C60)n (n = 1–5) to elucidate how their structure affects the polarizability. In contrast to the concept of additivity, common in physical chemistry, the mean polarizability of (C60)n nonlinearly depends on the number of fullerene cores in their molecules, i.e. it violates the additivity. Similar to the other positive deviations from additive schemes, it has been called exaltation of polarizability. This effect is a result of the interaction of the π-electronic systems of fullerene cores in (C60)n and increases with their maximal remoteness. Experimental evidence of the exaltation is discussed. Thus, it agrees well with the enhancement of the polarizability of crystalline forms of C60 compared to molecular ones measured previously. Also, we have found a strong correlation between the calculated exaltations and the chemical properties of isomeric (C60)3, (C60)2 and its derivatives observed experimentally. The predicted enhancement has not been described previously and may be widespread among various nanostructures (for example, dimers of bowl-shaped hydrocarbons or other fullerenes). Insights into possible applications of the polarizability and its anisotropy to the molecular design and molecular machinery have been provided.1 IntroductionFullerene dimers and oligomers are an interesting class of fullerene derivatives, where the molecules contain several fullerene cores crosslinked by [2 + 2]-cycloaddition. Currently, the (C60)2 dimer, its exohedral and endohedral derivatives,1–5 trimers (C60)3,6 cross-dimer C60C70,3,7 and (C70)28 have been synthesized (Fig. 1). These are very specific chemicals, being both bulky molecules and small nano-objects due to their size. In addition, their molecules may be placed in between molecular (fullerenes) and crystalline (fullerites) forms of carbon based on their size. Though fullerene oligomers are still exotic compounds, interest in them has not waned. These compounds are prospective all-carbon building blocks for nanoarchitecture. That is why the synthetic routes to the (C60)2 dimer and its related structures are being actively developed.9 Fig. 1  Structures of the fullerene dimer and trimers identified experimentally. Fullerene-based multi-cage molecules have also become the subject of theoretical studies mainly on the structure and stability of (C60)2, (C60)2On, their anions, and isomeric trimers (C60)3.6,10–13 Quantum-chemical studies suggest the use of metal-doped (C60)2 molecules as spin cluster qubits,13 and the filling of the two fullerene cages of the fullerene dimer by different atoms (e.g., Na and F12) as a source of enhancement of nonlinear optical properties. Also, according to DFT calculations, the dimer is encapsulated more easily than the C60 molecule, so it opens new opportunities for the targeted synthesis of endohedrally functionalized nano-objects.11Being rigid nanoscale molecules, C60 oligomers have been used in nanotechnology and molecular machinery, e.g., in the design of fullerene-based nanocars, tests of their motion,14 and the observation of the single (C60)2, C60C70, and (C60)3 molecules by scanning tunneling microscopy.3,6 Physical and chemical properties of these compounds have been poorly studied, whereas this information is useful for the design of new materials and nanodevices. Polarizability (α) is one such property. It determines the induced dipole moment of a molecule under an external electric field. The list of physical and chemical processes defined by polarizability is long.15 Optical linear properties and intermolecular interactions are the most significant. This parameter is especially important for compounds that show promise for nanodevices,16 which are usually based on intermolecular interactions and operate mainly in external electric fields.Currently, dipole polarizability of fullerenes and their derivatives have been studied in experimental and theoretical works (e.g.ref. 17 and 18, and references therein). According to the measurements19,20 and quantum-chemical calculations,17,18 fullerenes have outstandingly high mean polarizabilities (∼80 and ∼105 Å3 for C60 and C70, respectively). High α values make some fullerene properties and processes in the fullerene-containing systems quite unusual. These are 1,3-dipolar addition reactions of fullerenes,21,22 a strong propensity for aggregation23 and formation of donor–acceptor complexes,24 the anomalously effective quenching of electronically excited states,25 sheltering the encapsulated molecules from electric fields,26–28etc. In addition, anisotropy of polarizability is one of the parameters for the rational screening of C60 derivatives for organic solar cells as efficient electron-acceptors.29Depression of polarizability is one the unprecedented properties of fullerene exohedral derivatives. It appears as a negative deviation of C60Xn mean polarizabilities from the additivity if n increases (generally, the dipole polarizability of the analogous systems increases linearly when the number of addends or substituents increases). This phenomenon has been discovered by Prof. Arndt's group30 and investigated independently in our works.31–33 We have shown that depression of the polarizability is inherent in various C6031–33 and C7034 polyadducts, regardless of the type of chemical derivatization.None of the experimental or theoretical works have addressed the polarizability of C60 dimers and oligomers. The appropriate experiments on these substances have been hampered so far due to their low availability and possible dissociation. Therefore, their polarizabilities, difficult to measure but computable, become the objective of this quantum chemical study.In the present study, non-additivity of the polarizability of fullerene derivatives (C60)n, with n up to 5, has been predicted. Molecular simulation by the modern DFT method with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional has shown that an unusual enhancement of the polarizability is typical for all of the studied multi-cage nanostructures. This effect can be controlled by changing the positional relationship of the individual fullerene cores in a molecule. For (C60)n with n = 2 and 3, the calculated polarizabilities and experimentally known physical and chemical properties are in good agreement.2 Computational detailsAll calculations were performed by the density functional theory method PBE/3ζ35,36 implemented in the Priroda program.37 The 3ζ basis set describes electronic configurations of molecular systems by the orbital basis sets of contracted Gaussian-type functions (5s,1p)/[3s,1p] for H and (11s,6p,2d)/[6s,3p,2d] for C, O and F, which are used in combination with the density-fitting basis sets of uncontracted Gaussian-type functions (5s,2p) for H and (10s,3p,3d,1f) for C, O and F atoms.Each stationary point, localized on the respective potential energy surface, is a minimum that was confirmed by the calculation of vibrational modes (all structures were characterized by the absence of negative eigenvalues in the diagonalized Hessians). The density functional theory method PBE/3ζ reproduces structures and physicochemical characteristics (polarizability, IR, NMR spectra etc.) of fullerenes and their derivatives with high accuracy.31,32,38–41 To demonstrate it, we have superposed the calculated and experimental geometries and IR spectra of C60, C70, and the (C60)2 dimer (see ESI†). For example, the PBE/3ζ-calculated IR spectrum of (C60)2 (1467, 1433, 1187, 802, 778, 716, 710, 609, 574, 564, 551, 544, 526, 476, 446, 440 cm−1) corresponds well to the measured one1 (1464, 1425, 1188, 770, 762, 746, 710, 612, 574, 560, 551, 548, 527, 480, 449, 419 cm−1).Components of polarizability tensors α were calculated in terms of the finite field approach as the second-order derivatives of the total energy E with respect to the homogeneous external electric field F: (1)The tensors were calculated in the arbitrary coordinate system and then diagonalized. Their eigenvalues αxx, αyy, and αzz were used for the calculation of mean polarizability: (2)and anisotropy: (3)The mean polarizabilities of C60 and C70 fullerenes calculated by the PBE/3ζ method (82.7 and 102.7 Å3, respectively) are in perfect agreement with the measured values, e.g., α(C60) = 76.5 ± 8.0, α(C70) = 101.9 ± 13.9 Å3, obtained by molecular beam deflection19. Moreover, in the case of C60, the PBE/3ζ-calculated value (82.70 Å3) is in extraordinary agreement with the semiempirical estimation42 of C60 polarizability using experimental photoabsorption cross-sections and the density-of-states technique (infinite wavelength or static electronic polarizability is 82.75 Å3).Also, the PBE/3ζ method correctly reproduces the measured mean polarizabilities of fullerene halogenides C60F36 and C60F4830 which are almost equal (according to our PBE/3ζ-calculations in the previous work,32 the mean polarizabilities of C60F36 and C60F48 lie in the intervals 88.8–89.0 and 90.4–90.5 Å3 for isomers with different structures).As is known,43 typical generalized gradient approximation functionals (including PBE) have a tendency to overemphasize charge delocalization that may influence the results of long-range polarization effects. In spite of this fact, the analogous functionals have been successfully applied to a calculation of (hyper)polarizabilities of bi-cage fullerene-based molecular systems.12 The best way to describe the polarizability of such large molecular systems includes the use of long-range corrected DFT methods (e.g., LRC-BOP).44 At the same time, information about the applications of the PBE functional to the polarizability of such bulky objects is absent.To demonstrate the suitability of the chosen PBE/3ζ method for this problem, we have compared PBE/3ζ calculations of C20 fullerene oligomers, a simpler case, with the data obtained by the more precise DFT method PBE0/Λ145,46 with resolution-identity technique. This comparison is justified because C20 and C60 fullerenes are both conjugated polyhedral molecules. Note, its application even to (C20)2 requires high computational and time expense. Calculated by PBE/3ζ, the exaltations of polarizability for (C20)2, linear (C20)3 and (C20)4 equal 3.03, 9.54 and 18.01 Å3. These perfectly correspond to the more precise ΔαRI-PBE0/Λ1 values (3.00, 10.90 and 15.97 Å3, respectively) (see ESI†). Thus, the PBE/3ζ method is able to provide reliable estimates of polarizability and its exaltation for bulky molecules. It is not optimal but acceptable given the size of the systems considered.In addition, the exaltation of polarizability is also typical for C20 oligomers (and possibly to similar derivatives of the other fullerenes).3 Results and discussion3.1 Mean polarizability of (C60)n and additive schemes for its understandingWe have studied the fullerene dimer (C60)2 and the following trimers: e-, trans-2-, trans-3-, trans-4-(C60)3 and cyclic (C60)3 (Fig. 1). These substances have been synthesized and identified, so their structures are definitely known.1,6,9Oligomers (C60)n with more than three C60 units per molecule are currently unknown but there are both experimental and theoretical evidences of their existence (see ref. 47 and references therein). Therefore, we have included several hypothetical structures in the list of nano-objects under study. These are three tetramers and two pentamers which have different positional relationships of their fullerene cores. Constructing them, we took into account that the equatorial linkage of C60 units is the most energetically favorable in trimers.6,48 It is embodied in the cyclic, T-shaped and “+”-shaped isomers of (C60)4 and (C60)5. Additionally, linear (C60)4 and (C60)5 have been studied because they may occur during the chemical transformations of carbon peapods where C60 molecules line up inside a carbon nanotube of the appropriate diameter.47 All the mentioned structures differ in the maximal distance between the centers of the fullerene cores (Fig. 2). Fig. 2  Structures of the hypothetical fullerene oligomers under study. The calculated mean polarizabilities of (C60)n are presented in Table 1. As expected, these values for most of the structures are approximately n-fold higher than the polarizability of the fullerene (according to PBE/3ζ calculations, αC60 = 82.7 Å3). Then, we have analyzed the obtained values in terms of two additive schemes. Both of them deduce mean polarizabilities of the oligomers from the polarizability of the isolated C60. According to the first additive scheme, mean polarizability of (C60)n equals to n-fold C60 polarizability: α(I)add((C60)n) = nαC60(4)

The second scheme takes it into account. Accordingly, each of the (C60)n molecules is divided into n subunits of two types: one central fullerene core to which the other (n−1) C60 fragments are attached. In this case, the additive polarizability is equal to α(II)add((C60)n) = αC60 + (n−1)α[C60](5)where α[C60] = α((C60)2) − αC60 = 97.3 Å3 is the increment. It describes the change of polarizability with the addition of one fullerene subunit to the central C60 core and the disappearance of the π-components of [6,6] bonds in both fullerene cores. Additive scheme II is strictly applicable to oligomers which have a central fullerene cage: these are (C60)2, all (C60)3 molecules, T-shaped (C60)4, and “+”-shaped (C60)5. However, as shown below, it can be applied to all the (C60)n molecules. Deviations from the schemes have been also calculated (Table 1): Δα(I) = αDFT − α(I)add(6) Δα(II) = αDFT − α(II)add(7)The most unexpected result in the calculated Δα values is that they are positive. Generally, double bonds in a molecule enhance its mean polarizability. Conversely, polarizability diminishes if π-bonds disappear following chemical transformation without the addition of electron-rich chemical groups.15 For example, when two C60 molecules are linked resulting in [2 + 2]-(C60)2, two π-bonds cease to exist and, according to the conventional notion,15 the final polarizability should be lower than the twofold mean polarizability of C60, that is, the deviation from the additive scheme should be negative. However, as follows from the calculated data, Δα(I) > 0. Thus, an enhancement of polarizability occurs. The similar enhancement for hydrocarbons49 and endofullerenes27 is usually called exaltation of polarizability.The magnitude of the exaltation is enlarged if the number of C60 units increases in (C60)n (Fig. 3). The additive scheme II describes αDFT values with higher accuracy. Even in this case, the deviations Δα(II) for some isomers exceed 20 Å3. That is enough to be detected by the modern experimental techniques (e.g., by Kapitza-Dirac-Talbot-Lau interferometry applied to fullerene halogenides previously30). Fig. 3  Dependence of mean polarizability on the number of fullerene cores in (C60)n molecules. Circles correspond to αDFT values; lines represent the mean polarizabilities according to the additive schemes. What reasons underlie the exaltation of polarizability of fullerene oligomers? For unsaturated hydrocarbons, the analogous exaltation is observed when π-conjugation arises in a molecular system.15,49 Formation of oligomers results in the increase of the total number of double bonds in a molecule. However, π-electrons do not form an overall system since the subsystems of the conjugated CC bonds of fullerene units remain isolated at least by three C–C single bonds (two [5,6] bonds of fullerene moiety and one of the cyclobutane fragment). Nevertheless, the subsystems of π-electrons can communicate through space or through σ-bonds, according to the concept of orbital interaction through space.50,51 The mentioned interaction can influence both chemical and physical properties.52 A detailed investigation of the molecular orbitals of C60 oligomers should be addressed in a particular theoretical study. Here, the exaltation is interpreted as an interaction of π-systems in another way.3.2 The origin of polarizability enhancement for the (C60)2 dimerTo prove that the π-electronic system makes a crucial contribution to the exaltation of polarizability of fullerene oligomers, we have analyzed analogous deviations from the additive scheme I for the dimers of nonplanar π-conjugated hydrocarbons. Chosen for this purpose, sumanene C21H12,53 hemifullerene C30H12,54 circumtrindene C36H12,55 trinaphthosumanene C42H18,56 and (5,5) carbon nanotube cap C50H1057 make up the remarkable achievement of modern synthetic strategies. The listed bowl-shaped hydrocarbons can be considered as fullerene precursors with different degrees of closeness to C60. This is reflected also in the different number of double bonds in the molecules (NCC): it varies from 9 for sumanene, to 25 and 30 for C50H10 and C60, respectively. The structures of hydrocarbon dimers are obtained by their [2 + 2]-coupling at the bonds, maximally remote from the edges of the bowls, that is, located in the curved regions of the carbon surface, similar to C60 (these bonds are marked in red in the structural formulae) (Fig. 4). Fig. 4  Structures (side view) and chemical formulae of the bowl-shaped hydrocarbons known as C60 fullerene precursors. The bonds that take part in the dimers’ formation are shown in red. The mean polarizabilities of the hydrocarbons and their [2 + 2]-dimers increase with the molecular size (Table 2). Their mean polarizabilities and the respective deviations have been estimated in terms of additive scheme I, similar to eqn (4) and (6). According to the calculations, the deviation is higher with a larger number of double bonds in the parent hydrocarbon molecule. Moreover, this deviation is negative for sumanene, the smallest compound of the set. It means that its π-electronic system does not cover the loss of polarizability caused by the disappearance of two π-bonds.

To demonstrate it, we have replaced one of the hydrocarbon moieties in (CxHy)2 by a C60 core, which results in [2 + 2]-adducts C60CxHy. In all cases, the exaltation becomes higher after the replacement (Table 2). Δα(I) values increase with the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon part and approach the Δα(I)((C60)2) value. Thus, the size of the π-electronic system determines the magnitude of the exaltation of polarizability in (C60)2 and the related compounds. In addition, the effect can be typical for a wider class of nano-objects, e.g., oligomers of the other fullerenes and fullerene-like structures.While many additive schemes can be applied to the polarizability of molecular systems (e.g., free-atom and dressed-atom additive models58), we note that the exaltations above are considered in terms of the additive rules described by eqn (4)–(7).3.3 Dependence of exaltation on the distance between the fullerene cores in (C60)nThere is a substantial scatter of Δα(I) and Δα(II) values for (C60)n molecules with the same n (Table 1). To determine the reasons of the emerged inequality, we have scrutinized the relationship between the exaltations of the (C60)n oligomers and their molecular structure. We have used the largest distances between the centers of the crosslinked C60 cages (Lmax) as a key structural parameter describing the dissimilarity of the fullerene oligomers (the maximal distances Lmax between the fullerene fragments in (C60)n molecules have been calculated as the distances between their centers of mass).Within each series of (C60)n molecules, Δα(I) values increase with Lmax though there is no general dependence that could unite the data on Δα(I) for all the studied compounds. Such a dependence has been found in the case of Δα(II). Being more accurate, the second additive scheme obtains a linear correlation between Δα(II) and Lmax values (Fig. 5). Only (C60)2 and the cyclic trimer (C60)3, both characterized by the smallest intercage distances (Lmax ≈ 9.1 Å), are outside the correlation. Fig. 5  Dependence of the exaltation of polarizability according to additive schemes I (a) and II (b) on the maximal distance between fullerene units in (C60)n molecules. White circles, red triangles, blue circles, and white squares correspond to oligomers with n = 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The data for (C60)2 and cyclic (C60)3 have not been included in the correlation. To explain the physical meaning of the correlation, we have referred to the basic definitions. Polarizability reflects the molecule's ability to acquire the induced dipole moment μind in the external electric field E (μind = αE). On the other hand, the magnitude of the dipole is proportional to the distance between the centers of the positive and negative charges of the molecule.15 Presumably, such centers are induced on the maximally remote atoms in (C60)n (the presence of such charges will be studied by Hirschfeld analysis of the electron distribution in our further work). Therefore, the exaltation increases with the distance between the C60 cages. This explains why Δα achieves its highest value for linear nanostructures, having the largest Lmax values.3.4 Experimental evidence for exaltation of polarizability of fullerene oligomers and correlations with their chemical propertiesFullerene dimers and, especially, trimers are novel compounds, so the data on their polarizability are absent. In addition, experimental obstacles to its measurement may be due to the propensity of (C60)n for decomposition1 and very low solubility in ordinary solvents.6 However, correlations between the calculated polarizabilities and observables can be found.As is known, the deduction of polarizability from solid-state measurements59 gives a value of 89.9 Å3, which is ∼15% larger than the values demonstrated by isolated C60 molecules (76.5 ± 8.0 Å3; molecular beam deflection19) or small clusters (79.0 ± 4.0 Å3; time-of-flight technique60). That enhancement has been explained by excitations and charge-transfer between the neighboring C60 molecules in a crystal.59 In our case, a somewhat similar enhancement takes place. Indeed, according to DFT-calculations, the mean polarizability per one cage for (C60)2 is ∼8.8% higher than the mean polarizability of isolated C60. Though it is lower than the solid-state effect, there is a significant difference in the experimental and computational situations: unlike in crystalline C60, fullerene cores are chemically bonded in oligomers. Notwithstanding this, the similar tendency in both cases allows the proposal of a common nature of these enhancements caused by the interactions between the π-electronic systems of C60 cores.In addition, recent advances in the application of polarizability to chemical reactions61–63 provide another way to find a correlation between the calculated exaltations and the observed chemical properties of (C60)2 and (C60)3. For example, the simplest decomposition reactions AmBn…Cp → mA + nB + … + pC are described by the following change in polarizability ΔαR:63 ΔαR = mαA + nαB + … + pαC − αAmBn…Cp(8)Moreover, linear correlations between the heat effects of the mentioned reactions and the ΔαR values have been found, as well as the minimum polarizability principle which states that thermodynamically more stable isomers are characterized by lower polarizabilities.62,63 This principle is also extended to dynamical cases.64 As is known, the fullerene dimer (C60)2 and its derivatives are unstable under thermal treatment.9 It is obvious that the deviation of polarizability from additive scheme I and ΔαR of the dimer decomposition (C60)2 → 2 C60 have a simple relationship: ΔαR = −Δα(I)(9)that is, the calculated exaltations should reflect the stability of the studied compounds. Therefore, Δα(I) values of (C60)2 and its two derivatives have been compared with the available experimental data (Table 3). We have used the results of the experimental studies on the formation/decomposition of two auxiliary compounds [C60(CR2)5]2 and C60(C60F16) (Fig. 6).65,66 These functionalized dimers are characterized by a lower number of double bonds in the molecules (48 and 50, respectively, compared with 58 for (C60)2). As shown above, this should result in a decrease in exaltation of polarizability and, according to the minimum polarizability principle,63 lead to higher stability compared to (C60)2. The exaltations of [C60(CH2)5]2 and C60(C60F16) are approximately equal and lower than Δα(I)((C60)2). It correlates well with the higher stability, observed experimentally for C60(C60F16) and the carboxy-derivative of [C60(CH2)5]2 (Table 3).

However, in contrast to (C60)2, C60(C60F16) is formed at softer conditions and is expected to be much more stable toward dissociation66 Fig. 6  Structures of dimers [C60(CH2)5]2 (top) and C60(C60F16) (bottom) for the additional calculations of the exaltation of polarizability. Comparison of Δα(I) values of (C60)2 and the trimers (14.6 compared with 28.3–37.0 Å3) predicts that the more polarizable trimers should be less stable. Indeed, the total yield of isomeric trimers is almost ten times lower than the yield of (C60)2.6 Moreover, the exaltation increases in the series e-(C60)3 < trans-4-(C60)3 < trans-3-(C60)3 < trans-2-(C60)3 that is inversely correlated with the measured content of isomeric (C60)3 in the experimentally obtained (C60)3 fraction (Fig. 7). Thus, the exaltation correlates with the stability of the fullerene trimers. Extrapolating from this approach, we can make a reasonable prognosis of the increasing instability of the largest oligomers, especially those having a linear structure. It can explain, for example, why linear trans-1-(C60)3 with the maximally distant cages, which seems to have no steric hindrances during its formation, has not been detected in the mixture of synthesized (C60)3. However, such structures may become synthetically achievable if the fullerene cores are functionalized, resulting in the wastage of their π-electronic systems and, as a consequence, possessing higher stability (similar to C60(C60F16) and [C60(CR2)5]2 in comparison with (C60)2).

Experimental data are taken from ref. 6. 3.5 Insights for the molecular design of molecules with enhanced polarizability and their use in nanodevicesNote briefly how the exaltation of polarizability can be used in the design of nanomaterials and nanodevices. Demonstrating the relationship between the polarizable and structural characteristics of fullerene oligomers, we have come to the conclusion that the most significant enhancement of mean polarizability is observed in the case of many-cage fullerene-based molecules with maximally remote C60 cores. Unfortunately, this also makes the molecules less stable. The linear correlation found may be a landmark for the rational design of fullerene-based nanostructures with an adjustable response to electric fields. Currently, it seems to be the only way to estimate the mean polarizability of the C60 fullerene linear polymers with analogous structures (such polymers have been synthesized and recommended as nanofuses; at the same time their fragility has been noted67).The molecular switch is a widespread concept in molecular machinery.68 It consists of the ability of a molecular system to exist in two or more stable states. Analogously, we assume a bi-cage fullerene system with cores, connected by X bridge (Fig. 8). The state of the system A is characterized by a short distance between fullerene cores. If X undergoes a transformation to Y, that changes its linear size (e.g., the well-known photo-induced isomerization or conformational change), and the system enters the state B with a greater remoteness of fullerene fragments. In the second state, the molecular system obtains a higher polarizability and, consequently, an enhanced response to an external electric field. In contrast to state A, it can be facilely manipulated by the external electric field. Fig. 8  Hypothetical bi-cage fullerene-containing system existing in two states characterized with lower (A) and enhanced (B) responses to an external electric field. Another opportunity arising from the polarizability of multi-cage fullerene molecules deals with their potential application in organic electronics, e.g., their transport properties. As shown in the previous work,69 for C60 derivatives with aliphatic functionalization, as the length of the aliphatic side chain increases, the configurational disorder increases and thus the mobility decreases. However, the case of C60 oligomers is a rather different situation because their molecules are rigid. We can indirectly estimate their aptness to organic photovoltaic applications in terms of the recent approach operating with anisotropy of polarizability.29 We have shown previously that the most isotropic regioisomers of C60 derivatives demonstrate the highest output parameters (power conversion efficiency and open-circuit voltage), being used as acceptor materials in organic solar cells, and, vice versa, the use of the most anisotropic regioisomers leads to the lowest ones. The respective anisotropies of the C60 dimer and oligomers are collected in Table 1. Analyzing them, we can assume, for example, that among the regioisomeric trimers (C60)3 the highest output parameters may be expected from the organic solar cells with an equatorial isomer that has the lowest anisotropy. Analogously, cyclic and “+”-shaped isomers should be preferred among the (C60)4 and (C60)5 series for the mentioned application.ConclusionsIn the present work, the first DFT study on the polarizability of the fullerene dimer and oligomers (C60)n (n = 1–5) molecules has been performed. These bulky (C60)n molecules were found to be highly polarizable; their mean polarizabilities are several times larger than the respective value of the parent fullerene.The most intriguing point in the studied dependence of the (C60)n mean polarizability on the number of fullerene units in a molecule is its nonlinear behavior. We have found a positive deviation of the calculated mean polarizabilities from the additive schemes, i.e. the exaltation of polarizability. This effect increases with a larger remoteness of the C60 cores in (C60)n molecules and becomes highest for fullerene oligomers with a linear structure. Its magnitude in most of the cases is enough to be detectable by experimental techniques that are commonly used for polarizability measurements.The exaltation of (C60)n polarizability is caused by the interaction of n π-electronic systems of C60 cores which, however, remain separated in the molecules. As shown, the dimers of the π-conjugated bowl-shaped hydrocarbons (considered as fragments of C60) demonstrate analogous positive deviations. In this case, the exaltation becomes greater with an increase in the number of double bonds in the hydrocarbon molecule. Thus, the size of the π-system is the major factor defining the magnitude of exaltation.The exaltation of polarizability studied theoretically in this work seems to be similar to the enhancement of the polarizability of crystalline forms of C60 compared to the molecular one. This supports the reliability of the performed DFT study. In addition, we have compared the calculated exaltation values with the basic chemical properties of fullerene dimers and trimers. Although this may be considered as an indirect manifestation of polarizability exaltation, there is a strong correlation between the calculated Δα values and the stabilities of isomeric (C60)3, (C60)2 and its derivatives. The most stable compounds in this set are characterized by the lowest exaltations. Unfortunately, it means that linear oligomers (C60)4 and (C60)5 should be less stable than their isomers with a more compact arrangement of the fullerene cores. However, the exaltation may be useful for molecular machinery. We have proposed a hypothetical double-cage fullerene-based system which has a different magnitude of the response to external electric fields in two states with the closest and the largest distances between the C60 fragments.In conclusion, the non-additivity of fullerene oligomers’ polarizability may cause the non-additivities of numerous polarizability-dependent properties. This fact should be taken into account during the molecular design of fullerene-based materials and nanodevices.AcknowledgementsThe work was supported by the Presidium of Russian Academy of Sciences (Program No. 24 “Foundations of Basic Research of Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials”).ReferencesK.
