    , Accepted 17th February 2021First published on 18th February 2021AbstractThe limited resources and uneven distribution of lithium stimulate strong motivation to develop new rechargeable batteries that use alternative charge carriers. Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are at the top of the list of alternatives because of the abundant raw materials and relatively high energy density, fast ion transport kinetics in the electrolyte, and low cost. However, several challenges still hinder the development of PIBs, such as low reversible capacity, poor rate performance, and inferior cycling stability. Research on the cathode is currently focused on developing materials with high energy density and cycling stability, mainly including layered transition metal oxides, polyanion compounds, organic compounds, etc. Anodes based on intercalation reactions, conversion reactions, and alloying with potassium are currently under development, and promising results have been published. This review comprehensively summarizes the research effort to date on the electrode material optimization (e.g., crystals, morphology, reaction mechanisms, and interface control), the synthesis methods, and the full cell fabrication for PIBs to enhance the electrochemical potassium storage and provide a platform for further development in this battery system.

Broader context
The current limited and uneven distributions of lithium resources in the world, coupled with the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the dependence on renewable energy, have motivated the pursuit for efficient alternatives to commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Rechargeable potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are promising candidates due to the abundance of potassium resources, high operating voltage, and considerable theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, this battery system faces serious challenges for the requirements of commercialization, such as short cycle life, low rate performance, and limited practical capacities. To get closer toward the industrial utilization of PIBs, all the battery components should be carefully optimized and thoroughly studied. Here, the latest developments on PIBs are systematically reviewed, and innovative electrode designs are highlighted to inspire future research and development. The challenges and limitations of each electrode material are summarized alongside the reaction mechanisms and the electrode/electrolyte interaction. This review introduces new insights and an outlook, and suggests future directions and challenges, which can be used as a platform for further developing and optimizing PIBs, moving them forward to wider and large-scale applications.

1. Introduction
Large-scale energy storage is expected to play a critical role in enhancing the stability, security, and reliability of tomorrow's electrical power grid, including the support of intermittent renewable resources.1 Electrochemical energy storage devices are practical candidate solutions due to their high energy density, flexibility, scalability, and pollution-free operation. Batteries represent an excellent energy storage technology, particularly for integrating renewable resources due to their compact size and distribution in location.1 Today, for example, sodium–sulfur (Na–S) battery technology is commercially available for grid applications, with some 300 installations worldwide, the largest of which was opened in Abu Dhabi in 2019 with a capacity of 108 MW/648 MWh.2 Lead acid batteries come next with a total of 77 MW discharge capacity.3 However, there is still a long way for current battery technologies to meet the durability, high-power operation, round-trip energy efficiency, and/or cost requirements for large-scale energy storage. Lead–acid batteries have a poor energy density, even at a limited depth of discharge.4 Redox flow batteries, such as the Na/NiCl2 ‘Zebra’ battery, and various conventional lead–acid system modifications cannot operate at sufficiently high rates.5,6 Na–S cells are expensive, as are the metal hydride/nickel cells currently used in hybrid automobiles.7 Also, batteries are probably the only available solution to power portable and wearable electronics.8 The vast growing dependence on electric and hybrid vehicles adds more pressure on the battery market, with more requirements on the rate performance and safety.9,10
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the front-runner for applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, have recently begun to penetrate the grid-scale stationary electric energy storage market.11–16 In 2017, Tesla launched the world's largest lithium-ion battery plant with a 100 MW/129 MWh capacity in South Australia.17 General Electric introduced a 1 MW portable unit in 2019, which provides more remote renewable energy facility options.18 Lithium-ion batteries have several features that made them the most popular battery such as the high voltage (>3.6 V) and energy density (>120 W h kg−1), low self-discharge, and excellent rate capabilities.19–25 To meet the demand for energy storage application, the lithium production around the world increased from 31700 tons in 2014 to 77000 tons in 2019.26 The increase in the production is associated with a steep increase in the material cost,27,28 with the price of Li2CO3 increased from $5180 per ton in 2010 to −$7400 per ton in December 2020.29,30 The United States Geological Survey estimated that the USA alone would need 54000 tons of lithium a year to meet lithium's demand in rechargeable batteries by 2050. Therefore, there are concerns that if the dependence on LIBs continues to increase on the same level, it might deplete the Earth of lithium resources.31,32
Compared to lithium, both sodium and potassium (Fig. 1a) are more abundant in the Earth's crust, as shown in Fig. 1b (0.0017, 2.3, and 1.5 wt% for Li, Na and K, respectively).33 Early in 2020, it was estimated that the world resources of potassium are about 250 billion tons.33–35 In addition, sodium and potassium resources are available worldwide, in contrast with lithium resources, which are mainly concentrated in South America. The prices of metals, carbonates, or layered oxides of sodium and potassium are all much cheaper than those of the corresponding lithium compounds.36 Therefore, both potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered suitable alternatives for LIBs.37–43 The working principle of PIBs and SIBs is similar to that of the LIB system, which is a “rocking chair model” based on K and Na ion insertion into the cathode and anode materials (Fig. 1c).

(a) Basic data about potassium; (b) comparison between lithium, sodium, and potassium elements; (c) the schematic illustration of the “rocking chair” model of PIBs for power batteries; and (d) the number of published papers on PIBs according to Web of Science (as of December 2020). 
As in other metal-ion batteries, the electrolyte of PIBs conducts the ionic component of the electrodes’ chemical reactions, and it promotes the electronic components to transfer through an external circuit. Current collectors, usually copper or aluminum foil, provide the electrodes’ mechanical support and facilitate the electronic transport between the electrodes’ redox centers and the external circuit.44–47
A rechargeable PIB cell runs on the basis of several reversible electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. Taking the reversible intercalation reaction as an example, the chemical reactions at the potassium-containing layered metal oxide KMO2 (where M is Mn, Co or Ni) cathode and the graphite anode can be described as follows:45,48 Cathode: KMO2 ↔ K1−xMO2 + xK+ + xe−(1) Anode: xK+ + 8C + xe− ↔ KxC8(2) All: KMO2 + 8C ↔ K1−xMO2 + KxC8(3)
During the discharge process, K+ ions firstly deintercalate from the layered structure of KMO2, while the repulsive force of oxygen between the layers increases, enhancing the layer spacing and further causing a multi-stage phase change from KMO2 to K1−xMO2.45 For the graphite anode, the K+ ions from the potassium salt intercalate into the graphite layers during the discharge process to form graphite intercalation compounds (GICs).49 The largest and most stable stoichiometric GIC is KC8 with a theoretical specific capacity of 279 mA h g−1, which is similar to LiC6 in LIBs.12 During the charging process, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is formed, providing protection for the anode and ensuring a stable capacity after several cycles.19
The potassium ion has a more negative standard electrode potential vs. SHE than sodium (−2.93 V for K+/K vs. −2.71 V for Na+/Na), which guarantees a higher operating voltage and higher energy density for batteries.31,50 In addition, the standard voltage of the K+/K redox couple in propylene carbonate is lower than both Li+/Li and Na+/Na,51 promoting high energy density in full cells. Furthermore, potassium does not alloy with aluminum, making it possible to use the cheaper aluminum foil ($2042 per tonne on December 31, 2020)52 as the current collector instead of copper foil ($7951 per tonne on December 31, 2020)53 traditionally used in commercial LIBs, reducing both the weight and the cost of PIBs.36 Moreover, due to the weaker Lewis acidity, K+ with the largest atomic radius (1.38 Å) shows the smallest Stokes radius in some organic solvents among the three alkali metal ions (K+ (3.6 Å) < Na+ (4.6 Å) < Li+ (4.8 Å)).36 Thus, K+ has the highest ionic conductivity (−10 mS cm−1 in 1 M PC) amongst all the alkali ions in propylene carbonate (PC) solvents.36,54 In terms of the solvation structure, both Na+ and K+ have disordered and flexible structures, unlike Li+, which shows a well-defined shell with a tetrahedral arrangement of the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the EC molecule.55 The less ordered solvation structure is reflected in the lowest desolvation of K+ in EC (4.12 eV compared with 4.72 eV for Na+ and 5.85 eV for Li+), satisfying faster K+ diffusion and hence a higher charge/discharge rate.56 It should be mentioned that, despite the higher atomic mass of K, the formula weight ratios of alkali metal ions in the respective metal oxide cathode materials, for example, the layered cobalt oxides (LiCoO2, P2-type Na2/3CoO2, and P2-type K2/3CoO2), only increase slightly from Li+ to K+ ions. Motivated by the aforementioned advantages, there is increasing interest from both academia and industry to develop PIBs to meet the requirements of future stationary and portable energy storage applications.40,45,55 The growing number of published papers since 2015 (Fig. 1d) is an indicator of the belief in PIBs as future large-scale energy storage systems (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  The conception of the potential applications of PIBs to better support the future of human life. 
However, PIB systems are still facing several challenges that slow down their widespread applications.33 First, the larger potassium ion makes the volumetric changes during the charge/discharge process more significant for PIBs than other alkali metal-ion batteries, causing structural instability of the electrodes.45 Second, the low diffusivity of K+ in the solid electrode materials constitutes limitations on the rate performances.57 Finally, the electrolyte in PIBs suffers from severe decomposition and several parasitic reactions due to the high potential of K+/K redox.55 Therefore, the development of PIBs is urgently needed, such as the discovery of new cathode and anode materials. Up to our knowledge, a few comprehensive review papers on PIBs have been published in the last two years.31,33,44–47,57 However, studies on PIBs increased sharply during this period, suggesting that the research direction and content are expanded and extended, including the development of various electrode materials, electrolytes, and full cell PIBs. In this review, detailed progress on the design and development of cathode and anode materials, electrolytes, and solvents of PIBs, as well as the synthesis methods and full cell fabrication, is comprehensively reviewed, as shown in Fig. 3. We begin with a current overview of cathode materials, including Prussian blue and its potassium-containing analogues, layered transition metal oxides, polyanion compounds, organic cathode materials, and all the attempts to improve their specific capacities (Fig. 4). Next, the recent strategies and advances on anode materials are explored in detail, with a focus on the relationship between the material characteristics (i.e., composition, structure, and morphology) and their electrochemical performance (such as the capacity, cycling stability and rate performance) of the intercalation materials, conversion materials, and alloying materials. Then, the common synthesis methods of electrode materials are introduced for further commercial application. Additionally, a brief introduction to the recently studied full cell PIBs, including the full cell design of electrode materials, electrolytes, solvents, and separators, along with the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, is also concluded in the context. This review critically discusses the existent challenges and possible perspectives for low-cost and high-performance cathode and anode materials in various directions. Finally, we further suggest solutions for the development of practical full-cell fabrication of PIB systems including the possible approaches for electrolyte optimization, separators, electrode fabrication, and highly safe structure design, which would provide possible future development of next-generation PIBs and promote their evolution from experimental research to potential practical application in the near future.

2. Cathode materials
2.1 Prussian blue and its analogues

2.1.1 Reaction mechanism. 
Prussian blue (PB) and its potassium-containing analogues (PBAs) are among the most competitive cathode materials for PIBs, because of their advantages such as the open framework, structural controllability, excellent cycling stability, easy preparation, and low cost.58–63 As early as 1936, Keggin and Miles proposed PB's first face-centered cubic structure hypothesis.64 Then, in 1962, Melvin B. Robin65 determined the detailed structure and electronic configuration of dye PB with a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, as shown in Fig. 5a. The general chemical formula of PBAs can be expressed as AxM[M′(CN)6]1−y·nH2O (0 < x < 2, y < 1), where A represents the alkali-metal ion (such as K, Na, or Li39,66,67) and M (or M′) is the transition-metal ion, such as Ni, Fe, and Mn.68–70 When K ions replace A, a better reversible potassium storage capacity could be presented at a higher x value. The exchangeable transition-metal ions at M and M′ are coordinated by nitrogen and carbon, respectively, interconnected by a cyanide (CN) ligand. Each unit cell of PBAs has eight subunit cells with eight available interstitial sites that can accommodate neutral molecules and transition ions.71 When ions are inserted in PBAs, either interstitially or substantially, electric neutrality is maintained with abundant open channels and gap locations. The open frame could promote rapid diffusion of various embedded ions in the PBA structure, which is beneficial to the rate performance. Furthermore, water molecules can also enter into PBA crystals’ interstitial sites (Fig. 5b) without any obvious structural changes, significantly influencing the electrochemical performance.72 The following formula shows the reaction mechanism of PBAs: KxMII[M′II(CN)6]·nH2O ↔ Kx−yMIII[M′III(CN)6]·nH2O + yK+ + ye−(4)

(d) Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of KHCF@PPy (a); SEM of pure KHCF (b) and KHCF@PPy (c); and TEM image of KHCF@PPy (d) and KHCF (insert of (d)). 
The K+ insertion/extraction proceeds via a solid-state process during charge and discharge. The MII//MIII and M′II//M′III redox pairs control the electrochemical storage by insertion (extraction) of the K+ ions from the PBA lattice.


2.1.2 Electrochemical performance and optimization. 
Numerous studies have focused on optimizing the PBA composition by doping and co-doping with Fe, Co, Ni, Zn and Mn ions.73,74 Huang et al.75 synthesized a multivariate PBA containing Ni, Co, and Fe (PBN0.4C0.6) by controlling the Co and Fe content through the synthesis conditions. The as-prepared PB has dense spherical packing morphology, with nickel and cobalt elements evenly distributed in the particles. The prepared PBN0.4C0.6 could deliver a discharge capacity of up to 135 mA h g−1, higher than that of the blank PB (120 mA h g−1). The PBN0.4C0.6 electrode exhibited excellent cycling performance with 83.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. Several studies suggested that hydrated PBA electrodes are also efficient for water-based PIBs.76 For example, Xia et al.77 reported excellent performance of a commercial FeIII4[FeII(CN)6]3·3.4H2O cathode in aqueous PIBs. As shown in Fig. 5c, the specific capacity could reach 80 mA h g−1 at 1C, along with 82.4% retention over 500 cycles. Recently, hydrated PBAs also showed good electrochemical properties in non-aqueous PIBs. Zhang et al.78 prepared K0.220Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.805·4.01H2O by a precipitation method. The prepared electrode achieved a reversible capacity of 73.2 mA h g−1 and good cyclic stability with a capacity decay rate as small as ≈0.09% per cycle.
Although these PBA electrodes have exhibited excellent cycling stability during the charge/discharge process, their low potassium content always limits adequate reversible specific capacity, which is only around 68.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Therefore, several studies were focused on improving the stoichiometry of K ions in PBA cathode materials. Luo et al.79 synthesized a titanium-doped PBA electrode K0.3Ti0.75Fe0.25[Fe(CN)6]0.95·2.8H2O by a co-precipitation method. The electrode showed a high reversible specific capacity of 136.7mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with a first cycle efficiency of 118%. Xue et al.80 also prepared a manganese-containing PBA electrode (K1.89Mn[Fe(CN)6]0.92·0.75H2O, KMHCF) by a precipitation method, and were able to increase the potassium content to 1.89, which is very close to its theoretical value of 2. The high-spin MnIII/MnII and low-spin FeIII/FeII with similar energies resulted in two potential platforms centered at 3.6 V. The KMHCF nanoparticles with a diameter of about 40 nm were able to deliver a specific capacity as high as 146.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. Consistent with the ex-situ XRD results to track their structure during charging and discharging, the modified PBA also presented good reversibility from 0.2 to 2C. Huang et al.81 prepared a ternary K2NixCo1−xFe(CN)6 cathode by co-doping with Ni and Co ions connected to the N end. This ternary compound also exhibited a high initial capacity of 86 mA h g−1 with a retention of 98% after 50 cycles.
Additionally, mixing PBAs with other conductive materials has also been examined to enhance their cycling stability and rate capability in PIBs. Chen et al.82 proposed a polypyrrole-modified PB material (KHCF@PPy) via an in situ polymerization coating method (Fig. 5d). PPy improved the composite's conductivity and reduced the defect concentration, resulting in a discharge capacity as high as 88.9 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and good cyclability for up to 500 cycles. When the current density increased to 1000 mA g−1, the initial discharge capacity could still keep 72.1 mA h g−1 with 85.7% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Dryfe et al.83 reported a carbon nanotube/PB nanocomposite as a freestanding transparent thin film electrode for aqueous rechargeable PIBs. The fabricated coin-cell devices with the nanocomposite cathode and an activated carbon anode presented a capacity of 47.6 mA h g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 with an energy density of 33.75 W h kg−1. Zarbin et al.84 also synthesized a graphene/PB nanocomposite film that delivered a specific capacity up to 141 mA h g−1 at 0.093 A g−1. All these composition and structure optimizations, surface modification, and composite methods could represent promising strategies to promote PBA cathodes’ practical applications in PIBs.


2.1.3 Future challenges and development. 
Since most PBAs are prepared using aqueous solution system processes, the existence of interstitial water is unavoidable. The interstitial water improves the crystallinity of the cathode materials and subsequently may have a negative impact on the specific capacity. Taking SIBs as an example, slowing down the crystal growth rate in the synthesis of the PBA electrode and a subsequent heat treatment process can effectively reduce the interstitial water content, thereby improving the electrochemical performances.85,86 Also, by increasing the proportions and changing the types of coordination ions in PBAs, the active sites available for the electrochemical process increase, leading to more facile electrolyte/electrode interaction. Increasing the PBA potassium content may be another challenge, and more research should be devoted to developing such materials.

2.2 Layered transition metal oxides

2.2.1 Reaction mechanism. 
In the commercial application of LIBs and SIBs, layered transition metal oxides dominate as cathode materials because of their high energy density, excellent stability, and low cost.87–90 In the layered oxide structure, transition metal and alkali ions segregate into alternating slabs with abundant two-dimensional open frameworks, which could also benefit large K+ ion migration.48,91–93 Generally, layered transition metal oxides can be represented by different symbols. For example, O or P describes the alkali metal phase collateral octahedron or coplanar prism, respectively. The number in the symbol indicates the periodicity of the stack. P2-KMO2 means prismatic K metal and MO2 sheets in the crystal structure. The following formula indicates the generally accepted reaction mechanism of layered transition metal oxides: KMO2 ↔ K1−xMO2 + xK+ + xe−(5)
During the charge and discharge process, K+ ions can be inserted and extracted in the framework structure (typical octahedral sites and prismatic sites) formed by MO2, accompanied by the transformation of the phase structure.


2.2.2 Electrochemical performance and optimization. 
K0.3MnO2, produced from potassium permanganate as raw material, is one of the earliest layered transition metal oxides used for PIB cathodes.94 Layered K0.3MnO2 has a two-layer orthorhombic unit-cell. Oxygen anions octahedrally coordinate the Mn atoms while the K+ ions are located between the transition metal layers with trigonal prismatic coordination. The as-prepared flake-like K0.3MnO2 cathodes delivered a reversible capacity of 125 mA h g−1. However, two intermediate stages were reported at 3.7 V and 3.9 V, causing the crystals’ irreversible expansion and further leading to quick capacity decay. By reducing the operating voltage upper limit, it was possible to avoid the formation of the intermediate phases, and the capacity was maintained at about 57% after 685 cycles.
In order to solve the capacity attenuation caused by the phase changes at high voltage, Choi et al.95 designed P2 type layered K0.83[Ni0.05Mn0.95]O2, which could retain the structure during charging to 4.3 V (vs. K+/K). By avoiding large volume expansion, this cathode showed excellent capacities of 155 mA h g−1 at a current density of 52 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 83% after 200 cycles and 120 mA h g−1 at a current density of 520 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 77% for 500 cycles. Kim et al.96 developed a P3-type K0.5MnO2 compound, which exhibited a reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 in the range 1.5–3.9 V. Guo et al.97 introduced cobalt ions to replace the manganese sites in the KxMnO2 layered oxide electrode material (Fig. 6a and b). With only 5% Co, the reversible capacity of cobalt-doped KxMnO2 increased by 30% at 22 mA g−1 and by 92% at 440 mA g−1 (Fig. 6c–e). Myung et al.98 also proposed another P3-K0.54[Co0.5Mn0.5]O2 cathode for PIBs with a high discharge capacity of 78 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Du et al.99 designed a new Ni/Mn-based P2-type K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2 layered oxide with a high specific capacity of 125.5 mA h g−1 at 10 mA g−1 and good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 67% over 500 cycles. After fabricating into a full cell using soft carbon as the counter electrode, the capacity retention could still reach about 90% over 500 cycles. Myung et al.100 also designed a similar P2-K0.75[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 cathode material via electrochemical ion-exchange from P2-Na0.75[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, which exhibited an unexpectedly high reversible capacity of about 91 mA h g−1 (1400 mA g−1) with an excellent capacity retention of 83% over 500 cycles. Recently, other transition metal element substituted layered manganese oxides, such as Fe-doped layered P3-type K0.45Mn1−xFexO2 (x ≤ 0.5), were also developed as low-cost promising cathode materials for high-performance PIBs.101 In addition to transition metal ions, doping permanganate with alkali elements was reported to be an effective way to enhance the electrochemical K storage properties. Liu et al.102 reported layered K0.67−xNaxNi0.17Co0.17Mn0.66O2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5), and they found that Na is stabilizing the layered structure, leading to a significant improvement in the specific capacity and rate performance. They reported a specific capacity of 62 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 when adding Na, compared with 47.8 mA h g−1 for the non-doped permanganate. Our group recently reported another strategy to improve the layered manganese oxide performance.103 The partial substitution of O with N atoms effectively improved the electronic conductivity and enlarged the interlayer spacing, which could accommodate more K+ intercalation and promote K+ migration. The prepared K0.6CoO2−-xNx nanoframe has enormous electrochemical active sites, which, combined with the unique hollow structure, delivered an enhanced reversible capacity of 86 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of about 77% over 400 cycles.

(h) Long-term cycling performance of the K0.77MnO2·H2O (S2) electrode compared with previously reported layered cathode materials. 
In addition to manganese-based cathodes, other layered transition metal oxides were also reported. For example, Hironaka et al.104 reported a P2-type KxCoO2 that can deliver a high reversible capacity of 60 mA h g−1 between 2.0 and 3.9 V. Masese et al.105 developed a high voltage (4.3 V vs. K+/K) honeycomb layered P2-type K2NiCoTeO6 cathode. The moderately inductive TeO66− framework helps stabilize the honeycomb-layered structure at a high average discharge voltage of 3.6 V versus K+/K. As a result, a reversible capacity of 70 mA h g−1 was reported. Various potassium vanadate compounds, including K2V3O8 and K0.486V2O5, were also reported for K storage with suitable reversible capacity.106,107 The development of layered transition metal oxide cathode materials is still imperative and essential for the improvement of PIBs, and we are expecting more work in this area in the near future.
Like PBAs, layered transition oxides suffer from low potassium content, limiting the amount of electrochemically active K ions in the PIB system. To solve this problem, Kim et al.108 reported P2-type layered K0.6CoO2 with a specific capacity of about 60 mA h g−1. However, the authors pointed out that the layered structure would be destroyed when the ratio of K/M (transition metal) is closer to 1. According to the electronic configuration and density functional theory, they also found that KScO2 and KCrO2 are thermodynamically stable and could be good candidates for PIB cathodes. A synthesized O3-type KCrO2 cathode material showed enhanced electrochemical performances with a reversible specific capacity of about 92 mA h g−1.109 To improve the cyclic stability of O3-type KCrO2, Pyo et al.110 proposed a slightly K-deficient compound P′3-type K0.8CrO2, which exhibited 99% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1C. K-Birnessite (s-KBir) has been synthesized as a promising cathode with a reversible capacity as high as 125 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, in which an ion exchange approach is applied to improve the K content in the s-KBir electrode.111 Myung et al.112 also confirmed that K0.28MnO2·0.15H2O could deliver a high reversible capacity of 150 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 15 mA g−1. Xia et al.113 designed several birnessite nanosheet arrays with high K content (K0.77MnO2·0.23H2O) by a “hydrothermal potassiation” process (Fig. 6f), demonstrating an ultrahigh reversible specific capacity of 134 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability (Fig. 6g and h).
Due to the large radius of K ions, layered structures always possess irreversible structural damage during charging and discharging, which leads to a rapid decline in battery capacity. Taking a lesson from the development of other alkali-metal ion batteries, engineering a porous nanostructured electrode could help to mitigate the structural damage challenge. One recent and interesting development is weaving a layered metal oxide into a stable skeleton. Mai et al.114 prepared K0.7Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 interconnected nanowires with a three-dimensional (3D) network structure (Fig. 7a–d). The porous structure promoted rapid K ion diffusion and resulted in a high rate performance. The relatively stable framework can also reduce the delamination of cathodes caused by the large volumetric change, promoting good cycling stability. Coupling with enhanced electronic conductivity provided by a carbon framework, the interconnected K0.7Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 nanowires exhibited a high discharge capacity and excellent cycling stability. When used as a cathode material for K-ion full batteries, the capacity retention was 76% after 250 cycles (Fig. 7e and f). Deng et al.115 prepared P2-type layered K0.65Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 (P2-sKFMO) microspheres using a solvothermal method, which, when used to fabricate the electrode, provided enough voids to accommodate the volumetric changes. The capacity retention rate after 350 cycles was 78% at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Similar microspheres were prepared from P3 type layered K0.5Mn0.72Ni0.15Co0.13O2,116 and maintained 75% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 200 mA g−1.

2.2.3 Future challenges and development. 
Although layered transition metal oxide cathode materials have shown excellent stability in commercial LIBs, the huge challenges for developing layered transition metal oxides, such as complicated phase transitions, the concomitant intercalation of various species, low intercalation potentials, and steeper voltage curves with more voltage steps compared to those of LIBs and SIBs, still limit their commercial application. In future studies, optimization, including chemical composition design and structural control to stabilize the layered structure and inhibit the volume change caused by K ions during intercalation and deintercalation, is urgently expected to improve their electrochemical performance for commercial application.

2.3 Polyanionic compounds

2.3.1 Reaction mechanism. 
Polyanionic compounds, including various compounds containing tetrahedral and octahedral anionic structural groups (AOm)n− (A = P, S, Mo, W, etc.), have attracted much attention as cathode materials for alkali-ion batteries.117–120 In the field of LIBs, iron phosphate lithium (LiFePO4) is the most widely used polyanionic compound.121,122 These compounds have a strong covalent framework and an inductive effect of the anionic group and an open channel structure with low diffusion energy for alkali metal ions, giving them the advantages of low oxygen loss, high thermal stability, high operation potential, and long cycling stability. Therefore, polyanionic compounds are considered as promising cathode materials for PIBs. The following is the general formula for the reaction mechanism of KMPO4 (M = Fe and Mn) in PIBs: KMPO4 ↔ K1−xMPO4 + xK+ + xe−(6)
During charge and discharge, the redox reaction of M transition metal ions provides specific capacity with the insertion and extraction of K ions. The (PO4)3− anion is in tetrahedral or octahedral coordination in the crystal structure, and its inductive effect improves the redox potential of M ions.


2.3.2 Electrochemical performance and optimization. 
The insertion/extraction of larger K ions in olivine phase FePO4 damages the structural stability, unlike when LiFePO4 is used in LIBs. To overcome this challenge, Mathew et al.123 reported a porous structure of amorphous iron phosphate with a short-range-ordered structure for K ion storage. They found that the amorphous FePO4 gradually converts into a crystalline phase during K ion insertion and then return to the amorphous state through the extraction process. The porous structure also shortens the electrolyte diffusion pathway, and accommodates large volumetric changes, leading to improved cycling performances. When the current density is 5 mA g−1, this FePO4 compound reached a specific capacity of 156 mA h g−1 with almost 70% of its theoretical capacity after 50 cycles. However, amorphous FePO4 exhibits a lower operating potential (2.1–2.4 V), which is not suitable for high-voltage PIBs.
Pyrophosphate and fluorophosphate have also been investigated as potential polyanionic compounds for cathode materials for PIBs.124–126 Most of these polyanion compounds usually contain iron and/or vanadium elements and have shown excellent electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs.127,128 Han et al.129 reported a porous composite of K3V2(PO4)3 with carbon that can be operated at a high potential of 3.6–3.9 V. However, this electrode material presents a reversible specific capacity of about 50 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1. Chen et al.130 also synthesized Rb-doped K3−xRbxV2(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07) composites for high-voltage cathodes via a facile sol–gel process. The Rb-doped composites delivered better electrochemical performance than the undoped K3V2(PO4)3/C. The doped materials’ recorded initial discharge capacity was 55.7 mA h g−1 in the voltage range of 2.5–4.6 V at 20 mA g−1. The cyclic stability was also better after doping, with the recorded discharge capacities decreased to 32.1 and 52.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles for K3V2(PO4)3/C and K2.95Rb0.05V2(PO4)3/C, respectively. Zhang et al.131 reported a K3V2(PO4)2F3 compound adopted from its counterpart with SIBs, Na3V2(PO4)2F3, as a robust cathode for PIBs. Using in situ XRD analysis, they found that about two K ions could be provided in the electrode with a volume change of only 6.2% during the insertion/extraction process. As a result, K3V2(PO4)2F3 exhibited a capacity of over 100 mA h g−1 with a high average potential of −3.7 V vs. K+/K. Moreover, two similar vanadium-based cathode materials, KVOPO4 and KVPO4F, have also been investigated.132–134 These compounds also contain open frame structures composed of VO6 octahedra and covalently bonded PO4 tetrahedra. Chihara et al.132 reported that KVOPO4 and KVPO4F could keep good stability at a charging voltage of 5 V because of their minor volume changes (3.3% and 5.8%, respectively) between charge and discharge. Both compounds also exhibited excellent rate performance, which was confirmed at high current densities. Chen et al.133 reported layered KVOPO4 with controllable morphologies via a hydrothermal method. The layered cathode material showed a high capacity of 115 mA h g−1 (0.2C, 1C = 120 mA h g−1) and good cycling stability with 86.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles (0.5C). They further assembled a long lifespan K-ion full cell based on KVPO4F/VPO4 with a high operating voltage of 3.1 V, high capacity of 101 mA h g−1, and a considerable capacity retention of 86.8% over 2000 cycles.135
Transition metal-based pyrophosphate compounds (KAP2O7, A = Ti, V, Mn, etc.) are also one type of polyanionic compounds that have shown promising results in LIBs and SIBs.136 Park et al.137 screened out seven pyrophosphates (KVP2O7, KTiP2O7, KFeP2O7, KCrP2O7, KMoP2O7, KNiP2O7, and KCoP2O7) as cathode candidates for PIBs via density functional theory calculations and inorganic crystal structure data. Amongst them, the KVP2O7 material showed relatively pronounced redox peaks, which has a high discharge potential of about 4.2 V during the charge and discharge process. The reversible phase transition between monoclinic KVP2O7 and triclinic K1−xVP2O7 (x ≈ 0.6) also resulted in a specific capacity of about 60 mA h g−1, corresponding to an energy density of 253 W h kg−1 at 0.25C. Kim et al.138 introduced K4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) as a cathode material for PIBs after first-principles theoretical prediction. K4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) allows about −3 mol of K+ de/intercalation per formula unit with a small volume change of −4% during the charge/discharge process, leading to a large specific capacity of −118 mA h g−1 at 6 mA g−1. Because of the low activation barrier energy for K+ diffusion, almost −70% of the theoretical specific capacity of K4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) could be retained after increasing the current density to 600 mA g−1, and 82% of the initial capacity could be reserved after 500 cycles.
Recently, titanium-based cathodes have attracted more attention to K storage systems. Kim et al.139 introduced a rhombohedral KTi2(PO4)3 cathode material modified by a carbon network. The composite exhibited a large capacity of 126 mA h g−1 (about 98.5% of its theoretical capacity) with a capacity retention rate of 89% after 500 cycles. Detail structural analyses indicated that the electrochemical reaction for the de/intercalation of K ions in the KTi2(PO4)3 structure could be the Ti4+/3+ biphasic redox process between the KTi4+2(PO4)3 and K3Ti3+2(PO4)3 phases in the voltage range of 1–4 V (vs. K+/K). Fedotov et al.140 reported a record-breaking titanium-based cathode material, KTiPO4F, which can sustain an electrode potential of 3.6 V in the PIB system. Coating the titanate compound with carbon, a very low energy barrier for K ion migration was obtained, leading to no capacity fading after cycling at a 5C rate for 100 cycles. These results confirmed that the titanium redox activity could be upshifted to near 4 V electrode potentials, opening the door to design sustainable and cost-effective titanium-based cathode materials with promising electrochemical performances for PIBs.
Some other complex potassium compounds, such as sulfates and oxycarbide, that have been tested in SIBs141,142 have also been investigated for PIBs. Cheng et al.143 reported fluoroxalate KFeC2O4F, known as a frustrated magnet, as a cathode material for PIBs (Fig. 8a and b). The fluoroxalate exhibited an outstanding discharge capacity of −112 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with 94% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (Fig. 8c). The authors attributed the unprecedented cycling stability to the rigid [FeC2O4F] framework and the open channels, which significantly minimize the volume fluctuation during the intrinsic Fe2+/3+ redox reaction (Fig. 8d–h). The authors also investigated KFeC2O4F in a full cell configuration by pairing with a soft carbon anode. The full cell exhibited impressive rate performance and 0.003% capacity decay within 200 cycles, as well as an excellent energy density of −235 W h kg−1 (Fig. 8i and j). Potassium-based fluorosulfates, such as KFeSO4F,144 were also synthesized as cathodes for K+ storage because of their spacious channels formed by the MO4F2 octahedra and SO4 groups. Feng et al.145 reported a new high-performance hydroxysulfate cathode material, K2Fe3(SO4)3(OH)2(H2O)2, for rechargeable alkali-ion (Li, Na, and K) batteries by a facile hydrothermal method. In the three alkali ion electrolytes, K2Fe3(SO4)3(OH)2(H2O)2 could exhibit good electrochemical activity, reversibility, stability, and rate performances, which also proposed a new design strategy for K-based polyanionic compounds as cathode materials of PIB systems.

2.3.3 Future challenges and development. 
The stable frame structure of polyanionic compounds and the possibility of exchanging the anions make them a strong candidate for high voltage and high energy PIBs. However, there are few studies on polyanionic compounds as cathodes for PIB systems compared to LIBs and SIBs.146 Polyanionic compounds have a variety of structures and compositions. Designing new polyanionic compounds and characterizing the materials well, both experimentally and using atomic simulations, would significantly improve their performance. K-based polyanionic compounds always have low tap density, which would result in low volumetric energy density. Moreover, common electrolytes will decompose at high voltage, resulting in low cyclic stability and Coulombic efficiency. Therefore, future research should also focus on developing new electrolytes that can match the high operating voltage of polyanionic compounds.

2.4 Organic materials

2.4.1 Reaction mechanism. 
Unlike traditional rigid inorganic materials, organic materials have several merits for rechargeable battery applications, such as versatile chemical structures, electrochemical stability, flexible structures, abundance, lower cost, and environmentally friendly nature.147–150 Because of their weak intermolecular interactions, the large K+ ions could easily de/intercalate into these organic frameworks, achieving good specific capacity and rate performance as PIB electrodes. Taking the first reported 3,4,9,10-per-tetracarboxylic acid-dianhydride (PTCDA) cathode material as an example,151 the following reactions take place during the charge and discharge process: PTCDA + 2K+ + 2e− ↔ K2PTCDA (+2K+ + 2e− → K4PTCDA + 2K+ + 2e− → K11PTCDA)(7)
The electrode material formed a K11PTCDA compound with K ions at a low discharge potential of 0.01 V and presented a specific capacity of ∼753 mA h g−1. K2PTCDA and K4PTCDA are formed at a potential of 1.5–3.5 V, resulting in a considerable specific capacity of 131 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1. The discharge/charge platforms of PTCDA were obvious, but the specific capacity dropped rapidly to about 60% after only 35 cycles. Xing et al.152 also introduced a PTCDA material with similar electrochemical performance.


2.4.2 Electrochemical performance and optimization. 
The functional groups that lead to the electrochemically active sites for oxidation/reduction have been investigated in recent studies. Jian et al.153 synthesized a polyanthraquinone sulfide (PAQS) electrode, which exhibited a reversible specific capacity of −200 mA h g−1 at a current density of 20 mA g−1. Compared with PTCDA, the PAQS electrode achieved better cycling stability, with the specific capacity dropping to −150 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) cathode material reported by Fan et al.154 showed a greatly improved cycling stability with a capacity retention of 75.5% after 500 cycles. However, the rate capability and the performance at a high discharge rate were limited, with a recorded reversible capacity of only 60 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. Wang et al.155 investigated a high-performance cathode polypentenone sulfide (PPTS) for PIBs. The PPTS electrode's specific capacity was determined to be 260 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. After 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1, the electrode could maintain a capacity of 190 mA h g−1. The electrode also showed an impressive rate performance with specific capacity as high as 163 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Fan et al.156 reported perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) as an organic cathode for PIBs, delivering a stable capacity of ∼120 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 4 A g−1 in half cells. When fabricating into full cells, the PTCDI cathode displayed an average capacity of −127 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 over 30 cycles. Then, Fan and his group further developed an insoluble [N,N′-bis(2-anthraquinone)]-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxydiimide (PTCDI-DAQ) organic cathode (Fig. 9a), with an enhanced initial capacity of 211 mA h g−1. This capacity can be maintained at a high value of 133 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1 (Fig. 9b and c), using 1 M KPF6 in dimethoxyethane (DME) as the electrolyte.157 When coupled with a reduced potassium terephthalate (K4TP) anode in a full cell configuration, the resulting cell could achieve a super long lifespan with a discharge capacity of 62 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 3 A g−1 (Fig. 9d). The reported energy and power densities were 295 W h kg−1cathode (213 mA h g−1cathode × 1.38 V) and 13800 W Kg−1cathode (94 mA h g−1 × 1.38 V @ 10 A g−1) at a working voltage of 0.2–3.2 V, respectively. Even higher energy and power densities were achieved by Troshin et al.,158 who designed a high-voltage cathode using poly(N-phenyl-5,10-dihydrophenazine) (p-DPPZ). The p-DPPZ electrode presented an impressive specific capacity of 162 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, operated efficiently at high current densities of 10 A g−1, and delivered an excellent capacity retention of 96% and 79% after 100 and 1000 charge/discharge cycles, respectively.

Meanwhile, Lee et al.159 introduced a simple polymerization process to optimize the electronic structures, redox kinetics, and interfaces of the PTCDA cathode and electrolyte. The resulting PTCDA cathode could achieve impressive cycling stability with negligible capacity degradation after 1000 cycles at 7.35C. When the current density increased to 147C, the energy density could still maintain a value of 113 W h kg−1, meaning a full discharge would be possible within 10 s. The full battery assembled using the PTCDA cathode and dipotassium terephthalate anode also showed a superior energy density and cycling stability compared to other the reported all-organic full PIBs. Ning et al.160 synthesized carbonyl-based organic polymers with different morphologies, such as one-dimensional (1D) polyimide (PI), 1D polyquinoneimide (PQI), and a 2D conjugated microporous polymer (PI-CMP). Amongst them, PQI showed the highest initial capacity due to the abundance of carbonyl groups. However, PQI faded rapidly due to the dense potassiated carbonyl groups. Although the PI-CMP showed a moderate specific capacity, it possessed the best cycling stability and rate performances because of its extended π-conjugated structure. These studies could provide practical pathways to develop novel high-performance organic cathode materials and pave the way to promote PIBs for large-scale applications.
Metal-containing organic compounds, including transition metal ions and alkali ions, are attractive materials for PIB cathodes. Copper tetracyanocyanodimethane (CuTCNQ) was first reported as an excellent cathode for SIBs,161 in which both Cu+ and TCNQ− exhibited electrochemical activity with a high reversible specific capacity of 255 mA h g−1. Then, Li et al.162 used this material as a cathode material for PIBs with electrochemical activity in a high voltage range of 2–4.1 V. At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the initial specific capacity could reach 244 mA h g−1, which decreased to 170 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. A good rate capability was proved with a specific capacity of 125 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1. Wang et al.163 introduced an azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid potassium salt (ADAPTS) with an azo group as the redox center for PIBs. The extended π-conjugated structure and stable surface reactions between ADAPTS and K ions could enable a reversible charge/discharge process at higher temperatures. When operated at 50 °C, the electrode delivered a capacity of 109 mA h g−1 at 1C after 400 cycles. The electrode also showed a high capacity of 113 mA h g−1 with 81% capacity retention at 2C after 80 cycles at 60 °C. Chen et al.164 reported a series of expandable oxocarbon salts M2(CO)n (M = Li, Na, K; n = 4, 5, 6)), prepared via a one-pot proton exchange reaction method. Although most of these M2(CO)n salts are soluble in most commonly used organic electrolytes, K2C5O5 and K2C6O6 showed high reversible specific capacities, which were also confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis. Polyanionic sodium anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (Na2AQ26DS) was employed as a cathode in PIB full cells by Fan et al.165 The authors used K-intercalated reduced-state graphite as an anode material. The full cell delivered an average capacity of 105 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and kept 64 mA h g−1 for 2500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Zhao et al.166 also prepared a para-disodium-2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (p-Na2C6H2O6) compound for both SIBs and PIBs, with a reversible capacity of 190.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1C for PIBs.
One of the challenges that organic cathodes for PIBs face is the short cycle life that usually results from the dissolution of the organic active material. Zhou et al.167 improved the cycle life of an insoluble anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonic acid sodium salt (AQDS) cathode to 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80% at 3C through an SEI regulation strategy in ether-based electrolytes. The authors confirmed that the excellent performances were attributed to the fast reaction kinetics, and dense and stable ether-electrolyte-derived SEI films, which were also protected by an inorganic-rich inner layer. This inorganic protective layer was not harmful to the K ion transfer toward the active material.


2.4.3 Future challenges and development. 
Organic compounds possess several features that make them good candidates for PIB cathodes. However, the low operation voltages of most organic cathodes lower the achievable energy densities. Small molecule compounds can easily decompose during the electrochemical reaction, leading to a significant decrease in specific capacity with increasing cycle number. Taking a lesson from SIBs, it is possible to avoid small molecule dissolution using techniques such as anchoring, polymerization, salt formation, and electrolyte solidification. Another challenge that hinders organic cathodes’ applicability is the inherent low conductivity, which might adversely affect their rate performance.168,169 Mixing polymeric materials with conductive carbon in future studies can effectively solve the active materials’ low conductivity. Metal-containing organic cathodes, particularly those with high potassium content, should be further investigated because of their alterable electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals interaction forces, making them a good match with commercial graphite anodes, thus promoting the practical applications of PIBs.

3. Anode materials
The violent reactivity of potassium metal means that it can hardly be used as an anode material for commercial PIBs. The investigation of anode materials for PIBs has been sparked and increased rapidly in the last few years. This section will shine some light on the recent progress of PIB anodes, as shown in Table 1. Examples of anode materials include graphite, non-graphite carbon, metals/alloys, metal oxides, metal sulfides/selenides, and various composite materials. According to the possible K storage mechanisms, the anode materials can be divided into three categories: intercalation materials, conversion materials, and alloying anode materials.

3.1 Intercalation anodes

3.1.1 Graphite carbon materials. 
Graphite is the most widely used anode material for rechargeable metal-ion (Li and K) batteries due to its unique set of properties such as excellent electronic conductivity, thermal conductivity, and stable chemical structure for reversible insertion/extraction of guest metal ions between carbon layers.170–177 It is known that lithium ions intercalate into the graphite gallery forming various intermediate compounds during the charging process, and finally transform into LiC6.178,179 Similarly, K also forms several intercalation compounds with graphite during the insertion/extraction process.180–183 Both the ex situ XRD and in situ XRD results for the phase transitions in the first K-insertion confirmed that KC36 is firstly formed ranging from 0.3 to 0.2 V, then transformed into KC24 between 0.2 and 0.1 V, and finally changed to KC8 at 0.01 V. During the K-extraction, KC8 is directly converted to the KC36 compound at about 0.3 V, and subsequently returns to graphite with low crystallinity when the voltage is above 0.5 V. Some studies suggested that the intercalation of K into graphite is taking the following path C → KC24 → KC16 → KC8.184 DFT calculations were also used to investigate the K-insertion/extraction mechanism in graphite. The simulation results confirm that the K+ ions can insert into the graphite layer more easily than Li due to the lower formation enthalpy of KC8 (−27.5 kJ mol−1) than LiC6 (−16.5 kJ mol−1).185 Also, the calculated diffusion coefficient of KC8 (2.0 × 10−10 m2 s−1) is also much larger than that of LiC6 (1.5 × 10−15 m2 s−1), suggesting a more kinetically favorable process.186 The theoretical specific capacity of graphite carbon materials for PIBs is 279 mA h g−1.
Jian et al.180 studied the electrochemical performances of potassium ion intercalation into graphite in non-aqueous electrolytes, showing a specific capacity of 475 mA h g−1 after the initial potassiation process. In comparison, the first depotassiation process has a specific capacity of 273 mA h g−1, which is very close to the theoretical specific capacity. The low initial Coulombic efficiency was only 57.4% because the SEI film formed on the graphite surface, similar to the lithiation/delithiation behavior in graphite materials for LIBs. The authors reported a poor rate performance with specific capacities of 263, 234, 172, and 80 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1C (1C = 279 mA g−1). Moreover, the specific capacity also decreases rapidly from 197 mA h g−1 to 100 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.5C. The structural damage of graphite materials in the whole potassiation/depotassiation might lead to lower crystallinity and further affect the cycling performance.
In order to improve the rate capability and the cyclic stability of graphite materials for PIBs, many strategies have been investigated, including controlling the morphology, increasing the interlayer distance, and introducing a disorder region. Song et al.187 reported a highly graphitized carbon hollow nanocage with an average diameter of 50 nm and a thickness of 5 nm. The interconnected hollow nanocage 3D architecture improved the electron transfer, reduced the ion diffusion distance and buffered the interlayer expansion. The authors reported an excellent rate capability of 175 mA h g−1 at an extremely high rate of 35C, which is about 79% of that at 0.1C. After 100 cycles at 0.2C, the nanocage electrode could maintain a reversible capacity of 195 mA h g−1, which is about 92% of the initial value. The potassium storage mechanism was suggested to be redox reactions (intercalation/deintercalation) and double-layer capacitance (surface adsorption/desorption), which presents new insights for the structural design of graphite carbon materials in PIBs. Tai et al.188 studied a flexible graphite anode via coating filter papers using a commercial 8B pencil. This flexible electrode rate performance in PIBs was reported to be better than that in LIBs from 0.1 A g−1 to 0.5 A g−1 (the retention rate of PIBs is 66%, while that of LIBs is 22%). After 350 cycles at 0.4 A g−1, the capacity retention was 75%. Choi et al.189 demonstrated porous graphitized carbon microspheres that exhibited a stable specific capacity of 292.0 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The high crystallinity and porous structure are critical to the desirable performances, which could alleviate the stress caused by the large volume changes during insertion/extraction. Zhang et al.190 prepared a nitrogen-doped and highly defective graphitic nanocarbon (GNC) anode. The GNC anode showed better electrochemical performance than other thin-walled graphitic carbon nanomaterials, including carbon nanocages and nanotubes. The reported capacity was 280 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and when the current density increased to 200 mA g−1, the capacity can still be maintained at 189 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. The chemical vapor deposition method was used to deposit graphitic nanodomains on nanoporous graphitic carbon, resulting in a unique short-range ordered and long-range disordered structure.191 When the disordered structure was tested as an anode, it could keep a capacity retention of 50% after 240 cycles. Activated carbon materials were also used to develop a graphitic carbon structure with large interplanar spacing via high-temperature annealing.192 The resulting special structure, anchoring nanosized carbon sheets on graphite particles, could facilitate rapid intercalation/deintercalation with a larger diffusion coefficient than pristine graphite. Expanded graphite can also promote high rate capability by easing the intercalation/deintercalation of K ions into the enlarged carbon. An et al.193 developed large-size expanded graphite that can be used commercially as an anode material for PIBs. The as-prepared expanded graphite electrodes provided a specific capacity of 263 mA h g−1 at a current density of 10 mA g−1, which remains almost unchanged after 500 cycles. At 200 mA g−1, the specific capacity is still about 174 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. The expanded graphite's specific capacity was comparable to the commercial graphite materials, but with improved rate and cycling performance. After performance optimization by these methods, the graphite anode materials’ capacity and rate capability have been enhanced. However, the initial Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability still limit their practical applications in PIBs, which should be addressed in future studies.
The new member of the graphitic carbon family, graphene, has attracted tremendous attention for PIBs, due to its unique combination of chemical and physical properties. To name a few, the theoretical specific surface area of graphene is 2630 m2 g−1, the theoretical Young's modulus is 1.0 TPa,194 the carrier mobility is up to 200000 cm2 (V s)−1 at room temperature,195 and the thermal conductivity is 5300 W m−1 K−1.196 Several strategies have been employed in the literature to optimize the properties of graphene-based materials for PIBs, including introducing more point defects, heteroatoms, edges, grain boundaries, and structural design. These optimization strategies could adjust the surface wettability, improve the overall electrode conductivity, shorten the ion transport pathways and enhance the graphene electrodes’ electrochemical performance.
Since fluorine is the most electronegative element, the induced hybridization of carbon atoms could be changed from sp2 to sp3 after doping with fluorine, possibly enhancing the electrochemical performance of graphene. Ju et al.197 synthesized a few-layer F-doped graphene foam anode via a high-temperature solid-state method using PVDF as the source of fluorine. The obtained reversible specific capacities are 326.1, 271.9, 250.7, and 212.6 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50, 100, 200, and 500 mA g−1, respectively. After 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1, the F-doped graphene anode can still deliver a capacity of 165.9 mA h g−1. The authors attributed the excellent rate capability and cycling stability to F-doping and graphene's synergistic effects, properties that lead to a high specific surface area, fast ion and electron transport, and abundant active sites for K ion storage. Zhao et al.198 reported a facile hydrofluoric acid solution immersion method to purify low-grade microcrystalline graphite ore. The purity of the modified graphite could be as high as 98.59 wt% with an F content of about 1.02%. This treatment enlarged the interlayer distance and further led to fast K-ion de/intercalation and weak volume change. The F-doped expanded graphite electrode exhibited an initial capacity of 320 mA h g−1. The electrode also showed enhanced rate performance and a stable cycling property with a capacity retention of 74.6% after 100 cycles. This study could pave the way for treated-graphite ore as an anode material for commercial PIBs. Chen et al.199 proposed a microwave-based shock exfoliation strategy to decompose flouro-graphite into few-layer fluorinated graphene. The electrode fabricated from the fluorinated graphene exhibited excellent rate capacity and high cyclic stability with a capacity of 220.3 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. Lu et al.200 designed a porous carbon nanopolyhedra anode material functionalized with both oxygen and fluorine. The dual-doped electrode exhibited a superior initial capacity of 481 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and excellent cycling performance with a capacity of 218 mA h g−1 maintained after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Even when the current density increased to 10 A g−1, the reversible capacity could still be maintained at 111 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles. The authors noted that the O/F dual-doped in the carbon nanopolyhedra could promote the adsorption of K ions without obvious structural distortion, facilitating the electrode reactions and enhancing the electrochemical properties. The potassium storage mechanism was suggested to be a combination of diffusion and capacitance processes.
Nitrogen doping is a widely studied strategy for graphene modification, which could be used to generate abundant extrinsic defects and enhance the electrode/electrolyte interaction. Pint et al.201 first reported few-layer N-doped graphene for PIBs. The K ion storage capacity was reported to be as high as about 350 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, which is very close to the graphite anode's theoretical capacity in LIBs. Further studies on the cycling performance at 100 mA g−1 also indicate a stable and high capacity, which initially started at 270 mA h g−1 and kept at about 210 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Ju et al.202 also prepared a similar N-doped graphene material via a bottom-up synthesis method with high nitrogen of 14.68 at%. The enhanced conductivity accounted for the high specific capacity, superior rate performance, and long-term cycling capability of the graphene electrode. Qiu et al.203 reported an N-doped soft carbon framework by the MgO template method. The electrode enabled rapid K+ ion diffusion and electron transfer. As a result, the interconnected hierarchically porous structure delivered a large capacity of 293 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and retained nearly 85.5% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1. Li et al.204 prepared honeycomb-like N-doped carbon (N–C) nanosheets by growing MOFs on LDH nanosheets followed by pyrolysis acid-etching steps. The as-prepared N–C material possessed a high specific surface area, enlarged interlayer distance, and uniform micro/meso/macro-pores. The anode fabricated from N–C nanosheets was able to deliver excellent cycling performance with a reversible discharge capacity of 143 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles, and good rate capability up to 10 A g−1. Yu et al.205 fabricated an interconnected N-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanostructure, which showed a superior reversible capacity of 292 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, excellent rate capability (94 mA h g−1 at 10.0 A g−1), and outstanding cycling stability (157 mA g−1 after 12000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1). Guo et al.206 also report a series of pyrrolic/pyridinic-N-doped necklace-like hollow carbon nanostructures as a freestanding anode for enhancing PIBs. Because of their high specific surface area, ultra-high pyrrolic/pyridinic-N doping content, and abundant hierarchical micro/meso/macro-pores, the electrodes exhibited various advantages, such as facile de/intercalation of K ions, accommodating the volumetric expansion, and improved cyclic stability. The obtained reversible capacity was 293.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. The authors reported superior cyclic and rate performance with the capacity reduced to only 204.8 mA h g−1 when the current density was increased to 2 A g−1, and to 161.3 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1600 cycles. Tang et al.207 prepared an N-doped carbon nanosheet anode material with ultrahigh nitrogen content (22.7 at%). The electrode performance was very similar to Guo's work. An et al.208 designed a graphene-like N-doped porous carbon array on a 3D Cu substrate as a self-standing and binder-free anode. The electrode exhibited eminent potassium storage performances, including reversible capacity, rate performance, and stability. The dual-doping of graphene with nitrogen and oxygen was recently demonstrated by Yu et al.209 The designed N/O co-doped graphene foam films delivered a higher reversible capacity of 319 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and possessed long cycling stability (281 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 98.1% after 5500 cycles at 1 A g−1). Tai et al.210 also reported a facile method to synthesize nitrogen/oxygen co-doped graphene-like carbon nanocages with impressive reversible capacity for both LIBs and PIBs.
Heteroatom doping of sulfur or phosphorus elements is another technique reported in the literature to enhance carbon anodes’ electrochemical properties. Due to their large anionic radii and additional potassium active sites, S or P atoms expand the interlayer distance and promote K ion insertion/extraction. Doping with S and/or P also increases the potassium storage per unit, improving the overall specific capacity. Mai et al.211 prepared sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide sponges as freestanding anodes using a freeze-drying and subsequent thermal treatment method in sulfur steam. The as-prepared S-doped graphene sponge electrodes delivered a high capacity of 361 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 50 cycles and preserved a high stable capacity of 229 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 over 500 cycles. The reaction mechanism was investigated using ex situ XPS, and it was found that S provides additional reversible reactions (such as K2S) that contributed to the capacity. Miltin et al.212 developed a sulfur-grafted hollow carbon sphere (SHCS) anode, which had several advantages including short diffusion distances (≈40 nm), high surface area and strong C–S chemical bonds. The SHCS electrode displayed a high reversible capacity of 581 mA h g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1, an excellent rate capability of 110 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1, and stable capacity retention of 93% from the 5th to the 1000th cycle at 5 A g−1. Xing et al.213 introduced an available P and O dual-doped graphene (PODG) material as a superior anode for PIBs. PODG was prepared by a thermal annealing method of GO with triphenylphosphine. The PODG electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (474 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and long cycle life, which could retain a capacity of 160 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 2 A g−1. The co-doping of P and O atoms enlarges the interlayer spacing and facilitates the insertion and extraction of K ions, and mitigates the volumetric changes. These two different heteroatom dual-doping strategies have also attracted much attention in the last two years. For example, Guo et al.214 reported a 3D carbon framework prepared by N and S dual-doping of graphene nanosheets (CFM-SNG, Fig. 10a) with enlarged interlayer spacing (0.448 nm) and additional edge defects (Fig. 10b and c). As a result, the reversible capacity could be enhanced to 348.2 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and the rate capability is also significantly improved (Fig. 10d and e). When cycled at 2 A g−1 for 2000 cycles, the capacity can still remain at 188.8 mA h g−1. Further DFT calculations indicated that the pyrrolic N and S sites are more effective in enlarging the graphene interlayer spacing and reducing the energy adsorption of K ions (Fig. 10f–k). Similar enhanced electrochemical performance was obtained from other S and N co-doped carbon nanostructures, including micro-boxes,215 low-surface area S and N-rich carbon materials,216 flower-like carbon architectures,217 and 3D nanofiber aerogels.218 N and P co-doped graphene has also been prepared and used as anodes for PIBs. Qiu et al.219 anchored N and P dual-doped vertical graphene nanosheets on carbon cloth (N,P-VG@CC), which was then used as a binder-free anode for flexible PIBs. Thanks to the enhanced active sites, large specific surface area, expanded interlayer spacing, and robust and conductive network structure, the as-prepared anode displayed a high capacity (344.3 mA h g−1 at 25 mA g−1), excellent rate capability (capacity retention of 46.5% at 2 A g−1), and a stable long cycle life (capacity retention of 82% after 1000 cycles at 25 mA g−1). Furthermore, N,P-VG@CC was also tested in a full cell, using a potassium PB cathode. The full cell's energy density was calculated to be 232.5 W h kg−1, along with prominent cycling stability.

The C, N, S, and K atoms are presented in brown, blue, yellow, and purple colors, respectively. The yellow and blue areas in images (i–k) represent increased electron density and decreased electron density, respectively. 
Another strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of graphene-based anodes is structural design concepts to engineer 3D porous structures. Simon et al.220 reported a 3D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel anode. Because of the high apparent diffusion coefficient of K ions in the open porous structure, the as-prepared rGO aerogel delivered a high capacity of 267 mA h g−1 at 93 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 78% over 100 cycles. Yang et al.221 developed a flowable sulfur template method to synthesize graphene-built porous carbons with controllable pore size and shape. The open framework ensured fast ion transport and large ion storage capacity, which further resulted in ultrahigh volumetric potassium storage with long cycling performance over 500 cycles. A special graphene-based composite microsphere armored with a crystal carbon shell was introduced by Lu et al.222 The graphene microsphere anode displayed an initial capacity of 297.89 mA h g−1 (CE ≈ 99%) and outstanding cyclic stability nearly without any capacity loss after 1250 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Lu et al.223 anchored carbon dots on the surface of rGO to obtain a freestanding and flexible 3D architecture (CD@rGO) paper anode. CD@rGO has several advantages, including abundant defects, oxygen-containing functional groups, and efficient nanochannels between the CD and the rGO flakes. Benefiting from these advantages, the CD@rGO anode showed an obviously improved electrochemical performance, e.g. a high reversible capacity (310 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1), excellent rate performance (185 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1), and long cycle life (244 mA h g−1 after 840 cycles at 200 mA g−1). Despite the apparent scientific effort in the literature, graphene-based anodes still face several challenges in PIBs, including low Coulombic efficiency, a potential plateau, and voltage hysteresis. More work is expected to be devoted to addressing these issues in the near future.


3.1.2 Non-graphite carbon materials. 
Due to the advantages in ion diffusion and electron transport from the disordered structure or partially disordered structure with randomly located graphitized microdomains, non-graphite carbon materials have also been well investigated as anode materials for PIBs. Non-graphitic carbon materials usually include various amorphous carbons, such as hard carbon and soft carbon, and heteroatom-doped non-graphite carbon. This section will focus on the preparation, characterization, and performance optimization of non-graphitic-based anodes for K storage.
The previously reported hard carbon materials include biomass-derived carbon materials, metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon materials, and other porous hard carbon materials. Biomass-derived carbons are usually produced by thermal carbonization of natural hydrocarbons, such as sugars, pectins, cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignins, and proteins. Amorphous ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) was prepared by our group using SBA-15 as a template and sucrose as a carbon source.224 When compared with graphitic materials, the amorphous OMC material possesses larger interlayer spacing in a short- range and fewer carbon atoms in one carbon-layer cluster. Therefore, OMC could host more K ions and better tolerate the volume expansion during the de/intercalation processes. DTF calculations indicated that the OMC layer spacing changes by only 7% during the potassiation/depotassiation process. The electrode fabricated from OMC has an excellent initial capacity, cyclic stability and rate capability. At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the K storage capacity was maintained at a value of 257.4 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles. When the current density increased to 1.0 A g−1, a highly reversible storage capacity of 146.5 mA h g−1 could still be delivered over 1000 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100%. Komaba et al.225 reported a high-capacity hard carbon for both SIBs and PIBs, prepared by thermal treatment of macro-porous phenolic resin. Although the carbon interlayer distance decreased with increasing heat-treatment temperature from 1100 to 1500 °C, the pores’ void size increased, delivering an increased reversible capacity.
Most plants, including trees, crops, and vegetables, are also sustainable carbon sources for electrochemical energy storage. Liu et al.226 prepared a hierarchical porous hard carbon using low-cost and abundant soybeans as the raw material. Benefiting from the medium surface area, low degree of graphitization, and large interlayer spacing, the fabricated hard carbon electrode exhibited a high discharge capacity of 225 mA h g−1 at 40 mA g−1 and impressive cycling stability of 900 cycles. The authors suggested an adsorption-dominated mechanism to be responsible for the soybean-derived hard carbon anode's superior performance. Interestingly, a thin Al2O3 film (about 2 nm) was further coated on the hard carbon materials’ surface as an artificial SEI film, achieving a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. Jiang et al.227 constructed a N/O dual-doped hard carbon from sorghum stalked and used it as the active material for PIB anodes. The fabricated anode presented impressive electrochemical performances, including a high reversible capacity (304.6 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1) and superior long cycling stability (189.5 mA h g−1 after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1). Other plants that have been used as sources of carbon for PIB anodes include loofah,228 corn husk,229 potato,230 radish,231Ganoderma lucidum spores,232 sycamore fruit,233 lotus root,234 cotton,235 cocoon silk,236 rice husk,237 waste orange peel,238 and mango seed shuck.239 Most of these biomass-derived carbon materials showed promising electrochemical performance, suggesting them as low-cost and sustainable materials for PIB anodes.
One other advantage of using biomass as a carbon source is directly producing nanostructures with attractive pore properties. Yan et al.240 reported an onion-like carbon anode material from the facile combustion soot as a candle burnt. When used as an anode, the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity (245 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1). The electrode also showed good rate performance (78 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1) and cycling stability (111 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 1000 cycles). After further fabricating into a K+ ion hybrid capacitor using onion-like carbon as a battery-type anode and activated carbon as a capacitor-type cathode, the device could exhibit a high energy density of 142 W h kg−1 with long cycling stability of 83% capacity retention after 6000 cycles.
Nanjundan et al.241 reported an amorphous hard carbon material for high-performance PIBs, prepared via a simple pyrolysis method from commercial cellulose. The high capacity (−294 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1), good rate capability, and long cycling performance (−60 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1) were attributed to the low volume expansion and the enlarged interlayer spacing alongside the electronegative oxygen functional groups on the carbon material. With an intrinsic fibrous structure and nitrogen functional groups, chitin was also used to produce hard carbon anodes for PIBs. Guo et al.242 prepared N-doped carbon nanofibers by direct carbonization of biowaste chitin. The resulting materials possessed a specific capacity of 200 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 55.8 mA g−1. Zhang et al.243 prepared a hierarchically porous N-doped carbon microsphere (NCS) using seafood waste as the raw material. The porous microstructure of the NCS was found to promote electron/ion transport, which, coupled with the abundant defects, enhanced K ions’ adsorption capability. Based on the surface-driven K storage mechanism, the NCS anode displayed long cycling stability (180 mA h g−1 at 1.8C) without obvious capacity decay over 4000 cycles and an outstanding rate capability of 154 mA h g−1 at 72C. More recently, porous hard carbon nanobelts with numerous active sites were prepared by Zhang et al. via a self-template assisted pyrolysis strategy from mineralized shrimp shells (Fig. 11a and b).244 The hard carbon nanobelts possess several advantages for the PIB anode, such as pyrrolic/pyridinic-N and O dual-doping, large interlayer spacing, and a hierarchical micro/meso/macro-porous structure. As a result, the reversible capacity recorded for the electrode was 468 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. The electrode also enjoyed a long cycling life at the high current density of 1 A g−1 (277 mA h g−1 over 1600 cycles) as illustrated in Fig. 11c. As in most biomass-derived carbon, the K+ storage mechanism was proved by DFT calculations to be dominated by capacitive-adsorption processes. The capacitive-adsorption mechanism was enhanced by the rich active sites in the N and O co-doped hard carbon nanobelts. After fabricating into a coin-type potassium dual-ion battery with a commercial expanded graphite cathode, the cell exhibited a stable charge/discharge capacity of 89/84 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 11d–f).

Porous MOFs have also been used as precursors to prepare carbon-based materials via a simple calcination process. However, the different MOF compositions and the various synthesis conditions lead to MOF-derived carbon materials with different morphologies and compositions, further affecting the electrochemical performances. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are probably the most investigated raw materials for MOF-derived carbon for energy storage applications.245 Hu et al.246 reported a hollow carbon nanobubble material with a diameter of 70 nm and an average thickness of 10 nm, prepared by pyrolyzing a Zn-containing MOF (ZIF-8). The porous structure shortened the diffusion pathway and increased the active surface for K+ ions, resulting in a good specific capacity of 100 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 2 A g−1. Cobalt-containing ZIF materials (ZIF-67) were also used to produce N-doped carbon anodes for PIBs by Xu et al.247 Unlike the amorphous ZIF-8 derived carbon nanobubbles, ZIF-67 tends to convert to crystalline graphitic carbon nanotubes because of the catalysis effects of Co. Although the initial specific capacity was similar to that of ZIF-8-derived carbon (102 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1), the ZIF-67 derived carbon nanotube anode has greater cyclic stability (100 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles). Yang et al.248 also fabricated a high pyridinic N-doped porous carbon anode derived from ZIF-67, which showed excellent electrochemical K storage performances. The electrode could deliver a specific capacity of 587.6 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, long cycling performance (231.6 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 500 mA g−1), and stable rate capability (186.2 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1). Sun et al.249 combined the advantages of both ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 derived carbon by designing a novel composite architecture. The new composite, defined as ZIF-8@ZIF-67, has N-doped porous carbon confined within CoP nanoparticles (NC@CoP/NC) and was produced by complex nucleation, carbonization and phosphorization processes successively. The NC@CoP/NC anode exhibited an improved capacity of 200 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and capacity retention of 93% after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Other MOFs, e.g. NH2-MIL-101(Al),250 and Bi-MOF,251 were also used to produce various hard carbons for PIB anodes. Liu et al.251 developed an ultrathin carbon film@carbon nanorod@Bi nanoparticle (UCF@CN@BiN) composite by directly annealing the Bi-MOF at 700 °C in Ar. The carbon nanorods could provide high-speed ion transport channels and accommodate the volumetric change of Bi nanoparticles during the Bi  KBi2  K3Bi2  K3Bi potassiation/depotassiation processes. The reversible capacity of UCF@CN@BiN was recorded to be 425 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a discharge capacity of 327 mA h g−1 over 600 cycles. Due to the abundant variety of MOF materials, future studies should focus on designing novel hard carbon structures to improve the specific capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency.
In order to understand the relationship between the structural characteristics of porous carbon (e.g. pore structure and interlayer distance) and electrochemical performances, Lin et al.252 designed a series of porous carbon materials with various pore structures via a solvothermal method, using 1-dodecanol as the carbon source. The authors found that the intercalation capacity and the adsorption capacity of K+ ions are positively correlated with the IG/ID ratio and mesopore volume, respectively. The interlayer distance, surface area, and pore size play comparatively far less important roles in the K ion storage. Moreover, the mesopores can also promote K ion migration, serve as active sites for the adsorption of K ions, and accommodate the volume expansion during the potassiation/depotassiation process. The electrode fabricated using the materials with the largest mesopore volume and appropriate surface area could display a high capacity (633 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1) and long cycling stability (263.9 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles). These results might provide a new avenue to design novel carbonaceous materials as high-performance anodes for practical PIBs.
Although less studied than other types of carbon materials, soft carbon has unique advantages for PIB application, such as highly tunable crystallinity and lattice interlayer spacing, exhibiting structural integrity for high energy density and stability in the battery field. Cao et al.253 reported a pitch-derived soft carbon sample by carbonizing pitch powder at 1200 °C in Ar, producing carbon in the form of big aggregates of micro-sized particles. The TEM, XRD, and Raman results indicated that the synthesis protocol successfully increased the carbon crystallinity and prevented lattice large-range ordering. The produced carbon has turbostratic lattices with large interlayer spacing, which is favourable for K+ storage. Unlike other soft carbons where the storage mechanism is dominated by surface adsorption, the induced short-order crystallinity increased the intercalation reactions’ contribution. The intercalation of K+ ions was proved to occur at a low voltage below 1 V, which could ensure a high battery voltage and high energy density in the full battery compared to other non-graphitic carbons. Also, in situ XRD indicated that the formation of intercalation compounds requiring long range-ordered carbon (e.g. KC24) is suppressed, and therefore soft carbon can provide more resistance to structural damage than graphite. The anode fabricated from pitch-derived soft carbon could provide a reversible specific capacity of 296 mA h g−1 at 28 mA g−1, which is higher than that of graphite (273.6 mA h g−1) and hard carbon (148.2 mA h g−1). After 50 cycles, 93.2% of the initial capacity could still be provided by the soft carbon anode, indicating better stability than graphite (only kept 82.6% after 50 cycles). A long-range cycling test over 1000 cycles also showed that soft carbon outperforms both graphite and hard carbon. The rate capability performance was also proved to be better for soft carbon, with the electrode delivering 115.2 mA h g−1 when the current density increases to 1.4 A g−1. Qiu et al.254 prepared a high-performance soft carbon from low-cost coal via a ball milling, acid washing, oxidation, and carbonization process. The as-prepared coal-based carbon anode could deliver a reversible capacity of 260 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and a stable long cycling performance with a capacity of 118 mA h g−1 after 1200 cycles at 1 A g−1. Ji and coworkers255 reported the electrochemical performance of a hard–soft carbon microsphere composite with 20 wt% of soft carbon distributed in the hard carbon. The microspheres were produced using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as a binder. The experimental results indicated that the hard–soft carbon anode could provide better performances at high current than hard carbon. The hard–soft composite carbon provided a capacity of 190 mA h g−1 at 560 mA g−1, which is higher than that of hard carbon (135 mA h g−1). After 200 cycles at 280 mA g−1, the composite carbon anode could maintain a specific capacity close to 200 mA h g−1 with a retention rate of 93%, which is more stable than the pure hard carbon and soft carbon materials.
Another type of soft carbon tested recently for PIB anodes is carbon nanotubes (CNTs).256–259 The volume change of the K ion intercalation in CNTs is about 61%, suggesting that electrodes fabricated from CNTs are subjected to severe mechanical damage and thereby fast capacity fading. To address these challenges, Han et al.260 designed a hierarchical structure based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes by regulating the synthetic parameters of the CVD process. The nanotubes’ inner layer consists of dense graphitic carbon, while the outer layer is composed of disordered amorphous carbon, which is beneficial for hosting K+ ions. The nanotubes were further interconnected into a hyper porous sponge with a high macropore volume, facilitating both the potassiation/depotassiation reaction kinetics and surface capacitive behavior. The hierarchical multi-walled CNTs exhibited a high reversible specific capacity (232 mA h g−1), excellent rate capability, and long cycling stability of at least 500 cycles. Cao and coworkers261 further reported a porous-carbon aerogel constructed from 1D porous CNTs with a pore size distribution of around 0.8 nm. The long cycling stability and high rate capability with enhanced capacity retention were attributed to the high surface capacitive mechanism. The sub-nanopores would also decrease the K ion diffusion and transport energy barrier with a limited lattice change, providing a novel strategy for developing highly efficient carbon-based anodes for energy storage systems.
Heteroatom doping is also a common strategy to modify the K-storage capacity and cycling stability of non-graphite carbon materials. Chen et al.262 prepared N/O co-doped mesoporous amorphous carbon octahedra via a carbonization–etching process, using a metal–organic framework (Cu-BTC) raw material. The resulting materials possessed a hierarchical mesoporous structure, large specific surface area (1411 m2 g−1), and enlarged interlayer spacing (≈0.387 nm). When the octahedra were used as an anode, they could deliver a superior reversible capacity (364 mA h g−1 over 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1), and excellent cyclability (80 mA h g−1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1). Nitrogen and oxygen dual-doped amorphous carbon network materials were also synthesized by Zheng et al.,263 this time by an in situ vapor phase polymerization self-assembly process followed by pyrolysis strategy. The electrode delivered a capacity of 464.9 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, with excellent rate performance revealed by a capacity of 175 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5.0 A g−1. The N/O doped amorphous carbon also showed long cycling performance with a capacity decay of less than 0.008% per cycle. The authors determined that pseudocapacitive processes dominate the K-ion storage mechanism. Guo et al.264 were able to control the content and type of doped N in a honeycomb-like carbon structure co-doped with phosphorus. The sufficient pore defects and edges, originating from the porous structure and P-doping, could promote the formation of high-level pyridinic N in carbon, thereby endorsing the interfacial adsorption reaction of K+ ions. An outstanding reversible capacity (419.3 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1) and excellent rate capability (270.4 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) could be achieved by the pyridinic N and P doped carbon electrode. Lei et al.265 reported a highly nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber electrode material by carbonizing N-containing polypyrrole nanofibers at high temperature. After carbonization at 650 °C, the resulting sample (NCNF-650) has a nitrogen content of 13.8%. Increasing the treatment temperature above 650 °C produced materials with lower pyridinic N and pyrrolic N content while increasing the quaternary N. The authors also concluded from DFT calculations that pyridinic N and pyrrolic N would promote the generation of defect sites and contribute to a higher K ion storage capacity than the quaternary N sites. Therefore, the N-doped carbon nanofibers prepared at 650 °C showed the highest reversible specific capacity of 248 mA h g−1 at 25 mA g−1 and rate performance (101 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) when compared with nanofibers prepared at higher temperatures. After 4000 discharge/charge cycles at 2 A g−1, the NCNF-650 anode could keep a capacity of 146 mA h g−1 with a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100%. Alshareef et al.266 reported a molecular scale site-selective doping strategy to produce a defect rich and edge N doped carbon anode via a copolymerization pyrolysis procedure. The N atom doping could reach more than 10 at% in carbon with an edge-N ratio of 87.6%. The edge and defect-rich N-doped carbon anode delivered an excellent reversible potassium storage capacity (423 mA h g−1), long stable cycle life (93.8% retention after three months) and superior rate capability. Kaskel et al.267 also proposed edge enriched N-doped porous carbon nanosheets based on a pyridine-coordinated polymer pyrolysis-etching strategy. The optimized amorphous carbon with a high surface area has a nitrogen content on the edge of 9.34 at%. The electrode showed an ultra-long cyclic life with a capacity retention of 94.5% after 6000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. All these studies could offer a potential approach to adjusting the N active atom content in heteroatom-doped carbon materials for PIB energy storage systems.
In addition to doping carbon with N and O, S-doped and P-doped non-graphitic carbon materials have also been investigated as an anode for PIBs. Deng et al.268 prepared a high sulfur-doped hard carbon with sulfur content as high as 25.8 wt% by heating glucose in a K2SO4–LiCl-KCl molten salt. The S-doped hard carbon anode exhibited a specific capacity of 361.4 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and retained 88% of the capacity after the 100th cycle at 50 mA g−1. Nan et al.269 reported S-doped carbon by heating dry bamboo and sulfur powder under Ar. Both S and residual O atoms on the bamboo charcoal surface provided active sites that facilitated the interaction between K+ and the anode. To improve the low-voltage plateau capacity, P-doped hard carbon was employed as the anode material for PIBs.270 The P-doped carbon was prepared by stirring lignin-derived hard carbon with H3PO4 followed by sintering at 1300 °C. The low-voltage capacity below 0.25 V improved from 153 to 192 mA h g−1 after doping. The specific capacity also increased from 245 to 302 mA h g−1 after doping. Our group recently reported a carbonization–etching strategy for making a class of S and O co-doped porous hard carbon microsphere (PCM) anodes.271 The amorphous PCMs possessed a porous architecture with a large BET surface area of 983.2 m2 g−1, an enlarged interlayer distance of 0.393 nm, and abundant structural defects. These features contributed to excellent K storage, including a high capacity of 226.6 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 over 100 cycles and a highly stable extended cycling capacity of 108.4 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The reversible capacities at 50, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1 were 230, 213, 176, and 158 mA h g−1, respectively, indicating excellent rate capability. DFT calculations demonstrated that the S/O co-doping reduced the adsorption energy of K+ on the hard carbon, which eased the electrochemical reactions and consequently the capacity. The co-doping also reduced the structural deformation during the potassiation/depotassiation process, and thus improved the stability. In another report, co-doping hard carbon with S and N was found to increase K ion diffusion, leading to an enhancement of the rate capability.216 The recorded reversible capacity of the S/N doped carbon anode was 437 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, and the capacity retention rate was 75% after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Furthermore, a unique flower-like S/N/O tri-doped hard carbon structure has also been recently tested for PIBs. A facile sublime sulfur-vapor vulcanization process was used to prepare the tri-doped carbon.217 The 3D structure could offer affluent surface areas to adsorb the K+ ions and also promote electron transport, while the highly reactive –N–Cx–S– species enhanced the pseudo-capacitive behavior for K ion storage. As a result, the reversible specific capacity was 423 mA h g−1 at a low current density of 0.05 A g−1. The tri-doped carbon electrode also showed good rate capability with 251 mA h g−1 achieved at 1 A g−1, and long cycling stability (362 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1). These results also showed that the heteroatom doping of carbon could be used as a strategy to enhance the performance of carbon-based electrodes in PIBs.
Most reported non-graphite carbon materials had shown good reversible capacities and rate performance because of their special porous structure, large specific surface, and defects. Since the precursors are composed of C elements and various heteroatoms, e.g. N, S, P, and O, it was possible to produce heteroatom doped carbon directly from the raw materials. Doping non-graphitic carbon materials provided active sites on the surface, facilitating the interaction between K+ and the anode. However, new strategies to address the low initial Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability issues are still needed for practical application in commercial PIBs. Meanwhile, the relationship between the compositions/structures/phases and electrochemical performances of non-graphite carbon materials should be further studied deeply, offering novel ideas to enhance their properties and make PIB energy storage technology practical.


3.1.3 Other intercalation-type anode materials. 
Other non-carbon layered metal compounds such as transition metal oxides,272,273 sulfides,274–277 selenides,278–285 and carbonitride286–288 have shown attractive features as alkali metal ion anodes. The layered intercalation compound K2Ti4O9 was first reported as an anode material for PIBs by Munichandraiah et al.289 The recorded actual specific capacity of K2Ti4O9 was relatively low (80 mA h g−1 at 80 mA g−1). K2Ti8O17 nanorods were subsequently reported as an anode material for PIBs, synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method.290 The lattice spacing of the (1 1 0) crystal layer is about 0.367 nm, which is slightly larger than that of graphite. The reversible specific capacity was recorded to be 181.5 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1. After 50 discharge/charge cycles at a current density of 20 mA g−1, the capacity retention rate was about 61%, while the capacity at 500 mA g−1 is only 44.2 mA h g−1. Recently, Wang et al.291 reported a carbon-coated K2Ti2O5 microsphere (S-KTO@C) with porous microstructure via a simple spray drying method. S-KTO@C showed an excellent reversible discharge capacity of 155.1 mA h g−1 at 16 mA g−1, good rate capability, and cycling stability with a capacity retention of 77.1% at 160 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles. The authors attributed the enhanced K+ intercalation and pseudocapacitive behavior to the carbon coating. Chen et al.292 designed carbon-coated VPO4-based materials with different morphologies via a thermal reduction process after intercalating isobutanol into layered VOPO4·2H2O. One of the produced morphologies, the flower-like VPO4, could deliver an outstanding capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 with stable long cycling stability (263 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1) after 500 cycles. Chen et al.293 reported carbon-coated V2O3 hollow spheres prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction. The hollow structure microspheres and the outer carbon coating could bear the volumetric changes and improve the electronic conductivity. The electrode displayed a good reversible capacity of 330 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 500 cycles with the combination of intercalation and a pseudocapacitive mechanism. Xu et al.294 introduced a titanium oxynitride, TiOxNy, nanoparticle/carbon composite from the Ti3C2Tx MXene as an anode material for PIBs. The composite electrode exhibited a stable capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 1250 cycles and impressive rate performance (72 mA h g−1 at 1.6 A g−1).
Polyanionic compounds have also been investigated as anode host materials for potassium ion storage. Xu et al.295 prepared KTi2(PO4)3 nanocubes by a hydrothermal method and a subsequent heat treatment step. After coating with a carbon layer using sugar as the source, the specific capacity was increased from 30 mA h g−1 to around 80 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 64 mA g−1. Sun et al.296 developed carbon-coated KTiOPO4 with an open framework for PIBs. The electrode fabricated using C@KTiOPO4 could achieve a reversible capacity of 102 mA h g−1 at 5 mA g−1 and a long lifespan with a capacity retention of −77% over 200 cycles. In situ XRD, XPS, and DFT calculation results reveal a biphasic and solid solution reaction mechanism and a smaller lattice volume change (9.5%), which explains the enhanced electrochemical performance.
Metal sulfides, such as MoS2, SnS2, WS2, TiS2, ZnS, CoS, etc., have attracted much attention for applications in PIBs due to their high theoretical capacities. Ren et al.297 indicated that the K ions could intercalate into the MoS2 lattice and form hexagonal K0.4MoS2. Despite the large radius of K+, the intercalation with MoS2 is not very damaging to the chalcogenide crystals. The electrode fabricated using MoS2 exhibited good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 97.5% after 200 cycles at 20 mA g−1. When the value x in the compound KxMoS2 is higher than 0.4, the intercalated compounds are not stable, limiting the reversible capacity of practical PIBs. Li et al.298 designed a tubular MoS2–N/O co-doped carbon nanocomposite with an enlarged interlayer spacing of 0.92 nm. In addition, to improve the K+ diffusion, the tubular structure mitigated the mechanical strain during the intercalation of K+ ions. The N/O co-doped carbon played triple roles; first, it improved the electronic conductivity. Second, it buffered volume expansion. Third, it inhibited the dissolution of the active components and other side reactions. Therefore, the MoS2–carbon nanocomposite was able to deliver a reversible capacity of 220 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 250 mA g−1, and the capacity can remain at 176 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a higher current density of 1 A g−1. Liu et al.299 prepared a nanocomposite structure by anchoring nano-rose-like MoS2 on rGO nanosheets. The strong chemical bonds (e.g. Mo–C and Mo–O–C) between MoS2 and rGO provided structural stability during the potassiation/depotassiation processes. The composite anode delivered an excellent initial capacity of 438.5 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a remarkable rate capability of 196.8 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability for 1000 cycles without obvious fading at 500 mA g−1. Further investigation suggested that the exceptional electrochemical performance is due to the contribution of both intercalation and conversion (via a four-electron-transfer process) mechanisms. Liu et al.300 proposed an assembly of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets on a hollow tubular carbon skeleton's inner surface. The interlayer distance is tuned by intercalating organic molecules of various sizes. The hollow tubular structure and the expanded interlayer could facilitate the diffusion and reactions of the K+ ions, thereby delivering a high specific capacity of 148.5 mA h g−1 after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1. Huang et al.301 designed a compact 1T-MoS2/graphene nanocomposite bulk by tightening the hydrogel using capillary tension forces. The K+ ions could be electrochemically stored in the compact aerogel via mixed intercalation and conversion mechanisms, with fast K+ diffusion. The aerogel anode's reversible specific capacities could reach 511 and 327 mA g−1 at 0.1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. Lei et al.302 proposed an unexpected intercalation-dominated process for potassium storage in the interlayer gap of layered WS2. The electrode exhibited a reversible capacity of 103 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1 with a decay rate of 0.07% per cycle. When the current density increased to 500 mA g−1, the electrode could still be cycled at least for 400 cycles. Our group recently developed an anode of ultrafine zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanorods nested in a tertiary hierarchical structure through a facile solvothermal-pyrolysis process.303 The designed nanoarchitecture successfully provided short diffusion paths for both K+ ions and electrons, ensured the formation of a stable SEI, and buffered the volume expansion during cycling. The ZnS-based anode delivered specific capacities of 330 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 208 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 for 100 and 300 cycles, respectively. Shu et al.304 designed a defect-rich TiS2 anode material by inducing functional cation defects on the surface via a thermal annealing method. The authors proposed the generated titanium vacancies (VTi) to weaken the microscopic stress and strain during the de/intercalation process and provide active sites to reduce the adsorption energy of K. The defective TiS2 anode could keep 63.56% of the initial reversible capacity after 450 cycles. Other mono-sulfides and quasi 2D layered sulfides, such as ReS2,305 CoS,306 Co9S8,307 FeS2,308 and K0.36(H2O)yWS2,309 were also synthesized and usually mixed with carbon materials to fabricate the active materials of PIB anodes, with promising electrochemical performance.
In addition to sulfides, metal selenides are another family of chalcogenides that have been tested as active anode materials for PIBs. Li et al.310 demonstrated a nanosized MoSe2@carbon composite prepared via a facile ion complexation induced method followed by a thermal selenization step. The MoSe2@carbon anode achieved high specific capacity (433 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), good cycling stability (267 mA g−1 with a capacity fading of 15.8% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1), and an excellent rate capability (169 mA g−1 at 5 A g−1). Zhang et al.311 implanted sheet-like MoSe2 in carbon nanofibers during the electrospinning process. The composite has high structural stability and fast de/intercalation of K+ ions, thereby displaying a high reversible capacity of 316 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Zhang et al.312 reported a flexible freestanding anode by embedding Co0.85Se@carbon nanoboxes in carbon nanofiber films via a MOF-engaged electrospinning method followed by carbonization and selenidization steps. When fabricated into an anode for PIBs, the Co0.85Se@carbon composite could deliver a capacity of 299 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 1 A g−1 and a capacity of 166 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 5 A g−1. We also designed a unique structure by embedding Co0.85Se quantum dots in a mesoporous carbon matrix,313 which also showed an outstanding K-storage performance with a high capacity of 402 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1. Du et al.314 synthesized a crystal-pillar-like CuSe material with a cubic phase assembled from nanosheets. The as-prepared electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 in PIBs without any obvious capacity decay after 340 cycles. In situ XRD and ex situ TEM results indicated that the ionic storage process contains both the K+ ion insertion reaction (K0.5CuSe phase) and conversion reaction (Cu and K2Se phases). Shu et al.315 employed commercial TiSe2 directly as an insertion-type anode for K ion storage and showed that the selenide could deliver good cyclability and excellent rate performance even without applying any nano design approaches. Interestingly, Shu et al., in their work, showed that K0.24TiSe2 forming in the first cycle is stable during further cycling, providing a rigid framework for a reversible insertion/extraction process. TiSe2 was used to fabricate a full cell with a PB cathode, and the cell showed excellent Coulombic efficiency and cyclability. Other selenides tested as anodes for PIBs include VSe2 nanosheets,316 a FeSe2/N-doped carbon composite,317 porous FeSe2@C nanofibers,318 NbSe2 sheets,319 and a graphene-wrapped coral-like NiSe2 composite.320
In order to improve the electrochemical performances of selenide based anodes, ternary chalcogenides were investigated recently. Wang et al.321 first reported a few-layer ternary Ta2NiSe5 flake with an interlayer spacing of 1.1 nm, expanded by a facile ion-intercalation-mediated exfoliation method with Mg2+ cations and NO3− anions. The Ta2NiSe5 electrode delivered superior K+ ion storage performances, such as a high specific capacity (315 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1), excellent rate capability (121 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), and stable long-cycling performance with a capacity retention of 81.4% after 1100 cycles. The DFT calculations and experimental results elucidated that the enlarged interlayers with low diffusion barriers and large adsorption energy could result in fast intercalation and high-efficiency adsorption of K+ ions, contributing to the high-performance in PIBs. Huang et al.322 incorporated dual anionic vacancies in MoSSe arrays anchored on a carbon nanofiber membrane. They found that the anionic vacancies improve the adsorption of K+ ions when compared with vacancy-free MoSSe. The reversible capacity could reach 370.6 mA h g−1 after 60 discharge/charge cycles at 100 mA g−1. Since the 3D porous structure of the vacancy-rich MoSSe arrays could remit the volume expansion during cycling, high capacity retention could be achieved with 220.5 mA h g−1 kept after 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Vacancy design for the optimization of K+ ion storage could also open a feasible route to develop potential anode materials for practical PIBs.
In recent studies, 2D layered MXenes, consisting of transition metal carbides and carbonitrides, have shown considerable electrochemical performances as anode materials in LIBs, SIBs, PIBs, and capacitors.323–328 Michael et al.329 prepared a fabricated electrode from Ti3CNTz with a specific capacity of 75 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 20 mA g−1. Alshareef et al.330 designed a general acid/alkali treatment strategy to introduce more porosity into MXene materials. The resulting K-V2C anode displays an improved capacity of 195 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1. When the current density increased to 3 A g−1, the capacity could maintain 70 mA h g−1 over 48 cycles. Xu et al.331 fabricated an electrode based on 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes combined with flexible hard carbon. The fabricated 3D architecture could effectively accommodate the volume expansion of hard carbon during the cycling process, delivering an enhanced capacity of 280.6 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1, rate capability (102.2 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1), and stable cycling performance. Yin et al.332 further designed a Ti3C2 MXene and N-rich porous carbon nanosheet hybrid for high-performance PIB anodes via an electrostatic attraction self-assembly method (Fig. 12a). The hybrid combined several advantages, including large specific surface area, abundant active sites, and a unique 3D porous interconnected structure. The electrode maintained a high reversible capacity of 358.4 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 12b), which is larger than both the Ti3C2 MXene and N-rich porous carbon nanosheets. The enlarged interlayer spacing can also facilitate the ionic/electronic transport and improved the tolerance toward volumetric changes during the fast charge/discharge process. Therefore, a durable rate capability (191.2 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1) and long cycling stability (151.2 mA h g−1 at 2.0 A g−1 after 2000 cycles) were obtained (Fig. 12c). Further DFT calculations and ex situ XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 12d–f, indicated that the electrochemical reaction mechanisms are a mix of enhanced interfacial K+ adsorption and optimized intercalation processes, including the reactions of 8C + xK+ + xe− ↔ KxC8 and Ti3C2Tx + yK+ + ye− ↔ KyTi3C2Tx. Wu et al.333 designed a black phosphorene@V2CTx MXene hybrid anode based on van der Waals interactions to accelerate the K+ transport and tolerate the cycling volume changes. The composite could achieve an outstanding reversible capacity of 593.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 261 mA h g−1 with a retention ratio of 86% after 3000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1. Based on the remarkable synergetic effect, several layered MXene-based composite electrode materials, such as layered Ti3C2Tx MXene/MoS2 composites,334 carbon-coated MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrid nanosheets,335 3D Fe3C@porous graphite carbon core–shell structures,336 N-doped graphene/ReSe2/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure frameworks,337 and mesoporous NbN/N-doped carbon hybrids,338 were also developed with enhanced electrochemical performances, suggesting a new way to design high-performance anode materials for K ion storage.

Layered organic materials that can run on an intercalation process basis in alkali metal ion batteries have several advantages over their inorganic counterparts, including low toxicity, low cost, abundant sources, and controllable chemical structure.339 For example, a layered organic dipotassium terephthalate (K2TP) crystal with a cyclic moiety and conjugated structure for alkali metal ion storage was employed as the anode material for PIBs. Chen et al.340 reported that K2TP had enhanced electrochemical performance in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) based electrolyte. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of abundant active carboxylate groups and a stable SEI, the reversible capacity achieved was 249 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, and the capacity could maintain 94.6% of the initial value after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1. After replacing the adjacent carbon close to the ester group with nitrogen, superior electrochemical potassium storage performances could also be achieved in carbonate electrolyte.341 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI)342 was also tested as a high-rate anode for PIBs, benefiting from the low charge-transfer resistance and fast K ion diffusion. The PTCDI electrode could deliver a high specific capacity of 208 mA h g−1 with only 20 mA h g−1 capacity loss after 320 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. IR and XRD results suggested a six-electron storage mechanism for the PTCDI anode during the K-ion insertion/extraction process. Sun et al.343 developed an anode material based on a few-layer boronic ester-based covalent organic framework (COF) material anchored on CNTs. This novel organic material exhibited outstanding reversible capacities of 288 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 0.1 A g−1 and 161 mA h g−1 after 4000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The authors attributed the enhanced performance to the improved π-K+ interaction between the potassium ions and conjugated π-electrons of benzene rings. Similar conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with π-conjugated skeletons were also employed as anodes for PIBs.344 Jiang et al.345 studied the relationships of the structure and the performances of CMPs with the delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) distribution. By controlling the low LUMO energy level and narrowing the bandgap, along with the porous structure of CMPs, the electron conductivity, the number of active sites, and the accommodation of volume change during K intercalation could be enhanced. As a result, a reversible capacity as high as 428 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 with excellent cycling stability (272 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 50 mA g−1) could be achieved. These examples could give promising green organic electrode candidates with large capacity and long cycling stability for PIBs. However, the poor electrical conductivity and the solubility of the organic materials in the electrolyte still limit their practical application in PIBs, as they do with other metal-ion batteries. Therefore, more effort is required to address these issues in future studies.

3.2 Conversion-type anodes
In conversion type anodes, the active material reacts with the alkali metal ions from the electrolyte to change the oxidation state of at least one of the metals in the anode. As a result, new compounds usually generated from the alkali-ions interstation. Because the total reduction of transition metal ions is usually considered up to the metallic state during electrochemical reactions, the theoretical capacities of conversion anode materials are always much higher than those of intercalation anodes. The following formula describes the general reversible reaction mechanism of conversion reactions in PIBs: MxAy + (yn)K+ + (yn) e−↔ xM + yKnA(8)where M is the transition metal (Fe, Co, Mo, etc.), A is the anion (O, S, etc.), and n is the oxidation state of A. Recently reported conversion anodes for PIBs included metal oxides and transition metal dichalcogenides.

3.2.1 Metal oxides. 
Several transition metal oxides have been considered promising PIB anode materials because of the high reversibility of the electrochemical conversion process. Jiao and co-workers346 synthesized CuO nanoplates with a thickness of around 20 nm as a high-performance anode. The theoretical reversible capacity of the anode, based on converting the formed Cu2O to Cu, is calculated to be 374 mA h g−1. Benefiting from the high surface area resulting from the ultrathin thickness, the CuO nanoplates afford a short K+ ion diffusion distance and large electrode–electrolyte contact interface. As a result, the electrode showed a high reversible capacity of 342.5 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1 (about 92% of the theoretical value). The CuO nanoplate-based anode also showed high cyclic stability; the capacity could remain over 206 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g−1. Kim et al.347 reported a Magnéli phase Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode through controlled electrochemical reduction of TiO2. The Magnéli phase anode exhibited a reversible capacity of ∼150 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. The XRD and TEM analysis proved that the K storage is through a conversion reaction mechanism. Different from a simple oxide, Liang et al.348 applied a β-FeOOH/conductive carbon composite as a new anode for PIBs. The electrode could still deliver a high reversible capacity of 177.7 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. The potassium storage mechanism was determined to start by converting β-FeOOH irreversibly into an amorphous structure. The amorphous phase remains stable in the subsequent cycles. Nithya et al.349 fabricated a MnCO3 nanorod@rGO composite via a simple one-step hydrothermal method without any further heat treatment. The electrode has a high surface area of 122.6 m2 g−1 because of a combination of the nano-sized MnCO3 nanorods with a diameter of 5–10 nm and the rGO flakes, facilitating the conversion reaction. The composite delivered a high capacity and superior long-term cycling stability (841 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 200 mA g−1), as an anode material for PIBs. The conversation reaction, MnCO3 + 2K+ + 2e− ↔ Mn + K2CO3, contributed mostly to the outstanding performances. Sultana et al.350 studied the potassium storage behavior of transition metal oxide anodes with the aim to mitigate the damaging volumetric changes and stress usually associated with conversion reactions. Then they prepared a Co3O4–F2O3/C nanocomposite via a molten salt method. The electrochemical characterization proved the new composite's ability to mitigate the structural damage problems of the conversion reactions. Compared with the Co3O4–F2O3 nanoparticles without carbon, the Co3O4–F2O3/C composite, with its higher specific surface area and conductivity, presented a reversible capacity of 220 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1. In situ XRD results further indicate that the main potassium storage mechanism is the conversion of Co3O4 and F2O3 into their metallic states, according to Fe2O3 + 6K+ + 6e− ↔ 2Fe + 3K2O and Co3O4 + 8K+ + 8e− ↔ 3Co + 4K2O. These studies could offer meaningful strategies for developing high performance anodes for PIBs using earth-abundant transition metals, which is useful for commercial application.


3.2.2 Metal dichalcogenides. 
Conversion-based transition metal dichalcogenides, particularly sulfides, have also been considered for PIB anodes.351–354 Metal sulfides have good electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. However, pure metal sulfides suffer from low cycle life due to transformation and conversion reactions. Researchers have tried to solve this problem by making these metal sulfides into composite systems with carbon, obtaining a great improvement in the electrochemical performances. One example is a carbon-coated Co3O4 and MoS2 composite electrode (Co3O4@C@MoS2) with a designed layered structure to accommodate the volume expansion.355 The composite anode delivered a specific capacity of 256 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 88.3% after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Xie et al.356 used rGO as a carrier to stabilize MoS2 in a rose shape. The electrode has ultra-high potassium storage-specific capacities of 679 mA h g−1 and 178 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1 and 500 mA g−1, respectively. After 100 cycles under a current density of 100 mA g−1, the specific capacity was still above 380 mA h g−1. Interestingly, the authors suggested that the K+ ion storage mechanism of MoS2@rGO undergoes both the intercalation reaction and conversion reactions through in situ Raman results, according to MoS2 + xK+ + xe− ↔ KxMoS2 (above 0.54 vs. K/K+) and KxMoS2 + (4−x) K+ + (4−x) e− ↔ Mo + K2S (below 0.54 vs. K/K+).
Growing nanosized SnS2 and Sb2S3 directly on rGO has also been investigated to improve the electrochemical performance of metal sulfide conversion anodes.357,358 Although the specific capacity has improved compared to the pure SnS2 and Sb2S3, the cycling stability still needs to be improved. The cyclic stability could be enhanced by S/N co-doping of rGO. The capacity retention rate of SnS2–rGO was about 70% after 30 cycles at 25 mA g−1, which increased to about 89% after 100 cycles at 50 mA g−1 after the co-doping. In another attempt to accommodate the structural damage caused by potassiation/depotassiation reactions, Guo et al.359 exfoliated bulk layered Sb2S3 into a 2D form with a thickness of 6.8 nm using a high-shear mixer in water and ethanol. Ethanol was also used as a source of carbon, and they finally obtained the Sb2S3/C anode material for PIBs. Compared to the bulk Sb2S3, the 2D Sb2S3 nanosheets can effectively accommodate the changes during the electrochemical reactions. As a result, the Sb2S3/C electrode displayed enhanced cyclic stability with a reversible specific capacity of 404 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The electrode also showed good rate performance with a capacity retention rate of about 76% when the current density increased from 50 to 500 mA g−1. Phases such as K3Sb and K2S3 could be detected during the charge/discharge process, suggesting that Sb2S3/C undergoes the intercalation reaction, in addition to the conversion reactions.
Since the nanosized metal sulfide particles are supported on graphene, the nanoparticles might also aggregate, reducing the surface available for the electrolyte/electrode interface and consequently the electrochemical performance. To address this issue, Wu et al.360 developed a “gel-blowing” method to confine FeS2 in an N-doped carbon matrix (Fig. 13a and b). The external carbon shell on the FeS2 nanoparticles can suppress their aggregation and enhance the transfer kinetics. The as-prepared FeS2@NC displayed a high specific capacity of 525.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a record long-term cyclability with 0.016% capacity loss per cycle over 5000 cycles (Fig. 13d). When the current density was increased to high rates of 5 and 10 A g−1, the anode also showed excellent rate performance with capacities of 236 and 155 mA h g−1, respectively (Fig. 13c). This study also systematically studied the reaction mechanisms during K storage, demonstrating a combination of intercalation and phase transformation. Similarly, Zhao et al.361 engineered a yolk–shell in which FeS2 nanoparticles on a graphene matrix were prevented from aggregating using a carbon coating film. Furthermore, Lu et al.362 synthesized hierarchical hybrid yolk–shell FeSe2@C microcapsules (Fig. 13e). Numerous electroactive FeSe2 nanoparticles were confined in the carbon shell, which avoided pulverization and alleviated volume expansion during repeat cycling. Besides, the external carbon shell also accelerated ionic migration and electron transmission (Fig. 13f). Yang et al.363 synthesized a FeP@C nanobox with a carbon shell (FeP@CNB) by phosphorizing a Fe2O3 nanobox yolk–shell structure as the precursor. The carbon shell improved the conductivity of the electrode, and the yolk–shell structure adapts to the volume expansion of FeP during the electrochemical process, thereby improving the cycling stability and rate performance. The FeP@CNB anode showed reversible capacities of 201, 156, 101, 65 and 37 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g−1, respectively. Our group designed an anode in which the FeP nanoparticles are incorporated in a 3D foam-like graphitic carbon scaffold (FeP@FGCS).364 FeP nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed and tightly fixed by the strong P–C bonds to the carbon scaffold. The designed FeP@FGCS structure provided a conductive pathway to accelerate the transport of K ions and electrons, and also alleviated the volume variation of FeP nanoparticles to preserve their integrity during charge/discharge. This study also showed that the selected ether-based electrolyte (1.0 M KFSI in DME) and binder promoted long cycling stability by forming a stable inorganic SEI layer on FeP@FGCS. Thus, the FeP@FGCS anode exhibited superior electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 382 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and a capacity of 183 mA h g−1 was retained for over 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1.

NiS, as a member of the transition metal sulfide family, is rarely reported in PIBs due to the disadvantages of low conductivity and large volume expansion. By coating the precursor with a carbon film, Zhao et al.365 prepared a core–shell structure (NiS@C) to buffer the volume expansion during the potassiation/depotassiation cycles. The NiS@C anode could retain 171 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 300 cycles. On the other hand, nickel selenide NiSe2 has a low diffusion barrier (0.05 eV) and high carrier mobility (1658 cm2 V s), making it a better anode material than NiS, even without mixing with conductive materials. Wang et al.366 used 2D T-NiSe2 as an anode without the coating of hybridizing with carbon and showed that the initial electrode capacity could reach 247 mA h g−1 with better cycling stability than most 2D material based anode materials for PIBs.
Recently, copper sulfides, such as CuS and Cu2S, have been tested as conversion anodes for alkali metal ion batteries with impressive performance.367–371 Of particular interest, Cu2S has several properties that might benefit PIBs, including non-toxicity, low-cost, and high electrical conductivity. Yu et al.372 designed a uniform N-doped carbon-coated Cu2S hollow nanocube via an anion exchange process followed by PDA coating and carbonization steps (Fig. 14a–d). As shown in Fig. 14e, the composite nanocages have sufficient inner cavity to relieve the volume expansion during cycling. The high specific surface area shortens the diffusion pathway of potassium ions/electrons. The study also reported the formation of a stable SEI with lower interface impedance by using a high-concentration ether-based electrolyte (Fig. 14g). The Cu2S@NC anode showed excellent electrochemical performance with impressive reversible capacity and cyclic stability (372 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 after 530 cycles, and 317 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 1200 cycles). The electrode also showed excellent rate performance (257 mA h g−1 at 6 A g−1) in a PIB half-cell (Fig. 14f). TEM and XRD analysis demonstrated a complex conversion reaction mechanism of the Cu2S@NC anode during the charge/discharge cycles.

Zn-Based conversion anodes, e.g. ZnS, are very promising anodes for PIBs due to their advantages, including safety, non-toxicity, abundance, and low cost.373–376 In our recently published results, we designed an open ZnSe/C nanocage composed of sub-10 nm nanoparticles with a multi-hierarchy stress-buffering effect as anode materials for PIBs.377 The synergistic effect of all the ultrafine nanoparticles, the open structure, and the inner voids effectively reduced the diffusion-induced stresses and greatly enhanced the structural integrity. Meanwhile, the coated carbon layer could also improve the electronic conductivity and suppress ZnSe nanoparticle agglomeration. Owing to these merits, the ZnSe/C nanocages delivered a high reversible capacity of 318 mA h g−1 at 50 mA h g−1 as well as excellent cyclability up to 1000 cycles with a capacity of 189 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Various Fe-based anodes have also been evaluated for PIBs, such as hollow FexO nanospheres anchored on a 3D N-doped few-layer graphene framework,378 amorphous FeVO4,379 a 3D N-doped porous graphene framework decorated with Fe3O4 nanoparticles,380 3D carbon framework-supported FeSe,381 multicore-shell Fe2N nanoparticles impregnated into N-doped carbon nanofiber bundles,382 and a hierarchical Fe9S10@MoS2@C composite.383 The potassium ion storage performances of all these Fe-based electrodes were studied in detail, and many of them showed enhanced electrochemical performance.
Quantum dots, with their high specific surface area and reactivity, have also been used as energy storage materials.384–387 Gao et al.388 reported, for the first time, a CoS and GO composite as an anode for PIBs. Four samples with different GO contents (0, 10, 15, and 20%) were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method by in situ vulcanizing the as-prepared Co(OH)2 nanosheets with GO. During the vulcanization process, the Co(OH)2 nanosheets transformed into CoS quantum dot nanoclusters in the surface of GO, exhibiting a larger surface area, high electrical conductivity, structural stability, and excellent electrochemical energy storage performance. At a current density of 500 mA g−1, the electrode displays a high specific capacity of 310.8 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Moreover, Li et al.389 reported a novel 3D structural self-supported NiCo2S4@N-C composite material by anchoring a tapered rod-shaped NiCo2S4 nanomaterial on N-doped hollow carbon nanofibers via a carbonization and hydrothermal method. The as-prepared electrode materials deliver a high capacity of 263.7 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1 and outstanding stability with a capacity of 134.3 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 3.2 A g−1.
Generally, the reaction mechanisms of these aforementioned transition metal oxides and dichalcogenides are mostly based on the intercalation, conversion, and alloying process along with large volume changes during the potassiation/depotassiation reactions. As a result, these active materials’ aggregation and pulverization severely limit their rate performances and cycling stability. Most previous studies have tried to overcome these problems by engineering various nanostructures or mixing them with conductive carbon forming heterostructure composites. In both cases, the performance optimization is mainly attributed to the nanostructure and carbon's combined advantages, such as large contact area, abundant reaction sites, short diffusion path, high electronic conductivity, and adequate resilience to alleviate the volume changes and agglomeration during cycling. However, both the low initial CE from the largely irreversible capacity loss and the high and sloping operating voltage plateau hamper their practical applications in PIBs. Thus, future studies should focus more on understanding the relationship between the structures and the performances, consequently designing more efficient conversion electrodes for energy storage.


3.2.3 Other conversion anodes. 
MOFs are also considered potential anode candidates because of the possible polyelectron transfer by oxidizing/reducing both the inorganic and organic linkers. Other advantages that MOFs could offer are chemical composition control, porosity with controlled pore size, and high specific surface area. Therefore, MOFs could accelerate the diffusion rate of K+ ions and improve the electrolyte/electrode interaction. For example, Deng and co-workers390 reported a composite based on a low-cost microporous iron-based organic framework (MOF-235) mixed with CNTs as an anode material for PIBs. The composite electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 132 mA h g−1 over 200 cycles at 200 mA g−1 with remarkable rate capability. The enhanced electron conductivity from the carbon nanotubes and numerous active sites from the organic terephthalate moiety accounted for the high performance. Wang et al.391 proposed a non-redox-metal potassium MOF (K-MOF) as the active material and investigated the organic linker's redox reaction (pyridine dicarboxylate). The authors observed a reversible three-step redox reaction from [C7H3KNO4]n to [C7H3K2NO4]n accounting for a moderate average capacity of 115 mA h g−1 in 300 cycles at 100 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 92%. Potassium perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate (K4PTC)392 was also reported as a new two-electron redox-active organic anode for PIBs. Since the strong multiple K–O bonds could prevent the dissolution of the organic materials in the electrolyte, the K4PTC anode maintained a capacity of 100 mA h g−1 for 500 cycles at 50 mA g−1. Wang et al.393 investigated an organic azobenzene-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid potassium salt with an azo group as the redox center to reversibly react with K+ ions. They also claimed that a surface reaction-controlled mechanism controls the electrochemical storage. The electrode could deliver a high reversible capacity of 109 mA h g−1 over 400 cycles at 155 mA g−1. However, the reversible capacity and cycling stability of MOFs are still far from practical application. Thus, more effective strategies should be developed to enhance the electrochemical performances for promising electrode materials in PIBs.

3.3 Alloying anodes
Similar to LIBs and SIBs, Group IVA and VA elements (e.g. Si, P, Ge, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi etc.) can alloy with potassium reversibly under an applied potential, allowing effective storage. These elements, and many of their metallic compounds (e.g., intermetallics, sulfides, and phosphides), have also attracted much attention due to the low operating voltage and high theoretical specific capacities, which aroused much interest in PIB applications.394–398 During potassium insertion, K-rich intermetallic compound(s) are formed, according to the following general reaction: xA + yK+ + ye− ↔ KyAx(9)where A is the alloying element, and KyAx is the final alloying reaction product. For instance, the final alloying product of Sb is K3Sb, which has a remarkable theoretical capacity of 660 mA h g−1, much higher than carbonaceous anode materials. However, like many other alloying-type anodes, Sb-based anodes suffer rapid capacity fading due to the large volume variations during charge/discharge. Moreover, new surfaces of active materials are always exposed after pulverization because of the huge volume changes. The SEI layers would reform each cycle, resulting in fast depreciation of the electrolyte and the anode materials. Recently, several practical strategies have been developed to overcome these problems, including designing special nanostructures, introducing a protective layer on the anode surface and employing suitable electrolytes. This section reviews the research progress related to alloy-based anodes and the scientific attempts to improve their electrochemical performance.

3.3.1 Tin anode. 
Tin (Sn) is an attractive alloy-based anode material for LIBs and SIBs due to the low cost and high theoretical capacities of 990 mA h g−1 (Li22Sn5 as the final phase) and 847 mA h g−1 (Na15Sn4 as the product), respectively.399 However, Sn anodes suffer significant volume change during cycling in both LIBs (420%) and SIBs (260%), which leads to severe structural pulverization and fast capacity fading. Similarly, the Sn anode presents a moderate theoretical capacity (226 mA h g−1), but the electrode also easily pulverizes upon potassiation/depotassiation reactions.400 Most reported research adopts nanostructure designs concepts to accommodate the sizeable volumetric change. One strategy is to buffer the volumetric change using nano-size Sn with a porous carbonaceous material. Sultana et al.401 prepared the Sn–C alloy by mechanical ball milling with a weight ratio of 7:3 in an Ar atmosphere. The alloy anode delivered a reversible specific capacity of about 150 mA h g−1. Huang and co-workers402 reported a 3D hierarchical Sn/porous carbon composite anode prepared via a high-temperature solid-state method using NaCl as the template. Sn nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 22–94 nm could homogeneously attach to the porous carbon matrix after carbonization at different temperatures. The reversible capacity could be optimized to be 276.4 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles at 650 °C. When the current density increased to 500 mA g−1, the capacity could still deliver 150 mA h g−1, suggesting high rate performance. In another study, Wang et al.403 encapsulated Sn particles in 3D porous rGO networks. The anode displayed a reversible capacity of 123.6 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1 and an excellent rate capability of 67.1 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1. Limiting the volume expansion by using Sn compounds instead of the pure metallic phase has also been investigated in the literature.404,405 Zhou and co-workers406 synthesized homogeneous SnO2 QDs with a size of 2–6 nm embedded in porous carbon via a hydrothermal method. Because of the well-restrained ultrasmall SnO2 QDs in a porous carbon matrix, the composite electrode could present an excellent reversible capacity of 300 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. Even after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 1 A g−1, a considerable reversible capacity of 108.3 mA h g−1 could still be maintained. Xia et al.407 fabricated few layer SnS2 nanosheets on an rGO matrix, which presented a high specific capacity of 448 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. The high capacity was attributed to both the conversion reaction (SnS2 to Sn) and alloying reactions (Sn to K4Sn23 and KSn) during the potassiation process. Along with fast K storage kinetics and excellent structure integrity, a stable long cycling performance with a capacity retention of 73% after 300 cycles was recorded. In order to further improve the attenuation of the SnS2-based anode capacity, Ci et al.408 coated SnS2 on porous rGO networks with an amorphous carbon film (SnS2@C@rGO). Since the two carbon-based layers restrained the SnS2 volume expansion, the volume expansion during the alloying process was significantly reduced, and the SnS2@C@rGO anode was able to deliver a high reversible capacity of 298.1 mA h g−1 and 170.9 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at a current density of 0.2 and 0.5 A g−1, respectively. Despite all these efforts to enhance the Sn-based anode performance, the reversible capacity is still much lower than the theoretical capacity. More studies should focus on improving the capacity and CE of Sn-based electrodes in the future.


3.3.2 Antimony anode. 
Antimony (Sb) is also well known for its good conductivity and alloying ability with alkali metal elements. Sb could alloy with Li and Na to form Li3Sb and Na3Sb as the final product of the charging process with high capacities. Wang et al.409 investigated the intermediate phase during the potassiation process of the Sb anode by DFT calculations. In combination with CV measurements, they revealed a consequence of phase transformation from Sb to KSb2, KSb, K5Sb4, and finally to K3Sb with increasing potential, showing a high theoretical capacity of 660 mA h g−1. However, a considerable volume expansion of 407% was reported, resulting in rapid capacity fading. The authors further designed a Sb@CSN composite by encapsulating Sb nanoparticles in a carbon sphere network to tackle this issue. Using concentrated 4 M KTFSI/EC + DEC as the electrolyte, the Sb@CSN anode could deliver a remarkable capacity of 551 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. For example, Lin et al.410 embedded Sb nanoparticles with an average size of 14.0 nm on the surface of 18.6 nm thick ultrathin carbon nanosheets by a one-step solvothermal “metathesis” chemical reaction. The composite anode displayed a reversible capacity of 247 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 200 mA g−1, equivalent to 90% of the initial capacity. Similar work using a carbon matrix to buffer Sb-based anodes’ volumetric changes has been reported in the literature with improved electrochemical properties,411 such as a 3D macroporous Sb@carbon composite412 and segment-like Sb nanorod encapsulated in an N-doped hollow carbon tube.413 Moreover, Sb nanoparticles are also incorporated with conductive and flexible MXene paper to form a freestanding flexible MXene@Sb anode.414 MXene@Sb delivered a high reversible capacity of 516.8 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and a stable long-term cycling capability with a capacity fading rate of only 0.042% per cycle. Ou et al.415 impregnated Sb nanoparticles into few-layer MoS2 nanosheets and then encapsulated the MoS2/Sb heterostructure into an N-doped graphene framework as a complex anode material for PIBs. Due to the MoS2 nanosheets and N-doped graphene's synergistic effect in the chrysanthemum-like structure, the hierarchical composite electrode could prevent the coarsening of alloyed Sb nanograins, alleviating the volume expansion during de/potassiation, and promoting the electron/ion conductivity. As a result, a high reversible capacity of 359.5 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and outstanding cycling stability with a reversible capacity of 170.1 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1 were reported for the MoS2/Sb/N-graphene anode. Another strategy to alleviate the volumetric changes during de/potassiation is by alloying Sb with other metals to form intermetallic compounds.416 Xu et al.417 reported a nanosheet composite by embedding Bi–Sb alloy nanoparticles in a porous carbon matrix via a freeze-drying and pyrolysis method. The Bi and carbon can effectively buffer the volume change during the charge/discharge process, delivering a reversible capacity of 320 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 over 600 cycles from the reversible alloying reaction mechanism of (Bi,Sb) ↔ K(Bi,Sb) ↔ K3(Bi,Sb). When the as-prepared composite was used to assemble a full cell with PB as the cathode, it can still deliver a high capacity of 360 mA h g−1 after 70 cycles. Besides, Sb-based chalcogenides, e.g. Sb2Se3, were also developed as stable two-step conversion/alloying anodes for PIBs.418 When combined with porous carbon nanomaterials (such as rGO and N-doped carbon layers), the volume expansion of Sb2Se3 nanoparticles could be relieved, thereby enhancing the reversible specific capacity and stability. Another Sb compound, the bimetallic oxide Sb2MoO6, was investigated to improve the performance of Sb anodes. Sb2MoO6 anchored on rGO is further reported as a PIB anode material.419 Lu et al. reported that the Sb2MoO6/rGO anode has a discharge capacity of 402 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, and the capacity can still keep stable at 247 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles when the current density increases to 100 mA g−1. In situ XRD, TEM, and DFT calculations indicated that most of the high capacity is from the alloying/dealloying of Sb, which stems from the irreversible reduction of Sb2MoO6. Meanwhile, amorphous Mo, resulting after the first cycle, could improve the electrode's conductivity and relieve the volume change of Sb during cycling. Although different methods have been proposed to enhance the Sb anode's electrochemical performances, the cyclic stability and initial CE are still unsatisfactory. Future research should focus more on the fundamentals of capacity fading and improvement of the cyclic stability and rate performance for Sb-based PIB anodes.


3.3.3 Bismuth anode. 
Similar to Sn and Sb, bismuth (Bi) is a promising metal anode for PIBs, which can also alloy with three K ions due to its unique layered crystal structure with a large interlayer spacing of 3.95 Å. Although pure metallic Bi electrodes could deliver a higher theoretical capacity of 385 mA h g−1 (based on the formation of K3Bi), Bi-based electrodes still attract little attention in PIBs. The main reason might be their low CE and fast capacity fading. Guo et al.420 reported that the de/alloying process consists of two typical multi-phase reactions to form K3Bi in the initial potassiation process and a reversible stepwise mechanism (K3Bi ↔ K3Bi2 ↔ KBi2 ↔ Bi) in the following de/potassiation cycles. The total volume expansion of the phase transformation from Bi to K3Bi was found to be as high as 406%, which is much larger than that of Na3Bi (≈244%) and Li3Bi (≈106%). Thus, nanostructural design approaches, such as 2D few-layer bismuthene,421 have been proposed to improve PIB anodes’ performances. Engineering nanostructured Bi-based anodes can promote fast ion diffusion, facile electrolyte penetration, and the ability to buffer the volume change along the c-axis. The bismuthene anode showed excellent rate performance with the capacity reaching values of 423, 356, 275, and 227 mA h g−1 at 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 A g−1, respectively. Long-term cycling stability with a capacity of 200 mA h g−1 is obtained at 2 A g−1. In addition to nanostructural design, introducing various carbon matrixes to host Bi particles has also been proven to be an efficient way to accommodate the huge volume expansion during the alloying/dealloying process. Tai and co-workers422 developed a hierarchical bismuth nanodot/graphene composite by facile in situ and spontaneous reduction. Bi nanodots with a size of 3 nm are well confined between the graphene layers, preventing them from aggregating. The composite anode showed great ability to accommodate the volume change in addition to providing ionic transport channels. As a result, the Bi-nanodot/graphene composite electrode displayed an impressive reversible capacity of 213 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 5 A g−1. It even provided a stable rate capability of 200 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. Qu et al.423 fabricated hollow Bi@N-doped C nanorods via a simple evaporation method. In this structure, the hollow nanorods can buffer the volume changes of Bi during de/potassiation cycles, and the outer conductive carbon shells could promote electron transfer. A reversible capacity of 353 mA h g−1 can be achieved at 50 mA g−1, and the capacity retention is 80.3% after 300 cycles at 500 mA g−1. Jian et al.424 reported hollow structure N-doped carbon-coated Bi nanorods, which also exhibited a high-rate capability and excellent long-term cycling performance. Other Bi-based compounds that can combine both the conversion and alloying reactions, such as chalcogenides and oxyhalides, were also employed as high-performance PIB anodes. Neeraj et al.398 reported a tetradymite-type Bi2Te3 anode for rechargeable Li, Na and K-ion batteries, which exhibited initial discharge capacities of 480, 498, and 456 mA h g−1 in the three battery systems, respectively. Similar to the binary oxide Sb2MoO6, nanoplate-assembled Bi2MoO6 microspheres were tested as an anode for high-performance PIBs by Zhang et al.425 Without hybridizing with conductive carbon materials, the Bi2MoO6 microspheres could still deliver a stable reversible capacity of 121.7 mA h g−1 over 600 cycles at 100 mA g−1. Lei et al.426 found that layered bismuth oxyhalides, which are promising photocatalysts, could also be used as anodes in PIBs. The as-prepared BiOCl nanoflakes delivered a high specific capacity of 367 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 by forming K–Bi alloys during the potassiation reaction. Lu et al.427 attached bimetallic oxychloride Bi0.51Sb0.49OCl nanosheets on rGO nanosheets. The authors proposed a storage mechanism according to the following sequence: Bi0.51Sb0.49OCl → (Bi,Sb) ⇌ K(Bi,Sb) ⇌ K3(Bi,Sb). The BiOCl electrode exhibited low charge/discharge plateaus and a high discharge capacity of 360 mA h g−1 after running for 1000 cycles at 100 mA g−1. When the current density increased to 1 A g−1, the discharge capacity could remain as high as 319 mA h g−1.


3.3.4 Phosphorus anode. 
Phosphorus (P) can alloy with potassium to form K3P via a three-electron reaction. Along with its light weight, the P anode material exhibits the highest theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1 for PIBs, as it did for LIBs and SIBs.428–431 There are several allotropes known for the P element. White phosphorus is probably less suitable for electrochemical energy storage because of its toxicity and flammability in the air. On the other hand, red phosphorus is stable but has low electronic conductivity, reducing the electrochemical redox reactions.432 The 2D allotrope, known as black phosphorus, possesses the highest stability and electron mobility of all the three allotropes. Both red and black phosphorus seem to be potential anode materials for PIBs. However, practical applications of these pure P-based materials are hard to achieve since their reactivity significantly reduces the initial CE capacity, limiting the battery life to a few cycles. Thus, protocols have been employed in the literature to address these issues. One of these strategies is introducing carbon materials to improve their intrinsic insulating electronic performance and optimize their cycling stability. Sultana et al.433 found that, when encapsulating pure black phosphorus in a carbon matrix, the cycling performance is related to the mass ratio of black phosphorus to carbon. When the mass ratio of black phosphorous to carbon is 7:3, the specific capacity drops to nearly 0 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1. When the mass ratio is 1:1, the composite exhibits a specific capacity of 270 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles under the same current density, and the capacity retention rate is 60%. In a recently published paper, Yu and co-workers434 reported an outstanding PIB anode by embedding red phosphorus into N-doped porous hollow carbon nanofibers (red P@N-PHCNF) via a vaporization–condensation method (Fig. 15a). The SEM and TEM images indicated that the tubular structured composites exhibited an amorphous characteristic without any red P nanoparticles on the carbon nanofiber's surface (Fig. 15b–d). The special structure could buffer the volume expansion. The results showed a strong P–C bond, and P atoms are adsorbed at N-doped sites, facilitating the transfer and diffusion of K+ ions (Fig. 15e and f). The rationally designed electrode delivers an ultra-high reversible specific capacity of 650 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at a low current density of 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 15g). After 800 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g−1, the specific capacity was still maintained at 465 mA h g−1 (Fig. 15h). In addition, the composite anode also exhibited an excellent rate performance with a capacity of 342 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (Fig. 15h). In situ Raman and ex situ XRD results confirmed that the final discharge product of red P in this composite is K4P3 according to the overall reversible reaction 4K + 3P ⇆ K4P3. Tuan et al.435 used the ball-milling method to prepare a red P/multiwall CNT/Ketjenblack composite material. The obtained reversible capacity (750 mA h g−1), rate performance (300 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1), and cycling life (680 cycles) were slightly lower than the aforementioned vaporization–condensation method. Qu et al.436 coated a P-activated carbon composite with a thin polypyrrole layer, producing air-stable red P, and protecting the active materials from severe reaction with the electrolyte. The PPy-coated P@AC electrode has a P content of −52 wt% and delivered a capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1. In addition, forming metal phosphides was proved to increase the stability of the electrode. Examples of metal phosphides tested for PIBs include hierarchically porous carbon-supported Sn4P3,437 trigonal SnP@C,438 a SnP3/C nanocomposite,439 yolk–shell structured FeP@C nanoboxes,440 MoP@N/P-codoped carbon nanofibers,441 and a Se3P4@mesoporous carbon composite.442 Among these compounds, the Se3P4@C composite obtained excellent electrochemical performance with a remarkable initial capacity of 1036.8 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1.442 The CE of the first cycle was 68.9%, but it quickly increased to 97.5% and stabilized at about 99.3% in the following cycles. Se3P4@C showed exceptional cycling stability with a capacity retention of 78.9% after 300 cycles at 1000 mA g−1. The authors suggested that the high capacity was due to the reversible potassiation process Se3P4 + (18 − 4x)K+ + (18 − 4x)e− ⇌ 4K3−xP + 3K2Se, and the synergistic effect between Se and P elements that provides a buffering effect to reduce the volume change and retain the cycling stability. As can be concluded from the published work in this area, the capacity is proportional to the P content in the electrode, while the cycling performance is inversely proportional to the P loading in the composite. Thus, it isn’t easy to find an appropriate balance between the capacity and cyclic stability in PIBs. In future work, the main direction for P-based anodes is still the optimization of the electrochemical performances.

3.3.5 Optimizing alloy anodes. 
In addition to optimizing the active materials, the rational use of electrolytes and binders is a practical approach to maximize alloy anodes’ performance. As reviewed previously, the anode materials, either pure metals or in the form of compounds, have a large volume expansion during potassiation. For example, the Sb and Bi-metal expansion rate during the reaction is about 300% and 406%, respectively, leading to a poor cycling performance in PIBs. By choosing potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) to replace potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) in an EC and DEC (1:1 volume) mixture, Guo et al.420 reported that the Bi/rGO anode could deliver a higher initial charge capacity of 441 mA h g−1 and maintained a more stable reversible capacity of 290 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles in KFSI electrolyte. Further studies indicate that the FSI− anion could inhibit the electrolyte decomposition, modify the surface passivation, and form a more uniform, conductive, stable, and robust SEI, thereby improving the cycling stability. The KFSI salt is also very versatile and can significantly promote the electrochemical performance of other alloy-based anode materials, such as Sn/C and Sb/C composites. Furthermore, the above-mentioned results by Lei and Huang et al.443,444 are based on the non-carbonate electrolyte DME. The interaction between DME molecules and Bi in this electrolyte promotes the potassiation/depotassiation cycling. A 3D structure might be formed during the alloying process, which could also improve the cycling performance of the anode in PIBs. These electrolytes and binders can promote the ion transfer and enhance electronic contact within the active material and with the current collector. Future work should focus on electrolyte and binder optimization for improving alloy-type anodes’ performance.

4. Common synthesis methods of electrode materials
The synthesis methods are essential for the practical application of PIB electrode materials.445,446 Many pieces of research have been carried out to develop the relationship between the synthesis methods, morphology, structure and properties of materials.447–451 Furthermore, adjusting the synthesis parameters to control the electrode materials’ microstructure and morphology could provide the base for more suitable electrode materials with enhanced performance.446 Several approaches are used in the literature to prepare active materials for PIB electrodes, including co-precipitation, hydrothermal, solvothermal, high temperature solid-state, sol–gel, spray pyrolysis, mechanical ball milling and electrodeposition methods.45,46,57 There are also studies on combining two or more of these methods to optimize the electrode structure and performance.33 This section summarizes common synthesis methods used to prepare PIB electrode materials with critical views on their advantages and disadvantages for their commercial application.33,45
4.1 Co-precipitation method
The co-precipitation method is a common strategy for preparing electrode materials for several energy storage applications.452 In this method, metal salts dissolve in water and then react with preparation agents, forming water-insoluble compounds. Therefore, the co-precipitation method is straightforward, with a short synthesis period.453 Controlling the morphology and crystallinity of the final product is possible via controlling the precipitation reaction conditions such as the pH, the precipitation agent, and the solution temperature, or even using directing agents or templates during the precipitation.86 Concerning PIBs, the co-precipitation methods are mostly used to synthesize cathode materials, such as PB and PBAs,62,63 layered metal oxides,73 and chalcogenides.57 For example, PBA nanoparticles were prepared by dropping FeCl3 solution into K4Fe(CN)6 solution, which exhibited a relatively irregular spherical morphology with a crystal grain size of 20–30 nm.78 When dropping dilute HCl solution into K4Fe(CN)6 solution at 60 °C, the PBA morphology changed into regular cubic nanoparticles with size ranging from 500 to 700 nm.82 Further analysis showed that the cubic PBAs have better crystallinity than the irregular spherical particles produced without HCl addition, which was beneficial for the high specific capacity and cycling stability of cubic PBAs.
However, co-precipitation methods suffer from several drawbacks. First, the as-prepared grains’ composition might be uneven in different regions due to the partial high concentration distributed in mixed solutions.453 Also, the crystallinity of the product obtained by the co-precipitation method is commonly low; thus, additional processes, such as further heat treatment, are usually required to optimize the material's crystallinity. Therefore, the co-precipitation reaction conditions should be strictly controlled to ensure the electrode material's quality for large-scale applications.452
4.2 Hydrothermal and solvothermal methods
Hydrothermal and solvothermal processes are based on chemical reactions at high temperature and pressure in water/organic solvents, usually in a sealed pressure vessel.453 These methods have been widely used for preparing PIB cathode materials, such as layered metal oxides and polyanionic compounds.113,133 Deng et al.115 reported the preparation of homogeneous layered P2 type K0.65Fe0.5Mn0.5O2 microspheres with a diameter around 100 nm, using urea, ascorbic acid, and polyvinylpyrrolidone additives as hydrothermal raw materials. When they acted as the cathode materials for PIBs, the microspheres could provide good electronic conductivity, a shortened ion diffusion distance, and an optimized contact area between the cathode material and electrolyte, as well as superior structural robustness against strain and stress induced by K+ ion intercalation/deintercalation. As a result, excellent electrochemical performances were obtained. KTi2(PO4)3 nanocubes were also synthesized with a 200–300 nm diameter starting from anatase TiO2, KH2PO4·2H2O, and phosphoric acid as the precursors for the hydrothermal process. The nanocubes coated with carbon showed a stable structure and performed an efficient potassium storage reaction.295
In addition, hydrothermal and solvothermal methods have also been used to prepare PIB anode materials, such as various nanostructured oxides,346 sulfides,389 selenides,377 and their complexes.349 For example, CuO nanoplates with a diameter of 20 nm were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process starting from Cu(NO3)·3H2O. The prepared nanoplates were of good crystallinity and possessed a moderate surface area (48.5 m2 g−1) with abundant reaction sites.346 The well-designed structure could be conducive to electron transfer and K+ diffusion, which further resulted in a reversible capacity of 342.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. Moreover, Nithya et al.349 developed a MnCO3 nanorod@rGO composite anode with a high specific surface area of 122.6 m2 g−1, where the 5–10 nm size MnCO3 nanorods are stably fixed on the surface of rGO sheets. The composite, used as a PIB anode, could provide both high reversible capacity and superior long-term cycling performance.
Compared with other methods, the particles prepared by the hydrothermal or solvothermal method are uniform in size and can be controlled to the nanoscale. Besides, the electrode material morphology can also be effectively controlled by adjusting the reaction conditions, such as the reaction time, temperature, pH, and additives.453 However, hydrothermal or solvothermal methods are susceptible to the reaction conditions and the equipment used. Also, the methods’ productivity is low, which leads to more challenges for commercial mass production.454
4.3 High-temperature solid-state reaction method
The high-temperature solid-state reaction method is a common method for ceramic material synthesis and has been adopted to produce several structures suitable for PIB electrodes.453 Due to the high-temperature nature and good crystallinity of the product, this method is usually applied for layered metal oxide cathode materials.48 Zhang et al.99 prepared a P2-K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2 cathode material by heating a stoichiometric amount of K2CO3, NiO, and MnO2 at 1000 °C for 30 h. XRD analysis proved that the product is of high crystallinity and purity with only 3% of the NiO impurity, facilitating the de/intercalation processes. The full cell fabricated using this P2-K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2 cathode and a soft carbon anode showed excellent potassium storage performances. The capacity retention rate could be as high as 90% after 500 cycles. Liu et al.101 starting from oxides also synthesized a series of iron-substituted layered P3 manganese oxide K0.45Mn1−xFexO2 cathodes, which showed outstanding cycling stability and rate performance when x = 0.2. The authors also indicated that these properties could be further improved by regulating their particle size, porosity, and surface morphologies under different synthesis conditions.48
High-temperature solid-state processes have also been used to prepare anode materials, such as carbon composite materials, and metal oxide materials.44,45,57 For example, Ju et al.197 reported few-layer fluorinated graphene foam (FFGF) with a 4 nm thickness and high surface area (874 m2 g−1) by heating polyvinylidene fluoride at high temperatures in an inert atmosphere. After 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1, the capacity of FFGF could maintain 800 mA h g−1 with excellent rate performance. Kishore et al.289 developed a K2Ti4O9 anode by calcining a stoichiometric amount of K2CO3 and TiO2 at 900 °C for PIB research.
Although solid-state methods are simple and easy to scale up, they suffer several drawbacks that hinder their wide applications. One of these drawbacks is the large particle size of the produced materials, which decreases the electrode ability to resist pulverization upon cycling. During solid-state heating, it is easy for the active materials to get contaminated by various impurities, thus damaging their electrochemical performance. Finally, many of these solid-state methods require heating for a long time at high temperature, making them energy-intensive processes.453
4.4 Sol–gel method
Similar to solid-state methods, the sol–gel process is adopted from the ceramics industry. The process involves forming a solid network through polycondensation reactions of a molecular precursor in a liquid. To enhance the crystallinity of the final materials, the sol–gel process's green product is usually subjected to calcination at moderate temperatures.453 Zheng et al.130 reported a carbon-coated K3−xRbxV2(PO4)3/C cathode by the sol–gel method, using citric acid as a chelating agent followed by calcination at 850 °C. The synthesized samples presented good cyclic stability with a capacity retention ratio of 95.4% after 100 cycles. Chen et al.243 developed a hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon microsphere (NCS) anode material derived from marine product waste via a sol–gel method. Based on the surface-driven potassium storage mechanism, the NCS electrodes showed an excellent rate of 154 mA h g−1 at an extremely high current density of 72 °C.
The advantages of the sol–gel method for PIB electrode materials could be summarized as a low reaction temperature, short reaction time, uniform particle size distribution, and small grain size.455 The sol–gel method's disadvantages might include the slightly complicated precursor, the product sensitivity to the precursor solution and drying/calcination conditions and the hardly controllable particle size growth during the calcination step.453,455
4.5 Spray drying method
The spray drying method produces a dry powder from a liquid or slurry by rapid drying using hot gas. Generally, a consistent particle size distribution could be obtained for industrial utilization.447 For example, a layered structure P2-K0.75[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 cathode material with a particle size of 2 µm was synthesized via a spray drying method by Jo et al.,100 showing a high specific discharge capacity. Zhao et al.291 reported the preparation of K2Ti2O5 microspheres (S-KTO) with an average diameter of approximately 12 µm by a similar method, using a mixture of TiO2, K2CO3, and C6H12O6 as the raw materials. A 10 nm carbon layer was then coated on the microsphere surface via a chemical vapor deposition process. The core–shell structure promoted fast electron transfer and improved the electrode material's structural stability, enhancing the K storage performances dramatically. Despite the clear advantages of the high productivity, spray drying suffers from several drawbacks, such as contaminating the materials during the process, large particle size, and the need for high temperature and a vacuum.447
4.6 Mechanical ball milling method
This process is based on grinding raw material mixtures into fine metal, alloy, compound, and composite powders, by the localized high pressure formed during the collision between tiny rigid balls.456,457 The process might involve phase transitions or chemical reactions induced by mechanical forces. Jo et al.106 obtained a K2V3O8/C composite cathode material by blending K2V3O8 powder with 5 wt% carbon black by high-energy ball milling for 12 h. Besides reducing the particle size, ball milling also helped induce defects in both the carbon and K2V3O8, introducing more active sites to initiate the electrochemical storage reactions. Consequently, the K2V3O8/C cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 75 mA h g−1, which could be retained for at least 200 cycles. Chang et al.435 reported a red phosphorus/carbon (RP/C) composite electrode by combining RP, MWCNTs, KB, NaCMC, and water through a one-pot ball milling process in a stainless steel tank. RP with an average size of about 200–500 nm is evenly distributed in the conductive frame constructed from MWCNTs and KB. XPS results showed no bond between P and C, limiting the alloying reactions between RP and K. The RP/C electrode exhibited a high reversible specific capacity of around 750 mA h g−1 and an excellent high-rate capability (≈300 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1). In conclusion, the mechanical ball milling method has easy operation and low cost, but the particle distribution's purity and uniformity are hard to control.453,456
4.7 Electrodeposition method
By the electrodeposition method, solid materials can be deposited on the surface of conductive materials.458,459 Controlling the deposited materials’ morphology is possible by controlling the electrochemical properties, such as the applied potential, current density, electrolyte composition and the surface properties of the electrode. Tian et al.414 reported an MXene@Sb cathode material by depositing Sb nanoparticles on the surface of a hierarchical porous platform of Ti3C2Tx MXene. The Sb nanoparticles were deposited from SbCl3 solution in ethylene glycol under a constant density of 1 mA cm−2 using a Pt counter electrode. The stable structure could provide a short distance for K+ ion diffusion, and the porous structure would also buffer the volume expansion of the potassiation/depotassiation process. Finally, a high reversible capacity of 516.8 mA h g−1 and a stable capacity retention rate were obtained. In addition to the ability to control the morphology of the product, electrodeposition possessed several other advantages, such as the purity of the product, low energy consumption, low waste generation, and being easy to scale up. However, application of the method is limited to depositing metals or semi-metals on conductive substrates.
4.8 Other methods and future outlook
In addition to the methods mentioned above, there are also many other methods for preparing electrode materials of PIBs, such as the template method,460 solution immersion method,198 electrostatic spinning method,312 and various high-temperature carbonization methods.242,249,254,312 The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared materials via these methods might also be different. In future studies, optimizing the existing synthesis methods, developing novel synthesis methods, or designing a combination of other synthesis methods should be carried out to enhance the performances of electrode materials in PIBs and further promote their practical application in energy storage.
5. Full cell PIBs
5.1 The significance of the full cell test
At present, the vast majority of studies on PIBs, as with other alkali metal ion batteries, focus on either single cathode or anode materials, using metallic potassium as the counter and reference electrodes to evaluate the electrochemical performance and mechanism.47,57 As reviewed in the previous sections, the cathode materials exhibit a high working voltage compared to their LIB counterpart.82,107 We can also conclude that the anode materials exhibit greater cycling stability and higher rate performance on average than the cathode.208,234 PIBs are still facing several challenges, which are not limited to increasing the working voltage and specific capacity of half-cells, but, more importantly, include the question of what combination of materials could collaboratively work to ensure that the full cell meets the energy density requirements.33,45 It is still necessary to ensure full-cell economic sustainability to meet large-scale energy storage requirements. Therefore, we will further discuss the design and research of full cell PIBs in the following content.
5.2 Design of full cell PIBs
Full cell PIBs consist of a cathode, an anode, a separator, and an electrolyte, usually potassium salts in an organic solvent and sometimes with additives to realize an extra function. These components can be used to design different configurations of the full cell. In the lab, the components of a full-cell design are usually assembled in coin cell type devices. Examples of commonly used coin cells conforming to the relevant International Standard (IEC) are CR2025 and CR2032. These coin cell PIBs are well suited to powering small portable devices, such as LEDs. According to the literature results, we found that commonly reported cathode materials for full cell PIBs include PB, layered metal oxides, polyanionic compounds and organic materials.108,135,165 Their matched anode materials contain carbon-based materials, metallic alloy materials, and some other materials.218,423,435 It is worth noting that most cathodes and anodes of full cells often need a complete pre-potassiation process in the half-cell with metallic potassium as the counter electrode to eliminate the adverse effects in the initial cycle. Also, prior to assembly, the charge balance of the cathode and anode needs to be optimized by controlling the mass ratio.
Like LIBs, the operating voltage, cycling performances and high price of cathodes are the bottlenecks restricting their further practical applications.21 Compared with the anodes, cathode development is slightly slower since it has more technical problems.25 It is widely accepted that the cathode properties directly determine the full cell performance and potential commercial development of PIBs.21Table 2 summarizes different full cell configurations and their performance reported so far in the literature.

5.2.1 PB and PBAs for full cell PIBs. 
As discussed above, PB and PBAs are the most commonly used cathode materials in full cell PIBs because of their high voltage platform and excellent cycling stability.78 To improve PB and PBAs’ electrochemical performances, it is usually necessary to control the interstitial water content and formulate PBAs with multiple transition metals. In the past few years, PBAs based on Fe, Mn, and Ni have been reported. The electrochemical performance has been heavily studied in the half-cell configuration.74,79,82 In full cell PIBs, the anode materials used to evaluate the PBA full cell performance are usually carbon-based, such as graphite and AC.461 Glass fiber is commonly selected as the separator between the cathode and anode. Potassium salts, such as KPF6 and KFSA, are dissolved in DEC, PC, EC, DME, or other solvents as the electrolyte.462–465
Lei et al.78 reported K0.220Fe[Fe(CN)6]0.805·4.01H2O nanoparticles (KPBNPs) by a simple co-precipitation method, using commercial carbon black Super P as the anode, and glass fiber (Whatman, Grade GF/B) as the separator. The KPBNP‖carbon Super P full cell was fabricated with 0.8 M KPF6 in EC:DEC = 1:1 vol% as the electrolyte, and the cathode and anode mass ratio was 1:1. Within the full cell charge and discharge in the range of 1.0–3.8 V, the cell exhibited a specific capacity of 71 mA h g at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and a capacity retention of 93.4% after 50 cycles. Cary L. Pint et al.466 prepared potassium-containing PB (KPB) with a cubic morphology by changing the precipitation conditions, using 1 M KPF6 in diglyme electrolyte to assemble the KPB‖graphite full cell. The cathode and anode mass loading were −0.8 and −0.5 mg cm−2, respectively. At 17.7 °C, the full cell's specific capacity was about 30 mA h g−1, and the capacity retention reached 60% after 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1 (>11C, the specific capacity is about 35 mA h g−1). Shinichi Komaba et al.467 also prepared K1.75Mn[FeII(CN)6]0.93·0.16H2O (K-MnHCFe) via a simple co-precipitation process. Using 0.7 M KPF6 in EC:DEC = 1:1 vol% as the electrolyte to assemble a K-MnHCFe‖graphite full cell, the average working voltage was 3.5 V. The reversible specific capacity was confirmed to be 110 and 60 mA h (g of K-MnHCFe)−1 at a current density of 30 mA g−1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. The energy density was as high as 536 W h kg−1. The same research group further prepared K2Mn[Fe(CN)6],468 which was assembled into a K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]‖graphite full cell with 7 mol kg−1 KFSA in DME as the electrolyte. With a wide voltage range of 0–4.3 V, the full cell provided a specific capacity of 104 mA h (g of K2Mn[Fe(CN)6])−1, and it achieves capacity retention of more than 85% after 101 cycles. Nickel-containing PBAs have also been used for assembling and testing full cell PIBs. Liu et al.469 used K1.81Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.97·0.086H2O (KNHCF) and graphite as the cathode and anode to assemble a KNHCF‖graphite full cell, which showed a capacity of 37.8 mA h g−1 at a working voltage of 3.34 V after 100 cycles (10 mA g−1). The K1.90Ni0.5Fe0.5[Fe(CN)6]0.89·0.42H2O‖graphite full cell reported by Chong et al.470 presented a reversible initial capacity of 84.9 mA h g−1 with an operating voltage of 3.33 V at 10 mA g−1, which could successfully light an LED.
Due to the simple preparation method, high working voltage platform and excellent cycling stability, PBAs such as K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] and K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] prepared by the co-precipitation method are also commonly used as cathodes to evaluate the full cell performance of anode materials, including carbon materials, conversion anodes, and alloy anodes.471,472 Yang et al.218 synthesized 3D carbon nanofiber (CNF) aerogels co-doped with sulfur and nitrogen (S/N-CNFAs) by pyrolyzing seaweed aerogels. A KPB‖S/N-CNFA full cell was assembled using KPB as the cathode and 1 M KPF6 in EC:DEC = 1:1 vol% electrolyte. A specific capacity of 198 mA h (g of S/N-CNFA)−1 was achieved in a voltage range of 2.0–4.2 V (200 mA g−1), which could retain 92% after 60 cycles. Qiu et al.219 designed nitrogen/phosphorus double-doped vertically aligned graphene (N, P-VG@CC) grown on carbon cloth as a flexible non-adhesive anode material and used it to fabricate a full cell with KPB. The cell afforded a high capacity up to 116.25 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. The cell also achieved a maximum energy density of 232.5 W h kg−1, and the peak power density reaches 4 kW kg−1. The full cell was able to light up 57 green LEDs and power an electronic watch successfully. Wu et al.265 reported a full cell of a highly nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (NCNF-650) anode and KPB cathode. At a current density of 0.2 A g−1, the initial specific discharge capacity was 197 mA h (g of NCNF-650)−1.
Regarding conversion-type anodes, our group prepared nano-rose-like MoS2@rGO by a hydrothermal method and fabricated a full cell with a K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode.299 The cell showed an initial discharge specific capacity of 124.9 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, and a capacity retention rate of 95.4% after 10 cycles. Zhan et al.473 used a bottom-up solvothermal method to anchor 1T/2H MoS2 nanosheets on an N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron, 1T/2H-MoS2/NCNHP. In cooperation with the K2Fe[Fe(CN)6] cathode, the full cell was tested in a voltage window of 1.0–4.0 V. The cell also showed an initial discharge capacity of 136.1 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention rate of 74.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1.
Concerning alloy-type anodes, phosphorus-based materials have the highest theoretical specific capacities.434 Tuan et al.435 prepared a composite of red phosphorus with carbon and fabricated a full cell with a KMnHCF cathode. At different charge/discharge rates of 150 and 600 mA g−1, the KMnHCF‖RP/C full cell showed capacities of 450 and 380 mA h g−1 over 40 cycles, respectively. The authors disassembled the cell and found that the full cell's separator has better wettability than in the half-cell. Cao et al.439 prepared SnP3/C nanocomposite anodes by high-energy ball milling and used a KPB cathode to assemble the full cell. The reversible capacity of KPB‖SnP3/C could achieve 305 mA h g−1 in a voltage window of 0.5–3.8 V and after 30 cycles. Chen et al.412 used a 3D macroporous Sb@carbon composite (Sb@C-3DP) as the anode and a KFeHCF cathode. The full cell provided a reversible capacity of 508 mA h (g of Sb@C-3DP)−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and an energy density of 197.6 W h kg−1. Bi nanorods encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (hollow Bi@C nanorods) as the anode and a KPB cathode were used to assemble a full cell by Liu et al.423 The KPB‖Bi@C cell exhibited a specific capacity of 280.5 mA h (g of Bi@C)−1 with a capacity retention of 88.6% after 100 cycles. Bismuth–antimony alloy nanoparticles attached on a porous carbon (BiSb@C) anode and K4Fe(CN)6(KFC) cathode were assembled into a full cell. KFC‖BiSb@C delivered a reversible specific capacity of 396.5 mA h (g of BiSb@C)−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1.417 He et al.474 assembled a KFeHCF‖Sb0.5Bi0.5@C full cell, which obtained a high reversible capacity of 430 and 225 mA h (g of Sb0.5Bi0.5@C)−1 at 0.05 and 2.0 A g−1, respectively.


5.2.2 Layered transition metal oxides for full cell PIBs. 
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes, e.g. the currently popular high-nickel (NCM), are widely used in full cell LIBs.25 Therefore, similar oxides have also been evaluated as the cathode of PIB full cells.48 Glass fiber is again the most commonly used separator, and the majority of the published studies used KPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1) with different concentrations as the electrolyte.475,476 Ceder et al.108 reported a bulk layered P2 type K0.6CoO2 cathode and assembled the full cell using a graphite anode, which delivered a specific discharge capacity of 53 mA h (g of K0.6CoO2)−1 at a current density of 3 mA g−1. Wang et al.460 prepared P2 type K0.6CoO2 microspheres (s-KCO) and used them to fabricate a full cell with a hard carbon anode. The cell showed a specific charge and discharge capacity of 73 and 72 mA h (g of s-KCO)−1 at 30 mA g−1, respectively. After 50 cycles, the full cell still maintained a reversible specific capacity of 62 mA h g−1. Compared with the above-mentioned bulk morphology of P2-type K0.6CoO2, the microsphere electrode could deliver a better full cell performance, which could be attributed to the suppression of the side reactions between the microspheres and the electrolyte.
Zhang et al.477 reported a P3 type K0.5MnO2 hollow submicrosphere cathode by a self-templating strategy, and completed the full cell with a graphite anode and 0.8 M KPF6 in EC:DEC = 1:1 vol% electrolyte. The full cell showed an energy density of 100.7 W h kg−1 with a cut-off voltage of 3.5 V. To solve the problem of K0.5MnO2 peeling off the electrode at a high cut-off voltage, Zhu et al.478 proposed 2.5 M KFSI in TEP as the electrolyte instead of the traditional EC-based electrolyte, and consequently a cut-off voltage up to 4 V could be employed. The K0.5MnO2‖graphite full cell could provide a reversible capacity of 110.6 mA h (g of K0.5MnO2)−1 and an energy density of 194.6 W h kg−1 at 20 mA g−1. Xu et al.113 achieved some improvements in the full cell performances by increasing the content of K in KxMnO2. The reported K0.77MnO2·0.23H2O‖hard–soft composite carbon full cell exhibited a stable reversible specific capacity of 121 and 70 mA h g−1 at 100 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively.
Binary and ternary layered transition metal oxides have also been evaluated as cathode materials for full cell PIBs. Zheng et al.99 reported the Ni/Mn-based P2 type cathode performance in a full cell using a soft carbon anode. The K0.44Ni0.22Mn0.78O2‖soft carbon cell exhibited initial charge and discharge capacities of 78.9 and 69.2 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity of the full cell could still maintain 90% at 50 mA g−1 after 500 cycles. Weng et al.479 reported layered K0.7Mn0.7Mg0.3O2 microparticles and assembled a full cell with a hard carbon anode, which showed initial charge and discharge capacities of 86.4 and 73.5 mA h (g of K0.7Mn0.7Mg0.3O2)−1 at 100 mA g−1, respectively. It is worth mentioning here that the full cell performances of ternary P2 type layered transition metal oxide cathodes have also been reported. Sun et al.480 reported the electrochemical evaluation of ternary layered transition metal oxide cathodes in full cells using a hard carbon anode. The K0.75[Mn0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1]O2‖hard carbon full cell showed a capacity retention of 60% after 1000 cycles at 21 mA g−1.


5.2.3 Polyanionic compounds for full cell PIBs. 
Polyanionic compounds have a high working voltage close to that of PBAs.133 In half-cell PIBs, their cut-off voltage can even be set to 5 V, thereby suggesting potential application in high energy density scenarios, which is similar to the commercial use of LiFePO4‖graphite full cells in LIBs.25 In the research on full cell PIBs, these polyanionic compound cathodes are almost limited to vanadate and oxalate.481 Glass fiber is still the commonly used separator. The electrolyte formulation is slightly different, potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in EC:EMC (1:1 vol%), but its impact has not been explained. KVPO4F was the first reported batch of high voltage polyanionic compounds suitable for PIB cathodes. Chen et al.358 integrated a KVPO4F-C cathode with the composite Sb2S3@S,N-doped graphene as the full cell's anode. The first specific capacity of the KVPO4F-C‖Sb2S3@S,N-doped graphene cell was 532 mA h (g of Sb2S3-SNG)−1 with an energy density of 166.3 W h kg−1. Chen et al.135 fabricated a KVPO4F‖VPO4 full cell, which showed excellent reversible charge and discharge capacities and a good capacity retention of 86% after 300 cycles at 50 mA g−1. When the current density increased to 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 mA g−1, the recorded discharge capacities were 102, 101, 99, 97, 92, 84, and 71 mA h g−1, respectively. Yan et al.482 synthesized K0.51V2O5 nanobelts with a large interlayered structure and optimized growth orientation by reconstructing the V–O polyhedra of orthorhombic V2O5. After assembling a K0.51V2O5‖graphite full cell, the reversible specific capacity and energy density of the full cell were 94 mA h (g of K0.51V2O5)−1 and 238 W h kg−1, respectively. A reversible specific capacity of 60 mA h g−1 could also be achieved at a high current density of 2 A g−1, with a capacity retention rate of 84% after 100 cycles.
Tang et al.107 reported iron-based oxalic acid (KLi3Fe(C2O4)3@C) as the cathode for potassium storage. Coupled with a soft carbon anode, the full cell showed reversible specific capacities of 100, 80, 75, and 70 mA h (g of KLi3Fe(C2O4)3@C)−1 at 240, 600, 960 and 1200 mA g−1, respectively. The same authors also reported another high voltage polyanionic compound K4Fe3(C2O4)3(SO4)2 (KFOS),483 which was also tested in a full cell with a soft carbon anode. The capacity retention of KFOS‖soft carbon was above 73% when the current density increased from 200 to 1000 mA g−1. After 200 cycles, the capacity retention was close to 100%. Fluorooxalate (KFeC2O4F) is reported as the cathode for full cell PIBs.143 The full cell, with a soft carbon anode, yielded an energy density of −235 W h kg−1 and could light up more than 40 red and yellow LEDs simultaneously. At current densities increasing stepwise from 0.1 to 0.5 A g−1, the reversible specific capacities of the full cell were 83.7, 71.0, 65.7, 64.7, and 62.6 mA h g−1, respectively. It also maintained excellent cycling stability within 200 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1.


5.2.4 Organic materials for full cell PIBs. 
The unique set of organic materials’ properties (e.g., flexibility and high theoretical specific capacity) makes them strong candidates for developing organic full cell PIBs.163 However, to date, fewer organic materials were reported for assembling full cells, which only include Na2AQ26DS,165 PTCDI,156 PIM,484 PTCDA,485 and AQDS.167 The commonly used separator material is still glass fiber, while the electrolyte for the organic full cell is usually KFSI in DEM.163,485–488
Fan et al.165 reported that polyanionic sodium anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (Na2AQ26DS) could be employed as an organic cathode for full cells, and graphite was used as the anode material. The resulting Na2AQ26DS‖graphite full cell can deliver average capacities of −105 mA h (g of Na2AQ26DS)−1 (100 mA g−1) and −64 mA h (g of Na2AQ26DS)−1 for 2500 cycles (500 mA g−1). The same research group reported in another paper perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) as a new organic cathode,156 delivering a stable capacity of −120 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 4 A g−1 in half cells. When fabricating into full cells, with a graphite anode, the PTCDI cathode displayed an average capacity of ∼127 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 over 30 cycles. At current densities of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mA g−1, the full cell could hold capacity values of 126, 107, 92, 85, and 80 mA h g−1, respectively. They further developed an insoluble [N,N′-bis(2-anthraquinone)]-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxydiimide (PTCDI-DAQ) organic cathode.157 Using reduced potassium terephthalate (K4TP) as the organic anode, the full organic cell showed a long stable lifespan (6–2 mA h (g of PTCDI-DAQ)−1 after 10000 cycles), energy density (295 Wh (kg of PTCDI-DAQ)−1), and power density (13800 W (kg of PTCDI-DAQ)−1). Lei et al.484 prepared a PIM@KB organic cathode by depositing polyimide on porous Ketjenblack through a polymerization reaction and assembled a full cell with a nitrogen-doped soft carbon anode. The PIM@KB‖N-soft carbon cell exhibited reversible capacities of 139, 131, 125, 115, and 106 mA h g−1 at different rates of 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 mA g−1, respectively.
The first reported PTCDA as a PIB organic cathode material did not perform well. Lu et al.485 annealed the PTCDA cathode at 450 °C and fabricated it into a full cell with a soft carbon anode in 3M KFSI in DME electrolyte. The PTCDA@450 °C‖soft carbon provided reversible capacities of 116, 109, 94, 80, 70, 63 and 56 mA g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. The full cell exhibited long-term stability (capacity retention rate of 65%) at 600 mA g−1 after 3000 cycles. The focus was then switched to red-224 PTCDA as the cathode for full cells, coupled with various anodes. Yan et al.486 selected PTCDA as the cathode to assemble a full cell with an ultrahigh pyridinic N-content-doped porous carbon monolith (PNCM) anode. The full cell could successfully light up an LED watch. Specifically, when the current density increased from 50 to 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, the specific discharge capacity of the PTCDA‖PNCM full cell only dropped slightly from 245 to 168, 143, 114, 99, and 85 mA h (g of PNCM)−1, respectively. Zhang et al.487 compounded MoS2 with hollow porous carbon spheres (MoS2@HPCS) and used it as the anode in a full cell where PTCDA was the cathode (the voltage window is 0.5–3.5 V). The initial discharge and charge specific capacities of the PTCDA‖MoS2@HPCS full cell were 670.9 and 444.7 mA h g−1, respectively. They also reported a bismuth molybdate microsphere (Bi2MoO6) and evaluated its application potential in a full cell by matching with PTCDA.425 At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the full cell showed a charge and discharge specific capacity of 424.3 and 315.1 mA h g−1, respectively. Zhang et al.488 encapsulated bimetallic selenide (MoSe2/CoSe2) into N/S co-doped hollow carbon nanospheres, which was then connected to rGO (rGO@MCSe). rGO@MCSe was used as the anode to fabricate a full cell with a PTCDA@450 °C cathode, which was used as the anode to fabricate with the PTCDA@450 °C cathode. The full cell showed an initial discharge specific capacity of 114.8 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a capacity retention of 74.1 mA h g−1 after 125 cycles.
PTCDA cathodes have also been used to evaluate the full cell performance of alloy anode materials. Lu et al.489 synthesized (Bi,Sb)2S3 nanotubes by a low-temperature method and used them to assemble a full cell with a PTCDA cathode. The PTCDA‖(Bi,Sb)2S3 full cell presented a reversible specific discharge capacity of 260 mA h (g of (Bi,Sb)2S3)−1 at 500 mA g−1. The initial specific discharge capacity was 276 mA h g−1, which decayed to 222 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, and then stabilized at 207 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. In a recent study, bimetallic oxychloride (Bi- and Sb-based oxychloride) nanosheets were grown on rGO (Bi0.51Sb0.49OCl/rGO).427 The full cell with a PTCDA cathode could achieve a high capacity of 285 mA h (g of Bi0.51Sb0.49OCl/rGO)−1 at 100 mA g−1. The full cell PTCDA‖Bi0.5Sb0.5@P was also reported with a reversible specific discharge capacity of 151 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.490

5.3 Commercialization of full cell PIBs
Although the history of LIBs can be traced back to 1970, production and commercialization of LIBs increased rapidly after 1992.21,25 Intensive research on the commercialization of PIBs is much younger, dating back to 2015. There is only one commercial use of a full cell PIBs by the Chinese company Starsway Electronics to power media player portable devices to the best of our knowledge.
In the above review of PIBs, we found that cathode materials, such as PBAs and PTCDA, are often used for full cell performance evaluation of anode materials, while most of the anode materials still are graphite, which is similar to that of LIBs. Low-cost electrode materials are also favored. However, according to the working mechanism and structure of the full cell, the electrode material is only a small part. In addition, the adaptation of the electrolyte is rarely studied in full cell PIBs. In contrast, the refined electrolyte configuration has been targeted for each type of full cell LIBs. From our point of view, PBA‖graphite (glass fiber, KPF6) would be the first step towards commercialization of full cell PIBs. However, the optimization of electrode materials and electrolytes still needs to be continued.
6. Summary and perspectives
With the exponentially growing consumption of lithium resources in recent years, it is vital to develop alternative technologies for large-scale energy storage to compete with commercialized LIB systems.21 Among the reported rechargeable batteries, PIBs, which are based on using the earth-abundant K element as the charge carrier, are considered suitable for next-generation energy storage systems.45 As graphite is commonly used as an anode for LIBs, it was the first choice anode for PIBs, promoting safety and cycling stability according to some reports.180–183 Moreover, we compared the specific energy, working voltage, cycle life, cost, safety, and the prospects of existing battery systems, such as LIBs, SIBs, Li–S, Na–S, and lead–acid batteries.491–497 As shown in Fig. 16, each kind of battery has different advantages and is thus expected to have various practical application prospects in the future. PIBs exhibit several superiorities, including low cost and high working voltage. However, the major drawbacks are low specific energy, and poor cycle life and safety, which still challenge their potential practical application. The theoretical and practical issues of PIBs are different from LIBs and SIBs because of the larger ionic radius and the higher reactivity of potassium.33 Hence, designing electrode materials and fabricating full cells are quite different in PIBs. One challenge is adjusting the lattice structures of the active materials (such as enlarged interlayer spacing, increased transport channels, low K-intercalation energy barrier, etc.) to facilitate large-radius K+ transport. Other challenges that might appear on a larger scale include the morphological control of the electrode materials to enhance the battery behavior by boosting the kinetics of K+ and electron transport, accommodating the volumetric change, avoiding particle agglomeration and restraining active material dissolution and dispersion. Beyond one particle dimension, the interface interactions (including the electrode–electrolyte interface, single-phase interface of the particles, different-phase interfaces, etc.) are also of great importance to the thermodynamics and kinetics characteristics of the electrode during cycling. To promote PIBs for further application, the design, synthesis, and optimization of electrode materials should be supported by theoretical calculations and in-depth reaction mechanism investigations (Fig. 17). Thus, more research is still needed to meet the requirements of further practical application of high-performance PIBs.

6.1 Electrode materials and structures for future technologies

6.1.1 Developing high-performance cathode materials. 
Based on the type of electrochemical reactions, active cathode materials can be categorized into insertion and conversion cathode types. For insertion cathodes, where K+ ions are inserted between the layers of the crystals and then removed in the second half of the cycle, materials such as PB and its analogues, layered transition metal oxides, and flexible organic materials can be used. In this case, a crystal structure that can accommodate the sizeable volumetric change during the K+ ion insertion/deinsertion is crucial for determining the cathode cycle life. Unfortunately, most of the active materials investigated so far cannot sustain substantial volumetric changes, and also exhibited limited storage capacity, and have low conductivity in their native phase. Future research exploring novel flexible structures combined with theoretical prediction would be one of the most effective ways to tolerate the inevitable structural deformation. Also, crystal structure optimization, such as lattice optimization, cationic/anion substitution, and heteroatom doping, could play a dual role in improving the structural stability and optimising the Fermi level to enhance their reversible capacity and long-term cyclability. These methods may also be a potential direction to change the one-electron transfer process of the most promising PB and PB analogue cathodes into multi-electron storage per formula unit with higher capacity and stability. To further improve the electronic conductivity of electrodes, electronic conductive agents (e.g. carbon-based materials) might be a good option to be added into the materials, which could also help to buffer the volumetric changes during cycling. Developing intrinsically conductive cathode materials, probably using potassium-rich phases, or creating more anionic defects, may also help reduce the electrode resistance. Moreover, the reinforcement of PB analogues’ thermal stability and organic cathode materials is also required for further commercial applications. Finally, the essential characteristics and mechanism determination of the reversibility of K+ ion insertion/extraction in insertion-type cathodes should be investigated more deeply to provide references for further developing new high-performance cathode materials.
In conversion cathodes, potassium storage is achieved by solid-state redox reactions with repeated breaking and reforming of chemical bonds during potassiation/depotassiation cycling. These cathode materials, including metal fluorides and chlorides, sulfur, selenium, iodine, and oxygen, always have high theoretical capacity and volumetric capacities. Most of these materials have been used in LIBs and SIBs with better success. Although using them in PIBs is still at an early stage, the results thus far show poor cycling stability due to three competing factors: the poor electrical conductivity, the severe side reactions, and the possible pulverization and/or dissolution of intermediates (e.g. polysulfides). Future studies of these conversion-type cathodes could focus on designing novel low-dimensional nanostructures that can minimize the detrimental effect of the repeated phase changes. Another future direction would be investigating new multi-structure composites that can buffer the contentious changes in the active material, such as carbon yolk–shell structures, or introducing two competing processes, such as mixing two or more active materials. Developing suitable electrolytes and electrolyte additives for the corresponding systems will also improve the cycling stability by minimizing electrode dissolution and parasitic reactions. Using potassium-rich materials might also control the formation of intermediate phases, hence improving the cathode's stability. Indeed, optimizing the cathode production method is necessary to reduce costs and achieve a high energy density before practical application.


6.1.2 Designing stable nano-structural anode materials. 
The research on the anode materials is still dominated by carbon-based materials, with some attempts to use alloy-based materials, layered metal compounds, metal–organic framework materials, and organic materials. The selection of these materials is mainly based on their reported success with LIBs, with few attempts to design anode materials specifically for potassium systems. Despite the clear efforts, there are still several challenges in developing suitable carbon-based electrode materials with reasonable potassium-storage capability. Some metal-based compound anodes, such as titanium-based compounds, have shown high reversible capacities, and good cycling stability, but their low energy density still limits their practical applications. Anodes based on materials that can alloy with potassium exhibited high specific capacities and energy density. However, they present finite cycling stability due to the serious volume and phase variations with further particle pulverization and aggregation. The dwindling contact among particles fades their capacity rapidly. Intercalation-based anodes will probably be ruled out as candidates for PIBs shortly since inserting the large size of K+ in the defined interlayer space will make any improvement in their performance incremental. To facilitate the commercial feasibility of PIBs, future research should focus on improving the storage capacity and long-term stability based on conventional anode materials. Nano-architectural design and engineering of more robust anode structures should be investigated more with a focus on improving the cycling and rate performance. The new designs should tolerate sizeable volume variation, resist pulverization, and increase the electrode/electrolyte interface area. Engineering low dimensional materials into porous 3D architectures may help in buffering the volumetric changes and shorten the diffusion pathways. More active sites could be exposed to the electrolyte, which facilitates the K+ reaction with the anode with increasing the specific surface area. Multi-structure design and morphology optimization on heterostructure composite electrodes, including all kinds of hierarchical structures, hollow structures, coated structures, sandwich-type structures, yolk–shell structures etc., could become promising strategies to alleviate the mechanical stress during charge/discharge cycling. The formed internal electric field at the interfaces of the coupled materials could bring rapid diffusion while improving the electronic/ionic conductivity and the electrochemical activity. Functionalizing the anode materials to have more target groups on the surface is another way to enhance the K+ kinetics by reducing the adsorption energy. Of course, the preparation process of the designed nano-architectural materials should be low cost, simple to control, and easy to automatic fabrication for further practical application.

6.2 Theoretical calculations for PIBs

6.2.1 DFT calculations supporting the improvement of the electrode performance. 
Since the development of entirely new active materials is difficult, optimizing the current materials’ composition seems more practical. Heteroatom doping of anode materials, typically with N, S, O, P, F, and/or B, has shown great success with LIB and SIB anodes but has not been studied enough in PIBs. The defects or vacancies forming in the heteroatom doping sites’ vicinity force electrons to rearrange, altering the electronic structure or the hybridization states. This electron redistribution has a significant influence on improving the reaction kinetics and the electrode electrical conductivity. Doping carbonaceous materials with nitrogen, especially pyridinic N, is known to enhance the K–C adsorption bond around the nitrogen doping sites. Some reports have linked nitrogen doping to improved initial reversible capacity in all alkali-ion batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that doping carbon materials with P, S, F, and B atoms improves the electron transfer and enlarges the interlayer distance, leading to stabilizing the structures and improving the theoretical capacities. However, no experimental data have been published yet. The so-called co-doping (doping using more than one element) can improve the electrode performance by all the dopants’ synergistic effect. For example, co-doping hard carbon materials with N and O could simultaneously enhance the capacity and cycling performance. DFT calculations and further experimental research on various combinations of multi-element doped electrodes, such as N/S doped, N/P doped, S/O doped, P/B doped, and N/P/S doped carbon, should be investigated carefully in the near future.
Similarly, replacing the cations in the cathode material lattice with a different valence cation or inducing defects in the anionic parts may also enhance the cathode's conductivity and reactivity toward K+. Similar strategies have been successfully used with LIB and SIB cathodes, but very few experimental or theoretical studies can be found for PIBs. Material simulation techniques could help optimize the cathode materials by determining the type and level of doped cations. It could also help predict the properties of the materials when a certain level of defects is introduced in the anion sites. Co-doping cathode materials with more than one cation or with cations and anions should also be investigated theoretically in the future to benefit from the synergy between the dopants.


6.2.2 In-depth understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism. 
More theoretical and experimental studies are needed to gain more insights into the electrochemical reaction mechanism and the changes in both electrodes during charge/discharge. During the potassiation process on both electrodes, several intermediate phases are formed. The properties of theses phases are not the same as the starting materials. Material simulation might help determine the properties of the intermediate phases, such as their conductivity and solubility in the electrolyte, increasing the electrode stability. Of particular interest, the mechanism of forming the SEI layer should receive more attention. Engineering a robust SEI through ALD, CVD, or similar techniques would undoubtedly help prevent unwanted reactions on the electrode/electrolyte interface, preventing severe electrolyte decomposition and improving the electrode's overall stability. In the near future, advanced in situ spectroscopic characterization techniques (e.g. cryogenic electron microscopy, HRTEM, STEM, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared microscopy) with supporting DFT calculations could help to understand the K ion transport through the SEI, as well as get more details on the side reactions and SEI formation process. More focus should be on understanding the reactions in the electrolyte. DFT calculations can bring more insights on the relation between anions and cations in the electrolytes and the interaction between ions and the base solvent. The transport mechanism and kinetics of K ions in different electrolytes should also receive more attention in the future.

6.3 Advanced in situ characterization techniques for PIBs
During the charging and discharging process of alkali metal-ion batteries such as LIBs, SIBs and PIBs, ion migration and movement cause changes in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the cell is closely related to the internal structure or composition changes during cycling. Many analytical techniques have been used to study the battery structure and chemical changes, most of which are ex situ. These ex situ techniques cannot obtain accurate information, particularly about instantaneous processes that might produce unstable phases. On the other hand, in situ techniques are useful to collect real-time data about the chemical reactions or phase changes during electrochemical potassiation/depotassiation.

In situ characterization has been widely used to study LIBs, including in situ XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, etc. However, the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions of K+ with most electrode materials are not well understood as in the LIB case. Therefore, more applications of in situ techniques in PIB research are anticipated in the future. In situ TEM and XRD should be carried out to collect more real-time data that might help understand the K+ ion insertion/extraction process and SEI film formation in PIB systems. It is perhaps important from the experimental perspective to design new cell systems that would allow real-time monitoring of the electrochemical processes. For example, performing XPS or FTIR on the electrolyte/electrode interface would enable more knowledge of the surface reactions and the formation of the SEI film. However, these kinds of studies will require a careful design of the specific experimental rig. In the future, the accuracy and applicability of the existing in situ analytical technique should be improved, perhaps also designing new instruments exclusively for PIBs. Furthermore, it will be great to see some development in combining more than one in situ technique. Collecting more than one type of data simultaneously will be useful for a better understanding of several spontaneous and fast processes.
6.4 Optimizing full cell design for applications
Most of the research carried out thus far is focused on the active materials, with the majority of the lab tests conducted on half-cell configurations using potassium metal as the counter electrode. In this case, it is known that the exact cycling behavior of the working electrode might be concealed by the side reactions between the potassium metal electrode and electrolytes. For instance, the Coulombic efficiency of carbon-based anodes (e.g. hard carbon, CNTs, and graphene) is always less than 70%, which, of course, severely limits their practical application. In order to move PIBs closer to commercial use, other areas, such as electrolytes, electrolyte additives, and binders, should also be investigated. More attention should also be paid to optimizing full cells using the best-known electrolyte and electrode materials.

6.4.1 Electrolyte matching and optimization. 
The electrolytes, as the window for electrochemical reactions by connecting the electrodes, are significantly crucial for the development of commercial PIBs. On the interface of the electrolytes and electrodes, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer passivation film is usually formed on the electrode surface because of the irreversible reduction of electrolytes. In PIBs, the SEI layer is thick, implying poor ionic diffusion kinetics and high resistance. One route to improve the ionic conductivity of the SEI layer is by optimizing the electrolyte (alkali salts and solvents) and investigating new additives to manage the SEI formation. Suppressing dendrite growth and minimizing the side reactions also need to be considered in the new electrolyte system development process. Since the amount of electrolyte in the actual full cell is limited, issues related to dendrite formation, the SEI layer, and side reactions would significantly influence the cell's overall performance. Reports have shown that the KFSI electrolyte has higher conductivity than KPF6, but issues related to the composition's homogeneity should be addressed. Electrolytes that use ether-based solvents (e.g. DMC, DME, and diglyme) are reported to form more stable SEI layers with higher initial Coulombic efficiency than carbonate-based electrolytes (e.g. EC, DEC, and PC) due to their strong chemical adsorption and charge-transfer kinetics. Some binary or ternary solvent mixtures (e.g. KFSI–DME electrolyte), polymer electrolytes, and potassium ionic liquids could also promote the formation of stable SEI layers and suppress dendrite growth. In addition, the SEI layers formed with some electrolyte additives, such as FEC, could also prevent the side reactions and stay more stable to a certain extent.


6.4.2 Binders and separators. 
The electrode fabrication technology is a problem shared by all the alkali-metal ion batteries. One of the issues related explicitly to PIBs is the type of binder. The polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder, commonly used in LIBs, cannot sustain the large volumetric changes associated with the potassium ion insertion/stripping. As a result, exfoliating the key functional components away from the metal foil current collector is very common in PIBs, leading to fast capacity fading and poor electronic conductivity. Therefore, more studies focusing on exploring new binders with excellent elasticity are necessary to improve the electrodes’ mechanical integrity for practical PIBs. Further development of separators is also desirable to optimize their performances. Modifying the separators’ sides that face the anode or the cathode could be a viable approach to suppress the parasitic reactions and dendrite formation.

6.5 Battery safety
Although PIBs have shown lower susceptibility to thermal runaway and in general release less heat than LIBs, the safety of PIBs remains a problem due to the flammable organic electrolytes and low thermal stability SEI layers. Using thermally stable separators, polymer electrolytes, and solid-state electrolytes, and adding flame-retardants into the liquid electrolytes or electrode materials may improve battery safety. Theoretical and experimental studies should also be utilized to build an efficient kinetic model of the complex thermal runaway process, facilitating the unique structural design of high-safety PIBs.
In summary, PIB systems based on the abundant potassium resource have presented remarkable potential for large-scale energy storage. Although there are, to date, still enormous challenges before PIBs achieve commercial viability, it is believed that all these problems could be addressed in future studies. Therefore, outlining the present technologies and proposing possible perspectives of new batteries will help us better understand rechargeable PIB systems and promote faster progress towards their real applications in the future.

Broader context
The current limited and uneven distributions of lithium resources in the world, coupled with the rapid growth of electric vehicles and the dependence on renewable energy, have motivated the pursuit for efficient alternatives to commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Rechargeable potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are promising candidates due to the abundance of potassium resources, high operating voltage, and considerable theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, this battery system faces serious challenges for the requirements of commercialization, such as short cycle life, low rate performance, and limited practical capacities. To get closer toward the industrial utilization of PIBs, all the battery components should be carefully optimized and thoroughly studied. Here, the latest developments on PIBs are systematically reviewed, and innovative electrode designs are highlighted to inspire future research and development. The challenges and limitations of each electrode material are summarized alongside the reaction mechanisms and the electrode/electrolyte interaction. This review introduces new insights and an outlook, and suggests future directions and challenges, which can be used as a platform for further developing and optimizing PIBs, moving them forward to wider and large-scale applications.
