    , Accepted 29th June 2016First published on 29th June 2016AbstractMonodisperse ScF3 and NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals were prepared by a simple solvothermal method. There were many important factors including the molar ratio of Na/F/(Sc + Ln) and Ln3+ doping to control the synthesis of the products. A phase transformation from monoclinic ScF3 to hexagonal NaScF4 was observed with different molar ratios of Na/F/Sc. Herein, the products doped with 1% Ln3+ (La–Lu, except Pm) demonstrated abundant phases, morphologies and sizes. Moreover, the products with different Lu3+ doping concentrations from 1% to 60% were prepared. The results revealed that different kinds of 1% Ln3+ (La–Lu, except Pm) and diverse concentrations of Lu3+ can modify the phase, morphology and size of the prepared products. A possible formation mechanism for the products with diverse morphologies is proposed. In addition, Ln3+-doped ScF3 or NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals presented characteristic up/down-conversion fluorescence spectra.
1. Introduction
Controlled synthesis of nano-/micro-crystals with diverse phases, morphologies and dimensionality have attracted prodigious interest for their promising applications such as catalysis, luminescence, and biological monitoring.1–3 Among them, inorganic fluoride materials have more prominent advantages in optical applications because of their low phonon energy and high transparency which gives rise to a decrease in the nonradiative relaxation compared with other oxide or sulfide materials.4 Due to their unique properties, studies on sodium rare-earth fluorides including Y3+-/Ln3+-based fluorides (Ln = La–Lu) have lasted for several years.5–13 However, Sc-based fluorides have been overlooked, and only a few reports about Sc-based sodium fluorides have been investigated to date.14–21 It is well known that Sc has the smallest rare-earth ionic radius and unique electron configurations which result in distinct optical properties different from those of Y3+/Ln3+-based fluoride materials.22,23 Herein, ScF3:Yb/Er or NaScF4:Yb/Er nano-/micro-crystals, owing to the small radius of Sc3+, show different UC emission from that of YF3 or NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals, which are regarded as a powerful complement to the family of upconversion nanomaterials and have promising applications in PL areas, field emission display devices, bio-imaging and magnetic resonance imaging.14,24,25 Recently, Zhang's group synthesised novel NaScF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals, which exhibited intrinsic intense red upconversion emission via a facile one-step hydrothermal route.24 Huang's group used a thermal decomposition method to produce NaxScF3+x:Yb/Er upconversion nanocrystals by controlling the molar ratio of NaF/Ln3+.21 Chen's group have proved that NaScF4:Ln3+ NPs exhibit specific recognition of cancer cells overexpressed with uPA receptor (uPAR, an important marker of tumor biology and metastasis) after bioconjugation with the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), which showed great potential in tumor-targeted bioimaging.26 Most of the synthesis routes of the reports concerning Sc-based sodium fluorides are thermal decomposition methods. Compared with hydrothermal or solvothermal methods, the thermal decomposition method has many disadvantages including the use of environmentally harmful organic solvents, high reaction temperature, and the need of an inert atmosphere protection. Therefore, a hydrothermal or solvothermal method is a simple and convenient method to synthesize fluoride materials.
Doping is the incorporation of atoms or ions of a suitable element into a host matrix, which is an effective method to receive electronic, magnetic and optical properties of advanced functional materials.27 Among them, Ln3+ doping is regarded as a novel route to control the growth process of nano-/micro-materials and modify the phase, size, morphology, dimensionality, physical and chemical properties.28–35 In addition, doping is also believed to be a potential method to tailor the local environment of the host lattice and to promote the improvement of luminescence efficiency.36 Therefore, it is essential for Ln3+ doping to select suitable host materials. In general, a doping ion with a similar radius and the same valence contributes to inducing a host matrix. The reports about doping of homo-valence ions into UC/DC fluoride materials have been discussed over the past decade.28,30,37 Taking as an example of Ln3+-doped NaYF4, doping has a great influence on the growth process and gives simultaneous control over the crystallographic phase, morphology and luminescence properties of the final nanocrystals.28 Furthermore, this phenomenon could be expended to other lanthanide-doped fluoride materials which have a wide range of applications in luminescent biological labels and volumetric three-dimensional displays.8,38 To the best of our knowledge, except for NaYF4, NaYbF4 and EuF3, there is no report on Ln3+ ion doping influencing the morphology, size and phase of ScF3 and NaScF4 phosphors so far.
In this paper, we have prepared ScF3 and NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals via a one-step solvothermal method by altering experimental parameters both the molar ratio Na/F/Sc ratio and Ln3+ doping in the initial solution. Herein, we find that the products doped with different kinds of Ln3+ or diverse concentrations of Ln3+ can generate different phase, morphology and size. Furthermore, the detailed mechanism of Ln3+-doping inducing phase transition and the variation of size and morphology of NaScF4 was put forward for the first time. Simultaneously, the colourful UC/DC luminescence properties were investigated, and the photon UC potential for applications such as biological imaging, data storage, solar cells and so on.39
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Chemicals and materials
The lanthanide oxides Ln2O3 (99.99%, Ln = Sc, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu), Pr7O11, Tb4O7 and CeO2 were purchased from Chuandong Chemical Reagents Company (China). NH4F (99.9%), NaCl (99.9%), ethylene glycol (EG), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used directly without further purification. The aqueous solutions of the corresponding RECl3 were obtained by dissolving stoichiometric rare earth oxides in dilute HCl solution.
2.2. Synthesis
NaScF4 host and Ln3+ (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Sm, Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb and Lu) single doped and codoped NaScF4 crystals were prepared by a simple solvothermal method. Herein, we took the synthesis of NaScF4 as an example. In a typical procedure, 1 mmol EDTA, ScCl3 (1 M, 1000 μl) were dissolved in 30 ml EG solution and stirred for 30 min. Then, 5 mmol NaCl was added. After vigorous stirring at room temperature for another 30 min, 4 mmol NH4F was added and continually stirred until all the solids were dissolved. After that, the obtained colloid solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. When the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally, the obtained products were collected, further purified by ethanol and deionized water several times, and finally dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The products doped with different kinds of Ln3+ and different concentrations of Lu3+ were synthesized using the same method except that stoichiometric amounts of LnCl3 were added to the complex solution.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Purkinje General Instrument MSALXD3 using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The morphology analysis was carried out on a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic (EDS) was attached to the same FESEM. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The DC excitation and emission spectra were detected by an F-7000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as excitation source. The luminescence decays were measured on a FLSP920 fluorescence spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu R9287 photomultiplier (200–900 nm) equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled InGaAs (800–1700 nm) as the detectors. The UC emission spectra were recorded by a Perkin-Elmer LS55 spectrophotometer under the excitation of an unfocused 980 nm laser diode (LD) with a power density of 3 W cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase and morphology of the host
The XRD pattern of the prepared sample under the conditions of Na/F/Sc = 5:4:1 is shown in Fig. 1a. It shows that all of the characteristic diffraction peaks match well with the standard hexagonal phase NaScF4 (JCPDS Card No. 20-1152) and no impurity peaks were detected, which indicates that we have successfully prepared pure hexagonal phase NaScF4. Fig. 1b presents that the samples are uniform and dispersive. The inset of Fig. 1b is a high magnification SEM photograph. It demonstrates the morphology of the NaScF4 host is composed of nano-rods. We randomly choose 100 nano-rods to measure their average size which is 650 nm (length) and 300 nm (width).

3.1.1. The Na/Sc ratio. 
There are many experimental factors to control the synthesis of the host material. Herein, we first tried to change the mole ratio of Na/Sc and keep other conditions unchanged. Fig. 2a shows the XRD results of different Na/Sc ratio. Notably, when the Na/Sc ratio changes from 1 to 4, the phases are always the mixture phases of monoclinic ScF3 and hexagonal NaScF4. Therefore, we continued to improve the Na/Sc ratio, and the pure hexagonal NaScF4 phase is obtained when the Na/Sc ratio ≥5. The above results demonstrate that the Na/Sc ratio has an important effect on the formation of pure NaScF4 phase. It is reported that the impetus to producing NaScF4 was greater than ScF3, and improving the quantity of Na+ was in favor of the formation of NaScF4.24

3.1.2. The F/Sc ratio. 
Then, we altered the F/Sc ratio and maintained the other factors constant. As indicated in Fig. 2b, the pure monoclinic ScF3 phase (JCPDS Card No. 46-1243) was observed when the F/Sc ratio was 3, and it presents a cubic shape (1 μm) (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, on increasing the F/Sc ratio to 4 (Fig. 2b), the pure NaScF4 phase (JCPDS Card No. 20-1152) appears and the morphology is nano-rod with a length of 650 nm (Fig. 3c). However, it can be seen that there is a transition state which includes mixed phases of monoclinic ScF3 and hexagonal NaScF4 (Fig. 2b) and shows uniform cubes with a side length of 60 nm (Fig. 3b) when the F/Sc ratio is 3.5.

It has been reported that the transitions of phase and morphology are determined by the F− content.21 The nano-/micro-crystal growth begins with the nucleation process between F− and Sc-EDTA compounds. A high F/Sc ratio can be beneficial to the particle crystallization rate which is closely related to the thermodynamics reaction process. As a result, a thermodynamically stable phase hexagonal NaScF4 nanocrystals are obtained. As mentioned in the literature, the capping effect of F− has a significant impact on nano-/micro-crystals including changing the number of average dangling bonds, and transforming the chemical potential of crystal and crystal plane in the meantime, which results in different morphologies and sizes.40 To sum up, a high reaction rate can increase the number of nuclei and decrease the monomer concentration in the solution which accelerates the formation of nano-rods with a smaller size (Fig. 3c). On the contrary, a low F− concentration can induce a slow nucleation rate and further produce few nuclei and increase the monomer concentration. Thereby, the monoclinic ScF3 phase and its cubic morphology are formed (Fig. 3a).

3.2. Phase and morphology of the Ln3+-doped product

3.2.1. Na/F/(Sc + Ln) = 5:3:1. 
To investigate influences of different kinds and inequable concentrations of Ln3+ doping, we chose three kinds of rare earth irons (Ce3+, Eu3+ and Lu3+; belonging to the light, medium and heavy rare earth irons, respectively) as research objects, and transform their concentrations from low to high. When there is no Ln3+ doping, there is a monoclinic ScF3 phase with Na/F/Sc = 5:3:1 (Fig. 2b). However, with the enhancement of Ln3+ concentrations, a phase separation phenomenon starts to appear. For instance, there are mixed phases of ScF3 and CeF3 when the Ce3+ concentration is increased to 5% (Fig. 4a). Similarly, the concentration of phase separation of Eu3+ doping is 5% and coexisting phases consisting of ScF3 and EuF3 take shape, as indicated in Fig. 4b. The higher the Ln3+ (Ce3+, Eu3+) concentration, the stronger the intensity of LnF3 (Ce3+, Eu3+) peaks. Nevertheless, Na7Lu13F46 phase will not emerge until Lu3+ concentration reaches 30% and the intensity of Na7Lu13F46 peaks enhance gradually along with the increase of Lu3+ concentration. Obviously, the pure Na7Lu13F46 phase turns up and the monoclinic ScF3 phase disappears absolutely as the Lu3+ concentration is 70% (Fig. 4c). The relevant morphology is revealed in Fig. S1,† which is mainly composed of small spheres (60 nm).
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of samples with different concentrations of Ln3+ doping: (a) Ce3+, (b) Eu3+, and (c) Lu3+, respectively. 
As we all know, Ln3+ doping has an important effect on the phase and morphology of the host material,28 so we also inspect the morphology of identical ScF3 phase. In Fig. 5a, the morphology of ScF3:1% Ce3+ exhibits huge cubes (3 μm), which consists of small cubes. Its size is different from ScF3:1% Eu3+ including self-assembled cubes (2 μm) (Fig. 5b). In contrast to the first two types, the size of ScF3:20% Lu3+ is the smallest with a small cubic (900 nm) (Fig. 5c). As is shown in Fig. 3a, undoped ScF3 host reveals a cubic morphology with a side length of 1 μm. After doping 1% Ce3+, 1% Eu3+ and 20% Lu3+, we can find that monoclinic ScF3 phases have no changes whereas great changes have taken place in their morphology (size). When three kinds of rare ions (Ce3+, Eu3+ and Lu3+) substitute the Sc3+ sites of the ScF3 host lattice, respectively, the doping concentrations of the phase separation are distinct. Here, we suppose that the increase of Ln3+ doping concentration is equal to increasing the radius of doping ion. ScF3, as an important scandium-containing fluoride, can provide suitable Sc3+ sites which can be substituted by trivalent Ln3+ without any charge compensation. The radii of Ce3+, Eu3+ and Lu3+ reduce in turn while the scandium element has the smallest ionic radius of all the rare-earth elements. The Lu3+ radius is smallest, so its doping concentration (20%) of phase separation is higher than Ce3+ (5%) and Eu3+ (5%). Although the phases of samples doped with 1% Ce3+ and 1% Eu3+ are both monoclinic ScF3 phases, their morphologies are diverse because of their different radii (RCe3+ > REu3+) which results in the formation of about 3 μm cubes (Ce3+ doping) and 2 μm (Eu3+ doping) cubes.35 Detailed information of phases and morphologies of the products with different Ln3+ doping (Ln = Ce, Eu and Lu) are shown in Table S1.†

3.2.2. Na/F/(Sc + Ln) = 5:4:1. 
To demonstrate the mechanism of modifying the growth process of the host material by Ln3+ doping, products separately doped with 1% Ln3+ (Ln = La–Lu, except Pm) were also prepared. As is shown in Fig. 6, the prepared products separately doping with 1% Ln3+ (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) correspond to pure hexagonal NaScF4 phase, however, the products doped with 1% Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy) are attributed to pure monoclinic ScF3 phase.
 Fig. 6  XRD patterns of the prepared products separately doping with 1% Ln3+ (Ln = La–Lu, except Pm). 
Among the rare earth elements, we can divide these rare earth elements into three groups, light rare-earth elements (La–Sm), medium rare-earth elements (Eu–Dy) and heavy rare-earth elements (Ho–Lu), respectively. Obviously, both light rare-earth irons and heavy rare-earth ions promote the formation of hexagonal NaScF4 phase. Medium rare-earth ions accelerate to form monoclinic ScF3 phase. The radius of rare-earth irons is smaller and smaller with the increase of atomic number. The host material doped with Ln3+ possessing larger or smaller radius will lead to the formation of hexagonal NaScF4 phase, and yet, the monoclinic ScF3 phase comes into being when the Ln3+ with moderate radius is introduced into the host. The Ln3+ with a larger or a smaller radius has a lower energy barrier which contributes to the formation of hexagonal NaScF4 phase. With regard to moderate Ln3+ radius, because of the high electron charge density on the surface of the host lattice which hinders the diffusion of F−, it is easy to form the monoclinic ScF3 phase.26 In addition, lanthanide contraction has a significant effect on the lanthanide fluoride phase stability, which is related to the impact of cation size and polarizability.28,41
We also study the effect of 1% Ln3+ doping on the morphology of the prepared products, which is shown in Fig. 7. Herein, we just choose six kinds of rare earth elements (belonging to light, medium, and heavy groups, respectively) to introduce the samples. Interestingly, the product doped with 1% Ce3+ or 1% Pr3+ presents similar morphology which is four-angle star (about 2 μm) (Fig. 7a and b). The cubes about 50 nm on a side (Fig. 7c and d) can be detected in the products doped with1% Gd3+ or 1% Tb3+, which match well with monoclinic ScF3 phase (Fig. 6). Fig. 7e and f show micro-rod-like shapes with a length of 2.5 μm and a diameter of 500 nm. Table S2† shows the summary of phases, morphologies and sizes of the products separately doped with different 1% Ln3+ ions. The detailed reason why the products doped with 1% Ln3+ have diverse morphologies will be stated in the latter part (Fig. 11). The TEM images of the obtained products doped with 1% Pr3+, 1% Tb3+ and 1% Lu3+ demonstrate four-angle star-shaped (Fig. 8a), cubic (Fig. 8b) and micro-rod-like (Fig. 8c) morphologies, respectively, which are consistent with the SEM images (Fig. 7b, d and f). The formation of these three kinds of morphologies depend on the growth rates of diverse crystal planes at different growth stages.42Fig. 8d shows the HRTEM image of ScF3:1% Tb3+. The lattice fringes are clearly visible, which confirms the high crystallinity of the ScF3:1% Tb3+ nano-cube. The inter-planar spacing is 0.405 nm corresponding to the (100) planes of ScF3, which agrees well with the d (100) spacing of the literature value (JCPDS Card No. 46-1243).

Furthermore, the products with different Lu3+ doping concentrations were synthesized to elucidate the effects of Lu3+ concentrations on the crystal phase, morphology and size. The summary of detailed formation about the changes of phases, shapes and sizes with different Lu3+ doping concentrations is shown in Table S3.† As shown in Fig. 9a, the sample without Lu3+ doping is pure hexagonal NaScF4 phase. With the introduction of 1% and 8% Lu3+, the samples are also pure hexagonal NaScF4 phase, which indicates that low Lu3+ doping concentrations have few effects on the phases of the products (Fig. 9b and c). Interestingly, phase separation phenomenon can be observed along with the formation of the monoclinic ScF3 phase, and the mixed phase including hexagonal NaScF4 phase and monoclinic ScF3 phase can be detected when the Lu3+ doping concentration reaches 15% (Fig. 9d). With increasing the Lu3+ doping concentration to 30% (Fig. 9e), hexagonal NaScF4 phase dramatically disappears while a new phase orthorhombic Na7Lu13F46 arises, which leads to the formation of the mixed phase containing monoclinic ScF3 phase and orthorhombic Na7Lu13F46 phase. Finally, it's worth noting that the pure orthorhombic Na7Lu13F46 phase is achieved by increasing the Lu3+ doping concentration up to 60% (Fig. 9f), which denotes that Lu3+ completely replaces Sc3+ in the host lattice. It can be seen that the diffraction peaks have obvious left shift trends, which demonstrate that the appearance of a larger Lu3+ to substitute a smaller Sc3+ promotes the increase of unit-cell volume.43 Apparently, with the increase of the Lu3+ concentration from 15% to 60%, the diffraction peaks gradually broaden, which indicates that the average crystalline size decreases when the Lu3+ concentration increases. The SEM results of Fig. 10d–g just prove this point. In addition, we also prepared the products in the presence of 60% La3+ or 60% Gd3+, and the obtained products are LaF3 and GdF3 phase, respectively (Fig. S2†).
 Fig. 9  XRD patterns of the products doped with different concentrations of Lu3+: (a) 0% Lu3+, (b) 1% Lu3+, (c) 8% Lu3+, (d) 15% Lu3+, (e) 30% Lu3+, and (f) 60% Lu3+, respectively. 
 Fig. 10  SEM images of the products doped with different concentrations of Lu3+: (a) 0% Lu3+, (b) 1% Lu3+, (c) 8% Lu3+, (d, e) 15% Lu3+, (f, g) 30% Lu3+, (h) 60% Lu3+, respectively. 
Clearly, when transforming the Lu3+ doping concentrations of the products from 0% to 60%, the phase transitions from hexagonal NaScF4 phase to monoclinic ScF3 phase to orthorhombic Na7Lu13F46 phase can be detected. According to the literature,44 there might be two kinds of impure doping methods for homo-valence ions doping: one is replacing the host ions with large or small radius homo-valence ions, which results in the expansion or extraction of the host lattice; the other is the impure ions are introduced to interstitial positions of the host lattice. As mentioned above (Fig. 6), the host material doped with Ln3+ possessing a larger or smaller radius leads to the formation of the hexagonal NaScF4 phase, and yet, the monoclinic ScF3 phase comes into being when the Ln3+ ion with a moderate radius is introduced into the product. Similarly, we also suppose that the increase of Lu3+ doping concentration is equal to increasing the radius of the doping ion. In this experiment, 8% Lu3+ and 15% Lu3+ are similar to the smaller and moderate Ln3+ radius, respectively. So 8% Lu3+ forms the hexagonal NaScF4 phase and 15% Lu3+ forms the mixed phases including the hexagonal NaScF4 phase and the monoclinic ScF3 phase. However, with further increase in the Lu3+ doping concentration to 30% or 60%, Lu3+ begins to occupy the Sc3+ location in the host lattice. Therefore, the orthorhombic Na7Lu13F46 phase appears. In addition, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations,28 Na7Lu13F46 is more energetically stable than NaScF4.
Additionally, Lu3+ doping also results in morphological changes with increase in the Lu3+ doping concentration. Fig. 10 demonstrates SEM images of diverse concentrations of Lu3+ (Lu = 0%, 1%, 8%, 15%, 30% and 60%). As already stated, the product doped with 1% Lu3+ presents micro-rods (l × w = 2.5 μm × 500 nm), which is similar to the morphology of products with no Lu3+ doping except for the size of the rods (Fig. 10a and b). Remarkably, the size of the rod with doping 1% Lu3+ is larger than that with no Lu3+ doping. When doping 8% Lu3+, the product shows a shuttle (1.5 μm) (Fig. 10c) which is uniform and monodisperse. Fig. 10d and e indicate the formation of mixed shuttles (2.5 μm) and wafers (260 nm), which is in accordance with the XRD results (Fig. 9d). With further increases in the Lu3+ concentration to 30%, it reveals that the shuttle changes into a zonal body (2.5 μm) and a number of wafer augments (Fig. 10f and g). Interestingly, homogeneous nano-spheres (60 nm) appear when doped with 60% Lu3+ (Fig. 10h).

3.3. Crystal growth and morphology transformation mechanism
The possible formation mechanism for the products with diverse morphologies is stated in Fig. 11. In general, the growth process of crystals can be divided into two steps: one is the original nucleation process; the other is the succeeding crystal growth process. In the initial stage of the reaction, the oleic phase including EG, EDTA and the aqueous phase containing water, F−, Na+, Sc3+ are formed in the reaction system of water–oleic mixing phases. When the temperature reaches 200 °C, Na+ and Sc3+ rapidly combine with F− to form rare-earth fluoride-based crystalline nuclei. With increasing reaction time, rare-earth fluoride-based nuclei grow quickly, leading to F− diffusion from the solution phase to the surface of the nuclei. As is known, Ln3+ doping has an important effect on the formation of rare-earth fluoride-based crystals with diverse morphologies. In our work, when Sc3+ ions in the NaScF4 host lattice are substituted by Ln3+ ions of a larger radius, the increase of surface electron charge density can reduce the diffusion rate of F− towards the surface of the rare-earth fluoride crystal nuclei due to the increase of charge repulsion power.26 Both these different kinds of Ln3+ and the diverse content of Lu3+ give rise to various diffusion rates of F−. The chemical potential of the crystal facet changes with the number of F− on the crystal surface, and the corresponding growth rates in different directions transform, which finally result in a variety of crystal morphologies.45 Therefore, rare-earth fluoride-based crystals with different kinds of Ln3+ doping and diverse Lu3+ doping concentration exhibits abundant morphologies.

3.4. Luminescence properties

3.4.1. Downconversion fluorescence spectra. 
In our experiment, we prepared a series of products doped with different kinds of Ln3+ to research their DC luminescent properties, including ScF3:5% Eu3+ (Fig. 4b) and NaScF4:1% Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Er, Sm) (Fig. 6). Here, the sample of ScF3:5% Eu3+ is prepared under the conditions of Na/F/(Sc + Ln) = 5:3:1, and NaScF4:1% Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Er, Sm) is Na/F/(Sc + Ln) = 5:4:1.
The PL excitation and emission spectra for the as-prepared ScF3:5% Eu3+ products are shown in Fig. 12. In the excitation spectrum of ScF3:5% Eu3+, it includes the characteristic excitation peaks of Eu3+ within the 4f6 configuration from 200 to 550 nm. Generally speaking, the primary excitation peaks can be considered as the transitions from the ground state 7F0 to the other excited states: 5H6 (318 nm), 5G2 (381 nm), 5L6 (394 nm, strongest), and 5D2 (466 nm), respectively. In addition, there are some weak peaks located at 298 and 361 nm, which have little effect on the excitation of Eu3+ and are of secondary significance.46 Meanwhile, the charge transfer band of Eu3+–F− which usually locates below 200 nm cannot be found in the excitation spectrum, because it needs a lot of energy to remove an electron from F− instead of O2−.47 Taking 394 nm as the excitation wavelength where there is the strongest 7F0 → 5L6 transition of Eu3+, we obtained the emission spectrum (Fig. 12) which includes two emission lines of Eu3+ from 5D0 level to 7F1, two levels, namely, 594 nm, 5D0 → 7F1; 618 nm, 5D0 → 7F2. It is worth noting that the transition of 5D0 → 7F1 at 594 nm is dominant. To the best of our knowledge, the relative intensity of the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions is determined by the symmetry of the crystal sites where Eu3+ is situated. Supposing that Eu3+ is situated in a site with inversion symmetry, then the 5D0 → 7F1 transition plays a dominant role, rather than the 5D0 → 7F2 transition.48 In this experiment, it can be proved Eu3+ is situated in a site with inversion symmetry.

Fig. 13a shows the excitation (λem = 367 nm, left) and emission (λex = 288 nm, right) spectra of the NaScF4:1% Ce3+ micro-crystal. The excitation spectrum exhibited a broad band ranging from 200 to 320 nm with a maximum at 288 nm and two shoulder bands monitored with an emission wavelength of 367 nm. Upon excitation at 288 nm, the maximum of the emission peaks are located at 367 nm between 300 and 450 nm, which can be attributed to a 5d → 4f transition of Ce3+. In order to explore the energy structure of the Ce3+ 5d and 4f levels in NaScF4:1% Ce3+, the Gaussian fitting bands of the excitation spectrum for NaScF4:1% Ce3+ sample were analyzed (Fig. S4†). It can be seen that the excitation spectrum includes three broad bands with maxima at about 224 nm, 260 nm and 288 nm, which may be attributed to the transitions from the ground state 2F5/2 of Ce3+ to the excited 5d states of Ce3+ through crystal field splitting.49 On the basis of symmetrical shape, the emission band with a maximum at 367 nm can be assigned as the transitions from the lowest Ce3+ 5d excited state to the 2F5/2 of the Ce3+ 4f configuration.

The excitation and emission spectra of the prepared NaScF4:1% Er3+ sample is presented in Fig. 13b. The excitation spectrum by monitoring the emission of Er3+ 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition at 552 nm consists of two main peaks at 378 and 488 nm which can be attributed to Er3+ transitions of 4I15/2 → 4G11/2 and 4I15/2 → 4F7/2, respectively, and three weak peaks at 254, 406 and 451 nm. When λex = 378 nm, the achieved emission spectrum has strong peaks at 552 nm corresponding to the Er3+ transition of 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and a weak peak at 525 nm (2H11/2 → 4I15/2). Therefore, the NaScF4:1% Er3+ sample presents an intense green light under excitation of 378 nm UV light.

Fig. 13c reveals the excitation and emission spectra of the prepared NaScF4:1% Sm3+ sample. Monitored with an emission wavelength of 603 nm, the excitation spectrum contains two main emission lines at 401 nm (strongest), 470 nm and some weak lines. The emission peaks at 566 nm, 603 nm (strongest) and 649 nm are assigned to the characteristic transitions of Sm3+: 4G5/2 → 6H5/2, 4G5/2 → 6H7/2 and 4G5/2 → 6H9/2, respectively.
To better illustrate the effects of lanthanide doping on the optical properties of the samples, a series of decay curves for the luminescence of ScF3:5% Eu3+ and NaScF4:1% Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Er, Sm) were measured, as shown in Fig. 14. After calculating, the fluorescence lifetimes of ScF3:5% Eu3+, NaScF4:1% Ce3+, NaScF4:1% Er3+ and NaScF4:1% Sm3+ are 1.75 ms, 36.81 ns, 0.28 ms and 1.46 ms, respectively. As is known, the number of luminescent centers, defects, and impurities in a host determine the decay curve.50 In the ScF3 or NaScF4:Ln3+ nano-/micro-crystals, Ln3+ (Ln = Eu, Ce, Er, Sm) substitute the Sc3+ sites, which results in the introduction of different impurities, the production of different defects and quenching centers, so different decay curves are observed.

3.4.2. Upconversion fluorescence spectra. 
The product of ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+ was also synthesized under the condition of Na/F/(Sc + Ln) = 5:4:1 to explore its UC luminescent property.

Fig. 15 shows the UC luminescence spectrum of the as-prepared ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+ under 980 nm excitation. There are four characteristic emission peaks at 410, 525, 541 and 654 nm. The spectral peak at 410 nm can be assigned to the 2H9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+. The dominant red emission at 654 nm and green emissions at 525 and 541 nm can be attributed to 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively.51,52 Also, deserving a mention, the red emission band at 635–675 nm is much stronger than the green emission band at 510–560 nm, and it produces intense red UC emission. As is known, Sc3+ has a small radius (0.83 Å), which leads to the structural uniqueness of Sc-based fluoride materials. A short Sc3+–Sc3+ distance can result in a short doping distance between Yb3+ and Er3+ which can reinforce the cross-relaxation (4F7/2 + 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 + 4F9/2) and diminish the population on 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+. Meanwhile, the population on the 4F9/2 energy level of Er3+ can be enhanced. Therefore, the red UC is stronger than the green UC.14,21,24 In addition, the UC energy transfer mechanisms of ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+ excited by a 980 nm laser is showed in Fig. S5.† The PL decay of ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+ was measured upon excitation at 980 nm, by monitoring the emissions of Er3+ at 654 and 525 nm, respectively (Fig. 16). It can be seen that the PL lifetime of Er3+ by monitoring the emission at 654 nm is determined to be 0.081 ms which is much longer than that at 525 nm (0.017 ms). It also proves that the red UC is stronger than the green UC in the product of ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+.

4. Conclusions
In summary, monodisperse ScF3 and NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals have been prepared via a simple solvothermal method. We altered the reaction conditions including the ratio of Na/F/Sc and Ln3+ doping. The phase, morphology and size of ScF3 or NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals were manipulated by doping with different kinds of Ln3+ or diverse concentrations of Ln3+. The products doped with 1% Ln3+ (Ln = La–Lu, except Pm) can generate two types of phases: hexagonal NaScF4 phase and monoclinic ScF3 phase. In addition, different concentrations (0–60%) of Lu3+ doping also modified the phase, morphology and size of the products. The prepared products consisting of ScF3:5% Eu3+, NaScF4:1% Ln3+ (Ln = Ce, Er, Sm) and ScF3:30% Yb3+/1% Er3+ displayed ample luminescent properties showing that the ScF3 and NaScF4 nano-/micro-crystals are promising candidates for lighting and display applications.
