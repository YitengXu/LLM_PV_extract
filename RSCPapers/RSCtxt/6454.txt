    , Accepted 17th March 2015First published on 17th March 2015AbstractA novel benzodithiophene-substituted benzodithiophene (crossed-BDT) with an enlarged conjugated skeleton was designed and synthesized as an electron-rich unit for the construction of donor–acceptor copolymers. Different acceptors, including 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT) were used as electron-deficient units for the target copolymers to investigate the effect of the inclusion of two fluorine atoms on the acceptor unit of the polymer. The crossed-BDT and DTBT based polymers show high open circuit voltages (Voc) of over 0.9 V with the decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.74%. The crossed-BDT and DTffBT based polymers show nearly 1 V (0.95 V) Voc due to the fluorine induced low-lying HOMO energy level. The 0.9–0.95 V is an impressive Voc result for a 1.7 eV band gap (Eg) polymer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about a crossed conjugated benzodithiophene building block design, and this building block is effective in improving the Voc of low band gap DBT polymers.
1. Introduction
Recently there has been an increasing interest in the development of polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to the potential for the fabrication of light-weight, large-area, and flexible light-harvesting devices through low-cost solution processing.1–5 In recent years, tremendous progress has been made in the field of PSCs, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has exceeded 10%.6 One of the key components of PSCs is the active layer, which determines the solar light harvest and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device. Because fullerenes possess excellent isotropic electron-transporting properties and a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level that facilitates exciton separation, they have been frequently used as electron acceptors in PSCs.7–11 Therefore, new donor polymers should be designed to match the LUMO energy levels of the fullerene derivatives.12–16 In this regard, donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers have been widely designed and synthesized due to their low band gaps and efficient optical absorption.17,18 However, the acceptor units, generally introduced in D–A copolymers, will influence the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level evidently and then influence the Voc of PSCs devices. Therefore, researchers concentrate on the design and synthesis of materials with low-lying HOMO levels. For some reported highly efficient materials, which do not exhibit very low-lying HOMO levels, researchers could use many methods to optimize their short circuit current density (Jsc), including using the additive DIO3,13 and thermal treatment.19,20 However, there are relatively less methods to improve the Voc of PSCs based on this type of donor material.
Among the reported efficient low band gap polymers, benzodithiophene (BDT) based copolymers have attracted interest as electron donors in the PSCs field due to its rigidity, coplanarity by fusing a benzene with two flanking thiophene units, high hole mobility and highly conjugated structures.21–24 Recently, many BDT copolymers with different conjugated units showed promising photovoltaic properties with high PCEs of more than 8%.25–28 As structural modifications on BDT, two dimensional (2-D) conjugated structures have been used to enhance intermolecular π–π interactions, which can be beneficial in improving the photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers.29–33 For example, the replacement of the alkoxy moiety by an alkylthienyl has been used to improve the photovoltaic properties of BDT-based polymers.31,32 However, some well-known efficient BDT-based polymers did not exhibit high enough Voc, such as the polymers using BDT as the donor units and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as the acceptor units, which show the Voc of 0.6–0.82 V.34–39 As we know, attaching fluorine (F) atoms to the conjugated backbone is an available approach to improve the Voc and as a result, the Voc of polymers could be improved (0.76–0.90 V).40–42 In addition, the introduction of large side groups into the BDT unit is another strategy to improve the Voc.43,44 In the middle of 2012, Stefan et al. reported the bithiophene-substituted BDT unit with extended conjugated side groups, which could be used as a donor and it exhibited a high Voc of around 1 V.44 Recently, our group also considered this strategy to improve the Voc, which could make the Voc reach up to 0.8–0.91 V in BDT and DTBT backboned polymers.45–47 In summary, with years of effort, polymers based on the BDT donor unit and DTBT acceptor unit finally showed the Voc of 0.6–0.91 V.
In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel benzodithiophene-substituted benzodithiophene (crossed-BDT) as a donor building block for D–A low band gap DBT polymers. Two crossed-BDT based copolymers (Scheme 1) with two different acceptor units, 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTffBT), were synthesized by Stille polycondensation. As a result, the polymers show the Voc of 0.9–0.95 V, which was very high for the same backbone polymers reported in the literature, whereas the PCE of the polymers were relatively decent. Thus, we believe that the crossed-BDT building block is an excellent donor unit which could availably improve the Voc of BDT-based polymers with low band gaps and high efficiency. This will help researchers to design more efficient novel BDT materials with low band gaps and high Voc.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The synthetic routes of the crossed-BDT monomer and its corresponding polymers are outlined in Scheme 2. The key intermediate, 2-ethylhexyl-4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (2), was prepared using a Grignard reagent, which shows a higher yield than the n-BuLi based method. This is also the first example demonstrating that an alkyl chain can be successfully connected to the 2-position of the BDT unit. The copolymers were obtained through Stille-coupling polymerization using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as catalysts. The structures of the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The two copolymers were dissolved in hot chloroform. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as the eluent and polystyrenes as the internal standards, and the results are listed in Table 1. The Mn of PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT are 22.9 K and 26.5 K, respectively.

2.2. Thermal analysis
The thermal properties of the polymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown Fig. 1. The DSC thermogram did not show evident glass transitions for the PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT polymers under the test conditions. The TGA analysis reveals that the onset temperatures with 5% weight-loss (Td) of PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT are 336 °C and 338 °C, respectively. This indicates that the thermal stability of the polymers is good enough for PSC applications.

2.3. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT in chloroform solution and in a thin film are shown in Fig. 2, respectively, and the corresponding absorption properties are summarized in Table 2. Both polymers display relatively similar absorption curves with two absorption bands observed commonly from D–A conjugated copolymers. A π–π* transition feature is observed at around 360 nm. The main absorption peaks are located at about 627 nm and 612 nm in chloroform solution for PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, respectively, which are attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer interaction in D–A systems. However, in the thin film, the absorption spectra peaked at about 640 and 624 nm for PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, respectively. Both polymers exhibit a red-shift in the absorption maximum and onset, which is attributed to solid state packing effects, planarizing the polymer backbone. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) of PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT were estimated to be 1.69 eV and 1.77 eV according to Eoptg = 1240/λ.

2.4. Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to determine the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the conjugated polymers.48Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) properties of the polymers. A three electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode were used. The potentials were internally calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is found to be 0.43 V vs. SCE. According to the empirical equation,HOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) (eV)LUMO = −(Ere + 4.4) (eV)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT. 
The results of the electrochemical properties are listed in Table 2. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PCBDT-DTBT were −5.26 eV and −3.53 eV and those of PCBDT-DTffBT were −5.34 eV and −3.60 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels are higher than that of the PC61BM acceptor (−3.9 eV) to ensure energetically favorable electron transfer. It should be noted that the HOMO energy of the fluorinated polymer, PCBDT-DTffBT (−5.34 eV), is lower than that of the corresponding non-fluorinated polymer, PCBDT-DTBT (−5.26 eV), due to the two electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms on the BT units. These two polymers show deep HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV), which are desirable for good stability in air and a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs. The electrochemical band gaps (Ecvg) were also calculated to be 1.73 eV and 1.74 eV for PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, respectively, which agree well with the Eoptg (Table 2).
2.5. Quantum mechanical calculations
The electron density of states distribution of these two polymers was calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) method. All DFT calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 (A.02) employing the hybrid B3LYP exchange–correlation functional with a split valence 6-31G* basis set. One repeating D–A unit, as illustrated in Fig. 4, was used for computational simplicity. 2-Ethylhexyl side chains were also truncated to methyl groups as their replacement with shorter chains can effectively reduce the calculation time. Both polymers have a delocalized HOMO, which is equally distributed over both the donor and acceptor parts of the molecule. However, the LUMO is significantly more localized on the acceptors units. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels are depicted in Table 2. Both the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of PCBDT-DTffBT were slightly lower than those of PCBDT-DTBT. The simulated data from the DFT calculations was generally in agreement with the experimental results estimated from the cyclic voltammograms.

2.6. Photovoltaic properties
Bulk heterojunction PSC devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC61BM/Ca/Al were fabricated by the solution processing method as in our previous work.49–51 The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 5. Due to their limited solubility, these two polymers blended with the acceptor PC61BM in chloroform solution were heated at 90 °C for 2 h before they were spin-coated as the active layer. The weight ratios of PCBDT-DTBT and PBDT-DTffBT to PC61BM varied from 1:1 to 1:3 for device optimization. Table 3 summarizes the detailed device performances. The blend ratio of 1:2 was found to give the best results for both polymers. PC71BM were also used as an acceptor with the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM (1:2)/Ca/Al to optimize the performance of device. However, the photovoltaic properties of the devices did not improve. Finally, the best solar cells based on PCBDT-DTBT showed a PCE of 3.74% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 7.54 mA cm−2, and an FF of 54.56% and PCBDT-DTffBT showed a PCE of 1.14% with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 2.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 46.13% under the same conditions. It was noted that these two polymers give high Voc PSC devices due to their lower-lying HOMO energy level, which agree well with our expectations. Side substituted groups could affect the Voc of the polymer solar cells. In particular, bulky conjugated side groups will lower the HOMO levels of polymers to improve the Voc, as the Voc is related to the energy difference between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor.43,44 Unfortunately, the PCEs of the two polymers were moderate, which was attributed to their poor solubility. Furthermore, the large side groups connected to the crossed-BDT units could affect the intermolecular packing to cause the low Jsc. This could be another reason for the unsatisfactory PCEs. On the other hand, compared to PCBDT-DTBT, PBDT-DTffBT showed an increased Voc by fluorination, which was in conformity with previous reports.40–42

For polymers PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, their detailed photovoltaic performances were compared with those of polymers which have the same backbone structure but do not have the bulky BDT side group (PBDTODO-DTBT,36 PBDTTHO-DTBT,39 PBDTBN-DTEHffBT40 and PBDTTEH-DTEHffBT42). The detailed optical-electronic properties and PSC device performances are listed in Table 4. As a result, our bulky BDT side group helps to achieve a high Voc. The PCBDT-DTBT polymer shows a higher Voc than those of PBDTODO-DTBT with typically a 1-D alkoxy side chain and PBDTTHO-DTBT with typically a 2-D alkylthienyl side group, by 26% and 34%, respectively. Similarly, compared with 1-D PBDTBN-DTEHffBT and 2-D PBDTTEH-DTEHffBT, the PCBDT-DTffBT polymer also shows a higher Voc. To highlight the high Voc feature of devices, researchers define the donor photon energy loss as Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the optical band gap of the donor polymer and Voc is obtained from the corresponding device with either PC61BM or PC71BM.51,52 As shown in Table 4, PCBDT-DTBT shows almost the same Eg with PBDTODO-DTBT and PBDTTHO-DTBT, but considerably lower Eg − eVoc. Compared with PBDTBN-DTEHffBT, PCBDT-DTffBT shows a similar Eg and Eg − eVoc, but considerably lower Eg − eVoc than PBDTTEH-DTEHffBT. In conclusion, the bulky BDT side group helps to improve the Voc of PSCs devices.

To verify the accuracy of the J–V measurements, the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the devices were measured and are shown in Fig. 6. Both polymers exhibited broadened absorption from 350–800 nm. The EQE value of PCBDT-DTBT is higher than that of PCBDT-DTffBT in the entire spectra and the maximum value reaches 46%. This indicates that PCBDT-DTBT has considerably better photo response among the absorption range. The calculated current densities from the EQE measurement were 7.22 mA cm−2 and 2.56 mA cm−2 for PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, respectively, which agree well with the Jsc (7.54 mA cm−2 for PCBDT-DTBT and 2.62 mA cm−2 for PCBDT-DTffBT) obtained from the J–V measurements.

In addition to the absorption and energy levels, charge carrier mobility is another crucial factor for achieving high-efficiency devices. The hole mobilities of the two polymers were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method53 with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC61BM/Au. As shown in Fig. 7, the hole mobilities are calculated to be 1.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.93 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCBDT-DTBT and PCBDT-DTffBT, respectively. The SCLC results show that the hole mobility of PCBDT-DTBT is higher than that of PCBDT-DTffBT. This could be a potential reason for the fact that PCBDT-DTBT:PC61BM based devices exhibit larger Jsc and FF than PCBDT-DTffBT:PC61BM based devices.

2.7. Morphological Characterization
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology of the two polymers: PC61BM blend films. The height images and phase images of the blends are shown in Fig. 8. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the PCBDT-DTBT and PC61BM blend films was 1.84 nm. Compared with PCBDT-DTBT, the blend films of PCBDT-DTffBT and PC61BM showed a lower surface roughness with an RMS of 0.78 nm, which indicated that PCBDT-DTffBT showed better compatibility with PC61BM.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a novel highly-conjugated crossed benzodithiophene (crossed-BDT) as an electron-rich unit for the construction of two donor–acceptor copolymers. The BT unit, as an acceptor, was also modified with non-fluorinated and fluorinated moieties. A decrease in the HOMO level and a net blue-shifted absorption of the fluorinated polymer compared with the non-fluorinated polymer is observed. These two copolymers with a crossed-BDT structure in their backbone showed the desired deep HOMO energy levels. The crossed-BDT donor can markedly improve the Voc of polymers with the DTBT backbone, which show the Voc of 0.9–0.95 V. Therefore, this will provide some reference to improve the Voc of low band gap BDT material based PSC devices. To improve the PCE, further work on making long branched alkyl substituted polymers with the same backbone is underway.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials
All starting reagents were obtained commercially as analytical reagents and were used directly without any purification. Toluene, ether and THF were purified by vacuum distillation under nitrogen prior to use. 4,8-Bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 4,7-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole were synthesized as reported in the literature.54–56
4.2. Instruments and measurements
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE-III 600 spectrometer. High resolution mass spectra (MS) were recorded under APCI mode using a Bruker Maxis UHRTOF spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed using a STA-409 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. The polymer films on quartz, which were used for absorption spectral measurement, were prepared by spin-coating from their chloroform solutions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Tetrabutylammonium phosphorus hexafluoride (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) in acetonitrile was used as the supporting electrolyte. Surface morphological characterizations of the films were done by a tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM, Agilent 5400). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance.
4.3. Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on pre-patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates with a layered structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm). The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath in acetone, toluene, methanol and isopropyl alcohol, sequentially. Then, they were oxygen plasma treated for 20 min, spin-coated with PEDOT:PSS at 5000 rpm, and dried under argon for 20 min at 120 °C. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated from different blend weight ratios of donor (12 mg mL−1) and PC61BM in a deoxygenated anhydrous chloroform solution on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. The active layer thickness was about 100 nm, which was measured by a Dektak 150 profilometer. Finally, Ca (10 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) were thermally evaporated at a vacuum of ∼2 × 10−4 Pa on top of the active layer. The active area of the solar cell devices was 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.

4.4.1. Synthesis of 2-bromo-4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (1). 
In a 500 ml flask, 4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (17.87 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (200 ml). Bromine (6.39 g, 40 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (80 ml) in a separatory funnel and slowly dropped into the flask under an ice-water bath. After stirring under dark conditions at room temperature for 3.5 h, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by silica column chromatography with petroleum ether–dichloromethane (8/1, v/v) to give compound 1 as a pale yellow oil (9.04 g, 43%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.43 (s, 1H), 7.41 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 7.33 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 4.14–4.07 (m, 4H), 1.80–1.72 (m, 2H), 1.69–1.33 (m, 16H), 1.02–0.97 (m, 6H), 0.96–0.91 (m, 6H).


4.4.2. Synthesis of 2-ethylhexyl-4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (2). 
A stirred mixture of Mg (1.31 g, 54 mmol) and I2 (0.13 g, 0.5 mmol) in 25 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether was heated to reflux for 3 min under argon, and then 2-ethylhexyl bromide (9.27 g, 48 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (35 mL) was added dropwise. The solution was refluxed for 3 h and cooled to room temperature. The prepared 2-ethylhexylmagnesium bromide solution was added dropwise to an ice-cooled mixture of compound 1 (8.41 g, 16 mmol) and Ni(dppp)Cl2 (0.087 g, 0.16 mmol) in anhydrous diethyl ether (80 ml), which was continuously stirred. The cooling bath was removed and the mixture was heated to reflux, stirred overnight and quenched with an ammonium chloride saturated solution (60 mL). The organic and inorganic parts were separated and the aqueous part was extracted with diethyl ether. The combined organic parts were washed with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by silica column chromatography with petroleum ether–dichloromethane (10/1, v/v) to give compound 2 as a clear oil (2.86 g, 32%).1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.44 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 7.31 (d, J = 5.4 Hz, 1H), 7.10 (s, 1H), 4.18–4.11 (m, 4H), 2.84 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.82–1.76 (m, 2H), 1.74–1.25 (m, 25H), 1.03–0.99 (m, 6H), 0.96–0.83 (m, 12H).


4.4.3. Synthesis of crossed-BDT. 

n-BuLi (3.62 ml, 5.8 mmol, 1.6 M in hexane) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 2 (2.63 g, 4.7 mmol) in THF (15 ml) at 0 °C under argon. The reactant mixture was heated up to 50 °C for 2 h. After which, 4,8-dehydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (0.44 g, 2 mmol) was added, and the mixture was kept at 50 °C for 3 h. After the mixture was cooled down to room temperature, SnCl2·2H2O (3.61 g, 16 mmol) in 8 mL HCl (10%) was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 3 h. The mixture was poured into ice water and extracted by petroleum ether. The combined extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by silica column chromatography with petroleum ether–dichloromethane (8/1, v/v) to give crossed-BDT as a yellow solid (1.46 g, 56%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 7.86 (s, 2H), 7.77 (d, J = 6.0, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 5.4, 2H), 7.16 (s, 2H), 4.27–4.20 (m, 8H), 2.88 (d, J = 6.6 Hz, 4H), 1.85–1.79 (m, 4H), 1.76–1.27 (m, 50H), 1.04–0.98 (m, 12H), 0.97–0.86 (m, 24H).
