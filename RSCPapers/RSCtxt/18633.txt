    , Accepted 18th February 2019First published on 21st February 2019AbstractAn improved performance of inverted planar perovskite solar cells is achieved by inclusion of ammonium acid iodide (AAI) derivatives into a perovskite precursor solution. The perovskite's morphology improved upon addition of AAI derivatives, and device parameters showed a strong dependence on the increasing number of methylene units. Enhancement in solar cell efficiency in proportion to the number of methylene units present in AAI derivatives showed a promising development in perovskite photovoltaics.
Organometal trihalide perovskites with a chemical structure of ABX3 (A is the organic cation, B is the metal cation, and X denotes the halide anion) have been the most extensively investigated materials since the first perovskite based solar cell was reported.1 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has significantly increased over 20% in the last three years.2–5 Moreover, the effective improvements in the device stability have been documented by optimizing the perovskite layer, device architecture and compatibility of the interface materials.6–8 A variety of strategies have been deployed to control the properties of perovskite films by means of using different deposition routes, precursors, solvents, processing temperatures, environments, etc.9,10 Compositional change and control over perovskite phase transformation processes have resulted in tremendous improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite layer and hence in the device performance.11–15 For example, a chlorine containing perovskite system exhibits improved conductivity and charge diffusion length.16,17 Similarly, lead halide perovskites with mixed cations (formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA)) showed improved efficiency and device durability due to their stabilized perovskite structure with uniform grain size distribution.18 Recently, use of additives in the perovskite layer has been considered as an effective way to improve the quality of the perovskite film.19–25 The main purpose of using additives is to manipulate the crystallization kinetics by creating heterogeneous nucleation sites to support the uniform crystal growth of the perovskite with full coverage. In this regard, various types of additives such as solvent additives, polymer additives, ionic-liquid additives and ammonium salts have been used. Zuo et al.19 incorporated polymers with different functional groups into the perovskite layer to improve the device efficiency and stability. Wu et al.20 reported a certified efficiency of 19.19% in a device area of 1.025 cm2 by using an ionic-liquid additive of methylammonium acetate (MAAc) and a molecular additive of thio-semicarbazide (TSC) in a perovskite precursor solution. Quin et al.21 found that using photochemically active additive benzoquinone (BQ) in a precursor solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) and PbI2 reduces the speed of CH3NH3PbI3 crystal formation due to molecular interactions between MAI and BQ molecules to form flat perovskite films with larger grains, and Wu et al.22 also used organic compound 2-(6-bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)ethan-1-ammonium iodide (2-NAM) as the additive in the perovskite film and succeeded in obtaining high efficiencies of 20.0% and 17.6% for cells with areas of 0.1 and 1.0 cm2, respectively. A very interesting report by Mei et al.23 showed stability for > 1000 hours in ambient air under full sunlight, utilizing 5-ammonium valeric acid (5-AVA) to modify the perovskite crystal growth.
The literature revealed that the inclusion of various additives helps in not only improving the perovskite morphology and grain size but also modulating the charge carrier dynamics.19–25 It is important to mention here that mixing of an additive can be easily done in a one step solution process, where all the starting materials (MAI, PbI2, additives) can be mixed together to make a homogenous solution.26 However, additive mixing in a two step deposition method27 is somewhat complex because this method relies on the final reaction between the PbI2 and MAI layers. Moreover, thermal annealing (temperature and time) of the PbI2 and MAI layers is critical to improve the device efficiency.
In this study, we attempted to explore the additive assisted growth of perovskite films by using a two step inter-diffusion method. By doing so, we developed a simple and very effective approach to improve the crystallization of the perovskite and thus device performance. We investigated the effect of inclusion of ammonium acid iodide (AAI) derivatives, namely, 2-AAI (C2H6INO2), 4-AAI (C4H10INO2), and 6-AAI (C6H14INO2), on the growth of perovskite films and device performance. We observed an increase in the perovskite's grain size and film thickness, which enables the device to draw higher current. Moreover, Voc significantly improves upon addition of these additives, suggesting the suppression of recombination centres within the perovskite film. Hereafter, the samples will be labelled as follows: P1, P2, P3 and P4 for the pure perovskite film and the perovskite films with additives 2-AAI, 4-AAI and 6-AAI, respectively, as shown in Table 1.

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the schematics for the two step synthesis procedure for the formation of perovskite films and the chemical formulae for the additives used, respectively. Mixing of the additives was done in the PbI2 solution, which was spin-coated onto a PEDOT:PSS coated substrate. After heating at 70 °C, for 20 min, a second layer of MAI was spun onto the PbI2 coated substrate. The sample was then placed on a pre-heated hot plate at 100 °C for 1 hour. Finally, a dark brown colour perovskite film was obtained.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of the device fabrication procedure and (b) chemical formulae for the additives used. 
To understand the distribution of additives into the PbI2 solution, the time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling was done for PbI2 films prepared with and without additives, as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d). Sputtering was carried out from the PbI2 side to the ITO substrate at the sputtering rate of ∼2 nm s−1.

The cationic species Pb+, PbI+ and Pb2I3+ were assigned to the PbI2. C2H4NO2+, C4H10NO2+, and C6H14NO2+ were correlated with the additives 2-AAI, 4-AAI and 6-AAI respectively. CH3SO+ and In2O2+ were related to the PEDOT:PSS and ITO substrates, respectively. From the TOF-SIMS measurements, we confirmed that additive molecules were distributed all over the thickness of the PbI2 film. Furthermore, intensity counts increased gradually with an increasing number of methylene units from 2-AAI to 6-AAI. Interestingly, larger molecules were found to be accumulated near the top surface of PbI2 and also in the perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. The segregated 6-AAI molecules near the top surface of the perovskite film remain intact after coating the PC60BM layer, thus reducing the possibility of PC60BM/perovskite interface degradation. The appearance of ITO substrate signals is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) (at a sputtering rate of ∼5 nm s−1) for the PbI2 and perovskite films. We observed that in the case of PbI2 an In2O3 signal appears after 52 seconds of sputtering, whereas for the perovskite it takes nearly 65 s. This is a clear indication of the thickness difference in the PbI2 and perovskite films, and a relatively longer sputtering time was needed to obtain the substrate signal due to the higher thickness of the perovskite layer. Fig. S2 (ESI†) compares the TOF-SIMS depth profiles for pure and 6-AAI mixed perovskite films, where the CH3SO+ signal corresponds to the PEDOT:PSS layer, which is considered as a reference depth to get an idea about the thickness of the perovskite layer. These films were coated with a PC60BM layer to avoid the degradation of the perovskite film before or during the measurement. Comparing the depth profiles of the pure and 6-AAI mixed perovskite films, we did not observe any change except for the signal for C6H14NO2+ for the 6-AAI derivative in the additive containing perovskite film.
To find the correlation between the additive distribution and perovskite crystal growth, we examined the XRD patterns carefully for PbI2 and perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows a perfectly crystalline form of the PbI2 film with the appearance of a (001) peak at a 2θ position of 12.5°, as the PbI2 film was annealed at 70 °C before coating the MAI layer. This heat treatment converted the PbI2 film into the crystalline form. When the additives were introduced into the PbI2 film, the intensities of the (001) peaks were suppressed in comparison with the pure PbI2 film. The maximum suppression of the (001) peak was observed for the 6-AAI mixed PbI2 film and the PbI2 grain size was reduced from 50 nm to 23 nm for the pure and 6-AAI mixed PbI2 films, respectively. This suggests that the presence of additive molecules hinders the PbI2 crystallization process depending on the number of methylene units present in the molecule. In two step deposition methods, underneath PbI2 films serve as a seeding layer to grow the perovskite crystal on it. Therefore, the growth of the perovskite layer is strongly affected by the crystallinity of the PbI2 films as is evident from various reports.28,29Fig. 3(b) shows the XRD patterns for the perovskite film. The peak positions are consistent with previously reported results corresponding to the perovskite crystal.20,27 The intensities of the perovskite peaks were enhanced slightly when the additives were used. Interestingly, samples P1, P2 and P3 showed the secondary phases, arising from PbI2, which further disappeared in the P4 sample, suggesting a more homogeneous reaction between PbI2 and MAI in the presence of larger 6-AAI molecules. We observed a gradual decrease in the grain size of additive mixed PbI2 in comparison with the pure PbI2. This facilitates a more homogenous reaction between PbI2 and MAI in comparison with the pure PbI2 film. Therefore, the secondary PbI2 phase intensity decreased gradually in the P1, P2 and P3 samples and finally almost disappeared in the P4 sample. It has also been observed in the literature that when a small amount of additive is into a PbI2 precursor solution, a self-assembled porous PbI2 is formed, which significantly facilitates the complete conversion of PbI2 to a perovskite.30 This might also be a contributing factor in improving the morphology and crystallinity of the AAI-mixed perovskite films.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed significant modifications in crystal size, shape and surface coverage upon inclusion of the additives as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(h). Fig. 4(a) and (b) compare the morphologies of the pure PbI2 film and 6-AAI mixed PbI2 film. The wettability and coverage of the PbI2 films improved upon addition of the AAI-derivatives (Fig. S8, ESI†). Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the morphologies for sample P1 (pure perovskite) and sample P4 (6-AAI mixed perovskite). A dense layer of small perovskite crystals was obtained on the pure perovskite films. On the other hand, larger crystals were formed in the presence of the 6-AAI additive. Fig. 4(e) and (f) show the cross-sectional views of the complete device structures for the pure perovskite device (i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC60BM) and the 6-AAI additive mixed perovskite device (i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS/6-AAI mixed perovskite/PC60BM). An abrupt interface with smaller grain size was observed in the case of the pure perovskite film; however, a very sharp interface and larger grains were obtained for the 6-AAI mixed perovskite film. The average particle sizes obtained for the pure perovskite film and 6-AAI mixed perovskite film were 233 ± 20 nm and 315 ± 20 nm, respectively. This supports the argument that the inclusion of additives in a two step deposition method improved the perovskite's quality in terms of grain size and distribution. As we have confirmed from TOF-SIMS, these additives are uniformly distributed in the PbI2 films, creating homogenous nucleation sites throughout the PbI2 layer. This further facilitates the uniform reaction between the PbI2 and MAI layers, leading to the complete conversion of PbI2 and MAI into a MAPbI3 film. We noticed some amount of unreacted PbI2 in the pure perovskite film, which disappeared in the 4-AAI and 6-AAI mixed perovskite films. This indicated that the growth of the perovskite film is even more uniform to form a compact and void-free perovskite film with larger crystals, compared to that obtained without additive mixing. Moreover, the 6-AAI mixed perovskite film showed higher absorption in the visible region in comparison with the pure perovskite film (Fig. S3, ESI†). The increased absorption and charge collection are due to the relatively greater surface coverage and uniformity of the perovskite film. The device parameters for the pure perovskite film and the perovskite films with 2-AAI, 4-AAI and 6-AAI additives are summarized in Table 1.

The champion device was obtained with a 6-AAI based device and it exhibited a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 21.01 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.75, corresponding to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.93% in a device area of 0.18 cm2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Moreover, a device efficiency of 11.19% was obtained in a larger area of 0.5 cm2 (Fig. S5, ESI†). It is noteworthy that Jsc over 20 mA cm−2 with an ∼200 nm thin perovskite film is close to the theoretical limit.31 Therefore, the 6-AAI additive mixed perovskite film demonstrates the maximum possible photocurrent by limiting the defect (grain boundaries, ionic impurities, etc.) induced charge scattering. To obtain a reliable PCE, J–V characteristics were measured at varying scan rates from 0.05 V s−1 to 0.40 V s−1 (Fig. S6, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) the additive mixed device does not show anomalous hysteresis effects in its J–V characteristics. This suggests that the additive mixed device had negligible amounts of trapping centers, defects, or charged vacancies in the perovskite film. It is noteworthy that the additive mixed device did not show noticeable leakage currents under −3 V reverse bias conditions as shown in Fig. 5. This was another confirmation of the absence of major defects in our PV cells, as the breakdown in reverse bias is attributed to the tunneling caused by accumulated ionic defects.32

J–V characteristics of the 6-AAI mixed perovskite device in the voltage range of −3 to +3 volt under dark and light conditions. 
We further examined the device performance under continuous illumination (1 sun) (Fig. S7, ESI†). Although both the devices (pure and 6-AAI mixed) showed stabilized Voc and FF values, the additive mixed device showed an improved efficiency due to its higher Jsc and Voc in comparison to the pure perovskite device. A major loss in the long term durability measurement has been observed in the Jsc values of the devices, and Voc remains almost constant. We observed a clear dependence of the device parameters on the number of methylene units in the additives. We may note that the FF remains almost constant, whereas a gradual improvement is observed in Jsc. Another main parameter which improved significantly is Voc, which shows a direct dependence on the size of the molecules due to the increased size of the perovskite grains and film coverage.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the inclusion of additives in a two-step inter-diffusion process. The perovskite's morphology, grain size and thickness improved upon addition of the 6-AAI derivative. The results revealed that these additives effectively improved the grain size of the perovskite film by hindering the crystallization of the PbI2 layer. Furthermore, the effect of the size of the AAI-derivative molecules on the device performance was investigated. Voc showed a direct correlation with the number of methylene units present in the AAI-derivative, and increased with an increasing number of methylene units.
A high reverse bias in the J–V characteristics (in the dark and under illumination) of the perovskite devices was obtained upon addition of these derivatives. Therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of AAI derivatives in perovskite films resulted in an improved morphology and increased grain size, thus improving the device performance.
