    , Accepted 30th August 2017First published on 30th August 2017AbstractNoble-metal free carbon-based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in an alkaline medium have drawn significant attention in the search of suitable/potential replacement of commercial expensive Pt/Ru/Ir-based electrocatalysts. In this regard, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have emerged as potential candidates for ORR/OER and they emulate Pt/Ru-based catalysts. However, the unexposed/unused active sites rendered by N-doping, responsible for bamboo-shaped compartment formation, in NCNTs are hardly accessible to the reactant species and thus barely contribute to ORR/OER. To maximize the utilization of the active centres, Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles entrapped in the graphitic layers and hollow structures of NCNTs are fabricated by pyrolyzing melamine with excess of ferrocene. Annealing at 375 °C in an oxygen environment removes the protective graphitic layers around Fe–Fe3C, and acid-treatment provides an opening to the bamboo compartments of NCNTs (ANCNTs); this offers maximum accessibility of the active sites via the creation of more edges and roughness that enhances the ORR/OER activity. Interestingly, more positive ORR onset and half-wave potentials with excellent accelerated stability (∼98% current retention) and fuel tolerance along with lower onset and Ej=10(OER) potential with high OER current density as compared to those of commercial state-of-the-art electrocatalyst suggest the superior bifunctional behaviour of ANCNTs. The poisoning study with NaSCN on ANCNTs shows the direct involvement of Fe-based centres in oxygen electrochemistry. The overall oxygen electroactivity ΔE = Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) = 0.72 V for ANCNTs is much lower than that of the commercial and recently reported various state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Finally, a prototype battery arrangement using NCNTs as a cathode electrode for powering a light-emitting diode has been demonstrated. Overall, NCNTs can serve as non-precious electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.
Introduction
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a pivotal role in a variety of energy conversion and storage devices such as in fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal–air batteries.1–8 The reactions, especially, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are complex in nature involving multiple electron transfers via multiple steps and require efficient and durable catalysts to facilitate the reactions at a practical rate.1–8 Conventional Pt-based catalysts have been widely studied and optimized for ORR.4–8 However, their susceptible fuel crossover responses with poisoning of active sites and leaching compromise the efficiency of fuel cells.6–8 Furthermore, Pt-based catalysts show inferior OER activity. Similarly, Ir- and Ru-based oxides are well studied and optimized for OER. However, they exhibit inferior ORR.1–3 Additionally, these precious metal-based oxygen catalysts add up a large portion in unit cost and hinder commercialization to a great extent. To circumvent these limitations, nanocomposites of heteroatom-doped/co-doped carbon nanostructures (CNS) with various transition metals have evolved as active and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen electrochemistry.9–21 The presence of local charge imbalance due to the incorporation of hetero-species with different electronegativity and electronic nature modifies/modulates the chemical reactivities, morphologies, and structures with plenty of defects, which offer sufficient electroactive sites for reactions to proceed.22–29 In addition, carbon-based electrocatalysts are cheaper, alcohol tolerant in the case of alcohol fuel cells, and provide easy means of structural modifications/tunability.22,29,30
In all electrochemical reactions such as ORR and OER, a catalyst offers a platform for the reactions to progress on its surface. The concentration of catalytic active sites can be increased by enhancing the specific surface area. In recent past, various nano-engineering fabrication techniques have been employed to manipulate the shape and size of the catalysts for boosting the catalytic efficacy.7,24,25 Recently, Gupta et al. have found that for highly oxidative environment like that of OER, among various carbon nanostructures (carbon black, CNTs, and reduced graphene oxide), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are most suitable for enhanced durability although the activity is inferior to that of benchmarked Pt/Ir for ORR/OER, respectively.10 Thus, it is desirable to have CNT-based electrocatalysts that can be smartly tuned in terms of doping, structure, and morphology to achieve operational durability and performance as that of the precious metal-based electrocatalysts. The literature survey suggests that the synthesis process of CNTs requires catalysts for the promotion of graphitization and metals, such as Fe, Co, and Ni, have been widely used and optimized in this regard.30,31 In most cases, these CNTs are found to be closed at both ends with metal nanoparticle encapsulations. These metal nanoparticles are well protected by thick carbon layers around them and exist even after multiple acid wash.30–32 Thus, the only available specific surface area to facilitate ORR/OER is the outer surface of CNTs; this limits the effective utilization of materials. To achieve excellent activity in heterogeneous catalysis, maximum active sites must be available and exposed for accessibility by the reactant species.9,24–28 However, the doping of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen is highly stable thermodynamically, making inner walls rich in nitrogen and responsible for the formation of a bamboo structure in case of NCNTs.22,29 Recent studies suggest that the presence of transition metals like Fe and Co in NCNTs easily coordinates with pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen which promotes the formation of M–NxC electroactive centres for efficient oxygen electrochemistry.31,32 Among various available electrocatalysts, Fe–Nx/C enriched carbon-based electrocatalysts have the potential to replace the precious metal-based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrochemistry as the binding energy of oxygen to Fe–Nx/C (∼4.45 eV) is nearly equal to that for the bulk Pt (111) surface (∼4.46 eV) for ORR.1a However, the catalytic active sites introduced by these dopant atoms into the inner graphitic layers of NCNTs as well as within the bamboo compartments are hardly accessible for electrocatalytic activity.9 In this regard, it is of immense importance to expose the maximum available active sites irrespective of their positions in NCNTs and enhance the accessibility to the bamboo compartments.
In this regard, NCNTs with Fe–Fe3C entrapped in the walls and inside the hollow structure (named as FNCNTs) were synthesized, which were subsequently annealed in the presence of oxygen at 375 °C (named as annealed FNCNTs); these were then acid washed (named as ANCNTs) to expose the closed bamboo compartments for maximizing the utilization of active sites and providing their accessibility to the reactant species for better ORR and OER (Scheme 1). The process also introduces plenty of defects, such as edges/corners and roughness, into the structure, which are expected to be highly beneficial for oxygen electrochemistry. Interestingly, ANCNTs offer better ORR/OER activities as compared to the as-synthesized NCNTs/FNCNTs as well as the state-of-the-art Pt–C and RuO2 commercial catalysts for ORR and OER, respectively. The poisoning study with NaSCN on ANCNTs ensures the direct involvement of Fe-based centres in oxygen electrochemistry. Finally, a prototype battery arrangement using NCNTs as a cathode electrode for powering a light-emitting diode was demonstrated. Overall, NCNTs can serve as non-precious electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.

Results and discussion
Structural characterization

Fig. 1a shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the FNCNTs. The arrows represent the entrapped Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles. The graphitic layers and hollow structures of the FNCNTs are evident from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 1b). The inset of Fig. 1b further reveals the Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles entrapped in the graphitic layers. In an attempt to enhance the surface area through the accessibility of bamboo compartments, we annealed the FNCNTs at 375 °C for 4 h. The annealing temperature was optimized and selected based upon the TGA results (S1). TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 1c, d and S2†) of the annealed FNCNTs advocate the removal of the protecting carbon layers of nanoparticles in FNCNTs (inset of Fig. 1b). The indexing of the HRTEM images of the annealed FNCNTS (S2) further confirms the conversion of Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles into Fe3O4/Fe2O3 nanoparticles. The annealed FNCNTs were further subjected to acid wash for the removal of exposed metal nanoparticles. It is evident from the SEM and TEM images of ANCNTs (Fig. 1e, f and S3†) that the acid wash of annealed FNCNTs results in the opening of the bamboo compartment and introduction of defects via the creation of edges along the length of the NCNTs. It is worthy to note that the edges may also act as electroactive sites.25,30 Thus, the acid wash offers the bamboo compartment accessibility as well as introduces plenty of defects that are beneficial for catalytic activity. Fig. 1g shows the elemental mapping of ANCNTs. In addition to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, there is a trace of iron, which may be in complex form with Fe–CNx and exists even after acid wash.12,15,18,31,32

Fig. 2a displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the FNCNTs, annealed FNCNTs, and ANCNTs. The peak around 26.60° for all the cases corresponds to the (002) graphitic peak.19 The peaks around 45.0 and 82.5° for FNCNTs are attributed to the (110) and (211) planes of γ-Fe (JCPDS card no. 870722), respectively, whereas the peaks around 43.3, 44.0, and 65.3° are due to the iron carbide (Fe3C) phase (JCPDS card no. 851317).21 The number of peaks is more in the case of annealed FNCNTs. The peaks around 24.2, 33.2, 35.8, 41.1, 62.6, 64.1, and 75.6° correspond to the Fe3O4 phase (JCPDS card no. 65-3107), whereas the peaks around 49.5, 54.2, 57.6, and 72.0° correspond to the Fe2O3 phase (JCPDS card no. 33-0664).33,34 It may be noted that annealing of FNCNTs converts Fe–Fe3C nanostructures into iron oxide (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) nanoparticles. Interestingly, the peaks corresponding to Fe–Fe3C/Fe2O3/Fe3O4 are absent in the case of ANCNTs; this indicates the substantial removal of iron/iron oxide nanoparticles that provides an opening to the bamboo compartments, as evident from Fig. 1f. Fig. 2b shows the Raman spectra of FNCNTs, annealed FNCNTs, and ANCNTs comprising the characteristic peaks of carbon: a disordered peak (D-peak) around 1356 cm−1 and a graphitic peak (G-peak) around 1600 cm−1 along with a second order peak centred around 2700 cm−1 corresponding to the 2D or G′ band.20 However, two additional peaks around 385.0 and 589.5 cm−1 attributed to the iron oxide nanoparticles are observed for the annealed FNCNT (in red colour).33,34 The intensity ratio of D-peak and G-peak (ID/IG) can be useful for comparing the density of defects/edges present in the structure.22,30,35 The ID/IG ratio is increased from 0.98 for FNCNTs to 1.02 for annealed FNCNTs and to 1.21 for ANCNTs. This may be because of the introduction of edges30 into the ANCNTs owing to the removal of iron/iron oxide nanoparticles from the annealed FNCNTs; this is in accordance with the TEM image of ANCNTs (Fig. 1f). Moreover, the large intensity ratio of the G′ and G-peak (IG′/IG) for ANCNTs (∼0.315) as compared to that of FNCNTs (∼0.1) further suggests the reduced wall thickness in ANCNTs.20 Thus, the Raman study suggests the increased defects density in the ANCNTs along with reduced wall thickness; this makes ANCNTs more suitable for catalytic applications.

Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was performed to evaluate the chemical profiles of various elements present in the FNCNTs and ANCNTs. Fig. 2c displays the survey spectra of FNCNTs and ANCNTs comprising the C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Fe 2p peaks. Fig. 2d–f show the deconvoluted core spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Fe 2p of ANCNTs. The intense peak around 284.0 eV corresponds to the sp2 carbon.22 The peak around 285.2 eV indicates nitrogen bonding with sp2 carbon (sp2 C–N) and a satellite peak around 289.5 eV is due to the C–O interaction.22,35 Herein, it may be noted that the peak around 287.3 eV corresponding to the sp3 C–N interaction, which is present in the case of FNCNTs (Fig. S4†), is absent in the case of ANCNTs.35 Probably, the sp3 C–N species are removed during annealing followed by acid washing; this is in agreement with the increased IG′/IG ratio for ANCNTs obtained from the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2b). The asymmetric N 1s core spectrum (Fig. 1e and S4†) suggests the variety of nitrogen profile in the ANCNTs and FNCNTs. The atomic percentage of nitrogen with respect to carbon is evaluated from the area ratio of nitrogen and carbon peaks from the respective core spectrum22 and found to be 3.59% for FNCNTs and 4.64% for ANCNTs. The increased nitrogen percentage in ANCNTs may be attributed to the better accessibility of nitrogen-enriched inner walls20 of ANCNTs with reduced wall thickness, as conferred from Raman studies (Fig. 2b). The literature survey suggests that pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species are thermodynamically preferred in the inner walls of the bamboo compartments in NCNTs.22,29 Thus, reducing the wall thickness and providing an opening to the bamboo compartments are believed to be beneficial for maximum utilization of active sites rendered by nitrogen incorporation towards electrochemical studies. The deconvoluted N 1s core spectrum of ANCNTs shows peaks around 398.6, 399.6, and 401.1 eV corresponding to the pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary nitrogen species, respectively.22,35 The literature suggests that all these nitrogen species contribute to oxygen electrochemistry.23–28,31,32,35,36 However, pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species coordinate easily with iron species to form the Fe–CNx complexes, which serve as active centres for ORR.31,32,35,36 On the other hand, the recent literature suggests that the quaternary nitrogen species modulate the C–N bond length in the carbon plane close to the O–O bond length; this promotes facile oxygen adsorption and hence improves the electrocatalytic activity towards ORR.23,28 The pyridinic, pyrrolic, and quaternary type of nitrogen contributes ∼21, ∼36, and ∼21% in ANCNTs, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1e. The additional peaks around 403.3 and 405.3 eV are attributed to the intercalated molecular nitrogen in the inner walls of the tubes and the oxide forms of nitrogen species.20 However, they do not contribute in the ORR process.23 The recent reports suggest that among the deconvoluted N 1s peaks, the peak centred around 398.6 ± 0.3 eV can be assigned to Fe–Nx coordination.31,32,35,36Fig. 2e and f show asymmetric N 1s and Fe 2p spectra that can be deconvoluted into several peaks. The peak around 398.6 eV advocates the presence of Fe–Nx moieties,31,32,35,36 which is validated by the presence of iron species in ionic form as Fe2+ (712 eV 2p3/2 & 722.4 eV 2p1/2) and Fe3+ (712.8 eV 2p3/2 & 726.5 eV 2p1/2). Moreover, the peak around 709.3 eV in the case of FNCNTs (Fig. S4†) attributed to the Fe0 state35 is absent in the case of ANCNTs; this indicates the removal of metallic iron species. The iron content (mainly Fe2+ & Fe3+, as shown in Fig. 2f) present in ANCNTs is found to be around 6% of FNCNTs (evaluated from the ratio of area under the XPS curve for Fe 2p peaks). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution measurements have been performed through the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption process on FNCNTs shows the type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop of type H4 (Fig. 2g).34,37,38 The hysteresis loop in the range from 0.45 to 1 of P/Po indicates the capillary condensation along with multilayer adsorption, which supports the presence of mesoporosity in FNCNTs.34,37,38 Inset shows the pore size distribution in the FNCNTs as calculated using the BJH model. The specific BET surface area, average pore width, and pore volume are found to be ∼105 m2 g−1 m−1, 6.351 nm, and 0.167 cm3 g−1 m−1, respectively. Interestingly, a noticeable variation in the hysteresis loops for nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of ANCNTs has been observed, which clearly indicates type II isotherm with an H3 type of hysteresis loop that indicates the presence of slit-shaped pores with strong capillary condensation and multilayer pore filling.34,37,38 The presence of slit-shaped pores may be indicative of edges created by the removal of iron/iron oxide nanoparticles by acid wash of annealed FNCNTs along the bamboo compartments of FNCNTs (in agreement with the TEM image shown in Fig. 1f). Moreover, the pore size variation indicates (inset of Fig. 1f) the presence of macropores along with mesopores. The specific BET specific surface area, average pore width, and pore volume for ANCNTs are found to be ∼185 m2 g−1 m−1, 33.77 nm, and 0.316 cm3 g−1 m−1, respectively. The increase in the specific surface area is due to the accessibility of inner walls of ANCNTs, whereas mostly outer surface contributes to the specific surface area determination for FNCNTs.
Electrochemical characterization
Oxygen reduction study
To evaluate the ORR activity, CV curves were initially obtained in an oxygen saturated 0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution at a scan speed of 50 mV s−1, as shown in Fig. 3a. The well-defined cathodic peak for ORR of ANCNTs at −0.320 V has been observed, which is ∼70 mV positive to that of FNCNTs (Fig. 3a) with enhanced current density JANCNTs ∼ −4 mA cm−2 (JFNCNTs ∼ −2.86 mA cm−2). The improved ORR activity of ANCNTs as compared to that of the FNCNTs is due to the enhanced specific surface area, accessibility of active sites in the inner walls of bamboo compartments, and presence of edges in ANCNTs. Furthermore, to understand the better ORR activity of ANCNTs as compared to that of the FNCNTs, the quasi-reversible [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− redox study was carried out to investigate the ease with which electron transfer takes place40 in catalysts under study using 10 mM [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− in a 0.5 M KCl aqueous solution. Fig. 3b shows the CV curves for one-electron quasi-reversible redox peaks of FNCNTs and ANCNTs obtained under similar experimental conditions. The difference between redox peak potentials in the case of ANCNTs is less as compared to that in the case of FNCNTs; this advocates better reversibility of process for ANCNTs along with the enhanced current that supports faster charge transfer and suggests better ORR activity.40 To shed more light on the better ORR activity of ANCNTs, the double layer capacitance (Cdl) that provides an idea about the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) associated with an electrocatalyst10 is evaluated from the CV curves acquired in a nitrogen saturated 0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution in the faradaic silent window from −0.5 to −0.6 V (Fig. S5†). The obtained value is found to be 16 and 8.55 mF cm−2 for ANCNTs and FNCNTs (inset of Fig. 3b), respectively, advocating the increased electrochemical active sites in ANCNTs and hence the better ORR activity. Interestingly, the ratio of the specific BET surface area for ANCNTs to that for FNCNTs (∼1.76) is in excellent agreement to that of Cdl (a measure of ECSA) ratio, which is 1.8.

RDE measurement was further carried out to probe the ORR kinetics. Fig. 3c shows the LSV-RDE curves obtained for commercial RuO2 and Pt–C (20 wt% Pt loading on carbon) along with those of FNCNTs and ANCNTs using traditional three electrode set-up with 1600 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed. The on-set potential (Eon-set) for ANCNTs (Fig. 3d, S6,† and Table 1) is found to be −0.045 V, which is comparable to that of the commercial Pt–C (Eon-set ∼ −0.045 V) and better than that of various recently reported heteroatom-doped carbon-based nanocomposites (Table S1†). Moreover, Eon-set for ANCNTs is 0.027 and 0.141 V positive to that for FNCNTs and commercial RuO2 catalyst. In addition, the half-wave potential (E1/2) for ANCNTs (E1/2 ∼ −0.155) is comparable to that for Pt–C (E1/2 ∼ −0.145) and is in 0.06 and 0.3 V positive side of that for FNCNTs and RuO2 (Fig. 3d, S7,† and Table 1), respectively. To shed some more light on the ORR process using ANCNTs, the LSV-RDE curves were obtained at different rotation rates (Fig. 3e) and at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1. The increased current density with the rotation rate is attributed to the enhanced oxygen transport towards electrodes. Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation6,26,27,39 as given by (1)is used to study the ORR process, where J, Jd, and Jk represent the experimentally obtained, diffusion-limited, and kinetic current densities. Moreover, for RDE voltammetry study, Levich equation correlates Jd with electrode rotation speed and is given by Jd = 0.62nFD2/3ν−1/6Coω1/2(2)where n represents the number of electrons transferred during reduction per oxygen molecule, F (96485 C mol−1) is the Faraday constant, ν (0.011 cm2 s−1) is the kinematic viscosity of the alkaline aqueous solution, D (1.65 × 10−5 cm2 s−1) is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in an aqueous solution, C (8.4 × 10−7 mol cm−3) is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte, and ω is the angular rotation speed of electrode.6,39

The corresponding K–L plots (J−1versus ω−1/2) for ANCNTs at different electrode potentials have been deduced from Fig. 3e. The linear and parallel nature of K–L plots represent the first-order ORR kinetics of ANCNTs (Fig. 3f) with respect to the dissolved oxygen.26,27,39 The kinetic current density (Jk) and the no. electrons transfer (n) can be obtained by the intercept and slope of the K–L plots (Fig. S8† and 3g), respectively. Nearly constant slope, as apparent from Fig. 3f, suggests the steady electron transfer for ANCNTs at different electrode potentials (Fig. 3g). The electron transfer number per oxygen molecule reduction as calculated from the slopes of K–L plots suggests a 4e-reaction pathway (Fig. 3g). The catalysts under studies were further subjected to accelerated stability test (AST) at 800 rpm and at a scan speed of 125 mV s−1. Fig. 3h–j represent the 100th and 2000nd cycles of AST. Among ANCNTs, FNCNTs, and Pt–C, ANCNTs show superior AST, and there is no shift in Eon-set for ANCNTs even after 2000 cycles, whereas the shift in E1/2 (∼12 mV for ANCNTs) is similar to that for Pt–C (∼10 mV) and much less than that for FNCNTs. The measured current density loss at −0.6 V for ANCNTs is about 4%, whereas the loss is 15% for Pt–C and 24% for FNCNTs under similar experimental conditions. Overall, the AST suggests that ANCNTs is an appropriate candidate for ORR. The electrochemical energy conversion devices, such as alcohol fuel cells where Pt-based electrocatalysts are used for ORR, suffer from serious efficiency loss due to fuel crossover from anode to cathode causing the mixed potential generation by Pt–C.4,7,35 Thus, it is desirous to have catalysts that remain tolerant to fuel crossover and selectively serve towards ORR. In this regard, fuel tolerance study has been performed on ANCNTs by introducing ethanol in 0.3 M NaOH solution during the ORR study, as shown in Fig. 3k. It can be noted that the CV curve remains unchanged in the presence of ethanol. However, there is ethanol oxidation in case of Pt–C. Thus, the overall ORR study suggests that nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes can be engineered to achieve an efficient and stable ORR activity.
Oxygen evolution study
Most of the well-studied and suitable electrocatalysts for ORR have very poor performance when they are subjected to OER study and suffer serious stability problem.1–3,39b,41 Unfortunately, the reverse is also factual for the much celebrated noble metal oxide-based electrocatalysts (e.g. RuO2, IrO2etc.) for OER when they are subjected to ORR.1–3,14,15,21,39b,41 Inspired by the better ORR performance and presence of macropores (average pore size ∼33.77 nm) in ANCNTs, we explained the catalytic activity towards OER as well. It may be noted that electrochemical energy storage devices such as metal/air batteries require efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to perform ORR as well as OER to minimize the cycling loss during charging and discharging.2,15,18,41 Contrary to gas consumption process such as ORR where the reduction of oxygen takes place mainly at the electrochemical active centres present at the outer surface, gas-evolving OER process is facilitated by the electrochemical active centres present not only at the outer surface but also at the nitrogen-enriched inner walls of the bamboo compartment. As a matter of fact, the electrochemical active centres associated with nitrogen-enriched inner walls of bamboo compartments are expected to contribute largely in the OER process. Therefore, it is of immense importance to have an appropriate gas outlet (e.g. macropores) to prevent the gas-bubble accumulation; otherwise, the gas will block the fraction of electrochemical active centres and prevent their efficient/effective utilization.41 It is also apparent from the present study that the Eon-set (−0.166 V) and E1/2 (−0.453 V) of commercial RuO2 (which is a state-of-the-art OER catalyst) are much inferior to that of commercial Pt–C (Eon-set ∼ −0.045 V and E1/2 ∼ −0.166 V) catalyst for ORR under similar experimental conditions. In this regard, the recent study suggests that the carbon composites have the potential to serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts.1,2,9–18,21,39b

Fig. 4a shows the RDE-LSV curves for OER on Pt–C, RuO2, FNCNTs, and ANCNTs in a nitrogen-saturated 0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution at 1000 rpm and 10 mV s−1 scan speed. The Eon-set for ANCNTs is ∼0.305 V, which is 117 mV lower than that for FNCNTs. Moreover, the Eon-set for ANCNTs is ∼85 mV lower than that for Pt–C and ∼33 mV lower than that for the RuO2 electrocatalyst (Fig. 4b, S9,† and Table 2). The potential needed to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10), commonly used to apprise the OER activity of an electrocatalyst, is a metric anticipated for a 10% efficient solar water-splitting device11,13 and is obtained from the LSV curves of Pt–C, RuO2, FNCNTs, and ANCNTs (Fig. 4b and S9†). The Ej=10 for ANCNTs is 0.565 V, which is comparable to that for RuO2 (Ej=10 ∼ 0.560 V); however, it is 126 & 135 mV lower than that for Pt–C (Ej=10 ∼ 0.691 V) and FNCNTs (Ej=10 ∼ 0.7 V), respectively. Furthermore, the current density at 0.8 V (Fig. 4c) reaches ∼90 mA cm−2 for ANCNTs, which is much better than that of FNCNTs (∼29 mA cm−2), Pt–C (∼16.3 mA cm−2), and RuO2 (∼40 mA cm−2). Like that of ORR, the better OER current of ANCNTs may be further attributed to the ease with which ANCNT supports electron transfer and increased ECSA (as evident from Fig. 3b). To study the cyclic stability, ANCNTs, RuO2, and Pt–C were subjected to AST at 1600 rpm and scan speed of 150 mV s−1 (Fig. 4d–f). Remarkably, the ANCNTs retain ∼98% of the initial current value even after 2000 cycles (Fig. 4c), whereas RuO2 retains 94% of the initial current value. The situation is serious in the case of Pt–C, with a decrease of 72% in the current value after 2000 cycles. We also evaluated the OER performance of various annealed FNCNT samples treated in acid for different times (S10). The study suggests that the 4 h acid-treated ANCNTs (used in this study) shows better Cdl (S10) along with electron transfer property (S10) and supports the better OER performance.

Overall oxygen electrochemistry
The difference between the potentials (ΔE = Ej=10 − E1/2) at 10 mA cm−2 for OER and half wave potential for ORR provides a measure of overall efficiency of the electrocatalyst towards oxygen electrochemistry.11,13,39b To emulate the reversible oxygen electrode, it is always desirous to have smaller magnitude of ΔE.13 One of the major limitations that causes ∼70% efficiency loss and diminished power output in metal–air batteries is the collective over-potentials for OER (η charge) and ORR (η discharge).2,7,15,18 For ANCNTs, ΔE is ∼ 0.72 V (Fig. 5, S11† and Table 3), which is much lower than that for Pt–C (ΔE ∼ 0.836 V), FNCNTs (ΔE ∼ 0.915), and RuO2 (ΔE ∼ 1.013 V). Moreover, it is lower than that of various hetero-atom doped/co-doped carbon-based-metallic/non-metallic nano-composites such as Fe/Fe3C@NGL-NCNT, ΔE ∼ 1.29 V;12 S–N–C@MWNCNTs, ΔE ∼ 1.25 V;11 N-graphene/CNT, ΔE ∼ 1.00 V;16 CoFe2O4/N–P-biocarbon, ΔE ∼ 0.98 V;14 Fe/Fe3C@N-graphitic layer, ΔE ∼ 0.97 V;21 N,P-carbon paper, ΔE ∼ 0.96 V;17 NS-CN, ΔE ∼ 0.88 V;13 P,N-graphene framework, ΔE ∼ 0.795 & 0.705 V;14 Fe/N/C@BMZIF, ΔE ∼ 0.79 V;15 and BFNCNTs, ΔE ∼ 0.788 V.39b Table S3† summarizes the comparison between ANCNTs and recently reported various state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts, and it can be noted that ANCNTs is one of the best bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.

On the basis of structure–property relationship,13 there are various factors responsible for the superior ORR and OER activities of ANCNTs: (1) the accessibility of inner walls of nitrogen-doped bamboo compartments (Fig. 1f); (2) increased BET surface area and engineered porosity (slit pores, besides meso-/macro-pores, figure) that offer facile transport pathways to reactant species, which further assist the catalytic activity; (3) better electron transfer ability, as evident from the one electron quasi-redox process [Fe(CN)6]3−/4− on ANCNTs with high Cdl (Cdl ANCNTs ∼ 16 mF cm−2 & Cdl FNCNTs 8.55 mF cm−2), an indicative of large electrochemical active surface area of the electrocatalyst;13 and (4) incorporation of edges in ANCNTs due to acid washing of annealed FNCNTs, as evident from Fig. 1f and Raman studies.
Electrochemical poisoning test
Besides the activity of ANCNTs, in an attempt to study the role of Fe-based active centres in oxygen electrochemistry, we carried out the ORR and OER study in the same alkaline solution (0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution) with NaSCN (100 mM). It is well known that SCN− easily coordinates with Fe species and masks the coordination sites, which are otherwise available for electrochemical activities.42 The ORR study in a NaSCN-added alkaline solution under similar experimental conditions suggests the trimmed activity on ANCNTS (Fig. 6a), which is evident from the increased on-set and half wave potentials with reduced catalytic current density. The reduction in the OER activity has also been observed (Fig. 6b). Along with the shift in the potential at which the OER current density is 10 mA cm−2, the substantial reduction in current density has been noted. The loss of activity (ORR/OER) can be attributed to the blockage of Fe-containing active electrochemical centres by SCN−, which is further supported by evaluating the Cdl under poisoning condition. There is a substantial decrease in Cdl from 16 to 5.3 mF cm−2 for ANCNTs. However, the poisoning test on FNCNTs (Fig. S12†) indicates a little change in the ORR-RDE polarization curves. There is also a slight decrease in Cdl from 8.55 to 8.25 mF cm−2 for FNCNTs. These results clearly suggest that most of the Fe–Nx-based electrochemically active centres reside in the inner walls of bamboo compartments of FNCNTs and are not accessible to the reactant species; this is contrary to that for ANCNTs, as shown in Fig. 6. Overall, the study suggests that ANCNTs provide better exposure to Fe-based electrochemical active centres as compared to FNCNTs.

Practical realization
Inspired by the promising overall oxygen electrocatalytic activity, we tested the viability of ANCNTs as a cathode material for practical application. We used a prototype battery arrangement, as shown in Scheme 2 and Fig. 6. An oxygen saturated aqueous solution of 6 M NaOH has been used as an electrolyte medium. Aluminium foil (1 cm × 2 cm, locally available, common household) was used as an anode electrode and ANCNT-coated carbon paper (2 cm × 2 cm, loading of ANCNTs was 0.875 mg cm−2) was used as a cathode electrode. It is worthy to note that the battery fabrication has been conducted under ambient conditions. Fig. 6a and b show the arrangements and powering of the light-emitting diode, which advocates the practical feasibility of ANCNTs as a potential electrode material for battery applications (Fig. 7).

Conclusions
In summary, the present study offers a rational and facile approach for maximum possible accessibility and efficient utilization of active sites rendered by nitrogen incorporation in the inner walls of nitrogen-doped bamboo compartments in NCNTs by opening the bamboo compartments. The better charge transfer ability as depicted by the quasi-reversible one-electron redox process of [Fe(CN)6]3−/4−, enhanced BET specific surface area, as well as improved double layer capacitance in the faradaic silent region (a representative of ECSA) and engineered edges & meso–macropores in ANCNTs show its superiority over the as-synthesized FNCNTs. Moreover, the electrochemical study of ANCNTs for oxygen reduction shows its comparable activity with respect to that of the commercial state-of-the-art Pt–C (Eon-set(ANCNTs) ∼ −0.045 V, E1/2(ANCNTs) ∼ −0.155 V, Eon-set(Pt–C) ∼ −0.045 V, E1/2(Pt–C) ∼ −0.145 V) electrocatalyst with superior accelerated cyclic stability (current retention ∼96% for ANCNTs and ∼85% for Pt–C, after 2000nd cycles) and ethanol tolerance. Furthermore, the better on-set and Ej = 10 potential for oxygen evolution with excellent current density (at 0.8 V JANCNTs ∼ 90 mA cm−2, JFNCNTs ∼ 29 mA cm−2, JPt–C ∼ 16.3 mA cm−2 and JRuO2 ∼ 40 mA cm−2) and accelerated cyclic stability (current retention ∼98% for ANCNTs and ∼94% for RuO2, after 2000 cycles) suggest ANCNTs as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. Remarkably, the overall oxygen electrochemical activity on ANCNTs as evaluated by ΔE = Ej(OER)=10 − E1/2(ORR) is much lower than that of Pt–C, FNCNTs, RuO2 (ΔEANCNTs ∼ 0.72 V, ΔEPt–C ∼ 0.836 V, ΔEFNCNTs ∼ 0.915 V, ΔERuO2 ∼ 1.013 V), and various recently reported hetero-atom doped/co-doped carbon-based metal/non-metal state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts. The poisoning study with NaSCN on ANCNTs shows the direct involvement of Fe-based centres in oxygen electrochemistry. In addition, we tested the feasibility of ANCNTs as a cathode material using a prototype battery system for possible practical application by powering a light-emitting diode. The overall study suggests the rational methodology for developing an efficient oxygen electrode for electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.
Experimental
Materials
For the synthesis of FNCNTs, ferrocene (Merck, 98% purity) and melamine (C3H6N6, Sigma-Aldrich, purity > 99%) were used. Milli-Q water (conductivity ∼5 × 10−8 S m2 mol−1) and sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH obtained from Sigma-Aldrich) were used to make the solution alkaline for electrochemical studies. For the poisoning test, sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN, Sigma-Aldrich, purity > 98%) was used.
Synthesis procedure
FNCNTs were synthesized by pyrolyzing ferrocene (50 mg) and melamine (100 mg) at 950 °C (ramping rate was 10 °C per min) for 3 h using the Lenton tube furnace (LTF 14/—/180) in a quartz tube (1 cm diameter and 100 cm in length) with the open end of the tube connected to a rubber bladder and another end was closed (Fig. S13†). After the synthesis of FNCNTs, the furnace was allowed to cool to attain ambient temperature. Further, the as-synthesized FNCNTs were placed in a quartz boat and annealed at 375 °C for 3 h in the presence of oxygen followed by acid washing with concentrated HCl for 4 h and subsequent washing with milli-Q water multiple times to remove the iron content. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) study suggest that in the temperature window of 40–45 °C (as depicted by the yellow box in Fig. S2†), most of the carbon gets oxidised. Based on this study, the temperature, dwelling time, and gas flow rate in our experiment (for ensuring the partial exposure of Fe–Fe3C nanoparticles) has been optimised, which is 375 °C with the ramping rate 10 °C per minute, and the oxygen gas flow rate is 5 standard cubic centimetres per minute. The washed sample was dried under an IR-lamp before characterization and electrochemical studies.
Characterization
FNCNTs, annealed FNCNTs, and ANCNTs were characterized by FEI SIRION scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI-TECHNAI F30), and high resolution TEM (HRTEM). Further, Raman spectroscopy has been carried out using a Nd:YAG laser, excitation wavelength 532 nm, (WITec, Germany) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern has been obtained via a PAN analytical instrument using a Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA DLD from Kratos) was carried out using an XPS with a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) source. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at 77 K (Quantachrome Instrument) was performed for evaluation of the specific surface area of ANCNTs using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore structures were analysed by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. For electrochemical characterization, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating-disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry studies were carried out via a CHI instrument (700E) using a conventional three-electrode set-up consisting of a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE, active geometrical area ∼0.07 cm2), KCl saturated Ag/AgCl, and Pt ring as the working, reference, and counter electrodes, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
For ORR and OER studies, 10 μL ink solution of FNCNTs/ANCNTs was drop-casted on the working electrode (∼loading 0.9 mg cm−2) each time and dried under a lamp prior to experiment. The ink solution of FNCNTs/ANCNTs was prepared by dispersing 7 mg of FNCNTs/ANCNTs in 1 ml of milli-Q water and 100 μl of Nafion® (5%, Sigma Aldrich) solution followed by sonication for 1 h. For ORR, 0.3 M NaOH aqueous solution was purged by oxygen gas for 25 min, whereas the solution with the same concentration of NaOH was purged with nitrogen gas for 25 min prior to experiments for OER. CV studies for ORR were carried out in the potential window from 0 to −0.8 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Polarization curves using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at different rotation speeds with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 were obtained using an RDE set-up in a 0.3 M NaOH oxygen/nitrogen saturated aqueous solution at room temperature for ORR/OER. The RDE data were analysed using Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (J−1vs. ω−1/2) at different potentials to evaluate the electron transfer (ET) number (n) based on the K–L equation.6,26,27,39 For OER, the LSV curves were obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with 600 rpm in the potential window from 0 to 0.9 V. The same conditions were used for Pt–C (20 wt% loading of Pt on carbon, purchased from Arora Maity, Kolkata, India) and RuO2 (from Sigma-Aldrich purity 99.9% trace metal basis). The Pt/RuO2 loading for ORR and OER was ∼36 μg cm−2 and 0.18 mg cm−2, respectively.
