    , Accepted 30th May 2017First published on 31st May 2017AbstractA new polymeric donor material with pendant copper phthalocyanine side chains (PCuPc) was synthesized. The excellent suitability of a grafting-to approach, combining the controlled radical polymerization of propargyloxystyrene followed by “click” chemistry, was demonstrated. A polymer with a high molecular weight (Mn = 88000 g mol−1) and a narrow distribution Đ = 1.20 was synthesized. FTIR and high resolution MALDI-ToF MS of PCuPc points towards quantitative grafting. The PCuPC is soluble in most of the commonly used solvents such as ethyl acetate, THF and acetone. The absorption behavior and electronic structure was investigated via UV-Vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The thermal behavior could be elucidated via Flash-DSC and liquid crystalline behavior could be observed and confirmed via XRD and polarization microscopy. The Bulk transport was determined by the SCLC method.
Introduction
The combination of controlled radical polymerization (CRP) and “click”-chemistry has been proved to be a highly versatile and robust way for the synthesis of novel highly defined polymeric materials.1 Our group successfully applied this strategy in the synthesis of electronically active materials designed for applications in organic electronics and organic solar cells. We reported pendant side chain polymers,2 block-copolymers3 and defined brush polymers.4 During our work we came to appreciate the comparability and versatility that arises from the modularity and high yield of grafting of this concept.4–6 The first step for the design of those materials is the synthesis of backbone polymers. These can be derivatives of standard thermoplastic polymers like polystyrene (PS) or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which are accessible for the well-established types of CRP. Three methods, namely atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP),7 reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT)8 and nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMRP)9 are commonly used to control radical polymerizations. All three have in common that narrow distributions and a control over the molecular weight can be obtained by reducing the concentration of active radical species during the polymerization.10 By this, the amount of termination reactions, which would otherwise lead to ill-defined polymers with broad distributions, is drastically reduced. We chose NMRP for our study as it is well established for styrene derivatives and the synthesis of propargyloxystyrene has been previously optimized.5 Propargyloxystyrene, a styrene derivative with alkyne functionality in para-position of the styrene, can be coupled to organic azides via the copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). Since the concept “click-chemistry” was proposed in 200211 it has been widely used not only in biochemistry but also materials science.12 The CuAAC, the copper catalyzed version13 of the Huisgen-reaction,14 is its most common representative and was instrumental in the recognition and spreading of the “click” concept. The extra-ordinary efficiency of this reaction, even at low temperature, makes it an excellent choice for polymer analogous reactions with high sterical demand.4,12
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) have been known for a long time as a class of macrocyclic compounds.15 Metal complexes of Pcs like the insoluble CuPc, also known as phthalocyanine blue, are widely used as blue or green pigments.16 The first reports on the synthesis of Pcs were published in the early 20th century15 and the semiconducting behavior has been known since 1948.17 In 1996 Pcs were used for the first time in organic photovoltaics (OPV) as the donor material in combination with fullerene as acceptor.18 Pcs were first used in vacuum deposited devices and optimized systems have reached power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) higher than 4%.19 With solution-processible Pcs, which are desirable due the lower costs in device preparation by coating and printing methods, comparable PCEs could be achieved.20 Very recently, de Oliveira et al. reported on water-gated phthalocyanine transistors showing that Pcs may also be interesting materials in bio electronics.21
One great benefit of using a polymeric semiconductor material is the superior film forming ability of polymers in comparison to small molecules. The synthesis of Pc semiconductor polymers carrying Pc as side chains via a grafting-to process utilizing CuAAC is therefore an attractive way to obtain such materials. Earlier, two materials synthesized in this way were reported, but only low grafting densities were targeted and thus obtained.22 A third report by López-Duarte et al. is the only one that claims a densely grafted polymer.23 There are indications of the successful grafting (IR- and UV-Vis spectroscopy) but neither the polymer characteristic (degree of polymerization and distribution) nor the structure formation were investigated. The ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene is a competing strategy towards defined functional polymers. The ROMP of functional norbornene monomers is a representative for a grafting-through process which inherently leads to densely grafted polymers.24 A first report by Kimura et al. showed the shortcomings of this method though, as only oligomers could be synthesized.25 Escoursa et al. could achieve higher molecular weights but were limited by the low solubility of the resulting polymers and similar to the first report only poor control was achieved which resulted in a rather high dispersity of the polymers (Đ > 2).26 The solubility of Pcs can be tuned by the substitution of the PC-core with different side-groups. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical PCs, substituted with oligo ethylene glycol substituents, were reported.27 Our goal therefore was to establish a way to synthesize Pc side chain polymers with high grafting density, high solubility as well as a defined molecular weight.
Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a highly soluble, hydrophilic semiconductor using grafting-to of an unsymmetrical copper phthalocyanine derivative with azide functionality (CuPc-N3) to a styrene backbone. The hydrophilic swallow tail oligo ethylene glycol substituents allow the processing of the material from eco-friendly solvents such as THF, ethyl acetate etc. Additionally, this material is an interesting candidate for applications in bioelectronics.
Experimental section
Materials and methods
CuBr (>98%), CuCl2 (99%), mesyl chloride (>99.7%), N,N,N′,N′′,N′′-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA, 99%), sodium azide and trimethylamine (>99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE, >98%) and tetra-butylammonium fluoride trihydrate (TBAF, >98%) were purchased from Fluka. 4-(6-Hydroxyhexylsulfanyl)-1,2-dicyanobenzene28 and 4-{2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]-1-[2-((2-ethoxy-ethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxymethyl]ethyloxy}-1,2-dicyanobenzene,29 4-(3′-trimethylsilylpropargyloxy)styrene,5,30N-t-butyl-O-[1-[4-(chloromethyl)phenyl]ethyl]-N-(2-methyl-1-phenylpropyl)-hydroxylamine31 and 2,2,5-trimethyl-4-phenyl-3-azahexane-3-nitroxide31 were synthesized according to published procedures. A CuBr/PMDETA stock solution was prepared for the CuAAc reaction. For this a dry Schlenk flask was charged with CuBr (50 mg, 0.35 mmol) and 5 mL 1,2-dichlorobenzene and the solution was degassed with N2 for 20 min and degassed PMDTA (60 mg, 0.35 mmol) was added. 1H-NMR (300 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 300 spectrometer and calibrated to the solvent peak (CDCl3, δ = 7.26 ppm). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer in attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were prepared on a Mettler Toledo Flash 1 under continuous nitrogen low. Thermogravimetric measurements were performed on a Netzsch STA 409C at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under nitrogen. Absorption measurements were carried out on a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. Optical properties in solution were measured in DCM at a path length of 10 mm; films were spin-coated onto glass slides from a 7.4 mg mL−1 chloroform solution at 1500 rpm. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements were carried out in THF with two Varian MIXED-C columns (300 × 7.5 mm) at room temperature and at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 using a UV (Waters model 468) detector with 254 nm wavelength. The SEC was calibrated with polystyrene as external standard and 1,2-dichlorobenzene as internal standard. MALDI-ToF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Reflex III with dithranol as matrix. All WAXS data reported here were measured using the X-ray system “Double Ganesha AIR” (SAXSLAB, Denmark). The X-ray source of this laboratory-based system is a rotating anode (copper, MicoMax 007HF, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) providing a micro-focused beam at l = 0.154 nm. The data are recorded by a position sensitive detector (PILATUS 300 K, Dectris). To cover the range of scattering vectors between 0.05–22.5 nm−1 different detector positions were used. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out under moisture- and oxygen-free conditions using a standard three-electrode assembly connected to a potentiostat and a PC at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The working electrode was a solid Pt electrode (cross-section area 0.0314 cm2, AMETEK Advanced Measurement Technology). A platinum wire in DCM with conducting salt was used as counter electrode and the quasi-reference electrode consisted of a silver wire and AgNO3 in acetonitrile (0.1 M). tert-Butylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) was used as conducting salt (0.1 M) and DCM as solvent. Each measurement was calibrated against the internal standard ferrocene/ferrocenium. The values of the ionization potential and the electron affinity are calculated from the half wave potential of the first oxidation or the first reduction respectively according to Gräf et al.:32 (1) (2)X: measured compound; E1/2ox1/E1/2red1 half-wave potential of the 1st oxidation/reduction potential; EIP(Fc/Fc+vs. zero vacuum level) = −5.16 eV: value of the ionization potential of ferrocene vs. vacuum level in DCM.
Device preparation and characterization
Single carrier space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) devices in diode configuration were prepared for charge carrier mobility determination of holes within the layer stack of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer/Mo/Au. A hole-injecting layer of PEDOT:PSS (HTL solar (38 nm) from Clevios) was spin coated onto cleaned patterned ITO glass substrates. The polymer solution (3.25 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was doctor bladed on top, with different blade speeds (A higher blade speed will result in a thicker film.), under inert conditions resulting in film thicknesses in the range of 150–500 nm. The thickness was measured after the measurements of the I–V characteristics with a Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. Subsequently, MoO3 and the top Au electrodes were thermally evaporated onto the polymer layer under high vacuum. The devices had an active area of 9 mm2 which is determined by the overlap of the ITO and the evaporated top electrode. Dark current–voltage I–V measurements were made under inert environment at room temperature with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. For mobility evaluation, forward bias voltages, that is, hole injection from PEDOT:PSS were considered. The charge carrier mobilities were evaluated by fitting measured I–V characteristics in a voltage range from 2 to 8 V using the Murgatroyd formula.33 Prior to fitting, the measured I–V characteristics were corrected for the built in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (IR) across contacts.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
With the powerful tool of “click”-chemistry in hand, we were able to synthesize a new grafted donor polymer with copper phthalocyanine as donor units. Synthetically we were interested whether the extraordinarily bulky copper phthalocyanine azide (CuPc-N3) could be grafted to a polymer backbone with sufficient yields via CuAAC. Poly(4-propargyl-oxystyrene) (PPOS) was chosen as a suitable backbone polymer comparable to the one of the grafted poly perylene bis-imides synthesized in our group.5 The solubility of the educts and the product plays a crucial role for the grafting to be successful and quantitative. The CuPc-N3 with three swallow-tail oligo ethylene side chains is therefore an excellent candidate for our study. This compound is soluble in most solvents including water. We were confident that this would be the basis for a high solubility of the grafted polymer and that this would ensure a good solubility and accessibility of the active sites throughout the grafting-to “click” reaction. The CuAAC was conducted under very mild conditions in DCM at 35 °C with CuBr/PMDTA used as catalyst system (Scheme 1). The success of the reaction was proven with SEC after a reaction time of 24 h. The peak at 9000 g mol−1 (PPOS) disappeared and was shifted to considerably higher molecular weights. The narrow monomodal distribution was first an indicator of the successful grafting. The raw product was still contaminated with CuPc-N3 which was used in slight excess, but the extraordinary solubility of the CuPC units resulted in a grafted polymer which is soluble in solvents such as acetone, chloroform, DCM, DMF, ethyl acetate and THF. Thus, unlike many reported semiconductor polymers, this polymer is soluble in a number of non-halogenated solvents. Additionally, its solubility (>1 wt%) in technologically relevant processing solvents such as ethyl acetate and THF allows environmentally benign processing conditions. First attempts to purify the polymer via dialysis proved to be ineffective. Among the common solvents only water and diethyl ether were found to be only solvents in which the polymer could be precipitated from a concentrated solution. Precipitation in diethyl ether was not optimal as the polymer precipitated as an extremely fine powder which could not be filtrated. Only by a combination of several precipitations in diethyl ether in combination with centrifugation, the monomer could be nearly completely removed. The SEC curves of the precursor PPOS and the purified PCuPC are shown in Fig. 1a. The shift to higher molecular weights can be seen at first sight and the narrow distribution of the grafted polymer (Đ = 1.20) in combination with the absence of low- or high-molecular weight shoulders indicates a complete conversion. SEC is a relative method though and no assertion regarding the absolute molecular weight can be made for the grafted polymer through this method. A better, though slightly limited method to determine absolute molecular weights of polymers is MALDI-ToF-MS. This measurement technique is usually restricted to polymers with rather low molecular weight for typical measurements and even more so for measurements in the reflectance mode which enhances the resolution so that the repeating units can be resolved. The MALDI-ToF-MS measurement of PCuPc gave a peak molecular weight of 88000 g mol−1 (Fig. 1b). This value is about 15% lower than we would have expected for a fully grafted polymer. The molecular weight of the precursor PPOS can be determined via SEC since a very similar solution behavior in comparison to the PS-standard used for calibration can be assumed.5 From this the expected molecular weight of a fully grafted PCuPc can be calculated for a DP of 55 to be 102000 g mol−1 (Table 1). We believe that the discrepancy between the calculated value and the experimentally obtained one is not an effect of non-quantitative grafting but rather an artifact from the mass spectrometry itself. Even though the dispersity of the polymer is fairly low it is close to what is considered a broad distribution for MALDI-ToF (Đ > 1.2). MALDI-ToF measurements of polymers with higher dispersities exhibit underestimated molecular weights as the low molecular weight fractions are preferentially ionized.34 Additionally, the expected molecular weight of PCuPc is already at the upper limit of this technique but the resolution of the mass spectrum is still high enough to detect the repeating units of the polymer. By measuring the difference between two peaks a value of 1859 g mol−1 is obtained which is almost exactly the expected value for the Pc repeating unit. This observation of a single peak series is only possible in case of a nearly quantitative grafting leading to each repeat unit carrying a Pc unit. If the grafting was lower the difference between the two peaks would not only be lower but the repeating units would certainly not be observable anymore. A grafting of 85%, as indicated by the peak molecular weight, would not result in phthalocyanine groups being attached to 85% of the active sites in every chain but rather to a distribution of chains with higher and lower grafting densities. In effect this would blur the peaks of the repeating units and only the overall weight distribution would be observable.

The strong line broadening impedes a reasonable characterization via1H-NMR (Fig. S1, ESI†). IR-spectroscopy on the other hand can be applied to monitor the presence of alkyne and azide groups. The absence of the vibrational bands of both functionalities (N3 at 2095 cm−1 and alkyne at 3290 cm−1) in the spectrum of PCuPC (Fig. 2) is another evidence for the purity of the polymer (absence of N3) as well as the successful quantitative grafting (absence of alkyne).
 Fig. 2  IR spectra of the precursors PPOS (black) and CuPc-N3 (red) and the grafted polymer PCuPC (blue). The band at 3290 cm−1 which is present in PPOS and is assigned to the alkyne (gray elipse) cannot be detected in PCuPc. Similarly, the band at 2095 cm−1 which is present in CuPc-N3 and is assigned to the azide (red elipse) can also not be detected in PCuPc. 
Optical and electrochemical characterization
The UV-Vis spectra of porphyrins–phthalocyanines are nitrogen-substituted derivatives of this class of macrocycles – consist of two distinct sets of peaks. In the region between 300–500 nm the Soret- or B-bands can be observed which are ascribed to the S0 → S2 transition.35 The Q-bands which are ascribed to the S0 → S2 transition are shifted to considerably higher wavelengths. The position, quantity and relative intensities of the Q-bands are strongly influenced by the symmetry of the molecule, whether or not the macrocycle is complexed by a metal cation, and by the nature of the complexing metal.36 The solution spectrum in DCM of the CuPc derivative CuPc-N3 used in this study has two Soret-bands at 339 nm and 394 nm. The Q-bands can be observed at 615 nm and 685 nm with the lower energy transition showing a considerably higher absorption (Fig. 3a). This is the expected spectrum for a CuPc in a good solvent i.e. the molecules are fully dissolved and in their non-aggregated state.37
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-Vis Spectra of PCuPc in solution (DCM) and in thin film in comparison to the phthalocyanine monomer CuPc-N3 (b) cyclic voltammetry of PCuPC in DCM. 
The solution spectrum of PCuPc is very similar compared to CuPc-N3 in the Soret-band region (334 nm and 394 nm) but shows a distinctly different behavior in the Q-band region. The position of the peak maxima is shifted slightly (629 nm and 680 nm) but even more noticeable is the change in peak intensities. Whereas the lower energy transition in CuPc-N3 has a nearly 4 times stronger absorption than the higher energy Q-band, the ratio in PCuPC is nearly 1:1 with the lower energy transition being the one with the smaller absorption. This behavior can be explained by the formation of H-aggregates formed by π–π-stacking of the phthalocyanine side chain units.38 We propose that this aggregation is observed due to the forced proximity of the phthalocyanine units which are densely grafted to the polymer backbone. This assertion can be validated by measuring the polymer at different concentrations (Fig. S2, ESI†). We observed no concentration dependence of the PCuPc spectra in DCM which is indicative of intra-molecular aggregation unlike CuPc-N3. Additionally, PCuPc was measured in thin film in order to get first indications whether any additional aggregation can be observed in the solid state. Again the only changes were observed for the Q-bands. The peak maxima are observed at 618 nm and 680 nm and the lower energy peak is further reduced in intensity in comparison to the spectrum in solution. The aggregation in thin films is therefore increased in relation to the solution and it can be expected that at least some kind of order is present in the solid state. We will address this question further in the next part after we have a look at the electronic structure of PCuPc.
Cyclic voltammetry was performed to study the redox process of PCuPc and to approximate the fundamental gap Eg,fund which relates to the energy difference between the ionization potential IP and the electron affinity EA.39 We could observe both the first oxidation and the first reduction of PCuPc in DCM solution. The first oxidation was observed at a half wave potential of E1/2ox(PCuPcvs. Ag/AgNO3) = 240 mV and the first reduction was observed at a half wave potential of E1/2red(PCuPcvs. Ag/AgNO3) = −1420 mV. With eqn (1) and (2) in the methods section we can calculate the ionization potential IP and the electron affinity EA in relation to the vacuum level. IP was determined to be −5.40 eV and EA −3.70 eV, respectively. The difference between these two represents the fundamental gap Eg,fund = 1.66 eV. The value of the fundamental gap is very good agreement with reported values on no polymer bound CuPcs.40
Structure and thermal properties
The high complexity of the grafted polymer on the one hand with its very bulky and sterically demanding side groups and on the other hand dense grafting of discotic-type units as side chains offer an interesting system in terms of structural order/disorder. Therefore, we were interested in the question whether some kind of order/periodicity in structure could be observed. We also had first indications of a stacking of the side chain units in solid state. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted first to probe the thermal stability of the system. We could determine the onset of degradation at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 under inert atmosphere to be 315 °C (Fig. 4a). The weight loss in the first step (40 wt% at about 300 °C) corresponds to the same weight percentage as of OEG side chains and therefore, is most likely due to the decomposition of the OEG side chains. This is also supported by the fact that polyethylene glycol decomposes at about 300 °C with a mass loss of 100%. The second major step of decomposition happens above 450 °C with a mass loss of 40 wt%. This can be attributed to decomposition of the CuPc pendant groups. Secondly, we tried to access the phase transition temperatures with a standard DSC measurement at a 10 K min−1 heating rate. Within the accessible range below the degradation temperature no transitions could be observed even though birefringence was found with polarization microscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†), which indicated the existence of an ordered phase at room temperature. Hence we were certain that some kind of phase transition should be observable. We therefore switched to a Flash-DSC which allows measurements with extremely high heating rates up to several thousand K s−1.41 These heating rates can be realized by reducing the sample size to just a few nanograms. While this technique was developed to probe the kinetics of phase transitions, we use the fact that stress on the material is very low due to the very short time that the sample is subject to high temperatures. This makes it possible to even measure phase transitions that are above the decomposition temperature at normal conditions. The measured DSC curves at heating rates from 50–1000 K s−1 are plotted in Fig. 4b. We were now able to detect first order phase transitions above 300 °C.

(d) Illustration of the lattice and the main parameters. 
The melting transition at a heating rate of 1000 K s−1 is as high as 314 °C and crystallization is observed during cooling at 270 °C. The nature of the ordered phase at room temperature was investigated via wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) with a q range of about q ≈ 1–22 nm−1. The structure above the transition temperature was not accessible due to the same reasons as for the standard DSC measurements. However, the diffraction pattern of the PCuPc at room temperature (Fig. 4c) clearly exhibits three peaks in the low q region till 10 nm−1, one very broad peak in the range of 10–20 nm−1 and an additional peak at 18.50 nm−1. A structure model was obtained by the following considerations. The presence of a low number of broad peaks and absence of further peaks is indicative of a liquid crystalline mesophase. As the formation of columnar π–π-stacking is commonly observed for disc-like mesogenes, such as phthalocyanines, we investigated if such a structure could explain the observed pattern. Additionally, the fact that the order is mainly expected in the lateral direction, with a more liquid-like packing along the stacking direction, makes it possible to describe the system by a 2D model.
We started with the system showing the highest symmetry, which is the hexagonal one. The unit cell of a hexagonal 2D lattice is defined by the lattice constant a and the angle γ = 120 °C. The q-values qhk0 for different miller indices can be calculated as follows: (3)The lattice constant a was determined from the first peak q1 under the assumption that it represented the (100) reflection of the hexagonal unit cell. The lattice constant was calculated for a value of a = 2.823 nm. The higher reflections in a hexagonal system are expected at  and .42 All calculated reflexes are indicated in Fig. 4d by red bars. It can be seen that there is a very good agreement of calculated positions and the observed pattern. The appearance of the (110) and the (200)/(020) reflexes as only one is most likely due to overlap as result of the peak broadening. The broad peak at 10–20 nm−1 represents the amorphous parts of the polymer. The reflex with the highest q-value can be assigned to the π–π-stacking and the position relates to a stacking distance of 0.34 nm. The validity of our model is ultimately determined by calculation of the crystallographic density: (4)In our case the molar weight M is the molecular mass of the repeating unit (M = 1858.69 g mol−1), NA is the Avogadro's constant and n = 1 is the number of molecules within the unit cell. A reasonable density value of ρ = 1.32 g cm−3 was obtained. The room temperature mesophase of PCuPc is therefore determined to be columnar hexagonal Colh although the strong broadening of the reflexes indicates lack of perfect order. The existence of the Colh mesophase is also in good agreement with the structure of the CuPc moiety itself. XRD and polarization microscopy reveal the existence of a room temperature Colh mesophase for CuPc-OH (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Space charge limited current mobility (SCLC)
We measured the I–V characteristics of hole-only devices with different thicknesses to extract the mobility in bulk in the space charge limited current regime. The determination of the mobility values requires the fitting of the measured curves. We used the empirical Murgatroyd (eqn (5)) formula, which considers a field dependence of the mobility in the SCLC regime. (5)The current density J is measured against the voltage V. The semi-log plots of J vs. V indicate a V2 dependency regime and for different thicknesses a L−3 dependence of J is observed (Fig. 5). The relative permittivity εr(∼3.5), the vacuum permittivity ε0 and the thickness of the polymer film L are fixed parameters. The I–V curves are fitted with the zero field mobility μ0 and the empirical parameter γ in the range of space charge limited transport which is characterized by J ∼ V2. The log–log plot of the I–V shows that no slopes greater 2 are observed which are indicative of trap limited transport (Fig. S5a, ESI†).43 In contrast to other reports on the mobility of PCs measured in diode configuration we only observed true SCLC behavior for PCuPc.44 This was validated by the aforementioned quadratic dependency of the current density on the voltage but also cubic on the inverse active layer thickness . (Fig. S5b, ESI†). We therefore assured the reproducibility and validity of the calculated mobility values for three devices with a different active layer thickness (Table S1, ESI†). For reporting the bulk mobility of PCuPc in a consistent way, we determine an effective mobility μ at the same electric field  as given by the Poole–Frenkel relationship (eqn (6)). (6)The relative mobility for PCuPc was determined to be 5.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. This value is lower than reported values on low molecular liquid crystalline CuPc and ZnPc, but no true SCLC behavior was observed in those cases.44 Many of the reported SCLC values do not verify the presence of SCLC regime or L−3 dependence. The main charge transport channel in such a material will occur along the π–π stacking direction. A columnar liquid crystal provides an efficient and flexible conduction pathway along the column. Even though the hydrophilic swallow tails improve the solubility and is required for processing the materials, it does not contribute towards electronic charge transport. Thus OEG substituents and main chain polystyrene which are insulating materials dilute the amount of the electronically active Pc core. This can lower the charge carrier mobility.45

Conclusions
We have synthesized a new phthalocyanine donor polymer in which Pc moieties are densely grafted to a polystyrene backbone and observed the high efficiency of the grafting process via CuAAC. We were therefore able to synthesize a defined functional polymer (Đ = 1.20) with high molecular weight (88000 g mol−1). The high solubility of both the azide and the polymer was essential for the almost quantitative grafting which in turn is responsible for the observed structure formation. Surprisingly, we could obtain a good quality MALDI-ToF spectrum with a resolution of the repeating units. We found that PCuPc forms intramolecular aggregates in solution due to the forced proximity of the phthalocyanine side chains. Bulk studies revealed the liquid crystalline nature of the polymer which forms a Colh phase. A phase transition could be observed only at high temperatures, with Flash-DSC at ultra-fast heating rates. Measurements of the space charge limited current of the material in a diode setup exhibited rather low bulk hole-mobilities of 5.3 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. We believe that this material is an interesting candidate for applications in bioelectronics and currently we are testing its applicability for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs).
