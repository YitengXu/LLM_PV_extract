    , Accepted 13th May 2020First published on 18th May 2020AbstractSince the discovery of graphene in 2004, it has become a worldwide hot topic due to its fascinating properties. However, the zero band gap and weak light absorption of graphene strictly restrict its applications in optoelectronic devices. In this regard, semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials are thought to be promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices. Infrared (IR) light has gained intensive attention due to its vast applications, including night vision, remote sensing, target acquisition, optical communication, etc. Consequently, the generation, modulation, and detection of IR light are crucial for practical applications. Due to the van der Waals interaction between 2D materials and Si, the lattice mismatch of 2D materials and Si can be neglected; consequently, the integration process can be achieved easily. Herein, we review the recent progress of semiconducting 2D materials in IR optoelectronic devices. Firstly, we introduce the background and motivation of the review. Then, the suitable materials for IR applications are presented, followed by a comprehensive review of the applications of 2D materials in light emitting devices, optical modulators, and photodetectors. Finally, the problems encountered and further developments are summarized. We believe that milestone investigations of IR optoelectronics based on 2D materials beyond graphene will emerge soon, which will bring about great industrial revelations in 2D material-based integrated nanodevice commercialization.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of the atomically thin graphene flake in 2004,1 it has been triggering intensive research interest. As compared with conventional bulk semiconductor materials, optoelectronic devices based on graphene have exhibited remarkable performance, such as extremely high carrier mobility at room temperature,2 fast photoresponse (110 GHz),3 large electro-optic modulation bandwidth (30 GHz),4 high performance photo-detection,5,6etc. However, the applications of graphene in integrated electronics and optoelectronics are severely restricted by its zero band gap.7 Fortunately, there are a large number of semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as black phosphorus (BP) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which are widely investigated in electronics and optoelectronics.8 These semiconducting 2D materials show novel physical and chemical properties, including thickness-dependent bandgaps, high carrier mobility, wide optical absorption, high optical response, etc., which lead to their excellent performances in electronic and optoelectronic devices.9–22 During the past decade, due to the rapid development of the semiconductor industry, an urgent demand for compact or ultra-compact optoelectronic devices at the nanoscale has emerged. Several advantages enable 2D materials to possess great potential for Si integrated optoelectronic devices. Firstly, these 2D materials can be transferred to or grown on a variety of substrates without considering the lattice mismatch between the 2D material and the substrate material because of the weak van der Waals interaction of the 2D material with the substrate and the naturally passivated surface of the 2D material.23 Thus, they can be easily integrated with Si structures, which are in a highly mature state. For example, they can be used in integrated optical modulators,24,25 integrated circuits,26etc. Secondly, these 2D materials show excellent optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties, such as strong optical absorption and response over a wide range from the visible band to the MIR band, relatively high carrier mobility, large exciton binding energy, and strong luminescence emission, which are beneficial for high performance optoelectronic devices. For example, monolayer TMDCs have strong light absorption and can absorb up to 5–10% incident sunlight in a thickness of less than 1 nm, which is 1 order higher than that of Si and GaAs.27 The photoresponsivity for a monolayer MoS2 photodetector can be as high as 880 A W−1.28 Monolayer WS2 has a very large exciton binding energy (∼0.7 eV)29 and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (∼6%).30 Few-layer BP had a field effect hole mobility of ∼1000 cm2 V−1 s−1.31 Finally, the optical properties can be well controlled by various methods, such as electrical gating,32 chemical doping,33etc., which is beneficial for tunable optoelectronic devices. Owing to these advanced properties, semiconducting 2D materials have been widely employed to achieve high performance photodetectors, light emission/lasing devices, solar cells, modulators, etc.34–43
The infrared (IR) region includes a very wide spectrum range, from 700 nm to ∼1 mm. Compared with the visible region, the IR region is more technologically important because most of the military and civilian applications are developed in the IR region, such as remote sensing, night vision, target acquisition, surveillance, optical communication, etc. In this regard, the exploration of applications of 2D materials in the IR region has attracted wide attention in recent years. In this review, the properties of the major 2D materials for IR applications are introduced, followed by a review of the recent progress of 2D materials in light emission, optical modulation and photodetection. Finally, a perspective on future research and challenges of these fascinating materials is also proposed.
2. 2D material candidates
There are a large number of 2D materials. Mounet et al. demonstrated that there are 5619 compounds with a layered structure according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations,44 and 1825 compounds were identified to be either easily or potentially exfoliated. For IR utilization, the material should have strong interaction with IR light. Generally, IR light is divided into several sub-ranges: 0.7–1.4 μm, near IR (NIR); 1.4–3 μm, short IR (SIR); 3–8 μm, mid IR (MIR); 8–15 μm, long IR (LIR); >15 μm, far IR (FIR). For strong light absorption, the band gap of the 2D material should be smaller than the photon energy of the incident light. As a result, the number of materials that can be used in IR applications is reduced. Fig. 1 schematically shows the band gap range of some of the typical 2D materials that can be used in IR applications. As can be seen, the number of the reported 2D materials that can be used is reduced as the wavelength increases. Thus, searching for new 2D materials with good optoelectronic properties in the SIR to FIR range is still a challenge. In this section, we will discuss the basic properties of some typical 2D materials for a better understanding of their optoelectronic behaviors. Also, a brief introduction concerning the synthesis of 2D materials is presented in the last part of this section.

2.1 Transition metal dichalcogenides
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are the most intensively studied semiconducting 2D materials because of their interesting electrical and optoelectronic properties.45 The chemical formula of TMDCs is MX2, where M is a transition metal element (such as from group IV, group V, or group VI) and X is a chalcogen.46 The material forms a layered structure in the form of X–M–X, where the chalcogen atoms in two hexagonal planes are separated by a plane of metal atoms. Adjacent layers are held together by the weak van der Waals interaction, forming the corresponding bulk crystal. The stacking orders and metal atom coordination determine the polytypes of TMDCs. The stable phase of traditional TMDCs, including MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, and MoTe2, is the 2H phase, which has a hexagonal symmetry and the metal atoms have trigonal prismatic coordination.46
Traditional TMDCs have an interesting layer-dependent band structure and band gap evolution properties.47 The band gap increases with the decrease of layer numbers. In general, the monolayer form is a direct band gap semiconductor; in contrast, the multilayer form is an indirect band gap semiconductor. Furthermore, arising from van Hove singularities, the light–matter interaction in monolayer TMDCs is very strong, leading to very high light absorption.48 Single-layer TMDCs can absorb more than 10% incident light at resonance exciton wavelengths.14 The band gap of traditional TMDCs is in the range of 1.0–2.1 eV,46 which makes them suitable for NIR applications. In addition, they can also be used in the SIR region, and even in the LIR region, by defect engineering,49–51 electrical field modulation of the band gap,52,53etc. Due to the symmetry of traditional monolayer TMDCs, they show interesting valley-dependent optical and electrical properties.54 Traditional TMDCs also have decent carrier mobilities.46 For instance, experimental results show that the MoS2 monolayer has a field effect electron mobility of ∼260 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a field effect hole mobility of 175 cm2 V−1 s−1.55 Theoretically, the phonon limited carrier mobility of traditional TMDCs is much higher than the experimental results, e.g. MoTe2 was predicted to have a mobility of 2526 cm2 V−1 s−1.56 This way, traditional TMDCs are good candidates for IR applications.
Noble metal dichalcogenides (NMDCs), including PtSe2 and PdSe2, have been recently rediscovered due to their narrow band gap and excellent optoelectronic properties. The stable phase of PtSe2 is the 1 T phase, which has a rhombohedral symmetry and the metal atoms have octahedral coordination.57,58 Bulk PtSe2 shows a metallic behavior, and with the decrease of the thickness it shows metal–semiconductor transition.59,60 Both experimental and theoretical results show that monolayer PtSe2 is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.2 eV,61 suitable for NIR applications. In addition, Yu et al. have found that bilayer PtSe2 is an indirect semiconductor with a band gap of ∼0.3 eV, which can be further reduced by the introduction of Se vacancies,62 indicating the possibility of using it in wide IR spectrum applications. Apart from the appropriate band gap of PtSe2, it also shows good electrical properties. Zhao et al. have found that few-layer PtSe2 showed a high room temperature field effect electron mobility of ∼210 cm2 V−1 s−1 with excellent stability (over one year),59 ensuring fast response utilized in photodetectors. Unlike PtSe2, PdSe2 has a pentagonal structure, where Pd atoms coordinate with four Se atoms, leading to the formation of a square backbone network.63 PdSe2 is very stable in air and the band gap can be tuned from 0 eV for bulk to 1.3 eV for monolayer obtained by micro-absorption optical spectroscopy and first-principles calculations as demonstrated by Oyedele et al.,64 suggesting the possible wide spectrum applications. Furthermore, few-layer PdSe2 also has a high electron field-effect mobility of ∼158 cm2 V−1 s−1.64 The wide band gap variation combined with the high carrier mobility of PtSe2 and PdSe2 make them promising for IR applications. Noticeably, the conductivity of PdSe2 can be tuned from P- to n-type by reducing atmospheric pressure to vacuum condition gradually, which is beneficial for high performance logic circuit applications. Meanwhile, the hysteresis in the transfer characteristics can also be suppressed efficiently and ensure high performance FETs based on PdSe2.65 Apart from the above-mentioned TMDCs, other materials, including HfS2, HfSe2, ZrSe2, ReS2, and ReSe2, with a small band gap (1.1–1.58 eV),66–68 show potential applications in the NIR region.69–72
2.2 BP and related materials
Black phosphorus (BP) is the most stable allotrope of phosphorus, which was rediscovered in 2014 due to its high carrier mobility, wide variation of the band gap, and strong intra-layer anisotropy.31,73,74 BP is a layered material with orthorhombic symmetry and a space group of D182h.75 Due to sp3 hybridization, a single layer of BP shows a puckered structure along the x direction (armchair direction), which leads to an anisotropic band structure.76 In this regard, the electrical, optical and thermal properties are highly anisotropic.77 Unlike traditional TMDCs, BP has a direct band structure, independent of layer numbers. Due to the interlayer interaction, the band gap is strongly related to layer numbers. For a single layer, the band gap of BP is ∼2.0 eV, and it gradually reduces to ∼0.33 eV with the increase of layer numbers.78 The main contributions to the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum of BP are localized P 3pz orbitals. The localized P 3pz orbitals are vertical to the puckered layer plane, which indicates that the electronic properties of BP are very sensitive to the electrical field applied perpendicular to the layered plane.79 Both theory and experiments have confirmed the tunable band gap of BP under a perpendicular electrical field.79–82 Experimental results showed that few-layer BP has a very high hole mobility, up to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1.53 The excellent electrical properties combined with the widely tunable band gap make it a promising IR material with exotic device performance. However, air stability is a big challenge for the widespread use of BP.83
The smallest band gap of BP is ∼0.33 eV, corresponding to ∼3.76 μm in wavelength, which is located at the MIR region. For further reducing the band gap of BP to enrich its applications in the IR-related area, Liu et al. have alloyed BP with As, forming b-AsP, which has a band gap of 0.15 eV for the optimized composition.84 By tuning the chemical composition of b-AsP, its band gap can be well controlled. Furthermore, b-AsP inherits the anisotropic properties of BP. After alloying, the hole mobility is reduced to 110 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is still high enough. The good electrical properties and tunable band gap of b-AsP make it a good candidate for MIR, and even LIR, applications.
Similar to b-AsP, black phosphorus carbide (b-PC) is a kind of layered semiconducting material. Unlike b-AsP, most of the stable b-PC has a fixed composition ratio between P and C, which is 1.85,86 Depending on the crystal structure, b-PC can be metallic, or semi-metallic with an anisotropic Dirac cone, or direct-gap semiconductors according to DFT calculations.86 In addition, two semiconducting phases of b-PC with puckered or buckled surfaces have the lightest electrons and holes among the known 2D semiconductors, leading to superior carrier mobility (∼105 cm2 V−1 s−1) by DFT calculations.85 Tan et al. calculated the layer-dependent band structure of one of the stable phase b-PC, P2C2, by the DFT method.87 Monolayer b-PC was predicted to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a gap of 0.59 eV, which changed to an indirect band structure with a gap of 0.24 eV for bulk, indicating the wide broad spectrum range covered by b-PC. Experiments indicated that composite b-PC showed a high room temperature hole mobility of 1995 cm2 V−1 s−1.87 In addition, the absorption of b-PC extended to 14 μm, larger than that of BP. Hence, it is possible to use b-PC in the LIR range. Very recently, Xu et al. have found another stable phase b-PC, PC6, with a buckled graphene-like structure through DFT calculations.88 They found that the PC6 monolayer has a direct band structure with a band gap of 0.84 eV and it has extremely high electron mobility along the armchair direction (2.94 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1) and hole mobility along the zigzag direction (1.64 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, PC6 shows a high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1) in a broad spectrum range (300–2000 nm). The excellent electrical and optical properties of PC6 make it promising for high performance optoelectronics.
2.3 Bi2O2Se and related materials
Recently, a new kind of 2D material, Bi2O2Se, has joined the 2D material family. It is a typical Bi-based oxychalcogenide material with a layered structure. Bi2O2Se has a tetragonal structure with D174h space group symmetry, and consists of planar covalently bonded Bi2O2 layers, which are sandwiched by Se square arrays with relatively weak electrostatic interactions.89 Unlike the traditional van der Waals layered materials, the layered Bi2O2Se lacks standard van der Waals gaps. These kinds of layered materials are called charge-carried layered materials, for example, mica is a typical charge-carried layered material. Due to the interlayer interaction, Bi2O2Se shows a layer number-dependent band gap predicted by DFT calculations.90 A band gap of 0.8 eV was confirmed for bulk Bi2O2Se by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements.90 Bi2O2Se is air stable and was demonstrated to show ultrahigh Hall mobility (>20000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperature). The excellent electrical properties and suitable band gap of Bi2O2Se ensure its application in high speed IR optoelectronics. When substituting Se with Te, Bi2O2Te exhibits a smaller band gap of 0.23 eV,91 which can be used in the MIR region.
More recently, two other kinds of bismuth chalcogenides, Bi2Te2S and Bi2Te2Se, have been predicted to have excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties based on DFT calculations.92 The predicted electron mobility for the two compounds was as high as 20000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the band gap of the two compounds was about 0.7 eV, located in the SIR range, which makes them good absorbers of sunlight. The high electron mobility combined with the moderate band gap renders the two compounds promising candidates in high-speed optoelectronic devices operating in the IR region.
2.4 Other 2D materials
Apart from the above-mentioned materials, other 2D materials having a small band gap can also be used in IR applications. Recently, both theoretical and experiments results have suggested the superior properties of tellurenes in IR applications. Bulk Te has an indirect band gap of 0.325 eV, which increases to 1.265 eV in the single layer form.93 Though Te has a unique chiral-chain crystal lattice and is a true one-dimensional material, atomically thin 2D Te (tellurene) can be obtained by various kinds of methods.94 Tellurene was found to have a large field effect hole mobility of 700 cm2 V−1 s−1.95 Also, tellurene was predicted to have a strong broadband light absorption, which is almost two to three times that of BP.96 The high optical absorption with high mobility indicates the potential of tellurene for advanced optoelectronic applications.
In-Based main group metal chalcogenides have a band gap located in the IR region. For example, bulk InSe has a band gap of ∼1.26 eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 984 nm. Hence, few-layer InSe can be used in the IR region. Some of the transition metal trichalcogenides, such as TiS3, TiSe3, and ZrSe3, have a narrow band gap, making them good candidates for IR applications. Tetradymites are a kind of compound with a chemical formula of M2X3, where M stands for Bi or Sb, and X stands for chalcogens (S, Se, Te). Bi2S3, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 have a small band gap, making them suitable for IR applications. Furthermore, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are topological insulators, which have gapless surface states originating from strong spin–orbit interaction.97 Based on the characteristics of topological insulators, novel optoelectronic devices working in the IR region are anticipated.
Multinary layered materials with a narrow band gap have also attracted much attention in the IR-related area.98–100 For example, few-layer CuIn7Se11 has an indirect band gap of 1.1 eV,98 and Ta2NiSe5 has a direct band gap of 0.28 eV and maintains its direct band gap nature down to the monolayer.101 For a better understanding of their possibilities in the IR region, the band gaps of some of these 2D materials are listed in Table 1.

The practical applications of 2D materials in the IR-related area, especially for Si integrated optoelectronics, depend on the synthesis of high-quality materials with a large area, even wafer-scale. Many synthesis methods have been developed to date, such as mechanical exfoliation, liquid exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), metal organic CVD (MOCVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), conversion of precursors into targeted materials (such as sulfurization of W or WO3 film into WS2), etc.100–134 Though high quality 2D materials can be obtained by the mechanical exfoliation method, only a small amount of flakes with uncontrollable size and thickness can be achieved, which can be used to investigate the basic properties of 2D materials but is not suitable for large-scale practical applications. Liquid exfoliation can achieve large-scale synthesis of 2D material flakes with a rough controlled thickness, but the crystal quality is poor, which is not suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The quality of 2D materials synthesized from large area film synthesis methods, such as CVD, MOCVD, and ALD, is between mechanical exfoliation and liquid exfoliation, which are suitable for large-scale practical applications. To date, much achievement has been made on the synthesis of wafer-scale 2D materials, especially for TMDCs (Fig. 2). However, the materials are still limited, which limits future practical applications of 2D materials. Therefore, the exploration of new synthesis methods for different 2D materials with high quality is highly desired.

3 Light emission devices
Due to the quantum confinement effect, 2D materials show interesting optical properties, such as large exciton binding energy,16,135,136 spin–valley correlation,137 and layer-dependent band gap,138,139 which enable them to have great potential in light emission devices (LEDs). Although some articles have reviewed LEDs based on 2D materials,140–142due to the rapid development of this area, the recent progress of LEDs remains to be summarized. In this section, we mainly focus on the recent progress of light emission properties and LEDs of 2D materials in the IR region, such as monolayer TMDCs and BP. The general PL properties, electrically driven LEDs, rare earth element doping, light emission enhancement strategies, single photon emitters, and strategies for tunable light emission are presented. Also the utilization of 2D materials in IR lasers is introduced.
3.1 Spontaneous emission
Light emissions from most of the 2D TMDCs range from the visible to the edge of the NIR band.142 Because multilayer TMDCs have indirect band structures, the investigations on spontaneous emission of TMDCs are mostly focused on the single layer form. Monolayer WSe2, MoSe2 and MoTe2 have a band gap in the NIR range, which can be applied in NIR LEDs.138,145 For example, Ruppert et al. carried out a detailed investigation on the photoluminescence (PL) properties of MoTe2 at room temperature.138 The emission from MoTe2 was centered at 1.1 eV, corresponding to 1127 nm (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the PL intensity of the monolayer MoTe2 was about 3 orders larger than that of bulk MoTe2 originating from its direct band structure. Therefore, it is possible to realize LEDs based on monolayer MoTe2. Bie et al. fabricated the first monolayer MoTe2 p–n junction LED.143 Local gates were used to realize the p–n junction, which could achieve electroluminescence (EL) (Fig. 3b). It was confirmed that the strongest emission originated from the p–n junction area where carrier recombination happened. The EL peak was centered at 1175 nm at room temperature, which was consistent with the PL spectrum (Fig. 3c). At low temperature, both PL and EL showed a blue shift with narrowed emission peaks. Room temperature NIR EL (∼800 nm) was also realized in WSe2-based LEDs.146

Complex processes are needed to fabricate the p–n junction LEDs based on monolayer TMDCs, and the performance of the device is also affected by the electrode contact properties. For p–n diode devices, ohmic contact between the electrode and the 2D material is needed for efficient charge injection from the electrode to the 2D material,147 while for Schottky diode luminescence devices, Schottky contact is needed between the 2D material and the electrode.148 Thus, different contact properties are needed for different devices. Very recently, Lien et al. have demonstrated a transient-mode EL device based on TMDCs, which had a simple device structure (Fig. 3d).144 EL could be achieved by applying an AC voltage between the gate and the semiconductor. The emission intensity has a weak dependence on the polarity of the contact or the Schottky barrier height. The EL emission was well consistent with the PL emission (Fig. 3e). The simple structure of the device can facilitate the investigations of TMDCs in LEDs and put forward these to practical applications.
It should be of great significance to extend the emission of TMDCs to the NIR range, e.g., telecommunication band (1550 nm), which will open new applications for 2D TMDC materials. In conventional semiconducting materials, such as GaN, rare earth element doping is a conventional way to realize IR emission,150 which may be applicable in 2D TMDCs. Bai et al. have recently demonstrated that the emission of MoS2 could be extended to 1550 nm after being doped with Er.149 The Er-doped MoS2 showed a PL peak at 800 nm (Fig. 4a) upon excitation with a pump laser of 980 nm. The ladder energy levels introduced by Er provided an additional energy transition process (Fig. 4b), which led to NIR emission at 800 nm. Furthermore, the down-conversion PL emission at a wavelength of 1550 nm was observed at the same time for the Er-doped MoS2 sample (Fig. 4c). Later, the same group reported that Yb and Er co-doped WSe2 showed emission near 1550 nm.151 These outcomes suggest that the doping of rare earth elements in TMDCs can extend the emission spectrum efficiently and provide potential atomically thin materials for on-chip integrated devices in the NIR band.

Because of the atomically thin nature of 2D materials, the emissions from them are relatively weak. Thus, it is necessary to find ways to enhance the emissions. Optical antennas are an effective technological means to enhance the spontaneous emission rate by orders of magnitude and enable the realization of efficient, ultrafast, and nanoscale LEDs.157 In this regard, various kinds of optical antennas are used to enhance light emission in 2D materials. Chen et al. demonstrated the manipulation of the PL intensity of MoSe2 by Au nanoantennas.152 It was found that the adding of a spacer between monolayer MoSe2 and Au nanoantennas was vital for PL enhancement (Fig. 5a). Without a spacer, the PL intensity of monolayer MoSe2 was reduced compared with that of MoSe2 without nanoantennas (Fig. 5b), while the PL intensity was enhanced with the introduction of a spacer (Fig. 5c). The enhancement of the PL intensity was caused by the enhanced local density of states in the emission process, which is referred to as the Purcell effect. Without a spacer, non-radiative channels were created, leading to the decrease of the PL intensity. Moreover, the manipulation of the PL intensity is polarization sensitive due to the dominant local plasmonic resonance along the long antenna axis. A cavity-backed optical slot antenna was used to enhance the spontaneous emission from monolayer WSe2 (Fig. 5d).153 The antenna with matched resonance with WSe2 showed the best PL emission enhancement, of about 700 times compared with the bare WSe2 sample (Fig. 5e). The large increase of the PL intensity was attributed to three factors, including enhanced pumping, collection efficiency, and quantum yield due to the increased spontaneous emission rate. Excluding the contributions from enhanced collection efficiency and enhanced pumping, the spontaneous emission rate enhancement was estimated to be nearly 318 times. The plasmonic nanostructure can enhance both pumping and Purcell effect simultaneously. Wang et al. realized a giant PL enhancement of ∼20000-fold for monolayer WSe2 using the plasmonic nanostructure.154 Monolayer WSe2 was transferred on the Au substrate with trenches (Fig. 5f). The trenches enable the enhancement of the PL emission of WSe2 considerably by lateral gap plasmons. Under the excitation of a 633 nm pump laser, monolayer WSe2 on a nanostructure with a pitch of 200 nm showed a twenty thousand times enhanced behaviour (Fig. 5g). The spontaneous emission can also be enhanced by coupling with Bragg gratings. Duong et al. showed that the PL emission could be enhanced by coupling monolayer WSe2 with a circular Bragg grating cavity (Fig. 5h).155 Approximately 3-fold and 7-fold PL enhancements were observed at room temperature and 77 K, respectively. The enhancement was caused by the Purcell effect and the improved directionality of the out-coupling stream of emitted photons from the symmetric geometrical structure. Recently, Yamaoka et al. have found that the type I heterostructure could be used to enhance the PL of MoSe2 by forming a heterostructure with WSe2.156 Photogenerated carriers in WSe2 could be transferred into the MoTe2 side which can be attributed to the type I band alignment (Fig. 5i), leading to the enhanced PL from MoTe2. The excitation below and above the band gap of WSe2 confirmed that the enhancement arose from the charge transfer from WSe2 to MoTe2 (Fig. 5j). These findings provide ideal choices for enhancing light emission in LEDs.

Recently, it has been found that 2D TMDCs, such as WSe2 and MoSe2, are suitable for single photon emitters,158,159,162–164 which enable their potential applications in quantum devices. For example, He et al. found that monolayer WSe2 exhibited a series of sharp linewidth emissions on the lower energy side of the delocalized exciton emission (Fig. 6a).158 The peak intensities of the sharp lines were ∼500 times larger than that of the delocalized exciton emission. The average line width of the emissions was ∼130 μeV, nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the delocalized exciton emission. Moreover, these sharp line width emissions were highly spatially localized (Fig. 6b). Their single photon emitter characteristic was confirmed by photon antibunching from correlation measurements (Fig. 6c). The single photon emitter was thought to consist of neutral excitons which trapped at anisotropic confining potentials from defects in the monolayer, but the exact reason is still unknown. Apart from the random location of the single photon emitters in monolayer WSe2 triangles, Koperski et al. identified single photon emitting centers located at the edges of WSe2 flakes.159 The single photon emissions had the same energy range, nearly identical excitation spectra (Fig. 6d), and similar large Zeeman effects to localized excitons, which indicated that the optical response of these emitters was inherently linked to the WSe2 monolayer 2D properties. Strain gradients could lead to spectrally and spatially isolated quantum emitters in single- and bilayer WSe2 as demonstrated by Kumar et al.165 The finding suggests that strain engineering is a viable approach to obtain quantum emitters in 2D semiconductors. In this regard, Kern et al. have successfully created single-photon emitters at the nanoscale gap between two gold nanoroads with a single crystalline structure by utilizing the strain effect in monolayer WSe2 (Fig. 6e).160 The specific strain distribution induced in 2D WSe2 results in a potential well formed successfully, where single photon emitters were localized with a precision better than 140 nm. Furthermore, the polarization of the emission can be tuned by tuning the elongation of the well across or along the rod axis, respectively. When transferring 2D materials, the formation of wrinkles is unavoidable, where strain gradients are present at the wrinkles. Hence, Branny et al. could generate single photon emission from the wrinkle regions in monolayer MoSe2.164 For practical applications, single photon emitters with enhanced emission are desired. Combining strain engineering and the plasmonic effect, Tripathi et al. achieved enhanced single photon emission in monolayer WSe2.161 Single layer WSe2 was transferred on the Ag film with a layer of Al2O3. The rough surface of the Ag film could create localized strains in WSe2, which led to single-photon emission (Fig. 6f). The rough surface could be thought to be composed of nanocones, which could act as plasmonic nanoparticles, leading to the enhanced spontaneous emission rate. The decay time down to 100 ps was obtained. For practical applications, electrical excitation is highly preferred. Clark et al. demonstrated electrically driven single photon emission from monolayer WSe2 by utilizing both lateral and vertical van der Waals heterostructure devices.166 At low temperatures (∼5 K) and low current densities, narrow spectral lines corresponding to single photon emission could be observed in the EL spectrum. The single photon emission was verified to originate from spatially localized regions of the WSe2 sample. The emission had a doublet with the characteristic exchange splitting and linearly polarized selection rules. These results suggest that single photon NIR emitters can be realized in 2D materials and have promising applications in quantum devices.

As aforementioned, BP is a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap in the range of 0.3 to 2 eV, depending on the layer number. Consequently, BP is considered as a promising infrared light emitting material. Yang et al. carried out a detailed investigation on the layer number dependent PL spectrum of BP.167 The PL emission showed an obviously layer-dependent characteristic (Fig. 7a). The peak energies for 1 layer to 5 layers were 1.75, 1.29, 0.97, 0.84, and 0.8 eV, respectively. The exciton binding energy is the difference between the electronic band gap and the optical band gap (inset of Fig. 7b). Thus, the exciton binding of single-layer BP on the SiO2/Si substrate was determined to be 0.3 eV. Moreover, by fitting the measured data using a power law, the band gap of bulk BP could be estimated and was 0.295 eV (Fig. 7b). Apart from the layer-dependent band gap of BP, it also showed interesting layer-dependent PL intensity as demonstrated by Zhang et al.168 The peak intensity of PL increased dramatically by decreasing the layer number though thin BP had a reduced amount of the material (Fig. 7c). The result indicated that the quantum efficiency of intrinsic luminescence was highly dependent on the layer number in few-layer BP. The increased band valleys and band maxima in the conduction and valence bands led to the reduced internal quantum efficiency in multilayer BP, resulting in reduced PL intensity. Due to the anisotropic crystal structure of BP, its PL was strongly polarization dependent as confirmed by Li et al.169 Under unpolarized photoexcitation, a strong PL peak could be detected along the armchair direction, and almost no PL could be detected along the zigzag direction (Fig. 7d). The PL intensity exhibited a cos2θ pattern as the light polarization angle θ varied (Fig. 7e). The polarization dependent PL resulted from the special symmetry of BP. To fully understand the optical properties of BP, the PL of thick BP is worth to be studied. Very recently, Chen et al. have carried out a PL study on BP with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 46 nm.170 With the increase of the thickness, the emission peak of BP showed a red shift, indicating the decreased band gap of BP (Fig. 7f). The band gap was decreased from 0.441 eV (4.5 nm, ∼8 layers) to 0.308 eV (46 nm, ∼91 layers) (Fig. 7g). Furthermore, the PL intensity of BP was strong enough, which was only seven times less bright than that of an InAs multiple quantum well at 80 K, indicating that BP is a promising material in tunable MIR light emitting and lasing applications.

Tuning the emission of 2D materials is very interesting in tunable optoelectronics. Various kinds of methods are used to tune the emission from 2D materials, such as alloying, strain engineering, electrical tuning, magnetic tuning, etc. Alloying is a common method used to tune the band gap of 2D materials, leading to the modulation of PL, especially in TMDCs.171,176–181 For instance, Yu et al. investigated the PL properties of the single-layer WSe2(1−x)Te2x (x = 0–0.6) alloy.171 Since WTe2 was metallic, it led to the achievement of a wider tunable range of the band gap. The PL peak of the monolayer WSe2(1−x)Te2x (x = 0–0.6) alloy shifted from 742 nm (pure WSe2) to 861 nm (for x = 0.6), suggesting good tenability of alloying (Fig. 8a). Because the WSe2(1−x)Te2x alloy underwent a phase transition from semiconductor to metal (2H to 1Td phase), no PL could be observed for x > 0.6. Due to the ultra-thin characteristic of 2D materials, their band gaps are very sensitive to strain. Thus, strain is used to tune the emission of 2D materials.172,182–184 Aslan et al. found that the band gaps of single-layer Mo0.91W0.09Te2 and MoTe2 were reduced under uniaxial tensile strain, leading to a red shift of the PL peaks.172 Specifically, the PL peak of Mo0.91W0.09Te2 shifted from 1.09 eV to 1.02 eV (0% strain to 2.3% strain or −30 meV per % strain), and the PL peak of MoTe2 shifted from 1.08 eV at 0% strain to 1.01 eV at 2.1% strain or −33 meV per % strain (Fig. 8b). Because 2D materials have large exciton binding energy and the carrier density in 2D materials can be well controlled by electrical gating, it is possible to form charged excitons by tuning the carrier density in 2D materials by electrical gating, leading to tunable PL.32,185,186 For example, Yang et al. found that monolayer MoTe2 showed interesting excitonic emission properties and the PL emission could be modulated from positively charged (X+), neutral (X0), and negatively charged (X−) excitonic emission by an electrostatic force (Fig. 8c).32 In addition, Pei et al. found that the oxygen defect related emission from monolayer BP located at the NIR region could be tuned by electrical gating (Fig. 8d).173 Monolayer TMDCs show an interesting valley Zeeman effect; their PL emission can be well controlled by an external magnetic field.174,187,188 Arora et al. studied the valley Zeeman effect in single-layer MoTe2 and found that the PL emission could be controlled by an external magnetic field (Fig. 8e).174 Jiang et al. have recently found that bilayer MoTe2 still showed the Zeeman effect though bilayer MoTe2 had inversion symmetry (Fig. 8f).175 They attributed the Zeeman effect to spin–valley-layer locking in bilayer MoTe2. The interesting tenability of the IR emission from 2D materials enables their potential applications in tunable optoelectronic devices.

3.2 Laser
Since the ruby laser was invented in 1960, it has attracted considerable attention due to its wide applications. In particular, TMDCs and BP emerged as gain materials due to their advantageous physical and chemical properties, including broadband absorption, large exciton-binding energy, and ultralow lasing threshold, which enable these two materials to show significant potential in micro/nano lasers, especially on-chip integrated lasers.
The first nanoscale laser system based on 2D materials was reported by Wu et al.189 Monolayer WSe2 was applied on the surface of a pre-fabricated GaP photonic crystal cavity (PCC) in order to couple the emission from WSe2 into the PCC (Fig. 9a). For effective coupling, the PCC was designed to have a resonant wavelength around 740 nm to match the spontaneous emission of the WSe2 monolayer. The PCC with a very high Q-factor (∼104) was necessary to improve the Purcell factor significantly so as to realize lasing. In this regard, lasing at a reduced excitation threshold power was achieved at 80 K (Fig. 9b). The laser emission was centered at 739.7 nm with a line width of 0.3 nm. Due to the polarization of the fundamental mode cavity, the laser emission was polarized along the y direction. The estimated Q-factor of the PCC after the application of WSe2 was ∼1300 at room temperature and recovered to ∼2500 at low temperature, which accounted for the lasing at low temperatures. However, the low temperature operation is not desired for practical applications. In order to realize room temperature lasing, a high room temperature Q-factor optical cavity is needed. Si based cavities can have high Q-factors,195 but they could absorb most of the light below their band gap. Therefore, the spontaneous emission energy of the gain medium should be smaller than that of the band gap of Si. Li et al. chose the MoTe2 monolayer as the gain material with a PL emission peak near ∼1.1 eV, which was about 50 meV below the Si band gap.190 Thus, the light absorption by Si was negligible. A Si nanobeam cavity with a high Q-factor was used as the optical cavity (Fig. 9c). Two prominent lasing peaks centered at 1052 nm and 1166 nm were observed at room temperature (Fig. 9d), corresponding to the two modes of the nanobeam cavity. A high Q-factor of 5603 and a large Purcell factor of 76 for the second mode were estimated, which could account for the room temperature lasing. The use of the Si cavity not only provided a high Q-factor, but also showed the possibility for future on-chip integrated Si photonics. Lasing in the technological band, such as the band for optical communications, is important for practical applications. Fang et al. used multilayer MoTe2 as the gain medium and a Si photonic crystal L3 nanocavity to achieve room temperature lasing at 1305 nm (Fig. 9e), which is the “O band” for optical communications.191 Later, Husko et al. achieved single-mode lasing in the telecommunication band of 1.55 μm (C band) at room temperature when few-layer BP was used as the gain medium.192 The emission length could be well tuned from 1490 to 1560 nm (Fig. 9f) by tuning the geometry of the Si photonic crystal. Apart from the Si PCC, Huang et al. demonstrated that distributed Bragg reflector mirrors could be used as an optical cavity to achieve room temperature lasing using BP as the gain medium (Fig. 9g).193 Under optical pumping, lasing at ∼3765 nm was realized (Fig. 9h). For further expanding the lasing wavelength of TMDCs, Liu et al. used the MoS2/WSe2 heterostructure as the gain medium (Fig. 9i).194 Under light excitation, lasing could be achieved at 1122.5 nm at 5 K (Fig. 9j). Room temperature lasing could also be realized at 1128 nm due to the large exciton binding energy. Table 2 lists the laser parameters for better comparison of the 2D material based lasers. The achievements suggest the potential of 2D materials in on-chip integrated optics.

4. Modulator
Owing to the superior properties of 2D materials, such as atomic layer thickness, broadband optical absorption and response, strong light–material interaction, high nonlinearity and so on, they possess great potential for high performance optical modulators. Two previous papers have provided comprehensive reviews on 2D materials, especially on graphene.196,197 Here, we summarize the recent advances of optical modulators based on semiconducting 2D materials in the IR spectrum region. According to the modulation approaches, the section is divided into three parts: all optical approach, electro-optic approach, and other approaches.
4.1 All optical approach
The main modulation mechanisms of the all optical approach modulator based on 2D materials rely on saturable absorption and the optical Kerr effect.197 In this section, we mainly review the recent investigation of modulators based on saturable absorption, such as Q-switched and mode-locked lasers. Since the first saturable absorber (SA) was invented in 1960 and applied in the Nd:glass laser successfully,198 numerous types of SAs have been developed based on crystals and semiconductors. However, these SAs suffer from drawbacks of high cost, complicated preparation process, and limited range of optical response.199 2D materials are mechanically robust and can be firmly integrated into glass fibers, planar waveguides, and optical microcavities. Also, 2D materials show saturable light absorption in a broad spectrum range. Thus, 2D materials have great potential in Q-switched and mode-locked lasers acting as SAs.
The first 2D material based SA is graphene reported by Bao et al. in 2009, which was used in a mode-locked laser.203 Since then, various 2D materials have been used as SAs in mode-locked lasers and Q-switched lasers. The topological insulator, Bi2Te3, was found to exhibit SA behavior when placed in a 1550 nm laser beam by Bernard et al.204 Later, Zhao et al. confirmed that Bi2Te3 was a very-high-modulation-depth SA (up to 95%) and achieved the mode-locked laser using it as a SA (Fig. 10a).200 The mode-locked fiber laser operated at the telecomunication band (∼1558 nm) with a pulse duration of 1.86 ps and a repetition rate of 1.21 MHz. The use of BP as a SA for Q-switched and mode-locked lasers was initially demonstrated by Chen et al.201 For mode-locked fiber lasers, BP with a low modulation depth (8.1%) and saturable intensity (6.55 MW cm−2) was used as a SA. BP with a high modulation depth (18.55%) and saturation intensity (10.74 MW cm2) was necessary for Q-switched fiber lasers. The mode-locked laser could be operated at a central wavelength of 1571.45 nm and with a 3 dB bandwidth of 2.9 nm (Fig. 10b); meanwhile, the Q-switched laser was operated at a central wavelength of 1562.87 nm and with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.2 nm (Fig. 10c). Traditional TMDCs, such as MoS2, are also good SAs, which are widely used in mode-locked and Q-switched lasers. For example, Zhang et al. reported that a mode locked laser based on few-layer MoS2 allowed the generation of a stable mode-locked laser pulse with a central wavelength of 1054.3 nm, a pulse duration of 800 ps and with a 3 dB bandwidth of 2.7 nm.205 Yan et al. found that MoTe2 could act as a SA in 2.0 μm solid-state Q-switched pulse laser generation.206 The use of NMDCs as SAs in mode-locked and Q-switched lasers has also been reported recently. For instance, Tao et al. reported the use of the PtSe2 film as a SA for a passively mode-locked Nd:LuVO4 laser.207 The mode-locked laser had a central wavelength of 1066.6 nm with a 3 dB bandwidth of 0.1 nm. These results suggest that semiconducting 2D materials can be applied in mode-locked and Q-switched lasers in a wide spectrum range with excellent performance.

A broad band SA is expected in practical applications due to the facility of operating at different wavelengths. Because the band gap of BP is in the range of 0.3–2 eV, it should have a wide band saturable absorption range. In fact, the use of BP as a SA in mode-locked lasers operating at different wavelengths has been reported. Sotor et al. realized a mode-locked fiber laser operating at 1.91 μm with a pulse width of 739 fs.208 Later, with BP as the SA, mode-locked fiber lasers operated at 2.8 μm and 3.5 μm were reported by Qin et al.209,210 Furthermore, Q-switched lasers using BP as a SA operating in the range from the visible to MIR range (Fig. 10d) were achieved by Zhang et al.202 Although the band gap of MoS2 is in the visible range, it can also act as a broad band SA by defect engineering. In this regard, Wang et al. realized a passively Q-switched laser at 1.06, 1.42, and 2.1 μm using MoS2 as the SA (Fig. 10e).49
The successful use of 2D materials as SAs in Q-switched and mode-locked lasers suggests the favorable saturable absorption property and the broad band response behavior of 2D materials.
4.2 Electro-optic approach
The electro-optic approach is used to control the light properties by an electrical field, and is one of the most used modulation methods, which is mainly based on the quantum-confined Stark effect, Franz–Keldysh effect, Pockels effect and Kerr effect. In this part, the recent advances of electro-optic modulation based on BP and TMDCs in the IR band are reviewed.
The possibility of BP for usage in electro-optic modulation in the MIR range was predicted first by theory. Lin et al. demonstrated that the application of an out-of-plane electrical field might lead to red, blue, or bidirectional shift in the absorption edge of BP theoretically.211 This way, the absorption of light in BP could be tuned by an electrical field (Fig. 11a and b). Cao et al. found that the band structure anisotropy of bilayer BP could be tuned by gating from DFT calculation.212 The gate-controllable band structure results in a switchable optical linear dichroism, that is the polarization of the lowest-energy optical transitions which is tunable by gating (Fig. 11c). Later, the possibility of the electro-optic modulation of BP was confirmed by experiments. Whitney et al. showed that the optical transmittance of few-layer BP can be modulated more than 2% (Fig. 11d and e), which was caused by the shift of the optical band gap.213 The shift of the band gap was attributed to the combination of the Burstein–Moss effect and the quantum confined Franz–Keldysh effect. A similar phenomenon was observed by Peng et al.214 The Stark effect can also be used in BP based electro-optic modulators. Liu et al. found that the modulation of the band gap of BP can be as high as 35.5% upon the injection of electrons (Fig. 11f).80 The compensation of the existing defect-induced holes by the injected electrons led to a large band gap modulation. The giant gate-controlled Stark effect could find usage in electro-optic modulation.

2D TMDCs have shown gate-controlled nonlinear optical response, such as electrical control of the second-harmonic generation (SHG) in monolayer WSe2,217 charge induced SHG in bilayer WSe2,218etc. Also, utilizing the electrical tunable exciton properties of monolayer MoS2, the Fano resonance of the MoS2/Au nanodisk hybrid system could be tuned by gating.219 However, these operations are in the visible range. Recently, the tuning of the carrier density, i.e. the refractive index, by electric gating was used in electro-optic modulators in the IR range. Datta et al. have reported a giant electro-refractive modulation of monolayer WS2 embedded in photonic structures in the IR range.215 A Mach–Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) structure was used and WS2 was deposited on one arm. The carrier density in WS2 could be tuned by electrical gating. Based on the structure, the light transmittance across the MZI structure could be well controlled by electrical gating. The estimated change in the refractive index for WS2 at 1544 nm was up to 3%. Later, Amin et al. reported a novel electro-optic modulator based on the heterogeneous integration of MoS2 onto a Si photonic microring resonator (MRR).216 A ∼2 dB modulation for 4 V applied bias near 1559 nm was achieved, which corresponded to 20 mV dB−1 when normalized to an equivalent gate oxide of 10 nm.
The interesting electro-optic modulation phenomena in BP and TMDCs suggest a bright future in practical applications.
4.3 Other approaches
Besides the aforementioned approaches, recent investigations have demonstrated other optical modulation approaches based on 2D materials, such as acousto-optic approach, magneto-optic approach, thermo-optic approach, mechano-optic approach, etc.196,197 The diverse modulation methods provided by semiconducting 2D materials indicate their diverse optical properties and the bright application potential in optical modulators.
5. Photodetectors
A photodetector is used to convert light signals into electrical signals, which is an important device in integrated optics. The strong light–matter interaction of 2D materials makes them suitable for light detection applications. The photoresponse mechanisms for 2D materials typically include photovoltaic, photogating, photobolometric, and photo-thermoelectric effects.220–222 For semiconducting 2D materials, the photovoltaic effect is the most important effect for photodetection because of the fast response of this effect. The figures of merit, which are used to evaluate the performance of a photodetector, are the photoresponsivity, the specific detectivity, the response spectrum, the response time, the external quantum efficiency, the photogain, and the noise equivalent power.220 Though there are some excellent reviews on 2D material photodetectors,139,220,223,224 it is necessary to provide a comprehensive review on IR photodetectors due to the fast development of the 2D material area. Here, we will first discuss the IR photodetection performance of some typical 2D materials with free space configuration, and then discuss waveguide-based photodetectors and the possible applications in optical communications. Finally the application of 2D IR photodetectors in imaging is discussed.
5.1 Photodetection performance of 2D semiconductor materials in the IR region
TMDCs are the most intensively investigated semiconducting 2D materials in photodetectors due to the strong light–matter interaction originating from van Hove singularities.48 For IR detection, the band gap of the material should be located in the IR region for strong light absorption. Traditional TMDCs, such as MoX2 and WX2 (X = S, Se, Te), have a band gap in the range of 1.0–2.1 eV46 and show promising applications in NIR photodetection. MoS2 has a band gap of 1.2–1.9 eV depending on the layer number and the band gap reduces with the increase of the layer number.227 In this regard, multi-layer MoS2 is suitable for IR detection due to the suitable band gap. For example, Gong et al. have reported that a multi-layer MoS2 vertical Schottky junction photodetector showed a wide detection range from the visible range to 1000 nm.228 Huo et al. have also reported that an out-of-plane multi-layer MoS2 PN homojunction had a broadband response up to 1000 nm.229 The cutoff wavelength of multilayer MoS2 is limited to 1000 nm, which limits its application in optical communications where the common light source used has a wavelength of 1550 nm. Researchers tried different methods to extend to the cutoff wavelength of MoS2. The band gap of MoS2 can be reduced under a vertical electrical field.52 Therefore, the electrical field can be used to expand the detection range of MoS2. Wang et al. have found that the detection spectrum range of multi-layer MoS2 can be expanded from 900 nm to 1.55 μm by ferroelectric polarization as shown in Fig. 12a.225 The reduced band gap under electric polarization was thought to be the possible reason for the expanded response spectrum range. Defect engineering is another efficient way to tune the band gap of MoS2. By introducing S vacancies, Xie et al. realized an ultra-broad band (445 to 2717 nm) MoS2 photodetector as shown in Fig. 12b.51 The responsivity at 2717 nm is still high, which is 28.9 mA W−1. The reduced band gap with the introduction of S vacancies was the reason for the broad band response spectrum. Later, the same group reported that the band gap can be reduced into a longer wavelength by the introduction of Mo vacancies.50 They found that a photodetector based on the MoS2.15 thin film deposited by pulsed laser deposition showed an ultra-broad response spectrum, from 3 to 9.5 μm as shown in Fig. 12c. At 7.79 μm, the responsivity is as high as 21.8 mA W−1. The injection of hot electrons can also be used to expand the response range of MoS2. Wang et al. have investigated a hot electron-based photodetector consisting of bilayer MoS2 integrated with a plasmonic antenna array.230 The response range of the photodetector can be expanded into the NIR range, the photoresponsivity at 1070 nm can reach 5.2 A W−1. All the results indicate that MoS2 is suitable for IR light detection, even in the LIR range.

Compared with MoS2, MoTe2 is more suitable to be used in IR detection because of its suitable band gap. The band gap of monolayer MoSe2 is 1.1 eV, and reduces to 0.8 eV for bulk MoSe2.138,231 Huang et al. have reported the IR detection performance of a mechanically exfoliated few-layer MoTe2 based photodetector for the first time.231 The photodetector showed a wide response spectrum from visible light to 1550 nm. Furthermore, the responsivity at 1060 nm is up to 24 mA W−1 with a high specific detectivity of 1.3 × 109 Jones. Generally, the stable phase of MoTe2 is the 2H phase. As a result, the investigation on other phases of MoTe2 is scarce. Recently, Lai et al. have found that the Weyl semimetal Td-MoTe2 showed interesting photodetection performance.226 A metal–MoTe2–metal photodetector was fabricated and it demonstrated broadband responses from 532 nm to 10.6 μm (Fig. 12d). In addition, the detection range should expand to FIR, even to the THz regime due to the gapless nature of Td-MoTe2. Furthermore, the Td-MoTe2 photodetector showed anisotropic response to light polarization (Fig. 12e and f).
Recently, NMDCs, such as PtSe2 and PdSe2, with a narrow band gap and good stability in air, have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. Yu et al. have found that the PtSe2 monolayer has a band gap of 1.2 eV, and bilayer PtSe2 has a band gap of 0.3 eV, which are suitable for IR photodetection.62 Upon further increasing the layer number, PtSe2 becomes semimetal. Both single layer and bilayer PtSe2 showed good photoresponse, but single layer PtSe2 showed no response to LIR light, while bilayer PtSe2 showed decent response to LIR light (Fig. 13a and b) due to the reduced band gap of bilayer PtSe2. The photoresponsivities of monolayer PtSe2 for 632 nm and 1.47 μm were 0.9 and 0.15 A W−1, respectively. The photoresponsivities of bilayer PtSe2 in the visible and NIR ranges were about 6.25 and 5.5 A W−1, respectively, which were higher than that of monolayer PtSe2. Furthermore, the photoresponsivity for LIR light was 4.5 A W−1, corresponding to an internal gain of 17.5. The response speed of bilayer PtSe2 was very fast (at the millisecond level), independent of light wavelength. As the LIR (10.0 μm, corresponding to a photon energy of 0.124 eV) light photon energy is still below the band gap of the perfect bilayer PtSe2, the broadband response of bilayer PtSe2 was thought to originate from the defect induced band gap decrease. Through defect engineering, which was the introduction of Se vacancies, the band gap of PtSe2 reduced with the increase of Se vacancies which was confirmed by both experimental results and theoretical calculations (Fig. 13c and d). PdSe2 based photodetectors showed similar high IR performance to PtSe2. Long et al. have reported that a multilayer PdSe2 photodetector showed excellent IR detection performance with a very high responsivity of 42.1 A W−1 at 10.6 μm (Fig. 13e and f).232 Due to the narrow band gap of PdSe2, the photodetector had a high dark noise current, which remained a major limitation of the photodetector. In order to reduce the high dark noise, they fabricated a PdSe2/MoS2 PN junction photodetector. Satisfactory rectification electrical behavior and excellent photoresponse to 10.6 μm light were observed (Fig. 13g). Consistent with the PdSe2 photodetector, the PdSe2/MoS2 PN junction showed the same wide spectrum response from the visible range to 10.6 μm (Fig. 13h). The responsivity at 10.6 μm was ∼4 A W−1, which was smaller than that of the PdSe2 photodetector. However, the detectivity at 10.6 μm was 8.21 × 109 Jones for the PN junction, which was higher than that of the PdSe2 photodetector (1.10 × 109) due to the reduced dark current. The outstanding LIR photodetection performance of PtSe2 and PdSe2 signifies a bright future for applications in LIR optoelectronic devices.

BP is the most intensively studied 2D material in IR applications due to its excellent optoelectronic properties and suitable band gap. Initial study showed that a few-layer BP (8 nm) photodetector presented a wide spectrum response (visible region up to 940 nm) with a decent response speed (1 ms) (Fig. 14a and b).235 Later, researchers found that the detection range of BP was wide from visible to MIR light with excellent performance.76,236,237 For instance, Yuan et al. have found that a multilayer BP photodetector showed a bandwidth (∼400 nm to 3750 nm) polarization-sensitive photoresponse.76 The strong intrinsic linear dichroism arising from the in-plane optical anisotropy of BP led to the polarization sensitivity of the BP photodetector. Multilayer BP has a band gap larger than 0.33 eV and approaches it as the thickness increases. As a result, the cutoff wavelength of multilayer BP is limited to ∼3.76 μm. In order to extend the detection range of BP, various methods were used. Recently, Chen et al. have found that the photoresponse in a 5 nm thick BP photodetector could be dynamically extended from 3.7 to beyond 7 μm under a vertical electric field.238 The photoresponsivity of the BP photodetector was good at low temperature with a peak responsivity of 518, 30, and 2.2 mA W−1 at 3.4, 5, and 7.7 μm, respectively, at 77 K. However, the low work temperature is a big block for the practical application of this method. By forming an alloy with As, the band gap of BP can be well tuned with a cutoff wavelength extending to 8.27 μm.84 Amani et al. have studied the photodetection performance of the BP-As alloy (b-AsP) and have found that the cutoff wavelength varied from 3.9 to 4.6 μm depending on the chemical composition.239 b-AsP with a 91% As photodetector showed a high specific detectivity of 2.4 × 1010 Jones at a wavelength of ∼4.2 μm. Long et al. have shown that the band gap of b-AsP with 17% P was about 0.15 eV (corresponding to a wavelength of 8.27 μm), which was suitable for MIR light detection.234 They showed that the b-AsP phototransistor was sensitive to light with a wavelength of 8.05 μm (Fig. 14c). The MIR (2.4 to 8.05 μm) photoresponse of the b-AsP photodetector indicated that the responsivity decreased slightly with the increase of wavelength of light, which was due to decreased optical absorption around the band edges (Fig. 14d). Furthermore, they fabricated the b-AsP/MoS2 PN junction to reduce the dark current noise. The PN junction showed good rectification behavior and excellent photodetection performance (Fig. 14e). Moreover, the room temperature noise equivalent power of the PN junction at the MIR range was better than that of the b-AsP phototransistor (Fig. 14f), indicating the enhanced performance of the heterostructure device. In order to realize a stable b-AsP photodetector, the BN/b-AsP/BN structure was used by Yuan et al.240 They found that the BP sandwiched b-As0.83P0.17 photodetector showed broad band response (3.4–7.7 μm) with excellent stability in air. When forming an alloy with carbon, a new material, called b-PC, showed excellent optoelectronic properties.113 Tan et al. have demonstrated a high performance IR photodetector based on b-PC.241 The b-PC photodetector showed a peak responsivity of 2163 A W−1 and a NEP of 1.3 fW Hz−1/2 at 2004 nm.

In 2017, Wu et al. found that 2D Bi2O2Se has a band gap of 0.8 eV (corresponding to a wavelength of 1550 nm) and a high room temperature electron mobility of 450 cm2 V−1 s−1.90 Accordingly, it can be used in high performance NIR photodetectors. Li et al. have investigated the photoresponse of chemical vapor deposition synthesized Bi2O2Se at 808 nm.235 They found that the Bi2O2Se photodetector showed excellent photoresponse with a high responsivity of 0.75 A W−1, a specific detectivity of ∼6.5 × 1010 Jones, and a fast response speed of 4.6 ms. In addition, the responsivity and specific detectivity can be improved to 6.5 A W−1 and 8.3 × 1011 Jones, respectively, at 230 K (Fig. 14g). With a thicker Bi2O2Se flake, a high photoresponsivity of 19.7 A W−1 was demonstrated. Besides, the Bi2O2Se photodetector showed excellent stability when configured on a flexible substrate (Fig. 14h). A more deeper investigation on the IR sensitivity behaviors was carried out by Yin et al.242 They found that the few-layer Bi2O2Se photodetector showed a broad-spectrum response, from the visible range to 1700 nm. Furthermore, the photodetector showed excellent performance with a high photoresponsivity of 65 A W−1 and a high specific detectivity of 3.0 × 109 Jones at 1200 nm. Even at the conventional optical communication wavelength (1550 nm), the photodetector also had a photoresponsivity of 0.1 A W−1. What's more, the photodetector had a very fast response (1 ps) at 820 nm, which corresponded to a material-limited bandwidth of 500 GHz, indicating a bright future for its applications in optical communications.
Other semiconducting 2D materials with a narrow band gap, such as TiS3,243 InSe,244–247 In2Se3,248 and In2Te3,249 also showed broad band photodetection with the response spectrum covering the NIR region. For instance, broad band response from 370–1064 nm with the highest photoresponsivity of 44 A W−1 at 635 nm for an In2Te3 photodetector was demonstrated.249 Various kinds of van der Waals heterostructures were also developed for high performance IR detection. For example, Zhang et al. have reported that the interlayer transition MoTe2/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructure can be used to detect 1550 nm IR light.250 Xue et al. have found that the MoSe2/WSe2 van der Waals heterojunction exhibited high sensitivity photodetection (127 mA W−1) and the operation wavelength could be extended up to the telecommunication band (1550 nm).251 As the interlayer band gap was larger than 0.8 eV, band bending was thought to be the reason for the IR detection. The BP/MoS2 photodiode showed bias-selectable polarization-resolved photodetection performance with a high room temperature external quantum efficiency of 35% and a high specific detectivity of 1.1 × 1010 Jones in the MIR region.252 For better comparison, the figures of merit of some of the typical IR photodetectors are listed in Table 3. According to the discussion, semiconducting 2D materials have already shown high performance IR detection, which makes them suitable for IR applications, such as optical communications, imaging, etc.

5.2 Waveguide-based photodetectors
On-chip integration of optical components is very important for the realization of compact and efficient optical systems, which is crucial for the miniaturization of optical communication systems.257 Traditional IR photodetectors have a free-space geometry, which restricts the integration with other photonic devices. In this regard, the integration of 2D material-based photodetectors with other optical components, such as waveguides, is important. Because of the van der Waals nature of 2D materials, the integration of 2D material photodetectors with conventional Si photonics is facile.23 For example, Huang et al. have realized an integration of Si-on-insulator waveguides with BP photodetectors.237 They investigated the spectral response from 3.68 to 4.03 μm. The integrated BP detector showed excellent photodetection performance with a responsivity of 23 A W−1 at 3.68 μm and 2 A W−1 at 4 μm and a noise equivalent power less than 1 nW Hz−1/2. For optical communications, the photodetector should have a fast response, on the order of nanoseconds or less, because of the high modulation rate of the signals. Youngblood et al. have demonstrated that a BP photodetector integrated with a Si waveguide can be used in optical communications (C-band, 1.55 μm) due to the fast response of the BP photodetector.255 The device structure they used is shown in Fig. 15a, few-layer BP was capped on the Si waveguide, and a layer of Al2O3 (20 nm) was deposited on BP. A graphene top gate electrode was used to tune the conduction type and carrier density in BP, which can modulate the photodetection mechanism and sensitivity of the BP photodetector. The work mode of the BP photodetector can be controlled by the top gate: the photovoltaic mode when the BP channel was nearly intrinsic (Vg = −8 V) and the bolometric mode when BP was heavily n-doped. A fast photoresponse was observed when the BP photodetector was in the photovoltaic mode (Fig. 15b). The roll-off frequency was 2.8 GHz, which was thought to be limited by both the RC bandwidth of the device and the bandwidth of the measurement instruments. Eye-diagram measurement with a data rate of 3 Gbit s−1 was used to show the possibility in the application of optical communications (Fig. 15c). The completely open eye suggested that the BP photodetector can be readily used for practical optical communication. As the response speed of the BP photodetector was limited by the RC constant of the circuit, the determination of the intrinsic speed of a BP photodetector is more important to show the limited speed in optical communications. Later, the same group demonstrated that the intrinsic bandwidth of a BP photodetector can be as high as 9 GHz using nonlinear photoresponse with ultrafast pump–probe measurements.258 MoTe2 also has potential in optical communications. Ma et al. showed that a MoTe2 waveguide photodetector (Fig. 15d) can be used in O-band (1.31 μm) optical communications.256 The MoTe2 waveguide photodetector showed a responsivity of 23 mA W−1 under 3 V bias at a wavelength of 1.31 μm. The normalized photocurrent-to-dark current ratio was up to 600 mW−1, which was far better than graphene-based photodetectors. The MoTe2 waveguide photodetector has a 3 dB cutoff frequency that exceeded 500 MHz, indicating the fast response of the detector (Fig. 15e). The eye diagram with a bit error ratio of 3.5 × 10–3 at 1 Gbit s−1 (Fig. 15f) indicates that the MoTe2 waveguide photodetector can be used in optical communications.

The integration of the 2D IR photodetector with Si photonics and the fast response at the optical communication wavelength suggest a bright future for on-chip 2D IR photodetectors in optical communications.
5.3 IR imaging
One of the most important applications of photodetectors is image sensing, which is closely related with our daily life, such as camera, drive recorder, monitor, etc. More importantly, IR image sensors can be used in night vision instruments, which have significant applications for military use. Due to the broadband spectrum response of semiconducting 2D materials, they are suitable to be used in IR imaging. Engel et al. have used a multilayer BP photodetector as a point-like detector to obtain high-contrast images both in the visible and infrared spectral regimes (Fig. 16a–c).259 Diffraction-limited optical images with submicron resolution were obtained (Fig. 16b). The experimental resolution for visible light (532 nm) is 270 ± 5 nm, while the experimental resolution for IR light (1550 nm) is 720 ± 15 nm. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use a BP photodetector for the acquisition of diffraction-limited images both in the visible and infrared spectral range (Fig. 16c). Later, Miao et al. have demonstrated the use of a few-layer BP single-pixel photodetector for NIR imaging applications.260 The imaging was achieved by combining the BP photodetector with a digital micromirror device to encode and subsequently reconstruct the image based on a compressive sensing algorithm (Fig. 16d). By this method, infrared laser spot images with 32 × 32 and 64 × 64 pixels were realized (Fig. 16e–g). The demonstration of Bi2O2Se photodetectors for imaging in single-pixel and 3 × 5 multi-pixel array forms has been carried out by Yin et al.242 They showed that good images can be obtained with light sources with wavelengths of 1550, 1310, 1200, and 665 nm. For practical applications, focal plane array IR detectors are highly desirable. Although the demonstration of a graphene-quantum dot image sensor has been reported,261 the utilization of semiconducting 2D materials for large arrays has not been reported yet.

6. Outlook and future opportunities
The excellent optoelectronic properties of 2D materials beyond graphene have already shown promising applications in light emitting devices, modulators, and photodetectors in the IR region (Fig. 17). However, there remain challenges and opportunities in front of researchers.

1. On-chip integration of 2D materials with the conventional photonic structure
The integration of 2D materials with the conventional photonic structure involves the transfer of 2D materials on the target photonic structure. The widely used wet-transfer technique unambiguously introduces water and organic residues on the photonic device, which can affect the performance of the final devices and lead to the lack of reliability of the devices. Dry transfer can transfer 2D materials on the target substrate without introducing any impurity to the target photonic structure, which is promising for on-chip integration. However, large-scale dry transfer of 2D materials is still a challenge. The development of a cost-effective and facile dry transfer technique is urgent for on-chip integration of 2D material based photonic devices.
2. Regarding LEDs, the external quantum efficiency of most of the LEDs is still very low compared with commercial LEDs. The development of high external quantum efficiency devices is highly preferred. In addition, the finite light emission wavelengths are far from practical applications. For example, the optical communication band and the atmosphere window light source are still lacking. Furthermore, electrically driven LEDs are still lacking. Developing new kinds of LEDs with different configurations are strongly desired in the future.
3. Though single-photon emitters are thought to originate from the defects in 2D materials, the physical reason, their atomic structure, and the associated excitation processes of the emission are still unknown. Much effort has to be made to achieve room temperature NIR single-photon emitters and expand the emission wavelength into MIR, and even FIR.
4. For optical modulators, the long operation stability is still a problem. The endurance of 2D materials under high light intensity should be solved or an alternative device structure should be used to reduce the irradiation damage by light. The semiconducting 2D materials used in electro-optic modulators are very limited. Explorations of new 2D materials in electro-optic modulators are needed.
5. Photodetectors in optical communications
Though the demonstration of a fast response of 2D material waveguide photodetectors has been realized, the application of the 2D photodetectors in optical communications is still a big challenge. Before it can be used in optical communications, several problems have to be overcome. First, the stability problem. The currently demonstrated fast photodetectors are based on BP and MoTe2. BP is known as an unstable material in air, which will degrade very fast. MoTe2, a type of TMDC, also suffers from instability in air though it is better than BP. For practical optical communications, the high stability of 2D materials should be solved. Second, the response speed is still limited. For high speed communications, materials with a higher response speed are preferred.
6. Imaging
Currently, the demonstration of an imaging sensor using 2D material is a point photodetector, which cannot meet the practical demand for imaging. For imaging, photodetector arrays are highly desired. However, making photodetector arrays requires a 2D material film with high quality and good uniformity. In this regard, the development of synthesis methods towards a wafer-scale, high quality, and homogeneous film is urgent. Furthermore, for thermal IR imaging, photodetector arrays with longer wavelength detection range and high sensitivity are needed.
With the continuing research on IR optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials, the on-chip integration of 2D materials in a photonic system, including a light source, a light modulator, and a photodetector, is anticipated. New materials, new mechanisms, and new processing techniques will emerge in the near future.
