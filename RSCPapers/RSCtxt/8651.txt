    , Accepted 7th September 2017First published on 7th September 2017AbstractImmobilization of earth-abundant water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) on carbon supports to produce functional electrodes for electrochemical water splitting is a crucial approach for future clean energy production. Herein we report the non-covalent immobilization of a pyrene-bearing cobalt(II) Schiff base complex (2) on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to form a hybrid anode for electrocatalytic water oxidation. The 2/MWCNT anode displayed excellent catalytic activity and durability in neutral aqueous solution, and a catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 was achieved at 1.15 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), corresponding to a low overpotential of 330 mV. A Tafel slope of 96 mV per decade was obtained. The Faradaic efficiency of oxygen evolution was more than 90% by bulk electrolysis measurement. After bulk electrolysis, the hybrid anode characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that complex 2 decomposed to form heterogeneous cobalt hydroxides and the cobalt hydroxides should be true catalytic active species, which are responsible for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.
Introduction
A combination of growing energy demand and increasingly severe environmental pollution has stimulated considerable interest in the development of efficient energy conversion and storage systems.1 Hydrogen energy is an ideal alternative energy because it possesses a high calorific value and the formation of water as its sole combustion product.2 Electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen gas is a green and promising approach to store non-storable electrical power into chemical bonds.3 However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the determinant of the realization of efficient water splitting, as it requires a large overpotential, sluggish 4e−/4H+ transfer process as well as high activation energy to form OO bonds.4 Therefore, it is essential to rationally design and synthesize highly efficient, stable and low-cost WOCs to promote the reaction kinetics and thus improve the energy efficiency. To date, many transition metal-based homogeneous WOCs and semiconductor-based heterogeneous WOCs have been reported.5 Among them, although inherently less stable than heterogeneous catalysts, molecular WOCs have attracted considerable attention, due to their tunable synthetic modification that enables the study of structure–activity relationships, and their facility in mechanistic and kinetic studies. However, the use of molecular WOCs in homogeneous solution suffers from several problems, including the diffusion limitation of active species, and the difficulty in recycling and reusing them, which significantly hamper their practical application.
The stability and recyclability of molecular WOCs could be enhanced by the immobilization of the catalysts onto metal–oxides or carbon-based materials for heterogenization via the formation of covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions.6 In addition, the surface immobilization would decrease the catalyst amount, avoiding the bimolecular decomposition pathways. MWCNTs have been widely used as solid supports for the immobilization of molecular WOCs due to their large surface areas, outstanding stability and excellent electrical conductivity.7 Some functionalized hybrid electrodes have been achieved by the immobilization of pyrene-bearing molecular WOCs onto the MWCNT-coated electrodes through π–π stacking interactions.7a,c,e,f Sun and co-workers modified the MWCNT coated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode with a monomeric pyrene-bearing Ru complex, the functionalized electrode showed a low overpotential of about 0.28 V toward electrocatalytic water oxidation and the controlled potential electrolysis over 10 h gave a TON of 11000 and a TOF of 0.3 s−1.7a In 2016, Cao's group appended the pyrene group to the corrole ligand of a Co complex that was immobilized on MWCNTs, the Co-corrole/MWCNT composite displayed enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability toward OER when compared with the pyrene-free system. The control studies demonstrated that the strong π–π interactions between the pyrene moiety and MWCNTs would accelerate the efficient electron transfer from the electrode to the catalysts and increase the adsorption of the catalysts on the electrodes.7e
Cobalt(II) Schiff base complexes are easily synthesized and have been widely applied in many catalytic fields.8 Recently, the Co complex with a salophen (salophen = N,N′-bis(salicylaldehyde)-1,2-phenylenediamine) ligand has been used as a homogeneous WOC in neutral aqueous solution.9 Subsequently, a Schiff base cobalt complex was successfully immobilized on the surface of TiO2 nanorod arrays for the improvement of the photoelectrochemical water oxidation efficiency, and the hybrid photoanode displayed excellent catalytic durability.10 However, some reported studies have confirmed that some molecular cobalt complexes are known to act as catalyst precursors under severe oxidation conditions.11 It is thus important to identify whether the cobalt complexes are molecular catalysts or decompose to form heterogeneous nanoparticles that are true catalytically active species in the oxygen evolution reaction. Herein we report the synthesis of a Co salophen complex comprising a pyrene moiety (complex 2), the obtained complex was immobilized on MWCNTs to form a noble-metal-free hybrid anode. The resulting anode showed excellent electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in neutral aqueous solution. The XPS characterization confirmed that complex 2 acted as the precatalyst during bulk electrolysis, which was decomposed to form the true catalytically active species.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The pyrene-bearing salophen ligand 1 was synthesized by a simple two-step reaction. Firstly, 4-(pyren-1-yl)benzene-1,2-diamine was obtained via a Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed coupling reaction between 4-bromobenzene-1,2-diamine and 1-pyreneboronic acid, and then the resulting aromatic amine reacted with 2 molar equivalents of salicylaldehyde to give ligand 1. The ligand was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). The reaction of ligand 1 and CoCl2·6H2O in EtOH under reflux conditions afforded complex 2 as brown powder in 83% yield. We failed to obtain a resolvable 1H NMR spectrum of 2, owing to the paramagnetism of the Co(II) ion. Fortunately, the mononuclear configuration of 2 was supported by elemental analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) results. The HR-MS of 2 in positive mode showed a single charge ion peak at m/z = 574.1072, corresponding to the 2 + H+ ion (Fig. S5, ESI†). 2 exhibited good solubility in N,N′-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and the UV-Vis spectrum of 2 in DMF displayed a broad absorption band with λmax at 475 nm, ascribed to the characteristic intraligand π–π* electron transitions (Fig. S6, ESI†).9a The redox properties of 2 were also investigated in DMF by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curve exhibited an irreversible oxidation wave at 0.15 V vs. NHE, as its ΔEp value was 150 mV, implying the CoIII/II oxidation process of the metal center. In addition, upon addition of 5% (v/v) H2O to the above solution, an uprising current beginning at ca. 1.15 V vs. NHE was achieved, indicating that an electrocatalytic water oxidation process had occurred (Fig. S7, ESI†). This catalytic onset potential is similar to the electrocatalytic behavior of Co salophen analogues in neutral aqueous solution (Scheme 1).9a
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of ligand 1 and complex 2. 
The fabrication of 2/MWCNTs@glassy carbon (GC) includes two steps. Initially, the immobilization of complex 2 on MWCNTs (2/MWCNTs) was achieved by soaking MWCNT powder in a DMF solution of 2 overnight. In the second step, the filtered 2/MWCNT composite was dispersed in Nafion solution by sonication to yield a homogeneous ink (10 mg mL−1), the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode was obtained by drop-casting 5 μL of the ink onto the surface of the GC electrode. The surface coverage of 2 on the GC electrode was about (4.0 ± 0.3) × 10−8 mol cm−2, determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry from three independent measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†). The morphology of the 2/MWCNT composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 1a–c). The SEM image of the 2/MWCNT composite showed that the composite was composed of intertwined and disordered nanotubes with an average diameter of 20–30 nm, indicating that MWCNTs retained the initial morphology feature after the immobilization of 2. The presence of 2 in the 2/MWCNT composite was further confirmed by XPS, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping and Raman spectra. The XPS survey spectrum of the hybrid material indicated the presence of C, Co, N and O elements, which agrees with the composition of 2 (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3a, the high resolution C 1s spectrum showed three characteristic peaks at 284.6, 285.5 and 286.8 eV, the main signal located at 284.6 eV is assigned to the sp2 hybridized aromatic carbon atoms from 2 and MWCNTs and the small peak located at 286.8 eV is attributed to the carbon atoms from C–N bonds. The peak located at 285.5 eV suggests the presence of CN and C–O carbon.12 As for the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 3b), two peaks located at 781.3 and 796.4 eV appeared, which belong to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 spin-orbital of Co(II) in complex 2, respectively.9c,13 The high-resolution N 1s spectrum showed a nitrogen binding feature and the peak centered at 399.6 eV is ascribed to the characteristic nitrogen atoms from metal–nitrogen bonds.9c The O 1s XPS spectrum presented a peak located at 532.2 eV, which is related to the oxygen atoms from the Co–O bonds and absorbed water molecules. In addition, the atomic ratio of Co and N was estimated to be 1:2 in the XPS spectrum, further indicating that the molecular structure of complex 2 remained intact after immobilization. EDX elemental mapping suggested that Co was uniformly dispersed on the surface of MWCNTs (Fig. S9, ESI†). Additionally, the Raman spectra of 2, MWCNTs and the 2/MWCNT composite indicated that 2 maintained its initial molecular structure on the surface of MWCNTs (Fig. S10, ESI†). Taken together, the above results strongly proved that 2 has successfully immobilized to MWCNTs. The interaction between 2 and MWCNTs was examined by fluorescence quenching experiments. 2 is weakly emissive in degassed DMF, and the emission band centered at 445 nm is attributed to the pyrene moiety. However, the emission was almost quenched upon the addition of MWCNTs to the solution (Fig. S11, ESI†), suggesting the presence of strong π–π interactions between the pyrene moiety and MWCNT supports.7e

Electrocatalytic properties of 2/MWCNTs
The electrocatalytic activity of the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode was investigated by CVs. As shown in Fig. 4, the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode showed excellent catalytic activity for water oxidation in neutral aqueous solution with an onset potential of 1.15 V vs. NHE (measured at j = 1.0 mA cm−2), corresponding to a low overpotential of 330 mV, this value is consistent with the catalytic activity of 2 in a homogeneous neutral medium, implying that 2 maintained its catalytic behavior after immobilization. The low overpotential of 330 mV is smaller than those of many other reported molecular OER catalysts, including Co corrole,14 Co porphyrin and Co polypyridine-based homogeneous catalysts,15 and heterogeneous Co polyoxometalate catalysts.16 In addition, the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode achieved a low overpotential of 530 mV at 10 mA cm−2 which is the practical operation current for solar fuel synthesis. In sharp contrast, the bare GC, pure MWCNTs@GC or the 1/MWCNTs@GC electrode displayed no catalytic response under the same conditions. These results revealed that complex 2 was essential for electrocatalytic water oxidation.

In order to evaluate the catalytic kinetics of 2/MWCNTs between the water oxidation reaction and the overpotential, the Tafel behavior was investigated at η = 0.25–0.45 V in neutral aqueous electrolytes (Fig. S12, ESI†). The Tafel plot (Fig. 5) displayed a linear dependence of the logarithm of stable current density (A cm−2) on the overpotential (V), and a Tafel slope of 96 mV dec−1 was achieved. This Tafel slope is much lower than that of the most reported highly active molecule-based OER catalysts, e.g. CoHβfCX–CO2H (120 mV dec−1, pH 7.0),14a a halogenated Co phthalocyanine complex (120 mV dec−1, pH 7.0)17 and a Ru-bda derivative-graphite electrode (153 mV dec−1, pH 7.2),18 suggesting an efficient electron transfer process at the interface.

To evaluate the activity and durability of the 2/MWCNT composite, bulk electrolysis was carried out at 1.35 V vs. NHE. In order to increase the area of the working electrode and the mass of the catalyst on the working electrode, we dropped the 2/MWCNT ink onto the carbon cloth (CC, 1.0 cm2) to obtain a 2/MWCNTs@CC electrode; the surface coverage of 2 on the CC was about 1.7 × 10−8 mol cm−2. As shown in Fig. 6, the 2/MWCNTs@CC electrode drove a current density of 2.7 mA cm−2 at the beginning and more than 90% of the initial current density was maintained over an electrolysis period of 3 h, the decreased current density was most probably due to the adhered oxygen bubbles on the surface of the electrode, which would block the interaction between the active sites and the electrolyte. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) verified that the concentration of cobalt species on the electrode surface decreased from 17 nmol to 15 nmol after electrolysis. During the electrolysis, oxygen and hydrogen bubbles were continuously formed at the anode and cathode, respectively. The amount of evolved oxygen was quantified to be 65.9 μmol, corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of up to 90.0% (Fig. S13, ESI†). The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) were estimated to be about 3880 and 0.36 s−1 based on the initial Co content on the CC, respectively.

Molecular catalysts or catalyst precursors?
Because of the easy evolution of metal oxides or hydroxides in situ from the degradation of molecular precursors under severe water oxidation conditions,19 it is crucial to identify the molecular nature of the catalytically active species during electrolysis. Some reported results have suggested that CoSlp acts as the catalyst precursor that decomposed in basic aqueous solution to form cobalt oxide or hydroxide nanoparticles.9b,19a Given that the cobalt ions released from the dissociation of 2 would be the precursors of the catalytically active cobalt oxides or hydroxides, chelating free cobalt ions in the electrolyte with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), a scavenging reagent, has become an accurate approach to clarify the probable contribution from free cobalt ions.20 Accordingly, the bulk electrolysis experiments of 2/MWCNTs were carried out with and without the presence of EDTA. The i–t curve revealed that the presence of EDTA had an obvious effect on the catalytic activity (Fig. S14, ESI†), and the catalytic current density depicted a significant drop from 2.7 mA cm−2 to 0.3 mA cm−2 within 3 h, confirming the hypothesis of the contribution from free cobalt ions. Secondly, the surface composition of 2/MWCNTs after bulk electrolysis was characterized by XPS measurement. As shown in Fig. 7, the Co 2p spectrum showed that the spin orbital peaks for Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 remained unchanged after bulk electrolysis, however, two new satellite peaks were also observed at 803.7 and 787.3 eV, and the presence of these additional satellite peaks proved the presence of Co(II) species.21 The O 1s spectrum presented a peak appearing at 532.3 eV, which is assigned to the oxygen atoms in Co–O bonds. Another peak with a lower binding energy of 531.7 eV was observed, revealing the formation of metal hydroxide species.9b,11a,22 In addition, the amount of N atoms was much less than that of Co atoms in the surface composition, which further confirmed that the molecular structure of 2 in the 2/MWCNT composite was not retained. Finally, 20 nmol Co(NO3)2 was drop-cast onto the surface of the MWCNTs@CC (1.0 cm2) and the obtained hybrid electrode was used as the working electrode for bulk electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.35 V vs. NHE, after bulk electrolysis; the solid was analyzed by XPS and the peaks for Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 were negatively shifted by 0.8 eV (Fig. S15, ESI†), supporting that CoOx nanoparticles existed in the solid.23 The above results supported the notion that complex 2 functioned as the precursor of catalytically active species and the real catalytic species is cobalt hydroxide rather than CoOx, in situ generated from the decomposition of complex 2 during electrolysis.

Conclusions
In summary, a pyrene-modified Co(II) salophen complex (2) was successfully synthesized and its 2/MWCNT composite was obtained by the immobilization of 2 on MWCNTs by taking advantage of the MWCNTs as the supporting material for loading the homogeneous complex. The obtained 2/MWCNT electrode displayed very high electrocatalytic activity for the OER in neutral medium, and a LSV plot showed that the catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 could be achieved at a low overpotential of 330 mV. Bulk electrolysis over 3 h gave a TON of 3880 and a TOF of 0.36 s−1, and the Faradaic efficiency was more than 90%. The XPS measurement suggested that 2 in the composite acted as the catalyst precursor and the formed heterogeneous cobalt hydroxides lead to electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. This strategy of the combination of MWCNTs with molecular precursors can preserve the excellent electrical properties of the sp2-hybridized carbon support and inhibit the aggregation of catalytically active nanoparticles, which is considered as an ideal approach for the development of heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts.
Experimental section
Preparation of 2/MWCNTs@GC electrodes
Initially, 5.0 mg MWCNTs was added to a 5.0 mL DMF solution of complex 2 (0.1 mM) and the suspensions were stirred overnight. The 2/MWCNT composite was collected by filtration and washed with EtOH three times to remove the weakly adsorbed complex, and dried under ambient conditions. 5.0 mg of the 2/MWCNT composite was then dispersed in a mixed solution containing 0.45 mL isopropanol and 0.05 mL of 5% Nafion solution. The resulting suspensions were sonicated for at least 30 min to obtain the 2/MWCNT ink. Finally, 5 μL of 2/MWCNT ink were dropped onto a polished GC electrode (0.071 cm2), and the resulting catalyst functionalized electrodes were stored under an N2 atmosphere prior to use.
Preparation of 2/MWCNTs@CC electrodes

2/MWCNTs@CC electrodes were obtained using a similar drop-casting method. 30 μL of 2/MWCNT ink were dropped onto a CC electrode (1.0 cm2), and the resulting 2/MWCNTs@CC electrodes were stored under an N2 atmosphere prior to use.
Electrochemical measurements
CV and LSV measurements were performed on a three-electrode cell at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The three-electrode cell was equipped with a 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) electrode as the reference electrode. When CVs were conducted in a homogeneous system, a bare GC electrode was used as the working electrode instead of a 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode. All potentials reported here were converted relative to the NHE scale according to the equation: ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 V. Prior to each experiment, the electrolyte was degassed with N2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen.
For bulk electrolysis, the 2/MWCNTs@CC electrode was used as the working electrode instead of the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode. The cell was filled with 20 mL PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.0) and was sealed with vacuum grease. Prior to electrolysis, the cell was degassed with N2. The generated oxygen during electrolysis was monitored by the online gas chromatography (GC) method through automatic sampling. The GC was equipped with a thermal conductive detector with N2 as a carrier gas. The calculated amount of O2 was determined by the assumption that all of the passed charges were caused by 4e− oxidation of water to evolve O2.
Tafel plot
The current density of the 2/MWCNTs@GC electrode against the overpotentials (η) was measured in pH 7.0 PBS at a variety of applied anodic potentials ranging from 1.48 to 1.68 V vs. NHE. For each potential, bulk electrolysis lasted for at least 5 min to achieve a stable current. The intervals of potentials were 50 mV for each test. The overpotential was corrected by deducting the iR compensation, i is the stable current under the given potential and R stands for the solution resistance.
