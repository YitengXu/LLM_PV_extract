1. Introduction
In the 21st century, the world is confronted with two serious issues, i.e., the energy crisis and environmental contamination. As efficient, economic, and green catalytic technologies, heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis (including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, oxygen reduction, organic transformations, etc.) have been considered to be important in solar energy conversion, environmental treatment, and organic synthesis. Understanding photocatalysis and electrocatalysis at the molecular/atomic level is in urgent need to further facilitate these processes. The quantitative isotope measurement provides such a toolbox for mechanistic studies.
As far back as the year of 1939, Ruben and Calvin discovered that the O2 produced by photosynthesis derived from the photolysis of water by using the 18O labeling method.1 In 1949, Calvin revealed the mechanism of photosynthesis with the 14C labeling method.2 In the following 1950s to 1980s, researchers also used isotope labeling methods to study plant respiration and DNA sequence.3,4 In addition to the isotope labeling method, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) method is also an important part of isotope studies. KIE of most elements is tiny, but for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D), the KIE is significant.
In recent years, quantitative isotope measurements have almost become an indispensable part in heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis for mechanistic studies. However, up to now, a comprehensive review on quantitative isotope measurements in heterogeneous photocatalysis/electrocatalysis has not been seen. Herein, we summarize the theory of KIE and isotope labeling methods, and then review their important applications in the latest progress of heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis including CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), water oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and organic transformations. Besides, we also look forward to the future development of quantitative isotope measurements in these fields. We believe that this review can inspire more interest towards photocatalysis and electrocatalysis and help researchers better understand reaction mechanisms and solve emerging problems in these fields.
2. Theory
Isotopes share the same chemical properties but differ in mass, owing to the same number of protons but different number of neutrons in their nuclei. Quantitative isotope measurements (e.g., by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS)) are often used to gain insights into reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactions. KIE and isotope labeling are two important means for mechanistic studies. The former one measures the effects of isotope substitution on reaction rates while the latter one commonly detects locations of isotope-labeled atoms in products. Herein, we summarize the theory of KIE and isotope labeling methods for better understanding of quantitative isotope measurements.
2.1 KIE
KIE is the change in reaction rates when one atom in reactants is substituted by its isotope. According to quantum mechanics, vibrational energy levels of a molecule are quantized (eqn (1)), and the ground-state vibrational energy (n = 0) is called zero-point energy (ZPE) (eqn (2)). (1)where εn is the quantized vibrational energy, n is the vibrational quantum number, h is Planck constant, and ν is the vibrational frequency. (2)
Considering the classical vibrational frequency formula (eqn (3)), ZPE shows the form of eqn (4). (3) (4)where k is the force constant of a bond, m is the reduced mass for two atoms in a bond.
When an atom in a molecule is replaced with its isotope, the reduced mass (m) of two atoms in a bond would change, leading to a change in the vibrational frequency (ν). Accordingly, the ZPE of the molecule varies (eqn (4)). If this change in the reactant cannot offset that in the transition state, that is to say, the differences in ZPE between the reactant and the transition state before and after isotope substitution are different, the reaction rate will change according to the transition state theory (eqn (5)). (5)where k is the rate constant, kB is Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, Q‡, QA, and QB are partition functions of the transition state, reactant A and reactant B, respectively. Δε0 is the difference in ZPE between the reactant and the transition state.
The ratio of reaction rates before and after isotope substitution is named KIE. For example, if a H atom of a reactant molecule is substituted with a D atom, the rate constants before and after isotope substitution are kH and kD, respectively. Then kH/kD is calculated as the value of “KIE”. H/D KIE is the most significant and the most widely used since the relative change in mass from a H atom to a D atom is the most significant.
The magnitude of KIE provides abundant information about reaction mechanisms at the molecular/atomic level. A KIE value of unity indicates that the bond involving an isotope does not change in the rate-determining step (RDS) or the KIE is too small to be accurately measured. When a KIE is significantly greater than unity, it is usually called the normal KIE. When a KIE is less than unity, it is called the reverse KIE. KIE can also be categorized into primary KIE and secondary KIE according to whether the bond containing an isotope breaks in the reaction.

2.1.1 Primary KIE. 
Primary KIE is caused by cleavage of bonds containing isotopes.5–7 Taken H/D KIE as an example, a C–D bond shows a larger activation energy when compared with a C–H bond in a homolytic reaction that forms two radicals (Fig. 1). In this case, the magnitude of KIE is determined by the difference in ZPE between the C–H and C–D bonds. A broken bond possesses no vibrations when the reaction is completed, and thus the force constant associated with this bond is zero after full cleavage of this bond. By assuming that the target bond is 100% split at the transition state, the maximum KIE of C–H/C–D (kC–H/kC–D) is predicted to be 6.5.5,7 Most experimentally observed KIEs are less than 6.5 as the target bond is not 100% broken at the transition state.8–14
 Fig. 1  A diagram showing that the activation energy of a C–D bond is larger than that of a C–H bond in a homolytic reaction. 
Taken the transition state of RDS into consideration, a non-unity KIE value (kC–H/kC–D) requires that the ZPE difference between the C–H bond and C–D bond in the reactant is different from that in the transition state (Fig. 2). For the primary KIE, the ZPE difference in the transition state is less than that in the reactant. Therefore, the activation energy of the D-containing molecule is still greater than that of the H-containing molecule, resulting in a slower reaction rate than the H-containing molecule. It is the residual ZPE difference between C–H and C–D bonds in the transition state that makes the observed KIE value always less than the theoretical maximum value of 6.5.5,7
 Fig. 2  A diagram showing that the residual ZPE difference between C–H and C–D bonds at the transition state diminishes the observed KIE in experiments. 


2.1.2 Secondary KIE. 
Secondary KIE often involves a change in bond hybridizations rather than bond cleavage.5,7,15 They can be further classified into α secondary KIE and β secondary KIE. An α secondary KIE occurs when the target atom has a connected isotope, and a β secondary KIE occurs when the adjacent atom involves an isotope. Taken a C–H bond for instance, after the transformation from a sp3 hybridized C atom (the reactant) to a sp2 hybridized C atom (the transition state), the vibrational frequency of out-of-plane bend drops a lot due to the steric hindrance. For a C–D bond, such a decrease in frequency from a sp3 hybridization to a sp2 hybridization also exists. However, the reduction in the vibrational frequency after the hybridization change for a C–H bond is more significant than that for a C–D bond, leading to a less ZPE difference in the transition state than in the reactant. Therefore, the C–H bond has a smaller activation energy and a faster reaction rate than the C–D bond, resulting in a normal α secondary KIE (Fig. 3a). The maximum α secondary KIE for C–H/C–D is ca. 1.41.5,7
 Fig. 3  Energy diagrams showing the (a) normal and (b) inverse α secondary KIEs. 
On the other hand, from a sp2 hybridization (the reactant) to a sp3 hybridization state (the transition state), the vibrational frequencies of C–H and C–D bonds both increase. However, the increase in the vibrational frequency after the hybridization change for a C–H bond is more significant than that for a C–D bond, leading to a greater ZPE difference in the transition state than in the reactant (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the C–H bond has a larger activation energy and a slower reaction rate than the C–D bond, resulting in a reverse α secondary KIE, whose maximum value is ca. 0.71.5,7

2.2 Isotope labeling
Isotope labeling can be performed to qualitatively detect intermediates and quantitatively determine yields of products.16–25 This method is also widely used to study reaction mechanisms. For instance, 18O-labeled and D-labeled H2O are often used for the verification of oxygen evolution (reaction (6)) and O–H bond cleavage (reaction (7)) in the study of water oxidation, respectively.16–19,26–28 In the research of CO2RR (reaction (8) and (9)) and NRR (reaction (10)), 13C-labeled CO2 and 15N-labeled N2 are applied to evaluate product yields and exclude the influence from contaminated carbon and nitrogen species.22–25 The isotope-labeled carbon or nitrogen atoms are assumed to be 100% involved in products when no contamination or other side reactions interfere the main reactions. Therefore, the proportion of isotope-labeled atoms involved in products is the key parameter to evaluate the product yields. 2H218O + 4h+ → 18O2 + 4H+(6) 2D2O + 4h+ → O2 + 4D+(7) 13CO2 + 2H+ + 2e− → 13CO + H2O(8) 13CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → 13CH4 + 2H2O(9) 15N2 + 6H+ + 6e− → 2 15NH3(10)
Isotope labeling generally does not affect reaction rates and mechanisms, which makes it suitable for quantitatively determining product yields and exploring reaction mechanisms. However, it is noteworthy that isotope exchange must be carefully considered when using isotope labeling experiments. Isotope exchange means the redistribution of different isotopic atoms within the molecule, among different molecules, or among various phases.29–33 This phenomenon is commonly used to synthesize isotope markers,32 but it can also interfere with isotope labeling analysis. For example, the exchange of labeled 18O with the column makes it difficult to use Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for detecting isotope-labeled products.33 On the other hand, the isotope exchange between labeled reactants and solvent also makes the mechanistic studies complicated. For example, the isotope exchange of oxygen exists between CO2 and H2O in the research of CO2RR, which makes it difficult to track the source of oxygen in products. From this point of view, isotope-labeled CO, instead of CO2, is usually used for mechanistic studies, considering that CO is usually the first intermediate of CO2RR and does not exchange oxygen with H2O.34,35 Hence, CO reduction reaction (CORR) has become a commonly used model reaction in mechanistic studies of CO2RR.
Furthermore, when studying photocatalysis and electrocatalysis on metal oxides such as TiO2 and Fe2O3, it is highly possible that the 18O-labeled substrates exchange with the oxygen atoms on metal oxide surfaces, which may cause the loss of 18O marker in products. Civis and co-workers studied oxygen-isotope exchange between Ti18O2 and C16O2 using gas-phase high-resolution infrared (IR) spectroscopy and found that the oxygen-isotope exchange rates were associated with the pretreatments of TiO2.36 In contrast, CO could not exchange its oxygen atom with TiO2. In general, the premises for the proper use of isotope labeling should be carefully considered.
2.3 Methods for isotope analysis
NMR and MS are powerful tools for quantitative isotope analysis. NMR can detect and analyze those atoms whose nuclear spin quantum numbers are not zero, such as H, D, 13C, 15N, 17O, 19F, etc. Recently, NMR has become a recommended method for the determination of 14NH3 and 15NH3 in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic NRR studies.24,25,37,38 To determine the source of nitrogen for the produced NH3 in NRR, 14N2 and 15N2 are used as reactants and their corresponding products are compared. If the amount of produced 15NH3 is in quantitative agreement with the amount of 14NH3, the source of nitrogen for the produced NH3 can be confirmed to be from N2 rather than other contaminations (Fig. 4a and b). In 1H NMR, the interaction between 1H and 15N of 15NH4+ splits the 1H resonance into two symmetric peaks with a spacing of 73 Hz, while the correlation between 1H and 14N of 14NH4+ splits 1H resonance into three symmetric peaks with a spacing of 52 Hz (Fig. 4c).24 Based on this, 14NH3 and 15NH3 can be easily distinguished by 1H NMR.

For accurate quantification, both external and internal standard methods can be employed.25 The former uses standard solutions containing different concentrations of 14NH3 or 15NH3 (e.g., standard solutions of 14NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl) and the corresponding peak areas are used to draw standard curves. The latter is to quantitatively add an internal standard compound to the 14NH3 or 15NH3 sample. It is noted that the standard compound should have similar properties to the sample but cannot react with the sample. Accurate 1H NMR measurement also demands strict control of key analysis conditions such as pulse program, relaxation time, number of scans, and solvent. For instance, Simonov and co-workers found that the detected amount of NH3 by 1H NMR was highly susceptible to the pH of the solution.40
MS is an analytical technique that ionized sample molecules or atoms to form ions with various mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. Those ions are further separated by an electromagnetic field and are collected in order of m/z ratios. Since different isotope ions have different m/z ratios, qualitative analysis can be performed according to the positions of peaks, and quantitative analysis can be achieved by the natural abundance of the isotope and the intensity of peaks.
Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) is an operando electrochemical test method that combines an electrochemical reaction device with an MS (Fig. 5). When the volatile products generated by electrochemical reactions or volatile reactants enter the vacuum system pipeline of the MS, the current of the ions with different m/z ratios (also named ion mass current, iMS) can be obtained. It uses a differential method to determine the amount of products and a differential pumping system to avoid the large amount of solvent in the electrochemical cell from entering the high vacuum system of MS. DEMS can be used to detect the isotopic composition of products and intermediates in isotope labeling experiments.41–44 For example, in a electrocatalytic CO2RR study, Strasser and co-workers used CO2/13CO mixed-feed and monitored the isotopic composition of C2H4 in real time by using DEMS.41 The integration of iMS over time yielded the C2H4 generation by three pathways (13CO–13CO, 12CO2–13CO and 12CO2–12CO2), and every reaction pathway was quantitatively determined. Finally, the 12CO2–13CO pathway was identified as the dominant reaction pathway towards C2H4 production.41

Based on DEMS, Koper and co-workers developed a new electrochemical MS method, which placed a porous Teflon-based sampling tip near the electrode surface to detect gaseous products in real time and avoided the use of differential pumping system of DEMS. This method is called the on-line electrochemical mass spectroscopy (OLEMS).46 Combined with isotope-labeling methods, the OLEMS has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for mechanistic studies.17,26
3. Applications of quantitative isotope measurements in energy chemistry
3.1 CO2 reduction
As an important branch of solar fuel synthesis, the electro- and photo-reduction of CO2 have been widely studied.41,47–52 However, CO2RR suffers from low activity and selectivity, due to the low solubility of CO2 in H2O, its difficulty in adsorption and activation, and the severe competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), etc. To design an effective CO2RR catalyst, the CO2RR mechanism should be revealed, which could be investigated by isotope methods.
Proton transfer plays an important role in CO2RR. Hence, H/D KIE studies can provide useful information for the reaction mechanism. To effectively and accurately perform H/D KIE studies, non-labeled proton donors should be independently replaced by their isotope-labeled counterparts, and meanwhile all other variables should be kept unchanged. However, for CO2RR, several parameters are hard to keep constant when replacing H2O by D2O, e.g., the HER activity, CO2 solubility and H-bonding interaction.53 Therefore, the variation of reaction rates derived from isotope substitution cannot be decoupled and extracted. That should be the main reason why so far only a handful of KIE studies have been reported for CO2RR. For example, an “inverse” KIE results on Au foil electrodes were reported by Xu and co-workers, where the current density toward CO production was −0.070 ± 0.005 mA cm−2 in NaHCO3 and −0.162 ± 0.011 mA cm−2 in NaDCO3.54 This inverse correlation was mainly ascribed to the decreased activity of HER when H was replaced by D.54 Therefore, the information of proton transfer involved in CO2RR was hard to be extracted, when there were various convoluting factors. Recently, Wang and co-workers reported a primary KIE over a Cu catalyst for electrocatalytic CO2RR in a flow cell, which indicated that dissociation of H2O was involved in the RDS.55 Further modification with fluorine significantly decreased the KIE, implying that the dissociation of H2O was no longer the RDS. Importantly, the acceleration of H2O activation was found to contribute to a high C2+ (mainly ethylene and ethanol) faradaic efficiency of 80% with an ultrahigh current density of 1.6 A cm−2.55
Isotope-labeled CO2 and CO are usually used to verify the source of carbon in products of CO2RR and CORR. For example, Xie and co-workers constructed SnS2 atomic layers with various oxidation degrees to unravel the effect of oxidized sulfides on the CO2RR activity, among which the mildly oxidized SnS2 atomic layers exhibited the highest CO production rate.56 Synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) analysis combined with 13CO2 was used to verify the source of carbon for the produced CO (Fig. 6). Additionally, they also synthesized atomically thin sulfur-deficient CuIn5S8 layers that were enriched with Cu–In dual metal active sites, which achieved near 100% CH4 selectivity under visible-light irradiation.50 Isotope-labeled CO2 was implemented not only to confirm that the evolved CH4 originated from CO2 but also to verify the near 100% CH4 selectivity.50 Rajh and co-workers performed systematical spectroscopies with DFT calculations to demonstrate that the (110) facet of a single Cu2O particle was active for CO2 reduction to methanol, while the (100) facet was inert.51 Isotope-labeled CO2 experiments gave solid evidence that carbon in methanol came from the reactant CO2.51

Isotope labeling has been widely used in mechanistic studies of CO2RR. Xu and co-workers used in situ IR spectroscopy and MS combined with 13C-labeling to demonstrate that the rapid equilibrium exchange of carbon between dissolved CO2 and HCO3− facilitated CO2RR activity.29 MS analysis (Fig. 7a) combined with the isotopic composition of CO, CO2(g), dissolved CO2 and HCO3− (Fig. 7b) revealed that CO2(g) was not the direct reactant in CO2RR. Other electrocatalysts showed similar behaviors (Fig. 7c). Hence, the researchers proposed that there was a rapid equilibrium between dissolved CO2 and HCO3− (Fig. 7d), leading to an increased effective concentration of CO2 on electrode surfaces (Fig. 7e).29

The impact of isotope exchange must be carefully considered for mechanistic studies. As shown in Fig. 8, in the isotope study of electrocatalytic CORR, it has been found that ethanol and propanol did not exchange their oxygen atom with H2O.57 In contrast, although the exchange rate was very slow, the exchange of oxygen between acetic acid and H2O did exist (Fig. 8).57 Similarly, Jiao and co-workers also found that ethanol and acetic acid did not exchange their oxygen atom with H2O in a short time, but acetaldehyde rapidly exchanged its oxygen with H2O.48

Ager and co-workers used the isotope labeling strategy to verify the hypothesis that the oxygen atom in oxygenate products originated from the solvent H2O rather than the reactant CO (Fig. 9).57 CO, instead of CO2, was used in this study, considering that CO2 was firstly reduced to CO on various Cu electrocatalysts. Using CO as the reactant would not change the reaction pathway. Besides, CO2 would rapidly form bicarbonate with H2O and further lead to 18O exchange with H2O. In this work, C16O was electrolyzed on a surface-oriented Cu film in H218O. Ethanol, acetate and 1-propanol were found to involve 18O, which originated from H218O (Fig. 9); while methanol and allyl alcohol did not contain 18O, suggesting a distinct reaction pathway. From DFT calculations, C2H518OH was found to result from a concerted hydrolysis of *C–CH with H218O to form *CH–CH(18OH).57 Nevertheless, this understanding was later challenged by Bell and co-workers.58 They performed DFT calculations to display that the above experimental results were associated with isotope exchange between carbonyl-containing intermediate products and H2O. A rapid conversion equilibrium between acetaldehyde and its hydrated product (ethane-1,1-diolate) was confirmed by calculating the energy barrier of the hydroxide-catalyzed acetaldehyde hydration reaction.58 Thus, they theoretically proved the possibility of isotope exchange between carbonyl-containing intermediate products and solvate H2O. In addition to the theoretical evidence, Jiao and co-workers also experimentally confirmed that acetaldehyde rapidly exchanged its oxygen with H2O.48

Ager and co-workers implemented 12CO2/13CO co-feeding experiments to demonstrate that there were three different product-selective active sites on oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts, which produced ethylene, 1-propanol and ethanol/acetate, respectively.47 The researchers proposed an interesting kinetic model to understand their isotope labeling results. Given that different product-selective active sites had different *12COOH adsorption energy, there would be different surface *12CO concentrations (vs. *13CO) on distinct product-selective active sites, which would further influence the isotope composition of final products. Ethanol and acetate were found to be produced from the same active sites due to the similar isotope composition, while ethylene and 1-propanol originated from other different active sites. By comparing the experimental isotope distribution with the predicted binomial distribution, the three product-selective sites were verified on oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts.47
Moreover, Strasser and co-workers performed 13C-labeling experiments in a capillary electrochemical cell in conjunction with DEMS to elucidate the reaction pathway of C2H4 production on CuOx using CO2 and CO as co-feeds.41 By comparing the co-feeding curve with the pure CO2 curve, it was concluded that the production of self-feeding CO was sufficient to maintain the production of C2H4 in the cathodic sweep direction, while the self-feeding supply of CO by CO2-to-CO reduction was insufficient to maintain the production of C2H4 on the anodic sweep. Furthermore, CO was found not to compete with CO2 on adsorption sites, and these results inspired the researchers to design a Cu-based tandem electrocatalyst. Internal CO could be supplied via CO2 reduction on Ni in the Cu-based tandem electrocatalyst, without using CO as the external co-feed. This strategy improved the C2H4 production.41 In addition, Xu and co-workers performed 13CO labeling experiments combined with surface-enhanced IR spectroscopy to elucidate the reaction mechanism of multi-carbon production on Cu electrocatalysts.52 Based on the fact that only 36% of the produced 1-propanol originated from the C–C cross-coupling between CO and acetaldehyde, it was proposed that the reaction mechanism bifurcated at the *CH3CO. One was hydrogenation of *CH3CO, which produced CH3CHO and ethanol. Another one was the coupling of *CH3CO with CO and followed by hydrogenation, which produced 1-propanol (Fig. 10).52

Jiao and co-workers used C18O experiments to reveal the pivotal role of a triple-phase boundary in enhancing C2+ production.48 A high-performance flow electrolyser with a robust triple-phase boundary was designed, and its electrocatalytic performance reached a new level, with C2+ partial current density over 630 mA cm−2 and C2+ selectivity above 90%.48 To further elucidate the production of acetate, C18O was used as the reactant. The results showed that for the produced acetate acid, one oxygen atom originated from C18O and another oxygen atom originated from the electrolyte. They proposed a reaction mechanism that OH− ions in the electrolyte reacted with intermediate species containing carbonyl groups to form acetate.48
In addition, Jiao and co-workers reported that C–N bonds were formed by using CO and NH3 as co-feeds, producing acetamide with the selectivity of nearly 40%.49 From DFT calculations, a reaction mechanism of the nucleophilic addition of ketene was proposed. Acetamide was formed through nucleophilic addition of NH3 to a *CCO (ketene intermediate), and this step was in competition with the OH− nucleophilic addition. This reaction mechanism was further demonstrated by the following experiments. In the CO/NH3 co-feeding process, as the concentration of KOH increased, the mole fraction of acetate increased and that of acetamide decreased, indicating that NH3 competed with OH− to attack *CCO. When C18O and NH3 were co-electrolyzed, 18O-labeled acetamide was the dominant product, in accordance with the proposed nucleophilic addition of ketene mechanism. Finally, NH3 was replaced with other amine-type nucleophilic agents such as methylamine, ethylamine and dimethylamine to co-electrolyze with CO. The corresponding amides were obtained while their molar faction was positively correlated with the nucleophilicity of nucleophilic reagents.49
3.2 N2 fixation
NH3 is an important agricultural and chemical product.25,37,38 It is dominantly synthesized by the traditional Haber–Bosch process that requires high temperature and high pressure.25,37,38 Although the electrochemical/photochemical synthesis of NH3 from N2 under mild conditions has been considered an attractive alternative to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, it still faces many challenges in applications.24,25,37,38 The low selectivity, low conversion efficiency and ubiquitous contamination make it difficult to accurately determine the yield of NH3. Hence, isotope labeling experiments (15N2 gas used as the reactant) have been proposed by many researchers as an indispensable step in a rigorous NRR report.24,25,37,38
Commercial 15N2 gas inevitably contains some NH3 and NOx impurities.59 Therefore, it is essential to purify the 15N2 reaction gas before isotope labeling experiments. It is commonly realized by using H2SO4 or NaOH to purify the 15N2 gas.38,60 Recently, Chorkendorff and co-workers recommended a Cu impurity trap for 15N2 gas purification and proposed a gas circulation setup for isotope labeling experiments in electrocatalytic NRR studies.24 By this setup, 15N2 gas can be continuously cycled and re-supplied to the electrode surface.
Isotope labeling experiments have already been reported in many electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NRR studies for confirming the nitrogen source of NH3 and excluding contaminations. Oschatz and co-workers synthesized a C-doped TiO2/C electrocatalyst and achieved a faradaic efficiency of 17.8% for NRR.6115N2 experiments exhibited the same faradaic efficiency and NH3 yield as the normal 14N2 experiments. Ding and co-workers synthesized a robust, double-active BP@SnO2−x NRR electrocatalyst with a NH3 yield of 48.87 μg h−1 mgcat−1 and a faradaic efficiency of 14.6%.62 The NH3 production experiment was repeated by using 15N2 gas. Both NMR and Nessler methods showed that the NH3 yield from 15N2 was almost the same as that from 14N2. In addition, when 15N2 was purged into the system under open circuit conditions, no 15NH4+ signal was detected, which excluded the false positives from serious contamination in 15N2. Ye and co-workers synthesized an amorphous Sn/SnS2 nanosheets electrocatalyst and achieved a NH3 yield of 23.8 μg h−1 mg−1.63 When 15N2 was used as the reaction gas, a distinct double peak ascribed to 15NH4+ was observed in 1H NMR spectrum of the product, implying that the NH3 product detected was derived from the reactant N2. Wang and co-workers boosted the conversion of N2 to NH3 by tuning the local electronic structure of Au nanoparticles with CoOx.64 Such an Au/CoOx electrocatalyst possessed high average oxidation states of Au (∼40%), achieving a NH3 yield rate of 15.1 μg cm−2 h−1 and a faradaic efficiency of 19%. Isotope labeling experiments were conducted during which 15N2 gas was first flowed through a water-filled vessel with 0.1 M NaOH to remove the impurities before bubbling into the reaction cell. The 1H NMR spectrum of the product showed a distinct double peak attributed to 15NH4+. In addition, the intensity of the 15NH4+ signal of Au/CoOx was stronger than that of Au, which confirmed the positive effects of CoOx on Au catalysts in NRR.64
It is noteworthy that once the yield of NRR is greatly increased, the interference from various impurities and external factors can be ignored and isotope labeling experiments are no longer necessary. In addition to confirming the authenticity and reliability of experimental results, isotope labeling method can also help study the complicated NRR mechanisms.
Zhao and co-workers synthesized a g-C3N4 photocatalyst modified with cyano groups and intercalated K+, and investigated the NRR mechanism by the isotope labeling method.60 When using 15N2 as the reaction gas, the production of 14NH4+ ceased after a few hours while the production of 15NH4+ still continued. This observation implied that the available 14N from the photocatalyst for NH3 formation was exhausted with the reaction. In addition, the 15N isotope abundance significantly increased from 6.20‰ for the fresh photocatalyst to 10.52‰ for the used photocatalyst. Such an increase suggested that a portion of N in the photocatalyst was replaced by 15N from the 15N2 gas. Combined with DFT calculations, a reaction pathway analogous to the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism was proposed.60 Similarly, Xu and co-workers reported a vanadium nitride (VN0.7O0.45) nanoparticle electrocatalyst with an NRR rate of 3.3 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 6.0% at −0.1 V within 1 h.39 Experiments using 15N2 as the feed produced both 14NH3 and 15NH3, suggesting the MvK mechanism as the reaction pathway (Fig. 11).

Cheng and co-workers used the isotope labeling method to study the NRR mechanism catalyzed by a nanoporous palladium hydride electrocatalyst (PdHx) and proved the important role of hydrogen from PdHx.65 They firstly synthesized the corresponding D-substituted PdHx for the NRR test. FTIR spectra collected after the NRR test confirmed the generation of NH2D2+ (1177 cm−1, 1325 cm−1) and NH3D+ (1241 cm−1), which revealed the participation of hydrogen atoms from PdHx in the formation of NH3.65
3.3 Water oxidation
As a promising means of converting solar and electrical energy into chemical energy, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting has attracted great interests. In overall water splitting, the anodic reaction (water oxidation) commonly exhibits low efficiency, due to the kinetic limitations from the four-proton and four-hole transfer. Therefore, it is desired to understand the reaction mechanism of water oxidation for further facilitating the reaction activity. As powerful tools to investigate water-oxidation mechanisms, H/D KIE and isotope labeling experiments are widely used in numerous studies.16,17,26,27,66–75
The 18O-labeling strategy combined with the OLEMS measurement has been widely applied to investigate the role of lattice oxygen in electrocatalytic water oxidation.17,26 Shao-Horn and co-workers studied 18O-labeled perovskites to investigate water-oxidation pathways on oxygen sites.17 Possible non-concerted proton–electron transfer pathways that evolved 34O2 and 36O2 were proposed. The OLEMS measurement was carried out and samples containing 18O-labeled lattice oxygen was used to give direct evidences to support O2 generation from the lattice oxygen.17 Mayrhofer and co-workers also performed OLEMS on 18O-labeled samples to reveal the role of the lattice oxygen for driving water oxidation on hydrous IrOx.26 Compared with rutile IrO2, hydrous IrOx offered highly reactive IrOOH species, which were directly responsible for the evolution of lattice oxygen.26 On the other hand, a comprehensive investigation of isotope labeling experiments using OLEMS excluded the participation of the lattice oxygen exchange in water oxidation on a highly-active NiFeOxHy electrocatalyst.28
By combing KIE and isotope labeling studies, the proton transfer and rate-limiting O–O bond formation pathways have been explored for (photo)electrocatalytic water oxidation on hematite. Zhao and co-workers investigated the pivotal role of proton transfer in photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation on hematite photoanodes.73 Significant KIEs were observed under low pH conditions, indicating that proton transfer was coupled with the interfacial hole transfer on hematite. The KIE values continuously decreased with increasing pH and became ∼1 at pH 13.6 (Fig. 12a). These results indicated the mechanistic switch from concerted proton–electron transfer (CPET) to electron transfer (ET) for water oxidation on hematite.73 Further rate law analysis on the surface-trapped holes of hematite implied a mechanistic transition from water nucleophilic attack (WNA) to the interaction of two metal-oxo unites (I2M) for the rate-limiting O–O bond formation (Fig. 12b), which was consistent with the pH-dependent KIE results.16 On the other hand, operando photoelectrochemical ATR-FTIR measurements were conducted to verify the WNA pathway by identifying a superoxide intermediate (1100 cm−1). In order to confirm the chemical nature of the key intermediate on hematite surfaces, 18O- and D-labeled H2O were used in the ATR-FTIR measurements. A surface superoxide species hydrogen-bonded to the adjacent surface hydroxyl group was observed.16 Furthermore, Bachmann and co-workers confirmed the rate-limiting O–O bond formation via WNA on hematite surfaces by using isotope ratio mass spectrometry and 16O/18O KIE studies.71

Recently, by combining rate law analysis on surface holes and KIE measurements, the multi-hole transfer kinetics was investigated for water oxidation on hematite.75 A third-order kinetics was confirmed for surface holes on hematite under high-intensity illumination. This third order was ascribed to a M(OH)–O–M(OH) structure, which was similar to that on homogeneous Ir- and Fe-based catalysts.76,77 Furthermore, the third-order reaction displayed a low apparent Arrhenius activation energy (Ea = 0.06 ± 0.02 eV), indicating that the M(OH)–O–M(OH) sites could be successively oxidized to store enough oxidation power for driving water oxidation. A small KIE value of ∼1.7 was also observed, indicating that O–H bond cleavage was not involved in the RDS.75
It is noted that the activity change caused by isotope substitution may be also accounted by the equilibrium isotope effect rather than the kinetic effect as discussed above. A recent isotope study on Co-based amorphous-oxide electrocatalysts showed that the H-to-D substitution resulted in a 87% decrease in the water-oxidation activity at neutral pH and the 16O-to-18O substitution caused a 10% decrease.70 A comprehensive spectroelectrochemical study excluded the KIE as the dominant effect and concluded that neither proton nor electron transfer was involved in the RDS. Meanwhile, their X-ray absorption spectroscopy results supported the equilibrium isotope effect that caused the H/D isotope results (Fig. 13). The RDS was finally proposed to be the O–O bond formation via two adjacent CoIV atoms, which was proved by the 16O/18O isotope effect.70

3.4 Oxygen reduction
ORR is an important chemical reaction applied in energy conversion devices such as fuel cells and metal–air batteries.78–84 In-depth understanding of ORR mechanisms is the basis for developing ORR catalysts with high efficiency, high stability, and low cost. ORR can proceed through two main pathways: the four-electron transfer pathway that produces H2O (reaction (11)) and the two-electron transfer reaction that produces H2O2 (reaction (12)).79 It has also been reported that O2 can be reduced by one electron to produce O2− (reaction (13)), a process that does not involve protons.80,84 O2 + 4H+ + 4e− ↔ 2H2O(11) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ H2O2(12) O2 + e− ↔ O2−(13)
From the above three reaction pathways, it can be found that the proton transfer plays a pivotal role in the ORR process. Investigation of proton transfer mechanism is a promising experimental strategy to uncover the ORR mechanism. Gewirth and co-workers employed lipid-modified electrodes to modulate proton-transfer kinetics on a Cu-based electrocatalyst and further studied the ORR mechanism by H/D KIE.84 They discovered that by regulating the proton-transfer kinetics to commensurate with O–O bond breaking rates, the desired four-electron transfer pathway that produced H2O could be achieved by a high selectivity. In contrast, fast and sluggish proton-transfer kinetics that mismatched the electron-transfer kinetics resulted in the production of H2O2 and O2−, respectively.84
In recent years, H/D KIE measurements have been widely used to study the working mechanism of proton transfer on several typical ORR catalysts.78–83 For example, Zenyuk and co-workers used KIE to investigate ORR over various kinds of Pt-based electrocatalysts.78,79 For high-loading Pt/C (40 wt% Pt loading) and polycrystalline Pt, a KIE of unity was observed, which indicated that the RDS was proton independent.78 For Pt nanoparticles dispersed on carbon supports, the KIE value increased with the decreasing loading density of Pt on carbon supports, indicating of the involvement of proton transfer in the RDS.79 Gewirth and co-workers used KIE to study and compare the proton involvement in the RDS between Pt/Pd-based and non-precious-metal ORR catalysts.80 A KIE of ∼1 was observed for Pt/C and Pd/C, which indicated that the RDS was a proton-independent electron transfer. A KIE of ∼2 was observed on a non-precious Fe-based ORR catalyst, suggesting the involvement of proton transfer in the RDS (Fig. 14). Similarly, Kucernak and co-workers studied the ORR mechanism over Fe-based catalysts under acidic and alkaline conditions by using KIE.81 The KIE values under acidic and alkaline conditions were measured to be 3.4 and 2.5, respectively, suggesting that proton transfer was involved in the RDS of both cases. All these studies have demonstrated the crucial need to consider proton-transfer kinetics for the design and synthesis of ORR catalysts that exhibit high activity and selectivity.

3.5 Organic transformations
Photocatalytic organic reactions, such as organics dehalogenation and alcohols oxidation, are important fields in photocatalysis. As a powerful tool for mechanistic studies, isotope methods are playing a pivotal role in studying photocatalytic organic reactions.
Zhao and co-workers used the KIE method to study photocatalytic dehalogenation of aromatic halides on TiO2.85 Universal inverse KIEs of 0.6–0.8 were observed for this type of reaction and a new reaction mechanism was proposed.85 The released proton from solvent oxidation reacted with a carbon atom of the aromatic halide to form a proton–adduct intermediate. The intermediate adsorbed onto TiO2 induced the subsequent electron-transfer process and generated a dehalogenated product. The electron-transfer process involved the change in hybridization from sp2 to sp3 of a carbon atom of the aromatic halide and was the RDS of the whole reaction.85
In addition to the KIE, the isotope labeling method was also widely used to study the mechanisms of photocatalytic organic reactions. Zhao and co-workers found a unique oxygen atom transfer mechanism in photocatalytic alcohols oxidation on TiO2.86,87 Photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of an 18O-labeled alcohol was found to produce aldehyde with the 16O abundance of 100% (Fig. 15a).87 Furthermore, little change of the 18O abundance in the unreacted alcohol was detected, indicating of the absence of isotope exchange among the substrate, the product and O2. Using 18O-labeled TiO2, they further proved that the oxygen atom of the product was not derived from the surface-bounded water or OH groups of TiO2. From these results, it can be concluded that one oxygen atom in O2 replaced the oxygen atom in the C–O bond of the alcohol, resulting in a new CO bond in aldehyde (Fig. 15b).86,87 Based on this mechanism, it was further found that the photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols on TiO2 could be dramatically accelerated by a Brønsted acid.88 This effect resulted from the decomposition of the relatively stable side-on peroxide intermediate, which was promoted by the protons of Brønsted acids. This understanding was further extended to photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of amines on TiO2.89

Photocatalysis on MOF (Metal Organic Framework) has emerged as a new focus recently and isotope experiments contribute to its mechanistic studies. Jiang and co-workers studied the mechanism of visible-light photocatalytic toluene oxidation over Fe-UiO-66 with the aid of isotope experiments (Fig. 16).90 The incorporation of Fe into UiO-66 was believed to induce water oxidation and generate ˙OH radicals by the photogenerated holes. This O–H cleavage was confirmed by the H/D KIE value of 3.1 by using D2O as the reactant. Furthermore, the generated ˙OH radicals showed an activity for splitting C–H bond and thus drove toluene oxidation. H/D KIE experiments using d8-toluene demonstrated the C–H bond cleavage in toluene oxidation.90

4. Outlook and conclusion
Nowadays, quantitative isotope measurements have already become a crucial part in the studies of heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. Despite its wide applications, the high cost of isotope-labeled chemicals remains a big issue in experimental research.
Simple, efficient, and low-cost synthesis methods and separation techniques are very important for the preparation of isotope-labeled chemicals and isotope-substituted heterogeneous catalysts. At present, the feasible industrial-scale isotope separation technologies for hydrogen/deuterium are the Girdler sulfide process and the H2 distillation technique, both of which are high energy-consuming and have a low separation factor.91 In recent years, nanoporous materials such as zeolites, MOFs and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with quantum sieving effect have provided new opportunities for the development of efficient and advanced isotope separation systems. For example, in 2019, Yuan and co-workers constructed a microporous Cu-based MOF (FJI-Y11) with excellent thermal and chemical stability.92 Theoretical calculations and experimental results showed that the FJI-Y11 had an excellent isotope separation performance for H2/D2. Further development in isotope separation systems should help lower the cost of isotope-labeled chemicals and evoke more intensive interests in using isotope methods.
On the other hand, time-resolved and space-resolved studies of isotope measurements should further deepen our insights into reaction mechanisms of heterogeneous catalysis at the molecular level. Indeed, Frei and co-workers have already provided an exciting example by using isotope labeling and time-resolved Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy to explore the mechanism of water oxidation on Co-based electrocatalysts.66 However, only a handful of such successful works have been reported so far. We expect that in the future, such time-resolved technology will be employed in more research fields. Space-resolved technologies are also highly expected. As we have shown in above sections that (photo)electrochemistry play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis and quantitative isotope measurements, it can be speculated that more advanced electrochemical technology, such as scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)93–96 and potential-sensing electrochemical atomic force microscopy (PS-EC-AFM)97,98 are able to contribute to the space-resolved isotope measurements.
In general, the reports covered in this review are only the tip of the iceberg in quantitative isotope measurements for heterogeneous photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. We hope that this review can inspire the interest of more researchers and provide a reference for the future development of this field.
