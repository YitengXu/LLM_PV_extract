Introduction
Dioxygen from air is the cleanest and the most abundant oxidative agent. Catalytic activation of dioxygen continues to attract interest with special emphasis on elucidation of the reaction mechanisms via modeling of oxidases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases and related metalloenzymes.1 In addition, as the degradation and transformation of water pollutants is one of the main areas of scientific research today,2,3 the activation of dioxygen by Fenton reaction and photochemical reactions to form a hydroxyl radical (˙OH), a highly reactive oxidant that unselectively reacts at near diffusion-controlled rates with most organic substrates, has been extensively studied.4–8 For example, some fungi can produce ˙OH through a mechanism involving reduced quinones and Fe2+: upon oxidation, the reduced quinones form H2O2, which reacts with Fe2+ to form ˙OH.9 Upon irradiation with ultraviolet or solar light, the destruction of pollutants using a nano-semiconductor or a ferric ion is also facilitated mainly by a series of hydroxylation reactions initiated by ˙OH.10 Although the Fenton reaction as well as the reaction between natural organic matter and aquated Fe(II) under irradiation are well studied, the understanding of reactive oxygen species formation from other metal ions or complexes with dioxygen is rather poor.
Similar to iron, cobalt is also an essential element in the human diet and plays a key role in the oxidation reactions.11 In previous papers, we have shown that the cobalt complexes such as cobalt(II)–bicarbonate, cobalt(II)–triethylamine and cobalt(II)–monoethanolamine are efficient catalysts for organic dye degradation with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant.12–16 Under the given conditions of 5 μM Co2+ ions, 10 mM NaHCO3 and 4 mM H2O2, Acid Orange 7 (AO7) could be completely degraded by the cobalt(II)–bicarbonate system after 10 min at room temperature, which was much faster than that using the Fenton reagent with 50 μM Fe2+ ions.14 The cobalt(II)–triethylamine system can even slowly decolorize AO7 with dioxygen before the addition of H2O2 at room temperature.15 Since amino complexes of Co2+ ions are known to bind O2,17 there may exist some cobalt complexes that can produce reactive species through O2 activation and efficiently degrade pollutants in wastewater.

p-Aminophenol (PAP) has been extensively consumed as a raw material and an intermediate in different industries such as medicine, dye, rubber, and petroleum; therefore, large quantities of PAP may enter the environment as a pollutant.18 Development of new methods for degrading this aromatic amine is valuable due to its various harmful effects on humans such as increasing heart shock and mutagenesis.18 In this work, it was found that PAP could be used as an electron donor for dioxygen activation with the simple cobalt(II) ions as the catalyst in HCO3− aqueous solution. More interestingly, highly reactive ˙OH radicals were produced as the main reactive species, which can decolorize the azo dye AO7 simultaneously in the system. The comparison of different aminophenols and metal ions, the role of HCO3− and the mechanism of ˙OH radical formation in this process were then further studied in detail. The results can provide new insights into the molecular oxygen activation mechanism and organic transformation and degradation by simple cobalt ions in aqueous solution.
Experimental section
Materials
Cobalt acetate, sodium bicarbonate sodium, iodide and methanol were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Company, China. p-Aminophenol (PAP), o-aminophenol (OAP) and m-aminophenol (MAP) were obtained from Aladdin reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. If not noted otherwise, all chemicals used were of analytical grade. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were obtained from Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w) was obtained from Sinapharm Chemical reagent Co., Ltd. The sample solutions were prepared using deionized water throughout the experiments.
PAP and AO7 degradation
Oxidation reactions were carried out in a laboratory scale bath reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. For PAP oxidation, the desired amounts of Co2+ and PAP in 25 mL of the aqueous solution were added in a 50 mL flask and kept at 25 °C; then the reaction was initialized by adding HCO3−. In a typical oxidation experiment, the concentrations of the reagents in the reaction mixture were: Co2+ 5 μM, HCO3− 10 mM and PAP 0.183 mM. The reactor was an open system so the concentration of dissolved oxygen remained unchanged during the reaction. A similar process was performed for AO7 degradation with the addition of HCO3− into the solution containing PAP, Co2+ and AO7, but with a higher concentration of the catalyst (10 μM).
Analysis
The HPLC experiments of PAP and its oxidation products were conducted using an Xbridge C-18 column (5 μm particle size, 150 4.6 mm) with methanol–water (2:8, v/v) as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.5 ml min−1 and the detection wavelength was 210 nm. To monitor the dye decolorization process, solution samples taken at different time intervals were measured at 484 nm on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Beijing Rayleigh Analytical Instrument Co. Ltd, China). H2O2 production was determined using a kit (Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).
Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Bruker ESR A-300 spectrometer with the following parameters: a center field of 3516 G, a sweep width of 100 G, a microwave frequency of 9.86 G, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a microwave power of 1 mW.
The mass experiments were performed on an Esquire LC-ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an orthogonal geometry ESI source. Nitrogen was used as the drying (3 L min−1) and nebulizing (6 psi) gas at 300 °C. The spray shield was set to 4.0 kV and the capillary cap was set to 4.5 kV. Scanning was performed from m/z 70 to 800 in the standard resolution mode at a scan rate of 13 kDa s−1. Before analysis, each sample was diluted five times.
Results and discussion
PAP oxidation in HCO3− solution
Bicarbonate (HCO3−), one of the most abundant anions in fresh water, is relatively nontoxic and cheap. A major function of the HCO3−–CO2 couple is to regulate pH, and recently, the role of HCO3− in oxidation reactions with H2O2 was recognized.12,19–21 Here, it was found that in HCO3− solution the rate of PAP can be significantly increased with dioxygen as the oxidant. As shown in Fig. 1(A), there was almost no decrease of PAP concentration in the blank experiment or under similar alkaline conditions (pH 8.2) to that of HCO3− (adjusted by NaOH). In 10 mM HCO3− solution, a much higher oxidation rate was obtained with a PAP conversion of about 82% after 60 min. The oxidation can be inhibited by CAT and can be enhanced by SOD, indicating that H2O2 plays an important role in the reaction. Indeed, a linear increase of H2O2 concentration was observed in Fig. 1(B). However, the concentration was much lower than the theoretical value of 0.183 mM, calculated from the 1:1 molar ratio between PAP and H2O2. These results suggest that the produced H2O2 also took part in the reaction. In a previous work, HCO3− showed high efficiency for degradation of organic pollutants with H2O2 as the oxidant.22 Then the mechanism for PAP oxidation in HCO3− solution is suggested to be similar to that with the HCO3−–H2O2 system: after H2O2 was produced, HCO3− reacted with the oxidant to produce peroxymonocarbonate (HCO4−) as the main reactive species. The decomposition of HCO4− can produce other highly reactive species such as singlet oxygen.

In previous work, the simple cobalt(II) ions showed the highest activity for degradation of pollutants in HCO3− solution with H2O2 as the oxidant among the tested metal ions.12 For PAP oxidation with dioxygen as the oxidant, the strong catalytic effect of 5 μM Co2+ ions was also observed. As shown in Fig. 2(A), complete oxidation occurred after 30 min with the Co2+–HCO3− system. When instead of NaHCO3 other basic solutions such as NaOH at the same pH of 8.2 were used, the reaction was very slow. However, the amount of H2O2 formed during the reaction was much lower than that found in the HCO3− system, as shown in Fig. 2(B), implying the decomposition of the oxidant and formation of other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although Co2+ ions are toxic and not recommended to be added to water, they induce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner, and can only inhibit cell viability at concentrations higher than 50 μM.23 Moreover, according to the emission standard of pollutants for copper, nickel, cobalt industry in china (GB 25467-2010), the concentration of Co2+ ions is allowed to be lower than 16.9 μM and thus the solutions with 5 μM of Co2+ ions can be discharged.

The HPLC spectroscopic results at different reaction times indicate that PAP suffers from hydrolysis resulting in the formation of two main products (shown in Fig. 3). One appeared at about 4.8 min with the concentration first increasing and then decreasing; another at 6.9 min with a slowly increasing concentration with time, indicating that it might come from the decomposition of the former products. The latter product can be attributed to p-benzoquinone, as its retention time was also 6.8 min. Then according to the reported analysis in literature,24 the former may be p-quinonimine.

ROS detection by ESR
In order to further understand the mechanism of PAP oxidation by the Co2+–HCO3− system, the DMPO spin-trapping ESR technique was employed to characterize the catalytic production of ROS. As shown in Fig. 4, a strong four-line ESR spectrum with relative intensities of 1:2:2:1 was observed for the Co2+–PAP–HCO3− system after a reaction of 10 min, which is characteristic of the DMPO–˙OH spin adduct;16 while no spin adducts attributable to ˙OH radicals were observed for other systems such as Co2+–PAP, Co2+–PAP–NaOH, Co2+–HCO3− and HCO3−–PAP, indicating that the three reagents Co2+, HCO3− and PAP are necessary for the radical formation. O2 is also necessary for the reaction to occur. When a solution of DMPO, OAP and HCO3− was first bubbled with N2 gas before Co2+ was added, the resultant DMPO–˙OH ESR signal was significantly decreased. The addition of 0.5 M methanol, a commonly recognized ˙OH radical scavenger,12 completely reduced the DMPO–˙OH ESR signal intensity. The absence of the spin adduct of DMPO–˙OCH3 suggests that the release of free ˙OH in the system apparently does not occur and, hence, seems to have remained tightly associated with the cobalt complex. In addition, the formation of new ESR spectrum characteristics for the spin adduct of DMPO–O2−˙ was observed in the presence of methanol,25 which can be completely scavenged by superoxide dismutase (SOD), evidencing the generation of O2˙− radicals in the system.
 Fig. 4  DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra under different conditions. Conditions: Co2+ 5 μM, HCO3− 10 mM, PAP 0.183 mM, DMPO 25 mM, SOD 300 u mL−1, CAT 1 g L−1, H2O2 0.1 mM, methanol 0.5 M, reaction time 10 min, 25 °C. 
According to literature,26 O2˙− can be trapped by DMPO to produce the DMPO–O2˙− radical adduct, and then rapidly decays to form DMPO–˙OH. To evaluate the role of O2˙− in the formation of DMPO–˙OH, the SOD spin trapping competition experiment was conducted. The contribution of O2˙− radicals was discarded, since the addition of SOD enhanced the intensity of the DMPO–˙OH radical adduct. To examine whether ˙OH radical generation took place via the reduction of H2O2, other experiment was performed under identical conditions in the presence of the H2O2 scavenging enzyme catalase (CAT).26 As addition of CAT diminished the intensity of the ESR signals attributable to the DMPO–˙OH adduct, the ˙OH radical may originate from the Fenton-like reaction between H2O2 and the Co2+–HCO3− complex. Indeed, when 0.1 mM H2O2 was added into the Co2+–HCO3−–PAP system, a much higher intensity of the DMPO–˙OH ESR signal was obtained within 5 min.
To investigate the role of ˙OH radicals in the oxidation of PAP, experiments were also conducted in the presence of scavengers. As illustrated in Fig. 5, after addition of 2.5 M methanol, the concentration of PAP (C/C0) slowly decreased to 0.30 within 60 min. The likely explanation for this phenomenon is that a large portion of generated ˙OH is scavenged, resulting in the reduction of the catalytic efficiency. Although O2˙− can be produced in the presence of methanol, its activity is much lower than that of ˙OH.27 The addition of CAT also decreased the oxidation rate of PAP, which further evidences that H2O2 is an intermediate in the production of ˙OH radicals.

In literature, the generation of H2O2 from dioxygen has been found using zero-valent iron and magnetite nanoparticles.28,29 In the proposed mechanism, the reaction arises primarily by transfer of electrons from a donor to O2 to produce O2˙−, which subsequently undergoes dismutation and protonation, either catalyzed or uncatalyzed, to form H2O2.28 Due to the detection of O2˙− in the Co2+–HCO3− system, it is then hypothesized that the mechanism of generation of H2O2 by the HCO3− or Co2+–HCO3− system is similar to that of zero-valent iron.29 Once formed, H2O2 reacts with Co2+ ions to produce ˙OH through Fenton reaction, as the Co2+–HCO3− system is very efficient for H2O2 activation in the presence of substrates with high coordination ability, just as described in our previous studies.12,13
Co2+ oxidation
As many cobalt(II) complexes such as cobalt(II)–triethylamine and cobalt(II)–monoethanolamine produce the hydroxyl radicals in a so-called Haber–Weiss catalytic cycle,15,16 it is then supposed that the formation of ROS in the Co2+–HCO3− system may also be attributed to the oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III). The change in the oxidation state of Co2+ ions in the Co2+–HCO3− system in the presence of H2O2 can be confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. From Fig. 6(A) it can be seen that after the addition of H2O2 into the system, a significant increase of absorbance at 260 nm and 400 nm was observed. This was consistent with a previous report that the maximum absorption of the Co(III) complex Na3[Co(CO3)3] in HCO3− solution appeared at 260 nm and 440 nm,30 suggesting that Co(II) in the Co2+–HCO3− system was oxidized to Co(III). However, during PAP oxidation with the Co2+–HCO3− system, the color intermediate products interfered the observation of Co(III) species. As the rate of PAP oxidation increased with an increase in solution pH and the color of solution became much lighter under strong alkaline conditions, we carried out the experiment in 5 mM Na2CO3 solution instead of NaHCO3. As shown in Fig. 6(B), after a reaction of 40 min, the Abs at 300 nm for PAP disappeared. For the Co2+–CO32− system, an obvious Abs at 400 nm appeared, while for the CO32− system there was nearly no absorption between 330 nm and 700 nm. These results suggest the presence of Co(III) species in the Co2+–CO32− system. However, the contribution of the high oxidation cobalt species to the reaction was little, as nearly no oxidation of PAP occurred when it was added into the solution containing PAP, Co2+ and CO32−, which were pre-reacted at room temperature for 40 min, probably because HCO3− and NH4+ can effectively stabilize this higher oxidation state in aqueous solvent systems and thus decrease its activity.27

Effect of HCO3−
Similar to Mn2+ and Cu2+,31,32 the Co2+ ions can form complexes with HCO3−. At low HCO3− concentrations, the hydrolyzed Co2+ species and [CoII(HCO3)]+ are likely to mainly coexist, while at high concentrations (10–100 mM), the [Co(HCO3)2] predominates.12 To clarify the role of HCO3− in the Co2+–HCO3− system, the effect of its concentration in the range of 0–100 mM on ˙OH radical production and PAP oxidation was studied. As shown in Fig. 7, the intensity of the DMPO–˙OH radical adduct did not change monotonously with the increase of HCO3− concentration, but first rose, reaching the maximum at 20 mM of HCO3−, and then decreased. A similar trend of PAP oxidation against HCO3− concentration was observed but with the highest value obtained at 10 mM HCO3− (Fig. 8). During organic dye decolorization by the Co2+–HCO3− system with H2O2 as the oxidant, the highest reaction rate was also obtained at the same concentration of HCO3−.12,13 The results imply that the formed complex [CoII(HCO3)]+ is the major active species for ˙OH radical production and PAP oxidation. At higher concentrations, the complexes with a higher number of HCO3− ions complexed to Co2+ ions, such as Co(HCO3)2 or Co(CO3)22−, may be formed, and there will be no equatorial positions available to bind PAP and O2, leading to the decrease in efficiency.

A possible catalytic mechanism
Based on above obtained results, Scheme 1 was proposed as a tentative pathway for PAP oxidation by the Co2+–HCO3− system. The first step involves the direct oxidation of PAP by dioxygen with the formation of superoxide ions and H2O2; the next is coordination of H2O2 to the complex [CoII(HCO3−)]+ to form the stable [CoII(HCO3−)(H2O2)]+ complex and its dissociation to a transient caged HO˙ radical through transfer of an electron from Co2+. The radicals then attack the N and O atoms of PAP, resulting in the formation of p-quinonimine, which was then further decomposed to p-benzoquinone. The Co(III) species can be reduced to be Co(II) by another H2O2 with the formation of O2−˙ radicals. In addition, H2O2 can react with HCO3− to form HCO4− and partly contributes to PAP oxidation.

Oxidation of different aminophenols
The oxidation of other aminophenols including MAP and OAP with the Co2+–HCO3− system was tested, and it is found that the rates are very different, depending on the position of the amino group. As shown in Fig. 9(A), only 80% of OAP was oxidized within 150 min, and nearly no oxidation of MAP occurred within 240 min. From the figure, one can also see that MAP and OAP are stable unlike PAP in HCO3− solution without Co2+ ions. In Fig. 9(B), the signal of HO˙ radicals decreased in the presence of OAP and was completely invisible with MAP, consistent with their oxidation rates. During the spectroelectrochemical study of aminophenol oxidation on a platinum electrode by Salavagione et al., the cyclic voltammograms of PAP, OAP and MAP revealed an oxidation current at 0.8, 0.86 and 1.1 V, respectively.33 The higher the oxidation current, the more difficult the compound oxidation. Then the trend in the oxidation of aminophenols by the Co2+–HCO3− system can be explained by their redox potentials.

Decolorization of AO7
When AO7, an azo dye, was added into the current system, the decolorization of the dye occurred (shown in Fig. 10(A)), while no reaction occurred in other systems such as Co2+–HCO3−, HCO3−–PAP, Co2+–HCO3−–OAP and Co2+–HCO3−–MAP. When Co2+ ions were replaced with other metal ions such as Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Fe3+ and Ce3+, there was still no decolorization of AO7 observed during 60 min, suggesting that the produced ˙OH radicals in the Co2+–HCO3−–PAP system are active for dye oxidation. The ESR spectra during AO7 decolorization were then performed with the results shown in Fig. 10(B). The intensity of the HO˙ radical adduct was still present, and a new DMPO carbon-centered adduct signal appeared and increased with AO7 concentration, which might be formed by the reaction of AO7 and HO˙ radicals.27 For other reported H2O2-based oxidation systems such as the cobalt(II)–monoethanolamine complex, the signal of similar adducts has not been observed.16 This may be attributed to the free reactive oxygen species present in these systems, while in the Co2+–HCO3−–H2O2 system, both the HO˙ radical and AO7 were associated with the cobalt complex, and thus the radical was much easier to attack the substrates. The degradation reaction can be further confirmed by ESI-MS measurements. As indicated in Fig. 11, the intensity of AO7 dramatically decreased after 60 min.

Conclusion
In summary, the oxidation of PAP by the simple Co2+ ions in HCO3− aqueous solution was investigated with dioxygen as the oxidant at a temperature of 25 °C, with a particular emphasis on mechanistic details of reactive oxygen species formation. It was found that the bound HO˙ radical was produced as the main reactive species from two steps: (i) the O2−˙ mediated production of H2O2, and (ii) the reaction of formed H2O2 with the Co2+–HCO3− complex to produce ˙OH through Fenton reaction. The system can even be used for the decolorization of azo dye with the participation of highly active ˙OH radicals. This study can provide new insight into the molecular oxygen activation mechanism of a simple metal complex and its application to the oxidation of pollutants under mild reaction conditions.
