1. Introduction
The unique spherical structure of fullerenes, with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and extended π-conjugation, produces numerous fascinating optoelectronic properties, which have gathered much interest for applications in nanoelectronics and photovoltaics.1,2 In particular, C60 was found to behave as a strongly electron-accepting molecule able to reversibly accept up to six electrons. In addition, C60, C70 and their derivatives show exceptional electronic absorption bands expanding throughout the entire UV-Vis spectrum, which is promising for their extensive use in photovoltaic devices such as solar cells and FET.3–5 Therefore, manipulating the intermolecular interaction and assembly of fullerenes on the nano/micrometer length scale is crucial for developing various functional nanostructures with controlled dimensionality and tailored properties. However, precisely fine-tuning the π–π interaction in adjacent spherical-shaped pristine fullerenes is still challenging although the face-to-face packing of planar conjugated-π units is rather well known.1,6 As a result, various C60 derivatives themselves or with electron-donating organic/inorganic compounds have been designed and studied for constructing highly functional, sophisticated assembled materials and improving the performance of organic optoelectronic devices,2,7–11 which are still challenging tasks.12
The recent interest in fullerene research in materials chemistry is mainly devoted to the understanding of molecular-level interaction and morphology-oriented functions and applications.1,6 Because of the high potential of fullerene-containing materials for photovoltaic development, our most recent achievements of the advanced controlled assembly of C60 and its derivatives towards improved photoconductivity and applications using photo-energy, i.e. electric and thermal, conversion processes will be presented. The alkyloxyphenyl substituted N-methylfulleropyrrolidines, namely, alkylated-C6013 (Scheme 1), a new family of C60 derivatives, have received considerable attention in recent years. They have shown a variety of interesting properties and functions in the development of soft materials such as liquid crystals, solvent-free liquids and other assembled architectures with various shapes and dimensions for photo-energy conversions.

2. Fullerene assemblies with enhanced photoconductivity
2.1 Alkylated fullerene assemblies
The intrinsic properties of C60 are expected to be transferred or modulated in the film and/or bulk materials by forming various self-assembled C60 architectures. For instance, a high performance solution-processed thin-film transistor (TFT) based on an alkylated-C60 was successfully fabricated.14 Liquid crystals (LCs) are a state of matter between the liquid and the solid state, which are referred to as intermediate phases or mesophases. C60 is a promising electron-transporting material and an n-type organic semiconductor due to its spherical π-conjugated framework that can easily accept and transport electrons through the ordered structure.15,16 Recently, C60-based LCs have found applications in photovoltaics because of the optoelectronic features as well as the self-organization ability at the molecular level in a pre-determined and controllable fashion, also because of their softness in developing flexible devices.17–19 However, the content of C60 is usually low due to the attached large and bulky mesogens for the effective alignment of C60 units, which may be one of the main factors for the low carrier mobility. Our group recently reported that the alkylated-C60 derivatives such as 1 (Fig. 1a) with high C60 content (up to 50% in case of only two linear chains attachment) satisfy the requirements for high carrier mobility in the mesophase.20 As revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopic (POM) studies, 1 shows a mesophase with the wide temperature range between 62 and 193 °C (Fig. 1b), proved by its fluid and birefringent characteristics. The attached alkyl chains adjust the π–π interactions between C60 units to form a regularly ordered lamellar (smectic) phase. A further detailed organized structure has been investigated, an alternative arrangement of the C60 units and the molten alkyl chains with an interlayer distance of 5.59 nm, by combination analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron density profile simulation (Fig. 1c and d).21 It should be mentioned that the electrochemical and optoelectronic properties of 1 are maintained in the mesomorphic state. For instance, the mesomorphic state of 1 exhibits reversible redox activity as cast films on a glassy carbon electrode. The electron mobility was found to be ∼3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 from a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement, indicating that densely packed C60 molecules carried charges efficiently. This mobility value is comparable to those of smectic LCs of organic semiconductor oligomers and columnar LCs.22,23 The simple modification of C60 with long alkyl chains permits a high C60 content in the mesomorphic materials, resulting in a high electron mobility value for C60-containing LCs reported so far.

A delicate balance between the intermolecular interactions introduced by C60–C60 and van der Waals forces among the attached units and the assembly environments lead to a wide variety of supramolecular architectures and functions, which provide an effective way for sophisticated molecular design of C60 derivatives.7,13 For instance, attachment of branched aliphatic chains on the π-conjugated molecule can soften π-based materials and enable the formation of thermotropic LCs and room temperature nonvolatile liquids.24–26 As we reported recently, the alkylated-C60 bearing two swallow tail-type alkyl chains at the (3 and 5)-positions of the phenyl moiety (2, Fig. 2a) has a melting point of only 84 °C, which is approximately 109 °C lower than that of 1, and exhibits a smectic phase extending to room temperature (Fig. 2b).24 The bulk heterojunction organic solar cells composed of an active layer of 2 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.6%, which is comparable to that of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/P3HT in our device setup. In contrast, the composite of 1 and P3HT exhibits a PCE of only 0.5% under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2c). The improvement of open-circuit voltage (VOC) for 2/P3HT compared with those of PCBM/P3HT and 1/P3HT could be caused by the difference in their interfacial interaction with P3HT.27,28 The improved performance of the 2/P3HT system could be ascribed to the presence of the branched aliphatic chains, which may facilitate lowering the crystallinity and improvement of the charge transport capability. This makes such molecules good candidates for the preparation of organic solar cells with soft and flexible characteristics.

2.2 Fullerene coassemblies
High C60 content and appropriate π stacking orientation in the semiconducting active layer in photovoltaic devices are significantly important to retain better performance. In this context, basically insulating alkyl chains have a negative influence on reduction of C60 content. Generally smaller substituent groups are attached on C60 towards improvement of their optoelectronic properties.29,30 What happens if there are no alkyl chain attachments in the same phenyl-substituted N-methylfulleropyrrolidines? Solvent vapor diffusion is a unique strategy for the preparation of crystalline materials from solution. By using this method, the coassembly of C60 derivatives has been used to develop millimeter-sized flat crystalline sheets with ordered surface pattern and morphology.31 As shown in Fig. 3, the phenyl and perfluorophenyl interaction32 in the small substitution units has been used to control the solubility and assembly properties of C60 derivatives 3 and 4 (Fig. 3a).31 Atomic force microscope (AFM) images (Fig. 3b) of the crystal surface show long straight patterns, which show the presence of well-ordered steps with an average height of ∼2.0 nm, while the single crystal X-ray analysis revealed the bimolecular layer organization of the molecules throughout the crystal. The coassembled crystal exhibits good anisotropy, with over double the charge carrier mobility in the parallel direction to the plane of the crystal than perpendicular to the plane due to the dense π-stacking along the surface of the crystal (Fig. 3c). The development of such large flat sheet crystals with anisotropies will be useful in different switchable optoelectronic devices.

Constructing composites of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs) and organic molecules is attractive for the economical optoelectronic applications in the concept of flexible devices.33,34 Recently, solvent-free, photoconductive or emissive organic liquid materials have been developed as a new type of organic soft materials.35 Their unique features, such as nonvolatility, tunable optic and/or electronic functions, solvent-free processing, and the ability to act as a solvent/matrix for other organic or inorganic components, are essential for their practical applications. In this context, various solvent-free liquid materials and composites have been reported by our group.26,36 For example, the nanocomposite of cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in photoconductive liquid C60 derivative 537 (Fig. 4a) has been prepared.38 The CdSe NCs are well-dispersed in the liquid phase of 5, as confirmed by HR-TEM analysis of a 1:1 (by weight) blending of 5 and CdSe NCs. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements show that the PL from optically excited CdSe NCs is dramatically quenched in 10 wt% of 5, which can be ascribed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the hexadecylamine ligands on CdSe NCs and alkyl pendant groups of 5. The photoelectrochemical measurements of the solvent-free CdSe NCs–5 composite film on the FTO electrode show that the photocurrent under white light illumination is 2-fold and under blue-light illumination is 3-fold higher than those of pure CdSe NCs (Fig. 4b). The LUMO level difference of CdSe NCs (−3.84 eV) and C60 (−4.30 eV) facilitates exciton separation of photo-generated excitons in the CdSe NCs phase as well as electron transfers from CdSe NCs to 5, which was supported by the cathodic photocurrents in the photoelectrochemical measurements in Fig. 4b.38 This result shows that the inter-phase charge transfer in CdSe NCs–5 composites provides a convenient route for conversion of optical energy to electrical energy.

3. Photo-energy conversion in nanocarbon hybrids
Nanocarbon hybrids have received intense interest towards developing lightweight and flexible devices. The hybridization of C60 with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) would couple the optical and electronic properties of SWCNTs together with the electron-accepting feature of C60.39–46 The high affinity of the alkylated-C60 towards the graphitic structure8 allows direct assembly between alkylated-C60 and the SWCNT surface followed by the formation of microstructured composites.47 When sonicated in a solvent such as THF, a stable dispersion of 1/SWCNTs can be obtained. The direct interaction between 1 and SWCNTs facilitated charge transport and charge collection. The photoinduced electron transfer was proven by the combination of several spectroscopic techniques such as steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence studies, and the nanosecond transient absorption. For instance, the nanosecond transient absorption studies show the presence of the C60 radical anion upon laser illumination for 1/SWCNTs, however, it is not observed for 1, indicating that 1 acts as an acceptor (Fig. 5a). The photoelectrochemical measurements revealed a prompt, steady and reproducible short-circuit photocurrent of the hybrid, which is about 160-fold larger than that of 1, and 18-fold larger than that of SWCNTs (Fig. 5b). Photoconductivity evaluation by using a single-SWCNT field-effect transistor (FET) device showed that the decoration of SWCNTs with 1 in the nanodevice has induced a transition of gate transfer characteristics (Fig. 5c). The 1-decorated SWCNT-FET shows unipolar p-type transport with gate threshold voltage positively shifting by ∼5 V, while the SWCNT-FET shows ambipolar characteristics. This p-type characteristic is attributed to the charge transfer between 1 and local parts of SWCNTs, suggesting that 1 exerts a strong electron acceptor effect on SWCNTs. In a similar way, the decoration of graphene devices with clusters of 1 (Fig. 5d) shows clear hole-doping effects and a pronounced increase in gate hysteresis upon illumination with visible light, enabling the use of the C60-graphene hybrid materials in three-terminal photo-memory devices.48

The photo-thermal conversion feature of SWCNTs upon absorbing near-infrared (NIR) light has the potential for a wide range of applications such as drug delivery and cancer therapies.49–51 Although the local temperature change is crucial for the applications, the accurate measurement of temperature increase induced by the SWCNT local heating is challenging.52 In this regard, the microparticles or microplates containing C60 derivatives (i.e., 1) and SWCNTs have been developed as a temperature indicator,39 where SWCNTs are used as a light antenna and 1 as a matrix (Fig. 6). The temperature increase upon NIR irradiation was confirmed via the melt-induced morphological change of nanocarbon assemblies. Due to the noncovalent interaction between 1 and the side walls of SWCNTs, minute amounts of SWCNTs can be debundled in 1,4-dioxane at 70 °C by sonication. Upon cooling to room temperature, a uniform coassembly of 1 and SWCNTs was obtained, whose morphology and microparticle structure (Fig. 6) are similar to those of only 1,9 as revealed by SEM, HR-cryo-TEM, FTIR, and XRD studies. Upon NIR laser illumination, the flake-shaped 1–SWCNT assemblies started to “deform” and melt. In contrast, the microparticles only composed of 1 did not respond to the laser illumination, suggesting that the heating is due to the “photo-thermal conversion” of SWCNTs. The deformation of the micrometer-scale C60–SWCNT assembly can be easily visualized by optical microscopy, thus providing great convenience while monitoring temperature in situ during photo-thermal conversion. Moreover, the assembly melting point can be tuned to a desired range by the molecular design of the C60 derivative. Thus, C60–SWCNT coassembly can be used as a temperature indicator for the photothermal conversion of SWCNTs under NIR light irradiation. By incorporating gold nanoparticles or SWCNTs into the C60 assemblies, the coassemblies were used for the precise control of the surface architecture on the micrometer length scale, i.e., to initiate particle fusion, partial melting of the aggregates, and bridging particles.53 Moreover, the surface wetting control can also be achieved via this technique. Our current research concept can be adopted for many applications such as local wetting control, lithography and morphological control of the functional materials.53

4. Conclusion and outlook
Functionalizing C60 by attaching a variety of alkyl chains facilitates fine-tuning of the intermolecular interaction, and herein the functional assemblies and materialization. By precisely controlling the C60–C60 interaction, assembled nanostructures and surface morphology, C60 based soft materials exhibit promising properties and specific optoelectronic functions. Development of the coassemblies of alkylated-C60 with sophisticated organic/inorganic compounds for specific tasks such as designing suitable D–A systems was proved to be an effective way for enhancing photoconductivity and photovoltaic performance. In other cases, the hybridization of alkylated-C60 with SWCNTs allows constructing a temperature indicator for the photo-thermal conversion of SWCNTs upon NIR light irradiation. It is therefore clear that alkylated-C60 for the self-assembly and assembly control of molecular constructs by assembling different binding motifs offers opportunities for the development of new generation, nanocarbon-based soft materials towards applications in photo-energy conversion. These advanced fullerene assemblies are opening up bright avenues for chemists for the exploitation of new properties and applications. It should be emphasized that research studies are now directed towards further development of soft materials and devices containing them, and our effort would be beneficial for those future endeavors.
