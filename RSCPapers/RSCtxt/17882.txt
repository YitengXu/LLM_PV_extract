    , Accepted 27th December 2021First published on 29th December 2021AbstractTraditional metal and cermet cathodes are easily oxidized when performing CO2 electrolysis without flowing reducing gas, resulting in the degradation of the electrolysis performance. Ceramic cathodes would demonstrate durable performance but their catalytic activity is normally limited. Here we engineer the perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co1−xFexO3−δ (LSC1−xFx, x = 0–1) with synergistic doping in the B site to tailor the catalytic activity. In this work, we synthesize perovskite materials LSC1−xFx and explore their electrochemical performance. The replacement of Co with Fe increases the concentration of low valence Fe ions linked to oxygen vacancies and improves the catalytic activity for CO2 electrolysis. The LSC0.2F0.8 cathode has the highest electrochemical performance with a current density of 0.92 A cm−2 and a CO production of 5.49 ml min−1 cm−2 at 1.6 V and 850 °C. We show the excellent chemical stability in CO2 electrolysis through continuous operation for 100 h. This work provides a new idea for improving the catalytic activity and stability of perovskite cathode materials in solid oxide electrolysis cells.
Introduction
The excessive consumption of fossil fuels has resulted in increasingly severe energy shortages, global warming, environmental pollution and other problems, making the development of human society unsustainable.1–3 The electrolysis of CO2 in a solid oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) powered by renewable energy sources, such as solar and tidal energy, has received considerable attention because of its ability to recycle the greenhouse gas CO2 into a fuel and to simultaneously store renewable energy.4–8 SOEC can provide a high electrolysis efficiency and operational stability owing to its excellent thermodynamic and kinetic advantages. Therefore, SOEC for CO2 electroreduction is considered to be the best choice.
To date, CO2 electroreduction has experienced decades of research and achieved rapid development. In 1994, Hori and coworkers systematically analysed the effects of different electrolytes for the catalytic activity and selectivity of CO2 electro-reduction.9,10 Regrettably, the study was short of the exploration of whether the electrolyte can remain stable for a long time. In 2015, the study by Kanan and colleagues showed that a high specific surface area and density of the catalyst are beneficial to increase the reaction activity.11,12 However, its catalytic activity is still limited by the structure of the catalyst interface. In addition, CO2 has also been studied for co-electrolysis with H2O to produce H2 and low-carbon fuels.13,14 In recent years, most studies have focused on the design of catalysts. As is well-known, the catalyst used in the process of CO2 electro-reduction needs to meet many factors, such as high electronic and ionic conductivity, high catalytic activity for CO2 splitting, stable structure and so on.
Therefore, how to design a high efficiency and stable catalytic electrode has become the top priority for the development of modern electrocatalytic technology. The traditional La0.6Sr0.4MnO3−δ (LSM) electrodes are widely used in SOEC cathode materials, but a long-term test of high temperature operation is accompanied by phase separation and carbon deposition, which lead to a serious decline in the catalytic activity.15–17 In contrast, the perovskite oxide La0.6Sr0.4Co1−xFexO3−δ (LSCF) is considered as the cathode material with the most potential, due to its high conductivity, catalytic activity and long-term stability in the high temperature working environment.18–20
Synergistic doping with active elements in the B site in the perovskite cathode would tailor the electrical properties and engineer the electrochemical performance. For example, the engineering of chemical composition, especially the Co/Fe ratio, would impact the electrical properties and the electrochemical performance.
Here we synthesize perovskite La0.6Sr0.4Co1−xFexO3−δ (x = 0–1) materials and engineer the chemical composition of Co and Fe in the B site in the lattice. We aim to optimize the chemical composition of Co and Fe in the B site to obtain high-performance cathode materials and perform CO2 electrolysis.

Fig. 1 shows the reaction mechanism of the CO2 electrolysis process. In this process, by applying a certain voltage at high temperature, CO2 is spilt into CO and an oxygen ion (O2−); meanwhile, O2− is transported to the surface of the anode through the electrolyte to form O2 which effectively reduces greenhouse gases and realizes the conversion of electrical and thermal energy into chemical energy. The cathode reaction is specifically expressed as follows: CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−, and the anode reaction is: O2− − 2e− → 1/2O2.21–24 In electrolysis, the ceramic cathode with redox stability would well fit the operation conditions and perform CO2 electrolysis without flowing reducing gas to protect the cathode from being oxidized.

Experimental
A series of La0.6Sr0.4Co1−xFexO3−δ powder samples were synthesized by the glycine–nitrate combustion method,25,26 in which appropriate amounts of La2O3, Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were mixed evenly and sintered at 1200 °C for 6 h in air. Ce0.8Sm0.2O3−δ(SDC) powders were synthesized though the glycine–nitrate combustion method with appropriate amounts of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O and Sm2O3 followed by incubation at 800 °C for 3 h in air.27,28 The La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3−δ (LSGM) sample was synthesized using a solid state reaction method with certain ratios of La2O3, SrCO3, Ga2O3 and MgO mixed by acetone in a zirconia container with zirconia balls, sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h, then pressed into a disc and further calcinated at 1500 °C for 10 h.29,30
The electrode slurry, LSC1−xFx-SDC (a weight ratio of 65:35), was obtained by milling celluloses (20% of the total weight of the anode slurry); amylum (5% of the total weight of the anode slurry) and alpha-terpineol were added into the slurry for making pores, then coated onto both sides of the LSGM with an active area of 0.5 cm2, and treated at 1100 °C for 3 h in air. Ag paste was painted on the surfaces of the anode and cathode, and then a Ag wire was stuck to the surface of the Ag paste to assemble a single solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE).
We used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to characterize the crystal structure of the synthesized powder. The diffraction patterns were collected by step scanning in the range of 2θ from 20° to 80° at a scanning speed of 10° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. A field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (SU-8010, Hitachi, 5 KV) was used to characterize the sample microstructure. The current–voltage curves were recorded using an electrochemical station (JD-9768 A). The CO production was collected through an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan).
Results and discussion

Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of La0.6Sr0.4Co1−xFexO3−δ (x = 0, LSC; x = 0.2, LSC0.8F0.2; x = 0.4, LSC0.6F0.4; x = 0.6, LSC0.4F0.6; x = 0.8, LSC0.2F0.8; and x = 1, LSF). All the peaks of the LSCF samples can be indexed to a pure ABO3-type perovskite phase.31,32 The crystal structure remained, no matter how the proportions of the elements changed. Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM images of LSC0.2F0.8-SDC on LSGM before the tests. It can be seen that the LSGM electrolyte is dense (non-porous), and the LSCF is porous and the porous structure well adheres to the LSGM electrolyte. Dense electrolytes without pores facilitate oxygen-ion transportation, while the porous LSCF catalysts promote the cathode to react with CO2 at active surfaces.

It is reported that oxygen vacancies play an active role in improving the activity of perovskite oxides. For instance, more oxygen vacancies are conducive to a higher oxygen electrolysis rate.33 The exchange kinetics and chemical stability can be improved by increasing the concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface.34Fig. 3 shows thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of LSCF from 200 to 1000 °C, which can be divided into two sections. Firstly, the weight of LSCF almost remained the same when the temperature is below 550 °C. After this, the continuously decreasing weight with increase of the temperature suggests the loss of lattice oxygen. This means the generation of oxygen vacancies. As the temperature continuously increased, the lost lattice oxygen increases significantly, resulting in an increase of oxygen vacancies, which explains the enhanced catalytic activity and electrolytic efficiency.

Fig. 4 shows the chemical valence states of Co 2p and Fe 2p on the surface of the electrode. For the Co 2p profile in Fig. 4(a), two significant peaks are Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, with binding energies (EB) of 776–786 and 792–798 eV. We also detect that there are two satellite peaks at EB of ∼ 783 and ∼ 803 eV respectively, indicating that the metal has a mixed valence state. From the main peak of Co 2p3/2, the fitting peak at ∼781.3 eV is in line with the characteristic of low valence states, such as Co2+ and Co3+. Similarly, from Fig. 4(b), two apparent peaks can be observed at EB of ∼710.7 eV and ∼724 eV, corresponding to Fe3+ 2p3/2 or Fe2+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p1/2 in the sequence. The oxygen vacancies increase with the increase of the concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ according to TGA analysis as shown in Fig. 3. As the Fe doping increases and the temperature increases, the loss of lattice oxygen occurs, thereby generating oxygen vacancies. This is consistent with the XPS analysis, in which the Fe2+ and Fe3+ peaks at ∼710.7 eV and ∼724 eV ascend while increasing the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O precursor. However, when the substitution of Fe for Co is complete, there are some Fe2+ ions that are oxidized to Fe4+, which corresponded to the fitting peak at EB of ∼713 eV and ∼730 eV. In addition, there may also exist the species Fe5+ owing to the instability of Fe4+, which is easily oxidized.35 Furthermore, Table 1 demonstrates the distributions of iron ion valences from the XPS results.

Conductivity is one of the most important physical properties of cathode materials, which directly affects the charge transfer process in electrolysis cells. Herein, the conductivity of the LSC1−xFx (x = 0–1) cathode materials were measured by the direct current four-terminal method. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images of the catalyst LSCF with different ratios of Co and Fe. The conductivity of the cathode materials is closely related to the density of the material because macroscopic holes in the material will cause electron transfer interruption resulting in performance degradation. Therefore, we first press the electrode material (LSCF) into small strips, then heat-treat it at 1400 °C for 10 h, and finally use a SEM to image its cross-section to determine the degree of compactness. It is shown from the SEM images that, although there is a slight morphology difference, no macroscopic holes were observed for all samples, indicating that the sample was dense enough to meet the requirements of measuring conductivity.

Fig. 6(a) shows the change in electrical conductivity with temperature of the series of samples LSC1−xFx (x = 0–1) in air. The conductivity of the LSCF sample in the oxidized state increases at the beginning and then decreases, reaching a maximum at 550 °C, which suggests a semiconductive behavior at a low temperature followed by a metallic behavior.36–38 This is attributed to the increase of the carrier concentration with ascending temperature, which can be demonstrated by the Arrhenius relationship. With the increase of the Fe element, the conductivity of all the samples gradually decreases as shown in Fig. 6(b). The conductivity of LSC0.2F0.8 reaches as high as 328.51 S cm−1 at 850 °C in air, basically consistent with the report,39,40 indicating the outstanding electrical ability of the LSC0.2F0.8 material.

Fig. 7 shows the AC impedance spectra with the LSCF-SDC cathode at 1.2–1.6 V. It can be seen that with the increase of applied potential, the electrode polarization (Rp) decreases, indicating that the increase of the applied potential is conducive to activating the electrode and improving the electrode activity. We see that LSC0.2F0.8 shows the optimum polarization resistance reaching 0.22 Ω cm−2 when applied with 1.8 V. Therefore, the polarization resistance further proves the excellent catalytic activity of LSC0.2F0.8. The value of the ohmic resistance (Rs) for LSCF is similar,41i.e. 0.25 Ω cm−2, which is usually ascribed to the same electrolyte.

Fig. 8 shows the electrolytic results and catalytic performance of electrode materials with different proportions of Co and Fe. Fig. 8(a) is the current–voltage (I–V) curve with an applied potential from 0.6 to 1.8 V at 850 °C. We see that the onset potential of CO2 electrolysis is 0.9 V, indicating that CO2 begins to be reduced. Fig. 8(b) shows the short-term current curve under different potentials. The current density with the optimum composition of LSC0.2F0.8 is 4–5 times higher than that of LSC. The improved current density is attributed to the increase of the low valence Fe ion; thus, the catalytic activity is improved. Fig. 8(c) shows the CO production under different potentials. The CO production with an optimum composition of LSC0.2F0.8 reaches 5.49 ml min−1 cm−2 at 1.6 V. Compared with LSC, the CO production of LSC0.2F0.8 is increased by 5 times. It is obvious that the yield of CO increases with the increase of the Fe ion. This shows that the low valence Fe ion on the surface of the catalyst contributes to CO2 to CO positively. It is also shown that the oxide cathode, as a mixed conductor, can reduce CO2 to CO very well by the oxygen vacancy which is formed at high temperature. Fig. 8(d) shows the current efficiency of the different electrode materials. LSC0.2F0.8 presents a current efficiency of 98.2%, which is ∼23% higher than that of LSC. This means that the oxygen vacancy which is formed by the reduction of iron ions at high temperature could be active for breaking the CO bonds of CO2 to form CO.42–45 By comparison, the decreased performance of CO2 to CO conversion for LSF may be due to some of the Fe2+ present on the electrode surface being oxidized to Fe4+.

We investigate the adsorption of CO2 in powder samples by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 9(a), all the samples show two IR absorption peaks in the same place. The first stretch peak is at 1400–1500 cm−1, which is normally related to carbonate ions (CO32−). The second vibrational peak at 2300–2400 cm−1 is attributed to molecular CO2. These results indicate that the porous structure of the electrode surface is helpful in adsorbing carbon dioxide. Fig. 9(b) shows the long-term test with CO2 electrolysis for 60 h at 850 °C. We demonstrate that the current density keeps steady after a long-term test, indicating that LSC0.2F0.8 is an excellent electrode material for conversion of CO2 to CO. Fig. 9(c) shows the microscopic morphology of the solid oxide electrolyzer after CO2 electrolysis. It is obvious that the porous structure shows no clear changes before and after the tests, which also proves the outstanding structural stability of LSCF. Furthermore, we use the XRD technique to test the powder after CO2 electrolysis with high temperature operation. There is no other material appearing in the crystal after the test as shown in Fig. 9(d), which suggests that the materials are stable even after high temperature treatments.

Conclusions
To sum up, we show the significantly enhanced electrode activity through engineering the chemical composition by synergistic doping in the B site in the lattice, which leads to the increase of the oxygen vacancies. The CO product of LSC0.2F0.8 reaches 5.49 mL min−1 cm−2 with a high current efficiency as high as 98.2%, which is 5 times higher than the counterpart sample LSC. Furthermore, it maintains excellent stability even after high-temperature operation of 100 h, indicating that LSC0.2F0.8 would be an attractive cathode material for CO2 electrolysis at high temperature.
