    , Accepted 3rd April 2019First published on 4th April 2019AbstractDip coating fabrication is considered as an effective solution processing approach that can be easily extended to scale-up QD film production. In this study, CdSexTe1−x quantum dot (QD) films prepared by a dip coating process are introduced to assemble broadband (UV-NIR) photovoltaic detectors. During the dip coating process, the long organic chain ligands (oleic acid) on the surface of the QDs were replaced with short inorganic ligands (iodide) to facilitate charge transport. Finally, a homogeneous large-area (20 cm2) QD film was obtained. As a result, the QD-based photodetector possessed the fast response speed of <20 ms, the high detectivity of 4.6 × 1012 Jones, and the broad wavelength response range of 300–850 nm without external bias voltage. The device displayed excellent long-term stability in ex situ tests, exceeding 2000 hours without encapsulation. These results suggest that the dip coating method described herein presents a significant step towards the large-scale preparation and extensive promotion of quantum dot film-based optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are nanometer-sized fragments of their corresponding bulk semiconductor crystals, which are typically synthesized and processed as solution species.1 They are generally defined as nanocrystals with sizes close to or below the Bohr radius of the bound state of an exciton.2 The quantum confinement effect is perhaps the most attractive characteristic of QDs, in which the motions of electrons and holes are spatially confined and the electron and hole energy levels become discrete in QDs.3 The emission color of the QDs can also be tuned by controlling their sizes and compositions; this provides access to solution-processable emitters covering ultraviolet (UV), visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths.3 Another characteristic of QDs is their pronounced multiple exciton generation (MEG).4 MEG within quantum-confined QDs describes a process where absorption of a high-energy photon produces hot carriers that are cooled via the generation of additional excitons rather than the generation of heat, thus overcoming some of the losses associated with hot-carrier cooling.5,6 As a result, the quantum efficiency is greater than 100% for wavelengths that can produce hot carriers with sufficient energy to drive the MEG process.7 Efficient MEG processes have been reported in PbS,5 PbSe,8 PbTe,9 CdSe10 and Si QDs.11 In addition to their quantum confinement effect and MEG, other superb features such as high extinction coefficients12 and excellent photochemical stability13 set the QDs apart. Because of their striking advantages, steady efforts have been devoted to the application of QDs, whose sizes, shapes and surface chemistry can be engineered; moreover, they can be deposited from solutions to be integrated as thin-film solids in electronic and optoelectronic devices that can modulate and transmit charge or transduce light and electricity.14–16 Therefore, QDs have been used to realize recent achievements in high-mobility transistors,17 high-quantum-yield photodetectors,18,19 light-emitting devices20,21 and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.22 Especially, the development of QDs for application in photodetectors has come a long way. Photodetectors with tunable PbS QDs have recently been reported with remarkable sensitivities of up to 1.5 × 1012 Jones.14 Flexible and transparent photodetectors with broad response ranges based on perovskite QDs have been successfully fabricated.19 Mid-wave infrared photodetectors fabricated with HgTe QDs have been reported. In addition, thermal images can be captured with these devices.18
The technique for the deposition of QD films is a key step in optoelectronic device development. Various methods have been developed in recent decades. Successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)23 and chemical bath deposition (CBD)24 are both in situ deposition methods which involve simple and easy-to-operate deposition processes; meanwhile, the QD films obtained by these methods always suffer from the problems of poor quality crystal, non-uniform distribution of the particle size and undesired surface defects. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)25,26 is a popular and powerful tool for the fabrication of complex nanostructure nanomaterials due to its unique self-limiting nature and precise control of film thickness. Rigorous operating conditions and expensive and complex deposition equipment invariably limit the promotion of ALD for QD films. The multilayer spin-coating method27 is widely used in thin films; it can preserve the crystal quality and does not require sophisticated equipment. However, this technique is not suitable for large-scale fabrication. It is difficult for these techniques to meet the requirements of industrialization due to their poor film quality, elaborate and expensive equipment, complex processes and limited fabrication scale. Therefore, it is urgent to exploit a facile and feasible method to easily fabricate scaled-up, high-quality QD films for industrialization.
Herein, a facile dip coating process was adopted to prepare QD films for optoelectronic devices. Ternary CdSexTe1−x QDs were chosen as a promising active material because of their high chemical stability and near-infrared absorption range compared to their binary constituent QDs.24 A QD-photodetector based on the structure of FTO/TiO2/QDs/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag possessed a fast response speed (τr/τf < 20 ms), high detectivity (4.6 × 1012 Jones) and broad wavelength response (300 to 850 nm). Furthermore, the device exhibited excellent long-term stability (>2000 h). These devices can take full advantage of the tenability and the ease of fabrication and processing of the dip coating method to provide simple, tunable, and coherent energy sources.
2. Experimental
Materials
CdSexTe1−x QDs were synthesized according to the previous report by Zhong et al.28 with some modification. Firstly, the three different precursors (Cd, Se, Te) were prepared as follows: 0.411 g of cadmium oxide (CdO, Aladdin, 99.99%) was loaded into a 50 ml 3-neck flask with 24 ml of liquid paraffin (Aladdin, 99.0%) and 8 ml of oleic acid (OA, Guoyao China), dried for 40 min at 90 °C, and then heated under N2 to 260 °C until all the CdO dissolved and the solution became clear. The Cd precursor solution was stored in N2 at 50 °C until it was needed for the QD synthesis. 0.0316 g of selenium powder (Se, Alfa Aesar, 99.0%), 1 ml trioctylphosphine (TOP, Aladdin, 90.0%) and 3 ml liquid paraffin (0.038 g tellurium powder (Te, Aladdin, 99.99%), 0.75 ml TOP and 2.25 ml liquid paraffin) were added to a 50 ml-3-necked round bottom flask; the process of vacuuming and degassing at 90 °C was the same as that for the Cd precursor. The reaction was considered complete when the solution was clear at 150 °C (the reaction temperature of the Te precursor was 300 °C); the solution was then stored in N2 at 50 °C until it was needed for the QD synthesis.
Typically, the mixture precursors (molar ratio, Cd:Se:Te = 10:1:1) were stirred in a round bottom flask, and the process of vacuuming and degassing at 90 °C was the same as that for the Cd precursor. The flask was then heated to 310 °C at a rate of 30 °C min−1 under N2 atmosphere with vigorous stirring for 10 min (or 0 min, 5 min, or 15 min) and then cooled to 260 °C. Next, 2 ml of oleylamine (OAm, Aladdin, 80% to 90%) was swiftly injected continually into the solution to limit the growth of the nanocrystals. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature by removing the heater.
Device fabrication
A ∼ 20 nm compact TiO2 layer was deposited via spray pyrolysis at 450 °C onto a pre-cleaned fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 8 Ω square−1) glass substrate. The TiO2 precursor solution was made by sonicating titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol (Beijing China, ≥99.5%). After being maintained at 450 °C for 40 min, the temperature was lowered to room temperature. Then, mesoporous TiO2 layers were deposited by spin-coating for 30 s at 4000 rpm using 25 to 35 nm particle paste (Degussa P25) composed of ethyl cellulose, ethanol and α-terpilenol to obtain a layer thickness of 600 to 800 nm. Finally, the double-layer-structured TiO2 films were then sintered again at 500 °C for 30 min under dry air flow.
The annealed TiO2 films were obtained by soaking in a 0.04 M solution of CdSexTe1−x QDs in octane (Guangfu China, ≥95.0%) at a rate of 1 mm s−1. During the dip coating process, the films were dipped in a solution of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI, Aldrich, ≥99.0%) in anhydrous methanol (CH3OH, Beijing China, ≥99.5%) to replace the long organic chain ligands with iodide ligands to load more CdSexTe1−x QDs on the surface of the TiO2 photoanode. 6 cycles (or 3 cycles, 9 cycles or 12 cycles) of the processes were repeated to deposit sufficient QDs on the TiO2 films. After the QDs were deposited, a 2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,90-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) solution was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 200 nm of silver electrode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum.
Photovoltaic characterization
A Puxi UV-T10 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer was used to measure the QD absorption spectra in the range from 300 to 900 nm. The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation with an operation voltage and current of 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The XRD sample was prepared by centrifugal precipitation of the QDs. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a Gangdong FL-380 luminescence spectrometer. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained in the range of 300 to 900 nm using a Keithley 2400 multimeter with illumination from a 300 W tungsten lamp with a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves were obtained under illumination from a solar simulator (71S0503A) at one sun (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) by a Keithley 2400 source meter equipped with a calibrated Si-reference cell (certified by NREL). The dark current was obtained under dark conditions using a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments Inc.). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SU8020, Hitachi Co.) at 10 keV. Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai G2 F20 instrument at 200 kV. The current response of the photodetector was measured on an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). EL spectra and luminance–voltage characteristics were recorded using a PR670 SpectraScan spectroradiometer. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions.
The value of the LHE is calculated by the following eqn (1): (1)where A(QD) and A(TiO2 + QD) are the absorbance of the TiO2 film prior to and following absorption of the QDs, respectively. d is the thickness of the film.
The specific detectivity can be calculated according to eqn (2): (2)where R is the responsivity, S is the area of the device (the active area is 0.1007 cm2), q is the elementary charge and Idark is the dark current of the device.
3. Results and discussion
The schematic in Fig. 1a illustrates the preparation process of the CdSexTe1−x QDs and films. The ideal CdSexTe1−x QDs were obtained by a one-pot solvent-thermal method at 310 °C held for 10 min to enable the process of nucleation and growth, as in a previous report.28 The ligand modification process was carried out to limit the growth of the QDs and obtain uniform and stable QDs with oleic acid (OA) ligands. For the optimization of the QD synthesis, see Fig. S1 of the ESI.† Considering their high PL intensity, narrow FWHM and redshifted peak position, the QDs obtained by holding for 10 min were optimal. The mesoporous TiO2 substrates were dipped in the colloidal QD solution for 5 s and then pulled out at a constant speed (1 mm s−1). Afterwards, the QD films were dipped in iodide solution to replace the long organic chain ligands with short ligands (iodide). To reveal the surface chemistry of the CdSexTe1−x QDs during ligand exchange with TBAI, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were acquired, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The FTIR spectra show that the oleate ligands (C–H vibrations at 2920 cm−1 and 2855 cm−1 and COO− vibrations at 1535 cm−1 and 1410 cm−1) were almost completely removed by the ligand exchange process. Then, spiro-OMeTAD and Ag electrode were coated onto the QD layer by spin coating and thermal evaporation, respectively. The corresponding absorption spectra and steady state photoluminescence (PL) emissions for the CdSexTe1−x QDs solutions are given in Fig. 1b. The absorption onset of the CdSexTe1−x QDs extends to about 800 nm, while its PL emission peak is located at 810 nm; this indicates the near-infrared-region (NIR) absorption of the QDs. The inset in Fig. 1b shows the corresponding photographs of the CdSexTe1−x colloidal solution under ambient and ultraviolet light, respectively. The solutions display brownish black and red colors, respectively, which are in accord with the absorption spectrum and PL emission in Fig. 1b. It must be noted that no distinctive exciton peak in the absorption spectrum of CdSexTe1−x QDs has been reported.29 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Fig. 1c confirms the presence of the CdSexTe1−x QDs. The sample exhibited typical well-resolved diffraction peaks of CdSexTe1−x, including several strong peaks and two notable characteristic peaks at 24.7° and 41.4° which are located between standard zinc blende CdSe (JCPDS card no. 19-0191) and CdTe (JCPDS card no. 65-1081). The broad diffraction peaks are attributed to the small sizes of the QDs. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in Fig. 1d exhibits a nearly identical average particle size of 5.1 ± 0.2 nm and a nearly spherical shape with a narrow size distribution without any post-preparation fractionation or size sorting. The inset in Fig. 1d displays the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image. The lattice spacing is 0.358 nm, which is in accord with the (111) planes of CdSe and CdTe (lattice spacings: 0.351 nm and 0.374 nm, respectively). The lattice fringes of CdSexTe1−x can be clearly distinguished, suggesting good crystallinity.

A schematic and a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the QD photodetector are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The device is stacked in the structural sequence of Ag electrode (∼100 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (200 to 300 nm)/mesoporous TiO2/CdSexTe1−x QDs layer (∼700 nm)/compact TiO2 (20 to 30 nm)/FTO glass from top to bottom. In this work, 3-cycle QDs, 6-cycle QDs, 9-cycle QDs and 12-cycle QDs represent QD films that were obtained using 3, 6, 9 and 12 dip coating process cycles, respectively. The absorption spectra of the CdSexTe1−x QDs/TiO2 films with different dip coating cycles are shown in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the absorption onsets of the QDs/TiO2 films are around 800 nm, as are those for the corresponding colloidal QD solutions. Compared with bare TiO2, the absorbance range increases from 500 nm to 800 nm. The absorbance of the QD films significantly increases as the dip coating cycle number increases, particularly in the short-wavelength region (inset in Fig. 2c). The photographs in Fig. S3 (ESI†) display the colors of the devices, which deepened as the number of cycles increased; this indicates that larger amounts of QDs were absorbed onto the TiO2 layer. After more than 9 cycles, the increasing trend of the absorbance slowed. According to the results of the light absorbance, the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) characteristics of the films were calculated, as shown in Fig. 2d. The value of the LHE increased as the cycles increased, which shows the same trend as the absorption results. The top-view SEM images of the bare TiO2 and QDs/TiO2 films prepared with different dip coating cycles were measured, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†); this also verified the successful overcoating of CdSexTe1−x QDs on the TiO2 films. With increasing number of cycles, the morphology of TiO2 disappeared gradually, indicating that increasing amounts of QDs were accommodated on the surface of the TiO2 films. This also coincides with the absorption results (Fig. 2c). A continuous QD film on the surface of the TiO2 substrate was obtained after 9 dip coating cycles. This result also proves that the loading amount of QDs on the TiO2 substrate increases as the number of dip coating cycles increases.

(c) UV-visible spectral curves, where the insets show the absorption values of the four devices at 400 nm and 700 nm, and (d) light harvesting efficiency (LHE) curves of the TiO2 films loaded with different-cycle QDs, respectively. 
In order to demonstrate the repeatability and stability of the QD films prepared by the dip coating method, several identical samples were fabricated with different numbers of cycles and characterized, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The absorption curves almost coincide with each other, which indicates that the dip coating technique is feasible for large-area production. Thus, we assembled a large QD film with an area of 20 cm2, as shown in Fig. 3. Different sites were selected for absorption measurements. The coincident curves indicate that a homogeneous large-area QDs film can be obtained by this method. Thus, the dip coating method also provides opportunities to realize high-quality and low-cost fabrication of large-area optoelectronic devices.

Fig. 4a shows the I–V characteristics of the devices based on different cycle QD films. The heterojunctions in the devices show good diode behavior, with a clear rectifying current flow. When the dip coating cycle number was increased to 6 cycles, the device photocurrent density significantly improved to the maximum value of 3.1 mA cm−2. The increased photocurrent density is mainly derived from the increased amount of QDs loaded onto the surface of the TiO2 films. Unfortunately, when the QD cycle number was further increased beyond 6 cycles, although Voc still increased, Isc decreased gradually, leading to a decrease of the response performance of the photodetector. The photodetector assembled with 6-cycle QDs showed a dark current density of 3.73 × 10−7 mA cm−2, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), which was the lowest value among the four devices (3-cycle, 6-cycle, 9-cycle and 12-cycle QDs-based devices). The low dark current demonstrates that the device can prevent the leakage of current, which always leads to superior detection performance.30 When the cycle number was less than 6, the QD films were too thin; thus, charge leakage could be readily accrued. An overly thick QD film (>6 dip coating cycles) significantly increased the series resistance of the device, as shown in Fig. 4b. Fig. 4b displays the series resistances for the devices as a function of the number of cycles. The device assembled with the 6-cycle QDs film shows the lowest series resistance, while the values of the series resistance showed a sharp increase with more than 6 cycles. The high series resistance of the films would be detrimental to charge transmission and charge collection.31 A possible reason is that the short electron diffusion distance of the CdSexTe1−x QDs would lead to transport of a few generated electrons to the surface of the electron transport material and increase the series resistance of the device. It is well known that the charge generation and collection of devices can be evaluated by internal photo-to-current efficiency spectra (IPCE) and absorbed photon to charge carrier efficiency (APCE).32 These measurements were carried out, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). All devices showed a broad optical response in the wavelength region of 300 to 850 nm. The device based on the 6-cycle QDs film shows the highest IPCE value, which reached 19% due to the low charge transport resistance and high loading amount of QDs. To further explore the charge generation and collection of the devices assembled with different dip coating cycle numbers, APCE was calculated by the following eqn (3):32 (3)

(c) Responsivity spectral curves of the devices with different dip coating cycles. (d) Normalized detectivities of the detectors with different dip coating cycles.

The APCE value of the device based on the 6-cycle QDs film is higher than those of the other samples. This demonstrates that the device with the 6-cycle QDs film has the highest conversion efficiency of absorbed photons. To verify the accuracy and repeatability of the results, we fabricated dozens of individual devices using the same procedure and obtained statistical distributions of the key parameters (photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage), as presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). It can be seen that the device assembled with 6-cycle QDs has the highest photocurrent density, which is beneficial for high light response of a detector.
Responsivity (R) indicates the response efficiency of the detector to the optical signal.33 The responsivity spectra are shown in Fig. 4c, which is proportional to the IPCE of the detector. The device is sensitive to a broad wavelength range covering the entire UV-NIR region (300 to 850 nm). It can be observed that the 6-cycle QDs-based device shows excellent photoresponsivity, with the highest value of 50 mA W−1, while the values of the other three devices (3-cycle QDs, 9-cycle QDs and 12-cycle QDs detectors) are 35 mA W−1, 43 mA W−1 and 46 mA W−1, respectively. Next, another characteristic parameter for detection capability, the specific detectivity (D*), was calculated. From Fig. 4d, we can see that D* of the 6-cycle QDs based detector is remarkably high, above 1012 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm Hz1/2 W−1) in the 320 to 750 nm region and 3 × 1011 Jones at 800 nm.
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be used to examine the signal-to-noise level at a given illumination intensity. The higher the SNR, the less disturbing the background noise.34 The linear dynamic range (LDR) is used to detect the range of incident optical power over which a detector can linearly detect the incident signal.35 The larger the LDR, the better the performance. The SNR and LDR of the device were measured by recording the steady-state photocurrent under white light illumination with different light intensities from 0.01 mW cm−2 up to 8 mW cm−2. Fig. 4e and f show that the SNR of the 6-cycle QDs-based device is the highest, suggesting its higher performance against noise than the other devices. The LDR of the 6-cycle QDs-based device is 56 dB, which is higher than that of the other devices. Both the higher SNR and LDR manifest the superior performance of the 6-cycle QDs-based detector compared to the other devices.
We also explored the light response parameter to determine the photovoltaic detector performance. The on–off switching properties are shown in Fig. 5a under 0 V bias and an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. It can be seen that the 6-cycle QDs-based device presents excellent on–off switching reproducibility and stability in a six-cycle test. The photocurrent rapidly reaches the saturation value under illumination. When the light is turned off, the photocurrent decreases rapidly. This indicates that the increased charge intensity will decrease the effective barrier height upon illumination, which allows easier charge tunnelling and transportation than a device in darkness.36 Thus, to clearly characterize the fast response speed, a single normalized response modulation is given in Fig. 5b. The rise time (τr) is generally defined as the time to change from 10% to 90% of the peak output value, and the fall time (τf) is the time to change from 90% to 10% of the peak output value.37 The τr and τf values are much less than 20 ms, which are outstanding values in light of previously reported quantum dot photodetectors.38–40 We described the I–V characteristics under irradiance with various light-power levels of white light. From the curves, it can be conspicuously seen that the current increases (from 0.7 mA cm−2 to 2.9 mA cm−2) gradually with increasing light intensity (from 25 mW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2). The relationship between current and incident irradiance is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It is clear that the dependence relationship can be fitted as near-linear. This photodetector is expected to function under a broad range of environmental conditions. Device stability is often overlooked but is critical to practical applications.41–43 We tested the operational stability of the optimized device by exposing it to white light (100 mW cm−2). The results show the temporal evolution of the extracted photodetector parameter (responsivity included) of the normalized value from an ex situ long-term stability test for 2160 hours (90 days), where the devices were stored in air at room temperature without encapsulation. After 53 days of testing, the responsivity of the CdSexTe1−x device showed no obvious decrease; 85% of its initial responsivity was retained with a further extension of time to 90 days.

4. Conclusions
A facile and highly repeatable dip coating process was introduced to prepare high-quality CdSexTe1−x colloidal QD films. A homogeneous large-area (20 cm2) QD film can be obtained by the dip coating method, which reveals that this method will pave a path for further development of large-scale optoelectronic technology. A self-powered photodetector device architecture fabricated with these CdSexTe1−x QD films was first demonstrated. The photodetector presented a broad response range (300 to 850 nm), fast response (τr and τf < 20 ms) and high detectivity (4.6 × 1012 Jones). In addition, the responsivity of the photodetector device without encapsulation showed no obvious decrease, retaining 85% of its initial responsivity under light irradiation for 90 days; this indicates excellent long-term stability. The results and approach presented here can be extended to a broad range of nanostructure-based optoelectronic devices.
