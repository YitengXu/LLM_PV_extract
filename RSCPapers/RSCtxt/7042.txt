Defect engineering of Cu electrodes via plasma treatment is herein introduced to accomplish the efficient ECH of furfural (FAL) to furfuryl alcohol (FOL), thanks to the boosted kinetics on in situ reconfigured and defective Cu. Our experimental and theoretical analysis points out that the rate of ECH is positively correlated with the difference between the binding energies of chemisorbed H and FAL regarding their competitive adsorption, and thereby the higher discrepancy on defective Cu enables fast ECH in comparison with defect-free Cu. O2-plasma treatment on Cu foil (OP-Cu) produces CuOx that quickly undergoes in situ reduction to Cu with high roughness and rich defects during the initial ECH. Thereby, OP-Cu affords a high Faradaic efficiency (91%) of FOL at −0.56 V vs. RHE, superior to that of electropolished or Ar-plasma treated Cu. Its high efficacy identified in a wide substrate scope further enlightens catalyst design for electrochemical refinery via dynamic control.
Introduction
Increasing environmental contamination and superfluous CO2 emission from the over consumption of fossil fuels have motivated efforts to exploring alternative carbon sources whose utilization will not alter the carbon balance of our current ecosystem.1,2 In this regard, the conversion of biomass, the only viable candidate for sustainable non-fossil carbon sources, has attracted extensive interest, but unfortunately suffers from high-temperature and energy-intensive processes.3–5 Electrocatalytic conversion powered by sustainable wind- and solar-electricity would allow this carbon-neutral recycling process to be implemented efficiently under ambient conditions due to its precise control by means of an external potential or current.6,7 In particular, electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) utilizes H2O as the H2 source to hydrogenate biomass-derived oxygenates, such as aldehydes,8–13 carboxylic acids,14–16 and phenols,17–19 into value-added chemicals, avoiding the requirement of high temperature and H2 pressure. However, this promising route is still challenged in Faradaic efficiency (FE) and product selectivity, and highly desires the amelioration of substrate/intermediate chemisorption on the catalyst surface to enable an efficient turnover via target pathways.20–22
As a non-precious metal with high earth-abundance, copper (Cu) has attracted extensive interest for ECH.23,24 It uses two and four chemisorbed H species (Hads) to hydrogenate furfural (FAL), a biomass platform readily obtained from the dehydration of sugars, into furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and 2-methylfuran (2-MF),25 respectively. Beyond the severe competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that consumes reactive Hads and reduces the FE, ECH is still challenged by unsatisfactory selectivity due to the undefined pathways of hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation and radical dimerization.5,26 To improve the FEs and selectivity to the target products, one of the paramount issues is to engineer the surface of Cu electrocatalyts at the atomic level. In addition to structural design prior to catalytic processes, in situ surface reconfiguration under working conditions deserves more attention, because newly-formed sites are intrinsically responsible for electrocatalysis.27–30 As exemplified in electrochemical CO2 reduction, defective Cu nanograins derived from (hydr)oxide in situ reduction account for the formation of multi-carbon chemicals.31–33 The recent identification of the dynamic change in the ECH of FAL34 has encouraged more efforts to comprehensively understand the electrocatalytic pathways on reconfigured Cu surfaces, and to further improve product FEs and selectivity.
Herein, defect engineering of Cu electrodes via plasma treatment is introduced to accomplish the efficient and selective ECH of FAL to FOL, in which the in situ reconfiguration of CuOx is the determinant. Our experimental and theoretical kinetic analysis points out a positive correlation of the ECH rate with the difference between the binding energies of Hads and chemisorbed FAL (FALads) regarding their competitive adsorption in the Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) mechanism, and thereby a defective Cu surface with a higher discrepancy can enable faster ECH than defect-free Cu. As inspired, plasma treatment under an O2 atmosphere is introduced to fabricate CuOx on Cu foil (OP-Cu), along with references, electropolished Cu foil (EP-Cu) and that treated with plasma in an Ar atmosphere (AP-Cu). OP-Cu affords superiority to EP-Cu and AP-Cu in the ECH of FAL, featuring a high FE (91%) and selectivity (96%) to FOL at −0.56 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a yield of ∼70% after 4 hours electrolysis. The quick reduction of CuOx to ultrafine Cu in OP-Cu during the initial reaction (5 min) is evidenced by in situ Raman spectroscopy, which generates rich defects to boost the rate-determining step (RDS) involving Hads and FALads owing to strengthened chemisorption. Moreover, the consistent promotion in the ECH of a variety of aldehydes and nitroarenes highlights the significance of catalyst defect engineering via plasma treatment.
Experimental
Electrode preparation
Copper foil (99.9% metals basis, Macklin) was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone and 2 M hydrochloric acid for 10 minutes, sequentially. To prepare EP-Cu, a two-electrode system consisting of copper foil and a carbon rod was applied with a voltage of 3.0 V in 85 wt% phosphoric acid (Macklin) solution for 500 s, according to a previously reported method.35 The method was suitable to prepare a smooth surface that would be taken into comparison with rough OP-Cu, in order to elucidate the correlation between ECH activity and surface roughness. The newly polished copper sheet was immediately placed in deionized water saturated with nitrogen and sonicated for 10 minutes to wash away residual phosphoric acid and phosphate on the copper surface. For plasma pre-treatment, the polished copper foil was irradiated with RF plasma (100 W) under an O2 or Ar flow with various etching times.
Physical characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The nanostructures of samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a JEOL JEM 2100F and a ZEISS ULTRA55, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi with an Al Kα source, and the binding energy was calibrated to an indefinite C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman microspectrometer (Horiba HR-800), and the excitation laser wavelength was 532 nm.
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were carried out on a CHI650e electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua) with an H-type cell equipped with a proton exchange membrane as a separator (Fig. S1, ESI†). The prepared copper foil samples and graphite rod electrodes were the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. A saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode. All the potentials reported in this work were referenced to the RHE. The electrolyte for ECH was a 0.25 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 35 mM FAL. All electrochemical tests were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Roughness testing
To measure electrochemical capacitance, the potential was swept from 0.49 to 0.59 V and back to 0.49 V vs. RHE at different scan rates (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mV s−1). All roughness data are relative to the electric double layer capacitance of EP-Cu before electrolysis.35
FAL adsorption tests
After electrolyzing FAL (35 mM) in a phosphate buffer solution for 5 minutes, the cathode was taken out and rinsed with ultrapure water. Afterward, the cathode was scanned by cyclic voltammetry (0.15–0.25 V vs. RHE) for 30 cycles to desorb the adsorbed FAL from the electrode into a blank solution. The amount of FAL was then quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Product analysis
Product analysis is based on our previous method.8 Quantitative analysis of H2 and liquid products was performed by gas chromatography (GC) and HPLC, respectively. The H2 gas produced in the cathode chamber is directly vented into the gas sampling loop of a GC (FULI 9790) at every 30 minutes. The FE of H2 was calculated using the following equations (eqn (1) and (2)): (1) (2)where α is the volume fraction of H2 determined by GC, nH2 is the amount of H2, F is Faraday's constant (F = 96485 C mol−1), and z is the number of transferred electrons. For H2, z = 2.
Liquid products were collected from the cathode chamber and analysed by HPLC (SHIMADZU LC-20AT) equipped with a UV detector at 216 and 240 nm. The column (INERTSUSTAIN C18) was operated at 40 °C with a binary gradient method including H2O and CH3OH at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1. The CH3OH fraction is 20%. The yield (%) of FOL, the FE (%) and selectivity (%) to hydrogenation products were calculated based on the following equations (eqn (3)–(5)): (3) (4) (5)
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
CASTEP software implemented in Materials Studio 8.0 was used for the DFT calculations. Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was used for the exchange correlation energy, and the plane wave basis set was assigned to a 430 eV kinetic energy cut-off. The self-consistent field (SCF) tolerance and Brillouin zone were set to 1 × 10−6 eV and 3 × 3 × 1 k-points, respectively. The core electrons were replaced with ultrasoft pseudo-potentials. For the adsorption energy calculations, the (111) facet of Cu with a three-layer 5 × 5 surface slab was used. We removed a copper atom from the Cu (111) surface to represent a defective Cu(111) surface.
The furfural adsorption energy (BEFAL) was obtained according to eqn (6): BEFAL = Esurf+FAL − EFAL − Esurf(6)where Esurf+FAL is the total energy of a slab with the corresponding adsorbates, and Esurf and EFAL are the energies of a pure slab and a FAL molecule, respectively.
The H adsorption energy (BEH) was obtained according to eqn (7): BEH = 1/2(Esurf+H2 − EH2 − Esurf)(7)
Results and discussion
Kinetic analysis
To investigate the ECH kinetics of FAL, OP-Cu was at first examined at −0.56 V vs. RHE with a high stirring rate of 1000 rpm to eliminate the influences of mass diffusion. The profile of FOL production over time (Fig. 1a) shows the features of a quasi-first-order reaction, which is further confirmed by the logarithmic correlation between the initial FAL concentration ([FAL]initial) and the rate for producing FOL (rFOL). In view of the L–H mechanism that is commonly accepted for thermo/electro-catalytic hydrogenation,36,37 the RDS is the surface step involving Hads and FALads (Fig. 1b). According to the previous identification of the ECH kinetics of oxygenated organic compounds (e.g., benzaldehyde, furfural, heptanal, cyclohexane carboxaldehyde, etc.) by Holladay and co-workers,21,38 the reaction rate (rLH) can be described as eqn (8) or (9), when the RDS is the first or second H addition to the carbonyl, respectively. (8) (9)where rLH is the reaction rate to produce FOL via the L–H mechanism, kLH is the kinetic constant of the hydrogenation step, KFAL is the absorption equilibrium constant of FAL, [FAL] is the concentration of FAL, KVolmer is the absorption equilibrium constant of H3O+, and αH3O+ is the activity of H3O+. Because a potential as negative as −0.56 V ensures the fast equilibrium of H2O discharging to generate enough Hads (KVolmerαH3O+ ≫ 1 + KFAL[FAL]), the description can be simplified as eqn (10), and rLH shows a linear dependence on [FAL], consistent with our experimental observation (Fig. 1a). (10)Given a constant kLH at fixed temperature and the same initial composition of reactants, we can easily infer that the rLH is positively correlated with KFAL/KVolmer (eqn (11)), and thereby RTlnrLH is proportional to the difference between the binding energies of Hads and FALads (BEH − BEFAL, eqn (12)). (11) RTlnrLH ∝ BEH − BEFAL(12)where BEFAL and BEH are the binding energies of FAL and H on the catalyst surface, respectively. This deduction allows for the correlation of ECH kinetics with binding energies, consistent with the recent identification of lignin electrochemical reduction.39

(b) Schematic illustration for a surface elementary step following the L–H mechanism. (c) BEH and BEFAL on p-Cu(111) and d-Cu(111), the difference between which is correlated with rLH (eqn (12)). 
Defect engineering is one of the most effective strategies to improve electrocatalysis via enhancing intermediate chemisorption on a vast amount of coordinatively unsaturated sites.40–42 In this regard, BEH and BEFAL are examined on pristine and defective Cu (p-Cu and d-Cu) surfaces via DFT calculations. Cu(111), the most thermodynamically stable and highly exposed facet, was adopted as the model (Fig. 1c). On d-Cu(111), a Cu atom adjacent to the Cu vacancy is considered as the adsorption site. Obviously, it shows enhanced chemisorption with the more negative values of both BEH and BEFAL, in comparison with p-Cu(111). The enhancement of BEFAL is more extensive than that of BEH, leading to a higher value of BEH − BEFAL as compared to that on p-Cu(111) (Fig. 1c). According to the positive correlation of rLH with BEH − BEFAL (eqn (12)), fast ECH of FAL is anticipated on the d-Cu surface.
Catalyst characterization
Enlightened by the above preliminary analysis, we employed plasma techonology, a powerful tool for surface engineering, to create defects on Cu foil.43 The varied atmosphere of O2 or Ar is responsible for the distinct surface states of OP-Cu and AP-Cu. The former features a rough surface composed of an oxide layer that possibly undergoes in situ reduction to metallic nanoparticles with abundant defects during cathodic electrocatalysis, while the latter exhibits defects from plasma bombardment.44 XRD analysis (Fig. 2a) identifies the presence of Cu2O in OP-Cu, but its absence in AP-Cu and EP-Cu. In XPS (Fig. 2b), OP-Cu shows broader peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 and two new satellites associated with Cu2+, as compared with EP-Cu and AP-Cu. Further deconvolution confirms the relatively higher content of Cu2+ in OP-Cu, despite the difficult discrimination of Cu0/Cu+. The combination of XRD and XPS identifies multiple oxides CuO and Cu2O on the OP-Cu surface. The existence of a few Cu2+ species on EP-Cu and AP-Cu is due to the inevitable surface oxidation as the fresh Cu surface is exposed to air. Accordingly, OP-Cu presents the characteristic bands of Cu2O at 144 (F1u) and 212 (2Γ12) cm−1 and those of CuO at 295 (Ag), 327 (Bg) and 637 (Bg) cm−1 in the Raman spectrum (Fig. 2c),45 which are negligible in EP-Cu and AP-Cu. In addition, SEM images show the rougher surface of OP-Cu than those of EP-Cu and AP-Cu (Fig. 2d, f and h), owing to the extensive surface oxidation under O2-plasma. The relatively higher content of oxygen in OP-Cu is clearly presented in their corresponding elemental maps (Fig. 2e, g and i).

ECH performance
The ECH of FAL was carried out in an H-type electrochemical cell equipped with a proton exchange membrane as a separator, and 0.25 M phosphate solution (pH 6.8) as the electrolyte (Fig. S1, ESI†). EP-Cu, AP-Cu and OP-Cu were directly used as the working cathodes. Their polarization curves with and without FAL were compared (Fig. 3a), and show the obvious enhancement of current densities after introducing FAL (35 mM), due to the occurrence of ECH.46 In comparison with EP-Cu and AP-Cu, OP-Cu affords a lower onset potential and higher current density in the presence of FAL, indicating its better activity for the ECH. This is consistent with the small charge-transfer resistance of OP-Cu in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†).

(b) FE and yield of FOL on the three electrodes at −0.56 V vs. RHE in the time courses of the reaction, and (c) product FEs after 4 hours at different working potentials. (d) Chronoamperometry curves of OP-Cu at −0.56 V vs. RHE in continuous cycles, and (e) the summary of FE and yield of FOL. 
The ECH was then performed at a constant potential of −0.56 V vs. RHE, and the liquid and gaseous products were analysed at intervals by using HPLC and GC, respectively. The main products are FOL and H2 with very limited hydrofuroin, indicating the dominant competition between ECH and the HER. 2-MF, a hydrodeoxygenation product generated under low pH conditions,34,47 is not detectable in this work probably due to the use of a neutral electrolyte (pH 6.8). As summarized in Fig. 3b, OP-Cu maintains a high FE of FOL (>90%) in the 4 hours electrolysis, superior to those of EP-Cu (∼30%) and AP-Cu (∼47%), which confirms the favourable ECH that fully uses Hads to hydrogenate FAL. Accordingly, the yield of FOL increases with reaction time, and reaches a high level of ∼70% after 4 hours, illustrating a facile route for updating biomass molecules free from high temperature and high-pressure H2. In sharp comparison, EP-Cu and AP-Cu only deliver low FOL yield in the reaction course, associated with their low current output (Fig. 3a) and FEs. We further varied the time (5–20 min) for O2-plasma treatment which enables a high FE (>80%) and selectivity (>85%) to FOL with a considerable yield of 57.0–78.0% after 4 hours electrolysis (Fig. S4, ESI†), confirming the promotion by O2-plasma. However, excessive O2-plasma irradiation will lead to the bulk oxidation of Cu and poor conductivity, which is probably responsible for the slight decrease of ECH performance when a long etching time of 20 min is adopted. Furthermore, the performance at different potentials (−0.46–−0.76 V vs. RHE) was evaluated in terms of product FEs (Fig. 3c). OP-Cu delivers the best FE of FOL among the three samples, reaching a high level of 87.0% and 91.1% at −0.46, and −0.56 V, respectively. Although EP-Cu and AP-Cu suffer from a drastically increased FE of hydrofuroin (42.2% and 50.6%) at −0.66 V, the by-product via ketyl radical dimerization, OP-Cu still gives a very limited FE (9.2%) of hydrofuroin, and a well-maintained efficiency (75.2%) of FOL, which strongly confirms the favourable ECH at the expense of radical dimerization and the HER. When the potential is as negative as −0.76 V, the visible increase of hydrofuroin on OP-Cu leads to a drastic decrease of FOL FE to 39.1%. This trend should be ascribed to the extremely high coverage of Hads that impedes the chemisorption of FAL to proceed to ECH, and favours radical dimerization via an outer-sphere reaction.47 Moreover, a recycling test (Fig. 3d and e) revealed the robust service-life of OP-Cu, with a high FE and yield of FOL in 4 successive cycles. In each test for 4 hours, the current drops visibly with reaction time, consistent with the first-order reaction feature with respect to [FAL]. It recovers to the same level again when the electrolyte is refreshed with 35 mM FAL (Fig. 3d). Fig. 3e summarizes the FE and yield of FOL in these cycles, which are kept at a high level of ∼90% and ∼65%, respectively.
The greatest difference among these three electrodes is the presence of copper oxides (Cu2O and CuO) on OP-Cu, which will undergo thermodynamically-favoured reduction during ECH as indicated by comparing the XRD patterns before and after electrolysis (Fig. S5, ESI†). Breaking Cu–O bonds and releasing O atoms during the reduction would result in new active sites with rich defects, similar to the case of CO2RR.48 Herein, the structural evolution of OP-Cu was monitored by means of Raman spectroscopy combined with an electrocatalytic test at −0.56 V (Fig. 4a). The bands of Cu2O and CuO gradually decrease with electrolysis, and completely disappear after 5 min, indicating that the surface quickly reaches metallic steady state via in situ CuOx reduction. Such reduction is also proved using XPS and Auger spectra together (Fig. S6, ESI†). Accordingly, SEM shows the increasing roughness of the Cu surface, accompanied by the obviously reduced signal of oxygen in elemental maps (Fig. S7, ESI†). TEM (Fig. 4b and c) further presents newly-formed Cu nanoparticles with ultra-small sizes (∼3.3 nm) after electrolysis (5 min). These small nanoparticles, in comparison with the bulky ones observed in EP-Cu and AP-Cu (Fig. S8, ESI†), enable rich defects favourable for the ECH kinetics.

(d) Roughness of EP-Cu, AP-Cu and OP-Cu evolving with electrolysis time, (e) the amount of residual FAL on these electrodes after 5 min electrolysis, and (f) FOL production rate normalized by the roughness (rFOL,roughness) in 1 hour electrolysis. 
Moreover, the roughness of the three catalysts was tracked during the ECH (Fig. 4d and S9–S11, ESI†). Apparently, OP-Cu experiences a quick increase of roughness in the initial 5 min, coincident with the reduction of CuOx observed in in situ Raman spectra, which is maintained at a higher level afterward, in comparison with both AP-Cu and EP-Cu. It's reasonable to assume that the quick CuOx reduction increases the roughness of OP-Cu, owing to the generation of small and defective nanoparticles.49 The relatively small increase on AP-Cu and EP-Cu at 5 min should be ascribed to the similar reduction of trace surface oxides. Accordingly, the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) collected in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH after 5 min electrolysis (Fig. S12, ESI†) not only identify the large electrochemically active surface of OP-Cu, but also confirm the presence of Cu(100), (110) and (111).50 The next question is whether the roughness is correlated with the amount of FAL adsorbed on these electrodes. We used 30 CV scans to desorb FAL from the spent electrodes into a blank solution, which is then quantified by HPLC. As summarized (Fig. 4e), the high value for OP-Cu strongly indicates the favourable adsorption of FAL on the rough and defective Cu surface.
To ascertain the contribution of the in situ formed rough and defective Cu surface to the enhanced ECH performance, we further evaluated the FOL production rate normalized by the electrode roughness values going stable in 1 hour electrolysis (rFOL,roughness). As shown in Fig. 4f, OP-Cu exhibits an obviously higher value, as compared with EP-Cu and AP-Cu, which strongly indicates the higher intrinsic activity on the defective Cu surface. In other words, the efficient ECH of FAL to FOL is not simply attributed to the increased surface area through roughening, but also more dominantly to the enriched defect sites that are more favourable for the ECH kinetics. It's also suggested by the quite similar rFOL,roughness values of EP-Cu and AP-Cu that simple plasma engineering, free from extensive surface reconfiguration of CuOx, only increases the surface area, but cannot construct new sites with excellent intrinsic activity. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the strong binding with FAL on the d-Cu surface can favourably boost the surface elementary step of the L–H mechanism. The evidenced reduction of CuOx layers on OP-Cu during initial electrolysis enables the large electrochemically active surface, and more importantly enhances BEFAL to facilitate FOL production because of the positive correlation of ECH rate with BEH − BEFAL. Meanwhile, the strengthened BEH on d-Cu (−0.156 eV vs. −0.141 eV for p-Cu) favours the hydrogenation with FALads, rather than evolution to gaseous H2, contributing to the high FE of FOL as well. Heating Cu foil at 200–500 °C for 2 hours under an O2 flow can also produce CuOx layers to in situ derive d-Cu for the enhanced ECH (Fig, S13, ESI†), but the performance is still inferior to that of OP-Cu. Obviously, this O2-plasma treatment features the merits of prominent electrocatalytic performance, easy and fast manipulation, and the use of commercially-available electrodes.
In a further set of experiments, we examined the efficacy of OP-Cu in a wider substrate scope (Fig. 5). Obviously, OP-Cu can catalyse the carbonyl compounds benzaldehyde (BD), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and FAL towards the corresponding alcohols with tripled or quadrupled FEs and yield, in comparison with EP-Cu. The improvement by OP-Cu is further acquired for nitroarenes, including p-nitrostyrene (p-NE), p-chloronitrobenzene (p-CB), p-nitrophenol (p-NP), and nitrobenzene (NB). The extremely high FEs of aromatic amines (>90%) from substituted nitrobenzenes (e.g., p-NE, p-CB and p-NP) confirm the highly selective hydrogenation pathway with well-retained substituents, which is still challenging in thermocatalysis.51

Conclusions
In summary, defect engineering of Cu via O2-plasma is introduced to accomplish efficient ECH with extremely high product FE and yield, in which the in situ reduction of CuOx to defective Cu is beneficial for the hydrogenation kinetics. Thanks to the promoted surface elementary step involving Hads and FALads, the optimal OP-Cu affords high FE and satisfactory durability towards FOL, outperforming EP-Cu and AP-Cu. Its efficacy for ECH is verified in a wide substrate scope (e.g., aldehydes and nitroarenens), which enables promising cathodic reactions for pairing with anodic oxidation to efficiently produce value-added chemicals at low operating voltages.52,53 Regarding the easy, fast and effective surface engineering with plasma on commercially-available electrodes, this work will provide new opportunities for exploiting catalysts in electrochemical refineries.
