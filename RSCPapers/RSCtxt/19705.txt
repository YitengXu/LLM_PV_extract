A 22% yield of methanol was obtained from CO2. This technique is simple and environmentally friendly, and also provides an example of a multitude of possible chemical reactions for CO2 conversion.
The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing at an accelerating rate from 312 ppm in 1955 to 400 ppm in 2014, and the high CO2 level is the primary source of the greenhouse effect.1 Thus, developing a sustainable approach to CO2 utilization as a cheap and abundant carbon source to produce organic chemicals would be an especially fascinating technology, which can lead to a carbon-neutral fuel cycle in theory.2 Many promising methods for CO2 reduction have been proposed. Among these methods, water splitting for CO2 reduction can be considered as a promising approach because water can be used as an in situ liquid hydrogen source and then hydrogen storage, transportation and purity are not required.
Methanol is one of chemical fuels from CO2 reduction, which has been used as a transportation fuel in either modified internal combustion engines or direct methanol fuel cells, and also as a raw material for the synthesis of important platform chemicals for methyl tert-butyl ether and chloromethane, etc.3
In recent decades, various processes have exemplified the concept that methanol can be produced from CO2 and hydrogen base on Cu-based catalysts.4 However, the hydrogen sources for CO2 hydrogenation are generally from fossil fuel, and also the hydrogen storage, transportation and purity requirement are the other technical obstacles. In addition, a complex or precious catalyst is generally needed.5 Hydrothermal chemistry has received much attention in organic chemical synthesis and biomass conversion due to the unique inherent properties of high temperature water, including a high ion product, a low dielectric constant, fast reaction rate and environmental benign property. We have conducted many researches involving biomass conversion under hydrothermal reactions.6 On the other hand, hydrothermal reactions have played an important role in the formation of fossil fuel in the earth's crust and deep-sea hydrothermal vent such as the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons from the dissolved CO2.7 Thus, CO2 reduction in the simulated hydrothermal vent system should be a very desirable research. With this in mind, recently, we turned our attention from biomass conversion into the much more challenging CO2 reduction under hydrothermal conditions with metal Fe as a reductant. Fe was selected because hydrothermal fluid enriches reduced ferrous-bearing mineral, which is considered to generate reduction conditions by the reaction with hot water.8 Our previous results with Fe as a reductant have demonstrated the formation of formic acid from CO2.9 These findings inspired us to further investigated CO2 reduction with other metals such as Zn, Mn and Al, and it was found that the relative efficiency of CO2 reduction into formic acid was Al > Zn > Mn > Fe.10 In these reactions, methanol formation was also confirmed when Zn was used with Cu as a catalyst, however, the yield of methanol was very low,11 and therefore the reactions require further investigation for CO2 utilization. Since Al has a better performance than Zn for CO2 reduction into formic acid, an enhancement of methanol production from CO2 can be expected by using Al instead of Zn. Moreover, a redox process of ZnO/Zn, FeO/Fe3O4 and Mn(IV)/Mn(II) with solar energy have been reported, even for MgO/Mg, its redox can be achieved by solar power concentration using laser technology.12 The redox of MgO/Mg suggests that the reduction of AlxOy would be much easier than MgO when using solar energy because Mg is more active than Al. Thus, a circulation of Al would be achieved by combining solar energy.
To the best of our knowledge, the hydrothermal reduction of CO2 into methanol with Al as a reductant was not yet reported previously. In the present article, we report the discovery of hydrothermal conversion of CO2 to methanol with two commercially available and non-precious metal powders of Al and Cu directly working as a reductant and a catalyst, respectively. In this process, water not only acts as an excellent greener solvent, but also as a greener hydrogen sources. Further, neither elaborately prepared catalysts nor expensive reagents were used.
First, various transition-metals such as Fe, Zn, Mn and Al were tested as a reductant for the reduction of NaHCO3, as a source of CO2, with Cu-based catalysts. The results are summarized in Table 1. Among all metals investigated, the reaction did not give the desired methanol in the absence of Fe or Mn as a reductant (entry 1–7). Interestingly, methanol was formed when using Zn or Al as a reductant (entry 8 and 10) with Cu as a catalyst. Evidently, the methanol yield with Al (1.5%) was higher than that with Zn (0.6%), which was in accordance with their activities. Moreover, no formation of methanol was observed when using Al with CuO or using only Cu without Al (entry 11 and 12). Thus, only for the case of using both Al (as a reductant) and Cu (as a catalyst), CO2 can be reduced into methanol. Additionally, in order to test whether Cu2+ can act as a catalyst in the conversion of CO2 into methanol, a reaction with CuSO4 instead of Cu powder was conducted. The results showed that no methanol was produced (entry 13), indicating that metallic Cu rather than Cu2+ acted as a catalyst in the reduction of CO2 into methanol. Analysis for solid residues after reactions by XRD showed that Al was oxidized to AlO(OH) and most of Cu still existed in Cu(0) (see Fig. SI-1†), confirming the reductant role of Al and catalytic role of Cu in the reduction of CO2 into methanol. Thus, the overall reaction of the reduction of CO2 with Al in water can be explained as eqn (1):

Subsequently, the liquid samples and gaseous samples after the reactions were analyzed by GC/FID, GC/MS, HPLC and GC/TCD, respectively. Results showed that the major product was methanol with a few amount of formic acid as well as trace quantity of acetic acid and methane (see Fig. S3–S5†).
Although methanol could be produced from CO2 with Al on the Cu catalyst under hydrothermal conditions, formic acid was formed mainly as a competitive product of methanol. To enhance the selectivity of methanol, the effect of H+ concentration on the yield of methanol and formic acid was investigated by adding hydrochloric acid from 0 to 2.0 mol L−1, because some research has reported that a weak acidic system was adverse to formic acid formation in CO2 hydrogenation.9b,10b As shown in Fig. 1, the yield of formic acid decreased sharply with an increase in the initial concentration of hydrochloric acid, while the yield of methanol increased greatly from 1.5% to 5.4%, suggesting that an acidic system was favorable for the production of methanol. However, when the concentration of hydrochloric acid exceeded 1.2 mol L−1, the yield of methanol decreased. In order to further confirm the effect of H+ concentration on the production of methanol, reactions with sulfuric acid instead of hydrochloric acid with the concentration of 0.6 mol L−1 (H+ concentration of 1.2 mol L−1) was conducted. As a result, the yield of methanol was 4.8% (see the red point in Fig. 1), which was close to the one obtained with hydrochloric acid in the same H+ concentration of 1.2 mol L−1. The fact that a low pH is favorable for the production of methanol suggests that methanol comes from CO2 rather than HCO3− because a low pH is favorable for the formation CO2 in the equilibrium of CO2, HCO3− and CO32− in water solution.
 Fig. 1  Effect of hydrochloric acid concentration on the yield of methanol (temperature: 350 °C, time: 2 h, NaHCO3: 40 mmol, Al: 40 mmol, Cu: 50 mmol, water filling: 50%). 
Then, the reaction characteristics of the reduction of CO2 into methanol with Al and Cu, and also the parameters design for getting a high yield of methanol were investigated in the presence of hydrochloric acid concentration of 1.2 mol L−1. First, the effect of the initial amounts of Cu and Al was studied. As shown in Fig. 2, the methanol yield increased evidently with the increase in the initial amount of Cu, when the ratio of Cu/NaHCO3 increased to 0.5, the yield of methanol verged to a constant. For the effect of Al amount, the yield of methanol increased clearly with the increase in the amount of Al, which is probably because a stronger reduction condition or a large amount of hydrogen can improve the CO2 reduction. Considering the cost saving, although the yield of methanol still increased with the increase in the initial amount of Al, Al/NaHCO3 = 1:1 was chosen in further investigations.
 Fig. 2  Effect of the amount of Al and Cu on the methanol yield (350 °C, 2 h, 40 mmol NaHCO3, 1.2 mol L−1 HCl, 50% of water filling). 
In the following experiments, the effects of some important parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time, water filling and NaHCO3 amount on the formation of methanol were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3, the increase in the reaction temperature, time and water filling (pressure) were favorable for the conversion of CO2 into methanol, and also an increase in the initial amount of NaHCO3 led to an increase in the yield of methanol. The highest yield of methanol reached to 18.5%, which occurred at 350 °C for 7 h with water filling 50% and NaHCO3 40 mmol. Further, the result obtained with gaseous CO2 at 350 °C for 2 h showed that the yield of methanol was 22%, which was higher than that with NaHCO3. These results confirmed again the methanol formation was from CO2.

Additionally, a reaction with directly using gaseous CO2 and H2 with Cu catalyst was conducted. As a result, a methanol yield of 20.3% was obtained at 350 °C for 2 h, which demonstrates the suitability of using CO2, H2 with Cu catalyst to obtain methanol under hydrothermal conditions.
Generally, a complex catalyst is needed in the traditional hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. The observed highly catalytic activity of a general Cu powder under hydrothermal conditions suggests that some intermediates might act as a synergetic catalyst with Cu in the formation of methanol from CO2. To examine this assumption, the solid residues after reactions were further analyzed by XRD. Unexpectedly, a small amount of Cu2O was detected (Fig. SI-2(a)†). The formation of Cu2O was probably because of the oxidation of Cu in high temperature water, which was supported by the fact that a few of Cu2O was detected by XRD (see Fig. SI-2(b)†), and the grain diameter of Cu2O was less than 100 nm in a further experiment with Cu directly reacted with NaHCO3 and HCl at 350 °C. Although further evidence is needed, these results suggest that the high methanol yield with Cu might be attributed to a synergistically catalytic role of the interface between Cu and Cu2O because Cu is a conductive material and Cu2O is a good semiconductor material with narrow band, the interface between Cu and Cu2O would be the active site for the deeper six-electron-reduction product methanol from CO2. Work along these lines is now in progress.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient method for reducing CO2 into six-electron-reduction product methanol in water with commercially available and non-precious metals of Al and Cu, which directly worked as a reductant and a catalyst, respectively. A high methanol yield of 22% was obtained from CO2. The proposed method is simple, green, and environmentally friendly because an environmental benign solvent of water and the hydrogen from water are used in the proposed process. Furthermore, a carbon cycle could be achieved by coupling geochemistry, specifically the metal-based water splitting for CO2 reduction, with solar driven thermochemistry for reducing metal oxide into metal.
