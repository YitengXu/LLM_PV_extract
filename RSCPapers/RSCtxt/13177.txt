    , Accepted 7th October 2010First published on 11th November 2010AbstractWe report on the optimization of nanostructured copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin films for idealized organic photovoltaic (OPV) architectures using advanced substrate motion and periodic seeding. Oblique angle deposition (OAD), a subset of glancing angle deposition (GLAD), has recently been used to enhance small molecule OPV device photoconversion efficiency by increasing the surface area of metal phthalocyanine (MPc) thin films. Here we report a detailed study of how to direct MPc film growth towards the ideal donor morphology using the techniques available to GLAD. Porous films of columnar CuPc nanostructures were achieved with strong control over the diameter, spacing and height of the columns. Special emphasis was placed on limiting column broadening as the film thickness, and resulting light absorption, was increased. Columns were grown on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates to hundreds of nanometers in length while maintaining diameters of 40–50 nm and crystal grain sizes of 15–30 nm. Additionally, we provide the first demonstration of periodically seeded organic nanocolumn growth. These methods enable fabrication of uniform columnar MPc films engineered specifically for the short exciton diffusion lengths in these materials, making them suitable for ideal OPV device geometries.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are a topic of current interest due to their potential for low-cost solar energy conversion.1–4 Higher photoconversion efficiencies are required to achieve widespread market adoption, but remain a significant challenge. Fundamentally, OPV devices suffer from severely limited exciton diffusion lengths (e.g. 10 to 50 nm for copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a common light absorber2) which restrict film thicknesses and therefore light capture. The most common strategy employed to overcome this limitation, and thereby enhance OPV device performance, is the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device architecture which is characterized by an interpenetrating network of electron donor and electron acceptor materials. This arrangement enables greater light capture than planar junction devices while maintaining a sufficiently minimal average distance between the point of light absorption and the donor/acceptor interface.
Constructing the optimal BHJ at the nanoscale is challenging and various fabrication methods have been employed to pursue this architecture. Many attempts rely on the natural segregation of polymer blends3 while others use codeposition of materials,4 both of which permit the formation of isolated regions of material and charge trapping zones. Nevertheless the achievements made using these techniques are a significant improvement over the original bilayer cell.1
There are some examples of direct donor material structuring2,5–7 as well as alternating thin regions of donor and acceptor materials.8 These approaches each create distinct regions of donor and acceptor materials in the active layer while improving the interface area and demonstrate significant improvements in photoconversion efficiency. This progress motivates further development of the structured bulk heterojunction concept.
The ideal architecture would contain a 200 nm thick electron donor layer structured as an array of equally spaced nanocolumns, with column diameters equal to or less than the exciton diffusion length.9 An illustration of the idealized donor layer geometry and corresponding device are shown in Fig. 1. The realization of this device architecture has yet to be achieved.

Structures analogous to those in Fig. 1 can be realized with the Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) physical vapor deposition technique. GLAD employs oblique substrate angles and (sometimes complex) substrate motion about a collimated flux to produce porous structured thin films with a variety of controllable morphologies.10 The porosity and structuring are made possible by the limited surface diffusion of incident adatoms combined with the self-shadowing of film features. The two key parameters of GLAD that describe the film growth conditions are the angle between incident vapor flux and the substrate normal (α), and the substrate rotation (described by the angle variable ϕ). This technique, and variants thereof, has recently garnered interest for structuring metal phthalocyanines in photovoltaic devices,11 but a detailed study and nanostructural optimization for OPV applications has yet to be reported. GLAD has been used previously for structuring TiOx in dye-sensitized and hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells12 and to structure various organic materials.13 Column broadening is often observed when structuring materials with GLAD,14 a phenomenon which must be controlled for the construction of ideal architectures. Here we exploit the extensive parameters available within the GLAD technique to structure CuPc in order to develop film structures that are ideal for use in photovoltaic devices. Amongst the wide range of film morphologies fabricated are slanted columnar structures with uniform average column diameters of 50 nm grown to hundreds of nanometers in length while exhibiting little to no column broadening.
Results and discussion
Basic GLAD CuPc films
Examples of CuPc thermally deposited at normal incidence (α = 0°) on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO/glass substrates after 50 and 100 nm of growth are provided in Fig. 2a and 2b, respectively. In both cases substrate rotation was employed at a rate of one rotation per 10 nm of growth to ensure uniformity across substrates. At both thicknesses the surface morphology is characterized by a slight roughness but overall is quite smooth. Basic GLAD structures grown at α = 85° using the GLAD vertical post substrate motion algorithm are shown in Fig. 2c and 2d, respectively. In each case the substrate completed 10 rotations during deposition, at a constant rotation rate. The resulting structures exhibit a significant increase in surface area over the planar films of comparable thickness. These films are similar to those previously achieved and used in OPV devices.11 As the GLAD films grow, random variations in column height lead to some columns being blocked from the incident flux while others tend to widen, leading to larger features. Hence, the difference in feature size between the films shown in Fig. 2c and 2d can be attributed to the difference in thickness (40 versus 100 nm). This broadening effect is amplified significantly as the films grow thicker, as shown in Fig. 2e and 2f.

 Fig. 3  Side and top views of CuPc slanted posts grown on Si to (a,c) 240 nm thickness at α = 60° and (b,d) 700 nm thickness at α = 75°. 

          CuPc films grown at α = 75° to thicknesses of 300 and 1000 nm are shown as Fig. 2e and 2f, respectively. In both cases the substrate was continuously rotated with one rotation per 100 nm of growth. At a film thickness of 300 nm the CuPc features already reach diameters of up to 200 nm (much larger than that desired for use in OPV devices). The 1 μm thick film exhibits even further column broadening; here the surviving post structures grew to hundreds of nanometers in diameter. This effect is undesirable from an OPV device perspective, but is included to provide a more complete picture of how CuPc behaves within the GLAD regime and also to illustrate the power of the techniques used to constrain this broadening (described in the following sections).

Thin film deposition without substrate motion (i.e. OAD) is convenient from a manufacturing perspective and as such we grew a variety of slanted post morphologies in this manner. Some key results are shown in Fig. 3 which explicitly highlights the effects of α on film porosity. The film grown at α = 60° is very dense and leaves little opportunity for the penetration of a filling material that would complete a BHJ photovoltaic device. Interestingly, films grown in this manner but at only a 20 nm thickness have already been used to significantly improve photovoltaic device performance compared to a planar device architecture.11c Thus, further device improvement may be possible if the improvements due to structuring are maintained while moving to thicker films with greater light absorption. A more porous and columnar film is achieved when α = 75°, as seen in Fig. 3b. Interestingly, here the surviving features branch out into multiple threads approximately 30 nm in diameter, indicating that CuPc has a natural tendency to form thin nanorods. Thus, the challenge is to fabricate uniform films of these nanorods that are equally spaced and a few hundred nanometres in length. Slanted post films were grown from α = 75° to 85°; higher angles resulted in greater porosity with more severe column broadening. The films grown at α = 75° exhibited the best balance between increased porosity and limited broadening, and were therefore used as a starting point for the improvements described in the following section.
Controlling broadening: ϕ-sweep
Slanted post morphologies were grown at α = 75° to thicknesses of 160 nm and 280 nm, as shown in Fig. 4a and 4b, respectively. In both cases there is a large variance in post shape and diameter. Some surviving posts maintain the minimum post diameter of 30 nm throughout their growth while others exhibit significant broadening. In an effort to control this broadening and achieve greater uniformity throughout the film we have utilized the ϕ-sweep technique, which has been shown previously to control the broadening of GLAD films.15 As opposed to the continuous rotation in ϕ used to create vertical post films, the ϕ-sweep technique involves periodically and discretely rotating the substrate back and forth about the substrate normal as the film grows. Periodic shifts in ϕ by an angle of ±γ breaks the anisotropy of shadowing, which discourages column broadening and results in a more uniform film with more surviving posts. As seen in Fig. 4c, this technique yields a remarkably improved CuPc film structure with reduced average column diameters and greater overall film uniformity. This film was grown with γ = 30° and a frequency of one full sweep cycle per 6 nm of film growth.

            CuPc thin films grown on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO at α = 75° with and without ϕ-sweep algorithms. (a,b) Slanted posts grown with no substrate motion to thicknesses of 160 nm and 280 nm. (c) 370 nm thick film of slanted posts grown using ϕ-sweep with γ = 30°. Note that the films in (b) and (c) were grown to the same thickness as seen by the crystal thickness monitor in the deposition chamber. (d) 340 nm film of vertical posts grown via serial bideposition (γ = 90°). Both (c) and (d) were grown with a ϕ-sweep frequency of one cycle per 6 nm of growth. 
Depending on the amplitude of the shift in ϕ, denoted by γ, the tilt observed in the posts will also be affected. As γ is increased the posts become less slanted until at γ = 90° the posts are completely vertical – a case known as serial bideposition (SBD).16 At a low sweep frequency the result will be zigzag structures, while at a sufficiently high sweep frequency vertical posts will form. Therefore, this technique offers the ability to construct vertical post films without continuous rotation, which may be advantageous from a manufacturing perspective. An example result of this technique is shown in Fig. 4d.
The optical absorption characteristics of these films provide further insight into the porosity enhancements achieved by structuring. The absorption data from various slanted post and planar CuPc films are compared in Fig. 5. There are 3 groups of curves present. The 100 nm planar film exhibits comparable absorption to the 280 nm slanted post film and the 370 nm slanted post ϕ-sweep film, which suggests that these films contain approximately the same amount of CuPc material. Scattering effects of the GLAD films were neglected, as they typically become significant only for thicker films at higher deposition angles (near 85°).17 Therefore, the 370 nm slanted post ϕ-sweep film (Fig. 4c) can be thought of as a rearrangement of the 100 nm planar film occupying nearly 4 times the volume, yielding an effective density (or packing fraction) of 0.25. This density is comparable to that expected from theory18 and observed previously in inorganic GLAD films.17c Additionally, we can say that the ϕ-sweep technique succeeded not only in improving the uniformity of the 280 nm slanted post film, but increasing the porosity as well, as indicated by the thickness increase. Similarly, the 50 nm planar and 160 nm slanted post films have comparable absorption, as do the 20 nm planar and 30 nm slanted post films, as expected. Evidently, even for very thin films the absorption data identifies a significant difference between planar and structured CuPc films. An understanding of the degree of porosity enhancement achieved in these GLAD films can be gathered from the films' packing fractions, as summarized in Table 1. The packing fraction of each film is calculated as the ratio of the optical density of the GLAD film to that of a planar film with comparable absorption (which we define as having a packing fraction of 1). The optical density is calculated as the integration of the absorption curve divided by the film thickness. As such, a low packing fraction represents a higher porosity GLAD film and a high packing fraction represents a denser film.

          XRD patterns from various planar and GLAD CuPc films are shown in Fig. 6. Each pattern was fit using a two peak model based on Gaussian peak shapes corresponding to the (001) and (110) α-CuPc peaks at ca. 6.8 and 7.2° scattering angles, respectively.19 An example fit is provided as the inset to Fig. 6. Grain sizes listed in Table 1 were calculated using the Scherrer equation assuming spherical crystallites; grain size uncertainty is the result of measured peak widths for the sample and instrument resolution. Listed grain sizes of GLAD films are likely underestimates since the films exhibited strong texturing normal to the substrate and are columnar in nature, but the overall trends are valid.

XRD data for various planar and GLAD CuPc films. All non-planar films were grown at α = 75° unless otherwise specified. Inset: an example of the curve fitting model used to calculate grain size. Calculated grain sizes are listed in Table 1. 
In general, the grain sizes are limited by the smallest film feature dimension. For planar films the grain size is limited by the thickness, whereas for GLAD films it is limited by the column diameter. Distinct columns (found in the thicker films when α > 70°) lead to grain sizes in the range of 25 nm, a significant fraction of the column diameter. This implies that each column is composed of relatively few grains, which will encourage efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport.20 Of particular interest is the 370 nm ϕ-sweep film, which exhibited a slight increase in grain size relative to other GLAD films of comparable thickness. Therefore, the ϕ-sweep technique succeeded in improving both film uniformity (as discussed above) and film crystallinity, providing strong merit for the utilization of this technique.
Evidently, GLAD and the ϕ-sweep technique are very effective at tailoring the morphology and resulting porosity of CuPc films while maintaining comparable crystallinity to planar morphologies. All film morphologies discussed in this section were grown on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrates, making them amenable to OPV device manufacture. As a final measure of CuPc nanostructure manipulation, we investigated the use of substrate seeding to help pre-define column widths and spacing, as discussed in the following section.
Controlling broadening: substrate seeding
Nucleation sites for GLAD film growth are randomly distributed when grown on a planar substrate, and shadowing determines which features continue to grow as the film thickens. By seeding the substrate prior to deposition one can geometrically predefine the growth sites in order to encourage a particular morphology. The spacing and pattern of the seeds can be manipulated to tailor the characteristics of the resulting GLAD film, such as post diameter, spacing, and periodicity. This concept has enabled the fabrication of periodic 3D architectures for photonic crystals15 and is useful when pursuing ideal BHJ OPV device geometries.
Seeding is typically accomplished viaelectron beam lithography15 or using self-organized block copolymers.21 In this work we explore both (images of the seeding arrays can be found in the supplementary data), though the focus is primarily on the block copolymer method due to its superior potential for integration into a low-cost manufacturing process. Seeds produced viaelectron beam lithography were arranged in a square lattice pattern with 250 nm center-to-center seed spacing.15b We employed the ϕ-sweep technique for the CuPc deposition with γ = 26.5° to provide the optimal shadowing geometry of the seeds during deposition.15b The result is shown in Fig. 7, where we compare films grown during the same deposition on bare Si and seeded Si. The CuPc material conformed well to the periodic seeding pattern, yielding a very uniform array.

To accomplish seeded CuPc films with a more ideal spacing we utilized the block copolymer method for seeding. Platinum seeds were fabricated in a hexagonal arrangement on Si with ∼60 nm spacing according to the methods described in ref. 21a. We deposited CuPc films on both bare and seeded Si substrates at α = 80° and 85°. In all cases the ϕ-sweep technique was also employed with γ = 30° and a frequency of one full sweep cycle per 5 nm of film growth. One zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) film was also grown for comparison, with the same deposition conditions as the CuPc film at α = 80°. These films are all displayed in Fig. 8 and the film thicknesses and column densities are summarized in Table 2. Images used to calculate column densities can be found in the supplementary data. In all cases, the seeded substrates encouraged a higher column density and thinner average columns. Overall film thicknesses were increased with the seeded substrates, due to the limited broadening, improved column uniformity, and decreased intercolumn spurious growth. Keeping in mind that the films on both the seeded and unseeded substrates were fabricated in the same deposition (for each α value), we can interpret this thickness increase as the result of material being distributed more uniformly throughout thinner, longer columns. The effect of α on film porosity is also evident when comparing these films: higher α results in a more porous film, as expected. In addition, Fig. 8b clearly illustrates the competition between features that occurs during growth, as there are many small posts visible within the depth of the film. Interestingly, the seeded ZnPc film contained columns of even smaller diameter than the CuPc film grown under the same conditions (Fig. 8dvs.8f). Thus, having an array of seeds denser than the natural column spacing sets up competition between seeds that determines a unique structure for each material and deposition angle used.

All depositions utilized a ϕ-sweep substrate motion program with γ = 30° and 60 full cycles (one cycle per 4–5 nm of growth). In addition, each film received an equal amount of incident vapor flux as seen by the CTM in the deposition chamber.

The morphologies of CuPc and ZnPc observed at α = 80° on the seeded Si substrate are certainly most ideal from an OPV device perspective, as they contain dense arrays of uniform columns that are mostly restricted to diameters of 50 nm or less (this is comparable to the exciton diffusion length in these materials). Restricting the column diameters to these dimensions is critical (from an OPV device perspective) for maintaining a low average distance between the point of exciton generation and the donor/acceptor interface (where dissociation occurs). It is significant to observe the degree to which the film morphology can be influenced – and therefore manipulated – through substrate seeding. This provides motivation for further exploration in this area and for adapting the technique to be compatible with OPV device fabrication.
Experimental
Substrates
To mimic OPV device fabrication conditions, many of the films reported in this paper were grown on an indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate, coated with a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP Al 4083) viaspin casting. ITO substrates received a 1 min oxygen plasma etch cleaning treatment prior to PEDOT:PSS application. Bare Si substrates were used in parallel with the ITO substrates primarily for the purposes of obtaining XRD data, though some of the morphologies reported here are shown on Si. Microscope slides were also included in each deposition for the purpose of acquiring UV-Vis absorption data. The seeded substrates used as templates for film growth were fabricated viaelectron beam lithography15b and the block copolymer method.21a Images of the seeding arrays can be found in the supplementary data.
MPc film deposition and characterization

          CuPc and ZnPc material was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich and was subsequently purified via a one-step vacuum thermal gradient process at 400 °C. Films were grown in a two-motor GLAD apparatus at a throw distance of 34 cm. Schematics of the GLAD apparatus are shown in Fig. 1 of ref. 10d. The deposition of CuPc was performed at high vacuum (2 × 10−7 Torr) with a source temperature of 390 °C, resulting in a deposition rate of 0.7 Å/s at normal incidence. In all cases, a 10 nm planar layer of CuPc was deposited prior to GLAD growth. The images of CuPc films in Fig. 2 were taken with a JEOL 6301F field emission SEM, while all other images were acquired via a Hitachi S-4800 field emission SEM. Absorption data was acquired as the negative logarithm of the transmittance spectrum from a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer. XRD patterns were collected using a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped with a Cu source and area detector. Diffractometer instrument resolution was determined by collecting patterns from macroscale crystals of purified CuPc.
Conclusions
An optimization of nanostructured CuPc thin films suitable for use in BHJ OPV devices was performed, utilizing the various techniques available within the Glancing Angle Deposition process. Columnar structures were formed from tens to hundreds of nanometers in length with strong control over column diameter and spacing. Column broadening was shown to be a significant challenge for films beyond 100 nm in thickness, but was mitigated through the techniques of ϕ-sweep and substrate seeding. These techniques are able to create metal phthalocyanine nanostructures that are engineered for the short exciton diffusion lengths inherent in these materials. The methods described in this paper illustrate the strong potential that the GLAD technique holds for direct and controllable fabrication of ideal geometry bulk heterojunction OPV devices.

 	Fig. 1  Illustrations of the (a) ideal donor layer morphology and (b) ideal BHJ OPV device architecture. From the base, typical device materials are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/C60/BCP/Al.	 

 	Fig. 2  Planar and GLAD CuPc thin films grown on PEDOT:PSS (90 nm) coated ITO. (a,b) planar films grown to 50 and 100 nm. (c–f) GLAD films grown with a vertical post substrate motion algorithm at α = 85° (c,d) and α = 75° (e,f). Film thicknesses of (c–f) are 40, 100, 300 and 1000 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Side and top views of CuPc slanted posts grown on Si to (a,c) 240 nm thickness at α = 60° and (b,d) 700 nm thickness at α = 75°.	 

 	Fig. 4  
            CuPc thin films grown on PEDOT:PSS coated ITO at α = 75° with and without ϕ-sweep algorithms. (a,b) Slanted posts grown with no substrate motion to thicknesses of 160 nm and 280 nm. (c) 370 nm thick film of slanted posts grown using ϕ-sweep with γ = 30°. Note that the films in (b) and (c) were grown to the same thickness as seen by the crystal thickness monitor in the deposition chamber. (d) 340 nm film of vertical posts grown via serial bideposition (γ = 90°). Both (c) and (d) were grown with a ϕ-sweep frequency of one cycle per 6 nm of growth.

 	Fig. 6  
XRD data for various planar and GLAD CuPc films. All non-planar films were grown at α = 75° unless otherwise specified. Inset: an example of the curve fitting model used to calculate grain size. Calculated grain sizes are listed in Table 1.	 

 	Fig. 7  Oblique and side views of GLAD CuPc films grown at α = 80° with ϕ-sweep (one sweep cycle per 4 nm of film growth, with γ = 26.5°) on (a,b) bare Si and (c,d) seeded Si.	 

 	Fig. 8  Top (large image), side and oblique views of various CuPc (a–d) and ZnPc (e,f) films deposited at α = 85° (a,b) and α = 80° (c–f) onto bare Si (top row: a,c,e) and seeded Si (bottom row: b,d,f). All depositions utilized a ϕ-sweep substrate motion program with γ = 30° and 60 full cycles (one cycle per 4–5 nm of growth). In addition, each film received an equal amount of incident vapor flux as seen by the CTM in the deposition chamber.
