    , Accepted 2nd July 2013First published on 2nd July 2013AbstractIn this paper, tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TBC) is for the first time as far as we know determined by ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunoassay using an antibody-modified ternary hybrid CdTe/Au–TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) photoelectrode, developed by the pulse electrodeposition technique. The as-prepared hybrid shows enhanced photon absorption and photocurrent response, which subsequently increased the photoelectrical conversion efficiency in the visible region. TBC-antibody (Ab) was developed in rabbits as a result of immunization with the BSA–TBC conjugate and covalently cross-linked onto the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs. Since the photocurrent is highly dependent on the TiO2 surface properties, the specific interaction between TBC and the antibody results in a sensitive change in the photocurrent, which displayed a linear range of 5.0 × 10−11 to 5.0 × 10−5 M and a low detection limit of 5.0 × 10−11 M for TBC determination. This proposed strategy highlights the application of TiO2 nanotube in visible-light-activated photoelectrochemical biosensing, which could largely reduce the destructive effect of UV light on biomolecules.
1 Introduction
Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TBC, Fig. S-1,† CAS no. 52434-90-9) is a heterocyclic hexabrominated additive flame retardant, which is resistant to photodegradation, durable, and thermally stable. It is a white to off-white powder specially developed for use in polypropylene, polyethylene and polystyrene. In China, TBC has been widely applied since the mid-1980s in polymer products for fire safety reasons due to its excellent capability to reduce flammability.1,2 However, increasing concerns have been raised on the environmental problems caused by these flame retardant products. Numerous studies showed that these chemicals are persistent, have long distance transport and bioaccumulative abilities, and may potentially harm ecosystems and human health.3–5
Therefore, it is essential to develop a sensitive, rapid, accurate, and selective method for determination of TBC. Well established methods include gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS).6,7 Although good sensitivity has been achieved, these protocols are relatively expensive, involve time-consuming sample preparation, and they must be performed by highly trained and experienced personnel. So, they are not suitable for field tests. Zhao et al. of our research group proposed an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technique for the determination of TBC with a limit of detection of 5.0 × 10−8 M (S/N = 3) and a linear range of 1.0 × 10−7 to 5.0 × 10−5 M,8 which is not suitable for the detection of ultratrace TBC in environmental samples because of its low solubility in water.
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) label-free immunoassay is a newly developed analytical method for the rapid and high-throughput biological assay.9–11 Compared with conventional optical methods, the PEC immunoassay is simpler in instrumentation and easier to be miniaturized. In the PEC process, the light-induced current is used to quantify the target. Benefiting from the separation of excitation source (light) and detection signal (current), some undesired background signals are reduced and high sensitivity is achieved. Of course, photoactive material and antibody features are the key to influencing the performance of the PEC immunosensor.
Titania (TiO2) is a wide-band-gap semiconductor material that has received intense scrutiny for a broad range of applications, thanks to its intriguing physical–chemical properties and its cheap, abundant, and reasonably non-toxic nature. Among all the TiO2 nanostructural materials, TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) prepared on Ti foil by electrochemical anodization have attracted a lot of attention due to their facile synthesis process, high surface area, high orientation, uniform interfacial structure and excellent biocompatibility. However, the application of TiO2 is limited by its band-gap energy of 3.2 eV12 since it can only absorb UV light (λ < 400 nm) which can kill biomolecules. Modification of TiO2 with narrow-band-gap semiconductors is essential for PEC biosensing applications to enhance the absorption in the visible range (400 nm < λ < 800 nm) and increase the photoelectrical conversion efficiency. CdTe is an active PEC material in the visible range with a band-gap energy of 1.4672 eV (∼1.5 eV), and has been successfully used in solar cells.13,14
Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), with unique chemical and physical properties, are extremely suitable for the design of new sensing devices.15 Indeed, the biocompatibility and large surface area of Au NPs provide a favorable microenvironment for the adsorption of biomolecules without denaturation.16 Furthermore, Au NPs have been employed either to act as an electron transfer bridge for direct electrical contacting of redox proteins with electrode supports or to play a crucial role in both immunosensors and DNA sensors.17,18 All of these Au NPs features constitute useful strategies for the preparation of biosensors with developed analytical performance.
Combining noble metals such as Pt or Au with TiO2 has been demonstrated to increase the photocatalytic efficiency.19,20 Through the deposition of metal nanoparticles onto the semiconductor surface, a Schottky barrier can be created at the metal–semiconductor junction, which is due to the difference in the Fermi-level positions of the metal and the semiconductor.21 This leads to a continuous transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the metal nanoparticles until the equilibrium of the Fermi energy levels is achieved. In such metal–metal oxide systems, during photoexcitation, electrons can migrate from the semiconductor to the metal across the Schottky barrier, where they are trapped and the electron–hole recombination phenomenon is suppressed, whereby the hole is then free to diffuse through TiO2 to the surface where it can be used to oxidize organic species. Therefore, the Schottky barrier can serve as an efficient electron trap to avoid electron–hole recombination,22,23 which facilitates the charge separation and subsequently the interfacial charge transfer whilst enhancing the photoelectrical conversion efficiency.
In this work, CdTe/Au nanocrystals (NCs) were co-deposited on the TiO2 NTAs by the pulse electrodeposition technique. The advantage of self-assembled TiO2 NTAs with metal Au NPs and narrow-band-gap compound semiconductor CdTe NPs is that they construct a stepwise structure of band-edge levels in the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode which benefits separation of the electron–hole pairs. The co-sensitized electrode reveals excellent photoactivity. A label-free TBC immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the anti-TBC polyclonal antibody on the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs substrate. A schematic of the immunosensor construction and ideal stepwise band-edge structure for efficient transport of the excited electrons and holes in the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode is depicted in Scheme 1.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
Titanium foils (250 μm thick, 99.8%) were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). NaF, NaHSO4, CdSO4, NaTeO3, H2AuCl4, TBC, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pentabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE), pentachlorophenol (PCP), KOH and H2SO4 of analytic grade were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Chitosan (CS), glutaraldehyde (GLD), Tween 20, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Amresco (US). TBC-antibody (Ab) was developed in rabbits as a result of immunization with BSA–TBC conjugate (ESI S-3†). Phosphate buffer solution was prepared with NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Double-distilled water was used throughout this experiment.
Titanium foil was cut into 1.0 cm × 3.5 cm strips. Strips were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone and ethanol, each for 5 min, respectively. The cleaned titanium strips were anodized at a constant potential of 15 V in an electrolyte containing 0.1 M NaF and 0.5 M NaHSO4 at room temperature for 3 h in a two-electrode configuration with a platinum cathode and the Ti strip as the anode. After oxidation, the amorphous TiO2 NTAs were crystalline and photolytically activated by annealing in air at 500 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 2 °C min−1.
CdTe/Au nanoparticles were pulse electrodeposited on the as-prepared TiO2 NTAs simultaneously using an electrochemical workstation (IM6ex, Zahner Elektrik, German) in a conventional three-electrode system with the TiO2 NTAs (on Ti foil) as the working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode in electrolyte solution containing 1.0 mmol L−1 H2AuCl4, 0.08 mol L−1 CdSO4 and 0.05 mol L−1 NaTeO3 (pH = 2 adjusted using 1 mol L−1 H2SO4). The pulse on-off time ratio was 0.02:1 with a running voltage of −1 V. The loading amount of the deposit was tuned by adjusting the number of the pulse sequence, here 200, 400, 600 and 800 pulse sequences were chosen for deposition. After washing several times with distilled water, the CdTe/Au nanoparticles-modified TiO2 NTAs were heated in nitrogen atmosphere at 300 °C for 2 h.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies of the unmodified and modified TiO2 NTAs were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi, model S-4800, Japan). An energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer fitted to electron microscope was used for elemental analysis. Light absorption properties were measured using UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, SHIMADZU, UV-2450) within a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded at room temperature using an Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 270 nm.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical activity determination
The photoelectrochemical responses of the samples were measured using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660C, Shanghai, Chenhua, China Instrument Co. Ltd.) in a standard three-electrode configuration, with the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode as the working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode with 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution as the electrolyte. An incident light intensity through an IR cut-off filter (λ ≥ 800 nm) and a UV cut-off filter (λ < 400 nm) from a 300 W Xe lamp (CHF-XQ-500W, Beijing Trusttech. Co. Ltd.) was tuned to be 100 mW cm−2 measured using a radiometer (OPHIR, Newport, USA). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to understand the charge transport properties of the heterojunction electrode. The measurements were done at 0.9 V using similar conditions as described above for photoelectrochemical tests. The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave is 50 mV and the frequency range examined is 100 kHz–1 Hz. PEC immunoassay was performed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M ascorbic acid (AA) as the oxidative quencher.
2.4 Antibody preparation and immunosensor construction
The polyclonal antibody to TBC was developed in rabbits as a result of immunization with the BSA–hapten conjugate. The details of the hapten and conjugated antigen synthesis along with immunization procedures were all shown in the ESI (S-2 and S-3†). The affinity and sensitivity of the antisera for the different antigens were determined by measuring the binding between each antisera in serial dilutions (1:2000 to 1:128000) and each coating antigen at different concentrations (0.01–100 μg mL−1) as described previously.24,25 The larger dilution rate indicates the higher affinity. And the half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of the antisera (IC50) was determined by indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The lower IC50 represents the stronger specificity of the antisera. The optimized dilution rate and IC50 values were 1:16000 and 5.17 μg L−1, respectively, and then it was used to construct the immunosensor which shows high selectivity and sensitivity.
Operational approach is as follow: 50 μL CS solution dissolved in 1% acetic acid was added dropwise onto a CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs substrate of 3 cm2 size and dried at 50 °C. After washing with 0.1 M NaOH and water, the electrode was dipped in 5% GLD solution for 30 min, then rinsed with water to remove the physically adsorbed GLD. 50 μL of 0.5 mg mL−1 TBC-antibody was added dropwise onto the GLD-activated electrode. After incubating at 4 °C for 24 h, the antibody-modified sensor was rinsed with 0.05% Tween 20 solution and then incubated in 3% (w/v) BSA for 1 h to block the unbound sites. The as-prepared sensor was finally rinsed with 0.05% Tween 20. The PEC intensity of the sensor was detected in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M ascorbic acid (AA) after incubating it in 50 μL of TBC solution at 37 °C for 1 h. All the above-mentioned solutions except for the TBC solution were prepared with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). The TBC solution was prepared with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 5% DMSO.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs

Fig. 1a shows that the TiO2 NTAs are highly oriented with a diameter of 60–90 nm and a wall thickness of around 15 nm. The presence of well-aligned NTAs vertically oriented from the Ti foil substrate not only provides an accessible means of depositing a high concentration of sensitizing NCs, but promotes the directional charge transport due to the one-dimensional feature of the tubes.26 The FESEM images of the Au/TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/TiO2 NTAs are shown in Fig. 1b and 1c. CdTe/Au NCs were pulse electrocodeposited on the TiO2 NTAs. The FESEM images of CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs with 400 and 800 pulse sequences are shown in Fig. 1d and 1e. By comparison, Fig. 1d shows that fine CdTe/Au NCs with an average size of 10 nm are evenly distributed on the TiO2 NTAs surface. The loaded CdTe/Au NCs increase with the pulse sequences increasing from 400 to 800. However, significant particle aggregation occurs at high sequence depositions, resulting in partial blocking of the TiO2 NTA entrances (Fig. 1e). No obvious blocking of the entrances is observed at low sequence depositions (Fig. 1d). The EDX spectrum (Fig. 1f) exhibits the characteristic peaks of Cd, Te, Au, Ti, and O.

3.2 PEC behavior of CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs
For a PEC sensor, a high photoelectrical activity is essential to achieve a high sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 2A, under 100 mW cm−2 of white light illumination and 0 V bias versus SCE, the unmodified TiO2 NTAs show a weak response, while the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs show a high photocurrent response. The modification of CdTe/Au NCs results in a significant increase in the absorption in visible region, allowing efficient light harvesting.27 The short-circuit current (Isc) of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs is much higher than that of the Au- or CdTe-deposited TiO2 NTAs (Fig. 2A), with Isc values of 0.63 (CdTe/Au), 0.40 (CdTe), 0.21(Au) and 0.10 mA cm−2 (pure TiO2 NTAs), respectively. The open-circuit potential (Voc) of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode is around −1.17 V which is more negative than that (Voc ≈ −0.91 V) of the TiO2 NTAs electrode (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the coupling between TiO2 and CdTe/Au shifts the Fermi level to a more negative potential. The more negative Voc means a more effective separation of photogenerated pairs.27Fig. 2C shows the corresponding light energy to chemical energy conversion (photoconversion) efficiency calculated using the following equation:28η(%) = jp[Eθrev − |Eapp|] × 100/(I0)where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), jpEθrev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power input, and I0 is the power density of the incident light (100 mW cm−2). Eθrev is the standard reversible potential of 1.23 V [versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)]. The applied potential is Eapp = Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential (versus SCE) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent is measured under irradiation and Eaoc is the electrode potential (versus SCE) of the same working electrode under open-circuit condition.

Compared with the pure TiO2 NTAs, Au/TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/TiO2 NTAs electrodes, a much higher photoconversion efficiency is achieved on the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode. The highest photoconversion efficiency of 0.35% is 5 times that on the pure TiO2 NTAs electrode (0.07%). The deposition of Au and CdTe can capture and transport the photogenerated charges, retarding the combination of the photogenerated holes and electrons, consequently enhancing the photoactivity of the photoanode.
The Nyquist diagram of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is an effective way to measure the electron transfer resistance. The size of the arc radius on the Nyquist plot is related to the resistance of electron transfer. It also reflects the energy barrier of electrode reaction.29Fig. 2D shows the EIS responses of pure TiO2 NTAs, Au/TiO2 NTAs, CdTe/TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrodes in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte without illumination condition, where Z′ and Z′′ represent the real and imaginary components of the impedance, respectively. The arc sizes are observably reduced for both the Au/TiO2 NTAs and the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrodes in relation to that of the pure TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/TiO2 NTAs electrodes. This indicates that the charge transfer resistance decreases after the deposition of the Au NPs. The decrease in resistance among CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs, Au/TiO2 NTAs, pure TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/TiO2 NTAs electrodes indicates that the deposition technique employed here gives rise to a good interaction of the Au NPs and CdTe NPs with the TiO2 NTAs (better Ohmic contacts), and an efficient and faster charge transfer through the coupled semiconductor–metal complex material. The increase in resistance of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs over that of the Au/TiO2 NTAs electrode, as shown in Fig. 2D, is reasonable. This is due to the loading of the CdTe semiconductor, whose resistance is much higher than Au metal. Similarly, the resistance of the CdTe/TiO2 NTAs is also higher than the pure TiO2 NTAs electrode.
The optical properties of CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs were further characterized by UV-vis DRS and PL spectra. Fig. 3A shows that the modification of CdTe/Au results in a significant enhancement in absorption in the visible range (curve a), and a significant red shift of approximately 30 nm is observed on the 400 sequence-deposited CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs, indicating that the loading of CdTe/Au nanoparticles significantly improves the visible light absorption. Fig. 3B shows a decrease in PL intensity (curve d). PL spectra have been widely used to study the surface structure and excited states which follow a surface process involving the electron–hole lifetime.30 The photogenerated electron–hole pairs are recombined at the oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 NTAs surface resulting in PL.31,32 As shown in Fig. 3B, the modified and unmodified TiO2 NTAs display essentially the same peak position, whereas the photoluminescence intensity decreases in the order of pure TiO2 NTAs, CdTe–TiO2 NTAs, Au–TiO2 NTAs and CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode. The lower PL intensity of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode suggests a lower density of recombination centers (surface states), and consequently a longer lifetime of the photogenerated carriers resulted from the introduction of CdTe/Au. This result is consistent with the charge transport properties of these electrodes mentioned above.

Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent responses of TiO2 NTAs loaded with different sequences of CdTe/Au NCs. The electrode responds promptly to light on/off. The 400 sequence deposition of CdTe/Au achieves the highest photocurrent. Sequence depositions greater than 400 (line d and e in Fig. 4) lead to over-deposition of CdTe/Au NCs, which may block the TiO2 NTAs entrance (Fig. 1e) resulting in a decrease in the surface area and consequently the photocurrent. However, no obvious blocking of the entrance is observed at low sequences deposition (Fig. 1d).

3.3 Performance of the immunosensor
Due to the high photoelectrical activity, the 400 sequences CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode prepared by electrocodeposition was used as the substrate of the PEC biosensor. Scheme 1 presents a model energy scheme of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode. Since the conduction band (CB) level of TiO2 lies at a more positive potential than the CB level of CdTe, electron injection is expected from the photoexcited CdTe into the CB of TiO2, whereas holes can accumulate in the valence band (VB) of CdTe to form hole centers, which can be consumed by participating in oxidation. Thereby, charge carrier recombination can be hindered. However, when the metal Au is coupled with TiO2, the photogenerated electron will gradually transfer from TiO2 to Au until a thermodynamic equilibrium is reached.22,33 At this time, the two Fermi levels are equal. Under the effect of the Schottky barrier formed in the interface between Au and TiO2, the photogenerated electron will continuously transfer across the Au–TiO2 interface to Au, and flow to the external circuit through the conductive Ti substrate. Simultaneously, holes in TiO2 VB transfer to the CdTe VB, accumulate there, and are consumed by participating in oxidation. Thus recombination is effectively suppressed, which is responsible for the high photocurrent in the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode. With the immunoreaction between TBC and the antibody modified on the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode, an immunocomplex was formed, resulting in an increase in the steric hindrance toward the diffusion of quencher molecules and/or photogenerated holes at the electrode interface, and consequently resulted in a decrease in photocurrent.
In order to obtain a high and stable photocurrent, electron donors (or oxidative quenchers) are necessary. An efficient electron donor can capture the hole of the semiconductor, suppressing electron–hole recombination and therefore enhancing the photocurrent intensity. Although KOH is used as the electron donor in strong alkaline solution (pH = 13), a mild pH solution is particularly required in biosensing. Antioxidants including uric acid, glutathione, and AA were investigated as the electron donor and the results are shown in Fig. 5A. The highest photocurrent is achieved in AA solution. The photocurrent increases with increasing AA concentration up to 0.25 M, and then decreases thereafter (Fig. 5B). The decrease in photocurrent at high AA concentration can be ascribed to the absorbance of the quencher solution, which thus decreases the irradiation intensity and the efficiency of excited electron–hole center formation.9,10

(B) AA concentration-dependent photocurrent response in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). 
Direct label-free detection exhibits many advantages such as saving both time and expense.11,34,35 In this work, a label-free immunosensor was fabricated by successively modifying the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode with anti-TBC Ab and BSA. The corresponding modification-induced changes in photocurrent are shown in Fig. 6A. As expected, the successive binding of Ab and BSA on the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode induces a significant decrease in the photocurrent. Such a decrease in photocurrent is ascribed to the modification-induced steric hindrance toward the diffusion of quencher molecules and/or photogenerated holes at the electrode interface. The specific immunoreaction between TBC and the antibody results in a further 25.5% decrease in the photocurrent intensity. Fig. 6B shows the reproducible photocurrent response of the sensor, with no decrease after repeated irradiation of 10 times. The decrease in photocurrent was less than 10% over four weeks' usage, suggesting the high photochemical stability of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode.

Fig. 7A shows the photocurrent–time curves of the immunosensor detected in 20 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 M AA after incubating it in different TBC concentrations at 37 °C for 1 h. The control experiment (without TBC) shows the highest response of 170.1 μA (I0, curve a). In the presence of TBC, the specific immunoreaction between TBC and the antibody results in a decrease of the photocurrent from 170.1 to 126.7 μA with the TBC concentrations increasing from 0 M to 0.05 mM (curves a–h). The inset of Fig. 7A shows the photocurrent response with no amplification.

The inset shows the photocurrent response with no amplification. (B) The calibration curve. The standard deviation (error bar) and the average (I0 − I)/I0 were calculated from responses of (A) at different times. 
The normalized photocurrent response gradually increases with increasing TBC concentrations (Fig. 7B). The relative change of photocurrent is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the TBC concentration in the range of 50 pM to 50 μM, as shown in Fig. 7B, with a correlation coefficient of 0.986. The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as 50 pM as it can be completely distinguished from the control (Fig. 7A). With respect to competing detection approaches, Zhao et al.8 applied a gold nanoparticles (Au NPs)-modified gold electrode with silver nitrate-enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for the determination of TBC with a LOD of 0.05 μM (S/N = 3) and a linear range of 1.0 × 10−7 to 5.0 × 10−5 M. Ruan and co-workers reported the determination of TBC in water samples by using a high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) method with a LOD of 1.5 ng L−1 (2 pM, S/N = 10).6 Although good sensitivity has been achieved by using HPLC-MS, the protocol is relatively expensive and involves time-consuming sample preparation. Therefore, it is not suitable for in situ rapid analysis. The photoelectrochemical immunosensor we propose is highly desirable for the detection of trace amounts TBC in environmental samples.
The specificity of the TBC immunosensor was investigated by measuring the sensor responses to five other kinds of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 3-chlorophenol (3-CP), pentabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and pyrene, where the concentration of the above POPs are 10-fold that of TBC. As shown in Table 1, the (I0 − I)/I0 for 5 × 10−8 M of these compounds are 1.2% (2,4-DCP), 0.8% (3-CP), 2.3% (PBDE), 0.7% (PCP) and 1.9% (pyrene), whereas the (I0 − I)/I0 to 5 × 10−9 M of TBC is 13%. The normalized photocurrent response to TBC is much higher (5.7–18.6×) than that of the five other compounds. A relatively high selectivity is achieved.

The reproducibility of the immunosensor was evaluated by intra-assay and inter-assay relative standard deviation (RSD). A 50 μM TBC solution was repeatedly determined using the immunosensor for five times, giving an intra-assay RSD of 3.3%. The inter-assay RSD on six immunosensors is 6.1%. The results indicate a good reproducibility of the fabrication protocol.
3.4 TBC assay in water samples
The recovery rates were investigated with water samples spiked with TBC at concentrations of 0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 nM respectively, giving recovery rates ranging from 90.8 to 101% (Table 2). The high recovery rate indicates an applicable strategy for TBC monitoring in real water samples. The potential application of the sensor for quick scanning of TBC was then validated by analysis of tap water and river water collected from several wastewater outlets along the Xiangjiang River (Changsha, China) and the Liuyang River, which is located southwest of Liuyang, Hunan province, in southern China; most sampling sites were located downstream of the outlet of a TBC manufacturing plant. The water samples were collected approximately 40 cm below the water surface.

All the water samples were filtered with 0.22 μm cellulose membranes and stored in precleaned glass bottles. 50 μL of as-treated water samples were analyzed (Fig. 8). The content of TBC in the Liuyang River water was estimated to be 0.14 nM (Fig. 8A), whereas the content of TBC in tap water or Xiangjiang River water is under the LOD (Fig. 8B). The water sample was also analyzed by HPLC-MS method (data not shown). The HPLC-MS result is 0.15 nM, which is consistent with the proposed method.

The long-term storage stability of the immunosensor was investigated by storing the immunosensor in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) at 4 °C in a refrigerator. After four weeks, the immunosensor still retained about 92.6% of the initial response, indicating good stability.
4 Conclusions
Tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TBC) was measured for the first time by ultrasensitive PEC immunoassay using an antibody-modified ternary hybrid CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs photoelectrode developed by the pulse electrocodeposition technique. The ternary hybrid CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode shows an enhanced photon absorption and photocurrent generation since the Au NPs accelerate the migration of the photo-generated electrons. The highest photoconversion efficiency observed for the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode is 0.35% as compared with pure TiO2 NTAs (0.07%) under visible light irradiation. The improved photoelectrochemical activity of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode is attributed to the synergistic effect of CdTe NPs, Au NPs, and TiO2 NTAs. A label-free, highly selective and ultrasensitive PEC immunosensor for TBC was fabricated by successive modification of the CdTe/Au–TiO2 NTAs electrode with anti-TBC Ab and BSA. TBC was quantified by measuring the photocurrent intensity. The sensitive detection of TBC was achieved with a LOD of 50 pM and a linear range of 50 pM to 50 μM. The analysis of TBC in Liuyang River water illustrated the applicability of the immunosensor.
