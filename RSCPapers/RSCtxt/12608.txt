    , Accepted 29th June 2019First published on 1st July 2019AbstractMethylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite commonly used in hole-transport material (HTM)-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) is unstable in ambient conditions, and its glove box preparation process is essential but incompatible with the low-cost mass-production of C-PSCs. Although mixed cation/halide type perovskites are more durable against exposure to heat and moisture compared with a single cation MAPbI3 perovskite, the air-processed fabrication of stable mixed perovskite films out of the glove box has yet to be achieved in C-PSCs. We herein fabricate a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)-incorporated FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite film in ambient air, in which hydrophobic MWCNTs are firstly introduced into the mixed perovskite matrix to mediate the crystallization of FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y and prevent the erosion by moisture of the perovskite layer. Based on the as-prepared MWCNT-incorporated FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y, the whole C-PSCs with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/C are constructed under actual ambient air conditions with low annealing temperature <150 °C, achieving outstanding power conversion efficiencies of 16.25% (0.08 cm2) and 12.34% (1 cm2). Particularly, the all-air-processed mixed cation C-PSCs maintain a long-term stability of 93% under ambient air conditions for 22 weeks, exhibiting the best ambient-air stability of PSCs fabricated in air so far. This study provides a feasible route for the commercialization development of low-cost, stable and efficient PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted intensive attention due to their impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 24.2%,1–6 but the problems concerning stability and cost still hinder their commercialization.7–10 Hole transport material (HTM)-free carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) are arguably the most promising for commercial applications because of their low cost, outstanding photovoltaic performance, excellent stability and simple manufacturing process.11–13 Since Han and colleagues first fabricated C-PSCs by infiltrating methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) into a high-temperature processing device with the configuration of TiO2/ZrO2/C, the PCEs of the C-PSCs have increased from the initial 6.6% to the optimized 15.6% by adding an ammonium chloride additive to the perovskite precursor solution to assist the crystallization of the perovskite.11,14,15 Further, to reduce the energy consumption cost of C-PSCs, a low-temperature carbon electrode based PSC with the structure of FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/C was developed by Yang and coworkers, yielding the highest reported PCE of 14.38% for C-PSCs up to then.16 Recently, our group constructed a series of low-temperature processed C-PSCs based on the MAPbI3 perovskite, achieving a remarkable PCE of 16.03%.17–19 Despite these achievements, it should be pointed out that the MAPbI3 absorber layer in C-PSCs is commonly fabricated in the glove box, which is incompatible with the low-cost mass-production of C-PSCs.
In comparison with single cation MAPbI3 perovskites, mixed cation/halide type perovskites have been demonstrated to be more durable against exposure to heat and moisture.20 Accordingly, traditional PSCs with organic HTMs based on air-processed mixed perovskites out of the glove box have been successfully fabricated.20–27 For instance, Lan et al. prepared mixed MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films in air by partly replacing MAI with MACl, whose devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/spiro-OMeTAD/Au could only maintain a stability of 70% for 96 h under air conditions.21 With the same device structure, the improved air-processed mixed MAPbI3−x(SCN)x perovskite device prepared by Yan et al. maintained a stability of 86.7% for 500 h under air conditions.22 In particular, Singh and Miyasaka fabricated mixed perovskite films by adding 5 mol% CsI into (FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17 under controlled dry air conditions with humidity below 25%, and incorporated this perovskite into PSCs with the structure of FTO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/Csx(FA0.83MA0.17) (1−x)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, achieving an outstanding PCE of 20.8% and a high retention of device stability for more than 18 weeks.20 However, to date, the air-processed fabrication of mixed perovskites out of the glove box is barely implemented in C-PSCs under actual air conditions. This concern brings us to explore the possibility of fabricating a stable air-processed mixed perovskite and its assembling device i.e. mixed perovskite based C-PSC to satisfy the commercialization requirements of stable PSCs.
Besides, incorporation of a small amount of carbon materials (e.g. carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphdiyne and graphene quantum dots) into perovskites has been reported to be valid to improve the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite in the glove box in traditional PSCs with organic HTMs, such as the CNT-incorporated single cation MAPbI3 perovskite, the graphdiyne-incorporated MAPbI3 perovskite or mixed FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskites.28–30 This prompted us to hypothesize that carbon materials may be introduced into mixed perovskite to assist the crystallization of the perovskite out of the glove box for C-PSCs. In this context, we herein attempt to fabricate a stable all-air processed mixed cation C-PSC. Firstly, we introduce hydrophobic MWCNTs into the mixed perovskite FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y to achieve air preparation of a stable perovskite film (Fig. S1†), in which MWCNTs are added to the FAI:MABr precursor to mediate the crystallization of the perovskite and facilitate formation of compact and large-size perovskite film. Interestingly, hydrophobic MWCNTs are found to be partly naked on the surface of perovskite films, which helps perovskite films prevent the erosion by moisture. Such stable air-processed mixed perovskite films then are incorporated into HTM-free C-PSCs in the ambient environment, achieving all-air processed photovoltaic devices with the remarkable PCEs of 16.25% (0.08 cm2) and 12.34% (1 cm2). Particularly, the fabricated mixed cation C-PSCs maintain a long-term stability of 93% for 22 weeks, exhibiting the best ambient-air-stable performance among PSCs fabricated in air so far.20–27
Results and discussion
The mixed perovskite films were fabricated via a two-step deposition (Fig. S1†).31,32 First, a yellow transparent dense PbI2 film was deposited from a PbI2/DMSO/DMF solution onto the ITO/SnO2 substrate. Then the FAI:MABr precursor in IPA solvent was spin-coated on the pre-deposited PbI2 film via the inter-diffusion process to form the mixed FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite films. The single cation MAPbI3 perovskite was also prepared in parallel using the above same method. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of MAPbI3 and FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y films are presented in Fig. S2.† By comparison, the FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite film shows a larger grain size with good crystallinity (Fig. S2a and b†). XRD patterns (Fig. S2c†) also show intensified peaks for the FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite compared to the MAPbI3, indicating a highly crystalline perovskite with the mixed cations. Besides, a diffraction peak (12.5°) of PbI2 can be detected in the MAPbI3 perovskite film, indicating the degradation of pure MAPbI3 perovskite in the air fabrication process. This verifies the better stability of FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y against moisture compared to the MAPbI3 perovskite.20 To obtain more stable mixed cationic perovskites under ambient air conditions, a small amount of MWCNT dispersion liquid (0.5% and 1.0% in volume fraction) was added to the FAI:MABr precursor solution to further improve the perovskite morphology and crystallinity. SEM images of the mixed FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite films with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.5% and 1.0%) are presented in Fig. 1a–c. From Fig. 1a, one can see that pristine perovskite particles are 100–600 nm in size with a great number of grain boundaries. Compared to the pristine perovskite without MWCNTs, the perovskite with 0.5% MWCNTs shows visibly larger crystallite dimensions (Fig. 1b). As reported in the literature,33 MWCNTs filled the boundary between perovskite grains as templates may reduce the transformation kinetics of the perovskite which benefits more defect-free crystal growth of the perovskite, hence resulting in increased perovskite grain size and improved perovskite crystallinity. Such high-quality perovskite films obtained by incorporating MWCNTs into the perovskite layer have also been observed in conventional PSCs.29,34,35 It is well-known that moisture can easily penetrate the grain boundaries to degrade the perovskite film.36 Thus, enlarging the perovskite particle size is an effective solution to improve the stability of an air-processed perovskite. Additionally, a small amount of MWCNTs is observed out of the surface of the perovskite, which can bridge the perovskite layer with a carbon electrode to facilitate the charge transfer. However, excess MWCNTs (1.0%) impede the growth and formation of a uniform perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 1c, resulting in smaller crystallite dimensions of the perovskite and many pinholes in the perovskite film.
 Fig. 1  (a–c) SEM images, (d–f) AFM topographic images and (g–i) the contact angles with water of perovskite films with different MWCNTs doping content (W/O, 0.5% and 1.0% of MWCNTs, respectively). 
To intuitively compare the flatness of perovskite films, atomic force microscope (AFM) images of perovskite films with different MWCNT contents on ITO/glass substrates and the corresponding root mean square (RMS) roughness were measured and are shown in Fig. 1d–f.37 The RMS roughness of the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs is determined to be 15.9 nm, which is slightly larger than that of the pristine perovskite (11.4 nm). The slightly rough surface of the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs is ascribed to a small amount of exposed MWCNTs on the perovskite surface. Oppositely, excess MWCNTs (1.0%) make the RMS roughness of the perovskite film increase to 28.6 nm, which could be confirmed by the SEM morphology of the involved perovskite film. The wetting capability of water on perovskite films plays an important role in keeping the stability of perovskite films and devices.38 By comparing the contact angles of water on perovskite films with different MWCNT contents (Fig. 1g–i), it can be found that the contact angles of water on the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs is 90.80°, which is obviously higher than that of the pristine perovskite (29.54°), indicating that the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs can resist the erosion by moisture effectively.
XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) show that all perovskite films are tetragonal phases with diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 24.6°, 28.5°, 32.0°, 40.5°, and 43.3°, in line with the reflections at the (110), (202), (220), (310), (224), and (314), respectively.39–41 Note that the peak intensity at 14.2° and 28.5° becomes stronger after the introduction of MWCNTs, which indicates enhanced crystallinity in the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs.42,43 Nevertheless, when the molar ratio of MWCNTs increases to 1.0%, the perovskite film shows a slight signal of PbI2 at 12.5° and the crystallinity of the perovskite is weakened. The overdose of MWCNCTs has a negative impact on the crystallinity and gives rise to the degradation of the perovskite.44 The variation of XRD patterns is consistent with perovskite film morphologies in SEM images with the variation of MWCNTs doses as well. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra (Fig. 2b) show that the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs exhibits a higher optical absorption coefficient as compared to the pristine perovskite film. However, too much MWCNT content (1.0%) lead to lower crystallinity of the perovskite film and hence an inferior optical absorption coefficient. The increased absorption coefficient of the perovskite is in favor of an enhanced current density when employed in PSCs.29
 Fig. 2  (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV-vis absorption spectra and (c and d) the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films with different MWCNT contents. 
The measurements of steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were performed on the SnO2/perovskite films with different MWCNT contents on ITO substrates to study the effect of MWCNTs on the optical properties and charge transfer and recombination (Fig. 2c and d).39 As can be seen from the steady-state PL spectra in Fig. 2c, the PL emission peak centered at 794 nm does not change even when the amount of MWCNTs in perovskite films increases, indicating no change of the energy bandgap of the perovskite. However, the peak intensity becomes weaker in SnO2/perovskite films with 0.5% MWCNTs, indicating that the PL quenching process is enhanced. This indicates reduced defect states of perovskite films with 0.5% MWCNTs, which can lead to the enhanced FF and PCE of the device by decreasing the nonradiative recombination.29 Excess MWCNTs (1.0%) weakens the PL quenching process. At the same time, TRPL spectra are also used to evaluate the photogenerated carrier lifetime (Fig. 2d). The spectra are fitted by a biexponential decay function, and the obtained results suggest the existence of two quenching processes including the carrier extraction occurring at the interfaces of SnO2/perovskite with different MWCNT contents and the carrier trap recombination.28 Detailed fitting parameters are presented in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 2d, the average carrier lifetimes of SnO2/perovskite films with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.5% and 1.0%) are 16.42, 13.71 and 24.96 ns, respectively. Such results indicate a faster photogenerated carrier extraction for SnO2/perovskite films with 0.5% MWCNTs, which is beneficial for the enhancement of Jsc and PCE values.
We fabricated the PSC devices using mixed FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite films with different MWCNT contents as sunlight absorbing layers with the carbon-based device structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/C (Fig. 3a). All operations were processed under ambient air conditions. The device configurations of the C-PSCs are shown in Fig. S3.† The carbon electrode was fabricated by directly printing a commercial carbon paste on the perovskite layer, according to previous procedures (Fig. S3a†).17 It is quite clear that the thickness of the carbon electrode is about 30 μm, which could efficiently prevent moisture penetration into the perovskite layer. Perovskite films with different amounts of MWCNTs were fabricated on SnO2 films by using a two-step inter-diffusion process (see in Fig. S3b–d†).32 The thickness of perovskite layers is about 400 nm. As for perovskite films with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.5%), the perovskite grains are well structured (Fig. S3b and c†), which can ensure efficient charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the SnO2 electron transfer layer and carbon electrode. Excess MWCNTs (1.0%) inhibit perovskite crystal growth and leads to the formation of low-crystallinity perovskite (Fig. S3d†).

Fig. 3b and S4† show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices using perovskite films with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0%) under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and S2.† It is evidently shown that the pristine FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y perovskite device shows the best PCE of 13.43% in the reverse scan. With doping of 0.25% MWCNTs into FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y, the perovskite device achieves an improved PCE of 14.76%. In particular, the champion efficiency of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs increases to 16.25%, with a VOC of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 23.50 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.45%, with negligible hysteresis. For the higher MWCNT contents i.e. 0.75% and 1.0%, the photovoltaic performance of perovskite devices decreases to the lower PCEs of 11.77% and 10.37%, respectively.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents were recorded to verify the measurement results of device photovoltaic performance in Fig. 3c.45 The integrated Jsc values from the EQE spectra are 21.93 mA cm−2, 23.21 mA cm−2 and 18.76 mA cm−2 for perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.5% and 1.0%), respectively, which are in good agreement with their counterparts measured from J–V curves. The steady-state efficiencies of the best perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents with maximum power point (MPP) tracking were investigated and are shown in Fig. 3d. The best-performing perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs achieves a steady-state efficiency of 15.93% with a quick optical response ability, which confirms the PCE value from the J–V curves with negligible hysteresis. The perovskite devices without MWCNTs or with 1.0% MWCNTs obtain the steady-state efficiencies of 13.14% and 10.13%, respectively. These values are in agreement with the PCEs obtained from the J–V curves.46,47 Additionally, both of them exhibit a slight light-soaking phenomenon, which demonstrates the small hysteresis of these devices. To further confirm the reproducibility of perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents, more individual devices are fabricated and the distribution statistics of the photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S5† and Table S3.† It is clear that the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite devices with 0.5% MWCNTs show a very narrow distribution, indicating the outstanding device reproducibility.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of C-PSCs and J–V measurements of electron-only perovskite devices were used to study the internal charge transfer and carrier recombination behaviors in C-PSC devices (Fig. 4).48,49 The Nyquist plots of perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents at an applied bias voltage (Vappl) of 0.8 V under AM 1.5G illumination and dark conditions are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The obtained data were fitted by using Z-View software according to a simplified equivalent circuit (Fig. S6a and b†). The horizontal intercept of EIS under AM 1.5G illumination stands for series resistance (Rs), and the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs shows the smallest Rs (see in Fig. 4a). The well-defined semicircles of EIS at different negative bias voltages under dark conditions stands for the recombination resistance (Rrec) (Fig. 4b), and perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs shows the maximum Rrec. Additionally, the variations of Rrec measured under different Vappl are shown in Fig. 4c, which are in agreement with that of Rrec measured under 0.8 V (Fig. 4b). Decreased Rs and increased Rrec signify a better interfacial contact and reduced carrier recombination after the incorporation of MWCNTs (0.5%), resulting in an improved FF and Jsc in the devices.50

The dark J–V measurement was performed to investigate the trap-state density (nTraps) of the charge carriers in the perovskite with different MWCNT contents with the electron-only devices (ITO/C60/perovskite/C60/C) (Fig. 4d and f).49 The electron-only transportation devices were fabricated in terms of the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.51Fig. 4d shows the dark current–voltage curves and fitting curves. Similar shapes of current–voltage curves are observed, which exhibits ohmic behavior at low electric field by following a sharp increase in current at the trap-filled limit. The voltage of trap filled limit (VTFL) of the electron-only devices with different MWCNT contents (W/O, 0.5% and 1.0%) is 0.70, 0.28 and 1.71 V, respectively. By calculation, the nTraps of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs is 5.58 × 1015 cm−3, which is lower than that of the perovskite device without MWCNTs and with 1.0% MWCNTs (1.39 × 1016 cm−3 and 3.41 × 1016 cm−3). The lower nTraps indicates the improved film quality and crystallinity of the perovskite with 0.5% MWCNTs, which could enhance the stability of the perovskite film.49 To understand the origin of the Jsc increment, the J–V curves of electron-only perovskite (with different MWCNT contents) devices with the structure of ITO/C60/perovskite/C60/C were measured to test their electron-extraction behaviors. In Fig. 4e, the J–V curves show that the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs exhibits the highest current density at the same forward bias than the perovskite device without MWCNTs or with 1.0% MWCNTs, indicating a better capability of charge extraction of the perovskite.29 Indeed, MWCNTs partly naked on the surface of perovskite films (Fig. 1b) may connect the perovskite layer with the carbon electrode, and thus construct a 1D charge-transfer channel in the perovskite/C interface.52 As such, the photo-generated holes from the perovskite layer can easily transport along the MWCNTs to the carbon electrode, resulting in improved hole extraction capability.
The film stability of the involved perovskite with different MWCNT contents was investigated by SEM and XRD measurements under ambient laboratory conditions (30–80% humidity) for up to 60 days. SEM images of the as-prepared and air-aged perovskite films are presented in Fig. 1a–c and S7.† Upon exposure to ambient conditions for 60 days, many obvious pin-holes are observed in the pristine perovskite film, and a great number of smaller grains can be observed leading to a rough surface. The variation can be attributed to the degradation of the perovskite, which is verified by the PbI2 peak that appeared in XRD patterns of the pristine perovskite after exposure to ambient conditions for 60 days (Fig. 5). By contrast, no obvious changes can be observed in the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs during 60-day storage, and the film still retains its initial crystal structure together with a compact and well-covered crystal morphology, which indicates its extremely outstanding film stability. When increasing MWCNT content to 1.0% in the perovskite, the perovskite film shows obvious pin-holes, indicating the further degradation of the perovskite. Compared with perovskite films without MWCNTs and with 1.0% MWCNTs, the more outstanding film stability of the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs could be ascribed to the better crystallinity of the perovskite (Fig. 2a) and the larger contact angle with water (Fig. 1h), which help prevent the erosion by moisture and keep the perovskite film stable.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of fresh and air-aged (7, 15, 30 and 60 days) perovskite films with different MWCNT doping contents in air with a relative humidity of 30–80%. Asterisks denote the major reflections of PbI2. 
In order to unravel the possible degradation pathways of perovskite films, XRD patterns of the perovskite with different MWCNT contents as a function of stored time under ambient air conditions are displayed in Fig. 5. The pristine perovskite film remains stable as shown in XRD patterns in the initial 15 day storage in air, and it starts to decompose with the appearance of a slight signal of the PbI2 peak in the 30th day, then the intensity of the PbI2 peak increases from 30 to 60 days. This illustrates the partial degradation of the perovskite film without MWCNTs, consistent with the SEM images. However, the XRD patterns of the perovskite film with 0.5% MWCNTs remain unchanged in air up to 60 days. The result verifies that the introduction of moderate MWCNTs (0.5%) into the perovskite can effectively prevent the decomposition of the perovskite and improve the perovskite film moisture-resistance. In addition, the perovskite film with 1.0% MWCNTs shows a slight signal of PbI2 in the fresh film and gradually decomposes in air from 0 to 60 days.
Furthermore, the device stability of the involved C-PSC devices with different MWCNT contents was investigated under thermal, photo- and ambient conditions (Fig. 6). We firstly performed thermal stability measurements for perovskite devices with different MWCNT contents without encapsulation at 85 °C under dark conditions.53,54 The perovskite devices were continuously heated at 85 °C and their PCEs were periodically examined. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, the pristine perovskite device maintains 85.6% of its initial efficiency after being continuously heated for 200 hours and drops to 57.3% after 500 hours. By doping MWCNTs (0.5%) into the perovskite, the device shows excellent thermal stability, retaining 92.7% of its initial efficiency after being continuously heated for 200 hours and 82.5% after 500 hours. However, the perovskite device with 1.0% MWCNTs shows inferior thermal stability, and its PCE drops sharply to only 22.5% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours, which is inferior in comparison to that of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs. The higher crystallinity of the perovskite (0.5% MWCNT doping) could easily remain stable at a high temperature of 85 °C (Fig. 2a).

(b) Continuous maximum power point (MPP) tracking of C-PSC devices with different MWCNT doping contents under continuous 1 sun illumination in air with a relative humidity of 30–80%. (c) Long-term stability of C-PSC devices with different MWCNT doping contents under ambient conditions. The ambient relative humidity (black curve, left axis) and the room temperature (red curve, right axis) were monitored during the course of the experiments (top). 
Further, we investigated the photo-stability of the C-PSC devices without encapsulation by MPP tracking under continuous 1 sun illumination under air conditions with a relative humidity of 30–80% (Fig. 6b).17 The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs varies slightly from the initial values over the 500 hour test period. During the aging process, the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs still maintains 94.9% of its initial efficiency after 500 hours. In contrast, the pristine perovskite device without MWCNTs shows an inferior photo-stability behavior, and it only retains 23.4% of its initial efficiency under continuous illumination after 200 hours.
Finally, the long-term stability of the C-PSC devices was investigated by storage under actual air conditions at room temperature without encapsulation where the ambient relative humidity and room temperature were monitored during the course of the experiments (Fig. 6c).55 Device efficiency as a function of time for the champion device was periodically recorded. The pristine perovskite device still retains 82.7% of its initial efficiency after being stored in air for up to 10 weeks (70 days), and 18.3% after 18 weeks. By contrast, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs degrades slightly with 92.5% of its peak efficiency after 22 weeks (154 days), which indicates extremely outstanding ambient stability. The stronger crystallinity of the perovskite (Fig. 2a) and the larger contact angle with water (Fig. 1h) could more effectively prevent the erosion by moisture and greatly enhance the device stability of the perovskite device with 0.5% MWCNTs. Worse of all, the perovskite device with 1.0% MWCNTs only retains 20.4% of its initial efficiency after 10 weeks. Note that the C-PSC device with 0.5% MWCNTs achieves a PCE over 16% and the best ambient-air-stable performance for devices fabricated in air so far (Table S4†).20–27
Heretofore, almost all of the previously reported high-efficiency PSCs are mainly demonstrated based on a very small active device area (from 0.03 to 0.15 cm2). It is very essential to examine larger-area devices to further gauge the utility value of a PSC. The outstanding photoelectric performances and cell stability of the MWCNT doped device allow us to further attempt to fabricate a 1 cm2 larger-area device with all processes in air. As shown in Fig. 7, the 1 cm2 carbon-based PSCs with the 0.5% MWCNT doped perovskite achieves a prominent PCE of 12.34%, with a Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 20.48 mA cm−2, and a FF of 59.65% in the reverse scan. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the best performance of HTM-free low-temperature carbon-based PSCs with the device area of 1 cm2.16 Compared to the small-area device, the large-area device shows a slightly increased hysteresis effect and decreased PCE, probably ascribed to the enhanced interface defects from doctor-blading for large-area carbon electrode fabrication,16 which is worth investigating and improving further.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully prepared a stable mixed perovskite film by incorporating MWCNTs into FAxMA1−xPbIyBr3−y to mediate the crystallization of the perovskite and facilitate formation of compact and large-size perovskite films. Besides, hydrophobic MWCNTs exposed on the surface of the perovskite films can also prevent the erosion by moisture of the perovskite films, and enhance the connection between the perovskite layer and carbon electrode. SEM and XRD patterns for 60 days demonstrate the excellent ambient-stability of the 0.5% MWCNT-incorporated perovskite film. Such an air-processed perovskite is incorporated into a stable HTM-free C-PSC with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/C, achieving a high PCE of 16.25% and superior thermal, photo- and ambient stability. Notably, the MWCNT-incorporated C-PSC device exhibits the best ambient-air-stable performance of PSCs fabricated in air so far.
In addition, a large-area MWCNT-incorporated C-PSC device (1 cm2) also reaches a considerable PCE of 12.34%, which is the highest value for low-temperature processing HTM-free C-PSCs. Such PSC devices operated under actual ambient air conditions and the low annealing temperature for every functional layer will accommodate the commercialization requirements of solar cells.
Experimental section
Device fabrication

Materials. 
ITO glass substrates (sheet resistance = 15 Ω cm−2) were purchased from Shenzhen South China Xiang Cheng Science & Technology Company Limited. The SnO2 colloid precursor was purchased from Alfa Aesar (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion). MWCNT dispersion in DMF (7.0 wt%) was purchased from Jiangsu XFNANO Materials Tech Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) was purchased from Aladdin. Isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%) was purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. FAI (99%), MABr (99%) and MAI (99%) were purchased from Dyesol. The carbon paste was purchased from Guangzhou Seaside Technology Co., Ltd.


Device fabrication. 
ITO glass substrates were cleaned by using an ultrasonic method with DI water, acetone and isopropanol for 20 min successively. After drying with nitrogen gas, the ITO glass substrates were exposed to UVO treatment for 20 min in order to improve the surface energy. The SnO2 colloid precursor was diluted using H2O to 2.67%. The dilute SnO2 nanoparticle solution was spin coated onto glass/ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then baked on a hot plate in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min.56 461 mg of PbI2 and 78 mg of DMSO were mixed in 600 mg of N,N-dimethylformamide and stirred for 2 h at room temperature.32 FAI:MABr (60 mg:6 mg) was dissolved in the solvent of IPA (1 mL) with additional 1.0 vol% of DMF; 0.25 vol% MWCNT dispersion and 0.75 vol% of DMF; 0.5 vol% MWCNT dispersion and 0.5 vol% of DMF; 0.75 vol% MWCNT dispersion and 0.25 vol% of DMF; 1.0 vol% MWCNT dispersion to form W/O, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75% and 1.0% MWCNT-doped precursor solutions. The PbI2 precursor solution was spin coated onto the electron transport layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Briefly FAI:MABr precursor solutions were spin coated on top of the PbI2 layer at room temperature at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then were thermally annealed on the hotplate at 140 °C for 10 min. The carbon paste was bladed on the perovskite film directly and baked at 100 °C for 20 min. Note that all device fabrication processes were operated under actual ambient air conditions.

Characterization
The contact angles of water on the perovskite films were measured using a contact angle measurement (OCA 15pro). The AFM height images of perovskite films were obtained with a Bruker Multimode 8 atomic force microscope in tapping mode. The crystalline structure of the perovskite films was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) on a Rigaku D/max-2500 VB2+/PC diffractometer in the 2θ range of 10–60° at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The surface images of perovskite films and the cross-sectional images of the fabricated perovskite solar cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL J-7800F). Photoluminescence spectra (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) were obtained on an Edinburgh Instruments FLS 980 with the range of wavelength from 720 nm to 860 nm by exciting at 470 nm. The optical properties of perovskite films were determined by using the absorption spectra recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/VIS). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement and other electrochemical testing were measured by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium 400147). The EIS measurements were measured by applying a bias of the open-circuit voltage with frequencies ranging from 106 Hz to 1 Hz. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A) with the Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G. The J–V curves were measured in the ambient atmosphere with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using an EQE system (Oriel instruments) with 150 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) as a source of monochromatic light. The photo-stability test at continuous MPP operation under 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G illumination was carried out in the ambient atmosphere by using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium 400147) to fix the voltage at VMPP and then track the current output. The VMPP at the maximum power point was determined from the J–V curve. Remarkably, all film and device characteristics were measured in air.
