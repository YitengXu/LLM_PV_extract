, Accepted 28th September 2016First published on 29th September 2016AbstractCdSe@CdZnS–ZnS multi core–shell quantum dots (MCSQDs) were deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates as well as InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The as synthesized QDs having particle size 6 nm with emission peak at 596 nm. The number of QDs deposited on the substrate increased with prolonged deposition times and applied voltages. Lower voltage (20 V) deposition on FTO glass showed linearity in photoluminescence (PL) peak intensity. The green emitted InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs showed the dual PL emission after EPD of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs. Surface roughness and PL peak intensity nearby 596 nm showed a reverse relationship in QDs deposited InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs.
Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with multiple internal heterostructure are of great interest in the field of light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and biolabeling due to the possibility of tuning the optoelectronic properties by adjusting the QD composition, size or shape.1–6 In addition to this the QDs have better photo-stability than organic light-emitting materials.7 Recently, useful approaches have been developed to improve QD–LED performance. Various structures of QDs, such as the core shell, have been synthesized to improve device performance.8,9 For the synthesis of heterostructure semiconductor QDs there are different methods that have been utilized and a large percentage of them show interesting tunable optical properties due to the quantum confinement effect. This effect is shown by the NPs whose size less than ten nanometer known as QDs. Among the various reported QDs, CdSe QDs are one of the best-characterized semiconductor QDs systems to date, whose optical tuning comes around the visible region of the spectrum. However, CdSe nanoparticles are unstable as they suffer from photo-oxidation when exposed to air and light.10 Bare CdSe nanocrystal (NCs) also suffer from low quantum yield due to the trap states on their surfaces. In order to successfully incorporate the QDs into solid-state structures, a core–shell-type QD is required due to their enhanced PL quantum yields and greater tolerance to the processing conditions necessary for device fabrication. Therefore, the core–shell or MCSQDs have attracted many researchers to make constant efforts to prepare them in more reliable, economical, and environmentally friendly synthetic processes.11 Recently, most effort is devoted to inorganic surface modification using CdS, ZnS or ZnSe shell to improve the PL quantum yields and colloidal stability because the band gap of the CdSe core lies energetically within the band gap of the shell material and the photo generated electrons and holes are mainly confined inside the CdSe.12
Since the first QD–LED was demonstrated,6 there have been numerous effort and progress to improve the device performance by optimizing both the QDs materials and the device architectures.13–17 A number of approaches to fabricate efficient QD–LEDs have been reported, including device structures and the QDs deposition method. There are different methods like spin casting,18,19 inkjet printing,20,21 contact printing,22 are implemented to fabricate the QDs films. Although in the above cases you may get good deposition density however the traditional EPD is more cost effective. The EPD of QDs thin film is occurred by applying a potential difference between two conductive electrodes that are suspended in a colloidal QDs solution. The potential difference between the electrodes causes the film formation by dragging the QDs onto the desired electrodes. The benefit of EPD as a fabricating process is the efficient use of the starting colloidal QDs solutions which cannot be achieved by spin casting; in this case the majority of the used QDs solution is spun off the substrate and is unrecoverable. EPD also allows parallel processing i.e., multiple devices may be fabricated simultaneously in the same EPD bath, and it enables deposition of films onto electrodes of arbitrary size, shape, and texture according to the electrode geometry. In addition, EPD is a slower deposition process with well packed QDs in a more energetically favorable structure on the surface of the substrate.23 Katherine et al.23 did EPD of CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs on ITO/ZnO for LEDs fabrication in acetonitrile and acetone. Zillner et al.24 also used EPD to form a heterojunction of CdTe/CdSe NPs for nanodevices fabrication. Generally CdSe based QDs were drop casted or spin casted on GaN/InGaN MQW LEDs.25–29 So far our knowledge, EPD is first implement here for deposition of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs on InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs. In the present study, the as synthesized CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs in hexane medium were initially deposited on FTO glass and then on InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs with different deposition times by EPD. In addition to this the morphology and PL spectra of the as deposited FTO glass and InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs films were studied and discussed.
Experiment
2.1 Materials
Trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO, 99%), cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99+%), hexadecylamine (HDA, 90%), sulfur (99.998%), oleylamine (OLA, 70%), tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA, 99%, polycarbon), dimethylcadmium (97%), trioctylphosphine (TOP, 97%), selenium (powder, 99.99%), oleic acid (OA, 90%), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%), octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA, 97%, polycarbon), In2Se3 (powder, 99.99%), ethanolamine (EA, 99%), ZnO power (99.9%) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%) which all are from Aldrich, were used as received. Hydrazine (98%, anhydrous, Aldrich) was purified by distillation (1 bar, under nitrogen), then stored and handled inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Analytical grade of reagents like ethanol, hexane, and methyl were used throughout the process.
2.2 Methods
The CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs were synthesized as reported elsewhere.30 In brief 5 mL of ODE and 1 mL of oleyamine was added to 2.617 mL CdSe core solution which was dispersed in anhydrous toluene. The mixture solution was vigorously stirred in vacuum for 1 h at 70 °C to remove dissolved oxygen. After that the flask was filled with N2 gas and heated to 230 °C. When the temperature of the mixture solution reached at 230 °C, the precursors of Cd (1.44 mL Cd oleate), Zn (2.8 mL) and S (4.24 mL TOPS) were injected at the same time and kept for 15 min. This process was repeated thrice for tripled layer. Finally 12.56 mL Zn precursor and 12.5 mL S precursor were added. After coating the final layer the mixture was aged for another 15 min and then resulting solution was cool down rapidly to room temperature in ice water bath.
2.3 Electrophoresis deposition of MCSQDs
A two-electrode local made EPD work station was used for electrophoretic deposition of the colloidal MCSQDs. The schematic for EPD of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs was shown in Fig. 1. A Pt mesh (1 cm × 1 cm) and FTO glass and/or green emitted InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs (1 cm × 1 cm) were used as counter electrode and working electrode respectively. The EPD was carried out by varying the applied voltages from 20 V to 100 V for different time intervals. After EPD the substrates were dried in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h.

2.4 Fabrication of InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs
The InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs structure was epitaxially grown by a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. Trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylindium (TMIn), and NH3 were used as precursors for Ga, In, and N, respectively. A thermal annealing of c-plane sapphire substrate was carried out at 1100 °C for 10 min, followed by the growth of a low temperature GaN buffer layer. After that a thick undoped GaN layer was grown at 1060 °C. Then, five InGaN/GaN MQW regions were grown on high quality GaN epitaxial layer. The GaN barriers and InGaN wells were grown at temperatures of 850 °C and 750 °C, respectively. Finally, a well-controlled thick undoped GaN layer was grown on top as a spacer layer.
2.5 Characterization technique
The surface images of the CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs were examined by TEM (JEM 2010; JEOL). The emission peaks of colloidal QDs were measured by spectrophotometer model Fluoro Max4, Horiba. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi, S-4800) and an atomic force microscope (AFM) were employed to study the morphological images for the films. PL spectra of the film were studied by Cd–He laser source with 325 nm excitation (KIMMON KOHA, IK3252R-E).
Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and optical properties of MCSQDs thin films on FTO glass
Fig. 2 shows the PL and TEM images of the as synthesized CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs. The as synthesized CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs show the PL emission wavelength at 596 nm with particle size of 6 nm. Then the as synthesized CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs were dispersed in hexane for EPD on FTO glass substrate. Fig. 3 shows the QDs thin film morphology formed at 20 V with different time interval starting from 5 min to 30 min on the FTO glass. From the figure it is clearly seen that the number of QDs deposited on FTO glass gradually increased with increasing in deposition time. In case of short deposition time like 5 min and 10 min the FTO surface was not covered fully there was some empty spaces. However after increasing time to 20 min and/or 30 min there was a completely covered and close packed films were found. In general we can say that there was an increasing in deposition amount with increased in deposition times. To further increase the deposition amount the voltages were increased to 40 V and 100 V. The FESEM images of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs films formed at 40 V and 100 V were presented in Fig. 4 and 5 respectively. In these conditions even if at the short deposition times 5 min and 10 min the film is completely covered with CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs. But after increased the deposition time to 20 min and 30 min the deposition amount of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs were drastically increased due to the denser and closely packed film. But in higher voltage and longer deposition time the loading amount is increased. Therefore as deposition times and applied voltage increased, the FTO valley gradually covered with increased loading amount. The optical property was studied by taking the PL spectra of as deposited QDs films. Fig. 6a shows the PL spectra of the QDs films prepared at 20 V. Here we see that the peak intensity gradually increased with deposition time might be due to the close packing of QDs. The PL peak intensity comparison of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs thin films at different applied voltage with various deposition times is given in Fig. 6b. From this figure we see that the PL emission peak at 596 nm which arise from the QDs is gradually increased with increase in deposition time. In addition to this the PL peak intensity also increased with increasing applied voltage. This sharply increase in PL emission is due to the closed packing of the QDs films which also supports the FESEM data. In addition to this we can conclude as follows. There was linearity in PL intensity increment at lower voltage 20 V due to the well-controlled deposition of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs. However with increased voltage at/above 40 V although the deposition amount increased causing increasing in PL intensity but the increment is not linear.

3.2 Morphology and optical properties of MCSQDs thin films on LEDs
The CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs were deposited on green emitted InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs at 100 V with 1 min, 5 min and 10 min deposition time. The PL spectra of the as deposited CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs on green emitted GaN/InGaN MQW LEDs at lower 100 V is given in Fig. 7. From this plot we saw the QDs emission peak intensity near 596 nm is increased with increasing the deposition time from 1 to 5 min. Meanwhile there was a down conversion at the green region of the LEDs. This increase in PL emission peak intensity at orange region and decrease in the green region might be due to the close packing of the QDs films with increasing deposition time. However, the long time deposition (10 min) shows somehow deviation from normal behavior due to the excess loading of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs on green emitted InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs at higher applied voltages. And the down conversion of the MQW peak is due to the energy transfer from the MQWs to the luminescence QDs. The energy-transferring hybrid structure is additionally recombine directly the QDs after the MQWs transfer their excitation energy to the luminophor QDs for the recombination process to directly take place in the QDs. In 10 min deposited hybrid structure LEDs, scattering can also occur due to excess loading amount which leads to decreased PL emission. The surface morphology of the CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs deposited green emitted InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs film was studied by using the AFM images as shown in Fig. 8. From the figure we found that the amount of QDs on the surface increased with increasing deposition time. In the initial stage of deposition there was an aggregation of particles which shows in the figure with increase in surface roughness value to 1.96 nm. However, after increasing deposition time there was more closely packed and smooth QDs film with roughness 0.65 nm were formed. After 5 min deposition the roughness of the QDs films increased from 0.65 nm to 1.26 nm due to the increased in QDs amount and the more closely packed QDs films. In general, the QDs emission peak gradually increased with increasing deposition time, while the 5 min deposition showed some deviation due to the smooth surface of the more uniformed film which was shown by the AFM image with 0.65 nm surface roughness.

Conclusions
The deposition amount and PL peak intensity of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs deposited on FTO substrate is directly proportional to the deposition time and applied voltage. The PL spectra at 20 V showed linearity in PL intensity increment due to the well-controlled loading amount of QDs. The successful deposition of CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs on green emitted GaN based LEDs substrate was achieved. The deposition amount and the CdSe@CdZnS–ZnS MCSQDs emission peak increased with deposition time and applied voltage. However, with longer deposition time showed the intensity drop due to the higher surface roughness value of the deposited film. From these findings, we can propose that EPD is a promising method to deposit QDs on GaN based LEDs for enhancing or tuning the PL properties of LEDs.
