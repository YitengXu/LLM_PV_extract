    , Accepted 7th February 2013First published on 12th February 2013AbstractHerein, we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a well dispersed triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell photocatalyst, which shows enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity due to the plasmonic field of the inner Ag core. The SiO2 interlayer is coated on the Ag core by a sol–gel process to prevent oxidation of Ag and adjusting the plasmonic field. The Ag@SiO2@TiO2 nanoparticles with systematic variation of the SiO2 interlayer thickness of 2, 4, 8, 20 nm and TiO2 shell thickness of 2, 10, 20, 40 nm are prepared. The enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency increases with decreased SiO2 thickness. Nanoparticles with a 2 nm SiO2 interlayer and a 20 nm TiO2 shell exhibited the best photocatalytic performance, ca. 31 times larger in photocatalytic activity and ca. 38 times larger in photocurrent density than P25 under visible light. A brief mechanism relating the plasmon resonance energy transfer from Ag to TiO2 and scattering is proposed. Such an intriguing photocatalyst may find significant applications in various fields.
1 Introduction
Semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been widely used in the field of environmental applications due to their excellent properties.1–6 Such photocatalysts needs to exhibit small bandgap, short minority carrier distance, low e−/h+ pair recombination, and high photo to e−/h+ pair conversion efficiency.7 Owing to its nontoxicity, chemical stability and low-cost, TiO2 is considered to be one of the suitable materials for air and water remediation.8 However, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 is restricted to the ultraviolet light region due to its large bandgap (∼3.2 eV), only ∼4% of solar photons can be used. Furthermore, TiO2 suffers from considerable recombination of photogenerated e−/h+ pairs.9 Several attempts have been made to obtain visible-light-active TiO2, such as doping with metal ions or nonmetal elements to engineer the bandgap,10–12 addition of dyes, quantum dots or metallic oxide for better light sensitization.13–15 Research in the composites of TiO2 with noble metals also has been actively pursued.
It has been shown recently that metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au, Ag or Pt, embedded in the matrix of TiO2 can enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible light irradiation.16–18 According to these previous works, three primary mechanisms have been discussed. One point of view thinks that photoexcited metal due to plasmon resonance can inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 upon excitation. However, the band energies for e−/h+ are very different for the metal–semiconductor interface and there are no rigorous models for this process.19,20 Another mechanism is based on the interaction of TiO2 with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced electromagnetic fields (near field effect), which causes plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) from metal NPs to TiO2.21,22 The third mechanism is based on efficient scattering mediated by LSPR (far field effect), which leads to longer optical path lengths for photons in TiO2 that boost the excitation of e−/h+ pairs.7 Among these metals, Ag NPs are the ideal metal for showing intense surface plasmons at the desired wavelength (320–450 nm), which is close to the absorption bandgap of TiO2 (∼3.2 eV, 388 nm).23 Several works decorated Ag NPs on the surface of TiO2, but this architecture would lead to the reduction of reactive surface sites available for catalysis.24,25 So loading Ag NPs inside the TiO2 is needed. However, the absorption coefficient of TiO2 is 90 cm−1, and the refractive index of TiO2 is 2.19 at the wavelength of 380 nm, so a thick TiO2 shell may be opaque and Ag NPs inside the TiO2 shell would not be efficient.25 Therefore it is necessary to optimize the TiO2 shell thickness. Similar ideas about Ag@TiO2 core–shell NPs were already outlined in the past.26,27 For example the photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO2 clusters was compared with TiO2 colloids by carrying out the reduction of C60 under 308 nm laser pulse excitation. The expected higher catalytic activity for the Ag@TiO2 clusters could not be confirmed. The experimental results showed an opposite trend. This is mainly because the Ag NPs are chemically reactive, and would form a ∼10 nm AgO layer at the interface of TiO2–Ag at room temperature.28 Furthermore, the surface plasmons of Ag NPs are sensitive to the surrounding medium. Therefore, Ag NPs have to be coated with passive, insulating, and optically transparent material, (such as SiO2). It should be mentioned that loading a SiO2 interlayer between Ag and TiO2 can also minimize the damping when a metal is placed in direct contact with a semiconductor.29,30 However, the local electric field amplitude decays with the distance from the surface of Ag NPs. So the thickness of SiO2 should be very thin. Such plasmonic enhanced photocatalysts in a structure consisting of TiO2 over SiO2 covered Ag NPs have been outlined before.7,28 But these works were depositing TiO2 on substrate, which led to a decreased reactive surface area.
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a highly visible-light efficient, stable, and well dispersed TiO2-based plasmonic photocatalyst. This as-prepared nanoparticle photocatalyst has a silver core, SiO2 interlayer, and TiO2 shell with controllable interlayer and shell thickness. These photocatalysts with a unique multicomponent nanostructure, designated Ag@SiO2@TiO2 (as shown in Fig. 1), are fabricated by the conformal coating Ag NPs with SiO2 by a sol–gel process, and then the Ag@SiO2 NPs are modified by 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), followed by coating with a layer of amorphous TiO2 by hydrolyzing titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) in ethanol solution. Finally, the sample is calcined at 450 °C in air. These new photocatalysts are active for the degradation reactions of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Interestingly, such composite structures could pave the way for designing novel light harvesting systems.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and indium tin oxide coated glass (ITO, surface resistivity 15 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Co. Silver nitrate (AgNO3), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 40000), methylene blue trihydrate (MB), aqueous ammonia and ethylene glycol were of analytical grade and purchased from Shanghai Chemical Corp. All chemicals were used as received. Ultrapure water (18 MΩ cm−1) was used for all experiments.
2.2 Synthesis of Ag NPs
Ag NPs with an average size of ∼60 nm were synthesized using the method introduced by Xia et al.31 In a typical synthesis, 0.5 g of AgNO3 and 2.5 g of PVP (MW = 40000) were dissolved in 200 mL of ethylene glycol. This mixture was then heated to 130 °C in 20 minutes under vigorous stirring. Then, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 130 °C for 1 h without further stirring. The Ag NPs were easily separated from the ethylene glycol by addition of 800 mL of acetone, followed by sonication and centrifugation. The precipitates were redispersed in 10 mL of ethanol to obtain the 0.02 g mL−1 of Ag NPs/ethanol solution.
2.3 Synthesis of Ag@SiO2 core–shell NPs
The Ag@SiO2 core–shell NPs with different silica thickness were formed following a protocol described elsewhere.31 In a typical synthesis of Ag@SiO2 (2 nm thickness of SiO2), 5 mL of Ag NPs/ethanol solution (0.02 g mL−1) obtained above was dissolved in 80 mL ethanol and stirred for 30 min at 600 rpm at room temperature, 20 mL deionized water and 1.2 mL ammonia aqueous solution (28 wt%) were added to the mixture. Then 15 μL TEOS previously dissolved in 5 mL ethanol, was introduced drop by drop with continuous stirring, and the reaction was continued for 12 h. The Ag@SiO2 core–shell NPs were washed with deionized water and ethanol for 3 times and redispersed in 10 mL of ethanol. The thickness of the silica coating layer could be increased to some extent by increasing the TEOS concentration.
2.4 Synthesis of triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs
The triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs with different TiO2 shell thickness were prepared via a modified method reported elsewhere.32 In a typical synthesis of Ag@SiO2@TiO2 (with 2 nm thickness of SiO2 and 20 nm TiO2), 10 mL of Ag@SiO2 core–shell NPs/ethanol solution obtained above was dispersed in 50 mL of ethanol and 100 μL of APTMS, and the mixture was refluxed at 85 °C for 4 h. The resultant APTMS modified Ag@SiO2 beads were washed with ethanol for 3 times and redispersed in 100 mL of ethanol. 100 μL of TTIP previously dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol was added dropwise to the Ag@SiO2 dispersion under stirring, followed by refluxing at 80 °C for 2 h. The Ag@SiO2@TiO2 triplex core–shell NPs were centrifuged, washed with water, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum for one night. Finally, the resulting powders were calcined at 450 °C in air for 2 h to remove the organic species and improve crystallinity. The thickness of the TiO2 shell could be adjusted with changing the TTIP concentration. For example, a TiO2 coating layer with a thickness of ∼10 nm was obtained using a procedure similar to the above adjusting the TTIP concentration to 50 μL.
2.5 Characterization
To demonstrate the overall uniformity and morphology of the particles, the samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL 2011 microscope (Japan). The crystalline structure was investigated by X-ray power diffraction (RIGAK, D/MAX 2550 VB/PC, Japan). The UV-vis spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrometer (UNICO UV-2012PC) at 25 °C.
2.6 Photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity tests
Photo-electrochemical analyses were carried out using a standard three-electrode cell with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared by deposition of a sample slurry on ITO glass (1 cm × 1 cm). An aqueous Na2SO4 (0.1 M) solution was used as the electrolyte. Chronoamperometry (CA) tests were carried out with a CHI 660C workstation and a 150 W high-pressure Xenon lamp with a cutoff filter (400 nm).
Photocatalytic reactions for the degradation of organic dye were carried out in a 250 mL quartz beaker, containing 150 mL of reaction slurry. Agitation was provided by mechanical stirring. The aqueous slurry, prepared with 50 mg different kinds of catalysts and 2.0 × 10−5 M MB was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure that the dye was adsorbed to saturation on the catalysts. For the visible-light irradiation experiment, a 150 W high-pressure Xenon lamp was used as the light source, which was placed 10 cm away from the reaction vessel and the illumination intensity was 50 mW cm−2. A cutoff filter was used to block the UV light (<400 nm). The photocatalytic reaction was started by turning on the Xenon lamp. 3 mL of the mixed suspension was extracted at various irradiation times and centrifuged to remove the photocatalyst. The concentration of residual MB in the upper clear layer was determined by recording the maximum absorbance of MB at 654 nm with a UV-vis spectrophotometer.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs
In order to study the effect of SiO2 interlayer thickness on the photocatalytic activity of the as prepared plasmonic photocatalyst, we prepared triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs with different SiO2 thickness and a unified TiO2 shell thickness of 20 nm, (as shown in Table 1). On the other hand, we synthesized triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs with a unified 2 nm SiO2 interlayer and different TiO2 shell thickness to study the effect of TiO2 shell thickness on the photocatalytic activity of the as prepared NPs.

Typical TEM images of Ag@SiO2 NPs synthesized by the sol–gel method are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2a and b show images of the well-dispersed core@shell type Ag@SiO2 NPs, with uniform 2 nm SiO2 shell thickness. In a general way, a thinner silica interlayer (<5 nm) is difficult to prepare. The thin silica spacer with a thickness of 2 nm has been successfully synthesized using a modified method introduced by Zhao et al.31 The key to synthesize a uniform thin SiO2 interlayer is adding diluted TEOS solution (previously dissolved in 5 mL ethanol) very slowly under optimized temperature (25 °C). The silica spacer interlayer can be controlled from 2 to 20 nm by gradually changing the silica precursor concentration. SiO2 interlayers of 2, 4 and 8 nm are shown in Fig. 2c–f.

As shown in Fig. 3, well-dispersed Ag@SiO2@TiO2 triplex core–shell NPs were obtained. The uniform TiO2 shells with thickness from 2 to 40 nm are coated onto Ag@SiO2 beads by modifying the surface of SiO2 using APTMS, and coating a layer of amorphous TiO2via hydrolyzing TTIP in ethanol solution. The amine functional groups on the surface of SiO2 beads aid the formation of a uniform thin layer of TiO2 on SiO2 without any aggregation.32 However, it is hard to distinguish between the SiO2 interlayer and the TiO2 shell in the TEM images, so the thickness of the SiO2 interlayer in these samples is 2 nm, and the TiO2 shell is calculated by subtracting the SiO2 interlayer thickness from the outer shell thickness. The TiO2 shell thickness can be increased by adjusting TTIP concentration. TiO2 shells with thickness of 10 and 20 nm are shown in Fig. 3a–f. Fig. 3g shows a SEM image of the as prepared triplex core–shell NPs after annealing at 450 °C, it can be seen that the Ag@SiO2@TiO2 triplex NPs maintain their dispersion after annealing. Fig. 3h shows the particle size distribution of Ag@SiO2(2 nm)@TiO2(20 nm) NPs. The inset shows the size distribution of Ag NPs. The average particle size of Ag NPs is about 60 nm, and it increased to about 80 nm after coating 2 nm SiO2 interlayer and 20 nm TiO2 shell.

The characteristic broad diffraction peaks index to the Ag NPs and anatase TiO2, which imply that the current system is suitable for the purpose. And the diffraction peak intensity of anatase TiO2 is weaker than Ag NPs, indicating the low concentration of TiO2.

Fig. 5a and c show the UV-vis absorption spectra, the samples were dispersed in water, the particle concentration is estimated by assuming a uniform distribution of Ag core particles and an average particle size of 60 nm as obtained from Fig. 2a, the average number of particles in these samples is estimated to be 8.4 × 1011 mL−1. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Ag NPs exhibit a strong and sharp LSPR at wavelengths around 429 nm, which is consistent with other reports.33 As discussed above, the LSPR wavelength depends on the shape and dielectric environment of the NPs. After coating with either TiO2 or SiO2@TiO2, the LSPR wavelength is red-shifted. For the 20 nm TiO2 shell without an SiO2 interlayer, a red shift of ∼70 nm is observed. This is in good approximation with the wavelength where the dielectric function of TiO2 fulfills the excitation condition for the LSPR in the dipole limit.28 With 2 nm SiO2 interlayer, a smaller shift of only 15 nm was observed. A more detail examination of the LSPR shift versus SiO2 interlayer thickness is shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that by increasing the SiO2 interlayer thickness, the LSPR wavelength is blue-shifted, and shifted down to approximately 435 nm in the case of a 20 nm thick SiO2 interlayer. Such a tuning of the LSPR by the SiO2 is actually beneficial for the energy coupling during the TiO2 plasmonic catalysis since the tuned LSPR wavelength is now closer to the energy bandgap of TiO2.7 Furthermore, the LSPR intensity decreases largely without a SiO2 interlayer, which is attributed to the oxidation of the Ag NPs when it direct contact with TiO2. Therefore, coating with a thin SiO2 interlayer cannot only tune the LSPR peak to the desired wavelength, but also preserve the stability of the Ag NPs. As discussed above, the presence of an insulating, optically transparent SiO2 interlayer between metal and semiconductor is crucial to minimize the damping that can occur when a metal is placed in direct contact with a semiconductor. This can be the other reason for the decreased LSPR intensity when direct coating TiO2 on Ag core without a SiO2 interlayer.

(b) LSPR wavelength versus SiO2 interlayer thickness showing a subdued red shift upon the increase of the SiO2 interlayer thickness. (c) UV-vis absorption spectra of the Ag@SiO2@TiO2 triplex core–shell NPs with different TiO2 shell thickness. (d) Normalized LSPR intensity versus TiO2 shell thickness showing the decreased LSPR intensity upon increase of the TiO2 shell. The error bars represent standard deviation from three replicas for each measurement. 
As shown in Fig. 5c, after coating with SiO2 and TiO2 layers, the LSPR intensity becomes weaker. This is mainly attributed to the high absorption coefficient and refractive index of TiO2. The thick TiO2 shells are opaque like a mirror so that the Ag NPs inside the particles are not efficient.34Fig. 5d shows the linear relationship between the shell thickness and LSPR intensity, the LSPR intensity decreases to only 40% in the case of a 40 nm thick TiO2 shell. In addition, no obvious absorption peak of TiO2 is found when the TiO2 shell thickness is less than 10 nm, which is mainly due to the low concentration of TiO2.
3.2 Photocatalytic activities of the triplex Ag@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell NPs
The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the dye's characteristic absorption band at 654 nm to measure the degradation rate of MB under visible light irradiation. Fig. 6a and d show the concentration change of the aqueous MB solution versus irradiation time. As can be seen, the Ag@SiO2@TiO2(20 nm) NPs with systematic variation of SiO2 interlayer thickness of 2, 4, 8, 20 nm show a systematic increase in photocatalytic efficiency with a decreased SiO2 thickness. When coating Ag with 2 nm SiO2 and different thickness of TiO2 shell, the 20 nm TiO2 shell exhibits the best photocatalytic performance.

(d) Photocatalytic degradation study of MB, (e) ln(C0/C) versus time line, and (f) photocurrent study on Ag@SiO2(2 nm)@TiO2 with different TiO2 shell thickness. The error bars represent standard deviation from three replicas for each measurement. 
Most of the photocatalytic reactions follow the Langmuir–Hinshelwood adsorption model, and the L–H model can be simplified to a pseudo-first-order expression: ln(C0/C) = kt (where C0 and C are the initial concentration and the concentration of MB at the exposure time, t, respectively, and k is the linear plots of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time t) (as shown in Fig. 6b and e).35,36Table 2 summarizes the calculated k and the corresponding correlation coefficient (R) values. As can be seen in Table 1, the photocatalytic reaction rate of Ag@SiO2(2 nm)@TiO2(20 nm) is ca. 4 times larger than Ag@TiO2(20 nm) and ca. 31 times than P25.

Chronoamperometry (CA) measurements were performed to characterize the photogenerated current density under the potential of 0.2 V and periodic illumination of visible-light (λ > 400 nm). As indicated in Fig. 6c and f, the Ag@SiO2@TiO2(20 nm) NPs with a systematic variation of SiO2 interlayer thickness of 2, 4, 8 and 20 nm show a systematic increase in photocurrent density with a decreased SiO2 thickness, the Ag@SiO2(2 nm)@TiO2(20 nm) exhibits a much higher photocurrent density (ca. 0.42 μA cm−2), which is in accord with the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst with a 2 nm SiO2 interlayer and 20 nm TiO2 shell showed the highest photocurrent density and photocatalytic activity, which indicated that both the insulating layer and photocatalytic shell were relatively appropriate.
3.3 Enhancement mechanism
As shown in Fig. 7, pure TiO2 (such as P25), is known to possess low photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The improvement of the catalytic performance is evident for all samples have Ag cores. This is mainly attributed to the plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) and scattering induced by Ag NPs.
 Fig. 7  Mechanism of the photodegradation process of (a) pure TiO2, (b) Ag@TiO2 and (c) Ag@SiO2@TiO2 during the irradiation of visible light. 
The transfer of energy from a plasmon to a nearby absorber such as a semiconductor, has been called plasmon resonance energy transfer.37 The effect of PRET is to enhance the electric field intensity in a small, well-defined location of the semiconductor, thereby increasing the power absorbed in this region. This process results in the rapid formation of e−/h+ pairs in the semiconductor. With an applied electric field, such as light, the conduction electrons in metal NPs act as a harmonic oscillator, the resonating electrons of Ag NPs establish an oscillating electric field E, at a shorter distances d (where d measures the distance from the surface of the NP), the decay of the electric field intensity is 1/d4.7 For spherical Ag NPs of size 60 nm, the characteristic decaying length is only ∼20 nm.38 This suggests that PRET should be greatest in the part of the semiconductor that is the closet to Ag. However, energy transfer from Ag to TiO2 occurs through coupling of the LSPR of Ag NPs with the bandgap of TiO2, this highlights one of advantages of using SiO2 coated Ag NPs which can tune the LSPR to the desired wavelength. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, without the SiO2 interlayer, the LSPR is centered at 497 nm while it shifts to 447 nm with a 2 nm SiO2 interlayer. The resonance wavelength undergoes a gradual blue shift with a progressively increased SiO2 interlayer thickness, and arrives at a wavelength of approximately 435 nm in the case of a 20 nm thick SiO2 interlayer. It should be mentioned that the optimal distance between a semiconductor and a plasmonic nanostructure is also affected by Foster energy transfer from the semiconductor to the metal. Herein, the SiO2 interlayer represents a buffer that keeps the TiO2 and Ag at a finite distance from each other without physically touching, providing an environment where the negative effect of the Foster energy transfer is diminished.34 To demonstrate the effect of SiO2 interlayer thickness on the photocatalytic activity of composites, photocatalytic degradation of MB under visible light was carried out and shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the 2 nm SiO2 interlayer exhibits the best photocatalytic activity, the rate constant is 0.0186, ca. 31 times larger than P25, the enhancement is mainly attribute to the PRET from Ag NPs to TiO2. Though the LSPR peak undergoes a gradual blue shift with a increased SiO2 interlayer, the photocatalytic activity decreases with an increased SiO2 interlayer thickness. Without an SiO2 interlayer, the photocatalytic activity is relatively weak, this is mainly because the red-shifted LSPR due to the dielectric function of TiO2 fulfilling the excitation condition for the LSPR in the dipole limit, the weakened LSPR due to the oxidation of the Ag NPs, and the Foster energy transfer due to the direct contact between the two nanostructures. The PRET effects are further confirmed from the photocurrent measurements as shown in Fig. 6c. The highest photocurrent of 0.42 μA cm−2 is obtained in the sample with a 2 nm interlayer. The photocurrents observed for the 4, 8 and 20 nm SiO2 interlayer samples are 0.41, 0.34 and 0.09 μA cm−2. This clearly suggests that PRET results in the rapid formation of e−/h+ pairs in the TiO2.
The thick TiO2 shell is opaque due to its high absorption coefficient and refractive index. Ag NPs inside the particles would not be efficient. So the rate of PRET is also affected by the thickness of the TiO2 shell. This suggests that the TiO2 shell should be very thin. However, a thin TiO2 shell can't generate enough e−/h+. In this context, we prepared samples with a unified 2 nm SiO2 interlayer and different thickness of 2, 10, 20, 40 nm TiO2 shell. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the intensity of LSPR decreases with an increased TiO2 shell, it decreases to only 40% in the case of a 40 nm TiO2 shell. It can be seen in Fig. 6d–f that the highest photocatalytic activity is obtained in the sample with a 20 nm TiO2 shell, the rate constant is 0.0186 and the photocurrent density is 0.42 μA cm−2. The photocatalytic activity of the sample with a 2 nm TiO2 shell is weak, the rate constant and photocurrent density are only 0.0021 and 0.072 μA cm−2 respectively, indicating that an ultrathin TiO2 shell is not practical. The TiO2 shells thicker than 20 nm show a decreased photocatalytic efficiency and photocurrent density.
However, the rate constant and photocurrent density of Ag@SiO2(20 nm)@TiO2(20 nm) are 0.0029 and 0.092 μA cm−2, ca. 6 and 9 times larger than P25. For spherical Ag NPs of size 60 nm, the characteristic decaying length is only ∼20 nm. This clearly suggests that the PRET effects are not the only factor in the photocatalytic efficiency enhancement.
Scattering provides a second mechanism to the enhancement of the as prepared samples. For large Ag nanostructures (characteristic length above ∼40 nm), the extinction by the Ag@SiO2@TiO2 composites is a superposition of the direct absorption by pure TiO2 (leading to e−/h+) and mainly scattering from the Ag structures. Here, Ag would essentially be acting as a mirror, some resonant photons that are not absorbed by pure TiO2 upon their first pass through the composite material could be scattered by Ag, effectively giving those photons multiple passes through the system. This mechanism results in the prolonged optical path of the scattered photons, which leads to an increase in the concentration of e−/h+ pairs. This could be a reason for the good photocatalytic properties of the sample with 20 nm SiO2.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized well-dispersed Ag@SiO2@TiO2 triplex core–shell photocatalysts with a uniform SiO2 interlayer and TiO2 shell, which show high efficiency in catalyzing the decomposition of organic compounds under illumination of visible-light. We have investigated the optimum SiO2 interlayer and TiO2 shell thickness to induce maximum photocatalytic efficiency. The SiO2 interlayer due to its stability and lower refractive index facilitates enhanced photocatalytic activity because of blue shift in the LSPR, which benefits efficient PRET from Ag NPs to TiO2. Scattering is the other reason for the enhanced photocatalytic activity, which increases the optical path length of the photons in TiO2 and hence results in an enhanced e−/h+ pair creation. Additionally, these triplex core–shell plasmonic photocatalysts can be extended to applications in other fields such as dye decoloration, water decomposition, hydrogen generation, solar cells, and so on.
