    , Accepted 21st December 2018First published on 21st December 2018AbstractWe report on a simple and facile synthetic approach for preparing both a CuBi2O4 photocathode and BiVO4 photoanode from a single Bi4O5I2 nanosheet template. A nanosheet structured Bi4O5I2 (nanoBi4O5I2) template, solvothermally deposited on a conducting glass substrate, can be converted to a textured CuBi2O4 photocathode and a BiVO4 photoanode with coral-like nanostructure by drop-casting a copper ion-containing and a vanadium ion-containing solution, respectively, with a follow-up heat treatment. UV-vis absorption spectra and Mott–Schottky analyses confirm CuBi2O4 and BiVO4 have well-suited band gaps for absorbing a large portion of visible light and complementary band structures for proton reduction and water oxidation, respectively. A photoelectrochemical tandem cell, consisting of a cobalt based catalyst modified CuBi2O4 photocathode and a cobalt based catalyst modified BiVO4 photoanode shows promising photoelectrochemical properties towards water splitting, and can be operated without an external bias. Factors limiting the performance of the tandem cell are also discussed.
1 Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising approach for providing clean and sustainable H2 fuels from sunlight and water. Among various device configurations, a dual-photoelectrode tandem PEC cell that consists of one photoanode and one photocathode is especially attractive as it has a maximal solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 20–30%,1 outperforming the profitable STH efficiency of 15–20%.2
Immense efforts therefore have been devoted to the optimization of the individual performances of photoanodes and/or photocathodes for PEC water oxidation and PEC proton reduction, respectively. For example, BiVO4 is a state-of-the-art photoanode, which has a band gap of 2.4–2.5 eV and a suitable valence band edge, capable of using visible light to drive water oxidation.3 A photocurrent of 6.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under one sun illumination, close to 80% of its theoretical value of 7.6 mA cm−2, was recently achieved by orientation control and facet engineering.3c Stability is another important factor for assessing the performance of a photoelectrode. By tuning the electrolyte compositions or modification with a protection layer and/or co-catalyst, the photocorrosion issue of BiVO4 can be efficiently alleviated.4 A long-term stability of over 1000 h in a neutral pH solution has been successfully demonstrated for BiVO4.5 Essential progress have also been made for Cu2O6 and hematite.7
Although the immense progress on optimizing the performance of individual photoelectrodes have been made, there is relatively limited research on an integrated PEC cell for overall solar water splitting and the efficiency is still far below the theoretical value and practical applications.6a,8 Examples include Cu2O paired with WO3,6a p-Si paired with BiVO4,8b an amorphous Si paired with hematite,8e Cu2O paired with BiVO4,8a CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2 paired with BiVO4,9 and CuBi2O4 paired with BiVO4.10 However, the majority employ arduous and expensive techniques, such as atomic layer deposition and expensive materials and/or catalysts, such as In and Pt. Bottlenecks also arise from complex procedures for preparing photoelectrodes, their incompatibility under device operating conditions, and poor stability of photoelectrodes. Developing simple and facile methods for simultaneously preparing efficient and compatible photoanodes and photocathodes is therefore beneficial for accelerating the progress on dual-photoelectrode tandem PEC cells.
In this discussion, we report on a novel method with simplicity and general applicability for preparing both the photoanode and photocathode from a single template by a solution based conversion method. A nanosheet structured Bi4O5I2 (nanoBi4O5I2) is first synthesized on a conducting glass substrate by a facile solvothermal method, followed by its conversion into micro-textured CuBi2O4 (microCuBi2O4) and nanocoral structured BiVO4 (nanoBiVO4) by drop-casting of a solution containing Cu2+ and VO2+, respectively, and subsequent heat treatments. CuBi2O4 is a recently emerged photocathode material as it has a well-suited conduction band edge to drive proton reduction and a narrow band gap of 1.5–1.8 eV,8d,11 yielding a theoretical photocurrent of over 17 mA cm−2.12 A theoretical efficiency of approximately 8% based on the band gaps and minimum reasonable losses is achievable for pairing CuBi2O4 with BiVO4,13 which is promising for an all earth-abundant dual-photoelectrode tandem PEC cell. However, research on using CuBi2O4 as a photocathode in a PEC tandem cell for solar water splitting is still limited.8d,10 Common CuBi2O4 electrode preparation methods include drop-casting a precursor solution onto a conductive substrate followed by heat treatments8d,11a,11d and electrodeposition of a CuO–BixOy film followed by conversion to CuBi2O4 by heating.11b,11c,11e CuBi2O4 also has a very positive valence band edge to provide sufficient internal photovoltage in a tandem PEC cell when paired with a photoanode such as BiVO4.
A tandem PEC cell consisting of a CuBi2O4 based photocathode and a BiVO4 based photoanode was thereby studied for overall water splitting under solar light irradiation (Scheme 1). Factors affecting the cell performance with respect to the optical properties, charge carrier separation, and surface catalytic properties of individual photoelectrodes are discussed.

A near neutral borate buffer solution was used as the electrolyte, whereas a proton exchange membrane was employed between the photocathodes and photoanodes for suppressing the product crossover. 
2 Experimental section
Preparation of electrodes
For the growth of nanoBi4O5I2 on FTO, a solution for the solvothermal process was prepared by mixing a diethylene glycol (DEG, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) solution containing 0.05 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and a methanol (Aencore, 99.9%) solution containing 0.05 M KI (Sigma-Aldrich, ≧99.5%). Subsequently, 16 mL of the precursor solution was put in a 23 mL autoclave. A fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate (Pilkington TEC Glass™ 7) was immersed into the precursor solution with FTO facing downward in the autoclave. The autoclave was then sealed and heated at 160 °C for 4 h. Bismuth alkoxide is possibly first formed followed by the gradual formation of BiO+ after the dissolution of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O in the polyol solvent of DEG. BiO+ and I− ions then nucleated on the FTO substrate followed by subsequent primary particle formation and aggregation and finally Ostwald ripening to from sheet structures in the presence of polyols.14 Polyols are generally considered as a soft template for directing assembly of sheet structures through the long chain as well as the cross-linking networks by hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups. After growth of Bi4O5I2 nanosheets, the resultant pale yellow colored electrodes were rinsed with water and dried in air at room temperature (RT).
The as-prepared nanoBi4O5I2 was subsequently used as the template for the syntheses of microCuBi2O4 and nanoBiVO4 by drop-casting of copper(II) acetate hydrate (0.01 M, based on the molecular mass of anhydrous copper(II) acetate, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in methanol and vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, 0.2 M, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In the case of microCuBi2O4, the electrodes after drop-casting were placed flat in a vacuum chamber at RT to accelerate the evaporation of the solvent prior to heat treatment at 550 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1. A brown microCuBi2O4 electrode with high uniformity was then obtained (Scheme 2). In the case of nanoBiVO4, the electrodes after drop-casting were heat-treated at 450 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1 followed by soaking in a NaOH solution (1 M) to remove excess V2O5 and rinsing with water to obtain a bright yellow nanoBiVO4 (Scheme 2).

Co–Bi modified photoelectrodes, including microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi and nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi were prepared by a photo-assisted deposition method at 0.3 V vs. RHE under solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) for 150 seconds. The deposition electrolyte is a borate (Bi) buffer solution (pH 9.2) containing 0.5 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O as the Co2+ sources.
Physical characterisation
The surface morphologies of the electrodes were characterized by using a JEOL-6330 Field-Emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) analyses were carried out using a multi-function high power X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8). UV-vis absorption spectra of the photoelectrodes were recorded by a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 60) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory.
Electrochemical and PEC measurements
All the electrochemical and PEC measurements were recorded with a Metrohm Autolab (PGSTAT 302N) using a two-chamber electrochemical cell separated with a proton exchange membrane (PEM, Nafion 117™). The PEM shows high transmittance, up to 90% in the wavelength ranges of 300–800 nm (Fig. S1†). The geometric surface areas of all the photoelectrodes were defined using a polyester tape (0.5 cm2) for electrochemical and PEC analyses, whereas the precise geometric area was determined after the analyses.
For three-electrode measurements, an Ag/AgCl/KClsat was used as the reference electrode and placed in the same chamber with a working electrode, whereas a Pt foil was used as the counter electrode and placed in another chamber. All the measurements were carried out in a Bi buffer solution (pH 9.2) containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 as a supporting electrolyte unless otherwise noted and all the potentials were converted to RHE by using E (V vs. RHE) = E (V vs. Ag/AgCl/KClsat) + 0.197 + 0.059 × pH. Mott–Schottky analyses were carried out in the same three-electrode configuration in the same electrolyte at a frequency of 500 Hz or 1 kHz.
Tandem PEC cell studies were carried out in a two-chamber cell separated with a PEM. A nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi photoanode was used as the front electrode and a microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi photocathode was used as the back electrode in the same light path. The distance between the two photoelectrodes is approximate 8 cm. A solar light simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XES-40S2-CE, AAA class) equipped with air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) filter was used as the light source and the illumination intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by a monocrystalline silicon solar cell.
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were performed to quantify the increased resistance incurred in moving the working electrode to a tandem (two-electrode) system. For the three-electrode measurements, the solution resistance was typically in the range 20–30 Ω, whereas the solution and membrane resistance in the two-electrode measurement (tandem device) was approximate 80 Ω in a Bi buffer solution (pH 9.2) containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.
3 Results and discussion
NanoBi4O5I2
Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, X = Cl, Br, I)14,15 and bismuth-rich oxyhalides (BixOyXz)16 are promising photocatalysts for pollutant degradation as they have narrow band gaps to utilise visible light in solar spectrum. In particular, their structures are easily controlled to form sheets, flowers, or hollow spheres on the nanoscale due to their layered structure of [Bi–O] slabs placed in between two slabs of halogen ions.16a Previously, nanosheet structured BiOI was electrodeposited on a conducting substrate and used as a template for preparing a nanoporous BiVO4 electrode for PEC water oxidation3a and a CuO decorated CuBi2O4 electrode for electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose.17 Beyond the electrodeposition, developing an alternative facile method to prepare nanostructured BiOX or BixOyXz electrodes is desirable for the general applicability of the preparation of photoelectrodes from similar solution based conversion methods.
In this discussion, uniform Bi4O5I2 nanosheets were synthesized on a FTO substrate by a one-step solvothermal method. The precursor solution was prepared by mixing a DEG solution containing Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and a methanol solution containing KI (see Experimental for details). The crystal structure of nanoBi4O5I2 was characterized by GI-XRD (Fig. 1a). Except for the signals rising from the FTO substrate, all signals belong to monoclinic Bi4O5I2.16b The SEM images show that the FTO substrate was uniformly covered by nanoBi4O5I2 with a sheet thickness of approximately 25 nm (Fig. 1b and S2a, ESI†). UV-vis spectroscopy shows that nanoBi4O5I2 absorbs light below 550 nm, and the corresponding Tauc plot suggests nanoBi4O5I2 has a band gap of approximately 2.0 eV, close to the reported value of 2.18 eV (Fig. 1c and d).16b However, nanoBi4O5I2 shows a negligible photocurrent under simulated solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G, Fig. S2b, ESI†).

MicroCuBi2O4
Subsequently, nanoBi4O5I2 was used as a template for the preparation of micro-textured CuBi2O4. The CuBi2O4 photocathode was prepared by drop-casting of a precursor solution containing Cu2+ onto nanoBi4O5I2 followed by heat treatments. The drop-casting amount (D) and the heat treatment temperature (T) have significant effects on the compositions and morphologies of prepared CuBi2O4 (Fig. 2). The CuBi2O4 retains the main structure of the nanoBi4O5I2 template and has a porous nanosheet morphology if T = 450 °C, whereas the nanosheets start to merge at higher temperature and finally become a textured structure at T = 550 °C (Fig. 2a–c). Heat treatment temperature over T = 600 °C results in poor reproducibility of the morphologies and performance, and therefore the discussion at this condition is excluded.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the CuBi2O4 converted from nanoBi4O5I2 with D = 50 μL cm−2 and heating at (a) T = 450 °C, (b) T = 500 °C, and (c) T = 550 °C. (d) GI-XRD patterns of the CuBi2O4 converted from nanoBi4O5I2 with D = 50 μL cm−2 at various T. 
GI-XRD analyses were applied to confirm the composition of the CuBi2O4. Strong peaks at 20.88°, 28.01°, and 46.7°, which can be assigned to lattice planes of tetragonal CuBi2O4 (JCPDS no. 48-1886), are observable if the heat treatment temperature is above 450 °C. However, Bi2O2.33 (JCPDS no. 27-0051) and CuO (JCPDS no. 48-1548) also exists in samples converted from nanoBi4O5I2 if T is below 550 °C. During the heat treatment, nanoBi4O5I2 is presumably firstly decomposed to I2 and Bi2O2.33, and Bi2O2.33 reacts with CuO to form CuBi2O4.11e PEC characterization (Fig. S3, ESI†) indicates that higher annealing temperature is beneficial in enhancing the photocurrent. The presence of Bi2O2.33 and CuO impurity phases might act as recombination centres, resulting in the poor performance of CuBi2O4 samples with T less than 550 °C.
The second phase of Bi2O2.33 disappears at T = 550 °C if a sufficient amount of Cu2+ solution is applied to nanoBi4O5I2 (D ≧ 40 μL cm−2, Fig. S4, ESI†). However, additional peaks belonging to CuO are still observable if D exceeds 40 μL cm−2. The amount of Cu2+ solution and heat treatment temperature are therefore optimised to 40 μL cm−2 and 550 °C, respectively, to obtain well-crystallized and relatively pure CuBi2O4 (Fig. 3a). The resultant CuBi2O4, designated as microCuBi2O4, exhibits a uniformly distributed micro-texture structure on the FTO substrate. UV-vis spectroscopy suggests that microCuBi2O4 absorbs light up to approximately 680 nm and the corresponding Tauc plot indicates that microCuBi2O4 has a direct band gap (Eg) of ∼1.8 eV, which is in agreement with the reported value.11a,11c,11e

Mott–Schottky analyses were recorded in a 0.1 M Bi buffer solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 9.2) under N2 atmosphere. Insets in (b), (c), (d) are the photograph image, Tauc plot, and schematic band structure of microCuBi2O4, respectively. 
Mott–Schottky analyses were performed for gaining more insights into the electronic structure of microCuBi2O4. The negative slopes in the Mott–Schottky plot confirm the p-type feature of microCuBi2O4. Lines at two different frequencies of 500 Hz and 1 kHz show similar slopes and extrapolated x-axis intercepts, meeting the criteria of the independency on the frequency of Mott–Schottky analyses. The flat band potential therefore can be estimated from the extrapolated x-axis intercepts of approximately 1.4 V vs. RHE, similar to the reported value.11a,11c The extremely positive flat band edge of CuBi2O4 is beneficial for coupling it with a photoanode in a tandem configuration for overall solar water splitting. For a heavily p-doped semiconductor, its valence band is close to its flat band edge,8d and the corresponding electronic level positions of microCuBi2O4 are then estimated based on Tauc plot and Mott–Schottky analyses and depicted as shown in the inset of Fig. 3d.
The PEC performance of microCuBi2O4 was subsequently investigated in a three-electrode system in a 0.1 M Bi buffer solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte at pH 9.2. MicroCuBi2O4 exhibits a very positive onset potential at approximately 1.0 V vs. RHE, which is close to its flat band potential of 1.4 V vs. RHE. The photocurrent response of 90 μA cm−2 was obtained at an applied potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE ((i) in Fig. 4a). A significant dark current is observable only if the potential is negative than 0.2 V vs. RHE ((i) in Fig. 4a). MicroCuBi2O4 shows a much better photocurrent response in an alkaline solution (Fig. S5, ESI†) with an approximate five-fold increase in photocurrent compared with that in the near neutral solution at 0.4 V vs. RHE. However, compatible operating conditions are necessary for both photocathode and photoanode in a tandem device. BiVO4 likely dissolves in strong alkaline solutions and for this reason, a near-neutral Bi buffer solution was chosen as the suitable electrolyte for the following experiments.
 Fig. 4  (a) The current density (J)–potential (E) curve of microCuBi2O4 recorded in an aqueous 0.1 M Bi buffer solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 9.2) under (i) N2 and (ii) O2 atmosphere under solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) and (b) the corresponding ψsep and ψox of microCuBi2O4. 
A theoretical absorbing photocurrent current (Jabs) of 10.7 mA cm−2 is reachable for microCuBi2O4 by assuming 100% absorbed photon to current conversion efficiency for photons with an energy larger than its corresponding Eg of 1.8 eV.3a,18 However, the practical photocurrent (JPEC) of microCuBi2O4 in (i) of Fig. 4a is much less than its respective theoretical value. In practice, JPEC is determined by (i) the yield of the generated electrons reaching the electrode surface (ψsep), (ii) yield of the surface-reaching electrons that are transferred into the species in solution (ψox) and (iii) Jabs by the following equation: JPEC = Jabs × ψsep × ψox(1)
To decouple the photon absorption and charge separation from the catalytic ability of the photoelectrodes towards hydrogen evolution, PEC analysis in a O2 saturated solution was also carried out as photo-reduction of O2 is much more kinetically favourable ((ii) in Fig. 4a). The ψsep of microCuBi2O4 is only approximately 3% at 0.6 V vs. RHE and reaches an optimum of 4.5% at 0.3 V vs. RHE by assuming ψox is unity for photo-reduction of O2 (Fig. 4b). On the other hand, the ψox of microCuBi2O4 is only 7.6% and 16.4% at 0.6 V and 0.3 V vs. RHE, respectively, derived by dividing the photocurrent obtained in an N2 saturated solution with that obtained in an O2 saturated solution.
A cobalt based catalyst electrodeposited from a buffered solution containing cobalt ions has been identified as a Janus catalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions.19 A layer of cobalt based catalysts was therefore further electrodeposited on microCuBi2O4 (microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi) from a Bi solution containing Co2+ at 0.3 V vs. RHE under solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) and a significant enhancement on the photocurrent is observed at potentials positive of 0.7 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5). The ψox of microCuBi2O4 is increased from 2.7% to 64% at 0.8 V vs. RHE after modification of Co–Bi. However, microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi exhibits a lower photocurrent than that of microCuBi2O4 at more negative potential regions (E < 0.7 V vs. RHE), which is possibly attributed to the pinch-off effect between the semiconductor and metal interface.20 Platinum is the benchmark hydrogen evolution catalyst and was also deposited on microCuBi2O4 (microCuBi2O4|Pt) for comparison. The photocurrent of microCuBi2O4 is significantly enhanced by the modification with Pt in the whole potential window from 1.0 V vs. RHE to 0.25 V vs. RHE. However, microCuBi2O4|Pt exhibits a slightly lower photocurrent compared with that of microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi at potentials positive of 0.7 V vs. RHE. MicroCuBi2O4|Co–Bi serves as a better candidate in assembling an inexpensive and scalable tandem cell by preventing the use of expensive and scarce Pt. To analyse the PEC performance of microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi in the bottom-absorber position in a tandem PEC cell, its photocurrent was also recorded with incident solar light filtered by a nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi electrode (Fig. S6, ESI†). MicroCuBi2O4|Co–Bi still exhibits an onset potential close to 1.0 V vs. RHE in the bottom-absorber position in a tandem PEC cell. However, its photocurrent decreased from approximately 90 μA cm−2 to 30 μA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE.

NanoBiVO4
BiVO4 is a promising photoanode candidate in a dual-photoelectrode tandem PEC cell due to its narrow band gap and a favourable conduction band edge close to the thermodynamic potential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Since microCuBi2O4 is successfully prepared from the template of nanoBi4O5I2 by a simple solution conversion method (see above), we were interested to see if this similar method can also be applied efficiently to the preparation of BiVO4. NanoBiVO4 was prepared by drop-casting 0.2 M VO(acac)2 in DMSO and dried at 50 °C, followed by a 2 h thermal treatment at 450 °C. The as-prepared nanoBiVO4 was further soaked in NaOH to remove excess V2O5. The amount of VO(acac)2 solution was optimised to D = 50 μL cm−2 in respect to obtaining the highest PEC performance and reproducibility (Fig. S7, ESI†).
GI-XRD analysis confirms that nanoBiVO4 has a pure monoclinic scheelite structure (JCPDS # 14-0688) without other crystalline impurity phases (Fig. 6a). NanoBiVO4 exhibits a uniform coral-like structure on the FTO substrate and the morphologies are distinct from the sheet structures of the nanoBi4O5I2 template and microCuBi2O4 (Fig. 6b). However, the discrete two-dimensional structure of nanoBi4O5I2 serves as a scaffold to direct the growth of hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructures of BiVO4 with sufficient voids between the crystals. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and the corresponding Tauc plot suggest that nanoBiVO4 has a bandgap of 2.5 eV and a Jabs of 3.7 mA cm−2.
 Fig. 6  The (a) GI-XRD pattern, (b) top-view SEM image, (c) UV-vis absorption spectrum, and (d) Mott–Schottky plot of nanoBiVO4. The Mott–Schottky analyses were recorded in an aqueous Bi buffer solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 9.2) under N2 atmosphere. Insets in (b), (c), (d) are the photograph image, Tauc plot, and schematic band structure of nanoBiVO4, respectively. 
The electronic structure of nanoBiVO4 was also deduced from the UV-vis spectroscopy and the Mott–Schottky analyses (Fig. 6c and d). The positive slopes in the Mott–Schottky plot confirm the n-type feature of nanoBiVO4. NanoBiVO4 shows different slopes at frequencies of 500 Hz and 1 kHz in Mott–Schottky analyses which might be attributed to the existence of surface states.21 However, it exhibits similar extrapolated x-axis intercepts, and the flat band potential can be estimated to be approximately 0.15 V vs. RHE. For an n-type semiconductor, its flat band potential is close to its conduction band edge and therefore the respective valence band edge can be further determined to be approximately 2.65 V vs. RHE by considering the band gap of 2.5 eV (Fig. 6).
The PEC performance of nanoBiVO4 was investigated in a three-electrode system in the pH 9.2 Bi solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO3. Na2SO3 serves as a hole-scavenger allowing us to study the performance of nanoBiVO4 in the elimination of surface recombination and to obtain ψsep by considering that ψox is unity for sulfite oxidation. NanoBiVO4 showed an onset photocurrent at approximately 0.2 V vs. RHE and reached approximately 1.7 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 7). The ψsep of nanoBiVO4 is then estimated to be 46% at 1.23 V vs. RHE by eqn (1) with JPEC and Jabs equal to 1.7 mA cm−2 and 3.7 mA cm−2, respectively. The nanoBiVO4 has a higher ψsep than that of planar BiVO4, which usually has a ψsep among 20–30%.22 This implies that the nanostructure helps the charge separation by decoupling the transport direction of electrons and holes. NanoBiVO4 was further studied for water oxidation in a Bi buffer solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. NanoBiVO4 exhibits a similar onset potential at 0.2 V vs. RHE, but a much lower photocurrent of 0.49 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE than that in sulfite solution, corresponding to a ψox of only 29% (Fig. 7) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Co–Bi is an effective water oxidation catalyst in neutral and near-neutral solutions and was electrodeposited on nanoBiVO4 (nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi) by the identical method for the preparation of Co based HER catalyst on CuBi2O4. By interfacing with Co–Bi, the photocurrent increases to 1.48 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and the corresponding ψox increases to approximate 87% (Fig. 7a).

BiVO4–CuBi2O4 tandem cell
A tandem PEC cell was further assembled by pairing nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi and microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi (BiVO4–CuBi2O4) for overall water splitting under solar-light irradiation and their photoelectrochemical performance was investigated in a two-chamber cell separated with a PEM. Solar light was firstly absorbed by nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi as nanoBiVO4 has a larger band gap than that of microCuBi2O4, and the attenuated light was absorbed by the back cell of microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi. Both photoanode and photocathode were back-illuminated. The optical properties of nanoBiVO4 did not show significant differences after depositing Co–Bi, although a slightly stronger absorbance was observed for Co–Bi modified nanoBiVO4 in the wavelength range of 400–460 nm (Fig. S8†). The opaque effect of Co–Bi on the tandem cell performance can therefore be neglected.

Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent density responses of the tandem PEC cell at various applied biases from 0 to 1.23 V in an aqueous Bi solution (0.1 M, pH 9.2) with Na2SO4 (0.5 M) as supporting electrolyte. A bias-free photocurrent of 36 μA cm−2 was observed, which is consistent with the prediction from the half-cell performances of nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi and microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi (Fig. 8). MicroCuBi2O4|Co–Bi has a much lower photocurrent than that of nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi, and therefore, the tandem cell performance is limited by the microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi photocathode. A photocurrent of approximately 0.11 mA cm−2 was achieved at an applied bias of 0.2 V for the tandem cell, which is in agreement with the half-cell PEC results by considering some losses in polarization due to membrane and solution resistances (Fig. S9, ESI†). EIS analyses were applied to quantify the increased resistance incurred in moving the working electrode to a tandem (two-electrode) system, and the results showed that an additional resistance of 55 ohm was imparted to the ohmic loss in a tandem cell device.
 Fig. 8  (a) A linear sweep voltammetry scan and its corresponding ABPE in a two-electrode configuration of a BiVO4–CuBi2O4 tandem cell under chopped solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). (b) Overlaid |J|–E curves in a three electrode configuration of a BiVO4|Co–Bi electrode (black) under chopped solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G) and a microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi electrode placed in the tandem cell position (illumination was filtered by nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi, red). The magnified figure is shown in the inset. 
Applied bias solar-to-photocurrent conversion efficiency (ABPE) is a representative indication of the performance of an integrated PEC cell and is defined by the following equation: (2)where |J| is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), V is the applied bias (V) to the tandem cell, and Pin is the energy flux of the incident irradiation (mW cm−2). Theoretical water-electrolysis voltage is 1.23 V, and therefore any V greater than 1.23 V is meaningless in a two-electrode PEC system.23 A maximum ABPE of 0.22% was achieved at a bias of 0.7 V for the tandem PEC cell. However, microCuBi2O4 acts as a dark electrode rather than a photoelectrode in the tandem PEC cell when the external applied bias is higher than 0.2 V (Fig. S9, ESI†). The photocurrent obtained in the regions from 0.2 V to 1.23 V is, therefore, the result of the compromise of the dark current of microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi with the photocurrent of nanoBiVO4|Co–Bi. The dark current of microCuBi2O4 is likely the result of the electrode corrosion, and as a result, ABPE obtained in the external applied biases of over 0.2 V is insubstantial for hydrogen generation.
Theoretically, a STH efficiency of approximately 8% is achievable by pairing a back cell having a band gap of 1.8 eV with a front cell having a band gap of 2.5 eV in a stacked configuration.13 The practical STH efficiency of the BiVO4–CuBi2O4 tandem cell can be calculated by the following equation: (3)where |Jsc| is the photocurrent density measured at zero applied bias (mA cm−2) and FE is the faradaic efficiency of hydrogen evolution. A STH efficiency of 0.04% is achievable by assuming the FE is unity. However, the STH efficiency of the BiVO4–CuBi2O4 tandem cell is significantly lower than its theoretical STH efficiency. The major limitation is ascribed to the relatively poor performance of the microCuBi2O4|Co–Bi photocathode. Poor ψsep and ψox are the main hurdles in achieving high half-cell performance of microCuBi2O4. Although Co–Bi partially alleviated the poor performance of ψox in CuBi2O4, it also results in a pinch-off effect which is deleterious to the photocurrents of CuBi2O4 at more negative potentials (E < 0.7 V). Searching for other inexpensive catalysts that do not level off the photocurrent of CuBi2O4 will be beneficial for enhancing the operating photocurrent as well as the STH efficiency of the tandem PEC cell. Compared with nanoBiVO4, microCuBi2O4 has more than one order less ψsep (46% vs. 3%). Tailoring the structure of CuBi2O4 from microstructure to nanostructure by fine-tuning the preparation conditions might further enhance the ψsep of CuBi2O4 by decreasing its bulk recombination.
4 Conclusions
Developing a universal method for facile preparation of both photoanode and photocathode is beneficial for accelerating the research on dual-photoelectrode tandem PEC cells. In this study, a facile and straightforward synthetic approach has been successfully developed for the preparation of micro-textured CuBi2O4 and nanocoral BiVO4 photoelectrodes from one nanoBi4O5I2 template. The synthesized CuBi2O4 photocathode and BiVO4 photoanode exhibited an overall photovoltage of approximately 2.0 V, which is beneficial in realizing water splitting without external bias. The interfacial charge transfer efficiency for both photoelectrodes was further improved by surface-modification with a Co–Bi Janus electrocatalyst via photo-assisted deposition. A proof-of-concept tandem PEC cell consisting of a CuBi2O4|Co–Bi photocathode and a BiVO4|Co–Bi photoanode was finally assembled and generated a bias-free photocurrent of 36 μA cm−2, corresponding to a STH efficiency of 0.04% by assuming the FE is unity. Further improvements on the half-cell performance with respect to the charge separation and charge transfer yields of the CuBi2O4 photocathode is indispensable for fabricating an efficient BiVO4–CuBi2O4 tandem PEC cell.
