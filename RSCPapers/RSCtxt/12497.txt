    , Accepted 11th March 2016First published on 11th March 2016AbstractCross-stacked superaligned carbon nanotube (CSCNT) sheets drawn from CNT arrays with excellent conductivity, porosity and flexibility are used as low-cost back contacts for hole conductor-free mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PSCs integrated with CSCNTs achieve a power conversion efficiency of up to 8.65% and over 10.54% by further doping the CSCNTs with iodine. Moreover, PSCs encapsulated with a layer of polymer poly(methylmethacrylate) exhibit outstanding stability in the dark and under illumination. This work represents a significant step toward the commercialization of the low-cost, stable and high-efficiency hole conductor-free PSCs.
Introduction
Since the seminal work by Kojima et al. in 2009,1 organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained considerable research momentum during the past years,2–6 primarily due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and energy-saving device processing techniques. Continued development of the compositional engineering of perovskite absorbers, optimization of device interfaces and improvement of fabricated technologies have steadily increased the certified PCEs of PSCs over 20%.7–10 Generally, high efficiency PSCs prevalently employ an expensive organic semiconductor, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), to act as a hole transport material (HTM). Due to the intrinsically low hole mobility and conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD, it generally needs to be p-doped with a redox-active lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonimide to achieve appreciable conductivity.11,12 However, such doping commonly leads to a wide variance in terms of photovoltaic performance, reproducibility and device stability, especially.13,14 Some inorganic materials like CuSCN, CuI, and NiO have been demonstrated with success to work as HTMs.15–20 On the other hand, perovskite absorbers themselves, except for acting as light absorbers, also could assume the role of a HTM.21–23 Etgar et al. first reported that CH3NH3PbI3 in mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cells could simultaneously function as both light harvester and hole conductor, obviating the need for employing an additional HTM.21 However, the most often used back contacts in PSCs have still been achieved with vapor deposited precious metals (usually gold or silver), whose high cost and limited availability are very likely to hamper the industrial deployment of perovskite photovoltaic technology. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop alternative back contacts that are earth-abundant and energy non-intensive for HTM-free and high efficiency PSCs.
Efforts have been devoted to developing low cost back contacts capable of replacing the precious metals in HTM-free PSCs.24–28 Han et al. designed promising HTM-free mesoscopic CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunctions that use a double layer of TiO2 and ZrO2 as a scaffold, and a porous carbon/graphite composite electrode as a back contact, in which the perovskite solution was cast into the TiO2/ZrO2 scaffold from the carbon/graphite electrode side by drop-infiltration deposition.26 Currently, PCEs exceeding 11% have been achieved by judicious modification of perovskite absorbers, TiO2 scaffolds and carbon contacts.27,29–33 Notably, the performance of this kind of PSC should be significantly affected by at least three key factors associated with the carbon contact: conductivity, porosity and uniformity.31,32 To obtain a porous electrode for facilitating perovskite solution infiltration from the carbon contact side, however, the carbon/graphite composite electrode requires to be sintered at high temperatures (450–500 °C) with the aid of polymeric binders, for example, ethylcellulose, which is energy-consuming and also renders them incompatible with flexible plastic substrates.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been recently studied as conductive back contacts or HTMs for PSCs due to their excellent conductivity and chemical stability.24,25,33–35 For example, Wei et al. recently used multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an effective replacement for Au in HTM-free PSCs.35 The PCE of the device (∼12.67%) is comparable with that of the HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs based on carbon/graphite back contacts, which may be ascribed to the superior conductivity of the MWCNT electrode, as well as the sufficient contact between the MWCNTs and perovskite. We previously devised an efficient strategy for fabricating cross-stacked superaligned carbon nanotube (CSCNT) sheets, in which superaligned CNTs prepared by chemical vapor deposition were assembled into continuous films by using a convenient cross-stacking technique.36–38 The ultrahigh aspect ratio (∼104) of the CNTs and continuously cross-stacked mode render the CSCNTs with excellent conductivity and abundant pores, which make CSCNTs attractive candidates for potential uses in many areas where CNTs or metals have been exploited, such as touch panels, loudspeakers, lithium-ion batteries, dye-sensitized solar cells, etc.39–41 In this contribution, we introduced the CSCNTs into HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs as efficient back contacts by using a facile and convenient integration technique at low temperature, obviating the energy-consuming sintering process. The resulting cell, with a configuration of FTO/TiO2(CH3NH3PbI3)/Al2O3(CH3NH3PbI3)/CSCNTs (CH3NH3PbI3)/poly-(methylmethacrylate), demonstrates a promising photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 8.6%. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that doping CSCNTs with iodine led to improved photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with a PCE of 10.54%. Moreover, we showed that the PSCs encapsulated with poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) could efficiently prevent device performance degradation when exposed to a highly humid atmosphere and light soaking. This work demonstrated that the highly conductive, porous and uniform CSCNTs are excellent back contacts for HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs and the facile and convenient integration of CSCNTs also can provide a new opportunity for fabricating flexible PSCs by roll-to-roll manufacturing.
Experimental
Fabrication of CSCNTs
The superaligned CNT arrays comprising CNTs with a length of 300 μm were synthesized in batches on 6 inch silicon wafers with iron as the catalyst and acetylene as the precursor in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LP-CVD) system.36–38 Briefly, the 6 inch silicon wafer coated with thin Fe films (3.5–5.5 nm thick) was first placed horizontally in the middle of the tube furnaces and then was heated up in the flowing argon gas to the growth temperature of 680–720 °C for 15 min. Then hydrogen and acetylene were added to the argon gas to start the growth of superaligned CNT arrays. Uniform superaligned arrays with a length of 300 μm on silicon wafer can be achieved under the conditions of 500 sccm acetylene plus 50 sccm hydrogen. The growth of superaligned CNT arrays on silicon wafers has been successfully scaled up with wafer diameter up to 8 inch to meet the industrial requirements. The cross-stacked superaligned CNT films were directly drawn out from the arrays and stacked onto stainless steel holders layer by layer. A CSCNT sheet is fabricated by sequentially stacking the superaligned CNTs on a metallic frame along one direction, followed by stacking in its perpendicular direction. After that, the CSCNT sheets were shrunk and tightened by dipping them into ethanol for 1 min. I-CSCNTs were prepared by placing the CSCNT sheets loaded on the holders in the iodine vapor at 200 °C for 8 h. For comparison, the T-CSCNTs were also obtained by placing the CSCNT sheets in a nitrogen atmosphere at 200 °C for 8 h.
Material synthesis and preparation
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was synthesized using a previously described method.4 In brief, CH3NH3I was prepared by neutralizing equimolar amounts of HI and aqueous CH3NH2 solution. The product was then crystallized by removing the solvent in a hot plate at 100 °C. The produced CH3NH3I was washed with diethyl ether three times and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight for 24 h. To prepare the perovskite precursor, CH3NH3I was firstly dissolved into γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and stirred for 2 h. PbI2 was subsequently added to the CH3NH3I/GBL solution (PbI2:CH3NH3I, 1:1 molar ratio). The total concentration of the perovskite precursor was 22 wt%. After that, the mixed precursor solution was heated and stirred on a hotplate at 70 °C overnight to promote dissolution of the solid material. The precursor solution was filtered through PTFE filters (0.45 μm) in a nitrogen-filled glove box before use.
Device fabrication
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (sheet resistance 7 Ω sq−1) was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, separately. Ultraviolet/O3 was subsequently used to treat the cleaned FTO glass for 15 min. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited by spin-coating an acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol onto the cleaned FTO substrate at a speed of 2000 rpm for 60 s. The compact layers were dried at 150 °C for 30 min and then annealed in air at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous layer was deposited on the compact layer by spin-coating a colloidal dispersion of TiO2 paste (20 nm, PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd., Japan, diluted with ethanol at a weight of 1/1.8) at 3500 rpm for 45 s, and then drying at 125 °C for 10 min and further annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min. After the mesoporous film was cooled down to room temperature, a layer of Al2O3 was deposited by a colloidal dispersion of Al2O3 nanoparticles (<50 nm), followed by drying at 200 °C for 45 min. After the films were cooled to room temperature naturally, the CSCNT sheets were transferred onto an Al2O3 scaffold to form CSCNT cathodes with the aid of a small droplet of chlorobenzene. After fabricating the CSCNT electrodes, the samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. 20 μL of perovskite precursor was then dropped on the top of the CSCNT layer and allowed to stand for 15 min. Then 100 μL of perovskite precursor was dropped on the top of the CSCNTs and then spin-coated at 7000 rpm for 45 s, followed by drying at 70 °C on a hot plate for 45 min and 100 °C for 45 min, respectively. After the device was cooled to room temperature, a solution of PMMA (110 mg mL−1 in toluene) was spin-coated on the devices at 4000 rpm for 60 s.
For the fabrication of standard PSCs, a mesoporous layer was deposited on the compact layer by spin-coating a colloidal dispersion of TiO2 paste (20 nm, PST-18NR, diluted with ethanol at a weight of 1/4) at 5000 rpm for 45 s, and annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min. The perovskite precursor was deposited on the mesoporous TiO2 layer by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box for 45 min.
For the fabrication of standard PSCs with the spiro-OMeTAD HTM and evaporated gold electrode, 60 μL of 1 mL chlorobenzene solution containing 73.2 g spiro-OMeTAD, 18.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine and 29 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1) was cast onto the perovskite and spun at a rate of 4000 rpm for 60 s. The samples were left in dry air for 12 h before evaporating the gold cathode.
For standard I-CSCNT-based PSCs, the I-CSCNT sheets were transferred onto the perovskite film to form CSCNT cathodes with the aid of a small droplet of chlorobenzene. For the CSCNT-based PSCs with spiro-OMeTAD HTM, after the CSCNT film deposition, 100 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was then dropped on the top of the CSCNT layer and left to stand for 5 min and then spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The devices were left in dry air for 12 h before testing.
Material and device characterization
The morphology of the samples was characterized by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM: LEO 1530, Gemini, Zeiss, Germany). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded on a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher SCIENTIFIC INC., USA). Raman spectra were recorded on a laser micro-Raman spectroscope (Hr800, Horiba Jobin Yvon, France) with a laser beam wavelength of 633 nm. The sheet resistance of the CSCNT sheets was measured by using a digital four-point probe system (SX1934, Suzhou, China) at room temperature. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs were measured using a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA, calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell) with a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) at 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The J–V curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask (0.12 cm2). The IPCE was characterized by using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements, USA). Prior to measurement, a standard silicon solar cell was used as the reference. The impedance measurements were carried out with a Zahner Ennium electrochemical station (Zahner, Zahner-Electrik GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) in the frequency range of 2 MHz to 1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV. Impedance spectra were recorded in the dark under varying bias voltages. The temperatures and humidity of the stability measurements were controlled by using a temperature humidity chamber (RP-80A, Beijing Hongzhan Instrument Co., Ltd.).
Results and discussion
A CSCNT sheet is fabricated by stacking the superaligned CNT layers crossly in sequence on a metallic frame, and then dipping them in ethanol for densifying.38 By changing the cross-stacking times, different thicknesses of CSCNT sheets can be obtained. To obtain I-CSCNTs, CSCNTs loaded on the metallic frame were treated in iodine vapor at 200 °C. The reason for selecting iodine as the dopant atoms is that iodine has been considered as an efficient and stable dopant to enhance the conductivity of CNTs,42–45 which could be beneficial for the further PCE improvement of PSCs.

Fig. 1a and b show the representative SEM images of the as-fabricated CSCNTs and I-CSCNTs, which revealed the typical cross-stacking structure. CNTs in CSCNTs are generally parallel to each other within the same layer, and perpendicular to each other between neighboring layers.38 The individual CNT in CSCNTs has a fairly uniform diameter, while most of them have formed bundles when drawn out from the superaligned arrays. The formation of bundles of CNTs in the same layer undoubtedly favors the conductivity of CSCNTs. The sequential stacking of superaligned CNTs leads to a 3D porous network with interconnected channels. After being treated in iodine vapor at 200 °C, the I-CSCNTs show a similar morphology with CSCNTs, as shown in Fig. 1b. However, it is obviously observed that, after doping, the CNTs in I-CSCNTs are packed more densely than those in pristine CSCNTs, and a similar phenomenon was also observed for the thermally treated (without iodine doping) CSCNTs (T-CSCNTs) (Fig. S1†). These results indicate that the doping or thermal treatment process could draw cross-stacked CNTs close, which enhances the interaction between CNTs and thereby could improve the conductivity of CSCNTs to some extent. Raman spectroscopy was employed to differentiate the crystalline structure of those CSCNTs. Both CSCNTs and I-CSCNTs exhibited a disorder-induced D-band (∼1350 cm−1), a doubly degenerate G-band (∼1580 cm−1) and a strong single-sharp 2D band (∼2700 cm−1) (Fig. S2†). Notably, after doping with iodine a peak appeared at ∼155 cm−1 for I-CSCNTs, which can be assigned to the polyiodide (I3−, I5−etc.) doped in I-CSCNTs.42,46 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of I-CSCNTs shows two I 3d peaks (619.7 eV, 631.5 eV), further confirming the presence of iodine in I-CSCNTs (Fig. S3†).42,47 The iodine content in I-CSCNTs was ca. 0.74 at%. The successful doping of iodine was expected to tune the properties of I-CSCNTs with improved conductivity. Therefore, with the alternatively cross-stacked mode, the CSCNT and I-CSCNT possess the merits of robust structural stability, abundant porosity, as well as 3D charge freeway, thereby making them prospective back contacts for mesoscopic HTM-free PSCs.

To evaluate the potential function of CSCNTs in PSCs, HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs with CH3NH3PbI3 applied as the light absorber and hole conductor, as well as CSCNTs used as back contacts were fabricated. Fig. 2a illustrates the device configuration used in this study. Fig. 2b shows the energy level of each layer in the device. Under irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the CH3NH3PbI3 conduction band inject into TiO2, while the holes in CH3NH3PbI3 inject into the CSCNTs due to the work function of CSCNTs being ~4.9 eV.48,49Fig. 2c and d show typical cross-sectional SEM images of a complete PSC fabricated with CSCNTs consisting of 50 layers of superaligned CNTs. The total thickness of the PSCs, as clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2d, is about 5.6 μm, consisting of 600 nm conductive FTO, a 60 nm compact TiO2 layer (Fig. S4†), a 700 nm-thick perovskite filled mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, a 320 nm-thick perovskite filled Al2O3 porous layer, a 2.5 μm perovskite filled CSCNT layer and a 1.5 μm PMMA layer. The porous Al2O3 insulating layer is to prohibit the CSCNTs from directly contacting TiO2.27 Owing to the cross-stacking mode of CSCNTs, casting perovskite into 3D porous CSCNTs enables individual CNT or CNT bundles to be enwrapped with perovskite. Therefore, the unique and highly ordered structure of highly conductive CSCNTs not only ensures the full contact between CNTs and perovskite, but also facilitates 3D hole extraction and collection. We have firstly evaluated the influence of layer numbers of CNTs on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. For simplicity, the CSCNT sheets with 25-, 50- and 75-layer CNTs were abbreviated as CSCNT-25, CSCNT-50, and CSCNT-75, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the J–V characteristics of the PSCs with different CSCNTs under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 solar irradiation and a summary of the key device parameters is tabulated in Table 1. All PSCs in this study were tested at a scan rate of 0.0215 V s−1. The PSC with CSCNT-25 presents a promising photovoltaic performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 878 mV, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.43 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.53, yielding an overall PCE of 6.81%. Interestingly, the PCE was improved with increased CNT layers, that is, both CSCNT-50 and CSCNT-75-based devices exhibit better photovoltaic performance than the PSCs with CSCNT-25, due to their higher conductivity (Table 1). The device with CSCNT-50 delivers a Voc, Jsc and FF of 14.91 mA cm−2, 849 mV and 0.67, respectively, leading to a PCE of 8.65%. Yet it is difficult to further improve the photovoltaic performance by increasing the thickness of CNTs to 75 layers although the conductivity of CSCNT-75 is higher than that of CSCNT-50. This may be attributed to the fact that the CSCNTs far away from the FTO side, which made a long distance travelling for the holes produced in CH3NH3PbI3, contribute less to the hole extraction and collection. Fig. S5† shows the J–V curves with different scan directions and scan rates in the case of CSCNT-50 based PSC; it can be observed that the PSC tested at a rate of 0.0215 V s−1 shows minimal hysteresis. The hysteresis in PSCs is strongly dependent on the contact material and device architecture and probably originates from the long range migration and accumulation of ionic species within the perovskite, as discussed in our previous work.50

As mentioned above, the iodine doping could increase the conductivity of I-CSCNTs, and the thermal treatment also could enhance the conductivity of T-CSCNTs to some extent. Therefore, we investigated the photovoltaic performance of PSCs with T-CSCNT-50 and I-CSCNT-50 as back contacts, with the results shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1. Compared with that of pristine CSCNT-50, the PCE of T-CSCNT-50-based PSCs was slightly improved from 8.60% to 9.37%. Impressively, when integrating I-CSCNT-50 into PSCs, the PCE of I-CSCNT-50-based PSCs could be further improved to 10.54%, a value that is comparable to that of the carbon-based HTM-free PSCs based on random network-type single-walled carbon nanotube back contacts (11%).24 However, the PCEs of our devices seem to be lower than those of the state-of-the-art carbon-based HTM-free PSCs due to the relatively low Jsc or poor FF,27,35 which could be attributed to the difficulty to fill enough perovskite into the TiO2 layer or not ideal carrier transporting properties.51 In addition, we also fabricated standard PSCs with the spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD HTM and evaporated gold back contact and I-CSCNT-based PSCs with and without spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. S6.† The PCE of standard I-CSCNT-based PSCs without spiro-OMeTAD (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/I-CSCNT) was 7.70%. This relatively low PCE could be attributed to the poor contact between perovskite and I-CSCNTs.35 As expected, the I-CSCNT-based PSCs fabricated with spiro-OMeTAD achieved a higher PCE of 13.12%. However, the Jsc and PCE of the device fabricated with I-CSCNT and spiro-OMeTAD were still lower than that of standard PSCs fabricated with spin-coated spiro-OMeTAD and the evaporated gold back contact (14.76%), probably because of the relatively low conductivity and reflectivity of the I-CSCNT back contact as compared to the Au electrode.24 Fig. S7† presents the J–V curves for the different HTM-free PSCs with different scan directions at a rate of 0.0215 V s−1, which clearly show no large hysteresis in the J–V curves of the investigated devices. We also recorded the photocurrent density of the corresponding HTM-PSC held at a forward bias near their maximum output power point as a function of time to monitor the stabilized power output under working conditions. As observed in Fig. S8,† for the devices with T-CSCNT-50 and I-CSCNT-50, the photocurrent density stabilized within seconds to approximately 14.6 and 15.5 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized PCEs of 9.34% and 10.40%, respectively, which is consistent with the J–V measurements. The incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs fabricated with T-CSCNT-50 and I-CSCNT-50 are shown in Fig. 4b. The photocurrent generation for PSCs started at around 800 nm, in agreement with the observed band gap of 1.55 eV.52 The use of I-CSCNT-50 gave a little improvement of the IPCE values in the visible to near-infrared wavelength regime, especially in the region between 400 and 650 nm. Integrating the IPCE spectrum yielded photocurrent densities of 15.46 and 16.37 mA cm−2 for the PSCs based on T-CSCNT-50 and I-CSCNT-50, respectively, which are in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density.

The increased PCEs of T-CSCNT-50 based PSCs can be attributed to the enhanced conductivity of T-CSCNT-50. By thermally treating the CSCNT films at 200 °C, CNTs at the cross-junctions between different CNT layers will be drawn close, enhancing the interaction between CNTs and thus reducing tube-to-tube junction resistance because CNTs are quite flexible and have very clean surfaces, accompanied by the decrease of the sheet resistance of T-CSCNT-50 to 30 ± 1.5 Ω sq−1 from 43 ± 2.1 Ω sq−1 for CSCNT-50. More importantly, doping CSCNTs with iodine not only could draw the CNTs very close, but also efficiently promote charge transfer between dopants and the CNTs and thus increase the carrier concentrations of CNTs, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity of CSCNTs.42,45 From our conductivity measurement, I-CSCNT-50 showed a sheet resistance of 16 ± 2.3 Ω sq−1, which is lower than that of T-CSCNT-50 and pristine CSCNT-50. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) has also been employed to understand the interfacial recombination processes in CSCNT-based PSCs. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of CSCNT-based PSCs at a bias of 0.7 V in the dark. One typical arc can be distinguished from the Nyquist plots, and this arc could be related to the overall interfacial recombination resistance (Rrec) in the devices.29,35 Considering that the back contact is the only different part in these cells, the conductivity of the back contact can be directly reflected on the measured Rs values. As shown in Fig. 5a, it is found that the I-CSCNT-based PSC has the lowest Rs, and the value of Rs is consistent with the trend of square resistances of back contacts shown in Table 1. Fig. 5b presents the curve of the derived Rrec as a function of applied voltage; it can be seen that Rrec is in the order of I-CSCNT < T-CSCNT < CSCNT in all applied voltage ranges. The larger Rrec implicates a stronger suppression of charge recombination in I-CSCNT based PSCs.29,35 Therefore, combining with its 3D hole extraction and collection, the highly conductive I-CSCNT-50 not only ensures that the holes collected in doped CSCNTs rapidly transport to the external circuit, but also suppresses the recombination between holes and electrons in PSCs, synergistically leading to an increase in FF and Jsc.

Inset in (b) is the equivalent circuit diagram. Rs: the series resistance, Rrec: the overall interfacial recombination resistance. 
In addition to enhanced conductivity, the introduction of iodine into CSCNTs also modified the surface properties of I-CSCNTs, and subsequently improved the crystallinity of perovskite as well as increased the perovskite grain size in the I-CSCNT based perovskite film. Fig. 6a and b show the contact angle images of the perovskite precursor solution (GBL–PbI2–CH3NH3I) on CSCNT and I-CSCNT films, respectively. The contact angles measured for CSCNTs and I-CSCNTs were 64 ± 2.3° and 39 ± 1.8°, respectively. The better wettability of I-CSCNTs facilitated closer contact of I-CSCNTs and the perovskite precursor and thus favored the perovskite crystal to grow in contact with the I-CSCNT surface. Fig. 6c and d show the top surface morphologies of the CSCNT and I-CSCNT based perovskite films. In both cases, the CNTs could be wrapped by the perovskite. In addition, the perovskite grains cast into CSCNT and I-CSCNT networks were connected with each other. Interestingly, the grain size of perovskite in the I-CSCNT based film was obviously much larger than that in the CSCNT based film. The larger grains could reduce the grain boundary defects and thus improve the charge transport properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.53Fig. 6e shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CSCNT and I-CSCNT based perovskite films. The peaks at 14.2°, 28.5°, 31.9°, and 40.7° could be assigned to the (110), (220), (310) and (224) faces of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3, respectively.54 Very impressively, compared with that of the CH3NH3PbI3 deposited on glass (Fig. S9†), the XRD patterns of the CSCNT and I-CSCNT based perovskite films show significantly increased intensity ratios of the (220) reflection with respect to (110) and (310) reflections, in agreement with the previous results for graphene decorated CH3NH3PbI3.55,56 Such a preferred (220) grain growth was also observed in mixed halide perovskite films induced by the incorporation of Cl, where more (220) grains in PSCs were found to enhance the carrier recombination lifetime.57 Furthermore, it is worth noting that the main peaks ((110), (220) and (310)) in I-CSCNT based perovskite are considerably stronger than those in the CSCNT based perovskite film, suggesting that the perovskite in I-CSCNTs has better crystallinity. We considered that the improved crystallinity probably results from the coordination of PbI2 with the polyiodides doped in I-CSCNTs. As Lewis bases, polyiodides can coordinate with PbI2 and form chain- and network-like structures,58,59 which could retard the transformation kinetics of perovskite and encourage more defect-free crystal growth. The increased grain size and improved crystallinity of perovskite in the I-CSCNT/perovskite hybrid film facilitated hole transport in the perovskite hole conductor, which could also contribute to the increased FF and Jsc of the I-CSCNT-50 based PSCs.

With regard to their commercial viability, one big challenge for PSCs is the aspect of long-term stability.60 The water-solubility of the organic constituent of the perovskite makes PSCs highly prone to rapid degradation in moist environments. The poor stability is unacceptable for practical applications. Encapsulating the PSCs with a water-resistant PMMA polymer offers enhanced protection from moisture and temperatures. We investigated the stability of PSCs encapsulated with the PMMA polymer, as a function of storage time in the dark under constant conditions (constant relative humidity, 75%, constant temperature, 45 °C). As shown in Fig. 7a, the PCE of the I-CSCNT-50-based device remained above 93% of the initial value even after 1500 h of storage in air. In contrast, the PCE of the device fabricated without PMMA encapsulation decreased to 58% of its initial value. In order to elucidate the photo-stability under long-term illumination, the devices were subjected to a constant light soaking (100 mW cm−2) under ambient atmosphere at room temperature (average relative humidity 39 ± 7%, average temperature 20 ± 6 °C), with the result demonstrated in Fig. 7b. It was found that the PCE of PMMA protected PSCs remained above 87% of the initial value after light soaking for about 400 h. Although the PCE of the unencapsulated device decreased to 46% of its initial value within 400 h under light soaking, the encapsulated device exhibited good stability under light soaking, which is in good agreement with the literature.27,61 The above results evidently suggest that it is possible to fabricate humidity-resistant and stable PSCs using PMMA encapsulation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully integrated a highly conductive and porous CSCNT sheet as a metal-free back contact at low temperature in HTM-free mesoscopic PSCs. The device fabricated with CSCNT-50 presents a promising PCE of 8.65% due to the 3D hole extraction and collection of highly conductive CSCNTs. By doping the CSCNTs with iodine, the PCE of the I-CSCNT-50 based PSC can be increased to 10.54% due to the significant improvement in the FF and Jsc resulting from the increased grain size and improved crystallinity of perovskite in the perovskite/I-CSCNT layer as well as the enhanced conductivity of the I-CSCNT back contact. Additionally, PSCs encapsulated with PMMA show outstanding stability in the dark and prolonged light soaking. Our results may provide references for the design and fabrication of effective back contacts for stable and high efficiency carbon-based PSCs.
